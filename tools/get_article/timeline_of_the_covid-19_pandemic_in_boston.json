When restrictions were originally announced in mid-March, they were slated to end at noon on April7; later their projected end date was pushed to May4. Baker said it was unlikely restrictions would be lifted by then because the surge of cases had hit later than expectedMay4 presumed a surge in early April.

The fourth and final phase, as Baker stated, will be when a COVID-19 vaccine allows resumption of a new normal. In any of the first three phases, Baker states the state may have to go back a phase, if COVID-19 starts spreading again. Governor Baker stated that more details will be mentioned on May 18.\n.

These testing sites were to be open only on June 17 and June 18.\nOn June 19, many restaurants in Boston announced that they were closing permanently. They had lost money due to COVID-19 and reopening wasn't safe for many months, so these restaurants were forced to close.\nOn June 19, Massachusetts Governor Baker announced that Step 2 of Phase 2 of reopening in Massachusetts was to begin on June 22. This change came as Governor Baker stated that the trends of COVID-19 statewide have been positive. This will allow indoor dining, nail salons, and tanning salons to begin opening.

Movie theaters, museums, and sports were allowed to resume. However, social distancing restrictions were to remain in place, with 40% capacity limits on movie theaters and gyms. Masks were also to remain mandatory in all public places.\nOn July 7, Mayor Walsh stated in a press conference that Boston may be the first city to truly recover from COVID-19.

The originally exempt states were Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, Hawaii, New Jersey, and New York. For a state to be exempt, the seven-day average of daily cases was required to be less than six per 100,000, and the positive test rate was required to be less than five percent. This order was to be punishable by a $500 fine for each day a traveler was not following the order.\nAugust\nAugust 1–10\nOn August 1, Mayor Walsh announced that Boston Public Schools would not return to 100% in-person learning even if in-class learning would resume in the fall.

The state was to postpone Step 2 of Phase 3 of reopening indefinitely.\nAugust 11–20\nIn mid-August, the Boston Teachers Union began a series of actions pushing for a fully remote start to the beginning of the Boston Public Schools school year. The union released a plan, stating the schools reopening criteria. These requirements include widely-accessible testing, surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation in schools, in addition to a low community transmission rate in Boston. BPS had already given parents the option to have children learn 100% remotely, with the default plan being a hybrid of in-person and virtual learning. The union had planned a car caravan and socially-distanced rally on August 13 to address the plan to Mayor Walsh.\nOn August 18, Mayor Walsh stated in a press conference that encouraging trends in COVID-19 in Boston had resumed, but urged residents to remain vigilant. “The uptick that we saw in the second half of July has leveled off,” Mayor Walsh stated during his coronavirus briefing. He said that the weekly positive test rate for the week ending August 10 was 2.6%, down from 2.8% the previous week.\nOn August 19, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced that all children aged six months and older would need to receive a flu vaccine by December 31, 2020, in order to attend childcare, K–12 schools, and colleges and universities in the state. There is an allowance for medical or religious exemptions, and homeschooled K–12 students or higher education students who are not going on campus will not be required to receive the vaccination. This spurred some protests, including a rally of several hundred outside the State House on August 30, from parents and those who believed the decision was governmental overreach.\nAugust 21–31\nto ensure social distancing]]\nOn August 21, Massachusetts Governor Baker stated in a press conference that schools should be able to reopen in low-risk communities. After the Boston Teachers Union's rally, Governor Baker provided evidence that schools should be able to reopen in low-risk communities across the state. He cited a low prevalence in 90% of communities in the state. He said he could not \"imagine a reason not to go back\" in lower-risk areas.\nSome colleges in Boston began moving students in to dorms in mid-August. By late-August, students were beginning to move in to on-campus housing at Boston University in Boston.\nOn August 21, Mayor Walsh announced that Boston Public Schools would begin the school year 100% remotely before transitioning into a hybrid model, after push from the Boston Teachers Union. \"On September 21st — one month from today — all students will begin with remote learning,\" he said. \"The first students will not return to our classrooms until October 1st.\" The BPS superintendent and Mayor Walsh formed a 4-phase return to a hybrid model. On October 1, the students with the highest needs were to return. On October 15 and 19, K0, K1, and K2 students were to return. On October 22 and 26, grades 1–3 were to go back to the classroom. On November 5 and 9, grades 4–8 were to return to the classroom. On November 16 and 19, grades 9–12 were to return.\nSeptember\nSeptember 1–10\nBy early September, some Boston universities had received media attention when students disregarded social distancing rules imposed by the schools. Northeastern University announced on September 4 that they had dismissed eleven students caught violating social distancing rules within a day or two of many students moving in. Northeastern reported they would not be reimbursing the students' tuition or housing payments.\nOn September 10, Governor Baker said he \"couldn't imagine a reason\" to not go back to in-person or hybrid learning in the state's green and white communities in terms of spread in COVID-19. However, he has been encouraging communities in the yellow and red zones to stick with remote learning. He noted that not all cities and towns were following that guidance. Communities in the red zone, such as Chatham, had begun or were planning to resume in-person learning. Governor Baker instructed the town to continue remote learning.\nSeptember 11–20\nOn September 11, testing for COVID-19 at Orig3n, a Boston lab, was suspended after 383 false positives were recorded. In response, Massachusetts Department of Public Health and BPHC gave the lab until September 14 to write a plan of correction in order to resume testing.\nBy mid-September, Boston College began seeing a significant spike in COVID-19 cases. About a dozen cases in August had turned into an outbreak in the swimming teams at the college. Mayor Walsh said this outbreak is a \"serious matter\" and that he had been communicating with state officials. Also, Boston officials asked BC to begin contact tracing. The college was reported to have agreed.\nOn September 15, Massachusetts Governor Baker announced a plan to \"re-engage\" colleges on testing, contact tracing, in response to the Boston College outbreak. He said his administration was reviewing all the protocols for testing, tracing, quarantine, and isolation in colleges across the state. Baker also responded to outbreaks within high schools across the state and instructed those communities to go back to remote learning. Boston Mayor Walsh also said he will meet with college leaders in the City of Boston on September 16 to address the issue to them.\nSeptember 21–30\nOn September 29, Governor Baker announced that communities in the state classified by the state as \"lower risk\" would be allowed to move into Step 2 of Phase 3 of the state's reopening plan beginning on October 5. This step was to include allowing both indoor and outdoor performance venues to open at 50% capacity (up to 250 people); fitting rooms to open in retail stores; and gyms, museums, libraries, and driving and flight schools to increase capacity to 50%. At the time, Boston had been considered a \"red zone\" community, meaning they were to remain at Step 1 of Phase 3 of reopening. Mayor Walsh warned the public in late September that Boston was approaching red zone in terms of COVID-19. Not long after, the state classified Boston as a red zone community.\nOn September 29, Boston University published a weekly report for positive COVID-19 test results. The week before, positive test results were lower. In that week, a greater number of students, faculty, and staff tested positive. A total of 0.05% of students, 0.07% of faculty, and 0.24% of staff had tested positive.\nOctober\nOctober 1–10\nThe Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education announced on October 2 that they would begin providing weekly reports on the number of COVID-19 cases detected in schools. In the first report, covering the period from September 24 to September 30, 63 cases were found among students and 34 among staff. Student cases were spread across 41 districts.\nOn October 6, researchers in Boston launched a large COVID-19 testing study that will warn of a second wave of the virus. This study from Brigham and Women's Hospital will need 10,000 people to participate in this project, which will last six months. They are attempting to find active cases throughout the Greater Boston area. Participants will need to take monthly molecular and antibody tests at home. They hope to improve testing and contact tracing in the possible wake of a second wave.\nOn October 7, Boston delayed the next phase of in-person learning in Boston Public Schools, in response to an uptick in cases. The positive test rate in the city had increased to 4.1%, prompting city officials to put a pause on moving forward with in-person learning. High-needs students were to continue in-person learning. Both Boston officials and the Boston Teachers Union agreed with this decision. They plan to keep the remainder of the phases the same, over the course of October and November.\nOn October 8, Boston College announced that they were cancelling 5 field hockey games after a player contracted the virus. This prompted all other team players to go through a process of contact tracing. Once done, they were ordered to quarantine for 14 days.\nOctober 11–16\nOn October 11, a New England Patriots facility was shut down after a player tested positive for the virus. The team was supposed to play Denver on Monday, but the game was postponed. ESPN reported that this was the team's fourth case within 8 days.\nOn October 13, Boston Logan International Airport announced that they would begin offering COVID-19 testing beginning in November. The testing facility was to be set up in Terminal E, offering three types of tests. The facility was to offer a rapid molecular test for $200, a PCR test for $75, and a Blood Antibody test for $75.\nOn October 15, Boston Mayor Walsh announced new COVID-19 enforcement measures in the city amidst a spike in cases. He said that too many violations of COVID-19 restrictions and safety rules have led him to this decision. He mentioned a plan to tighten gathering limits, restrictions on public events, and activities in parks. Walsh stated he was considering fines for violations of these new safety rules. On Wednesday, he partnered with Whittier Street Health Center to open a second mobile testing facility in Nubian Square.\nOn October 16, Massachusetts state officials loosened travel restrictions amid an uptick in cases. The state changed the threshold for being a lower-risk state to 10 cases per 100,000 people, in a seven-day rolling average. States below that, and a 5% test rate on a 7-day moving average, were to be exempt from the travel order laid out in July. State officials said this would put Massachusetts on standard with other states' COVID-19 travel restrictions. This change added California, Hawaii, New Jersey, and Washington to the list of exempt states.\nOn October 16, Boston further delayed Phase 3 of in-person learning to October 29. A week ago, Phase 3 had been postponed to October 22 by Mayor Walsh and the Boston Teachers Union. Mayor Walsh decided to go ahead and further delay in-person learning to October 29. This was done in response to the city's positive test rate further increasing to 4.4% in the preceding week.\n2021\nIn 2021, Boston experienced significant developments in its management of the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by vaccination rollouts, adjustments to public health measures, and a resurgence in cases due to new virus variants.\nJanuary–June 2021:\n* Vaccination Rollout: On January 4, 2021, Governor Charlie Baker announced that first responders in Massachusetts would begin receiving COVID-19 vaccinations on January 11.
