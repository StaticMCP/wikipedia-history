Fragments from Monteprandon in Italy according to the latest research (S. Graciotti) are the treatises for and against the faith of Bosnian Christians (in the vernacular).\nFragments of a \"parimejnik\" (liturgical booklet) from the late 13th and early 14th centuries (Kiev, Central Scientific Library of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, 4 sheets) could be of Bosnian origin, but it has not been determined whether their origin should be linked to the Bosnian Church, according to Herta Kuna (Kuna 1970: 98).\nResearch has shown that the number of manuscripts of the Bosnian Church was considerably higher than is known today. With the disappearance of the Bosnian Church, its manuscripts ceased to be in use. However, some managed to survive because they were adapted to the liturgy of the Serbian Orthodox Church (gospels: Divoš, Nikoljsko, Kopitar, Pripković, Vrutočko); some manuscripts have disappeared forever (Daničić and Belgrade Third Gospels burned down with the National Library of Belgrade on April 6, 1941, during the bombing of the city); some have been lost (Srećković Gospel). The Nikoljsko Gospel was lost and unknown for a long time, because it disappeared together with some fifty of other important books, manuscripts and charters from the old collection of the National Library of Belgrade, or were destroyed during the First World War.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders sticky-header\" style=\"line-height:1.3em; max-width:1200px\" \"\n|+ List of medieval Bosnian manuscripts\n|-\n!
