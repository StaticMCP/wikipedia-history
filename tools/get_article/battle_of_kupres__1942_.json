The Partisans launched three concentrated attacks against the garrison of 1,500 men during the nights of 11/12 August, 14 August, and 19 August. Although outnumbered, the Black Legion, Croatian Home Guard, and local militia units successfully defended the town against several Partisan brigades.\nBackground\nIn July 1942, the 2nd Proletarian Brigade moved on Kupres and, with the assistance of local Partisans, seized control over several villages in the vicinity. During the night of 4 August 1942 the Partisans attacked the town of Livno and captured it in the following days. The plan of the National Liberation Army Supreme Command, following the seizure of Livno, was to move the Proletarian Assault Brigades to Kupres, whose capture was vital for further actions in the valley of River Vrbas.\nThe battle\nYugoslav Partisans 11/12 August 1942, 13 battalions with around 2,100 men\n*2nd Proletarian Brigade\n*3rd Proletarian (Sandžak) Brigade\n*4th Proletarian (Montenegrin) Brigade\n*10th Herzegovinian Brigade\n*3rd Krajina NOP Detachment\n14 August 1942, 16 battalions with around 2,400 - 3,000 men\n*2nd Proletarian Brigade\n*3rd Proletarian (Sandžak) Brigade\n*4th Proletarian (Montenegrin) Brigade\n*10th Herzegovinian Brigade\n*1st Krajina Brigade\n*3rd Krajina NOP Detachment\n11/12 August 1942, in total around 1,400 men\n*Black Legion\n*Kupres Militia\n*XVII Ustaša Battalion\n*9th Artillery Battalion\n*9th Infantry Regiment\n*5th Gendarmerie Regiment\n14 August 1942, around 1,500 armed men\n*Black Legion\n*Kupres Militia\n*XVII Ustaša Battalion\n*9th Artillery Battalion\n*9th Infantry Regiment\n*5th Gendarmerie Regiment\n*14th Infantry Regiment\nReferences\n*"
