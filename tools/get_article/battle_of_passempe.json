It was fought between the Gowa Sultanate and its allies led by Karaeng Cenrana as the head of the expedition, and rebellious vassal of Boné led by La Tenriaji. The event took place from 18 April to 25 May 1646, resulted in Gowa's victory against Boné.\nBackground\nIn 1611, Boné was invaded by the Sultanate of Gowa in a war, and pressured to convert to Islam. Boné State later enjoyed a period of prosperity in the middle of the 17th century.\nDuring the reign of King La Maddaremmeng, who ruled from 1626 to 1643, he enforced stricter Islamic teachings in Boné, without considering the contextual adaptation of the kingdom's environment at that time. He issued a policy not to employ slaves (ata), because he considered that all Muslims were free people — all slaves must be freed or given wages for their hard work, except for slaves who were inherited.\nBut there was opposition from the nobles led by his own mother, Datu Pattiro.  However, Maddaremmeng still wanted to enforce the policy and spread his Islamic teachings by force to neighboring areas of Boné such as Wajo, , , Massepe, and Bacukiki. Boné's neighbors interpreted this movement in terms of political rivalry. Boné nobles and Maddaremmeng's mother asked for help to Malikussaid to fought against Maddaremmeng.\nFirst Battle of Passempe\nMalikussaid, the ruler of Gowa, quickly responded to the events by sending his envoy who brought a letter for Maddaremmeng, but he did not reply to the letter.  Malikussaid was furious, he prepared to go to war against Boné. The first battle of Passempe took place on 8 October 1643,}} Boné was defeated by Gowa which was assisted by Wajo and Soppeng troops, and more than 30,000 Bugis were taken prisoner. Maddaremmeng and his brother La Tenriaji fled to Larompong in southern Luwu but Tenriaji managed to secretly return to Boné. After Maddaremmeng was finally defeated and forcibly brought to Gowa,}} Boné became the vassal of Gowa. On November 1643, they replaced the deposed Boné ruler with a Boné noble appointed by the Makassar, I Tobala, but the people of Boné appointed Maddaremmeng's younger brother, La Tenriaji as the new ruler of Boné without the knowledge of the ruler of Gowa.\nBattle\nAfter La Tenriaji appointed as the new ruler of Boné by the people of Boné, he raised an army to go to revolt against Gowa. Upon hearing the news of the development, Malikussaid launched an expedition against Boné to crush a resistance led by Tenriaji.\nTenriaji's movement was supported by La Tenritatta family of , Arung Palakka's family. Malikussaid began to assemble his troops again, called upon La Makkarakka (ruler of Wajo), La Basso (Luwu), and We Addang (Soppeng) to participate, and appointed Karaeng Cenrana as the head of the expedition. After learning that the Gowa-led troops were on their way to enter Boné, Tenriaji mobilized his troops to , a hilly area not far from Watampone and very ideal to be used as a defense base. Finally, a fierce battle took place in Passempe which was written in Lontara Bilang as Bundu’ka ri Passempe’ (Battle in Passempe). But once again, Boné was defeated by Gowa which was assisted by Wajo, Luwu, and Soppeng forces. La Tenriaji became a prisoner of war including Arung Kung and Daeng Pabila. Members of the La Tenritatta including Arung Palakka were either taken hostage or became the prisoner of war; and made servants in the palace of Karaeng Pattingalloang.\nAftermath\nAfter the defeat of Boné rebel forces led by La Tenriaji in , Boné's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i. e. colony) by Gowa.}} the complete smashing of the insence-holder, the total enslavement of the land of Boné by Goa.\"'' }} To prevent rebellion, all the Boné nobles were exiled to Gowa. Since 1644, when Boné was still a Gowa's vassal, Jennang (supervisor) was placed who then appeared again in 1646, whose duty was to supervise Boné so that there would be no more disturbing resistance. If there were nobles who dared to oppose, they would be taken to Makassar to be forced to work on the construction of the forts. After the victory of the Gowa-led forces, ruler of Wajo, Luwu, and  gathering in Baruga Baliya to reaffirm the Treaty of Topaceddo, which is called Singkerru Patolae in Bugis. In that treaty, Wajo recaptures areas from Boné which it considered its own, such as Timurung, Amali, Mampu, Sailong, Bunne, and Pammana. Rather than following the custom of retaining conquered rulers or members of local royal families as vassal, Gowa chose to appoint a kali (regent), a move that sparked discontent and eventually culminated in dramatic events two decades later.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
