It is based in the city of Townsville and is a founding member of the national body, Broomball Australia.\nThe NQBA is a not-for-profit organisation that was formed in 1992, the third incorporated broomball club in Australia after the Broomball Association of South Australia and Australian Capital Territory Broomball Association.  Broomball had been played in Townsville since the late 1980s.\nAs at August 2006 the club has around 120 members, both male and female, ranging in age from 8 to 70.  Three divisions are played in local competition: A Grade (elite), B Grade (intermediate), and C Grade (social, beginners and juniors).  Training sessions are also run from time to time.\nAll local competition games are played at the Warrina Ice Rink in the Townsville suburb of Currajong.\nThe organisation is run by an Executive Committee consisting of seven members.  All administrators and officials within the association are also current players.\nThe NQBA represents the state of Queensland at the annual Australian National Broomball Championships; the state representative squad is the Queensland Cyclones.\nSeasons\nAs of 2006, the NQBA runs two playing seasons per year, called the Summer and Winter seasons.  The summer season generally runs between January and June, while the winter season operates between July and December.\nChampions\nEach season there is a round robin competition, where every team in each division plays against each other an equal number of times.  At the end of the round robin season, the final standings are used to determine those teams that qualify for the play-offs (or finals).  The winners of the play-offs are crowned champions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table of NQBA Champions by season\n|-\n! Season\n! A Grade Champion\n! B Grade Champion\n!
