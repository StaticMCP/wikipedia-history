It occurred near the village of Morales which is in the vicinity of Toro, Zamora in Spain. General Digeon commanded the French cavalry and Colonel Grant the British hussars, although Major George Robarts was the one who gave the order to charge.\nConsidered a victory for the British, the French cavalry then retreated upon their own retreating infantry and the British cavalry without infantry support were unable to continue the attack.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
