He left the club at the end of the 2013–14 season, after becoming manager of Linfield.\nReturn to playing\nFollowing the end of his professional career, Feeney often featured in games for charity organisation the Argyle Legends, a side made up of players all with a link to Plymouth Argyle.\nIn January 2019, Feeney represented Northern Ireland at the 2019 Star Sixes tournament.
