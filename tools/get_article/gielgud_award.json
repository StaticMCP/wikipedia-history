Andrews, OBE. The award is named in honor of the English actor Sir John Gielgud.\nBackground\nThe Gielgud Award was created in April 1994 at a ceremony at the Folger Shakespeare Library on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The ceremony contained speeches by Robert MacNeil, Tony Randall, and Susan Stamberg, who read a letter that Sir John had written for the occasion. It was announced that the award would, according to the Shakespeare Guild website, \"preserve the heritage of Sir John Gielgud and pay tribute to the actors, directors, producers, and writers who are doing the most to perpetuate his legacy and that of the poet whose work he did so much to convey to succeeding generations of Shakespeare enthusiasts.\" The award was first presented in 1996 and has been given sporadically ever since.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
