Perry's Home Squadron extended its blockade of Mexico's eastern ports to include Tuxpan and Tabasco, more commonly known as Villahermosa. Perry's Mosquito Fleet carrying a landing force of 1,519 men and four pieces of artillery, reached the mouth of the Tuxpan River on 17 April. The Mexicans had five batteries with eight guns each, and about 400 men under the command of General Martin Perfecto de Cos, along the six mile approach to the town.\nBattle\nOn 18 April, Perry's crafts towed 30 barges upriver, and secured two downriver fortifications and those at the edge of town by 3 PM. The town surrendered by 4 PM, when Perry removed the guns and destroyed the fortifications before evacuating the town on 22 April, keeping a pair of craft to blockade the river.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Nevin, David; editor, The Mexican War (1978)\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130701203240/http://www.dmwv.org/honoring/naval.htm Roll of Honor - U.S. Casualties of Naval Actions in the War with Mexico]"
