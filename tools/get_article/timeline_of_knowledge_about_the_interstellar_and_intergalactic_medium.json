The telescope is much larger than the small refactors typical of this period and it also reveals the spiral nature of M51.\n* 1864 – William Huggins studies the spectrum of the Orion Nebula and shows that it is a cloud of gas.\n* 1904 – Interstellar calcium detected on spectrograph at Potsdam.\n* 1909 – Slipher confirms Kapteyn's theory of interstellar gas.\n* 1912 – Slipher confirms interstellar dust.\n* 1927 – Ira Bowen explains unidentified spectral lines from space as forbidden transition lines.\n* 1930 – Robert Trumpler discovers absorption by interstellar dust by comparing the angular sizes and brightnesses of globular clusters.\n* 1944 – Hendrik van de Hulst predicts the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral interstellar hydrogen.\n* 1951 – Harold I. Ewen and Edward Purcell observe the 21&nbsp;cm hyperfine line of neutral interstellar hydrogen.\n* 1956 – Lyman Spitzer predicts coronal gas around the Milky Way.\n* 1965 – James Gunn and Bruce Peterson use observations of the relatively low absorption of the blue component of the Lyman-alpha line from 3C9 to strongly constrain the density and ionization state of the intergalactic medium.\n* 1969 – Lewis Snyder, David Buhl, Ben Zuckerman, and Patrick Palmer find interstellar formaldehyde.\n* 1970\n** Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson find interstellar carbon monoxide.\n}}"
