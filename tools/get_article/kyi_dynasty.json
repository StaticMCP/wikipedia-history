Then the Khazars came upon them as they lived in the hills and forests, and demanded tribute from them'}}. In pages 20.24–21.3, Askold and Dir are told by the inhabitants: \"There were three brothers, Kyi, Shchek, and Khoriv, who had once built this city. They died, and we, their descendants, are living here, and paying tribute to the Khazars.'\nM. Braychevskyi's hypothesis\nM. Braichevsky's hypothesis is based on the rather popular in Soviet science identification of Kyi with Quar Zenob Glack and Kuver Byzantine chronicles.\nThe dating of Kyi's life and activity will be acceptable, as will the identification of Kyi with Quar. Kuver's connection with Kyiv is doubtful, the former is now mostly associated with the Proto-Bulgarians.\nKhorezmian hypothesis of V. Toporov\nV. Toporov, without directly touching on the topic of the Kyivan dynasty, presented his own hypothesis about the origin of the toponym \"Kyiv\" (advocated by the late Omeljan Pritsak), namely:\nThat is, according to V. Toporov, he believes the Kyiv dynasty did not exist, the name of Kyiv comes from the name of the leader of the Khorezmian army, which was in the service of the Khazars.\nPlace of Askold and Dir\nSome writers have claimed that Askold and Dir belonged to the Kyi dynasty. The 15th-century Polish chronicler Jan Długosz wrote: 'Later, after the deaths of Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, their sons and descendants inherited from the Kyivan Rus' for many years, until such descendants led to two brothers - Oskald and Dir.' This claim has not been taken seriously by most modern scholars. In his 2006 book Origins of the Slavic Nations, Serhii Plokhy paraphrased the Primary Chronicle as saying that 'the Polianians had their own ruling dynasty established by the three brothers Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv, who founded the city of Kyiv. (...) Once the Kyi dynasty died out, the Polianians paid tribute to the Khazars. Then they were ruled by the Varangian warriors Askold and Dir' (...). If there had been any dynasty, it had long gone extinct by the time Askold and Dir arrived, who were Varangians and not local Polianians. In his 2017 book The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine, however, Plokhy no longer mentions Kyi and his siblings, relegating them to the realm of legend.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nPrimary sources\n*  (First edition published in 1930.
