The name change came on 6 June 1981 as an attempt to distance itself from its policies of the past.\nOn 23 July 1984 it was renamed the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe. At that time the party, which had started with an all-white membership, tried to appeal to black members, as well as black voters who wished to oppose the policies of the Robert Mugabe government.\nReferences"
