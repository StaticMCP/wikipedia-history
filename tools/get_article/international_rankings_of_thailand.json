If streets form a tight grid, routes are shorter, walking is more convenient, and investing in public transit is more attractive to municipal governments. Researchers created the Street-Network Disconnectedness Index (SNDi). Cites with large numbers of dead ends or great distances between intersections were judged to exhibit more \"sprawl\". More sprawl results in more inefficient transport options and therefore more carbon emissions. Bangkok was identified as the world city exhibiting the most sprawl. Cebu in the Philippines and Palembang in Indonesia were ranked three and six on the top ten list.\nSurveillance\n* Comparitech Limited, a UK technology advisor, published \"The world's most-surveilled cities\" in August 2019.

China's cities were found to be the most surveilled. Bangkok was ranked 31 (1=most surveilled; 120=least surveilled), with an estimated 53,429 cameras installed, or 5.16 cameras per 1,000 inhabitants.

Other ASEAN cities ranked were Singapore, 2; Kuala Lumpur, 55; Hanoi, 87; Jakarta, 88; and Manila, 96.\nSustainable development\n* The Sustainable Development Index (SDI) measures the ecological efficiency of human development. Its impetus was a reaction to the UN's Human Development Index (HDI) which measures various indicators of development, but does not assess the sustainability of those underlying indicators. Countries with high human development and low ecological impact rise to the top of the SDI. Countries with low human development, and countries with high human development but high ecological impact, fall to the bottom of the SDI. The latest iteration of the index (2020) uses data from 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. In this ranking of 163 nations, Thailand ranked 44. Other ASEAN nations were ranked: Philippines, 26; Indonesia, 30; Vietnam, 42; Laos, 66; Cambodia, 77; Myanmar, 79; Malaysia, 109; Brunei, 139; and Singapore, lowest of all nations at 163.\nTalent\n* Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) 2018: The report analyses the performance of 119 countries and 90 cities worldwide based on six factors: enabling talent, attracting talent, growing talent, retaining talent, vocational and technical skills, and global knowledge skills.
