In both Canada and the United States, the \"wind chill warning\" has been replaced with the \"extreme cold warning.\"\nExtreme wind chills meeting wind chill warning criteria can generate a significant decrease in body temperature, and induce frostbite damage to exposed skin and other tissue over an accelerated period of time (onset within as little as 10 to 15 minutes in severe cases). People within the warned area are advised to avoid venturing outdoors unless conducting necessary travel; if going outside, extra precaution should be taken against the likelihood of developing hypothermia and frostbite by wearing multiple layers of clothing (such as a thick winter coat, a scarf and long underwear, in addition to layers of outerwear) as well as a hat (e.g., a knit cap that can be used to cover the ears) and gloves.\nIn the United States, the exact definition varies from state to state or between National Weather Service county warning areas (with the highest criteria in the Upper Midwest and Alaska, and the lowest criteria in the Florida Peninsula), and a warning is used to express more severe conditions than a wind chill advisory. If extreme wind chills are expected to quickly lead to frostbite or death, then enhanced wording with the words particularly dangerous situation may be added to the text; this is rarely issued. The National Weather Service in Twin Cities/Chanhassen was the first office to do this on January 5, 2014.\nOn April 8, 2014, Environment Canada replaced the Wind Chill Warning with an Extreme Cold Warning. The warning is still issued based on a region's normal climate. In the older system, a wind chill warning for Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada was issued when the wind chill dropped to . This meant that if the temperature was  with no wind a warning was not issued. Under the new system the extreme cold warning is issued based on either the temperature or the wind chill being a certain value for at least two hours. The values range from  in the south to  in parts of the Arctic.\nIn the United States, the \"wind chill watch\" and \"wind chill warning\" were eliminated in favor of a \"simplified\" naming scheme, with \"wind chill warning\" becoming \"extreme cold warning.\"\nSample Wind Chill Warning\nThe following is an example of a Wind Chill Warning issued by the National Weather Service office in Burlington, Vermont on February 1, 2023.\n983\nWWUS41 KBTV 012017\nWSWBTV\nURGENT - WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE\nNational Weather Service Burlington VT\n317 PM EST Wed Feb 1 2023\nNYZ026>031-034-035-087-VTZ001>011-016>021-021000-\n/O.UPG.KBTV.WC.A.0001.230203T0600Z-230205T0000Z/\n/O.NEW.KBTV.WC.W.0001.230203T0600Z-230204T1800Z/\nNorthern St. Lawrence-Northern Franklin-Eastern Clinton-\nSoutheastern St. Lawrence-Southern Franklin-Western Clinton-\nWestern Essex-Eastern Essex-Southwestern St. Lawrence-Grand Isle-\nWestern Franklin-Orleans-Essex-Western Chittenden-Lamoille-\nCaledonia-Washington-Western Addison-Orange-Western Rutland-\nEastern Franklin-Eastern Chittenden-Eastern Addison-\nEastern Rutland-Western Windsor-Eastern Windsor-\nIncluding the cities of Massena, Norfolk, Fort Covington, Malone,\nChamplain, Plattsburgh, South Colton, Star Lake, Saranac Lake,\nTupper Lake, Dannemora, Ellenburg, Lake Placid, Newcomb,\nPort Henry, Ticonderoga, Ogdensburg, Potsdam, Gouverneur,\nAlburgh, South Hero, St. Albans, Swanton, Derby, Newport,\nIsland Pond, Lunenburg, Burlington, Shelburne, Johnson, Stowe,\nHardwick, St. Johnsbury, Montpelier, Waitsfield, Middlebury,\nVergennes, Bradford, Randolph, Fair Haven, Rutland,\nEnosburg Falls, Richford, Richmond, Underhill, Bristol, Ripton,\nEast Wallingford, Killington, Bethel, Ludlow, Springfield,\nand White River Junction\n317 PM EST Wed Feb 1 2023\n...WIND CHILL WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM FRIDAY TO 1 PM EST\nSATURDAY...\n* WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills expected.
