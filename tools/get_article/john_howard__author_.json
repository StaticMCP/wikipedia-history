His fiction has appeared in anthologies, magazines, and the collections The Silver Voices, Written by Daylight, Cities and Thrones and Powers, and Buried Shadows. The majority of Howard's stories have central and eastern European settings; many are set in the fictional Romanian town of Steaua de Munte. The Defeat of Grief is a novella set in Steaua de Munte and the real Black Sea resort of Balcic; the novellas \"The Fatal Vision\" (in Cities and Thrones and Powers) and The Lustre of Time form part of an ongoing series with Steaua de Munte architect and academic Cristian Luca as protagonist. Numbered as Sand or the Stars attempts a 'secret history' of Hungary between the World Wars.\nJohn Howard has published three collections jointly written with Mark Valentine. Secret Europe comprises 25 short stories set in a variety of real and fictional European locations. Ten of the stories are by Howard and fifteen by Valentine. The expanded edition published in 2014 added an introduction and an extra story by Mark Valentine. Inner Europe (2018) is in the same vein, and comprises six stories by Howard and seven by Valentine. Powers and Presences (2020), This World and That Other (2022), and Possessions and Pursuits (2023) are tributes to the 'theological thrillers' of Charles Williams.\nHoward contributed a story to Dreams of Ourselves, an anthology published in tribute to the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa. Contributors and editor used Pessoa heteronyms, with the authors' names only revealed in the sealed envelope supplied with each copy of the book.\nSince 2003 John Howard has occasionally collaborated on short stories with Mark Valentine. Seven have featured Valentine's long-running series character The Connoisseur, an occult detective whose real name is never revealed. All tales of The Connoisseur then extant, including the collaborations, were reprinted in The Collected Connoisseur (Tartarus Press, 2010).\nJohn Howard has written essays for numerous magazines including Book and Magazine Collector, Supernatural Tales, Wormwood, Studies in Australian Weird Fiction, and All Hallows for the Ghost Story Society. He contributed essays to the Fritz Leiber special issue of Fantasy Commentator (No. 57/58, 2004) and to the books Black Prometheus: A Critical Study of Karl Edward Wagner (Gothic Press, 2007), Fritz Leiber: Critical Essays (McFarlane, 2008), and The Man Who Collected Psychos: Critical Essays on Robert Bloch (McFarlane, 2009), all edited by Benjamin Szumskyj. Most of these essays were included in Touchstones: Essays on the Fantastic (2014), which was a British Fantasy Award nominee the following year. In 2013 Howard took over the review column Camera Obscura in Tartarus Press' journal Wormwood, which he conducted until it ceased publication in 2022.\nBibliography\nBooks: Story collections and novellas\n*The Rite of Trebizond and Other Tales (with Mark Valentine), Bucharest: Ex Occidente Press 2008\n*The Collected Connoisseur (with Mark Valentine), Leyburn: Tartarus Press 2010; 2019 (expanded edition)\n*The Silver Voices, Bucharest: Ex Occidente Press 2010; Dublin: Swan River Press 2014 (new edition); paperback 2022\n*The Defeat of Grief, Bucharest: Passport Levant 2010\n*Secret Europe, Bucharest: Exposition Internationale 2012; Leyburn: Tartarus Press 2014 (expanded edition); paperback 2019\n*Numbered as Sand or the Stars, Bucharest: Exposition Internationale 2012\n*Written by Daylight, Dublin: Swan River Press 2013; paperback 2024\n*Cities and Thrones and Powers, Bucharest: Les Editions de l'Oubli 2013\n*The Lustre of Time, Bucharest: L’Homme Récent 2015\n*Visit of a Ghost, Bucharest: Mount Abraxas 2017\n*Buried Shadows, Shaftesbury: Egaeus Press 2017\n*Inner Europe, Leyburn: Tartarus Press 2018; paperback 2020\n*A Flowering Wound, Dublin: Swan River Press 2019; paperback 2024\n*The Voice of the Air, Shaftesbury: Egaeus Press 2020\n*The Tattered Shadows, (with Mark Valentine), Sao Paulo: Raphus Press 2020 (includes Restos de Sombra, a translation into Portuguese by Fabio Waki); new edition 2024\n*Offshore, Sao Paulo: Raphus Press 2020 (includes Alem-Mar, a translation into Portuguese by Fabio Waki)\n*Powers and Presences, Neuilly-le-Vendin: Sarob Press 2020\n*This World and That Other, Neuilly-le-Vendin: Sarob Press 2022\n*Possessions and Pursuits, Neuilly-le-Vendin: Sarob Press 2023\nBooks: Nonfiction\n*''The Emperor's Pavement: Pages from a Berlin Daybook'', Bucharest: Les Editions de l'Oubli 2013\n*Touchstones: Essays on the Fantastic, Cheadle: Alchemy Press 2014\nOther formats\n*The House of the Sun, Kildwick: Mark Valentine 2005 (chapbook)\n*Leaves of Ash, Kildwick: Valentine & Valentine 2015 (miniature Coptic-stitched concertina book cased in boards and concealed in a ‘matchbox’)\n*New Adelphi, Duesseldorf: Zagava 2021 (hand-sewn chapbook printed on hand-made cotton rag paper)\n*W, Duesseldorf: Zagava 2023 (hand-sewn chapbook printed on hand-made cotton rag paper)\n*The Emissaries, Duesseldorf: Zagava 2024 (hand-sewn chapbook printed on hand-made cotton rag paper)\nStories first published in anthologies and magazines\n*‘Where Once I Did My Love Beguile’ in Beneath the Ground edited by Joel Lane, Alchemy Press 2003\n*Portrait in an Unfaded Photograph in ''Cinnabar's Gnosis: A Homage to Gustav Meyrink edited by D.T.
