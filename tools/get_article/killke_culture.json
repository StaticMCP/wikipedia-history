Archaeologist Oscar Rodriguez suggests that the Killke built small sections of the fortress Saksaywaman during the 12th century, prior to the Incan expansion of the site.\nIn 2007, excavations uncovered a temple on the edge of the fortress, indicating religious as well as military use of the site.[http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&fn=/2008/03/14/911994.html NEWS - Comcast.net]\nJohn H. Rowe first described killke ceramics. These vessels are often globular with vertical strap handles and have simple linear geometric decorations of black or black-on-red over a white or buff slip.\nIt was the American archaeologist John Howland Rowe (1918–2004) who named the Killke culture.\nSee also\n*Wari culture\n*History of the Incas\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Dwyer, E.
