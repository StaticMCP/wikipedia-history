Since completing his post-doctoral research, he has held the position of Honorary Fellow in Sociology at the University of Edinburgh.\nPreviously, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Edinburgh (2020–2023) and a Research Associate at the Centre for Social Justice and Governance at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai (2011–2016).\nPolicy consultation\nBhoi has worked extensively with national policy and research bodies within the Government of India. He served as a Researcher and Policy Analyst for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) in 2020 and as a Consultant for the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) from 2018 to 2019, where he provided input on the New Education Policy Draft.\nHis other roles include serving as a Consultant for the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA), and as a Social Scientist at the Indian Social Institute, New Delhi. In these capacities, he contributed to drafting multiple national and state-level reports on education equity issues.\nInvited talks and academic activities\nBhoi frequently presents his research at major academic institutions and international conferences. His book, Caste in Everyday Life, has been the subject of several academic events at leading universities. In June 2024, the book was launched at an event at the London School of Economics (LSE). This was followed by book talks at King's College London in February 2025 and at Stanford University's Center for South Asia in February 2025.\nIn June 2024, he delivered a talk on Indian caste dynamics at an event hosted at the University of Oxford. He is also scheduled to lead a session on race and mental health at the International Sociological Association (ISA) Conference in Morocco in July 2025.\nResearch themes\nBhoi's research primarily investigates the intersections of social stratification, education, and mental well-being, with a particular focus on marginalised communities in India. A central theme in his work is the concept of caste in everyday life, where he moves beyond structural analysis to explore the psycho-social and emotional experiences—or \"affect\"—of caste discrimination. His scholarship frequently examines the barriers Dalit and Adivasi students face in accessing higher education, and how neo-liberal policies of privatisation have impacted educational equity. Furthermore, Bhoi connects these sociological inquiries to public health, analysing how experiences of stigma and humiliation can shape mental health and overall well-being.\nAwards and recognition\n* British Sociological Association (BSA) Research Event Grant, awarded to fund a workshop on \"Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education.\"\n* Dr. Ambedkar International Centre Fellow Award (2020–2023), from the Government of India.\n* Dr. Ambedkar Foundation’s Study Tour Grant (2015–2016), from the University Grants Commission, New Delhi.\n* Multiple travel and conference grants from institutions including the International Institute of Social Studies (The Hague) and the International Sociological Association.\nPublications\nBhoi has published on topics of caste, education, and the psycho-social experiences of marginalized communities.\nBooks\n*\nHe has several forthcoming books, including Performing Caste, Sensory Experience, and Everyday Sociality (Routledge) and Educational Privatisation, Higher Education and Dalits in Academics (Routledge).\nSelected articles and book chapters\n* Bhoi, D. & Lakra, N.
