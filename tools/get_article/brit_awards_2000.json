However, it was short-lived and the two parties regularly traded insults in the press with Noel Gallagher referring to Williams as \"the fat dancer from Take That\". Having won Best British Single and Best Video for \"She's the One\", Williams challenged Liam Gallagher to a televised fight, saying: \"So, anybody like to see me fight Liam? Would you pay to come and see it? Liam, a hundred grand of your money and a hundred grand of my money. We'll get in a ring and we'll have a fight and you can all watch it on TV, what d'you think about that?\". Liam Gallagher was not in the country at the time.\nRonnie Wood and Brandon Block\nDance DJ Brandon Block was told by his friends that he had won an award and had been summoned to the stage to collect it. Because of his advanced state of intoxication he believed them and walked on to the stage, eventually ending up next to a bemused Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and actress Thora Birch, who were about to present the award for Best Soundtrack Album. After Block was removed from the stage by security, Wood aimed an insult in his direction, at which Block broke free to square up to the guitarist. A series of insults were then traded between the two, both of which were audible through the stage microphone, causing claims that the whole event may have been staged. Wood then threw his drink into Block's face, and the DJ was ejected from the event. Some time after the incident, Block claimed that he had subsequently apologised to Wood for his behaviour, and Wood had merely brushed it off.\nGeri Halliwell and the Spice Girls\nThe Spice Girls were set to receive the Outstanding Contribution award at the 2000 Brit awards, reportedly to mark their dominance of the music scene in the past decade. There was much media speculation before and even during the event as to whether or not former Ginger Spice, Geri Halliwell would accept the award with the four remaining members of the group. On the night, however, Halliwell declined to join her former bandmates and instead ensured front-page coverage the following day by performing her solo single \"Bag It Up\" straddling a pole between a pair of giant inflatable legs. Near the end of the awards, the Spice Girls performed \"Spice Up Your Life\", an a cappella version of \"Say You'll Be There\", \"Holler\" and \"Goodbye\". When the group accepted their award for \"Outstanding Contribution To Music\", they thanked Geri Halliwell for her part in the band's success.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2000 Brit Awards 2000 at Brits.co.uk]"
