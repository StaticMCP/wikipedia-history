Inputs used in the calculation are the type of chromophores present, the auxochromes (substituents on the chromophores, and solvent. Examples are conjugated carbonyl compounds, conjugated dienes, and polyenes.\nImplementation\nOne set of Woodward–Fieser rules for dienes is outlined in table 1. A diene is either homoannular with both double bonds contained in one ring or heteroannular' with two double bonds distributed between two rings.\n{|align=\"center\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n!Structural feature !! λmax effect (in nanometers)\n|-\n|   Base value for heteroannular diene   ||  214\n|-\n|   Base value for homoannular diene   ||  253\n|-  Base value for acyclic dienes  || 217\n|  colspan=2    | Increments\n|-\n|   Double bond extending conjugation ||  + 30\n|-\n|   Alkyl substituent or ring residue   ||  + 5\n|-\n|   Exocyclic double bond   ||  + 5\n|-\n|   acetate group   ||  + 0\n|-\n|   Ether group   ||  + 6\n|-\n|   Thioether group   ||  + 30\n|-\n|   bromine, chlorine   ||  + 5\n|-\n|   secondary amine group   ||  + 60\n|-\n|+ Table 1.

This diene group has 4 alkyl substituents (labeled 1,2,3,4) and the double bond in one ring is exocyclic to the other (adding 5&nbsp;nm for an exocyclic double bond). In the compound on the right, the diene is homoannular with 4 alkyl substituents. Both double bonds in the central B ring are exocyclic with respect to rings A and C.\nFor polyenes having more than 4 conjugated double bonds one must use Fieser–Kuhn rules.\nReferences"
