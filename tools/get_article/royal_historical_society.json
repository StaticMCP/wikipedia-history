Until 1872 it was known as the Historical Society. In 1897, it merged with (or absorbed) the Camden Society, founded in 1838. In its origins, and for many years afterwards, the society was effectively a gentlemen's club. However, in the middle and later twentieth century the RHS took on a more active role in representing the discipline and profession of history.\nCurrent activities\nThe society exists to promote historical research in the United Kingdom and worldwide, representing historians of all kinds. Its activities primarily concern advocacy and policy research, training, publishing, grants and research support, especially for early career historians, and awards and professional recognition. It provides a varied programme of lectures and one-day and two-day conferences and symposia covering diverse historical topics. It convenes in London and from time to time elsewhere throughout the United Kingdom. Since 1967 it has been based at University College London.\nGovernance\nThe society is governed by a board of trustees called the council, which is chaired by the RHS President. The president and members of council are elected from the society's fellows. There are 22 councillors, each of whom serves a four-year term. Every year the fellowship elects three new members of council using a preferential voting system. Council members come from a wide variety of backgrounds and research interests.\nFellows and members\nThe society's membership comprises honorary vice-presidents (management), elected fellows (entitled to use FRHistS as post-nominal letters), associate fellows, and members.\nFellowships are awarded to those who have made an original contribution to historical scholarship, typically through the authorship of a book, a body of scholarly work similar in scale and impact to a book, the organisation of exhibitions and conferences, the editing of journals, and other works of diffusion and dissemination grounded in historical research. Election is conducted by review and applications must be supported by someone who is already a fellow. A list of current fellows and members is maintained online by the RHS.\nPublications\nThe society's publications include its monographic series Studies in History (1975–2020) and New Historical Perspectives (2016–), its annual Transactions (first published as Transactions of the Historical Society, 1872), and the Camden Series of editions and translations of texts; as well as digital publications, such as the Bibliography of British and Irish History.\nThe society runs an active open-access online blog, entitled Historical Transactions. It was established in 2018 as part of the commemoration of the Royal Historical Society’s 150th Anniversary.\nPrizes\nThe regular prizes, awards and recognitions granted by the society include:\n* Gladstone Book Prize\n* Whitfield Book Prize\n* The Alexander Prize\nOnly two historians have been awarded both the Whitfield Prize and the Alexander Prize:\n* A. G. Rosser – Alexander Prize (1983), Whitfield Prize (1989)\n* Ryan Hanley – Alexander Prize (2015), Whitfield Prize (2019)\nList of presidents\nThe presidents of the society have been:\n: Lucy Noakes\n}}\nSee also\n*The Historical Association\n*List of British professional bodies\n*List of Royal Societies\n*Historiography of the United Kingdom\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
