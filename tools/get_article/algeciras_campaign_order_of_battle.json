A French squadron, seeking to join the Spanish fleet and a number of French ships of the line at the Spanish Atlantic base of Cadiz, sailed from Toulon on 13 June under Counter-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois. Rounding the British naval base of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain on 4 July, Linois learned that a British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez was on station off Cadiz. Seeking to avoid battle with Saumarez's much larger force, Linois anchored in the Spanish port of Algeciras, close to Gibraltar. Saumarez discovered Linois there on 6 July and attacked at 08:30, his ships hampered by light winds and Linois's strong defensive position.\nDuring the battle, in which the French squadron was heavily supported by fire from Spanish shore batteries and gunboats, the British ship HMS Hannibal grounded and could not be refloated. Two of the French ships were also driven ashore, but the fire of the Spanish batteries and the lack of wind all contributed to Saumarez calling off the attack at 13:35, leaving Hannibal stranded and isolated. Captain Solomon Ferris was left with no option but to surrender as the remainder of the British force limped back to Gibraltar.\nLinois called on the Spanish forces in Cadiz for reinforcements and on 9 July a relief squadron was sent consisting of six ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-admiral Juan Joaquín Moreno de Mondragón. Arriving on 9 July, this force anchored in Algeciras until Linois was ready to sail on 12 July, the large combined squadron departing westwards with the wind during the evening. Saumarez followed, sending HMS Superb to attack the Spanish rearguard. During the opening stages of the second battle Superb set the 112-gun Spanish ship Real Carlos on fire and captured the French Saint Antoine. Real Carlos later drifted into the San Hermenegildo, spreading the fire to her compatriot. Both ships exploded at 00:15 on 13 July with enormous loss of life.\nThe British squadron pressed on with the attack, and at 05:15 on 13 July HMS Venerable and HMS Thames attacked the French Formidable off the Spanish coast. In a fierce engagement, Formidable brought down Venerables masts and drove the ship on shore, the French ship escaping with the rest of the squadron to Cadiz.  Venerable was later salvaged and returned to Gibraltar, while Saumarez reinstated the British blockade of Cadiz.\nFirst Battle of Algeciras\nBritish squadron\nThe British squadron was formed from the force enforcing the Cadiz blockade to ensure that the Spanish fleet stationed there did not put to sea. One ship from the squadron was absent during the battle; HMS Superb had been detached to the Guadalquivir River and, along with the frigate HMS Thames, did not reach Algeciras in time to participate, turning back to Cadiz on 6 July and observing the later movements of the combined squadron. All of the British squadron was heavily engaged, but Hannibal and Pompée, isolated at the head of the British line by calm winds, took the heaviest damage. Pompée had to be towed to safety by the boats of the squadron and Hannibal was grounded and eventually forced to surrender. Between them Pompée and Hannibal took more than half of the total British casualties. The sloop-of-war HMS Calpe attacked the French frigate Muiron. Muiron drove off Calpe.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Rear-Admiral Saumarez's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=15%; align= center rowspan=2 | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | Rate\n! scope=\"col\" width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | Guns\n! scope=\"col\" width=7%; align= center rowspan=2 | Navy\n! scope=\"col\" width=21%; align= center rowspan=2 | Commander\n! scope=\"col\" width=9%; align= center colspan=3 | Casualties\n! scope=\"col\" width=33%; align= center rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Killed\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Wounded\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Total\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | HMS Caesar\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 80\n| align= center | Royal Navy\n| align= left | Rear-Admiral Sir James SaumarezCaptain Jahleel Brenton\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Badly damaged.

The ships of the line were all heavily engaged, with Desaix and Indomptable driven ashore and Formidable also badly damaged. All three required extensive repairs before they were seaworthy. Murion was close inshore and thus only lightly damaged, but the Spanish batteries, gunboats and the town of Algeciras itself all suffered severe damage.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Counter-admiral Linois's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=15%; align= center rowspan=2 | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | Rate\n! scope=\"col\" width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | Guns\n! scope=\"col\" width=7%; align= center rowspan=2 | Navy\n! scope=\"col\" width=21%; align= center rowspan=2 | Commander\n! scope=\"col\" width=9%; align= center colspan=3 | Casualties\n! scope=\"col\" width=33%; align= center rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Killed\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Wounded\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Total\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | Formidable\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 80\n| align= center | France\n| align= left | Counter-admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand LinoisCaptain Laindet Lalonde\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Badly damaged\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | Desaix\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 74\n| align= center | France\n| align= left | Captain Christy de la Pallière\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Badly damaged and driven ashore\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | Indomptable\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 80\n| align= center | France\n| align= left | Captain Augustin Moncousu\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Badly damaged and driven ashore\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | Muiron\n| align= center | Fifth rate\n| align= center | 40\n| align= center | France\n| align= left | Captain Jules-François Martinencq\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Lightly damaged\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Spanish defences\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|The Spanish garrison of Algeciras provided 14 large gunboats and defensive positions at Bateria de San Iago (five cannon), Isla Verda (seven cannon), Fort Santa Garcia, Torre de la Vila Veija and Torre de Almirante.

Pompée was so badly damaged that Saumarez abandoned the ship in the Gibraltar dockyards and redistributed the crew throughout the squadron. The only fresh ships were Superb and Thames, which had rejoined the squadron on 10 July after shadowing the combined squadron's approach to Algeciras. In the battle, only Superb, Venerable and Thames were engaged, the other ships trailing too far behind the combined squadron to play an active role in the combat, although their presence did discourage Moreno from continuing the battle on the morning of 13 July.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"12\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Rear-Admiral Saumarez's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=15%; align= center rowspan=2 | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | Rate\n! scope=\"col\" width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | Guns\n! scope=\"col\" width=7%; align= center rowspan=2 | Navy\n! scope=\"col\" width=21%; align= center rowspan=2 | Commander\n! scope=\"col\" width=9%; align= center colspan=3 | Casualties\n! scope=\"col\" width=33%; align= center rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Killed\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Wounded\n! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Total\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | HMS Caesar\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 80\n| align= center | Royal Navy\n| align= left | Rear-Admiral Sir James SaumarezCaptain Jahleel Brenton\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Not actively engaged in combat\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | HMS Superb\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 74\n| align= center | Royal Navy\n| align= left | Captain Richard Goodwin Keats\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Heavily engaged, lightly damaged\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | HMS Spencer\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 74\n| align= center | Royal Navy\n| align= left |Captain Henry Darby\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Not actively engaged in combat\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | HMS Venerable\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 74\n| align= center | Royal Navy\n| align= left |Captain Samuel Hood\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Heavily engaged, badly damaged and driven ashore\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | HMS Audacious\n| align= center | Third rate\n| align= center | 74\n| align= center | Royal Navy\n| align= left |Captain Shuldham Peard\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Not actively engaged in combat\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | HMS Thames\n| align= center | Frigate\n| align= center | 32\n| align= center | Royal Navy\n| align= left |Captain Aiskew Hollis\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Heavily engaged, undamaged\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | Carlotta\n| align= center | Frigate\n| align= center | 48\n| align= center | Portuguese Navy\n| align= left |Captain Crawfurd Duncan\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= right |\n| align= left | Portuguese ship.

It totaled five Spanish ships of the line and four French and was much larger than its British opponent. However, all of Linois's ships were badly damaged from the first battle and the captured Hannibal was so battered that Moreno ordered it to return to Algeciras with the frigate Indienne on 12 July. Neither took any part in the battle. Much of the combined squadron was not engaged in the second battle, managing to escape Saumarez's pursuit and reach Cadiz safely. The rearguard of Rear Carlos, San Hermengildo and Saint Antoine was overwhelmed in the night however and Formidable only escaped after a fierce engagement on the Spanish coast the following morning.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Vice-Admiral Moreno's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=15%; align= center | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" width=10%; align= center | Rate\n! scope=\"col\" width=5%; align= center | Guns\n! scope=\"col\" width=7%; align= center | Navy\n! scope=\"col\" width=21%; align= center | Commander\n! scope=\"col\" width=9%; align= center | Casualties\n! scope=\"col\" width=33%; align= center | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left | Real Carlos\n| align= center | First rate\n| align= center | 112\n| align= center | Spain\n| align= left | Captain Don J.
