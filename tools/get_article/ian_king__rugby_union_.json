His primary position was fullback and it was in that role he gained three England caps in 1954, debuting in a win over Wales at Twickenham. In his second match, a loss to the All Blacks, King spent a period off the field injured, but retained his place for their next fixture against Ireland, kicking a penalty and conversion in an England win.\nSee also\n*List of England national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
