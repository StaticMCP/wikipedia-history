The Awards were not held between 2004 and 2022.\nBackground\nThe inaugural National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Sports Awards were held at Adelaide's Hilton International Hotel on 6 September 1986.  The Awards were established to pay tribute to the contribution of Aboriginal men and women to Australian and international sport. Charlie Perkins, Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, strongly supported the establishment of the Awards and obtained Australian Government funding.  The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission continued funding after the department ceased to exist. Australian business also assisted with sponsorship.\nSydney Jackson, a champion Australian rules footballer and sports administrator made the following statements regarding the establishment of the Awards:  the most exciting thing that has happened in Aboriginal sport outside individual achievement and recognition of Aboriginal sports men and women will go a long way towards encouraging you Aboriginal athletes to preserve in the development of their natural talents.  Clyde Holding, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs stated at the inaugural Awards that   'formal recognition of the big contribution made to Australian sport by Aboriginals is long overdue.\nThe inaugural Awards aimed to be a gala event replicating the ABC Sports Award of the Year and Australian Sport Awards ceremonies. Due to the costs of holding the Awards, it was proposed to hold them every two years. Until 2003 the Awards were televised by either SBS or the  ABC. Award ceremonies generally included performances by talented Aboriginal performers. David Gulpilil danced at the inaugural Awards.\nLocation and dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No!\n!Date\n!Location\n|-\n|1st||6 September 1986 ||Adelaide, South Australia\n|-\n|2nd||12 November 1988 ||Brisbane, Queensland\n|-\n|3rd||25 October 1991 ||Sydney, New South Wales\n|-\n|4th|| 3 November 1993||Melbourne, Victoria\n|-\n|5th||30 June 1995 ||Darwin, Northern Territory\n|-\n|6th||16 October 1997 ||Perth, Western Australia\n|-\n|7th||16 October 1999 ||Hobart, Tasmania\n|-\n|8th||9 November 2001 ||Sydney, New South Wales\n|-\n|9th||7 November 2003||Adelaide, South Australia\n|-\n|10th||11 November 2023||Melbourne, Victoria\n|-\n|11th||16 November 2024||Melbourne, Victoria\n|-\n|12th||15 November 2025||Brisbane, Queensland\n|}\nWinners\n1st 1986\nThe inaugural Awards recognized a high number of former Aboriginal athletes.
