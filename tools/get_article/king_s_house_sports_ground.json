King George V presided over the official opening in 1926 and inspected the teams. The first recorded cricket match on the ground was in 1926, when the Civil Service cricket team played Australia in a non first-class match. The following year, the ground held its only first-class match when the Civil Service played the touring New Zealanders. This match was also the Civil Service's only appearance in first-class cricket.\nThe ground held a single Second XI Championship match in 1973 when the Middlesex Second XI played the Kent Second XI.\nDuring the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup, the ground held its only Women's One Day International when New Zealand women played the West Indies.\nSince 2010 the Sports Ground has been managed by King's House School. The school has overseen many new developments to facilities, including a new 3G and all-weather pitch.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/415.html Civil Service Sports Ground] on CricketArchive\n*[http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/56913.html Civil Service Sports Ground] on Cricinfo"
