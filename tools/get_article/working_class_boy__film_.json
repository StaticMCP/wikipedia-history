The film looks on one of Australia's most legendary and iconic artists; his traumatic childhood, fuelled with domestic violence, poverty and alcoholism and his evolution from James Dixon Swan to Jimmy Barnes.\nThe film also features musical performances with his children Mahalia Barnes and David Campbell, as well as his brother-in-law, Diesel.\nBarnes told news.com.au, \"Everyone wanted to do a TV miniseries like Molly or Olivia Newton-John and I told them it is just not happening. I wanted it to be true to the book. We’re dealing with sensitive issues, sensitive to me, my family, my siblings, my friends and I didn’t want to glamorise it or play down the gravity of the violence of abuse.\"\nThe film was released on 23 August 2018 in over 220 cinemas around Australia. The special was broadcast on free-to-air television 6 weeks later on October 1, 2018, due to an early interest in the project by the Seven Network.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
