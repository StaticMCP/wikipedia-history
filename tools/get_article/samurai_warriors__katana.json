The game also includes a competitive multiplayer mode for two players.\nOutside of combat, there are running sequences where players must swing their arms with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in hand to simulate the arms pumping in a running motion. Horseback riding is also included, with the Wii Remote performing the function of the reins while the Nunchuk is used as a whip.\nReception\n| MC = 53/100\n| EGM = 3.83/10\n| EuroG = 4/10\n| GI = 6/10\n| GameRev = B−\n| GSpot = 4.5/10\n| GSpy =\n| GT = 5.8/10\n| IGN = 5.8/10\n| NP = 7.5/10\n| XPlay =\n}}\nSamurai Warriors: Katana: was met with mixed reception upon release; GameRankings gave it a score of 53.15%, while Metacritic gave it 53 out of 100.\nThe game was given 2.5 stars out of five by GameSpy and was rated 4.5 out of 10 by GameSpot.
