The township during the first settlement period, although unincorporated, had several stores, churches, a bakery and various tack and blacksmith shops as well as and both Anglican and Presbyterian congregations. The area has many cemeteries dating from this original settlement period, which is considered the founding of the township, including the Lingo Family Cemetery and others.\nA second period of settlement occurred after Elisha Dickerson built a dam on the Indian River in the 1792.
