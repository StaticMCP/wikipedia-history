The current spiritual leader is Rabbi Judah Kerbel. Queens Jewish Center has services every day of the week, including holidays.\nOrganization affiliations\nThe Queens Jewish Center is a member of the Orthodox Union, the Queens Jewish Community Council, and the Vaad Harabonim of Queens.\nArchitecture\nThe Queens Jewish Center building won honorable mention in the 1955 Queens Chamber of Commerce, Annual Building Awards. The architect was David Moed of Manhattan and the builder was the LeFrak Organization.\nThe structure actually consists of two separate buildings. On October 3, 1946 an option was taken on the vacant plot where both synagogue buildings now stand. Ground was first broken for the first building (also referred to as the Talmud Torah building or Bais Hamedrash building) during an elaborate ceremony on June 5, 1949, by Judge Paul Balsam and Center President Herman A. Levine. The ground-breaking for the main synagogue building took place on June 21, 1953 and was made possible by generous benefactor, Mr. Harry LeFrak.\nClergy\nThe following individuals have served as rabbi of the Queens Jewish Center:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Order !!
