It ended in a Habsburg victory despite the stubborn defence of the Ottoman soldiers.\nBattle\nIn 1790, the Turks, driven out of Wallachia by the Russians and Austrians, defeated the troops of Prince Coburg at the siege of Giurgiu following a successful sortie. Encouraged by their success, the Turks crossed into Wallachia again via Vidin. They decided to attack the weaker detachment of field marshal François Sébastien de Croix.  On 14 June, 2,000 Ottoman soldiers left Vidin and, having crossed by boat to the left bank of the Danube, landed at Calafat.\nClerfayt, who had 17,000 men under his command, scattered in a cordon along the Danube from Brașov to the Olt. He sent a detachment under the command of General Buslach (4 battalions and 4 divisions of cavalry) to Kalafat. The appearance of this detachment forced the Turks to start a return crossing to the right bank of the Danube. However, having decided to firmly occupy Kalafat, 8,000–12,000 men crossed the river once more and entrenched themselves on the hills near the village on 24 June whilst 7 ships with guns, the so-called “gulls”, were located on the flanks of the trenches.\nClerfayt decided to force 10 battalions and 8 divisions of cavalry to push the Ottomans from the Danube and at 5am on 26 June he appeared in front of the Turkish camp, ordering the infantry in two lines. The cavalrymen lined up behind them and distributed their guns partly in the gaps and some of them were directed towards the Turkish ships. Gunfire started the fight but had little effect on the Janissaries behind the redoubts, and Clerfayt ordered the infantry to attack immediately to give the Turks no time to call in further reinforcements from Vidin. However, just as the battalions began to move, Sipahis appeared on the adjacent heights to surround the Austrian soldiers on the left flank. Clerfayt immediately sent four squadrons and two battalions from the unattacked wing to meet them. The Sipahis were repulsed, and after a stubborn resistance from the Turks, the trenches were captured by the remaining battalions. The Turks fled across the river; some by gulls whilst others were forced to swim.\nThe Austrian losses amounted to 10 officers and 200 men killed and wounded. The Turks lost 1,500 men, most of whom drowned in the Danube.\nSources\n* Петров А. Н. Вторая турецкая война в царствование Императрицы Екатерины II. 1787—1791 г. — СПб.: Тип. Р. Голике, 1880. — Т.
