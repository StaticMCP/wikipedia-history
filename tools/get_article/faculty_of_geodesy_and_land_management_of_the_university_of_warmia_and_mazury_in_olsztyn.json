Research on application of global satellite navigation systems, improving methods of acquiring, gathering and processing geodetic and satellite data and their use in special information systems, and optimizing methods of space management.\nHistory\nThe idea of creating a Geodetic Department is owed to the representatives of the Olsztyn geodetic institutions. Their initiative met with the support of the authorities of the University of Agriculture and the recognition and assistance of the regional authorities. This resulted in the creation of the Professional Study of Geodesy of Agricultural Equipment on October 1, 1960. The first recruitment of candidates for geodesy and agricultural engineering was held in 1960. Next, it was decided to acquire the necessary scientific and didactic staff for the Study. Thanks to the help of the Faculty of Geodesy and Cartography of Warsaw University of Technology the first researchers began their work. On December 3, 1967, the Department of Geodesy of Agricultural Equipment (WGUR) was renamed to the Department of Geodesy and Agricultural Equipment. On November 26, 1971, the Faculty obtained the first doctoral degree in scientific sciences and a PhD in agricultural sciences.\nWith the transformation of the University of Agriculture in Olsztyn in the Agricultural and Technical Academy in Olsztyn, the Space Flight Planetarium was opened on October 1, 1972. On September 11, 1978, the Satellite Observatory in Lamkówko, near Barczewo and the Astronomical Observatory in Olsztyn were opened. On July 1, 1989, the Faculty was granted the title of doctoral degree in geodesy and cartography. On September 1, 1992, the last name of the Faculty was changed to the Department of Geodesy and Spatial Management.\nOn October 1, 1997, the spatial planning program was launched, and a year later the IT department, which was moved to the newly established Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in 2001. On September 1, 1999, after the merger of three higher education institutions into the University of Warmia and Mazury, the Faculty was incorporated into its structure.\nOn 1 January 2015, the name of the unit was changed to the Department of Geodesy, Spatial Engineering and Construction, and the Faculty took over from the Faculty of Technical Sciences education in the fields of construction.\nResearch studies\n* Geoinformatics\n* Geographic Information Systems\n* Geodynamics\n* Astronomy\n* Remote sensing – methods and applications\nStructure\nThe research works are conducted within 8 organizational units of the Faculty of Geodesy and Land Management:\n* Institute of Geodesy (IG)\n* Chair of Astronomy and Geodynamics (KAiG)\n* Chair of Land Surveying and Geomatics (KGS)\n* Chair of Real Estate Management and Regional Development (KGNiRR)\n* Chair of Cadastre and Spatial Management (KKiZP)\n* Chair of Satellite Geodesy and Navigation (KGSiN)\n* Chair of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (KFiT)\n* Chair of Planning and Spatial Engineering (KPiIP)\nReferences"
