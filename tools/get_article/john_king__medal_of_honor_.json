(Royal Irish Constabulary). He walked 18 miles to Tuam County Galway and took the train, rather than going from Ballinrobe railway station, eventually arriving in then Queenstown, now Cobh County Cork. He then worked for his passage to the USA. King later enlisted in the Navy as a coal passer in Vermont on 20 July 1893. He served on board  in the Caribbean during the Spanish–American War, and, in 1900, was transferred to  for service during the Philippine–American War.\nKing received his first Medal of Honor while serving on the Vicksburg \"for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession at the time of the accident to the boilers... May 29, 1901.\" Eight years later, while a watertender on the , King received a second Medal of Honor during another boiler explosion on 13 September 1909. Advanced to chief watertender on 1 October 1909, he continued to serve at sea until discharged in 1916.\nThe beginning of World War I, however, brought Chief King back on active duty; he served in New York until 20 August 1919.\nHe lived in retirement until his death on 20 May 1938.\nHe is buried in the Calvary Cemetery in Hot Springs, Arkansas.\nLegacy\nIn January 1960 a US navy destroyer was launched and named . It paid a visit to Dublin, Ireland in December 1961 under the command of Commander Albert.M. Sackett, who subsequently unveiled a plaque in remembrance of John King at Ballinrobe, County Mayo, Ireland. Members of the Burke and Flannery families, living relatives of John King attended. Some members of the Burke and Flannery families from Ballinrobe were hosted on board the John King at Dublin.\nOn 4 September 2010, a statue of King was unveiled in Ballinrobe by Irish Minister of Defense Tony Killeen. Present at the ceremony was a relative, Ann Reid, whose father was King's nephew. She remarked, \"My dad used to talk about him all the time. On his visits to Ballinrobe from America, he would throw sweets and coins to the children of the town.\"\nMichael Burke, Dun Laoghaire County Dublin and originally from Cavan Ballinrobe County Mayo, a living relative, spoke at the unveiling and recalled some of the times he as a young man met and ran errands for John King.\nPupils from Ballinrobe NS added a touch of naval flavour to the occasion by accompanying a float the Ballinrobe Scout group constructed of the destroyer USS John King to the ceremony, towed into the arena by a vintage tractor. Former crew members of the USS John King representing the USS John King association, participated in the ceremony and a unit of the U.S. Navy Band from Naples, Italy were also present.\nAwards\n*Medal of Honor (2 awards)\n*Sampson Medal\n*Spanish Campaign Medal\n*Philippine Campaign Medal\n*World War I Victory Medal\nMedal of Honor citations\n1st Medal of Honor\nRank and organization: Watertender, U.S. Navy.
