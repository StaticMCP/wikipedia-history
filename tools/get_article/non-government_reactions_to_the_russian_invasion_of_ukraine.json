In turn, Saskia Esken, co-leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, of which Schröder is a member, called on him to give up his mandates for Rosneft and Gazprom, companies that she named \"infrastructure of a bloody war of aggression\". A few days later, Schröder's chief of staff and three other employees resigned from their positions following Schröder's refusal to relinquish their posts, while German chancellor Olaf Scholz joined the criticism on Schröder's mandates.

But for my stance towards a sovereign and free country, IN MY OPINION, the Russian citizens who oppose this war are numerous... We are with the millions of Russians who oppose this war. We support them. On the other hand, we must express our support to the Ukrainian people who are bravely fighting to protect their motherland and freedom\".\n* Former advisor to President Vladimir Putin and Kremlin insider Sergei Markov claimed that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was not a \"war between Russia and Ukraine, it's a war between Russia and (the) United States puppet who now occupy Ukraine. It's liberation of Ukraine and it's a proxy war of United States against Russia. We believe there's no independent Ukrainian government and this government is wholly under the control of the United States security community.\" Markov later admitted that the war in Ukraine was more difficult \"than had been expected. It was expected that 30 to 50 percent of the Ukrainian Armed Forces would switch over to Russia's side. No one is switching over.\"\nScience and technology\n* Broadly, many scientists publicly condemned the invasion, some supported further science-related sanctions, and some called for accelerating the renewable energy transition/decarbonization (i.e. for Russian fossil fuels sanctions and due to e.g. increased public acceptance of increased energy prices and uncomfortable energy conservation measures). Few also used or developed Web-based coordination tools. After the immediate reactions, scientists also reported projections alongside policy-recommendations on issues concerning the impacts of the war – such as of diseases and food security/the global food system.\n* Russian scientists and science journalists posted an open letter, calling the invasion of Ukraine \"unfair and frankly senseless\", noting that the resulting international isolation would mean \"that we, scientists, will no longer be able to do our job normally: After all, conducting scientific research is unthinkable without full cooperation with colleagues from other countries\".

The comments came after his Ukrainian counterpart Svitlana Krakovska made a speech connecting the war to climate change and called for an end to fossil fuel dependency. Anisimov's declaration was described as a rare rebuke of the invasion by a Russian government official, although he clarified to AFP that his statements \"expressed my personal opinion and attitude,\" and should not be taken as an \"official statement of the Russian delegation\".\n* CERN decided not to engage in any new collaborations with Russia and later declared its intention to terminate the cooperation agreements with Russia and Belarus at their expiration dates in 2024.\n* The Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences rejected Nicolás Maduro's position of support to Vladimir Putin and expressed its solidarity with the Ukrainian people after the invasion.\nReligious institutions\n* The Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epiphanius I (Orthodox Church of Ukraine) condemned the invasion and exhorted Ukrainians to fight against the Russian aggression, invoking God's help to win the battle.\n* The Major Archbishop of Kyiv and Halych Sviatoslav Shevchuk (Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church) condemned the invasion and wrote in the Ukrayinska Pravda that protecting the Motherland was a natural right and a civic duty.\n* Metropolitan Onufriy of Kyiv, primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), stated that Russia had started military actions against Ukraine, and urged Ukrainians to show love for their homeland and each other.

A communiqué from the Vatican Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, without naming Putin, said that while the worst-case scenario was unfolding, \"there is still time for goodwill, there is still room for negotiation, there is still room to exercise a wisdom that prevents partisan interests from prevailing, that protects the legitimate aspirations of all and spares the world the folly and horrors of war\".

He called for the \"speedy restoration of peace\". Three days later Patriarch Kirill also referred to Moscow's opponents in Ukraine as \"evil forces\", stating \"we must not allow dark and hostile external forces to laugh at us.\" Those statements of Kirill on the invasion have been seen as pro-Putin and providing historical and religious justification to the war.

We Are Legion! We Do Not Forgive! We Do Not Forget! Expect Us!\" On such page, Anonymous claimed to have hacked a Russian Linux terminal and a gas control system in North Ossetia, almost succeeding in causing an explosion in the latter. Anonymous stated that by changing the dates, the gas pressure almost caused an explosion (which the group phrased as \"turning into fireworks\"), but did not because of a fast-acting human worker at the gas control system. The page, which has been archived on the Internet Archive, contained a long line of text in English and Russian proposing a neutral security belt composed of Ukraine, Finland, and Georgia, among other countries, as well as YouTube videos of President Zelenskyy, screenshots of the gas controller during the hack, clips from the ending of the movie The Matrix, a video message from Anonymous itself mirroring some of the details posted to the website, and the \"WE ARE ANONYMOUS\" pop-up message repeated.

There they protested Google's policy of deleting inactive accounts, stating that it is \"harsh\" and \"destroys history\". Furthermore, they uploaded a text file disputing space exploration claims by the Soviet Union and a PDF version of a paper titled \"Wikipedia's Intentional Distortion of the History of the Holocaust,\" by professors Jan Grabowski and Shira Klein. On the UN academy website, a pixilated version of Taiwan's national flag and the lyrics of the Taiwanese national anthem are shown.
