The city gave its name to the Kamakura shogunate which governed the country during the Kamakura period (1185-1333). In 1992 the monuments were submitted jointly for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List under criteria i, ii, iii, iv, and vi.\nIn January 2012 it was announced that the Japanese government would formally submit the Kamakura site, along with Mount Fuji, for consideration by the World Heritage Committee in 2013. ICOMOS, the advisory body for cultural World Heritage Sites, inspected the site in late 2012. The request was considered by the World Heritage Committee at its 37th session in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in September, 2013. ICOMOS recommended not inscribing the site on the List, stating that the historical aspects of the site had largely been supplanted by the modern city that grew up around it and thus the site lacked the integrity necessary to be considered. The request for World Heritage status was duly withdrawn by Japan.\nTen candidate areas were proposed with twenty-two component sites, spanning the cities of Kamakura, Yokohama, and Zushi:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  width=\"100%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!width=\"40%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Site\n!width=\"40%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Comments\n!width=\"20%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n|-\n|  || Shinto shrine and symbol of the city; includes Wakamiya Ōji and Wakamiya subordinate shrine ||\n|-\n|  || Rinzai temple in Ōgigayatsu; number three of Kamakura's Five Mountains ||\n|-\n|  || Greatest of Kamakura's Rinzai temples; number one of Kamakura's Five Mountains ||\n|-\n|  || Rinzai temple in Nikaidō famous for its magnificent garden ||\n|-\n|  || Kōtoku-in's iconic Buddha statue ||\n|-\n|  || 13th century Shingon temple in Nikaidō; has a cluster of yagura ||\n|-\n|  || Ruins of a Buddhist temple near Gokuraku-ji ||\n|-\n|  || Ruins of a great Buddhist temple in Nikaidō ||\n|-\n|  || The area near Minamoto no Yoritomo's grave where the temple he was buried in used to stand ||\n|-\n|  || Ruins in Tokiwa of one of the residences of the Hōjō Shikken ||\n|-\n|  || One of Kamakura's Seven Entrances ||\n|-\n|  || One of Kamakura's Seven Entrances ||\n|-\n|  || One of Kamakura's Seven Entrances ||\n|-\n|  || Shingon temple ||\n|-\n|  || Rinzai temple in Kita-Kamakura; number two of Kamakura's Five Mountains ||\n|-\n| || One of the oldest shrines in Kamakura; enshrines Sugawara no Michizane ||\n|-\n|  || 13th century Shingon temple in Ōgigayatsu ||\n|-\n|  || One of Kamakura's Seven Entrances ||\n|-\n|  || Ruins of the Hōjō family temple, burned in 1333 on the day of the fall of Kamakura ||\n|-\n|  || One of Kamakura's Seven Entrances; has a cluster of yagura ||\n|-\n|  || Shingon temple in an area of Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama that used to be part of Kamakura ||\n|-\n|  || An artificial island (the oldest in the country) in Zaimokuza ||\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* World Heritage Sites in Japan\nReferences\n* , Page 31\nExternal links\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/370/ UNESCO tentative list description]\n* [http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/000166842.pdf Component sites and map]\n* [http://www.kcn-net.org/e_kama_history/index.html Kamakura: History and Historic Sites]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905203634/http://sk777.info/ City of Samurai]  - Position of each proposed World Heritage Site in Google Maps"
