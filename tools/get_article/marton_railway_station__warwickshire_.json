This later became known as the Rugby and Leamington Railway and received royal assent on 13 August 1846.  The undertaking was sold to the London and North Western Railway on 17 November 1846 and the line opened on 1 March 1851.\nMarton station was situated half-a-mile south of the village it served on the road to Long Itchington (now the A423). The brick-built station buildings were on the Down (Leamington-bound) side of the line.\nMarton station closed to passenger traffic on 15 June 1959 and closed to freight in July 1961.\nThe rail bridge over the A423 was demolished in August 2022, removing the access to the former station permanently.\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#440,267,1 Marton Station on navigable 1954 O.
