There are nearly  of highways and roads, 9,872 being paved and  (2002 est.) unpaved. Like any underdeveloped nation, the Dominican Republic suffers from a lack of good paved roads to connect smaller towns and less populated areas, though work on paving them proceeds. Major town roads are kept in good condition.\nMotorists drive on the right-hand side of the road.\nPublic transportation\n]]\nMass transit\nThe Santo Domingo Metro is the first mass transit system in the country, and the second among Caribbean & Central American nations. It is the most extensive metro system in the region by length and total number of stations. On February 27, 2008, the incumbent president Leonel Fernández test-rode the system for the first time, and thereafter free service was offered several times. Commercial service began on January 30, 2009. Several additional lines are currently planned.\nSantiago Light Rail is a planned light rail system, still at the development stage, in the Dominican Republic's second-largest city Santiago de los Caballeros. Construction was slated to begin in mid-2008 but is currently on hold, due to lack of approval and of central government funds.\nBuses\nThe Dominican Republic has a bus system that is rather reliable, and most of these public transportation vehicles are fairly comfortable.

They may also be somewhat uncomfortable, since drivers try to fit as many people as possible inside the vehicles. Carros Públicos are often standard sedans, but can be packed with as many as six passengers.\nRailways\nRail operations are provided by one state-owned operator and several private operators (mainly for sugar mills).
