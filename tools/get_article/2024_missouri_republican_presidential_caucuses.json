The contest was held alongside caucuses in Idaho and Michigan.\nFormer president Donald Trump defeated former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley in a landslide, winning all 924 state delegates. However, no delegates to the national convention were allocated at the caucuses and delegates will not be bound until the April \"district conventions\" or the May state convention.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates were eligible for nomination at the Missouri caucuses:\n* Nikki Haley\n* David Stuckenberg\n* Donald Trump\nBackground\nIn June 2022, Governor Mike Parson signed [https://www.house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB1878&year=2022&code=R HB 1878], which repealed the state's presidential primary. Numerous attempts were made by the Missouri General Assembly to reinstate it, but it was not done in time.\nIn October 2023, the Missouri Republican Party announced it would hold caucuses in 2024.\nEndorsements\n*Eric Schmitt (2023–present)\nU.S. Representatives\n* Ann Wagner, MO-02 (2013–present)\n* Mark Alford, MO-04 (2023–present)\n* Sam Graves, MO-06 (2001–present)\n* Eric Burlison, MO-07 (2023–present)\n* Billy Long, MO-07 (2011–2023)\n* Jason Smith, MO-08 (2013–present)\nGovernors\n* Mike Parson, (2018–present)\n* Eric Greitens, (2017–2018)\nState executive officials\n*Andrew Bailey, Attorney General (2023–present)\n*Mike Kehoe, Lieutenant Governor of Missouri (2018–present)\nState senators\n* Rick Brattin, Member of the Missouri Senate from the 31st district (2021–present)\n* Bill Eigel, Member of the Missouri Senate from the 23rd district (2017–present)\nFormer party official\n*Ed Martin, chair of the Missouri Republican Party (2013–2015)\n}}\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-datatable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!
