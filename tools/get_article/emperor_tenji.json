He was the son of Emperor Jomei and Empress Kōgyoku (Empress Saimei), and his children included Empress Jitō, Empress Genmei, and Emperor Kōbun.\nIn 645, Tenji and Fujiwara no Kamatari defeated Soga no Emishi and Soga no Iruka. He established a new government and carried out political reforms. He then assumed real political power as the crown prince of both Emperor Kōtoku and Empress Saimei. Despite the death of Empress Saimei, he did not accede to the throne for seven years, and came to the throne only after the relocation of the capital to Ōmi in 668. He created Japan's first family register, the Kōgo Nenjaku, and the first code of law, the Ōmi Code.\nTraditional narrative\nTenji was the son of Emperor Jomei, but was preceded as ruler by his mother Empress Saimei.\nPrior to his accession, he was known as .\nEvents of Tenji's life\nAs prince, Naka no Ōe played a crucial role in ending the near-total control the Soga clan had over the imperial family. In 644, seeing the Soga continue to gain power, he conspired with Nakatomi no Kamatari and Soga no Kurayamada no Ishikawa no Maro to assassinate Soga no Iruka in what has come to be known as the Isshi Incident. Although the assassination did not go exactly as planned, Iruka was killed, and his father and predecessor, Soga no Emishi, committed suicide soon after. Following the Isshi Incident, Iruka's adherents dispersed largely without a fight, and Naka no Ōe was named heir apparent. He also married the daughter of his ally Soga no Kurayamada, thus ensuring that a significant portion of the Soga clan's power was on his side.\nEvents of Tenji's reign\nNaka no Ōe reigned as Emperor Tenji from 661 to 672.\n* 661: In the , the empress designated her son as her heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that this son would have received the succession (senso) after her death or abdication. Shortly after, she died, and Emperor Tenji could be said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\n* 662: Tenji is said to have compiled the first Japanese legal code known to modern historians. The Ōmi Code, consisting of 22 volumes, was promulgated in the last year of Tenji's reign. This legal codification is no longer extant, but it is said to have been refined in what is known as the Asuka Kiyomihara ritsu-ryō of 689; and these are understood to have been a forerunner of the Taihō ritsu-ryō of 701.\n* 663: Tenji invaded Korea in an attempt to support a revival of Japan's ally Paekche, one of Korea's Three Kingdoms, which had been conquered by the Korean kingdom of Silla in 660. He was seriously defeated at the Battle of Baekgang by the combined forces of Silla and Tang China.\n* 668: Tenji undergoes his ceremonial confirmation as emperor. He had postponed formalities during the period that the mausoleum of his mother was being constructed, and when the work was finished he could delay no longer. Up until this time, although he had been de facto monarch, he had retained the title of Crown Prince.\nTenji was particularly active in improving the military institutions established during the Taika Reforms.\nDeath of the emperor\nMemorial Shinto shrine and\nFollowing his death in 672, there ensued a succession dispute between his fourteen children (many by different mothers). In the end, he was succeeded by his son, Prince Ōtomo, also known as Emperor Kōbun, then by Tenji's brother Prince Ōama, also known as Emperor Tenmu. Almost one hundred years after Tenji's death, the throne passed to his grandson Emperor Kōnin.\n:Post-Meiji chronology\n:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the , designated his son as his heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that the son would have received the succession (senso) after his father's death. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kōbun is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui). If this understanding were valid, then it would follow:\n::* In the 1st year of Kōbun (672): Emperor Kōbun, in the 1st year of his reign (弘文天皇元年), died; and his uncle Ōaomi-shinnō received the succession (senso) after the death of his nephew. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Tenmu could be said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\n:Pre-Meiji chronology\n:Prior to the 19th century, Ōtomo was understood to have been a mere interloper, a pretender, an anomaly; and therefore, if that commonly accepted understanding were to have been valid, then it would have followed:\n:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the , died; and despite any military confrontations which ensued, the brother of the dead sovereign would have received the succession (senso); and after a time, it would have been understood that Emperor Tenmu rightfully acceded to the throne (sokui).\nThe actual site of Tenji's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Yamashina-ku, Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Tenji's mausoleum. It is formally named Yamashina no misasagi.\nPoetry\nThe ''Man'yōshū includes poems attributed to emperors and empresses; and according to Donald Keene, evolving Man'yōshū studies have affected the interpretation of even simple narratives like \"The Three Hills.\" The poem was long considered to be about two male hills in a quarrel over a female hill, but scholars now consider that Kagu and Miminashi might be female hills in love with the same male hill, Unebi. This still-unresolved enigma in poetic form is said to have been composed by Emperor Tenji while he was still Crown Prince during the reign of Empress Saimei:\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"margin:auto; border:1px solid black; background:#e7e8ff;\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#d7a8ff;\"\n|Japanese||Rōmaji||English\n|- valign=top\n|\n香具山は\n畝傍ををしと\n耳成と\n相争ひき\n神代より\nかくにあるらし\nいにしへも\nしかにあれこそ\nうつせみも\n妻を\n争ふらしき\n|\nKaguyama wa\nUnebi o oshi to\nMiminashi to\nAiarasoiki\nKamuyo yori\nKaku ni arurashi\nInishie mo\nShika ni are koso\nUtsusemi mo\nTsuma o\nArasourashiki\n|\nMount Kagu strove with\n: Mount Miminashi\nFor the love of\n: Mount Unebi.\nSuch is love\n: since the age of the gods;\nAs it was thus\n: in the early days,\nSo people\n: strive for spouses\n:: even now.\n|-\n|colspan=2|\n|}\nOne of his poems was chosen by Fujiwara no Teika as the first in the popular Hyakunin Isshu anthology:\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"margin:auto; border:1px solid black; background:#e7e8ff;\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#d7a8ff;\"\n|Japanese||Rōmaji||English\n|- valign=top\n|\n秋の田の\nかりほの庵の\n苫をあらみ\nわが衣手は\n露にぬれつつ\n|\nAki no ta no\nKariho no io no\nToma o arami\nWaga koromode wa\nTsuyu ni nuretsutsu\n|\nBecause of the coarseness of the rush-mat\nOf the temporary-hut\nWhere the rice of autumn harvest is\nAs far as my sleeve is concerned\nThey are becoming wet with dew (or tears).\n|-\n|colspan=2|\n|}\nAfter his death, his wife, Empress Yamato wrote a song of longing about her husband.\nKugyo''\nThe top  during Emperor Tenji's reign included:\n* Daijō-daijin: , 671–672.\n* Naishin (内臣): Fujiwara no Kamatari (藤原鎌足) (614–669), 645–669.\nPrince Ōtomo (Ōtomo-shinnō) was the favorite son of Emperor Tenji; and he was also the first to be accorded the title of Daijō-daijin.\nNon-nengō period\nThe years of Tenji's reign are not linked by scholars to any era or nengō. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – nengō – languished until Mommu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701 (aside from the momentary proclamation of the Shuchō era under Emperor Tenmu in 686).\n* See Japanese era name – \"Non-nengo periods\"\n* See Tenji period (661).\nIn this context, Brown and Ishida's translation of Gukanshō offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō's reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taiho time-frame:\n::\"The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698].
