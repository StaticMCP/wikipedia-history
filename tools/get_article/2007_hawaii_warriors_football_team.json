      "text": "# 2007 Hawaii Warriors football team\n\nThe 2007 Hawaii Warriors football team represented the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season.\nThe 2007 Warriors, led by record-setting senior quarterback Colt Brennan, carried a school-record 13-game winning streak, dating back to the end of the 2006 season, into the 2008 Sugar Bowl. The 2007 season marked the first undefeated regular season in school history, ending in defeat in the Sugar Bowl. The Warriors claimed their third-ever WAC championship in 2007 with a victory over defending conference champion Boise State. The championship was the school's first ever outright conference championship in football.\nBrennan went on to set more career records in the FBS, and the Warriors became the third team outside the BCS conferences and second from the WAC to receive an invitation to play in the Bowl Championship Series, playing in the Sugar Bowl against the 4th ranked Georgia Bulldogs. However, they ultimately lost the game, 41–10.\nSchedule\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\nRankings\nAssistant coach shuffle\nWaves were made in Hawaii during the months leading up to Spring practice. With the departures of Defensive Coordinator Jerry Glanville and Special Teams Coach Darrel \"Mouse\" Davis (the father of the run and shoot offense), the Warriors' most anticipated season took a slight detour.\nOn March 1, 2007, Glanville chose to accept the Head Coach position at Portland State University. It became apparent that he was seriously considering the position after staying in Portland an extra four days following his official interview. To harden the blow, Glanville offered Davis the Offensive Coordinator job at PSU. Davis was also the head coach for PSU in the '70s and '80s, where his run-and-shoot offense gained national attention. The silver lining on the dark cloud was that Davis wasn't the only one to benefit and there was another member of the coaching staff who prospered from this particular move. With two vacancies on the coaching staff, it made it possible for Offensive Line Coach Dennis McKnight to be promoted from an unpaid Graduate Assistant, to a salary-earning full-time assistant coach.\nAs for the other open position to be filled, it was believed that because of his experience and tremendous recruiting accomplishments, defensive line coach Jeff Reinebold was the obvious choice to become the next Defensive Coordinator. But shortly after Glanville's departure, talk of former Hawaii defensive coordinator Greg McMackin surfaced as a candidate for the job he held in 1999, June Jones' first season as Hawaii head coach. With the impressive, hard-hitting, 3–4 blitzing defense that Glanville put on the field in 2006 setting the standards ever-so-high, whoever was to inherit the job had big shoes to fill. The answer to whether Hawaii should remain a punishing 3–4 defense under Reinebold or return to a heavily blitzing 4–3 defense under McMackin that contributed to the biggest turnaround in NCAA college football history became slightly clearer when McMackin made an appearance as an \"observer\" to the first spring practice. The final confirmation came on April 5, when it was officially announced that Greg McMackin was named the defensive coordinator for Hawaii. Although his time at Hawaii was short, Glanville left a lasting impression on the fans as well as the players.\nGame summaries\nNorthern Colorado\nHeisman Trophy candidate Colt Brennan threw for 416 yards and six touchdowns in only the first half as the 23rd-ranked University of Hawai`i football team opened up the 2007 campaign with a 63–6 victory over Northern Colorado, Saturday night, at Aloha Stadium.\nThe Warriors found the end zone early and often tallying 28 points in the first and led 42–0 at the half. UH scored only once in the third quarter on an 80-yard punt return for a TD by Michael Washington.\nThe Bears finally got on the board with 10:22 remaining in the fourth as quarterback Mike Vlahogeorge took a quarterback draw and scampered five yards for the score. UH's Keenan Jones blocked the point after.\nUH's Malcolm Lane then took the ensuing kickoff and sprinted 94 yards to make it 56–6. The UH defense picked off a pass and five plays later QB Inoki Funaki found Greg Salas for a 24-yard scoring strike to go up by 57, 63–6.\nBrennan moved into a tie for sixth place on the NCAA career passing TD list with 99, sharing the spot with USC's Matt Leinart. He trails the No. 1 slot occupied by former BYU standout Ty Detmer by 22.\n\"Feels great to be back and the fans were awesome\", Brennan said. \"We had a great practice yesterday and knew in the hotel today that something felt right. I'm surrounded with a lot of veteran talent and that makes you better on offense and as a football player. They came out just like we had planned for. We were very prepared. I know that with our offensive line, they have a lot of motivation. I have a lot of trust in them.\"\nThe defense limited the Bear offense to a mere 182 yards of total offense.\nBrennan was on fire in the first half, setting a new school record for completions in the first quarter (19) and half (34). He also broke his own record of passing yards in a half, finishing with 416 yards, 27 more than his previous mark of 389 set in last year's Hawai'i Bowl. Brennan also tied school marks for touchdowns in a quarter (4) and half (6).\n*Weekly accolades: AT&T All-America National Player of the Week & WAC Offensive Player of the Week: Colt Brennan, QB\nLouisiana Tech\nGerard Lewis batted down a two-point conversion to preserve a thrilling come-from-behind victory for the 20th ranked University of Hawai`i as the Warriors edged Louisiana Tech, 45–44, in overtime, Saturday night in the Western Athletic Conference season opener for both teams in front of 22,135 at Joe Aillet Stadium. Jason Rivers' 6-yard reception and Dan Kelly's extra-point kick proved to be just enough. Tech took their opening possession and countered with Dustin Mitchell going in from two yards out. Then the Bulldogs went for the win, but Lewis knocked down the 2-point pass attempt.\nThe Bulldogs went up 14–0 in the first quarter on a 2-yard run by Patrick Jackson. Then Jackson broke free for a 16-yard scamper with 4:03 left in the quarter.\nThe Warriors pulled to within seven when Leon Wright-Jackson scooted 47 yards up the middle with 1:43 remaining.\nHawai`i then knotted up the score when quarterback Colt Brennan plunged across from 1 yard out with 10:11 left in the second. Tech took a 21–14 lead into the half when Daniel Porter broke free from the line for an 18-yard run.\nThe Warriors struck first in the third quarter as Brennan found Ryan Grice-Mullen all alone for a 64-yard scoring strike.\nTech reclaimed the lead in the third on a 42-yard field goal by Danny Horwedel.\nUH took its first lead of the game with 2:04 remaining in the third when Brennan connected with Grice-Mullen on a 17-yard pass.\nAfter the UH defense held, a muffed handoff between Brennan and Wright-Jackson gave the Bulldogs back the ball late in the third. Tech then drove 33 yards on three plays, capped by a 3-yard touchdown pass by Zac Champion to Josh Wheeler to recapture the lead, 31–28.\nThe Warriors regained the lead, 35–31, on a Brennan 19-yard scoring strike to Davone Bess with 8:35 left in the game.\nTech converted a fourth and 1 from its 22 when Dennis Morris broke free for 21 yards to the UH 1. Morris then carried it across for the 1-yard score to give the Bulldogs a 38–35 lead.\nBrennan finished with career-highs of 43 completions and 61 attempts for 548 yards and five touchdowns (four passing and one rushing). Brennan was 11 yards from his own school mark of 559 set during last year's Sheraton Hawai'i Bowl against Arizona State. Rivers finished the game with a school-record 14 receptions for 176 yards.\nUNLV\nThe 22nd-ranked University of Hawai`i football team ran its record to 3–0 on the season with a convincing 49–14 victory at UNLV in a non-conference game, Saturday night, in front of a sold out Sam Boyd Stadium.\nHeisman Trophy candidate Colt Brennan was responsible for five touchdowns – three rushing and two passing. The senior quarterback, who played only the first three quarters, threw for 298 yards, completing 26 of 32 passes. Brennan snapped his 14-game 300+ yard passing streak, dating back to the UNLV match-up a year ago.\nA crowd of 38,125 witnessed the Rebels (1–2) draw first blood manufacturing a 13-play, 79-yard drive, capped by a 6-yard run by Frank Summers.\nUH responded with 42 unanswered points – 21 in the first half – to take a 14-point lead into halftime. The first two scores were 1-yard rushing touchdowns by Brennan. It was the quarterback's first multiple touchdown game on the ground. The third score was a 13-yard TD pass from Brennan to Ryan Grice-Mullen.\nThe Warriors kept the momentum in the second half. UH took the ball on its opening drive in the third and went 73 yards in seven plays before Brennan ran the option right and plunged over from 3 yards. In the series, Brennan completed an 11-yard pass to Leon Wright-Jackson to give him his 29th consecutive 200+ yard passing game, breaking the NCAA record. The old mark of 28 was held by Texas Tech's Kliff Kingsbury.\nHawai`i added two more scores in the quarter – a 2-yard TD pass from Brennan to Jason Rivers and a 40-yard interception return by Ryan Mouton – to give the Warriors a 42–7 lead heading into the fourth.\nUNLV added a late score on a 31-yard touchdown run by Omar Clayton.\nUH capped the scoring with its only touchdown in the fourth quarter as Tyler Graunke connected with Malcolm Lane on an 81-yard reception.\nCharleston Southern\nThe 19th-ranked University of Hawai`i football team capitalized on a 28-point third quarter to knock off Charleston Southern, 66–10, Saturday night in a non-conference game in front of 37,723 at Aloha Stadium. The Warriors improved to 4–0 for the first time since the 1988 season.\nUH scored on its opening possession when Tyler Graunke connected with C.J. Hawthorne on a 28-yard pass. Graunke got the starting nod when head coach June Jones held out Heisman Trophy candidate Colt Brennan for precautionary reasons.\nGraunke finished the game, completing 22-of-36 attempts for 285 yards and three scores. The junior had career-highs in completions, attempts, yards, and touchdowns.\nThe Bucs tied it at 5:14 in the first when Eli Byrd hit Dee Brown on a 57-yard catch-and-run in the first quarter.\nUH responded and scored 10 seconds into the second quarter when freshman Kealoha Pilares scooted 16 yards up the middle. The Warriors tacked on another seven late in the quarter as Graunke scrambled six yards for the score.\nCharleston Southern's Nick Ellis kicked a 48-yard field goal to draw within 21–10 at the half.\nIt was all UH in the second half as the Warriors reeled off 45 straight points to turn an 11-point halftime lead into a 56-point rout. UH's Ryan Mouton took the second half kickoff 90 yards to the house. One minute later, linebacker Adam Leonard picked off Ellis' pass and returned it 36 yards for the touchdown. Graunke then hit receivers Davone Bess for a 19-yard score and Hawthorne on a 35-yard TD pass to close out the quarter.\nUH tacked on 17 more in the fourth quarter behind backup quarterback Inoke Funaki. The sophomore from Kahuku High School hit Aaron Bain for a two-yard scoring reception with 13:16 left in the fourth quarter.

The Vandals fell to 1–4 and 0–1.\nIt is the first time UH had begun the season 5–0 since 1981. The win is the ninth WAC win in a row, setting a new school record.\nHeisman Trophy candidate Colt Brennan, who sat out last week's win at home against Charleston Southern, threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns on 30-of-45 passing in this game. He also threw five interceptions, tying a school mark. Brennan extended his streak of consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass to 30 games. He has also thrown two or more TD passes in a game in 22 straight games.\nIn three career games versus Idaho, Brennan has 11 touchdown passes and 1,048 yards passing.\nHawai`i got on the board first as Brennan hooked up with Davone Bess on a 13-yard scoring strike.\nIdaho tied it at seven on an Eddie Williams 18-yard run.\nThe Warriors then reeled off 31 unanswered points to take control of the game.\nWith 4:47 left in the first quarter, UH linebacker Adam Leonard picked off a pass and took it to the house. It was Leonard's second straight interception return for a touchdown in the last two games.\nBrennan then connected with Malcolm Lane on a 41-yard touchdown pass. Later in the quarter, Brennan hit Bess with a 24-yard scoring pass. Dan Kelly hit a 39-yard field goal and defensive back Myron Newberry returned an interception 76 yards to give UH a 38–7 lead.\nIdaho's Tino Amancio booted a 50-yard field goal with 36 seconds left before the half.

The Warriors improve to 6–0 and 3–0 in the WAC this season. UH quarterback Colt Brennan completed 19-of-25 for 219 yards and one touchdown before leaving the game early in the second half. The senior got dinged up on UH's final possession of the first half and succumbed to backup Tyler Graunke.\nGraunke led the Warriors to a touchdown at the end of the first half and directed UH downfield on three drives in the second half. The junior from Tucson, Ariz., finished the game 9-of-11 for 246 yards and three touchdowns, including one rushing.\n\"I wasn't expecting to go in that early, but I was definitely mentally ready\", Graunke said. \"I took my fair share of reps during the week. Lately, I have not been feeling like me, it is taking me 1–2 series to get going, but tonight I got it going from the very first play. That start (Charleston Southern) gave me a lot of confidence. We executed very well and the receivers were just amazing. I knew I was over the goal line (on his second quarter touchdown) and that play gave us a lot of momentum heading into the second half.\"\nThe game featured big plays for both teams. Each team returned a kickoff for a touchdown and UH had three drives of three plays or less while USU had a one play drive.\nUtah State (0–6, 0–2) got on the scoreboard on the game's opening possession with a 20-yard field goal by Peter Caldwell. The Warriors responded with an eight-play, 81-yard drive, culminating on a Kealoha Pilares touchdown from a yard out. That lead was short-lived as USU's Kevin Robinson returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards giving the Aggies the lead back at 10–7.\nUH knotted the game at 10 after Dan Kelly's 54-yard field goal, the fifth longest in school history. After Caldwell's 36-yard field goal gave the Aggies the lead temporarily at 13–10, Malcolm Lane's 87-yard return on the ensuing kickoff, put the Warriors on top for good, 17–13.\nFollowing an Aggie punt, UH marched downfield and Brennan found Davone Bess on a 22-yard scoring strike. After UH's Josh Leonard recovered a USU fumble, Hawai'i drove the field for another touchdown. Graunke subbed in for Brennan and crossed the goal line with five seconds left giving UH a 31–13 halftime lead.\nOn their opening possession of the second half, the Aggies drove downfield on a 12 play drive and an eight-yard run by Derrvin Speight. Graunke connected with C.J. Hawthorne on two plays, including a 36-yarder for a 38–20 UH lead.\nGraunke drove the Warriors again and found David Farmer on a 20-yard shuffle pass giving UH a 45–27 lead. On USU's next possession, Leon Jackson found Kevin Robinson on a 77-yard pass and catch but the Warriors responded just as quickly as Graunke connected with Rivers on a 72-yard reception.\nJunior linebacker Soloman Elimimian led the Warrior defense with a career-high 20 tackles.\n\"Everyone played well\", Elimimian said. \"I just utilized my speed tonight and tried to go from sideline to sideline. I'd give the Defense a \"C\" tonight. We definitely could have played better, 37 points are just too much. Guys can't do what they want to do, it's a team concept. Teams like Utah State are much tougher to beat than a ranked team because they played with nothing to lose.\"\nSan Jose State\nThe 16th ranked University of Hawai`i football team rallied past San Jose State, 42–35, in overtime in a Western Athletic Conference contest in front of 20,473 at a rain-drenched Spartan Stadium. Jason Rivers caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from Colt Brennan in the first overtime for its second come-from-behind victory this season. Defensive back Myron Newberry sealed the win intercepting SJSU quarterback Adam Tafralis in the end zone on the final drive.\nHawai`i improves to 7–0 on the season and 4–0 in WAC play, while San Jose State falls to 3–4 and 2–1. With the win, UH extends its win streak to eight and keeps its hope for a BCS bid alive. The Warriors also extended their WAC win streak to 11 games.\nHeisman Trophy candidate Brennan completed 44-of-75 passes for 545 yards and four TD passes. He also was picked four times during the game. It was the third time this season a trio of receivers went for at least 100 yards or more led by Ryan Grice-Mullen's 14 catches for 175 yards. Bess and Rivers posted 140 and 138 yards, respectively.\nIt was the first time this season UH failed to score at least 45 points and but kept its streak of 17-straight games scoring 32 points or more.\nUH opened the scoring after linebacker Adam Leonard picked off a Spartan pass and returned it 28 yards to the SJSU 35 yard line. Brennan then connected on 4-of-6 passes to set up a Kealoha Pilares 6-yard rush to give UH a 7–0 lead.\nHawai`i then manufactured a 12-play drive, 86-yard drive culminating with a 16-yard touchdown pass from Brennan to Grice-Mullen.\nSan Jose State cut the deficit in half when Dwight Lowery returned a Tim Grasso punt 84 yards just before the end of the first half.\nSJSU's Lowery then picked off Brennan's first attempt of the third quarter and returned it 24 yards to knot it up at 14 apiece.\nThe Spartans took their first lead of the game with 5:25 left in the third when Tafralis hit Kevin Jurovich on a 16-yard pass. The play capped a five-play, 65-yard drive after SJSU took over on downs when Brennan was stopped on a fourth and 1 quarterback sneak. It is the first time since the Louisiana Tech game that UH has trailed at all in the second half.\nSJSU extended its lead to 28–14 with Tafralis hitting Jurovich on a 68-yard scoring strike with 2:32 remaining in the third.\nUH didn't waste any time, marching down the field 67 yards in one minute and 18 seconds. The TD cut into SJSU's lead with Brennan tossing a 34-yard strike to C.J. Hawthorne to pull to within seven, 28–21.

Callier coughed up the ball after a huge blow from linebacker Blaze Soares with Leonard recovering the fumble with 2:56 left in the game.\nIt took the Warriors only two minutes and 25 seconds to drive down the field 45 yards with Brennan taking the option and going across the right side for a 2-yard run to tie the game with 31 seconds left, 35–35.\nThe Spartans had one last chance to score before the end of regulation, but the UH defense held strong as time expired.\nDefensively, Leonard led the charge with 11 tackles, two for a loss, one fumble recovery and one interception. Solomon Elimimian and Jacob Patek recorded eight and seven tackles, respectively.\nNew Mexico State\nThe 17th-ranked University of Hawai`i football team defeated New Mexico State, 50–13, Saturday night, in a Western Athletic Conference game in front of a season-high 41,218 on Homecoming at Aloha Stadium. Hawai`i improves to 8–0 on the year and 5–0 in the WAC, while New Mexico State falls to 4–5 and 1–3.

He has 119 in his career and surpassed Timmy Chang's previous mark of 117. In addition, Brennan ranks second all-time in NCAA and WAC history and trails former BYU quarterback Ty Detmer's record of 121.\n\"I was obviously happy with the result, but we're going to have to play better the next few games\", UH head coach June Jones said. \"Colt was not at his best tonight, but six touchdowns is still pretty good. I hope the week off gets him and the team healthy and ready for Fresno.\"\nAfter tossing an interception on his first pass attempt, Brennan drove the Warriors 65 yards in five plays, hitting Jason Rivers on a 16-yard touchdown pass to put UH on top 6–0. Place kicker Dan Kelly missed the extra-point attempt, snapping his streak of 50 straight this season and 69 consecutive over the past two years.\nBrennan finished the game completing 29-of-46 for 425 yards. He surpassed the 400-yard mark for the fourth time this season and the 17th time in his career.\n\"What I learned last year is that don't pay any attention to records or stats\", Brennan said. \"This offense and this team is not about that but about the 'W' – that is our mentality.\"\nHawai`i struck again in the first quarter as Brennan found Ryan Grice-Mullen on a fade route in the left corner of the end zone to put UH up 13–0.\nIn the second quarter, Myron Newberry returned a short NMSU punt 29 yards to the Aggie 12 to set up a 27-yard field goal by Kelly. The UH defense held the Aggies on a fourth-and-three at the UH 47, then two plays later Brennan hooked up with Grice-Mullen down the right sideline for a 42-yard score to make it 23–0.\nThe Aggies' Paul Young added a 34-yard field goal as UH went into the locker room with a 23–3 halftime lead.\nNMSU scored on its opening possession of the second half, marching 58 yards on 11 plays, capped by a 41-yard field goal by Young.\nUH took the ensuing kickoff and drove 61 yards in five plays with Brennan completing a 23-yard scoring pass to Davone Bess.

He now has 38, tying him with former UH quarterback Michael Carter and receiver Chad Owens.\n\"If you ask me during the game, I never know the numbers\" Grice-Mullen said. \"I may know how many touchdowns. My objective is to just go out and play the game and get a win. We've been in the system 3 or 4 years now with the same quarterback and things are becoming second nature and go out and have fun.\"\nFresno State\nThe University of Hawai`i moved to 9–0 for the first time since the 1925 season with a 37–30 victory against Fresno State in a Western Athletic Conference game in front of 49,047 fans at Aloha Stadium.

I'm looking forward to getting back on the field for next week's game against Nevada.\"\nThe Bulldogs added a late score. UH recovered the onside kick and ran the clock out.\nNevada\nDan Kelly's 45-yard field goal with 11 seconds left lifted No. 16 Hawai'i past Nevada, 28–26, in a Western Athletic Conference game in front of 22,437 at Mackey Stadium tonight.\nHawai'i got the ball back with 2:16 remaining in the fourth quarter, trailing 26–25. Quarterback Tyler Graunke marched the Warriors 61 yards in 11 plays to set up Kelly's heroics.\nThe Wolf Pack tried to ice the junior kicker twice.

A 53-yard pass play from Graunke to C.J. Hawthorne on the first play of the drive set up the touchdown.\nThe Wolf Pack responded with a 41-yard field goal by Brett Jaekle to go into the locker room at halftime with UH out in front, 19–10.\nNevada took the second half kickoff and traveled 52 yards with Jaekle booting his second field goal of the game, a 42-yarder.\nThe Wolf Pack took its first lead of the game, 20–19, on their next possession with a 17-play drive covering 90 yards elapsing eight minutes and 20 seconds with Kaepernick bootlegging over from three yards out.\nUH recaptured the lead, 25–20, as Graunke connected with Ryan Grice-Mullen for a 22-yard scoring strike. The Warriors went for two, but Graunke's attempt was batted down.\nAfter both teams exchanged punts, Nevada then put together a 51-yard drive highlighted by a 45-yard pass play before Lippincott plunged over the left side from 5 yards. The two-point pass attempt was no good giving the Wolf Pack a slim, 26–25 lead with 8:27 left in the fourth quarter.\nOn UH's next possession, Graunke was sacked and fumbled the ball giving Nevada good position from the UH 44-yard line. Two plays later, defensive lineman Keala Watson popped UNR wide receiver Arthur King Jr. and made him cough up the ball with Watson recovering at the UH 47.\nThe Warriors were stopped on a fourth down play when Graunke tried to thread it to Rivers on the left sideline.\nThe UH defense held Nevada's offense and forced them to punt to give UH one last try.\nBoise State\nleft\nThe 15th-ranked University of Hawai'i football team claimed its first outright Western Athletic Conference championship after a 39–27 victory over No. 19 Boise State, Friday night, at a sold-out, raucous crowd at 50,000-seat Aloha Stadium. The win keeps the Warriors' (11–0, 8–0 WAC) hopes alive of a Bowl Championship Series game.\nHawai'i snapped Boise State's streak of 18 straight WAC wins and a six-game losing streak to the Broncos (10–2, 7–1). It also snapped BSU's stranglehold of the conference title, ending the Broncos five-year reign. The victory extended UH's win streak to a new school-record 12 straight.\nUH also captured WAC championships in 1992 and 1999, however, those were shared with other teams.\nHeisman Trophy candidate Colt Brennan led the Warrior aerial attack with 495 yards and five touchdowns, while also rushing for another score. Brennan broke three major college records following his first TD of the night to Ryan Grice-Mullen, breaking Ty Detmer's mark for most career touchdowns, most TDs responsible for and most points responsible for.\n\"I think we proved something tonight with all of the so-called experts who picked Boise to beat us\", Brennan said. \"It was a great win for us, the school and the state. The faith on this team is huge. We believe in ourselves.\"\nReceiver Davone Bess set a new school record with 15 receptions for 181 yards and two touchdowns. With the two scores, he and Brennan tied the NCAA mark for passing combinations with 39 career TDs. Jason Rivers had 11 catches for 113 yards and one touchdown. C.J. Hawthorne had 111 yards and one score.\nFriday's contest was a match-up between two of the nation's top offensive teams. Coming into the game, Hawai'i was No. 1 in the country averaging 48.0 points per game and third at 523.9 yards per contest. Boise State, meanwhile, was third with 44.2 points and 10th at 488.7 yards. The Warriors finished the game with 574 yards of total offense and held the Broncos to a season-low 101 yards rushing.\nUH also limited BSU star running back Ian Johnson to 86 yards on the ground. Following a 50-yard dash which put the Broncos up 7–0, the Warrior defense allowed only 19 yards the rest of the game to the Heisman hopeful.\n\"I was a little concerned early when we had the special teams breakdowns\", UH head coach June Jones said. \"But I'm very proud of the kids. They battled through a lot of adversity and hung in there.\" I'm very happy for the state of Hawai'i.\"\nAfter matching the Broncos score with Brennan's record-breaking TD to Grice-Mullen, Hawai'i responded with a 95-yard, seven-play drive, ending in a Brennan keeper from one-yard out. The PAT was blocked, one of two blocked extra points by the Broncos on the night.\nBSU responded on its next drive, retaking the lead, 14–13. The Broncos traveled 69 yards on 11 plays with Johnson taking the pitch and going over the right side for a 1-yard score.\nHawai'i answered the score with Brennan orchestrating an eight-play drive encompassing 67 yards hitting Bess on a 23-yard scoring strike for a 19–14 lead. The Broncos pulled to within two at the half with a 39-yard field goal by Kyle Brotzman.\nThe Warriors took the opening drive of the second half as Brennan completed all six of his attempts for 70 yards with the last 22 going to Bess on a flair to the left flats for a 26–17 lead.\n\"I think by us putting it in the endzone on the first drive, it got everyone pumped up\", Jones said.\nThe Broncos scored 10 straight on a six-yard pass from Tayor Tharp to Rickie Brockel and a Brotzman 36-yard field goal after Brennan was picked for the second time in the game. But that was BSU's last lead as the Warriors scored on consecutive drives to end the third quarter.\nBrennan led the Warriors downfield on 10 plays and 70 yards, culminating on a seven-yard stop route to Rivers for a 32–27 lead. After forcing the Broncos to punt, Brennan then completed consecutive passes of 19 and 28 yards to running back Kealoha Pilares and Bess, respectively, before finally hooking up with Hawthorne on a 38-yard toss.\nNeither team scored in the final period. As UH ran out the clock, fans stormed the field in celebration while the team was awarded the WAC Championship trophy by commissioner Karl Benson.\n\"I told everyone that after eight games, the final four would be the determining factor\", Jones said. \"We got three, we need one more.\"\n*Weekly accolades: WAC Players of the week: QB Colt Brennan (offensive player of the week) and Solomon Elimimian (defensive player of the week).\nWashington\nThe University of Hawai`i football team (12–0, 8–0 Western Athletic Conference) completed an undefeated regular season by rallying past Washington, 35–28, Saturday night at sold-out Aloha Stadium. A raucous crowd watched the Warriors erase a 21-point first half deficit and score the game's final 28 points.\nHeisman Trophy candidate Colt Brennan completed 42-of-50 for 442 yards and five touchdowns, four to wideout Jason Rivers, who also grabbed 14 receptions for 167 yards.\nAfter the Warriors tied the game at 28, Brennan led the game-winning drive, ending with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Grice-Mullen with 44 seconds left.\n\"What a win\", exclaimed UH head coach June Jones. \"(The team) was committed to getting a win tonight. They played hard and I can't be more proud of them. It's unbelievable. The (regular season) could not have ended better.\"\nUW (4–9, 2–7 Pac-10) scored on its first three possessions in the game's first 10 minutes. The first two scores were aided by a UH illegal substitution penalty and a UH fumble. Quarterback Jake Locker scored on an 8-yard run followed by Luke Kravitz's 1-yard plunge. It was Kravitz again finding the endzone from two yards out to make it 21–0. UH fumbled the ball over to UW three times in the opening quarter.\nThe Warriors finally got on the scoreboard with 10:17 left in the second with Brennan hooking up with Rivers on a 7-yard pass to cut the deficit to 21–7. But UW took the ensuing kickoff and traveled 84 yards capped by Paul Homer diving over from a yard out.\nUH made it a 14-point game as Brennan connected again with Rivers on a 3-yard scoring pass. Brennan completed all five of his passes accounting for the 75 yard-drive.\nHawai'i pulled to within seven just before the half when Rivers caught his third touchdown from Brennan, a 13-yarder. Originally, the catch was ruled incomplete, but it was overturned after the review. Brennan completed his final 17 passes of the half, breaking the UH record of 16 set by Jason Whieldon in 2003.\nNeither team scored in the third quarter. UW had a chance, but Ryan Perkins' 38-yard field goal was blocked by Joshua Leonard. The Warriors tied it at 28 when Brennan hit Rivers on a 40-yard streak pass at the 8:01 mark in the fourth.\nThe UH defense came up big in the fourth aided by a huge penalty when Locker passed the line of scrimmage to throw what would have been a first down. Instead, the penalty was tacked on and a loss of down forcing UW to punt and setting up UH's game-winning drive.\nThe drive started at their own 24 and the Warriors marched downfield in eight plays covering 76 yards capped by a five-yard pass to Grice-Mullen with 44 seconds left.\n\"Coach Jones trusted me on that last call\", Brennan said. \"I told coach 'we got 'em' so I changed it to a pass play because I knew they were going to be in man. I've got the most talented receiving corps in the nation.\"\nThe Huskies weren't done just yet. Locker completed a 25-yarder to Michael Gottlieb and a 49-yard bomb to Marcel Reece to the UH four. Two plays later, Locker's pass was deflected by Gerard Lewis and picked off by Ryan Mouton setting off a wild celebration.\n*Weekly accolades: QB Colt Brennan is named the University of Hawaii's most valuable player, WAC's offensive player of the year, and named as a 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist. WR Jason Rivers is named WAC's offensive player of the week. Head Coach June Jones is named WAC's coach of the year and named as a 2007 Eddie Robinson Award finalist.\nGeorgia—Sugar Bowl\nThe 2008 Allstate Sugar Bowl Game was an American college football bowl game.  It was part of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) for the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season, and was the 74th Sugar Bowl.  It was played on January 1, 2008, in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.\nBecause the SEC champion (LSU) was slated to participate in the BCS National Championship Game, the number-five Georgia Bulldogs were selected to host the number-ten, WAC champion Hawaii Warriors, the last undefeated major college football team going into the bowl season.\nThe Warriors were only the third team not in any of the six BCS conferences (not counting major independent Notre Dame) to play in a BCS game.  Boise State qualified for the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, and Utah made the same game two years earlier.  Both teams won their respective games.\nScoring summary\nPre-game\n*Hawaii wins the toss, selects to receive.\nFirst Quarter\n*UGA Touchdown, by Knowshon Moreno, rush for 17 yards.

(10:38) 41–10 UGA\nAftermath\nWith Hawaii's defeat, the 2007–08 college football season ended with no undefeated teams, something that had not happened since the 2003–04 season.  This is also the second time in the BCS era that this has occurred.\nIt also began a streak of three straight bowl game losses for Hawaii, a streak that continued until 2016. As of 2025, Hawaii has had only four winning seasons since 2007, with two 10-win seasons: 2010 and 2019.\nGeorgia DE Marcus Howard was named the MVP of the Sugar Bowl Game, the first time in its history that a purely defensive player has received the honor.\nWith the win, Georgia Head Coach Mark Richt became the first head coach in Georgia history to win more than one Sugar Bowl (his previous victory was over Florida State University following the 2002 season).  Vince Dooley and Wally Butts won one Sugar Bowl each, with Dooley's only win securing the 1980 National Championship.  Dooley lost four other Sugar Bowl games.\nOn January 8, Hawaii Head Coach June Jones left Hawaii to become the head coach at Southern Methodist University.  He signed a five-year contract.\nPersonnel\nRoster\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"\n! # !! PLAYER'S NAME !! POS. !! HT. !! WT. !! CL !! HOMETOWN !! # !! PLAYER'S NAME !! POS. !!
