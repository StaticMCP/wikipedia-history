      "text": "# Treaty of Nettuno\n\nThe Treaty of Nettuno was an agreement made between the governments of Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on 20 July 1925, which permitted Italians to freely immigrate into Yugoslavia's coastal region of Dalmatia. Its ratification in the Yugoslav parliament took three years, as opposition Croatian Peasant Party representatives were infuriated with the treaty, calling it colonization by Benito Mussolini.\nFollowing the assassination of Stjepan Radić, a new ruling coalition under Anton Korošec managed to ratify the treaty by a single vote on 13 August 1928, a move that came too late to placate the Italians yet further outraged the Croats.\nSee also\n* Rijeka\n* Sušak, Rijeka\n* Treaty of Rome (1924)\nReferences\nSources\n*"
