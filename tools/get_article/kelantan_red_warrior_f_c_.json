They  play in the second division of the Malaysian football league system, the Malaysia A1 Semi-Pro League.\nHistory\nFormation and early years\nThe club was founded on 21 December 2024 by the chairman of the Gerakan Selamatkan Kelantan FC (GSK) Nik Hafiz Naim Nik Hassan in a joint venture with the Football Association of Kelantan. On 16 January 2025, Irfan Bakti Abu Salim has been appointed as the club's head coach. On 5 June, the club has been accepted to join the Malaysia A1 Semi-Pro League.\nFIFA investigation, new ownership\nIn July 2025, FIFA issued a notice to Kelantan Red Warrior Football Club, requesting clarification on whether it is the “sporting successor” of Kelantan Football Club, due to outstanding wages and debts from the old club. The club denied any legal or structural ties with Kelantan and stated it was an entirely new club.\nIn August 2025, Nik Hafiz stepped down as the club president and relinquished all interests to facilitate the league registration. Zaki Harun, the former Kelantan chief police officer, was appointed as the new president of the club.\nKit manufacturers and shirt sponsors\nSince 2025, the club had a kit deal with Warrix worth RM 1 million for two seasons.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Kit manufacturer\n!Shirt sponsor (chest)\n|-\n|2025–2027\n| Warrix\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Nasken Coffee\n|-\n|}\nStadium and location\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Coordinates\n!Location\n!Stadium\n!Capacity\n!Year\n|-\n|\n|Kota Bharu\n|Sultan Muhammad IV Stadium\n|30,000\n|2025–present\n|-\n|}\nPlayers\nFirst-team squad\nClub staff\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Name\n|-\n|Head coach|| Irfan Bakti Abu Salim\n|-\n|rowspan=2| Assistant coach|| Kamarudin Anuar\n|-\n| Mohd Sideek Samsudin\n|-\n|Goalkeeper coach|| Ismail Chawalit\n|-\n|Fitness coach|| Ghazali Husin\n|-\n|Physiotherapist|| Wan Muhammad Farid\n|-\n|Team doctor|| Mohd Azaad A.
