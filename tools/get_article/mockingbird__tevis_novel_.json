It was nominated for a Nebula Award for Best Novel.\nPlot\nThe novel begins hundreds of years in the future in Manhattan, where most of the buildings have been razed and its population, as with the world's, is largely depleted. The surviving people are illiterate, and are drugged with pills that makes them apathetic and infertile. That has caused human life on the planet to gradually decline to the point of near-extinction. The surviving humans are survived by android robots, of which Spofforth is the most powerful and sophisticated. No humans have been born in many years and there are no children. Suicide by immolation is rampant, as people have nothing to live for.\nOver the years Spofforth has held many important positions, including head of the entire auto industry, which no longer exists, and mayor of St. Louis. He is now the \"dean of faculties\" of New York University,\nAs the novel begins, Spofforth climbs to the top of the Empire State Building to attempt suicide, but cannot as his programming prohibits suicide. Nevertheless, he has been doing this annually for many years, as he yearns to die.\nSpofforth brings a teacher, Paul Bentley, to New York. Bentley has taught himself to read after a Rosetta Stone–like discovery of a film with words matching those in a children's primer.\nSpofforth begins to dislike Bentley and the knowledge he has acquired from reading. Bentley says he could teach others to read, but Spofforth says that it is illegal and instead gives him a job of decoding the written titles in ancient silent films.\nAt the Bronx Zoo, where the animals are robots, Bentley meets Mary Lou. He explains the concept of reading to her, and the two embark on a path toward literacy.  Spofforth responds by sending Bentley to prison for the crime of reading and takes Mary Lou as an unwilling housemate.  Mary Lou is pregnant with Bentley's child. She learns from Spofforth that he has engineered the demise of the human race because he cannot be allowed to die as long as he can serve humans.\nBentley escapes from the prison, spends some time in a Christian community, and makes his way to New York. There he finds Mary Lou and her baby. She tells Paul that Spofforth has agreed to end the drug-induced depopulation. They climb the Empire State Building together and help Spofforth commit suicide.\nReviews\nAnne McCaffrey commented, \"I've read other novels extrapolating the dangers of computerization, but Mockingbird stings me, the writer, the hardest. The notion, the possibility, that people might indeed lose the ability, and worse, the desire to read, is made acutely probable.\"\nWhen a new edition was published in 1999, with an introduction by Jonathan Lethem, Pat Holt stated that, \"The book often feels like a combination 1984 and Brave New World, with a dash of the movie Escape from New York thrown in.\"\nReviewing the 1999 edition, James Sallis declared that \"Mockingbird collapses the whole of mankind's perverse, self-destructive, indomitable history, cruelty and kindness alike, into its black-humor narrative of a robot's death wish.\"\nFilm adaptation\nOn April 20, 2022, it was announced that Alma Har'el will direct a film adaptation of the book for Searchlight Pictures.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
