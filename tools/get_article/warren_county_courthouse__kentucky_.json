It is an Italianate-style building located at 429 E. 10th St.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.\nIts 1977 nomination proudly asserts its importance as \"the largest and finest post-Civil War Italianate courthouse in Kentucky, as is appropriate for the commercial and educational metropolis of the south central region of the State. Although the interior has been drastically remodelled, the exterior is in virtually unaltered condition and it is still set in a courthouse square enclosed by a Victorian iron fence with limestone posts. An 1874 description rightly stated that the city had, 'next to that at Louisville, the most\nelegant courthouse in Kentucky, built in 1868-69, at a cost of $125,000.'\"\nReferences"
