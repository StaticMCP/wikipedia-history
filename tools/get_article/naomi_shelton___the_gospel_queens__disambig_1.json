The current members are Shelton (lead vocalist), Cliff Driver (pianist and music director), Bobbie Jean Gant, Judy Bennett-Gibbs and Edna Johnson (background vocalists), Gabriel Caplan (guitarist), Fred Thomas (bassist), and Michael Post (drummer).\nMusic history\nTheir first studio album, What Have You Done, My Brother?, was released on May 26, 2009, by Daptone Records.
