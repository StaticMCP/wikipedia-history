(Picasso is credited with having that honor in the first half of the 20th century.)\nLaurie Anderson narrates the movie.\nIn one segment, Burns compares Warhol's portraits of such celebrities as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor with the icons of saints that Warhol saw in his boyhood Byzantine Catholic parish, where he spent many hours as a child.\nBurns follows Warhol through his meteoric rise in New York's commercial art world during the 1950s. Burns cites 1962, the year Warhol first exhibited his soup can paintings in Los Angeles, as the turning point in Warhol's career.\nBurns also describes in detail Valerie Solanas' near-fatal shooting of Warhol in 1968.\nAndy Warhol: A Documentary Film debuted in early September 2006 with a two-week theatrical run in New York City at Film Forum that charged no admission. The movie was televised in the United States over two nights, September 20–21, 2006, on PBS as part of its American Masters series.\nThe film won the a 2006 Peabody Award.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/warhol_a.html PBS American Masters: Andy Warhol]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715182352/http://www.ricburns.com/Warhol_set.swf Ric Burns: Andy Warhol: A Documentary Film]\n* [http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/movies/01warh.html Stephen Holden's review in The New York Times]\n*\n* [http://www.warholcity.com WARHOLCITY - Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art - Medzilaborce, Slovakia (city of origin)]"
