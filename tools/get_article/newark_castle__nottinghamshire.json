Originally a timber castle, it was rebuilt in stone towards the end of the century. The castle was slighted (dismantled) in the 17th&nbsp;century as a result of the English Civil War, and restored in the 19th&nbsp;century, first by Anthony Salvin in the 1840s and then by the corporation of Newark who bought the site in 1889.\nNewark Castle\nHistory\nIn a charter generally thought to date to 1135, King Henry&nbsp;I granted the Bishop of Lincoln permission to build a castle. The charter reads:\n]]\nAlexander also established a mint at the castle. This early castle was most likely of timber construction, and was rebuilt in stone towards the end of the century. King John died after a feast at this castle on the night of 18&nbsp;October 1216 from dysentery, according to tradition from eating a \"surfeit of peaches\".\nThe castle was slighted in 1648 and left derelict. Between 1845 and 1848 architect Anthony Salvin restored the castle, and in 1889 the corporation of Newark purchased the building and carried out further restoration work.\nThe castle is a scheduled monument, a \"nationally important\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade&nbsp;I listed building (first listed in 1950) and recognised as an internationally important structure. The Gilstrap Heritage Centre is located on the castle grounds.  The centre featured exhibits about the castle, and the town's history during the English Civil Wars. The Gilstrap Centre is now the Newark Registration Office. Admission to the gardens is free and tours are conducted by the Castle Ranger.\nFile:Newark Castle, 06-2013 (9).jpg|The castle seen from the west\nFile:Newark Castle, 06-2013 (10).jpg|The 12th-century gatehouse seen from the south\nFile:Newark Castle, 06-2013 (3).jpg|Inside the north west corner of the castle & location of Ranger's Office.\nFile:Newark - Newark Castle - 20240224172042.jpg|The internal wall of the castle.\nThe gatehouse in this was slighted by detonating gunpowder. 19th-century renovation work by Anthony Salvin is denoted by brick.\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in Nottinghamshire\n*Listed buildings in Newark-on-Trent\n*Sconce and Devon Park\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n*\n*Fryde, E.
