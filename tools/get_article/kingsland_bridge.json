The pay and display parking meters along the approach road, also owned by the company, had already only accepted contactless since June 2024. Previously, the toll point machines and parking meters only accepted payment by coins. The introduction of the new system was delayed by about a month with the new machines operational by March that year.\nSee also\n*Crossings of the River Severn\nReferences\nSources\n*Blackwall, Anthony, Historic Bridges of Shropshire, Shropshire Libraries, 1985,\n*Listed status at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222456/http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/planninglist/LBDetail.asp?LBNo=653%2F14%2F2 Borough council]\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"1\"\n| width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" |Upstream:Porthill Bridge\n| width=\"40%\" align=\"center\" |Kingsland Bridge1882\n| width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" |Downstream:Greyfriars Bridge\n|}"
