The other two main editors were John Peter Bernard, whose efforts led to his admission as a Fellow of the Royal Society,  and John Lockman, who undertook a fresh translation of Bayle's work.\nThe publishers were Richard Chandler and Caesar Ward.\nImpact\nThe work has been described as the \"first important ancestor\" of the Dictionary of National Biography.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012314600 All volumes except 5 and 9 at Hathitrust]\n*[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012314601 Volumes 5, 8 and 10 at Hathitrust]"
