The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.\nThe Academy Award for Best International Feature Film was not created until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the academy presented Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards were not competitive, as there were no nominees but simply a winner every year that was voted on by the Board of Governors of the academy. Three Japanese films were recipients of Honorary Awards during this period. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, eighteen Japanese films have been nominated, and two films, Departures and Drive My Car, have won the award. Alongside its three honorary wins, the total of Japanese awarded films is five.'s Rashomon, which was voted the best foreign language film released in the United States in 1951, and received an Honorary Award.]]\nAmong all the countries that have submitted films for the award, Japan ranks fourth in terms of total nominees, ahead of Sweden (fourteen nominees) and the former Soviet Union (nine nominees).\nSubmissions\nEvery year, each country is invited by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to submit its best film for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. The International Feature Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Before the award was created, the Board of Governors of the academy voted on a film every year that was considered the best foreign language film released in the United States, and there were no submissions. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Japan for review by the academy for the award since its inception.\nThe only Japanese directors to have multiple films be nominated for the award are Akira Kurosawa and Noboru Nakamura. Kurosawa received an Honorary Award prior to the inception of the formal award for his work on Rashomon and the actual Academy Award for Dersu Uzala (submitted for the former Soviet Union), and had four other films submitted, with two of them accepted as nominees. Notably, Kurosawa's 1985 film Ran was deliberately not submitted by the Japanese film industry due to the poor perception he had among Japanese filmmakers at the time. Nakamura had two films, Twin Sisters of Kyoto and Portrait of Chieko, nominated.\nIn 2023, German filmmaker Wim Wenders became the first non-Japanese director to have a film selected, the Tokyo set Perfect Days, a homage to Yasujirō Ozu films. It was nominated, marking Japan 18th nomination.\nAll films submitted are in Japanese.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! Year(Ceremony) !!
