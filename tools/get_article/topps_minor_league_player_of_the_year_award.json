It was awarded annually beginning in 1960, but has not been issued since 2013. A newspaper report of the 1972 result, the first tie in the award's history, noted that winners were selected via a poll of minor league baseball writers.\nIt has also been known, circa 1970 onward, as the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, although use of that naming has been inconsistent over time. Namesake J. G. Taylor Spink was publisher of The Sporting News from 1914 until his death in 1962.\nRecipients\nThis section lists players who have won the award, from its inception in 1960 through 2013 when it was last known to have been awarded.
