Kennedy from January 1, 1962, to December 31, 1962.\nJanuary\n* January 11 – Kennedy delivers his second State of the Union address.\nFebruary\n, aboard the Friendship 7 space capsule, becomes the first American to orbit the Earth.]]\n* February 12 – As Commander-in-chief, Kennedy commutes the military death sentence of seaman Jimmie Henderson to life imprisonment, marking the last time in the 20th century that an American president was faced with such a decision (, the most recent such decision was when President George W. Bush decided to deny clemency to Private Ronald A. Gray).\n* February 20 – John Glenn, aboard the space capsule Friendship 7, is launched into an orbital spaceflight by a Mercury-Atlas 6 rocket and becomes the first American to orbit the Earth.\nMarch\n* March 22 – Kennedy signs into law HR5143 (), abolishing the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with a mandatory death sentence for first degree murder, replacing it with life imprisonment with parole if the jury could not decide between life imprisonment and the death penalty, or if the jury chose life imprisonment by a unanimous vote. The death penalty in the District of Columbia has not been applied since 1957, and has now been abolished.\nApril\n*April 6 - \"After yearlong negotiations between steel companies and unions--which involved the personal participation of the president [Kennedy]-- a deal was announced that prevented the rise of steel prices.\" The government's interest in the deal was to control inflation.\n*April 10 - \"U.S. Steel Chairman Roger Blough scheduled a meeting at the White House and stunned the president by informing him that he was going to announce a 3.5 percent price increase, effective at midnight\". Of course this was a betrayal of the recently negotiated deal and would have a ripple effect creating inflation across the economy. Within the next three days, \"the Attorney General Bobby Kennedy announced a grand jury probe of steel price-fixing.\" FBI agents raided the offices of steel executives and by April 12 and 14, they all caved and agreed not to raise their prices.\nMay\n* May 1 – Kennedy signs the [http://current.org/1962/05/educational-television-facilities-act-of-1962-2/ Educational Television Facilities Act] into law, marking the first time Congress provides major federal aid to public broadcasting.\n*May 3 - At dinner at the White House, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. asked President Kennedy what he had said to Roger Blough, Chairman of U.S. Steel. \"I told him that his men could keep their horses for the summer plowing,\" This was a pithy reference to the Gentlemen's Agreement between Generals Grant and Lee that ended the Civil War. Lincoln had instructed Grant to be magnanimous with the Confederates. But, just as the Confederates morphed into rifle clubs and white power groups to \"redeem\" the South after the Civil War, the business community closed ranks against the Kennedy administration, and made common cause against them with the aggrieved cold warriors. CIA agent, Henry Luce invoked the fate of Julius Caesar in a harsh editorial in Fortune, warning JFK that he should \"beware the ides of April.'\n* May 19 – Marilyn Monroe sings Happy Birthday, Mr. President'' to President Kennedy in Madison Square Garden as part of the President's 45th birthday celebrations (his birthday was on May 29).\nJune\n*June 29 – July 1 – Kennedy makes the fifth international trip of his presidency, travelling to Mexico City, Mexico, for a state visit.
