This sculpture was made in 1907.\nThe best example of Rodin’s ‘sketchy’ impressionist sculpture also happens to be his most well-known ‘incomplete’ figure. This work personifies the latter part of Rodin’s career: the dynamic pose of a partial figure. Deriving much from Rodin’s earlier work St. John the Baptist Preaching, including the powerful stance, Rodin had stripped all academic associations from his figure, and instead focused on what he considered essential: the dynamic pose.\nAccording to the bibliography supplied by the National Gallery of Art, The Walking Man is a version of St. John without head and arms. This sculpture was previously considered a preliminary study for the complete Baptist and was based on the movement of that piece. According to Albert Elsen and Henry Moore's suggestions, The Walking Man was created for the purpose of a Roman or Greek art without any live reference.\nPraise\nThe art historian Leo Steinberg said of The Walking Man’s pose:\nThe stance is profoundly unclassical, especially in the digging-in conveyed by the pigeon-toed stride and the rotation of the upper torso. Unlike the balanced, self-possessed classical posture with both feet turned out, Rodin uses the kind of step that brings all power to bear on the moment’s work\nInspiration\nThe statue has served as the inspiration for the works of other artists, such as Carl Sandburg, who described it in his 1916 poem, \"The Walking Man of Rodin\":\nTHE WALKING MAN OF RODIN\nLegs hold a torso away from the earth.\nAnd a regular high poem of legs is here.\nPowers of bone and cord raise a belly and lungs\nOut of ooze and over the loam where eyes look and ears hear\nAnd arms have a chance to hammer and shoot and run motors.\nYou make us\nProud of our legs, old man.\nAnd you left off the head here,\nThe skull found always crumbling neighbor of the ankles.\nSee also\n*List of sculptures by Auguste Rodin\n* List of public art in Houston\nExternal links\n* [http://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/collections/sculptures/walking-man Link to The Walking Man] on the official website of the Musée Rodin.\n* [http://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=M.1966.05.S The Walking Man], Norton Simon Art Foundation Object Number M.1966.05.S: The Walking Man, bronze cast No. 7, edition of 12.\n* [http://cantorcollection.stanford.edu/Obj24006?sid=2150&x=30022The Walking Man], Iris & B.
