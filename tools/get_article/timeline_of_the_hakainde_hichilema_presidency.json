His presidency, as Zambia’s seventh, has focused on economic stabilization, investor re-engagement, infrastructure and energy development, and governance reforms. Notable challenges during his tenure include managing the 2023–2024 cholera outbreak, responding to the worst drought in decades, and navigating political and diplomatic tensions following the death of former President Edgar Lungu in 2025.\nThe timeline below details significant political, economic, social, and diplomatic events from Hichilema’s inauguration through mid‑2025.\n2021: Inauguration and Early Reforms\nAchievements\nHakainde Hichilema was inaugurated on 24 August 2021 after winning the 12 August general election with 59.02% of the vote, marking a peaceful democratic transition of power. His victory ended the six-year rule of Edgar Lungu and was widely hailed as a milestone for Zambia’s democracy.\nUpon taking office, Hichilema prioritized restoring economic stability following Zambia’s historic default on Eurobond debts in 2020 and addressing allegations of widespread corruption under the previous administration. His government initiated engagements with international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, aimed at restructuring Zambia’s external debt and attracting foreign investment.\nThe president appointed a cabinet that blended experienced politicians and technocrats, signaling a commitment to competent governance and professionalized public service delivery.\nChallenges\nHichilema inherited an economy in recession, burdened by high debt levels, double-digit inflation, and significant fiscal deficits. Urgent fiscal and monetary reforms were required to stabilize the currency and restore macroeconomic balance.\nPolitical tensions persisted in the immediate post-election period, with resistance from elements of the previous ruling Patriotic Front (PF) and public skepticism about the new government’s ability to deliver rapid change amid high expectations.\n2022: Economic Recovery and Social Policies\nAchievements\nduring the Official opening of the 2nd Session of the 13th National Assembly.]]\nIn 2022, Hichilema’s administration launched a series of reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy and improving social services. One of the flagship policies was the introduction of free primary and secondary education, which significantly expanded access to schooling across Zambia.\nThe government strengthened anti-corruption measures and implemented governance reforms to improve transparency and accountability within public institutions.\nMajor mining investments were secured, including a US$1.25 billion expansion by First Quantum Minerals at the Kansanshi Copper Mine and the commencement of production at the Enterprise Nickel Mine in Kalumbila, positioning Zambia as Africa’s largest nickel producer.\nOn the international front, Zambia voted at the United Nations to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, signaling a commitment to international norms and multilateral engagement. In April, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a bilateral agreement to develop an electric battery value chain, linking the countries’ mineral wealth to clean energy technologies.\nThe administration also advanced efforts to revitalize regional infrastructure, with plans to upgrade the TAZARA Railway through public-private partnerships.\nChallenges\nDespite notable progress, Zambia continued to experience inflationary pressures and a high cost of living, which affected ordinary citizens. The government faced the ongoing challenge of balancing economic reforms with the need to provide social welfare support to vulnerable populations.\n2023: Strengthening Private Sector and Infrastructure\nAchievements\nIn 2023, the Hichilema administration deepened engagement with the private sector to stimulate job creation and economic growth, resulting in a marked improvement in Zambia’s investment climate. Innovative mining technologies were promoted, attracting non-traditional investors such as KoBold Metals, backed by global technology and climate-focused consortiums. Continued fiscal and monetary measures helped stabilize the macroeconomy and draw increased foreign direct investment.\nThe government also expanded social infrastructure projects, commissioning new clinics, schools, and clean-water initiatives that delivered tangible benefits to rural communities, reinforcing its commitment to inclusive development.\nChallenges\nDespite these gains, Zambia’s economic recovery remained fragile and highly sensitive to global commodity price fluctuations, which periodically undermined investor confidence. Political opposition and episodic civil unrest posed additional tests to the administration’s capacity to maintain social cohesion and policy continuity.\n2024: Consolidation and Security Concerns\nAchievements\nIn 2024, Zambia sustained economic growth, driven by continued mining sector expansion and improved fiscal management. The country gained international recognition when it chaired the African Group of Negotiators at COP27, underscoring Zambia’s growing leadership in climate change discussions and sustainable development.\nDiplomatic relations were strengthened through high-level visits and engagements with key global partners, including the United States, United Kingdom, China, and regional neighbors, enhancing Zambia’s geopolitical standing and economic partnerships.\nChallenges\nIn December 2024, security concerns came to the forefront when two individuals were arrested for allegedly plotting to hex President Hichilema, an incident that drew widespread media attention and highlighted persistent political risks.\nThe government also faced criticism over its efforts to fully eradicate corruption and ensure that economic growth translated into equitable benefits for all Zambians.\n2025 (First Half): Preparing for Re-election and Ongoing Development\nAchievements\nBy mid-2025, significant job creation across key sectors contributed to growing public support ahead of the 2026 general elections. The administration prioritized infrastructure development, with the commissioning of the 100 MW Chisamba Solar Power Plant. and significant progress on the Lusaka–Ndola Dual Carriageway, a transformative road project connecting the capital with Zambia’s key mining and industrial hubs. These projects marked major milestones in the country’s renewable energy and transport agendas.\nIn addition, legislative reforms were advanced to strengthen governance and democratic institutions, including constitutional amendments such as Bill 7, aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability in public office.\nChallenges\nThe government faced the dual challenge of maintaining momentum on economic reforms while managing public expectations for rapid improvements in living standards. Political opposition, though fragmented, remained active in the lead-up to the 2026 elections.\nThe first half of 2025 was also marked by national mourning following the death of former president Edgar Lungu in June, which led to political and legal disputes over the location of his burial.\nReferences"
