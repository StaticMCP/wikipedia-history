Although a narrow majority of valid votes were cast in favour of the proposal (50.7%), the number of invalid votes exceeded the winning margin. Although independence was declared by the Speaker of the Løgting on 18 September 1946, the declaration was not recognised by Denmark. King Christian X of Denmark dissolved the Løgting and called fresh elections, which were won by unionist parties. The islands were subsequently given a greater level of self-rule.\nResults\nBy island\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!rowspan=2|Island\n!colspan=2|Independence\n!colspan=2|Continued Union\n!rowspan=2|Invalid/blank\n!rowspan=2|Total\n!rowspan=2|Registeredvoters\n!rowspan=2|Turnout\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|Norðoyar||956||70.6||398||29.4||64||1,418||2,220||63.9\n|-\n|align=left|Eysturoy||1,052||43.3||1,376||56.7||99||2,527||3,854||65.6\n|-\n|align=left|Norðurstreymoy||622||53.4||543||46.6||42||1,207||1,679||71.9\n|-\n|align=left|Vágar||614||58.6||434||41.4||38||1,086||1,485||73.1\n|-\n|align=left|Suðurstreymoy||1,308||66.0||674||34.0||145||2,127||3,323||64.0\n|-\n|align=left|Sandoy||465||61.9||286||38.1||32||783||1,053||74.4\n|-\n|align=left|Suðuroy||643||26.5||1,788||73.5||61||2,492||3,602||69.2\n|-\n|align=left|Total||5,660||50.7||5,499||49.3||481||11,640||17,216||67.6\n|}\nAftermath\nThe result – without taking the invalid votes into regard – was 50.7% in favour of full independence to 49.3% in favour of home rule within Denmark.\nThe chairman of the Løgting subsequently declared independence on 18 September 1946, but this was not recognised either by a majority of the Løgting or the Danish parliament and government. King Christian X of Denmark dissolved the Løgting on 24 September and called for new elections. The dissolution of the Løgting was on 8 November followed by the Faroese parliamentary election of 1946 in which the parties in favour of full independence received a total of 5,396 votes while the parties against received a total of 7,488 votes. New negotiations followed, and Denmark granted the Faroe Islands home-rule on 30 March 1948.\nSee also\n*Faroese independence movement\n*Faroese language conflict\nReferences\nFootnotes\nSources\n*"
