Diarmaid MacCulloch has tentatively identified John Assheton as the subject of this work. While it contains anti-papal commentary, it is also critical of theological aspects of the Protestant Reformation and the unorthodox sectarian views it ushered in.\n*The Historie of Wyates Rebellion, with the order and manner of resisting the same, London, 1554, black letter, dedicated to Queen Mary. It was one of the authorities on which Raphael Holinshed based his chronicle. This account of Wyatt's Rebellion gives details on the part played in opposing it by Proctor's patron Judde.\n*The Waie home to Christ and Truth leadinge from Antichrist and Errour, 1556, dedicated to Queen Mary; reissued, without dedication, 1565; this is a translation of the Liber de Catholicæ fidei antiquitate, by Vincent of Lérins.\nNotes\n;Attribution"
