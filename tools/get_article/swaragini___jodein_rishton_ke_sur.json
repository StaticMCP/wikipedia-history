Ragini has been raised as a traditional Marwari girl by her single father, Shekhar, and her paternal grandmother, Parvati. Swara and Ragini become friends, but learn they are half-sisters as Swara is Shekhar and Sharmishtha's daughter, who were separated because of cultural differences. Later, Swara and Ragini unite and get Sharmishtha and Shekhar married.\nRagini's fiancé Lakshya falls for Swara, who loves him too. Later, Ragini plans to separate them, but is exposed and soon repents. Eventually, Laksh and Ragini marry after she and Swara expose Laksh's ex-lover Kavya. Swara fakes a marriage with Sanskaar, who hates his family after his fiancée Kavita's death. Later, Sanskaar forgives his family. Through the course of time, Swara and Sanskaar, Laksh and Ragini fall in love. Kavita returns and wants Sanskaar back, but later reunites him with Swara. They confess their love and are married again.\nRajat, eyeing the Maheshwari's wealth, traps Sanskaar's sister, and soon kidnaps Swara, who falls off the cliff while Sanskaar shoots him. She loses her memory but is saved by a rockstar, Sahil, who helps her recuperate. He then becomes obsessed with Swara and tries to kidnap her and kill Sanskar but he is arrested with the help of his mother.\nSharmishtha gets pregnant with Shekhar's child but suffers a miscarriage due to Parvati, who does not want a middle-aged woman having a child. It is then revealed that Sharmishtha gave birth to a boy but Parvati ordered the nurse to abandon the boy on the streets with a beggar. Later, Laksh's brother Adarsh and his wife Parineeta seize the family property and the family is forced to shift to Swara and Ragini's house. Swara and Ragini make them realise their mistake and the family is reunited, but finds that Laksh is missing and is assumed dead. Swara blames Sanskaar and they part ways, with she and Ragini returning to their parents.\nSix months later\nLaksh is alive and lives as Abhimanyu Khanna, with Abhimanyu's wife Mansi and daughter Mishka.
