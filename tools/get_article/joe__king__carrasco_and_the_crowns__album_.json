It was released by Stiff Records (SEEZ 28) on October 10, 1980, in the United Kingdom. An American version with a different track listing and cover design was released by Hannibal Records (HNBL 1308) around the same time.\nCritical reception\nTrouser Press wrote that the band's forte \"is performing '96 Tears' under a variety of thin guises, all of them delightful ('Let’s Get Pretty', 'Betty’s World', you name it). The tempos are revved-up punk, the feeling, Southwestern mestizo.\" Robert Christgau deemed the album \"minimalism with roots, kind of--the irony in these calls to fun is a lot sweeter, a lot surer of its ground, than New Yorkers commonly get away with.\"\nStiff album track listing\nAll listed tracks were composed by Joe \"King\" Carrasco and Johnny Perez; except where indicated\nSide 1\n#\"Buena\"\n#\"Betty's World\"\n#\"I Get My Kicks On You\" (Joe \"King\" Carrasco)\n#\"One More Time\" (Roy Head)\n#\"Don't Bug Me Baby\" (Joe \"King\" Carrasco, Johnny Perez, Brad Kizer)\n#\"Nervoused Out\"\nSide 2\n#\"Caca De Vaca\" (Joe \"King\" Carrasco)\n#\"Susan Friendly\"\n#\"Party Doll\" (Buddy Knox, Dave Alldred, Donny Lanier, Jimmy Bowen)\n#\"Federales\"\n#\"Wild 14\"\n#\"Let's Get Pretty\"\nHannibal album track listing\nSide 1\n#\"Houston El Mover\"\n#\"One More Time\"\n#\"Caca de Vaca\"\n#\"Let's Get Pretty\"\n#\"Bad, Bad Girl\"\n#\"Don't Bug Me Baby\"\n#\"Federales\"\nSide 2\n#\"Buena\"\n#\"Nervoused Out\"\n#\"Betty's World\"\n#\"I Get My Kicks On You\"\n#\"Party Doll\"\n#\"Gimme Sody, Judy\"\nPersonnel\n* Joe \"King\" Carrasco - guitar, vocals\n* Kris Cummings - keyboards\n* Brad Kizer - bass\n* Mike Navarro - drums\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.joeking.com/ Joeking.com]"
