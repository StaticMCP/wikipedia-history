Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew Hampshire voted for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Benjamin Harrison, over the Democratic nominee, former President Grover Cleveland, who was running for a second, non-consecutive term. Harrison won New Hampshire by a narrow margin of exactly 4%. This would be typical of the 1876 to 1892 period, but the state would turn much more Republican in subsequent elections: Cleveland's victories in Carroll and Coös Counties would be the last time a Democrat won those two or any county in the state until 1912.\nWith 51.11% of the popular vote, New Hampshire would prove to be Harrison's fifth strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after neighboring Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. New Hampshire would also be one of four states which Harrison improved in from 1888, the others were Delaware, Georgia and, South Carolina.\nThis would prove one of only two times in its history that a president was elected to a second full term without carrying New Hampshire either time (the other being James Madison in 1812 after also losing the state in 1808).\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{|width=\"65%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Benjamin HarrisonRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |Stephen Grover ClevelandDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |John BidwellProhibition\n! colspan=\"2\" |James Baird WeaverPeople's\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total votes cast\n|- bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Belknap\n| | 2,663\n| | 50.56%\n| | 2,472\n| | 46.93%\n| | 123\n| | 2.34%\n| | 9\n| | 0.17%\n| | 5,267\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Carroll\n| | 2,253\n| | 48.82%\n| | 2,267\n| | 49.12%\n| | 89\n| | 1.93%\n| | 6\n| | 0.13%\n| | 4,615\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Cheshire\n| | 4,024\n| | 56.34%\n| | 2,994\n| | 41.92%\n| | 100\n| | 1.40%\n| | 24\n| | 0.34%\n| | 7,142\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Coös\n| | 2,419\n| | 47.36%\n| | 2,639\n| | 51.66%\n| | 30\n| | 0.59%\n| | 20\n| | 0.39%\n| | 5,108\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Grafton\n| | 4,828\n| | 49.25%\n| | 4,794\n| | 48.90%\n| | 155\n| | 1.58%\n| | 27\n| | 0.28%\n| | 9,804\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Hillsborough\n| | 9,875\n| | 52.08%\n| | 8,785\n| | 46.33%\n| | 215\n| | 1.13%\n| | 88\n| | 0.46%\n| | 18,963\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Merrimack\n| | 6,116\n| | 49.69%\n| | 5,919\n| | 48.09%\n| | 251\n| | 2.04%\n| | 23\n| | 0.19%\n| | 12,309\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Rockingham\n| | 6,380\n| | 50.75%\n| | 5,961\n| | 47.42%\n| | 168\n| | 1.34%\n| | 62\n| | 0.49%\n| | 12,571\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Strafford\n| | 4,666\n| | 51.68%\n| | 4,229\n| | 46.84%\n| | 108\n| | 1.20%\n| | 26\n| | 0.29%\n| | 9,029\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Sullivan\n| | 2,434\n| | 53.84%\n| | 2,021\n| | 44.70%\n| | 58\n| | 1.28%\n| | 8\n| | 0.18%\n| | 4,521\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Totals!!45,658!!51.11%!!42,081!!47.11%!!1,297!!1.45%!!293!!0.33%!!89,329\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nReferences"
