To qualify, the publisher must be located in British Columbia or the Yukon and in full creative control (editing, design and production). The winner, unlike the other prizes which are determined by judges, is selected by ballot sent to bookstores across the province of British Columbia.\nHistory\nThe award is named in honour of BC bookseller Bill Duthie who founded Duthie Books in 1957. It was first awarded in 1985 and was one of the original four prizes awarded by the BC Book Prizes. The prize used to be called \"BC Booksellers' Choice Award in Honour of Bill Duthie\" but the name was simplified in 2010 to align with the other BC Book Prizes.\nWinners and finalists\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Caption text\n|-\n!
