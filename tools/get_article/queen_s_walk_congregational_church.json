A school room was constructed first in 1872-73 to the designs of the architect Thomas Simpson. The church was built in 1900-1902 on the corner of Queen’s Walk and Kirke White Street to designs by the architect Charles Nelson Holloway.\nIt closed in 1970 when it was amalgamated into Friary Congregational Church.\nIt is now the Pilgrim Church.\nReferences"
