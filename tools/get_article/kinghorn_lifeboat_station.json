These were easily launched with just a few people, ideal to respond quickly to local emergencies.\nKinghorn Lifeboat Station was established in 1965, to help provide more cover in the Firth of Forth, as leisure craft became more prevalent in the area at that time. Initially a small \"Hardun\"  type shed structure was constructed to house the lifeboat, a  Inshore lifeboat (D-64), which was launched across the beach by hand.\nThe first launch of the lifeboat in 1965, saw the crew deliver letters to residents of the islands of  Inchkeith and Inchcolm in the Firth of Forth, to inform them of the opening of the lifeboat station.\nMost Inshore stations were initially operational only for the summer months. However, it was decided to maintain winter operations at 20 stations for 1965, where there were reasonable launching conditions, even in poor weather. Kinghorn was one of three such stations in Scotland. The station would also remain in service in the winter of 1966.\nA new pre-cast boathouse was built in 1982, to replace the previous structure. On 10 June 1985 the station received a  Inshore lifeboat (C-514), a faster twin-engine version of the . This boat was also accompanied with a sea-going tractor to assist launching.\nThe station building was altered in 1987, to accommodate both the lifeboat and launch carriage.\nIn 1995 the station was upgraded significantly, with a new two-storey building erected, in preparation to accommodate a larger lifeboat, and the Talus MB-764 County amphibious launch tractor. In addition, the station now had improved lifeboat crew facilities, as well as an operation centre, and visitor souvenir shop. A launch ramp and concrete slipway was installed at the same time.\nOn 29 June 1995, a twin-engine  RIB Inshore lifeboat (B-533) was brought into temporary service for familiarisation purposes. Six months later, on 12 December, the  was replaced with an , Frederick Robertson (B-720).\nCurrent service\nThe  Inshore lifeboat, Tommy Niven (B-836), was brought into service on 22 October 2009, funded from the bequest of the late Mr Thomas Niven.\nIn 2019 a balloon in the shape of the fictional superhero character Iron Man was mistaken for a person in the water off Kirkcaldy. The Kinghorn lifeboat was scrambled and spent an hour searching for the missing person. A local Subaru car dealership later admitted to accidentally allowing the balloon to blow away and made a donation to the station.\nThe station holds an annual sponsored Loony Dook, an event on New Years Day, when locals take a dip in the sea, sometimes in fancy dress, and an open day is held during the summer, both to raise funds for the running of the facility.\nKinghorn lifeboats\nD-class and C-class\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
