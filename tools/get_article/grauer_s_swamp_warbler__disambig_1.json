An investigation of the species population genetic structure revealed three clades across this region: clade 1, Virunga Volcanoes and Kigezi Highlands; clade 2, Rugege Highlands; and clade 3, Kahuzi-Biega Highlands (with clades 2 and 3 being sister groups).  The divergence between these clades is thought to be a result of landscape dynamics and a historic period of aridity.\nThe name commemorates the German zoologist Rudolf Grauer who collected natural history specimens in the Belgian Congo.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=7558&m=0 BirdLife Species Factsheet.]"
