The area lies on the northeastern edge of the Sonoran Desert ecoregion, an arid habitat with annual rainfall of about 16 inches (400 mm). The Salt River runs through this area, providing a rare, year-round source of water.\nCliff dwellings\nWell-preserved cliff dwellings were occupied by the Salado culture during the 13th, 14th, and early 15th centuries. The people farmed in the Salt River Valley and supplemented their diet by hunting and gathering native plants. The Salado were fine craftspeople, producing some of the most flamboyant polychrome pottery and intricately woven textiles to be found in the Southwest. Some of the artifacts excavated nearby are on display in the visitor center museum.\nThe Tonto National Monument Archeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.  The Lower Ruin and Upper Ruin are archeological sites that were NRHP-listed in 1989.\nNatural history\nThe National Monument is surrounded by the Tonto National Forest, which includes low plains, desert scrubland, and alpine pine forests.\nThe Upper Sonoran ecosystem is known for its characteristic saguaro cacti. Other common plants include cholla, prickly pear, hedgehog agave, and barrel cactus (flowering from April to June); yucca, sotol, and agave; creosote bush and ocotillo; palo verde and mesquite trees; an amazing variety of colorful wildflowers in good years (February to March); and a lush riparian area which supports large Arizona Walnut, Arizona Sycamore, and hackberry trees.\nIt also serves as a home for native animals such as whitetail and mule deer, mountain lion, bobcat, three rattlesnake species, and many more.\nWilderness areas\nThe area around Tonto National Monument also includes several designated wilderness areas, including Four Peaks, Superstition, and Salome Wilderness Areas.\nPhoto gallery\nFile:TontoNatlMnmt L7 15jun00.jpg|Landsat 7 image of Tonto National Monument (right center), and the surrounding area\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument-room-detail2.jpg|Tonto National Monument, AZ, Room detail\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument-room-detail4.jpg|Tonto National Monument, AZ, room detail\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument-room-detail3.jpg|Tonto National Monument, AZ, room detail\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument-room-detail.jpg|Tonto National Monument, AZ, Room detail\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument,-hand-prints.jpg|Tonto National Monument, AZ, hand prints on wall\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument-looking-west2.jpg|Tonto National Monument, AZ, looking west\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument-looking-west.jpg|Tonto National Monument, AZ, looking along west face\nFile:Tonto-National-Monument,-facing-east.jpg|Tonto National Monument, looking east\nSee also\n* List of national monuments of the United States\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://apachetrailarizona.com/indian-ruins.html Apache Trail website: Ancient Cliff Dwellings Info]\n* [https://www.nps.gov/tont/ NPS: official Tonto National Monument website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070713134417/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/125tonto/ Tonto National Monument: Saving a National Treasure]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070625090928/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/amsw/ American Southwest, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary]\n* [http://travel.amitbasu.org/2010/a-day-at-the-tonto-national-monument-arizona/ Tonto National Monument: a traveller's diary]"
