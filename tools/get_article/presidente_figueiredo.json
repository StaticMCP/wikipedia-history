The installation of the municipality took place with the general elections of 1982 and consequently with the possession of the mayor and councilors in January 1983.\nGeography\nThe municipality contains the  Caverna do Maroaga Environmental Protection Area, established in 1990.\nIt contains part of the  Uatumã Biological Reserve, a strictly protected conservation unit created in 2002.\nIt also holds about 2% of the Rio Negro Left Bank Environmental Protection Area, a  sustainable use conservation area created in 1995.\nInfrastructure\nHealth\nIn 2009, Presidente Figueiredo had 22 health facilities among hospitals, emergency rooms, health centers and dental services.
