He ran on a platform of smaller class sizes for kindergarten to grade 3, the recruitment of \"talented teachers and administrators\", the renovation and the repairing of schools, having adequate resources for special education, French immersion, and English as a second language, as well as a \"reinvestment in field trips\".
