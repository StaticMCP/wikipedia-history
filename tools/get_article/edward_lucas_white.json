From 1915 until his retirement in 1930 he was a teacher at the University School for Boys in Baltimore.\nHe published a number of historical novels, including El Supremo: A Romance of the Great Dictator of Paraguay (1916), The Unwilling Vestal (1918), Andivius Hedulio (1921) and Helen (1926), but he is best remembered for fantasy horror stories such as \"The House of the Nightmare\" and \"Lukundoo\" that were based on his own nightmares. Two collections of his short fiction were published in his lifetime, The Song of the Sirens (1919) and Lukundoo and Other Stories (1927).\n\"Lukundoo\", White's most frequently anthologized story, is the tale of an American explorer in a remote section of Africa who incurs the wrath of the local witch doctor, who casts a spell on him. Dozens of sore pustules erupt all over the explorer's body. As these develop, it becomes clear that each sore is actually a sort of homunculus: a tiny African man, emerging head-first from within the explorer's flesh. He is able to terminate the development of individual homunculi by beheading them as they develop, but there are too many for him to defeat them all. When other explorers attempt to help, he pleads with them to let him die, accepting his fate as a taunting homunculus pulls itself from the flesh of his upper right chest.\nAs his extensive \"selected bibliography on the history of Paraguay during the days of 'El Supremo,' Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia\" and brief Preface point out, White took great pains to make his historical novel El Supremo quite realistic and historically accurate. As he writes in the Preface: \"The minor characters are mostly also historical. Only Hawthorne, Cecelia and Beltran, the Mayorgas and the Velardes are fictitious.\" He then goes on to list by name about two dozen characters who \"are as authentic as their names\" along with another two dozen or so where he admits \"The first names of these characters, however, it has been found advisable to alter\", mainly because there were just too many \"christened Juan or Jose\", but \"in a romance any one would become hopelessly confused.\" He admits to changing the English Dr. Parlett's name to Tom for effect and gave names to two characters whose names have been lost in the histories: El Pelado's and El Zapo's.\nTwo posthumous collections of his fiction have been published by Midnight House: The House of the Nightmare (12547ac) edited by John Pelan and Sesta and Other Strange Stories (2001) edited by Lee Weinstein.[https://www.myspace.com/leestein.net ] at www.leeweinstein.net  The latter contains mostly previously unpublished and uncollected material.\nDuring 1885 White began a utopian science fiction novel, Plus Ultra. He destroyed the first draft and started over in 1901, then worked on it for most of the rest of his life. The resulting monumental work—estimated by one critic at 500,000 words—remains unpublished, although a portion of it was released separately in 1920 as the novella From Behind the Stars.\nOn March 30, 1934, seven years to the day after the death of his wife, Agnes Gerry, he committed suicide by gas inhalation in the bathroom of his Baltimore home. His last book, Matrimony (1932) was a memoir of his happy marriage to her.\nBibliography\nNovels\n*El Supremo: A Romance of the Great Dictator of Paraguay (1916), copyright renewed by Ethyl White in 1944 and republished, with an introduction by Wayne G.
