      "text": "# On Kings\n\nOn Kings is a collaborative work by anthropologists David Graeber and Marshall Sahlins that addresses the question of kingship.\nPublished in 2017, it is Graeber's eighth book. The work is structured as a collection of essays written by the two anthropologists, presented in the form of a dialogue.\nContents\nThe book opens with a reflection on kingship, noting that it might be the most common political system in human history and is fundamentally religious in nature. It is also described as a political system that is very difficult to abolish, with most modern revolutions merely transferring the attributes of monarchy into the framework of popular sovereignty.\nIn the book, Graeber, influenced by Sahlins, his mentor, argues that:\nThe anthropologist also takes a stand on controversial points in political anthropology; he argues that kingship draws inspiration from the celestial world, rather than the other way around, following Hocart. In this debate, he asserts that 'what is generally considered the divinization of human leaders is, from a historical perspective, better described as the humanization of the god'.\nGraeber and Sahlins propose the hypothesis that the use of ancestors and divine agents to legitimize and consolidate power is a universal tendency among rulers. They refer to this tendency as \"galactic mimesis\".\nLegacy\nThe work is described as \"important and provocative\" by Christopher John Smith.\nReferences"
