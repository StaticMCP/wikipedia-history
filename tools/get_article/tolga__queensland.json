In the , the locality of Tolga had a population of 3,177 people.\nIt is the centre of the region's peanut industry and is home to the Big Peanut ().\nGeography\nTolga is located on the Atherton Tableland. The Kennedy Highway traverses the locality from the north-west to the south of the locality, passing through the town which is in the southern part of the locality. To the north-west of the town is a large residential development which is marketed under the names of Tandara, Rangeview and Panorama Views.\nMapee is a neighbourhood within the centre of the locality (). Yadjin is a neighbourhood in the south-east of the locality ().\nThe Barron River forms the north-east boundary of the locality. The south-western boundary of the locality is the Great Dividing Range which creates the drainage divide that separates the drainage basin of the Barron River (which flows to the Coral Sea) from that of the Mitchell River (which flows to the Gulf of Carpentaria).\nThe northern and eastern parts of Tolga are relatively flat land used for growing crops. The western parts are more mountainous (creating the drainage divide) and are mostly undeveloped. Bones Knob is a peak to the west of the town () at  above sea level.\nThe Tolga Scrub on the southern side of town (within the locality of Atherton, ) is one of the last remaining areas of Mabi rainforest on the Atherton Tableland. It is the most drought resistant type of rainforest in Australia.  The Tolga Scrub is  long and 100 metres wide.\nHistory\nBones Knob is thought to be named after a young Aboriginal man known as \"Bones\", mention in a letter written in February 1879 by Alexander Douglas of the Native Mounted Police to Inspector Stuart of the Queensland Police.\nThe town was originally called Martin Town after sawmillers George and Robert Martin, and grew out of a Cobb and Co staging post at Rocky Creek.\nMartintown Provisional School opened on 10 October 1895. It was renamed Tolga Provisional School in 1905. On 1 January 1909, it became Tolga State School. The school celebrated its centenary in 1995.\nThe town's name was changed to Tolga in 1903 when Tablelands railway line was extended from Mareeba to Atherton and the local railway station was to be called Tolga, a name thought to be derived from the Aboriginal word for either place where the scrub begins or red volcanic soil. The line opened on 10 August 1903. A branch line from Tolga to Yungaburra was built, opening on 15 March 1910, which was subsequently extended in stages to Millaa Millaa by 19 December 1921. The line between Atherton and Mareeba became non-operational on 1 July 2011 and was officially closed  on 15 March 2013. Tolga railway station was between the Kennedy Highway and Lawson Street ().\nMapee takes its name from its railway station, assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 11 January 1915. It is an Aboriginal word meaning tree kangaroo.\nYadjin takes its name from its railway station name, assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 26 June 1922, an Aboriginal word meaning grass pocket.\nDuring World War II in 1943 the Australian Army established their largest storage and repair centre to the west of the town centred on Griffin Road and Tate Road to support the War in the Pacific. It was known as the 13 Australian Advanced Ordnance Depot and was operated by the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps under the command of lieutenant colonel LW Gale with a staff of about 1000 including 200 from the Australian Women's Army Service. The complex had about 150 buildings, including 18 large igloo storage shed. The complex stored, repaired and maintained Army vehicles and vehicle parts, weapons and ammunition, and clothing.\nMost buildings on the site were removed in 1946 after the war had ended with one building being relocated to the Atherton Hospital for the use of the Queensland Country Women's Association. On Friday 29 November 1946, three Army personnel were working to remove cordite from the shells in the ammunition dump when the cordite ignited in a blinding flash. The three men were severely burned in the explosion but managed to crawl over a mile to their headquarters. Although they were rushed to the Atheron hospital, the three men died and were buried at the Atherton War Cemetery.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Tolga had a population of 843 people.\nIn the , the locality of Tolga had a population of 2,426 people.\nIn the , the locality of Tolga had a population of 2,718 people.\nIn the , the locality of Tolga had a population of 3,177 people.\nHeritage listings\nTolga has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Bones Knob Radar Station, Bowcock Road\n* Rocky Creek World War Two Hospital Complex, Kennedy Highway\nEducation\nTolga State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at Main Street ().
