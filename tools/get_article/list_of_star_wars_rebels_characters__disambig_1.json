The series follows a motley group of rebels conducting covert operations to thwart the sinister Galactic Empire, including Kanan Jarrus, Hera Syndulla, Ezra Bridger, Zeb Orrellios, Chopper, and Sabine Wren. The 2023 live-action series Ahsoka serves as a direct continuation of Rebels, following on from the events of its series finale.\nOverview\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: white\" | &nbsp;\n| Starring\n|-\n| style=\"background: lightgrey\" | &nbsp;\n| No appearances\n|}\nNote: Only characters appearing over multiple seasons appear in this list.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"16%\" | Character\n! colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | Season\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" | Ahsoka\n|-\n! align=\"center\" width=\"10%\" | Season 1\n! align=\"center\" width=\"10%\" | Season 2\n! align=\"center\" width=\"10%\" | Season 3\n! align=\"center\" width=\"10%\" | Season 4\n|-\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"|\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"|\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"|\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"|\n! style=\"background:ivory;\"|\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightblue;\" |\nMain cast\n|-\n!

The episode \"Empire Day\" reveals he was born the same day Palpatine inaugurated the Galactic Empire.\nAt the start of the series, his main motivation is to find his parents. In the pilot episode the Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus decides to take him as his apprentice. In \"Path of the Jedi\", Ezra is formally inducted into the Jedi Order, when Yoda's voice helps him to find a kyber crystal to create his first lightsaber, which after being constructed, is blue and features a built-in stun blaster patterned after his street urchin trademark weapon, an energy slingshot. In the second-season episode \"Legacy\", he discovers that his parents were killed in a prison revolt. In \"Shroud of Darkness\" it is revealed Kanan fears Ezra might turn to the dark side, which partially happens when the former Sith Lord Maul draws him closer in \"Twilight of the Apprentice\", and in further episodes also keeps calling him \"apprentice\", showing a marked interest in him. His first lightsaber is also destroyed by Darth Vader. In the season 3 premiere episode \"Steps Into Shadow\", Ezra replaces it with a green-bladed lightsaber. In the same episode, Ezra is promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Commander of the Phoenix Squadron, and also assumes field leadership of the Ghost crew, due to Kanan's blindness preventing him from continuing the role. However, due to his reckless leadership at the time, he was suspended from command as Lieutenant Commander until further notice. The episodes \"Shroud of Darkness\", \"The Holocrons of Fate\" and \"Twin Suns\" reveal Ezra's main motivation of the third season, to \"find the key to destroying the Sith\", who he interprets as the exiled Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. After eventually finding and talking to Kenobi however, Ezra realized his true mission is to be with the other rebels and help them fight against the Empire. During the season 3 finale, by taking command of a squad during the battle against Grand Admiral Thrawn's fleet, it shows that at this point, Ezra's status as Lieutenant Commander has been fully restored.\nEzra becomes somewhat lost after the death of his master Kanan, but begins to understand Kanan's final lessons after he penetrates the Jedi Temple in \"A World Between Worlds\". His connection to the Force-sensitive creatures of Lothal increases, and in the penultimate episode \"A Fool's Hope\" and the one-hour series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\" (both of which aired March 5, 2018), Ezra summons both the Loth-Wolves and the Purrgil to defeat Thrawn, Pryce, and the Imperial forces on Lothal. Because the Purrgil have shattered the bridge observation ports on Thrawn's Star Destroyer, onto which he has been taken, Ezra uses the Force to create a protecting air pocket for himself and Thrawn, and deliberately and selflessly allows himself to be taken away with Thrawn by the Purrgil.\nOn his character, Gray stated: \"He's a pickpocket, he's a little thief. But he's doing it all because he needs to survive\". Executive producer Greg Weisman said: \"We see this whole series very much through Ezra's eyes. As his eyes get opened to what the Empire's capable of, his eyes are opened to the fact that there are people who care, who are trying to fight the good fight, and he becomes one of them.\"\nThe character made his live-action debut in the series Ahsoka (2023), portrayed by Eman Esfandi, in which he depicted as having been living in another galaxy on the same planet as Thrawn for over a decade.\nKanan Jarrus\nKanan Jarrus (voiced by Freddie Prinze, Jr.), call sign Spectre 1, is one of the last surviving Jedi of the fallen Republic whose real name is Caleb Dume. The episode \"Legacy\" reveals that Kanan entered the Jedi Order before getting to know his parents. The comic Star Wars: Kanan explores how before the events of Rebels, Caleb Dume is a human Jedi Padawan student of Jedi Master Depa Billaba, until Order 66 made the clone troopers betray and kill the Jedi Order, including Kanan's Master.\nDuring the Dark Times, Caleb is forced to take the identity of Kanan instead of his real name, in order to hide his Jedi heritage to survive, as explored in the book Star Wars: A New Dawn which also explains how he met Hera Syndulla a few years before the events in Rebels. At the beginning of Rebels, Kanan is the co-leader of the Ghost crew with Hera. Despite Kanan having not finished his own Jedi training himself, after seeing the potential in Ezra Bridger, he decides to take him as his Jedi Padawan. In \"The Lost Commanders\" he initially finds it difficult to trust Captain Rex, due to having experienced Order 66. In \"Shroud of Darkness\", Kanan was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight by a vision within a Jedi Temple on the planet Lothal. In the episode \"Twilight of the Apprentice\" after visiting the planet Malachor, Kanan is blinded by Maul. While still part of the missions and his Force abilities compensating for his acquired handicap, he is from then on forced to take a less active role as a leader. Season 4 confirmed Kanan and Hera as a romantic couple.\nIn the episode \"Jedi Night\", Kanan sacrifices himself while rescuing Hera from being killed by Governor Pryce in the year 0BBY. In the following episode \"DUME\", Ezra has a vision of a giant Loth-Wolf with a white trident-shaped mark on its forehead that introduced itself as Dume (voiced by \"The Force\"). Dume directs Ezra into traveling to the Lothal Temple with the surviving Ghost crew. The wolf is later assumed by Ahsoka in the episode \"A World Between Worlds\" as an extension of Kanan's will through the cosmic Force into the Loth-Wolves to teach Ezra a final lesson and prevent both the final and the most powerful secrets of the Lothal temple from being fully compromised. Sometime after his death and before the Battle of Endor, Hera gives birth to their son Jacen Syndulla.\nExecutive producer Dave Filoni describes the character as a \"cowboy Jedi\". Animation supervisor Keith Kellogg said: \"He is a Jedi but he's not a Jedi in the traditional sense that we've had before on the show. He's a little more rough around the edges. He's kept his lightsaber locked away, so he hasn't used it in a long time.\" After being blinded, Kanan has been compared to the Star Wars Legends character Rahm Kota from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, another Jedi who was blinded, which led Pablo Hidalgo from the Lucasfilm story group to say on Twitter, that both characters were inspired by Zatoichi.\nHera Syndulla\nHera Syndulla (voiced by Vanessa Marshall), call sign Spectre 2, is a Twi'lek from the planet Ryloth who is the owner and pilot of the Ghost. She is the daughter of Cham Syndulla, who appeared in the episode \"Liberty on Ryloth\" of Star Wars: The Clone Wars before reappearing on Rebels. She and Kanan share a strong connection; in season 4, they are confirmed to be lovers, and episode 15 introduces their son Jacen Syndulla. Hera has trained herself as a pilot of outstanding skill, known to some as \"one of the best star pilots this side of the Outer Rim.\" commanding the respect of friends and foes alike. In \"Wings of the Master\", Hera was promoted to Captain of the Phoenix Squadron by Kanan's recommendation, and in \"Rebel Assault\" she has advanced in rank to General.\nIn the 2016 film Rogue One a voice is heard asking General Syndulla to report to a meeting in the Rebel Base of Yavin IV, confirming her rise to the rank of General. The Ghost is among the ships seen during the dogfight over the atmosphere of Scarif, but it is unknown if Hera was piloting her ship during such events, as Dave Filoni said: \"I can imagine doing that entire [Scarif] battle from their point of view, whoever is on the Ghost at that point.\"\nHera also stars in the animated micro-series Star Wars Forces of Destiny, an animated short features Hera teaming up with Princess Leia, Han Solo and Ewoks, while on the forest moon of Endor. This was also confirmed in the 2018 series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\", where it is revealed that she fought in the Battle of Endor and that she and Kanan have a son named Jacen Syndulla.\nHera reappears in the videogame Star Wars: Squadrons as the superior officer of former Imperial Captain Lindon Javes and Vanguard Squadron, overseeing the development of the first prototype of the Starhawk class of New Republic battleships some time after the Battle of Endor.\nA younger Hera appears in Star Wars: The Bad Batch with Chopper in the episode \"Devil's Deal\". In this appearance, she has more of a French accent.\nHera returned in the 2023 series Ahsoka, portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.\nFiloni has stated: \"She is a very strong-minded character, kind of the heart of the group, keeps everyone together when they would otherwise fall apart\".\nSabine Wren\nSabine Wren (voiced by Tiya Sircar), call sign Spectre 5, is a 16-year-old Mandalorian graffiti artist, Imperial Academy dropout and a former bounty hunter with expert knowledge of weapons and explosives. As a member of the Ghost crew, she acts as their chief engineer and cargo transport, weapons and demolitions expert, as well as their linguist, being fluent in a wide variety of languages. Originally a dedicated student and fledgling inventor for the Empire, she deserted when one of the weapons she had created was planned to be used against her own people.\nIn \"The Protector of Concord Dawn\", Sabine is revealed to come from House Vizsla, thus leading her to be related with Death Watch, a Mandalorian terrorist group in The Clone Wars. The episode \"The Antilles Extraction\" reveals she was the one who helped pilot Wedge Antilles defect from the Empire and join the Rebellion. The episode \"Imperial Supercommandos\" reveals her mother, Ursa Wren, is sided with the Empire.  In \"Visions and Voices\", Sabine acquires the Darksaber, a weapon used by Death Watch and also by Darth Maul during the Clone Wars. In \"Trials of the Darksaber\", Sabine's past is fully revealed, and Kanan trains Sabine in lightsaber combat (Sabine does not use The Force). By the next episode, Sabine decides to stay with her family in order to help unite the clans against the Empire. Sabine returns to the group in \"Zero Hour\" when Grand Admiral Thrawn leads his forces to attack Atollon.\nIn the series finale epilogue, it is revealed that Sabine stayed on Lothal, living in Ezra's tower. Earlier in the episode, Ezra told her that \"I can always count on you\", which she took to mean that he needed her to stay on Lothal and protect his people; however, in the epilogue, she understands what Ezra really meant and joins Ahsoka Tano in finding him and bringing him home.\nSabine also stars in the animated micro-series Star Wars Forces of Destiny.\nCG supervisor of lighting and FX Joel Aron said, \"She's adding something that we haven't really seen before in the Star Wars universe. You have a character that is expressively creative through art—whether it's the color of her hair or what she's done to her armor.\"  Her last image in the series finale is with deep purple hair cut short.\nIn November 2021, Deadline Hollywood announced that Natasha Liu Bordizzo had been cast to portray Sabine in live-action in the 2023 series Ahsoka.\nGarazeb \"Zeb\" Orrelios\nGarazeb Orrelios (voiced by Steven Blum), call sign Spectre 4, nicknamed \"Zeb,\" is a Lasat who was the Captain of the Lasan High Honor Guard. His people were one of the first species to rise up against the Empire in its early days. The Imperial response was a genocide campaign against them. This near-extinction has left him with a gruff demeanor, but he has remained loyal to the struggle against the Empire, eventually to discover that his fellow Lasat still exist as a culture on their hidden homeworld of Lira San in the episode \"Legends of the Lasat\". In season 3, Zeb is revealed to have become Phoenix Squadron's Chief of Security, which was mentioned in the episode \"Warhead\".\nZeb is known for the frequent use of the Lasat expletive \"Karabast!\" used as an expression of surprise or frustration. His common expletive was heard in the 2016 film Rogue One from the character Pao during the Battle of Scarif. The Ghost is among the ships seen during the dogfight over the atmosphere of Scarif, it is presumed Zeb was on board the ship along with Hera and Chopper as Dave Filoni said: \"I can imagine doing that entire [Scarif] battle from their point of view, whoever is on the Ghost at that point.\" and all three heroes remained in the Rebellion until at least after the Battle of Endor.\nHis physical appearance is based on Ralph McQuarrie's original conceptual artwork for Chewbacca. Art director Kilian Plunkett said: \"Zeb actually is very articulate and witty and funny, and that's sort of juxtaposed with what he looks like, makes for an interesting character\".\nIn the series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\", Zeb takes part in the final battle against Grand Admiral Thrawn and Governor Pryce on Lothal, where he engages in a second confrontation with Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh, which ends with him electrocuting the assassin as he traps him on to the coils of a shield generator conductor just before they were activated. Sometime after the Battle of Endor, Zeb brings Kallus to Lira San where the Lasat are currently living. He returns in the third season of The Mandalorian, again voiced by Blum.\nChopper\nC1-10P, nicknamed \"Chopper\" (voiced by Dave Filoni, credited as \"Himself\" prior to the series finale), call sign Spectre 3, is an irritable astromech droid owned by Hera, who recovered and reconstructed the droid after it crashed on Ryloth during the Clone Wars. The droid's nickname Chopper is derived from its name resembling the word \"CHOP\" when written out.  In the 2016 film Rogue One the character has a brief cameo moving around the Rebel Base on Yavin IV, confirming his survival until at least that point. In the episode \"An Imperial Feast\" from Star Wars Forces of Destiny, Chopper makes an appearance alongside Hera, revealing that he survives up until the events of Return of the Jedi, which is confirmed in the epilogue of the series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\" where he is seen aboard the Ghost with Hera and Kanan's son Jacen Syndulla.\nChopper's design is heavily modeled on the original conceptual artwork for R2-D2. Describing the character, Filoni said, \"He likes to do things the way that he wants, not necessarily the way the crew wants or as fast as the crew would like, but he gets the job done. He's incredibly loyal\". Chopper is also summarized as, \"If R2-D2 is your favorite dog, Chopper is the cat\". For Chopper's live action cameo, Matt Martin, a member of Lucasfilm Story Group, served as the on-set operator of Chopper.\nChopper returned in the 2023 live-action series Ahsoka, again voiced by Filoni. Unlike in Rebels, Chopper's dialogue is less muffled, allowing everything he says to be audible.\nMembers of the Rebel Alliance\nThe following are members of the Rebel Alliance:\nWedge Antilles\nWedge Antilles (voiced by Nathan Kress) is a former Imperial TIE fighter pilot turned Rebel pilot who appears throughout the original film trilogy. He encounters an undercover Sabine at the Imperial Pilot Academy and later defects along with his friend Hobbie to the Rebel Alliance.\nSaw Gerrera\nSaw Gerrera (voiced by Forest Whitaker, reprising his role from Rogue One) is the leader of a rebel cell who helped lead the resistance movement to victory over the Separatist occupation of the planet Onderon during the Clone Wars once trained by Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Clone Captain Rex. But liberation resulted in the death of Saw's sister Steela, and eventually Onderon was lost to the Empire, turning him into an extremist rebel. In the two-part episode \"Ghosts of Geonosis\", Saw is sent with a squad to Geonosis by the Rebellion to investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian race. After being rescued by the Ghost crew after his team was taken out by Separatist droids controlled by a frightened Geonosian survivor, he later set up his partisan cell and continued to investigate the nature of the super weapon the Empire created in secret.\nZare Leonis\nZare Leonis (voiced by Bryton James) is a cadet at the Imperial Academy, where his sister Dhara disappeared due to apparent Force-sensitivity. He stays in the academy as a spy in order to find her, as well as to feed information to the rebels, until he is himself taken by the Grand Inquisitor.\nMon Mothma\nMon Mothma (voiced by Genevieve O'Reilly, reprising her role from Episode III) is the former Senator of Chandrila in the Republic and later Imperial Senates. In \"Secret Cargo\", she defects from the Empire following her speech condemning the Ghorman Massacre and is pursued by Imperial forces with the Ghost crew and Gold Squadron providing an escort as she formally gathers the Rebel Alliance at Dantooine. She later speaks with Ezra in \"Zero Hour\" and she informs him that they are unable to send reinforcements to Atollon, as doing so would play into Grand Admiral Thrawn's hands.\nMart Mattin\nMart Mattin (voiced by Zachary Gordon) is a young human Rebel pilot who was in Hera Syndulla's fighter squad during their ultimately ill-fated attack on Lothal City's Imperial base in \"Rebel Assault\". He is the only other Rebel pilot besides Hera and Chopper to survive the battle and escape captivity, and is later on retrieved to join the Lothal Rebel cell in their guerilla fight against the Empire. Appearing mostly in cameo roles, he has a slightly expanded role in the series' finale when he implements a secret plan devised by Ezra Bridger to bring in a pod of Purrgil against Admiral Thrawn's fleet.\nMattin's name is a tuckerization of Matt Martin, a member of Lucasfilm Story Group.\nQuarrie\nQuarrie (voiced by Corey Burton) is a Mon Calamari engineer living on the planet Shantipole. He built the prototype B-wing, the Blade Wing, which was gifted to Hera in \"Wings of the Master\", and later oversaw the secret construction of more B-wings for the Rebel Alliance at Senator Organa's request.\nHe is named after Star Wars concept artist Ralph McQuarrie.\nCommander Sato\nCommander Jun Sato (voiced by Keone Young) is the leader of the Phoenix Squadron rebel cell. In \"Zero Hour\" Pt. 1 during the fight against Grand Admiral Thrawn's forces at Atollon, Commander Sato decides to open an escape corridor for Ezra by executing a kamikaze strike against an enemy vessel. With two volunteer crew members staying on board, Commander Sato leads them on a collision course against Admiral Konstantine's Interdictor cruiser, which kills the remaining crews of both ships.\nAP-5\nAP-5 (voiced by Stephen Stanton) is a former Galactic Republic analyst droid and navigator during the Clone Wars, who was reduced to being an inventory droid on Imperial Cargo Transport 241. He sides with the Rebels and assists them in finding a suitable base after developing an unlikely friendship with Chopper.\nAhsoka Tano\nAhsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) is a Togruta and former Padawan of Anakin Skywalker who left the Order out of disillusionment with the Jedi Council for not defending her while on Republic trial for crimes she did not commit. Following the establishment of the Galactic Empire, having originally hid and crafted a pair of white lightsabers, Ahsoka became a key informant of Senator Organa under the codename \"Fulcrum\". Ahsoka relayed intelligence to the Lothal rebels prior to revealing herself to them in the season 1 finale \"Fire Across the Galaxy\". After her rebel cell Phoenix Squadron was nearly extinguished by Darth Vader in \"The Siege of Lothal\", she and her remaining followers join the Ghost. In \"Shroud of Darkness\", Ahsoka is forced to accept Darth Vader is her corrupted former master. In \"Twilight of the Apprentice\", Ahsoka takes Ezra and Kanan to Malachor to search for Sith knowledge. She later sacrifices herself to buy Ezra and Kanan some time to get away from Darth Vader, forcing him to fight her as the Sith temple collapses on top of them.\nAhsoka reappears in the fourth-season episode \"A World Between Worlds\", revealed to have been momentarily removed from time during the Sith temple's destruction when Ezra pulled her through a time-space doorway just as Vader was about to kill her, ending up in the void between time and space which Ezra entered through another portal at the Jedi temple on Lothal. She stops Ezra from an impulsive attempt to change fate by trying to save Kanan from his own demise, just as he had saved her, before the Emperor attacks them through the breach the Lothal portal has created. Promising Ezra to find him, Ahsoka escapes back through the Malachor portal, leading to the ambiguous end shown in \"Twilight of the Apprentice\", where she is seen walking away from the ruins of the Sith temple.\nIn the epilogue of the series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\" which takes place after the Battle of Endor, she reappears again to join Sabine in searching the galaxy for Ezra.\nAhsoka reappeared in the second season of The Mandalorian, portrayed by Rosario Dawson.\nCaptain Rex\nCaptain Rex (CT-7567) (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) is a Clone trooper captain who served under Anakin Skywalker in the Clone Wars. After the Clone Wars subsided and being one of the few to have not participated in Order 66, Rex and his fellow clones made their home in exile in the Outer Rim's planet Seelos, living in a still-operational six-legged AT-TE walker on Seelos' surface, before they are discovered by the Lothal Rebels and Rex agrees to aid the Rebel forces.\nIn the epilogue of the series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\", it is revealed that he fought alongside Hera at the Battle of Endor.\nOrgana family\nBail Organa\nSenator Bail Organa (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is the Senator of planet Alderaan, owner of the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, and secretly one of the leaders organizing the Rebel Alliance. After discreetly using the droids to inspect the Lothal rebel cell in the first episode \"Droids in Distress\", he sends a small fleet of frigates to aid the escape of the Lothal rebels in the season 1 finale, recruiting them to the greater rebellion. He periodically reappears to send supplies and give the Ghost crew missions. In \"Twin Suns\", it is revealed that he publicly confirmed the death of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, though this was done to protect Kenobi's mission and location on Tatooine.\nPrincess Leia Organa\nPrincess Leia Organa (voiced by Julie Dolan in the second season and archival audio of Carrie Fisher in the fourth season) is the princess of the planet Alderaan, Bail Organa's adopted daughter, and (unbeknownst to both herself and the majority of the galaxy) Darth Vader's biological daughter.\nFiloni stated: \"One of the complex challenges of depicting Leia in Rebels is that we have to remind the audience that at this point she is part of the Empire. She does not believe in the Empire, but she is acting the part, almost a double agent.\"\nR2-D2 and C-3PO\nR2-D2 (voiced by Ben Burtt) is an astromech droid and C-3PO (voiced by Anthony Daniels) is a protocol droid built by Anakin Skywalker. During the series, both droids are owned by Bail Organa who has tasked R2-D2 with secret missions to undermine Imperial activities, appearing in \"Droids in Distress\". Prior to the rise of the Empire, both droids were owned by the deceased close friend of Bail Organa named Padmé Amidala.\nMembers of the Galactic Empire\nThe following are members of the Galactic Empire:\nSith\nEmperor Palpatine\nEmperor Palpatine (voiced by Sam Witwer in the 'original' airing of Season two) / (Ian McDiarmid in Season four and then Season two as of 2019) is the Emperor of the Galactic Empire and Darth Vader's Sith Master Darth Sidious, having orchestrated his rise to power as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic along with engineering the Clone War and the removal of the Jedi Order once the war ends and he restructures the Republic into the Empire. After learning from Vader that Ahsoka Tano is among the rebel forces, Palpatine orders Vader to capture her as she may know the whereabouts of surviving Jedi while sending an Inquisitor after the Rebels. In \"A World Between Worlds\", he attempts to use Ezra to access the world between worlds to manipulate the Galaxy's timeline to his design. But he fails to catch Ezra as he closes the gateway.\nIn the series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\", Emperor Palpatine uses a hologram masked in the image of his former self when Grand Admiral Thrawn brings Ezra to him. He attempts to tempt Ezra into reactivating what remained of the gate by presenting him the moment in time when Ezra's parents were still alive. But Ezra emotionally releases his parents and destroys the gate to Palpatine's dismay.\nDarth Vader / Anakin Skywalker\nDarth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones and Ben Burtt as Darth Vader, Matt Lanter as Anakin Skywalker, archive audio of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in the fourth season) is the Imperial army's cyborg Sith commander and a former Jedi corrupted by Emperor Palpatine.\nHe first appears in his second chronological appearance in \"Fire Across the Galaxy\" where he appears before Grand Moff Tarkin and Agent Kallus sometime after the Grand Inquisitor's death. He later appears in the season 2 premiere movie \"The Siege of Lothal\", after Tarkin requests assistance against the Jedi presence in the rebels. Vader then wipes out most of the rebel cell in the Lothal system, injures half the Ghost crew, destroys Ezra's home and a community of displaced people on Lothal and has Minister Tua murdered with the rebels blamed for the crime. After learning Ahsoka Tano—his former Jedi apprentice—is among the rebels, Vader is ordered by the Emperor to dispatch another Inquisitor to go after her in hopes of using her to find the remaining Jedi. Ahsoka later learns of Vader's identity through a vision in a Jedi temple on Lothal, where Vader arrives after it is claimed by the Inquisitors. He then journeys to Malachor and attempts to claim the ancient Sith weapon hidden there, only to face Ahsoka in battle after claiming to have destroyed Anakin. He later emerges alone from the ruins. In \"Shroud of Darkness,\" he appears as his former self—Anakin Skywalker, hero of the Clone Wars and Ahsoka's former Jedi master—as both a vision to Ahsoka and a holographic recording providing lightsaber instructions, found within Kanan's holocron. Skywalker's voice is also heard briefly in a duel between Vader and Ahsoka in \"Twilight of the Apprentice\" after Ahsoka slices Vader's helmet open. unbeknownst to himself, Princess Leia Organa is actually his biological daughter.\nThe character's first chronological appearance was the extended cold opening that was added to ABC's broadcast of \"Spark of Rebellion\" on October 26, 2014, where he orders the Grand Inquisitor through a communications hologram to hunt down the remaining Jedi and try to lure any Force-sensitive children they take as their Padawans. Filoni stated: \"We wanted to do something special for the ABC broadcast. We've added a scene which gives audiences insight into the Inquisitor and includes a cameo by Darth Vader, voiced by the distinguished actor James Earl Jones.\"\nInquisitors\nThe Imperial Inquisitors are Force-sensitive \"Dark Side Adepts\" of the Galactic Empire, who are sanctioned by and answer only to Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. Highly skilled in assassination, espionage, interrogation, and target acquisition, their task is to hunt down the remaining Jedi as well as any children with Force potential. All of the Inquisitors are armed with gyroscopic double-bladed lightsabers, based on an unused concept from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed video game.\nThe Grand Inquisitor\nThe Grand Inquisitor (voiced by Jason Isaacs) is a Pau'an Inquisitor. The Grand Inquisitor first appeared in the extended cold opening of \"Spark of Rebellion\", where he is ordered by Darth Vader to hunt down any Jedi who survived Order 66 and lure to the dark side any Force-sensitive children the Jedi may have taken as Padawans or destroy them if they refuse. The Grand Inquisitor saw the opportunity to do so when called by Agent Kallus to help him hunt down the rebels after Kanan is revealed to be a Jedi. After being defeated by Kanan in \"Fire Across the Galaxy\", he kills himself by falling into an exploding reactor core. It is later stated by Dave Filoni that he did this because he was more afraid of facing Vader's punishment for his failure.\nAs the Seventh Sister revealed in \"Always Two There Are\", the Grand Inquisitor's death left an opening for the other Inquisitors to compete to take his place.\nIn \"Shroud of Darkness\", his spirit appears to Kanan in the temple on Lothal and reveals that he was once a member of the Temple Guard and thus, a fallen Jedi Knight.

The three later attacked the Jedi and Maul again during their bid to reach the top of a Sith temple containing a Holocron that would activate its superweapon mode, with the Eighth Brother demonstrating a new saw feature built into the Inquisitor lightsaber. However, the Eighth Brother's lightsaber was damaged during his battle with Kanan.

It is later revealed that his hatred of Lasats stems from a harrowing encounter with a Lasat mercenary in his early ISB years, where he was the sole survivor of his unit. Despite his antipathy for Lasats, Kallus respects them as warriors and in fact bears a degree of remorse over the fact that genocide was used to conquer Lasan. He is also a highly trained hand-to-hand combatant and carries a rare Lasat bo-rifle which was given to him by a Lasat Honor Guard he defeated in single combat when their homeworld fell to the Galactic Empire.\nOn Vader's orders, Kallus sets up Minister Maketh Tua's murder by rigging her shuttle to explode.

Filoni stated: \"You couldn't have grown up a Star Wars fan without encountering Thrawn in Heir to the Empire. It was a dark time when there weren't any more movies, and it blew our minds that there could be more\" when illustrating how important the character was for the expanded universe and the impact of bringing the character back into canon.\nDuring the final battle on Lothal, Thrawn engages Ezra on his Star Destroyer, which is then entangled by the Purrgil that drag it into hyperspace to an unknown location.\nMikkelsen reprise his role in the live-action 2023 series Ahsoka.\nCommandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint\nCommandant Cumberlayne Aresko and Taskmaster Myles Grint (both voiced by David Shaughnessy) are Imperial officers stationed on the planet Lothal.

Pryce later ventures to Skystrike Academy to find defecting pilots. After the defectors attempt a botched escape led by rebel Sabine Wren, Pryce interrogates and fights Sabine, only to be electrocuted by her, and the defectors escape. Pryce arrives on Lothal with Thrawn to investigate the sabotage of Imperial equipment. After Thrawn uncovers and kills rebel Morad Sumar, Pryce and the staff put the factory on lockdown, only for the Jedi rebels, Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus to escape with info about a new TIE fighter project with the help of rebel spy Agent Kallus, who later frames Pryce as the Rebel Spy, leading Lyste to shun her. In \"Zero Hour\", she learns of Kallus's treason after Thrawn exposes him and later assists Thrawn during the battle of Atollon.

He decides not to join the Rebellion for the moment, projecting their chance of victory as minuscule.\nForce wielders\nMaul\nMaul (voiced by Sam Witwer) is a Zabrak former Sith Lord and apprentice to Emperor Palpatine, having lost his position when Obi-Wan Kenobi defeated him in The Phantom Menace. Maul resurfaced during the Clone Wars and attempted to set up a criminal empire before Palpatine personally dealt with him. Ending up on the run and his race no more after the Nightsisters' slaughter by the Separatists, Maul travels to the planet Malachor where he meets Ezra while seeking an underground Sith temple. Despite having a mutual enemy in the Inquistors by killing the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, Maul reveals his true intentions and desire to take Ezra as an apprentice. After Maul blinds Kanan during the resulting scuffle, he ultimately escapes Malachor in one of the Inquisitors' TIE Fighters after the temple is destroyed. He would later return in the third season to claim both the Jedi and Sith Holocrons to peer into the future, escaping once more with only a faint image of a man he had assumed dead: Obi-Wan Kenobi. For the first time in a long while, this gives Maul clarity and purpose: to find and kill his old adversary. After talking Ezra into a using a Nightsister ritual to access the other's mind for the rest of the vision in \"Visions and Voices,\" Maul's only clue of finding Obi-Wan is on a desert planet with twin suns. Although he succeeds in finding his old rival in \"Twin Suns\", he is ultimately cut down after a short duel. The dying Maul learns that Obi-Wan is protecting \"the Chosen One\". He states that \"he will avenge us,\" finally letting go of his hate for Obi-Wan, and dies in his old enemy's arms.\nThe Bendu\nThe Bendu (voiced by Tom Baker) debuted in the season 3 episode, \"Steps Into Shadow\". Bendu was a Force-sensitive individual who resided on the remote planet of Atollon and represented the \"center\" of the Force, between the light side and the dark side. \"Jedi and Sith wield the Ashla and Bogan. The light and the dark. I'm the one in the middle. The Bendu...\" stated Bendu. The term \"Bendu\" first appears in the original script for Star Wars as the name of the Jedi Knights, the \"Jedi-Bendu\". In his first appearance, he teaches Kanan how to get along with the krykna hexapod spiders that roam the planet, following Kanan's blinding by Maul on Malachor, with the Sith Holocron becoming entrusted to The Bendu afterwards. In \"The Holocrons of Fate\", Ezra and Kanan return to retrieve it from him in order to save their friends from Darth Maul, during which he warns them that combining the knowledge of the Sith and Jedi Holocrons can be dangerous. In the two-part episode \"Zero Hour\", Bendu tells Kanan that he will not help him upon Grand Admiral Thrawn bringing war to Atollon since he is neutral and his anger worsens when Kanan calls him a coward. He later creates a storm to attack the Imperials and Rebels to force them off the planet, buying the Ghost crew some time to get away while he is shot down by AT-AT fire. When Thrawn shot at him, Bendu disappears, leaving Thrawn with a prophecy of his eventual defeat when \"many arms surround him in a cold embrace\". Bendu's prophecy comes true in the series finale \"Family Reunion – and Farewell\" when Thrawn's Star Destroyer is removed from Lothal by the Purrgil.\nThe Presence\nThe Presence (voiced by Nika Futterman) is housed inside a Sith Holocron used to gain access to an Ancient Sith Temple found on Malachor. The voice of the holocron tries to convince Ezra to use the Temple to gain absolute power to use against his enemies. During Ahsoka's battle with Vader, Kanan and Ezra work together to remove the holocron from its base, destabilizing the entire temple in the process as the collected energy releases explosively and collapses the structure. Ezra later opens the Holocron and learns dark side secrets from the Presence, before the Holocron is taken by Kanan and entrusted to the Bendu. Ezra and Kanan later recover it and brought it to a meeting with Maul. The merging of this Holocron and Kanan's Jedi Holocron allow Ezra and Maul to see a vision, but the encounter is disrupted, causing both Holocrons to shatter and presumably destroying the Presence.\nThe White Loth-Wolf\nThe Loth-Wolf (voiced by \"Himself\") is a member of a rare predatory species on Lothal, who resemble giant Earth wolves as tall as a human and are in tune with the Force residing on Lothal. This specific Loth-Wolf is differentiated from his kin by a white coat and his ability to formulate singular words in Galactic Common. Though indifferent to the conflict between the Rebellion and the Empire, he and the other Loth-Wolves, aware of the grave threat the latter posed, assist the Ghost crew, particularly Kanan and Ezra, in their struggle against it. He first appears in the fourth-season episode \"Flight of the Defender\".\nJedi\nObi-Wan Kenobi\nObi-Wan Kenobi (voiced by James Arnold Taylor as a young man, Stephen Stanton and Alec Guinness as the older \"Ben Kenobi\") is a former General of the Clone Wars and the original Jedi Master of Darth Vader who appears throughout the original and prequel trilogies. A younger version of Obi-Wan broadcasts a holographic message declaring the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order after Order 66 while warning any surviving Jedi to lay low. Kenobi broadcasts this warning off-screen in Revenge of the Sith, but it is shown in the first episode of Rebels. A holocron bearing Kenobi's message is among Kanan's possessions. Getting the holocron to work is used by Kanan as a test for Ezra's Force potential in \"Spark of Rebellion\".\nIn the episode \"Holocrons of Fate\" while Ezra is studying the Holocrons to determine how to destroy the Sith, Maul sees in the Holocrons that Obi-Wan is still alive. In the episode \"Visions and Voices\", Maul and Ezra both discover that Obi-Wan Kenobi is in hiding on a desert planet with twin suns. In \"Twin Suns\", Maul travels to Tatooine with the goal of killing Obi-Wan, luring Ezra to the planet in an attempt to draw out Obi-Wan. After rescuing Ezra from the planet's harsh desert conditions, Obi-Wan Kenobi gives the young rebel advice regarding his true mission. Obi-Wan then guides Ezra off the planet before engaging and killing Maul in a duel. Before Maul dies, Obi-Wan confirms to him that his purpose on Tatooine is to protect the \"Chosen One.\" The threat now eliminated, Obi-Wan continues his secret mission of watching over a young Luke Skywalker (the secret biological son of Darth Vader) whom he believes to be the \"Chosen One\", destined to bring balance to the Force and defeat the Sith.\nWhen Ezra enters the Lothol Jedi Temple in \"A World Between Worlds,\" Obi-Wan's voice is among those heard. Ezra later calls out to both Obi-Wan and Yoda believing they might be present.\nYoda\nYoda (voiced by Frank Oz) is the 900 year old Jedi Master, who went into exile on Dagobah following the Jedi Purge. Though he is mentioned numerous times by Kanan, Ahsoka, and Ezra thought the series, he first appears as a disembodied voice in \"Path of the Jedi\" where he guides Ezra through the Jedi Temple. In \"Shroud of Darkness,\" Yoda appears before Ezra (and later Ahsoka) in a vision of a starfield and instructs him to find Malachor.  When Ezra enters the Lothal Jedi Temple in \"A World Between Worlds\" Yoda's voice is among those heard. Ezra later calls out to both Obi-Wan and Yoda believing they might be present.\nFiloni stated: \"I felt personally to keep Yoda as this disembodied thing it would confuse the audience less. I didn't want you to think Yoda could be teleporting from planet to planet\".\nIncidental characters\n2-1B\n2-1B is a medical droid who first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back, tending to Luke Skywalker in the bacta tank after the Wampa attack on Hoth, and replacing Luke's hand, to Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, and again to other characters in Star Wars Rebels.\nJan Dodonna\nJan Dodonna (voiced by Michael Bell) is a general and leader of the Rebel base on Yavin IV, who previously appeared planning the starfighter attack on the first Death Star in A New Hope. returning in Rogue One, Rebels, and several issues of Marvel's comic series Star Wars, being the first character to utter the phrase \"May the Force be with you\".\nGonk Droid\nThe Gonk Droid, also known as the GNK power droid, is a boxy, rectangular-shaped droid that walks very slowly.
