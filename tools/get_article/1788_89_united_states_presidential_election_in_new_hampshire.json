Voters chose five representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew Hampshire unanimously voted for independent candidate and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, George Washington. The total vote was composed of 1,759 for Federalist electors, all of whom were supportive of Washington. Several candidates of unknown affiliation also received votes.\nVoters voted for electors on December 15, 1788, through a general ticket. As no elector candidate received the \"requisite number for a choice,\" the election went to the legislature, which selected the five best-performing elector candidates from the top ten on January 7, 1789.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1788–1789 United States presidential election in New Hampshire\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent\n| George Washington\n| align=\"right\" | 1,759\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 5\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 1,759\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 5\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nReferences"
