Samuel Nutt bought the original tracts of land for a Coventry with partners William Branson and Mordecai Lincoln, the great-great grandfather of Abraham Lincoln. The furnace was managed by George Taylor when the first Franklin stoves were cast here. The furnace operated through the 1860s and supplied the iron used in the iron-clad ship the USS Monitor during the Civil War. The  historic district was listed by the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\nA historical marker on the site reads:\nSeveral other sites listed by the National Register of Historic Places are located within a couple of miles of the site, including Hockley Mill Farm, to the east on Warwick Furnace Road, Warrenpoint to the north, Reading Furnace Historic District and Warwick Mills to the west, and Brower's Bridge upstream (west) on the South Branch of French Creek. Warrenpoint was owned by Nutt's partner William Branson and both are considered early iron pioneers.\nIn 2015, the French & Pickering Creeks Conservation Trust permanently protected the  Warwick Furnace Farm through conservation easements and the acquisition of , which will be the future home of a public preserve.\nThe ironmaster's house and workers' houses, the historic farmhouse and the barns in this historic district are currently used in the operation of a working farm.\nGallery\nFile:Warwick barns.JPG|Barns on the farm\nFile:Bridge 246 Chesco.jpg|Bridge just south of the farmhouse built 1913 over the South Branch of French Creek\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Chester County, Pennsylvania\n* List of Washington's Headquarters during the Revolutionary War\n* Reading Furnace\n* Robert Grace\nReferences"
