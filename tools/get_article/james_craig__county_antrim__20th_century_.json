Although outside the establishment of the Ulster Unionist Party, he was nonetheless able to gain local representation as an Independent Unionist, serving as a member of Carrickfergus Borough Council from  1962 onwards, including a spell as deputy mayor from 1973 to 1974. He also served as a member of the Northern Ireland Housing Council from 1973 to 1974.\nHe attempted to gain election to the Parliament of Northern Ireland for Carrick in the 1969 election but lost to the UUP's Anne Dickson However Craig's profile rose somewhat with the formation of the DUP in 1971. He was a founder member of the party and also sat on its executive until his death, whilst chairing the Carrickfergus branch of the party. As a consequence Craig was elected to the 1973 Assembly for North Antrim and was DUP chief whip.\nReferences"
