The treaty was signed in Kathmandu on 31 July 1950 by the last Rana Prime Minister of Nepal, Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana, and the Indian ambassador to Nepal, Chadreshwar Narayan Singh, and came into force the same day as per Article 9 of the Treaty. Rana rule in Nepal ended just 3 months after the treaty was signed. The treaty allows free movement of people and goods between the two nations and a close relationship and collaboration on matters of defence and foreign policy.\nProvisions\nThe India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship was signed by the last Rana Prime Minister of Nepal, Mohan Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, and the Indian Ambassador to Nepal, Chandreshwor Narayan Singh on 31 July 1950 and came into force the same day. It has ten articles. The treaty provides for everlasting peace and friendship between the two countries and the two governments agree mutually to acknowledge and respect the complete sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of each other.\nAs per Articles 6 and 7, the two governments agree to grant, on a reciprocal basis, to the nationals of one country in the territories of the other, the same privileges in the matter of residence, ownership of property (requires RBI permission), participation in trade and commerce, movement and other privileges of a similar nature. This enables Nepalese and Indian citizens to move freely across the border without passport or visa, live and work in either country and own property or conduct trade or business in either country. There are a large number of Indians living, owning property and working or doing business in Nepal as a beneficial aspect of the treaty for India. Reciprocally, many Nepalese live, own property and conduct business freely in India.\nFor centuries, Nepal remained in self-imposed isolation. After the 1860 treaty with the East India Company, Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal allowed Indians to purchase and sell land in Nepal's Terai. After the ascent of Mt. Everest by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, Nepal completely lifted its ban on foreigners.\nThe King of Nepal enacted the Citizenship Act of 1952 that allowed Indians to emigrate to Nepal and acquire Nepalese citizenship. But as more and more Indian immigrants from Bihar started acquiring Nepalese citizenship, most Nepalese became resentful of this provision.\nText of the Treaty\nArticle 9\nThis Treaty shall come into force from the date of signature by both Governments.\nArticle 10\nThis Treaty shall remain in force until it is terminated by either party by giving one year's notice.\nDone in duplicate at Kathmandu this 31st day of July 1950.\n(Signed)\nChandreshwar Prasad Narain Singh\nFor the Government of India\n(Signed)\nMohan Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana\nFor the Government of Nepal\nPrepared by LP}}\nBackground\nThe Himalayan Nation of Nepal borders northern India in the south, east and west. During British rule in India, Nepal's ties with the British government were governed by the 1816 Treaty of Sugauli that was replaced by the 1923 \"Treaty of perpetual peace and friendship\" or  Nepal–Britain Treaty of 1923.  After the independence of India in 1947, the two nations sought to forge close strategic, commercial and cultural relations. The rise of Communist China in 1949 and the subsequent invasion of Tibet heightened security concerns in both India and Nepal. India had maintained good relations with Tibet, but the Rana rulers of Nepal feared that China would support the Communist Party of Nepal and sponsor a communist revolution that would overthrow their autocratic regime.\nWith heightening concerns over the security threat to India presented by Communist China, which was seen as seeking to project power and influence over Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan and China's border disputes with India, the latter sought to strengthen its \"Himalayan frontier\" by forging an alliance on defence and foreign affairs with the Rana rulers of Nepal.\nCriticism\nThis treaty is called unequal by most Nepalese since Nepalese law does not permit an open border, and Indians, by law, should not be able to buy lands and properties in Nepal or carry out businesses in their names. They claim that the 1950 treaty was signed by undemocratic rulers of Nepal and can be scrapped by a one-year notice. The treaty has been unpopular especially among Pahari segments of Nepal, who often regard it as a breach of Nepal's sovereignty. Also, agreements were manipulated in the favour of antidemocratic autocratic rule of Nepal, where the power of the people is fragmented.\nDeterioration of bilateral relations\nAlthough initially supported enthusiastically by both the Rana rulers and Indian establishment, the treaty became the subject of increased resentment in Nepal, which saw it as an encroachment of its sovereignty and an unwelcome extension of Indian influence. After an abortive attempt in 1952 of the Communist Party of Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana rule with Chinese backing, India and the Rana regime stepped up military and intelligence cooperation under treaty provisions, and India sent a military mission to Nepal which was regarded by leftist Nepalese as an undue extension of Indian influence in Nepal. In the late 1950s and the 1960s, after the advent of democracy in Nepal, Nepal's relations with China improved, while its relations with India deteriorated. Nepal forced the Indian military mission to leave, and both nations began ignoring the treaty provisions.\nNepal was temporarily brought closer to India after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, but it resented the growth of India's regional power in the 1970s. The extensive Indian trade and economic influence was also resented by some in Nepal. In 1975 after the annexation of Sikkim by India, Nepal began openly lobbying for renegotiation of the treaty and proposed itself as a Zone of Peace between India and China, where military competition would be off-limits. India refused to endorse the proposal.\nProposed scrapping\nUpon forming a coalition government after the 2008 Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Pushpa Kamal Dahal said on 24 April 2008 that the 1950 treaty would be scrapped and a new pact would be negotiated with India. However, he did not pursue the matter and had to resign as prime minister within nine months. However, in 2014, both India and Nepal agreed to \"review\" and \"adjust\" the peace treaty to reflect the current realities.\nNepal India Open Border Dialogue Group\nPeople of Terai region of Nepal and Indian state of Bihar formed a group Nepal India Open Border Dialogue Group. Initially the group formed to understand the issue related to flooding in Nepal India Border later the group started advocating for open border and organised several seminar.\nRevision of the Treaty\nIn January 2021, Nepal Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said, that Nepal wants India to  review and revise the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty to reflect the changes and new realities.\nSee also\n*India–Nepal relations\n*Common Travel Area, a similar treaty existing between the UK and Ireland on freedom of movement.\n*Union State, a similar treaty existing between Russia and Belarus on freedom of movement.\nExternal links\n*[http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/3/9/00004432.pdf Text of the Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship]\nReferences"
