The Italian Second Army, aiming for the town of Gorizia, was able to capture the hilly area around Oslavia () and San Floriano del Collio () overlooking the Soča (Isonzo) and Gorizia itself. The Italian Third Army, covering the rest of the front up to the sea, launched a series of large attacks which brought no significant gain.\nMount Sei Busi was unsuccessfully attacked by Italians five times.\nThe intensity of the fighting increased until the end of November, when the bridgehead of Tolmin () was heavily shelled and casualties peaked. In the first fifteen days of December, however, the fighting was reduced to small scale skirmishes as opposed to the massive frontal assaults that characterized the previous phases of the battle.\nAn unsigned truce on the Karst Plateau was made as the temperatures dropped, and operations were ceased due to lack of supplies.\nThe Austro-Hungarian High Command, worried by huge losses, requested assistance from the German Empire, which was not yet formally in the war against Italy. German Empire intervened on the Italian Front in eleventh battle of the Isonzo.\nSee also\n*Scipio Slataper\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Macdonald, John, and Željko Cimprič.
