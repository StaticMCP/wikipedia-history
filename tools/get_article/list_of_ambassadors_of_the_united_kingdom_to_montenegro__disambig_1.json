In 2003 the FRY was reconstituted as a state union officially known as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The British ambassador to Serbia was also accredited to Montenegro. The union was dissolved in June 2006 when Serbia and Montenegro declared themselves independent countries, and a British embassy was then established in Podgorica.\nMinisters resident\n* 1893–1906: Mr Robert John Kennedy, CMG\nAmbassadors\n* 2006–2007: Mr John Dyson MVO\n* 2007–2009: Mr Kevin Lyne\n* 2009–2013: Ms Catherine (Kate) Knight-Sands\n* 2013–2017: Mr Ian Whitting OBE\n* 2017–2020: Ms Alison Kemp\n* 2020–2023: Ms Karen Maddocks\n* 2023–: Ms Dawn McKen\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/world/montenegro UK in Montenegro], Foreign & Commonwealth Office"
