The Qing troops were already weakened by their defeat at Wuchang, therefore making the city easy to capture.\nOn October 22, 1911, the Hunan Tongmenghui members were led by Jiao Dafeng (焦達嶧) and Chen Zuoxin (陳作新). They led an armed group consisting partly of revolutionaries from Hongjiang and partly of New Army units in a campaign to extend the uprising into Changsha. They then captured the city and killed the local Qing Imperial general. Then, they announced the establishment of the \"Hunan Military Government of the Republic of China\" and announced their opposition to the Qing Dynasty and support for a Chinese republic.\nReferences"
