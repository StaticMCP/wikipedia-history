He is the son of Sandra Stewart and stepson of Robert Stewart. Stewart's biological father, Leonard Hawkins, is black, a fact which Stewart learned when he was about 12 years old. His stepfather sang in a Scarborough rock band named \"The Wizards of Id\", formed at Woburn Collegiate Institute where both Steven Page and Ed Robertson would later attend. He credits his parents' relative youth (they were only 19 when he was born) with exposing him to interesting music which was frequently played around the house when he was young. He has claimed that his unique eyebrows are the result of his shaving them off when he was eight years old.\nStewart is a graduate of Huron Heights Secondary School. He received a Bachelor of Applied Arts degree in Radio and Television Arts from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Toronto Metropolitan University) in 1989, making him the only member of Barenaked Ladies to have earned a degree.\nStewart was a member of The Ambassadors Drum and Bugle Corps, playing bongos and pit percussion from 1979–1980, and tri-drums from 1980 to 1982. He was the drummer for cowpunk/rockabilly band Pogo Rodeo and later 3 Day Bender in the late 1980s. When he met the Barenaked Ladies, at a buskers' festival, he was drumming for the Would Be Goods, a Guelph acoustic duo featuring stage actor Christine Brubaker, and singer Chris Reynolds.\nBarenaked Ladies\nIn the summer of 1990, Stewart met Steven Page, Ed Robertson, and Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies at the Waterloo Busker Carnival in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.  The band's then-percussionist, Andy Creeggan, was on hiatus with the band and they had been interested in adding a formal drummer who used a drum kit, as Creeggan played congas.  Stewart joined the band and, when Creeggan returned, Creeggan switched to mostly playing keyboards.\nStewart is the only band member who does not actively write songs for either the group or outside projects. He has received a writing credit on only three songs in the band's catalogue: \"Grade 9\" from Gordon, \"Why Say Anything Nice?\" from Barenaked Ladies Are Men (co-written with Page and Robertson), and \"Allergies\" from Snacktime! (lyrics co-written with Kevin Hearn, music written by all five then-members). Up until the 2009 departure of lead singer Steven Page, Stewart had sung lead on only two recorded songs. Stewart sings lead on \"Allergies\" and a cover of \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" which was cut from Barenaked for the Holidays. Stewart also sings lead on a version of \"Feliz Navidad\" which the band has performed live for holiday shows since 2004. The song has also been played on other occasions with the word \"navidad\" replaced by lyrics relevant to the event (such as \"Feliz Ships and Dip\", and \"Feliz Halloween\", among others). Stewart assumed some of Page's vocal responsibilities for live performances, including \"Alcohol\" from Stunt. Stewart also sings the chorus on the song \"Four Seconds\" from All in Good Time.\nPersonal life\nStewart's wife, Jill (née Spratt), is a former high school French teacher, and the two were married on September 19, 1998; they have three daughters, Mili, born April 2, 1999, Hazel, born April 16, 2001, and Carmen, born January 28, 2011. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking. He is an ice hockey fan and actively promotes Women's Hockey in Canada, serving on the board of The Ladies First Hockey Foundation and coaching his daughters' teams, one being The George Bell Titans. Stewart also went to high school with former Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph where the two became friends. He also enjoys playing hockey, and is a member of the Jokers Hockey Club in the Canadian Exclaim! Hockey Summit of the Arts. Stewart is also an occasional panelist/contributor on the post-game show for Hockey Night in Canada, and an on-air contributor to the morning show on The Fan 590. He took part in Super Skate, a celebrity hockey game fundraiser at Madison Square Garden for the Christopher Reeve Foundation in 1999, 2001 and 2002.  Participants included Denis Leary, Kim Alexis, Rick Moranis, Chris Jericho, Gary Dell'Abate, Chad Smith, Darren Pang and Jason Priestley, among others. Stewart is a member of the Canadian Charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them on campaigns like radio PSAs.\nStewart is the first cousin of Kevin Yarde, a former television presenter for The Weather Network and the current Member of Provincial Parliament for Brampton North in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.barenakedladies.com Barenaked Ladies Official Website]"
