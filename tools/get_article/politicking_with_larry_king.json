The guests of the show included various political figures and world leaders. The series was available on Ora TV, Hulu, and RT America. The show was distributed worldwide by RT America and Ora TV; the latter also produced another show hosted by King from 2012 to 2020, Larry King Now, which focused on interviews with celebrity guests.\nThe show received criticism because it airs on the RT America network, which has frequently been described as \"pro-Russian\"; it has also been alleged that it has been used as a \"Kremlin's propaganda tool\". King addressed such claims by saying: \"I don't work for RT. It's a deal made between the companies. They just license our shows,\" and also adding that \"to [his] knowledge\" the network has never altered any interviews that he has done, \"If they took something out, I would never do it.  It would be bad if they tried to edit out things. I wouldn’t put up with it.\"\nA number of guest hosts stood in for Larry King, including Matthew Cooke.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ora.tv/politicking Politicking with Larry King] on Ora TV"
