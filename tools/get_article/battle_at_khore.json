Mian Deen Muhammad Kalhoro, who had succeeded his father, Mian Nasir Muhammad Kalhoro in 1692, wanted to compromise and surrender, but his younger brother, Yar Muhammad Kalhoro, refused, leading to a battle. The Mughal army was commanded by Gaj Singh Bhatti, Raja Surajmal Udhepuri, and Raja Udhey Singh (who died over the course of the battle). However, the Mughal army defeated the Kalhora force.\nReferences"
