The ceremony was hosted by CMA Award winner Luke Bryan.\nBackground\nAfter a video clip surfaced in early 2021 showing an inebriated Morgan Wallen using a racial slur the Country Music Association announced on May 21, 2021, that Wallen's 2021 CMA Awards eligibility would be limited to, “categories that honor artistic works (Single, Song, Album, Musical Event, and Music Video of the Year categories), so as not to \"limit opportunity for other credited collaborators,\" but the press release further states that Wallen would not be eligible in solo categories as Entertainer of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year.\nOn October 1, 2021, the CMA announced that Wallen would not be allowed to attend the 2021 ceremony or any of the pre-show pageantry, despite being nominated in the Album of the Year category. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, CMA CEO Sarah Trahern said she didn't believe anyone had ever been disqualified from the show due to conduct before. \"Honoring him as an individual this year is not right, and he will not be allowed on the red carpet, on our stage, or be celebrated in any way,\" she says.\nOn October 18, 2021 it was announced by the CMA that Luke Bryan will host the ceremony for the first time. This is the first time the ceremony has had a solo host in 18 years, the last being Vince Gill.\nThe CMA announced that ticketed audience members would have to prove full vaccination status against COVID-19 and wear appropriate face coverings. Performers and presenters was not expected to follow the same requirements as the audience.\nWinners and nominees\nThe eligibility period for nominees is July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. The nominees were announced on September 9, 2021.\nWinners in Bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85;\" width=\"50%\" |Entertainer of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85;\" width=\"50%\" |Album of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Luke Combs\n** Eric Church\n** Miranda Lambert\n** Chris Stapleton\n** Carrie Underwood\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Starting Over — Chris Stapleton\n** 29 — Carly Pearce\n** Dangerous: The Double Album — Morgan Wallen\n** Heart — Eric Church\n** Skeletons — Brothers Osborne\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Male Vocalist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Female Vocalist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Chris Stapleton\n** Dierks Bentley\n** Eric Church\n** Luke Combs\n** Thomas Rhett\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Carly Pearce\n** Gabby Barrett\n** Miranda Lambert\n** Ashley McBryde\n** Maren Morris\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Vocal Group of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Vocal Duo of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Old Dominion\n** Lady A\n** Little Big Town\n** Midland\n** Zac Brown Band\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Brothers Osborne\n** Brooks & Dunn\n** Dan + Shay\n** Florida Georgia Line\n** Maddie & Tae\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Single of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Song of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* \"Starting Over\" — Chris Stapleton\n** \"Famous Friends\" — Chris Young and Kane Brown\n** \"The Good Ones\" — Gabby Barrett\n** \"Hell of a View\" — Eric Church\n** \"One Night Standards\" — Ashley McBryde\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* \"Starting Over\" — Mike Henderson and Chris Stapleton\n** \"Forever After All\" — Luke Combs, Drew Parker and Robert Williford\n** \"The Good Ones\" — Gabby Barrett, Zach Kale, Emily Landis and Jim McCormick\n** \"Hell of a View\" — Casey Beathard, Eric Church and Monty Criswell\n** \"One Night Standards\" — Nicolette Hayford, Shane McAnally and Ashley McBryde\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |New Artist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Musician of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Jimmie Allen\n** Ingrid Andress\n** Gabby Barrett\n** Mickey Guyton\n** HARDY\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Jenee Fleenor, fiddle\n** Paul Franklin, steel guitar\n** Aaron Sterling, drums\n** Ilya Toshinsky, banjo\n** Derek Wells, guitar\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Music Video of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Musical Event of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* \"Half of My Hometown\" — Kelsea Ballerini (feat.
