He was Professor of Botany and Plant Physiology, University of Melbourne 1938&ndash;1973, and was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1956. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1974.\nHe is sometimes referred to as \"John Stuart Turner\".\nTurner was the first President of the Science Teachers' Association of Victoria and for twenty-five years chaired the General Science Standing Committee of the Schools Board that controlled both the syllabus and the examinations. In 1945 Turner introduced Biology as a senior school subject in Victoria, replacing both Botany, and Animal Morphology and Physiology. He chaired the Biology Standing Committee of the Schools Board for thirty years, culminating in the production, through the Australian Academy of Science, of 'The Web of Life' course that completely re-conceived the purpose, structure and function of biology teaching in Australia.\nReferences"
