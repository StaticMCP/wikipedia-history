Among these artifacts is a remarkably well-preserved mummy. Several archeology students and their professor have been tasked with preparing them for display and study. While preparing the artifacts one of them steals an amulet from the mummy and presents it as a gift to his paramour, unaware that fellow student Norman has witnessed the entire exchange.\nUnbeknownst to the rest of the group, Norman is descended from Aztec priests and had been planning on taking the amulet himself, so he could complete a ritual to Tlaloc. He resurrects the mummy in order to retrieve the amulet and begins killing all of the others. During the chaos the remaining students discover that the planned ritual would bring about an apocalypse. Eventually only two, Stacey and Don, remain. The mummy kidnaps Stacey to serve as a virgin sacrifice. Don manages to rescue Stacey by interrupting the ritual and smashing the amulet, after which he kills Norman and the mummy. He then frees Stacey and the two wander away from the museum, apocalypse averted.\nCast\n* Trent Latta as Norman\n* Jeff Peterson as Don\n* Ariauna Albright as Stacey\n* Michele Nordin as Janine (as Michelle Erickson)\n* Russell Richardson as Arlando\n* Michael Lutz as Morris\n* Brenda Blondell as Professor Cyphers\n* Christopher Cullen as Scott\n* Christopher Bergschneider as The Mummy (as Anton Falk)\nProduction\nAn international co-production between The United States and Mexico, produced by the American production company Kremlin Films and the Mexican production company Azteca Catrinca S.A.
