In the Carter administration from 1977 to 1981, he served as Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs, Secretary to the Cabinet, and White House Chief of Staff.  He chaired the President's Interagency Coordinating Council created by Executive Order in 1978 to coordinate implementation of the President's domestic policy.\nWatson had earlier been a protege of Charles Kirbo and a highly successful trial lawyer at King & Spalding in Atlanta. He had served as a close aide to Carter during his gubernatorial campaigns and was particularly close to Carter’s mother, “Miss Lillian.”  Charismatic, classy and inspirational, Watson characteristically told transition staff at its first meeting in Washington, D.C. following the 1976 election that when working with Executive Branch employees they should view them, not suspiciously, but “as all Carter people.”\nPost–Carter administration\nFrom January 1998 to June 2000, he served as Chief Legal Strategist of Monsanto Company.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050324024838/http://miami.edu/debate04/jack_watson_bio.htm Biography] from a University of Miami website\n*\n* https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/assets/documents/findingaids/Watson_Jack.pdf\n|-"
