Michelle Smith compares the episodic nature of the manga to Inuyasha, where \"most of the nefarious doings can be traced back to the same culprit\". Manga Life's Ysabet Reinhardt MacFarlane commends the manga for its \"detailed and very easy to follow\" artwork. Mania.com's Sakura Eries criticizes the manga for its \"not very compelling\" protagonists. Later reviews by Sakura Eries criticizes the manga, which was published in 1996, for its \"futuristic anachronism\" of the story that is set in 2021. Eries comments that the scenarios would seem dated in the post 9/11 world. She also criticized the manga for its unrealistic plot.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
