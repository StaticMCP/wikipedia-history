Greye in early 1981 and six months later joined by Malcolm Evans after they met at a Bath Classical Guitar & Lute Society meeting in Bath in 1981. They produced computer games for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers.\nThey struck gold with the revolutionary 3D Monster Maze, the first 3D game for a home computer, which John Greye suggested they produce after seeing a basic 3D Maze that Evans had programmed in Z80 Assembler. In the spring of 1982, Evans split up the company and founded his own company, New Generation Software (a name taken from an advertising slogan by Greye), which continued to produce games for the ZX Spectrum.\nGreye later set up J.K.&nbsp;Greye Enterprises Ltd, a separate company which split off around February–March 1983, to produce games for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.\nList of games\nThis softography is a merged list between J.K.&nbsp;Greye Software and J.K.&nbsp;Greye Enterprises Ltd.\nSinclair ZX81\n* 10 Games for 1K ZX81 (1981)\n* 1K Breakout (1981)\n* Catacombs (1981)\n* 3D Defender (1981) (later re-released by N.G.S.)\n* 3D Monster Maze (1981) (later re-released by N.G.S.)\n* Pyramid (1981)\n* Starfighter (1981)\n* ZX81 Artist (1981) (these last three released on one \"gamestape\")\nZX Spectrum\n* Ufo (1982)\n* Minefield (1982)\n* Invasion (1982)\n* Kamikaze (1982)\n* The Arcadian (1982)\n* 3D Vortex (1983)\n* 4-Star (1984)\nReferences"
