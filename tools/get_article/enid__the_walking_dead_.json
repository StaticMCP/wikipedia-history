The sentimental bond of Enid to Carl is developed, when Enid pleads with Carl to join the group on his journey to take Maggie to the Hilltop Colony for medical treatment.

When Negan and the Saviors arrive in Alexandria for their \"offering\", she encounters a Savior named David who has her green balloons which she pleads for him to give it back to her; David then taunts and sexually harasses Enid by touching her cheek in which he forces her to repeatedly say \"Please\" while Carl, who is unable to intervene has to angrily and helplessly watch him bully her as she says the word twice. Satisfied by this, David drops the balloons before letting her off with a warning to be careful next time. After learning of the deaths of Glenn and Abraham, Enid travels to the Hilltop with Carl.
