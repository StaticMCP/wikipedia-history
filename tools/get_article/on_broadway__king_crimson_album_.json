It is drawn from recordings of the band's five-night stand at the Longacre Theatre, New York City on November 20, 21, 22, 24 and 25, 1995, when they were touring to promote the THRAK album.\nSome of these recordings also feature on Disc 1 of the 2001 release Vrooom Vrooom. The final track, \"Fearless and Highly THRaKked\", also features on the 1996 album THRaKaTTaK, and on the aforementioned Vrooom Vrooom as \"Biker Babes of the Rio Grande\".\nLead singer and guitarist Adrian Belew performed The Beatles' \"Free As A Bird\" as a solo piece throughout the Broadway engagement.  This was not included on the album, but was released on Belew's solo album Belew Prints and on Vrooom Vrooom.\nThe album includes liner notes by Robert Fripp, the band's other guitarist.\nTrack listing\nDisc 1\n#\"Conundrum\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 1:57\n#\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\" (Belew, Fripp, Levin, Bruford) – 6:43\n#\"Red\" (Fripp) - 6:29\n#\"Dinosaur\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 7:16\n#\"VROOOM VROOOM\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 4:48\n#\"Frame by Frame\" (Belew, Fripp, Levin, Bruford) – 5:10\n#\"Walking on Air\" (Belew, Bruford, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Mastelotto) – 5:28\n#\"B'Boom\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 5:35\n#\"THRAK\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 6:31\n#\"Neurotica\" (Belew, Fripp, Levin, Bruford) – 4:34\n#\"Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 4:58\nDisc 2\n#\"People\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 6:14\n#\"One Time\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 5:55\n#\"Indiscipline\" (Belew, Fripp, Levin, Bruford) – 7:16\n#\"Two Sticks\" (Gunn, Levin) – 2:02\n#\"Elephant Talk\" (Belew, Fripp, Levin, Bruford) – 4:17\n#\"Prism\" (Favre) – 3:56\n#\"The Talking Drum\" (Cross, Fripp, Wetton, Bruford, Muir) – 2:59\n#\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic (Part II)\" (Fripp) – 7:27\n#\"Three of a Perfect Pair\" (Belew, Fripp, Levin, Bruford) – 4:22\n#\"VROOOM\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 3:54\n#\"Coda: Marine 475\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 2:41\n#\"Fearless and Highly THRaKked\" (Belew, Fripp, Gunn, Levin, Bruford, Mastelotto) – 2:31\nPersonnel\nKing Crimson\n*Adrian Belew – guitar, lead vocals\n*Robert Fripp – guitar\n*Trey Gunn – Warr guitar\n*Tony Levin – bass guitar, electric upright bass, Chapman Stick, backing vocals\n*Bill Bruford – drums, percussion\n*Pat Mastelotto – drums, percussion\nProduction personnel\n*Noah Evens – recording engineer\n*Adrian Belew & Ken Latchney – mixing\n*Alex R.
