On September 22, Union Col. John W. Foster, with his cavalry and artillery, engaged Col. James E. Carter and his troops at Blountville. Foster attacked at noon and in the four-hour battle shelled the town and initiated a flanking movement, compelling the  Confederates to withdraw. Blountville was the initial step in the Union’s attempt to force Confederate Maj. Gen. Sam Jones and his command to retire from East Tennessee.\nThe Sullivan County courthouse in Blountville was gutted by a fire that broke out during the shelling. It was rebuilt in 1866.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.battleofblountville.com/ Battle of Blountville Reenactment and Military Park]\nReferences\n}}\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108183002/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/TennesseeBattlefieldProfiles/Beans%20Station%20to%20Bulls%20Gap.pdf CWSAC Report Update]"
