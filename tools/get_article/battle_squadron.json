      "text": "# Battle Squadron\n\nBattle Squadron is a one or two player vertically scrolling shooter released in 1989 for the Amiga.\n}}\nIn 1989, The Games Machine rated Battle Squadron as 87%. It stated while the premise sounds similar to other games, \"what makes this game work is its ultra-fast playing speed. And with multiple frames of animation for each onscreen sequence, it gives a believable feeling of really blowing up baddies and wiping out ground installations\". It noted what puts this game ahead of other shooting games is \"the rapid-fire animation, couple with effective sound and a long running music track containing the right amount of droning bass\".\nThe German edition of Retro Gamer, in a 2016 special on Amiga, highlighted that the 1989 version of \"Battle Squadron was simply brilliantly made; sparkling clean graphics and exquisite playability ensured sophisticated action fun\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080118202833/http://www.ronklaren.nl/index.php/personal/battle-squadron-soundtrack-remix/ Battle Squadron Soundtrack Remix] by the original composer, Ron Klaren\n*\n* Downloadable [http://www.copecom.com/ demo versions] of Battle Squadron"
