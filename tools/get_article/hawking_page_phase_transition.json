At this temperature, there will be a first order phase transition where below  T_C , thermal AdS will become the dominant contribution to the partition function.\nThe Hawking-Page phase transition between the unstable small black hole to stable large black hole phase is understood as a confinement-deconfinement phase transition in the dual conformal field theory via AdS/CFT correspondence.\nReferences\n*\n\n---\n\n## Hawking page phase transition\n\n#REDIRECT Hawking–Page phase transition"
