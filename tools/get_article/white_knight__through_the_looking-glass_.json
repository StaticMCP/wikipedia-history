He represents the chess piece of the same name. As imagined in John Tenniel's illustrations for the Alice stories, he is inspired by Albrecht Dürer's 1513 engraving \"Knight, Death and the Devil.\"\nStoryline\nThe White Knight saves Alice from his opponent  (the Red Knight). He repeatedly falls off his horse and lands on his head, and tells Alice of his inventions, which consists of things such as a pudding with ingredients like blotting paper, an upside down container, and anklets to guard his horse against shark bites.\nHe recites a poem of his own composition, 'A-Sitting on a Gate', (but the song's name is called 'Haddocks' Eyes') and he and Alice depart.\nFilm incarnations\n* Alice In Wonderland (1933) Played by Gary Cooper\n* The White Knight was planned to appear in Disney's 1951 movie, but the idea got scrapped. Alice had to meet him at the Tulgey Wood, where the White Knight (supposed to be a caricature of Walt Disney himself) tried to lift her spirit up after the girl gets lost. Few concept art pictures of the White Knight survive.\n* Alice in Wonderland (1955) (TV) Played by Reginald Gardiner\n* ''Alice in Wonderland (or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?)
