It was founded in 1970, with background in the republican forces that helped to defend San'a during the royalist siege 1967–1968 (see North Yemen Civil War). The movement was engaged in guerrilla warfare 1970–1973.\nOn February 2, 1976, the organisation, together with the Revolutionary Democratic Party of Yemen, the Labour Party, the Popular Vanguard and the People's Democratic Union, founded the National Democratic Front in San'a.\nOn March 5, 1979 the party merged with the other founding parties of the NDF, forming the Yemeni Popular Unity Party. Four days later, the Popular Unity Party merged into the Yemeni Socialist Party (but retaining the name 'Popular Unity Party' for activities in North Yemen). The NDF did however continue to exist as a separate structure, with other groups joining and leaving it.\nReferences"
