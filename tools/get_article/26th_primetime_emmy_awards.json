This format would prove to be the Super Emmy's undoing. In order to vote on a Super Emmy winner, the traditional Emmy winners had to be announced well before the ceremony.\nSeveral members of the Television Academy were against implementing the new awards. Super Emmy winners Alan Alda and Mary Tyler Moore were some of the loudest detractors. Both threatened to resign from the academy if they were installed. During their acceptance speeches, Moore said that comparing comedic and dramatic television was \"apples to oranges\". Alda went one step further in his speech \"it's comparing apples to oranges to Volkswagens.\"\nThe Super Emmy was never awarded again.\nActing\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H (CBS)'\n** Telly Savalas as Theo Kojak in Kojak (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Hal Holbrook as Capt.
