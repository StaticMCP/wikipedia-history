At the time that Hoover's occurred, presidential transitions were much less complex than they are today. The term \"presidential transition\" had not even begun to be widely applied to the period between an individual's election as president of the United States and their assumption of the office.\n\"Friendly takeover\"\nThe transition was an example of a \"friendly takeover\", in which the outgoing president and the president-elect were of the same political party (Republican). It would be the last such transition until the 1988–89 presidential transition of George H. W. Bush.\nSecret Service protection\nBeginning on November 7, the day after the election, the newly minted president-elect and his family were given protection by the United States Secret Service.\nEconomy\nWhile the stock market would crash months into Hoover's presidency, starting the Great Depression, the performance of the economy during his transition appeared strong. Among United States presidential transitions, the stock market performed stronger than it had during a presidential transition for decades. The growth of the Dow Jones Industrial Average had experienced during Hoover's presidential transition (21.8%) would not be exceeded by any United States presidential transition until the first presidential transition of Donald Trump.\nLatin American tour\nOn November 19, 1928, President-elect Hoover embarked on a ten-nation goodwill tour of Latin America, first departing from San Pedro, in Los Angeles, California aboard the . He was accompanied on the trip by his wife Lou Henry Hoover. He delivered twenty-five speeches, stressing his plans to reduce American political and military interference in Latin American affairs. In sum, he pledged that the United States would act as a \"good neighbor.\"\nHoover's work as United States secretary of commerce had led him to view Latin America as important, and believe that there was need to improve relations. Hoover began planning the trip soon after winning the election. It was the first time that a president-elect had taken such a goodwill trip abroad. Hoover also planned the trip as means of staying away from Washington, D.C., avoiding men seeking to lobby for patronage posts.\nThe administration of outgoing president Calvin Coolidge lent their support to Hoover's plans to take this trip. Henry P. Fletcher accompanied Hoover on the trip, serving as  official advisor to the president-elect as well as a representative of Coolidge and the Department of State. Coolidge ordered that Hoover should be treated with presidential honors on his trip, despite Hoover having not yet entered the office.\nWhile crossing the Andes from Chile, a plot by Argentine anarchists to bomb Hoover's train as it crossed the vast Argentinian central plain was foiled. The group of plotters were led by Severino Di Giovanni. The bomber was arrested before he could place the explosives on the rails. Hoover professed unconcern, tearing off the front page of a newspaper that revealed the plot and explaining, \"It's just as well that Lou shouldn't see it,\" referring to his wife.\nDuring his travels, he delivered roughly 25 speeches. Public reception in the United States of Hoover's trip was largely positive.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width: 70%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n!Dates\n!Country\n!Locations\n!Details\n|-\n|November 26, 1928\n|\n|Amapala\n|Met with President-elect Vicente Mejía Colindres and Foreign Minister Augusto Coello.

Hoover was in little hurry to begin preparing to take office. Presidential transitions were much less complex when Hoover took office than they have been in more recent decades.\nShaping of Hoover's administration\nAfter his Florida vacation, Hoover began the business of shaping his administration in the final two weeks of his transition period.\nHoover retained two members of Coolidge's Cabinet. One was Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon, whom, per the later recounting of historian David Bruner, Hoover retained in order to avoid a reaction on Wall Street, as the financial sector held Mellon in strong esteem. The other was Secretary of Labor James J. Davis, who was retained, per Bruner's accounting, in order for Hoover to avoid  the pressure to appoint John L. Lewis to the position.\nReferences"
