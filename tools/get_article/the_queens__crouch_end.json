Hill in 1898–1902, or 1899–1901, with Art Nouveau stained glass by Cakebread Robey. Built at the northern end of Hill's recently completed Broadway Parade, it was described in Pevsner as \"one of suburban London's outstanding grand pubs\".\nDiagonally opposite, in Topsfield Parade, was the Queen's Opera House, which was opened in 1897 but damaged by bombing during the Second World War and subsequently demolished.\nThe Queen’s features in the British gangster film Love, Honour and Obey (2000) where the main characters perform karaoke.\nGallery\nFile:The Queens pub, Tottenham Lane, Crouch End, London (16).jpg|Main entrance\nFile:The Queens pub, Tottenham Lane, Crouch End, London (15).jpg|Queen's Hotel glass etching\nFile:The Queens pub, Tottenham Lane, Crouch End, London (29).jpg|Art nouveau style stained glass\nSee also\n*The Salisbury\nReferences\nExternal links"
