The Longines Rankings are based on the rating earned by horses running worldwide from North and South America, Europe, Middle East, South Africa, Asia through to Australia and New Zealand.\nThe ratings are compiled under the auspices of The International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) by racing officials & handicappers representing the five continents who compile the ranking order by agreeing on the rating for each horse. The ratings are based on the performance of horses in elite races held during the designated period which takes in account the quality of opposition and achievements of each horse. The annual rankings denote the champions in the various distance categories for example sprint or mile, surface either turf or dirt/artificial and also the fillies & mares category.\nAccording to the IFHA website, \"The IFHA World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings are the official assessment of the top performers.\" In 1977, France, Great Britain and Ireland published the first internationally agreed assessment of racing merit on behalf of the European Pattern Committee under the banner of the International Classifications. In 1985, Germany and Italy joined the system, to be followed by North America (both Canada and the United States) and Japan in the mid 1990s.\nThe Longines World's Best Racehorse Rankings measure a given horse's peak performance during the year. Throughout the year the Longines Rankings are published at regular intervals and the final annual rankings are released in January. The three highest-rated horses are honored during the Longines World's Best Racehorse and Longines World's Best Horse Race Ceremony.\nTop ranked horses\n* Horse names are followed by a suffix indicating the country where foaled.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#D2B48C\" align=\"center\"\n| width=\"45px\" | Year\n| width=\"50px\" | Rating\n| width=\"180px\" | Horse\n| width=\"120px\" | Trained\n| width=\"340px\" | Race\n|-\n| 2003\n| 134\n| Hawk Wing (USA)\n| Ireland\n| Lockinge Stakes\n|-\n| 2004\n| 130\n| Ghostzapper (USA)\n| United States\n| Breeders' Cup Classic\n|-\n| 2005\n| 130\n| Hurricane Run (IRE)\n| France\n| Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe\n|-\n| 2006\n| 129\n| Invasor (ARG)\n| United States\n| Breeders' Cup Classic\n|-\n| 2007\n| 131\n| Manduro (GER)\n| France\n| Prince of Wales's Stakes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2008\n| 130\n| Curlin (USA)\n| United States\n| Dubai World Cup / Stephen Foster Handicap\n|-\n| 130\n| New Approach (IRE)\n| Ireland\n| Champion Stakes\n|-\n| 2009\n| 136\n| Sea The Stars (IRE)\n| Ireland\n| Irish Champion Stakes\n|-\n| 2010\n| 135\n| Harbinger (GB)\n| Great Britain\n| King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes\n|-\n| 2011\n| 136\n| Frankel (GB)\n| Great Britain\n| Sussex Stakes\n|-\n| 2012\n| 140\n| Frankel (GB)\n| Great Britain\n| Queen Anne Stakes / Juddmonte International Stakes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2013\n| 130\n| Treve (FR)\n| France\n| Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe\n|-\n| 130\n| Black Caviar (AUS)\n| Australia\n| T J Smith Stakes\n|-\n| 2014\n| 130\n| Just A Way (JPN)\n| Japan\n| Dubai Duty Free\n|-\n| 2015\n| 134\n| American Pharoah (USA)\n| United States\n| Breeders' Cup Classic\n|-\n| 2016\n| 134\n| Arrogate (USA)\n| United States\n| Breeders' Cup Classic\n|-\n| 2017\n| 134\n| Arrogate (USA)\n| United States\n| Dubai World Cup\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 2018\n|130\n|Cracksman (GB)\n|Great Britain\n|Champion Stakes\n|-\n|130\n|Winx (AUS)\n|Australia\n|Queen Elizabeth Stakes (ATC)\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2019\n|128\n|Crystal Ocean (GB)\n|Great Britain\n|Prince of Wales's Stakes\n|-\n|128\n|Enable (GB)\n|Great Britain\n|King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes\n|-\n|128\n|Waldgeist (GB)\n|France\n|Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe\n|-\n| 2020\n| 130\n| Ghaiyyath (IRE)\n| Great Britain\n| International Stakes\n|-\n| 2021\n| 129\n| Knicks Go (USA)\n| United States\n| Breeders' Cup Classic\n|-\n| 2022\n| 140\n| Flightline (USA)\n| United States\n| Pacific Classic\n|-\n| 2023\n| 135\n| Equinox (JPN)\n| Japan\n| Japan Cup\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 2024\n| 128\n| City of Troy (USA)\n| Ireland\n| International Stakes\n|-\n| 128\n| Laurel River (USA)\n| United Arab Emirates\n| Dubai World Cup\n|}\nSee also\n* Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association\n* List of horse races\n* Dubai World Cup Night\n* Dubai World Cup\n* Breeders' Cup\n* 1000 Guineas Stakes\n* 2000 Guineas Stakes\n* Yuga Kawada\n* Tōkyō Yūshun\n* Champions Cup (horse race)\n* British Champions Series\n* List of horse racing venues\n* List of horse racing venues by capacity\n* Horse racing in Great Britain\n* Jockey\n* List of leading Thoroughbred racehorses\nReferences\nExternal links\n*International Federation of Horseracing Authorities [https://ifhaonline.org/]"
