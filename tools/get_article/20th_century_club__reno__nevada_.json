Mrs. Walter McNab Miller served as President for an original group of 84 women.  The Club's name was chosen to reflect a look forward to the future and the beginning of the new century.\nIn 1894, Club members started a circulating library, and in 1898 a scholarship to the University of Nevada was funded.  In 1901, members of the Twentieth Century Club participated in founding the Kindergarten Association and urged the Legislature to establish public kindergartens throughout the state.  During the war years, many hours were devoted to the home-front war effort.\nIn 1925 a Clubhouse was built on First Street on the river by Roush and Belz.  Through the years the Clubhouse was the pride of its members. Much social life of Reno revolved around the facilities of this Clubhouse – weddings, luncheons, dinner dances, and civic meetings.\nBefore 1930, the 20th Century Club was involved in a wide variety of causes like passing laws that prohibit spitting on sidewalks, social causes, education and morale. The club's membership peaked at around 1,000 members.\nIn 1980, the Twentieth Century Club sold the building, and the Club's Steinway grand piano was donated to the Reno Philharmonic.\nSince 1986 two scholarships are awarded to female students with an interest in medicine.  Currently the scholarships are in the amount of $2500 each.  Monetary donations totaling $20,000 are given to local philanthropic organizations each year, and organized philanthropic endeavors are scheduled at Club meetings throughout the year.\nA monthly luncheon is held September through May featuring a program of music or lecturers.\nThe Twentieth Century Club has entered its third century as the oldest, active women's club in the state of Nevada.\nContact information is as follows:  [https://twentiethcenturyclub.org/ Twentieth Century Club]\nThe former Twentieth Century Clubhouse, now known as the 20th Century Building still stands today and is located at 335 W.
