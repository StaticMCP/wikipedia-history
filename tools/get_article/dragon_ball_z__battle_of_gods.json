It is the eighteenth animated feature film based on the 1984–95 manga series Dragon Ball, the fourteenth to carry the Dragon Ball Z branding, and is the first film in the franchise to be personally supervised by series creator Akira Toriyama. It was the first animated Dragon Ball film in 17 years to have a theatrical release, the last being Dragon Ball: The Path to Power (1996), and the first to use digital ink and paint. Unlike previous theatrical Dragon Ball releases, this was a full feature-length production with a stand-alone release and not shown as part of the now-discontinued Toei Anime Fair (formerly the Toei Manga Matsuri). At the time of its release, Battle of Gods was initially the first film considered an official part of the Dragon Ball storyline, being set during the time skip in chapter 517 of the original manga. The plot involves Beerus, the God of Destruction, learning of the defeat of the galactic overlord Frieza at the hands of Goku. Seeking an opponent worthy of his power, Beerus, along with his companion Whis, travels to the North Galaxy to challenge Goku to a battle.\nThe film was released in Japan on March 30, 2013, by Toei and 20th Century Fox Japan. It was the first-ever Japanese film to be screened at IMAX, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 13, 2013. Funimation acquired the North American rights to Battle of Gods and produced an English dub that they co-released with 20th Century Fox in North American cinemas in August 2014. Madman Entertainment acquired the Australasian rights and screened the film at the 2013 Japanese Film Festival in Australia before screening the English dub to select theaters in August 2014. Manga Entertainment released the film in the United Kingdom in November 2014.\nA sequel, Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, was released in Japan in April 2015, while both films would eventually be adapted into the first and second story arcs of Dragon Ball Super, which expanded upon the plot of both films.\nPlot\nBeerus, the God of Destruction, is woken from a lengthy slumber by his attendant Whis. While reviewing the current state of the universe, he is surprised to learn that Frieza was defeated by a Saiyan raised on Earth named Goku. He recalls that thirty-nine years prior, the Oracle Fish foretold that a mighty opponent would appear before Beerus called the Super Saiyan God. Intrigued by the potential challenge, Beerus then tracks Goku to King Kai's planet. Goku excitedly challenges Beerus to a fight and despite powering up to Super Saiyan 3 form, is effortlessly defeated. Disappointed, Beerus departs in order to seek out the other Saiyans.\nOn Earth, Bulma's birthday party is interrupted by Beerus' arrival. Vegeta, aware of the might of the god of destruction, casts his pride aside in order to appease him, who along with Whis, soon both develop a curiosity for Earth's cuisine. While the party is ongoing, the Pilaf Gang attempts (and fails) to infiltrate the party to steal the magical Dragon Balls, and accidentally shoots Videl while making a scene. While Dende is healing her, he learns that Videl is pregnant with Gohan's child. As the celebration continues, Beerus is soon provoked by Buu who refuses to share any pudding.\nBeerus attacks Buu and decides to destroy the Earth when Android 18, Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Gohan attempt to fight Beerus but are all swiftly defeated. Vegeta reluctantly tries his hand at fighting Beerus as does Goten and Trunks, who fuse into Gotenks, but they both are beaten as well. Bulma becomes upset at the fighting ruining her party and scolds Beerus before slapping him. When Beerus hits her back, Vegeta, already in Super Saiyan 2 form, is sent into fit of rage and despite faring the best in combat against Beerus of anyone thus far, is still defeated. As Beerus prepares to obliterate the planet, Goku arrives and asks Beerus for more time to learn about the Super Saiyan God.\nUsing the Dragon Balls, he summons Shenron and the eternal dragon reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of them to reach the form. Thanks to the power of himself, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and Videl's unborn child channeling their energy together, Goku ascends to the level of Super Saiyan God. He confronts Beerus and they engage in an intense battle. The form gives Goku the power to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to its apparent time limit. However, he acquires the form's godlike feeling which allows him to retain some of the power in his fight against Beerus who eventually decides to use a massive energy attack to truly put Goku to the test.\nGoku struggles to stop the energy sphere but after he laments on the potential deaths of his loved ones, he is able to absorb the attack and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again. However, Goku is overwhelmed with exhaustion, and at Beerus' suggestion, finally admits defeat. He recognizes Goku's effort and reveals that he was the second strongest person he had ever fought, after Whis, who is also his martial arts master and is even stronger than he is. Goku also learns that there are other universes with other Gods of Destruction as well. Beerus decides to spare the Earth by only destroying a small rock (thus technically keeping his word), and he and Whis bid farewell as they depart back to their home world.\nVoice cast\n{|border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-style=\"background-color: rgb(255,85,0);\"\n!Character!!Japanese voice actor!!English voice actor\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Goku\n|Masako Nozawa||Sean Schemmel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Beerus\n|Kōichi Yamadera||Jason Douglas\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Whis\n|Masakazu Morita||Ian Sinclair\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Vegeta\n|Ryō Horikawa||Christopher R.

On July 14, the magazine and website, now changed to show Shenlong appearing and then disappearing, revealed some minor information of the upcoming film; including the premiere date, staff information, and companies involved in the production (Fox International Productions Japan, Shueisha, Fuji TV, Toei Animation, Bandai, Bandai Namco Games, and Bird Studio). The film's director is Masahiro Hosoda, who directed several Dragon Ball Z episodes back in 1992, the screenplay was written by Yūsuke Watanabe, who has written manga adaptations before (namely the 20th Century Boys and Gantz live-action films), and the lead animation director is Tadayoshi Yamamuro, who has worked on the series since the Dragon Ball anime.\nThe magazine and official website also published a comment by Akira Toriyama about the film. The Dragon Ball series creator notes that the adaptation will mark the first time he has been so deeply involved in the production of one of its films, in this case as early as the screenwriting stages. Toriyama also said that the film will retain the atmosphere of the original while adding small amounts of modern flavor. Toei Animation released a press statement on July 17, 2012, saying it would be set \"between the animation series Z and GT, or in other words from the blank decade between the end of the battle with Majin Buu in chapter 517 of the manga and chapter 518\" and calling it part of \"the official history of Dragon Ball.\"\nIn September, it was announced that the film was one of four that year, and the only animated one, to receive money from the Japanese government as part of the non-profit organization UNIJAPAN's \"Co-production Certification Program\". Toei received 50 million yen (roughly US$636,000) from the Agency for Cultural Affairs, whose aim is to promote Japanese arts and culture, with the United States named as the film's partner country.\n}}\nThe December issue of Ultra Jump elaborated on Toriyama's involvement in the film, stating he came up with the film's story and character designs. On December 2, the official website was updated with the films' cast and entire staff. The following day, a brief introduction to the film's story was leaked from accessing an unlinked section of the website.\nIn January 2013, it was announced that Olympic gold medalist in judo Kaori Matsumoto and singer/tarento Shoko Nakagawa will have roles in the film. Nakagawa is a well-known otaku and Matsumoto is a fan of the series as well. Matsumoto voices a policewoman modeled after herself, while Nakagawa plays the  who first leads Beerus to Goku. The Fuji TV announcer Shin-ichi Karube also has a small part in the film. When Toriyama originally designed Yogen-gyo, he intended for the character to be larger than a person. But because he did not provide a scale chart to the animation team, the character ended up being small enough to fit in someone's palm.\nThe April issue of V Jump teased about a new Super Saiyan transformation being in the film, titled , saying: 39 years ago, the Oracle Fish told Beerus that the Super Saiyan God would appear before him. And that this is the beginning of the film's story. In Weekly Shōnen Jump issue #14 of 2013, Toriyama said that the plot for Battle of Gods began two years ago with ideas for the God of Destruction and Super Saiyan God, and that he got deeply involved in the story in order to keep it in-line with the series' original tone so kids could enjoy it. In the following week's issue, he revealed that Beerus' design is based on a cat and his clothes based on Egyptian garments.\nA live greeting by cast members and Toriyama, followed by a preview screening of the film took place across Japan on Tuesday, March 12, 2013, with a limited number of attendees determined from a Jump lottery.

Otaku USA's Matt Schley agreed that it is a comedy heavy film \"more reminiscent of the original Dragon Ball than Z\". He speculates that the viewer's enjoyment of the film depends on what they expect; \"If you want epic Dragon Ball Z story worthy of the title Battle of Gods, this film may disappoint. But if you're just happy to see your favorite characters performing a few animated hijinx again after all these years, this film certainly delivers.\"\nLeah B. Jackson of IGN gave the English dub of the film a 7.5 out of 10, praising the animation and fight scenes, particularly the final battle. She was pleased to see Funimation's voice actors return, but criticized the film for the lack of iconic techniques and having too much \"filler\". Theron Martin of Anime News Network (ANN) praised the film for its humor, use of main and supporting cast, the introduction of Beerus and Whis and the overall light-hearted nature and plot. But also criticized the film for its inconsistent animation, uninspiring fight scenes and use of CGI, stating, \"Ultimately Battle of Gods is entirely a movie for long-established fans, as it has too many in-jokes that those not familiar with wide swaths of the franchise would get. It is not a stellar addition to the franchise but is a worthwhile and at least moderately entertaining one, provided that one does not go into it expecting an action magnum opus.\" Kyle Mills Of DVD Talk highly recommended the film, praising the dub and the perfect balancing of the humor elements from the first Dragon Ball anime with the action elements of Dragon Ball Z. He finished with, \"Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is one hell of a fun flick. For any fan of the Dragon Ball franchise, you need to check it out.[...] [It is] a film full of nostalgia, fun characters, legitimate laugh out loud moments, and slick action sequences. It's a film that showcases perfectly why the Dragon Ball franchise has such long lasting popularity.\"\nHome media\nThe film was released in Japan in standard and limited edition Blu-ray and DVD formats on September 13, 2013.
