There are five main games in the series, starting with the release of Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen in 1993.\nOverview\nThe first video game in the series, Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen, was released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan, and two years later in North America. The title was a real-time strategy role playing game, set in a medieval fantasy world. The second game in the series, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, was released in 1995 in Japan. It was a turn-based tactical role-playing game making use of isometric graphics, and the title is largely considered to be \"exceptionally influential\" to the genre. Two subsequent games in the Ogre Battle series – Ogre Battle 64 and Ogre Battle Gaiden: Prince of Zenobia – follow the real-time strategy gameplay of the original title in the franchise, while Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis follows the turn-based tactical role-playing gameplay elements of the second game in the series.\nThe Knight of Lodis, released in 2001, is the last original release in the franchise. In 2010, Tactics Ogre was remade for the PlayStation Portable as Tactics Ogre: Wheel of Fortune, but the characters, story and setting are identical to the 1995 release. The creator of the series, Yasumi Matsuno, directed the remake of the game. Matsuno was also responsible for another highly influential title, Final Fantasy Tactics, originally released in 1997. Though the title bears no relation to the Ogre Battle series, Final Fantasy Tactics is considered by some critics to be a spiritual successor to Tactics Ogre. As of 2016, the franchise mostly remains active through re-releases of the first two games for the Nintendo's Virtual Console service in Japan, North America and Europe.\nBoth \"Ogre Battle\" and \"The March of the Black Queen\" were titles to Queen songs from their 1974 album Queen II. In addition, \"Let Us Cling Together\" is the subtitle to their song \"Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\" from 1976's A Day at the Races.\nVideo games\nMain series\n| release1=March 12, 1993 (SFC)\n| release2=May 1995 (SNES)\n| release3=July 3, 2009 (Wii VC)\n| notes=\n* Real-time strategy game.\n* Released on the Super Famicom in 1993; this version was later released for Wii Virtual Console (2008) and Wii U Virtual Console (2013).\n* Also available on PlayStation (1996), Sega Saturn (1996), iMode (2010) and EZweb (2011).\n* Originally released in Japan under the title .\n* The English subtitle translates to Japanese as Kuroki Joō no Kōshin (黒き女王の行進).\n}}\n| release1=October 6, 1995 (SFC)\n| release2=May 1, 1998 (PS)\n| release3=February 25, 2011 (PSP)\n| notes=\n* Tactical role-playing game.\n* Released on Super Famicom in 1995; this version was later released for Wii Virtual Console (2009), Wii U Virtual Console (2014) and New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console (2016).\n* Also available on Sega Saturn (1996) and PlayStation (1997).\n* Sega Saturn version has voice acting in Japanese.\n* Originally released in Japan under the title .\n* The English subtitle translates to Japanese as Te o Toriatte (手をとりあって).\n* Remade for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) in 2010; this remake, known under its original title in the West, was released in Japan using the subtitle Wheel of Fortune.\n* The remake was made available on Sony's PlayStation Network and can be downloaded and played both on PSP and PlayStation Vita.\n* A remaster of the PSP remake for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Windows through the Steam digital download service was released in November 2022.\n* Physical releases of the remaster are available for the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4 and Playstation 5.\n* A Collector's Edition was released in Japan containing one of the physical releases, an art book, the Tactics Ogre Official Script across 3 volumes, a soundtrack CD, a mat, a tarot card set and a pouch to store said cards.\n}}\n| release1=July 14, 1999 (N64)\n| release2=October 7, 2000 (N64)\n| release3=March 26, 2010 (Wii VC)\n| notes=\n* Real-time strategy game.\n* Released on Nintendo 64 in 1999; this version was later released for Wii Virtual Console (2010) and Wii U Virtual Console (2017).\n* Originally released in Japan under the title .\n* The English subtitle translates to Japanese as Shidōshataru Utsuwa o Motsu Mono (指導者たる器を持つ者).\n}}\n}}\nSide stories\n| release1=June 22, 2000 (NGPC)\n| release2=\n| release3=\n| notes=\n* Real-time strategy game.\n* Side story originally titled Prince no Shō: Let us walk on together, so as not lose our way (プリンスの章 Let us walk on together, so as not lose our way).\n* Released on Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000.\n* Originally released in Japan under the title .\n* Only game in the series not to be released outside of Japan.\n}}\n| release1=June 21, 2001 (GBA)\n| release2=May 7, 2002 (GBA)\n| release3=\n| notes=\n* Tactical role-playing game.\n* Side story originally titled Ovis no Shō: Lodis no Kishi (オウィスの章 ローディスの騎士).\n* Released on Game Boy Advance in 2001.\n* Originally released in Japan under the title .\n}}\n}}\nRelated software\nA prerelease demo of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together was made available in early October 1995 for the Super Famicom add-on Satellaview.
