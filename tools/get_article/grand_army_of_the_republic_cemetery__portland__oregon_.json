It is located at S.W. Palatine Hill Road and S.W. Boones Ferry Road, next to River View Cemetery.\nFourteen Union Civil War veterans, members of the Grand Army of the Republic, formed the Grand Army Cemetery Association and purchased the cemetery in 1882. The Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War took over the management and administration of the cemetery at that time.\nOwnership of the cemetery eventually passed to the State of Oregon in 1961 then to Multnomah County, Oregon in 1971. In 1996 ownership was granted to Metro Regional Parks and Greenspaces.  The oldest marker is dated October 15, 1889.\nSalmon Brown, son of John Brown (of the song \"John Brown's Body\") is buried here, as is Hartwell B. Compson (1842–1905), who received the Medal of Honor for heroism in the Civil War.\nSee also\n* Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery (Seattle)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/union_army_sentry_returns_to_h.html Union Army sentry returns to his Portland post after long absence] - The Oregonian\n*"
