It was the first road built following the dismantling of the city walls in 1950, whereas the name 'al-Wazir' was derived from the nickname of the country's first finance minister, Abdullah bin Suleiman al-Hamdan, who was better known as Wazīr Kullī Shaīʾ () and played a central role in the road's construction. It was later renamed after King Faisal. The street was once a preferred destination for commercial activity in the city and was also a bustling marketplace for imported and domestic goods.\nLandmarks\n* Yara International School\nReferences"
