It is located about 160&nbsp;km west of the Pakistan's capital Islamabad. The district headquarter is the city of Peshawar, which is also the capital of Khyber Paktunkhwa.\nHistory\nThis district and the city has seen the rise and fall of many civilizations. It was once the center of Gandhara and has subsequently been ruled by Persians, Greeks, Buddhists, Kushans, Afghans, Mughals, Marathas, Sikhs and the British. Peshawar district was annexed by the British from its former Sikh rulers after the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848–1849. The original district of Peshawar was a district of the North-West Frontier Province of British India.\nAfter the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the old Peshawar District became Peshawar Division comprising the current districts of Peshawar, Charsadda and Nowshera. In July 1988, the former Charsadda tehsil was separated and attained the status of a separate district. In 1990, the Nowshera tehsil also was upgraded to the status of a district. Under the latest revision of Pakistan's administrative structure, promulgated in 2001, Peshawar was also given the status of a city district.\nDemographics\nPopulation\n}}\nAs of the 2023 census, Peshawar district has 690,976 households and a population of 4,758,762. The district has a sex ratio of 103.99 males to 100 females and a literacy rate of 53%: 65% for males and 41% for females. 1,355,625 (28.54% of the surveyed population) are under 10 years of age. Approximately 1,905,975 (40.05%) live in urban areas.\nLanguages\nAt the time of the 2023, 93.07% of the district’s population spoke Pashto, 3.79% Hindko, 1.8% Urdu and 0.55% Punjabi as their first language. Due to the settlement of Afghan refugees and language shift Pashto has gained ground at the expense of Hindko.\nAccording to linguists, the nearly-extinct Tirahi language was likely spoken in the region before the arrival of the Afghans.\nEthnic groups\nThe main ethnic groups in Peshawar district are:\n*Hindkowan\n*Gujjar\n*Pashtun\n*Kohistani\nReligions\n}}\nMuslims make up the majority in Peshawar. Peshawar once had significant minorities of Hindus and Sikhs living in the small towns and Peshawar city, but most fled during Partition. 1,800 Hindus and 1,400 Sikhs remain in the district. Christians however have continued to grow.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Religion in contemporary Peshawar District\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Religiousgroup\n! colspan=\"2\" |1941\n! colspan=\"2\" |2017\n! colspan=\"2\" |2023\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n| Islam\n|335,871\n|86.27%\n| 4,300,937\n|\n|4,713,004\n|99.21%\n|-\n| Hinduism\n|33,551\n|8.62%\n| 1,811\n|\n|1,822\n|0.04%\n|-\n| Sikhism\n|15,454\n|3.97%\n|\n|\n|1,481\n|0.03%\n|-\n| Christianity\n|2,618\n|0.67%\n| 25,125\n|\n|33,249\n|0.70%\n|-\n| Zoroastrianism\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|5\n|~0%\n|-\n|Others\n|1,835\n|0.49%\n|2,561\n|\n|827\n|0.02%\n|-\n!

Most people in the Peshawar city spoke and understood Urdu, while economic elites from small towns such as big feudal Khan families, traders, alongside many Hindus also spoke Urdu. Persian was also spoken by elites of the Peshawar city and by traders from Kabul, despite a majority of the district population especially the agriculturists and Pathans only spoke Pashto.\nAt the time, during the late 19th century, approximately 92–93 percent of the total population of Peshawar Valley followed Islam, while the remaining 7–8 percent followed Hinduism, Sikhism and other religions. Persons adhering to minority religions primarily lived in major urban centres, cities, towns, and cantonments such as Peshawar, Charsadda (now in the Charsadda District) and Hoti (now in the Mardan District). 97 percent of the population living in rural towns practiced Islam.\nAfghan refugees\nIn recent years, Peshawar district hosts up to 20% of all Afghan refugees in Pakistan. In 2005, Peshawar district was home to 611,501 Afghan refugees who constituted 19.7% of the district's total population. Peshawar's immediate environs were home to large Afghan refugee camps, with Jalozai camp hosting up to 300,000 refugees in 2001 making it the largest refugee camp in Asia at the time. By 1980, 100,000 refugees a month were entering the province, with 25% of all refugees living in Peshawar district in 1981.\nAfghan refugees began to be frequently accused of involvement with terrorist attacks that occurred during Pakistan's war against radical Islamists. By 2015 the Pakistani government adopted a policy to repatriate Afghan refugees, including many who had spent their entire life in Pakistan. The policy of repatriation was also encouraged by the government of Afghanistan, though many refugees had not registered themselves in Pakistan. Un registered refugees returning to Afghanistan without their old Afghan identification documents now have no official status in Afghanistan either.\nEducation\nPeshawar District has many universities for various disciplines starting from Humanities, General Sciences, Sciences, Engineering Sciences to Medical Sciences, Agriculture Sciences and Management Sciences.
