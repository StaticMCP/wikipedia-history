Its abdomen is marked boldly in black and yellow. The thorax is greenish-grey. The head is yellow with a T-shaped mark on the forehead (frons). The eyes are yellow-green. The leading edges of the wings are yellow. The insect habitually hunts fairly slowly, patrolling up and down like other hawkers, with short bursts at high speed.\nTheir wingspan is . Males and females are similar.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe Australian emperor is found throughout Australia. In the state of Victoria, it has a split distribution: below about 600 metres in altitude, and above about 1200 metres, apparently because it avoids forested areas. It is also found in New Zealand, New Guinea, the Cocos-Keeling Islands, Java, Sumba and New Caledonia.\nThe Australian emperor is widespread and common on larger bodies of water with tall vegetation on the banks. Like other hawkers, it may hunt far from water. It flies throughout the summer from September to May.\nBehaviour\nThe Australian emperor is notable as the dragonfly in which motion camouflage was studied by Mizutani et al.: males of Anax papuensis are fiercely territorial, and approach and attack rivals, the males choose a flight path that keeps their image as seen by the target still with respect to a landmark point. The attacking dragonfly thus looms larger in the target's eyes, but otherwise does not seem to move until it is very close.\nThe males are very protective of their females. In case of intrusion of another individual, he will drive it away by engaging in a series of noisy air battles. Females lay their eggs under water.\nGallery\nAustralian Emperor Dragonfly - Hemianax papuensis.jpg|Australian emperor has a wingspan of about 11&nbsp;cm\nAustralian Emperor 6630.jpg|Male in flight\nThe biology of dragonflies (Odonata or Paraneuroptera) (1917) (19759604054).jpg|Hatching of larva\nAnax papuensis female wings (35012715496).jpg|Female wings\nAnax papuensis male wings (35012727886).jpg|Male wings\nBibliography\n* Günther Theischinger and John Hawking.
