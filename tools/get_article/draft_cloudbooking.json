It provides cloud-based workplace management solutions, including desk and meeting room booking, visitor management, and car parking management.\nHistory\nCloudbooking was founded in the United Kingdom in February 2001. The company initially focused on facilities management and later expanded into broader workspace optimisation software.\nIn 2020, Cloudbooking secured private investment to support international growth and expand its cloud-based platform in response to increased demand for hybrid workplace solutions following the COVID-19 pandemic. Following private investment, Cloudbooking was awarded global workspace management contracts with Experian and NTT DATA, delivering desk and meeting room booking solutions to improve workspace efficiency and support safe working environments following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe company is listed as an approved supplier on the UK government's G-Cloud Digital Marketplace, where it provides workplace and visitor management services to the public sector.\nIn May 2024, Cloudbooking expanded its product offering by introducing new workplace solution bundles designed specifically for micro and small-sized businesses, marking a strategic shift toward broader market reach.\nSee also\n* List of companies based in London\n* Hot Desking\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
