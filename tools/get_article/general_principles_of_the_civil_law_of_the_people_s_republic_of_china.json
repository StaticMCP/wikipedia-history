It is heavily influenced by the German Civil Code. It is the main source of civil law in the PRC and seeks to provide a uniform framework for interpreting the PRC's civil laws.\nUnlike most civil law jurisdictions, the PRC had no comprehensive civil code until 2021, and attempts to create one by the Chinese government have been difficult and controversial. The \"General Principles\" include both civil rights and liabilities under civil law, and contains 9 chapters and 156 articles. The chapters deal with the following topics:\n# Basic Principles\n# Citizen (Natural Person)\n# Legal Persons\n# Civil Juristic Acts and Agency\n# Civil Rights\n# Civil Liability\n# Limitation of Action\n# Application of Law in Civil Relations with Foreigners\n# Supplementary Provisions\nSee also\n* Civil Code of People's Republic of China; passed on May 28, 2020, effective January 1, 2021.\nReferences"
