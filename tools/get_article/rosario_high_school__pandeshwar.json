In the year 1849 Bishop Antony who came from Rome invited the Congregation of Christian brothers from France to found a primary school at Mangaluru to provide education to the children of the vicinity. The school was administered by the Parish Priests of Rosario Cathedral who also functioned as the correspondents of the school. The School played a very significant role in the destiny of thousands of Mangaloreans of all religious and castes.\nInitially classes were held up to V std. From 1858 to 1869 the school was called Rosario Elementary School, under the management of a separate Educational Board. From 1869 to 1946 it was called Rosario Secondary school and was the under the management of Rosario Cathedral Church. Later it was named Rosario High School.\nFrom the year 1968 the Management of the School was taken over by the Catholic Board of Education, based at Bishops House Mangalore.\nThe 1st Batch of VI form (SSLC) students appeared for their Public examination conducted by the erstwhile Madras Government in the year 1948 -49.
