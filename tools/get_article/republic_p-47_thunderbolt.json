One of the main United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) fighters, it found success in the European and Pacific theaters as an escort fighter well-suited to high-altitude air-to-air combat. It also served as the foremost American fighter-bomber in the ground-attack role.\nThe P-47 was noted for its firepower: its primary armament was eight .50-caliber machine guns, and it could carry 5-inch rockets or a bomb load of . When fully loaded, the aircraft weighed up to 8 tons, making it one of the heaviest fighters of the war. It was also noted for its ability to remain airworthy with battle damage.\nThe P-47 was designed around the powerful Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp 18-cylinder radial engine, which also powered the U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair. An advanced turbosupercharger ensured the aircraft's eventual dominance at high altitudes, while also influencing its size and design. The armored cockpit was relatively roomy and comfortable and the sliding bubble canopy introduced on the D variant offered good visibility.\nThe P-47 also served with the air forces of France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, and with Allied Mexican and Brazilian squadrons. It is the namesake of a later U.S. ground-attack aircraft, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. Centennial of Flight Commission, 2003.

It was to replace the Seversky P-35 developed earlier by a Russian immigrant named Alexander P. de Seversky. Both had fled from their homeland, Tbilisi, Georgia, to escape the Bolsheviks.|group=Note}} In 1939, Republic Aviation designed the AP-4 demonstrator powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1830 radial engine with a belly-mounted turbocharger. A small number of Republic P-43 Lancers were built, but Republic had been working on an improved P-44 Rocket with a more powerful engine, as well as on the AP-10 fighter design. The latter was a lightweight aircraft powered by the Allison V-1710 liquid-cooled V-12 engine and armed with two .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) M2 Browning machine guns mounted in the nose and four .30 in (7.62 mm) M1919 Browning machine guns mounted in the wings. The United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) backed the project and gave it the designation XP-47.\nIn the spring of 1940, Republic and the USAAC concluded that the XP-44 and the XP-47 were inferior to Luftwaffe fighters. Republic tried to improve the design, proposing the XP-47A, but this failed. Kartveli then designed a much larger fighter, which was offered to the USAAC in June 1940, which ordered a prototype in September as the XP-47B. The XP-47A, which had little in common with the new design, was abandoned. The XP-47B was of all-metal construction (except for the fabric-covered tail control surfaces) with elliptical wings, with a straight leading edge that was slightly swept back. The P-47's airfoil section was developed by A. Kartveli and was designated as Republic S-3. The air-conditioned cockpit was roomy, and the pilot's seat was comfortable—\"like a lounge chair\", as one pilot later put it. The canopy door initially hinged upward. Main and auxiliary self-sealing fuel tanks were placed under the cockpit, giving a total fuel capacity of .\n[[File:P-47D-40 R 2800 side.jpg|thumb|A P-47 engine with the cowling removed: Uncompressed air enters through an intake under the engine and is carried to the turbosupercharger behind the pilot via the silver duct at the bottom. The olive-green pipe returns the compressed air to the engine.]]\nPower came from a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp two-row, 18-cylinder radial engine producing  — the same engine that powered the prototype Vought XF4U-1 fighter to just over  in October 1940—with the Double Wasp on the XP-47B turning a four-bladed Curtiss Electric constant-speed propeller of  in diameter. The loss of the AP-4 prototype to an engine fire ended Kartveli's experiments with tight-fitting cowlings, so the engine was placed in a broad cowling that opened at the front in a \"horse collar\"-shaped ellipse. The cowling admitted cooling air for the engine, left and right oil coolers, and the turbosupercharger intercooler system. The engine exhaust gases were routed into a pair of wastegate-equipped pipes that ran along each side of the cockpit to drive the turbosupercharger turbine at the bottom of the fuselage, about halfway between cockpit and tail. At full power, the pipes glowed red at their forward ends and the turbine spun at 21,300&nbsp;rpm. The complicated turbosupercharger system with its ductwork gave the XP-47B a deep fuselage, and the wings had to be mounted in a relatively high position. This was difficult, since long-legged main landing gear struts were needed to provide ground clearance for the enormous propeller. To reduce the size and weight of the undercarriage struts, and so wing-mounted machine guns could be fitted, each strut was fitted with a mechanism by which it telescoped out  while it extended.\nThe XP-47B was very heavy compared with contemporary single-engined fighters, with an empty weight of , or 65% more than the YP-43. Kartveli said, \"It will be a dinosaur, but it will be a dinosaur with good proportions\". The armament was eight .50-caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) \"light-barrel\" Browning AN/M2 machine guns, four in each wing. The guns were staggered to allow feeding from side-by-side ammunition boxes, each with 350 rounds. All eight guns gave the fighter a combined rate of fire around 100 rounds per second.\nThe XP-47B first flew on 6 May 1941 with Lowry P. Brabham at the controls. Although minor problems arose, such as some cockpit smoke that turned out to be due to an oil drip, the aircraft proved impressive in its early trials. It was lost in an accident on 8 August 1942, but before that mishap, the prototype had achieved a level speed of  at  altitude and had demonstrated a climb from sea level to  in five minutes.\nThough the XP-47B had its share of shakedown troubles, the newly reorganized United States Army Air Forces placed an order for 171 production aircraft, the first being delivered in December 1941.\nOperational history\nUS service\nBy the end of 1942, P-47Cs were sent to England for combat operations. The initial Thunderbolt flyers, 56th Fighter Group, were sent overseas to join the 8th Air Force. As the P-47 worked up to operational status, it gained a nickname: \"Jug\" (because its profile was similar to that of a common milk jug of the time). Two fighter groups  already stationed in England began introducing the Jugs in January 1943 - the Spitfire-flying 4th Fighter Group, a unit built around a core of experienced American pilots who had flown in the RAF Eagle Squadrons prior to the US entry in the war; and the 78th Fighter Group, formerly flying P-38 Lightnings.\n, 56th Fighter Group, leading ace of the 8th Air Force]]\nBeginning in January 1943, Thunderbolt fighters were sent to the joint Army Air Forces – civilian Millville Airport in Millville, New Jersey, to train civilian and military pilots.\nThe first P-47 combat mission took place 10 March 1943 when the 4th FG took their aircraft on a fighter sweep over France. The mission was a failure due to radio malfunctions. All P-47s were refitted with British radios, and missions resumed 8 April. The first P-47 air combat took place 15 April with Major Don Blakeslee of the 4th FG scoring the Thunderbolt's first air victory (against a Focke-Wulf Fw 190).\nBy mid-1943, the Jug was also in service with the 12th Air Force in Italy and against the Japanese in the Pacific, with the 348th Fighter Group flying missions out of Port Moresby, New Guinea. By 1944, the Thunderbolt was in combat with the USAAF in all its operational theaters except Alaska.\nschemes used on the P-47: This one converged the eight guns into a point at about  out front.]]\nLuftwaffe ace Heinz Bär said that the P-47 \"could absorb an astounding amount of lead [from shooting at it] and had to be handled very carefully\". Although the North American P-51 Mustang replaced the P-47 in the long-range escort role in Europe, the Thunderbolt still ended the war with an aerial kill ratio of 4.6:1 in over 746,000 sorties of all types, at the cost of 3,499 P-47s to all causes in combat. By the end of the war, the 56th FG was the only 8th Air Force unit still flying the P-47, by preference, instead of the P-51. The unit claimed 677-1/2 air victories and 311 ground kills, at the cost of 128 aircraft. Lieutenant Colonel Francis S. Gabreski scored 28 victories, Captain Robert S. Johnson scored 27 aerial victories (with one unconfirmed probable kill leading to some giving his tally as 28), and 56th FG Commanding Officer Colonel Hubert Zemke scored 17.75 kills. Acepilots.com, 29 July 2003. Retrieved: 14 July 2006.|group=Note}} Despite being the sole remaining P-47 group in the 8th Air Force, the 56th FG remained its top-scoring group in aerial victories throughout the war.\nWith increases in fuel capacity as the type was refined, the range of escort missions over Europe steadily increased until the P-47 was able to accompany bombers in raids all the way into Germany. On the way back from the raids, pilots shot up ground targets of opportunity, and also used belly shackles to carry bombs on short-range missions, which led to the realization that the P-47 could perform a dual function on escort missions as a fighter-bomber. Even with its complicated turbosupercharger system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb significant damage and still return home.\nThe P-47 gradually became the USAAF's primary fighter-bomber; by late 1943, early versions of the P-47D carried  bombs underneath their bellies, midproduction versions of the P-47D could carry  bombs and M8 4.5&nbsp;in (115&nbsp;mm) rockets under their wings or from the last version of the P-47D in 1944,  High Velocity Aircraft Rockets (HVARs, also known as \"Holy Moses\"). From D-Day until VE day, Thunderbolt pilots claimed to have destroyed 86,000 railroad cars, 9,000 locomotives, 6,000 armored fighting vehicles, and 68,000 trucks. During Operation Cobra, in the vicinity of Roncey, on 29 July, early in the US break out, the 405th Fighter Group hit a German column trapped between Roncey and St-Denis-le-Vetu by elements of the US 2nd and 3rd Armoured Divisions. The group attacked this column from 3:10pm to 9:40pm. Ground investigations found 66 tanks, 204 vehicles and 11 guns destroyed in this attack.\nMedal of Honor recipients\n, in the cockpit of his P-47 Thunderbolt]]\nTwo P-47 pilots received the Medal of Honor during World War II:\n*USAAF Col. Neel E. Kearby of the 348th Fighter Group was awarded the Medal of Honor for his action during a fighter sweep over the Japanese base at Wewak, New Guinea on 11 October 1943, flying P-47D, serial number  nicknamed \"Fiery Ginger III\". Encountering 40 Japanese planes, Kearby led his flight of four P-47s and in the ensuing combat, he shot down six Japanese planes. After the mission, Kearby would score a total of 22 aerial victores before he was shot down and killed over Wewak in 5 March 1944.\n*USAAF 1st Lt. Raymond L. Knight of the 346th Fighter Squadron of the 350th Fighter Group was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during missions over northern Po Valley, Italy on 24 and 25 April 1945, flying P-47D, serial number  nicknamed \"OH  JOHNNIE\". On 24 April, he repeatedly volunteered to lead attacks on enemy air bases and exposed his P-47 to intense hostile fire in low-altitude reconnaissance and strafing missions. During a mission on the following day, his P-47 was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Knowing that his unit was short on aircraft, he decided against parachuting to safety and instead attempted to fly his P-47 back to his home airbase, but crashed in the Apennine Mountains and was killed.\nPostwar service\nWith the end of World War II, orders for 5,934 were cancelled. Redesignated as F-47 in 1947, the aircraft served with the USAAF through 1947, the USAAF Strategic Air Command from 1946 through 1947, the active-duty United States Air Force (USAF) until 1949, and with the Air National Guard (ANG) until 1953. F-47s served as spotters for rescue aircraft such as the OA-10 Catalina and Boeing B-17H. In 1950, F-47 Thunderbolts were used to suppress the declaration of independence in Puerto Rico by nationalists during the Jayuya Uprising.\nThe F-47 was not deployed to Korea for the Korean War. The USAF and ANG had more North American F-51 (P-51) Mustangs, and used them, mainly in the close air-support role. Since the Mustang was more vulnerable to being shot down—many were lost to antiaircraft fire— some suggested the more durable Thunderbolt should have been sent to Korea in the Mustang's place.\nThe Cuban Air Force took delivery of 29 ex-USAF airframes and spares. By the late 1950s, the F-47 was considered long obsolete as a fighter, but was well suited for counter-insurgency tasks.\nDue to continued postwar service with U.S. military and foreign operators, some Thunderbolts have survived, and a few are still flying.\nP-47 in Allied service\nRepublic Thunderbolt Mark I, displaying the aircraft's \"razorback\" configuration]]\npainted over the USAAF's\nstar and bar.]]\n, England]]\nP-47s were operated by several Allied air arms during World War II. The RAF received 240 razorback P-47Ds, which they designated Thunderbolt Mark I, and 590 bubbletop P-47D-25s, designated Thunderbolt Mark IIs. With no need for another high-altitude fighter, the RAF adapted their Thunderbolts for ground attack, a task for which the type was well suited. Once the Thunderbolts were cleared for use in 1944, they were used against the Japanese in Burma by 16 RAF squadrons of the South East Asia Command from India. Operations with army support (operating as \"cab ranks\" to be called in when needed), attacks on enemy airfields and lines of communication, and escort sorties. They proved devastating in tandem with Spitfires during the Japanese breakout attempt at the Sittang Bend in the final months of the war. The Thunderbolts were armed with three  bombs or, in some cases, British \"\" RP-3 rocket projectiles. Long-range fuel tanks gave five hours of endurance. Thunderbolts flew escort for RAF Liberators in the bombing of Rangoon. Thunderbolts remained in RAF service until October 1946. Postwar RAF Thunderbolts were used in support of the Dutch attempts to reassert control of Batavia. Those squadrons not disbanded outright after the war re-equipped with British-built aircraft such as the Hawker Tempest.\nDuring the Italian campaign, the \"1º Grupo de Caça da Força Aérea Brasileira\" (Brazilian Air Force 1st Fighter Squadron) flew a total of 48 P-47Ds in combat (of a total of 67 received, 19 of which were backup aircraft). This unit flew a total of 445 missions from November 1944 to May 1945 over northern Italy and Central Europe, with 15 P-47s lost to German flak and five pilots being killed in action. In the early 1980s, this unit was awarded the \"Presidential Unit Citation\" by the American government in recognition for its achievements in World War II.\nFrom March 1945 to the end of the war in the Pacific—as Mexico had declared war on the Axis on May 22, 1942—the Mexican Escuadrón Aéreo de Pelea 201 (201st Fighter Squadron) operated P-47Ds as part of the U.S. 5th Air Force in the Philippines. In 791 sorties against Japanese forces, the 201st lost no pilots or aircraft to enemy action.\nThe Free French Air Forces received 446 P-47Ds from 1943. These aircraft saw extensive action in France and Germany and again in the 1950s during the Algerian War of Independence.\nAfter World War II, the Italian Air Force (AMI) received 75 P-47D-25s sent to 5˚ Stormo, and 99 to the 51˚. These machines were delivered between 1947 and 1950. However, they were not well liked, as the Italian pilots were used to much lighter aircraft and found the controls too heavy. Nevertheless, the stability, payload, and high speed were appreciated. Most importantly, the P-47 served as an excellent transition platform to heavier jet fighters, including the F-84 Thunderjet, starting in 1953.\nThe type was provided to many Latin American air forces, some of which operated it into the 1960s. Small numbers of P-47s were also provided to China, Iran, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.\nIn Soviet service\nIn mid-1943, the Soviet high command showed an interest in the P-47B. Three P-47D-10-REs were ferried to the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) via Alaska in March 1944. Two of them were tested in April–May 1944. Test pilot Aleksey N. Grinchik noted the spacious cockpit with good ventilation and a good all-around view. He found it easy to fly and stable upon take-off and landing, but it showed excessive rolling stability and poor directional stability. Soviet engineers disassembled the third aircraft to examine its construction. They appreciated the high production standards and rational design well-suited to mass production, and the high reliability of the hard-hitting Browning machine guns. With its high service ceiling, the P-47 was superior to fighters operating on the Eastern front, yielding a higher speed above . The Yakovlev Yak-9, Lavochkin La-5FN, Messerschmitt Bf 109G, and Focke-Wulf Fw 190A outperformed the early model P-47 at low and medium altitude, where the P-47 had poor acceleration and performed aerobatics rather reluctantly.\nIn mid-1944, 200 P-47D-22-REs and P-47D-27-REs were ferried to the USSR via Iraq and Iran. Many were sent to training units. Less than half reached operational units, and they were rarely used in combat. The fighters were assigned to high-altitude air defense over major cities in rear areas.\nUnlike their Western counterparts, the VVS made little use of the P-47 as a  ground-attack aircraft, depending, instead, on their own Ilyushin Il-2. At the end of the war, Soviet units held 188 P-47s.\nIn German service\nThe Luftwaffe operated at least one captured P-47. In poor weather on 7 November 1943, while flying a P-47D-2-RA on a bomber escort mission, 2nd Lt. William E. Roach of 358th Fighter Squadron, 355th Fighter Group made an emergency landing on a German airfield. Roach was imprisoned at Stalag Luft I. The Thunderbolt was given German markings.\nIn Chinese service\nAfter World War II, the Chinese Nationalist Air Force received 102 P-47Ds used during the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Communists captured five P-47Ds from the Chinese Nationalist forces. In 1948, the Chinese Nationalists employed 70 P-47Ds and 42 P-47Ns brought to Taiwan in 1952. P-47s were used extensively in aerial clashes over the Taiwan Strait between Nationalist and Communist aircraft.\nFlying the Thunderbolt\nAerial warfare\nInitial response to the P-47 praised its dive speed and high-altitude performance, while criticizing its turning performance and rate of climb (particularly at low to medium altitudes). The turbosupercharger in the P-47 gave the powerplant its maximum power at , and in the thin air above , the Thunderbolt remained fast and nimble compared to other aircraft.\nThe P-47 first saw action with the 4th Fighter Group, whose pilots were mainly drawn from the three British Eagle Squadrons, who had previously flown the British Spitfire Mark V, a much smaller and much more slender aircraft. At first, they viewed their new fighter with misgivings. It was huge; the British pilots joked that a Thunderbolt pilot could defend himself from a Luftwaffe fighter by running around and hiding in the fuselage. Optimized for high-altitude work, the Thunderbolt had  more wingspan, a quarter more wing area, about four times the fuselage volume, and nearly twice the weight of a Spitfire V. One Thunderbolt pilot compared it to flying a bathtub around the sky. When his unit (4th Fighter Group) was equipped with Thunderbolts, ace Don Blakeslee said, referring to the P-47's vaunted ability to dive on its prey, \"It ought to be able to dive. It certainly can't climb.\" (Blakeslee's early-model P-47C had not been fitted with the new paddle blade propeller). The 4th Fighter Group's commander hated the P-47, and his prejudices filtered down to the group's pilots; the 4th had the fewest kills of any of the first three P-47 squadrons in Europe.\nU.S. ace James A. Goodson, who had flown Spitfires with the RAF and flew a P-47 in 1943, at first shared the skepticism of other pilots for their \"seven-ton milk bottles\", but Goodson learned to appreciate the P-47's potential: There were many U.S. pilots who preferred the P-47 to anything else; they do not agree that the (Fw) 190 held an overall edge against it.\nThe P-47's initial success in combat was primarily due to tactics, using rolls (the P-47 had an excellent roll rate) and energy-saving dive and zoom climbs from high altitude to outmaneuver German fighters. Both the Bf 109 and Fw 190 could, like the Spitfire, out-turn and out-climb the early model P-47s at low to medium altitudes, since these early P-47s had mediocre climb performance due to the lack of paddle-blade propellers. The arrival of the new Curtiss paddle-blade propeller in early 1944 significantly increased climb rate at lower altitudes and came as a surprise to German pilots, who had resorted to steep climbs to evade pursuit by the P-47.  Some P-47 pilots claimed to have broken the sound barrier in steep dives, but later research revealed that because of the pressure buildup inside the pitot tube at high speeds, airspeed readings became unpredictably exaggerated. As P-47s were able to out-dive enemy fighter planes, German pilots gradually learned to avoid diving away. Kurt Bühligen, a high-scoring German fighter ace with 112 victories, recalled:\nThe P-47 was very heavy, too heavy for some maneuvers. We would see it coming from behind, and pull up fast, and the P-47 couldn't follow and we came around and got on its tail in this way.\nOther positive attributes included the P-47's ruggedness; its radial piston engine had a high tolerance for damage compared to liquid-cooled engines, while its large size meant it could sustain a large amount of damage and still be able to get its pilot back to base. With eight .50 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, the P-47 carried more firepower than other single-engined American fighters. P-47 pilots claimed 20 Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters and four Arado Ar 234 jet bombers in aerial combat.\nGround attack role\nThe P-47 proved to be a formidable fighter-bomber due to its good armament, heavy bomb load, and ability to survive enemy fire. The P-47's survivability was due in part to its radial piston engine, which unlike comparable liquid-cooled engines, had a high tolerance for damage. The Thunderbolt's eight .50 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns were capable against lightly armored targets, although less so than cannon-armed aircraft of the day. In a ground-attack role, the armor-piercing, armor-piercing incendiary, and armor-piercing incendiary tracer ammunition proved useful in penetrating thin-skinned and lightly armored German vehicles and causing their fuel tanks to explode, as well as occasionally damaging some types of enemy armored fighting vehicles (AFVs).\nP-47 pilots frequently carried two  bombs, using skip bombing techniques for difficult targets (skipping bombs into railroad tunnels to destroy hidden enemy trains was a favorite tactic). The adoption of the triple-tube M10 rocket launcher with M8 high-explosive  rockets (each with an explosive force similar to a 105&nbsp;mm artillery shell)—much as the RAF's Hawker Typhoon gained when first fitted with its own two quartets of underwing RP-3 rockets for the same purposes—significantly increased the P-47's ground attack capability. Late in the war, the P-47 was retrofitted with more powerful  HVAR rockets.\nOperators\n]]\nover Tehran]]\n* Bolivian Air Force - acquired a single P-47D in 1949, but the aircraft was never flown by the Bolivian Air Force and was used as an instructional airframe.\n* Brazilian Expeditionary Force, Brazilian Air Force\n** 85 units 1st Brazilian Fighter Group, 1944–1954\n* Chilean Air Force\n* Republic of China Air Force\n* Colombian Air Force (1947–1957)\n* Cuban Air Force (post-war)\n* Dominican Air Force (1952–1957)\n* Ecuadorian Air Force (1947–1959)\n* Free French Air Force\n* French Air Force\n* Luftwaffe – used some captured specimens\nIran\n* Imperial Iranian Air Force – 50 delivered 1948\n* Italian Air Force – 100 received 1950\n* Mexican Expeditionary Air Force\n** Escuadrón 201\n* Fuerza Aerea de Nicaragua (provided by the CIA post 1954 action in Guatemala)\n* Peruvian Air Force (56 aircraft, July 1947 – 1963)\n* Portuguese Air Force (post-war)\n* Soviet Air Force\n* Turkish Air Force – operated 180 P-47Ds from 1948 and 1954.\n* Royal Air Force\n* United States Army Air Forces\n* United States Air Force\n* Venezuelan Air Force\n* Yugoslav Air Force (150 aircraft, 1952)\nFile:P47 D normandie niemen.jpg|P-47D French Algeria 1952\nFile:P47D 460th FS.jpg|P-47D 460th Fighter squadron Philippines 1944\nFile:P47D 509th Fighter Squadron 1944.jpg|P-47D 509th Fighter squadron England 1944\nFile:P47D 334th Fighter squadron 1944.jpg|P-47D 334th Fighter Squadron England 1944\nFile:P47D ardennes.jpg|P-47D Groupe de chasse III/3 Ardennes 1944\nVariants\nSurviving aircraft\nSpecifications (P-47D-40 Thunderbolt)\n|prime units?=imp\n|crew=1\n|length ft=36\n|length in=1+3/4\n|length sigfig=4\n|span ft=40\n|span in=9+5/16\n|span sigfig=4\n|height ft=14\n|height in=8+1/16\n|height sigfig=4\n|wing area sqft= 300\n|wing area note=\n|airfoil=Seversky S-3\n|empty weight lb=10,000\n|gross weight lb=13,230\n|max takeoff weight lb=17,500\n|fuel capacity=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Pratt & Whitney R-2800-59\n|eng1 type=18-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine\n|eng1 hp=2000\n|prop blade number=4\n|prop name=Curtiss Electric C542S constant-speed propeller\n|prop dia ft=13\n|prop dia in=0\n|max speed mph=426\n|max speed note=at\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range miles=1030\n|range note=\n|ceiling ft=42000\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=44\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|armament=\n* 8 ×  M2 Browning machine guns with 425 rounds per gun (3400 rounds total)\n* Up to  of bombs\n* 10 ×  HVAR unguided rockets\n|avionics=\n}}\nIn popular culture\n, 2012]]\nBroadcast radio interviews of several wartime P-47 pilots appear on the CD audiobook USAAF at War 1942–45, including an account by Lieutenant J.
