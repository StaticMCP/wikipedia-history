(sometimes stylized Invasion USA) is a 1952 American drama film based on a story by Robert Smith and Franz Spencer, and directed by Alfred E. Green. The film stars Gerald Mohr, Peggie Castle, and Dan O'Herlihy. Invasion, U.S.A. is set in the Cold War and portrays the invasion of the United States by an unnamed communist enemy which likely refers to the Soviet Union. It is typical of the Red Scare film genre, which was common throughout the 1950s.\nPlot\nIn a New York City bar, the brooding, mysterious forecaster Mr. Ohman is seated alone, drinking brandy. He gets into discussions with a cross-section of affluent Americans at the bar, including\n* local television newscaster Vince Potter,\n* beautiful, young New York society woman Carla Sanford,\n* a California industrialist,\n* an Arizona rancher, and\n* a congressman.\nInternational news is bad, but the Americans do not want to hear it. They all enjoy their material wealth, dislike communism, want lower taxes, and reject the need for industrial support of government. Ohman tells them that many Americans want safety and security but do not want to make any sacrifices to ensure it.\nSuddenly, the news becomes worse. \"The Enemy\" is staging air attacks over Seal Point, Alaska and then Nome. Paratroops have landed on Alaskan airfields. Soon, the enemy's plan of attack becomes clear: Civilian airfields are captured as staging areas while military airfields are A-bombed. US forces fight back and attack the enemy's homeland with Convair B-36 sorties, but the enemy forces steadily move into Washington state and Oregon. Shipyards in Puget Sound are hit with atomic attacks, causing massive casualties.\nMeanwhile, the Americans at the bar scramble to do what they can against the enemy attacks. Potter and Sanford become romantically interested in each other. He continues to broadcast while she volunteers at a blood drive. The industrialist and the rancher return to their homes to find themselves on the front lines. The former is caught in the battle for San Francisco and is shot in his office, while the rancher is close to the destruction of Boulder Dam by a nuclear missile which results in a tidal wave, flooding much of the country downriver and overcoming the rancher and his family as they attempt to flee from it. The US president makes ineffectual broadcasts with inflated claims of counterattacks to rally the morale of the people. The enemy continues to advance with stealth attacks by troops dressed in American uniforms, including a paratrooper attack on the US Capitol that kills the congressman. New York is hit with an atomic bomb, and Potter is killed at Sandford's apartment by enemy soldiers; threatened with rape, Sanford jumps to her death from the building.\nBack in the bar, all five characters find themselves emerging from a hypnotic state that Ohman tells them he had induced. After being reassured that the recent events were an illusion, they hurry off to take measures to boost the country's military preparedness, and Potter and Sanford \"resume\" their romance.\nCast\n* Gerald Mohr as Vince Potter\n* Peggie Castle as Carla Sanford\n* Dan O'Herlihy as Mr. Ohman\n* Robert Bice as George Sylvester\n* Tom Kennedy as Tim the bartender\n* Wade Crosby as Illinois Congressman Arthur V.

Shoop as Army Major\n* Joseph Granby as President of the United States (uncredited)\n* William Schallert as third newscaster (uncredited)\n* John Crawford as man in bar (uncredited)\nProduction\nInvasion, U.S.A. was the second film from American Pictures Corporation, who had just made their first film, Captive Women. The company consisted of Albert Zugsmith, Peter Miller, Aubrey Wisberg, and Jack Pollexfen, with Joseph Justman as producer. They planned to make six films per year for five years out of a fund of $3.5 million. Robert Smith wrote the script. The film had the cooperation of the US Civil Defense.\nHarold Daniels was to direct, but he was instead assigned to American Pictures Corporation's Port Sinister; Alfred E. Green replaced him. Ron Randell was meant to appear in the cast but had to pull out. William Schallert replaced Clete Roberts; Gerald Mohr replaced Michael O'Shea. Filming started 26 March 1952.\nZugsmith said the film was made for a cash budget of $127,000 with $60,000 deferred. He referred to the movie as the way that he really learned filmmaking, and got an education from Al Green and Ralph Black in particular.\n\"The Enemy\" is never named but is clearly meant to be interpreted as the communist Soviet Union because of its approach through Alaska, pseudo-Slavic accents, and \"People's Army\" proclamations. Principal photography began in early April 1952 at Motion Picture Center Studios.\nMuch of the film's running time is taken up with WWII combat stock footage.\nPhilosophically, Invasion, U.S.A. is also often viewed as humorously (and unintentionally) ironic, as the lesson it communicates encourages citizens to subordinate their individual needs and desires to that of the state to combat communism.\nPhyllis Coates and Noel Neill (two Lois Lane actresses), and William Schallert (B-movie and TV stalwart/newscaster) all have small parts in the film. O'Herlihy had the distinction of co-starring in another Cold War drama&mdash;climaxing with the nuclear destruction of New York&mdash;when he appeared in 1964's Fail Safe.\nReception and legacy\nA contemporary review in Variety states: \"This production imaginatively poses the situation of a foreign power invading the US with atom bombs. Startling aspects of the screenplay [from a story by Robert Smith and Franz Spencer] are further parlayed through effective use of war footage secured from the various armed services and the Atomic Energy Commission.\"\nThe film was commercially successful and brought in net profits of about $1.2 million, according to Zugsmith.\nInvasion, U.S.A. was later shown on television in the late 1960s but then was not widely viewed for a long time until 1994, when it was spoofed as episode #602 on the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000 alongside the 1950 education short A Date with Your Family.\nIn 1998, Invasion, U.S.A. was released on VHS, then on DVD in 2002. A special edition in 2009 featured two original Civil Defense Department audio recordings on the alternate DVD audio track: The Complacent Americans and If the Bomb Falls: A Recorded Guide to Survival. This edition also featured the theatrical trailer for the 1956 reissue as well as interviews with stars Dan O'Herlihy, William Schallert, and Noel Neill. The original and controversial \"Red Scare\" short Red Nightmare, narrated by Jack Webb, was also included in the bonus features.\nSee also\n*Face to Face with Communism\n*Invasion U.S.A.
