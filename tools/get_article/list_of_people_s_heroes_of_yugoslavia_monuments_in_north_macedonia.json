Many busts and memorials were built in honor of each People's hero. Each of them usually had a bust in his birthplace or at the place of his death. Most of these monuments are built in figurative style, but some of them were completely abstract, for example, monument of Ivo Lola Ribar, built at Glamoč field in 1962.\nMonument list\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Name\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Stevan Naumov - Stiv\n|Bitola\n|Dedicated to Stevan Naumov, member of the Central committee of the Communist party of Macedonia.\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Lazar Koliševski\n|Sveti Nikole\n|Built in 2001.
