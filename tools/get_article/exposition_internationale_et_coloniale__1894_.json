The exposition drew unwanted attention with the assassination of French President Sadi Carnot by the Anarchist Sante Geronimo Caserio, during his visit on 24 June 1894; he died the day after. The exposition drew 3.8 million visitors.\nHistory\nThe exposition was initially planned as a national exposition to be held in 1892. However, the short interval since the Paris 1889 Universal Exposition led to a postponement of two years and a call for international participation.\nSeveral names were given to the project: \"l’Exposition internationale et coloniale de Lyon, en 1894,\" \"Exposition nationale de Lyon en 1894,\" and \"l’Exposition universelle de 1894\" before the eventual name \"Exposition internationale et coloniale.\" At the same time, San Francisco and Antwerp organised world's fairs as well.\n3.8 million people visited the exposition, and its success led to the renaming of the neighbourhood next to the exposition from Tête d'Or to Tonkin de villeurbanne, thus referring to North Vietnam (Tonkin), at that time part of French Indochina, to satisfy the inhabitants attracted to the exotic colonial atmosphere.\nOrganization\nThe main building of the exposition was a 55-metre-high metal dome with a diameter of 242 metres. Several themes got dedicated pavilions:\n* Education (palais de l’enseignement)\n* City of Paris\n* City of Lyon and the surroundings (département du Rhône)\n* Faith (palais des arts religieux)\n* Economy (''palais de l'économie sociale)\n* Art\n* Agriculture\n* Labour\n* Railways\n* Civil engineering\n* Forestry services\nFrench colonies were represented as well in four pavilions:\n* Algeria (palais de l’Algérie)\n* Tunisia (palais de la Tunisie)\n* French Indochina (palais de l’Indochine)\n* French West Africa (palais de l’Afrique occidentale'').\nSee also\n* Hanoi exhibition, another colonial exhibition, 8 years later, in French Indochina\nReferences"
