It aimed to represent women workers, by helping them gain representation on relevant bodies at the local, national and international level.  It became closely aligned with the Labour Party, and the Chief Women's Officer of the party acted as the group's secretary.\nIn 1931 Dorothy Elliott chaired the committee and she was also the lead for the National Labour Women’s Conference. She advocated minimum wages for a million workers who were in domestic service and catering. The policy was adopted by the Labour Conference that year but it went no further.\nBy 1932, the group's constitution stated that the following organisations could become affiliates: \"the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress, the Women's Co-operative Guild, and the Railway Women's Guild; and organisations affiliated to the Labour Party or the Trades Union Congress, of which a substantial number of the members are women, which are national in character, and are accepted by the committee\".\nIn 1941, the group was renamed as the ''Standing Joint Committee of Working Women's Organisations''', and then in 1952 it adopted its final name.\nBy 1993, the group's members believed that its purposes were better served by other organisations in the labour movement, and it dissolved.\nSecretaries\n:1916: Mary Longman\n:1917: Marion Phillips\n:1932: Mary Sutherland\n:1960: Sara Barker\n:1962: Constance Kay\n:1967: Betty Lockwood\n:1975: Joyce Gould\n:1985: Anne Wilkinson\nChairs\n:1916: Mary Macarthur\n:1921: Margaret Bondfield\n:1923: Florence Harrison Bell\n:1925: Ellen Wilkinson\n:1928: Jennie Lee\n:1930: Clara Rackham\n:1931: Dorothy Elliott\n:1931: Barbara Ayrton-Gould\n:1932: Susan Lawrence\n:1934: Eleanor Barton\n:1935: Anne Loughlin\n:1937: Anne Godwin\n:1938: Grace Colman\n:1940: E.
