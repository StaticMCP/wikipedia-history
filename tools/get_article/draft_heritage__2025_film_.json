The film follows Fariba, a woman in her sixties who has dedicated her life to caring for her elderly parents—her mother living with Alzheimer’s and her father in declining health—while quietly confronting the emotional cost of self-sacrifice and duty.\nExploring themes of love, responsibility, and identity, Heritage presents an intimate portrayal of family caregiving and the boundaries between devotion and selfhood. The film had its world premiere at the 2025 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto, where it screened in the International Spectrum Competition section.\nProduced under the Documentary Film Workshop banner, the documentary features cinematography by Najafi himself, music by Pejman Khalili, and sound design by Alireza Alavian.\nPlot\nHeritage centers on Fariba, a devoted woman in her sixties who has placed her own life on hold to care for her aging parents. Her mother suffers from Alzheimer’s disease, while her father’s fragile health requires constant attention. Despite having her own home, Fariba spends her days tending to their needs, sharing caregiving responsibilities with her brother, who takes over at night.\nThe film observes the quiet rhythm of her life, exploring how love and obligation blur the boundaries of identity. Through restrained imagery and long takes, director Mir Mohammad Najafi captures the weight of sacrifice and the question at the heart of the film: how do we reconcile duty toward those we love with the desire to live a life of our own?\nProduction\nThe project was developed by Najafi over a six-year period. It was produced by Mohsen Ostad Ali through the Documentary Film Workshop, with post-production contributions from Babak Haidari (editing), Pejman Khalili (music), and Alireza Alavian (sound design). Color correction and lighting were supervised by Hamidreza Fatourehchiyan and Farhad Talebinezhad.\nAccording to production notes, Heritage was conceived as a meditative study of familial resilience, employing observational techniques and minimal dialogue to convey emotion through silence and framing.\nRelease\nHeritage had its world premiere at the 2025 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto, Canada, where it competed in the International Spectrum Competition section.\nThe film is represented internationally by Raft Films. Additional festival screenings are expected following its premiere.\nFestivals\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Festival\n! scope=\"col\"| Section\n! scope=\"col\"| Country\n|-\n| 2025 || Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival || International Spectrum Competition || Canada\n|}\nReception\nAs of October 2025, Heritage has been noted in international media coverage of the 2025 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.
