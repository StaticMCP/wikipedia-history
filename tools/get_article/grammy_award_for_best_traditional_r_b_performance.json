The award was first given in 1999; until 2003, only albums were nominated, now just singles or tracks are. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.\" As of the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, the eligibility criteria for the category was amended to \"more accurately represent recordings that embody the classical elements of R&B/soul music, distinguishing them from contemporary interpretations of the genre\".\nBetween 1999 and 2002, this accolade was originally known as Best Traditional R&B Vocal Album. It was renamed in 2003 as  Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance. Since 2012, the category has been known as Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nThe award goes to the artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.\nAs of the 68th Annual Grammy Awards, Lalah Hathaway and Beyoncé have the most wins (3) in this category, and Hathaway has the most nominations (6) in this category. At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, two-year-old Hazel Monét became the youngest ever Grammy nominee for her feature on her mother's song, \"Hollywood\".\nRecipients\nwas the first recipient of the award.]]\nis the second most awarded artist in the category, with two wins.]]\nis tied with Beyoncé as the most awarded artist in this category, with three wins.]]\nis tied with Lalah Hathaway as the most awarded artist in this category, with three wins.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Recipient(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|1999\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2000\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2001\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2002\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2003\n|  and the Funk Brothers\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2004\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2005\n| Prince\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2006\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2007\n|  and Al Jarreau featuring Jill Scott\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2008\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2009\n|  featuring Anthony Hamilton\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2010\n| Beyoncé\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2011\n|  and the Roots\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2012\n|  featuring Melanie Fiona\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2013\n| Beyoncé\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2014\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2015\n| Robert Glasper Experiment featuring Lalah Hathaway and Malcolm-Jamal Warner\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2016\n|rowspan=2|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2017\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2018\n| Childish Gambino\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|2019\n|\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=2|\n|-\n|  featuring Yebba\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2020\n| Lizzo\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"|2021\n| Ledisi\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"|2022\n| H.E.R.\n| \"Fight for You\"\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"|2023\n| Beyoncé\n| \"Plastic Off the Sofa\"\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"|2024\n| PJ Morton featuring Susan Carol\n| \"Good Morning\"\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"|2025\n| Lucky Daye\n| \"That's You\"\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"|2026\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nSee also\n* List of Grammy Award categories\n* List of R&B musicians\nReferences\n; General\n*\n; Specific\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grammy.com/ Official site of the Grammy Awards]"
