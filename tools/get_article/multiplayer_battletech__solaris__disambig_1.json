At its height on the AOL server, thousands of players competed simultaneously in arenas of two to eight participants, battling in team games or free-for-alls. After AOL initiated its hourly pay-for-play system, the majority of players moved to the GameStorm service, which operated for a number of years until its purchase by Electronic Arts.\nDuring its run, the game's player-driven community grouped themselves into armies representing the various Successor States, or independent stables, or mercenary units.  Though the in-game software did not support official groups, the player-driven units became close-knit communities, even after the games cancellation in 2001.\nThe game was a follow-up to Multiplayer BattleTech: EGA; it was in turn succeeded by Multiplayer BattleTech 3025.\nReception\nIn 1997, Next Generation named Multiplayer BattleTech: Solaris as number two on their \"Top 10 Online Game Picks\", reasoning that \"Kesmai's newest first-person BattleTech game may not have the glitz of MechWarrior 2, but it can stand on the same level - it is a more subtle, almost truer-to-life game ...\" In 2000, Computer Games Strategy Plus named the Multiplayer Battletech series collectively one of the \"10 Best Sci-Fi Simulations\". The magazine's Steve Bauman called it \"the definitive online BattleTech experience.\"\nThe game won a 1996 NewMedia Invision \"Gold Award\" for Best Online/Multi-user Game.\nSee also\n* MechWarrior\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/19981203034409/http://www.multiplayerbattletech.com/ The MultiPlayer BattleTech Archive]"
