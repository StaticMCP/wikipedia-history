He was the eldest son of Maharana Raj Singh I. Jai Singh was involved the military conflicts against the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. He is also known for building the Dhebar lake (also known as Jaisamand).\nConflicts with the Mughals\nTreaty and territorial concessions\nUnlike his predecessors, Jai Singh opted for diplomacy to maintain peace with the Mughals. He signed a treaty with Aurangzeb in 1681, conceding three districts and agreeing to a tribute in exchange for a cessation of hostilities. This decision, however, was met with disapproval from a faction within Mewar, who believed it compromised their sovereignty.\nMilitary engagements\nJai Singh was posted in the hills near Girwa by his father Raj Singh I, to encounter the invading Mughal army in 1679. In 1680, Aurangzeb left Mewar and reached Ajmer after the occupation of Udaipur, Chittor and the destruction of several villages and temples. Jai Singh with a strong army conducted a surprise attack on Chittor and caused heavy casualties in the Mughal army. The resistance, energy and night raids of Rajputs made it difficult for the Mughal outposts to maintain their position.\nDespite the treaty, skirmishes and military confrontations between Mewar and the Mughal forces continued throughout Jai Singh's reign. In 1681, it is claimed that he successfully captured the strategically significant fort of Mandalgarh from the Mughals. However, neither side was able to achieve a decisive victory in the prolonged conflict.\nReferences"
