The award is named for Bobby Dodd, longtime head football coach at Georgia Tech and was established in 1976 to honor the values that Dodd exemplified.  Award recipients are chosen by a selection committee composed of college football experts and all previous recipients.  The recipient is announced during halftime of the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl in Atlanta. A formal presentation is held later, usually on the university campus of the recipient. Winners from the previous two seasons, as well as coaches in their first year at their current programs, are ineligible for the award.\nWinners\nTwo coaches have won the award twice: Bill Snyder of Kansas State University, won in 1998 and again in 2012, and Joe Paterno of Penn State who received the award in 1981 and again in 2005.
