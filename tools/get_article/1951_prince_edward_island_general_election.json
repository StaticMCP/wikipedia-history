Walter Jones held on to their majority in the Legislature over the opposition Progressive Conservatives led by Reginald Bell, who was elected leader of the party in 1950. Both parties kept the same number of seats they earned in the previous election, though eight seats did change hands.\nThe democratic socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation fell back from their previous high in 1947, losing over half of their vote. This would be the last election contested by the CCF or any third party in provincial PEI elections until the CCF's successor, the New Democratic Party, ran in by-elections in 1972.\nThis election featured the first female candidate for office, Hilda Ramsay, who came in third while running for the CCF as Councillor in 3rd Prince.\nParty Standings\n{| style=\"width:55%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#EA6D6A; width:80.00%;\" | 24\n| style=\"background:#9999FF; width:20.00%;\" | 6\n|-\n| Liberal\n| PC\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1947\n!Elected\n!Change\n!#\n!%\n!Change\n|Liberal\n|J.

This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
