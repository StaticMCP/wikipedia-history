      "text": "# Great Public Schools Association of Queensland\n\nThe Great Public Schools Association of Queensland Inc. (GPS) is an association of nine south-east Queensland secondary schools established in 1918. With the exception of Brisbane State High School, GPS schools are all-male, private schools. Similar associations exist in New South Wales (AAGPS) and Victoria (APS).\nSchools\nCurrent member schools\nThere have been critics of the GPS competition of Brisbane State High's membership to the GPS Competition, primarily because it is the only Public School in the GPS competition. However, its membership is maintained despite dispute. The term \"Public Schools\" in the GPS acronym encompasses all public education including the Grammar Schools who are indeed themselves Public Schools.
