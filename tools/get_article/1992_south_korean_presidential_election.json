Voter turnout was 81.9%.\nIn the first regular presidential election with no military candidates since 1960, Kim Young-sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party won with 42 percent of the vote.\nBackground\nin 1992, Roh Tae-woo. His term expired on 25 February 1993.]]\nOn 22 January 1990 two opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil merged their parties into the ruling party Democratic Justice Party to form the Democratic Liberal Party, led by President Roh Tae-woo. Before they merged, Roh's party did not have a majority in the National Assembly. After they merged, they had over a two-thirds majority, which could pass bills without any obstruction from the opposition. Roh could not run for re-election due to the constitution limiting the president to a single five-year term.\nKim Dae-jung, an opponent in the 1987 election who finished third behind Kim Young-sam and Roh Tae-woo ran again in 1992. Hyundai businessman Chung Ju-yung also ran in the election.\nNominations\nDemocratic Liberal Party\nThe Democratic Liberal Party national convention was held on 19 May at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena. Nine-term lawmaker from Busan Kim Young-sam won the nomination, defeating four-term lawmaker from Seoul Lee Jong-chan, who did not concede and ran as a third party candidate. Lee Jong-chan withdrew his campaign and endorsed RNP nominee Chung Ju-yung in December.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+3,331 delegates needed to win\n!Candidate\n!Delegates\n!%\n|-\n|Kim Young-sam\n|4,418\n|66.34\n|-\n|Lee Jong-chan\n|2,214\n|33.24\n|-\n|Invalid/blank votes\n|28\n|0.42\n|-\n|Total\n|6,660\n|100%\n|-\n|Abstentions\n|222\n|3.23\n|}\nDemocratic Party\nThe Democratic National Convention was held from 25 to 26 May at the Olympic Fencing Gymnasium.
