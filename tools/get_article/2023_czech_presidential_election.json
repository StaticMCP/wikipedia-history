Petr Pavel, former chair of the NATO Military Committee, ran as an independent on a pro-Western, pro-European platform, and was one of three candidates backed by the centre-right governing alliance Spolu. He won the first round of the election with 35.40% of the popular vote, ahead of Andrej Babiš, the former Czech prime minister running as the candidate of ANO, who finished second with 34.99%. Babiš had expressed opposition to Czech support for Ukraine after the Russian invasion and was characterised in the media as using populist rhetoric. For the runoff, Pavel was backed by most eliminated candidates and by the incumbent prime minister Petr Fiala, while Babiš received an endorsement from the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and the outgoing president Zeman.\nThe second round was held on 27 and 28 January. Pavel won the runoff against Babiš with 58.33% of the vote to become the Czech Republic president-elect. He assumed office on 9 March 2023, replacing Zeman. Babiš conceded defeat and congratulated Pavel. Voter turnout in the second round was a little above 70%, the highest in a direct Czech presidential election and the highest in any national Czech election since 1998.\nThe campaign was widely described in the media as divisive. The outcome of the election was viewed as a sign of support for the West in the context of the war in Ukraine, and is expected to strengthen Czech ties with the European Union and the United States.\nBackground\nBefore 2020\nInitial speculation about the 2023 election began after the first direct presidential election in 2013. Political scientist Ladislav Cabada said that he expected the new president to be younger than Miloš Zeman when he was elected in 2013. Jiří Dienstbier Jr. was often mentioned as a potential left-wing candidate. Cabada mentioned Petr Fiala as a possible right-wing candidate. There was also speculation that ANO 2011 leader Andrej Babiš, who later became Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, might run for president in 2023. At the previous election in January 2018, Zeman was elected for his second and final term. After Zeman's victory in 2018, there was speculation that the next election might be held sooner than 2023 due to Zeman's health. Speculation about possible successors to Zeman started soon after the election, with bookmakers considering Václav Klaus Jr. as the favourite. Babiš stated that his party would nominate its own candidate for the next election.\nIn summer 2019, the leaders of the opposition Civic Democratic Party, Pirate Party, KDU-ČSL, TOP 09 and Mayors and Independents met to discuss a possible common candidate. The most discussed candidate was retired army general Petr Pavel. Other names included Miroslava Němcová and Věra Jourová. The Czech Social Democratic Party was also invited to the meeting but declined as it planned to support Josef Středula, the president of the Bohemian-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions. Speculation about Zeman's health was renewed in October 2019 when Zeman went into hospital and talked about his possible successors, noting Babiš, Josef Středula, and Vladimír Dlouhý. Senator Marek Hilšer announced his candidacy on 21 November 2019. He started gathering signatures for his nomination on the same day.\nAfter 2020\nPavel launched an initiative called \"Stronger Together\" in April 2020, aimed at helping those working in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, especially in crowdfunding financial support for volunteers helping in hospitals or creating medical tools. Political commentators including Petr Holec and Ondřej Leinert suggested that the initiative was a launch of Pavel's presidential bid, noting the similarity with Hillary Clinton's slogan during the 2016 United States presidential election. Pavel said in July 2021 that he planned to run for the presidency and was preparing his campaign. Pavel also visited various regions, which was described by journalists including Tereza Šídlová as a campaign activity.\nThe 2021 legislative election resulted in defeat for ANO 2011 and a majority for the opposition parties in the Chamber of Deputies. This prompted speculation that Babiš might run for the presidency following his defeat in the legislative election. Following the election on 10 October, Zeman was hospitalised again, casting doubts over how and when the government formation talks would be held. On 11 October, a spokesman for the hospital said that Zeman's condition had stabilised, but he could not yet talk about the prognosis: \"The reason for [Zeman's] hospitalization are complications from the illnesses for which he has been receiving treatments.\" Fiala, the leader of the Spolu coalition, stated on 12 October 2021 that the alliance would nominate a candidate.\nOn 18 October 2021, Miloš Vystrčil, the president of the Senate of the Czech Republic, announced he had received a letter from the Central Military Hospital declaring Zeman unfit to fulfil his duties as the president, and indicated plans to trigger Article 66 of the constitution to temporarily remove Zeman from office. In response, the Senate announced their intention to transfer Zeman's constitutional powers to Babiš and the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Radek Vondráček, also of ANO 2011. However, he was discharged from hospital on 27 November 2021 and resumed his duties. Babiš stated on 20 November 2021 that he would run for the presidency if his supporters gathered the required 50,000 signatures. Security analyst Miloslav Ondra launched an initiative to do so and started gathering signatures at Anděl metro station on 1 December 2021, reaching 200 signatures. According to Ondra, he had around 50 gathering stations across the Czech Republic.\nCandidates\nTo qualify for the ballot, a candidate had to gather 50,000 signatures from citizens or the support of twenty deputies or ten senators. The candidate must file their application and signatures 66 days before the election, following which the Interior Ministry will verify a sample of the signatures.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Official candidates\n|-\n!

She was initially registered as a candidate, which was met with criticism from constitutional lawyers such as Jan Kysela and Jan Wintr, who argued that her application should have been rejected due to being filed prematurely, before the official announcement of the presidential election on 27 June 2022. Her registration was contested before the Supreme Administrative Court by several senators, and she was subsequently disqualified from the election by a court ruling.\n* Josef Roušal\n* Milan Tomeček\n* Pavel Zítko\nWithdrawn\n* Josef Středula, president of the Bohemian-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions was running with the nominations of 11 Senators.

He used an old ambulance for his campaign to represent his relationship to the health system. Pavel officially announced his candidacy on 6 September 2022 when he launched his campaign, with the slogan \"Let's bring order and peace back to the Czech Republic\". Karel Janeček launched his campaign on 7 September 2022 at the VR Play Park. He appeared in front of journalists in a VR suit to say that anybody could visit his Metaverse platform to submit their signature.

On 10 September 2022, SPD announced it would nominate Bašta for the presidency.\nOn 27 September 2022, Pavel announced he had gathered 55,000 signatures, enough to participate in the election. On 3 October 2022, Fischer confirmed his candidacy, saying that he would launch his campaign in late October 2022. On 4 October 2022, Spolu leader and Prime Minister Petr Fiala confirmed that Spolu would not nominate its own candidate, and would instead endorse three candidates whose views were considered closest to those of ODS, KDU-ČSL and TOP 09, namely Fischer, Nerudová and Pavel.\nOn 10 October 2022 Fischer announced that he had gathered 10 signatures from Senators, allowing him to run. Karel Janeček admitted on 11 October 2022 that he had failed to gather 50,000 signatures, so he was seeking nominations from senators. On 12 October 2022 it was reported that Cyril Svoboda, former leader of KDU-ČSL, had started gathering signatures in the Senate to allow him to run. Svoboda initially refused to comment, but on 13 October confirmed he would not be running as he had failed to gather enough signatures. Nerudová announced on the same day she had gathered enough signatures to submit her candidacy. On 14 October 2022 Hilšer confirmed he had gathered the signatures of 14 Senators allowing him to run. Tomáš Zima also announced on 18 October 2022 that he had collected signatures from 13 senators allowing him to run. Zima said he had collected 37,000 from citizens so far, and could have over 50,000 by November, but had decided to insure himself with senators' signatures. Pavel Fischer launched his campaign on 18 October 2022, with the slogan \"The Czech Republic in First Place\". He said his priorities were respect for tradition, democracy and human rights, society's resistance to hostile influences, economic development, and the economic independence of the Czech Republic.\nOn 30 October 2022, Babiš announced his candidacy as the nominee of his party. Pavel said that Babiš's candidacy was to be expected. He added that Babiš would breathe new life into the debates but that his candidacy was \"a threat to the Czech Republic\". Nerudová noted that Babiš had been unable to find a better candidate than himself and decided to run despite forecasts not giving him much chance.\nOfficial campaign\nOn 8 January 2023, Středula withdrew his candidacy and endorsed Nerudová.\nSeveral candidates for president support LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage and adoptions including: Danuše Nerudová, Petr Pavel, Marek Hilšer, and Josef Středula. Tomáš Zima also expressed support for same-sex marriage.\nDuring the presidential election campaign, Fischer expressed his support for the right to keep and bear arms, stating that he considered it \"correct for adult citizens to have the basic ability to handle firearms, to know how to make them safe or check that they are unloaded\". Fischer further said that as president, he would veto restrictions on the legal possession of firearms by civilians.\nBabiš's prospects in the election were said to have improved at the beginning of January 2023, after he was cleared by the Municipal Court in Prague in an alleged fraud case involving misuse of EU subsidies.\nSecond round\nAfter finishing first in the first round, Pavel was considered to be the favourite in the second round. He organised rallies in Ústí nad Labem, Ostrava, Brno and Prague, which were attended by thousands of people.\nIn a press conference after the results were announced, Babiš attacked Pavel's former past with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, likening him to Vladimir Putin, a statement ridiculed by Babiš's critics. He later attempted to portray Pavel as a warmonger; Babiš's billboard campaign saying \"I will not drag Czechia into war. I'm a diplomat, not a soldier.\" was criticised by the Czech Minister of Defence Jana Černochová and other politicians.\nBefore the second round election, Pavel became the target of several false claims online, including rumours of his death. Some commentators described these claims as the largest online disinformation campaign in Czech history. Shortly after the first round, a string of text messages claiming to be from Pavel, instructing people to \"report to the nearest branch of the Armed Forces\" for conscription in the Russo-Ukrainian war, were reported to the police for investigation. Pavel denied that he had sent them and accused Babiš's campaign of organising them. Pavel's website was attacked by hackers linked to Russia multiple times. Meanwhile, Babiš and his family were targeted by several death threats.\nBabiš's statement during a debate questioning Czech assistance to NATO allies triggered strong criticism from governments of several NATO countries, notably Poland and of the Baltic states, and prompted Pavel to pledge that if elected he would visit Poland to reassure it that the Czech Republic would provide military support for its allies if they were attacked.\nCampaign finances\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Petr Pavel, former chair of the NATO Military Committee, ran as an independent with the endorsement of the governing alliance SPOLU. He won the first round with 35.4 per cent of the vote, while former prime minister Babiš running as the candidate of ANO 2011 finished second with 35 per cent. Pavel was subsequently endorsed by four of the eliminated candidates, while Bašta and Zima did not endorse either candidates. Pavel was also endorsed by the incumbent prime minister Petr Fiala, while Babiš received endorsements from the Communist Party, the Tricolour Movement, and outgoing president Zeman.\nThe runoff was held on 27 and 28 January. Pavel defeated Babiš with 58 per cent of the vote, and became the president-elect. He assumed office on 9 March, replacing Zeman.\nOn 29 January, an electoral district in Prague-Bohnice was reported to have accidentally submitted its reported tallies for Babiš and Pavel the wrong way round, resulting in about 100 votes being erroneously counted in favour of Babiš. However, the legal period during which electoral commissions can still correct the submitted results had already expired when the error was noticed, after which only the Supreme Administrative Court can order the correction of the official results.\n| party6 = Marek Hilšer to the Senate\n| votes6 = 142912\n| cand7 = Karel Diviš\n| party7 = Independent\n| votes7 = 75475\n| cand8 = Tomáš Zima\n| party8 = Independent\n| votes8 = 30769\n| invalid = 44227\n| invalid2 = 28343\n| electorate = 8245962\n| electorate2 = 8242566\n| source = [https://www.volby.cz/pls/prez2023/pe?xjazyk=EN Czech Statistical Office]\n}}\nResults by region\nFirst round\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line-height:13px;\"\n|- style=\"height:42px;\"\n!

Former Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová called Babiš's result a \"historic result for ANO\" which the party would try to replicate in the next parliamentary election. Prime Minister Petr Fiala also sent a congratulatory message, and criticised Babiš's campaign during the election, calling it \"the most abhorrent in our new era\" and hailed \"the end of Babiš's era in our country\".
