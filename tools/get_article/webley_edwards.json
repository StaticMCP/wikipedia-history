Before and after WWII, he was a nationally syndicated radio host and, later in life, a Hawaiian state politician.\nEarly life and education\nEdwards was the starting quarterback at Oregon State University for two seasons while also serving as the first student manager of the campus-based state public radio station (KOAC (AM)). Edwards was also an active member in the campus Phi Delta Theta journalism fraternity as a student.\nCareer\nInitial radio career\nIn 1928 Edwards relocated to Honolulu, Hawaii where he became an auto salesman and played for the Scotty Schuman's Town semi-professional football team. It was during this time he developed a keen interest in Native Hawaiian musical traditions. In 1935 he became a producer for a radio show which showcased authentic island music. The show, named Hawaii Calls debuted on July 3 of that year. The show struggled financially for the first several years.\nThe war years\nEdwards was the station manager at KGMB in late 1941. Edwards was the first radio announcer to broadcast the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. It was he who said on air: \"Attention. This is no exercise. The Japanese are attacking Pearl Harbor!....All Army, Navy and Marine personnel to report to duty\". After the attack, Edwards worked as Pacific Bureau manager for CBS Radio. Among his most notable experiences was landing the first interview with Colonel Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay which dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. Edwards, of CBS, was one of only two broadcast journalists aboard the USS Missouri during the surrender ceremony at Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. He was the \"chief announcer\" for the ceremony, Merrill Mueller of NBC was the \"narrator.\" Edwards has the distinction of being the only broadcaster to witness the very beginning and end of the United States' involvement in World War II.\nRadio career after the war\nEdwards returned to radio broadcasting Hawaiian music. Hawaii Calls ran for 37 years. He wrote lyrics (with Leon Pober) to the popular song, \"Pearly Shells\" recorded by Burl Ives, Don Ho, Billy Vaughn and Hank Snow, to name a few. Edwards' popularity was evident in that he served in the Hawaiian Territorial & State Legislature from 1952-1966 and as a Hawaiian State Senator from 1966–1968. He died of a heart attack in 1977.\nPolitics\nEdwards was a member of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.spaceagepop.com/edwards.htm Space Age Pop Music Profile]\n*[http://music.yahoo.com/ar-313915---Webley-Edwards Yahoo Music Bio]\n*[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/42-OCR/1942-05-18-BC-0039.pdf  Tribute to Webley Elgin Edwards in Broadcasting Magazine, 18 May, 1942 - re: his broadcasts of 7 December, 1941]"
