The battle resulted in the Neapolitan force being routed.\nFollowing defeat at the Battle of Tolentino, the 4th Division of the Neapolitan army, commanded by General Andrea Pignatelli di Cerchiara had detached from the main army under their king, Joachim Murat, and were retreating south. The commander of the Austrian force, Frederick Bianchi, dispatched his advanced guard, consisting of Hungarian hussars and Tyrolean jägers, in pursuit.\nThe Austrians finally caught up with the Neapolitans on 13 May in the town of Castel di Sangro. Seeing the hussars, the Neapolitans formed squares. However, during the cause of the disastrous campaign, the 4th Division had been reduced to less than 2,000 men. The hussars broke the Neapolitan square and sent the remaining troops into disarray.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\nFurther reading\n*Capt.
