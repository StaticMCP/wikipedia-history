An artist's record company decides whether to propose an eligible artist to be considered by The Brits for nomination. Of the seventy eligible artists, twelve were female. Female artists were significantly represented in other categories, with Wet Leg receiving the joint highest number of nominations for the ceremony along with Harry Styles. A spokesperson for the Brits stated that 2022 saw fewer high profile women artists major releases and would monitor future nomination patterns. When Styles won the category, he dedicated the award to several of the female artists who had not been nominated.\nAdditional controversy surrounded the Brit Award for Pop/R&B Act category, with critics citing a lack of R&B representation and questioning why the two genres were grouped together in the first place.\nSeveral issues arose throughout the ceremony. During the acceptance speech for British Group, one member of the group Wet Leg shouted an expletive anti-Conservative Party message, which was subsequently censored.\nAnother incident involved comedian Daisy May Cooper, who seemingly made an inappropriate cocaine joke about the Sugababes. Despite Daisy’s microphone crackling, as she uttered the insensitive joke, it was not bleeped out of the show for people watching at home.\nAdditionally, production issues concerning the construction of the set for Sam Smith's performance resulted in a pre-recording of Adele performing her song \"I Drink Wine\" from last year's ceremony, being shown.\nSam Smith and Kim Petras' performance of \"Unholy\" received backlash's resulting in over 100 Ofcom complaints being made.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/ Brit Awards official website]"
