This was the second election to the district council following the implementation of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.\nThe election used the 12 wards created by the Formation Electoral Arrangements in 1974. Each ward elected one councillor using first-past-the-post voting.\nAs in 1974, Stewartry remained a non-partisan district. No political party contested the election and all of the 12 seats were won by independents.\nResults\n|seats %=100.0|votes %=100.0|votes=6,682|plus/minus=}}\nSource:\nReferences"
