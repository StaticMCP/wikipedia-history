Alfredo Preciado of CaliberTV scored the album 6.5 out of 10 and said: \"While this may not be the album that moves the needle very far for long-time listeners or the one that demonstrates the band pushing boundaries beyond their capabilities, it's quite possibly their most straightforward release yet. Dogma represents a great deal of honesty and determination for Crown the Empire, offering a modestly diverse selection worth celebrating.\" Ghost Cult gave the album a positive review, writing: \"Dogma outlines vulnerability, resilience, determination, desperation, trust, and reliance. There is a full circle moment that reaches back to the inception of Crown the Empire, and Tree sheds light on the true meaning behind the band's logo.\"\nKerrang! gave the album 2 out of 5 and stated: \"Despite its brighter moments, Dogma might well be washed away with the tide in the grand scheme of things, unable to stand out in the brave new world of music in 2023.\" ''Rock 'N' Load praised the album, saying \"Dogma'' is a very welcome back for Crown the Empire and I have no doubt that the streaming figures will shoot up with this release as the band look to regain their place in the upper echelons of Heavy Rock.\"\nTrack listing\nNotes\n* \"Dogma\" is stylized in all caps.\nPersonnel\nCrown the Empire\n* Andrew \"Andy Leo\" Rockhold – lead vocals, keyboards, programming\n* Brandon Hoover – guitars, backing vocals\n* Hayden Tree – bass, unclean vocals\n* Jeeves Avalos – drums, percussion\nAdditional musicians\n* Josh Strock – additional guitar, production\n* Courtney LaPlante of Spiritbox – guest vocals on track 5\n* Remington Leith of Palaye Royale – guest vocals on track 6\nAdditional personnel\n* Zach Jones – production, engineering\n* Chris Athens – engineering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Dogma\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Album Sales (Billboard)\n| 79\n|}\nReferences"
