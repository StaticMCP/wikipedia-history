After local schooling, Flint started working as a bookkeeper.  Flint and his family moved to Cleveland in 1851 where Flint started a real estate firm.  Since he was always interested in railroads, Flint served as the superintendent of the CCC&I from 1859 to 1878.  Flint became a member of the Cleveland board of schools in 1860 and was elected mayor in 1861.  Flint, a Republican because of the Civil War, later realigned his views to that of a War Democrat;  he supported the North's cause during the Civil War.  He retired after being defeated for re-election, continuing the railroad business until 1878.  Flint died in Cleveland and is buried in Lake View Cemetery.\nFlint married Caroline E. Lemen (d. 1899) of Cleveland.  They had three children:  Carolin, Fanny, and William.\nReferences\n* The Encyclopedia Of Cleveland History by Cleveland Bicentennial Commission (Cleveland, Ohio), David D.
