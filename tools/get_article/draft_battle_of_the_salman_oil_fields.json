A team of IRGC infiltrators attempted to sabotage Iraq's vital oil infrastructure at the Salman oil field, located northwest of the Rumaila oil field. The sabotage mission was intercepted by Iraqi Republican Guard forces and oil security units, resulting in a swift Iraqi victory.\nBackground\nBy 1983, Iran had increased reliance on unconventional tactics, including raids and sabotage missions targeting Iraqi petroleum production and exports. Iraq’s Salman oil field was considered a vulnerable but critical target due to its role in sustaining the Ba'athist regime’s war economy.\nIntelligence gathered by the Iraqi Oil Security Command and military counterintelligence indicated a pending infiltration attempt. In response, Colonel Fadhil Ali al-Tikriti was tasked with reinforcing the region, deploying elements of the elite 7th Republican Guard Battalion and increasing air surveillance over the southern marsh routes.\nThe Battle\nOn the night of 18–19 May 1983, a group of approximately 50 IRGC commandos crossed into southern Iraq near the Shatt al-Arab river and maneuvered through the marshes west of al-Zubair. Their goal was to plant explosives on a series of oil pumping and pressure regulation stations at the Salman complex.\nHowever, Iraqi aerial reconnaissance and infrared sensors detected their movement. Ground forces set up a perimeter and launched an ambush as the Iranian unit neared the infrastructure.\nCombat lasted approximately two hours and involved automatic weapons fire and explosive traps. Outnumbered and unable to retreat due to searchlight exposure and air patrols, most of the Iranian operatives were either killed or captured. Several explosive devices were disarmed by Iraqi engineering teams.\nAftermath\nThe engagement was a tactical success for , ensuring the uninterrupted operation of the Salman oil field and deterring future IRGC sabotage missions in the area. The operation strengthened Iraq’s confidence in defending critical infrastructure and led to the following:\nExpanded aerial surveillance across southern Iraq\nCreation of rapid-response sabotage countermeasures\nFormal militarization of key oil sites through the Oil Security Command\nIran, meanwhile, shifted its sabotage focus northward and relied more on cross-border artillery harassment in the following months.\nLegacy\nThe battle is rarely mentioned in Western military historiography but is cited in internal Iraqi documents and regional sources as a key example of defensive vigilance. It demonstrated Iraq’s increasing proficiency in countering asymmetric threats and reinforced the importance of oil in the wider war effort.\nSee Also\nIran–Iraq War\nRumaila oil field\nRepublican Guard (Iraq)\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\nBa'athist Iraq\nReferences\nAl-Tikriti, Fadhil.

The battle occurred near the Salman oil field, a vital energy site in southern Iraq, when a small Iranian infiltration unit attempted to sabotage Iraqi petroleum infrastructure. The attempt was foiled by Iraqi Republican Guard forces and specialized oil field security units.\nBackground\nBy early 1983, Iran had intensified its use of irregular warfare tactics, especially deep raids and sabotage missions, in an attempt to disrupt Iraq’s oil-based economy. The Salman oil fields, located northwest of the Rumaila oil complex, were considered a strategic but less-defended target compared to major facilities.\nIraqi intelligence had intercepted communications indicating that IRGC sabotage engineers were planning a cross-border infiltration. In response, Iraq’s Oil Security Command reinforced the region, deploying a detachment from the Republican Guard’s 7th Battalion to monitor critical infrastructure\nThe Battle\nOn the night of May 18–19, 1983, a team of around 50 IRGC operatives crossed into Iraq through the southern marshes near al-Zubair. Their objective was to plant explosives near a major pumping station and control valve network at Salman.\nUsing infrared equipment and aerial surveillance, Iraqi forces detected the infiltration early. As the Iranian team reached the periphery of the oil installation, they were ambushed by Iraqi commandos and mobile patrol units, supported by fixed searchlights and artillery flares.\nCombat lasted for less than two hours. The Iranians were outnumbered and unable to retreat due to Iraqi air patrols. At least 40 IRGC operatives were killed or captured, and several explosive charges were disarmed by Iraqi engineers.\nAftermath\nThe operation was hailed as a strategic victory for Ba'athist Iraq, not because of the scale of fighting, but due to its success in defending vital oil infrastructure. The oil fields remained intact and fully operational following the engagement.\nThis battle prompted the Iraqi regime to:\nStrengthen military patrols along oil transport routes\nDeploy anti-sabotage drones and mine detection teams\nIncrease intelligence coordination with tribal allies in the south\nIran, on the other hand, reduced direct sabotage raids in the south after the failed attempt.\nLegacy\nThe Battle of the Salman Oil Fields is not widely covered in international sources, but is referenced in Iraqi military records and Ba'athist propaganda archives as a moment of vigilance and homeland defense. It demonstrated Iraq’s growing ability to repel asymmetrical warfare tactics, even in remote areas.\nSee Also\nIran–Iraq War\nRepublican Guard (Iraq)\nSabotage in warfare\nOil in Iraq"
