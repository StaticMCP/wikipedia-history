During her career, she worked with Ben E. King, Cab Calloway, Eric Burdon, and Sly Hampton. Her reputation was boosted by a tenor sax battle with Stan Getz at the North Sea Jazz Festival in 1978. She appeared on the TV show Sesame Street and in European television shows, as well as the cult film Comeback by Eric Burdon. Many careers were launched in her band, including those of Candy Dulfer, Saskia Laroo, and Alex Britti. She died from a heart attack in Italy shortly after a televised performance with Alex Britti in December 2000.\nAlthough King was popular in Europe, she had little exposure in America except for brief periods when she lived in New York City, maintaining an apartment there for many years even while living in Amsterdam. The year before she died, she returned to Georgia to perform with a band under the name Rosa King and the Looters. Band members included J. Lyon Layden on guitar, Eric Layden on bass, Kristina Train on vocals and violin, Jeff Evans on drums, and Dan Walker on keyboards. During the same year, she performed at a jazz festival in South Africa and several dates in the Netherlands. Her last performance in Italy was a reunion with guitarist Alex Britti in a nationwide televised concert with nearly 100,000 people in attendance. Although she had suffered several heart attacks the week before, she performed in a wheelchair. Twelve hours later she died. A Rosa King Foundation was established in the Netherlands to help young female artists, and a memorial concert was conducted at the Melkweg concert house in Amsterdam.\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Album\n! scope=\"col\" | Tracks\n! scope=\"col\" | Tracks\n|-\n|\tRosa King & Upside Down\n* 1974\n* Blue Elephant – PE 877072\n* Dureco*\n* Vinyl, LP\n*Netherlands\n|\n*1\tUp Side Down\n*2\tDon't Make Me Wait In Vain\n*3\tFeet Freak\n*4\tI Got To Feel Free\n*5\tGhetto Of Peoples Minds\n*6\tDo You Wanna\n|\n*7\tUnderstanding\n*8          Fame And Fortune\n*9\tBlues For You\n*10\tChicken Legs\n*11\tFoot Steps\n*12\tTroubles\n|-\n|\tVrouwenfestival 1979 - Live at the Melkweg\n* 1979 Vrouwenfestival (women's festival)\n* with various female performers\n*Vinyl, LP\n*Milky Way Records\n*Netherlands\n*recorded live at the Melkweg, Amsterdam\n|\n* 1 So Far To Go\t6:32\n|\n*\n|-\n|\tSo Far To Go\n* So Far To Go (LP, Album)\tCaribbean Circle\tF.C. 30505\tNetherlands\t1980\n* Summertime (LP, Album)\tБалкантон\tВТА 2095\tBulgaria\t1979\n|\n*1 Change Is Gonna Come\t3:15\n*2 So Far To Go\t6:35\n*3 When Your Love Is Gone\t6:15\n*4 No Tears\t3:15\n|\n*5 Summer Time\t4:00\n*6 Do You Love Me Because\t3:30\n*7 Hello Lover\t3:10\n*8 All In The Name Of Love\t5:00\n|-\n|\tToo Busy\n* 1980/1984\n*Pop Eye Label PE 105\n* Vinyl, LP, Mini-Album\n* Netherlands\n|\n*1\tToo Busy (Loving You)\t3:40\n*2\tCan't Go Through Life\t3:55\n*3\tI Never Knew\t4:02\n|\n*4\tYou've Changed Your Mind\t5:43\n*5\tSometimes\t4:28\n|-\n|\t''Rosa King's Favourite Blues Live''\n* Live LP\n* 1981 Paradise + 1991 Riff\n*Rosa Kings Favourite Blues (LP, Album)\tParadise \tSMC 100.005 1981\n*The Rosa Kings Favorite Ballads (LP, Album)\tParadise \tSMC 100.005 1981\n*Rosa King's Favourite Blues (CD, Album, Liv)\tD&K\tCD 860037 1991\n*Netherlands\n|\n*1 Gotta Be Free\t4:30\n*2 So Many Nights And Days\t5:00\n*3 St. James Infirmary\t4:47\n*4 Please Send Me Someone To Love\t5:00\n|\n*5 Gonna Find A New Love\t4:20\n*6 Georgia On My Mind\t4:45\n*7 Going Down Slow\t12:15\n*8 Trouble In My Mind\t4:44\n|-\n|\tUnder The Cover\n*1987\n* Under The Cover (LP)\tD&K\tD&K 87011\tNetherlands\t1987\n*Under The Cover (LP)\tAVC\tAVL-2006\tSpain\t1989\n|\n*1 Baby I Didn't Know\t4:05\n*2 Hello Lover\t3:37\n*3 The Every Best\t6:19\n*4 Who's Playing A Joke On Who\t4:06\n|\n*5 You're In Love\t6:07\n*6 It Wasn't Easy\t4:49\n*7 Test Of Time\t5:15\n*8 You Love Me To Much\t5:26\n|-\n|\tJazz out of Harlem\n*LP 1986\n*EMI\n|\n*\n|\n*\n|-\n|\t\"Who's Playing A Joke On Who?\"\n* Maxi single     1988 Metropole\n*1987\n*Who's Playing A Joke On Who (12\")\tMetropol Records\tMRP-109-MX\tSpain\t1988\n*Who's Playing A Joke On Who (7\")\tD&K\t787011\tNetherlands\t1987\n*Who's Playing A Joke On Who (7\", Promo)\tMetropol Records\tMRP- 109-S\tSpain\t1988\n|\n*1 Who's Playing A Joke On Who\t4:06\n|\n*2 You Love Me To Much\t5:26\n|-\n|\tIt Just Happened Live Cafe Alto\n*1992\n*Riff – 85009-2\n*CD, Album\n*Netherlands\n|\n*1\tWhy\t7:54\n*2\tIt Just Happened\t7:05\n*3\tGonna Find Me A New Love\t10:04\n*4\tOwn Decision\t4:33\n*5\tBig Mistake\t8:11\n|\n*6\tDon't Activate My Love Decease\t8:47\n*7\tTaking Me A Chance\t5:11\n*8\tCold Cold Feeling\t10:13\n*9\tDo You Feel Like Some Times\t6:47\n*10\tLonely Me\t6:58\n|-\n|\tSalsa Carnaval Live\n*\n|\n*\n|\n*\n|-\n|\tCheating on Me\n* * CD        1992 Bloomdido Productions/\nlive recording in Le Duc des Lombards, Parijs on 23/24 June 1992\nwith guest the American guitarist Luther Allison\n|\n*1.
