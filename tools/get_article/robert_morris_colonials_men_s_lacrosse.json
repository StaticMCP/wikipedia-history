The Colonials became a varsity program in 2005.\nHistory\nRobert Morris currently competes in the Northeast Conference (NEC). The Colonials, which had been full NEC members from 1981 to 2020, returned men's lacrosse to that conference after the 2024 season, coinciding with the NEC's reinstatement of that sport after a two-season hiatus. The Colonials play home games at Joe Walton Stadium on the RMU campus in the Pittsburgh suburb of Moon Township, Pennsylvania.\nBefore rejoining NEC men's lacrosse, RMU had housed that sport in the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN). After leaving the NEC in 2020 to join the Horizon League, which does not sponsor men's lacrosse, the Colonials played as an independent for the 2021 season. Shortly before the start of that season, RMU was unveiled as a member of the newly reinstated ASUN men's lacrosse league, which started play in the 2022 season.\nIn 2018, Robert Morris was the number one seed in the NEC year-end tournament, reaching the finals where they defeated Saint Joseph’s 9-8 to reach their first NCAA tournament in lacrosse.\nRobert Morris joined the ASUN in 2022, winning the initial ASUN title and automatic NCAA bid.\nRobert Morris is 130–145 (.473) over 17 Seasons, with 7 NEC Tournaments, 2 NEC Tournament titles, 1 ASUN Tournament title, 3 NCAA Tournaments and 1 NEC Regular-Season title.\nAnnual record\nSeason Records\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!| Year || Wins || Losses || Percent || Conference || Playoffs || National Rank || SOS || RPI || Power Rating  (1)\n|-\n| 2025 || 3 || 2 ||  ||  ||  || ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| 2024 || 5 || 10 ||  || 6th || ASUN Championship || ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|-\n| 2023 || 8 || 8 ||  || 6th || ASUN Semifinals || || 41 || 53 || 52\n|-\n| 2022 || 10 || 6 ||  || 2nd ||  NCAA 1st Round (2) || || 52 || 34 || 40\n|-\n| 2021 || 7 || 6 ||  |||| || || 23 || 29 || 26\n|-\n| 2020 || 4 || 2 ||  |||| || || 66 || 61 || 49\n|-\n| 2019 || 9 || 8 ||  || 1st || NCAA 1st Round (3) || || 65 || 30 || 22\n|-\n| 2018 || 13 || 5 ||  || 1st || NCAA 1st Round (4) || 20 || 54 || 17 || 9\n|-\n| 2017 || 9 || 7 ||  || 5th ||  || || 58 || 42 || 45\n|-\n| 2016 || 7 || 8 ||  || 2nd || NEC Semifinals || || 52 || 40 || 42\n|-\n| 2015 || 3 || 11 ||  || 5th || || || 48 || 62 || 53\n|-\n| 2014 || 5 || 9 ||  || 5th || || || 64 || 33 || 31\n|-\n| 2013 || 8 || 7 ||  || 2nd || NEC Finals (5) || || 50 || 53 || 55\n|-\n| 2012 || 11 || 4 ||  || 1st || NEC Semifinals || || 46 || 46 || 50\n|-\n| 2011 || 9 || 6 ||  || 3rd || NEC Semifinals || || 14 || 55 || 58\n|-\n| 2010 || 10 || 5 ||  || 3rd || || || 53 || 55 || 58\n|-\n| 2009 || 9 || 7 ||  || 3rd || || || 53 || 55 || 58\n|-\n| 2008 || 4 || 11 ||  || 7th || || ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| 2007 || 3 || 9 ||  || 7th || || ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|}\n: (1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20200607050528/http://laxbytes.com/2020/binmenstats/rating01.php Laxpower/LaxBytes Power Ratings]\n: (2) Won ASUN tournament final 18-17 in overtime over Utah.
