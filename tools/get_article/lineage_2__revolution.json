It is part of the Lineage series.\nGameplay\nLike many MMORPGs, the player starts by creating a character and choosing its race. Available races are: Human, Elf, Dark Elf, Dwarf, Orc and in the latest update, the Kamael. Each race specializes later in different classes, such as warrior, mage, and archer. The player progresses through the game by taking quests and killing mobs. The vast majority of the game, though, is afk grinding.\nThe game is set in the same world of Lineage II, originally released in 2003, and features instanced dungeons, player versus player (PvP), clan wars, raids and a series of quests to advance the storyline. However, the gameplay has been specifically adapted to better fit mobile devices by Netmarble; for example, quests are automated, with the character executing them automatically and even killing enemies alone after selecting a quest.\nDevelopment\nDeveloped by South Korea's Netmarble, the game was first released in South Korea on November 14, 2016. It launched in western countries on November 15, 2017.
