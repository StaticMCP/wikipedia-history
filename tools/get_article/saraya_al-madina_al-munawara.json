Though they were Jihadist, they had no affiliations with Al-Qaeda. The group was allies with the Islamic Army in Iraq, 1920 Revolution Brigades, and the Islamic State of Iraq without being under any umbrella organization.\nSaraya al-Madina al-Munawara continued fighting in Iraq and expanded its operation during the start of the Syrian civil war. Though after the United States withdrawal from Iraq, the group became more underground with their operations. During the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Saraya al-Madina al-Munawara stated that they had good relations with the Islamic State though they had little to do with much of the fighting that was going on at the time.\nReferences"
