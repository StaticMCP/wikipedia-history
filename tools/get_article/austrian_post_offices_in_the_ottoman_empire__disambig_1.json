This resulted in 1748 with the establishment of a post office in Galata outside of Istanbul, and eventually extended to 65 locations throughout the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. The oldest known cancellation is a double linear \"CONSTAN-TINOPEL\" in 1787.\nThe latest remaining Austrian post offices in Turkey area were closed on 30 September 1914.\nStamp issues\nBeginning in 1863, stamps of Lombardy-Venetia were used: 2 to 15 soldi, which can be recognized only by the cancellation.\nAfter the losses of Lombardy in 1859 and Venetia in 1866, Austria issued in 1867 and 1883 specific stamps, in appearance identical to Austrian stamps of the same period, but valued in soldi (2 to 50 soldi).\nDetails on Levant Austria post-offices using the 1867 issue are given in Part III Postämter in der Levante.\nIn 1886 this was changed to paras and piasters to match the Turkish money already used by other countries,  by surcharging the existing stamps of the offices, with further issues between 1888 and 1907: values ranging from 10 paras to 20 piasters.\nThe Jubilee issue of 1908–1914 included directly values in paras and in piasters.\nGallery\nFile:Prevesa Austrian 1 02 sld 1863.jpg|2 soldi, 1863 Lombardy Venice issue, cancelled at Preveza, Rare\nFile:Prevesa Austrian 1 05 sld 1866.jpg|5 soldi, 1864 Lombardy Venice issue, cancelled at Preveza\nFile:Prevesa Austrian 1 15 sld 1865.jpg|15 soldi, 1864 Lombardy Venice issue, cancelled at Preveza\nFile:Cavalla rare blue cancellation.jpg|Rare blue CAVALLA cancellation (Kavala)\nFile:Prevesa Austrian 3 05 sld 1875.jpg|5 soldi, 1867 issue, cancelled at Preveza early in 1875\nFile:Prevesa Austrian 3 10 sld 1877.jpg|10 soldi, 1876–1883 issue, cancelled at Preveza in 1877\nImage:Stamp Austrian PO Turkish 1876 10sld.jpg|10 soldi, cancelled Costantinopoli Lloyd Istanbul in 1883\nFile:Austrian Levant 1888-1pi.png|1888, 1 piaster overprinted, possibly used at Herakleion (Candia)\nFile:Austrian Levant 1895-1pi.png|1 piaster overprinted, used at Canea in 1895\nFile:Rodi Oesterr Post 1895.jpg|2 piasters at Rhodes in 1895\nImage:Stamp Austrian PO Turkish 1906 10pa.jpg|1906, 10 paras used at Beirut\nImage:Stamp Austrian PO Turkish 1908 2pi.jpg|1908, 2 piasters\nSome of the 1867–1883 soldi issues are rather common in unused state, contrary to the kreuzer equivalent. An extreme case is the 2 soldi yellow fine beard, lately issued in 1882: the ratio in value is 5000!\nPostal stationery\nThe first items of Postal stationery to be made available to Austrian post offices in the Turkish Empire were envelopes in 1863. A total of 10 different envelopes in soldi currency were issued up to 1877, these were valid for use till 31 October 1884. Only one envelope was ever issued in French currency in 1908 (5 Centesimi for Jerusalem).\nPostal stationery postcards were first issued in 1873 in soldi currency, five different postcards were issued. Then in 1888 these were replaced by an issue in Turkish currency, a total of 13 different items were issued before these were replaced by postcards in French currency in 1903. A total of eight different postcards are known in French currency.\nOnly one 10 soldi lettercard was issued in 1886. Four different 1 Piaster lettercards were issued in 1888, 1890, 1900 and 1908.\nDuring the period of Turkish currency three different newspaper wrappers were issued in 1899, 1900 and 1908. One newspaper 5 Centimes wrapper was issued in 1908 for Jerusalem.\nSee also\n*Postage stamps and postal history of Austria\n*Austrian post offices in Crete\n*Postage stamps and postal history of Palestine\n*Stamps of the Levant on Wikimedia Commons\nReferences and sources\n;References\n;Sources\n* Stanley Gibbons Ltd: various catalogues\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153223/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/home.html Encyclopaedia of Postal History]\n* Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower.
