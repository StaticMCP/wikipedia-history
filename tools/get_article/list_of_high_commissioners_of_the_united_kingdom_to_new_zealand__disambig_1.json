As the United Kingdom and New Zealand are fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, their diplomatic relations are at governmental level, rather than between heads of state. Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.\nThe British high commissioner to New Zealand is also the non-resident governor of the Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands, a British Overseas Territory, and formerly non-resident high commissioner to the Independent State of Samoa. Besides the high commission in Wellington, the UK government maintains a consulate general in Auckland.\nList of high commissioners\nThe following persons have served as British high commissioner to New Zealand since 1939:\n*1939–1945: Sir Harry Batterbee\n*1945–1949: Sir Patrick Duff\n*1949–1953: Sir Roy Price\n*1953–1957: General Sir Geoffry Scoones\n*1957–1959: Sir George Mallaby\n*1959–1963: Sir Francis Cumming-Bruce\n*1969–1973: Sir Arthur Galsworthy\n*1973–1975: Sir David Aubrey Scott\n*1976–1980: Sir Harold Smedley\n*1980–1984: Sir Richard Stratton\n*1984–1987: Terence Daniel O'Leary\n*1987–1990: Robin Byatt\n*1990–1994: Sir David Moss\n*1994–1998: Robert Alston\n*1998–2001: Martin Williams\n*2001–2006: Richard Fell\n*2006–2010: George Fergusson\n*2010–2014: Victoria Treadell\n*2014–2017: Jonathan Sinclair\n*2018–2022: Laura Clarke\n*2022–: Iona Thomas\nSee also\n*List of high commissioners of New Zealand to the United Kingdom\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/new-zealand UK and New Zealand], gov.uk"
