It was released on 18 August 2023 through Warner Music Canada and Warner Music India. The album comprises nine tracks featuring guest appearances from Yarah and Preston Pablo.\nBackground and promotion\nThe project follows Aujla and Ikky’s collaborative extended play Four You, released on 4 February 2023. Four You featured four tracks and marked the duo’s first partnership, setting the stage for their full-length studio effort later that year.\nThe album was promoted with singles and music videos for tracks like \"Admirin’ You\" (featuring Preston Pablo) and \"Try Me\". These releases highlighted Aujla’s lyrical themes of confidence and nostalgia, and were accompanied by visuals shot across urban and rural landscapes.\nMusic\nMusically, Making Memories has been described as a collection of contemporary Punjabi-pop tracks featuring summery motifs and a fusion of traditional folk elements with modern synth and guitar arrangements. Critics praised its seamless transitions and melodic consistency across songs such as \"Girl, I Love You\" and \"What…?\".\nRelease and reception\nUpon release, Making Memories debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, number fourteen on the New Zealand Albums Chart, and number eighty on the UK Digital Albums Chart. It debuted at #3 on the Spotify Global Top Albums chart and hit #1 on the Apple Music charts in India and Canada. Each of the eight songs from the album charted in the Top 200 in both India and Canada. In its first week, Making Memories earned 7.5 million streams in Canada alone, while globally it garnered over 24 million streams.\nIt received widespread acclaim for its production quality, catchy hooks, and Aujla’s songwriting, leading to an acoustic reinterpretation of three songs from the album titled Making Memories (Unplugged), released in January 2024.\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Making Memories\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canadian Albums (Billboard)\n| 5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ)\n| 14\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nSee also\n* Karan Aujla discography\nReferences"
