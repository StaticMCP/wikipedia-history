The award was established in 2008 and is named for head coach Skip Prosser, who spent most of his coaching tenure at Xavier and Wake Forest. Prosser is the only coach in NCAA history to lead three separate teams to the NCAA Tournament in his first season with the team. Prosser died from a heart attack on July 26, 2007, at age 56.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |*\n| Awarded the Naismith College Coach of the Year the same season\n|-\n| Coach (X)\n| Denotes the number of times the coach has been awarded the Skip Prosser Award\n|}\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\"\n!
