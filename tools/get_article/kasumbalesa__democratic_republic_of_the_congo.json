It is the main conduit of trade that amounted to US$575 million that DR Congo imported from Zambia compared to US$1.7 billion that Zambia imported from its northern neighbor, based on 2015 data. An average of over 500 long-haul cargo trucks are cleared daily in each direction. In April 2019, the traffic at the border crossing snarled, leading to congestion on both sides of the border.\nSee also\n* Southern African Development Community\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://tracks4africa.co.za/listings/item/w149026/kasumbalesa-border-post-zamdrc-06h00-18h00/ Kasumbalesa Border Post (ZAM/DRC) 06h00-18h00] As of 16 May 2019."
