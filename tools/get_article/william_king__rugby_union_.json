He was the grandson of minister and noted orator, Thomas Starr King.\nAs a freshman at the University of California, King was a member of the varsity rugby team. While at the university, King played primarily at lock. On November 16, 1912, King played for the United States at flanker in its first capped match against Australia—a 12–8 loss. On November 15, 1913, King returned to the United States team, playing at number eight against New Zealand—a 51–3 defeat. By August 1914, King had withdrawn from the University of California and was consequently no longer a member of the rugby team.\nAfter attending the University of California and playing for the United States team, King became a rancher. William King died on July 1, 1937, at the age of 46.\nReferences"
