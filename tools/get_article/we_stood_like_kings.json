They have released five full-length albums through the German label Kapitän Platte. Their purely instrumental music combines elements of post-rock, neoclassical rock, progressive rock with a prominent use of the piano. Their approach consists of mixing their own music with other art forms: silent cinema and classical music.\nLive scores\nIn 2014, the band released their first album Berlin 1927, conceived as a new score for the 1927 German silent documentary Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis by Walther Ruttmann. Amongst others, the band performed the project at Dunk!festival in Zottegem, Belgium, RITCS School of Arts in Brussels, Belgium, Theater Aan Zee in Ostende, Belgium. \"The contemplative dips and climactic surges of post-rock enhance the viewing experience.\".\nA year later in 2015, the band released their second album USSR 1926, conceived as a new score for the 1926 Soviet silent documentary A Sixth Part of the World by Dziga Vertov. The album was reviewed by online magazine Echoes And Dust as being \"a masterpiece, incredible, consuming, tumultuous, visceral, and inspiring\".\nIn 2017, the band released their third album USA 1982, conceived as a new score for the 1982 American movie Koyaanisqatsi by Godfrey Reggio. This project was premiered at BOZAR, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels and included in the Best Post-Rock Albums of 2017 list on Reddit. The track Night Owl was included on the Open Language compilation by American record label A Thousand Arms : \"The track is an eerie post rock diatribe, haunting piano and faint electronics mingling with punchy drums to create one hell of an atmosphere.\"\nIn 2022, We Stood Like Kings released a new live soundtrack for the 2019 Latvian animated film Away by Gints Zilbalodis.\nClassical music\nIn 2020, the band put out their fourth album Classical Re:works with new arrangements of classical music from all eras including composers like Ludwig van Beethoven, Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy. \"Classical Re:works has become a real showpiece\", wrote the independent musical magazine Vinyl Keks.\nSide projects\n* [https://lareineseule.bandcamp.com/album/visages La Reine Seule]\nWe Stood Like Kings's pianist Judith Hoorens released the piano solo album Visages (2022) under the monniker La Reine Seule.\n* [https://chatteroyal.bandcamp.com/ Chatte Royal]\nChatte Royal is a math-rock band led by We Stood Like Kings's guitarist Diego Di Vito.
