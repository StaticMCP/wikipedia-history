Under the control of his two sons, John A. Dewar Jr. and Thomas \"Tommy\" Dewar, the brand expanded to become a global market leader by 1896 and began to win several awards, including a gold medal in the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Tommy became famous as the author of a travel journal, Ramble Round the Globe, which documented his travels while publicizing the Dewar name. Dewar's eventually expanded their product by constructing the Aberfeldy Distillery in 1896.\non document]]\nDewar's rose to prominence in the United States when Andrew Carnegie requested a small keg of Dewar's Scotch whisky be sent to the White House for President James Garfield's inauguration. Carnegie also sent the same gift to President Benjamin Harrison on his inauguration eight years later.\nIn 1987, numerous cases of still perfect Dewar's Scotch were recovered by underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence from the shipwreck of the SS Regina, which sank in Lake Huron in 1913.\nIn 1998, Diageo sold John Dewar & Sons, Ltd. to Bacardi.\nIn June 2023, the brand received a major honour at the International Whisky Competition, with the \"Master Blender of the Year\" award being given to Stephanie Macleod.\nNotable processes\nDewar's pioneered the process of \"marrying\" the whisky in oak casks to allow the blend to age as one within the casks. After the blend is created, the whisky is returned to an oak cask and aged even further to obtain a smooth, robust finish.\nDewar's products\n*Dewar's White Label – Created in 1899 by John Dewar & Son's first Master Blender, A.J.
