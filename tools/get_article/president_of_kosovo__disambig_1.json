The president is elected indirectly by the parliament through a secret ballot, requiring a two-thirds majority of deputies in office. If no candidate achieves the two-thirds majority, in the third round of voting, the candidate who receives a simple majority is elected. The vote in parliament must take place no later than one month before the end of the incumbent president's term. The president serves a five-year term, which is renewable once.\nHistory\nThe first post-war president, who served until his death in January 2006, was Ibrahim Rugova. His successor was Fatmir Sejdiu. When Sejdiu resigned from his post on 27 September 2010, Jakup Krasniqi served as acting president. On 22 February 2011, Behgjet Pacolli was elected as a president of Kosovo, which was quickly evaluated as an unconstitutional move. On 4 April 2011, Pacolli stepped down and it was decided that another candidate would be elected to serve for up to a year. A constitutional reform will be undertaken to allow for a popular vote for the president in 2013. On 7 April 2011, Atifete Jahjaga, Deputy Director of the Kosovo Police, with the rank of major general, was elected as president.\nOfficeholders\nPresident\n|-\n!colspan=\"9\"|Republic of Kosova\n|-\n| party             = Democratic League of Kosovo\n| election          = 1992\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"9\"|UN-administered Kosovo\n|-\n| party             = Democratic League of Kosovo\n| election          = 2002\n}}\n| party             = Democratic League of Kosovo\n| election          = 2006\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"9\"|Republic of Kosovo\n|-\n| party             = Democratic League of Kosovo\n| election          = 2008\n}}\n| party             = New Kosovo Alliance\n| election          = 2011\n}}\nyears\n| party             = Independent politician\n| election          = 2011\n}}\n| party             = Democratic Party of Kosovo\n| election          = 2016\n}}\n| party             = Guxo\n| election          = 2021\n}}\n|}\nActing President\nThe Acting President of Kosovo (, ) is a temporary position held by the Speaker of the Assembly of Kosovo ( or Kryeparlamentari i Kosovës}}, ) when the President is unable to perform their duties.\nThe Speaker assumes this role during periods of absence, incapacity, or vacancy in the presidency, serving as the acting head of state until the President resumes office or a new President is elected.
