The film was selected as the Dutch entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 42nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\nThe film is an adaptation of Filip De Pillecyn's short story Monsieur Hawarden (1935) and Henri Pierre Faffin's novel Monsieur Hawarden (1932), both of which were inspired by an actual nineteenth century diary.\nPlot\nMeriora Gillibrand disguises herself as a man ('Monsieur Hawarden') to avoid prosecution for murdering her lover fifteen years ago. She is the last living member of a wealthy Vienna family, and has spent the years after the murder traveling Europe with Victorine, her female servant. Her travels provide her with an anonymous cloak that allows her freedom of movement but little peace of mind. Nearing middle age, the guilt and weariness of an empty life has her contemplating suicide as the only way out of her dilemma.\nCast\n* Ellen Vogel as Monsieur Hawarden / Meriora Gillibrand\n* Hilde Uitterlinden as Victorine\n* Joan Remmelts as Rentmeester Deschamps\n* Dora van der Groen as Mw.
