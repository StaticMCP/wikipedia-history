Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid released photos of Taliban fighters in the city's central square, indicating Taliban control of Farah. Reports surfaced of the Taliban freeing hundreds of prisoners from Farah Prison. The Afghan government swiftly responded by sending reinforcements to the city. Afghan Airforce helicopters and American A-10 Warthog attack aircraft launched airstrikes on Taliban positions in Farah.\nOn 16 May, government security forces backed by U.S. air support reasserted control over Farah after driving the Taliban out of the city center. The security forces then conducted a clearing operation. Abdul Basir Salangi, governor of Farah province, said that the clashes left at least 25 members of the government security forces and five civilians dead, and at least 300 Taliban fighters were also killed.\nReferences"
