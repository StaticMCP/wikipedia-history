The sector is dominated by large coal-to-biomass conversions such as Drax (2.6 GW) and Lynemouth (420 MW), with new plants planned such as the 299 MW Tees Renewable Energy Plant.\nHistory\nIn 2003 Drax Power Station began co-firing biomass as a renewable alternative to coal.\n* 2012 – the 750 MW Tilbury B hoped to become the world’s largest biomass unit but was shut down in 2013.\n* 2013–2018 – Drax converted three of its six 660 MW units and built four 80 000-t storage domes.\n* 2021 – Coal generation fell below 2% of UK electricity; biomass overtook it for the first time.\n* September 2024 – the final coal plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar closed, leaving converted biomass as the only solid-fuel baseload option.\nCapacity and generation\nMajor biomass power stations\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Station !! Location !! Output (MW) !! Type !! Fuel source !! Notes\n|-\n|Drax||North Yorkshire||2 580||Conversion||Imported pellets (US SE; Canada)||Largest biomass plant in the world\n|-\n|Lynemouth Power Station||Northumberland||420||Conversion||Imported pellets||Full biomass since 2018\n|-\n|Snetterton||Norfolk||44||New build||Straw & chips||Supplies beet-sugar refinery\n|-\n|Wheldon Road CHP||Selby||75||CHP||Pellets||Supplies Drax rail unloading facility\n|}\nHeat sector\nHeat production in the United Kingdom is dominated by fossil fuels - particularly natural gas - which together supply over 90% of heat; the contribution from biomass is modest at about 6%.\nTransport biofuels\nUnder the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) suppliers blended 1.89 billion litres of sustainable liquid biofuel in 2024 (9.1% by energy).\nEconomics and subsidies\nBetween 2012 and 2024 Drax alone received £11 billion in Renewable Obligation and CfD support; 2024 top-up payments totalled £869 million.  Critics argue that burning imported wood is neither cost-effective nor carbon-neutral.\nSustainability debate\nA 2025 analysis by Ember found Drax emitted 13.3 Mt CO₂ in 2024 – more than the UK’s six most carbon-intensive gas plants combined.  NGOs and academics question the UK’s carbon-accounting rules that rate imported biomass as zero-emission at the point of combustion. The proposed Tees Renewable Energy Plant is being challenged in court because of alleged environmental impacts.\nPolicy and targets\nThe UK Biomass Strategy 2023 sets a hierarchy of uses favouring waste biomass and hard-to-electrify sectors and envisages up to 5 Mt CO₂ y⁻¹ of durable removals via BECCS by 2030.\nSee also\n* Renewable energy in the United Kingdom\n* Bioenergy in the European Union\n* Biofuel in the United Kingdom\n* Energy policy of the United Kingdom\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://ember-climate.org/topic/bioenergy/ Ember – Bioenergy research hub]\n* [https://reports.electricinsights.co.uk/ Electric Insights: real-time UK biomass generation]"
