Party rules stipulated that the LCC Central Committee elected the president. Moreover, the Central Committee was empowered to remove the president. The president served ex officio as a member of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) and of the SRC Presidency. To be eligible to serve, the president had to be a member of the Presidency of the LCC Central Committee. The 9th LCC Congress instituted a two-year term limits for officeholders.\nThe office traces its lineage back to the office of \"Political Secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Croatia,\" established after the founding of the LCY in 1919. This body had no distinct rights and was under the jurisdiction of the Yugoslav Central Committee. On 1 August 1937, the LCY convened the founding congress of the Communist Party of Croatia. On 2 August, the Central Committee of the 1st Congress elected Đuro Špoljarić as \"Political Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia\". The LCY 6th Congress on 2–7 November 1952, renamed the party League of Communists, and the Croatian republican branch followed suit and changed its name to League of Communists of Croatia. On 4 October 1966, the 5th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the LCY 8th Congress abolished the office of General Secretary at the national level and replaced with the office of President. The LCC Central Committee convened a meeting on 26 October 1966 that abolished the office of secretary and established the \"President of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia\". The reforms passed by the LCY Central Committee plenum strengthened the powers of the republican branches and gave more powers to the Croatian party leader. The 9th LCC Congress introduced another set of reforms on 16 May 1982, which abolished the existing office and replaced it with the \"President of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia\". This office was retained until 3 November 1990, when the party changed its name to the Party of Democratic Changes.\nOffice history\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=col | Title\n! scope=col | Established\n! scope=col | Abolished\n! scope=col | Established by\n|-\n| Political Secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia for Croatia\n| align=\"center\" | 23 April 1919\n| align=\"center\" | 2 August 1937\n| 1st Congress of the Socialist Labour Party of Yugoslavia (Communists)\n|-\n| Political Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of CroatiaSerbo-Croatian: Politički sekretar Centralnog komiteta Saveza komunista Hrvatske\n| align=\"center\" | 2 August 1937\n| align=\"center\" | 26 October 1966\n| 1st Congress of the Communist Party of Croatia\n|-\n| President of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of CroatiaSerbo-Croatian: Predsjednik komiteta Saveza komunista Hrvatske\n| align=\"center\" | 26 October 1966\n| align=\"center\" | 16 May 1982\n| 6th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the 5th Congress\n|-\n| President of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of CroatiaSerbo-Croatian: Predsjednik Predsjedništva Centralnog komiteta Saveza komunista Hrvatske\n| align=\"center\" | 16 May 1982\n| align=\"center\" | 24 February 1991\n| 9th Congress of the League of Communists of Croatia\n|}\nOfficeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:center\n|+Presidents of the League of Communists of Croatia\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col class=\"unsortable\" | Portrait\n! scope=col | Name\n! scope=col | Took office\n! scope=col | Left office\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col | Term of office\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationality\n! scope=col class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| 1\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 2 August 1937\n| January 1939\n|\n| 1st(1943–1948)\n| 1906\n| 1929\n| 1991\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 2\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| December 1939\n| 25 August 1940\n|\n| 1st(1943–1948)\n| 1911\n| 1934\n| 1942\n| Serb\n|\n|-\n| 3\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 25 August 1940\n| December 1942\n|\n| 1st(1943–1948)\n| 1914\n| 1932\n| 1972\n| Montenegrin\n|\n|-\n| 4\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| December 1942\n| 5 October 1944\n|\n| 1st(1943–1948)\n| 1899\n| 1919\n| 1949\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 5\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 5 October 1944\n| 28 March 1969\n|\n| 1st–6th(1948–1974)\n| 1912\n| 1933\n| 1983\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 6\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 28 March 1969\n| 13 December 1971\n|\n| 6th–7th(1968–1978)\n| 1923\n| 1943\n| 2009\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 7\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 14 December 1971\n| 16 May 1982\n|\n| 7th–8th(1978–1982)\n| 1924\n| 1944\n| 2010\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 8\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 16 May 1982\n| 23 May 1983\n|\n| 9th(1982–1986)\n| 1922\n| 1941\n| 2006\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 9\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 23 May 1983\n| 14 May 1984\n|\n| 9th(1982–1986)\n| 1926\n| 1944\n| 2006\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 10\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 14 May 1984\n| 18 May 1986\n|\n| 9th(1982–1986)\n| 1916\n| 1938\n| 2007\n| Croat\n|\n|-\n| 11\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 18 May 1986\n| 13 December 1989\n|\n| 10th(1986–1989)\n| 1929\n| 1944\n| 2009\n| Serb\n|\n|-\n| 12\n|\n! align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |\n| 13 December 1989\n| 3 November 1990\n|\n| 11th(1989–1990)\n| 1944\n| 1959\n| 2007\n| Croat\n|\n|}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
