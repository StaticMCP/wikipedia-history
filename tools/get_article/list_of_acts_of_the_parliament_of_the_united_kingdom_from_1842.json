For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n5 & 6 Vict.\nThe second session of the 14th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 3 February 1842 until 12 August 1842.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 5 Vict. Sess. 2.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for enabling Her Majesty's Commissioners of Woods to purchase certain Lands for Victoria Park.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |public|36|22-06-1842|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for regulating the Sale of Waste Land belonging to the Crown in the Australian Colonies.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Law of Merchants Act Amendment Act 1842|public|39|30-06-1842|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Law relating to Advances bonâ fide made to Agents intrusted with Goods.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for the more effectual Suppression of the Slave Trade.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Ecclesiastical Districts in Forest of Dean Act 1842|public|65|30-07-1842|maintained=y|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to divide the Forest of Dean in the County of Gloucester into Ecclesiastical Districts.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Limitation of Actions and Costs Act 1842|public|97|10-08-1842|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Law relating to Double Costs, Notices of Action, Limitations of Actions, and Pleas of the General Issue, under certain Acts of Parliament.}}\n|  }}\n| or the Mines Act 1842|public|99|10-08-1842|maintained=y|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to prohibit the Employment of Women and Girls in Mines and Collieries, to regulate the Employment of Boys, and to make other Provisions relating to Persons working therein.|note4= }}\n| or the Ornamental Designs Act 1842|public|100|10-08-1842|maintained=y|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to the Copyright of Designs for ornamenting Articles of Manufacture.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Passenger Act 1842|public|107|12-08-1842|maintained=y|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for regulating the Carriage of Passengers in Merchant Vessels.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelative to the Manchester Royal Infirmary, Dispensary, and Lunatic Hospital or Asylum;
