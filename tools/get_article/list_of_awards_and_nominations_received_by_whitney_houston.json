Known as \"The Voice,\" she is one of the most significant cultural icons of music and entertainment, and one of the most awarded artists of all time. With 22 wins out of 38 nominations, Houston is the second most-awarded female American Music Awards winner ever; at the 1994 American Awards, Houston won a record eight AMAs, setting an all-time record for most wins in a single night. She is the second most awarded winning entertainer at the NAACP Image Awards with 20 wins. Houston is the ninth most awarded artist at the Billboard Music Awards with 16, including 11 alone in 1993. In 2012, Houston posthumously was awarded the Billboard Millennium Award. Houston is one of the few secular artists to receive awards for gospel work, winning a Stellar Award and two Dove Awards.\nBetween 1986 and 2000, Houston received six competitive Grammy Awards out of 25 nominations. In 1994, Houston won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for her soundtrack album, The Bodyguard, from the film of the same name while winning Record of the Year for \"I Will Always Love You\". In addition, Houston is a two-time inductee to the Grammy Hall of Fame, due to her landmark recordings, Whitney Houston and \"I Will Always Love You\" winning the awards, bringing her total of Grammy wins to eight. Houston also won five World Music Awards, all of them in a single night record in 1994, including the Legend Award.

Houston received two Emmy Awards in 1986 and 1988, the former for a 1986 Grammy Awards performance, and the latter for having her song \"One Moment in Time\" being played during coverage of the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
