Its primary purpose is the solution of numerical problems in statistics, econometrics, time-series, optimization and 2D- and 3D-visualization. It was first published in 1984 for MS-DOS and is available for Linux, macOS and Windows.\nExamples\n* GAUSS has several Application Modules as well as functions in its Run-Time Library (i.e., functions that come with GAUSS without extra cost)\n** Qprog – Quadratic programming\n** SqpSolvemt – Sequential quadratic programming\n** QNewton - Quasi-Newton unconstrained optimization\n** EQsolve - Nonlinear equations solver\nGAUSS Applications\nA range of toolboxes are available for GAUSS at additional cost.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"; border=\"5\"\n|+Toolboxes\n!Toolbox !! |Description\n|-\n|[https://www.aptech.com/products/gauss-applications/algorithmic-derivatives/ Algorithmic Derivatives] || A program for generating GAUSS procedures for computing algorithmic derivatives.\n|-\n|[https://www.aptech.com/products/gauss-applications/constrained-maximum-likelihood-mt/ Constrained Maximum Likelihood MT] || Solves the general maximum likelihood problem subject to general constraints on the parameters.\n|-\n|[https://www.aptech.com/products/gauss-applications/constrained-optimization-mt/ Constrained Optimization] || Solves the nonlinear programming problem subject to general constraints on the parameters.\n|-\n|[https://www.aptech.com/products/gauss-applications/curvefit/ CurveFit] || Nonlinear curve fitting.\n|-\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20081122011154/http://www.aptech.com/ga_ds.html Descriptive Statistics] || Basic sample statistics including means, frequencies and crosstabs.
