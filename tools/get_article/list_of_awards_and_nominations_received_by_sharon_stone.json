In 1992, she won the Bravo Otto silver medal in the Best Actress category. She was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1995 for her contribution to motion pictures. It is located at 6925 Hollywood Blvd. Stone received the Hamptons International Film Festival award for Outstanding Achievement in Acting in 2009. The actress was also awarded the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards in 1995 and 2000.

The AARP Movies for Grownups Awards, which recognizes contributions to film by actors over the age of fifty, honored Stone with a Career Achievement Award in 2012. In 2021, Stone received the Golden Icon Award at the Zurich Film Festival for her acting career.\nStone has also been awarded for activities other than acting. In 1996, she was nominated for the Golden Apple Award for being easy to work with according to her co-stars. On May 20, 2005, she was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France (Commander on 16 July 2021). She received recognition at the 2006 Women Film Critics Circle Awards for her collaborations with AmfAR on their research on AIDS. On October 23, 2013, Stone received the Peace Summit Award for her work with HIV/AIDS sufferers. In 2015, Stone was guest of honor at the Pilosio Building Peace Award in Milan. She began an impromptu auction on stage in front of a crowd of CEOs from the construction industry and other dignitaries, gaining enough pledges to build 28 schools in Africa.\nThe Kyiv Museum of Wax Figures included a Sharon Stone wax figure. It is modeled after the scene in Basic Instinct in which she uncrosses her legs and exposes her genitalia during a police interrogation. Yevhen and Oleksy Sazhyn, the father and son running the museum, reported that the design process for the figure took eight months. They found sculptures based on women were more difficult to plan than those on men. For the creation of the Sharon Stone figure, they said: \"capturing her legs in just the right position was tricky business\".\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000232/awards List of awards and nominations] at the Internet Movie Database"
