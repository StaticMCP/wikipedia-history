Kingswood is situated to the south of the more ancient village of Broomfield. The village has a single village shop/post office but no public house. An annual senior citizen outing is arranged by the parish council and paid for from the village precept.\nThe woods surrounding the village has three large craters often mistakenly attributed to World War II bombs; the origin of the craters is unknown.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.broomfieldandkingswoodpc.kentparishes.gov.uk/ Broomfield and Kingswood Parish Council]\n* [http://www.kingswoodvillagehall.co.uk/ Kingswood& Broomfield Village Hall]"
