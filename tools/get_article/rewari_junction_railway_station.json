It is in the Jaipur Division of the North Western Railway zone and 7 railway lines branch out from this railway station. It will be integrated with the Rewari RRTS station of Delhi–Alwar RRTS.\nRewari Railway Heritage Museum, built in 1893 is the only surviving steam loco shed in India and houses some of India's last surviving steam locomotives including world's oldest working engine and one of national treasure (cultural artifacts) of India Fairy Queen, is known for heritage tourism and for shooting of several movies.\nHistory\nIn 1873, Rewari railway station was built on  long first commercial  metre-gauge track in India from  to Rewari by Rajputana State Railway. A  long segment of the railway line had been laid a year earlier from Delhi to Garhi Harsaru that catered to existing flourishing salt production works (from underground brine) at Farrukhnagar,  to its west.\nIn 1874, 1875 and 1881, the railway line was extended  from Rewari to Alwar-Bandikui, further  to Jaipur-Ajmer, and eventually another  to Ahmedabad in Gujarat respectively by Rajputana–Malwa Railway.\nIn 1884, Rewari became a railway junction when, a -long metre-gauge railway line to Bhatinda was completed by Rajputana–Malwa Railway\nIn 1986,   long line to Bikaner via  Kanina, Loharu, Sadulpur, Churu & Ratangarh was laid.).\nIn 1905,  long line to Phulera via Narnaul, Neem-Ka-Thana and Ringas was laid. Eventually five metre-gauge tracks branched out from Rewari. All metre-gauge trains starting from (and terminating at) Delhi railway junction (station code DLI) to Punjab, Rajputana, Saurashtra, Kutch and north Gujarat regions passed through Rewari station. The management of Rajputana–Malwa Railways (and Rewari railway station) was transferred to Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (BBCI) in 1889. BBCI became Western Railway in 1951.\nIn 1952, Delhi–Rewari–Bikaner railway line were transferred to Bikaner Division of newly formed Northern Railway zone in 1952 while Rewari–Jaipur and Rewari–Ringas–Phulera sections remained in Western Railway.\nIn 1992, Delhi–Rewari railway line had double  metre gauge and one of the tracks was converted to  broad gauge as a part of conversion of Ajmer–Delhi line.\nIn 1993, Rewari–Bhatinda track was converted to broad gauge.\nIn 1994, Rewari–Jaipur–Ajmer track was converted to broad gauge. In May 1997, broad-gauge trains started running from Ahmedabad to Delhi via Rewari. Within a few years, both the tracks from  to Delhi railway junction were converted to broad gauge and all metre-gauge trains stopped operating from Delhi Junction. As a result of this, all metre-gauge trains to Rewari and beyond terminated at and started from Sarai Rohilla which became a railway terminus.\nBy September 2004, the second metre-gauge track from Sarai Rohilla to Rewari was also converted to broad gauge and all metre-gauge trains stopped operating between Rewari and Sarai Rohilla (though the converted track was \"officially\" dedicated to the nation by politicians only in October 2006).\nBy 2009, all metre-gauge railway tracks from Rewari were converted to broad gauge.\nUntil 2010, Rewari was the world's oldest and largest commercial metre-gauge railway junction.\nIn 2008,  long Rewari–Ajmer railway line via Bandikui and Jaipur was double tracked.\nIn 2021, Rewari-Ajmer-Palanpur-Ahmedabad, Rewari-Hisar, and Rewari-Ludhiana lines were doubled.\nIn 2017, Alwar-Rewari–Hisar and Rewari–Narnaul–Ringas–Phulera railway tracks were electrified.\nIn 2020, Rewari–Ajmer railway track was electrified. Later, Rewari–Ringas–Ajmer–Palanpur  long track and Rewari–Ringas–Ajmer–Palanpur–Mehsana railway track were also electrified.\nIn 2004–06, facilities were upgraded via Rewari for running double-stack goods trains from Rewari to Bombay, Kandla and other ports in western India from Delhi and northern states/union territories of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Some private logistics operators have built container storage yards north of Rewari near Garhi Harsaru (south of Gurgaon) for this purpose.\nIn 2025-26, Rewari station underwent ₹12 crore upgrade with improved station building facade, new lifts and escalators, renovated waiting rooms and toilets, new coach guidance system, separate arrival and departure gates, enhanced parking, and an attractive boundary wall.\nFacilities\nRewari railway station has all major facilities like high-level platforms, waiting rooms, restaurants, computerised ticket reservation, bookshop and retiring rooms for sleeping. On conversion of metre-gauge tracks to broad gauge, the station yard was remodelled and the tracks and platforms were rearranged to provide 8 platforms in 2009–10; low-level metre-gauge platforms were raised higher. Some heritage buildings that were more than 100 years old were demolished to lay new railway lines and build high-level platforms. New buildings have been constructed.\nTrain services\nRewari railway junction station is located  southwest of old Delhi and  southwest of the nearest large airport is located at New Delhi.\nRail lines\nbroad-gauge tracks branch out from Rewari towards\n#Delhi  .\n#Ajmer via Alwar, Bandikui and Jaipur\n#Phulera via Narnaul, Neem-Ka-Thana and Ringas\n#Bikaner via Loharu, Sadulpur, Churu & Ratangarh\n#Bhatinda via Charkhi Dadri, Bhiwani and Hisar\n#Rohtak via Jhajjar (constructed in 2008–2012 and commissioned in January 2013)\n# Rewari-Asaoti as a part of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor\nTrains\nThe following is a list of a few trains stopping at Rewari railway station.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#cfcfcf; text-align:center;\"|  Train no. !!
