It was constructed for the Gemini program in Building 1244 and it became operational in June 1963 at a cost of $320,000[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/1244 Hangar – NasaCRgis] and later reconfigured for the Apollo program.  The simulator consists of a gantry frame, with an overhead carriage from which test craft were suspended by cables.  A gimbal was powered hydraulically and was capable of changing pitch and yaw at a rate of 1 radian per second or roll at 2 radians per second.  The gantry also moved like an overhead crane using electric motors and was capable of travelling  longitudinally at up to ,  laterally at up to  and vertically  at up to .\nIt is the only surviving simulator from the NASA Gemini and Apollo space programs that was used by astronauts to practice docking of space capsules with other vessels.  Ability to dock reliably with the Apollo Lunar Module was a crucial skill essential for the mission to return from the Moon. The docking simulator was used alongside the Projection Planetarium in training exercises.\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1985.\nCurrently it is stored, hanging from the rafters in Building 1244, a vast hangar at Langley, and there are no plans for it otherwise.\nFile:Rendezvous_Docking_Simulator_-_GPN-2000-001278.jpg|Multi exposure of Rendezvous Docking Simulator in use\nFile:LRC Rendezvous Docking Simulator controls.jpg|Simulator controls\nFile:1967 Docking Simulator.jpg|Simulating docking the lunar and command modules in lunar orbit in 1967\nSee also\n*List of National Historic Landmarks in Virginia\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Hampton, Virginia\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Hampton/RendezvousSimulator_photo.htm Rendezvous Docking Simulator, Langley, one photo at Virginia DHR]\n*[https://archive.today/20121228222629/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/aviation/ Aviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary]\n*[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/1244RDS NASA Langley Cultural Resources: Rendezvous Docking Simulator]"
