It is mainly a mid-rise residential area, predominantly consisting of tenements and multifamily residential buildings, as well as office and commercial spaces.\nThe area includes the Marshal Residential District housing estate, designed in the 1950s in the socialist realistic style. There are also numerous historic tenements, some dating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The two tallest skyscrapers, designed in the International Style, are LIM Center and Chałubińskiego 8 (170m and 150m respectively). South Downtown also includes  green spaces, such as part of Mokotów Field park complex and Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły Park. The campus and most faculty buildings of Warsaw University of Technology are located there. Cultural institutions include the National Museum in Warsaw, the Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom and the Museum of the Earth of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The neighbourhood  includes three historic Roman Catholic churches, the Church of the Holiest Saviour, St. Alexander Church, and  Saint Apostles Peter and Paul Church. South Downtown also includes the Seym and Senate Complex, which houses the lower and upper houses of the Parliament of Poland. There are also headquarters of numerous government ministries and agencies, and foreign embassies. The Politechnika station of the M1 line of the Warsaw Metro is also located in the neighbourhood.\nThe area of South Downtown began developing in the 18th century from small suburban towns, including Bielino, Bożydar-Kałęczyn, and Nowogrodzka. Between 1768 and 1770 the Stanisław Axis was developed which is a series of roads and urban squares which connect the city with the Ujazdów Castle. In 1770, fortification lines, known as the Lubomirski Ramparts, were erected surrounding the city. In 1791, the area was incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nDevelopment continued in the 19th century, especially following the opening of the Vienna Station in 1845. It led to the construction of luxury tenements, with restaurants, stores and services in the area. In 1898, the Warsaw University of Technology was founded. In 1910, in the southwest part of the neighbourhood, the Mokotów Aerodrome was opened.\nIn 1939, while the city was under German occupation during the Second World War, the section of South Downtown centred on Szucha Avenue was turned into the Police District, a restricted area housing the Security Police and the Gestapo. During the Warsaw Uprising, from 1 September 1944, the area became a battleground of German forces and Polish participants of the Home Army. Following the defeat of the uprising, the population was evicted, and a large portion of the city was razed, including South Downtown, which had already been heavily destroyed. The neighbourhood and many of its historical buildings were rebuilt after the war.\nFollowed the end of the conflict, new housing estates were built, as  well as the Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły Park. Between the 1970s and 1990s, development continued with the complex of skyscrapers, multistorey stores and apartment buildings named the West Wall. It included two skyscrapers, Chałubińskiego 8 and LIM Center, opened in 1975 and 1989. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the area of the former Mokotów Aerodrome was developed into a large urban park, the Mokotów Field. In 1995, the Politechnika station of the Warsaw Metro opened.\nHistory\nAs a suburban area (until 1791)\n, depicting the Three Crosses Square.]]\nIn the 18th century, in the area of modern South Downtown began being developed suburbian towns, located near the towns of Old Warsaw and New Warsaw. They legally functioned as the jurydyka suburban towns in the Warsaw agglomeration, established with royal decrees, and independent from Old Warsaw itself, including free from paying taxes and following its laws. They were Bożydar-Kałęczyn in the area of modern Jerusalem Avenue, established in 1702, southern portion of Bielino, in the area of Wilcza Street established in 1766, and Nowogrodzka, in the area of Nowogrodzka Street, established in 1767.\nBetween 1768 and 1770, in the area of South Downtown and Ujazdów, from the initiative of the king Stanisław August Poniatowski, was developed the Stanisław Axis, the urban layout made of five squares and roads, connecting the city with the Ujazdów Castle. The five squares were: Crossroads, Polytechnic, Saviour, Three Crosses, and Union of Lublin. The main route of the area was the Royal Road, which connected the Ujazdów Castle to the Wola Election Field where took place the royal elections. It was placed along the Piaseczno Cannal. The other main streets of the urban layout were modern Nowowiejska, Niemcewicza, Prądzyńskiego Streets, and Emancipation Avenue.\nat the Union of Lublin Square, built in 1818. Photography made in 2018.]]\nIn 1770, to the south of Warsaw agglomeration were erected the fortification lines, known as the Lubomirski Ramparts, which surrounded the city. Across the lines were set up tollhouses as the only entrances to the city, including at the Union of Lublin Square. Later, in 1818, at the location were opened the new Mokotów Tollhouses designed in Neoclassical style, which stant there to the present day.\nIn the past, through the area flowed Żurawka river, until it was channelised in the 18th century, to flow underground, underneath modern streets of Żurawia, Three Crosses Square, Czerniakowska, and Okrąąg Street. It began at the swamps near modern Starynkiewicz Square, and ended in Vistula river. Due to a large quantity of flowing water, was the most important river in southern Warsaw.\nIn 1774, in Bożydar-Kałęczyn, then owned by August Kazimierz Sułkowski, was established the neighbourhood of Nowa Jerozolima (lit. from Polish: New Jerusalem), inhabited by the Jewish population. It was located between the modern Artur Zawisza Square and the Kaliska Street. It existed in violation of the law which forbid Jewish people, from living in Old Warsaw, and in 2 mile (3.2&nbsp;km) radius from it. As such the city hall of Old Warsaw sued Sułkowski, demanding the neighbourhood be destroyed. Despite protests of the Jewish population, the neighbourhood had been destroyed on 23 January 1776, with its inhabitants displaced, their trading goods confiscated, and the houses being torn down.\nIn 1776 prince Kazimierz Poniatowski founded two garden complexes, Na Książecem and Na Górce, which would later form Na Książęcem Park and Frascati Gardens respectively. They were located to the east of the Three Crosses Square, in the area of the current Książęca Street. The Na Książęcem Park also included the Elizeum, an underground rotunda with corridors and caves.\nIn the late 18th century, in the area had a triangular shape, marked out by Koszykowa, Śniadeckich, and Noakowskiego Streets, founded the landed estate of Koszyki, owned by King Stanisław August Poniatowski. In 1778, he gave it to diplomat Pierre-Maurice Glayre, who built there a small resistance of the Koszyki Manor House. Over time there was also developed a small settlement. It changed ownership several times, and in 1872, it was partitioned and sold to construct tenements. The manor house itself was deconstructed in 1899.\nIn 1784, nearby, from the initiative of King Stanisław August Poniatowski, in the area of modern Nowowiejska Street, was founded the settlement of Nowa Wieś (lit. from Polish: New Village), to which were settled the inhabitants of the village of Ujazdów, who were displaced due to construction of the Ujazdów Castle there. It consisted of 12 houses, symmetrically placed in two rows along the Royal Road (also known as Wolska Avenue), located between modern Saviour and Polytechnic Square. The village also owned 106 hectares (1.06&nbsp;km2 or 0.4 square miles) of farmlands, which were very profitable.\nAs a part of the city, prior to the Second World War (1791–1939)\nat 68 Wspólna Street, built in\n1782. Photography made in 2021.]]\nIn 1791, in accordance with the Free Royal Cities Act, the towns of Bielino, Bożydar-Kałęczyn, and Nowogrodzka, together with other suburban towns, as well as towns of Old Warsaw, and New Warsaw, were combined into a singular entity, forming the city of Warsaw. The execution of the act was blocked by the Targowica Confederation, which delayed the incorporation to 1794.\nOn 9 August 1783 was opened the Holy Cross Cemetery, operated by the Catholic parish of the Holy Cross Church. It was located near the Koszyki Manor House, outside of city boundaries, between Marszłkowska, Nowogrodzka, Plater, and Wspólna Streets. Following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, the Prussian administration forbade the burying of deceased in the city, resulting in a large increase in the popularity of the cemetery. By 1820, it was overcrowded, and in total, there were buried over 130,000 people. It was closed for new burials on 29 July 1831, and fully closed on 17 March 1836. By 1851, the unmaintained cemetery fell into decay, and in 1859, the city authorities had decided to demolish it. The families were given the possibility to move their relatives to the Powązki Cemetery until 1 January 1860, after which the remaining bodies were removed and placed into mass graves. In the following five years, the remains of the cemetery were removed and in its place were planted trees and bushes. In 1866, the chappel at current 68 Wspólna Street, near the former cemetery was turned into the St. Barbara Chappel. Between 1883 and 1885, nearby, at the current 51 Nowogrodzka Street, was constructed a larger Catholic St. Apostles Peter and Paul Church.\nIn 1818, the farmlands outside of the urban area were bought by the city, to organize there the military exercises, with the area being later known as the Mokotów War Field. From around 1825, it became the cavalry drill site. In 1916, the area of the Mokotów War Field had been incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nat the Three Crosses Square, built in 1825. Photography made sometime between 1910 and 1926.]]\nIn 1825, was opened the St. Aleksander Church, located at the Three Crosses Square.\nIn 1827, in the area between Piękna Street and Róż Avenue, was opened the Swiss Valley Park.\nIn 1870 was opened the Warsaw Pomological Garden, an orchad and urban park, which was opened until 1944, when it was destroyed during the Second World War. It was located between Nowogrodzka, Plater, Wspólna and Chałubińskiego Streets.\nIn the first half of the 19th century, at the Mokotów War Field had been constructed a horce race track, thanks to the efforts of Ivan Paskevich, Viceroy of Poland. On 20 June 1841, there was hosted the first horse formally organised in the Kingdom of Poland. In the following years, there were sporadically held various horse races and exhibitions. They were eventually outlawed in 1861, with the ban being lifted in 1880.\nAs such, in 1887, at Polna Street, was opened the Mokotów Field Racecourse. In 1895, there was held the first annual Great Warsaw Race, which became the most prestigious horce race in Poland. The venue was closed down in 1938, and its events moved to the Służewiec Horse Racing Track, located to the south.\nin the early 20th century, including the Vienna Hotel, near the Vienna Station, sometime before 1918.]]\nThe major development in the area of South Downtown begun in the second half of the 19th century, due to the construction of the Vienna Station in 1845, which was the main Waraw railway station of the Warsaw–Vienna railway line. It was located at the crossing of Jerusalem Avenue and Marszałkowska Street. Along both streets luxury tenements were built. By 1912, the entire area, all the way to the Union of Lublin Square, was fully developed. In the area were also present many restaurants, stores, and services.\nIn 1895 was opened the Maurycy Mitte Secondary School of Mechanics and Machinery, vocational school of mechanics, located at 4 and 6 Mokotowska Street, and would eventually become known as the Hipolit Wawelberg and Stanisław Rotwand Engineering School. Since 1909, it unofficially functioned as a technological university, and was nationalised in 1919. It received the official status of a university in 1929. In 1933, it was moved to a new location at 14 Św. Andrzeja Boboli Street, where it operated until its closing in 1951. Its former building was destroyed during the Second World War.\nOn 8 June 1898, at 81 Marszałkowska Street, is opened the Warsaw University of Technology (then known as the Tsar Nicholas II Polytechnic Institute). In 1901 it was moved its Main Building at 1 Polytechnic Square, which was then opened. The same year, there were also opened a few other facility buildings. Its campus continued developing in the following decades, with new faculties opened throughout the 1920s and 1930s.\nIn late 1894, the area around Ujazdów Avenue, became a luxurious neighbourhood mostly inhabited by a wealthy Russian population. In 1894, at 12 Ujazdów Avenue and next to the Crossroads Square, was opened the Russian Orthodox Church of the Archangel Michael, which mainly served Russian soldiers and civilians living in the neighbourhood. Following the retreat of the Imperial Russian Army from Warsaw in 1915, the Russian population mostly fled the city, and the building remained mostly unoccupied and unused, and begun deteriorating. It was eventually torn down in 1923.\nIn 1881, there was opened the second horsecar line in the city, connecting the Union of Lublin Square with Muranów. In 1908, it was replaced with an electric tram line. In 1892, next to the square, between Puławska and Chocimska Streets, was opened the Warsaw narrow-gauge railway station (later renamed to Warsaw Mokotów in 1930). It was part of two lines operated by the Wilanów Railway. In 1898, there was also added line of the Grójec Commuter Railway. The station was moved in 1935 further south, to the intersection of Puławska and Odyńca Streets, where it operated until 1938.\nIn 1909, at 61 and 63 Koszykowa Street was opened a large market hall known as the Koszyki Hall.\nin the 1930s.]]\nIn 1910, at the Mokotów War Field was also established the Mokotów Aerodrome by the Awiata Warsaw Aviation Association. It was the first aerodrome in the city. Until the outbreak of the First World War, it was a popular civil and sports airfield. Following the beginning of the war in 1915, it began being used by the Imperial Russian Air Service, which stationed six fighter planes there to defend the city. In August of the same year, the aerodrome was captured and used by the German Air Combat Forces. The infrastructure was updated and expanded, and there were constructed 21 hangars, including for the Parseval airships. After the end of the war, and establishment of the independent Second Polish Republic, in 1919, the aerodrome became a base for growing military and civilian aviation industry. Since 1920, there were chartered international passenger flights, and in 1929, it became the headquarters of then-established national LOT Polish Airlines. It was also a venue for numerous air shows, parades, and international aviation tournaments. In 1934, the passenger traffic was moved to the Warsaw Chopin Airport in Okęcie.\nIn 1918, it was decided to adapt the abandoned building of the all-female high school, located at Wiejska Street, to house the Legislative Seym of the Poland. Following the renovations, on 10 February 1919, took place the first meeting of the Legislative Seym in the building. In 1922, the nearby abandoned lazaret building, was adopted to house the Senate of Poland. Between 1925 and 1935, the complex had been furtherly expanded forming the Seym and Senate Complex.\nat the Saviour Square, built in 1927. Photography made in 2019.]]\nBetween 1901 and 1927, next to the Saviour Square was constructed the Catholic Church of the Holiest Saviour.\nIn 1925, the portion of the Frascati Gardens was sold of and replaced with a neighbourhood of villas, centred on Frascati Street. In the 1930s, in was further developed with luxury tenements.\nIn 1927, on Nowogrodzka Street, were opened two railway stations. They were Warszawa Marszałkowska EKD of the Electric Commuter Railways, located at between Marszałkowska and Poznańska Streets, and Warszawa Chałubińskiego WKD of the Warsaw Commuter Railway, located between Chałubińskiego and Plater Streets. They were closed in 1957 and 1963 respectively.\nFrom 1927 to 1938, at 1 and 3 Jerusalem Avenue, was constructed new building of the National Museum in Warsaw. Some portions of the museum were opened to the public years before the end of the final construction. In 1933, in the eastern wing of the building was opened the Polish Army Museum, where it remained until 2023, when it moved to the Warsaw Citadel.\nIn 1934, at 45 Nowogrodzka Street, was opened the Telecommunication Systems Centre, which housed the Central Telecommunications Office. It was the first building in Poland to be built with the steel frame construction.\nSecond World War (1939–1945)\n, located in the building of the former Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education at 25 Szucha Avenue, in the Police District, during the Second World War, after 1940.]]\nOn 1 September 1939, Nazi Germany had invaded Poland, beginning the Second World War. During the Siege of Warsaw, the Mokotów Aerodrome in the South Downtown was used as the Polish Air Force base housing fighter planes used in the air defence. The city of Warsaw had capitulated to the invading forces on 28 September 1939, becoming part of the occupied territories of the General Government. It was captured and used by the for the anti-aircraft defence.\nBetween October 1939 and April 1940, as part of the Intelligentsia mass shootings, the members of Polish intelligentsia, including teachers, priests, physicians, and other prominent members of Polish society, had been executed by the occupants, in the gardens of Seym building. It remains unknown how many people were killed, however, historians estimate the number between a few hundred and a thousand people.\nIn the southeastern portion of the South Downtown, was established the Police District, with Ujazdów Avenue, Nowowiejska Street, Klonowa Street, and the Flory Street forming its boundaries. The main route of the district was Szucha Avenue, which was renamed to Police Street (German: Strasse der Polizei). The district was designated only for German population, with other ethnicities being banned from entering it. The Government District located in the area of the Piłsudski Square in North Downtown, which housed government buildings had same restrictions. Since April 1942, both areas have been connected via tram line no. 0, that was also designated only for German passengers.\nThe Police District was originally planned to be part of the bigger German District, which would be limited only for the German population. It was envisioned to occupy most of South Downtown and a large portion of Mokotów. The plan was never realised, as, there were not enough people interested in settling in the area.\nat the Litewska Street, near the Marszałkowska Street, circa 1943.]]\nThe area had been transformed to house offices of the occupant law enforcement structures and apartments for their employees. The most important of them was the building of the former Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education located at the 25 Szucha Avenue, which was refitted into the Commander-in-Chief of Security Police Office of the Warsaw District building, which housed the headquarters of the Security Police and Gestapo (Secret State Police). It employed around 300 people, with their offices being located at the second and third floors. At the first floor and in the basement were located holding cells and interrogation rooms, where were held people suspected to be connected to the Polish resistance movement. Prisoners were brutally tortured force the confessions, causing many of them to die. Around 100 people were interrogated there every day.\nOther notable buildings in the area were:\n* the headquarters of the commander in chief of the Order Police, located in the Supreme Audit Office Building at the 23 Szucha Avenue;\n* the headquarters of the SS and Police Leader of the Warsaw District, located in the Gawroński Villa at the 23 Ujazdów Avenue;\n* the headquarters of the Criminal Police, located at the 7 and 9 Ujazdów Avenue (currently 11 Ujazdów Avenue);\n* the Garrison Officer Casino Building located at the 29 Szucha Avenue, which operated as the casino for Polish population collaborating with the occupying forces;\n* the Re-education Labour Camp of the Security Police, located at the 14 Litewska Street, which, from Autumn 1943 to 1944, operated as a labour camp for the Polish prisoners convicted of light crimes.\nThe Police District was protected by security forces, stationed around its boundaries, including two battalions of the Order Police, stationed in the Seym and Senate Complex at the Wiejska Street.\nThroughout the war, the Polish resistance movement organized a few attacks aimed at the occupants in the Police District. On 19 May 1942, members of the Polish Socialists, disguised as customers, had planted a bomb in the casino building at 29 Szucha Avenue, which served Poles who collaborated with occupants. The explosion had killed 7 people, and wounded a few more. On 5 October 1943, in the Operation Milke, the Agat squad of the Home Army had attempted to assassinate Alfed Milke, collaborator and officer of Gestapo. The assassination did not happen, as Milke did not come to the place of the planned attack. However, a portion of the squad, placed at Szucha Avenue, were spotted by walking by Protection Squadron officer. He was immediately shot by them, after which, the entire squad had retreated without any own casualties. The killed office was Joseph Lechner, the Obersturmführer (senior storm leader) of the Security Service, and chief of office of the Security Service and Security Police of the Warsaw District. On 1 February 1944, in the Operation Kutschera, the Pegaz (previously known as Agat) squad of the Home Amy had assassinated Franz Kutschera, the SS and Police Leader of the Warsaw District, responsible for the summary executions of about 5000 people in Warsaw. It was the most important successful operation of the Home Army, aimed against high-ranking occupant officers during the war. On 6 May 1944, in the Operation Stamm, at the Szucha Avenue, the Pegaz squad had attempted to assassinate Walter Stamm, the Sturmbannführer (assault unit leader) of the Protection Squadron, and the chief of Gestapo. The operation ended with failure, with squad losing eight people, and not managing to kill the target. It was one of the largest and deadliest operations carried out by the Home Army during the war.\nOn 1 September 1944, at 5:00 PM (in the event known under codename W-Hour) the Polish resistance Home Army had begun the Operation Tempest against occupying German forces across the city, which begun the Warsaw Uprising. One of the targets of the operation was the Police District, with the key target there being the headquarters of the Security Police. It was attacked by Ruczaj Battalion and Jeleń Division, which were poorly equipped.\nDuring the first phase of fighting, partisans had managed, with huge casualties, to capture the casino building, the portion of ruins of the former building of the General Inspector of the Armed Forces (currently the building of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister), and the car workshops on Bagatela Street. They had also unsuccessfully attempted to capture the headquarters of the Security Police, which was protected b around 800 well-equipped police and Gestapo officers, commanded by Paul Otto Geibel, the Oberführer (senior leader) of the Protection Squadron, and the SS and police leader of Warsaw District. Partisans had also shot at the building from the mortar, which forced Geibel to hide in the underground shelter. After two hours of fighting, when partisans had run out of ammunition, the German forces had gone into the offensive. They had managed to cut off the portion of partisans of the Ruczaj Battalion in the casino building, commanded by lieutenant Zygmunt Manikowski (codename \"Kosma\"), from the rest of their forces, after which, Manikowski and his squad were killed. The rest of the partisans were pushed back to their starting positions. The wounded and captured partisans were executed.\nin the partisan barricade, located between 22 and 27 Jerusalem Avenue, during the Warsaw Uprising, in September 1944.]]\nOn 1 September 1944, the Bełt Battalion of the Polish resistance forces managed to occupy a portion of the Jerusalem Avenue, between Marszałkowska Street and Bracka Street. In the first days of the uprising, to fortify their position, the Bełt and Kiliński Battalions built a barricade between buildings with numbers 17 (now no. 23) and 22, between Marszałkowska Street and Krucza Street. It became an important line of communications, as the only connection of partisans between the south and north portions of the city. The barricade was under daily attacks and artillery and aerial bombardment from German forces, who tried to capture and destroy it. Despite that, the partisans managed to keep their positions there until the end of the uprising.\nFollowing the outbreak of the uprising, German officers in the city received orders to raise it to the ground and executive the entire Polish population. It was done by expelling people from their houses, and burning buildings, section by section, starting from around the headquarters of Security Police. The inhabitants were rounded up by at Szucha Avenue, where they were selected into groups. A portion, mostly women and children were expelled to the insurgent-controlled zones. Some people were also kept as forced labourers or hostages. The remaining people were set to be executed. Mass executions were first conducted at the Jordan garden at Bagatela Street, and later, in the ruins of the former building of General Inspector of the Armed Forces at 1 and 3 Ujazdów Avenue. Most of the people executed there were adult men and young boys deemed capable of fighting in the uprising, though in the first days, there were also killed women and young children. The bodies were cremated in the building. After 5 August, the number of executions done in the area has decreased. Since then, most of people killed there came from other parts of the city, including Siekierki, Sielce, Solec, and Upper Mokotów. The executions lasted until early October. While the exact numbers remain unknown, it is estimated that between five and ten thousand people were executed there.\nThe uprising lasted until 3 October 1944. Following the capitulation, the population was evicted, and a large portion of the city was razed to the ground.\nThis included South Downtown, which was already heavily destroyed during the conflict. The neighbourhood and many of its historical buildings were rebuilt after the war.\nAfter the Second World War (1945–present)\nin the Marshal Residential District in the 1950s.]]\nThe Mokotów Aerodrome remained operational until 1947.\nFrom 1950 to 1952, in the area along Marszałkowska Street, from Wilcza Street to the north, and Union of Lublin Square to the south, was built new housing estate of the Marshal Residential District. It was designed in the socialist realistic style and consisted of the multifamily residential buildings, constructed mostly in place of those destroyed during the Second World War, though it also incorporated several surviving tenements, mostly in its southern portion. It also incorporated partially surviving architecture of the Saviour Square, located in its southern section, next to which was rebuilding the historic Church of the Holiest Saviour. In its northern portion was centred on then-built Constitution Square. Between 1953 and 1957, the Marshal Residential District was expanded to the southeast, with the housing estate of Latawiec.\nIn 1952, to the south of the Marshal Residential District was built the People's Army Avenue, which would later become part of the Baths Route, an expressway build between 1971 and 1974, which connects the city centre with the east side.\nIn 1951, at 6 and 12 New World Street, was opened the Banking and Finance Centre, originally known as the Party House. It was built as the headquarters of the Polish United Workers' Party, which was the governing party of Poland until 1989. From 1991 to 2000, the building housed the Warsaw Stock Exchange, until it moved to the Stock Exchange Center at 4 Książeca Street in 2000.\nIn 1951, at 208 Independence Avenue was constructed the headquarters of the Central Statistical Office.
