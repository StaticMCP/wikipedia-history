Many articles in academic journals were written about the use of GLIM. Two GLIM conferences were held in London (1982) and Lancaster (1985) and the Statistical Modelling Society, with its annual workshops, grew out of them. GLIM was reviewed in The American Statistician in 1994, along with other software for fitting generalized linear models.\nThe GLIMPSE system was later developed to provide a knowledge based front-end for GLIM.\nGLIM is no longer actively developed or distributed.\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
