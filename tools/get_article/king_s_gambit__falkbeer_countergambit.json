After the standard capture, 3.exd5, Black may reply with 3...exf4, transposing into the King's Gambit Accepted, 3...e4, or the more modern 3...c6.\nA well-known blunder in this opening is White's reply 3.fxe5, which after 3...Qh4+, either loses  after 4.g3 Qxe4+, forking the king and rook, or severely exposes the white king to the black pieces after 4.Ke2 Qxe4+ 5.Kf2 Bc5+.\nThe opening bears the name of Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer who played it in an 1851 game against Adolf Anderssen. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings codes for the Falkbeer Countergambit are C31 and C32.\nOld Main Line: 3...e4\nIn this variation, Black's compensation for the sacrificed pawn primarily consists of his lead in , coupled with the exposure of White's king. A typical line may run: 4.d3 Nf6 5.dxe4 Nxe4 6.Nf3 Bc5, where Black aims for the weakness on f2. In Maehrisch-Ostrau 1923, a game between Rudolf Spielmann and Siegbert Tarrasch continued: 7.Qe2 Bf5 (this was condemned by the Handbuch des Schachspiels because of White's next, though Black had already gotten into difficulties in the game Réti–Breyer, Budapest 1917, where 7...f5 8.Nfd2 Bf2+ 9.Kd1 Qxd5 10.Nc3 was played) 8.g4 (in retrospect, prudent was 8.Nc3) 8...0-0 9.gxf5 Re8 and Black has a tremendous position, as he is bound to regain material and White's positional deficiencies will remain.\nThis line fell out of favor after World War II, as new resources for White were discovered, with players eventually turning to the next idea. More common now are transposition to the Modern Defense with 3...exf4 or 3...c6, the Nimzowitsch-Marshall Countergambit, but the line still sees some play.\nCommon lines other than the main line (4.d3) include the Rubinstein Variation (4.Nc3 Nf6 5.Qe2) and the Nimzowitsch Variation (4.Bb5+). The line 4.d3 Nf6 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.Bd2 e3 is known as the Morphy Gambit.\nNimzowitsch-Marshall Countergambit: 3...c6\nThis has become the most commonly played move after 3.exd5, with its most notable advocate being John Nunn. It is usually attributed to Aron Nimzowitsch, who successfully played it in Spielmann–Nimzowitsch, Munich 1906. However, Frank Marshall actually introduced the move to master play, defeating Richard Teichmann in 34 moves at Ostend 1905. Annotating that game in his 1914 book ''Marshall's Chess \"Swindles\", Marshall described his 3...c6 as \"An innovation.\"\nAlthough Black won both of those games, 3...c6 languished in obscurity for many years thereafter. White can respond with 4.Qe2, despite the drastic defeat inflicted on the young Alexander Alekhine by Paul Johner at Carlsbad 1911, although 4.Nc3 exf4 is much more common. The resulting positions are analogous to the Modern Defense of the , in which White plans to attack using a 4–2  pawn , with Black relying on piece activity and the cramping pawn on f4 to play against White's king. Theory has not reached a definitive verdict, but the resulting positions are believed to offer Black more chances than 3...e4.\nOther lines\n*3.Nf3 is the Blackburne Attack, the second most common move for White. It is considered sound.\n*3.Nc3 is the Milner-Barry Variation.\nSee also\n* List of chess openings\n* List of chess openings named after people\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thechesswebsite.com/falkbeer-counter-gambit/ Falkbeer Countergambit video and analysis]\n*[https://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter75.html#CN_6792 History of the Nimzovich variation and list of old magazine references to the Falkbeer]\npl:Kontrgambit#Kontrgambit Falkbeera"
