The initial order for 40 was later increased to 50. However, a miscommunication resulted in the builder's plates incorrectly being stamped as 202 to 211 which had been used by other A Goninan & Co locomotives, rather than the correct 323 to 332.\nThey now operate trains as far south as Brisbane. They are the only double ended diesel electric locomotives to have been built for Queensland Rail.\nIn February 2006, one locomotive was fitted with standard gauge bogies for use by QR National in New South Wales and Victoria, but the NSW Environment Protection Authority refused permission for it to be used in that state due to excessive noise emissions. In August 2009, it was converted back to narrow gauge for use in Western Australia. In 2013, three were reclassified as the 3200 class for use in NSW, following the installation of standard gauge bogies and a modified exhaust system that reduced low frequency noise emissions.\nIn 2015, 2814 derailed on the Mount Isa Line at Julia Creek, spilling sulphuric acid. 2814 flipped on its side and was deemed too damaged to repair, and as such was scrapped in 2017.\nIn the early hours of Wednesday 23 February 2022, 2811 along with 2338 derailed hauling a container train near Traveston after severe rain washed out the tracks. Both locomotives were turned onto their sides. 2811 is currently at UGL Rail's facility in Stuart, Queensland.\nStatus Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Number\n!Owner\n!Livery\n!In service\n!Status\n!Current Number\n!Withdrawn\n!Scrapped\n!Notes\n|-\n|2801\n| rowspan=\"50\" |Aurizon\n|Canary/bulk\n|September 1995\n|In service\n| rowspan=\"8\" |original number\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2802\n|Canary/bulk\n|October 1995\n|In service\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2803\n|Canary/bulk\n|October 1995\n|In service\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2804\n|Canary/bulk\n|November 1995\n|In service\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2805\n|Canary/bulk\n|October 1995\n|In service\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2806\n|Canary/bulk\n|November 1995\n|In service\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2807\n|Canary/bulk\n|December 1995\n|In service\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2808\n|Canary/bulk\n|December 1995\n|In service\n|\n|\n|Damaged in Oonoomurra derailment 17/08/2022, repaired at Stuart\n|-\n|2809\n|Canary/Bulk\n|December 1995\n|Renumbered\n|3209\n|\n|\n|In service on SG in NSW, renumbered to 3209\n|-\n|2810\n|Canary/bulk\n|January 1996\n|In service\n| rowspan=\"5\" |original number\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2811\n|Pineapple\n|January 1996\n|Stored\n|\n|\n|Damaged in Traveston derailment 23/2/2022.
