It was released on June 17, 2020, as the album's second single.\nBackground\nAlbum lead track, \"My Own Soul's Warning\" was written near the end of the Imploding the Mirage sessions, when frontman Brandon Flowers was worried that the album didn't have a single and he started to panic. It was the final song written for the album.\nThe band struggled to get the right mix for the song, going through nearly 90 mixes of it, with Flowers describing it as a “stubborn son of a bitch.”\nWriting about the song for Apple Music, Flowers said that the song was about \"repentance\", which he acknowledged is \"not a typical subject in a pop or rock song\". He said he wanted to \"write something that was meaningful to myself and that felt like it was going to transcend and resonate with a lot of people in a stadium or inside their headphones.\"\nIt is Flowers' favourite song on the Imploding the Mirage album.\nThe band leaked the intro to the song during a live stream on Instagram in April 2020, two months before it was released.\nThe cover artwork is by African-American artist Thomas Blackshear.\nMusic videos\nTwo music videos have been made for the song.\nFirst video\nThe first music video, released via YouTube on July 16, 2020, is a sneak peek from a forthcoming short film with director Sing Lee tied to the Killers' then-upcoming album Imploding the Mirage. The film will premiere on Apple Music. The music video has snippets reminding of an Americana theme. There are a number of stories going on.\nSecond video\nThe second music video, directed by Michael Hili, premiered on YouTube on August 20, 2020, just over a month after the first video. It features frontman Brandon Flowers and drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr. going on a road trip together in a pickup truck through cornfields and snow-covered forests.\nAwards and accolades\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Year\n!align=\"left\"|Ceremony\n!align=\"left\"|Award\n!align=\"left\"|Result\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2021\n|align=\"left\"|MTV Video Music Award\n|align=\"left\"|Best Rock\n|\n|}\nUproxx listed it as No. 5 on its Best Songs of 2020.
