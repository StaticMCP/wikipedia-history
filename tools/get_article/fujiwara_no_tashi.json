She was first the consort of Emperor Konoe, and then of Emperor Nijō. Because she became consort twice, she was called the \"Empress of Two Generations\". Her birth father was Tokudaiji Kin'yoshi. Her adoptive father was Fujiwara no Yorinaga.\nBiography\nIn 1155, Emperor Konoe died, and Fujiwara no Tashi lived in quiet retirement.  A few years later, when Emperor Nijo ascended the throne, he demanded that Fujiwara no Tashi – now around 22 years old, and renowned for her beauty – be appointed his empress consort. This caused debate and scandal amongst the council and court, as there had never in Japanese history been a woman who was consort to two emperors. Nonetheless, Emperor Nijo insisted, and Fujiwara no Tashi became his empress consort; some chronicles state that she was reluctant to do so.\nShe had several other names in her lifetime, these being Fujiwara no Ōiko, Fujiwara no Masuko and Fujiwara no Tadako.\nFujiwara no Yorinaga married Tokudaiji Kin'yoshi's eldest sister, Sachiko (Tashi's aunt), and raised Tashi as his daughter from a young age.\nShe was married to Emperor Konoe in 1150. After the Emperor's death in 1155, Tashi left the palace to live in seclusion.\nIn 1160, at the age of 21, she was called back to the palace by Emperor Nijō and became his empress. She is the only Japanese empress to have become one twice, and became the last known  of Japan.\nWhen Emperor Nijō died in 1165, Tashi renounced the world to become a Buddhist priest. She became well known for her writing, art, and musical abilities. She died at the age of 62.\nNotes"
