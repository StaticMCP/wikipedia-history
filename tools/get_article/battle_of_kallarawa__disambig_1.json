The rebels claimed however that a 45-minute battle had destroyed the craft although another Dvora sent to investigate failed to find evidence of such.  The next day a rebel patrol was sighted and the Sri Lankan Navy sent a force to intercept it.\nBattle\nThe government craft sighted the rebel craft near the coast at around 1 am local time. Over a dozen rebel craft where engaged and at least one was damaged before the rebel force withdrew. The engagement lasted for three hours. The Sri Lanka Navy claimed that they did not suffer any casualties but did disable a rebel boat. It further claimed that the Sea Tigers withdrew from the sea.\nSources\n* http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080330/Columns/sitreport.html\n* http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7312791.stm\n* http://www.colombopage.com/archive_08/March25135935JR.html"
