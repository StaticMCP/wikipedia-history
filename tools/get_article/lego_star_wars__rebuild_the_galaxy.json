While Dev wants to travel the galaxy with his friend Yesi Scala, Sig is content with a quiet life and hides his Force powers. Following an ion storm, the two brothers discover an ancient Jedi Temple. Dev dares Sig into using his Force powers by removing the \"Cornerstone\" despite the objections of a cloaked figure. Removing the Cornerstone causes the \"building blocks\" of the galaxy to get mixed up, with characters, locations, species and institutions becoming alternate versions of themselves. In the newly reconstituted galaxy, Sig reunites with Yesi, who has no memory of the Greebling brothers and has joined the Rebellion. The two are captured by Dev, who has become the Sith Lord \"Darth Devastator.\" They are followed by a mysterious cloaked man, who reassures Servo he will rescue Sig and Yesi.\n|LineColor       = #694E2A\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Darth Devastator and his apprentice Darth Rey torture Sig and Yesi.

Since the Cornerstone has bonded to Sig, Jedi Bob trains him to be a Force Builder, a Jedi who is able to use the Force to build objects. Sig uses his powers to give Servo the ability to speak. After escaping Ewok bounty hunters and C-3PO, the four travel to a water-covered Tatooine where they seek out Luke Skywalker at the Mos Eisley cantina.
