Part of TransLink's RapidBus network, it travels along King George Boulevard and 104 Avenue in Surrey and connects Guildford, Whalley / City Centre, and Newton. The service replaced the 96 B-Line on January 6, 2020. It is operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company and funded by TransLink.\nAll articulated buses used on this route are hybrid and air-conditioned. Although articulated buses are mainly assigned, standard buses may be assigned instead.\nHistory\nOrigins of what became the 96 B-Line can be traced back to 2008–2009, when the route was known as the 399 in planning stages. Originally planned for a 2010 implementation using resources from the 98 B-Line, which was slated to be discontinued, implementation of a south of the Fraser River B-Line did not happen until four years later due to a funding shortfall.\nThe line began service on September 2, 2013. Continuous queue jumping lanes were subsequently added at major intersections along King George Boulevard and the City of Surrey proposed expanding bus-only lanes along King George Blvd to improve travel times.\n, passengers with a Compass Card or proof of payment are allowed to board from any of the three doors on the bus. Passengers who are paying cash must board through the front door.\nOn January 6, 2020, the 96 B-Line service was replaced by new R1 King George Blvd RapidBus, which featured upgraded passenger amenities such as improved bus shelters and a new passenger information system.\nThe R1 King George Blvd RapidBus was the seventh busiest bus route in TransLink's network in 2024, with 5,163,000 total boardings.\nRoute description\nDeparting from Guildford Exchange, the R1 travels west along 104 Avenue towards Surrey Central station and King George station (both on the SkyTrain Expo Line).
