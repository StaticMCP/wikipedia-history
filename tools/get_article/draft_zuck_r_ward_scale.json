Others suggest it has been “weaponized” by middle managers to retroactively justify missed deadlines.\n----\nSee Also\n* Sisyphus Productivity Index\n* Dunning–Kruger Satisfaction Gap\n* Corporate Maslow Plateau\nPS\nThis is a completely made-up page to refer a made-up diagram for an aiSim conference presentation.
