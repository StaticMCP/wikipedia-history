The jihadist column on motorcycles was first spotted by a drone. While the combatants on motorcycles regrouped and hid under trees, an airstrike was carried out by two French Mirage 2000D fighters. Several dozen Special Forces soldiers from Operation Sabre then intervened on the ground with the support of drone and helicopter strikes. The fighting continued until the early hours of the morning.\nAftermath\nOn November 2, the French Minister of the Armed Forces, Florence Parly, announced that more than 50 jihadists had been neutralized in the operation. About fifty weapons were also seized and about thirty motorcycles destroyed. General Lecointre, Chief of Staff of the armed forces, for his part gave the same day an assessment of about sixty neutralized jihadists. The spokesman for the staff, Frédéric Barbry, also mentions the capture of four combatants.\nReferences"
