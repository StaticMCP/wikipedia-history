The Schwarzeck can be explored via the E6 European long distance path from the Kleiner Arber to the Kaitersberg mountains. Other access routes lead from Arnbruck, Schareben or Lohberg to the summit.\nIn 1970 a cross was erected at the summit, which was renewed in 2006. Since the Cyclone Kyrill destroyed countless trees on the mountain in 2007, it is possible to view the entire Lamer corner (German: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamer_Winkel]), into the Zeller Valley and all the way to the Osser mountain.\nReferences"
