In the trail, a trenchline was dug and 1,200 Paraguayan soldiers were positioned in it under colonel Pedro Hermosa; earlier, these troops had killed some Brazilian soldiers in the region and strung up their bodies from trees. The Brazilian 1st Infantry Division under general Carlos Resin Filho attacked and secured the trail, inflicting 790 casualties on the Paraguayan force, capturing 12 guns and a standard. After the battle, Vitorino ordered Hermosa and other of the leading Paraguayan officers be slain, angered over the Brazilian troops killed before the battle.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
