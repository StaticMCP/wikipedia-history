It was originally a 17th-century Latin hymn, \"Finita iam sunt proelia\"; the popular English-language version is an 1861 translation by the English hymnwriter Francis Pott.\nText\nThe text of the hymn extols the triumphant Christ whose victory over death and Hell is described as a battle, as related in the Harrowing of Hell. The hymn also makes reference to Christ breaking the chains of hell and to Christ in Majesty. Each verse concludes with an Alleluya!'' refrain.\nThe strife is o'er, the battle done;\nNow is the Victor's triumph won;\nO let the song of praise be sung.\nAlleluya!\nDeath's mightiest powers have done their worst,\nAnd Jesus hath his foes dispersed;\nLet shouts of praise and joy outburst.\nAlleluya!\nOn the third morn he rose again\nGlorious in majesty to reign;\nO let us swell the joyful strain.\nAlleluya!\nHe brake the age-bound chains of hell;\nThe bars from heaven's high portals fell;\nLet hymns of praise his triumph tell.\nAlleluya!\nLord, by the stripes which wounded thee\nFrom death's dread sting thy servants free,\nThat we may live, and sing to thee.\nAlleluya!\nTune\n\"The strife is o'er\" has a metre of 8.8.8 with Alleluya, and is it commonly sung to one of two hymn tunes. The most common is the tune , adapted from a 1591 setting of the Gloria Patri  by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina from a Magnificat tertii toni. The additional Alleluya refrain was set to music by William Henry Monk.\n>\n}\n\\new Lyrics \\lyricmode {\nThe2 strife is o'er,1 the2 ba1 -- ttle2 done;1.\nNow2 is the Vi1 -- ctor's2 tri1 -- umph2 won;1.\nO2 let the song1 of2 praise1 be2 sung.1.\n\"\"2 Al2 -- le -- lu1. -- ya!\n}\n\\new Staff { \\clef bass \\key d \\major \\set Staff.midiInstrument = \"church organ\"\n\\relative c'\n>\n}\n>> >>\n\\layout { indent = #0 }\n\\midi { \\tempo 2 = 116 }\nAn alternative popular tune for this hymn is  (transcribed in a typical setting below), named after its composer Melchior Vulpius, who originally wrote it for the hymn \"Gelobt sei Gott im höchsten Thron\" in his 1609 Gesangbuch. \"The strife is o'er\" first appeared with this setting with threefold Alleluyas, arranged by Henry George Ley, in the 1925 hymnal Songs of Praise.\n>\n}\n\\new Lyrics \\lyricmode {\nThe4 strife is o'er,2 the4 ba2 -- ttle4 done;2.\nNow4 is the Vi2 -- ctor's4 tri -- umph2 won;2.\nO4 let the song2 of4 praise be2 sung.2.\nAl2 -- le4 -- lu2 -- ya!4\nAl2 -- le4 -- lu2 -- ya!4\nAl4 -- le -- lu -- ya!2.\n}\n\\new Staff { \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\set Staff.midiInstrument = \"church organ\"\n\\relative c'\n>\n}\n>> >>\n\\layout { indent = #0 }\n\\midi { \\tempo 4 = 100 }\nReferences\nSee also\n*Anglican church music"
