It was established in 1999 by Laureus Sport for Good Foundation founding patrons Daimler and Richemont. It is supported by its global partners Mercedes-Benz, IWC Schaffhausen and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The name \"Laureus\" is derived from the Greek word for laurel, considered a traditional symbol of victory in athletics.\nThe first ceremony was held on 25 May 2000 in Monte Carlo, at which South African president Nelson Mandela gave the keynote speech.  , awards are made annually in eight categories, with a number of discretionary categories irregularly recognised.  The recipient of each award is presented with a Laureus statuette, created by Cartier, at an annual ceremony held in various locations around the world. , the ceremonies have been held in eleven cities, and are broadcast in at least 160 countries.\nSwiss tennis player Roger Federer holds the record for the most awards with six, five for Sportsman of the Year and one for Comeback of the Year. American tennis player Serena Williams and American artistic gymnast Simone Biles holds the record for most awards held by a female with five, four for Sportswoman of the Year and one for Comeback of the Year. Novak Djokovic won the 2024 Sports Man of the year award and grabbed his 5th title, making him the most decorated sportsman in the History of the Award along with Roger Federer. A number of awards have been rescinded, namely those presented to American cyclist Lance Armstrong, American sprinter Marion Jones and Canadian amputee sprinter Earle Connor, each of whom were subsequently found to have illegally used drugs to achieve their records. In the 2020 ceremony, Argentine footballer Lionel Messi became the first footballer to win the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award. He is also the first and only athlete to win it coming from a team sport. Moreover, in 2023, Messi once again won it and became the only sportsperson as well as footballer to ever win the award twice from a team sport.\nHistory\n}}\nThe organisation, established in 1998 to do charity by a partnership of Richemont and Daimler became known as \"Laureus\", its name being derived from the Greek word for laurel, considered a traditional symbol of victory in athletics.  The first Laureus World Sports Awards ceremony was held two years later, at which the patron and president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, delivered a speech which Edwin Moses has described as \"iconic\".\nAwards were made in seven regular categories and two discretionary categories at the inaugural ceremony, hosted by the American actors Jeff Bridges and Dylan McDermott.  Two of those awards would later be rescinded: both the American cyclist Lance Armstrong and the American track athlete Marion Jones were found to have used performance-enhancing drugs and had their awards withdrawn.  The award for American amputee sprinter Earle Connor, who won the 2004 Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability Award, was also later rescinded.\nThe awards are frequently referred to as the sporting equivalent of an \"Oscar\" for movies.\nCategories\nThe Laureus Nominations Panel, composed of more than 1,000 members of sports media from more than 70 countries, vote to create a shortlist of nominations in six categories:\n* Laureus World Sportsman of the Year\n* Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year\n* Laureus World Team of the Year\n* Laureus World Comeback of the Year\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year\n* Laureus Action Sportsperson of the Year\nThe nominees of the Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability are chosen by the International Paralympic Committee.\nThe Laureus World Sports Academy is an association of 68 retired sportspeople who volunteer to support the work of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation. They also vote each year to decide the winners of the Laureus World Sports Awards.  , the chairman of the Academy is Sean Fitzpatrick, former rugby player from New Zealand.  The members of the Academy vote by secret ballot to select the winners.\nThe public votes to select the winner for one category, the Laureus Best Sporting Moment of the Year.\nThe Academy also makes discretionary awards, including:\n*Lifetime Achievement Award\n*Sport for Good Award\n*Spirit of Sport Award\n*Exceptional Achievement Award\n*Sporting Inspiration Award\nCeremony\nThe Laureus World Sports Awards ceremony is held annually at various venues in various locations around the world.  The inaugural ceremony took place at the Sporting Club in Monaco on 25 May 2000.  , the ceremonies have been held in eleven cities around the world, and are broadcast in at least 160 countries.  Each Laureus World Sports Award winner receives a Cartier Laureus statuette which features a \"representation of the striving human form\".  The award weighs approximately  (with  of solid silver and a  gold-finish base) and is  tall.\nin Monaco on three occasions.]]\n, China.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Locations of Laureus World Sports Awards ceremonies\n|-\n! scope=col| Year\n! scope=col| Location\n! scope=col| Venue\n! scope=col| Notes\n! scope=col| Ref(s)\n|-\n! scope=row | 2000\n| rowspan=4| Monaco\n| Sporting Club\n| Patron was Nelson Mandela\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2001\n| rowspan=3|Grimaldi Forum\n| Patron was Prince Albert\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2002\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2003\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2004\n|  Lisbon, Portugal\n| Cultural Centre of Belém\n| Patron was José Manuel Barroso\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2005\n|  Estoril, Portugal\n| Casino Estoril\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2006\n| rowspan=2| Barcelona, Spain\n| Parc del Fòrum\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2007\n| Palau Sant Jordi\n| Patron was Juan Carlos I of Spain\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2008\n|  Saint Petersburg, Russia\n| Mariinsky Theatre\n| Attended by President Vladimir Putin\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2009\n| align=center colspan=3|Ceremony cancelled due to world economic crisis; awards presented to winners individually at other events from May to June.\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2010\n| rowspan=2| Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\n| rowspan=2|Emirates Palace\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2011\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2012\n|  London, United Kingdom\n| Central Hall Westminster\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2013\n|  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n| Theatro Municipal\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2014\n|  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n| Istana Budaya\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2015\n|  Shanghai, China\n| Shanghai Grand Theatre\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2016\n|  Berlin, Germany\n| Palais am Funkturm\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2017\n| rowspan=3|  Monaco\n| rowspan=3| Sporting Club\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2018\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2019\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2020\n|  Berlin, Germany\n| Verti Halle\n| Twentieth anniversary of awards\n|\n|-\n! scope=row | 2021\n|  Seville, Spain\n| Online\n| Virtual ceremony\n|\n|-\n!scope=row |2022\n|  Seville, Spain\n| Online\n| Virtual ceremony\n|\n|-\n!scope=row |2023\n| Paris, France\n|Pavillon Vendome\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024\n| rowspan=2| Madrid, Spain\n| rowspan=2|Palacio de Cibeles\n|\n|\n|-\n|2025\n| Twenty-fifth anniversary of awards\n|\n|}\nWinners by category\n}}\nhas won the Sportsperson with a Disability of the Year Award three times.]]\nRegular awards\nSportsman and Sportswoman of the Year\nTeam of the Year\nBreakthrough of the Year\nPrior to 2007, this award was called Newcomer of the Year.\nComeback of the Year\nSportsperson with a Disability of the Year\nAction Sportsperson of the Year\nPrior to 2007, this award was called Alternative Sportsperson of the Year.\nBest Sporting Moment\nThe Best Sporting Moment Award, inaugurated in 2017, and voted for by the public, was won by the FC Barcelona under-12 (Infantil-B)  side for their sportsmanship in consoling a defeated opposition team.
