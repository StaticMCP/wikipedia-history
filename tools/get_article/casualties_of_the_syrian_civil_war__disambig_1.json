In late September 2021, the United Nations stated it had documented the deaths of at least 350,209 \"identified individuals\" in the conflict between March 2011 and March 2021, but cautioned the figure was \"certainly an under-count\" that specified only a \"minimum verifiable number\".\nThe most violent year of the conflict was 2014, when around 110,000 people were killed. In April 2016, UN envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura stated that more than 400,000 people were killed in the Syrian civil war. By mid-March 2025, opposition activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported the number of children killed in the conflict had risen to 26,282, and that 16,181 women had also been killed.\nOn 28 June 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) stated that at least 306,887 civilians had been killed in Syria during the conflict between March 2011 and March 2021, representing about 1.5% of its pre-war population. This figure did not include indirect and non-civilian deaths. UN's commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic estimated that between 2011 and May 2021, more than 580,000 people were killed; with 13 million Syrians being displaced and 6.7 million refugees forced to flee Syria. Ba'athist government forces reportedly arrested and tortured numerous repatriated refugees, subjecting them to forced disappearances and extrajudicial executions.\nAs of February 2015, the UNHCR has designated the conflict as the \"world's worst humanitarian crisis\", while the head of the UNHRC's commission for Syria stated that the Ba'athist government was responsible for the majority of civilian casualties up to that point. The Syrian Network for Human Rights estimated that between 2011 and 2024, the Ba'athist government and its foreign allies were responsible for approximately 91% of the total civilian casualties.\nOverall deaths\nAll of the following totals include civilians, rebels and government forces:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The number includes 35,859 rebel combatants but does not include members of the government security forces or pro-government foreign combatants who have died. Early in the conflict, the Syrian Martyrs number of civilian deaths was significantly higher than the ones presented by other organisations, including the UN; among the reasons are that they recorded deaths even when no name is given for the reportedly killed individual and that they collated reports of deaths from more sources.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

By April 2015, reportedly a third of the country's 250,000 Alawites that were of fighting age had been killed. In April 2017, a pro-opposition source claimed 150,000 young Alawites had died.\nCivilian deaths\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights has stated it had documented 231,108 civilian deaths and 14 million displaced between March 2011 and August 2024.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!

Several Middle East analysts, including Sharmine Narwani from the Lebanese Al Akhbar newspaper and the UAE/Saudi Al Arabiya website, also urged caution.\nThis was later confirmed when in late May 2012, Rami Abdulrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is one of the pro-opposition monitor groups counting the number of those killed in the uprising, stated that civilians who had taken up arms during the earliest days of the conflict were being counted under the category of \"civilians\" as they were not army nor army defectors.\nCombatant deaths\nGovernment forces\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other sources put the overall number of killed Iranian-lead forces, which also includes the Afghan and Pakistani militias, at between 2,500 and 3,500 by the end of August 2017. Also, 1,878 Palestinian militiamen have been killed, according to the PFLP–GC, and these include: 1,100 Liwa Al-Quds fighters, 420 PFLP–GC members, 285 members of the PLA, 42 who belonged to Fatah al-Intifada, 11 PPSF members, 10 Al Saeka Brigade fighters and 10 Free Palestine Movement members.

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 273 Russian mercenaries were killed in the conflict.\nIn addition, 1,000 civilian government officials were also killed by November 2012.\nAnti-government forces\nDue to the main opposition monitor SOHR's policy early in the conflict of counting rebel fighters that were not defectors as civilians, a comprehensive number of rebels killed in the conflict, thus far, has not been ascertained. In late November 2012, SOHR estimated that at least 10,000 rebels had been killed, but noted the possibility of the figure being higher because the rebels, like the government, were lying about how many of their forces had died to make it look like they were winning. In March 2013, SOHR stated that the actual number of killed rebels and government forces could be double the number they were already able to document.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
