Endorsements are part of the \"invisible primary\" process, which occurs not only long before the general election, but also largely occurs before even the caucuses and primaries have begun.\nEarly endorsements were correlated with the success candidates achieved in caucuses and primaries, for elections from 1980 through 2004.\n(See the UCLA School of Political Parties.)\nHistorically, there has been a correlation (\"76% of the eventual vote percentage\") between the percentage of political endorsements from sitting and former elected officials earned by a Republican candidate in the first half of the year prior to a presidential election (for the purposes of this article, January–June, 2015), with the percentage of votes cast for that candidate in Republican primaries during the first half of the election year (i.e., January–June, 2016).\nThe value of political endorsements varies, depending on whom they are from, when they are given, and other factors. Endorsements from politicians who live in states with early primaries are highly sought after. So are endorsements from governors, federal senators, and federal representatives. Endorsements from people from the candidate's home state are less valuable, unless multiple candidates from that state are running.\nThe impact of celebrity endorsements of political candidates is less clear, but can increase general election turnout,\nor increase fundraising totals and media exposure.\nDonald Trump (won presidency)\nBackground: Donald Trump (born in New York in 1946 and raised there) is a real estate CEO (1971–present), with investments in New York, Florida, and several other states and countries.

The editorial department of the Deerfield Beach, Florida-based Sun-Sentinel on March 4, 2016, announced that it would endorse no GOP candidates because, it said, \"The kind of person who should be running is not in the race\".\nSee also\n*Endorsements in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries\nReferences"
