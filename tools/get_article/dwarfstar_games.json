      "text": "# Dwarfstar Games\n\nDwarfstar Games was a division of Heritage Models that published microgame-sized fantasy and science fiction board wargames in the early 1980s. They typically came with 12\"x14\" fold-out cardstock mapboards and 154 thin die-cut counters. The demise of its parent company also meant the end for Dwarfstar.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Game\n!Designer\n!Date\n|-\n|Barbarian Prince\n|Arnold Hendrick\n|1981\n|-\n|Demonlord\n|Arnold Hendrick\n|1981\n|-\n|Outpost Gamma\n|Howard Barasch\n|1981\n|-\n|Star Viking\n|Arnold Hendrick\n|1981\n|-\n|Dragon Rage\n|Lewis Pulsipher\n|1982\n|-\n|Goblin\n|Howard Barasch\n|1982\n|-\n|Grav Armor\n|Arnold Hendrick\n|1982\n|-\n|Star Smuggler\n|B.

But [for the price] they are not too much of an investment.\"\nIn a retrospective in Black Gate, John ONeill said \"As a business, the Dwarfstar line wasn't a success. Unlike Metagaming and Task Force, who released dozens of titles over the years, they produced only eight games between 1981-82. But from a creative perspective, they were a magnificent hit.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://dwarfstar.brainiac.com Website offering free authorized download of seven of the Dwarfstar games]"
