During the existence of the Congo Free State, the European population was estimated at 1500, with 120 Belgian officers in the Force Publique in 1892 and a population of 958 whites in 1901. Following annexation and the formation of the Belgian Congo, the white population was at 25,179 in 1925. It grew to 17,000 in 1930 but plummeted to 11,000 in 1934 and grew again in 1938 to 23,000 individuals. During the German invasion of Belgium 1940, the European population was at 29,791 as well as another 1,404 in Ruanda-Urundi.\nThe post-World War II white population increased steadily until 1960, when the Republic of the Congo achieved independence. In 1947, the population was 24,000, 112,759 in 1958, and 115,157 in 1959. The 1959 population included 1,900 agricultural settlers and 420 Europeans that were employed through INEAC in 1960.\n(modern-day Kisangani) under the Congo Free State in 1902]]\nThe Europeans fell into two groups: the colons, genuine settlers and the coloniaux, the colonial Europeans who came to Africa for temporary employment, working for either large private companies, for the state as civil servants, or with religious organizations as teachers and missionaries. The colons were a minority, numbering somewhere between 2,500 to 3,000 people while the coloniaux formed the vast majority of whites in Belgian Congo with their numbers over 100,000 in 1959.\nThe early white population was disproportionately young men with adult women only being 21% of the settler population in 1925. The Belgian authorities were convinced that celibacy would lead to greater profitability and limited the immigration of women until 1947. This number of women gradually increased to 35% in the 1950s and was at 46% by 1960.\nInitially, Belgians only made up a plurality of white settlers being 40% in 1890. The early population included many Scandinavians, but other European groups were also present. The Belgians numbered between 56% and 65% of the white population and by 1959 they made up close to four-fifths. Belgians made up 0.08 percent of the total Congolese population in 1925 and 0.6 percent in 1959. With the non-Belgian whites included, these numbers raise to 0.13 percent in 1925 and 0.8 percent in 1959.\nThe breakdown of the non-African population in the Belgian Congo in 1959 was: 87,736 Belgians, 5,361 Portuguese, 3,718 Italians, 3,483 Greeks, 2,380 French, 2,674 British, and 1,357 Dutch. 2,030 Americans, 825 Swiss, and 539 Luxembourgers. Smaller numbers of other non-African groups were also present.\nKatanga\nKatanga was an industrialized region of the Belgian Congo that was dominated by colonial enterprises, such as the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga. Between 1910 to 1920, the mines and railroads in Katanga employed white workers, but in 1920, they challenged the colonial administration by forming an illegal trade union. After a prolonged and sometimes violent struggle, the movement was broken apart and then quashed by the Great Depression. Migrant African workers would be brought in to work the mines and railroads, usually a period of three to twelve months and then forced to return to their original homes. In 1960, the State of Katanga broke-away from the Republic of Congo. At this time Katanga was very urban with miles of roads and railways, self-sustaining agriculture, and had a much higher income than the rest of the Congo due to its economy revolving around mining.\nKatanga had a much larger white population, at its height in 1960 numbering 33,918 or 2.08% of the total population of Katanga and a third of all whites in the Congo. In 1962, Irish diplomat Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that there was about \"30,000 or so\" Europeans in Katanga. The white Katangese formed a unique subgroup of settlers in the Belgian Congo. They came from skilled and professional classes, and were much more attached to province than settlers up north. They were hostile to the central government who they felt encroached on Katanga's status.\nThe white Katangese were also close to the white communities in Rhodesia and other nearby countries. Early separatists plans included forming a union with the white-minority governments of Rhodesia, Nyasaland, South Africa, Angola and Mozambique as a \"barrier to black Africa.\"\nPrior to the breakaway, in 1957 settlers set up political parties that defended against native nationalism. The Union pour la Colonisation du Katanga (Union for the Colonization of Katanga, UCOL-Katanga), was a settler organization and white advocacy group turned political party founded in 1944, with the purpose of \"securing for the white population of Katanga the liberties granted by the Belgian constitution, and to promote, by all available means, the growth of European colonization.\" Another was the Union Katangaise a European party which favored a \"Belgian-Katangese community,\" and white settlement. The parties wanted a permanent white population similar to South Africa, but they were not popular and thus co-opted a message that would align their settler aims with the natives.\nKatanga was led by the CONAKAT, a pro-European, African political party that was supported by UCOL-Katanga, the Union Katangaise, and professional elites which included businesses, lawyers, and influential European residents. In June 1960, Katanga led by Moïse Tshombe seceded from the Congo. Tshombe had white advisers and colleagues who he consulted during the secession and imported European and white African mercenaries. Despite Belgium's support of Katanga, it never officially recognized it.\nEconomic Activities\nBelgian authorities wanted to pursue an elitist colonization and discouraged large scale immigration of settlers, especially poor whites, instead mainly sending skilled workers..The large-scale industries in the colony, like mining and agriculture, struggled with indigenous labor shortages and felt that bringing in more settlers would only cause more problems. Between the 1930s and 1950s there was a small movement in favor of independent, white-run businesses, especially in the farming sector, but this barely influenced the government. It was only during the last fifteen years of the colony that the Belgian authorities began to facilitate these small businesses. By 1956 there was 9,362 independent white-run businesses, but settlers were largely neglected by government which favored large companies. In 1959 close to half of settlers worked in private enterprises following by smaller numbers that worked as civil servants, farmers, and missionaries.\nDecline\nin July 1960 during the Congo Crisis]]\nJust 5 days after the Congo's independence on June 30, 1960, Congolese soldiers mutinied against their white officers and within 11 days violence and looting became widespread in the country. Though acts of violence towards white civilians occurred across the country, some events were exaggerated which led to mass hysteria. Not soon after the white community began to flee to Europe and into the neighboring countries even before the first white casualties occurred. The first white casualties occurred on July 9 with the murder of five Europeans and an Italian consul in Elisabethville. The violence and collapse of the Congolese government fueled Belgian intervention and on the following day, July 10, Belgian paratroopers invaded Congo. Soon after Katanga seceded on July 11. During this time Belgian troops prevented white technicians and administrators from fleeing Katanga and facilitated the return of other white Congolese.\nWhites in Leopoldville fled to Brazzaville, those in and around Thysville fled into Portuguese Angola, those in the eastern provinces fled into Ruanda-Urundi, Uganda, Kenya, or Tanganyika. Some also fled to South Kasai and Katanga where Belgium was able to maintain order, though many many women and children fled into the Rhodesias while their husbands stayed behind. It's estimated that about 10,000 refugees, mainly women and children, had entered the Central African Federation within the first few days.\nThe Belgian government diverted Sabena aircraft to evacuate citizens, while other large-scale airlift operations were conducted by the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Portugal. Around 40,000 white refugees had fled within a two week period in July 1960.\nThe white communities in other African colonies took them in as refugees. Approximately 5,000 fled to the Rhodesias between 1961 and 1965. South Africa notably set up a trust that provided aid with the purpose of coordinating a pathway for refugees to permanently settle there. The South African government paid for their travel, lodging, food and organized employment for them, and even South African citizens allowed them to live with them. They sent recruiters to Salisbury, Nairobi, Bulawayo, Luanda, and Brazzaville to assist and convince them to settle in South Africa. A \"considerable\" number of refugees that did want to immigrate were Italians, Greeks, Cypriots, and Maltese, but they were considered \"undesirable\" as mentioned by the South African High Commissioner in Salisbury, Harold Taswell.\nMost refugees generally had a lukewarm response to the South African aid, with many returning to Europe or Katanga due to \"contractual obligations,\" while some turned the aid down due to pride. Of the refugees that stayed in South Africa, their experiences were mixed due to issues with employment. Established doctors, lawyers and engineers needed to obtain a South African degree to be able to be employed. Farmers who specialized in tropical climates were unable to apply their skills and struggled to find suitable land without major capital investment. Other sectors were also difficult for refugees to break into either due age or language barriers and ultimately many had to take jobs that weren't related to their qualifications. In addition the South African wage was not comparable to Congolese one. Only about a fifth of these refugees would remain in South Africa, mostly with the hope of eventually returning to Congo.\nIt was common for the refugees to abuse the system with some treating the experience as a holiday while others racked up copious amounts debt before returning to Belgium. Despite all the effort that South Africa put into encouraging them to stay, they stopped provided aid by the end August 1960, and the aid organizations and South African citizens wanted them returned. It's estimated that 2,342 white Congolese refugees had entered South Africa by the end of 1960, but only 748 had applied for residence. 5.5 million rands in today's currency had been spent by South Africa through this endeavor.\nIn 2008, there was around 30,000 former colonials in Belgium.\nIn 2006, 5,000 people from Belgium and 5,000 people from Greece lived in DR Congo.\nAs of 2024, 2,746 Belgian citizens reside in the Congo.\nLanguage\nFrench was the de facto official language of the Belgian Congo with about 73% of white Congolese using French as their main language. 23% were Flemish or Dutch speakers and 4% spoke other languages. There are anecdotes and testimonials of whites speaking and learning African languages, but it wasn't very common.\nDutch in the Belgian Congo\nThe arrival of Fleming officers, agents, and missionaries through the late 1870s and 1880s was the beginning structural presence of Dutch in Central Africa. Though Dutch speakers formed a majority in Belgium at the time and a large portion of early settlers were Flemings, French had been the primary language of administration and the Belgian elite and as such was in the Belgian Congo. Flemings in the Congo used Dutch informally or privately, but when communicating with locals they used either French or indigenous languages. Dutch had been seen as a lower language and at the time Flanders was impoverished, and since the colonial administration initially pursued a policy that didn't allow for the immigration of poor whites, Dutch never saw true official usage in the Belgian Congo.\nThe Colonial Charter of 1908 did stipulate that French and Flemish would have equal grounding in the Congo and that the linguistic rights of the Flemings would be granted as in Belgium. Prior to 1936, the Colonial Schools of Belgium had only instructed future settlers in French. Edmond Rubbens, the Minister of Colonies, pushed for bilingual education and administration in the Belgian Congo and in October 1936, he managed to have a Dutch-speaking department opened in the Colonial Schools. There was even at a time a proposal for the Belgian Congo to be divided into Flemish and French-speaking provinces, largely pushed by the far-right, Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond.\nPrior to 1957, Francophone law specialists argued that the charter only applied to private language usage and because there was no decrees regarding official communication, the continuation of French in administration was inherited from the previous administration prior to 1908. As the number of Flemings grew in the Congo during the 1940s, there was growing resentment that the colonial government had not followed through with the charter. This started in 1939 when Flemish civil servants had their rights recognized to use Dutch in official correspondences. White children in the Congo only learned French and it wasn't until 1948 that the white schools starting implementing separate French and Dutch-speaking sections. Dutch education was limited though and by 1956 only 24 of the 43 primary schools for whites and 8 of the 25 secondary schools had Dutch classes.\nIn 1952, a judge, Jozef Grootaert, conducted a trial and sentencing in Elisabethville, entirely in Dutch. Grootaert was a major proponent for the officialization of Dutch in the colonies and his case caused a huge controversy that resulted in a legal battle that lasted between 1952 and 1956, and was ultimately settled by a 1957 decree that allowed for Flemings to be heard and tried in Dutch in colonial courts. This was the only linguistic-related decree ever made in the colony. Between 1957 and 1958 there were attempts to create a similar decree to allow Dutch in administration and even discussion to bilingualize the University of Elisabethville, but the rise of native nationalism and independence in 1960, ended any such movements.\nThe introduction of Dutch was not only unpopular with the French-speaking whites, but with the native Congolese as well. They didn't have a say in the matter except for being able to advise what languages to use in education at the provincial level. Of the six provinces of Belgian Congo, only Katanga allowed for a choice between French and Dutch, while the others chose to make French the sole language of education. After independence, bilingualism was largely abandoned by the Congolese and in 1961 the new government ordered that all Dutch documents and signs be removed and replaced with French ones.\nFlemish speakers were specifically targeted during the Congo Crisis.\nReligion\nOver three-quarters of white Congolese were Catholic.\nNotable people\n* Pierre Ubaldo Ferrari, former CEO of Heifer International (2010-2022), born in Elizabethville in 1950, the son of Italian and Belgian settlers\nSee also\n*\n*Congo Crisis\n*Invasion of South Kasai\n*Operation Dragon Rouge\n*White Africans of European ancestry\n*Pieds-noirs\n*History of the Jews in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n*Greeks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\"Democratic Republic of Congo Country Profile.\" Genocide Watch, 1 December 2012.\n*\n*\n*"
