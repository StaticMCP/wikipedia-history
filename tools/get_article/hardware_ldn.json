Most notably these include London, NYC and L.A. She describes the brand as \"bold, edgy, provocative, fun, London\" and wants to \"create a lifestyle brand with a strong identity\".\nHorwell has strong connections with the music industry through her styling and creative direction work. Hardware LDN has been seen on Artists such as Wiz Khalifa, Halsey, Wu-tang and Mac Miller, and in summer 2015 provided the clothing for all the backing dancers for Rita Ora's UK summer tour.\nReferences"
