It was adapted by Steve Attridge from the novel of the same name written by Dick King-Smith. It ran for seven series.\nPremise\nHarmony Parker, a twelve-year-old girl who loves animals, receives a magical 50-pence coin from her Uncle Ginger that can grant wishes when Queen Elizabeth II's nose is rubbed.\nProduction\nThe novel was adapted into three television series by the BBC which were broadcast during the CBBC slot between 1995 and 1998. The stories remained faithful to the book, although in the book Harmony is granted only seven wishes compared to the ten wishes being granted upon rubbing the coin in the TV series. The first series by Steve Attridge, directed by Carol Wiseman and edited by Sue Robinson, won the Royal Television Society 1996 award for best Children's Drama,[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225174716/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/event/10128 BFI | Film & TV Database|1996]\nand the third series also by Steve Attridge winning the Indie Awards 1999 prize for Digital Cinematography.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225174721/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/event/14936 BFI | Film & TV Database|1999] According to a podtail interview with Victoria Shalet in February 2021, the director Carol Wiseman was responsible for her being cast in the role of Harmony Parker after she had been impressed with the actress after working with her on the TV series Goggle-Eyes in 1993.\nIn 2000, the BBC revived the series with new stories, but without the main character Harmony, with a further four series being made between 2000 and 2003. Many viewers felt that the departure from the novels and the loss of the main character, played by Shalet, diminished the series.[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112133/usercomments \"The Queen's Nose\" (1995) – IMDb user comments] The later series did however still feature other members of the Parker family in various roles. Harmony's sister Melody, played by Heather-Jay Jones, stayed on until the penultimate series. As of 2010, ''The Queen's Nose was no longer repeated on the CBBC Channel.\nThe Queen's Nose has also been broadcast in Germany, under the name Die Magische Münze'' (The Magic Coin).[http://www.wunschliste.de/links.pl?s=6663 Die magische Münze / The Queen's Nose (TV-Serie) – wunschliste.de]\nCast\n*Harmony Parker – Victoria Shalet (series 1–4)\n*Melody Parker – Heather-Jay Jones (series 1–6)\n*Mr Arthur Parker – Stephen Moore (series 1–2, 4–5)\n*Mrs Audrey Parker – Paula Wilcox (series 1–2, 4–5)\n*Uncle Ginger – Donald Sumpter (series 1–3)\n*Gregory – Callum Dixon (series 1–3, 6)\n*Tom – Anthony Hamblin (series 1, 2)\n*Granny – Liz Smith (series 2)\n*Aunt Glenda – Nerys Hughes (series 3)\n*Dino – Vicki Lee Taylor (series 3)\n*Grobler – Ian Reddington (series 3)\n*Himself – Gary Mabbutt (series 1)\n*Himself – Tony Blackburn (series 2)\n*Paul – Joe Cadden (series 2, 7)\n*Sam – Ella Jones (series 4–6, 7)\n*Sophie – Dominique Moore (series 4–6, 7)\n*Mrs Dooley – Annette Badland (series 4, 5)\n*Aaron – Darryl Hutton (series 4)\n*Pansy – Grace Atherton (series 4–6)\n*Emily – Montanna Thompson (series 4)\n*Melody's Agent – Paul Danan (series 6)\n*Jake – Jordan Metcalfe (series 7)\n*Gemma – Lucinda Dryzek (series 7)\n*Chief – David Sterne (series 7)\n*Wesley – Joshua Garland (series 7)\n*Duncan – Nicholas Gleaves (series 7)\n*Nick – Brock Everitt-Elwick (series 7)\n*Carla – Juliet Cowan (series 7)\n*Ben – Pablo Duarte (series 6, 7)\n*Mr Marsh – Bill Bingham (series 7)\n*Darren – Andrew James Michel (series 7)\n*Frank – Martin Jarvis (series 7)\n*Frank Puppeteer – William Todd-Jones (series 7)\n*Judge – Bob Goody (series 4–one episode)\nOwners of ''The Queen's Nose''\n* Harmony Parker (series 1 to 3)\n* Dino Parker (series 3 alongside Harmony)\n* Sam (series 4 to 6)\n* Jake (series 7)\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center;\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Series !!
