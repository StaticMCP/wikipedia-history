Administered by the Sir Syed Education Society of North America, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, the program provides mentorship and limited financial assistance.\nHistory and Development\nThe program was originally launched as the \"Sir Syed Excellence in Science Award\" in 2006 with the aim of facilitating access to graduate programs in the United States for AMU students. It was later renamed to reflect an expanded international scope.\nAwardees receive support for graduate school applications, including funding for standardized test registration and application fees. They are also matched with volunteer mentors—often AMU alumni working in academia or industry—who guide them through the university application process. Over the years, the initiative has grown to include a broader set of disciplines and target destinations, including universities in Europe, Canada, and Asia.\nImpact\nAs of 2025, the program has supported over 200 individuals in securing admission to universities in more than 20 countries.\nSeveral alumni of the program have subsequently received competitive research fellowships and academic distinctions in both the United States and Europe. Alumni have also contributed to major international collaborations, including teams at CERN that were recognized with the 2025 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics.\nThe organization has also collaborated with several U.S. universities to host Indian students for short-term summer research internships. These experiences have allowed participants to gain exposure to academic research environments abroad.\nCommunity Engagement\nAward recipients often remain involved in the program after completing their studies. Many participate in peer mentoring, educational outreach, and nonprofit efforts to expand access to international education opportunities for underrepresented groups. This community-driven model has helped sustain a long-term network of support and guidance.\nMedia Coverage\nThe initiative has been covered by Indian and international media for its role in supporting academic mobility among minority and underrepresented students. A 2013 article in *Business Standard* described early collaborations with U.S. institutions that hosted AMU students for summer internships. The *Higher Education Review* also reported on this development.\nEach year, coverage of the SSGSA award announcements appears in Indian media outlets including *Hindustan Times*, *Ummid News*, and *Salam-e-Vatan*.\nSee also\n* Aligarh Muslim University\n* Scholarships\nReferences"
