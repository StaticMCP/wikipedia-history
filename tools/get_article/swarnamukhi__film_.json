Parthiban took the film's distribution rights in lieu of his fees. D. S. Ramanujam of The Hindu wrote that the director \"draws the best of the three lead artistes, Parthipan, Prakashraj and Devyanai, each trying to outscore the other, the honours being even in the end\". He also appreciated the cinematography. K. N. Vijiyan of New Straits Times lauded Adhiyaman's dialogue, the performances of Prakash Raj and Parthiban, but criticised Fathima Babu's performance and felt the cinematography by Anandakumar was \"brilliant and at times shoddy and exasperating\". Ji of Kalki wrote Devayani struggled while dancing Bharatanatyam but her acting becomes better in second half, he also praised Parthiban's presence as relief in first half, but felt his character's domination in second half reduces the scope of Prakash Raj's character and also found Parthiban's character uttering dialogues demeaning women and the reason for his behaviour were unnecessary and absurd. Ji concluded that since the film had too many dialogues having \"naai\" (dog), it gave a feeling of sitting in a corporation dog vehicle for two hours. Two years after release, the producers were given a  subsidy by the Tamil Nadu government along with several other films.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
