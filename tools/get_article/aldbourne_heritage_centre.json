It is managed by the Aldbourne Community Heritage Group (ACHG), which also organises talks and events on topics related to local history.\nPartners\nThe Heritage Centre is a member of the South Western Federation of Museums and Art Galleries. In 2015 it was a partner in Wiltshire Museum's project \"Wiltshire's Story in 100 Objects\", a touring exhibition celebrating the rich history of the county, having provided an 18th-century crotal bell cast in Aldbourne as one of the 100 objects.\nExhibitions\nThe Centre presents a changing set of displays, covering a diverse range of subjects, such as:\n* the Aldbourne Cup – a finely-decorated incense cup from the early Bronze Age found in a local barrow;\n* the geology forming the pond and village, and the legend of the dabchick and its relevance to the village;\n* the story of Charles McEvoy's lost play \"The Village Wedding\" and its recent discovery;\n* court cases between local tenants and The Crown in 1560 (Queen Elizabeth) and 1607 (King James I);\n* stories of the inhabitants of Aldbourne at the time of the Enclosure Acts in the early 19th century;\n* the development of local industries such as fustian-weaving and chair-making;\n* the important bell founding industry which operated in Aldbourne from the 17th–19th centuries;\n* the effects of fires in the village from the 18th century to the present day;\n* the history of established religion, non-conformism and dissension in the village; and\n* the residence in Aldbourne of Easy Company of the US Army 101st Airborne Division (later popularised in book and film as Band of Brothers) in the lead up to D-Day, and other military units during both World Wars.\nObjects on display include prehistoric flints used as tools and recovered from local Bronze Age barrows; two replicas of the Aldbourne Cup, one in its current, aged and reconstructed state, and a second in its original state (the original is on display at the British Museum); copies of mediaeval and Tudor documents relating to the exercise of manorial rights by the Duchy of Lancaster and the judgments of manorial courts; a range of hand-bells and crotal bells made in Aldbourne by the Corr and Wells families (and others); a 19th-century fireman’s helmet; items of Victorian (and earlier) agricultural hand tools; items relating to the wartime residence of US military personnel in the village; and thousands of photographs of life in Aldbourne from the mid-Victorian period to the present day.\nOpening times\nThe centre is open on Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays throughout the summer. Visits at other times can be arranged by appointment.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Wiltshire\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
