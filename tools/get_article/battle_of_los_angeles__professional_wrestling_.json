      "text": "# Battle of Los Angeles (professional wrestling)\n\nThe Battle of Los Angeles tournament (the BOLA) is an annual independent wrestling tournament in North America, run and promoted by Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG). It is the flagship event of PWG. Over the years, the tournament has featured numerous notable wrestlers such as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling stars A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels, future WWE world champions Kevin Steen (Kevin Owens), Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan), Tyler Black (Seth Rollins) and Drew Galloway (Drew McIntyre), future AEW world champion Kenny Omega and future Impact world champions Brian Cage, Pentagón Jr., Chris Sabin, Rich Swann, Sami Callihan, John Hennigan (Johnny Impact), Austin Aries and Eddie Edwards.\nThe tournament setup\nThe number of participants have often changed over the years. In the first year of the Battle of Los Angeles, there were sixteen participants, with eight opening round matches, four quarterfinal matches, two semifinal matches, and a final. In 2006 the tournament was expanded to 24 participants, which caused the addition of another eight person bracket and created three semifinals matches and an elimination three-way final match. In 2008 the tournament returned to its 16-man format. In 2011, the tournament was completely revamped, taking place for the first time as a one night tournament with only eight participants. In 2014, the tournament reverted to a 24-man format held over three nights. The first two nights are all first-round matches, while the third night contains the quarter-finals and semi-finals before culminating in a three-way match. In 2022, the tournament was reduced to sixteen participants.\nAll nights also feature non-tournament special attractions, which are usually tag-team matches involving tournament participants from other nights or eliminated wrestlers. Titles are also occasionally defended on these events.\nThe tournament winner is awarded a title shot for the PWG World Championship. The champion himself often participates in the tournament and if some other wrestler wins the tournament then he is entitled to a title shot. So far, no champion has won the tournament. There have been a few instances where the winner did not receive a title shot. For example, the 2006 winner Davey Richards cashed in on a PWG World Tag Team Championship opportunity instead of challenging for the World Championship. The 2007 winner CIMA did not invoke his title shot while the 2008 winner Low Ki left PWG immediately after winning the tournament due to signing with WWE. The 2009 tournament was itself contested for the vacant PWG World Championship.\nWinners, dates, venues and main events\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Tournament winner\n!Times won\n!Date\n!Runner-up\n!City\n!Venue\n!Main Event\n!Ref.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2005\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Chris Bosh\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|AJ Styles\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Los Angeles, California\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hollywood-Los Feliz Jewish Community Center\n|Kevin Steen vs. Super Dragon in the first round of the 2005 Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|AJ Styles vs. Chris Bosh in the 2005 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2006\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Davey Richards\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|CIMA\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Reseda, Los Angeles, California\n|rowspan=\"3\"|American Legion Post #308\n|B-Boy, Excalibur, Homicide and Human Tornado vs. Petey Williams and The Dynasty (Chris Bosh, Joey Ryan and Scott Lost)\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|Necro Butcher vs. Super Dragon in a No Disqualification match in the first round of the 2006 Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|-\n|\n|CIMA vs. Davey Richards in the 2006 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2007\n|rowspan=\"3\"|CIMA\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|El Generico and Roderick Strong\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Burbank, California\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Burbank Armory\n|El Generico and Kevin Steen (c) vs. Dragon Kid and Susumu Yokosuka for the PWG World Tag Team Championship\n|\n|-\n|\n|Dragon Kid vs. Susumu Yokosuka in the first round of the 2007 Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|\n|-\n|\n|CIMA vs. El Generico vs. Roderick Strong in a three-way elimination match in the 2007 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2008\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Low Ki\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Chris Hero\n|Chris Hero vs. Necro Butcher in a No Disqualification match in the first round of the 2008 Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|\n|-\n|\n|Chris Hero vs. Low Ki in the 2008 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2009\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Kenny Omega\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Roderick Strong\n|rowspan=\"21\"|Reseda, Los Angeles, California\n|rowspan=\"21\"|American Legion Post #308\n|Alex Shelley vs. El Generico in the first round of the 2009 Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|\n|-\n|\n|Kenny Omega vs. Roderick Strong in the 2009 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final for the vacant PWG World Championship\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2010\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Joey Ryan\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Chris Hero\n|Chris Hero vs. Christopher Daniels in the first round of the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|\n|-\n|\n|Chris Hero vs. Joey Ryan in the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|El Generico\n|1\n|\n|Kevin Steen\n|Kevin Steen vs. El Generico in the 2011 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2012\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Adam Cole\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Michael Elgin\n|Davey Richards vs. Michael Elgin in the first round of the 2012 Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|\n|-\n|\n|Adam Cole vs. Michael Elgin in the 2012 Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2013\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Kyle O'Reilly\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Michael Elgin\n|Adam Cole and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) vs. Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) and T.J.
