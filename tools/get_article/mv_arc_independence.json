She sailed under the Swedish flag for just over twelve years, serving with Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics. In October 2019, she was re-flagged into the United States Merchant Marine under her current name, and is operated by American Roll-On Roll-Off Carrier (ARC). Her sister ship, MV ARC Integrity (ex-Fedora) was likewise re-flagged at the same time and continues to operate with ARC. They are among the largest car carriers in the world.\nIt is sometimes incorrectly reported that in 2004, this particular ex-M/V Faust was renamed to M/V Liberty.  This is due to multiple vessels having carried the name Faust.  The Faust which was renamed to Liberty was built by Oshima Shipbuilding in Japan and launched in 1985; at 660' in length and 52,000 gross tons, she was significantly smaller than the vessel which is now the ARC Independence.\nFaust appeared in a 2008 episode of the Discovery Channel's documentary series Mighty Ships during a voyage between the UK and United States.\nReferences"
