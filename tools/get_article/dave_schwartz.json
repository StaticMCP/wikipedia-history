Often referring to viewers as \"my friends\" before giving forecasts, Schwartz presented an easygoing manner and a gentle sense of humor that made him popular with the viewers.\nBiography\nEarly life\nSchwartz was born on February 20, 1953, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he grew up and earned a degree in psychology from Temple University. He received a certificate in meteorology studies from Mississippi State University.\nThe Weather Channel\nSchwartz joined the Weather Channel in 1982, initially as a newsroom assistant while working for the Fulton County Health Department in Georgia. He became an on-camera meteorologist in 1991. Shortly after NBC/Comcast bought The Weather Channel in 2008, Schwartz was one of a handful of longtime on-camera meteorologists who were laid off in a shakeup that sought to send the network in a new direction. After years of viewer feedback—including a website called \"Bring Back Dave Schwartz\"—the network rehired him in the spring of 2014.\nDeath\nSchwartz died on July 30, 2016, after a ten-year battle with pancreatic and stomach cancer, the former of which he beat twice. He was 63. The Washington Post published a tribute article with essays from many of Schwartz's coworkers.\nReferences"
