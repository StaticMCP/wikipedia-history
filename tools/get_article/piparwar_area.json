Only a small corner of this coalfield was exploited earlier. On the southern side of the Damodar River, there are some long established coal mines – Karkatta, KD Hesalong, Manki, Churi, Bachara and Dakara. Some of these coal mines are part of the North Karanpura Area of Central Coalfields. On the northern side of the Damodar River, the first mine to be undertaken was the prestigious Piparwar mine. This was followed by the contiguous Ashoka mine and subsequently many others. The entire area is buzzing with activity. However, there is a note of caution: “Throughout the coalfields,  it is important to remember that the majority of the population are indigenous people, Oraons, Mundas and Karamalis amongst the STs, Mahatos, Yadavs and Teli Saos among the BCs, and Bhuiyas, Ganjhus, Turis, Paswans and Chamars among the SCs. This means that those to be affected are almost totally of the weakest section of Indian society.”\nFuture mega projects in the area include: Magadh opencast project expansion with nominal capacity of 51 million tonnes per year and peak capacity of 70 million tonnes per year, Amrapali OCP expansion with nominal capacity of 25 MTY and peak capacity of 35 MTY, Sanghamitra OCP with nominal capacity of 20 MTY and peak capacity of 27 MTY, and  Chandragupta OCP with nominal capacity of 15 MTY and peak capacity of 20 MTY.\nMining activity\n| float=left|caption=Cities, towns and locations in Chatra district in North Chotanagpur DivisionM: municipality, CT: census town, R: rural/ urban centre, H: historical/ religious centre, P: power plant, T: tourist centreAbbreviation used - TPS: thermal power stationOwing to space constraints in the small map, the actual locations in a larger map may vary slightly\n|mark-coord1= | label-pos1=bottom|label1= Chiridiri | numbered1=R| mark-title1=Chiridiri (R)|label-color1=#800000 |label-size1=11| mark-size1=12|shape1=l-circle|shape-color1= #C40000|shape-outline1=white|label-offset-x1=2\n|mark-coord2= | label-pos2=right|label2= Gidhour| numbered2=R| mark-title2=Gidhour (R)\n|mark-coord3= | label-pos3=left|label3= Hunterganj| numbered3=R| mark-title3=Hunterganj (R)\n|mark-coord4= | label-pos4=bottom|label4= Itkhori| numbered4=R| mark-title4=Itkhori (R)\n|mark-coord5= | label-pos5=right|label5= Kunda| numbered5=R| mark-title5=Kunda, Chatra (R)\n|mark-coord6= | label-pos6=right|label6= Lawalong| numbered6=R| mark-title6=Lawalong, Chatra (R)\n|mark-coord7= | label-pos7=top|label7= Mayurhand| numbered7=R| mark-title7=Mayurhand (R)\n|mark-coord8= | label-pos8=left|label8= Pathalgada| numbered8=R| mark-title8=Pathalgada (R)\n|mark-coord9= | label-pos9=left|label9= Piparwar| numbered9=R| mark-title9=Piparwar, Chatra (R)\n|mark-coord10= | label-pos10=right|label10= Pratappur| numbered10=R| mark-title10=Pratappur, Chatra (R)\n|mark-coord11= | label-pos11=left|label11= Rajpur| numbered11=R| mark-title11=Rajpur, Chatra (R)\n|mark-coord12= | label-pos12=left|label12= Simaria| numbered12=R| mark-title12=Simaria, Chatra (R)\n|mark-coord13= | label-pos13=right|label13= Tandwa| numbered13=R| mark-title13=Tandwa (R)\n|mark-coord14= | label-pos14=bottom|label14=Chatra| numbered14=M| mark-title14= Chatra, Jharkhand (M) |label-size14=13 |label-color14=#800000\n|mark-coord15=| label-pos15=right|label15=Bachra| numbered15=CT| mark-title15= Bachra (CT) |shape-color15= #A40000\n|mark-coord16= | label-pos16=bottom|label16= Kauleshwari |labela16=Temple| numbered16=H| mark-title16=Kauleshwari Temple (H) | shape-color16=#AA6666\n|mark-coord17= | label-pos17=bottom|label17=Lawalong|labela17=Wildlife|labelb17= Sanctuary| numbered17=T|shape-color17= #74C365| mark-title17= Lawalong Wildlife Sanctuary (T)\n|mark-coord18= | label-pos18=left|label18= North Karanpura TPS | numbered18=P| mark-title18= North Karanpura Thermal Power Station |shape-color18=#967117\n|mark-coord19= | label-pos19=top|label19=CCL Piparwar Area |numbered19=0 | mark-title19=Piparwar Area |shape-color19=black| label-size19=13|label-color19=black\n|mark-coord20= | label-pos20=right|label20=CCL Magadh|labela20= Sanghamitra Area |numbered20=0 | mark-title20=Magadh Sanghamitra Area | label-size20=12| shape-color20=#AA6666\n|mark-coord21= | label-pos21=top|label21=CCL Amrapali |labela21=& Chandragupta Area |numbered21=0 | mark-title21=Amrapali & Chandragupta Area | label-size21=12| shape-color21=#AA6666\n|mark-coord22= |label22= Damodar|labela22= River|label-color22 = #77A1CB| label-angle22= 0| label-pos22=top| label-size22=10| mark-size22=0| mark-title22 =none\n|mark-coord23= |label23= Lilajan|labela23= River|label-color23 = #77A1CB| label-angle23= -90| label-pos23=top| label-size23=10| mark-size23=0| mark-title23 =none\n|mark-coord24= |label24= Mohana|labela24= River|label-color24 = #77A1CB| label-angle24= -90| label-pos24=top| label-size24=10| mark-size24=0| mark-title24 =none\n|mark-coord25= |label25= Amanat|labela25= River|label-color25 = #77A1CB| label-angle25= -10| label-pos25=top| label-size25=10| mark-size25=0| mark-title25 =none\n|arc-coordA=|arc-textA= BIHAR| arc-text-colorA=hard grey| arc-angleA=-60| arc-gapA=12.5| arc-radiusA=0.25}}\nMines and projects\nPiparwar open cast project was commissioned with Australian collaboration in the 1990s. In 2014, it was expanded from a normative capacity 10 million tonnes per annum to 12.50 MTPA and peak capacity from 11.5 MTPA to 14.375 MTPA. The total geological reserve was 244 million tonnes and mineable reserve was   48.80 million tonnes. The life of the mine was estimated to be 13 years from 2007. A railway siding at Piparwar was provided to avoid coal transportation by road. Ray railway station on the Barkakana-Son Nagar line is  away.\nCCL has installed solar plants on the roof of houses, in order to reduce day-time demand. In addition, they have planned to instal an 80 megawatt peak ground-mounted solar power plant at Piparwar.\nPiparwar Mangardaha underground mine is a new mine that will work in the Piparwar and Mangardaha blocks of the Lower Bachra (bottom section) seam. A major portion of the mining area lies below Piparwar OCP. The area from where coal has been taken out is partly filled up by internal dumps. It is located in the North Karanpura Coalfield.  Proposed production from the mine is 1.38 million tonnes per year.\nAshoka opencast project in the North Karanpura Coalfield in Chatra district commenced operations in 1995. In 2013–14, it produced 7.50 million tonnes of coal. The estimated mineable reserve in the Ashoka block was 121.66 MT as on 01.04.2014. Ashoka block is characterized by more or less flat terrain with gentle undulations. The highest and the lowest elevations in the Ashoka block are  and  (above mean sea level) respectively. In 2014, the production capacity was raised from 6.5 million tonnes per year to 10.00 million tonnes per year. Major efforts have been made by CCL for land restoration/ reclamation and afforestation.\nThe Washery, with a production capacity of 10 million tonnes per year,  was 500 m from the mine.\nRay-Bachra underground project had a planned production capacity of 0.30 million tonnes per year. It is located in Chatra district.\nEducational facilities for employees’ children\nCentral Coalfields Limited provides support for reputed institutions/ trusts for setting up 10+2 pattern CBSE schools for children of CCL employees. It provides 109 buses to employees’ children to schools and back. Among the schools in the North Karanpura Coalfield that receive financial help or structural support is: DAV Bachra.\nMedical facilities\nIn the North Karanpura Coalfield, CCL has the following facilities:\nCentral Hospital at Dakra with 50 beds has 11 general duty medical officers and 1 specialist. Among the facilities are: X‐Ray, ECG, Semi auto analyzer, monitor defibrillator , dental chair. It has 2 ambulances.\nPiparwar Hospital at Bachra with 11 beds has 6 general duty medical officers and 1 specialist. Among the facilities it has are: cardiac monitor, suction machine, X-Ray machine and ECG. It has 4 ambulances.\nThere are central facilities in the Central Hospital, Gandhinagar at Kanke Road, Ranchi with 250 beds and in the Central Hospital, Naisarai at Ramgarh with 150 beds.\nThere are dispensaries at Rohini, KDH, Purnadih/ Karkatta in North Karanapura Area, at Amrapali Project, Magadh Project in the Magadh Sanghamitra Area, at Tetariakhad in the Rajhara Area.\nReferences"
