Amlak, until the Ethiopian Revolution of 1974 when the last emperor, Haile Selassie, was deposed in a coup d'état.\nEarlier kings of the Dʿmt, Axum and Zagwe kingdoms are listed separately due to numerous gaps and large flexibility in chronology.\nFor legendary and archeologically unverified rulers of Ethiopian tradition, see Regnal lists of Ethiopia and 1922 regnal list of Ethiopia.\nNames in italics indicate rulers who were usurpers or not widely recognized.\nSolomonic dynasty\n| life1        = Died 19 June 1285\n| reignstart1  = 10 August 1270\n| reignend1    = 19 June 1285\n| notes1
