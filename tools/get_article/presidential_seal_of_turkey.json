It has a large 16-pointed Sun in the center which symbolizes the Republic of Turkey. The sun is surrounded by 16 five-pointed stars, symbolizing the 16 Great Turkic Empires in history.\nHistory\nThe roots of the Presidential Seal and Presidential Flag of Turkey go back to September 1922, when a similar flag was used on the automobile that took Mustafa Kemal Atatürk to İzmir during the final days of the Turkish War of Independence. This flag is currently on display at the Anıtkabir Museum in Ankara. The Presidential Flag's characteristics and proportions were legalized with the Sancak Talimatnamesi law on October 22, 1925. According to this law, the Presidential Seal's dimensions were defined as \"70cm x 70cm\", while the Sun in the center (which looked similar to the current one) was a 20-pointed star containing 10 sharp-edged and 10 oval-edged light rays. The \"70cm x 70cm\" dimensions of the Presidential Seal were maintained in the Turkish Flag Law of May 29, 1936; but were later reduced to \"30cm x 30cm\" with a new legal amendment that was made on September 14, 1937. The number of the light rays in the Sun of the Presidential Seal were reduced to 16 (8 long and 8 short light rays, all of them sharp-edged) in order to symbolize the 16 Turkic states in history, with another legal amendment on February 18, 1978. The seal and flag took their current shape and proportions with the final legal amendment on January 25, 1985.\nThe 16 Great Turkic Empires are a Pan-Turkist concept introduced in 1969 by Akib Özbek. Its association with the seal was introduced in 1985, under president Kenan Evren. Prior to this assertion, the 16 stars had been taken as representing sixteen medieval beyliks which succeeded the Seljuk Empire.\nMeasurements\nThe 16 stars are aligned with a 22.5 degree angle, equidistantly surrounding the sun. One edge of each star points to the center of the sun. The unit of measurement of the seal is the diameter of the circle around the edges of any one of the 16 stars (A). The lengths of the rays of the sun, the distance between the rays and the edges of the stars and the diameter of the outmost circle are determined as multiples of the unit A.\nColors\nThe exact black, gold, and red colors to be used in the emblem are specified with reference to the regulations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ Color specifications\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; padding-left:.5em; padding-right:.5em\" | PMS\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:3em; min-width:3em\" |\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" | RGB\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" | CMYK\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | R !! style=\"text-align:center\" | G !! style=\"text-align:center\" | B !! style=\"text-align:center\" | 8-bit hex\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | C !! style=\"text-align:center\" | M !! style=\"text-align:center\" | Y !! style=\"text-align:center\" | K\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |\n|\n| style=\"background:#000000\" title=\"#FFFFFF\" |\n| 0 || 0 || 0 ||\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 100\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |\n|\n| style=\"background:#C0B544\" title=\"#C0B544\" |\n| 192 || 181 || 68 ||\n| 18 || 23 || 71 || 8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |\n| 032 C\n| style=\"background:#F20000\" title=\"#F20000\" |\n| 242 || 0 || 0 ||\n| 5 || 100 || 100 || 0\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Defense.gov News Photo 981106-D-9880W-065.jpg|The Presidential Seal behind Demirel (1998)\nFile:Burhanettin Yeşilyurt.jpg|The Presidential Seal behind President Gül (2013)\nFile:Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at Izmir, November 2021 (1).jpg|The Presidential Seal attached to a lectern in front of President Erdoğan (2021)\nSee also\n* Emblems of Turkey\n* Flag of Turkey\n* Presidential Complex, the official residence of the president of Turkey\nReferences\nExternal website\n*"
