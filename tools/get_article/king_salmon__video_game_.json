It was due for release in Europe by July, but the plan was cancelled.\nGameplay\nPlayers participate in a big fishing derby; and spend a day catching as many king salmon as possible. Many activities of real-life fishing are included like driving the boat, assembling the lure onto the fishing rod and overcome a motley crew of fishermen at the same time.\nAs players become successful in catching fish, they become stronger and more adept fishermen themselves. This system operates similar to a role-playing video game. Players can choose between a leisurely fishing trip that involves the aspect of fishing on a sunny afternoon or a championship mode where the game's story takes effect. One of the settings in the game is Vancouver Island; one of the places where king salmon are abundant.\nPasswords allow players to resume where they left off.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
