It was recorded when Murphy was 51 years old in 1983 and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1985. This album is collection of songs associated with Nat King Cole.\nBackground\nIn 1983 Murphy decided to record a tribute album to his teenage idol Nat King Cole. Murphy said, \"Everybody else was a Sinatra freak, but I was a Nat King Cole freak...He was like rhythmic honey\". Murphy said that Cole delivered, \"the loosest, slipperiest vocals in the world\". This album is a continuation of Mark Murphy Sings the Nat King Cole Songbook, Volume One'' and the tracks were recorded at the same sessions.\nRecording\nThe tracks were recorded in two sessions in October and November 1983 with Murphy and Steve Zegree producing. Each tune is recorded as a duet with a single instrument, either bass, piano or guitar. Murphy was attracted to the challenge of having his voice so very exposed in this rather stark approach to the songs. Michael Bourne wrote in the liner notes, \"Murphy's voice, always a spectacular instrument in itself, is called upon to be even more virtuosic than ever\". Murphy said the recording was a tribute, not a copy, \"to my first influence, and to Nat's taste. Of course he could make everything sound good, but he also picked such wonderful songs\". Murphy decided to record many lesser known songs associated with Cole, and avoided many of his bigger hits.\nBob Magnusson, who appeared with Murphy on Bop for Kerouac, accompanies on bass on two tracks (2, 8). The pianist and guitarist had not previously recorded with Murphy. Gary Schunk accompanies on piano on three tracks (1, 3, 6).  And Murphy is accompanied by guitarist Joseph LoDuca on four tracks (4, 5, 6, 9).\nReception\n| rev2 = The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev2score =\n}}\nScott Yanow assigns 3 stars to this release in the AllMusic Guide to Jazz. He said, \"It would have been nice if all of the musicians could have played together a bit, but the strong material and Murphy's interpretive skills hold one's interest throughout...Murphy mostly avoided the obvious hits, opting for particularly strong material that fits his chance-taking style\".\nColin Larkin assigns 3 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. (3 stars means, \"Good: a record of average worth, but one that might possess considerable appeal for fans of a particular style\").\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones said the recordings for Volume 2 were \"more accessible\" than Volume 1.\nTrack listing\n# \"Portrait of Jennie / Ruby\" (J.
