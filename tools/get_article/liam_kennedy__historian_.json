He finished last, with 147 votes. He has called for a commission of inquiry into punishment attacks, which he considers a form of child abuse, considering that many victims are minors and some younger than 14. According to Kennedy, Sinn Féin is involved in  the attacks, which the party denies.\nKennedy's look at Irish history, Unhappy the Land: The Most Oppressed People Ever, the Irish?, was published in 2016.\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://www.liam-kennedy.com  Personal website]"
