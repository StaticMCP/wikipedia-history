R. Towne; and commissioned 16 November 1954. She was reclassified MSO-434, 7 February 1955.\nWest Coast operations\nSince commissioning Embattle has served with Mine Forces, Pacific Fleet, engaged in type training and exercises along the U.S. West Coast from her home port of Long Beach, California.\nFrom May to November 1956, and from November 1958 to May 1959, she cruised to the Far East for exercises with the U.S. 7th Fleet and called at various Japanese ports, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the Philippines.\nFrom May 1959 through the end of 1960 Embattle cruised the U.S. West Coast, training and maintaining her readiness at the traditionally high Navy level.\nDeployed to the Western Pacific in 1969, she remained active with the 7th Fleet until 2 May 1970 when she returned to the U.S. West Coast.  Upon returning \"Embattle\" was designated a Reserve training ship homeported in Long Beach, CA.\nDecommissioning\nEmbattle was decommissioned in September 1972.  She was struck from the Navy list on 15 May 1976, and was sold for scrapping on 11 January 1976.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
