He ruled the kingdom between 311 BC until his death in 279&nbsp;BC.\nKing Zhao was a son of Ji Kuai. In early years, he was chosen to serve as a political hostage in the Han state.\nIn 314 BC, Yan was attacked and practically conquered by the Qi state, and both Ji Kuai and the usurper Zi Zhi (子之) were killed. However, Qi was unable to put down the rebellion in the former territories of Yan and had to withdraw. Finally, the Yan state was restored. King Zhao was installed as the new king of Yan by King Wuling of Zhao, and sent back to Yan.\nKing Zhao was judicious and measured in his actions toward his subordinates. He hired talents with high salary, these talents include: Yue Yi, Zou Yan (鄒衍), and Ju Xin (劇辛). Yan became a powerful kingdom and was able to take revenge on Qi. In 284, he plotted with the states of Zhao, Qin, Han and Wei for a joint expedition against Qi. Led by the brilliant general Yue Yi, seventy walled cities were taken by the joint expedition, with the exception of Jimo and Ju. King Zhao died in 279 BC, succeeded by his son King Hui.\nReferences"
