      "text": "# Timeline of the Syrian civil war (2023)\n\nThe following is a timeline of the Syrian civil war for 2023. Information about aggregated casualty counts is found in Casualties of the Syrian civil war.\nOverview\nAs of 2023, active fighting in the conflict between the Syrian government and rebel groups had mostly subsided, but there were occasional flareups in Northwestern Syria. In early 2023, reports indicated that the forces of ISIS in Syria had mostly been defeated, with only a few cells remaining in various remote locations.\nAs of 2023, Turkey was continuing its support for various militias within Syria, which periodically attempted some operations against Kurdish groups. One stated goal was to create \"safe zones\" along Turkey's border with Syria, according to a statement by Turkish President Erdoğan. The operations were generally aimed at the Tal Rifaat and Manbij regions west of the Euphrates and other areas further east. President Erdoğan openly stated his support for the operations, in talks with Moscow in mid-2022.\nIn early 2023, Turkish-backed militias carried out military attacks against Kurdish militias, using tanks and artillery.\nIn March 2023, the Syrian government declared that it would not seek any reconciliation with Turkey, unless Turkey withdrew all of its proxy forces from Syria. This statement occurred in response to diplomatic efforts by Russia, which sought to encourage Syria and Turkey to seek reconciliation, and restoration of diplomatic ties.\nIn late March, Russia announced that it would host a summit which would include deputy foreign ministers from Russia, Syria, Iran, and Turkey.\nIn August 2023, renewed civil protests broke out across government-controlled regions of southern Syria.\nStalemate in civil conflict, renewed relations with Assad government\nIn early 2023, various sources reported that the conflict had settled into low-level conflict, which had mainly achieved a stalemate. One source stated:\nThe war whose brutality once dominated headlines has settled into an uncomfortable stalemate. Hopes for regime change have largely died out, peace talks have been fruitless, and some regional governments are reconsidering their opposition to engaging with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. The government has regained control of most of the country, and Assad’s hold on power seems secure. Meanwhile, the Syrian people are suffering an economic crisis, and a massive earthquake at the start of 2023 cast much of the population in the north into further despair.\nOne major NGO stated:\nTwelve years into Syria’s devastating civil war, the conflict appears to have settled into a frozen state. Although roughly 30% of the country is controlled by opposition forces, heavy fighting has largely ceased and there is a growing regional trending toward normalizing relations with the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Over the last decade, the conflict erupted into one of the most complicated in the world, with a dizzying array of international and regional powers, opposition groups, proxies, local militias and extremist groups all playing a role. The Syrian population has been brutalized, with nearly a half a million killed, 12 million fleeing their homes to find safety elsewhere, and widespread poverty and hunger. Meanwhile, efforts to broker a political settlement have gone nowhere, leaving the Assad regime firmly in power.\nConflict with Turkish forces\nIn 2023, the main military conflict was not between the Syrian government and rebels, but rather between Turkish forces and factions within Syria.
