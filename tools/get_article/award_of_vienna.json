Under the treaty, Great Britain recognized Nicaraguan sovereignty in name, but only under the express condition that Mosquitia retained full control over its internal government, laws, trade, and territory.\nThe treaty's provisions created an Imperium in Imperio (a sovereignty within a sovereignty)—a form of association between two sovereign entities sharing a limited external sovereignty but maintaining distinct internal independence. Mosquitia thus stood in the same legal relation to Nicaragua as Hungary did to Austria under the Ausgleich of 1867.\nMosquitia continued to govern itself through its own institutions, with a national council, judiciary, and established government at Bluefields, exercising all functions of sovereignty except the conduct of foreign relations.\nArbitration\nDisputes later arose over the scope of Nicaragua's authority, particularly regarding customs, trade, and the annuities owed to Mosquitia under the 1860 treaty. To resolve these issues, Great Britain and Nicaragua agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by Emperor Franz Joseph I, whose own realm exemplified a Real Union between two equal states.\nThe Emperor's appointment was accepted by both parties due to Austria-Hungary's impartiality and its constitutional experience in balancing dual sovereignty.\nFindings of the Award\nThe Award of Vienna reaffirmed that the Treaty of Managua did not create a relationship of subordination, but a union of two distinct political entities under a shared sovereignty of form, not substance. The Emperor's findings established that:\n# Mosquitia's autonomy was integral and perpetual.  The Emperor declared that Nicaragua's sovereignty was “not full and unlimited,” being bound by the treaty guarantees protecting Mosquitia's internal government.\n# Mosquitia's government exercised independent authority.  The Award confirmed that matters of administration, trade, and justice fell entirely under Mosquitian jurisdiction, excluding Nicaraguan interference.\n# Equality of symbols and emblems.  Both Mosquitia and Nicaragua were entitled to hoist their respective national flags, with the Mosquitian flag bearing an emblem denoting union—not subordination—within the Real Union of States.\n# Control of commerce and revenues.  The Emperor ruled that Nicaragua possessed no authority to grant concessions, impose taxes, or regulate trade in Mosquitia, as such rights belonged solely to the Mosquitian Government.\n# Financial compensation.  Nicaragua was ordered to pay Mosquitia US$30,859.03 for arrears in the annuities promised under the Treaty of Managua, recognizing Mosquitia's fiscal independence.\n# Free Port of Grey Town.  The status of Grey Town as a free port was upheld, reaffirming Mosquitia's historical right to open commerce and maritime autonomy.\nInterpretation and Significance\nThe Award of Vienna confirmed that Mosquitia remained a self-governing nation united with Nicaragua through a Real Union, not absorbed by it. The Emperor's decision placed Mosquitia on equal footing with Nicaragua in law, recognizing:\n* The continuing sovereignty of Mosquitia's institutions;\n* The conditional and limited nature of Nicaragua's sovereignty;\n* The binding and perpetual character of Mosquitia's autonomous status; and\n* The international personality of Mosquitia as a treaty party entitled to protection under the law of nations.\nBy affirming the Real Union model, the Award preserved Mosquitia's constitutional independence, defining it as a coequal member of a dual-state arrangement similar to Austria–Hungary.\nAftermath\nAlthough the Award settled the legal interpretation of the Treaty of Managua, tensions persisted as Nicaragua sought to consolidate territorial control. In 1894, under President José Santos Zelaya, Nicaraguan forces invaded and occupied Bluefields, dissolved the Mosquitian Government, and proclaimed the full incorporation of the territory as the Department of Zelaya.\nThis act was widely condemned as a violation of international law and an abrogation of the Real Union established by the Treaty of Managua and confirmed by the Award of Vienna. Mosquitian leaders protested that Nicaragua's unilateral annexation constituted a breach that dissolved the union and restored Mosquitia's independent sovereignty under the doctrine of reversion of rights.\nThe subsequent Harrison–Altamirano Treaty (1905), by which Britain and Nicaragua declared the old treaty “abrogated,” was never signed nor consented to by Mosquitia, rendering it inapplicable under the principle of state consent.\nReferences"
