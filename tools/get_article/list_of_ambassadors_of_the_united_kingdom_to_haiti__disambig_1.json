The British Embassy in Port-au-Prince was closed in 1966 \"for reasons of economy\" and the high commissioner to Jamaica in Kingston was appointed non-resident ambassador to Haiti. Responsibility for Haiti was transferred to the ambassador to the Dominican Republic in 1999. In June 2012 the British Foreign Secretary announced that the UK was to open a new embassy in Haiti. The new embassy was opened in June 2013, but until 2015 the ambassador to the Dominican Republic remained ambassador to Haiti, with a deputy head of mission in Port-au-Prince. In 2015 a new, dedicated ambassador was appointed to Haiti, but still non-resident (she was married to the ambassador to the Dominican Republic and resided in Santo Domingo). From 2019 until 2024, Mockbul Ali OBE served as both Ambassador to the Dominican Republic and non-resident Ambassador to Haiti.\nList of heads of mission\nConsuls-general to the Republic of Hayti\n* ? –1859: Thomas Ussher\nChargé d'affaires and Cconsuls-general to the Republic of Hayti\n*1859–1861: Thomas Ussher\n*1861–1872: Spenser St. John\nMinisters resident and consuls-general to the Republic of Hayti\n*1872–1874: Spenser St. John\n*1874–1883: Robert Stuart\nConsuls-general for the Republic of Hayti and its dependencies\n*1912–1913: Arthur Nightingale\nMinisters plenipotentiary to the Republic of Hayti\n*1913–1919: Stephen Leech\n*1919–1921: William Erskine\nConsuls-general to the Republic of Hayti\n*1921–1922: Godfrey Haggard\nConsuls for the Republic of Hayti\n*1935–1938 Francis M.
