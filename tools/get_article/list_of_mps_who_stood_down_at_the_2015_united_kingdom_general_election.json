While at the previous election there had been a record 149 MPs not standing for reelection, the 89 standing down in 2015 represented a more usual number. These 89 consist of 37 Labour, 37 Conservative, 10 Liberal Democrat, 3 Independent, 1 Sinn Féin and 1 Plaid Cymru MP. There were no vacant seats at dissolution.\nThe highest profile members of Parliament leaving were Gordon Brown, the former prime minister and leader of the Labour Party (both 2007 to 2010) and chancellor of the Exchequer (1997 to 2007); and William Hague, the outgoing First Secretary of State and leader of the House of Commons and former Foreign Secretary (2010 to 2014), leader of the Conservative Party and leader of the Opposition (both 1997 to 2001).\nAlongside Brown and Hague, seventeen former cabinet ministers stood down at the election, including Stephen Dorrell, Jack Straw, Alistair Darling, David Blunkett, Sir Peter Tapsell (the Father of the House having served continuously since the 1966 general election, in addition to his previous service), Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Dame Tessa Jowell, all of whom had served at least 23 years in the House of Commons. The highest profile Liberal Democrat to stand down was former leader Sir Menzies Campbell.\nList of MPs\nIn total, 89 members of parliament decided not to stand for re-election.\n{| class=\"wikitable
