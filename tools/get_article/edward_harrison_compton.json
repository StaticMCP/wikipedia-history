He received his early art training from his father, and after a period of study in London at the Central School of Arts and Crafts settled back in Bavaria.\nLike his father he was inspired by the Alps to become a mountain painter (\"Bergmaler\") working in both oils and watercolour. However, an attack of Polio at the age of 28 meant that he had to find more accessible landscapes to paint in Germany, England, northern Italy and Sicily. He also provided illustrations for several travel books published by A & C Black.\nCompton exhibited at galleries in Munich and Berlin, and also in England at the Royal Academy in London and in Bradford. He died in Feldafing in 1960.\nHe had two sisters, both of whom were artists: Marion Compton, the flowers and still-life painter, and Dora Keel-Compton, flower and mountain painter.\nPaintings (selected)\n*The Matterhorn\n*A mountainous landscape\n*Matterhorn\n*Summer Mountain (1905)\n*Sheep in a winter landscape (1905)\n*South Bavarian countryside with farmhouse near E.H.
