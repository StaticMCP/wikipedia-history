Originally, it was a memorial for the fallen British soldiers in World War I but later extended to include the Australian soldiers in World War II. The monument stands today in the city park of Kota Kinabalu, the capital of the Malaysian state of Sabah.\nHistory\nThe monument was erected on 8 May 1923, making it the oldest current monument in Sabah. It was intended to commemorate the deaths of 51 British soldiers. Following the Second World War, it was expanded to also commemorate 61 Australian soldiers. Following the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, the deaths of 61 Malaysian soldiers were also commemorated.\nThe monument was originally erected in Bond Street (now Gaya Street), and was later moved to Jalan Pantai (formerly Neil Malcolm Street). Due to the shifting of the KK City Park in the 1970s, the monument had undergone changes in form and height. In addition, the bronze plaque on the obelisk and a plaque at the site of previous gun were extended.\nOriginal shape\nThe monument originally consisted of an approximately  obelisk of granite and a cannon that were placed each on their own narrow rectangular base with semicircular ends. Both bases were mounted on a second common base.\nToday's form\nThe shape of the obelisk was not changed, but the original unit of the base plate is no longer given. The cannon base was placed about 3 metres from the obelisk, but without a gun. There is now a plaque instead of the gun.\nOriginal inscription\n]]\nThe original decoration included a carved in the stone relief in the form of a laurel wreath with the inscription, To The Glorious Dead 1914–1918 and a marble slab in the second pyramid stone. The marble plaque lists the names of 13 fallen of the First World War to:\n{|\n|style=\"width: 5em\"|\n|style=\"width:20em\"|\nROLL OF HONOUR\nM.T. Buckley\nA. Craigh\nH.W. Chalmers\nF.H.

The presence of  and a guard of honour, consisting the members of the Royal Navy, veterans of the First World War and the British North Borneo Armed Constabulary gave the event a military context. Among the guests were the Governor Sir William Rycroft, Admiral Arthur Leveson, the Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak and Ms Stotter. Bishop Danson dedicated the obelisk and made a speech of greetings on behalf from the representatives of the Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs, along with the speech from Sir Neill Malcolm.\nIn popular culture\nAs a remembering to the former site of the monument on Bond Street, an exhibition was held in 2012 with the theme \"Bonding with Gaya Street (BGS)\".\nAnnual commemorations are held at the monument on Anzac Day to honour the people recognised as having sacrificed themselves for Sabah in any conflict.\nPerhaps due to the establishment of the De Fontaine Memorial in 1912, the shape of the North Borneo War Memorial was very similar with it.\nGallery\nFile:KotaKinabalu Sabah NorthBorneoWarMemorial-1923-02.JPG|The monument in 1923\nFile:North Borneo War monument Second World War plaque.jpg|Bronze plaque commemorating the death of Australian soldiers during the Second World War\nFile:North Borneo War monument with Second World War plaque and Konfrontasi plaque.jpg|The two added plaques\nFile:North Borneo War monument and associated cannon base.jpg|The monument and cannon base following relocation from Gaya street\nReferences\nNotes"
