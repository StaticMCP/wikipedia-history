She has received numerous titles, decorations, and honorary appointments during her time first as the wife of the heir apparent and then as the consort of the sovereign.\nTitles and styles\nUpon marrying Charles, Prince of Wales, she was commonly styled \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall\". In Scotland she was known as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Rothesay\". Although Camilla was legally Princess of Wales, she adopted the feminine form of her husband's highest-ranking subsidiary title, Duke of Cornwall, because the title \"Princess of Wales\" had become strongly associated with Charles's first wife, Diana. She additionally bore the feminine version of her husband's other titles, including Countess of Chester, Countess of Carrick, Baroness of Renfrew, Lady of the Isles, and Princess of Scotland. In 2021, upon the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Charles inherited his father's titles, and Camilla thus became Duchess of Edinburgh.\nWhen Charles succeeded his mother, Elizabeth II, Camilla automatically became queen in accordance with English common law. Clarence House had however stated on the occasion of their wedding in 2005 that she would adopt the style of a princess consort instead of queen consort, but there is no legal or historical precedent for such a title. In Queen Elizabeth's 2022 Accession Day message, published to mark the 70th anniversary of her reign, she stated that it was her \"sincere wish\" for Camilla to be known as queen consort upon Charles's accession to the throne.\nPrior to her coronation, Camilla was styled \"Her Majesty The Queen Consort\", which distinguished her from the recently deceased Queen Elizabeth II. Since the coronation, Camilla has been styled \"Her Majesty The Queen\" or \"Her Majesty Queen Camilla\", consistent with past queens consort. In conversation, the correct etiquette is to address her initially as Your Majesty and thereafter as ''Ma'am'' (pronounced , with a short 'a' as in jam).\nCommonwealth honours\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Appointments from Commonwealth realms(shown in order in which appointments were made, not order of precedence)\n! scope=\"col\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Appointment\n! scope=\"col\"| Ribbon\n! scope=\"col\"| Post-nominalletters\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| 30 October 2007\n| Recipient of the Royal Family Order of Elizabeth II\n|\n|\n|-\n| 9 April 2012\n| Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order\n|\n| GCVO\n|-\n|\n| 3 November 2012\n| Companion of the Order of the Star of Melanesia\n|\n| CSM\n|-\n|\n| 9 June 2016\n| Member of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council\n|\n| PC\n|-\n|   England and Wales\n| 1 January 2022\n| Royal Lady of the Most Noble Order of the Garter\n|\n| LG\n|-\n|  New Zealand\n| 5 June 2023\n| Additional Member of the Order of New Zealand\n|\n| ONZ\n|-\n|\n| 16 June 2023\n| Extra Lady of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle\n|\n| LT\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| 23 April 2024\n| Grand Master and First and Principal Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire\n|\n| GBE\n|-\n| 25 June 2024\n| Recipient of the Royal Family Order of Charles III\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|26 May 2025\n|Member of the King's Privy Council for Canada\n|\n|PC (Can.)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; border:1px solid #005566; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|+Decorations and medals(shown in order in which appointments were made, not order of precedence)\n!
