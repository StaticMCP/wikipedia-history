Whittall & Co. This firm exported Turkish products to England, and was thus later absorbed by the Levant Company, a trading company that controlled and regulated trade between England and Turkey.\nPlaying career\nWhittall began playing football at Bournabat FC, which had been founded in Bornova in the late 1880s by several young merchants from the vast colony of Westerners living in Levant, specifically of British and French nationality, such as prominent members of the wealthy Whithall and La Fontaine families residing in Izmir; in fact, in Bournabat's first-ever recorded match in 1894, the club fielded several members of those families, including his uncle Herbert and his older brother Albert, who played a crucial role in helping Bournabat became the strongest team in Smyrna in the 1890s.\nIn 1904, Edward and his brother Albert started for a Smyrna XI in an inter-city match against Istanbul, helping their side to a 4–2 victory. This meant that football in Smyrna was the best one in the Ottoman Empire, hence why the Greeks invited a team from that region to participate in the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens. The team that represented Smyrna at the Olympics was entirely composed of players from Bournabat FC, half of whom were members of the Whittall family: Edward and his older brothers Albert and Godfrey, along with two cousins, Herbert and Donald, with the latter also participating in the rowing event. Aged 17 years and 352 days, he was not only the youngest player in the team, but also the youngest of the tournament. At the Olympics, Smyrna were knocked-out in the semifinals by a Copenhagen XI (5–1), who went on claim gold, but the withdrawal of the Athens team during the final and their subsequent disqualification meant that Smyrna and Thessaloniki would face each other for second place on 25 April 1906, in which the Whittalls, who formed a powerful attacking quintet, played a crucial role in helping their side to a 12–0 victory, thus winning the silver medal, which still is the greatest success of Izmir football in official matches.\nLater life and death\nWhittall married Dorothy Jane Peacock, with whom he had seven children, Iris Eveline (1914–2005), Dulcie Mary (1915–1917), Dorothy Marion (1917–2012), Monica Daisy (1918–1998), Edward James (1921–), Joan (1923), and Rosemary (1924). In June 1946, Whittall and his wife returned to England, where he died at Uxbridge on 13 June 1947, at the age of 59, thus becoming the first of the three Whittall brothers to pass away.\nHonours\n;Smyrna XI\n*Intercalated Games\n**Silver Silver medalists (1): 1906 (representing Smyrna XI)\nReferences"
