For the remainder of the war, she operated between northern ports and the gulf, stopping frequently en route to serve Union ships and bases along the Confederate coast.\nEnd-of-war decommissioning and sale\nAfter the war ended, Queen decommissioned at New York Navy Yard 21 June 1865 and was sold at New York City 16 October 1865 to Smith and Dunning.\nSee also\n*Union Blockade\nReferences"
