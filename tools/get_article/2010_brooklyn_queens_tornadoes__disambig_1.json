These tornadoes were the second and third to touch down in New York City that year, the first having occurred in the Bronx on July 25.\nSummary\nThe storms struck New York City just as the evening rush hour was beginning. Damaging winds, heavy downpours, and hail up to  wreaked havoc with the evening commute. Hundreds of downed trees led to a temporary suspension of service on the Long Island Rail Road, Amtrak, and several New York City Subway services including the , , and , leaving tens of thousands of commuters stranded.\nA woman was killed when a tree fell and crushed the vehicle she was driving. A man in Flushing was killed by a tree crashing into his home by Kissena Park. Extensive and widespread wind damage led to over 30,000 downed trees, and power lines. During the storm, winds tore trees out of the ground before blowing them up to  away. According to Con Edison, more than 25,000 customers lost power in Queens while 5,000 were without power in Staten Island. Four buildings across Brooklyn and Queens reported experiencing a partial collapse due to tornadic winds. The worst damage was concentrated in the neighborhoods of Middle Village, Forest Hills, and Bayside in Queens as well as Park Slope and Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn. Scattered power outages were reported across parts of the city.\nTwo separate tornadoes were later confirmed in Park Slope and Flushing, two areas that suffered the worst damage from the storms. The stronger of the two tornadoes touched down over Flushing and was rated an EF1 with maximum winds of 100&nbsp;mph. The tornado touched down in Flushing Meadows Corona Park and headed through Northeast Queens, dissipating over Little Neck Bay. The twister tore down the 150-year-old steeple of St. George's Church in downtown Flushing. In addition to the tornadoes, the National Weather Service confirmed the occurrence of a macroburst bringing winds up to  to a wide swath of Middle Village and Forest Hills. In Forest Hills, a group of trees were knocked over in MacDonald park, destroying the park and surroundings. Combined, the two tornadoes caused $25.7 million in damages.\nThese tornadoes were part of a small outbreak that produced several damaging tornadoes across the Midwest, especially in Ohio. An EF2 tornado caused severe damage, totaling $35 million, near Wooster, Ohio. Another strong EF3 tornado that destroyed numerous homes near Reedsville, Ohio and Belleville, West Virginia killed one person and injured several more.
