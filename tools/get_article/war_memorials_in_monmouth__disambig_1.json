Monmouth School has its own war memorial and the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers have a memorial at the Monmouth Castle on the parade grounds. One of the oldest memorials in Monmouth is the Naval Temple at the Kymin. All are Grade II listed buildings.\nNaval Temple\nThe Naval Temple at The Kymin was built in 1800 to celebrate Britain's victories during the French Revolutionary Wars and is in honour of sixteen Admirals. Its inscription reads:\nSt Mary's Church\nOn 7 August 1904 a memorial window in St Mary's Church in Monmouth was unveiled by Lord Tredegar to the memory of the men of the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers who lost their lives in the South African war.  The window was partly funded by the Militia and in part by the public.\nSt James Square\nThe Monmouth War Memorial in St James Square was unveiled on 6 October 1921. Former soldiers J. Jenkins and J.
