On completion, it was gifted to the Samoan government, which then leased it to the Samoa Shipping Corporation. Shortly after arriving in Samoa it damaged its propeller shaft in Apia harbour and had to be taken to Suva, Fiji for repairs. In September 1978 it added trips to Salelologa to its scheduled sailings to Pago Pago. Over its career it also sailed to Tokelau, Tonga, Niue, Rarotonga, Wallis and Futuna, Fiji, and New Zealand.\nIn February 1990 during Cyclone Ofa the ferry broke its moorings in Apia harbour and was washed ashore on the Apia waterfront. It was refloated in July 1990 and towed to Nelson, New Zealand for repairs. Increased maintenance costs and safety concerns following the repairs caused the Samoan government to ask the government of Japan to design and construct a replacement vessel.\nThe Queen Salamasina made its last trip for the SSC in January 1999 and was replaced on the Apia - Pago Pago route by the MV Lady Naomi. In November 1999 it was sold to Fijian company Patterson Brothers Shipping Company. It was renamed Island Navigator.\nReferences"
