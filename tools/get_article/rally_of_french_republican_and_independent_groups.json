The movement was highly diverse, encompassing socialists, Radicals, members of the Peasant Party, and former members of the Republican Party of Liberty (PRL) who were reluctant to join the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP), despite shared ideological leanings.\nThe movement's name highlighted its aim to attract a centrist electorate by referencing both the right-leaning Rally of Republican Lefts and the label \"Republican Independents,\" which was widely adopted by moderate notables after World War II.\nThe RGRIF succeeded in electing several deputies in both the 1951 and 1956 legislative elections. However, these deputies often dispersed among various parliamentary groups supporting the Third Force coalition. Many later joined the CNIP, the Union for the New Republic, or smaller groups such as the Republican Centre or the European Liberal Party led by Jean-Paul David, although one deputy elected under the banner, Paul Estèbe, was close to the overtly Petainist Union des nationaux indépendants et républicains.\nReferences\nSee also\n* French Fourth Republic\n* Radical Party (France)\n* National Centre of Independents and Peasants\n* André Liautey"
