      "text": "# 2015 Texas Revolution season\n\nThe 2015 Texas Revolution season was the team's sixteenth season as a professional indoor football franchise, third as the \"Texas Revolution\", and first as a member of Champions Indoor Football (CIF). One of nine teams in the CIF for the 2015 season, the Revolution played their home games at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas.\nThe Revolution played under the direction of head coach Devin Wyman. The team was led by first-year coach Wendell Davis from the start of the season until he was let go after four regular season games on March 30, 2014.\nSeason summary\nThe Revolution's announced schedule for the 2015 season was disrupted when the New Mexico Stars abruptly postponed their entry into the league on February 21, just one week before the season began. On March 3, the Albuquerque-based Duke City Gladiators were announced as a late entry into the league, partially replacing the Stars in the CIF schedule with a plan to play 11 games in 2015. The Gladiators' schedule has them visiting the Revolution twice, just as the Stars were supposed to, but replaces the road game originally scheduled at New Mexico with a visit to the Dodge City Law.\nOff-field moves\nThe Revolution earned a 3–11 record and missed the playoffs in 2014 under first-year head coach Chris Williams. In mid-July 2014, team president Tommy Benizio gave Williams a vote of confidence, expressing a need for \"consistency\" and declaring \"I completely believe in him.\" In late August 2014, the team released Williams and hired former Dallas Cowboys cornerback Wendell Davis as head coach and director of football operations. In late September 2014, the team announced the hiring of NFL veteran Larry Centers as running backs and linebackers coach.\nAt the end of August 2014, the Texas Revolution announced it was leaving the Indoor Football League for the new Champions Indoor Football league. The team's 2015 schedule begins with a pre-season home game on February 27 and two regular season road games before the home opener on March 20. Team officials cited the new league's potential for both growth and stability as well as a flexible salary cap among the reasons for joining the CIF.\nOn February 12, 2015, the team introduced former Revolution running back Jennifer Welter as their new linebackers and special teams coach. Welter is the first woman to coach in a men's professional football league.\nOn March 30, 2015, the Revolution released head coach Wendell Davis and named defensive coordinator Devin Wyman as his replacement. The team cited the desire of general manager Tim Brown to \"take a more active role with the coaching staff\" as the reason for Davis' release. Two weeks later, Davis was named head coach of the San Angelo Bandits and his first game was a win over the Revolution.\nOn April 3, 2015, the team added NFL veteran Terry Glenn to the coaching staff as offensive coordinator.\nRoster moves\nOff-season\nLeading up to the 2015 season, D1 Sports Training in Dallas served as the team's new performance training facility. On October 4, 2014, the team held its first open tryout for players at D1. A second open tryout was held January 3, 2015, at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas.\nOn September 11, 2014, the team signed kicker Garrett Palmer. On September 23, the team announced that it had re-signed defensive lineman Jason Sutherland and offensive lineman DJ Brandel as well as signing defensive end Robert Williams Jr. On September 30, the Revolution signed fullback Keidrick Jackson and linebacker Rashad Washington while releasing offensive lineman Xavier Pete and defensive back C.J. Wilson. On October 1, the Revs announced that All-IFL cornerback/wide receiver Frankie Solomon Jr. had re-signed for the 2015 season.\nOn October 6, the team signed offensive lineman Michael Wormley plus wide receivers Derrick Herman and DeMarcus Jenkins. On October 7, the Revolution signed defensive backs Brandon Henderson Sr. and Phillip Benning, offensive lineman Kameron Young, and quarterback Robert Kent Jr. On the same day, they released offensive lineman D.J. Brandel and running back Jordan Brown RB. On October 10, the team signed wide receivers/defensive backs Jeff Willis and A-Vel McLamb. On October 17, the Revolution signed running back Darius Fudge and linebacker Deamario Dixon.\nOn October 27, the team signed defensive backs Emmanuel Souarin, Thailand Pierce, and Levar Hart, quarterback Luke Halpin, defensive lineman Jeremiah Fennell, and linebacker Grail Brewster. On November 4, the team signed offensive lineman Roy Richard plus wide receivers Joshua Reid and Brett Reece Jr. while releasing quarterback Damian Danning. On November 18, the Revolution signed defensive lineman Zane Brown and released defensive lineman Godwin Ubah. On December 10, the team signed offensive lineman Robert Griffin. On January 14, 2015, the team signed linebacker Roger Stewart LB while releasing defensive lineman Rodney Johnson.\nPre-season\nAs the final roster was being assembled prior to the team's pre-season game against the North Texas Crunch, the Revolution released linebacker Bryan Iwuji, defensive lineman E.J. Nduka, and wide receivers Derrick Herman, Garrett Tidwell, and Jahmal Coleman on February 23. On the same day, the team signed defensive end Jason Sutherland, defensive backs Brian Jackson and Anthony Webb, and running back Corey Austin RB. On February 24, the team signed defensive lineman Dustin Sherer plus wide receivers Ed Young and Will Cole Jr.\nAwards and honors\nEach week of the regular season, the CIF named league-wide Players of the Week in offensive, defensive, and special teams categories. For Week 4, the CIF named defensive linesman DeMario Dixon as the Defensive Player of the Week. For Week 5, the CIF named kick returner Frankie Solomon Jr. as the Special Teams Player of the Week. The league cited Solomon's 8 kickoff returns for 121 yards in the loss to the Dodge City Law among the factors for the honor. For Week 6, the CIF named wide receiver Brett Reese Jr. as the Offensive Player of the Week.\nFor Week 8, the CIF named defensive lineman Robert Williams as the Defensive Player of the Week. For Week 9, the CIF named quarterback Robert Kent as the Offensive Player of the Week. For Week 12, the CIF named defensive lineman Taylor McCuller as the Defensive Player of the Week. For Week 13, the CIF again named quarterback Robert Kent as the Offensive Player of the Week.\nOn June 6, the CIF announced the winners of its year-end awards. The Texas Revolution were honored for Dance Team of the Year and Community Relations of the Year, defensive lineman DeMario Dixon was named Defensive Player of the Year, and defensive lineman Robert Williams was named Rookie of the Year.\nSchedule\nKey:\nPre-season\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\"  | Week\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\"  | Day\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\"  | Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\"  | Kickoff\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" | Opponent\n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\" | Location\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Attendance\n|-\n! width=\"130\" | Score\n! width=\"60\"  | Record\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 1\n| Friday\n| February 27\n| 7:00pm\n| North Texas Crunch (NAIFL)\n| W 61–19\n| 1–0\n| Allen Event Center\n| NA\n|}\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\"  | Week\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\"  | Day\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\"  | Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\"  | Kickoff\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" | Opponent\n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\" | Location\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Attendance\n|-\n! width=\"130\" | Score\n! width=\"60\"  | Record\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"\n! 1\n| Saturday\n| March 7\n| 7:00pm\n| at Salina Bombers\n| L 27–34\n| 0–1\n| Bicentennial Center\n| 2,100\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 2\n| Saturday\n| March 14\n| 7:00pm\n| at San Angelo Bandits\n| W 42–36\n| 1–1\n| Foster Communications Coliseum\n| 2,200\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 3\n| Friday\n| March 20\n| 7:05pm\n| Duke City Gladiators\n| W 56–16\n| 2–1\n| Allen Event Center\n| 3,403\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"\n! 4\n| Saturday\n| March 28\n| 7:00pm\n| at Dodge City Law\n| L 52–55\n| 2–2\n| United Wireless Arena\n| 3,116\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 5\n| Saturday\n| April 4\n| 7:05pm\n| Amarillo Venom\n| W 51–27\n| 3–2\n| Allen Event Center\n| 3,423\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 6\n| Saturday\n| April 11\n| 7:05pm\n| Wichita Force\n| W 48–21\n| 4–2\n| Allen Event Center\n| 3,556\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"\n! 7\n| Saturday\n| April 18\n| 7:05pm\n| at San Angelo Bandits\n| L 38–42\n| 4–3\n| Foster Communications Coliseum\n| NA\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 8\n| Friday\n| April 24\n| 7:05pm\n| San Angelo Bandits\n| W 83–31\n| 5–3\n| Allen Event Center\n| 3,673\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"\n! 9\n| Saturday\n| May 2\n| 7:00pm\n| at Amarillo Venom\n| L 45–55\n| 5–4\n| Amarillo Civic Center\n| NA\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! 10\n| colSpan=7 | BYE\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 11\n| Saturday\n| May 16\n| 7:05pm\n| San Angelo Bandits\n| W 78–48\n| 6–4\n| Allen Event Center\n| 4,124\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 12\n| Saturday\n| May 23\n| 7:00pm\n| at Amarillo Venom\n| W 64–61\n| 7–4\n| Amarillo Civic Center\n| NA\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n! 13\n| Friday\n| May 29\n| 7:05pm\n| Duke City Gladiators\n| W 54–49\n| 8–4\n| Allen Event Center\n| 4,381\n|}\nRescheduled after the New Mexico Stars withdrew from the league on February 22, 2015.\nPostseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"130\" | Round\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"75\"  | Day\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"75\"  | Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\"  | Kickoff\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent\n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Attendance\n|-\n! width=\"130\" | Score\n! width=\"60\"  | Record\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"\n!
