The marble monument depicts a Confederate Army soldier standing in mid stride with his left foot forward.  His right hand holds the barrel of a rifle, whose butt rests on the monument base.  He carries a bedroll draped over his left shoulder, and wears a Confederate cap.  A cannon that served as a fountain was once part of the sculpture, but is now missing.  The statue is about  high and  square; it rests on a marble foundation that is  long,  wide, and  high.  The monument was erected in 1910 by two chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy at a cost of about $3,000.\nThe base has inscriptions on its east and west faces.  The east face, or rear, reads \"Erected by the / Captain McConnell / and / George K. Cracraft / Chapters, U.D.C. / A.D. 1910 / And Chicot County\" / \"We care not whence / They came, / Dear, in lifeless clay / Whether unknown or known to fame / Their cause and country still the same / They died and wore the gray. / Father Ryan.\"  The west face, or front, reads \"1861-1865 CSA / To the Confederate soldiers of Chicot / County, the record of whose sublime / Self sacrifice and undying devotion / Is the proud heritage / Of a loyal posterity.\"\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Chicot County, Arkansas\nReferences"
