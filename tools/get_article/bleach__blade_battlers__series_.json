      "text": "# Bleach: Blade Battlers (series)\n\nCover art to Bleach: Blade Battlers\nis a series of fighting games released only in Japan for the PlayStation 2 based on the manga and anime Bleach by Tite Kubo. There are two games in the series, both developed by Racjin and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Both games became best-sellers in Japan.\nGameplay\nIn the Blade Battlers series, the player takes control of one of many characters from the source material. As with most other fighting games, the idea is to fight the opposing character, or characters in the free-for-all mode, until their health is fully depleted. Players can use their characters' special abilities taken from the series, such as Ichigo Kurosaki's ability to unlock his bankai state or Rukia Kuchiki's control over ice with her zanpakutō. Some of these abilities may alter the arena, such as Rukia's zanpakutō causing the battlefield to become covered in ice and making other players slide around.\nIn Blade Battlers 2, specials attacks have been changed into special forms, resulting in the altering of area obstacles such as random attacks from summonings, shifting the area, etc.\nBoth games feature extensive battle modes, where the players can unlock characters after beating all of the challenges. Some missions have players to perform under certain circumstances, like a time limit. In both games there is a bonus section where the players can view character models and extras.\nHistory\nBleach: Blade Battlers\nBleach Blade Battlers is the first installment of the Blade Battlers series and was released in Japan on October 12, 2006.
