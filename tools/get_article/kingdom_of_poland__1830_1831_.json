It was not a new political creation, but only a new concept of the existence of the state, which stated, among other things,  breaking away from any dependence on the Russian Empire and its emperor.\nTemporary regime\nThe Kingdom of Poland retained the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland (1815) with the exception of the articles binding the Kingdom with the Russian Empire through the person of the emperor-king.  The political system of the Kingdom of Poland changed as a result of the resolutions of the insurgent Sejm, meeting in the conditions of an open Polish-Russian war.\nThe legal acts that formed the basis for the functioning of the new Polish authorities were: the Sejm resolution of December 18, 1830, recognizing the uprising as national  and declared the establishment of the National Government on January 29, 1831, resolution on the homage to the Polish nation of February 8, 1831.\nCountry symbols\nOn February 7, 1831, the Chamber of Deputies of the insurrectionary Sejm, by a majority of votes, adopted white and red cockade as the national color, accepting the argument of the MP Walenty Zwierkowski that the coat of arms of Poland represents White Eagle in a red field. This project was unanimously supported by the Senate and implemented on the same day.\nSee also\n* November Uprising\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Poland's history in numbers.  Population.
