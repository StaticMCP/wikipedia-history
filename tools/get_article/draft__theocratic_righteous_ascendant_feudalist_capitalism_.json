It emphasizes divine law as the foundation of governance, where a monarch—chosen by religious authorities—rules alongside nobles and clergy who uphold Christian ethics.\nThe ideology supports a structured society with clear social classes, yet allows for social mobility through merit, service, and economic success, embodying the \"Doctrine of Righteous Ascent.\" It recognizes only two genders and holds traditional views on family and gender roles, with motherhood and wifehood prioritized for women.\nEconomically, it promotes a free market with no income tax, relying instead on property and usage-based taxes, and limits government aid to those genuinely in need, encouraging private charity. The military is strong and loyal, serving the nation unless the ruler violates their sacred duty.\nEducation is unified and inclusive, teaching religious values in a secular framework alongside practical skills. The arts and culture are encouraged but must align with Christian morals, avoiding explicit content. Foreign policy prioritizes national sovereignty, legal immigration, and strategic alliances.\nOverall, this ideology seeks to balance faith, order, liberty, and merit, fostering a society rooted in Christian virtues, social hierarchy, and economic freedom.\nReferences"
