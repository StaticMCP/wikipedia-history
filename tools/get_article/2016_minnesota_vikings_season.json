After starting the season with five consecutive wins prior to their bye week, the Vikings managed just three victories after the bye and were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 16 with a 38–25 road loss to the Packers. They joined the 1978 Redskins, 1993 Saints, 2003 Vikings, 2009 Broncos, 2009 Giants and 2015 Falcons in missing the playoffs after starting 5–0 or better. The Vikings are the only NFL team to have more than once started 5–0 or better and missed the playoffs.\nThe team's new stadium, U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, opened at the start of the season, with a regular season debut victory on September 18 against division rival Green Bay on NBC Sunday Night Football. It was built on the site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the team's home from 1982 through 2013. The Vikings played at the outdoor TCF Bank Stadium at the University of Minnesota in 2014 and 2015. This would be the season the Vikings introduced their color rush jersey, the Minnesota Vikings debuted the Jerseys at home against Dallas.\nOn August 30, starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater suffered a season-ending ACL tear and dislocated knee on a non-contact play during team practice. Originally, it was reported that Bridgewater's injury would keep him out for around a year and a half, and on January 27, 2017, it was reported that it was possible he could also miss the entire 2017 season. The extent of Bridgewater's injury prompted the Vikings to make a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles for former number 1 draft pick Sam Bradford, giving up a first-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft and a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2018 Draft in exchange. Adrian Peterson's season was also hit by injury after he tore the meniscus in his right knee in the home opener against the Packers. On September 22, Peterson underwent successful surgery to repair the meniscus. It was also revealed that the knee had a mild LCL sprain, but it did not need surgery. He was placed on injured reserve on September 23, 2016, and reactivated on December 17, but only made six rushing attempts before leaving the game, ending his season. Peterson left the team at the end of the season, ending his 10-year tenure with the Vikings.\nOffseason\n2016 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"8\" style=\"\"| 2016 Minnesota Vikings draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1 || 23\n| Laquon Treadwell || WR || Ole Miss || 4 years / $9.93&nbsp;million ||\n|-\n! 2 || 54\n| Mackensie Alexander || CB || Clemson || 4 years / $4.3&nbsp;million ||\n|-\n! 3 || 86\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Miami Dolphins}} ||\n|-\n! 4 || 121\n| Willie Beavers || G || Western Michigan || 4 years / $2.88&nbsp;million ||\n|-\n! 5 || 160\n| Kentrell Brothers || LB || Missouri || 4 years / $2.57&nbsp;million ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"5\"| 6 || 180\n| Moritz Böhringer || WR || None || 4 years / $2.49&nbsp;million || from 49ers}}\n|-\n! 186\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Miami Dolphins}} || from Dolphins\n|-\n! 188\n| David Morgan II || TE || UTSA || 4 years / $2.47&nbsp;million || from Eagles}}\n|-\n! 196\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles || from Texans via Patriots and Dolphins\n|-\n! 198\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the San Diego Chargers}} ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 7 || 227\n| Stephen Weatherly || LB || Vanderbilt || 4 years / $2.42&nbsp;million || from Ravens via Dolphins\n|-\n! 240\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles || from Bills}}\n|-\n! 244\n| Jayron Kearse || S || Clemson || 4 years / $2.4&nbsp;million ||\n|}\nDraft trades\nRoster changes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Re-signings\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Player name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Contract terms\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| March 7, 2016 || Andrew Sendejo || S || 4 years / $16&nbsp;million\n|-\n| Adam Thielen || WR || 1 year / $600,000\n|-\n| March 8, 2016 || Audie Cole || LB || 1 year / $760,000\n|-\n| March 9, 2016 || Mike Harris || G || 1 year / $1.9&nbsp;million\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| March 15, 2016 || Rhett Ellison || TE || 1 year / $2.25&nbsp;million\n|-\n| Marcus Sherels || CB || 2 years / $4&nbsp;million\n|-\n| March 16, 2016 || Matt Asiata || RB || 1 year / $840,000\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| March 18, 2016 || Terence Newman || CB || 1 year / $3&nbsp;million\n|-\n| Justin Trattou || DE || 1 year / $810,000\n|-\n| April 11, 2016 || Chad Greenway || LB || 1 year / $2.75&nbsp;million\n|-\n| April 18, 2016 || Zach Line || FB || 1 year / $1.671&nbsp;million\n|-\n| September 9, 2016 || Joe Berger || C || 1-year extension\n|}\nDenotes this is a reserve/future contract.\n:Denotes a signing to the practice squad.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Departures\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Player name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Note\n!style=\"\"| New team\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| March 8, 2016 || Mike Wallace || WR || Released || Baltimore Ravens\n|-\n| Austin Wentworth || OT || Waived || Retired\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| March 9, 2016 || Casey Matthews || ILB || UFA ||\n|-\n| Jason Trusnik || ILB || UFA ||\n|-\n| March 14, 2016 || Josh Robinson || CB || UFA || Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n|-\n| March 18, 2016 || Robert Blanton || S || UFA || Buffalo Bills\n|-\n| April 13, 2016 || Alex Singleton || LB || Waived || Calgary Stampeders (CFL)\n|-\n| May 10, 2016 || Johnny Lowdermilk || S || Waived || Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n|-\n| July 25, 2016 || Phil Loadholt || OT || Waived || Retired\n|-\n| August 25, 2016 || Melvin White || CB || Waived ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"| August 30, 2016 || Brad Sorensen || QB || rowspan=\"7\"| Waived ||\n|-\n| Terrell Sinkfield || WR ||\n|-\n| Austin Shepherd || OT ||\n|-\n| John Sullivan || C ||\n|-\n| Scott Crichton || DL ||\n|-\n| Antone Exum || S ||\n|-\n| Zach Moore || DE ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"| September 3, 2016 || C.
