It described battles of the American Civil War in a graphic, realistic level. Veteran voice actor Tony Jay served as narrator.\nHistorical reenactment was used to visualize the events.\nOne of the objectives of the series was to associate people with lesser known regiments and commands. Another one was to provide little known facts of the fields of conflict and to also give an accurate portrayal of the bloodiness of the fighting of the day.\nEpisodes\n{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style=\"line-height:130%\n|S01E01\n|The Wheatfield at Gettysburg\n|Battle of Gettysburg\n|-\n|S01E02\n|The Bloody Lane at Antietam\n|Battle of Antietam\n|-\n|S01E03\n|The Hornets Nest at Shiloh\n|Battle of Shiloh\n|-\n|S01E04\n|The Tragedy at Cold Harbor\n|Battle of Cold Harbor\n|-\n|S02E01\n|The Battle of First Manassas\n|First Battle of Bull Run\n|-\n|S02E02\n|The Battle of Fredericksburg\n|Battle of Fredericksburg\n|-\n|S02E03\n|The Battle of Chancellorsville\n|Battle of Chancellorsville\n|-\n|S02E04\n|Little Round Top at Gettysburg\n|Battle of Gettysburg\n|-\n|S03E01\n|Culp's Hill at Gettysburg\n|Battle of Gettysburg\n|-\n|S03E02\n|The Battle of Chickamauga\n|Battle of Chickamauga\n|-\n|S03E03\n|The Crater at Petersburg\n|Battle of the Crater at Petersburg.\n|-\n|S03E04\n|The Battle of Franklin\n|Battle of Franklin\n|}\nSee also\n* List of films and television shows about the American Civil War\nReferences\n*https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275265/episodes/?season=1 / ..2 / ..3"
