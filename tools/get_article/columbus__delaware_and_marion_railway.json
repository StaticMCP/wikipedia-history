It operated service to Bucyrus through the Delaware, Marion and Bucyrus Railroad on an additional  of track. At Bucyrus the railway met the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway for connecting service to Cleveland.\nThe CD&M also generated electricity for Marion and sold power to the Middle West Utilities System. As a means of increasing off hours riders, the company developed Glenmary Park north of Worthington to attract interurban passengers with playing fields and picnic areas, and provided partial funding for Crystal Lake Amusement Park north of Marion, Ohio.\nHistory\noutside Delaware]]\nThe Columbus, Delaware, and Marion Railway was formed in 1901 to establish interurban service north of Columbus, Ohio. The CD&M Railway purchased the Columbus, Clinton and Worthington Street Railway. At the same time, a rival company, the Columbus, Delaware and Northern Railroad, acquired a right-of-way between Columbus and Marion. The CD&M Railway bought its rival and the railroad began interurban service in 1903. In October 1904, the CD&M incorporated as a holding company operating through its subsidiary the Columbus, Delaware, and Marion Electric Railroad.\nIn 1908, the company built the Columbus, Marion, and Bucyrus Railway to connect Columbus to the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway at Bucyrus with plans for service to Cleveland, Sandusky, and Toledo.\nThe Columbus Marion and Bucyrus operated passenger service from Columbus to Bucyrus and nightly through freight service between Columbus and Cleveland.\nIn 1909, both the CD&M Railway Company and its Bucyrus subsidiary went bankrupt. The Columbus, Marion and Bucyrus emerged from bankruptcy in 1914, and in 1917, the CD&M was reorganized as the Columbus, Delaware and Marion Electric Company.\nDecline and abandonment\nThe Columbus, Marion and Bucyrus Railway lost money during the late 1920s. The railway went bankrupt in 1930 and was absorbed into Columbus, Delaware, and Marion in 1931.\nIn 1931, the Cleveland, Southwestern and Columbus Railway abandoned its rail lines, causing the CD&M to lose revenue from its Cleveland freight service in 1933\nThe company filed for bankruptcy in March 1933 and abandoned rail passenger service in August 1933. Passenger rail was replaced by bus service.\nThe CD&M Electric Company was merged with the Reserve Power Company to form Marion-Reserve Power Company in 1937.\nThe Ohio Railway Museum in Worthington operates on about one mile of former Columbus, Delaware and Marion right-of-way. The museum's collection includes a preserved CD&M parlor car numbered 501. Until 1969, another  segment of CD&M track, leading to a power plant, was used in Marion.\nBeginning in 2006, the Marion County Park District was working to establish a trail along the abandoned right of way.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=107345833232291965917.00047bb9190fc8cd63ad8&ct=docsearch&cd=3&cad=docsearch,cid:2476985489086755393 CD&M Route Map] at Google Maps.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080302174822/http://davesrailpix.com/odds/oh/oh1.htm Columbus, Delaware and Marion photos] at davesrailpix.com\n*[http://www.columbusrailroads.com/CD&M.htm Columbus Railroads: Interurban Railroads] at columbusrailroads.com"
