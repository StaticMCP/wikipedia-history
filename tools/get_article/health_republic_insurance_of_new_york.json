Health Republic began selling insurance plans to individuals and small groups, both on and off the NY State of Health marketplace, in October 2013.\nDuring the 2013-2014 Open Enrollment period, Health Republic captured the largest marketshare on the New York State of Health marketplace. It became the largest CO-OP in the country during this period.\nIn September 2014, Health Republic members were able to vote for Member Directors on the CO-OP's Board of Directors, with nine members ultimately elected from across the state, making up a majority of the Board.\nFor 2015, Health Republic expanded its service area by 11 counties upstate to a total of 43 counties statewide; added two new products: an out-of-network plan for small groups and a higher-deductible plan for individuals; and expanded its provider network in the Albany area\nOn September 27, 2015, Health Republic announced that it would begin the processes of ceasing operations, effective immediately.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://healthrepublicny.org/ Official Website]"
