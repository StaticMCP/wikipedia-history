Soon after its founding, Dancis’ former FullContact colleague Steve Schoeffel joined the company as co-founder.\nIn its early days, Whimsical offered simple flowcharts, followed by wireframes and mind maps, and its emphasis on design clarity and ease of collaboration quickly attracted product teams and creative professionals worldwide.\nGrowth and Investment (2021–2024)\nIn 2021, Whimsical raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Accel to accelerate product development and expand its reach. By then, it had grown to a couple of million users. Prior to this, the company had been entirely bootstrapped and profitable since its early days. Accel partner Dan Levine, who joined Whimsical’s board, described the company as offering a foundational product for remote-first teams, comparing it to tools like Figma and Notion in its focus on speed and simplicity.\nTransition to an All-in-One Platform (2025–present)\nIn February 2025, Whimsical launched **Projects**, completing its “all-in-one” offering for ideation, planning, execution, and communication. This milestone reinforced Whimsical’s commitment to asynchronous, calm work by integrating ideas, documents, boards, and tasks into a single, interconnected space.\nTechnology\nWhimsical is written in the Clojure programming language. The company has been recognized within the Clojure community for its large-scale, production use of the language, often cited as an example of how functional programming principles can be applied to build complex, collaborative web applications. Whimsical’s engineering team has contributed to open-source Clojure projects and has participated in community events, reinforcing its commitment to the language’s ecosystem.\nSustainability\nSince 2020, Whimsical has partnered with Stripe, Inc. to donate 1% of its annual revenue to scientifically vetted carbon-removal technologies, integrating sustainability into its business model.\nWhimsical has contributed over $50,000 through this program, financially backing its environmental commitment while focusing on building its product.\nReferences"
