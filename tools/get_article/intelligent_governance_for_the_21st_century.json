In particular, it examines affinities of Western classical and Enlightenment thinkers with Confucian precepts.\n*Chapter 4: \"The New Challenges for Governance: Social Networks, Megacities, and the Global Scattering of Productive Capabilities\" brings older governance debates into the 21st century.\n*Chapter 5: \"Intelligent Governance: Tenets and Template\" is an exercise in political imagination that proposes an institutional design for a middle way between West and East.\n*Chapter 6: \"Rebooting California's Dysfunctional Democracy\" describes the Berggruen Institute on Governance's work to find ways for of the American state of California to redesign its government in order to escape from legislative gridlock and chronic fiscal weakness.\n*Chapter 7: \"The G-20: Global Governance from Summits to Subnational Networks\" shows the Berggruen Institute on Governance's efforts to make the Group of 20 more effective.\n*Chapter 8: \"Europe: Political Union and the Democratic Deficit\" describes how the Berggruen Institute on Governance has encouraged the European Union toward closer political and fiscal unity.\nThe book's conclusion, \"Survival of the Wisest\", argues that wisdom and long-term thinking combined to democratic legitimacy is the right political combination for success in a globalized world.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://intelligentgov.com Official US website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131104232016/http://gobernanzainteligente.com/ Spanish website]\n* [http://berggruen.org Berggruen Institute on Governance Official website]"
