His mother was a homemaker and his father a U.S. Army officer. Battle's talent became apparent at the age of nine. After three years of studying ballet at the Jones-Haywood School of Ballet, he received a scholarship to The School of American Ballet where he studied until the age of fifteen under George Balanchine.\nCareer\nOn October 21, 1974, the new musical The Wiz opened at the Morris A.

On Quantum Leap, he played Thames, the evil Observer from the future, in the final installment of the Evil Leaper trilogy of episodes.\nBattle played the role of the Cat in the first U.S. pilot for science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, based on the British show of the same name. Notably, he guest-starred as Sweet the jazz demon, in \"Once More, with Feeling\", Buffy The Vampire Slayers musical episode in which his spell forces the characters to sing their biggest secrets and fears.\nBattle's other Broadway starring roles included Dancin', Dreamgirls, Sophisticated Ladies for which he won his first Tony Award, Chicago (Billy Flynn), and Ragtime (Coalhouse Walker Jr.), which garnered rave reviews from the Chicago press and earned him an Ira Aldridge Award.

He won his third Tony Award for Miss Saigon (1991) playing the role of John Thomas.  He sang the riveting \"Bui Doi\", one of the feature songs.\nBattle's long list of television credits included Shine, his one-man show presented at the HBO Aspen Comedy Arts Festival; The Kennedy Center's 25th Anniversary; These Old Broads, co-starring Shirley MacLaine, Joan Collins, Debbie Reynolds, and Elizabeth Taylor; and ABC/Disney's Child Star: The Shirley Temple Story where Hinton served as a choreographer and co-star playing Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson.\nAs a choreographer, Battle's work has been seen on the musical episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, \"Once More, with Feeling\", These Old Broads, Foreign Student (with Charles Dutton), The Golden Globe Awards, Dance in America; the sitcoms Fired Up, Sister, Sister, The Trouble with Normal, and The Boys.
