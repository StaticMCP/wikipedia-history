After more than a week of joint operations and handover activities, Padalka and Fincke officially took command of the Station on 29 April when Expedition 8 Commander Michael Foale and Flight Engineer Alexander Kaleri left the Station. This mission was the site for the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Project.\nExpedition 8 and Kuipers returned to Earth that same day aboard the Soyuz TMA-3 spacecraft. Kuipers' 11-day mission to the ISS was part of a commercial agreement between ESA and the Federal Space Agency of Russia.\nSpacewalks\nThe Expedition 9 crew conducted four spacewalks during its stay at the International Space Station. The four spacewalks were devoted to ISS maintenance and assembly. All four were based out of the Pirs Docking Compartment and used Russian Orlan spacesuits.\nBefore these four extravehicular activities (EVAs), 52 spacewalks had been performed at the ISS, with 27 based out of the Station.\nGennady Padalka (EV1): red stripes\nMike Fincke (EV2): blue stripes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"10%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Mission\n! width=\"20%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Spacewalkers\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Start (UTC)\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|End (UTC)\n! width=\"12%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Duration\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 9EVA 1\n| Gennady Padalka  Mike Fincke\n| 24 June 2004  21:56\n| 24 June 2004  22:10\n| 14 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|The spacewalk was cut short due to a pressure problem in Fincke's prime oxygen tank in his spacesuit.

A failed Remote Power Controller Module was responsible for the temporary loss of CMG 2 in April. The gyroscope is one of four that control the ISS' orientation.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 9EVA 3\n| Gennady Padalka  Mike Fincke\n| 3 August 2004  06:58\n| 3 August 2004  11:28\n| 4 hours 30 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|In preparation for the arrival of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), Padalka and Fincke removed laser retro reflectors from the Zvezda Service Module assembly compartment and installed three updated laser retro reflectors and one internal videometer target. They installed two antennas.\nThe spacewalkers removed Kromka Panel No. 2 and installed Kromka Panel No. 3. The Kromka experiment exposes various materials to the space environment. They also replaced another materials science experiment.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 9EVA 4\n| Gennady Padalka  Mike Fincke\n| 3 September 2004  16:43\n| 3 September 2004  22:04\n| 5 hours 20 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 9's fourth scheduled EVA prepared the Station for future assembly operations and the arrival of the ATV. The spacewalkers replaced the Zarya Control Module flow control panel and installed four safety tether fairleads on Zarya's handrails.\nATV support operations included installing equipment for the air-to-air radio link antennas and removing all covers from antennas.\nOther tasks included installing a Pressure Control and Exposure Monitor Sensor on Pirs and installing protective components on the brackets of Pirs' ring handrails on EVA Hatch No. 2.\n|}\nMission patch\nThe design of the Expedition 9 mission patch includes a tribute to astronauts and cosmonauts who gave their lives in space exploration. The outspread wings of the eagle have 16 stars and 1 star of David. They represent the Apollo 1 crew Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. Space Shuttle Challenger STS-51L crew Dick Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik and Christa McAuliffe. Space Shuttle Columbia STS-107 crew Rick Husband, William C. McCool, David M. Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Michael P. Anderson, Laurel Clark and Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli astronaut. Around the eagles neck are 4 small red stars and one larger red star. The large star is for Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space during Vostok 1, who was killed during training for Soyuz 3. The other 4 are for Soyuz 1 cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov, Soyuz 11 crew Georgi Dobrovolski, Viktor Patsayev and Vladislav Volkov.\nReferences\nExternal links"
