The temple was built on the banks of the Musi river in . It was commissioned by Erakasani, the wife of Bēti Reddi of the Recherla family, who were feudatories of Kakatiyas. The Erakeswara Temple is one among the four prominent and intricately carved stone and granite temples located in Pillalamarri—the other three are about 250 metres east of the Erakeswara temple. These include the double temples next to each other: Nameswara Temple and Trikuteswara Temple (both Shaivite temples); and the third being the Chennakesava Temple (Vishnu) in ruins that is a few hundred feet southwest of the double temples. They are all from 12th to early 13th century period.\nLocation\nPillalamarri is 8 kilometres northwest of Suryapet, off National Highway 65. Suryapet is 153 kilometres away from Hyderabad on the National Highway 65.\nHistory\nThe temple was built in the early 13th century (c. 12031208 CE) by the Recherla chiefs, who served as feudatories of Kakatiyas. One inscription notes that Erakasani, the wife of Bēti Reddi of the Recherla family, commissioned the construction of the temple in 1208 CE in Pillalamarri. The deity Erakeswara is named after her, meaning \"lord of Eraka.\" The temple was vandalised during the raids of Alauddin Khilji into the Deccan region in the early 14th century. An inscription dated to 1357 CE records the re-establishment of Lord Erakeswara by a local feudatory chief serving Kapaya Nayaka of Musunuri Nayaka dynasty.\nProminent stone inscriptions in Telugu about the history of the temple and of Pillalamarri are displayed in the temple premises. One of the stone inscriptions is dated to 1195 CE (Saka. 1117) and mentions the rule of Pratapa Rudra I. Another stone inscription dates to 1208 CE (Saka. 1130) and makes a reference to the reign of Ganapati Deva.\nOne of the earliest archaeological surveys and documentation of this temple was completed over 1926 and 1927 by Ghulam Yazdani – an archaeologist and epigraphist, and published in 1929. In this study, the four temples at Pillalamarri were in ruined state and incorrectly named:\n*Someswara Gudi (now identified as Erakeswara Temple or Yerakeswara)\n*Narasimhadeva temple (now Nameswara temple)\n*Mukandesvara temple (now Trikuteswara temple)\n*Rameswara temple (now Chennakesava temple)\nAccording to Yazdani, the temple in the northwest part of the village (Someswara, now Erakeswara) has several inscriptions, but some were modern. The Hindu masons of the medieval period had miscalculated the weights and this, he proposed, was the cause of the ruins and sunken floors he witnessed. The local ruler, patron and the builder of this and two other temples in the village was the Namireddi family, a Shudra by caste according to the genealogy inscribed on the stone in one of the temples, states Yazdani.\nArchitecture\nThe architectural style of the temple is close to Ramappa temple and Kota Gullu, other Kakatiya era temples. The temple is placed on an upapitha'' and is cruciform in shape. It has three porticos in the east, north and south and a garbhalaya in the west. The sikhara on the inner sanctum (garbhagudi) is made of brick and lime and is decorated all over by miniature turrets. It is said that the stone used in temple construction has interesting acoustic properties. When the temple stone is tapped with a coin, it sounds like metal. The temple has intricately carved pillars and walls. The temple walls are painted with frescoes.\nGallery\nFile:Erakesvara temple, Pillalamarri, Suryapet district, Telangana 03.jpg\nFile:Erakesvara temple, Pillalamarri, Suryapet district, Telangana 15.jpg\nFile:Erakesvara temple, Pillalamarri, Suryapet district, Telangana 20.jpg\nFile:Erakesvara temple, Pillalamarri, Suryapet district, Telangana 30.jpg\nFile:Erakesvara temple, Pillalamarri, Suryapet district, Telangana 26.jpg\nFile:Erakesvara temple, Pillalamarri, Suryapet district, Telangana 29.jpg\nFile:Sri Erakeswara temple in Pillalamari.jpg\nFile:Sculpture inside Pillalamari Temple - 2aef.jpg\nFile:Sculpture inside Pillalamari Temple.jpg\nFile:Erakesvara temple, Pillalamarri, Suryapet district, Telangana 16.jpg|Inscription pillar\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
