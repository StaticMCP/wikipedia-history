The vice president is appointed by the president, with the consent of the Parliament, composed of the National Assembly and the Senate. The Ivorian Constitution of 2016 initially provided for the vice president to be elected at the same time as the president by direct universal suffrage, as running mate of the presidential candidate. A constitutional revision announced by Ouattara before the 2020 presidential election, confirms the designation of the vice-president, appointed by the president with the consent of Parliament.\nThe vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession and would ascend to the presidency upon the death or resignation of the president, or an absolute vacancy in the office. President Alassane Ouattara appointed Daniel Kablan Duncan as vice president in January 2017 after the 2016 Constitution was enacted.\nHistory\nThe office of vice president was first created in 1980, but it was abolished in 1985. The adoption of a new constitution in 2016 recreated the office of vice president.\nEligibility\nThe same provisions of the 2016 Constitution for the president apply to a candidate for election as vice president.\nDuties\nThe duties of the vice president of Ivory Coast are:\n* Presiding of various meetings in absence of the president\n* Acting president when the president is out of the country\n* ascend to the presidency upon the death or resignation of the president, or an absolute vacancy in the office\nList of officeholders\n;Political parties\n|Democratic Party of Ivory Coast – African Democratic Rally (PDCI–RDA)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Other factions\n|Independent|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"150\" | Name\n! colspan=\"3\" | Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Political party\n! rowspan=\"2\" | President\n|-\n!
