The film focuses on historical events and how they inter-generationally affect the Indigenous population in North America today.\nThe film premiered on April 20, 2018, at the Thin Line festival in Denton, Texas.\nThe film also showed at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Film Festival on May 3, 2018, where it was awarded \"Best of Fest\" and was awarded The Samuel Sprynczynatyk Storyteller Award: Best Documentary Feature at the North Dakota Human Rights Film Festival.\nFilmed across the lands of the Plains Indians, which is now known as Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Colorado, and Montana, the film recalls first-hand storytelling that reflects how past generations were deeply impacted by mass trauma and how that trauma influences Indigenous peoples of the Americas today. The film ends on a positive path to healing through ceremony and cultural identity.\nSynopsis\nThe title of the film was inspired by American Indian Movement (AIM) co-founder Dennis Banks who stated \"we have been dodging bullets for generations\" which metaphorically infers that Native Americans not only have had to dodge bullets fired from guns, but also the genocide and ethnocide inflected by the colonists since first contact with Europeans. This film brings a cross-generational sampling of Indigenous people, researchers, and politicians to reveal reasons for their disproportionately high incidences of health disparities and social issues. This collection of stories, names Historical Trauma as the unique and insidious part of the genetic code that resilient Native American populations are still finding ways to dodge. The film focuses on Native Americans and is not the typical \"tragedy porn\" film about Indian country, it is more of an accurate portrayal of life with Indigenous people and researchers reflecting stereotypes by examining current issues of poverty, racism and mental illness through a historical lens.\nCo-director statement\n\"Stories of Survival from Historical Trauma will help us to heal. However, it is our connections to our culture, traditions, and family that has allowed us to not only to survive but will allow us to thrive now ... and forever\", said Kathy Broere (Blackfeet).\nCast\n* Rick McArthur, AIM Legal Resources\n* Dr. Rachel Yehuda, Director of the Traumatic Stress Studies Division at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine\n* Winona LaDuke, Program Director, Honor the Earth\n* Dr. Melissa Walls, (Bois Forte and Couchiching First Nation Anishinaabe) research sociologist, University of Minnesota Duluth Director of Great Lakes Hub, Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n* Chy (Native Youth)\n* Tall Paul, Anishinaabe hip-hop artist\n* Keith Secola Ojibwe, Native American musician\n* Mike Her Many Horses, Oglala historian, Wounded Knee, South Dakota\n* Melvin Lee Houston, Santee Treaty Rights Representative\n* Michelle Johnson-Jennings, PhD, Ed.M. clinical health psychologist\n* Dr. Karlee Fellner, Cree/Métis Associate Professor, University of Calgary otipemisiwak-nehiyawiskwew in Siksikaitsitapi territory, Indigenous Education Counseling\n* Vanessa Goodthunder, Director of Cansayapi Wakanyeza Owayawa Oti Lower Sioux Indian Reservation Early Head Start\n* Jesse Ventura, former Governor, State of Minnesota\n* Clyde Bellecourt, co-founding the American Indian Movement\n* Richie Plass, Curator Bittersweet Winds\n* Tara Houska, Couchiching First Nation, tribal attorney, the National Campaigns Director of Honor the Earth\n* Dr. Anton Treuer, Professor of Ojibwe at Bemidji State University\n* Rep.
