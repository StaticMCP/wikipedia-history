He was also the theatre critic for The Sunday Times.\nBiography\nEdward Rose was born in Swaffham, Norfolk, on 7 August 1849, son of Caleb Rose, a physician, and his first wife, Isabella Morse. He attended Islington Proprietary School and Ipswich Grammar School.  He worked in the solicitors firm Cobbold and Yarrington (in Ipswich) for four years, from 1868 to 1872. In 1872 he moved to London.\nHe began writing plays in 1869, and first had a play – Our Farm – produced in London in 1872.  He was a regular contributor to the Illustrated London News, specifically, the English Homes series, and was the theatre critic for the Sunday Times starting in 1894 and continuing until at least 1897. His greatest success as a playwright came in 1896 with the premiere of his adaption of The Prisoner of Zenda. He later adapted other works of Anthony Hope, but none reached the same level of success.\nHe married Elizabeth Ann Gould, and had two daughters, Lucy and Dorothy. His elder daughter, Lucy, died when she was ten, and in her memory Rose endowed a research post at the London School of Economics and paid for the education of a board school girl.\nHe served for a while as the Vice-President of the Playgoer's Club, and was a member of the Fabian Society. He \"took an active interest in the founding of Letchworth Garden City.\"\nIn 1902, Rose published The Rose Reader \"a new way of teaching to read,\" that used only words that were spelled the way they sounded, in order to develop the love of reading before complicating the process.\nEdward Rose died on 31 December 1904 at the age of 55.\nConfusion with Edward Everett Rose\nHe is sometimes confused or conflated with Edward Everett Rose (1862–1939), a Canadian-born American dramatist also known for dramatizing novels, notably Richard Carvel and the Penrod stories of Booth Tarkington.\nPartial bibliography\n* Our Farm (1st perf. 29 June 1872)\n* Columbus: A Historical Play in Five Acts (published 1873)\n* A Congress at Paris (1st perf.
