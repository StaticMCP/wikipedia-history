Established approximately at the same time as its parent party, the QCP was one of the party's three largest branches, sitting behind the New South Wales and Victorian branches in electoral results, membership and popularity.\nIts main headquarters and support-base was in the South East Queensland region, however the party also maintained strong support in and around Townsville in North Queensland. Indeed, unlike the national Communist Party's steep decline in membership during the Cold War years, North Queensland saw no noticeable decline.\nHolding numerous Councillors throughout the state, the QCP is the only party branch that held a member of parliament to a state legislature.\nElectoral results\nState\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Queensland\n! width=\"75\"| Election\n! width=\"70\"| Candidates\n! width=\"70\"| Votes\n! width=\"45\"| %\n! width=\"50\"| +/–\n! width=\"65\" colspan=2| Seats\n|-\n|1929\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|0.66\n| 0.66\n|0\n|\n|-\n|1932\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|0.23\n| 0.43\n|0\n|\n|-\n|1935\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|1.30\n| 1.07\n|0\n|\n|-\n|1938\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|1.58\n| 0.28\n|0\n|\n|-\n|1941\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|3.03\n| 1.45\n|0\n|\n|-\n|1944\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|2.43\n| 0.60\n|1\n| 1\n|-\n|1947\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|1.24\n| 1.19\n|1\n|\n|-\n|1950\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n||color=#000|text-shadow=no}}\n|0.37\n| 0.87\n|0\n| 1\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
