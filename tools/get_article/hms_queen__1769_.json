She was designed by William Bateley, and was the only ship built to her draught. Her armament was increased to 98 guns in the 1780s.\nService\nthat led, two days later, to the battle of the Glorious First of June]]\nQueen fought at the First Battle of Ushant under Keppel in 1778, and the Second Battle of Ushant under Kempenfelt in 1781.
