It was founded in 2015 and joined the International Freedom Battalion (IFB).\nEstablishment\nFollowing the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, in 2012, the autonomous region of Rojava was established in northern Syria, where the Kurdish-led People's Protection Units (YPG) fought against the Syrian Arab Republic and the Islamic State. Many Greek anarchists volunteered to fight for the YPG, seeking to gain experience in guerrilla warfare and apply their tactics back in Greece. In 2015, Greek anarchists and anarcho-communists established the Revolutionary Union for Internationalist Solidarity (RUIS), as a specifically anarchist military unit.\nIt joined the International Freedom Battalion (IFB), an organisation of left-wing foreign volunteers established in June 2015, which fights alongside the YPG. The RUIS was a later addition to the IFB, which was initially predominated by Turkish Marxist-Leninist organisations. In May 2017, the RUIS made a statement declaring it would spill blood \"from Rojava to Athens\", which caught the attention of the Greek authorities.\nDeath of Haukur Hilmarsson\nIn early 2018, one of its fighters, the Icelandic anarchist Haukur Hilmarsson, was killed by the Turkish Armed Forces during the Turkish invasion of Afrin. In its announcement of his death, the RUIS declared that he had \"become immortal\" and that his example had inspired them to continue their \"resistance against fascism and tyranny\". In response, the RUIS called for attacks against assets of the Turkish state in Greece. The following year, far-left groups affiliated with the RUIS attacked the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki and set fire to a Turkish diplomatic vehicle.\nSee also\n* Anarchism in Syria\n* Rojava Revolution\n* International Freedom Battalion\n* International Revolutionary People's Guerrilla Forces\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://twitter.com/RUIS_Rojava Twitter]"
