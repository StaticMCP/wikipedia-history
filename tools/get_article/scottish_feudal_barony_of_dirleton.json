The de Vaux family held the barony prior it passing to the Haliburton family via the marriage of the heiress Agatha de Vaux to John de Haliburton. The barony then passed to the Ruthven family via the marriage of the heiress Janet de Haliburton to William Ruthven. After the forfeiture of the Ruthven family, the barony was granted to Thomas Erskine of Gogar in 1603.  The barony was sold in 1625 to James Douglas, who sold it to James Maxwell in 1631.  It was acquired by Robert Fletcher in 1658 and he later sold it to John Nisbet in 1663. Nisbet constructed Archerfield House, as his primary residence.\nCitations\nReferences\n*Whitaker, J & Sons: ''Whitaker's Peerage: Being a Directory of Titled Persons'' 1905."
