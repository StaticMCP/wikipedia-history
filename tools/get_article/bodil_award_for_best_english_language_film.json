      "text": "# Bodil Award for Best English Language Film\n\nThe Bodil Award for Best English Language Film is one of the categories for the Bodil Awards presented annually by the Danish Union of Film Critics (). It was created in 1948 and is one of the oldest film prizes in Europe. The category was named \"Best American Film\" until 1961, when it became the \"Best Non-European Film\". In 2001, the name of the award changed back to \"Best American Film\", and the European category was changed to \"Best Non-American Film\". The award was given its current name in 2024.\nThe judging committee may choose not to present an award if there isn't a worthy film. This has happened twice: In 1957, when American producers boycotted Denmark; and in 1964, when two Bodils were awarded to European films.\nHonorees\n1940s\n* 1948: The Best Years of Our Lives directed by William Wyler\n* 1949: Monsieur Verdoux directed by Charles Chaplin\n1950s\n* 1950: The Snake Pit directed by Anatole Litvak\n* 1951: Sunset Boulevard directed by Billy Wilder\n* 1952: All About Eve directed by Joseph L.
