The limber for attaching to a horse team is visible stretching to the right.]]\nFire services in the United Kingdom use a variety of fire appliances, which perform a wide range of general and specialised roles and fit into several distinct categories. Contemporary fire appliances carry a multitude of equipment and firefighting media (such as water and foam) to deal with different types of emergencies ranging from fires, rescues, vehicle extrication, floods, salvage, casualty and trauma care.\nThe design and size of a fire appliance depends very much upon the role it is expected to perform. In general, most fire and rescue services use a standardised range of vehicles and equipment. However, airport fire services tend to use much larger and heavier appliances than those typically deployed by public fire services.\nMost front line fire appliances in the UK are marked in high conspicuity red and yellow battenburg markings, and are fitted with blue lights and sirens. Many appliances have roller shutter doors revealing compartments housing various items of equipment.\nPublic fire and rescue services\nPublic fire and rescue services are those operated by fire and rescue authorities, and funded by council tax.\nMost fire appliances used by them are referred to as \"domestic\" type appliances to differentiate them from larger airport crash tenders. They are normally based on truck chassis and weigh over 12tonnes, meaning they require an LGV licence to be driven. Some brigades use slightly smaller appliances based on gross vehicle weight of 7.5tonnes, which do not require an LGV licence. They are common in rural brigades where narrow lanes and rough terrain would be difficult for a larger fire engine to negotiate.\nWater tender ladder / pump rescue ladder / rescue ladder / rescue pump / pump ladder / water rescue tender\n. This example used a double acting steam engine to pump water. It was used privately on the Duke of Beaufort's estate until 1939.]]\nThe most common front line appliance deployed to all emergency calls goes by a variety of names, including rescue ladder, pump ladder, water rescue tender, or slight variations on those names.\nIt is a general purpose unit capable of carrying and pumping water, carrying rescue and cutting equipment to deal with road traffic accidents and other rescue operations, a large ladder (for example ) and several smaller ladders and roof ladders.\nThe appliance also carries breathing apparatus, lighting, tools, trauma care packs, water rescue gear, lines (ropes), hoses, and possibly chemical protection suits and foam. The vehicle will be crewed by four to six firefighters.\nWater ladder / water tender\nA water ladder or water tender is very similar to the aforementioned appliance, however with less emphasis on rescue gear and will usually carry a smaller ladder (for example 9m or 10.5m).\nIt is normally mobilised to augment and support the initial appliance or to respond to secondary, less urgent incidents. It is crewed by four to six firefighters.\nHydraulic platform\nA hydraulic platform is a large appliance used for effecting rescue from high-rise structures.\nIt is essentially a large crane fitted with a caged platform which can be hoisted to heights well over  in some cases. The platform may be raised to windows or balconies to rescue stranded persons.\nThe appliance is also capable of pumping water and as such occasionally these units are also used to direct water jets into a fire from an elevated position.\nLight rescue pump\nThese vehicles can vary from a converted van chassis to a purpose built fire appliance chassis. They often carry hydraulic rescue gear, 9m or 5.8m extension ladders and water. They are most often used as a second appliance in place of a pump rescue ladder or as a first appliance in its place in areas with small, tight roads.\nTurntable ladder\nA turntable ladder is similar in appearance to a hydraulic platform, however with a primary difference of instead of having a caged platform the turntable ladder is simply a large telescopic ladder, which can still be used to effect rescues from tall structures and pump water.\nAerial ladder platform\nAn aerial ladder platform is designed to deploy an elevated master stream of water, or to provide a method of rescuing trapped persons, the 'knuckle' design of the arm of an aerial ladder platform means that it is very manoeuvrable for rescue situations. The vehicle also has a set of ladders alongside the main boom that can be used for access or escape in the case of boom failure while at height.\nLight four-wheel drive pump\nLight four-wheel drive pumps  are a smaller version of the front line fire engine. They are usually used in rural locations where they can more easily negotiate tough terrain, narrow streets or remote access to certain areas.\nThey ordinarily carry a condensed quota of the equipment usually found on a normal-sized fire engine.\nLight two-wheel drive pumps may also be used.\nRescue tender\nrescue tender pictured in 2023]]\nA rescue tender is a generic term for any fire appliance which carries out a \"heavy\" or \"specialist\" rescue role.\nThe equipment it carries varies depending on where it is deployed. It may carry heavy-duty cutting equipment for use at road traffic collisions or other transport incidents.\nWater rescue and confined space rescue gear may also feature, as well as extensive lighting equipment and pneumatic airbags to lift heavy loads.\nOperational support unit\noperational support unit pictured in 2008]]\nAn operational support unit is a multi-role vehicle.\nThe term is interchangeable with other support appliances such as HazMat and chemical support, breathing apparatus tenders, hose layers, damage control tenders or decontamination units.\nThe vehicle carries equipment to support normal fire appliances and crews, typically at prolonged or major incidents.\nBreathing apparatus tender\nBreathing apparatus tenders carry extensive stocks of spare breathing apparatus (BA) cylinders at large incidents. They replenish cylinders which may have been used by firefighters tackling a protracted blaze or dealing with hazardous materials.\nSome breathing apparatus tenders are also fitted with compressors which allow empty BA cylinders to be recharged on scene. Most also contain a mobile workshop so that BA sets can be repaired at the scene of incident so that they can be made available for use again at the incident within a very short period of time.\nHazMat / scientific support unit / decontamination unit\nscientific support unit pictured in 2007]]\nThese are specialised units equipped to deal with hazardous materials (HazMat) incidents.\nDecontamination Units carry specialised equipment capable of decontaminating emergency workers and/or members of the public who have come into contact with HazMats. The equipment carried is wide-ranging and highly technical in nature.\nCommand unit\n's command unit pictured in 2009]]\nThe advancement of technology and potential for very large-scale incidents has led to more fire services using or increasing their use of mobile command units.\nA fundamental advantage of such an appliance is to accommodate the many different types of communication equipment needed at major incidents. In addition to the wide range of radio frequencies used, fire chiefs often need to communicate via landlines and send and receive information via satellite links and CCTV  of the ongoing situation.\nThe command vehicle can essentially be used as an on-site conference centre for command personnel, mapping and planning firefighting operations and booking-in and directing crews as they arrive.\nWater carrier\nWater carriers  are tankers that are used to provide vast volumes of water to locations that may not have a nearby hydrant or open water supply. In some Fire and Rescue Services they also double as foam tenders.\nFoam tender\nFoam tenders  carry large amounts of foam to be used at incidents where water is ineffective or cannot be used to tackle a blaze. They may take the form of a tanker, or a lorry carrying foam packets or barrels. In some fire and rescue services, water carriers serve as foam tenders, by dumping their regular load of water and replacing it with foam.\nWelfare unit / mobile canteen\nAt large protracted incidents firefighters may be subjected to physically arduous work in inhospitable situations such as extreme heat. As such the welfare of firefighters is taken very seriously and ability to provide refreshments to sustain hydration and energy levels is paramount. This is where a welfare unit is mobilised.\nFire investigation unit\nFIU pictured in 2023]]\nA fire investigation unit attends fires and incidents where the cause is thought to be suspicious, and is crewed by specially trained experts, acting in assistance to police investigations. It may take the form of a car or van.\nSome brigades may also use specially trained search dogs. At the scene of incidents, the dog wears specialist protective 'fire wellies' on his or her paws to guard against injuries from broken glass or hot material. The dogs can detect minute quantities of hydrocarbon accelerants within minutes. This procedure would normally take a human investigator - using specialist equipment - much longer, before samples can be taken away for scientific analysis.\nNew Dimension vehicles\npictured in 2009]]\nNew Dimension vehicles are large curtain-side trucks designed to be deployed at incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) materials or for urban search and rescue (USAR) use at the scenes of natural or large-scale disasters.\nThey do not pump water, but instead carry stocks of mass decontamination equipment, scene lighting, chemical protection kits, environmental protection equipment and general purpose rescue equipment. They are always on standby to be deployed if local resources may be overwhelmed.\nThe New Dimension vehicles are owned by the government, rather than the fire and rescue service and are stationed at strategic locations throughout the UK.\nHigh volume pumps\nHigh volume pumps are also part of the New Dimension scheme. They carry a submersible pump, supplying water from any open source to the fireground; a pump that pumps up to  per minute (twice as much as a standard fire engine); a hose box module; and ancillary equipment. This equipment is carried in a pod on the back of the vehicle, similar to goods on a flatbed truck.  Because the vehicles are standard across the country, any high-volume pump vehicle can carry any pod, irrespective of the fire and rescue service the vehicle or pod is operated by. The pods are the same dimensions as the other New Dimension pods, so a vehicle that is used for high volume pump operations can carry a USAR pod.\nThey were used to great effect and in vast scale to assist operations at the Buncefield fire in Hertfordshire in 2005 and nationwide flooding in 2007.\nMotorcycles\npictured in 2009]]\nIn July 2010, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service began a six-month trial of two fire bikes to be used to fight small fires, freeing up main appliances. Merseyside has also deployed other bikes for various uses since 2005. Several UK fire services use fire bikes not for firefighting, but as motorcycle road safety awareness tools.\nAirport rescue and firefighting services\nMinistry of Defence fire services\nThe Defence Fire and Rescue Service and Royal Air Force Rescue and Firefighting Service operate numerous types of appliances, ranging from domestic-type tenders to airfield crash tenders, depending on the location they are serving.\nFire and rescue vehicles in British overseas territories\nFire service vehicles in British overseas territories are, in most cases, similar to those used in the United Kingdom. They also usually employ the use of battenburg markings.\nReferences"
