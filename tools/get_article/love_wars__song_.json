Within the fiction of the show in episode 23, Itano and Kasai's characters Queen and Elizabeth compete in a Pop Idol-inspired contest called Fuuuuuutic Idol to win a record deal. When they are eliminated from the competition in favor of a much worse musician, they call upon the television show's protagonists Shotaro Hidari (Renn Kiriyama) and Philip (Masaki Suda) to investigate why they have lost, discovering that the rumored Radio Tower Clown is to blame. Soon after the case is closed, Queen and Elizabeth get their record deal after making another appearance on Fuuuuuutic Idol. At the same time, Kasai and Itano (in character) began hosting an Internet radio show connected with W on the fictional Wind Wave radio station titled .\nTheir single \"Love♡Wars\" was released on March 31, 2010, as four different variants: a standard CD single with no bonus tracks (Type-C), a CD+DVD single featuring a solo rendition of the title track by Itano as a bonus track (Type-A), a CD+DVD single featuring a solo rendition by Kasai as a bonus track (Type-B), and a CD+DVD single containing the fictional song Queen & Elizabeth \"lost\" to from the television series (Type-D). While each different version of the CD has its own cover, a fifth variant cover exists for the standard CD+DVD release. The DVDs featured in each release include the music video, while the Type-A and Type-B releases also include a making-of documentary for the music video.\n\"Love♡Wars\" reached the No. 4 spot on the Oricon Weekly Single Rankings chart, and remained in the charts for a total of 9 weeks.\nTrack listing\nFūto Tawā\n| extra5          = Jimmy Nakata (Keisuke Tomita)\n}}\nReferences"
