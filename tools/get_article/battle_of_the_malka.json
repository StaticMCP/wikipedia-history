The 5 hour–long battle ended in no deciding victory for either side.\nHistory\nPrelude\nMansur had previously attempted to advance to Kabardia, where he would join forces with the Kabardians and conduct joined actions. However, upon receiving news that the Russian army was waiting for him there, and, especially since his army was running out of food, he tried occupying the Chervlenaya village, but a Russian detachment which had followed him, repelled the attack.\nMansur was in a difficult situation, as several days passed and his food supply was running out. He decided to go to Kabardia and restock on supplies. However, there, the detachment of Colonel Larion Nagel was waiting for him.\nBattle\nMounted patrols of Sheikh Mansur, who always moved ahead of the rest of the mountaineer army, informed Mansur that the Russian forces were planning to ambush his army.\nMansurs troops quickly occupied the forest and gorges, thus completely surrounding the Russian detachment of Nagel. Then, the Russian troops advanced, and the highlanders began feinting a retreat, while also opening heavy fire on the Russian troops. Mansur's plan was to lure the Russian forces into the forest, where the North Caucasians had a clear advantage in fighting. Nagel however did not fall for the trick. Thus, the Russian advance stopped and waited for reinforcements to arrive.\nUnlike the Russians, the rebels could not wait long, as their food supply was running out.ITt was necessary to get to the Kabardian villages as soon as possible. Mansur sent their compatriot, Prince Dol, to the residents of Greater Kabarda with the message that they needed to prepare food, since he would soon arrive to them with his army. This will happen as soon as he defeats the royal troops, which are already surrounded by him on all sides. Through Prince Dol, Mansur convinced the Kabardians that he would certainly defeat Nagel’s detachment or cut off the water in the mountain rivers, which would force the Russians to surrender.\nAt dawn of 30 October, Mansur launched an attack on the detachment from several sides. A fierce battle broke out, but ended in no deciding victory for either side. The mountaineers retreated back into the forest and closed several mountain rivers, which forced Nagel's army to leave and approach the fortified town of Tatartup. A few days later, Mansur attacked the fortification in what would become the Battle of Tatartup.\nSee also\n*Siege of Kizlyar (August 1785) — Last major battle between Mansur and the Russian Empire\n*Battle of Tatartup — Next major battle between Mansur and the Russian Empire\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*  |last=Хасбулатов |first=А.И. |url=https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21678449 |title=История Чечни с древнейших времён до наших дней |last2=Гапуров |first2=Ш.А. |last3=Ахмадов |first3=Ш.Б. |last4=Багаев |first4=М.Х. |last5=Хизриев |first5=Х.А. |last6=Ахмадов |first6=Я.З. |last7=Исаев |first7=С.А. |last8=Бадаев |first8=С.Э.С. |last9=Ибрагимова |first9=З.Х. |publisher=Книжное издательство |year=2006 |isbn=978-5-98896-103-1 |editor-last=Ибрагимов |editor-first=М.М. |location=Grozny |pages=1–828 |language=Russian |trans-title=History of Chechnya from the ancient times to the present day}}\nExternal links\n* [https://runivers.ru/conflicts/actions/boy_u_grigoriopolisa/ Battle of Grigoriopolis (in Russian)]"
