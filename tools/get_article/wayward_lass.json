However, the filly did not get her first win until her eighth start in October at Belmont Park but then won her next outing, the Schuylkill Stakes at Keystone Race Track in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.\nU.S. Champion at three\nIn 1981, Wayward Lass won seven of thirteen starts with two seconds and four thirds. After finishing third in her first start of the year, she reeled off three very impressive wins at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York. He first win was by 7 lengths in the January 17 Busanda Stakes, followed by a 12½ length victory two weeks later in the Searching Stakes  and then a win on February 15 by 11¾ lengths in the Ruthless Stakes.\nAt Belmont Park in June 1981, Wayward Lass won the Grades I Mother Goose Stakes at a mile and an eighth, and the Coaching Club American Oaks at a mile and a half.\nRetired at the end of September, Wayward Lass was voted the 1981 Eclipse Award for American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly.\nA $2.35 million broodmare\nIn 1982, Wayward Lass was bred to In Reality and gave birth to a filly on March 13, 1983.

The resulting filly, and the thirteen other foals Wayward Lass produced, met with little success in racing.\nWhile in foal to City Zip, Wayward Lass died of a heart attack on July 10, 2003 at Gus Schoenborn Jr.'s Contemporary Stallions near Coxsackie, New York.\nReferences\n* [http://www.pedigreequery.com/wayward+lass Wayward Lass's pedigree and partial racing stats]"
