      "text": "# Timeline of Brexit\n\nBrexit was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020 (00:00 1 February 2020 CET). , the UK is the only member state to have left the EU. Britain entered the predecessor to the EU, the European Communities (EC), on 1 January 1973. Following this, Eurosceptic groups grew in popularity in the UK, opposing aspects of both the EC and the EU. As Euroscepticism increased during the early 2010s, Prime Minister David Cameron delivered a speech in January 2013 at Bloomberg London, in which he called for reform of the EU and promised an in–out referendum on the UK's membership if the Conservative Party won a majority at the 2015 general election. The Conservatives won 330 seats at the election, giving Cameron a majority of 12, and a bill to hold a referendum was introduced to Parliament that month.\nIn February 2016, Cameron set the date of the referendum to be 23 June that year, and a period of campaigning began. A total of 33,577,342 votes were cast in the poll, with 51.89% voting for Britain to leave the EU. Cameron announced his resignation as prime minister the next day, with Theresa May taking over the position on 13 July. On 29 March the following year, May delivered a letter to Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, which officially commenced the UK's withdrawal from the EU and began a two-year negotiating process.\nBrexit negotiations between the UK and the EU began in June 2017, and, by March the following year, a \"large part\" of the withdrawal agreement had been agreed. On 25 November, the leaders of the remaining 27 EU countries officially endorsed the deal, with May putting it to Parliament in January 2019. The vote on the withdrawal agreement was defeated by 432 votes to 202, the biggest defeat of any government in the House of Commons. Two further votes on the deal—on 12 and 29 March—also resulted in large defeats for May.\nFollowing these defeats, on 24 May the Prime Minister announced her resignation. A leadership contest began, which was won by Boris Johnson on 24 July. With the Brexit deadlock still not broken, on 29 October the Members of Parliament (MPs) voted in favour of holding a general election on 12 December. The Conservative Party won 365 seats in the election, giving them a majority of 80 seats. With a majority in the House of Commons now, Johnson's withdrawal agreement was voted through Parliament, and the UK officially left the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020. A transition period—in which Britain remained a part of the European single market and the European Union Customs Union—began, as did negotiation on a new trade deal.\nAfter negotiations throughout 2020, the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was announced on 24 December, allowing goods to be sold between the two markets without tariffs or quotas. At 23:00 on 31 December 2020, the transition period ended, and the UK formally completed its separation from the EU. , the broad consensus of economists is that leaving the EU has had a substantially negative effect on the UK's economy, which is expected to be several percentage points smaller than it would have been if it had remained in the bloc.\nBackground\nUnited Kingdom–European Union relations\n(pictured), signed on 7 February 1992, legally established the European Union.|alt=Colour photograph of a copy of the Maastricht Treaty in the Museum der Bayerischen Geschichte in October 2019]]\nThe UK entered the EC on 1 January 1973, following the ratification of the Treaty of Accession 1972, signed by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath. Two years later, on 5 June 1975, a national referendum endorsed the UK's continued membership of the EC, with 67.23% voting that the country should remain in the EC. Over the following decades, Eurosceptic attitudes began to develop within Britain's two main political parties, the Conservatives and the Labour Party. In the 1983 general election, Labour's campaign manifesto vowed to withdraw from the EC within the lifetime of the following Parliament. The manifesto was dubbed \"the longest suicide note in history\", and the election was won by the Conservatives, led by the incumbent prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher continued to serve as prime minister until she resigned on 22 November 1990, amid divisions within the Conservative Party over the UK's involvement in Europe. Two years later, the Maastricht Treaty was signed by the 12 member states of the EC, including the UK, which began the formal establishment of the European Union.\nPolitical history of the United Kingdom (2005–13)\n(left) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (right) in February 2015, during the period of the Cameron–Clegg coalition|alt=Colour photograph of David Cameron and Nick Clegg standing behind podiums in February 2015]]\nOn 6 December 2005, David Cameron, the MP for Witney, was elected as leader of the Conservative Party, beating David Davis in the final round. After serving as leader of the opposition for nearly five years, Cameron led his party into the 2010 general election on 6 May that year. The Conservatives gained 97 seats for a total of 307, making them the largest party in Parliament. Labour, who had been in government before the election, won 258 seats, while the Liberal Democrats, with 57 seats, were the third-largest party. With no single party having won enough seats to form a majority government, the country had its first hung parliament since 1974. All three leaders made statements offering openness to creating an administration with another party, and a series of negotiations began. Just after midnight on 12 May, the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement was approved, with Cameron as prime minister and Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as deputy prime minister.\nAs well as a new prime minister, the 2010 general election also saw a new generation of more Eurosceptic MPs elected to the UK government. On 24 October 2011, Cameron experienced the largest rebellion over European integration since World War II when 81 Conservative MPs voted in favour of a motion calling for a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. Of these 81 MPs, 49 had been elected in 2010. The previous month, a petition carrying over 100,000 signatures that also called for a referendum was delivered to 10 Downing Street. Faced with this growing Euroscepticism, on 23 January 2013, Cameron delivered the Bloomberg speech at Bloomberg London, in which he promised an in–out referendum on EU membership if the Conservatives won a majority at the 2015 general election.\nBrexit\nThe word Brexit is a portmanteau of the phrase \"British exit\". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term was coined in a blog post on the website Euractiv by Peter Wilding, director of European policy at BSkyB, on 15 May 2012. Wilding coined Brexit to refer to the end of UK membership in the EU – by 2016, usage of the word had increased by 3,400% in one year.\nPre-referendum\n2013\non 23 January 2013, when an in–out referendum on EU membership was first promised]]\n*23 January: Cameron delivers the Bloomberg speech, covering the UK's future relationship with Europe.

The broad consensus of economists is that leaving the EU has had a substantially negative effect on the UK's economy. In a January 2021 survey of leading US and European economists, 86% expected that the UK's economy would be several percentage points smaller by 2030 than it would have been if it had remained in the bloc. Two years later, in February 2023, an analysis by Bloomberg Economics concluded that Brexit was costing the UK £100&nbsp;billion a year in lost output, leaving the country's economy 4% smaller than it otherwise would have been. Similarly, the Office for Budget Responsibility has also forecasted that Brexit will cause Britain's economy to be 4% smaller, and exports and imports to be 15% lower.\n, public opinion of Brexit has also shifted. From 2016 to 2021, views within Britain remained relatively evenly split, with analysts attributing changing patterns to the declining population of elderly Brexit-supporting voters and an increasing number of younger Remain supporters reaching voting age. From 2022 onwards, public opinion changed, with polling conducted by YouGov finding that the public felt that the UK was wrong to leave the EU by 56% to 32%, and that a quarter of Brexit supporters regretted their vote. Among Leave voters who regretted their decision, the most common reasons were a feeling that things had gotten worse since the referendum, and concerns over the economy and cost of living. In January 2023, a similar poll by UnHerd and Focaldata concluded that in all but three of Britain's 632 constituencies, a plurality of people agreed that the UK was wrong to leave the EU.\nIn May 2025, a new EU–UK deal that addresses fishing rights, trade, defence and import–export conflicts was announced by von der Leyen and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal brings ties between the EU and the UK closer, with border checks dropped and EU access to UK fishing stock restored. Additionally, a new agreement meant that the UK could once again sell raw burgers and sausages back into the EU for the first time since Brexit. Defence ties were re-formalised, the ability to work and travel was restored, and the UK and EU linked their carbon markets to avoid taxes on carbon-intensive goods such as steel and cement travelling between the two blocs.\n}}\nExternal links\nSimilar timelines\n*[https://apnews.com/article/europe-general-elections-elections-referendums-david-cameron-f673af169925d30e524169ef92c4f386 \"Timeline of events in Britain's exit from the European Union\"] at Associated Press\n*[https://www.cer.eu/brexit-timeline \"Brexit timeline\"] at the Centre for European Reform\n*[https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7960/CBP-7960.pdf \"Brexit timeline: events leading to the UK's exit from the European Union\"] at the House of Commons Library\n*[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-timeline-events-uk-leave-eu-referendum-may-boris-parliament-a9310221.html \"Brexit timeline: Flashpoints from the 2016 referendum to leaving the EU in 2020\"] at The Independent\n*[https://vancouversun.com/pmn/news-pmn/timeline-of-brexit-and-events-leading-to-mays-departure/wcm/eb24f977-d140-466b-9103-f00a05f07c3d \"Timeline of Brexit and events leading to May's departure\"] at the Vancouver Sun"
