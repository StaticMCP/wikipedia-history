That same year, both nations opened consulates in each other's capitals, respectively. In 1936, Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas named one of the principle streets in the Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City after the first Czechoslovak President Tomáš Masaryk. For its part, there is a Lázaro Cárdenas Square (Park Generála Lázaro Cárdenase) in the Prague 6 district.\nDiplomatic relations between the two nations were interrupted in April 1939 after the invasion from Germany in the country, however, the exiled Czechoslovak government in London maintained relations with Mexico. Mexico condemned the annexations of Czech lands by Germany at the League of Nations.
