It was a Blue Ensign with the badge of the Governor-in-chief in the fly. The separate colonies under the Federal Colony each had their own ensigns. In 1903, the shape of the crown on the badge was changed slightly. The Governor-in-chief of the Windward Islands used a Union Flag defaced with the badge.\nThe Federal Colony of the Windward Islands became the Territory of the Windward Islands in June 1956, and was dissolved in 1958.\nGallery\nHistorical flags\nStandard of the Governor-in-chief\n}}\nSee also\n*Former parts of Windward Islands\n**Flag of Grenada\n**Flag of Saint Lucia\n**Flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n**Flag of Dominica\n*Flag of the West Indies Federation\n*Flag of the British Leeward Islands\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n\n---\n\n## Flag of the british windward islands\n\n#REDIRECT Flag of the British Windward Islands"
