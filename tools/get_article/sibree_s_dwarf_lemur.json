The species was long believed extinct, following the destruction of its first recorded forest habitat. This was also the first confirmation of Sibree's dwarf lemur as a unique species.\nSibree's dwarf lemur spends the winter by hibernating  underground in small burrows. This keeps body temperature steady at around  and possibly provides protection from predators.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Sibree's Dwarf Lemur\n\n#REDIRECT Sibree's dwarf lemur"
