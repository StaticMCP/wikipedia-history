In the UK, it is simply referred to as the Merchant Navy or MN. Merchant Navy vessels mostly fly the Red Ensign and the ships and ship's companies' are regulated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), a specialist agency of the UK Department of Transport. British merchant ships are registered under the UK or Red Ensign group ship registries. British Merchant Navy deck officers and ratings are certificated and trained according to STCW Convention and the syllabus of the Merchant Navy Training Board in maritime colleges and other training institutes around the UK.\nKing George V bestowed the title of \"Merchant Navy\" on the British merchant shipping fleets following their service in the First World War; a number of other nations have since adopted the title. Previously it had been known as the Mercantile Marine or Merchant Service, although the term \"Merchant Navy\" was already informally used from the 19th century.\nThe British Merchant Navy was historically one of the largest ship registries and source of crew in the world, with 33% of global tonnage registered in 1939. However, since the mid 20th century, the number of shipowners, ships, officers and crew have declined dramatically as a result of globalisation and the rise of flags of convenience. As of 2023, the British Merchant Navy numbered 1,054 ships.\nHistory\n, assigned to the Royal Naval Dockyard as the Examination Service vessel (that inspected merchant ships). Crew members included seafarers from the Merchant Navy. HMS Castle Harbour would later be sunk by a German submarine while being delivered to the Mediterranean by a Merchant Navy crew]]\nThe Merchant Navy has been in existence for a significant period in English and British history, owing its growth to trade and imperial expansion. It can be dated back to the 17th century, when an attempt was made to register all seafarers as a source of labour for the Royal Navy in times of conflict. That registration of merchant seafarers failed, and it was not successfully implemented until 1835.\nThe merchant fleet grew over successive years to become the world's foremost merchant fleet, benefiting considerably from trade with British possessions in India and the Far East. The lucrative trades in sugar, contraband opium to China, spices, and tea (carried by ships such as the Cutty Sark) helped to entrench this dominance in the 19th century.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, maritime education expanded to train merchant navy officers. For example, in 1855 Leith Nautical College provided training for seafarers in Scotland. Other maritime colleges developed in this period included the South Tyneside Marine and Technical College, founded 1861 (now the South Tyneside College) and the Southampton School of Navigation, 1902 (now the Warsash Maritime School).\nIn the First and Second World Wars, the merchant service suffered heavy losses from German U-boat attacks. A policy of unrestricted warfare meant that merchant seafarers were at risk of attack from enemy ships. The tonnage lost to U-boats in the First World War was around 7,759,090 tons, and around 14,661 merchant seafarers were killed. In honour of the sacrifice made by merchant seafarers in the First World War, George V granted the title \"Merchant Navy\" to the companies.\nIn 1928 George V gave Edward, Prince of Wales the title of \"Master of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets\"; which he retained after his accession to the throne in January 1936 and relinquished only at his abdication that December. Since Edward VIII, the title has been held by the sovereigns George VI and Elizabeth II. When the United Kingdom and the British Empire entered the Second World War in September 1939, George VI issued this message:\nduring World War II]]\nIn these anxious days, I would like to express to all Officers and Men and in the British Merchant Navy and the British Fishing Fleets my confidence in their unfailing determination to play their vital part in defence. To each one I would say: Yours is a task no less essential to my people's experience than that allotted to the Navy, Army and Air Force. Upon you, the Nation depends for much of its foodstuffs and raw materials and for the transport of its troops overseas. You have a long and glorious history, and I am proud to bear the title \"Master of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets\". I know that you will carry out your duties with resolution and with fortitude, and that high chivalrous traditions of your calling are safe in your hands. God keep you and prosper you in your great task.\nDuring the Second World War, German U-boats sank nearly 14.7&nbsp;million tons of Allied shipping, which amounted to 2,828 ships (around two-thirds of the total allied tonnage lost). The United Kingdom alone suffered the loss of 11.7&nbsp;million tons, which was 54% of the total Merchant Navy fleet at the outbreak of the Second World War. 32,000 merchant seafarers were killed aboard convoy vessels in the war, but along with the Royal Navy, the convoys successfully imported enough supplies to allow an Allied victory.\nBetween 1941 and 1949, the SR Merchant Navy class steam locomotives were built in the UK. Each locomotive of the class was named after British shipping lines from the Second World War, principally those operating out of Southampton.\nIn honour of the sacrifices made in both World Wars, representatives of the Merchant Navy lay wreaths of remembrance alongside the armed forces in the annual Remembrance Day service on 11 November. Following many years of lobbying to bring about official recognition of the sacrifices made by merchant seafarers in the two world wars and since, Merchant Navy Day became an official day of remembrance on 3 September 2000.\nThe merchant navy was also called upon to serve during the Falklands War and provided forty vessels, including transports, tankers and other vessels, with a total of 500,000 grt. The merchant ship SS Atlantic Conveyor, being used to ferry\nHarrier fighters and other aircraft to the South Atlantic, was lost during the conflict after being struck by an air-launched Exocet missile. The ship's captain, Ian North, and 11 other crew members died in the attack which constituted the first loss of a British merchant navy ship to an armed attack since the Second World War.\nHistorically a person wishing to become a captain, or master prior to about 1969, had three choices: to attend one of the three elite naval schools from the age of 12, the fixed-base HMS Conway and HMS Worcester or Pangbourne Nautical College, which would automatically lead to an apprenticeship as a seagoing cadet officer; apply to one of several training programmes elsewhere; or go to sea immediately by applying directly to a merchant shipping company at about age 17. Then there would be three years (with prior training or four years without) of seagoing experience aboard ship, in work-clothes and as mates with the deck crew, under the direction of the bo'sun cleaning bilges, chipping paint, polishing brass, cement washing freshwater tanks, and holystoning teak decks, and studying navigation and seamanship on the bridge in uniform, under the direction of an officer, before taking exams to become a second mate.\nHistorically, the composition of the crew on UK ships was diverse. This was a characteristic of the extant of the shipping companies trade, the extent of the British Empire and the availability of crew in different ports. One ship might have a largely all British crew, while another might have a crew composed of many Indians, Chinese or African sailors. Crews from outside Britain were usually drawn from areas in which the ship traded, so Far East trading ships had either Singapore or Hong Kong crews, banana boats had West Indian crews, ships trading to West Africa and Southern Africa had African crews and ships trading to the Indian Ocean (including East Africa) had crews from the Indian subcontinent. Crews made up of recruits from Britain itself were commonly used on ships trading across the North Atlantic, to South America and to Australia and New Zealand.\nMerchant Navy today\nFleet\nDespite maintaining its dominant position for many decades, the decline of the British Empire, the rise of the use of the flag of convenience, and foreign competition led to the decline of the merchant fleet. For example, in 1939 the Merchant Navy was the largest in the world with 33% of total tonnage. By 2012, the Merchant Navy – while still remaining one of the largest in the world – held only 3% of total tonnage.\nIn 2010 the Merchant Navy consisted of 504 UK registered ships of  or over. In addition, UK merchant marine interests possessed a further 308 ships registered in other countries and 271 foreign-owned ships were registered in the UK.\nIn 2012 British merchant marine interests consisted of 1,504 ships of  or over. This included ships either directly UK-owned, parent-owned or managed by a British company. This amounted to:  or alternatively . This is according to the annual maritime shipping statistics provided by the British Government and the Department for Transport. In the last decade, ship numbers have continued to decline. In 2023, the British Ship Register had reduced to 1,054 ships.\nOfficers and ratings\nin Southampton, with former First Sea Lord Alan West, Baron West of Spithead, in 2011.]]\nAs a signatory to the STCW Convention UK ships are commanded by deck officers and engineering officers. Officers undergo 3 years of training, known as a cadetship at one of the approved maritime colleges in the United Kingdom. These include Warsash Maritime Academy, South Tyneside College, Fleetwood, Plymouth University and City of Glasgow College. Cadets usually have a choice of two academic routes: Foundation Degree or Higher National Diploma. Successful completion of this results in a qualification in marine operations or marine engineering. Generally the costs of a cadetship will be met by sponsorship from a UK shipping company. During the three years of training, cadets also go to sea, for a period of a year or more, usually spread across the cadetship. This affords a practical education, that along with the academic time in college prepares a candidate for a separate and final oral exam. This oral exam is carried out with a master mariner at an office of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Successful completion of the oral exam will result in the award of a certificate of competency. This is the international qualification, issued by the UK government which allows an officer to work in their qualified capacity on board a ship. Certificates are issued for different ranks and as such an officer will usually return to complete a subsequent series of studies until they reach the highest qualification.\nThe first UK deck officer certificates of competency were issued in 1845, conducted then, as now, by a final oral exam with a master mariner. The training regime for officers is set out in the official syllabus of the Merchant Navy Training Board. This training still encompasses all of the traditional trades such as celestial navigation, ship stability, general cargo and seamanship, but now includes training in business, legislation, law, and computerisation for deck officers and marine engineering principles, workshop technology, steam propulsion, motor (diesel) propulsion, auxiliaries, mechanics, thermodynamics, engineering drawing, ship construction, marine electrics as well as practical workshop training for engineering officers.\nTraditionally and still now, the ships ratings are supervised by the bosun, as overseen by a responsible deck officer, usually the chief mate. A ship may also have different sub-departments, such as the galley, radio department or hospitality services, overseen by a chief cook, radio officer or chief steward. Many of these roles have now changed, as ships crews have become smaller in commercial shipping. On most ships the radio department has disappeared, along with the radio officer (colloquially known as 'sparks') replaced by changes in technology and the requirement under the STCW Convention for deck officers to hold individual certification in the GMDSS system. Electro-technical officers (ETO) also serve aboard some ships and are trained to fix and maintain the more complex systems.\nIn 2023, the UK Merchant Navy had 10,930 certificated officers, 10,180 ratings, 1,450 merchant navy cadets and 1,540 other officers.\nCharities\nMerchant navy related charities are active in the UK. The Merchant Navy Welfare Board administers the MN fund for charitable support. Other charities include the Shipwrecked' Mariners Society, the Seafarer's Charity, the Scottish Nautical Welfare Society and the Scottish Shipping Benevolent Association.\nFlags\nEnsigns\nEnsigns are displayed at the stern of the vessel or displayed on the gaff, on a yardarm. Red Ensigns can be defaced, those can only be flown with a warrant on board the vessel. Bermuda (historically part of British North America, but left out of the Confederation of Canada) flies the red ensign also as a territorial flag on land, as did other British North American colonies that still do so as Provinces of modern Canada, including Ontario (other British Overseas Territories that fly a nautical ensign as the territorial flag on land use the Blue Ensign which in Bermuda is only flown from civil government vessels such as ferry boats).\nFile:British-Merchant-Navy-Ensign.png|Merchant Navy\nBritish Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies ensigns\nFile:Flag of Bermuda.svg|Bermuda\nFile:Civil Ensign of the British Virgin Islands.svg|British Virgin Islands\nFile:Civil Ensign of the Cayman Islands.svg|Cayman Islands\nFile:Civil Ensign of the Falkland Islands.svg|Falkland Islands\nFile:Civil Ensign of Gibraltar.svg|Gibraltar\nFile:Civil Ensign of Guernsey.svg|Guernsey\nFile:Civil Ensign of the Isle of Man.svg|Isle of Man\nFile:Civil Ensign of Jersey.svg|Jersey\nFile:Civil Ensign of the Turks and Caicos Islands.svg|Turks and Caicos Islands\nYacht club ensigns\nFile:HDC Original defaced Red Ensign.gif|Hamilton Dinghy Club\nFile:Ensign of the House of Commons Yacht Club.svg|House of Commons Yacht Club\nFile:Ensign of the Royal Dart Yacht Club.svg|Royal Dart Yacht Club\nFile:Ensign of the Royal Fowey Yacht Club.svg|Royal Fowey Yacht Club\nFile:RHADC defaced Red Ensign.svg|Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club\nFile:Ensign of the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club.svg|Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club\nFile:Red Ensign defaced with crown.svg|Royal Portsmouth Corinthian Yacht Club and the Royal St George Yacht Club\nFile:Ensign of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club.svg|Royal Victoria Yacht Club\nFile:Ensign of the Royal Windermere Yacht Club.svg|Royal Windermere Yacht Club\nFile:RYA Ensign.png|Royal Yachting Association\nFile:Ensign of the St Helier Yacht Club.svg|St Helier Yacht Club\nFile:Ensign of the West Mersea Yacht Club.svg|West Mersea Yacht Club\nInstitution ensigns\nFile:Trinity House Ensign.svg|Trinity House\nFile:Ensign of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.svg|Royal National Lifeboat Institution\nFile:Red Ensign of the Maritime Volunteer Service.jpg|Maritime Volunteer Service\nFile:Company of Watermen and Lightermen Ensign.gif|Company of Watermen and Lightermen\nFile:UK NHS Fleet Ensign.svg|Ship of the National Historic Fleet\nFile:UK National Historic Ships Ensign.svg|Registered vessel of the National Historic Fleet\nHouse flags\nHouse flags are personal and designed by a company.

Canadian Philip Bent, ex-British Merchant Navy, joined the British Army at the outbreak of World War I and won the Victoria Cross. Members of the Merchant Navy who served in either World War also received relevant campaign medals.\nIn the Second World War many Merchant Navy members received the King's Commendation for Brave Conduct. Lloyd's of London awarded the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea to 541 Merchant Navy personnel for their bravery in 1939–45. Many Royal Humane Society medals and awards have been conferred on Merchant Navy seafarers for acts of humanity in both war and peacetime.\nIn September 2016 the UK Government introduced the Merchant Navy Medal for Meritorious Service. The medal is awarded:\n\"to those who are serving or have served in the Merchant Navy and fishing fleets of the UK, Isle of Man or Channel Islands for exemplary service and devotion to duty, rewarding those who have set an outstanding example to others.\"\nIt is the first state award for meritorious service in the history of the Merchant Navy. Recipients must be nominated by someone other than themselves, with at least two written letters of support and are normally required to have completed 20 years service in the Merchant Navy (although in exceptional circumstances it may be less).\nRanks\nThe insignia used today by the UK Merchant Navy varies from one company to the next.
