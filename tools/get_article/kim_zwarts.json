In 2001 Zwarts designed a facade motif for the glass and concrete walls of the Utrecht University Library in the Netherlands.\nKim Zwarts’ work has received national and international recognition in the form of the Kodak Award (1989) and the Werner Mantz Prize (1997). His work has been included in several public and private art collections.\nIn several of his work, for example Maastricht 148, Kim Zwarts selected the subjects of his pictures by drawing a grid over a specific area. The crossing points on the grid appear in the pictures.\nBibliography\n* K. Zwarts, Beyond, Maastricht 1997\n* K. Zwarts, Maastricht 148, Maastricht 2000\n* K.
