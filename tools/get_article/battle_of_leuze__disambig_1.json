He was also informed that Marshal Waldeck, who was left in charge, was preparing to retire into winter quarters.\nLuxembourg was near Tournai and sent out a reconnaissance under Marsilly, from whom he learned that the main body of the Allied army was retreating, leaving a rear-guard of cavalry, consisting of just 3,000 men, under the Count of Tilly at Leuze. Luxembourg acted immediately. He sent a detachment to follow the movements of the main body, and with the squadrons of Villars and Marsilly he attacked the smaller party without warning. The French cavalry charged, only using their swords.\nAs soon as Field Marshal Nassau-Saarbrücken-Usingen became aware of the French attack, he turned around with the entire left wing and tried to turn the tide. This further increased Allied losses, because the squadrons which rushed to the rescue did not all arrive on the battlefield at the same time, allowing the elite French troops to defeat them one by one. Troops under Overkirk, however, were finally able to chase off the French cavalry. Waldeck, meanwhile, rushed with the infantry to Leuze, but blew off the attack when Luxembourg saw him approaching.\nThe Allied infantry, including Mackay's Regiment also took part in the battle but did not see much action.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nDeschard B.
