It covers the more affluent part of the town south of the town centre. It stretches either side of Lavernock Road which includes Lower Penarth and Cosmeston (including Glamorganshire Golf Club and Cosmeston Lakes). The ward elects two county councillors to Vale of Glamorgan Council and four councillors to Penarth Town Council. A majority of its councillors represent the Conservative Party.\nThe name of the ward refers to Plymouth Road, and to the Earls of Plymouth, who were major landowners in the area.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the population of the ward was 5,836.\n{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 align=center style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Dinas Powys\n|Stanwell\n|St Augustine's\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Plymouth\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Sully\n|}\nBackground\nFollowing The County Borough of The Vale of Glamorgan (Electoral Changes) Order 2002 the county ward of Alexandra was divided to become St Augustine's and Plymouth wards, effective from October 2003 for preliminary electoral proceedings, but fully effective at the May 2004 Vale of Glamorgan Council elections.
