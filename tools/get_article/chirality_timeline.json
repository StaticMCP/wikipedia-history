This type of molecule is called chiral. In nature, one of these forms is usually more common than the other. In our cells, one of these mirror images of a molecule fits \"like a glove,\" while the other may be harmful.\nIn nature, molecules with chirality include hormones, DNA, antibodies, and enzymes. For example, (R)-limonene smells like oranges, while (S)-limonene smells like lemons. Both molecules have the same chemical formula, but their spatial orientations are different, which makes a big difference in their biological properties. Chiral molecules in the receptors in our noses can tell the difference between these things. Chirality affects biochemical reactions, and the way a drug works depends on what kind of enantiomer it is. Many drugs are chiral and it is important that the shape of the drug matches the shape of the cell receptor it is meant to affect. Mismatching will make the drug less effective, which could be a matter of life and death, as happened with thalidomide in the 1960s.\nIt has long been known that structural factors, particularly chirality and stereochemistry, have a big impact on pharmacological efficacy and pharmacokinetic behavior. Since more than a century ago, pertinent information pertaining to chirality has been accumulating in numerous fields, in particular, physics, chemistry and biology, at an accelerated rate, giving rise to more comprehensive and in-depth reasoning, conceptions, and ideas. This page offers a chronology of significant contributions that have been made in the journey of chirality [1809 to 2021].\nChirality timeline\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Timeline of contributions in the field of chirality\n!Year\n!Image\n!Name\n!Country\n!Contribution/Achievement\n!Ref\n|-\n|1809\n|\n|Étienne-Louis Malus\n|France\n|Discovery of plane polarized light;  Origin of stereochemistry\n|\n|-\n|1811\n|\n|Dominique François Jean Arago\n|France\n|Showed how cut crystals change the  plane of polarized light\n|\n|-\n|1812\n|\n|Jean-Baptiste Biot\n|France\n|Found that a quartz plate cut at a  right angle to its crystal axis rotates the plane of polarized light by an  angle that is proportional to the thickness of the plate. This is the  phenomenon of optical rotation\n|\n|-\n|1815\n|\n|Jean-Baptiste Biot\n|France\n|Applied these ideas to organic  substances, like oil of  turpentine, sugar, camphor, and  tartaric acid (solutions of solids)\n|\n|-\n|1820\n|\n|Eilhard Mitscherlich\n|German\n|Discovery of the phenomenon of crystallographic isomorphism. Correlated the similarity of crystal shapes with an analogy in chemical composition, reported that sodium ammonium salts of (+)-tartaric acid and racemic acids are completely isomorphous and are identical  in all aspects except in optical activity\n|\n|-\n|1848\n|\n|Louis Pasteur\n|France\n|The racemic sodium ammonium salt of  tartaric acid was crystallized, and two different types of crystals were  found.

Van't Hoff, who won the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1901, for discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions\"\n|\n|-\n|1874\n|\n|Joseph Achille Le Bel\n|France\n|Used asymmetry arguments and talked about the asymmetry of the molecules as a whole instead of the asymmetry of each carbon atom.
