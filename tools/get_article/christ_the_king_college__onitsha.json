It is ranked the top-ranked high school in Nigeria and 36th in the top 100 best high schools in Africa as of February 2014.\nCKC was founded on February 2, 1933, by the late Archbishop Charles Heerey, CsSp, along with Fredrick Akpali Modebe and his wife Margret, who (like in the other schools they founded) not only provided the land, but also built the first administration block and the first hostel accommodation. Heerey remained the proprietor of the school until his death in the spring of 1967.\nThe chief mission of the school is to develop indigenous manpower and leadership skills from the vast pool of Nigerian youths and in a Catholic tradition and environment. The first principal of the college was Fr Leo Brolly.\nHistory\nCKC was affected adversely by the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970). Most of its infrastructure was destroyed. The school was taken over by the East Central State Government in 1973 and renamed \"Heerey High School\", after its founder. However, following representations by its alumni, the school's name was changed back to its original name, \"Christ The King College (CKC)\" in 1976, and the pre-war first indigenous principal of the school, Rev. Fr. Nicholas Tagbo, was also brought back that year to  reorganize, rebuild, and re-energize the school. CKC was finally returned to the Catholic Mission by the state government on 1 January 2009.\nThe school\nCKC is located on Oguta Road in Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria. Its motto is Bonitas, Disciplina, Scientia (Latin) (Goodness, Discipline, and Knowledge). As of February 2014, the school is currently ranked the number 1 (the best) high school in Nigeria,  and 36th in the top 100 best secondary schools in Africa. The school's colours are White and Royal Blue. The college has active alumni associations in Nigeria (Abuja, Benin-City, Enugu, Lagos, Onitsha, Owerri, and Port-Harcourt), and in the United States (\"Christ the King College Onitsha Alumni Association USA\").\nSchool population\nThroughout the years prior to the civil war, the school's population was pegged at 600 to ensure appropriate student/teacher ratio and high-quality education. After the civil war, in the 1970s, the student population ballooned to over 4,000. However, following years of reorganization, the school's student population is now 2,597, split between (Grades 7- 12); Junior Secondary School (1,350) and Senior Secondary School(1,247).\nSporting and extra-curricular activities\nThe school plays association football, track and field athletics, handball, hockey and lawn tennis. Its football (soccer) team won the World Secondary School Championship in Dublin, Ireland in 1977.\nHouses\nThe dormitories are classified as school houses for administration, management and sports competition purposes. The current houses are:  Tagbo, Brolly, Azikiwe, Heerey, Okagbue, Modebe, Arinze, Aniogu, Mbanefo, Orjiakor, Allagoa, Butler, and Flanagan.\nThe pre-civil war Houses were: St. Charles, St. Gabriel, St Williams, St Michael's, and St. Joseph.\nSchool publications\n*The X-Ray (Students)\n*Bonitas (Students)\n*The Amaka Gazette (Alumni)\n*Amaka's Voice (Alumni)\nList of principals\n*1st Rev Fr.
