Not long after in 1919, requested by then Minister Gevorg Karagyozyan, the Ministry would expand to include arts and antiquities.\nThis structure would follow into the Soviet period, when by decree of the ASSR Revolutionary Council the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment was established. Besides being renamed to the Ministry of Enlightenment, this system would persist until 1973. Afterwards, elements of the Ministry were formed into the Ministry of Higher and Vocational Education. This split would be reverted in 1988 by the ASSR Supreme Council, which resulted in the establishment of the Ministry of National Education. The Ministry of National Education did not last long though. Another ASSR Supreme Council decision in late 1990 led to the split into the Ministry of Enlightenment and State Committee for Higher Education and Science.\nFollowing Armenian independence and the formation of the Republic of Armenia, in 1992 the State Committee for Higher Education and Science was reorganized into the Ministry of Higher Education and Science. In 1995, the Ministry of Enlightenment and prior would be merged into the Ministry of Education and Science.\nMinistry of Culture\nThe history of the Ministry of Culture is more convoluted. Ultimately only being established in 1953 during the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, its sectors of authority and structure predated this formation.\nBefore the Ministry's establishment it was part of the predecessors of the Ministry of Education and Science. However, it is to be emphasized that the Ministry of Education and Science still precedes those structures. In the first year of the First Republic of Armenia's existence, there was no administrative body in charge of cultural affairs. Like stated in the section on the Ministry of Education and Science, this jurisdiction was added to it in 1919.\nEven into the Soviet administration, cultural affairs would stay departments of subsequent executive offices for education. This would change with the establishment of the Ministry of Culture in 1953. Given the task of implementation and management of affairs in the field of Culture, Enlightenment, Theatre, Music and Arts.\nBesides name changes and minor restructuring following Armenia's independence, the Ministry would persist until 2019.\nList\nFirst Republic of Armenia (1918–1920)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Minister\n!Term start\n!Term end\n!Head of Government\n|-\n|Mikayel Atabekyan\n|November\n|December\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hovhannes Kajaznuni\n|-\n|Gevorg Melik-Gharagyozyan\n|December\n|June\n|-\n|Sirakan Tigranyan\n|June\n|August\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Alexander Khatisian\n|-\n|Nikol Aghbalyan\n|August\n|May\n|-\n|Gevorg Ghazaryan\n|May 5, 1920\n|November 23, 1920\n|Hamo Ohanjanyan\n|-\n|Vahan Minakhoryan\n|November 23, 1920\n|2 December 1920\n|Simon Vratsyan\n|}\nSoviet Period (1920–1991)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Minister\n!Term start\n!Term end\n!Head of Government\n|-\n|Suren Mikayelyan\n|1949\n|1954\n|Sahak Karapetyan\n|-\n|Shavarsh Simonyan\n|1954\n|1973\n|Anton Kochinyan\n|-\n|Semyon Hakhumyan\n|1973\n|1988\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Grigory Arzumanyan\n|-\n|Lyudvig Gharibjanyan\n|1975\n|1988\n|-\n|Semyon Hakhumyan\n|1988\n|1989\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Vladimir Markaryants\n|-\n|Misak Davtyan\n|1989\n|1990\n|-\n|Vilik Harutyunyan\n|1990\n|1991\n|Vazgen Manukyan\n|-\n|Areg Grigoryan\n|1990\n|1992\n|Vazgen Manukyan\nGagik Harutyunyan\n|}\nThird Republic of Armenia (1991–present)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Minister\n!Term start\n!Term end\n!Prime Minister\n|-\n|Vardges Gnuni\n|1991\n|1991\n|Vazgen Manukyan\nGagik Harutyunyan\nKhosrov Harutyunyan\nHrant Bagratyan\n|-\n|Hayk Ghazaryan\n|1992\n|1994\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Hrant Bagratyan\n|-\n|Ashot Bleyan\n|1994\n|1995\n|-\n|Armenak Ghazaryan\n|1995\n|1995\n|-\n|Vardges Gnuni\n|1996\n|1996\n|Armen Sarkissian\n|-\n|Artashes Petrosyan\n|1996\n|1998\n|Armen Sarkissian\nRobert Kocharyan\n|-\n|Levon Mkrtchyan\n|1998\n|1999\n|Robert Kocharyan\nArmen Darbinyan\n|-\n|Eduard Ghazaryan\n|1999\n|2001\n|Vazgen Sargsyan\nAram Sargsyan\nAndranik Margaryan\n|-\n|Levon Mkrtchyan\n|2001\n|2003\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Andranik Margaryan\n|-\n|Sergo Yeritsyan\n|2003\n|2006\n|-\n|Levon Mkrtchyan\n|2006\n|2008\n|Serzh Sargsyan\n|-\n|Spartak Seyranyan\n|2008\n|2009\n|Tigran Sargsyan\n|-\n|Armen Ashotyan\n|2009\n|2016\n|Tigran Sargsyan\nHovik Abrahamyan\n|-\n|Levon Mkrtchyan\n|2016\n|2018\n|Karen Karapetyan\nSerzh Sargsyan\n|-\n|Arayik Harutyunyan\n|2018\n|2019\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Nikol Pashinyan\n|-\n|Arayik Harutyunyan\n|2019\n|2020\n|-\n|Vahram Dumanyan\n|2020\n|2022\n|-\n|Zhanna Andreasyan\n|December 2022\n|Incumbent\n|}\nName changes\nBefore the 2019 merger, both ministries experienced several name changes.
