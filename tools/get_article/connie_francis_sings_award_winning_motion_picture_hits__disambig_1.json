Between April 26 and 28, Francis spent three days in Rome, recording a set of thirteen songs intended for an album of  Academy Award-winning songs:\n*\"All the Way\" from The Joker Is Wild (1957)\n*\"Buttons and Bows\" from The Paleface (1948)\n*\"High Hopes\" from A Hole in the Head (1959)\n*\"Lullaby of Broadway\" from Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935)\n*\"Moon River\" from ''Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)\n*\"Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz (1939)\n*\"The Last Time I Saw Paris\" from Lady Be Good (1941)\n*\"The Way You Look Tonight\" from Swing Time (1936)\n*\"Secret Love\" from Calamity Jane (1953)\n*\"Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Qué Será, Será)\" from The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)\n*\"When You Wish upon a Star\" from Pinocchio'' (1940)\n*\"You'll Never Know\" from Hello, Frisco, Hello (1943)\n*\"Zip-a-Dee-Dooh-Dah\" from Song of the South (1946)\nThe playbacks to these songs had been pre-recorded at EMI's famous Abbey Road Studios in London under the supervision of Francis' British producer Norman Newell and were conducted by Geoff Love. The tapes of these playbacks had been shipped to Rome, where Francis overdubbed her vocals at RCA Italiana Studios. Francis was unsatisfied with the results and it was decided to postpone the album's release which had originally been planned for early summer of 1962.\nThe album remained in the vaults until March 1963. When Francis decided to record the winning song from the 1963 Academy Award ceremony, \"Days of Wine and Roses,\" plans were made to include this recording to the set of songs from the 1962 sessions. Yet, Francis still was not satisfied with the whole album and asked orchestra leader Don Costa - who had arranged and conducted her # 1 hit \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" in November 1961 and was also in charge of Francis' recording of \"Days of Wine and Roses\" -  to create and record new playbacks for the 1962 recordings while keeping Francis' original vocals.\nBetween March 15 and April 4, 1963, Costa recorded new playbacks to twelve of the thirteen songs; some of them even underwent a second treatment until Francis was finally satisfied with the results. The recording of \"Over the Rainbow\" was heavily edited by removing the repetition of the second verse and cutting down its running time from 3:46 minutes to 2:38 minutes. One track, however, was left untouched, \"Buttons and Bows\" from the motion picture The Paleface, and remained completely unreleased until 1996.\nThe remaining twelve songs were combined with \"Days of Wine and Roses,\" and the album was finally released in May 1963 in the U. S. as MGM Records 12\" Album SE-4048 (stereo) and E-4048 (mono).\nIn Australia (Cat.-No. S 027592) and New Zealand (Cat.-No. MCS 5017), though, it came to a mix-up of mastertapes. Here the original 1962 recordings from Rome were released with Days of Wine and Roses missing.\nIn Brazil, the album was released under the title Connie Francis canta Témas premiadas do Cinema''. It featured the same track listing as the U. S. edition.\nTrack listing US-Edition with new 1963 Playbacks\nSide A\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!#\n!Title\n!Songwriter\n!Length\n|- bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\"\n|-\n| 1. || \"Days of Wine and Roses\" || Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer || 3.00\n|-\n| 2. || \"Secret Love\" || Sammy Fain, Paul Francis Webster || 2.50\n|-\n| 3. || \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" || Allie Wrubel, Ray Gilbert || 1.38\n|-\n| 4. || \"When You Wish upon a Star\" || Leigh Harline, Ned Washington || 3.10\n|-\n| 5. || \"Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)\" || Jay Livingston, Ray Evans || 2.23\n|-\n| 6. || \"Over the Rainbow\" || Harold Arlen, E.
