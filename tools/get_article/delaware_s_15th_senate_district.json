It has been represented by Republican Dave Lawson since 2011.\nGeography\nDistrict 15 covers much of Kent County to the west of Dover, including Cheswold, Felton, Kenton, Marydel, Hartly, Willow Grove, Petersburg, Sandtown, and part of Viola. It borders the state of Maryland.\nLike all districts in the state, the 15th Senate district is located entirely within Delaware's at-large congressional district. It overlaps with the 11th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 33rd districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 15th district holds elections in presidential years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of usual cycle.\n2020\n}}\n2016\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Trump 53.4 – 44.9%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Trump 56.3 – 38.8%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Wade 52.2 – 45.8%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Romney 51.9 – 46.6%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 58.3 – 37.4%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 58.3 – 39.4%\n|}\nReferences"
