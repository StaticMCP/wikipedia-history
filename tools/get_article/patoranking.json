Born and raised in Ebute Metta community of Lagos, he grew up sharing one room with his parents and five siblings.

Whilst signed to Black Rhythmz Entertainment, he was working at a restaurant opposite Frankies Osu and had another job at Accra Mall. After recording a few songs on Lanky's label, the relationship came to an end and he returned to Nigeria.\nUpon his return to Nigeria, Okorie joined K-Solo's Igberaga Records in 2012, where he recorded \"Iya Bisi\",  featuring Qdot and Kbaj.

In the aforementioned interview with Entertainment Express, he described his music as a morally inclined variation of dancehall and said it references socio-political issues.\nIt was not until 12 September 2013, that Okorie's life changed with the release of the audio and video for \"Alubarika\". The song literally translates to \"God's Blessings\" and features vocals from Timaya. The music video for \"Alubarika\" was shot by AJE Films and ran for 4 minutes and 16 seconds. According to an article posted by Victor Akande of The Nation, Patoranking described the song as a summary of his life as a musician and said it opened doors for him in terms of building a fan base and working with established musicians.\nIn February 2014, Patoranking signed a record deal with Foston Musik and ended his affiliations with Dem Mama Records. During an interview with Toolz on NdaniTV's The Juice, Timaya said Patoranking left his label and was never officially signed. On 4 February 2014, Patoranking released \"Girlie O\", a song produced by \"WizzyPro\". The music video for the song was shot and directed in London by Moe Musa; it was released on 5 February 2014.

The music video for \"Girlie O\" (Remix) was also shot and directed in London by Moe Musa. Joey Akan of Pulse Nigeria said, \"On the new remix, the basic winning elements were not discarded. They were retained and improved. The beat, chorus, and dynamism were held onto, and major work put into the lyrics.\"\nPatoranking was featured on Seyi Shay's \"Murda\" single alongside Shaydee. The song was produced by Dokta Frabz and released on 1 April 2014. On 11 May 2014, the music video for \"Murda\" was uploaded onto Vevo.
