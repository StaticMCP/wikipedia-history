In 1978 the New Castle County School District formed from 11 school districts in that county; however in 1981 it was divided into four school districts. Since 1981 Delaware has 19 school districts. In 2009 there were proposals to change the number of districts to three, one per county, to save costs, although various parents in the state preferred having local school districts so individual communities could have more influence over education.\nTable\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
