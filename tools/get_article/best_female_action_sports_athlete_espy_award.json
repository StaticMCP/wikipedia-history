It was first awarded as part of the ESPY Awards in 2004 after the non-gender-specific Best Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was presented the previous two years (with the American snowboarder Kelly Clark receiving the 2002 award). It is given to the female, irrespective of nationality or sport contested, adjudged to be the best action sports athlete in a given calendar year. Balloting for the award is undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It is conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months.\nThe inaugural winner of the award was the American wakeboarder Dallas Friday. During 2003 and 2004, Friday won 12 of the available 14 professional women's titles, including national and world championships. She became the first wakeboarder to be nominated for, and hence to win, an ESPY Award. Athletes from the United States have won more times than any other nationality with ten (three times to snowboarders Jamie Anderson and Chloe Kim), followed by Australians with three, two of which went to the surfer Stephanie Gilmore. Snowboarders are most successful sportspeople, with eleven awards, followed by surfers with four. It was not awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The most recent winner of the award was Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu in 2022.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Best Female Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award winners and nominees\n|-\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col  class=unsortable | Image\n! scope=col | Athlete\n! scope=col | Nation of citizenship\n! scope=col | Sport(s) regularly contested\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Nominees\n! scope=col class=unsortable |\n|-\n| 2004\n| –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Wakeboarding\n| align=left | Layne Beachley () – Surfing  Aleisha Cline () – Ski cross  Hannah Teter () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Surfing\n| align=left | Karin Huttary () – Ski cross  Janna Meyen () – Snowboarding  Hannah Teter () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe)\n| align=left | Gretchen Bleiler () – Snowboarding  Cara-Beth Burnside () – Skateboarding  Dallas Friday () – Wakeboarding   Janna Meyen () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Freestyle skiing\n| align=left | Jamie Anderson () – Snowboarding  Layne Beachley () – Surfing  Torah Bright () – Snowboarding    Elissa Steamer () – Skateboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe, slopestyle)\n| align=left | Stephanie Gilmore () – Surfing  Lindsey Jacobellis () – Snowboarding  Jessica Patterson () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Surfing\n| align=left | Torah Bright () – Snowboarding  Sarah Burke () – Freestyle skiing  Ashley Fiolek () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe)\n| align=left | Ashley Fiolek () – Motocross  Stephanie Gilmore () – Surfing  Jen Hudak () – Freestyle skiing   Ashleigh McIvor () – Freestyle skiing\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Surfing\n| align=left | Sarah Burke () – Freestyle skiing  Kelly Clark () – Snowboarding  Ashley Fiolek () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n| align=left | Kelly Clark () – Snowboarding  Carissa Moore () – Surfing  Kaya Turski () – Freestyle skiing\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Surfing\n| align=left | Letícia Bufoni () – Skateboarding  Kelly Clark () – Snowboarding  Laia Sanz () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n| align=left | Maddie Bowman () – Freestyle skiing  Kelly Clark () – Snowboarding  Vicki Golden () – Motocross  Carissa Moore () – Surfing\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe)\n| align=left | Paige Alms () – Surfing  Stephanie Gilmore () – Surfing  Laia Sanz () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n| align=left | Keala Kennelly () – Surfing  Chloe Kim () – Snowboarding   Carissa Moore () – Surfing\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n| align=left | Lacey Baker () – Skateboarding  Kelly Sildaru () – Freestyle skiing  Tyler Wright () – Surfing\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n| align=left | Jamie Anderson () – Snowboarding  Stephanie Gilmore () – Surfing  Brighton Zeuner () – Skateboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n| align=left | Kelly Sildaru () – Skiing  Zoi Sadowski-Synnott () – Snowboarding  Stephanie Gilmore (} Surfing\n|\n|-\n| 2020\n| colspan=5 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|\n|-\n| 2021\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n| align=left | Eileen Gu () – Skiing  Carissa Moore () – Surfing  Zoi Sadowski-Synnott () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2022\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Freestyle skiing\n| align=left | Chloe Kim () – SnowboardingRayssa Leal () – SkateboardingZoi Sadowski-Synnott ( – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* List of sports awards honoring women\n* Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award\n* Laureus World Sports Award for Action Sportsperson of the Year\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
