      "text": "# Creative Democracy__disambig_2\n\n\"Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us\" is a 1939 essay by American philosopher John Dewey.  Dewey's essay was originally delivered as a speech by philosopher Horace Kallen on October 20, 1939, at a dinner in honor of Dewey's 80th birthday that he was unable to attend.  Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others.  Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a moral ideal requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves.  \"The task of democracy\", Dewey concludes, \"is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute.\"\nPublication history\n*Dewey, John. 1939.
