For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n12 & 13 Geo. 5\nThe fifth session of the 31st Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 7 February 1922 until 26 October 1922.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 12 & 13 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  and section seven of the Juries Act, 1918.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1921, and the Unemployed Workers' Dependants (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, otherwise to amend the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 and 1921, and to repeal the Unemployed Workers' Dependants (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  in connexion with the registration of electors, and to amend section fifty-four of the Local Government Act, 1888.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  the Settled Land Acts, 1882 to 1890, the Conveyancing Acts, 1881 to 1911, the Trustee Act, 1893, and the Land Transfer Acts, 1875 and 1897. }}\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  and to amend the law with respect to the application of dividends or interest on capital held in the said Company.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  so far as relates to the third special period mentioned in that Act.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|\n|  as respects offences under that section committed by bodies of persons.|note4= }}\n|  and for matters incidental thereto, and to make provision as to the calculation of average salary for the purposes of the said Act.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1918, as respects the acquisition of British nationality by persons born out of His Majesty's Dominions.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and for matters incidental thereto, and for the payment from the Consolidated Fund of deferred annuities in respect of contributions under the Elementary School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1898.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Act, 1914, to make further provision with regard to the sale of milk and for purposes connected therewith.}}\n|  }}\n|  and to repeal section five of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908. }}\n|  }}\n|  in respect of the relief or abatement to an owner of tithe rentcharge who holds more than one benefice.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Lanarkshire County Council.|note4=|po1=Lanarkshire County Council Order 1922|Provisional Order to authorise the district committee of the Middle Ward of the county of Lanark to construct additional waterworks to extend the time for the completion of authorised works to amend the Lanarkshire (Middle Ward District) Water Acts 1892 to 1917 to enable the County Council of the said county to borrow additional money to provide for the purchase by the County Council of the undertaking of the Bothwell and Uddingston Gas Company Limited to amend the Lanarkshire Gas Orders 1914 and 1917 to apply to the said county certain provisions of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Acts 1892 and 1903 and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Stirling Corporation (Water &c.).|po1=Stirling Corporation (Water, &c.)
