The 2008 Marvel film, Punisher: War Zone was loosely based on the series.\nPublication history\nThe first installment of the series ran for 41 issues and two 64-page annuals. Multiple writers contributed to this series during its three-year run from 1992 to 1995. The series served mainly as a vehicle for longtime Marvel artist John Romita Jr., who had returned to Marvel after a lengthy hiatus from drawing a monthly title. In 2009, Marvel published a 6-issue limited series under the same title. The storyline was called \"The Resurrection of Ma Gnucci\".\nVolume 1\nThe first series was the third different Punisher title published and the second spin-off based on the character.\nVolume 2\nThis series was written by long-time Punisher writer Garth Ennis and drawn by long-time Punisher artist Steve Dillon. The series is a follow-up to Ennis's other Marvel Knights Punisher series.\nVolume 3\nThis series was written by Greg Rucka and is a follow-up of Rucka's previous Punisher series from 2011. It was written to complete the story which Rucka did not get to do in the main title due to its cancellation.\nCollected editions\n* The Punisher: War Zone, Vol. 1 (collects The Punisher War Zone #1-6), September 2002,\n* The Punisher: Barbarian with a Gun (collects The Punisher War Zone #26-30), November 2008,\n* The Punisher: River of Blood (collects The Punisher War Zone #31-36), December 2005,\n* Punisher: War Zone - The Resurrection of Ma Gnucci (collects Punisher: War Zone vol. 2, #1-6), April 2009,  (HC), August 2009,  (TPB)\n* Punisher: Enter the War Zone (Collects Punisher: War Zone Vol. 3 #1-5), June 2013,\nSee also\n* 1992 in comics\n* 2013 in comics\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
