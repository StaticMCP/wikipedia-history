Early versions were based on Slackware, but it later became an independently developed distribution. Frugalware makes use of the Pacman package management system from Arch Linux.\nHistory\nFrugalware was founded in 2004 by Miklós Vajna. He considered Slackware's package manager pkgtools too slow, and wanted to rewrite it in C. He was told that it would never be accepted by Slackware, so Vajna started to think about founding a separate Linux distribution. He replaced Slackware's original init scripts and build system, and added Pacman, the package manager from Arch Linux. As a result, Frugalware was born.\nThe project announced it would be shutting down and discontinuing its distribution end of year 2025.\nPackage management\nSince version 0.6 Frugalware has used the Pacman-G2 package manager. It is a fork of a CVS version of the complete rewrite of Pacman by Aurelien Foret, which was not officially released at the time. Previously Frugalware used a modified version of the older, monolithic Pacman by Judd Vinet.\nFrugalware's packages' extension is .fpm. The packages are archives that are compressed using xz.\nRepoman is a tool to compile source packages and automatically create and install closed-source packages. With Repoman, the user can also download all packages' buildscript and recompile them with specific build options. The build options can be changed by editing a configuration file. The first Frugalware release that had Repoman was Frugalware 0.3pre1.\nBranches\nFrugalware has a -current and a -stable branch. The -current branch is updated daily, and the -stable branch gets updated every 6 months.\nArchitectures\nFrom the official web site, 2012: \"Frugalware currently supports x86 (Pentium Pro or higher) and x86_64 (k8, aka. amd64) platforms\".\nReleases\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
