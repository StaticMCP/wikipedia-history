As the number of appeals heard by the Supreme Court of Canada is extremely limited, the Court of Appeal is in practice the court of final appeal for most residents of Prince Edward Island.\nThe Court is composed of three judges, led by the Chief Justice of Prince Edward Island, currently David H. Jenkins. At any given time there may be one or more additional justices who sit as supernumerary justices.\nThe Court of Appeal derives its jurisdiction from Prince Edward Island's [http://www.gov.pe.ca/law/statutes/pdf/J-02-1.pdf Judicature Act], enacted in its current form in 2008.\nHistory and functions\nPrior to 2008 reforms that were formally implemented in 2009, the senior appellate body in Prince Edward Island was the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island (Appeal Division).  With the passage of the Judicature Act, the Supreme Court was stripped of its appellate functions, now assigned to the Court of Appeal, while the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island remained as a single-division superior court.  All members of the former Appeal Division became the justices of the Court of Appeal.\nThe Court of Appeals hears appeals from the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island on indictable criminal matters as well as appeals from decisions made by the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island.\nThe Appeal Division sits in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in the Sir Louis Henry Davies Law Courts.\nPursuant to the Constitution Act, 1867, the Court of Appeal is operated by the provincial government, while its justices are appointed by the Governor General of Canada, on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada.\nCurrent membership\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
