His grandfather was the diplomat Edward Thornton, 2nd Count of Cacilhas; on his grandfather's death in 1906, Thornton succeeded to the title as 3rd Count of Cacilhas (also \"Cassilhas\") due to his father's death two years earlier.\nCareer\nThornton served during the First World War with the Royal Fusiliers, holding the rank of temporary lieutenant in August 1916. He was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in November 1916, as an observer with the rank of flying officer. He was promoted to the rank of captain in September 1918, by which point the Royal Flying Corps had been amalgamated into th newly formed Royal Air Force, along with the Royal Naval Air Service.\nHe remained in the Royal Air Force into the 1940s, serving during the Second World War, during which he retired in March 1945, retaining the rank of group captain.\nCricket career\nFollowing the war, he made one appearance in first-class cricket for the Combined Services cricket team against Essex at Leyton in 1921. Batting twice in the match, Thornton scored 21 runs in the Combined Services first-innings, before being dismissed by Joseph Dixon, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by the same bowler for 38 runs.\nPersonal life\nIn 1922, Thornton married Marjorie Gabriel Pike, daughter of W. R. Pike; they had three sons - Edward Peter, Christopher, and David - and a daughter, (Marjorie) Jean, who married Royal Navy lieutenant Ralph Carnac Baker Stallard-Penoyre (1913-1943), of a landed gentry family of Herefordshire. He was killed in the explosion of HMS Dasher (D37), and is memorialised at Ardrossan.\nThornton died at Stockport in October 1970.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
