The station, situated  east of Liverpool Lime Street, serves the civil parish of Great Sankey, Warrington in Cheshire, England. It is owned by Network Rail and managed by Northern Trains.\nIt is served by bus services and has parking for 287 cars. The station is located west of Warrington on the existing southern Liverpool–Manchester line, between  and Warrington Central.\nHistory\nWarrington Borough Council applied for funding from the Government's New Stations Fund but the bid failed. However, the council secured part of the funding through other sources and a planning application was approved in 2015, and it was hoped that construction could begin in 2016, until Network Rail increased the estimated cost by £4 million. A fresh bid to the New Stations Fund was successful, and the station opened on 16 December 2019.\nServices\nServices at Warrington West are operated by Northern Trains and TransPennine Express.\nAs of December 2022, the station is served by an hourly stopping service between  and , as well as an hourly service between  and Liverpool Lime Street which runs semi-fast from Warrington West.
