The brigade was formed in 2014 in response to the beginning of the War in Donbas.\nHistory\nWar in Donbas\nOn July 27, 2014, the 14th Special Purpose Regiment was reorganized into the 1st Operational Brigade, with significantly improved equipment. It became the first national guard brigade to receive armoured vehicles and howitzers.\nThe brigade participated in several battles during the War in Donbas, mainly in Krasnyi Lyman and Ilovaisk. During the second battle, the brigade held positions near Komsomolske (now Kalmiuske).\nInterwar\nOn August 31, 2015, opposition parties organized a rally outside the Verkhovna Rada calling for administrative decentralization, and the 1st Operational Brigade were sent to maintain order. The protest turned violent as grenades were thrown at the brigade's members. More than 50 were wounded and 4 died after the incident.\nOn August 23, 2017, by Presidential Decree No. 232/2017, the brigade was honored with the title \"Presidential Brigade \"Hetman Petro Doroshenko\"\".\nOn February 17, 2022, the 1st Operational Brigade and the national police took control of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Station.\nAccording to the calculations of the \"Book of Remembrance of the Fallen\", the brigade lost at least 6 soldiers in the War in Donbas before the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nOn February 24, 2022, once the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, the 1st Operational Brigade began defending the capital of Kyiv in the Battle of Kyiv. On March 15–16, during the Battle of Moshchun, 6 soldiers from this brigade were killed in action.\nAfter successfully defending Kyiv, the brigade was then transferred to the Battle of Donbas in summer 2022. They participated especially for the major battles in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. By late 2022, the brigade was then transferred to help the fight in the Battle of Bakhmut.\nIn January 2023, the brigade became an \"Offensive Guard\" brigade, used specifically for military offensives. By spring, the brigade was engaged in the defense of Luhansk Oblast, specifically in the village of Bilohorivka. They also fought in the area of the Serebriansky forest near the city of Kreminna.\nOn March 26, 2024, the 1st Operational Brigade received the honorary award \"За мужність та відвагу\" by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nUnits of the brigade, including its \"Forpost\" and \"Khoryv\" battalions, operated in the Serebriansky forest in August 2024.\nIn February and March 2025, the brigade was operating on the Kupiansk front in the Kharkiv Oblast. The brigade continued operating on the Kupiansk front in May.\nStructure\n* 1st Presidential Operational Brigade named after Hetman Petro Doroshenko \"Bureviy\"\n**  Brigade's Headquarters\n**  Kulchitskyi Battalion\n*** 1st Company\n*** 2nd Company\n*** 3rd Company\n**  2nd Battalion of Operational Assignment\n** 1st Guardsmen Battalion\n** 3rd Guardsmen Battalion\n**  Artillery Battalion\n**   Anti-Aircraft Defense Battalion\n**\n**  2nd Operational Battalion \"Irbis\"\n**  3rd Operational Battalion \"Groza\"\n**  4th Operational Battalion \"Khoryv\", commander - Colonel\n**  5th Operational Battalion \"Bastion\"\n**  Unmanned Systems Battalion\n** anti-aircraft UAV battery «Skyfall»\n** артилерійський дивізіон\n** anti-aircraft missile and artillery division\n** tank company\n** Rifle Company (Reserve), 2016\n**   Special Forces Sniper Company \"Bekas Company\"\n** reconnaissance technical equipment unit \"Zaichiky Circassia\"\n** support battalion\n** motor transport battalion\n**  medical company\n** canine company\n** orchestra\nGallery\nImage:President on the 10th anniversary of the National Guard of Ukraine The National Guard has become indispensable in the fight against Russian aggression at the front and in maintaining security in the rear.
