For nearly a century, the IEEE Awards Program has paid tribute to technical professionals whose exceptional achievements and outstanding contributions have made a lasting impact on technology, society and the engineering profession. The IEEE Medals and IEEE Technical Field Awards are institution-level awards. They are considered more prestigious than IEEE Society level awards and are administered by IEEE Awards Board. Each year, the IEEE Board of Directors approved the winners of these prestigious medals and awards at their annual board meeting. An IEEE Honors Ceremony is organized and held in New York each year to present the medals and awards to the recipients.\nFunds for the awards program, other than those provided by corporate sponsors for some awards, are administered by the IEEE Foundation.\nIEEE Medals\n* IEEE top medal and highest honor\n** IEEE Medal of Honor\n* Medals not specific to a technology field\n** IEEE Edison Medal (IEEE's principal medal for a meritorious career)\n** IEEE Founders Medal (for leadership, planning, and administration)\n** IEEE Mildred Dresselhaus Medal (for carbon-based materials research)\n** IEEE James H.

The fellowship is awarded annually to a first year, full-time graduate student obtaining their masters for work in the area of electrical engineering, at an engineering school/program of recognized standing worldwide.\n* IEEE Charles LeGeyt Fortescue Graduate Scholarship was established by the IRE in 1939 to commemorate Charles Legeyt Fortescue's contributions to electrical engineering. The scholarship is awarded for one year of full-time graduate work obtaining their masters in electrical engineering an ANE engineering school of recognized standing in the United States.\nAwards at the society and technical council level\nThe IEEE societies (of which there are 39 as of June 2020) and IEEE technical councils (seven as of June 2020) also have their own award programs. These include recognizing volunteers at the society technical committee levels and conference levels, for service and for technical work. However, IEEE institution level awards are above IEEE societies and technical council level awards, with higher standards, recognition, and prestige.\nStudent activities\nIEEE offers many student awards, competitions and other opportunities for students to become actively involved.\n* IEEEXtreme Programming Competition\n* IEEEmadC\nReferences"
