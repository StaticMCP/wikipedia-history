It is the cathedral church of the Diocese of Kingstown.\nIts history dates back to a first structure erected in stages from 1823 although the present building was completed in the 1930s decade. It was declared Co-cathedral of the Diocese of Bridgetown-Kingstown in 1971 and since 1989 is Kingstown's Cathedral. It stands out for its striking architecture which is a combination of styles (Moorish, Romanesque, Byzantine, Venetian and Flemish)  that strongly contrasts with the rest of the city.\nIt is under the pastoral responsibility of Bishop Gerard County.\nSee also\n*Roman Catholicism in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n*Assumption Cathedral\nReferences"
