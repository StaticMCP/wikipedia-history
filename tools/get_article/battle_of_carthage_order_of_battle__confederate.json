Among these a contingent of 150 mounted troops under the command of Capt. Jo Shelby distinguished themselves on the vanguard of the Southern action throughout the battle. From daring battlefield maneuvers under fire by Sigel's batteries to pressing Sigel's retreat to Sarcoxie, Shelby's cavalry \"snatched the victory at Carthage from Sigel's grasp.\" Altogether, the Missouri State Guard included over 2,000 unarmed men who did not participate in the battle.\nSee also\n* Missouri in the American Civil War\nReferences\n* Hinze, David C. & Karen Farnham.
