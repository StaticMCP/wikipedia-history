The winds must not be directly associated with a tropical cyclone, or a hurricane warning will be issued. If winds are lighter than 64 knots, a storm warning or gale warning will be issued. The hurricane force wind warning is only used to warn of the possibility of wind which reaches hurricane-level severity, but lacks direct connection with a hurricane system. The hurricane force wind can either signal sustained winds of 64 knots, or gusts of 64 knots lasting for two or more hours.\nIn US maritime warning flag systems, two red square flags with a black square taking up the middle ninth of each flag is used to indicate a hurricane force wind warning (the use of one such flag denotes a storm warning or a tropical storm warning). The flags used to denote hurricane force winds are also used to warn of incoming hurricanes.\nExample\nURGENT - MARINE WEATHER MESSAGE\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE PORTLAND OR\n249 AM PDT MON MAR 12 2012\nPZZ255-275-121800-\n/O.CON.KPQR.HF.W.0002.000000T0000Z-120313T0100Z/\nCOASTAL WATERS FROM CASCADE HEAD TO FLORENCE OR OUT 10 NM-\nWATERS FROM CASCADE HEAD TO FLORENCE OR FROM 10 TO 60 NM-\n249 AM PDT MON MAR 12 2012\n...HURRICANE FORCE WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM PDT\nTHIS EVENING...\nA HURRICANE FORCE WIND WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 6 PM PDT\nTHIS EVENING.\n* WINDS...SOUTH WIND 40 TO 50 KT WITH GUSTS TO 70 KT EXPECTED TO\nPEAK MONDAY MORNING OVER THE OUTER WATERS...WITH LOCAL GUSTS TO\n75 KT POSSIBLE OVER THE INNER WATERS MONDAY LATE MORNING AND\nEARLY AFTERNOON.\n* SEAS....COMBINED SEAS WILL REACH 28 TO 30 FEET EARLY MONDAY\nMORNING...POSSIBLY HIGHER...THEN EASE TO AROUND 20 FEET BY\nEARLY MONDAY EVENING.
