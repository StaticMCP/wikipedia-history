In the , the locality of Laidley had a population of 3,809 people.\nGeography\nLaidley is situated within the Lockyer Valley of South East Queensland east of the Great Dividing Range and close to the northern foothills of the Main Range. The town is located  west of Brisbane, the state capital, and  east of Toowoomba. The Warrego Highway (A2) is around  to the north, and the town sits on the Brisbane–Charleville railway line. Laidley–Plainland Road exits to the north.\nLaidley lies within the Lockyer Creek catchment, with the creek rising at the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range and flowing east. The catchment has an area of approximately  and elevations range from 1,100m AHD on the Great Dividing Range to 24m AHD at the confluence with the Brisbane River.\nThe relatively flat topography of the valley, its rich alluvial soils and warm climate are the basis for the Lockyer Valley to have become a major supplier of vegetables, horticulture and grains. The local industry has been dominated by agriculture since the end of the 19th century, producing 35% of Queensland's vegetable supply, and Laidley has long regarded itself as \"Queensland's Country Garden\". Fruit and vegetable production features prominently, the most commonly grown vegetable crops being carrots, potatoes, the brassica vegetables (e.g. cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower), pumpkins, corns and beans. Much of the beetroot grown in Australia comes from the Laidley district.\nHistory\n, 2015]]\nThe Laidley region was once home to the \"Kitabul People\" before the arrival of Europeans in the early 19th century. Today, the Ugarapul People are the traditional owners of the Lockyer Valley region.\nIn 1829, Allan Cunningham explored the area and named it Laidley Plains on 22 June 1829, after James Laidley, the Deputy Commissary General of the colony of New South Wales.\nThe town developed around a wagon stop on the main road route between Ipswich and Toowoomba. A stop was needed after the climb over the small Little Liverpool Range west of Marburg.\nBy the 1850s, the area was being cleared for sheep grazing.

A Travelling Post Office service ran on the Main Line between Brisbane and Toowoomba between 1877 and 1932.\nSince 1863, police officers have been stationed in Laidley. The first two police officers who served at Laidley are believed to have been Acting Sergeant William Gunn from 1863 to 1868 and Constable Thomas Raleigh from 1863 to 1865. Since 2015, the Police Station is housed in a refurbished building on Spicer Street. The building was originally the Laidley Courthouse and Public Offices, opened in 1964, housing the Courthouse, State Government offices and the Police.\nThe first Presbyterian service were held in Laidley in 1864 by William Lambie Nelson.\nIn the mid-1860s, the railway line from Grandchester stopped at a railway station  north of the town.

It was designed by architect FDG Stanley. By 1888 there were a number of additions including a parsonage, a tower and a bell. In May 1909 it was announced that a new church would be built from reinforced concrete at an estimated cost of £800 and would be designed by Messers James Marks and Co, architects in Toowoomba. A call for tenders to construct the church was made in September 1909. The foundation stone was laid on 15 November 1909 by Archdeacon Arthur Rivers.

It was moved in 1922 to its current site between Spicer Street and William Street where it reopened on 23 June 1923. Old meeting minutes tell that a committee had started talks for a local hospital in 1898. An official book of minutes had been kept since June 1912. In 2001, certain parts of the building complex were listed by Council in the EPA's Research Inventory of Historical Places (QCHIP).\nIn 1930, the Redeemer Lutheran Church was established at 7 MacGregor Street. In 1938, the Lutheran church at Blenheim was relocated to Laidley to be the Laidley Lutheran church hall.\nInitially, Laidley was served by the Blenheim Baptist Church. In July 1949, land was purchased near the Laidley Hospital for use by the Baptist church. In June 1952 the Blenheim Baptist Church was given permission to erect a Sunday School hall. The stump-capping ceremony for the hall was held on 5 July 1952, officiated by the President of the Queensland Baptist Union, Reverend R.O. Lockhart. On 7 September 1952, the hall (a combined church and hall) was officially opened. It was erected in 23 days using only volunteer labour. In February 1954, the hall was decided to be too small and that a separate church should be erected beside it, by demolishing the Blenheim Baptist Church, re-using the timber and relocating the church residence to Laidley. On 4 September 1954, the Laidley Baptist Church was officially opened by the President of the Queensland Baptist Union, Reverend F.T. Smith. The church building was at 25 Samuel Street and the hall at 27 Samuel Street. Both were sold into private ownership in August 2015 and March 2016 respectively. As at 2021, both buildings were still existing.\n, council chamber and chapel, April 2022]]\n, view from William Street, April 2022]]\nLaidley Pioneer Village and Museum was established in 1972 by the Laidley District Historical Society on the site of the original resting paddock used by horses of the Cobb & Co stagecoaches.
