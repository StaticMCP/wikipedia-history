The badge is a light blue Maltese cross with a Saint Edward's Crown in the centre of the cross. The flag dates from 1876, with minor variations, and the badge was designed by William Hemmant, the Colonial Secretary and Treasurer of Queensland in 1876.\nHistory\n1859 Separation Flag\nOn 10 December 1859 (also known as \"Proclamation Day\" in Queensland), over 180 days after Queensland's formal separation from the Colony of New South Wales, the Separation Flag was flown at 08:00 in Brisbane under a twenty-one gun salute, marking the proclamation of Queensland's separation from New South Wales. The flag was described as being sky blue with the St George's Cross and union in the corner. The flag was also known as the \"Moreton Bay Flag\".\nQueensland Separation Flag (1859)\n|File:Qld Sep.

As Queensland did not have a badge at this time, one depicting Queen Victoria on a blue disc surrounded by the name \"Queensland\" was suggested. However, this proved to be too difficult to reproduce, leading to new design being considered.\nProposed flag of Queensland (1870)\n|noborder=yes}}\n1876–1963\nAs the previous design was found to be unworkable, a new design was submitted to the Admiralty for approval:\nThe Maltese Cross impaled with the Crown was chosen out of four proposed designs to replace Victoria's head.\n1963 to present\nFollowing Queen Elizabeth II decision to use the Crown of St Edward as her royal cypher, in 1963 the State Emblem and the State flag was once again updated with the design of the crown following the preference of the monarch.\nKing Charles III decided to use the Tudor Crown on his royal cypher following his accession to the throne in 2022. However, the Queensland government stated on 4 May 2023 that they do not plan to update the crown on the state emblem or flag.\nGovernment distribution\nThe Queensland Government offers free state flags to eligible organisations including:\n* Schools\n* Recognised youth organisations\n* Community service groups\n* Charities\n* Sporting clubs\n* Local government authorities.\nSee also\n*Coat of arms of Queensland\n*List of Australian flags\n*Flags of the governors of the Australian states\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
