In September, the Germans set up a well-defended position south of the Dutumi River, some 15 miles east of Kisaki.\nThe 3rd Kashmir Rifles and the 57th Wilde's Rifles, followed by the 3rd King's African Rifles attacked the enemy on 10 September, but made little progress.\nOn the morning of 11 September, two companies of the 3rd King's African Rifles crossed the river, but were driven back by a German counterattack. The Gold Coast Regiment came up from reserve and joined the attack, but the German defense line remained intact.\nThe next morning the British vanguard found the German positions abandoned, and the pursuit was initiated. The British again encountered the Germans further south and another day of confused fighting in the dense vegetation followed.\nOn the morning of September 13th, the German troops had again disappeared, but now the exhausted British troops stopped the pursuit and occupied Kisaki on 14 September, where they only found sick and wounded Germans, who were left behind.\nReferences"
