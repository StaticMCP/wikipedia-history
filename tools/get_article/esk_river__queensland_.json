The Esk River enters the Annan Forest Reserve and flows through a wetland dominated by mangroves. At its mouth, the Esk River is joined by the Annan River and together discharge into Walker Bar and then onto the Coral Sea approximately  south of . The river descends  over its  course.\nMuch of the Esk River catchment lies within protected area tenure.  the river appeared to be in a healthy condition with limited siltation and only infrequent pockets of erosion.\nFloods in 1910 recorded the Esk River as  over the normal river height.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
