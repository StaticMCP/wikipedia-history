If he had only the Marathas to deal with, and the local population had been stable, he could have defended Malwa with relative ease. However, the situation was far more complex. Despite this, his first year in command demonstrated his effectiveness. His force of 10,000 seasoned soldiers, including well-equipped musketeers, artillery, and ample financial resources, helped restore some order. His reputation as an experienced commander from Aurangzeb's wars had preceded him, and he had capable lieutenants such as Chhatrasal Bundela and Budh Singh Hada. By the end of 1714, he had suppressed much of the disorder in Malwa. The Marathas, likely distracted by internal conflicts, refrained from launching any major raids that winter, and the local rebels, after facing swift punishment, either surrendered or went into hiding. Recognizing his success, the Emperor sent him a robe of honor on 13 August accompanied by a letter of appreciation that read, \"You have not left any trace of the robbers; travelers can now pass in peace.\"\nJai Singh had achieved this stability through relentless movement and decisive action. Just a week after reaching Ujjain, he launched a campaign against the Afghan chief Inayet, who had been pillaging near the city with a band of 7,000 horsemen. Jai Singh dispatched Nandlal Choudhuri to confront him, forcing the Afghans to retreat towards Shajahanpur. Later, Dilir Afghan was defeated near Kashigaon on 25 March 1714, and Mohan Singh, an Umat Rajput rebel aligned with Ruhela mercenaries, was killed on 14 April. In early May, Jai Singh sent a Bundela contingent under Chhatrasal's son to Khimlasa and Bhorasa, which prompted the Maratha camp south of the Narmada to abandon any plans of crossing into Malwa. Having dealt with these threats, he returned to Ujjain on 12 May.\nHowever, Malwa's volatile nature meant that this peace was neither absolute nor permanent. By August, highway robberies were reported near Narwar, necessitating the establishment of a military outpost. Meanwhile, Puranmal Ahir led a rebellion in the Ahir region, blocking the Sironj-Kalabagh road and using his fortresses at Ranod and Ondhera to challenge the administration for several months.\nJai Singh's next challenge arose at Rampura, near the Mewar frontier, where a succession dispute had been raging since Aurangzeb's time. On 24 January 1715, Gopal Singh Chandrawat, the rightful heir, managed to reclaim Rampura from Badan Singh, the son of his dispossessed father, Ratan Singh--who had been converted to Islam by Aurangzeb and renamed Islam Khan. Jai Singh supported Gopal Singh's claim and soon mediated a settlement between the old chief and his grandson, as the Afghan mercenaries hired in this family feud were wreaking havoc on the small principality.\nBattle\nThere were many troubles for Jai Singh II when he was the governor of Malwa, in order to deal with the turbulent bands of marauders, Jai Singh had maintained an army of 10,000 soldiers, which included the clansmen of Budh Singh Hada and Chatrasal Bundela. The army was well equipped and included a contingent of musketeers and artillery. Jai Singh had a good start in his governorship as there were no Maratha raids during the winters. Jai Singh took advantage of this and wiped out the local rebels and raiders. On 13 August 1714 the Emperor sent Jai Singh a Robe of Honour and said \"you have not left any trace of the robbers; travellers can now pass in peace\". Jai Singh also repelled the Afghan chieftain called Inayat, who was raiding Ujjain. On 25 March 1714 Jai Singh defeated Dilir Khan at Kashigaon and on 14 April he defeated Mohan Singh Umat and the Rohilla mercenaries. In 1715 Jai Singh expelled the Maratha raider called Ganga and then marched towards Sironj, where he defeated the Afghans. The Afghans under Dilir Khan called the Marathas for help against Jai Singh II. The Amber raja upon getting to know about the large host of Marathas that were approaching, quickly attacked Dilir. On 2 April, he attacked the Afghan army of 12,000 men and defeated them. 2000 Afghans were killed in battle while the Amber army lost 500 men. Jai Singh then turned towards the Afghan camp in Bhilsa and devastated it.\nIt was at this time that reports started coming about two large Maratha armies that had entered Malwa. Kanhoji Bhonsle and Khande Rao Dabhade with an army of 42,000 men had crossed the Narmada River on 1–2 April and had made their camps at Tilwara. they pillaged within 4 miles of the provincial capital and looted and burnt the city of Depalpur. On 5 April the Marathas sent an army of 12,000 horsemen to Barwah and they marched around Indore and demanded chauth from the province of Kampel. Upon knowing of these developments, Jai Singh quickly marched towards Ujjain and sent his deputy to secure his capital. On 8 May, the Amber Raja moved towards the Marathas, while the Maratha commanders, Kanho and Ganga were deciding how to cross Narmada with all the loot they had collected. Jai Singh force marched towards them crossing 38 miles and arrived before the Maratha camp on 10 May. The Marathas upon seeing the small Amber army became confident upon their numbers and advanced to fight them. The travel-worn Rajputs also advanced, Budh Singh Hada, Chatrasal Bundela, Dhiraj Singh Khichi and several minor Jagirdars were under the command of Jai Singh II. After a fight of four hours, the Marathas broke and started fleeing. The Marathas fled six miles away from the field of battle into the mountains of Pilsud and were confidently marching in the mountainous region, thinking that they had escaped. However Jai Singh chased them the whole night and caught up to them on 11 May. Upon seeing the Amber army, the Marathas fled to the Narmada River and left all of their loot.\nAftermath\nThe Maratha army were forced to leave two months worth of loot, that they had acquired from Malwa and Khandesh. Jai allowed his men to keep the spoils of war. \"everyone gained booty enough to feed him for years\". The emperor praised Jai Singh for his achievement and the local jagirdars confessed that no imperial officer had inflicted such a great victory in Malwa against the Marathas.\nReferences"
