The official title is 'His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates'.\nBefore the UAE was granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1971, each of the Trucial States was home to its own political deputation from the United Kingdom, with its own political officer or political agent heading the deputation. Of these deputations and political representatives, the oldest and most important was to the emir of Abu Dhabi, who was based in the city of Abu Dhabi, now the capital city of the UAE and the site of the modern British embassy.\nThe UK also maintains an embassy in Dubai, subordinate to the Abu Dhabi embassy, headed by a consul general.\nList of heads of mission\nPolitical officers in Abu Dhabi\n*1955–1958: Martin Buckmaster\n*1958–1959: Edric Worsnop\n*1959–1961: Edward Henderson\nPolitical agents in Abu Dhabi\n*1961–1965: Sir Hugh Boustead\n*1965–1968: Sir Archie Lamb\n*1968–1968: E.
