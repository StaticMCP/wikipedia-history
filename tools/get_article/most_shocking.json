Two spin-offs were made: Most Daring and Top 20 Countdown: Most Shocking.\nThe program held a TV-14 rating due to extremely violent situations depicted in the videos.\nSynopsis\nThe show generally features narrated video clips of criminal behavior, police pursuits, robberies, daring rescues, riots, and freak accidents caught on camera. The series mostly featured police and crime videos as a Court TV original, but would occasionally air footage or other events unrelated to crime. When the series was moved to TruTV, the show went all in on showing all kinds of shock footage.\nInternational broadcasts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Country !! TV Network(s) !! Series Premiere !!
