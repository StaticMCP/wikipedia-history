The award recognizes a pure or applied mathematician with a record of distinguished contributions to K-16 mathematics education in the United States or Canada and comes with a $5,000 award. Examples of significant contributions include, but are not limited to, the development of K-16 mathematics curriculum, educational technology, or programs to improve teaching or teacher preparation. The prize is funded by a grant established by mathematician, educator, and author Mary P.
