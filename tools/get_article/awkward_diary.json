On October 26, 2009, the band released the first single from the album, \"Crimson Baby\", which was dedicated to Neda Agha-Soltan and all those who died during the 2009 protests in Tehran. The track was selected as \"Track of the Day\" by Classic Rock magazine.\nReception\nSome critics were disappointed by the new electronic progressive post-rock approach rather than progressive metal of the previous albums. Metal Invader called it progressive trip hop while Insomniac Magazine wrote: “As a band, Ahoora frequently shifts gears between Heavy Metal, Groove Metal, Hard Rock, Alternative and Jazz melodic meanderings mixed in with synths and other varied instruments”.\nClassic Rock Magazine believed: “This shows some very nice touches. Imagine Muse and Tool getting all cozy around Iced Earth and you’ve got the drift here. The musicianship is accomplished, the songs concise and focused”.\nDMME.net described the album \"a lesson in stylistic restraint set against emotional expression.\" Rock Pulse described it as \"spanning genre and mood to great effect,\" stating that \"Ahoora have created a mature and thoughtful work that certainly warrants its place in the CD collection of adventurous listeners.\"\nIn a review for The Muse’s Muse, Cyros Rhodes described Awkward Diary as a highly original and experimental album that defies easy genre classification. He praised its rich sonic layering, musical independence, and unique personality, but also noted that its lack of commercial appeal, distant vocal mix, and broad stylistic scope might make it difficult for Western listeners to connect with. Rhodes concluded that “when the ride is over you will be dazzled by its originality, overwhelmed by its mystery, and mesmerized by its sheer uncontrollability.”\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAhoora\n*Milad Tangshir – guitars, backing vocals\n*Ashkan Hadavand – lead vocals\n*Mamy Baei – bass\nAdditional musicians\n*Farzad Golpayegani – guitar solo on tracks 4 & 11\n*Darren Motamedy – Saxophone on track 11\n*Parviz Norouzi – Saxophone on tracks 4 & 5\nProduction\n*Produced by Ahoora\n*Recorded & Mixed by Mamy Baei\n*Mastered by Farzad Golpayegani\nDesign\n*Front cover by Richard Baxter\n*Back cover by Mattijn Franssen\nReferences"
