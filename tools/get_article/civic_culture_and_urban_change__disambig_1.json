The first part describes the waxing and then waning influence of entrepreneurs in the mid-2th Century. Land development, law enforcement, and government-run education are covered in the subsequent two parts. The political machinations and the people in politics are covered in the fourth part. The author's advice on how to govern Dallas is in the fifth part.\nReception\nEdward J. Harpham of UT Dallas stated that he wished it was easier for a reader to process the amount of people to deal with, although Harpham believed that the issue pertained to Dallas politics instead of the book itself. Additionally, Harpham believed that ordering events by time would have been a better approach.\nSuzanne M. Leland of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the author, regarded the work as \"insightful and normative\".\nReferences\n*\n*\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://wsupress.wayne.edu/9780814330807/ Civic Culture and Urban Change: Governing Dallas]"
