      "text": "# IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award\n\nIn 1989, the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium established the Charles Babbage Award  to be given each year to a conference participant in recognition of exceptional contributions to the field. In almost all cases, the award is given to one of the invited keynote speakers at the conference. The selection was made by the steering committee chairs, upon recommendation from the Program Chair and General Chair who have been responsible for the technical program of the conference, including inviting the speakers. It is presented immediately following the selected speaker's presentation at the conference, and he or she is given a plaque that specifies the nature of their special contribution to the field that is being recognized by IPDPS.\nIn 2019, the management of the IEEE CS Babbage Award was transferred to the IEEE Computer Society's Awards Committee.\nPast recipients:\n*1989 - Irving S.
