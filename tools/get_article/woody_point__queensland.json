In the , Woody Point had a population of 4,548 people.\nAlong with its neighbouring coastal suburbs on the Redcliffe Peninsula, the suburb is a popular recreational destination within the Brisbane metropolitan area.\nGeography\nWoody Point is at the south-east of the Redcliffe Peninsula, approximately  by road north-northeast of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia.\nThe suburb is bounded by Moreton Bay to the east, Bramble Bay to the south, roughly by unnamed drain to the west and roughly by King Street to the north.\nThere are three headlands along the eastern coast of the suburb. At the southern tip is Woody Point (), also known as Ningeryoun, first marked on a 1840s survey map by James Charles Burnett. Further north are:\n* Picnic Point ()\n* Scotts Point (), which was probably named after surgeon Peter Walter Scott who was the storekeeper in Moreton Bay penal settlement between 1824 and 1926.\nHistory\nIn 1799, Matthew Flinders landed on the peninsula and named the location Red Cliff Point after the colours of the cliffs. In 1823 the peninsula was selected as the site of Queensland's first (and only) penal colony (Moreton Bay penal settlement). After arriving in 1824 to establish the colony, problems with mosquitoes and resistance from the Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi) and the people (Ningi Ningi, Ninghi Ninghi), part of the Undambi people who were indigenous to the land, caused the colony to relocate further up the Brisbane River in 1825, founding the city of Brisbane.\nRedcliffe developed as a small seaside retreat accessible only by boat from Brisbane while Woody Point was originally a banana plantation.\nWoody Point Jetty was built in 1888. It was reconstructed during 2008 at a cost of $9.6 million.\nWhen the Hornibrook Bridge opened in 1935 (later replaced by the Houghton Highway and Ted Smout Memorial Bridge ), it linked Brighton, the most north-eastern suburb in the City of Brisbane, across Hays Inlet to Clontarf on the Redcliffe Peninsula. By improving the road connection between them, Redcliffe then became much more accessible and grew as part of Brisbane's suburban sprawl.\nA one-off 'high speed reliability trial' motor race was held in 1936, with a 4.2km (2.65 mile) circuit using the following streets in a clockwise direction: Oxley St-Duffield Rd-Ernest St-Albert St-Margate Pde-Whytecliffe Pde-Gayundah Esplanade-Lilla St-Alfred St. Competitors had to average fixed speeds over the 27 laps.\nOur Lady of Lourdes School opened in 1969 and closed in 1995.\nWoody Point Special School opened on 21 August 1978. The school supported children from Early Childhood to Year 12 initially, but, following a community consultation in 2017, it was decided that the schools should support children from Early Childhood to Year 6, but that children with special needs from Years 7 to 12 would attend Redcliffe Special School. This transition commenced in 2018 and took two years to complete.\nSouthern Cross Catholic College (Woody Point Primary) opened in 2002, being formed by the amalgamation of three Catholic primary schools of the Peninsula, Soubirous College and De La Salle College.\nIn 1958, HMQS Gayundah was run aground at Woody Point to create a breakwater.\nThe foundation stone of St Mark's Anglican Church was laid at 46 Kate Street (corner of Annie Street, ) on Sunday 26 April 1953 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. The church was dedicated on 7 April 1957 by Archbishop Halse. It was consecrated on 28 April 1968 by Archbishop Philip Strong. In the 1990s it was decided to combine the congregations of St Mark's and St Barnabas in Clontarf into a new St Peter the Fisherman's Anglican Church at Clontarf. This led to the closure of St Mark's on 24 April 1993 which was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning. St Peter the Fisherman's was dedicated in 1993. As at July 2020, the St Mark's site has been converted into a multi-unit dwelling but the foundation stone is still visible on the street corner.\nWoody Point's Apex Park & Bicentennial Park were constructed by reclaiming land along the foreshore in the 1970s.\nDemographics\nIn the , Woody Point had a population of 4,089 people, 51.5% female and 48.5% male.
