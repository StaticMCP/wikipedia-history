It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1922.\nOverview\nThe Dodo Sue Ware Kiln was a Sue ware pottery production site approximately four kilometers southeast of the modern city center of Tahara, in a hilly forest. After World War II, many ruins of kilns have been discovered in the Atsumi Peninsula dating from the late Heian period to the early Kamakura period, thus shedding light on the origins of several styles of pottery which until that time were uncertain. The Dodo site contains two nobori-gama kilns built side-by-side on a hill, utilizing a south-facing slope. These kilns were used to produce everyday items, such as small bowls, plates, tea cups, etc.\nThe site is located approximately 18 minutes by car from Toyohashi Railroad Atsumi Line Mikawa-Tahara Station.\nSee also\n*List of Historic Sites of Japan (Aichi)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.taharamuseum.gr.jp/heritage/heritage1.html Tahara Museum home page]"
