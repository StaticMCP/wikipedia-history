Any candidate for the presidency needs to have been a member of the party for at least 15 years. The president is nominally elected by an electoral college composed of members drawn from the party's National and State councils, but in practice is a consensus choice of senior members of the party. The term of the president is three years long, and individuals may not serve more than two consecutive terms. The president usually does not also hold a post within a government, and party chiefs have resigned the position to assume posts in Cabinet.\nAfter the party's foundation in 1980, Atal Bihari Vajpayee became its first president. He later became the prime minister of India, the only BJP president to serve in that position to date. In 1986, Lal Krishna Advani was sworn in as the party president and has been the longest serving president over three different periods. As of 2022, 11 people have served as the president of the BJP, including Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah who have also served two terms. J. P. Nadda is the most recent president, having been appointed in January 2020.\nList of party presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | S.

Under him the BJP projected itself as a centrist party that had moved away from the strident politics of the BJS. Vajpayee, often seen as the moderate face of the BJP, later became the first Prime Minister of India not from the Indian National Congress to serve a full term.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan =\"2\" | 2\n! scope=\"row\" | 1986–1991\n|\n| L. K. Advani\n|Gujarat\n|\n|-\n|  colspan=\"5\" |Advani succeeded Atal Bihari Vajpayee as president in 1986, an event usually associated with a shift in the BJP's ideology towards hardline Hindutva, exemplified by the Ram Rath Yatra led by Advani in 1990 as part of an effort to generate electoral support by appealing to Hindu nationalism. He had served as the president of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1973.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan =\"2\" | 3\n! scope=\"row\" | 1991–1993\n|\n| Murli Manohar Joshi\n|Uttarakhand\n|\n|-\n|  colspan=\"5\" |BJP ideologue Joshi had been affiliated with the RSS nearly fifty years before he became BJP president in 1991. As with his predecessor L. K. Advani, he played a large role in the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation. He later served as a cabinet minister in the governments headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. During his presidency, the BJP became the principal opposition party for the first time.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan =\"2\" | (2)\n! scope=\"row\" | 1993–1998\n|\n| L. K. Advani\n|Gujarat\n|\n|-\n|  colspan=\"5\" |Advani had been a member of the RSS for fifty years when he took office for the second time. His aggressive campaigning helped the BJP became the largest party in the lower house of the Indian Parliament after elections in 1996. Though Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Prime Minister, Advani was seen as the power within the party, and later served as Deputy Prime Minister.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan =\"2\" | 4\n! scope=\"row\" | 1998–2000\n|\n| Kushabhau Thakre\n|Madhya Pradesh\n|\n|-\n|  colspan=\"5\" |Thakre had been associated with the RSS since 1942. He was not well known outside the BJP when he became the president in 1998, a few months after the BJP-led NDA government took office. During his tenure the BJP reduced its emphasis on Hindutva, such as its demand for abrogating Article 370 of the Indian constitution, to accommodate the views of a large coalition.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan =\"2\" | 5\n! scope=\"row\" | 2000–2001\n|\n| Bangaru Laxman\n|Telangana\n|\n|-\n|  colspan=\"5\" |Laxman, an RSS member of long standing, became the first Dalit president of the BJP in 2000.

His election was seen by commentators as an example of L. K. Advani and the orthodox Hindu-nationalist wing of the party re-asserting control. Though elected to a full term, Naidu resigned after the NDA lost the 2004 Indian general election to the UPA led by the Indian National Congress.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan =\"2\" | (2)\n! scope=\"row\" | 2004–2005\n|\n| L.
