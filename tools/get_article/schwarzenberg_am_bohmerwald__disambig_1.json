The municipal area stretches along the southern slopes of the Bohemian Forest (Böhmerwald) range; about 71 percent of the municipality is forest, and 26 percent is farmland.\nHistory\nFirst mentioned in 1571, the Schwarznperg estates were held by the Bavarian Prince-Bishops of Passau since medieval times. The remote area near the border with the Kingdom of Bohemia from 1638 was the site of a forest glasshouse, which became a possession of Schlägl Abbey in 1719.\nUnder the rule of Empress Maria Theresa, in 1765, Schwarzenberg finally passed to the Upper Austrian crown land of the Habsburg monarchy. The local parish was established according to a 1784 patent issued by Emperor Joseph II. After the Napoleonic Wars, the area became part of the Austrian Empire.\nPolitics\nSeats in the municipal assembly (Gemeinderat) as of 2015 local elections:\n*Austrian People's Party (ÖVP): 9\n*Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ): 3\n*Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 1\nNotable people\n*Franz Xaver Schmid (1819–1883), philosopher\n*Viktor Schauberger (1885–1958), forester and naturalist\nReferences"
