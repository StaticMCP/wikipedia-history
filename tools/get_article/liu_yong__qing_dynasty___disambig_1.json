He served in a number of high-level positions with a reputation for being incorruptible, including as the Minister of Rites and Minister of War. Since 1782 he was made the chief tutor of the Palace School (上書房總師傅) for imperial princes, including the later Jiaqing Emperor.\nLiu was described as an upright man. Seo Yu-mun (서유문, 徐有聞), a Korean diplomat who had joined the Dongzhi Festival mission (동지사, 冬至使) to Qing China as a Seojanggwan (서장관, 書狀官, the third of the mission) in 1798, reported that \"Heshen has been in power for decades. From the local government to the imperial court, almost every minister fawned over him. Wang Jie, Liu Yong, Dong Gao, Zhu Gui (朱珪), Ji Yun, Tiebao (鐵保), Yubao (玉保) and others are exceptions.\"\nLiu Yong is also regarded by some as the \"most influential calligrapher of his time\".\nIn fiction and popular culture\n* Portrayed by Li Baotian in The Legend of Liu Yong (1996)\n* Portrayed by Li Xinmin in Qianlong Dynasty (2003)\n* Portrayed by Lee Shing-cheong in Succession War (2018)\n* Portrayed by Kuo Tzu-chien in Lord Jiaqing and The Journey to Taiwan'' (2022)\nReferences\n*"
