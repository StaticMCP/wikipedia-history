The Frontenacs play home games at Slush Puppie Place, which opened in 2008. The team's history predates the Ontario Hockey League, to a team known as the Kingston Victorias in 1945. This current Frontenacs franchise was founded in the Ontario Hockey Association in 1973–74, then known as the Kingston Canadians until 1987–88. The team was briefly known as the Kingston Raiders in 1988–89, and as the Frontenacs since.\nHistory\nThe original Kingston Frontenacs were founded in 1897, named after Louis de Buade de Frontenac, governor of New France, who established Fort Frontenac on the site of present-day Kingston. The original Frontenacs were coached by James T. Sutherland, played in the intermediate division of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), and won the inaugural J. Ross Robertson Cup during the 1898–99 season.\nThe Kingston Frontenacs had a junior ice hockey team in the OHA prior to World War I. This version of the Frontenacs won the J. Ross Robertson Cup in the 1910–11 season. National Hockey League alumni from this team are Alec Connell, Bill Cook, Allan Davidson, and Flat Walsh.\nAn Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) Sr. League team also existed from the 1910s to 1940s. National Hockey League alumni from this team are Mickey Blake, Glen Brydson, Bill Cook, Gus Giesebrecht, Doug Stevenson, Charles Stewart, Carl Voss and Flat Walsh. Some members of this team then formed an entry in the Ontario Veteran's Hockey League during World War II. National Hockey League alumni from this team are Hub Macey, Gus Marker, Walt McCartney and Ed Nicholson.\n1952–1973\nIn 1952, the Kingston Victoria were renamed the Kingston Frontenacs. This team played at the Junior B level, then later at the Junior A level. This Frontenacs team lost in the 1963 Sutherland Cup final to the St. Marys Lincolns, 4 games to 1.\nFrom 1959 to 1963, there was also a Kingston Frontenacs team in the Eastern Professional Hockey League.\nKingston Canadians (1973–1988)\nThe Kingston Canadians arrival in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) for the 1973–74 season was a result of the Montreal Junior Canadiens move to the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) in 1972. During the summer of 1972, the QMJHL had threatened a lawsuit against the OHA to force the Junior Canadiens to return to the Quebec-based league. To solve the problem, the OHA granted the Junior Canadiens franchise a \"one-year suspension\" of operations, while team ownership transferred the team and players into the QMJHL, renaming themselves the Montreal Bleu Blanc Rouge in the process.\nAfter a one-year hiatus, the OHA then reactivated the suspended franchise under new ownership and with new players, calling the team the Kingston Canadians. The new Kingston team was essentially an expansion franchise promoted from the OHA's Tier II league, that had only common name to share with the old Junior Canadiens. The Tier II Frontenacs originated in the Eastern Junior B Hockey League and date back to at least the early 1940s as the Kingston Victorias. However, in some OHA histories (such as the annual Media Guide) the Kingston team is still shown as the legitimate successors of the Junior Canadiens' legacy.\nKingston Raiders (1988–89)\nFollowing a change in ownership the club was renamed Kingston Raiders for one season in 1988–89. Due to ownership problems, the team was sold again following that season.\nKingston Frontenacs (1989–present)\nIn 1989, the new ownership, including Wren Blair, Don Anderson and Bob Attersley, renamed the team Kingston Frontenacs after the Eastern Professional Hockey League team. The Boston Bruins-style uniforms and logos were revived from the old franchise. The city embraced and welcomed the new ownership. Wren Blair and Bob Attersley were both hockey legends in their own right. In 1997 Wren Blair would be honoured with the Bill Long Award for distinguished service in the OHL. The club was sold to the Springer family of Kingston in June 1998, with Doug Springer becoming the owner and governor.\nThe Frontenacs franchise has the second-longest championship drought in the OHL (to the Sudbury Wolves by one year), and the fourth-longest in the Canadian Hockey League. The Frontenacs won the Leyden Trophy as the OHL's East Division champions in the 1994–95 and 2015–16. In the 1992–93 season, the Frontenacs reached the Eastern Conference Final but lost to the Peterborough Petes. In 2017-18, Kingston reached the Eastern Conference final for the second time in club history, however, they lost to the Hamilton Bulldogs.\nCoaches\nFrontenacs pre-game skate.\nDuring the inaugural season of the Kingston Canadians in 1973–74, Jack Bownass was awarded the Matt Leyden Trophy as OHA Coach of the Year. Former NHL defenceman Jim Morrison coached the team from 1975 to 1982, which was the longest stint a coach had when the club was known as the Canadians.\nLarry Mavety coached the Frontenacs for much of the team's history. He originally coached the team in 1988–89, when they were still known as the Kingston Raiders. In 1989–90, the first season the franchise was known as the Frontenacs, he won the Matt Leyden Trophy as the OHL Coach of the Year. Mavety returned to Kingston in 1997 to become the head coach once again, and stayed in that position until midway through the 2002–03 season when he stepped down to focus on his general manager duties. After a slow start in the 2007–08 season, Mavety once again found himself coaching the Frontenacs until November 2008. Mavety remained as the general manager until the end of the 2010–11 season.\nA number of Frontenacs coaches have gone on to coach in the National Hockey League; while Gary Agnew and Dave Allison had short spells as NHL head coaches, Bruce Cassidy is the only Frontenacs coach to become a full-time NHL head coach.\nList of coaches\n(Multiple years in parentheses, totals include all incarnations of the Kingston franchise)\n{|\n|-\n| valign=top width=40% |\n*1973–1975 Jack Bownass (2)\n*1975–1982 Jim Morrison (7)\n*1982–1983 Rod Graham\n*1983–1985 Rick Cornacchia (2)\n*1985–1985 Jim Dorey (2)\n*1985–1987 Fred O'Donnell (2)\n*1987–1988 Jacques Tremblay\n*1988–1988 Jim Dorey (2)\n*1988–1990 Larry Mavety (10)\n*1990–1991 Randy Hall\n*1991–1992 Paul Cook\n*1992–1994 Dave Allison (2)\n*1994–1997 Gary Agnew (3)\n| valign=top width=40% |\n*1997–2003 Larry Mavety (10)\n*2002–2003 Greg Bignell\n*2003–2006 Jim Hulton (3)\n*2006–2007 Bruce Cassidy (2)\n*2007–2008 Larry Mavety (10)\n*2008–2011 Doug Gilmour (3)\n*2011–2014 Todd Gill (3)\n*2014–2017 Paul McFarland (4)}}\n*2017–2018 Jay Varady\n*2018–2020 Kurtis Foster (2)\n*2021–2023 Luca Caputi\n*2023–present Troy Mann\n|}\nPlayers\nPaul Coffey is the only former member of the Kingston franchise to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, getting the honour in 2004. In 1977–78, Coffey played for the Kingston Canadians, as a late season addition from the North York Rangers. He played eight games with the Canadians.\nHonoured numbers\nSeveral numbers have been honoured by the Kingston Canadians/Frontenacs. In 2019, Chris Clifford had his number 29 retired, joining Mike O'Connell, Brad Rhiness, Tony McKegney, and Ken Linseman in receiving the honour. In 2023, brothers Anthony Stewart and Chris Stewart had their numbers raised to the rafters.\nLarry Mavety is the only builder to be honoured by the organization for his work as a coach and general manager.

The logo featured a yellow letter 'K' with a black outline, surrounded by black spokes leading to a yellow circle border with the name Kingston Frontenacs in black.\nIn 2002, the team adopted a new logo with a stylized Count Frontenac.\nIn 2007, the Frontenacs unveiled a 3rd jersey, which was black, yellow, and white, and similar to the Boston Bruins jerseys from the early 1970s. The \"K\" logo was used on the front of the jersey. The Frontenacs began wearing these jerseys on February 22, 2008, which was the same night that they opened their new arena.\nIn 2009, the Frontenacs, along with all CHL teams unveiled new uniforms using RBK EDGE templates. In 2012, the Frontenacs began wearing a newly designed set of uniforms featuring a large K as a logo.\nArenas\nThe original home arena of the Frontenacs was the Kingston Memorial Centre, with a seating capacity of 3,079 seated, and 3,300 including standing room. Built in 1950, its ice size has unique dimensions of 200' x 92'.\nThe Kingston Frontenacs began play at their new downtown arena, Slush Puppie Place (then K-Rock Centre), in 2008.\nSee also\n*List of ice hockey teams in Ontario\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
