It was a victory for Devapala, who reconquered Bhilsa and restored stability in the Paramara kingdom.\nBackground\nPreviously, Iltutmish had directly led an invasion of Bhilsa and Ujjain in 1234–35. Iltutmish's army occupied Bhilsa, and destroyed a temple whose construction - according to Minhaj - had taken three hundred years. At Ujjain, his forces damaged the Mahakaleshwar temple and obtained rich plunder, but made little effort to annex the Paramara territory. The jyotirlinga at the site was dismantled and believed to be thrown into a nearby 'Kotiteerth Kunda' (a pond neighboring the temple) with the Jaladhari (a structure supporting the Lingam) stolen during the invasion.\nAfter Iltutmish's departure, he put an unnamed Delhite Adhipa in charge of the region conquered.\nBattle\nAfter the departure of Iltutmish, Devapala began preparing to revive the fortunes of the Paramara dynasty, and he marched on Bhilsa, decisively defeating and killing the Adhipa put in charge of it and reconquering the territory.\nAftermath\nAfter recovering Bhilsa, Devapala ruled over a stable realm. However, his successor, Jaitugi-deva was an ineffectual ruler who saw several military disasters, such as the sack of Dhar, the Paramara capital. Jaitugi's successor and younger brother, Jayasimha, took up the throne as Jayavarman II and expanded Paramara domains by fighting against the Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura and his 1274 Mandhata inscription states that Jayavarman's army crossed the Vindhyas, and forced the forces of a southern (\"Dakshinatya\") king to retreat. According to D. C. Sircar, this king was probably Ramachandra the Yadava king of Deogiri, who later defeated Jayavarman's successor Arjunavarman II. However, H. V. Trivedi argues that this is unlikely, because during the early part of his reign, Ramachandra was engaged in a conflict with his own brother Amana. The Dakshinatya king referred to here is probably Ramachandra's uncle Mahadeva. The Sangur inscription of the Yadavas refers to Mahadeva's invasion of Malwa.\nSee also\nFirst battle of Bhilsa\nReferences"
