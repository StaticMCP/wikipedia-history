These protected sites date in some cases from the Neolithic period, and include barrows, artillery forts, ruined abbeys, castles, and Iron Age hill forts.\nIn the United Kingdom, the scheduling of monuments was first initiated to ensure the preservation of \"nationally important\" archaeological sites and historic buildings. Protection is given to scheduled monuments under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.\nNotable scheduled monuments in Lincolnshire\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!
