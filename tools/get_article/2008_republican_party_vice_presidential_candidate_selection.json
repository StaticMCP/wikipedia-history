McCain held an event with Alaska governor Sarah Palin, revealing her as his vice presidential running mate on August 29, 2008, a date which coincided both with McCain's 72nd birthday and the Palins' 20th wedding anniversary, at the Ervin J. Nutter Center in Dayton, Ohio, the day after Barack Obama's acceptance speech. If elected, she would have been the first vice president from Alaska and outside the mainland United States, and the first female vice president, but the feat would later be accomplished by Kamala Harris in 2020. The McCain–Palin ticket ultimately lost to the Obama–Biden ticket in the 2008 presidential election, and Palin returned to the governorship following the campaign but later resigned the following year.\nSelection process\nSarah Palin was the GOP choice for Vice President. At a speech in Norfolk, Virginia, McCain told supporters that regional considerations would have less bearing on his decision than the candidate's perceived ability to take over the office of the presidency–and the candidate's \"values, principles, philosophy, and priorities.\" One factor that McCain had to consider, more so than did his opponent, was age. Had McCain won in 2008, he would have (on January 20, 2009) been the oldest person to assume the Presidency in U.S. history at initial ascension to office, being 72 years old. Other factors to be considered were shoring up the conservative base, choosing someone with executive experience, expertise in domestic policy (to complement McCain's foreign policy focus), and electoral college calculations.\nMcCain initially wished to choose Lieberman, his close friend and the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee, as his running mate; however, Lieberman's liberal record (voting with Democrats 86.9% of the time in the 110th Congress) and pro-choice stance led McCain's aides to veto the choice. Close aide Mark Salter preferred Pawlenty, while the campaign manager Steve Schmidt preferred Palin. By picking Palin, Schmidt argued, McCain could snatch the \"change\" mantle away from Obama. McCain, rejecting 'safer' choices such as Pawlenty or Romney, instead chose Palin as his running mate.\nShortlist\nFile:Joe Lieberman 2008.jpg| SenatorJoe Liebermanfrom Connecticut(1989–2013)}}\nFile:Gov.

The Associated Press reported that McCain had composed a list of 20 or so potential running mates. Over two dozen names had been offered as viable potential running mates by The Kansas City Star, The Salt Lake Tribune, The New York Sun, The Indianapolis Star, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Times of India, and The Globe and Mail. This list includes both names that had been mentioned in several sources and some much less likely candidates:\nMembers of Congress\nFile:Eric Cantor headshot.png|\nFile:Sam Brownback headshot.jpg|\nFile:Lindsey Graham, official Senate photo portrait cropped.jpg|\nFile:Joe Lieberman 2008.jpg| SenatorJoe Liebermanfrom Connecticut(1989–2013)}}\nFile:Lisa Murkowski (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Paul Ryan, official portrait, 110th Congress.jpg|\nFile:Olympia Snowe official photo 2010 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:John E.
