      "text": "# Forwarding equivalence class\n\nA forwarding equivalence class (FEC) is a term used in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to describe a set of packets with similar or identical characteristics which may be forwarded the same way; that is, they may be bound to the same MPLS label.\nCharacteristics determining the FEC of a higher-layer packet depend on the configuration of the router, but typically this is at least the destination IP address. Quality of service class is also often used. Thus, a forward equivalence class tends to correspond to a label-switched path (LSP). The reverse is not true, however: an LSP may be (and usually is) used for multiple FECs.\nReferences\n* [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls/mpls/4649-mpls-faq-4649.html#anc4 MPLS FAQ For Beginners: What is a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)?]\n* [https://www.networkworld.com/article/2350449/understanding-the-role-of-fecs-in-mpls.html Understanding the Role of FECs in MPLS]\n\n---\n\n## Forwarding Equivalence Class\n\n#REDIRECT Forwarding equivalence class"
