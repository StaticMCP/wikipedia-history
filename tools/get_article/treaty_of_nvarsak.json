This treaty ensured religious freedom and autonomy for Armenians.\nThe conditions of the treaty were as follows:\n#All existing fire-altars in Armenia should be destroyed and no new ones should be constructed.\n#Christians in Armenia should have freedom of worship and conversions to Zoroastrianism should be stopped.\n#Land should not be allotted to people who convert to Zoroastrianism\n#The Sasanian king should, in person, administer Armenia and not through deputies.\nFollowing the treaty, Vahan Mamikonian was appointed as hazarapet and later marzban (\"margrave\") of Armenia. The Armenian cavalry led by Vahan supported Balash against the uprising of a pretender named Zarer (son or brother of Peroz).\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
