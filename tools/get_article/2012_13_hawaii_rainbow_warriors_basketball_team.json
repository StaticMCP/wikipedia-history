They finished the season 17–15, 10–8 in Big West play to finish in fifth place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Big West tournament to UC Irvine. They were invited to the 2013 CIT where they lost in the first round to Air Force.\nThe 2012–13 Rainbow Warrior roster was composed of players from eight countries (Angola, Australia, Canada, Croatia, Germany, Latvia, New Zealand, and the United States).\nIn 2015, Hawaii announced it would vacate wins from this and the 2013–14 season due to the participation of Davis Rozitis and Isaac Fotu, who were ruled ineligible due to improper benefits. The 2016–17 Hawaii media guide indicates that all but the November 12 win over Houston Baptist were vacated. Rozitis did not play in that game.\nRoster\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! Number\n! Name\n! Position\n! Height\n! Weight\n! Year\n!
