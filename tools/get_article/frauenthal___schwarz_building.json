It was designed by architects Sanders & Ginocchio and built in 1925 as a major expansion and renovation of an 1879 building.  It is a two-story structure, built of brick, steel, and concrete.  Its ground floor storefront consists of plate glass windows and two double-leaf doorways, sheltered by a flat metal overhang.  The upper floor has four groups of six windows, each consisting of larger-paned sections topped by smaller-paned ones.  A decorative cornice with Mediterranean touches and flattened Italianate brackets extends above them.  The building is one of the city's architecturally finest surviving commercial structures of the 1920s, designed by a prominent firm.\nThe building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\nSee also\n*Frauenthal House (Conway, Arkansas), also designed by Charles L.
