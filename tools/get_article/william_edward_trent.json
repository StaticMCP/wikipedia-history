This led to his appointment first as the chief architect to Provincial Cinematograph Theatres (PCT), and then as architect to the Gaumont British Picture Corporation, which took over PCT in 1929. These cinemas/theatres included the Regent Theatre, Ipswich, Apollo Victoria Theatre and the Gaumont Finchley (1937), designed with the assistance of his son W. Sydney Trent and R. Golding.\nPersonal life\nHis son William Sydney Trent (1903-1944) was also an architect. When his father became a full-time employee of PCT, his son took over his private practice, retaining him as a consultant. However, he joined Gaumont British in 1932 to help his father with the huge increase in work with the advent of talking pictures.\nReferences\nExternal links"
