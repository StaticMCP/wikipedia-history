The majority of the mound was built from 1200 to 1400 CE. The site has the largest mound of the Caddoan Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture). It measures approximately  in length,  wide, and  in height.\nFour low rises at the site are believed also to have been constructed earthwork mounds. Many burial grounds, occupation areas, and other mound sites in the area may be connected with this site.  Minor investigations were conducted at the site by Dr. Alex D. Krieger of the University of Texas at Austin and his assistant Mr. Lynn E. Howard, between June 25 and September 11, 1948. The field notes and a full analysis of the excavation have not been published. In recent years archaeologist Duncan P. McKinnon has been conducting research at the site using archaeogeophysical means.\nSee also\n* Spiro Mounds\n* List of Mississippian sites\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40713522?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Duncan P.
