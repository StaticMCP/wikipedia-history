The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 8.0 and a surface-wave magnitude of 8.1. The maximum Mercalli Intensity in the event was VIII (Severe).\nThe interplate earthquake began in the ocean bottom just off the rugged coast of Graham Island. It ruptured along the Queen Charlotte Fault both northward and southward more than . Shaking was felt throughout British Columbia, parts of Washington, Oregon, Alberta, the Yukon, and Alaska. No deaths were reported in this earthquake.\nEarthquake\nThe 1949 Queen Charlotte Islands earthquake was caused by a rupture on the Queen Charlotte Fault, which forms part of the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. This fault runs from northern Vancouver Island, west of Haida Gwaii, up to the Gulf of Alaska. The earthquake ruptured the fault for a distance more than .\nBecause this quake occurred before the modern surface wave magnitude scale was developed and widely implemented, this earthquake may have only had the same overall intensity as the 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake. In future there may be some research done to compare the two earthquake events.\nThis earthquake, larger than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, is Canada's largest earthquake recorded by seismometers. However, the greatest earthquake in Canadian history was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, a megathrust earthquake that occurred along the Pacific Northwest coast from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia which reached magnitude 9 on the Richter scale.\nDamage\nAlthough nobody was killed in this earthquake, people and animals were knocked off their feet and there were landslides and other damage. Chimneys tumbled, and an oil tank at Cumshewa Inlet collapsed.\nIn the service community of Terrace, over  away on the mainland, cars were bounced around, and standing on the street was described as \"like being on the heaving deck of a ship at sea\".\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
