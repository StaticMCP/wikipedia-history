The company is known for its tools that support the creation, management, and delivery of scalable, AI-ready content across the enterprise. MadCap serves organizations across industries, including software, manufacturing, healthcare, life sciences, aerospace, and finance.  MadCap's authoring tools are all based on xHTML.\nThe company is best known for its flagship product, MadCap Flare, and a broader platform that includes cloud collaboration, structured content management, learning content delivery, and omnichannel publishing.\nHistory\nMadCap Software was founded in 2005 by former members of eHelp Corporation, the original developers of RoboHelp, following eHelp’s acquisition by Macromedia (later Adobe Systems). Co-founders Anthony Olivier, former CEO of eHelp, and Bjorn Backlund, who led the RoboHelp development team, set out to create a next-generation authoring platform based on modern XML standards.\nTheir first product, MadCap Flare, quickly became a leading tool for single-source publishing and helped establish MadCap as a leader in the technical communication industry.\nIn 2022, MadCap acquired IXIA CCMS, an enterprise-grade component content management system (CCMS) designed for structured content reuse, particularly in regulated and multilingual industries.\nIn 2023, MadCap acquired Xyleme, a leader in learning content management and distribution. The acquisition added proven tools like [https://xyleme.com/products/create/ Create], a collaborative authoring and publishing platform, and [https://xyleme.com/products/syndicate/ Syndicate], the flagship solution for governed, omnichannel content delivery. Together, they expanded the MadCap platform for corporate training, performance support, and enterprise-scale knowledge management.\nAI Strategy\nMadCap Software’s AI content strategy is a three-pillar framework for aligning content management with artificial intelligence. The approach identifies three areas of focus:\nContent Access: structuring and managing content so AI systems can reliably retrieve it\nContent Intelligence: using AI to improve classification, tagging, search, and analysis of content\nContent Assistance: integrating AI into authoring environments to support drafting, summarizing, and refining content\nProducts\nMadCap offers an integrated content operations platform that supports modular, multi-channel, and multilingual content across technical documentation and learning content teams:\nMadCap Flare – Single-source publishing tool for structured, topic-based content creation, supporting output to HTML5, PDF, Word, EPUB, and more.\nMadCap Flare Online – Cloud-based extension of Flare (formerly MadCap Central) for real-time collaboration, content hosting, project management, and analytics.\nMadCap IXIA CCMS – Structured content management system for large-scale, reusable documentation with features such as component-based authoring, redlining, context mapping, and translation workflows.\nMadCap Create – Scalable, collaborative authoring and publishing tool that lets teams reuse content intelligently and instantly update across all formats (Word, PowerPoint, PDF, HTML5, SCORM, XML).\nMadCap Syndicate – AI readiness platform for enterprise content and knowledge delivery. Connects with Flare and IXIA CCMA for omnichannel publishing and integration with platforms like Salesforce and Zendesk.\nUse and Reach\nMadCap serves a global customer base across a wide range of industries, particularly in environments with complex regulatory needs, global content requirements, or rapidly evolving product and training demands.\nBy unifying technical and learning content workflows, global enterprises can manage all content needs—technical documentation, learning and development, training, certification, and compliance—through one unified MadCap platform.\nCompany Information\nFounded: 2005\nHeadquarters: Denver, Colorado\nCEO: Anthony Olivier\nWebsite: www.madcapsoftware.com\nSee also\n* Office Open XML software\nReferences\n*"
