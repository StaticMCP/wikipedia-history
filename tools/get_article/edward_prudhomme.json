They had three children, Reginald, Myrtle, and Emma Lise.\nMildred Methvin, a federal and state judge in Louisiana, is a descendant of the Prudhomme family.\nNotre Dame\nPrudhomme arrived at Notre Dame to pursue a commercial diploma in 1883. He was a member of the second Notre Dame football team in the spring of 1888. He played as a fullback, and is credited with kicking the team's first extra point in a 26–6 loss to Michigan (conversions via a kick were worth two points from 1883 to 1897). In the 1888 fall season, Prudhomme was elected to the honor of team captain, and presided over the first win in program history, a 20–0 shutout of Harvard Prep school of Chicago.  Prudhomme was elected again in 1889, and became the first captain to serve for two consecutive years (Henry Luhn was technically the first to serve two seasons, doing so in the fall of 1887 and spring of 1888). He led the Fighting Irish to their first collegiate victory, a 9–0 shutout at Northwestern. He left the university with a 2–2 record, and a 2–0 record as a captain.\nPrudhomme, along with nine of his other teammates, returned to the university in 1924 for the homecoming game against Georgia Tech.\nLater years\nAfter graduating from the university in 1891, Prudhomme returned to work on his father's plantation in Louisiana. He became an assistant postmaster for the town of Bermuda, and served on the board of directors in the state farm bureau.\nAs of 1925, Prudhomme had served politically as a member of the Natchitoches Parish Democratic Executive Committee for the past thirty years. He succeeded his father Jacques as the parish's jury commissioner in 1904. In 1924, Prudhomme was elected to the Louisiana state legislature, and served on the committees on education and railroads.\nPrudhomme died suddenly in 1941 in Natchitoches, Louisiana, at age 71.\nReferences"
