The prize provides additional time or resources for writing or research, as well as raising the profile of the book when published.\nRecipients must have a publishing contract and be citizens of either the UK or Ireland, or have been residents in one of these for at least the three years previous to the award.\nThe award was established in 2017, and secured in perpetuity through a bequest from author and RSL Fellow Giles St Aubyn. The awards replaced the earlier RSL Jerwood Award, which existed from 2004 to 2016 and was funded by the Jerwood Charitable Foundation.\nGiles St Aubyn (1925-2015) wrote 14 non-fiction books and taught history for nearly 40 years at Eton College. A nephew of Vita Sackville-West, he counted John Betjeman, John le Carré and the Queen Mother among his friends.\nRecipients\n{|class=wikitable\n|+List of recipients, titles and publishers\n!Year!!width=30%|1st prize£10,000!!width=30%|2nd prize£5000!!width=30%|3rd prize£2500 (from 2020)!!width=170|Judges\n|-\n|2023|| Oliver BascianoOutcast: A History of Leprosy, Humanity and the Modern World(Faber & Faber)|| Taj AliCome What May, We’re Here to Stay: A Story of South Asian Resistance(Manchester University Press) ||Katherine DunnRight Here, Right Now: The Hidden History of How the Global Positioning System Shaped the Modern World(Mudlark, Harper Collins) ||Tom BurgisFiona St AubynLeila Aboulela\n|-\n|2022||Nuzha NuseibehNamesake(Canongate, 2023) ||Ellen AtlantaPixel Flesh: Modern Beauty Culture and The Women It Harms(Headline, Hachette, 2023) || Malachi McIntoshA Revolutionary Consciousness: Black Britain, Black Power, and the Caribbean Artists Movement (Faber, 2025)||Homi K.
