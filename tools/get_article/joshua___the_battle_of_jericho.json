The game is themed on the Battle of Jericho described in the Book of Joshua, in which the Israelites topple the defensive wall of the city of Jericho by encircling it and blowing their trumpets.\nAs a tile-based action puzzle game, Joshua & the Battle of Jericho was one of the few Christian video games of its day that did not adhere strictly to a Bible quiz format. However, the player is asked five multiple choice questions about the Book of Joshua between levels.\nIn 1992, Wisdom Tree published the game in the United States for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and later ported it to Game Boy (1993), MS-DOS (1994), and Sega Genesis (1994).\nDesign and gameplay\nThe game is a sequel to 1991's Exodus, which was a redesign of Crystal Mines (1989), a title developed by Ken Beckett for Wisdom Tree's predecessor, Color Dreams. In addition to changes in theme, graphics, and game mechanics, Joshua introduces a password feature for revisiting a game level. The game has 100 levels, 100 quizzes, and 10 bonus stages. Unlike Exodus, the game has no background music.\nWhereas in Crystal Mines the player character is a gun-wielding robot who mines a newly discovered exoplanet, Joshua is a tribal leader of Israel who infiltrates and pillages the city of Jericho. He attacks enemies and destroys obstacles with blasts from a shofar (a Jewish ceremonial horn). Enemies include Amorites, Hittites, and other Canaanites; Balaam features as a slightly more powerful enemy. Joshua's trumpet blasts (called \"toots\" in-game) also destroy blocks of Jericho's wall; \"Israelite discontent\", \"Achan's sin\",\n| rev2 = Sega-16\n| rev2Score = 8/10\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.giantbomb.com/joshua-the-battle-of-jericho/3030-8222/ Joshua & the Battle of Jericho] at Giant Bomb"
