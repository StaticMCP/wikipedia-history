Protection is given to scheduled monuments under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. There are nearly 20,000 entries on the schedule, which is maintained by Historic England as part of the National Heritage List for England; more than one site can be included in a single entry. While a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, Historic England's aim is to set the most appropriate form of protection in place for the building or site.\nScheduled monuments\n|}\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in the City of York\n*List of scheduled monuments in the United Kingdom\nReferences\nNotes"
