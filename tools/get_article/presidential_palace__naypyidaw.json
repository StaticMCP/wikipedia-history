The 100-room palace is a complex of buildings, surrounded by a moat that can be crossed by bridges.\nThe palace was constructed by Eden Construction, while the roads and bridges leading to the palace were overseen by the military's Engineering Corps.\nActing President Myint Swe did not move into the Presidential Palace following the 2021 coup d'état. Instead, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing occupied the palace. Min Aung Hlaing has held diplomatic receptions and award ceremonies at the palace, for which he has worn the presidential sash, even before he assumed the presidential post in 2024. The 2025 Myanmar earthquake on 28 March significantly damaged the palace.\nGallery\nFile:Clinton and President Thein Sein.jpg|Thein Sein with Hillary Clinton\nFile:Secretary Kerry Meets Burmese President Thein Sein - Flickr - East Asia and Pacific Media Hub (2).jpg|Thein Sein with John Kerry in front of the Throne\nFile:Secretary Kerry Meets Burmese President Thein Sein - Flickr - East Asia and Pacific Media Hub.jpg|The main room where to meet the first class visitors\nFile:President Obama Meets with the President of Burma.webm| Obama meeting with President Thein Sein\nFile:Secretary Clinton with Burmese First Lady in Nay Pyi Taw (6464632633).jpg|President, First Lady and Hillary Clinton\nFile:The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi meeting the President of Myanmar, Mr. U.
