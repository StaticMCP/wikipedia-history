      "text": "# Timeline of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2010 Pacific hurricane season was one of the least active seasons on record, featuring the fewest named storms since 1977. The season officially started on May&nbsp;15 in the eastern Pacific—east of 140°W—and on June&nbsp;1 in the central Pacific—between the International Date Line and 140°W—and lasted until November&nbsp;30. These dates typically cover the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Agatha, developed on May&nbsp;29; the season's final storm, Tropical Storm Omeka, degenerated on December&nbsp;21.\nThe season began with record-breaking activity with four named storms, including two major hurricanes, developing by the end of June. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) values exceeded 300&nbsp;percent of the average for the month of June. Activity abruptly diminished thereafter, with July, August, and September seeing record low storm development. The Eastern Pacific season proper ended with Tropical Storm Georgette's dissipation on September&nbsp;23, a month before the climatological mean. The year's final cyclone, Omeka, developed in the off-season on December&nbsp;18, marking a record-late formation date in the satellite-era. Although there were relatively few storms, the season proved exceptionally deadly and destructive. Torrential rains associated with Agatha and Eleven-E killed well over 200&nbsp;people in Central America and Mexico and left more than $1.5&nbsp;billion in damage.\nFour time zones are utilized in the basin: Central for storms east of 106°W, Mountain between 114.9°W and 106°W, Pacific between 140°W and 115°W, and Hawaii–Aleutian for storms between the International Date Line and 140°W. However, for convenience, all information is listed by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first with the respective local time included in parentheses. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as the subtropical phase of Omeka, is included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nTimeline of events\nMay\nMay&nbsp;15\n*The 2010 Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nMay&nbsp;29\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT, May&nbsp;28) &ndash;
