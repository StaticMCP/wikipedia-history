All of these except for the knights would always hold most of their fiefs as tenant in chief. Although the kings maintained control of huge tracts of lands through judges, constables, castles, and sheriffs, the nobles of England were still powerful. This is a list of the various different nobles and magnates including both lords spiritual and lords secular. It also includes nobles who were vassals of the king but were not based in England (Welsh, Irish, French). Additionally nobles of lesser rank who appear to have been prominent in England at the time. The nobles are listed categorically by rank starting with the Archbishops and going down to the nobles who did not hold titles.\nArchbishops\nThe word Archbishop originates as an additional honor for powerful bishops who held sway over several dioceses. Archbishops were usually associated with an important city holding land and influence within the city\nNote: Several Archbishops are not listed because they were either not consecrated, set aside within 3 years, did not rule for more than a year, or were quashed by the pope/the king.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!Title\n!Coats of Arms\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n|-\n|1\n|Archbishop of Canterbury\n|\n|Hubert Walter(1193–1205)\n|Stephen Langton (1207–1228)\n|Richard le Grant (1229–1231)\n|Edmund of Abingdon (1234–1240)\n|Boniface of Savoy (bishop) (1241–1270)\n|Robert Kilwardby (1273–1278)\n|John Peckham (1279–1292)\n|Robert Winchelsey (1294–1313)\n|-\n|2\n|Archbishop of York\n|\n|Geoffrey (archbishop of York) (1191–1212)\n|Walter de Gray (1216–1255)\n|Sewal de Bovil (1256–1258)\n|Godfrey Ludham (1258–1265)\n|Walter Giffard (1266–1279)\n|William de Wickwane (1279–1285)\n|John le Romeyn (1286–1296)\n|Henry of Newark (1298–1299)\n|-\n|3\n|Archbishop of Dublin\n|\n|John Comyn (bishop) (1181–1212)\n|Henry de Loundres (1213–1228)\n|Luke (Archbishop of Dublin) (1230–1255)\n|Fulk Basset (1256–1271)\n|John de Derlington (1279–1284)\n|John de Sandford (1286–1294)\n|William Houghton (bishop) (1296–1298)\n|Richard de Ferings (1299–1306)\n|-\n|4\n|Archbishop of Bordeaux\n|\n|Hélie de Malemort (1188–1207)\n|Guillaume II Amanieu de Genève (1207–1227)\n|Géraud de Malemort (1227–1261)\n|Pierre de Roncevault (1261–1270)\n|Simon de Rochechouart (1275–1280)\n|Guillaume III (archbishop of Bordeaux) (1285–1287)\n|Henri de Genève (1289–1297)\n|Boson de Salignac (1297–1299)\n|}\nEarls/Counts\nEarls (referred to as Comitis in records) were powerful lords holding their lands per baronium. Technically they were the kings highest representative in their given shires (outranking even the sheriff who were referred to as vicecomitem (Vice-Counts)), for example the Earl of Devon would be the highest administrator of Devonshire, however he was not the overlord of the barons in Devonshire (though he could be for certain manors but the baron could just as well be the overlord of a different manor which the earl possessed).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!Title\n!Region\n!Coats of Arms\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n|-\n|1\n|Earls Palatine of

other leading clergymen who functioned similarly to feudal barons holding their land per baronium. Generally they were centered at a cathedral or abbey and not a castle and although some were expected to provide soldiers for the king, they were not expected to fight themselves (however some of them did). Bishops who ruled for less than three years will not be listed to avoid clutter.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!Title\n!Region\n!County/Shire\n!Coats of

Royal Demesne Equivalents\nHolding land per baronium (by barony) was considered the highest form of land tenure. Barons were generally tenants in chief who held usually 10-50 manors, often scattered around but usually with a general grouping of estates around the Caput Baronium. Many of these manors were held by knights who provided military service to their lord. Often a few of the baron's manors were held from another tenant in chief. A barony with more than 20 manors in it was termed an honour. Most bishops also held their land per baronium and all earls held their land per baronium.\nWelsh Marcher Barons Under the Crown\nMarcher-lords enjoyed a greater degree of independence, holding almost all feudal rights to build castles, have sheriffs, declare war, establish boroughs, establish markets, confiscate lands, legislative power and hold mini parliament. However, they could not mint coins nor could they judge someone guilty of high treason, and if they died without heirs, their land would revert to the crown. Marcher lordships seem to have functioned in a similar way to that of a state in the Holy Roman Empire, enjoying extensive freedom but still subject to the crown.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Barony of\n!Coats of arms\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n|-\n|Barony of Meath/Fingal\n|\n|Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath (1194–1241)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Clifford\n|\n|Walter de Clifford (died 1221) (1199–1208)\n|Walter de Clifford (died 1263) (1208–1263)\n|John Giffard, 1st Baron Giffard (1263–1299 title changed to Baron Giffard?)\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Bramber\n|\n|William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber (1179–1211)\n|Reginald de Braose (1211–1228)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Glamorgon\n|\n|(Held by the Earls of Gloucester)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Gower\n|\n|John de Braose\n|William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Whittingham\n|\n|Maurice of Powis (1200–1204)\n|Fulk FitzWarin (1204–1258) [As a vassal of the Earls of Gloucester]\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Dyffryn Clwyd (Grey)\n|\n|Henry de Grey (~1200–1219)\n|Sir John de Grey (~1219–1266)\n|Reginald de Grey, 1st Baron Grey de Wilton (1266–1308)\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Brecknock\n|\n|John de Havering\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Wigmore/Mortimer\n|\n|Roger Mortimer of Wigmore (1181–1214)\n|Ralph de Mortimer (1227–1246)\n|Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer (1246–1308)\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Montgomery\n|\n|William de Boell (1233–~1250)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Knockin\n|\n|John Lestrange (~1223–1269)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony Mortimer de Chirk\n|\n|Roger Mortimer de Chirk (~1275–1326)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Cemais/Kemes\n|\n|William I FitzMartin (~1190–1209)\n|William II FitzMartin (1209–1216)\n|Sir Nicholas FitzMartin (~1225–1282)\n|William, Lord Martin (1282–1324)\n|-\n|Barony of Monmouth\n|\n|John Fitzgilbert de Monmouth (1189–1248)\n|John de Monmouth (Baron) (1248–1257)\n|John II de Monmouth (1257–1281) (Hanged for murder)\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Blenlevenny\n|\n|Peter FitzHerbert (~1214–1235)\n|Herbert Fitzpiers (1235–1248)\n|Reginald FitzPiers (1248–1286)\n|John FitzReginald (1286–1310)\n|-\n|Lordship of Monmouth\n|\n|John of Monmouth (1189–1248)\n|John of Monmouth (died 1257) (1248–1257)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Lordship of Carleon/Machen Castle\n|\n|Hywel ab Iorwerth (~1184–1216)\n|Morgan ap Hywel (1216–1248)\n|\n|\n|}\nFeudal Barons and Barons by Writ Under the Crown\nThe difference between a feudal barony and a barony by writ is not a clear distinction since barons had been summoned for council before the parliaments of that later 13th century. Barons who attended the Curia Regis of 1237 were undoubtedly equal in rank to the ones later summoned to the parliaments of 1246 and beyond. In fact many of the barons attending the Curia Regis were predecessors to those attending the later Parliaments.\nBedfordshire\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Barony of\n!Coats of arms\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n|-\n|Honour of Bedford\n|\n|Falkes de Breauté (1216–1224)\n|Besieged and confiscated by the crown\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Eaton Bray\n|\n|William de Cantilupe (died 1239)\n|William de Cantilupe (died 1251)\n|William de Cantilupe (died 1254)\n|George de Cantilupe\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony de Wahull of Odell Castle\n|\n|Walter de Wahull II (~1170–1208)\n|Saher de Wahull (~1208–1250)\n|Walter de Wahull III (~1250–1269)\n|John de Wahull (1269–1296)\n|Thomas de Wahull (1296–1303)\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Cainhoe\n|\n|Under the house de Albini until 1233\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Barony of Old Wardon\n|\n|Walter de Trailly (1180–1206)\n|Walter de Trailly II (1206–1220)\n|John de Trailly (1220–1235)\n|John de Trailly II (1235–1272)\n|Walter de Trailly III (1272–1289)\n|John de Trailly III (1289–1304)\n|-\n|Barony of Tilsworth Castle\n|\n|Adam de Moreteyn (1175–1210)\n|Eustace I de Morteyn (1210–1223)\n|Eustace II de Morteyn (1223–1234)\n|Roger de Morteyn I (1234~1280)\n|Roger de Morteyn II (~1280–1320)\n|\n|}\nBerkshire\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Barony of\n!Coat of arms\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n|-\n|Royal Demesne in Berkshire\n|\n|Key Holdings Include:\n.
