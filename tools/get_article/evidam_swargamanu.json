It tells the story of Mathews, a farmer who has to fight the real estate mafia over selling his farmland which he refuses to give away.\nIvidam Swargamanu was released on 25 December 2009. The film won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value.Also, the film was a commercial success.\nPlot\nThe movie narrates the tale of a diligent farmer named Mathews and his struggle against a land mafia that seeks to seize his lands. Hardworking farmers Mathews and his father Jeremias have developed a dairy farm that can house many cattles. Together with his father, mother Aleyamma, and her sister Rahelamma, Mathews has a quiet, contented life.\nProblems arise when Mathews' farm is eyed by Aluva Chandy, a powerful real estate dealer and land mafia, who tries to persuade Mathews to sell the land to Chandy so that he may flip it and resell it to a Mumbai-based businessman for a sizable profit. However, Mathews is unwilling to comply to Chandy's demands and complains to the police about Chandy's intrusion into his property. Instead, the policeman works as Chandy's agent, leaving Mathews in a hopeless predicament.\nChandy's false promise of establishing a township enticed the locals to support Chandy. They try to persuade Mathews to sell the property, but he refuses, and the other villagers started hating him for it. Mathews and his father are adamant about staying in the community although several of his friends and neighbours opt to leave by selling their farm to Chandy. The court appoints a one-man committee to visit, submit, and report after Aluva Chandy fabricates many civil complaints against Mathews and his dairy farm using his neighbours for nuisance causes by the farm. When attorney Sunitha visits the farm, she considers it to be quite satisfactory and provides a report to the court. She gets fired from her team by her senior, acting on Chandy's orders. In order to get Jeremias from being imprisoned, several government agencies are now bringing legal claims against Mathews' farm, including allegations of financial irregularities and failure to return the loan.\nA news reporter named Betsy tries to broadcast on her station about the difficulties Mathews is having, but the channel's administrators prevent her from doing so. Sunitha now takes up Mathews' cause, petitions the court on his behalf, and is successful in appointing an \"amicus curiae\" (\"friend of the court\") to investigate shady real estate activities in the State. An effective lawyer named Advocate Prabalan is chosen to serve as the \"amicus curiae.\" The remaining portion of the narrative describes how Mathews, with Prabalan's assistance, uncovers the corruption of numerous government agencies and finally wins back his land.\nCast\n* Mohanlal as Mathews\n* Lalu Alex as Aluva Chandy\n* Thilakan as Jeremias\n* Sreenivasan as Adv.
