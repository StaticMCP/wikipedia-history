Headquartered at 1250 Federal Avenue in Los Angeles, the command oversees about sixty two subordinate units and more than six thousand one hundred soldiers across Arizona, California, and Nevada.\nHistory\nThe headquarters traces its origin to the post World War II period, when the Army chose Los Angeles as the site for a new logistics unit to leverage a large pool of qualified Army Reserve personnel. The unit was activated in 1950 as the 311th Logistical Command. It was redesignated the 311th Support Brigade in 1974 and the 311th Corps Support Command in 1979. In 1981 it became the major support headquarters for I Corps. In 2005, as part of the Army modular transformation, it received its current designation as the 311th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary).\nThe command has supported named operations including Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, and Joint Endeavor in the Balkans. With I Corps, it participated in exercises such as Bold Venture, Cascade Peak, Team Spirit, Yama Sakura, and Border Start.\nDuring the global war on terror era, the 311th deployed to Southwest Asia. The command operated from Camp Arifjan, Kuwait during 2008 to 2009 in support of theater sustainment for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\nElements of the command also served in Afghanistan, including duty associated with theater sustainment at Kandahar Airfield during the early twenty tens.\nMost recently, the headquarters deployed to Kuwait in 2020 and 2021 in support of Operation Spartan Shield, with missions also tied to Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. The unit returned in January 2021.\nMission\nThe 311th commands and controls sustainment units to provide operational and tactical level support, including distribution management, in coordination with a theater sustainment command. On order, it can deploy globally to conduct combat service support operations.\nLineage\n* 1950: Activated in the Army Reserve as the 311th Logistical Command in Los Angeles.\n* 1974: Redesignated as the 311th Support Brigade.\n* 1979: Redesignated as the 311th Corps Support Command (COSCOM).\n* 1981: Became the major support headquarters for I Corps.\n* 1990 to 1991: Supported Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.\n* 2005: Redesignated as the 311th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) as part of the Army modular transformation.\n* 2008 to 2009: Deployed to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, supporting theater sustainment for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n* 2012 to 2013: Headquarters and Headquarters Company deployed to Afghanistan during the Transition I campaign phase.\n* 2020 to 2021: Deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Spartan Shield, with missions tied to Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel; returned in January 2021.\nUnits\nThe 311th ESC falls under the 79th Theater Sustainment Command.

It was redesignated for the 311th Support Brigade on 19 December 1974; for the 311th Corps Support Command on 16 May 1979; and for the 311th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) on 17 March 2006.\nThe insignia consists of three interlaced arrows which symbolize the unit’s mission to provide support in the fields of transportation, quartering, and supply. The arrows also represent strength through unity and the broad logistical functions of the command.\nThe distinctive unit insignia (DUI) was originally approved for the 311th Support Brigade on 4 November 1970. It was redesignated for the 311th Corps Support Command on 16 May 1979, and again redesignated for the 311th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) on 17 March 2006.\nThe design incorporates a chevron, wrench, and wings which together symbolize the command’s motto: \"Provide, Maintain, Sustain.\" The chevron stands for support, the wrench for maintenance, and the wings represent Los Angeles — the \"City of Angels\" — where the command is headquartered. Scarlet and buff are the branch colors of the sustainment and logistics corps.\nCommand team\nAs of 2025 the commanding general is Brigadier General Earl C. \"Chip\" Sparks IV and the command sergeant major is Command Sergeant Major Kristy L.
