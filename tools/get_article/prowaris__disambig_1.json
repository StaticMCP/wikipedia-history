Its leadership attempted to raise a third voice—in order to influence the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party—a voice similar to the leadership of Shahrir Abdul Samad; who was more inline with the ex-prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. ProWaris demanded that Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi resign based on his weak leadership.\nIts president, Feriz Omar, was said to have accused the Malays of lacking the courage to confront the country's leadership issues. Feriz Omar denied making such statements.\nProWaris became inactive and dormant notably after Shahrir lost his bid for a place in the Supreme Council in the party leadership election in 2009 UMNO General Assembly and consequently resigned from the Cabinet.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://porwaris.org Official website]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Non-Governmental-Organization--NGO-/PROWARIS-MALAYSIA-27325272344/ Facebook PROWARIS MALAYSIA]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/Sahabat-Prowaris-159313979549/ Facebook Sahabat Prowaris]"
