Can't say they're not giving you value for your money! .......got early 80's New York thrash-era greats.....and many So-Cal institutions-- Some......hearken back to a time when \"anyone could try it\" meant exhilarating instead of so damn boring. Others.......show the benefit of extended rehearsal with their smashing cuts. It all adds up to a rounded and interesting revolt against robot society,........ indeed.\"\n*Flipside Magazine's Rog said of At War With Society  \"Abrasively angry and amped with an overload of anarchy, this disc full of decadent civil disobedience possesses savage sounds of all-out war being waged against society…Molotov cocktail music that'll enflame your spirit with an undeniable urge to riot and revolt against the moralistic standards of this nations authoritative pomposity. Raw and repulsive punk raw that includes unruly urban upheaval and disorderly disruptiveness....This is the most chaotically charged CD of the century....\"\n*Maximum RockNRoll's Allan McNaughton said of At War With Society  \"...current Top 10 list\"\nReferences"
