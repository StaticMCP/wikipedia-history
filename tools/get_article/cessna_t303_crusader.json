Production ceased in 1986.\nDesign and development\nThe original Cessna 303 Clipper was first flown on February 14, 1978; it was a low-wing four-seat Lycoming-powered twin-engined aircraft that would have competed with the Piper Seminole, Gulfstream American GA-7 Cougar, and Beechcraft Duchess. After market demand for four-place light twins declined, only one 303 Clipper was built before Cessna redesigned the aircraft as a six-seat twin. They also renamed the aircraft out of legal concern, since Pan Am Airlines held the trademark on the name \"Clipper\" in reference to their fleet aircraft.\nThe new model, designated the T303 Crusader first flew on October 17, 1979, with the first deliveries being made in October, 1981. The T303 is an all-metal low-wing six-seat twin-engined aircraft with a retractable tricycle undercarriage. At the time, it was the first all-new production twin built by Cessna in over a decade. With a declining market, only 297 were built.\nExamples were exported to Europe, with several still operating in the United Kingdom in 2012 and two flying in Goondiwindi, Queensland, Australia. Many are still flying in Colombia in air taxi and private operations.\nOperators\nMilitary operators\n;:Haiti Air Corps\n;: Armed Forces of Guatemala\nSpecifications (T303)\n(usable capacity)\n|eng1 number=2\n|eng1 name=Continental TSIO-520-AE/LTSIO-520-AE\n|eng1 type=turbocharged air-cooled flat-six piston engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=250\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=McCauley 3AF32C506/82NEB-8 and 3AF32C507/L82NEB-8 counter rotating constant-speed propellers\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=6\n|prop dia in=10\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=249\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=at\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=226\n|cruise speed note=at  (max cruise, 71% power)\n|stall speed mph=71.5\n|stall speed note=(CAS), flaps down, power off\n|range km=\n|range miles=1174\n|range nmi=\n|range note=econ cruise at  45 min reserves\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=25000\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=1480\n|more performance=*Takeoff distance from 50 ft (15m):\n*Landing distance from 50 ft (15m):\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Bibliography\n* Taylor, John W.R.
