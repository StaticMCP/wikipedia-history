The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns councillors to Redbridge London Borough Council. The ward was subject to boundary revisions in 1978, 2002 and 2018. The revision in 1978 reduced the number of councillors from four to three. Notable councillors have been David Amess and Jas Athwal who became members of parliament.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Term\n!
