In the end, the Chera Perumals were victorious, and they were able to recover the Kollam-Trivandrum-Nagercoil region from the Cholas until the campaigns of Vikrama Chola.\nBackground\nThe southern parts of Kerala (Venad) and the Ay country, as far north as Kollam, came under the Chola rule by 1097 AD. This military thrust was probably conducted by \"Chola-Pandya\" ruler Jatavarman Srivallabha or Chola general Naralokavira Kalinga Rayan for the Chola king Kulottunga I (1070–1120). Records of this campaign mention, among other things, the \"chaver\" warriors in Kuda Malai Nadu (meaning Kerala here) ascending the \"unique heaven\" in battles, \"the subduing of the numerous forces of the Keralas\", \"making the rebel vassal kings obedient\", \"victory over the bow emblem\" and \"the Chera king's retreat from the battlefield\".\nA new era called \"Kollam Azhintha Andu\"  was inaugurated by the Pandyas in 1097 AD. Weakened authority of the Chera Perumal is evident in some of the inscriptions from this period.  In 1099 AD, the leader of the Nair warriors of Nedumpurayur Nadu is seen handling the affairs of the Nedumpuram Thali, an originally state-sponsored temple. Earlier, in 1099, Rama Kulasekhara, with the Four Brahmin Ministers (the Nalu Thali) and the Thrikkunnappuzha, was seen residing and issuing orders from the Great Temple (the Nediya Thali).\nBattle\nAfter the Cholas left, Rama Kulasekhara along with Mana Vikrama would fight a major battle at Poonthura against the Cholas. In the proceeding battle, the Chera Perumals would be victorious, defeating the Chola governor of the region and reconquering the region.\nAftermath\nCholas eventually fixed their boundary at Kottar (leaving the Venad and the Ay country to the Cheras).\nThere is a mention of a council attended by king Rama Kulasekhara and Mana Vikrama Punthurakkon (the future Zamorin, \"the first among the samanthas\") at Kollam in 1102 AD. Rama Kulasekhara publicly atoned for the wrongs committed by him against the Brahmins at this council.\nThe record was probably made in the aftermath of the recovery of Kollam.\nReferences"
