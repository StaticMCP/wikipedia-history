It is native to several islands in the Bismarck Archipelago to the east of New Guinea. Like all paradise kingfishers, this bird has colourful plumage with a red bill and long distinctive tail streamers.\nTaxonomy\nThe first formal description of the black-capped paradise kingfisher was by the English lawyer and zoologist Philip Sclater in 1877. He coined the current binomial name Tanysiptera nigriceps. The genus Tanysiptera had been introduced by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825. The name Tanysiptera is from classical Greek tanusipteros meaning \"long-feathered\". The specific epithet nigriceps is from the Latin niger for \"black\" and -ceps for \"head\". The black-capped paradise kingfisher has sometimes been considered as a subspecies as the buff-breasted paradise kingfisher (Tanysiptera sylvia).\nThere are two subspecies:\n* T. n. leucura Neumann, 1915 – Umboi Island in the Bismarck Archipelago\n* T. n. nigriceps Sclater, PL, 1877 – New Britain and Duke of York Island in the Bismarck Archipelago\nDescription\nThe black-capped paradise kingfisher is  in overall length including the tail streamers and weighs from . The sexes are alike. The adult of the nominate race has a black head, nape, ear-coverts and scapulars. The mantle, rump and two central tail feathers are white. The wings and outer tail feathers are blue. The underparts are a pale yellowish buff. The bill and feet are orange. The subspecies T. s. leucura differs only in having completely white tail feathers.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Tanysiptera-nigriceps Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the Black-capped Paradise Kingfisher]"
