It was also the first tournament since the 46th edition where the final match was not held at the National Stadium in Tokyo, due to major renovations that were scheduled in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Nissan Stadium in Yokohama was chosen as the venue for the 94th Final.\nNormally, the winner would have qualified to the group stage of the 2015 AFC Champions League; however, Gamba Osaka had already qualified for this by virtue of being 2014 J.League Division 1 champions.\nCalendar\nAll dates are in 2014\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
