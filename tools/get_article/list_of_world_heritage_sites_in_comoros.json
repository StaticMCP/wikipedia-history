Cultural heritage comprises monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological ones). Natural heritage comprises natural features (such as physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened flora and fauna), and natural sites which are important for scientific research, conservation or natural aesthetic.  Comoros accepted the convention on September 27, 2000, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As 2024 Comoros has no World Heritage Sites, although there are four tentative sites.\nTentative list\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites for nomination consideration. Nominations for the list are only accepted if the site had been on the tentative list. Comoros has four properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (island)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" |\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Marine Ecosystems in the Comoros Archipelago\n|\n|Mwali, Ngazidja, Ndzwani\n|ix, x (natural)\n| align=\"center\" |2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Terrestrial Ecosystems and Cultural Landscape in the Comoros Archipelago\n|\n|Mwali, Ngazidja, Ndzwani\n|v, vii, ix, x (mixed)\n| align=\"center\" |2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Historical Sultanates of the Comoros\n|\n|Ngazidja, Ndzwani\n|ii, iv, v (cultural)\n| align=\"center\" |2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Cultural landscape of the Perfume Plantations of the Islands of the Moon\n|\n|Ndzwani\n|ii, iv, v (cultural)\n| align=\"center\" |2007\n|\n|}\nReferences"
