After the death of Prince Volodar of Peremyshl, humiliated by his stay in Polish captivity, the throne was assumed by his son Vladimirko, Prince of Zvenyhorod (later Prince of Przemyśl). The young prince, wishing to make up for the losses his family had suffered by paying a ransom for Prince Volodar's release, organised a successful looting expedition against the Polish town of Biecz. However, later that same year, a retaliatory expedition against Vladimir was organised by the Polish Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth. According to the chronicle of Jan Długosz, Bolesław invaded the Principality of Peremyshl and inflicted a military defeat on the young prince in the Battle of Wilichów.\nReferences"
