The battle was part of a seventeen-year struggle between the Hōjō clan and the Uesugi clan for control of the Kantō region which began with the 1524 Siege of Edo. The battle ended with a Hōjō victory.\nReferences\n*Turnbull, Stephen (1998). 'The Samurai Sourcebook'. London: Cassell & Co.\n\n---\n\n## Battle of ozawahara\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Ozawahara"
