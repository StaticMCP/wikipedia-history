In 2012, Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev met Czech president Václav Klaus during an official visit to the Czech Republic and Austria, and discussed deepening of economic cooperation. In 2014, Nazarbayev met president Miloš Zeman, discussing further economic cooperation of the countries and Czech assistance to diversifying of Kazakhstan's economy.\nTrade and economy\nEconomic cooperation between the Czech Republic and Kazakhstan is based on  several bilateral agreements between the countries from 1996, 1998 and 2004. The bilateral trade turnover has grown from $200 in 2009 to $1.2 billion in 2014.
