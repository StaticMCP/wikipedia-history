He was named after his great-uncle Prince Edward Abnel Keliʻiahonui who died at a young age.\nHis grandfather David Kawānanakoa (1868–1908) was officially named as one of the heirs to King David Kalākaua in his will. Although many in the native Hawaiian community considered him the heir to the throne, he considered himself an American citizen.  As one of several heirs to the estate of his great-grandfather James Campbell, he often donated to community charities.  He graduated from Punahou School and then left in 1942 for Menlo College.  While in California, he joined the Army Air Corps and served as a pilot in World War II.  He rejected an appointment to the United States Military Academy and instead obtained a degree from the University of Southern California.\nIn 1946, Kawānanakoa married Lila de Clark Whitaker. In 1960, the couple were divorced. The next year, Kawānanakoa married again to Carolyn Branch and had two children of their own.  On July 29, 1997, Kawānanakoa died and was survived by his wife, eight children and his two sisters, Virginia Poomaikelani Kawānanakoa and Esther Kapiolani Kawānanakoa and cousin Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa.\nHe was buried at the Oahu Cemetery.\nChildren\n* Regina Kawānanakoa (1947 - 2016)\n* Edward A.
