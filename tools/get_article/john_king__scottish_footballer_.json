In 1915 he played a full league match for Newcastle as goalkeeper after regular Bill Mellor was injured, keeping a clean sheet.\nAt international level, King was capped by Scotland Juniors and came into consideration for a full cap, evidenced by his selection for the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots trial match in 1913. He made one appearance for the Scottish League XI in 1912.\nPersonal life\nKing served as a private on home service with the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) during the First World War. His brother Alex (17 years older, leading him to be mistakenly described as an uncle) was a Scottish international footballer. Both had several short spells with hometown team Dykehead between engagements with more prominent clubs.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |National Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Partick Thistle\n|1909–10\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Scottish Division One\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|-\n|1910–11\n|21\n|3\n|1\n|0\n|22\n|3\n|-\n|1911–12\n|22\n|6\n|2\n|0\n|24\n|6\n|-\n|1912–13\n|32\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|34\n|2\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!78\n!11\n!5\n!0\n!83\n!11\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Newcastle United\n|1913–14\n| rowspan=\"2\" |First Division\n|15\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|15\n|1\n|-\n|1914–15\n|18\n|5\n|7\n|2\n|25\n|7\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!33\n!6\n!7\n!2\n!40\n!8\n|-\n|Third Lanark (loan)\n|1915–16\n|Scottish Division One\n|14\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|14\n|2\n|-\n|Motherwell\n|1916–17\n|Scottish Division One\n|29\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|29\n|3\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Partick Thistle\n|1917–18\n|Scottish Division One\n|30\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|30\n|4\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!108\n!15\n!5\n!0\n!113\n!15\n|-\n|Hibernian\n|1918–19\n|Scottish Division One\n|11\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|11\n|2\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Newcastle United\n|1919–20\n| rowspan=\"2\" |First Division\n|9\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|9\n|0\n|-\n|1920–21\n|12\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|12\n|2\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!54\n!8\n!7\n!2\n!61\n!10\n|-\n|Clydebank\n|1921–22\n|Scottish Division One\n|22\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|22\n|4\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!238\n!34\n!12\n!2\n!250\n!36\n|}\nReferences"
