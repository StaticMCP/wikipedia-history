      "text": "# Blue Lambency Downward\n\nBlue Lambency Downward is the third studio album by American avant-garde metal band Kayo Dot, released on Hydra Head Records in May 2008. After much of the group left to pursue outside projects, the only members who remained were frontman Toby Driver and violinist and long-time collaborator Mia Matsumiya. The two began recording the album in early 2007 using a revolving door of contributing musicians. The album is heavily influenced by chamber and orchestral music, and features an abundance of woodwinds. It is widely considered to be Kayo Dot's least heavy album to date.\nThe ensuing tour featured a mostly new group of musicians: Patrick Wolff on woodwinds, Daniel Means on woodwinds and guitar, David Bodie on drums, and Terran Olson on woodwinds and keyboards. Much of the lineup would stay the same for the recording of their next album, Coyote.\nReception\n| rev2 = Drowned in Sound\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Lambgoat\n| rev3Score = 6/10\n| rev4 = Pitchfork Media\n| rev4Score = 3.3/10\n}}\nThe album received mixed reviews. Pitchfork Media criticized it for a lack of memorability, giving it a 3.3 out of 10, while AllMusic was more favorable, giving the album 4 out of 5 stars.
