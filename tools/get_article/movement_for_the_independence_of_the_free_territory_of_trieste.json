Its main goal was the proclamation of independence of the Free Territory of Trieste from Italy.\nThe leader Giovanni Marchesich was continuously elected to the city council from 1962 to 1982. In 1966 the party achieved its best result, winning two seats with 4.40% of the votes.\nGiorgio Marchesich (son of Giovanni), already provincial councillor for the party and member of the List for Trieste and the Julian Front, founded in 2012 the Front for Independence of the Free Territory of Trieste, a party that has inherited the legacy of the Movement for the Independence of the Free Territory of Trieste.
