Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began in Dover on the first Tuesday in January. This date was January 3, 1961, which was two weeks before the beginning of the fifth administrative year of Governor Elbert N. Carvel and at the first administrative year of Eugene Lammot as Lieutenant Governor.\nCurrently the distribution of the Senate Assembly seats was made to seven senators for New Castle County and for five senators to each Kent and Sussex counties. Likewise the current distribution of the House Assembly seats was made to fifteen representatives for New Castle County and for ten representatives each to Kent and Sussex counties. The actual population changes of the county did not directly affect the number of senators or representatives at this time.\nIn the 121st Delaware General Assembly session both chambers had a Democratic majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*John B.
