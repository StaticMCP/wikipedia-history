The formation of local communities is through consultation in the framework of community service set by the village or villages. An RW is further divided into rukun tetangga (RT).\nMost information about governance and functioning of the RW and RT is in Indonesian.\nSome non-Indonesian anthropologists have written about the functions and issues of the RW.\nSee also\n* Barangay\n* Tonarigumi\nNotes\n\n---\n\n## Rukun Warga\n\n#REDIRECT Rukun warga\n}}"
