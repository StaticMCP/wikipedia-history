He reigned for about 41 years from 1022 to his death in 1063, making him the longest reigning Song dynasty emperor. He was the sixth son of his predecessor, Emperor Zhenzong, and was succeeded by his cousin's son, Zhao Shu who took the throne as Emperor Yingzong because his own sons died prematurely.\nEarly life and ascension to the throne\nEmperor Renzong's father Emperor Zhenzong died in 1022 leaving the 12 year-old Renzong as the new emperor. His adoptive mother Empress Liu acted as the regent before Renzong reached maturity. By 1027, Renzong was old enough to rule on his own but Liu refused to step down and ruled until her death in 1033.\nReign\nCompared to other renowned Chinese emperors, Emperor Renzong is less well-known. His reign represented the zenith of the Song Dynasty's influence and power, yet it also marked the onset of a gradual decline that would continue for over one and a half centuries. A contributing factor to this decline was potentially the dynasty's foreign policy during his tenure.\nForeign Policy and Relations\nThe official policy of the Song Empire at the time was of pacifism and this caused the weakening of its military. The Tangut-led Western Xia state took advantage of this deterioration and waged small scale wars against the Song Empire near the borders.\nIn 1038, the Tangut chieftain Li Yuanhao named himself emperor of Da Xia and demanded Emperor Renzong recognise him as an equal. The Song court recognised Li Yuanhao as governor but not as \"emperor\", a title it regarded as exclusive to the Song emperor. After intense diplomatic contacts, in 1043 the Tangut state accepted the recognition of the Song emperor as emperor in exchange for annual gifts, which implied tacit recognition on the part of the Song of the military power of the Tanguts.\nWhen Emperor Renzong came to power, he issued decrees to strengthen the military and paid massive bribes to the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, an adversary of Western Xia, in the hope that this would ensure the safety of the Song Empire. However, these policies involved a heavy price. Taxes were increased severely and the peasants lived in a state of perpetual poverty. This eventually caused organized rebellions to take place throughout the country and the breakdown of the Song government, including that of Nong Zhigao.\nPolitical and Economic Reform\nRenzong is known for his reform attempt known as the Qingli Reforms (庆历新政, Qingli Xinzheng), initiated around 1040–1045, represented a significant reform movement aimed at strengthening the government and improving administrative efficiency. Advocated by the statesman Fan Zhongyan, Fu Bi, Han Qi, and Ouyang Xiu, the reforms were aimed to strengthen agricultural production, reclaim lands, reduce sub-official level administrative units, and more importantly, enhance national defense by organizing local militias and reduce military expenditures. While these policies were progressive and intended to address systemic issues, they encountered resistance from conservative factions within the government and were eventually rescinded following Fan Zhongyan's resignation from office. Despite their brief implementation, the Qingli Reforms are regarded as a precursor to later, more extensive reforms in the Song Dynasty and hold an important place in Chinese historical studies.\nCultural Achievements\nDuring the reign of Emperor Renzong, the Song Dynasty experienced a significant cultural and literary flourishing. This period saw the emergence of some of the most esteemed literati in Chinese history. Figures such as Yan Shu, Fan Zhongyan, Ouyang Xiu and Mei Yaochen all lived through this era and commenced or developed their literary careers during Renzong's reign.\nA landmark event in 1057, under Renzong's rule, was the Imperial Examination, which admitted several candidates destined to achieve nationwide acclaim. Among the candidates were Zeng Gong, Su Shi, and Su Zhe, accompanied by their father Su Xun. These scholars would later be recognized as some of the most influential literati in Chinese history.\nEmperor Renzong elevated the 46th-generation descendants of Confucius to the current title of Duke Yansheng. They were previously of lower noble ranks.\nScience and Technology\nDuring the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022–1063), China experienced notable advancements in science and technology. This period is marked by significant progress in areas such as astronomy, printing technology, agriculture, engineering, and military technology. Astronomical studies led to improvements in the calendar system and the construction of advanced observatories. Agricultural productivity was enhanced through the introduction of new tools and techniques, including the iron plow and the dragon backbone pump. In terms of engineering, the period saw the development of sophisticated construction techniques used in large-scale projects like bridges and dams.\nThe era witnessed a revolution in printing with the invention of movable type by Bi Sheng around 1040. The Song Dynasty is also credited with the first recorded use of gunpowder in warfare, marking a significant development in military technology during Renzong's reign.\nIn 1054 during his reign, Chinese astronomers recorded the explosion of SN 1054, a supernova.\nDeath and Succession\nIn 1055, Emperor Renzong became critically ill and started to worry about having no successor because his sons all died prematurely. Acting on the advice of his ministers, Emperor Renzong agreed to bring two of his younger male relatives into his palace. One of them was his nephew Zhao Zongshi, the future Emperor Yingzong, who was eventually chosen and designated as the Crown Prince.\n, Tomb of Emperor Renzong]]\nRenzong died in 1063 and was succeeded by Emperor Yingzong. The nation mourned his death, from the new Emperor  to the ordinaries. Across the northern border, Emperor Daozong of Liao and his people were also found lamenting in tears, as the two countries enjoyed a relatively peaceful period spanning 42 years during Renzong's reign.\nLegacy\nIn the book History of Song compiled by historians of the Yuan Dynasty, Renzong is portrayed a merciful, tolerant, modest, lenient, and frugal emperor known for restraining his personal sentiments in service to the throne.  As recorded in the book, Emperor Renzong worked late one night and found himself craving mutton. However, just as a servant was about to instruct the cooks to prepare the dish, Renzong intervened. He expressed concern that ordering mutton might lead to excess and wastefulness as the cooks may start to prepare it regularly. Choosing to endure his hunger rather than risk unnecessary waste, he displayed a commitment to frugality and thoughtful governance. On another account, Renzong ordered that officers of government must be very cautious in using the death penalty, and if an officer wrongly sentenced an innocent person to death even once, he would never be promoted. Renzong once remarked to his ministers: \"I have never used the word 'death' to scold others, how dare I abuse the death penalty?\"\nSu Shi remarked about peace and good government during Renzong's period in Song history: “For more than seventy years the Song dynasty has flourished without people knowing the perils of war, but enjoying the blessings of affluence and education.” Song Dynasty Confucian scholar Fan Zuyu also praised Emperor Renzong for his good government, which, he claimed, grew out of the five traditional virtues that distinguished the “benevolent emperor” from all other rulers: “Emperor Renzong feared Heaven, he loved his people, he sacrificed to his ancestors, he was fond of learning, and he obeyed admonitions. Practicing these five virtues is what is called ‘being benevolent.\nConsorts and issue\nOfficial portrait of Empress Cao, wife of Emperor Renzong\n* Empress, of the Guo clan (; 1012–1035)\n* Empress Cisheng, of the Cao clan (; 1016–1079)\n* Empress Wencheng, of the Zhang clan (; 1024–1054)\n** Princess Zhuangshun (; 1040–1042), third daughter\n** Princess Zhuangqi (; 1042–1043), fourth daughter\n** Princess Zhuangshen (; 1044–1045), eighth daughter\n* Noble Consort Zhaojie, of the Miao clan (; 1017–1086)\n** Princess Zhuangxiao (; 1038–1071), first daughter\n*** Married Li Wei (; d. 1086)\n** Zhao Xin, Prince of Yong (; 1039–1041), second son\n* Noble Consort Zhaoshu, of the Zhou clan (; 1022–1114)\n** Princess Lingde (; 1058–1142), tenth daughter\n*** Married Qian Jingzhen of Wuyue, Prince Xianning (; 1043–1126) in 1067, and had issue (one son)\n** Princess Yimu (; d. 1112), 12th daughter\n*** Married Guo Xianqing () in 1082\n* Noble Consort Zhaoyi, of the Zhang clan ()\n* Pure Consort, of the Dong clan (; d. 1062)\n** Princess Zhuangqi (; 1059–1067), ninth daughter\n** Princess Xianyi (; 1059–1083), 11th daughter\n*** Married Cao Shi () in 1076\n** Princess Zhuangyan (; 1061), 13th daughter\n* Virtuous Consort, of the Yu clan (; d. 1064)\n** Zhao Fang, Prince of Yang (; 1037), first son\n** Princess Zhuanghe (; d. 1042), second daughter\n* Virtuous Consort, of the Yang clan (; 1019–1073)\n** Princess Zhuangxuan (; 1042), sixth daughter\n* Able Consort, of the Feng clan ()\n** Princess Zhuangxi (; 1042–1043), fifth daughter\n** Princess Zhuangyi (; d. 1044), seventh daughter\n* Talented Lady, of the Zhu clan ()\n** Zhao Xi, Prince of Jing (; 1041–1043), third son\nLiterary and other Cultural References\n* Portrayed by Qin Yan in the 2018-2019 Chinese TV series  The Story of Minglan\nSee also\n* Chinese emperors family tree (middle)\n* List of emperors of the Song dynasty\n* Architecture of the Song dynasty\n* Culture of the Song dynasty\n* Economy of the Song dynasty\n* History of the Song dynasty\n* Society of the Song dynasty\n* Technology of the Song dynasty\nNotes\nReferences\n[aged 52]"
