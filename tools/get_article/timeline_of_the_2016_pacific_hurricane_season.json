The season officially started on May&nbsp;15 in the eastern Pacific–east of 140°W–and on June&nbsp;1 in the central Pacific–between the International Date Line and 140°W–and ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates typically cover the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. However the first storm, Pali, formed 5 months before the official start of the season on January 7, which broke the record for having the earliest forming storm within the basin.\nDuring the season, 22&nbsp;tropical depressions developed within the basin, 21 of which became tropical storms. 13 of the tropical storms reached hurricane strength, with six achieving major hurricane intensity.|group=\"nb\"}} Additionally, Tropical Storm Otto entered the basin after crossing over from the Atlantic, thus further contributing to the season total.\nFour time zones are utilized in the basin: Central for storms east of 106°W, Mountain between 114.9°W and 106°W, Pacific between 140°W and 115°W, and Hawaii–Aleutian for storms between the International Date Line and 140°W. However, for convenience, all information is listed by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first with the respective local time included in parentheses. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center is included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nTimeline\nJanuary\nJanuary&nbsp;7\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. HST, January&nbsp;6) at  – Tropical Depression One-C develops 935&nbsp;miles (1,505&nbsp;km) south of Johnston Island.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. HST)&nbsp;at  – Tropical Depression One-C strengthens into Tropical Storm Pali while located about 900&nbsp;miles (1,450&nbsp;km) south of Johnston Island, thus becoming the earliest named storm in the Central Pacific.\nJanuary&nbsp;12\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. HST, January&nbsp;11)&nbsp;at  – Tropical Storm Pali strengthens into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the earliest recorded hurricane within the basin, about 615&nbsp;miles (985&nbsp;km) south-southwest of Johnston Island.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m. HST)&nbsp;at  – Hurricane Pali strengthens into a Category 2 hurricane about 725&nbsp;miles (1,165&nbsp;km) south of Johnston Island.
