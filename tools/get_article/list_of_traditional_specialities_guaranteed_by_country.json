Traditional specialities guaranteed (TSGs, singular traditional speciality guaranteed) are traditional food products protected under EU and/or UK law. This label differs from the geographical indications protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI) in that the TSG quality scheme does not certify that the protected food product has a link to a specific geographical area, and thus a TSG product can be produced outside the area or country from which it originates. To qualify for the TSG label, a food product must be of \"specific character\" and its raw materials, production method, or processing must be \"traditional\".\nAll EU TSG registered before 1 January 2021 are also valid in the UK. The EU publishes its designations in the TSG database, and the UK in its TSG register. As of 28 February 2024, 58 names were registered under UK law and 66 under EU law.\nMultiple countries\n{|\n!Countries !! Product name !! Law !! Short description !!

They are eaten throughout Finland as well as in adjacent areas such as Estonia and northern Russia. The oldest traditional pasties usually had a rye crust, but the North Karelian and Ladoga Karelian variants also contained wheat to improve the baking characteristics. The common fillings were barley and talkkuna. In the 19th century, first potato and buckwheat were introduced as fillings, and later also rice and millet. Today, the most familiar and common version has a thin rye crust with a filling of rice. Mashed potato and rice-and-carrot fillings are also commonly available.

The end product is a cloudy beer with phenolic flavors and a distinct taste similar to banana, balanced by the bitterness from the juniper branches. The carbonation level tends to be very low. Sahti was traditionally brewed as a farmhouse ale, but commercial versions are now available. Commercial sahti is usually 8% ABV. In Finland, due to the higher percentage of alcohol in sahti, it is only sold in commercial sahti breweries, pubs or state-owned Alko stores, not in regular markets or grocery stores.
