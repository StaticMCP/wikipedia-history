West Virginia voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.\nOn May 10, 2016, in the presidential primaries, West Virginia  voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, Green, and Libertarian parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote.\nDonald Trump won West Virginia with 68.5% of the vote, his largest share of the vote in any state.  Hillary Clinton received just over a quarter of the vote, with 26.4%. Trump's performance in the state made it his strongest state in the 2016 election by total vote share.\nWest Virginia was also one of two states where Donald Trump won every county, the other being Oklahoma. This was the second consecutive presidential election where every county within the state voted Republican. Trump's 42.1% margin of victory is the largest of any presidential candidate from either party in the state's history, besting Abraham Lincoln's 36.4% margin of victory in 1864. Hillary Clinton's performance was the worst by a major party nominee since 1912, when three candidates split the vote and received over 20% of the vote each, and, as of the 2024 election, remains the worst performance ever by a Democrat in West Virginia. Clinton won fewer votes in the general election than were cast in her party's primary overall, as well as fewer than she received in the 2008 state primary. Clinton also received the fewest votes for a Democrat in a West Virginia presidential election since 1916, exactly 100 years prior.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nSix candidates appeared on the Democratic presidential primary ballot\n(alphabetically):\n*Hillary Clinton\n*Rocky De La Fuente\n*Paul T.

He thus captured all five electoral votes from West Virginia.\nWest Virginia is one of the least-educated states in the country, with only one county having at least 40% of its adult residents with a Bachelor's degree (see the map). That county, Monongalia County (home to West Virginia University), had the smallest swing to Trump out of any county in the state. The rest of the state swung massively to Trump.\nTrump had promised to bring back mining jobs in economically depressed areas of coal country, whereas his opponent had proposed investing millions into converting the region to a producer of green energy. Democrats' championing of environmentalism is viewed as a threat in coal country, and Clinton faced a towering rejection from Mountain State voters. Clinton was also seen as being \"haunted\" by a comment she made within the state itself, in which, while describing the transition to sustainable energy, she stated \"We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"\nWest Virginia was once a solidly Democratic state; it voted Democratic in every election from 1932 to 1996, except for the Republican landslides of 1956, 1972, and 1984. However, in recent years it has drifted to becoming solidly Republican, and has stayed that way since it was won by George W. Bush in 2000. Barack Obama, for example, failed to win even a single county in 2012. West Virginia is one of the two states where Hillary Clinton did not win any counties, the other being Oklahoma, which last voted for a Democrat in 1964.\nThe change to increasing Republican control had also been reflected at the state level. While West Virginia was one of several states with a Democratic governor (Earl Ray Tomblin) in 2016 where Trump won, Republicans had won both chambers of the state legislature in the 2014 elections. In the ensuing years, more statewide executive offices also were won by Republican candidates.\nSee also\n*Democratic Party presidential debates, 2016\n*Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n*Republican Party presidential debates, 2016\n*Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016\nReferences"
