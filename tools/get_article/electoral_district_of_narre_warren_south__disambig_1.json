It has been continuously held by the Labor Party since its creation in 2002.\nHistory\nThe seat was created at the 2002 election. Dale Wilson was the inaugural sitting member, but he was defeated by Tim Holding staffer Judith Graley in a preselection battle in early 2006. Graley then defeated Liberal candidate Michael Shepherdson at the 2006 election, and went on to hold the seat for 12 years before retiring at the 2018 election. She was succeeded by Gary Maas, who has represented the electorate since then.\nThe electorate was significantly reshaped for the 2022 election due to the re-creation of the neighbouring Berwick district and the overpopulation of the Cranbourne district. The Narre Warren South district gained the entirety of Cranbourne North and the remainder of Lynbrook from the Cranbourne district, while losing the area of Berwick it contained, south of the Princes Freeway, to the new Berwick district.\nMembers for Narre Warren South\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Dale Wilson\n| Labor\n| 2002–2006\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Judith Graley\n| Labor\n| 2006–2018\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Gary Maas\n| Labor\n| 2018–present\n|}\nElection results\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/electoral-boundaries/state-districts/narre-warren-south-district Electorate profile: Narre Warren South, Victorian Electoral Commission]"
