The company's products are designed to assist organizations in implementing password policies, detecting compromised credentials, and implementing multifactor authentication.\nHistory\nSpecops Software was founded in 2001 in Stockholm by a group of IT security professionals with the aim of improving password security for Windows-based systems. The firm initially concentrated on products that extended Group Policy and Active Directory password management capabilities.\nIn 2003, Specops Software released its first major product; a password policy and management solution for enterprise IT infrastructures. In the years that followed, the firm expanded its product portfolio to include breached password detection, secure self-service password reset, and multifactor authentication (MFA).\nIn November 2021, Specops Software was acquired by Outpost24, a Sweden-based cybersecurity services provider. With this acquisition, the company  integrated its password and authentication technologies into a broader attack surface management platform.\nBusiness model\nSpecops Software  distributes and licenses software designed specifically for identity and access management in a Microsoft Active Directory environment. It markets products to organizations for enforcing password standards, blocking the use of known-compromised credentials, and controlling authentication workflow. Notable among the company's products include password policy enforcement software, password vulnerabilities auditing, user-initiated password reset, service desk identity verification and multifactor authentication for Windows login, VPN connection, and remote desktop.\nSpecops Software technology is optimized to leverage Microsoft infrastructure and coded with frameworks such as C++ and .NET to provide performance and compatibility. In addition to product development, Specops conducts password security research and publishes technical knowledge in form of regular breach, trend reports and authentication behavior, along with technical analysis.\nPartnerships and alliances\nSpecops Software has partnership agreements in place with Microsoft to provide product integration within Active Directory environments. Specops Software also partnered  with GuidePoint, a US-based security services provider to help organizations address the complexities related to strengthening authentication and protecting identities from increasing attacks by threat actors.\nSee also\n* Active Directory\n* Password policy\n* Multi-factor authentication\n* Password management\n* Identity and access management\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://specopssoft.com/ Official website]"
