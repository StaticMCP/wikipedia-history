The film stars Eugene Domingo, Jennylyn Mercado, Iza Calzado, Cristine Reyes, Bianca King, Eula Valdez and Ruffa Gutierrez.\nPlot\nIn a world where men dominate business and women excel in the office, this movie follows the lives of everyday women navigating their unique challenges.\nPaula (Domingo), the daughter-in-law of Nimfa (Gina Pareño), who reigns as the queen of fake designer bags. Her high earnings support her children’s private school education, compensating for her irresponsible, unemployed husband.\nAda (Mercado), a single mother, juggles her job as a call center agent by night and her studies by day, striving to provide for her young son. However, her dedication strains her relationship with her mother, Sabel (Locsin). Her close friend, Tobz (Aquino), faces his own troubles with his girlfriend, Wendy (Reyes), a busy aspiring actress who neglects him. Her path crosses with Rodney (Rosell), an attorney for celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Cleo Carillo.\nMarilou (Gutierrez), a beauty queen turned CEO after her husband's death, grapples with conflicts involving her stepdaughter Amanda and her own daughter, Dara (King). A Berkeley graduate, Dara strives to prove herself in a television job while managing pressures from home and her boss, Suzanne (Martin). Meanwhile, Theresa (Calzado), a nurse for Dr. Carillo's husband, finds contentment in her work but struggles with a broken heart.\nIn the end, Paula chooses to embrace her role as a loud-mouthed, responsible wife after a brief affair with her temporary driver (Davao). Ada realizes her love for Tobz, while Wendy is left heartbroken when Rodney departs.\nDara showcases her talent by uncovering the truth about activist Dolorosa \"Rose\" Bonefacio (Lopez), and Marilou discovers Amanda's schemes against the company. Finally, Theresa finds closure by forgiving her ex-suitor.\nThis story captures the everyday struggles of women in love, family, finances, and community, serving as a sequel to Ishmael Bernal's blockbuster comedy from the '80s, originally produced by Viva Films.\nCast\nMain cast\n* Eugene Domingo as Paula Cajanding\n* Ruffa Gutierrez as Marilou Cobarrubias\n* Iza Calzado as Theresa \"Tere\" Villanueva\n* Jennylyn Mercado as Ada Rosales\n* Cristine Reyes as Wendy Casuga\n* Bianca King as Dara Dela Vega\n* Eula Valdez as Dra.
