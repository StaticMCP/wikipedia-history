Koyo moves into Maplie Lies dormitory as a caretaker. Unfortunately he walks in on a naked girl named Aroma. The mistake is cleared up by another tenant, Miyuki, an elite volleyball player. Aroma is introduced as an elite basketball player who has recently been struggling. Aroma twists her ankle which Koyo quickly examines. Aroma is confused that his touch was enjoyable. Koyo reveals his parents trained him in Seitai therapy so he knows her troubles are caused by misaligned hips. Despite her reservations she allows him to treat her. She is embarrassed to find the experience arousing but effective as her joints improve immediately. She agrees to let him look after her physical health going forward. Koyo meets the other tenants—elite swimmer Izumi, elite table-tennis player Chiyo and elite footballer Aoba. The Chairman, a friend of Koyo's father, reveals the girls live separately as they have difficult personalities. As they have bright futures as famous athletes, he announces if Koyo keeps them healthy he will get a scholarship to Seiwa's medical programme.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Koyo discovers Aroma and Aoba fight often. While doing laundry Koyo finds a pair of Aroma's panties, which the girls are supposed to wash themselves, making Aroma hate him even more. Immediately afterwards he discovers Chiyo's room is filled with trash, which he trips over, causing him to accidentally grope her breast. Aroma demands he be evicted but oddly Aoba comes to his defence, pointing out the panty incident was clearly Aroma's fault and Chiyo's room is, after all, full of trash to trip over. Aroma unwillingly apologises. That night Aoba demands as payment for defending him a topless massage. Unsure why it must be topless Koyo nevertheless begins the massage and discovers Aoba is underweight with underdeveloped muscles in her lower body and that she carries most of her stress in her upper back. Aoba barely hears any of this as his massage is so intense she almost faints. Afterwards she is frustrated he did not react to her aggressive flirting and decides to seduce him no matter what.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = As Aoba contemplates seducing Koyo, noting that she has never had a boyfriend and desperately wants one, he thinks that she was trying to entrap him to get him fired and resolves to ignore her efforts. He serves her herbal tea before giving her another massage, which she insists on doing in nothing but her panties. The tea makes her sweat, so she removes the panties. The massage is so pleasurable that she cries out, making Izumi walk in and think they were having sex. They deny it, but Izumi decides to use this as material for an apparent erotic novel. Koyo then accuses Aoba of trying to get him fired, which she denies, and is pleased to learn that he was attracted to her. Later, Izumi sends him a message telling him to come to her room.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Koyo finds Izumi drawing an erotic manga. Assuming he is a seducer she demands to know his secret so she can include it in her manga, become a light novel artist, and quit swimming as she has not won a race since entering high school. Afraid of losing his scholarship, Koyo observes her doing well in swimming practice and determines her problem is lack of confidence. He insists on massaging her before her next tournament to help her relax. She insists she will not be seduced by him but his expertise of pressure points plus lavender massage oil causes intense pleasure. He also offers to stimulate a pressure point to help stop her panicking before the race, but the point is on her chest, making her panic.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The vice-principal goes looking for Koyo and Izumi. Izumi remembers she used to love being praised by her mother and coaches, but that praise became disappointment when she stopped winning. Deciding she wants to enjoy swimming again she consents to the chest massage. Koyo begins but Izumi senses he is trying not to touch her breasts, so she gives him permission. Koyo massages her breasts directly to deeply stimulate the pressure point. Izumi resists at first but eventually surrenders to the pleasure. Afterwards she is so relaxed she asks him to do the massage again if she wins the race. The vice-principal accuses Koyo of sex with Izumi. Koyo insists it was a therapeutic massage so she demands he prove his massage skills on her another day or she will have him expelled. Izumi wins her race but doesn't tell her teammates how she got her confidence back. That night, she has a sex dream of Koyo and considers asking him for another massage.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Koyo and Aoba cook a feast to celebrate Izumi's victory, but Izumi stops him from saying he massaged her. Aroma and Izumi become jealous when Aoba flirts with him. Chiyo is sleepy and is scolded for always staying up all night playing online games. Chiyo pulls another online gaming session and is obsessed with beating another player. Koyo enters and offers to massage her to relax her enough to win so she can sleep. He cleans up her room first and she asks him which of the girls he likes, which shocks him. The massage is pleasurable at first, but when he touches her armpits, she reacts in pain. He says based on her musculature and the fact she only drinks water or tea instead of soda, she takes her training seriously. He asks her to endure the massage so that she can reach her full potential.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Koyo performs the massage and Chiyo is in so much pain that she feels like she is being tortured, but she endures it. When it is over, she is surprised to find that she feels better. Instead of continuing her gaming session, she goes to sleep and realizes she has a crush on Koyo. The next day is the first day of school. Koyo, Aroma, and Aoba have the same class and he is forced to hear them bicker. A girl suddenly pulls him aside. She is Moeko Hayami, a member of Miyuki’s volleyball team. Having heard of his talent with massages, she explains her team is going on a bus trip and asks him to meet them before the bus arrives.\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
