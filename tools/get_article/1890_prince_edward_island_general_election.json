This was the only election to produce a minority government for Prince Edward Island, until 2019. In many other elections such as 2019, a party won a majority of the seats without receiving a majority of the vote.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Party\n!Leader\n!1886\n!Seats won\n!% change\n!Popular vote\n!(%)\n|Conservative\n|Neil McLeod\n| align=right|18\n| align=right|15\n| align=right|-17%\n| align=right|\n| align=right|\n|Liberal\n|\n| align=right|12\n| align=right|15\n| align=right|+25%\n| align=right|\n| align=right|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Totals\n| align=right|30\n| align=right|30\n| align=right|\n| align=right|\n| align=right|\n|}\nReferences\n*"
