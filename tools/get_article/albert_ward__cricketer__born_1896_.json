He served in the Royal Flying Corps and its successor, the Royal Air Force, as an enlisted rank during the First World War. Following the war, Ward played first-class cricket for Hampshire, making a single appearance at Southampton against Lancashire in the 1921 County Championship. Playing in the Hampshire side as a right-arm fast bowler, he took a single wicket during the match, that of Charles Hallows, to take match figures of 1 for 57. Batting at number eleven, he was dismissed for 6 runs in Hampshire's first innings by Harry Dean, while in their second innings he was unbeaten on 5 runs. Ward died in Jersey on 5 March 1979.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
