Edwards initially committed to play college baseball for the Charleston Southern Buccaneers, where he would join a high school teammate and friend, Will Bedenbaugh. However, when Bedenbaugh died in a car accident, Edwards couldn't face the idea of playing for the team where his friend's absence would be glaring, and decided instead to pursue professional baseball. He spent his first professional season with the Arizona League Rangers and Spokane Indians. He finished the year 5–3 with a 1.48 earned run average (ERA) and 85 strikeouts over 67 innings pitched. He started the 2013 season with the Hickory Crawdads, going 8–2 with a 1.83 ERA and 122 strikeouts over  innings (18 starts).\nChicago Cubs\nOn July 22, 2013, Edwards along with Mike Olt, Justin Grimm, and a player to be named later (Neil Ramírez) were traded to the Chicago Cubs for Matt Garza.
