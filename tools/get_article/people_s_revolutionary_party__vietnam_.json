In 1976, following the communists' victory and the overthrowing of the South Vietnamese regime, the party was merged with the Workers' Party of Vietnam in North Vietnam to form the modern Communist Party of Vietnam.\nThe PRP was founded on January 1, 1962. Its foundation was publicly announced by Radio Hanoi on January 18, 1962. The stated goals of the party was to combat imperialism, feudalism and colonialism. PRP was not an explicitly communist party, but according to the January 18 Radio Hanoi broadcast, it represented the Marxist–Leninists in South Vietnam. PRP was led by a Central Committee, often referred to as the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN). The smallest organizational unit of PRP was the cell. 1-7 cells constituted a chi bo'', the street or hamlet level organization of the party. PRP was the leading force in the National Liberation Front. Both at national and local levels PRP committees led the NLF work. In the Central Committee there were three main responsibilities, Military Commissar (coordinating the relations with the People's Army of Vietnam), NLF control and general administration. Võ Chí Công was party chairman.\nReferences"
