The Maharana is the head of the Sisodia clan of Rajputs and holds the highest rank among all Rajput princes. The Maharana is also regarded as the Diwan or hereditary high priest of Shree Eklingji, the tutelary deity of the House of Mewar. The Maharana is sometimes addressed as Shriji or Bapji, meaning \"honorable\" or \"sire/father,\" respectively.\nMewar's Gaddi Utsav was held on 2 April 2025 at the Rai Angan courtyard of the City Palace in Udaipur. A havan was performed during the event. His father-in-law, Kanak Vardhan Singh Deo, and Shailesh Lodha, along with other dignitaries, attended the event.
