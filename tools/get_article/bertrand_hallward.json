Among his paternal ancestors were several Anglican clergymen, and on his mother's side he was the nephew of Bertrand Evelyn Mellish Gurdon.\nHe was a pupil at Warden House in Deal, Kent, and at Haileybury College, and later an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge. After two terms teaching at Harrow School he returned to Cambridge as a fellow of Peterhouse, where he quickly developed an interest in academic administration.\nIn 1926 he married Margaret Tait (1900&ndash;1991), the daughter of the Rev. Arthur Tait, Principal of Ridley Hall, Cambridge, and granddaughter of the Rt. Rev. Thomas Drury, Master of St Catharine's College, Cambridge. Bertrand and Margaret had four daughters together.\nAcademic career\ncampus; Hallward was the University's first Vice-Chancellor, from 1948 to 1965.]]\nClifton College\nHaving unsuccessfully applied for the headmastership of Felsted School in 1931, Hallward was offered the position of Headmaster of Clifton College in Bristol in 1939. After a bomb hit the school, he moved the pupils to Bude in Cornwall for the remainder of the Second World War. Returning to Bristol, he set about increasing enrollment and improving the quality of the staff.\nUniversity of Nottingham\nIn 1947, after declining an offer from Charterhouse School, Hallward applied to become principal of University College, Nottingham, which, when his term began the following year, had received full university status. He immediately began enlarging and developing the campus from 122 to 400 acres and enhancing the quality of teaching. He retired from the University of Nottingham in 1965.\nOther interests and later life\nHallward served as chairman of the Nottingham Playhouse for 15 years. On retirement, he built an ocean-going yacht, sailing around the Mediterranean Sea during the summer months.\nHe celebrated his 100th birthday at Peterhouse in 2001 and died in 2003, at the age of 102.\nThe Hallward Library, opened in 1972, at the University of Nottingham was named after him and, after his death, a girls' boarding house at Clifton College was established and named after him (Hallward's House).\nReferences"
