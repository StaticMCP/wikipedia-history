It was created on 27 June 1660 by Charles II for George Warburton, of Arley Hall, Cheshire, whose great-uncle had been Sergeant-at-Law and a Justice of Common Pleas in the time of Charles I. The Warburton family removed from Warburton, Cheshire to Arley in the 14th century. The third Baronet represented Cheshire as a Knight of the Shire. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Baronet in 1813. The Cheshire estates passed into the Egerton-Warburton family and now to Viscountess Ashbrook.\nWarburton baronets, of Arley (1660)\n* Sir George Warburton, 1st Baronet (1622–1676)\n* Sir Peter Warburton, 2nd Baronet (died 1698)\n* Sir George Warburton, 3rd Baronet (1675–1743)\n* Sir Peter Warburton, 4th Baronet (1708–1774)\n* Sir Peter Warburton, 5th Baronet (1754–1813)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* The Baronetage of England Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of all the Baronets now Existing Volume 2, Edward Kimber and Richard Johnson (1771), p.&nbsp;53, Google Books\n*"
