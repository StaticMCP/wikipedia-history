(See also Traditional narratives (Native California).)\nOn-line examples of Maidu narratives\n* [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moajrnl;cc=moajrnl;rgn=full%20text;idno=ahj1472.1-12.001;didno=ahj1472.1-12.001;view=image;seq=0017;node=ahj1472.1-12.001%3A7 \"The California Indians\"] by Stephen Powers (1874)\n* [http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/dawn_of_the_world/ Dawn of the World] by C.
