He was a member of the Wisconsin Senate (1862, 1863) and State Assembly (1870), representing Brown County.  He was postmaster of Green Bay for about 12 years during the 1840s and 1850s.\nBiography\nEdward Hicks was born in Conneaut, Ohio, in October 1818.  He received a common school and academic education, and moved west to the Wisconsin Territory in the early 1840s.  He settled in Green Bay, where he remained for nearly three decades.  Hicks was affiliated with the Democratic Party, and under President James K. Polk, he was appointed postmaster at Green Bay, serving until the end of the Polk administration.  He was subsequently re-appointed postmaster in 1853, under President Franklin Pierce, and was retained as postmaster under President James Buchanan.\nIn 1861, Hicks was the Democratic Party nominee for Wisconsin Senate in the 2nd Senate district, which then comprised Brown and Kewaunee counties.  Hicks faced no opponent in the general election and went on to serve in the 1862 and 1863 sessions of the legislature.  He was not a candidate for re-election in 1863.\nHe was named postmaster of Green Bay again in 1866, under President Andrew Johnson, but he was one of several Johnson nominees ultimately rejected by the Republican Senate.\nIn 1869, Hicks ran for state office again, running as the Democratic nominee for Wisconsin State Assembly in Brown County's 1st Assembly district.  The district then comprised Green Bay and roughly the eastern half of Brown County.  He defeated Republican Louis Schiller in the general election and went on to serve in the 1870 legislative session.\nHicks moved to Sioux City, Iowa, in 1871, after suffering from poor health.  He died of a stroke in Sioux City on May 15, 1873.\nPersonal life and family\nEdward Hicks was the only known son of Joseph Hicks and his wife Sally (' Chamberland).  The Hicks family were descended from Dennis Hicks, who settled at the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the early 1700s.\nEdward Hicks married Charlotte Gertrude Satterlee about 1847, in Stonington, Connecticut.  They had at least three sons.\nElectoral history\nWisconsin Assembly (1869)\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| General Election, November 2, 1869'''\nReferences\n|years= January 3, 1870January 2, 1871 }}\n|years= January 6, 1862January 4, 1864 }}"
