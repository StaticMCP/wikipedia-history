A Rotax 912ULS piston engine driving a tractor propeller is mounted on the leading edge of the wing above the cabin. The enclosed cabin has side-by-side seating with an additional single seat behind, the rear seat can be removed to fit luggage. It has a retractable landing gear with the main wheels moving above the water line on the fuselage side rather than retracting into the fuselage.\nThe design uses the same airfoil as the Antonov An-2 biplane, a TsAGI R-11 (14%).\nNo regular production was ongoing in 2015 and the aircraft was at that time only produced on request.\n|prime units? = met\n|crew=1\n|capacity=2 passengers\n|length m=7.78\n|length ft=23\n|length in=11\n|span m=11\n|span ft=36\n|span in=3\n|height m=3.21\n|height ft=10\n|height in=6.5\n|wing area sqm=15\n|wing area sqft=161.2\n|empty weight kg=440\n|empty weight lb=969\n|gross weight kg=750\n|gross weight lb=1652\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Rotax 912ULS\n|eng1 kw=75\n|eng1 hp=100\n|max speed kmh=165\n|max speed mph=102\n|stall speed kmh=70\n|stall speed mph=43\n|range km=800\n|range miles=432\n|endurance=4 hours 30 minutes\n|climb rate ms=4\n|climb rate ftmin= 800\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
