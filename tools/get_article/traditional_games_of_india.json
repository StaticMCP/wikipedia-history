Their popularity has greatly declined in the modern era, with Western sports having overtaken them during the British Raj, and the Indian government now making some efforts to revive them. Many of these games do not require much equipment or playing space. Some of them are only played in certain regions of India, or may be known by different names and played under different rules and regulations in different regions of the country.\nHistory\n, India's most popular traditional sport, into the Asian Games. |left]]\nAncient era\nKho-kho has been played since at least the fourth century BC. Kabaddi and kho-kho may have had certain aspects of their gameplay mentioned in the Mahabharata, which was written before 300 AD. Atya-patya is mentioned in the Naṟṟiṇai, written in 300 AD or before. Chaturanga is an ancient board game which experienced various modifications as it was transmitted from India toward Europe and became the modern game of chess. Some of these games were used for military training purposes; constant warfare between Indians/against invaders forced an emphasis on physical activities related to fighting. One example of this connection between sports and war was Abhimanyu's piercing of the Chakravyuha as depicted in the Mahabharata, which may have had a connection to the skills used in kabaddi and kho-kho., whose Indonesian variant gobak sodor is pictured here.]]\nTraditional Indian games served various purposes throughout and had various connections to Indian history; for example, certain aspects of the Bengali hopscotch game of ekka-dokka may have represented concepts of social division of property, kabaddi may have been used as a preparation for hunting, and the Bengali tag game of gollachut may have represented escape attempts by agricultural slaves during the Indus Valley Civilization. Hindu teachings placed emphasis on being physically fit, with the Kshatriya warrior caste in particular having to practice martial activities such as archery, while Buddhist teachings were more mixed; Buddha prohibited some traditional games which were considered to be causing negligence amongst people, though he himself played certain other games, such as archery and kabaddi. Buddhist monks, who generally shunned violence, adopted the use of Indian martial arts to protect themselves. Different activities were interrelated; the breathing aspects of kabaddi had connections with the pranayama breath-control techniques from yoga (with kabaddi having been practiced by Buddhist monks), and the martial art of kalaripayattu was practiced in tandem with atya-patya by soldiers in Kerala.\nIndo-Muslim era\nDuring Mughal rule, some of the traditional games were greatly patronised and played in modified ways; for example, Akbar invented a version of polo which could be played at night by setting the ball on fire, and played a magnified version of pachisi with courtesans acting as the pieces on the board. However, Hindu subjects were discouraged from drinking and playing polo, which were apt to make them unruly and rebellious. Wrestling was popular at the time as well, with Persian and Indian forms of wrestling merging to form pehlwani.\nColonial era\n.]]\nDuring the time of the British Raj, Indians began to focus more on playing British sports such as cricket, hockey, and football rather than their traditional sports. Part of the reason behind this was so that they could rise up the ranks by imitating the culture of the colonisers; later on, some Indians also started to see British sports as an activity in which they could \"beat\" their colonisers. The British also at times pushed for the growth of Western physical culture, seeing it as a way to increase the uptake of British culture and values in India, and arguing that Indian men were effeminate and thus needed a more European physical regimen (see Muscular Christianity). This was intertwined with the British promoting the martial race theory, in which the native soldiers that were loyal to the British Empire were seen as brave and well-built for fighting, while the educated dissenters were unfit.\nA notable traditional sport which continued to be played during this time was polo, which the British helped to codify and support as an official sport. Some British board games, such as Snakes and Ladders and Ludo, were also inspired by Indian board games.\nSome self-funded sports clubs, such as the akharas, vyayamshalas, and kreeda mandals promoted and organized competitions at various levels for traditional games during this time. Various traditional games began to be standardized during this period, and some of them were exhibited at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games.\nContemporary era\n, showcasing the game's international growth]]\nIn post-Independent India, the traditional sports' popularity has greatly declined with the further growth of Western sports and online gaming. Kabaddi is the most popular traditional sport, with the highest viewership and most career opportunities; its growth was spurred on by the creation of the Pro Kabaddi League. Kabaddi's growth has led to it spreading outside of South Asia as well, with countries such as South Korea and Iran playing it. Kho-kho has also had a franchise league started for it, Ultimate Kho Kho; the Pro Kabaddi League and Ultimate Kho Kho are respectively the most and third-most viewed non-cricket competitions in India. Panja (arm wrestling) has a professional competition called the Pro Panja League; its exhibition events have received hundreds of millions of views on social media.\nWhereas in the past, traditional Indian games were often played on mud surfaces in rural areas, in the modern day they are often played on matted surfaces with changes to their rule sets and other aspects of their appearance to make them more appealing and exciting. Some traditional games, such as board games and casino card games, are also being digitalised so that they can be played as video games.\nGovernment policy\nTo revive the traditional games, the Indian government started the Bharatiya Khel initiative with the view that these games are more affordable for rural Indians to play, and are important for reviving Indian culture as well as increasing team spirit. And in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, 7th-class textbooks have been issued that include content on traditional games. The government is also planning to introduce some games like kabaddi and kho-kho into the Olympics if it wins a bid to host a future Olympic event, such as its current bid for the 2036 Olympics. The Fit India movement has also contributed to the revival of traditional Indian games, with schools required to include such games as part of physical education.\nCompetitions\nis an initiative of the Indian government to organise sports competitions across the nation. Both Khelo India and the National Games of India include several indigenous sports.]]At the state level, the Chhattisgarhiya Olympics is an annual Chhattisgarhi competition meant for celebrating traditional games; over 3 million people likely participated in the 2023 edition. The Qila Raipur Sports Festival has been celebrating traditional Punjabi sports since 1933.\nGovernance\nThe Association of Traditional Sports and Games, India (ATSGI) was formed in 2020 with the purpose of revitalizing and fostering traditional games and sports, operating under the guidance of the International Council for Traditional Sports and Games (ICTSG) endorsed by UNESCO. Padi Richo, president of the Arunachal Olympic Association, was unanimously elected as president of the ATSGI, with Aman Kumar Sharma in the position of Secretary-General.\nTraditional games\nGilli danda\nGilli danda is similar to many other games around the world, such as the English game of tip-cat, and also has similarities to the British sport of cricket, which is one of the reasons that sport became popular throughout South Asia in the colonial era. It is a game where a player hits a short stick on the ground up into the air using a longer stick held in their hand. They then hit the airborne stick with the hand-held stick again so that it travels as far as possible. If a player on the other team catches the stick before it touches the ground, then the hitter is out (eliminated).\nNondi\nNondi (known by several other regional names) is a game similar to hopscotch. In it, several connected boxes are drawn on the ground, and players throw a rock or similar object onto one of the boxes and then attempt to hop their way to the box the rock lands in.\nBall games\n.]]\nLagori (Seven stones)\nMaram pitti\nBall badminton\nGames involving simple objects\nMarbles\nSome Indian games involving marbles are also known as Kancha/Kanche or Golli Gundu. Several games are played involving players flicking marbles at other marbles, often in order to \"capture\" as many marbles as possible by the end of the game to win.\nGutte\nVariations of tag\nThere are several Indian variations of the game of tag (sometimes referred to in India as \"running and catching\" or in Hindi, pakdam pakdai), with kabaddi and kho-kho being the two most popular such games and being played in professional leagues (Pro Kabaddi League and Ultimate Kho Kho respectively).\nDeciding who the denner is\nIn many Indian variations of tag, the player who is supposed to tag the other players is referred to as the \"denner\". There are a number of ways of determining which player should be the denner; one such method is Saa Boo Three (also known as pugam pugai), in which three players face one of their hands either up or down, and if one of them faces their hand the opposite direction of the other two, then that player is the denner.\nKabaddi\nKho-kho\nLangdi\nAtya-patya\nChor Police\nOonch Neech\nDog and the bone\nIn Dog and the Bone (known by various names in India, such as \"Cheel Jhapatta\", and more commonly in other parts of the world as \"steal the bacon\"), there is an object placed in the centre of the field, with two teams placed on opposite ends of the field. One player from each team rushes towards the object to try to take it back to their team; a point is scored either if a player successfully retrieves the object, or if a player tags an opponent who is holding the object before the opponent safely makes it back.\nRiver or mountain\nRiver or mountain, which is known as Nadi ki Pahad in Hindi, and Nadee-Parvat in Marathi and other regional languages, is a game where the field is divided into areas referred to as \"rivers\" and \"mountains\". At the start of play, the denner shouts out either \"river\" or \"mountain\", with all players then attempting to go to the areas referred to by the denner. While outside of those areas, the players can be tagged and eliminated by the denner.\nSurr\nSaakli (Chain tag)\nChain tag involves the denner tagging other players, who are then required to form a chain with the denner by holding hands. Only the two players at either end of the chain can tag the remaining players (since they have a free hand not trapped in the chain.) The game ends once all players are part of the chain.\nLock and key\nAlso known as Vish-Amrit/Vish-Amrut (Poison-Antidote), lock and key is similar to the Western game of freeze tag, in which the denner(s) can \"freeze\" opponents by tagging them, with the frozen players' teammates able to \"unfreeze\" them by tagging them. A unique feature of lock and key is that players may be required to shout out \"lock\" or \"key\", as appropriate, when tagging other players.\nAankh micholi\nAankh micholi is the Hindi name for blind man's buff (blindfolded tag).\nKokla chappaki\nOne player goes around all the other players, who sit in a circle, and eventually drops a handkerchief behind one of them. That player must grab the cloth and then attempt to tag the first player.\nFour corners\nPlayers attempt to run between the four corners of a square without being tagged by the denner, who is in the middle of the square. In a Telugu variation of the game, Nalugu Stambalata, there is a pole in each corner of the square that the players must touch. In Maharashtra, the game is known as \"Khamb-Khambolya\".\nGella-Chutt\nTree-climbing monkey\nThe denner tries to tag players who can climb up trees to escape; these players can try to touch a stick kept within a circle on the ground in order to become safe from the denner. Variants of this game are also known as \"Surparambya\" or \"Surparambi\".\nLabbo-Daal\nAlso known as \"kiss the stick\" or \"Soljhapta\" in Bengali, this variation of tree-climbing monkey sees the denner attempting to rush back to kiss the stick after tagging another player, while the other players try to thwart the denner by picking the stick up and throwing it away before the denner can kiss it.\nChappa-pani\nPlayers who are squatting can't be tagged by the denner in this game, but they can only stand up when touched by players who are standing up. This game is also known as Uthali.\nLimbdi-pipali\nPlayers can avoid being tagged in this game by climbing a tree.\nVagh-bakri\nOne player is the \"shepherd\", and all but one of the players, known as \"lambs\" or \"goats\", form a chain behind the shepherd by grabbing each other's waists. The lambs are required to remain in this chain formation. The last player (the \"tiger\") has to try to capture the lambs by getting around the shepherd, who is allowed to move around. Once a lamb is tagged, they become the new tiger and play restarts.\nBoard games\nIndian board games have a long history, and have been found etched into the floors and surfaces of ancient temples throughout the country.\nCarrom\nChaturanga\nPachisi\nLambs and tigers\nSnakes and ladders\nSnooker\nPallanguzhi\nCard games\nGanjifa\nTeen patti\nBoat racing\nVallam kali\nHiyang Tannaba\nEvents involving animals\nparticipant driving his two bulls forward.]]\nKambala\nKambala involves one person racing a pair of bulls across a paddy field.\nJallikattu\nPolo\nMiscellaneous games\nAntakshari\nKite-flying\nPanja (arm wrestling)\nArm wrestling is a popular pastime in India, with India having a professional arm wrestling competition known as the Pro Panja League.\nRaja Mantri Chor Sipahi\nToys\nBhatukali\nBhatukali involves children playing with a mock set of kitchen items, with the intention of being taught how to do kitchen-related work. Bhatukali dates back to ancient times, as evidenced by its presence in literary works such as the Dnyaneshwari and Kama Sutra.\nDug dugi\nDug dugi is a type of rattle for children to play with. A dug dugi has a core with strings on either side attached to small stone-like objects; once the dug dugi is shaken, the stones hit the core from either side to make sound.\nGulel\nChildren often play with a slingshot (gulel in Hindi), which traditionally was also used for hunting purposes.\nPambaram\nRegional games\nYubi lakpi\nDhopkhel\nSee also\n*Indian physical culture\n*History of India\n*List of Indian inventions and discoveries\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://journals.christuniversity.in/index.php/artha/article/view/4435 Indigenous Sports of India: Connecting Past to the Present]\n* [http://eprajournals.net/index.php/IJRD/article/view/836 INDIGENOUS GAMES IN INDIA: THEN & NOW]\nExternal links\n* https://bharatiyakhel.in/ - the official Indian government website for traditional Indian games\n* [https://sevikasamiti.org/resources/RSS/Publications/Khel%20Book.pdf Khel Book]\n* [http://tsgindia.org/ Association of Traditional Sports and Games, India]\n* [https://www.unesco.org/en/sport-and-anti-doping/traditional-sports-and-games UNESCO TSG]"
