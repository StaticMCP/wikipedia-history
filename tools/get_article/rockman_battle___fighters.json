      "text": "# Rockman Battle & Fighters\n\n}}\n| genre = Fighting\n| modes = Single-player, multiplayer\n| platforms = Neo Geo Pocket Color\n}}\nis a 2000 fighting game developed and published by Capcom for the Neo Geo Pocket Color handheld system in 2000. It is a portable version of the two arcade fighting games Mega Man: The Power Battle, and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters. The game involves choosing one of four characters and fighting through a series of boss battles. The game was originally only released in Japan, but an emulated version was released worldwide in 2022 as Mega Man Battle & Fighters for the Nintendo Switch. This version was included as part of Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 for Switch and Microsoft Windows later that year.\nGameplay\nRockman Battle & Fighters is a single-player fighting game. As in Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, players control one of four characters (Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo) and choose between three sets of boss battles with various Robot Masters from the first seven Mega Man games. The battles are fought linearly in any order and after each boss is defeated, a special weapon is added to the player's arsenal. Each boss is weak to one specific weapon, so the player is encouraged to strategize the order in which the bosses are faced. Players will battle six robot masters before challenging a sub-boss and a final boss battle against Dr. Wily. By playing the game, players will unlock entries in an in-game database for each of the main characters and bosses. Two players can use a link cable to transfer database information between systems, but no co-op or versus play is supported. The digital re-releases omit the database transfer feature but add the ability to rewind gameplay. The western release do not feature any in-game translation outside of the manual.\n|IGN=8/10\n|NLife=7/10\n}}\nCritical reception for Rockman Battle & Fighters is mixed. Tim Torres of 2D-X called the game \"tightly designed and wonderfully animated\", and summarizing it as \"way better than it has any right to be\". Colin Williamson of IGN stated, \"I really enjoyed this one. Boss encounters have always been one of the big perks of the Mega Man series, and porting over not one, but two arcade games in the same package was a stroke of good fortune. I wish there was a little more to do with the link cable, but this is a fine little action game for one of the best 'dead' portable game systems out there\". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com didn't recommend the game, but found it to be \"a fun (and cute) portable diversion\".\nIn 2023, Time Extension identified Rockman Battle & Fighters as one of the best games for the NGPC.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000918115448/http://www.capcom.co.jp/newproducts/consumer/ngprock/ Official website]\n*Rockman Battle & Fighters can be played for free in the browser on the Internet Archive"
