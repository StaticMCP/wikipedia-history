Judges are treated as having concurred in another's judgment when they either formally attach themselves to the judgment of another or speak only to acknowledge their concurrence with one or more judges. Any judgment which reaches a conclusion which differs from the majority on one or more major points of the appeal has been treated as dissent.\nAll dates are for 2023 unless expressly stated otherwise.\n2023 case summaries\nUnless otherwise noted, cases were heard by a panel of 5 judges.\nCases involving Scots law are highlighted in orange. Cases involving Northern Irish law are highlighted in green.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=400 |  Case name\n! width=120 |  Citation\n! width=100 |  Date\n! Legal subject\n! Summary of decision\n|-\n| ''Trustees of the Barry Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses v BXB''\n| [2023] [https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2023/15.html UKSC 15]\n| 26 April 2023\n| Tort law, Vicarious liability\n| The two-stage test for vicarious liability applies equally to cases of sexual abuse. Merely satisfying the 'but-for' test does not suffice to fulfill the second stage, which is the close connection test. In complex cases, it can be helpful to assess whether the outcome aligns with the underlying policy to ensure justice is served.\n|-\n| Jalla & Anor v Shell International Trading and Shipping Co Ltd & Anor\n| [2023] [https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2023/16.html UKSC 16]\n| 10 May 2023\n| Tort law, Private nuisance, Limitation periods\n| A one-off event, such as an oil spill or a flood, does not qualify as a continuing private nuisance unless it involves repeated activity by the defendant or an ongoing condition for which the defendant is responsible, causing non-stop interference with the use and enjoyment of the claimant's land. The limitation period for filing a claim does not reset daily merely because the effects of the event persist.\n|-\n| Wolverhampton City Council v London Gypsies and Travellers\n| [2023] [https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2023/47.html UKSC 47]\n| 29 November 2023\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/2023.html Supreme Court decided cases (2023)]"
