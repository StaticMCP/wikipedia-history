Three NCAA-sponsored sports (men’s indoor track, men’s tennis, and women’s water polo), and four non-NCAA sponsored sports (men’s rowing, men’s and women’s squash, and sailing) were discontinued.\nFootball\nGeorge Washington University's football program ran from 1881 to 1966.\nThe final George Washington game came on Thanksgiving Day in 1966, when the team lost to Villanova, 16–7. GW ended the season with a 4–6 record (conference: 4–3) and Jim Camp was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year. On January 19, 1967, the board of trustees voted to end the football program. Poor game attendance and the expense of the program contributed to the decision. A former GW player, Harry Ledford, believed that most people were unwilling to commute into Washington, D.C., which did not have a metro rail at the time, on Friday nights to Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. Additionally, the nearby football teams of the University of Maryland and the University of Virginia were nationally competitive, and drew potential suburban spectators away from GW.\nFacilities\nSource\n{| class=\"wikitable\"; style= \"text-align: \"\n! width= px style=\"\"| Venue\n! width= px style=\"\"| Sport\n|-\n| Barcroft Park || Baseball\n|-\n| Charles E.
