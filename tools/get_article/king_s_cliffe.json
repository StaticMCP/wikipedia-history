The parish adjoins the county boundary with the City of Peterborough and the village is about  west of the city centre. The village is not far from the Northamptonshire boundaries with both Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire, and is about  south of Stamford.\nPopulation\nThe 2001 census recorded a parish population of 1,137 people, increasing to 1,202 at the 2011 Census. This later increased to 1,585 at the 2021 Census.\nThe 1871 census recorded a parish population of 1,259. The 1891 census recorded the parish population as having fallen to 1,082, occupying 262 \"inhabited houses\"\nKing's Cliffe is very small but is growing in size. There is a school named King's Cliffe Endowed Primary. It used to be located next to John Wooding's Groceries but in recent years, a new building was developed on King's Forest. This new school is very large in size and is very advanced.\nParish church\nThe Church of England parish church of All Saints has a central tower that is Norman, with late 13th century upper parts and broach spire. The nave has a Decorated Gothic west window and there are north and south aisles with 14th century arcades. The font is also 14th century. Later features are the Perpendicular Gothic clerestory, roof and remodelling of the north and south arches supporting the tower. Inside the church is a monument erected in 1623 to the Thorpe family, whose descendant John Thorpe (1565–1655) was a notable Elizabethan and Jacobean architect.\nHistory\nHall Yard Farmhouse was built in 1603. Inside the house, Dr Law's Music Room has an 18th-century Georgian coved ceiling with decoration in the style of Robert Adam. Law's Chapel, also 18th century, is nearby.\nParts of King's Cliffe Manor House are early 17th century.\nIn the summer of 1845, the Reverend Miles Joseph Berkeley, the rector of All Saints' church, proposed, after observing potatoes from near the village struck by potato blight, that the causative agent of the blight was a fungus. This was contradictory to theories at the time, which suggested that the fungus was merely a symptom of decay, and not the causative agent of the blight. Berkeley labelled the fungus he found Botrytis infestans, now known as Phytophthora infestans.\nKing's Cliffe is unusual in having three sets of almshouses. The John Thorpe Almshouses were built in 1668, the Widows' Almshouses in 1749 and the Spinsters' Almshouses in 1754. The Widows' and Spinsters' almshouses were part of a set of charities founded by Rev. Dr William Law (1686–1761) and his disciple, Mrs Elizabeth Hutcheson. A house dating from about 1700 was made a Schoolmaster's House in 1745, and next to it the Boys' School was built in 1748. From 1752 the Schoolmaster's House became Law's Library, which housed Law's religious books and lent them to people of King's Cliffe and neighbouring towns.\nKing's Cliffe railway station was on a branch line that ran between  and . The London and North Western Railway opened it in 1879 and British Railways closed it in 1966.\nLocated between the village and neighbouring Wansford, Cambridgeshire, RAF King's Cliffe became operational in October 1941. the new airfield was located on the site of a former Royal Flying Corps landing ground that was used in 1916 and 1917 by No. 75 Squadron RAF for Home Defence duties. On opening in 1941 it was a Royal Air Force Fighter Station and was initially home to No. 266 Squadron RAF who were followed by No. 616 Squadron RAuxAF and then No. 485 Squadron RNZAF. From 1943 the airfield hosted a number of non operation units of the RAF and US Eighth Air Force. From August 1943 until October 1945 the airfield was assigned to the US 20th Fighter Group who flew missions over occupied Europe. Post-War the airfield was used briefly as a repatriation centre for German Prisoners of War and also for ammunition storage. The site was returned to agricultural use in 1959.\nIn July 2024 a small museum opened on the site of the airfield.\nNotable residents\n*Miles Joseph Berkeley FRS – mycologist and Perpetual Curate (Vicar) of Apethorpe and Woodnewton who lived in Kingscliffe 1833–1869, opening a school in 1838.\n*Ruth Ellen Berkeley (1845–1914) – scientific botanical illustrator was born and brought up in the village.\n*Henry Bonney D.D.
