It has been awarded by the players to the best player of the season annually since 1982. It is the AFLPA equivalent of the Brownlow Medal (voted for by umpires), and a variety of media-sponsored MVP awards. Gary Ablett, Jr. (2007–09, 2012–13) is the only player to win the award five times, while Marcus Bontempelli (2021, 2023–24) has won the award three times. Greg Williams (1985, 1994), Wayne Carey (1995, 1998), Michael Voss (2002, 2003), Chris Judd (2006, 2011) and Nat Fyfe (2014, 2015) have won the award twice.\nIn the AFL Women's, it has been awarded since the inaugural season in 2017. Erin Phillips and Jasmine Garner are the only two players to win the award on multiple occasions.\nVFL/AFL (Leigh Matthews Trophy)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Season\n! Player\n!

Michael Voss won the award four times from 2001 to 2004, the most of any player.\nIn the AFL Women's, the award has been given since the inaugural season in 2017. Daisy Pearce holds the record for most wins with four, in 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2022 (S6).\nVFL/AFL\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Season\n! Player\n!

It is awarded to the best adjudged player who is in his first year on an AFL list. The eligibility for the award is different from the AFL's other main award for the best performing young player, the AFL Rising Star, which can be won by any player aged under 21 as of 1 January that year, and who has not played more than ten matches before the start of the season. Michael Barlow, for example, won the award in 2010 but was not eligible for the Rising Star. Brownlow Medallists Adam Goodes and Chris Judd have both won the award in the past.\nIn the AFL Women's, the award has been given since the second season in 2018. There is a similarly decreased focus on youth—for example, Richmond's Eilish Sheerin won the award in 2022 (S7) at the age of 30.\nAFL\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Season\n! Player\n!

It has been awarded annually since 1991 to the most courageous player in the league. The award is named after the Australian sportsman Robert Rose, who became a quadriplegic in 1974 after a car accident. Glenn Archer has won the award most often (with six wins), while Paul Kelly won it five times, including four consecutively from 1994 to 1997. Jonathan Brown won the award in 2007, 2008 and 2011. In 2009, Joel Selwood won the award for the first time, and then won it three consecutive times from 2012 to 2014.\nIn the AFL Women's, the award has been given since the inaugural season in 2017. Chelsea Randall has won the award six times (in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 (S7) and 2024), the most of any player.\nVFL/AFL (Robert Rose Award)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Season\n!
