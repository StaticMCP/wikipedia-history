The Gau was made up from the former Polish Voivodeship of Poznań and parts of Warsaw Voivodeship and Łódź Voivodeship which had been occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939 and incorporated into the Third Reich. The league and the region are named after the local river Warthe (Polish:Warta), and not after the Prussian province Posen, which it had been from 1848 to 1918.\nOverview\nThe league was introduced by the Nazi Sports Office in 1941, a considerable time after the defeat of Poland. The league started out in two groups of five teams, with the two divisional champions playing each other in a home-and-away series to determine the Gauliga champion. The league champion then qualified for the German championship. Polish clubs were not permitted to take part in the competition, only clubs from the German ethnic minority, which made up between five and ten percent of the population in the region and about two percent of the overall population of Poland.\nIn its second season, the league played with ten teams in a single division. The bottom three teams were relegated at the end of the season. The 1943-44 edition initially saw no change, but the SG Freihaus dropped out of the league during the season and not all games were played throughout the season.\nThe imminent collapse of Nazi Germany in 1945 affected play throughout the country with Gauliga competition in this region coming to a halt in 1944. There is no record that the 1944-45 season here ever commenced.\nFounding members of the league\nThe ten founding members were:\nGroup I:\n* Deutscher SC Posen\n* BSG DWM Posen\n* SG Ordnungspolizei Posen\n* Reichsbahn SG Posen\n* Post SG Posen\nGroup II:\n* SG Ordnungspolizei Litzmannstadt\n* Union 97 Litzmannstadt\n* SG Zduńska Wola (1943 SG Freihaus)\n* Reichsbahn SG Litzmannstadt\n* SG Sturm Pabianitz\nLitzmannstadt was the German name for Łódź from 1939 to 1945, named after Karl Litzmann.\nWinners and runners-up of the league\nThe winners and runners-up of the league:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\"\n!width=\"70\"|Season\n!width=\"250\"|Winner\n!width=\"250\"|Runner-Up\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1941-42\n|SG Ordnungspolizei Litzmannstadt\n|Deutscher SC Posen\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1942-43\n|BSG DWM Posen\n|SG Ordnungspolizei Posen\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1943-44\n|BSG DWM Posen\n|SG Ordnungspolizei Posen\n|}\nPlacings in the league 1941-44\nThe complete list of clubs in the league:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Wartheland came under Soviet control before again becoming part of Poland again. The German population was almost completely expelled from the region and all German football clubs were dissolved.\nReferences\nSources\n* Die deutschen Gauligen 1933-45 - Heft 1-3  Tables of the Gauligas 1933-45, publisher: DSFS\n* Kicker Almanach,  The yearbook on German football from Bundesliga to Oberliga, since 1937, published by the Kicker Sports Magazine\nExternal links\n*  [http://www.f-archiv.de/ The Gauligas] Das Deutsche Fussball Archiv\n* [https://www.rsssf.org/tablesd/duithistpre45.html Germany - Championships 1902-1945] at RSSSF.com\n* [https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/crossborder.html Where's My Country?] Article on cross-border movements of football clubs, at RSSSF.com"
