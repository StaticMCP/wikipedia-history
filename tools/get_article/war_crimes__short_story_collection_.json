One is conscious of the elaborate construction of other worlds, as close to ours as the reflection in a faintly distorting mirror. The discrepancies tantalise. Carey mostly writes in a grave formal prose the more surrealistic the stories...Myths, fables for our time, worlds of the imagination that illuminate as they cast doubt on the real world: Carey's stories are a stimulating excursion into the relevance of the mysterious. He charms, he amazes, he appals, he amuses; our emotions are not often run through so full a gamut.\"\nPublication history\nAfter its original publication in 1979 the collection was reprinted by the University of Queensland Press in 1981 and 1984.\nAwards\nThe collection won the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction in 1980.\nSee also\n* 1979 in Australian literature\nReferences"
