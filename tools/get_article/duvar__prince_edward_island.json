It lies to the north of O'Leary and is situated within the Prince County census division.\nName\nThe community of Duvar was named after John Hunter-Duvar, a fisheries inspector and poet. In 1861, to distinguish himself from others with the common name John Hunter, he adopted the name \"Duvar.\" The name \"Duvar Road\" was in use by 1872, and a post office named Duvar Road operated from 1896 to 1914.\nReferences"
