In 2024, RCA claimed 630 members.\nHistory\nIn 1998, supporters of the International Marxist Tendency (IMT) in the United States created the group as Youth for International Socialism (YIS), which published New Youth. In June 2002, YIS renamed itself to the Workers' International League (WIL) and its newspaper to Socialist Appeal. The group was usually known as Socialist Appeal (SA). In 2017, WIL renamed its newspaper to Socialist Revolution. The group was usually known as Socialist Revolution (SR). In 2024, WIL renamed itself to the Revolutionary Communists of America and its newspaper to The Communist, as part of an IMT-wide rebranding that uses orthodox Communist nomenclature and symbols such as the hammer and sickle.\nIn 2020, after the rapid growth of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), many SR members joined DSA chapters. In contrast to the DSA's current strategy, in which virtually all elected DSA endorsees won on the Democratic Party ballot line, SR members demand \"an immediate and total break with the Democrats\".\nIn 2022, conservative website Campus Reform negatively covered SR's \"Socialist Solution to Fight COVID-19\" events and \"Marxist School\" events, where a Turning Point USA reporter noted that the Socialist Revolution organizers \"allegedly called for a revolution\".\nIn 2024, after its founding convention, RCA held a rally of 300-500 people in Philadelphia. When Elon Musk replied with \"!\" to a video of this on X, the RCA said \"billionaires are parasites\".\nIn 2025, RCA members joined the No Kings protests in Chicago and New Orleans.\nIn 2025, RCA claimed that Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) endorsee Zohran Mamdani was trying to \"divide the working class against one another\" by supporting congestion pricing. RCA also claimed that Mamdani was \"deceiving the working class\" by running on the Democratic Party ballot line.\nPolitical positions\nBoth the RCI as a whole and the RCA in particular deny the Big Bang, which RCA calls \"an idealistic notion of an origin to the universe\", a \"broken theory\", and a \"modern creation myth\".\nSee also\n* American Left\n* Democratic Socialists of America\n* Socialist Alternative\n* Revolutionary Communist International\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20240104125959/https://socialistrevolution.org/ 2024 archive of SocialistRevolution.org]"
