The named award is given to the work adjudicated to be the most significant for the advancement of public architecture in that year. Alongside the Named Award, National Awards and National Commendations are also given by the jury.\nBackground\nDefinition of the award\nThe award recognises 'completed works of architecture of the highest quality' in the public architecture category. Originally the award was offered for 'non–residential buildings' with winning and commended projects including a wide array of building types including; cultural, education, health, transport, sports facilities, tourism, infrastructure, religion, justice, correctional facilities, war memorials, public administration, commercial buildings and a fountain.\nProjects in this awards category must be predominantly of a public or institutional nature and generally fall within Building Code of Australia (BCA) Class 9, excluding projects within the definition of 'Educational Architecture or any BCA Class 9b building used primarily for educational purposes'. Projects awarded Named Awards and Architecture Awards by state-based Chapters of the AIA will be considered for a National Award in the same year. Since 2015 education projects have been assessed in a separate award category for the Daryl Jackson Award for Educational Architecture.\nZelman Cowen\nThe named award recognises Sir Zelman Cowen, a 1953 Fulbright Senior Scholar in Law from the University of Melbourne and Harvard University, a prominent legal scholar and university administrator, and later the 19th Governor General of Australia (1977—1982) at the time of the inception of the new national RAIA awards established in 1981.\nNamed award winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Sir Zelman Cowen

the Sir Zelman Cowen Award saw a wide distribution of winners by location with three winners in the Australian Capital Territory, three in Queensland, two in Victoria and one each in Northern Territory and Western Australia. An award was not made in New South Wales until 1998 for Olympic Park Station. Around 60% of awarded buildings were paid for with public funds and 40% with private funding. Cultural projects have accounted for around 40% of all awards, followed by education (20%) and transport (9%).\nCommendations (1981—2006)\nFrom the inception of the award commendations were an optional award allocated at the jury's discretion. Only six commendations were given in the first ten years of the award. Fourteen were awarded in the next decade (between 1992 and 2001), and overall 26 commendations were made in 24 years, averaging around one per year.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Sir Zelman Cowen Award Commendations 1982—2006\n|-\n!
