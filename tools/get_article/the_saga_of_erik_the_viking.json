      "text": "# The Saga of Erik the Viking\n\nThe Saga of Erik the Viking is a children's novel written by the Welsh comedian Terry Jones, illustrated by Michael Foreman, and published by Pavilion in 1983. Foreman was commended for the annual Greenaway Medal by the Library Association, recognising the year's best-illustrated children's book by a British subject.\nAccording to one library record, \"A Viking warrior who lived hundreds of years ago sets sail with his men on the Golden Dragon to find the land where the sun goes at night.\"\nAdaptations\nThe book was loosely adapted and directed by Jones as a 1989 film Erik the Viking. The film inspired a comic book adaptation by Graham Thompson.\nAn officially licensed computer adventure game with the same name was written by Level 9 Computing and released by Mosaic Publishing in 1984. It also featured a completely different plot.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/28949/the-saga-of-erik-the-viking/9780140322613.html Erik the Viking at Puffin Books]"
