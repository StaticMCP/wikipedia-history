Khwarasan was commanded by a spahbed from one of the seven Parthian clans. The appointed spahbed of the kust was given the title of aspbed.\nThe name Khwarasan is a combination of khwar (meaning \"sun\") and āsān (from āyān, literally meaning \"to come\" or \"coming\" or \"about to come\").\nSee also\n* Greater Khorasan\nSources\n* James Howard-Johnston, ‘The Late Sasanian Army’.
