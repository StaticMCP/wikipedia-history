People from Nepal living in the UK belong to many different Nepalese ethnic groups or castes and may have different languages although all speak Nepali as a mother tongue.\nIn 1965, the first settlement of London's Nepalese community was made at 145 Whitfield Street in Camden. A commemorative plaque now stands on the site.\nDemographics\nThe 2001 UK Census recorded 5,943 Nepali-born people were residing in the UK.
