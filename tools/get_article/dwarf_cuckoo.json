Following the discovery that it belongs to a distinct lineage around the little cuckoo, the genus Coccycua has been reinstated for these.\nIt is found in Brazil, Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, and heavily degraded former forest.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf Cuckoo\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf cuckoo\n}}"
