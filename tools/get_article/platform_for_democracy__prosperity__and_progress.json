All four parties will run on REPER's electoral lists to circumvent the raised electoral threshold for coalitions.\nThe parties have widely differing views on economic issues, with REPER supporting economic liberalism while Demos is a democratic socialist party. However, all four parties share progressive views on social issues and support further European integration.\nComposition\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!Abbr.\n!Ideology\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Renewing Romania's European Project\n|REPER\n|Liberalism\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Democracy and Solidarity Party\n|Demos\n|Democratic socialism\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|NOW Party\n|ACUM\n|Green politics\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Volt Romania\n|Volt\n|Social liberalism\n|}\nSee also\n*Health Education Nature Sustainability Party\n*Justice and Respect in Europe for All Party\nReferences"
