It is meant for senior researchers, while the \"Goldberg Graduate Award\" is meant to recognise the achievements of graduate students.\nExamples of areas that are of interest to the committee in selecting candidates for the Covey Award include: computational philosophy, the philosophy of artificial intelligence, information and computer ethics and the philosophy of information.\nThe association selected the name of Preston Covey for this award because his life's work exemplified a philosophical concern with computer-related research and teaching.\nWinners\nRecipients include:\n*2009: Edward N.
