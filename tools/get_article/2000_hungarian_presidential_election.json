Former Minister Ferenc Mádl was elected with an absolute majority.\nBackground\nThe term for the post of president in Hungary is 5 years. After the 2 consecutive terms of the previous office holder, Árpád Göncz, the succession was somewhat problematic. Though the coalition partner in the first cabinet of Viktor Orbán had its own candidate, party chairman József Torgyán, the leading party wanted another person. In the end Torgyán withdrew from the process.\nThe voting process\nThe only candidate was legal scholar and Former Minister of Education Ferenc Mádl, who was nominated formally by FKGP, but with the support of governing Fidesz and MDF parties. The opposition parties did not nominate any candidates. In the first two rounds, two-thirds majority requirement needed to elect the president, while in the third round an absolute majority is enough, according to the Constitution.\nAfter three rounds, Mádl was elected President of Hungary, taking the office on 4 August in that year.\nFirst and second rounds\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hungarian Presidential elections, 2000 (first round, 5 June 2000)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Candidate\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Nominating Party\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Votes\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | %\n|-\n| In favor of Ferenc Mádl\n| Independent (Fidesz–FKGP–MDF)\n| 251\n| 65.03\n|-\n| Against Mádl\n| –\n| 105\n| 27.2\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Did not vote\n| 23\n| 5.96\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Invalid votes\n| 7\n| 1.81\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total votes\n! 363\n! 94.04\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total seats\n! 386\n! 100.00\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hungarian Presidential elections, 2000 (second round, 6 June 2000)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Candidate\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Nominating Party\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Votes\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | %\n|-\n| In favor of Ferenc Mádl\n| Independent (Fidesz–FKGP–MDF)\n| 238\n| 61.66\n|-\n| Against Mádl\n| –\n| 103\n| 26.68\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Did not vote\n| 31\n| 8.03\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Invalid votes\n| 14\n| 3.63\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total votes\n! 355\n! 91.97\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total seats\n! 386\n! 100.00\n|}\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hungarian Presidential elections, 2000 (third round, 6 June 2000)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Candidate\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Nominating Party\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Votes\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | %\n|-\n| In favor of Ferenc Mádl\n| Independent (Fidesz–FKGP–MDF)\n| 243\n| 62.95\n|-\n| Against Mádl\n| –\n| 96\n| 24.87\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Did not vote\n| 35\n| 9.07\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Invalid votes\n| 12\n| 3.11\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total votes\n! 351\n! 90.93\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total seats\n! 386\n! 100.00\n|}\nReferences"
