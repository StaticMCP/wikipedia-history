The awards ceremony is intended to recognize excellence in productions made by Ibero-American artists and includes categories for music releases as well as for feature films and television/streaming series.\nThe inaugural edition of the awards is set to take place on October 26, 2023, at The Fillmore in Miami Beach, United States.\nBackground\nAmerican popular culture magazine Rolling Stone has released various international versions over the years. Among them, versions for Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Spain have been released, all in Spanish. In 2023, it was announced that an awards ceremony would be presented later in the year, intended to \"highlight creations that have outstanding cultural impact, innovation, originality, boldness, quality, and a significant contribution to the industry\". Similar initiatives have been made for the British and Australian versions of the magazine, with the latter, the Rolling Stone Australia Awards, being handled since 2010.\nCategories\nCeremonies\n* 2023\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://premiosrsee.com/ Official website]"
