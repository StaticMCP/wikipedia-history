His daughter Mary Ann Croft assisted him. In 1902 after her father died Mary Ann Croft was officially appointed the lighthouse keeper, when she became the first female lighthouse keeper in Canada. In 1932 Croft retired, and moved to Victoria with a pension of $43 a month. She had spent a total of 46 years living on the island. In 1996 the lighthouse was automated after having been manned for 110 years. On September 3, 2004, the foghorn at the lighthouse was deactivated and removed from the station. Today nobody lives on the island and the lighthouse buildings are deteriorating.\nSee also\n* List of lighthouses in British Columbia\n* List of lighthouses in Canada\n*Discovery Island (British Columbia)\n*Discovery Island Marine Provincial Park\n*Captain E.G.
