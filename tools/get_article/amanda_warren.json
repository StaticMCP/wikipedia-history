She is known for her role as Lucy Warburton on the HBO drama series The Leftovers\nand as Betty on the Apple TV+ comedy series Dickinson.\nEarly life\nAmanda Warren was born on July 17, 1982, in New York City. She studied singing at Professional Performing Arts School in New York.\nCareer\nIn the late 2000s, Warren began appearing in small roles in several American television series and films. In 2010, she appeared in several guest-starring television roles, including Rubicon, Gossip Girl, The Good Wife, and Law & Order.\nIn 2014, Warren portrayed Lucy Warburton on HBO's drama television series The Leftovers. Her film credits include The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Seven Psychopaths (2012), All Is Bright (2013), Deep Powder (2013), Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), and Mother! (2017).\nWarren signed on for an CBS political drama pilot titled Ways & Means in February 2020. The pilot, written by Mike Murphy and Ed Redlich, depicts a powerful congressional leader who has lost faith in politics, with Warren as the former community organizer and progressive activist Jerlene Brooks. In May 2021, CBS passed on the pilot.\nIn 2021, Warren was cast as Camille De Haan, mother of titular character Monet De Haan, in the 2021 reboot of Gossip Girl. She also starred in CBS' NCIS: New Orleans as Mayor Zahra Taylor.\nIn 2022, Warren was cast as the lead in the CBS cop drama East New York. She plays Regina Haywood: the newly promoted deputy inspector of the East New York neighborhood in East Brooklyn. The show was picked up for series and set for a fall debut during the 2022-23 United States network television schedule. Despite fan support it was cancelled after one season in May 2023  to give S.W.A.T a thirteen episode final season; as CBS demanded immediate streaming rights from production company WB Studios.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
