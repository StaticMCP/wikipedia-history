The Dacian king Decebalus benefited from this, and made out a plan along with the neighboring allied tribes of the Roxolans and Bastarnae, to attack south of the Danube, in the Roman province of Moesia, in an attempt to force the Romans to leave their positions in the mountains near Sarmizegetusa.\nBattle\nThe Dacian army, together with the Roxolani and the Bastarnae, crossed the frozen Danube but, because the weather was not cold enough, the ice broke under their weight, causing many to die in the frozen water.\nTrajan moved his army from the mountains, following the Dacians into Moesia. A first battle was fought at night somewhere near the town of Nicopolis, a battle with few casualties on either side and with no crucial result. However, as the Romans received reinforcements, they were able to corner the Dacio-Sarmatian army.\nThe decisive battle was fought at Adamclisi, a difficult battle for both the Dacians and the Romans. Even though the outcome of the battle was a decisive Roman victory, both sides suffered very heavy casualties.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Trajan advanced to Sarmizegetusa, Decebalus requesting a truce. Trajan agreed to the peace offerings. This time the peace was favorable to the Roman Empire: Decebalus must yield the territories occupied by the Roman army, and he must give back to the Romans all the weapons and war machines received after 89, when the Romans under Domitian were forced to pay an annual gift to the Dacians.\nDecebalus was obliged to reconsider his foreign policies, and “to have friends and enemies the friends and enemies of the Roman Empire”, as described by Dio Cassius.\nAfter the conquest of Dacia following the 105–106 war, Trajan built the Tropaeum Traiani at Adamclisi in 109, in memory of the battle. On the Tropaeum Traiani monument was a frieze comprising 54 metopes.\nSee also\n* Dacian warfare\n* Capidava\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dacica.ro/ Biblioteca Dacica]\n* [http://www.enciclopedia-dacica.ro/ Enciclopedia Dacica]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071015041222/http://cjc.ro/engleza/adamen~1.htm]\n* La colonne d'Adamclisi ou le trophée de Trajan  [https://web.archive.org/web/20130819185528/http://adamclisi.leg8.com/ La colonne d'Adamclisi en photos]"
