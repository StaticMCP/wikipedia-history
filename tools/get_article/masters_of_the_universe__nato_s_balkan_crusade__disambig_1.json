NATO's Balkan Crusade' is a 2000 anthology of texts critical of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, edited by Tariq Ali.\nSummary\nThe texts in ''Masters of the Universe? NATO's Balkan Crusade'' question the legitimacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War and criticise the people who promoted it as a humanitarian intervention, such as Tony Blair and Jürgen Habermas.\nThe book contains an introduction with the title \"After the War\" by the editor Tariq Ali and the following texts:\nPart I.

Lutz\nPart V. The Last Word\n* \"'Traitors' of All Balkan Lands: Unite!\" by Gazi Kaplan\nReception\nVictoria Brittain of The Guardian says the book \"will make numerous powerful men in western chancelleries exceedingly cross\", as its authors \"take on just about everyone involved in the promotion of NATO's first war\". In Medicine, Conflict and Survival, Rae Street calls the book \"deeply engaging\" and \"a treasure-trove of arguments and information\", praising its authors' \"stimulating writing\" and willingness to ignore appeals from politicians and journalists to \"the values of the western world\". Carl G. Jacobsen describes the book in Global Dialogue as \"a powerful, compelling antidote\" to apologias for NATO's intervention and the hegemony of the United States over Europe. Gregory Elich writes in Science & Society that the book contains little analysis of the war itself, but works as background reading about the lead-up to the war, American domination of Western Europe and NATO's decision to expand into Eastern Europe.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/1684-masters-of-the-universe Official website]"
