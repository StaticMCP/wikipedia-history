Many of these games were played during local cultural festivals, but are now disappearing because of technological influence and globalisation.\nHistory\nDandi biyo and kabaddi, which were considered the unofficial national sports until recently, are still popular in rural areas. Despite efforts, standardisation and development of dandi biyo has not been achieved, while kabaddi, as a professional sport, is still in its infancy in Nepal. Bagh-chal, an ancient board game that is thought to have originated in Nepal, can be played on chalk-drawn boards, with pebbles, and is still popular today. Ludo, snakes and ladders and carrom are popular pastimes. Chess is also played. Volleyball was declared as the national sport of Nepal in 2017. Popular children's games include versions of tag, knucklebones, hopscotch, Duck, duck, goose and lagori, while marbles, top, hoop rolling and gully cricket are also popular among boys. Rubber bands, or ranger bands cut from tubes in bike tyres, make a multi-purpose sporting equipment for Nepali children, which may be bunched or chained together, and used to play dodgeball, cat's cradle, jianzi and a variety of skipping rope games.\nTraditional games\nDandi biyo\nGuccha\nThis game (also known as marbles) involves participants flicking marbles with their fingers in the hopes of pushing opponents' marbles outside of the playing area.\nBhurung\nIn Nepal, the spinning top is known as a bhurung or lattu.\nDhyakki\nDhyakki (or piya) is a form of hopscotch in which players must move a rock across the playing area as they hop through it.\nBall games\nChungi\nSeven stones\nThough this game goes by other names in neighboring countries, it is primarily known in Nepal as seven stones.\nVariations of tag\nKabaddi\nKabaddi (also known locally as kapardi) has been declining in Nepal in recent decades.\nKho kho\nThe Nepal Kho Kho Association was established the late 1990s, and the sport is contested at the country's National Games.
