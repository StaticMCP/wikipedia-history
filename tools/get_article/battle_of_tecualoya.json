The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. The Mexican insurgents were commanded by General Hermenegildo Galeana and the Spanish by Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta. The battle resulted in a humiliating defeat for Galeana and his army. The Mexican insurgents lost all their artillery, though they would later recover these field pieces at the Battle of Tenancingo where General José María Oviedo would be killed in action.\nSee also\n* Mexican War of Independence\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
