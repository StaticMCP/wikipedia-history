Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nInstead of using the polls to crown a national champion, 1973 was the first year for the Division II and III playoffs. The final UPI poll was released before the playoffs, and the final AP poll was released after the playoffs.\nThe 1973 Tennessee State Tigers football team (10–0) was rated No. 1 by both the AP and UPI. Louisiana Tech (12–1) was ranked No. 2 by the AP and No. 3 by the UPI and then defeated Western Kentucky in the NCAA Division II championship game. Wittenberg (12–0) was ranked No. 4 by the AP and No. 5 by the UPI and went on to defeat  in the NCAA Division III championship game/Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid
