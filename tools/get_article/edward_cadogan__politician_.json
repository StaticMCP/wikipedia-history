He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford before training as a barrister.\nFrom 1911 to 1921, he was Secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, James Lowther and also fought in World War I as a Major in the Suffolk Yeomanry. Lowther retired in 1921 and Cadogan was awarded the CB that year. A year later, he entered the Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Reading in 1922. He subsequently represented the seats of Finchley and Bolton and was a member of the Indian Statutory Commission from 1927 to 1930.\nCadogan was interested in penal reform, and particularly in the problems of young offenders.  He chaired a committee which unanimously recommended abolishing the sentence of whipping (except in prisons), a provision adopted by Home Secretary James Chuter Ede in the Criminal Justice Act 1948.  He was knighted in 1939 and fought with the RAF during World War II. He died unmarried and childless in 1962.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
