He took five wickets, including shattering Rohit Sharma's stumps with an inswinger. He also took the wicket of Ravindra Jadeja. Both of these players have played for the senior national side in the One Day Internationals. His five wickets for 35 runs, and 17 runs with the bat in a low-scoring match, won him the Man of the Match award.\nInternational career\nAnwar Ali made his T20 debut for Pakistan on 12 October 2008, against Zimbabwe. He bowled 2 overs and went for 19 runs without taking a wicket. Anwar made his comeback against Zimbabwe as well, where he took 2 wickets in both matches. Pakistan won the series 2–0. After good form against Zimbabwe and in domestic matches, he got an ODI cap and scored 43 not out; he also took 2–26 in 6 overs. Together he and Bilawal Bhatti defeated South Africa. He also made a fine 41 not out in an ODI against Sri Lanka and took a wicket in the match. Only in his first One Day International, Anwar Ali promised to be a good player as he was able to win the Man Of The Match award.\nDuring the second match of the T20I series against Sri Lanka on 2015 August in Colombo, Ali smashed a match-winning knock of unbeaten 46 runs, where Pakistan won a game when they were nowhere near a winning margin. Sri Lanka batted first and scored 172 runs in 20 overs. The score showed a win for the Sri Lankans, due to difficulty to bat in the second innings in their home soil of Colombo. Pakistan came on to bat and with first five wickets gone for just 40 runs on the board. For the sixth wicket, skipper Shahid Afridi smashed a quick 45 runs off 22 balls and the match turned again to the Pakistanis. After Afridi's wicket, the Lankans were back in the game, when Ali came in to the crease. He showed immense talent and was hard-hitting against the Sri Lankan pace attack and scored a blistering 46 runs off 17 balls with 3 fours and 4 huge sixes. Ali got out in the score of 165 runs and finally Pakistan won comfortably with 1 wicket. This is Pakistan's first T20I win in a narrow margin of wickets. Ali was named the man of the match award and Pakistan won the series 2–0.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9IpwbuJeT-0WYGxecOl5g Youtube Official Channel]\n*[http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/player/232491.html Cricinfo: Anwar Ali]"
