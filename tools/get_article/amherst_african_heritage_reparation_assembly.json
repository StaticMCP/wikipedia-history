In 2021, the Amherst Town Council approved the creation of a reparations fund. A year later, the council voted to finance the fund through deposits from the city's certified tax cannabis revenue for the previous year. In June 2022, the City Council approved $2,000,000 of initial funding for reparations.\nIt was made up of six Black residents and one representative from the NGO Reparations for Amherst with the final Assembly consisting of; Heather Lord, Yvonne Mendez, Michele Miller, Alexis Reed, Irvin Rhodes, Amilcar Shabazz, and Debora Bridges.\nThe group was advised by Robin Rue Simmons, the architect of the Evanston Reparations Committee.\nSee also\n*Evanston Reparations Committee\n*California Reparations Task Force\nExternal links\n*[https://www.amherstma.gov/3625/African-Heritage-Reparation-Assembly Official link]\nReferences"
