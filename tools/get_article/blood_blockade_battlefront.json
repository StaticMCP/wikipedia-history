Brigid Alverson from MTV Geek criticized the artwork for being hard to follow and stated \"it boils down to a matter of taste. Blood Blockade Battleground is a good choice for readers who like a lot of action and don't mind being dropped into the middle of the story, without a lot of setup.\" On the other hand, The Fandom Post's John Rose praised the artwork more specifically the monsters' designs. He highly recommended it to Triguns readers as well as superhero comic reader, sci-fi hero and Futurama fans.

Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network praised the cast and studio Bones' work. Additionally, he liked the consistency in quality and commented \"The contiguous threads laced through these episodic adventures are beginning to converge fast, and while I can't see the full picture yet, I know Rie Matsumoto is building the anime-original material of Leo's romance into something special. The animation continues to be jaw-dropping. The music continues to be soul-warming. There's never enough time in one writeup to talk about everything that makes the episode so damn good. Blood Blockade Battlefront continues to be The Very Best.\" Jarius Taylor from the Fandom Post called it \"both ridiculously cool and ridiculously weird\" and praised the cast like Chapman. In a later review he said \"It’s still not entirely clear what this show is going for yet but for now it’s a good ride and I have more than enough faith in the people behind it to believe the destination will be worthwhile.\" Rachael Verret, a writer from The Mary Sue, gave the series a perfect score having pointed out its \"energy and joviality\" seen through the cast and the ending sequences which reminded her of another series, Baccano!.
