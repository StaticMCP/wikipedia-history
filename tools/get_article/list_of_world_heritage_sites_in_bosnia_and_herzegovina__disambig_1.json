Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Bosnia and Herzegovina inherited the former country of Yugoslavia's accession to the convention on 12 July 1993 as one of the successor states.\nThere are five sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the list and a further nine on the tentative list. The first site, the Old Bridge Area of the Old City of Mostar, was inscribed to the list at the 29th UNESCO session in 2005. The Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge in Višegrad was inscribed to the list in 2007. This was followed by the inscription of the Stećci Medieval Tombstones Graveyards in 2016. The latter is a transnational site, shared with Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro. Out of 28 listed Stećci sites, 20 are located in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the most prominent one in Radimlja. The most recent site added to the list was the Vjetrenica Cave. The Janj forest, part of the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe, and Vjetrenica Cave are natural sites, while the other three sites are cultural.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (municipality)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old Bridge Area of the Old City of Mostar\n|\n| Mostar\n| align=center | 2005\n| 946; vi (cultural)\n| This site encompasses the Old Bridge and the surrounding area.
