Hazel Ascot, on whom the film largely depends, can dance neatly enough, but her singing and acting are stilted and self-conscious. Jack Barty gives life to the film as her father and there is a pleasant glimpse of Dave Burnaby as Mr. Shirley. The audition scenes might well have been omitted and the final show might have been shortened.\"\nKine Weekly wrote: \"The sentiment is honest, the parade of turns most of which are new, is handled with real showmanship, while the small star, Hazel Ascot, is refused any attempt at precocity. To use an American colloquialism, the film has \"got something,\" and that something, represented by the warmth and variety of the entertainment, is closely allied to the box-office. The show is British to the core.\"\nPicture Show wrote: \"Quite entertaining variety show.\"\nPicturegoer wrote: \"The main point about this picture is the screen debut of a new juvenile find, Hazel Ascot, who promises to do exceedingly well.&nbsp;... Most of the appeal of the film relies on the \"turns,\" which include some exceedingly good ones. The plot is very slight, but the artistes concerned make the most of it.\"\nIn British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959 David Quinlan rated the film as \"mediocre\", writing: \"Moderate musical.\"\nHome media\nTalking Feet was released on DVD by Renown Pictures on 11 Jun 2012.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
