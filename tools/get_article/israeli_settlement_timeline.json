The report exposes the existence of at least 150 such illegal outposts that lack proper government authorization.\n* The Israeli government confirms plans to increase the size of the Maale Adumim settlement, in the West Bank near Jerusalem, by 3,500 homes. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat criticizes the move, saying \"[This] sabotages all efforts seeking to get the peace process back on track,\" and \"The Israeli government wants to determine Jerusalem's fate by presenting the settlements and wall as a fait accompli.\".\nAugust\n* All 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the northern West Bank (or northern Samaria) are forcibly evacuated as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan.\n2006\n* Settler population.

The move is condemned by the United States and the European Union.\n2008\n* West Bank settler population: 290,697.\nMarch\n* The Jerusalem municipality announces plans to build 600 new housing units in East Jerusalem. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice states in response that settlement expansion should stop and was inconsistent with 'road map' obligations.\nNovember\n* The Israeli Supreme Court gives the Israeli government 45 days to explain why it hasn't taken down the illegal outpost of Migron in accord with its commitments to the 2003 Road map for peace plan.\nDecember\n* The Gaza War begins.\n2009\nJanuary\n* The Gaza War concludes.\nJune\n* US President Barack Obama makes his famous Cairo speech in which he says \"The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements\".\n* Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak authorizes the construction of 300 new homes in West Bank settlements.\nAugust\n* US President Barack Obama demands a complete freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The Israeli government agrees to a freeze in the West Bank. Peace Now argues that Israel is attempting to fool the United States.  On 25 August 2009 Netanyahu says that he will attempt to gain an agreement with the U.S. to continue building settlements before attempting to talk with the Palestinians. On 28 August 2009 US officials said they would not impose conditions on the parties, but that it would be up to the parties themselves to determine if the threshold for talks had been met.   Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar defended the freeze as an attempt to \"protect the vital interests - Jerusalem and the relationship with the United States - and to avoid national isolation, because we won't be able to do the things close to our hearts while under international isolation.\"\nSeptember\n* Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal called Israel's proposal to temporarily halt settlement construction in exchange for improved relations with Arab countries \"Dangerous\", as he viewed it as an attempt to avoid US demands. The Hamas leader's opposition to the Israeli proposal was supported by Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa.\nNovember\n* The United States government voices their dismay at the approved by the Israel's interior ministry of 900 additional housing units at a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. A White House spokesman says the move makes it \"more difficult\" to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Settlements on occupied territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this and consider Gilo, the planned settlement area \"an integral part of Jerusalem\".\nDecember\n* The Israeli government orders a 10-month lull in permits for new settlement homes in the West Bank. The restrictions, which Israeli politicians and media have referred to as a \"freeze\", do not apply to East Jerusalem (whose de facto annexation by Israel is not recognised internationally), municipal buildings, schools, synagogues and other community infrastructure in the settlements. About 3,000 homes already under construction will be allowed to proceed. The Israeli government said the move was aimed at restarting peace talks, but Palestinian officials said it was insufficient. Palestinian officials have refused to rejoin peace talks until a total building halt is imposed, including in East Jerusalem. The announcement followed calls by the US government for a total freeze in settlement building. The US government, the European Union, Russia and the UN have criticized Israel's plans to continue building in East Jerusalem but both the US and the EU have stated that there should be no preconditions for resuming the suspended peace talks related to Israel's Road Map requirement to freeze settlements. although Palestinian participants would have to give prior acceptance of Israel's claim to statehood and refrain from violence.\n2010\nMarch\n* Israel announces plans to construct 1600 settler homes in the Ramat Shlomo settlement in East Jerusalem during United States Vice President Joe Biden's visit to the region. Biden condemns the decision saying \"The substance and timing of the announcement, particularly with the launching of proximity talks, is precisely the kind of step that undermines the trust we need . . . and runs counter to the constructive discussions I've had in Israel.\"\n* United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated \"The world has condemned Israel's expansion plans in East Jerusalem. Let us be clear: all settlement activity is illegal anywhere in occupied territory, and this must stop.\" He spoke both for the United Nations and the Middle East Quartet.\n* The mayor of Jerusalem unveiled a plan to demolish 22 Israeli Arab homes in East Jerusalem to make way for a public park and tourist site.\n2011\nFebruary\n*The U.S. vetoes a draft resolution to condemn all Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory as illegal.\n2017\nAs of January 1, 2017 the West Bank settlement population was 420,899.\n2020\nIn 2020 the settler population in East Jerusalem was around 220,000.\n2021\nIn 2021 the settler population in the Golan Heights was almost 27,000\n2022\nAs of January 30, 2022 the West Bank settlement population was 490,493.\nThe Israeli government’s Coalition Agreement of December 1, 2022 between incoming prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and the far-right, ultra-nationalist Religious Zionism party of Bezalel Smotrich states that \"the prime minister will work towards the formulation and promotion of a policy whereby sovereignty is applied to Judea and Samaria\" (biblical names for the occupied West Bank). Smotrich would take up a new post of minister within the defense ministry, where he would oversee civil matters in the West Bank. Other commitments included legalization of dozens of unauthorized settlements and the provision of large funds for road building and public transport in the West Bank. To the concern of the US administration, Netanyahu made agreements with coalition partners to expand Israeli settlements and legalize dozens of Israeli outposts.\n2023\nJanuary\nThe new Israeli government told the Israeli High Court that the state would reverse its previous position that Israeli settlers leave Homesh, a yeshiva built on private Palestinian property, and that the government intends to change the Disengagement Law. The Palestinian landowners appealed to the court because they have been prevented from reaching their property due to settlers in the Israeli outpost blocking access. The State Attorney's Office said \"the political echelon wishes to announce that, in accordance with the coalition agreements that were signed, it intends to act as soon as possible to amend the guidelines permitting Israelis to remain\" and requested a further three months to submit another opinion.\nIn response to the decision to grant the government 90 days to explain its decision to reverse course on Homesh, the US said that \"The Homesh outpost in the West Bank is illegal. It is illegal even under Israeli Law. Our call to refrain from unilateral steps certainly includes any decision to create a new settlement, to legalize outposts or allowing building of any kind deep in the West Bank, adjacent to Palestinian communities or on private Palestinian land.\"\nFebruary\nIsrael approved the legalization of nine illegal settler outposts. A US spokesman said \"We strongly oppose expansion of settlements, and we're deeply concerned by reports about a process to legalize outposts that are illegal under Israeli law. We are seeking more information from the Israeli government on what has actually been decided.\" The Palestinian Authority condemned the decision as crossing \"all red lines\".\nAt a UNSC meeting of 20 February, the Council issued a formal statement condemning Israel's plan for settlement expansion on Palestinian territory. It was the first action the United States has permitted against Israel in six years. The statement said \"The Security Council reiterates that continuing Israeli settlement activities are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two-State solution based on the 1967 lines\" and \"The Security Council expresses deep concern and dismay with Israel's announcement on February 12.\" The UAE did not push a draft resolution to a vote \"given the positive talks between the parties.\"  Netanyahu's office condemned the formal statement saying \"The statement should not have been made and the United States should not have joined it.\"\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian issues in the West Bank. Israeli peace groups condemned the move as de jure annexation of occupied territories. Rights lawyer Michael Sfard tweeted that the action \"entails de jure annexation of the West Bank\".\nDaniel Kurtzer, former US ambassador to Israel, accused the government of breaking a written agreement with Washington by legalising a \"group of hardline nationalist and religious settlements\" and called on the Biden administration to prevent Israel's \"creeping annexation\" of the West Bank.\nMarch\nIsrael repealed a 2005 law whereby four Israeli settlements, Homesh, Sa-Nur, Ganim and Kadim, were dismantled as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. The move was condemned by the PA and the EU, the latter calling for the revocation of the new law. Critics, including some of the Israeli opposition and NGOs supporting Palestinian rights, denounced the move as a prelude to annexation of the West Bank. The US, in addition to denouncing the move, also summoned the Israeli ambassador to express concern.\nMay\nWith Israeli government approval, Israeli settlers relocated a yeshiva established on private Palestinian land in Homesh, to a nearby spot designated state-owned land. The relocation was carried out despite international opposition, including repeatedly from the U.S., and the opposition of the Israeli attorney general.\nJune\nIsrael shortened the procedure of approving settlement construction and gave Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich the authority to approve one of the stages, changing the system operating for the last 27 years. The United States said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the Israeli plans that explicitly violate previous commitments made by Israel to the Biden administration. \"The United States is deeply troubled by the Israeli government’s reported decision to advance planning for over 4,000 settlement units in the West Bank. We are similarly concerned by reports of changes to Israel’s system of settlement administration that expedite the planning and approvals of settlements\". Tor Wennesland, United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process urged a halt and reversal of the decisions and said \"I am deeply concerned by the Israeli Government’s decision yesterday to alter settlement planning procedures that have been in place since 1996, which is expected to expedite settlement expansion. I am also alarmed by the anticipated advancement next week of over 4,000 settlement housing units by Israeli planning authorities\". The Israeli press reported that the US has informed Israel that the Negev forum on regional cooperation will be postponed as a result of the Israeli moves.\nThe US criticized Israel's advancement of plans for 5,700 new homes in Jewish settlements and said it was \"an obstacle to peace\".\nJuly\nIn its first six months, construction of 13,000 housing units in settlements, almost triple the amount advanced in the whole of 2022.\nIn a CNN interview on 9 July 2023, US President Joe Biden said that extreme cabinet ministers in the coalition that back settling \"anywhere they want\" in the West Bank are \"part of the problem\" in the conflict.\nDecember\nOn December 4, the Lower Aqueduct plan for 1792 housing units was approved in an expedited process, marking the first major new East Jerusalem settlement plan in East Jerusalem since Givat HaMatos in 2012.\n2024\nFebruary\nAfter Palestinian gunmen killed one Israeli and injured five Israelis near Ma'ale Adumim, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich in February 2024 announced a \"settlement response\" after speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as \"any harm to us will lead to more construction and more development and more of our hold all over the country\", with 2,350 more homes in Ma'ale Adumim and 300 more homes in Kedar being arranged for approval, as well as 700 more homes in Efrat slated to be built. American Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the announcement, stating that new Israeli settlements are \"inconsistent with international law\" and \"counter-productive to reaching an enduring peace\", risking \"Israel’s security\".\nMarch\nIsrael's government in early March 2024 fully approved 694 more settler homes for Efrat, and additionally progressed the approval of 2,452 more settler homes in Ma'ale Adumim and 330 more settler homes in Kedar, reported Haaretz.\nIn late March 2024, Minister Smotrich declared that the Israeli government had newly seized 10&nbsp;km2 of land in the West Bank, \"promoting settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country\". Some of the seized land were in the Jordan Valley, and some were between the Israeli settlements Ma'ale Adumim and Kedar. Settlement watchdog group Peace Now claimed that this land seizure was the largest by the Israeli government since the Oslo Accords of 1993. The European Union confirmed that in the past year Israel had advanced the most West Bank settlements in decades.\n2025\nMay\nOn 29 May it was announced that Israeli ministers had approved 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, with several already existing as outposts that did not have government authorisation but would be made legal under Israeli law. Defence Minister Israel Katz described the move as preventative against establishment of a Palestinian state and a security measure.\nIn August 2025, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, one of the highest-ranking American officials ever to visit an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, traveled to Shilo and Ariel, where he delivered a speech at a celebratory event attended by Ariel Mayor Yair Chetboun and other West Bank settlement leaders. During his remarks, Johnson declared that the \"mountains of Judea and Samaria\" belong to the Jewish people \"by right.\"\nNotes"
