Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. As of 2025, Tajikistan has five sites on the list.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Proto-urban site of Sarazm\n|\n| Sughd Region\n| 1141; ii, iii (cultural)\n| align=\"center\" | 2010\n|Sarazm, which means \"where the land begins\", is an archaeological site bearing testimony to the development of human settlements in Central Asia, from the 4th millennium BCE to the end of the 3rd millennium BCE. The ruins demonstrate the early development of proto-urbanization in this region. This centre of settlement, one of the oldest in Central Asia, is situated between a mountainous region suitable for cattle rearing by nomadic pastoralists, and a large valley conducive to the development of agriculture and irrigation by the first settled populations in the region. Sarazm also demonstrates the existence of commercial and cultural exchanges and trade relations with peoples over an extensive geographical area, extending from the steppes of Central Asia and Turkmenistan, to the Iranian plateau, the Indus valley and as far as the Indian Ocean.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tajik National Park (Mountains of the Pamirs)\n|\n| Districts under Central Government Jurisdiction and Gorno-Badakhshan\n| 1252; vii, viii (natural)\n| align=\"center\" | 2013\n|Tajikistan National Park covers more than 2.5 million hectares in the east of the country, at the centre of the so-called \"Pamir Knot\", a meeting point of the highest mountain ranges on the Eurasian continent. It consists of high plateaux in the east and, to the west, rugged peaks, some of them over 7,000 meters high, and features extreme seasonal variations of temperature. The longest valley glacier outside the Polar region is located among the 1,085 glaciers inventoried in the site, which also numbers 170 rivers and more than 400 lakes. Rich flora species of both the south-western and central Asian floristic regions grow in the Park which shelters nationally rare and threatened birds and mammals (Marco Polo Argali sheep, Snow Leopards and Siberian Ibex and more). Subject to frequent strong earthquakes, the Park is sparsely inhabited, and virtually unaffected by agriculture and permanent human settlements. It offers a unique opportunity for the study of plate tectonics and subduction phenomena.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\" |Silk Roads: Zarafshan-Karakum Corridor\n|\n| Districts under Central Government Jurisdiction and Sughd Region\n| 1675; ii, iii, v (cultural)\n| 2023\n|The Zarafshan-Karakum Corridor is a key section of the Silk Roads in Central Asia that connects other corridors from all directions. Located in rugged mountains, fertile river valleys, and uninhabitable desert, the 866-kilometre corridor runs from east to west along the Zarafshan River and further southwest following the ancient caravan roads crossing the Karakum Desert to the Merv Oasis. Channelling much of the east-west exchange along the Silk Roads from the 2nd century BCE to the 16th century CE, a large quantity of goods was traded along the corridor. People travelled, settled, conquered, or were defeated here, making it a melting pot of ethnicities, cultures, religions, sciences, and technologies. Ancient Panjakent is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Tugay forests of the Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve\n|\n|Khatlon Region\n|1685; ix (natural)\n|2023\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Cultural Heritage Sites of Ancient Khuttal\n|\n|Khatlon Region\n|1627; ii, iii (cultural)\n|2025\n|\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Tajikistan has listed sixteen properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Mausoleum of \"Amir Khamza Khasti Podshoh\"\n|\n| Sughd Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|The Site of Ancient Town of Takhti-Sangin\n|\n| Khatlon Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Zorkul State Reserve\n|\n| Gorno-Badakhshan\n|1999\n| vii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|State reserve Dashti Djum\n|\n| Khatlon Region\n|1999\n| vii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Zakaznik Kusavlisay\n|\n| Sughd Region\n|1999\n| vii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Fann Mountains\n|\n| Sughd Region\n|1999\n| vii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|The Site of Ancient Town of Shahristan (Kahkakha)\n|\n| Sughd Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Mausoleum of \"Mukhammad Bashoro\"\n|\n| Sughd Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|The Site of Ancient Town of Pyanjekent\n|\n| Sughd Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Mausoleum of \"Hodja Nashron\"\n|\n| Districts under Central Government Jurisdiction\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Buddhistic cloister of Ajina-Tepa\n|\n| Khatlon Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Mausoleum of \"Khoja Mashkhad\"\n|\n| Khatlon Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|The Site of Ancient Town of Baitudasht IV\n|\n| Khatlon Region\n|1999\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Silk Roads Sites in Tajikistan\n|\n| Districts under Central Government Jurisdiction, Gorno-Badakhshan,  Khatlon Region, and Sughd Region\n| 2013\n| iii, iv, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Silk Roads: Fergana-Syrdarya Corridor\n|\n| Sughd Region\n| 2023\n| ii, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Ancient City of Karon\n|\n| Gorno-Badakhshan\n| 2025\n| ii, iv, v (cultural)\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*Tourism in Tajikistan\n*List of World Heritage Sites in Northern and Central Asia\nReferences"
