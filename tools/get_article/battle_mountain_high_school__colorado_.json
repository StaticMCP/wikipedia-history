(BMHS)\nThe school was originally built in 1975 in the town of Eagle-Vail. Prior to that, it was a combined middle school/high school near Battle Mountain Pass, close to the town of Minturn. In 2010, it was relocated to a new campus further west in the town of Edwards. It continues to serve as one of Eagle County's primary high schools today. The new facility was designed by H+L Architecture of Denver.\nReferences\nNotable people\n*Porter Middaugh ran XC for BMHS and in 2023 September 22, he clocked a record-breaking time at Lincoln Park in Colorado, achieving 14:38 in a 5K.\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.eagleschools.net/ Eagle County Schools]"
