Crimson's singular union of power, passion and intellect never flags despite the comings, goings and severe turns in direction ... made by entirely different lineups, both albums nevertheless epitomize Crimson's — and Fripp's — dedication to searing, transportive excellence ... the concert tapes affirm that with a blowtorch vengeance\".\nAuthor Greg Kot opined that \"guitarist Robert Fripp's bitter liner notes get things off to a sour start, but the violence and invention in the music more than compensate\". John Kelman from All About Jazz wondered \"if Fripp can continue to reissue material ad infinitum ... but this new release is, indeed, a concise collection that almost perfectly represents Crimson's long and multifaceted career\".\nBarry Cleveland of Guitar Player said that the \"CD box set provides the perfect introduction to one of rock's most influential bands ... the majority of the studio tracks are culled from the band's stunning 1969 debut ... the selections from the band's first seven studio albums are well-chosen, and the song sequencing makes for an enjoyable listen, but it's the live material that provides the greatest insight into what this group—or groups, as there are actually several different incarnations represented—was all about\". He also noted the box set includes \"a 24-page booklet containing a list of all the band's gigs, a diary-like running commentary by guitarist Robert Fripp, and a bevy of cool photos and other graphic memorabilia\".\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
