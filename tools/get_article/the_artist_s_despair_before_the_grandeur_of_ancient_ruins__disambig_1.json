It depicts an artist's response to ruins, namely those of the Colossus of Constantine at the Capitoline Museums in Rome. The work was acquired by the Kunsthaus Zürich in 1940.\nThe artist's despair may be caused by \"the impossibility of emulating the greatness of the past\", by the knowledge that all things must decay, or by a sense of unfulfilled longing and dislocation. Distortions of perspective and the \"plunge into the abyss\" along the right edge conjure up a sense of nightmare. SPQR may be read in the inscription on the base of the foot, while vegetation sprouts up near the hand; the artist, in a \"fit of melancholy\", is dwarfed by the fragments of the past.\nArt historian Linda Nochlin saw the artist portrayed in the drawing as \"not merely 'overwhelmed' but ... in mourning, mourning a terrible loss ... ten years before the outbreak of the French Revolution.... Out of this loss is constructed the Modern itself\".\nSee also\n* Classicism\n* Romanticism\n* Roman sculpture\n* The Anxiety of Influence\nReferences"
