It is based on the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back and is the sequel to Super Star Wars. The game was followed by a sequel, Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi in 1994. Unlike its predecessor, Nintendo was not involved in its publishing. The game was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on August 24, 2009 and in the PAL regions on October 2, 2009, alongside the other games in the Super Star Wars series.\nGameplay\nSuper Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows closely the standard set by its predecessor, with multiple playable characters and Mode 7 quasi-3D vehicle sequences. The controls are very similar to the first game, but feature a double-jump. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca return as playable characters although the character-select option was removed.\nUnlike the original game, this installment allows each character the use of a primary and secondary weapon. Following one of the swamp planet Dagobah missions, Luke Skywalker can also collect Force Powers for use in later levels. Luke can now block incoming attacks using his lightsaber, allowing him to deflect blaster fire. Han Solo can now throw grenades and Chewbacca has a new power up: a spinning attack. Sith Lord Darth Vader appears as the final boss in the video game.\nDevelopment\nAn \"asteroid chase\" stage using Mode 7 effects was cut from the game due to lack of cartridge space. In late 1992 a contest was launched exclusively in Electronic Gaming Monthly, which required the contestants to answer six multi-choice questions, and for which the \"Grand Prize\" was to have the person's likeness appear in this forthcoming game. The winner was Jeff Crosno, for whom the developers placed his appearance on a Rebel soldier in an Ice Fields of Hoth cut-scene, replacing the already existing facial graphics.\nRelease\nIn 1996, THQ announced that they would re-release Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi in February 1997 in order to coincide with the \"Special Edition\" of those films appearing in theaters. The re-release is identical to the original version.\n| Allgame =\n| rev1 = Super Gamer\n| rev1Score = 85%\n| EGM = 28/40\n| rev2 = Power Unlimited\n| rev2Score = 92%\n}}\nIn the United Kingdom, Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back was the top-selling SNES game in February 1994.\nThe game was met with positive reviews.

Electronic Gaming Monthly gave The Empire Strikes Back positive reviews, noting the game's graphics and sound; the reviewers praised the gameplay following the theme of the source material and having excellent cinematic displays, although there was criticism on the controls, hard difficulty and the large number of enemies that appear on screen.
