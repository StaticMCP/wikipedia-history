So was it that several Chechen commanders rose up and with the support of the Ingush tribes, defended these lands from the Kabardians, one of them being the commander Lors of Bummat. His campaigns and raids were financed by the Chechen prince Meda, who ruled the Galainch'ozh Confederation. However, Meda was soon assassinated, which started a great unrest and political crisis in Galaunch'ozh Confederation.\nTaking advantage of the political unrest in Galainch'ozh Confederation, as well as using Kabardian (Circassian) support, Egi united the \"Khamkhiy\" clans, most notably, the Tergimkhoy, Egoy and Khamkhiy clans, establishing a form of \"confederation\" among the Ingush clans. He then continued to establish control over his neighboring Ingush tribes.\nBattle\nDuring another campaign of Lors against the Kabardians (Circassians), with him having a small army of only 15 fighters, he came across Egi, with his detachment of 7 fighters. Egi ordered tribute from Lors for his passage through Egi's land, but Lors boldly refused. Egi then mounted on his horse and rode against the Akkiy man. a short fight ensued, in which Egi severely wounded Lors. Lors swung his sword at Egi, but Egi cought it and smashed the blade on Lors' head which killed Lors.\nAfter the battle, the Aukhs and the Ingush began to take revenge on each other, but at some point they agreed to a truce, paying a set ransom to the relatives of each person killed on both sides. Egi, as a representative of his clan and an ally of the then-powerful Kabardians (Circassians), was supposed to receive from the Aukhs 10 cows for the blood of each Ingush killed in battle, and in turn, he had to pay the Aukhs 12 cows. The parties paid the cows, and a truce between the Aukhs and the Ingush was established.\nNotes\nReferences"
