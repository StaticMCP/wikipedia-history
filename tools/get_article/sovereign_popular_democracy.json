Its leader is Marco Rizzo.\nHistory\nAfter participating in the 2022 Italian general election under the name Sovereign and Popular Italy, the list was officially dissolved in December 2022 by mutual agreement of its leaders, Marco Rizzo and Francesco Toscano. This happened after Francesco Toscano left his party, Italy Again, to launch a new party called Sovereign and Popular Italy Again (AISP).\nOn 13 January 2023, the National Political Committee of Sovereign Popular Democracy was elected in Rome, followed by the election of the Scientific Committee on 14 January. On 22 January, Marco Rizzo officially launched the party on YouTube. The party includes Marco Rizzo's Communist Party, Francesco Toscano's Sovereign and Popular Italy Again, Gilberto Trombetta's Front for Popular Sovereignty (a split from Reconquer Italy, which had previously participated in ISP), and Antonio Ingroia's Civil Action.\nIn July, Gilberto Trombetta and Enrico Bonfatti denounced on social media the expulsion of Trombetta and his party from DSP, as well as the expulsion of Civil Action, CLNI, FISI and the former senator Bianca Laura Granato, who was the president of AISP. The latter was expelled after writing a letter to Secretary Rizzo in defense of Trombetta. For Popular Sovereign Democracy he ran for the presidency of the autonomous province of Trento in the regional elections in Trentino-Alto Adige in 2023, taking just over 2% (over 5,000 votes), which is not enough to be elected councilor.\nElection results\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
