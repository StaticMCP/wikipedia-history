It was introduced by John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury, recognising the need for a governmental administration on the protection of ancient monuments, and was finally passed after a number of failed attempts on heritage protection acts. The gradual change towards a state-based authority responsible for the safeguarding of the Kingdom's national heritage manifested itself through the appointment of the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments in 1882, General Pitt Rivers.\nDevelopment of the legislation\nAccording to Halfin, \"Lubbock's Bill came at a time when England was among the last of the European nations to be completely without protective legislation for cultural property. Many of his ideas were borrowed from a long history of royal and aristocratic interest in preservation that was prevalent in Europe during the nineteenth century. In particular, Lubbock was strongly influenced by the Abbé Gregoire, who had so successfully championed the cause of cultural preservation in France.\"\nThe first introduction of the bill in 1873 was controversial because it envisioned the government being able to compulsorily purchase monuments on privately owned land if the owner decided to develop the land. By the Act's passage in 1882, these provisions had been removed from the bill.\nThe schedule\nThe act contains a schedule of the initial 68 sites that were covered by the legislation. These are almost all pre-historic monuments, some of the most famous such sites in the country among them, alongside some that were felt to be at particular risk at the time.\nEngland and Wales\nThere were 26 English sites listed in the schedule, in just 10 counties, including seven sites in Wiltshire. Welsh monuments were represented by one site in each of north, south and west Wales.\n{| class=\" wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" |Site name\n!scope=\"col\" |1882 description\n!scope=\"col\" |Site type\n!scope=\"col\" |Period\n!scope=\"col\" |Location\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Plas Newydd Burial Chambers\n|The tumulus and dolmen, Plas Newydd, Llandedwen, Anglesea.\n|Chambered tomb\n|Neolithic\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Wayland's Smithy\n|The tumulus known as Wayland Smith's Forge, Ashbury, Berkshire.\n|Long barrow\n|Neolithic\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Uffington Castle\n|Uffington Castle, Uffington, Berkshire.\n|Hillfort\n|Iron Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Long Meg and Her Daughters\n|The stone circle known as Long Meg and her Daughters, near Penrith, Addingham, Cumberland.\n|Stone circle\n|Bronze Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Castlerigg stone circle\n|The stone circle on Castle Rigg, near Keswick, Crosthwaite, Cumberland.\n|Stone circle\n|Late Neolithic\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Low Longrigg stone circles\n|The stone circles on Burn Moor, St. Bees, Cumberland.\n|Five stone circles\n|Bronze Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Nine Ladies\n|The stone circle known as The Nine Ladies, Stanton Moor, Bakewell, Derbyshire.\n|Stone circle\n|Bronze Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Arbor Low\n|The tumulus known as Arborlow, Bakewell, Derbyshire.\n|Henge\n|Neolithic\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hob Hurst's House\n|Hob Hurst's House and Hut, Baslow Moor.

Subsequent legislation for Ireland used the terminology of historic monuments, which continues in Northern Ireland. Three sites in the schedule are in what became Northern Ireland, one being in County Armagh and two in County Down. The fifteen sites now in the Republic of Ireland are protected by the National Monuments Service and include two world heritage sites. As with England and Wales, the 1882 selection was overwhelmingly those thought to be prehistoric sites, although there is now uncertainty over the age of many sites.\n{| class=\" wikitable plainrowheaders sortable colapsable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" |Site name\n!scope=\"col\" |1882 description\n!scope=\"col\" |Site type\n!scope=\"col\" |Period\n!scope=\"col\"|Location\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Navan Fort\n|The earthen enclosure and mounds called the Navan Fort, Eglish, Armagh.\n|Ceremonial site\n|Iron Age, Celtic\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Glencolumbkille Cashel\n|Stone monuments and groups of sepulchral cists in Glen Maulin, Glencolumbkille, Banagh, Donegal.\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Grianan of Aileach\n|The earthen and stone inclosure known as Grimm of Aileach, Burt, West Innishowen, Donegal.\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Giant's Ring\n|The earthen inclosure and Cromlech called the Giant's Ring near Ballylessan, Drumbo, Upper Castlereagh, Down.\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Downpatrick Mound of Down?\n|The earthen fort at Downpatrick (Dunkeltair), Leoale, Down.\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Staigue stone fort\n|Stone structure called Staigue Fort, Kilcrogham, Dunkerron, Kerry.\n|Ringfort\n|Iron Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Greenmount Motte\n|The earthen mound at Greenmount, Kilsaren, Ardee, Kerry.\n|Motte over a Souterrain\n|Anglo-Norman and older\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Ballina megalithic tomb (Dolmen of the Four Maols)\n|The stone monument at Ballyna, Kilmoremoy, Tyrawly, Mayo.\n|Chamber tomb\n|Bronze Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Glebe Stone Circles\n|Cairns and stone circles at Moytura, Cong, Kilmaine, Mayo.\n|Stone Circles\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Brú na Bóinne (Bend of the Boyne) World heritage site\n|The tumuli, New Grange, Knowth and Dowth, Monknewton and Dowth, Upper Slane, Meath.\n|Megalithic complex\n|Neolithic\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hill of Tara\n|The earthworks on the hill of Tara, Skreen, Meath.\n|\n|multi-period\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Telltown\n|The earthworks at Teltown (Taltin), Upper Kells, Meath.\n|\n|Bronze Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hill of Ward\n|The earthworks at Wardstown (Tlaghta), Athboy, Lune, Meath.\n|Ringfort\n|Iron Age\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Slieve na Calliagh\n|The two central tumuli on the hills called Slieve Na Calliagh, Loughcrew, Fore, Meath.\n|Megalithic complex\n|Neolithic\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Heapstown Cairn\n|The Cairn at Heapstown, Kilmacallan, Tirerrill, Sligo.\n|Passage tomb\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Knocknarea passage tombs & Medb's Cairn\n|Sepulchral remains at Carrowmore.
