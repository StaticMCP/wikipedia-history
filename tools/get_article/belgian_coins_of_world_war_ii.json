Therefore, silver coinage was discontinued and coins were instead minted using pure zinc.\nIn 1944, shortly before the Liberation, the Allies minted 25 million 2 franc coins at the Philadelphia Mint, which were put in circulation after Belgium regained its independence.\nOccupation coinage\nOne Franc\nThe 1 Franc coin was circulated through Belgium from 1941.\n;Belgique-Belgie lettering\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Mintage\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n|1941\n|16,000,000\n|\n|-\n|1942\n|25,000,000\n|\n|-\n|1943\n|28,000,000\n|\n|-\n|1947\n|3,175,000\n|Rare\n|}\n;Belgie-Belgique lettering\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Mintage\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n|1942\n|42,000,000\n|\n|-\n|1943\n|28,000,000\n|\n|-\n|1944\n|24,190,000\n|\n|-\n|1945\n|15,930,000\n|\n|-\n|1946\n|36,000,000\n|\n|-\n|1947\n|3,000,000\n|Rare\n|}\nFive Francs\nThe 5 franc coin was minted between 1941 and 1947, first by the Germans during the occupation of Belgium, and then by the Belgian government after the end of World War II.
