      "text": "# Inward Bound\n\n}}\nInward Bound (IB) is an endurance and orienteering running competition held between the residential halls and colleges of the Australian National University with participation from the Australian Defence Force Academy. It combines aspects of both orienteering and rogaining while challenging personal endurance. Held annually, the competition involves over 250 runners from eleven of the ANU's residences.\nThe competition is split into seven divisions which are dropped off, blindfolded, at an unknown location in the bush. The teams of four people then locate their position and race to the endpoint, picking the quickest route through the countryside. Distances from the endpoint vary from up to 100&nbsp;km for the top divisions to 30&nbsp;km for the lower divisions.\nEvent Outline and Rules\nEach participating residence enters up to seven teams  into the event (one into each division). The drop-off zones and endpoint are in remote and often secluded environments including fire trails, national parks and state forests.\nBefore departing for the drop off point, the teams are scrutinised to ensure that they have a set of compulsory equipment. The compulsory equipment includes:\n*water\n*food\n*maps and compasses\n*survival equipment\nThe teams are then blindfolded before boarding buses and departing for the drop off point. The route to drop-off point is deliberately obfuscated, with buses driving around Canberra in order to cause disorientation. This prevents teams from knowing the drop off location.\nWhen the runners are dropped off they remove their blindfolds and each team proceeds to identify their location.  Typically two runners, known as 'Scouts', from each team will run in opposite directions to find some indication of their location. They have a limited timeframe to get back, with time penalties applied for late return. When they return the team confirms its location and plot a course to the end point.  The teams then race to the endpoint.\nThe rules are structured to ensure that teams rely not only on their fitness, but also on their navigational ability to reach the endpoint.  Thus maps and compasses are the only acceptable navigational aids.  Tools such as GPS and altimeters are forbidden.  Outside assistance in the form of transportation by vehicle or asking other people for the team's location are forbidden.  Checking the addresses on envelopes in mailboxes is also forbidden, as a breach of privacy.\nGenerally, if a team is caught breaking any of the rules, or if they lose compulsory equipment they will be disqualified. Loss of equipment can also result in time penalties.\nEach team receives a number of points for finishing the event.  The number of points for each finishing position increases for each division.  The residence with the most points at the end of the competition wins the event.\nSafety Standards\nAs of 2009, Inward Bound introduced new compulsory safety standards for all teams during the race. Each team was required to carry an EPIRB Distress radiobeacon and a mobile telephone (in a sealed envelope). Organisers now use a comprehensive radio network across the region, 4WD recovery vehicles and first aiders to ensure competitor safety. Since 2012 the race has been viewable through the internet live GPS tracking system.\nHistory\nInward Bound was first held in 1962. Mike Gore, the founder of Questacon, is credited with coming up with the idea in memory of close friend and passionate navigator, Jason Ryan. Ryan is considered to be the 'first' to have embarked on an unmonitored journey through the surrounding Canberra bushland, after setting off in the early hours of the morning on Friday the 17th of August, 1962. After running from what is now known as 'civic' in Canberra, Ryan eventually returned two days later, on the Sunday. The exact reason for the trip has been placed under immense scrutiny, with some reporting that Ryan could hear noises when he was sitting in silence, and thought a run such as this could straighten them out. Others believe it was simply a challenge Gore had set Ryan, for which he completed. Furthermore, Bill Packard and John Foster also helped to start the event, in developing the event from the idea and into its infancy.\nAt the time, the Australian National University had only recently been formed and had only 200 students. The first event consisted of a race from South of Canberra to Bruce Hall. At the time Bruce Hall was the only residence on campus and the student population numbered approximately 200. The initial race was won by a team which hitch-hiked back to Bruce Hall.\nTeams cannot use outside assistance to reach the endpoint. Although the format of the race has changed over time due to safety and insurance requirements, the core challenge is the same.\nIn 2008, Inward Bound was cancelled because the Organisers were unable to get Stakeholders to 'sign off' before the event was scheduled. In 2009, a comprehensive risk management plan was created for the event. This plan, along with a new dialogue of consultation with ANU administration, state and federal authorities, local councils and landholders meant the event returned in 2009 and has since successfully continued.\nIn 2020 and 2021, Inward Bound was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2022 Inward Bound resumed. It also saw the introduction of a strengthened gender equity rule, where no more than 50% of a college's runners are allowed to identify with the same gender. In 2024, 47% of competing athletes were either Female or non-binary, a significant milestone in being both the highest known proportion of non-male athletes to ever compete and the highest absolute number of non-male athletes to compete.\nSafety Standards\nAs of 2009, Inward Bound introduced new compulsory safety standards for all teams during the race. Each team was required to carry an EPIRB Distress radiobeacon, a satellite phone and a 3G mobile telephone (in a sealed envelope). Organisers now use a comprehensive radio network across the region, 4WD recovery vehicles and first aiders to ensure competitor safety. Since 2012 the race has been viewable through the internet live GPS tracking system.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:700px; height:400px;\"\n! Year\n!
