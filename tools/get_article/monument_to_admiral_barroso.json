Correia Lima won a competition held by the Ministry of Justice for the construction of the statue, which is located in the Paris Square, between the districts of Glória and Lapa, in Rio de Janeiro. The statue was built in bronze; it is supported by a masonry support lined with white granite that has inscribed the names of the main vessels involved in the battle and images of officers who died in it.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*"
