Fishkin, it was reorganized and renamed in 2022 under the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law (CDDRL).\nIts projects have influenced deliberative democracy research worldwide and have been cited in studies of civic engagement, polarization, and participatory governance.\nHistory\nThe Center for Deliberative Democracy was founded in 2003 at Stanford University by James S. Fishkin, who developed the method of Deliberative Polling.\nOn July 1, 2022, the center was renamed the Deliberative Democracy Lab (DDL) and formally joined the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law within the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\nResearch and methods\nThe lab studies how informed public deliberation can reduce polarization and improve democratic decision-making.\nIts primary research tool, deliberative polling, gathers a representative sample of citizens, provides balanced briefing materials, and facilitates moderated discussions before and after opinion measurement.\nThe results are used to assess how opinions change when participants become better informed.\nNotable projects\nMongolia National Deliberative Poll\nIn 2017, the lab conducted the world's first nationwide deliberative poll in Mongolia in collaboration with the Mongolian Parliament and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\nThe project gathered a representative sample of citizens to discuss proposed constitutional amendments and provide informed recommendations to policymakers.\nThe findings influenced subsequent parliamentary deliberations and were cited in the drafting of constitutional reforms.\nAmerica in One Room\nIn 2019, the lab organized America in One Room, a large-scale national experiment that brought together over 500 voters to discuss major U.S. policy issues in a nonpartisan setting.\nFollow-up studies showed measurable decreases in polarization among participants and increased understanding of opposing views.\nClimate Leaders Fellowship\nAccording to Rustic Pathways and the Deliberative Democracy Lab, the Climate Leaders Fellowship engages secondary-school students around the world in deliberative civic action on climate issues.\nImpact\nThe lab’s research on deliberation has been widely cited in academic literature and covered by major media outlets, including *The New York Times*, *Politico*, and *Stanford News*.\nThe lab conducts empirical research on democratic innovation and deliberative practices.\nSee also\n* James S.
