It was recorded and mixed by Jim Siegel at Outpost Studio in Stoughton, Massachusetts.\nAccording to laut.de, the European title \"Punk Rock Rhythm & Blues\" perfectly describes their style. According to Brackenridge's History of Psychobilly, this captures much more of their spirit than the American title. The Blueprint fanzine is more specific: \"Half of the 14 tracks are extremely successful cover versions of late 70s and early 80s punk rock classics.\" \"In addition, songs from the 50s in the rhythm & blues category are covered perfectly.\" The album has been described as a really fun and energetic mix of 50's rock & roll, swing and big band music channeled through vintage street punk influences and not lacking in serious songwriting. Ox-Fanzine sees Over the Counter Culture as a “strong record” that distinguishes itself from other punk rock releases with its “extraordinarily fresh mixture of (street) punk rock, rockabilly, rock'n'roll, swing and a pinch of old school hardcore”. The roughness comes close to the unpolished sound of the first Mighty Mighty Bosstones album. Torr Skoog's voice sounds like a Lemmy-influenced version of Slapshot singer Jack Kelly. In its conclusion, the magazine recognizes one of the most energetic records of the year. Razorcake compares the band with the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and with Hi-Fi and the Roadburners and they are described as one of the great and unusual bands from Boston whose performances are explosive. According to Plastic Bomb, they are breaking new ground and an 'Upstarter review even certified the Kings of Nuthin' as redefining an entire musical genre: \"Much like their hometown brethren, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Kings of Nuthin' have done for Rock and Roll what the aforementioned did for ska.\"\nTrack listing\nYoung Jessie\n| length14 = 3:08\n}}\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n* Torr Skoog – lead vocals\n* Zack Brines – piano\n* Liam Crill – drums\n* Chris Wilkinson – washboard\n* Hayden Cummings – tenor saxophone\n* Trafton Waldrop – electric guitar\n* Thomas Lorioux – upright bass\n* Jon Natchez – baritone saxophone\nTechnical\n* Dave Schultz – mastering engineer\n* Jim Siegel – mixer, recording engineer\n* John Cohan – drum technician\nArtwork and design\n* Amy Archer – cover photo, photography\n* Angela Smith – photography, artwork\nReferences"
