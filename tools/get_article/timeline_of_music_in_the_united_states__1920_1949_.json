Stylistically, it resembles other vaudeville music of the era, but it borrows a poetic and melodic form from African-American folk music, as well as elements of unrelated \"field-holler\" vocal practices. More than its traditional predecessors, this mixture would come to define and epitomize the blues for later generations. The song becomes a surprising commercial success that would open up the market for African-American music by selling more than 8,000 copies a week for several months. It is followed by a string of hits by African-American women singers.\n*A paper shortage contributes to a cost increase and a downturn in the sheet music publishing industry.\n* Joseph Patek forms a family band that will become one of the longest-lasting and most influential Czech-Texan groups.\n* KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania claims to be the first radio station with regularly scheduled programs.\n* Michigan and Wisconsin organize their first state-sponsored band contests.\n* Carl Fischer Music publishes the first full band music scores in the United States.\n{| align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=250 cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin-left:0.5em;\" class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ddd;\" | Early 1920s music trends\n|-\n|\n*In jazz bands, the cornetist becomes more and more frequently assigned to the melody of a piece, rather than shifting that responsibility among various instrumentalists.\n*American audiences begin to turn away from predominantly German classical music towards works by the like of Frenchman Erik Satie and the Russian Alexander Scriabin.\n*An organized country music industry begins to evolve, through commercial recording and radio broadcasting.\n*Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg begins advocating serialism, a composition technique that will come to dominate American classical music later in the 20th century.\n*The creative peak of jazz in Chicago.\n*A printers strike and paper shortage decimates the music publishing industry by raising costs, as customers are beginning to focus more on recordings than sheet music.\n*The golden age of the \"black female blues singer\" begins and ends.\n*American public schools begin offering music instruction for band and orchestra.\n*The Flanagan Brothers begin recording prolifically with great success.

He also composes his first song, \"If I Don't Get There\".\n*The Penn Hotel becomes the first African-American-owned hotel in Baltimore; it is on Pennsylvania Avenue, then a major center for black culture and business, and where the Douglass Theater, later more famously known as the Royal Theatre, is opened as one of the finest African-American theaters in the country. The Royal Theatre will become one of the major stops on the black entertainment circuit.\n*Canadian-born black composer Robert Nathaniel Dett is the first to arrange a spiritual in a motet, with \"Don't Be Weary Traveler\", which won the Francis Boott prize, given out by Harvard University.\n* W. C. Handy and Harry Pace start Black Swan, the first black-owned record label.\n* Paul Gosz forms the Empire Band, which will become one of the major Czech American bands of the Midwest.\n* Black Swan Records, founded and led by Harry Pace, becomes the first African-American-owned record label, specializing in what was then known as \"race music\".

This is an important part of the early evolution of country music. Peer thus becomes the first professional talent scout.\n* Jelly Roll Morton makes his first recordings, as a jazz band member and as a solo pianist, and begins publishing songs through the Melrose Brothers Music Company. Morton is the \"first to perceive and define the distinction between ragtime and jazz, insisting that the latter, whatever its sources or borrowings, was a new type of music that transformed what it absorbed\". He is working with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, the first white Chicago jazz band to record, using a black group (King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band) as a model. Morton's recording with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings constitutes the first \"interracial recording sessions\".\n* King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, performing at the Lincoln Gardens in Chicago, records with Gennett Studios, resulting in a set of recordings that are \"landmark(s) in the history of jazz... the first major set of recordings by black jazz musicians\". After this point, the music of \"black jazz performers as well as white was preserved and circulated on record.\"\n*The National Association of Broadcasters is formed to be an \"intermediary\" between ASCAP and the radio broadcasting industry.\n*The radio station WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas becomes one of the first to gain an overwhelming response with rural white music, specifically square dance music.\n*Canadian-born black composer R.

It is still among the \"most popular of American compositions\".\n* Serge Koussevitzky becomes the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; under his tenure, he will influentially promote new works by American and European composers.\n*The Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, with Louis Armstrong, begins performing at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan; this is considered the first big jazz band that used written arrangements to achieve the rhythm and intensity of swing.\n* George and Ira Gershwin's Lady, Be Good opens on Broadway; the musical, the duo's first hit, was a \"groundbreaking... absorption of Jazz Age lingo (and the composers') felicitous skill at setting vernacular speech to music\".\n* Herbert Léonard becomes the first known bluesman to record using \"first position\".\n* Juanita Arizona Dranes begins recording for OKeh, making her a \"much in-demand artist at black churches and revivals\".\n* Ma Rainey becomes a wildly popular blues singer across the country, with her band the Jazz Wild Cats.\n*The Music Corporation of America is founded by Billy Stein, the first booking agency specializing in popular music performers.\n* Ernö Rapée's Motion Picture Moods for Pianists and Organists is an important reference work used by writers to choose music for film.\n*The last Big House ceremony among the Delaware Native Americans is held.\n*The most popular of the early Lithuanian American performers, Antanas Vanagaitis, comes to the United States with a performance group.\n* Immigration Act of 1924 formally enacts a restriction on Japanese immigration that had effectively been in place since 1908; this is said to constitute the end of issei, or the first generation of Japanese immigration. The same bill has similar effects in other communities, making it a common marker separating different forms of immigrant culture and music, such as among Arab Americans.\n* Bascom Lamar Lunsford, a regionally famous passionate advocate for Appalachian music, becomes the first person to record old-time banjo music, with \"Jesse James\" and \"I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground\", both for Okeh.\n* WLS begins broadcasting National Barn Dance, a popular radio program that exposes new audiences to traditional Southern and Appalachian music. This will become the first major country music radio program, lasting until 1969 (by then broadcast on WGN). Bradley Kincaid is the show's first star; he will later be the first country star to profit from the sale of mail-order songbooks.\n* Riley Puckett and Gid Tanner are the first to record country music for Columbia Records, and Puckett became possibly the first to yodel on record, with \"Rock All Our Babies to Sleep\".\n* Rudolf Friml's Rose-Marie is an \"immensely successful operetta that (marks) a turning point in the American musical theater\".

It is the best-selling song of country music's first decade.\n* Bix Beiderbecke joins the Wolverine Orchestra, making his first recordings; he will be more influential than any white composer or performer in Chicago in the era, and will be perhaps the first white jazz performer to be widely respected by African-American jazz audiences. Beiderbecke was also the \"first important jazzman to be inspired by contemporary classical music\". His Wolverine Orchestra is the first white group to play jazz in an authentically African American style.\n* James P. Johnson's musical ''Runnin' Wild introduces the Charleston dance.\n* Enric Madriguera becomes director of the Havana Casino Orchestra, and begins introducing the Cuban danzón'' to American audiences.\n1925\n{| align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=250 cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin-left:0.5em;\" class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ddd;\" | Mid-1920s music trends\n|-\n|\n* Henry Ford helps usher in what he refers to as a \"square dance revival\".\n*Scholars and collectors of folk songs become increasingly concerned about the authenticity of the blues they were recording and describing.\n* Hall Johnson and Eva Jessye lead a number of professional choirs to fame, bringing media attention to the concert-arranged African-American spiritual.\n* Sylvester Weaver, Lonnie Johnson and Papa Charlie Jackson are among a number of male solo vaudeville performers to begin recording attempts at popular blues, but Blind Lemon Jefferson's recordings in 1925 kicked off a wave of like-minded acts.\n*Record companies begin recording and marketing to Mexican Americans in California.\n*A more traditional sound in Finnish-American commercial recordings supplants the earlier format, which was based around semi-classical performance.\n*With the advent of national radio broadcasting companies, large businesses begin to sponsor a single show in its entirety.

Other barn dance programs during the era are broadcast by WBAP in Fort Worth and WSB in Atlanta.\n* Louis Armstrong begins recording with his Hot Five and Hot Seven bands, for OKeh in Chicago. These resulting records are widely influential and establish the early jazz style, and helped launch Armstrong's career, which will eventually make him \"one of the best-known and best-loved entertainers in the world\".  Music historian Richard Crawford has called these recordings \"an enduring contribution to music history (that transcend) categorical boundaries to introduce a powerful new, utterly American mode of expression\". The recordings establish Armstrong's career as the first virtuoso soloist in jazz, and move the field from one based on collective improvisation among all members of an ensemble to one in which one or more individual performers lead the performance through improvising. The Hot Five was Kid Ory, Johnny Dodds, Lil Hardin and Johnny St Cyr, while the Hot Seven added Pete Briggs and Baby Dodds, replacing Ory with John Thomas.\n* Ralph Peers names Al Hopkins' band The Hillbillies, the first documented usage of the word hillbilly in a Southern rural musical context.\n* Lonnie Johnson begins his performing career after winning first prize at a blues concert.

The work may also be the \"first use of (long periods of silence) for all instruments\".\n* Blind Lemon Jefferson begins making his first recordings, for Paramount Records, which include his first two hits, \"Booster Blues\" and \"Dry Southern Blues\". He will become \"one of the most important and influential of the early bluesmen\", and his success will inspire record companies to search for more authentically rural styles of the blues.\n*The American Society of Ancient Instruments is founded by Ben Stad, a Dutch violinist, in Philadelphia. It is the \"first American ensemble known to have performed on period instruments\". The original ensemble included a harpsichord, viols, Baroque violins and cellos.\n* Roba Stanley becomes the first woman to record a solo country song, her most popular this year being \"Single Life\".\n* Sam Wooding & His Orchestra begin performing outside the United States. Wooding will become one of Philadelphia's first internationally prominent jazz musician, and he will be the first African American to tour with a jazz band outside the country, and the first American to play jazz in the Soviet Union, tour South America and record in Europe.\n* Ernest Van \"Pop\" Stoneman's \"The Titanic\" is one of the first major hits of what is now called country music.

These legendary recording sessions are often considered the historical foundation for country music. Peer's codified the standard contractual arrangements between music publishers and performers with regards to session fees and songwriting remuneration.\n* Roger Pryor Dodge begins transcribing the jazz solos; these transcriptions will be performed onstage, proving \"that a sympathetic reading of hot solos from notation... lost nothing of the intrinsic beauty of the melodic line\".\n* Carl McVicker, Sr., a trumpeter, begins teaching at Westinghouse High School in Pittsburgh. He will teach Erroll Garner, Ahmad Jamall, Billy Strayhorn and Mary Lou Williams, all of whom help establish Pittsburgh as a center for the piano and home for many of the country's top pianists.\n* Bix Beiderbecke makes a series of recordings with Frank Trumbauer; though Beiderbecke would remain fairly obscure during his lifetime, he will go on to be remembered as perhaps the first \"legendary jazz musician\".

The film sets a historical precedent for the commercializing potential of a music star in a movie.\n*The composer George Antheil is the subject of a concert, billed as \"The Biggest Musical Event of the Year\", and promoted by Ezra Pound and Donald Friede, which features his ultramodern works, ending with the \"presumptive piece de resistance\", Ballet mécanique, which turns out to be a \"colossal flop\". One review said that no piece had ever \"(flopped) to earth with a more sickening and merited thud\".\n* Meade Lux Lewis records \"Honky Tonk Train Blues\", the first boogie woogie hit and an enduring classic of the piano blues.\n*A major flood in Mississippi will become one of the most musically notable natural disasters in American history, subject of many blues and gospel songs, most famously Charley Patton's \"High Water Everywhere\" and Elder Edwards' \"The 1927 Flood\".
