From 1975 to 2022, acting awards were presented in eight categories: separate categories by gender; further divided by lead or featured performer; producing four acting awards each for plays and musicals.\nIn 2023, the Drama Desk organization announced that, starting with that year's awards, the eight acting categories had been retired and replaced with four gender neutral categories with twice the winners and nominees: separate categories by lead or featured performer; producing two acting categories each for plays and musicals. The former awards for Outstanding Actor in a Musical and Outstanding Actress in a Musical were merged to create this Outstanding Lead Performance in a Musical category.\nWinners and nominees\n;Key\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Year\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Actor\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Title\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Character\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Ref.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"13\" |2023\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Annaleigh Ashford\n|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n|Mrs. Lovett\n|rowspan=12|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|J.
