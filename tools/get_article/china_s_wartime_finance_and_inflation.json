It discusses the hyperinflation that hit the Republic of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nChang Kia-ngau of Stanford University wrote that the \"over-all discussion of fiscal and monetary policy for the most part accords with\" Chang's own book, The Inflationary Spiral. According to reviewer Joan Robinson, ''China's Wartime Finance and Inflation \"relies a good deal\" on The Inflationary Spiral and on The Chinese Inflation 1937-49'' by Chou Shin-hsin, who had worked for the Central Bank of China.\nReferences\n*\n*\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n---\n\n## China’s Wartime Finance and Inflation\n\n#REDIRECT China's Wartime Finance and Inflation"
