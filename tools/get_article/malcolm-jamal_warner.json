According to Mike Geist, vice president of Caribbean Guard, a volunteer lifeguard organization that patrols beaches in the area, \"After the surf lesson, I think [Warner and several others in the group] stayed on the beach for a while and then decided to get back in the water.\" Subsequently, strong ocean currents common to the area resulted in three in the group being in distress, \"including a woman and a young girl.\" With assistance from beachgoers, the three were eventually able to reach the shore. After finding out that there was a fourth person missing—Warner—an unnamed boogie boarder and doctor moved into the water in hopes of finding him. After about a five-minute search, the unnamed doctor located Warner unconscious and submerged in water. According to the  Costa Rican Red Cross, emergency responders were dispatched at approximately 2:10&nbsp;p.m. following reports of a water-related incident involving two adult men. Warner received CPR for approximately 45 minutes before being pronounced dead at the scene. A second man was transported to a nearby clinic in critical condition. The Red Cross stated that both victims had been removed from the water prior to paramedics' arrival, and the case was referred to local police.\nOn July 21, 2025, the Judicial Investigation Agency confirmed Warner had been caught in a strong current. He was pronounced dead at the scene, and the official cause of death—accidental asphyxia by submersion (drowning)—was confirmed following the completion of his autopsy on July 22.\nTributes\nOn August 8, Pamela Warner shared a tribute on a newly established Instagram account celebrating her son's life.  She expressed comfort in knowing that in his final moments, \"he was at peace and did not suffer\". She described him as a devoted husband, father, and son, as well as her confidant and partner. Pamela highlighted his dedication to his craft, having found full confidence in acting at age eight and later pursuing music as well as poetry, culminating in Grammy recognition. Pamela also announced plans for a public memorial to be held later in 2025 or in early 2026. She encouraged those who are grieving to cherish the aspects of his life that resonated most deeply, saying that keeping those memories alive would sustain his spirit.\nNotable figures and costars that paid tribute to Warner included Beyonce, Bill Cosby, Morris Chestnut, Karen Malina White, Eddie Griffin, Raven-Symoné, Keshia Knight Pulliam and Gary LeRoi Gray.\nThe S2 episode 'Mother Love' of Murder in a Small Town is dedicated to his memory.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
