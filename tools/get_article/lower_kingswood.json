It is between Kingswood and Reigate, and is bisected by the A217 dual carriageway. Neighbouring settlements include Tadworth and Reigate also Redhill.\nHistory\nThe village was situated around the Brighton Road (now the A217) and the crossroads with Buckland Road/Smithy Lane, the centre being where the Fox On The Hill pub, now an Indian restaurant and takeaway, and the Church of the Wisdom of God are located. Before the upgrading of the A217 Brighton Road to a dual carriageway, there was a pond outside the pub, where horses would frequently stop to drink after climbing the hill and before progressing on to Reigate.\nThe name “Lower Kingswood” dates back to the reign of King Henry VIII. Kingswood and lower Kingswood were the royal hunting woods. The Sportsman public house in Mogador was originally Henry’s hunting lodge. Henry had a palace on Nonsuch park “Nonsuch Palace” and the surrounding royal land stretched from Merton Abbey to Reigate.\nTransport\nThe nearest railway stations are Reigate, Kingswood Railway Station and Redhill Railway Station.\nBuses travel along the A217, north to Epsom and Sutton and south to Reigate and Redhill.\nLower Kingswood is situated very close to Junction 8 of the M25.\nBus Transport is not the best, buses end at 7:45 coming south from Redhill and Reigate.\nSocialising\nThere are several social clubs in Lower Kingswood, catering for all ages, including youth clubs such as drama and football. For the older generations there is a bowls club and Women's Institute.
