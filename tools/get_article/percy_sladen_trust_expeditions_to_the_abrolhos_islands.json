These expeditions conducted extensive research into the natural history of the Houtman Abrolhos, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Western Australia.\nThe first expedition lasted for three weeks from November 1913; the expedition members were Dakin and Wilfred Alexander. The pair undertook shore collecting, biological observations on various islands, some geological observations, and dredging in the lagoons and between the island groups. The resultant collections and observations were sufficiently important to warrant a second visit, and accordingly a second expedition was funded. The second expedition lasted for four weeks from October 1915; this time Dakin's companion was A. Cayzer. More hydrographic equipment was carried the second time, and a great deal of time was spent in dredging.\nThe Percy Sladen Trust expeditions were only the second scientific expeditions to the islands, the first being a visit by William Saville-Kent in the 1890s. The expeditions ultimately contributed substantially to published information on the biota of the archipelago. Publications that stemmed from the expedition are as follows:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nDespite this large list of papers, not all of the collected specimens were written up; for example, of the molluscs collected, only the opisthobranchs were written up.\nReferences"
