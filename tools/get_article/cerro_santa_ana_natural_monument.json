It has an area of 1900 hectares and a maximum height of 830 masl. It was declared Natural Monument on June 14, 1972 according to Decree No. 1.005, under the protection of INPARQUES.\nUnlike the rest of the peninsula Santa Ana Hill has as characteristics the contrast of its greenery with the xerophytic vegetation of the area of Paraguaná.\nIt has three peaks: Santa Ana (highest), Buena Vista and Moruy. In the ascent there are progressive changes in climate and vegetation. In the lower parts a dry environment of xerophytic vegetation predominates with thorny forest, while in the higher parts a woody vegetation develops, with leafy trees of 10 to 15 meters in height, with abundant epiphytes, mosses and lichens favored by the high humidity.\nIts fauna is predominantly the birds that live in the humid jungle.\nGallery\nFile:Otra vista del Cerro Santa Ana, Estado Falcón.jpg|\nFile:Monumento Natural Cerro Santa Ana.jpg|\nFile:Moruy Peak at Cerro Santa Ana - En el Picacho Moruy del Cerro Santa Ana (22941026431).jpg|\nFile:Vegetación Cerro Santa Ana.jpg|\nFile:Cerro santa ana.jpg|\nSee also\n*List of national parks of Venezuela\n*Aristides Rojas Natural Monument\nReferences"
