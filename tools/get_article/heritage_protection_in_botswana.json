The Act, enacted on 24 August 2001, authorizes the Minister of Environment, Natural Resources and Tourism, in consultation with the Commissioner of Monuments and Relics, to designate ancient monuments (defined as structures or sites dating before 1 June 1902), historic buildings (post-1902), relics, and other heritage items as national monuments under statutory regulation. The Act is administered by the Department of National Museums and Monuments under the Ministry of Environment and Tourism. A total of 109 sites have been officially declared as national monuments in Botswana.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ List of National Monuments in Botswana\n|-\n! Site Name !! Location !!
