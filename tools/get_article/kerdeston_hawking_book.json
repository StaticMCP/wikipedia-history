A few surviving leaves of the Kerdeston Hunting Book were accepted simultaneously. These were both placed into the library's extensive collection of Middle English manuscripts.\nContents\nThe Book contains six texts on falconry, two of which have not survived in any other form. Topics discussed in these texts include the training of hawks and falcons for hunting, and the treatment of their illnesses. Illuminations, produced in a workshop in Suffolk, accompany the text.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_82949 Details at the British Library]"
