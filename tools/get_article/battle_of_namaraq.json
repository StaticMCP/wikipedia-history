During the Khilafat of Umar, Muslims under the command of Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha and Khalid bin Waleed  conquered Al-Hirah, a part of the Persian Empire. The Persians were determined to recover Al Hirah from the Muslims. Rostam Farrokhzad, a famous Sasanian general, sent some of his relatives from the Ispahbudhan family, the most notable one being Jaban, along with some Persian generals. Khalid bin Walid had already left for Syria so Muthanna had to fight alone. Umar sent Abu Ubaid with reinforcements. In the battle that followed the Persians were defeated.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of namaraq\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Namaraq"
