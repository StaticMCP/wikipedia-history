It became state property in 1945, and since 1993 the museum has occupied the entire building, parts of which it had been using since 1895.\nOne of the largest museums in Bulgaria, it has 2,150 m2 of exhibition area with exhibits from the prehistoric, Thracian, Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman periods of the region's history, as well as from the times of the medieval Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires, Ottoman rule and the Bulgarian National Revival (including about 900 medieval and Revival icons).\nThe Museum's arguably most celebrated exhibit is the Gold of Varna, the oldest gold treasure in the world, excavated in 1972 and dating to 4600-4200 BCE, which occupies three separate exhibition halls.\nThe museum also manages two open-air archaeological sites, the large Roman baths in the city centre and the medieval grotto of Aladzha Monastery at Golden Sands Nature Park.\nFour other sites are undergoing conservation and will be added to the museum roster: the 4th-5th-century episcopal basilica on Khan Krum Street; the basilica and monastery of the same period at Dzhanavara; the 9th-10th-century Theotokos monastery and scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at Pchelina; and the Mediaeval fortified settlement of Kastritsi at Euxinograd.\nThe museum has also a library, a children's study museum, a gift shop, and a cafeteria. Its courtyard lapidarium hosts the annual [http://www.vsjf.com/ Varna Summer International Jazz Festival].\nImage:Or de Varna - Nécropole.jpg\nImage:Burial with gold treasure, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm25a.jpg|Burial with gold treasure, 4600-4200 BCE\nImage:Collier nécropole Varna.jpg\nImage:Médaillon byzantin - Varna.jpg\nImage:Collier byzantin - Varna.JPG\nImage:Bijoux byzantins - Varna.JPG\nImage:Bijou byzantin - Musée de Varna.jpg\nImage:Collier pierres - Varna.JPG\nImage:Byzantine commercial measures.jpg\nImage:Icone 2 - Musée de Varna.jpg\nImage:Icone Musée Varna.jpg\nExternal links\n* [http://www.archaeo.museumvarna.com/en/ Varna Archaeological Museum website]"
