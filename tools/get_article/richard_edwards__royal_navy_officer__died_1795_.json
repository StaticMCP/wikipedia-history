He also served as Commander-in-Chief, The Nore from 1788 to 1792.\nNaval career\nEdwards was promoted to lieutenant in 1740 and to captain in 1753. He was appointed governor of Newfoundland for his first term in 1757. His main concern was defence of the colony as Great Britain and France were at war. Edwards was re-appointed governor for a second term in 1779 and was again concerned with the colony's defences – only this time against American privateers. In 1780 he formed the Newfoundland Volunteers under the command of Robert Pringle. Edwards ordered the construction of Fort Townshend (see Lord Townshend) and the Quidi Vidi batteries including those at Petty Harbour. Promoted vice-admiral in 1787, he became in Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in 1788. He was promoted to Admiral of the Blue in 1794.\nSee also\n* Governors of Newfoundland\n* List of people from Newfoundland and Labrador\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/govhouse/governors/g19.html Biography at Government House The Governorship of Newfoundland and Labrador]\n|-"
