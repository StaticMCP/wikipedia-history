They are directive members of the Hispanic American Liberal Conference and as an intellectual group nowadays, they are willing to become a political party in the 2010.\nODLV uses the street alternative propaganda to promote classical liberalism, free-market ideas, individual rights and liberal capitalism. They have even filmed a controversial documentary: The Way Out, Liberal Capitalism (La Salida, el Capitalismo Liberal) with the support of the Movimiento Demócrata Liberal and Rumbo Propio para el Zulia.\nExternal links\n*\n*"
