So Muhammad despatched Ka’b ibn 'Umair al-Ghifari al-Ansari at the head of 15 men to deal with this situation to a location beyond Wadi al-Qura (part of Syria).\nThey encountered the warriors, and called them to accept Islam, but the polytheists refused and showered the Muslims with arrows killing all of them except one (who pretended to be dead) who was carried back home later seriously wounded to tell Mohammed what had happened.\nMuhammad was upset by this and planned an expedition to avenge his followers. The plan was cancelled when Muhammad learnt that the enemy had deserted the place.\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nNotes"
