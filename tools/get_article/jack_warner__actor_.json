He is closely associated with the role of PC George Dixon, which he played in the 1950 film The Blue Lamp and later in the television series Dixon of Dock Green from 1955 until 1976, but he was also for some years one of Britain's most popular film stars.  He also periodically released novelty records - comic songs or collections related to his Dixon role - for example his 1958 release \"An Ordinary Copper\" which was released by Oriole Records - and reissued twice afterward.\nEarly life\nWarner was born Horace John Waters in Bromley-by-Bow, Poplar, London, the third child of Edward William Waters, master fulling maker and undertaker's warehouseman, and Maud Mary Best. His sisters, Elsie and Doris Waters, were comediennes who usually performed as \"Gert and Daisy\".\nWarner attended the Coopers' Company's Grammar School for Boys in Mile End, while his sisters both attended the nearby sister school, Coborn School for Girls in Bow. The three children were choristers at St. Leonard's Church in Bromley-by-Bow, and for a time, Warner was the choir's soloist.\nAfter leaving school, he studied automobile engineering at the Northampton Institute (now part of the City University, London) but being more practical than academic he left after a year to work at the repair facilities of F.W. Berwick and Company in Balham, where he started by sweeping the floors for 2d per hour. Frederick William Berwick became a partner in the Anglo-French automobile manufacturing company Sizaire-Berwick and, in August 1913, Warner was sent to work as a mechanic in Paris. He drove completed chassis to the coast from where they were shipped to England, road-testing them en route. He acquired a working knowledge of French which stood him in good stead throughout his life; an imitation of Maurice Chevalier became a part of his repertoire.\nDuring the First World War, he served in France as a driver in the Royal Flying Corps and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1918. He returned to England and the motor trade in 1919, graduating from hearses to occasional car racing at Brooklands, where he maintained and sometimes raced Henrietta Lister's Aston Martin. He was over thirty before he became a professional entertainer.\nCareer\nWarner first became known to the general public in music hall and radio. By the early years of the Second World War, he was nationally known and starred in a BBC radio comedy show, Garrison Theatre, invariably opening with \"A Monologue Entitled...\".\nFilm\nWarner's first film was The Dummy Talks (1943), in which he had the lead role. He had a support role in The Captive Heart (1946), a successful film. Also successful were Hue and Cry and Dear Murderer (both 1947). Warner was the patriarch of the Huggett family in Holiday Camp (1947) which was a big hit. He played a policeman in It Always Rains on Sunday (1947), and was another family man in the comedy Easy Money (1948).\nHe was in a war film, Against the Wind (1948), and starred in a thriller, ''My Brother's Keeper (1948). The Huggett family had been so well received in Holiday Camp that production company Gainsborough Pictures decided to give them their own series, so Warner was seen in Here Come the Huggetts (1948), Vote for Huggett (1949) and The Huggetts Abroad (1949). He was one of several names in Train of Events and played the governor of a borstal institution in Boys in Brown (both 1949).\nWarner was by now established as one of the most popular British actors in the country. His stock rose further when he played PC George Dixon pursuing young hoodlum Dirk Bogarde in The Blue Lamp (1950), the most successful film at the box office that year. One observer predicted, \"This film will make Jack the most famous policeman in Britain.\"\nWarner performed in a comedy Talk of a Million (1951) and a thriller Valley of Eagles (1951). He had a small part in Scrooge (1951) then played a policeman again in Emergency Call (1952). He was one of several stars in Meet Me Tonight (1952) and returned to comedy for Those People Next Door (1953). He was top-billed in The Square Ring and The Final Test (both 1953). In the POW film Albert R.N. (1953) he was billed beneath Anthony Steel.\nAdditional thrillers followed: Bang! You're Dead (1954) and Forbidden Cargo (1954). He co-starred in the Hammer film version of The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) and had a cameo-like supporting role as the police superintendent in the 1955 Ealing Studios black comedy The Ladykillers.\nEven with his success that followed in television, Warner performed in the occasional film such as Now and Forever (1956), Home and Away (1956), Carve Her Name with Pride (1958) and Jigsaw (1962). His last film appearance was in Dominique (1979).\nTelevision\nWarner was interviewed by Christopher Chataway for Panorama (British TV programme) in September, 1957, on which he was appearing as President of The Sunday Freedom Association, to advocate for the revision of UK law known as The Sunday Observance Act.\nAlthough the police constable he played in The Blue Lamp was shot dead in the film, the character was revived in 1955 for the BBC television series Dixon of Dock Green'', which ran until 1976. However, in the series' later years, Warner's character became ridiculed, and the series no longer supported by the police, since Warner at 80 was so obviously well past compulsory retirement age, although supposedly confined to a less active desk sergeant role. The series had a prime-time slot on Saturday evenings, and always opened with Dixon giving a brief soliloquy to the camera, beginning with the words, \"Good evening, all\". At the conclusion of the episode, Dixon would once again address the camera, this time reflecting on the previous events or describing what occurred afterwards. According to Warner's autobiography, Jack of All Trades, Queen Elizabeth II once visited the television studio where the series was made, and told Warner \"that she thought Dixon of Dock Green had become part of the British way of life\".\nPersonal life\nIn 1933, Warner married company secretary Muriel Winifred (\"Mollie\"), daughter of independently wealthy Roberts Peters. The couple had no children.\nWarner was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1965. In 1973, he was made a Freeman of the City of London. Warner commented in his autobiography that the honour \"entitles me to a set of 18th century rules for the conduct of life urging me to be sober and temperate\". Warner added, \"Not too difficult with Dixon to keep an eye on me!\"\nHe died, aged 85, of pneumonia in the Royal Masonic Hospital, Ravenscourt Park, Hammersmith, London, in 1981. The characterisation by Warner of Dixon was held in such high regard that officers from Paddington Green Police Station bore the coffin at his funeral.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
