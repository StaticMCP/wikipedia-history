The ceremony is held every year during the conference proceedings of the Bank of Albania.\nThe first ceremony was held on October 31, 2006. A scientific committee of Albanian and foreign representatives evaluated more than thirty dissertations submitted by Albanian students from all over the world and three prizes were awarded to the following students: the First Prize (Gold Medal) to Gizelda Emini, a finance graduate of the University of Tirana, the Second Prize (Silver Medal) to Arber Borici, a computer science and economics graduate of the University of New York, Tirana, and the Third Prize (Bronze Medal) to Lorena Gega, a finance graduate of the University of Tirana. The then Governor of the Bank of Albania, Ardian Fullani, emphasised that the award would encourage prospective students to develop advanced dissertations along with undergraduate research in public and private universities in Albania.\nDescription\nIn 2020 the annual award, given by the Governor of the Bank of Albania Gent Sejkoto, was described as an award for Albanian students worldwide who have developed the best diploma theses at the completion of their undergraduate studies, for \"research related to monetary and international economics, financial stability, economic integration issues of Balkan countries in the European Union, monetary policy and macro-prudential policies of the Bank of Albania, fiscal policy and their role in economy, the Albanian banking system, and overall economy aspects\". Typically, the first place award is given by Gent Sejkoto himself, and the second and third place awards are given by other bank board members.\nThe Governor's Award monetary prizes are as follows:\n– First Prize: 250,000 ALL (about $2972 USD)\n– Second Prize: 200,000 ALL (about $2377 USD)\n– Third Prize: 150,000 ALL (about $1783 USD)\nWinners\n2020\n* First place: Ms. Megi Jaupi (ETH Zurich University, Switzerland) for the study on \"Generative Adversarial Networks for Multivariate Return Simulation and Robust Portfolio Optimization”. The thesis is based on and applies the methodology of neutral networks, as one of the most innovative and sophisticated methods for the approximation of multidimensional variables allocation in the case study of economy and finance.\n* Second place: Mr. Argi Hanku (University of Vienna, Austria) for the study of “Evaluating Low Frequency Liquidity Proxies”. This study focuses and discusses liquidity as an important characteristic of securities investment\n* Third place: Ms. Eda Meta (Berlin School of Economics and Law, Germany) for her “Assessment of the impact of CoCo bonds on banks”.

This research assesses the impact and channels of the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing policies - specifically, the purchasing program in the corporate sector (CSPP) and the emergency purchasing program during the pandemic (PEPP) - on corporate bond's yields, employing an empirical approach of assessing the denominated corporate bonds’ yield in both euro and US dollar.\n* Second place: Mr .Taulant Yzellari (University of Cologne, Germany) for the thesis on: “The international dynamics of real estate prices and the macro-economy”. The study analyses the relationship between the GDP, the CPI, real estate prices, lending and interest rates, using a balanced VAR panel, for 17 OECD countries over two time periods, 1975-2017 and 1984-2017, while also observing the Granger causality.\n* Third place:  Mr. Ilir Brasha (University of Tirana) for his thesis on: “The impact of government spending on economic growth, the size of the multiplier. The case of Albania” This study analyses the impact of government spending on the level of the Gross Domestic Product, by calculating the government spending multiplier by using two methods: the empirical approach method Structural Vector Auto-Regressive (SVAR) and the Bucket Approach.\n2023\n* First place: Ms. Aurora Kapo (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for her study on “Narrative economics: Central Bank Communication and Inflation Expectations”. Through this topic, she has evaluated the effect of the tone (implying the positive or negative stance) of the communication of monetary policy statements, in the case of the European Central Bank and the American Federal Reserve Bank, on the inflation expectations of households and professional experts, as well as on other macroeconomic indicators.\n* Second place: Mr. Virjosin Stafasani (University of Greenwich, England) for his study on \"The relationship between Market Efficiency, Expected Return and Volatility in the Stock Market\". The paper analyses the expected returns in the securities market, as well as the efficiency of this market. More specifically, the focus of the study paper is the market indices for the S&P 500 in the United States, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) in China, and the S&P Merval in Argentina.\n* Third place: Ms Krista Kozmai (European University of Tirana) on the theme ¨Fear of the Free Exchange Rate - The case of Albania¨. The paper presented discusses the impact that the determining factors of the lek/euro exchange rate, such as exports, imports, FDIs, remittances, interest rates and inflation have had during the period 2008-2022, supported by data. The material also discusses whether the interventions of the Bank of Albania have influenced the performance of the exchange rate, quantified by means of a qualitative variable based on the statements of Bank of Albania. The results from the multiple regression show that the behaviour of the exchange rate is explained by the fundamental factors, where remittances are of high importance, while the other indicators are non-statistically significant and inconsistent to the theory.\n2024\n* First place: Mr. Markelian Blacëri (University of Padova, Italy) for his study on “The Long-Term Shadows of Monetary Policy: Can Policy Shocks Affect the Natural Rate of Unemployment?”. This thesis focuses on assessing the impact of monetary policy on the natural rate of unemployment, by analysing two specific types of shocks: first, the traditional monetary policy shocks, and second, changes in the information regarding the monetary policy stance, also known as the “central bank's forward guidance on future monetary policy”.\n* Second place: Endri Deda (Université Paris Dauphine, France) for his thesis on \"The Effect of Deep Trade Agreements on FDI flows\".\n* Third place: Ms. Eneda Gjoka (Aleksandër Moisiu University) for her thesis on “Use of Learning Machine to forecast inflation in economic trends”.
