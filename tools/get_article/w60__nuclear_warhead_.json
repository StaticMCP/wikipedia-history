In August 1961, the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) was assigned development of the warhead and in November the XW-60 name was assigned to the program.\nIn February 1962 a safety study determined that the warhead had an inherent fire safety risk leading to the development of a fire-protection package for the weapon. This was followed by further fire safety concerns in 1963. The medium range version of the system () was cancelled around this time while the long-range version of the system was reorientated towards a  weapon and relegated to study-only.\nThe warhead was cancelled in December 1963 following the cancellation of the Typhon missile that same month due to cost and system vulnerability.\nIn approximately 1966, the XW60 was briefly considered alongside the W58 warhead for possible use in the AGM-69 SRAM air-to-surface missile. The Los Alamos W69 warhead was ultimately chosen for the system.\nDesign\nThe W60 weighed between , was  long and  in diameter.\nThe warhead yield has been variously described as \"lower than that of the W58\" (which had a yield of ) and \"very low\".\nReferences\n*Hansen, Chuck, \"Swords of Armageddon,\" Sunnyvale, CA, Chucklea Publications, 1995."
