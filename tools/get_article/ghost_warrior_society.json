The leader of the organization is Crystal Semaganis.\nThe Society has gained attention for publicly raising allegations of suspected Indigenous identity fraud against individuals. Semaganis claims they have been threatened with lawsuits over their reporting.\nOn January 23, 2025, the Art Gallery of Hamilton hosted an event on \"Pretendians or Indigenous Fraudsters\" attended by Cameron. In March 2025, Cameron and other activists planned an event on \"Organizational Strategies to Combat Pretendianism\" at the Art Gallery of Hamilton. The event was temporarily suspended following controversy.\nIn May 2025, an academic from Cambrian College went on leave after pretendian claims were brought against them by the society causing the university to investigate.\nIn July 2025 a lawsuit was filed against Cameron for engaging in a \"relentless libelous campaign against the plaintiffs\" resulting in \"significant harms to personal and professional reputations, serious psychological harms, loss of income, loss of academic opportunities and loss of business opportunities\".\nSee also\n*Indigenous identity fraud\n*Pretendian\n*Tribal Alliance Against Frauds\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ghostwarriorsociety.com/ Official website], Ghost Warrior Society"
