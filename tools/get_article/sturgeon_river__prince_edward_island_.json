It flows north, then turns east, passes over a dam, and flows past the community of Milltown Cross and Buffaloland Provincial Park. The river takes in the left tributary West Branch Sturgeon River, turns southeast, takes in the right tributary South Branch Sturgeon River, and reaches its mouth at Sturgeon Bay  northwest of the community of Sturgeon. Sturgeon Bay is part of the larger St. Marys Bay on the Northumberland Strait on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, which leads to the Atlantic Ocean.\nTributaries\n*South Branch Sturgeon River (right)\n*West Branch Sturgeon River (left)\nReferences\n*\n*"
