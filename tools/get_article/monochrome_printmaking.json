While the term may include ordinary printing with only two colors — \"ink\" and \"no ink\" — it usually implies the ability to produce several intermediate colors between those two extremes.\nIn contrast with color printing, monochrome printing needs only a single ink and may require only a single pass of the paper through the printing press.\n.
