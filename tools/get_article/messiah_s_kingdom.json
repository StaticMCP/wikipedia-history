      "text": "# Messiah's Kingdom\n\n'''Messiah's Kingdom''' is a long poem by Agnes Bulmer. It was published in 1833. It is regarded as the longest poem written by a woman. It consists of some 14,000 lines grouped in twelve books. The poem is written in heroic couplet but the introduction is made up of four 13-line stanzas like this one:\n:Of Him, high raised on Heaven's stupendous throne,\n:Beneath whose feet the sapphire pavement glows;\n:O'er whose intensest splendours, dread, unknown,\n:The beaming bow its milder radiance throws;\n:Around whose state, in bright attendance, close\n:The full-toned choir of harping cherubim.\n:Seraphs, whose robes empyreal lights compose,\n:And angels, breathing soft the' adoring hymn:—\n:Of Him, Eternal, Infinite, Supreme,\n:Fain would a mortal Muse, adventurous, sing;\n:Him, for archangel minds too vast a theme,\n:Who yet, when babes their meek hosannas bring,\n:Inclines with gentlest grace, and veils in Mercy's wing.\nThe poet was praised for \"harmonious versification\". The poem was reviewed also in The Methodist Magazine and Quarterly Review.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* [https://archive.org/stream/messiahskingdomp00bulm#page/n5/mode/2up Agnes Bulmer, Messiah's Kingdom, New York 1833.]"
