The first of the twisters touched down in Oakland Park and tracked northeast for almost , moving offshore at Pompano Beach. It produced F3 damage, killed one&nbsp;person, and injured 33&nbsp;others. A second, smaller, and weaker tornado produced F1 damage just  to the north, in Deerfield Beach. Losses from both twisters totaled almost $8&nbsp;million.\nConfirmed tornadoes\nPrior to 1990, there is a likely undercount of tornadoes, particularly E/F0–1, with reports of weaker tornadoes becoming more common as population increased. A sharp increase in the annual average E/F0–1 count by approximately 200 tornadoes was noted upon the implementation of NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in 1990–1991. Most countries only recorded tornadoes that produced severe damage or loss of life. Significant low biases in U.S. tornado counts likely occurred through the early 1990s, when advanced NEXRAD was first installed and the National Weather Service began comprehensively verifying tornado occurrences.}} 1974 marked the first year where significant tornado (E/F2+) counts became homogenous with contemporary values, attributed to the consistent implementation of Fujita scale assessments. Tornado ratings were retroactively applied to events prior to the formal adoption of the F-scale by the National Weather Service. While the Fujita scale has been superseded by the Enhanced Fujita scale in the U.S. since February&nbsp;1, 2007, Canada used the old scale until April&nbsp;1, 2013; nations elsewhere, like the United Kingdom, apply other classifications such as the TORRO scale.}} Numerous discrepancies on the details of tornadoes in this outbreak exist between sources. The total count of tornadoes and ratings differs from various agencies accordingly. The list below documents information from the most contemporary official sources alongside assessments from tornado historian Thomas P. Grazulis.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Color/symbol key\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Color / symbol\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | †\n| Data from Grazulis 1990/1993/2001b\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ¶\n| Data from a local National Weather Service office\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ※\n| Data from the 1980 Storm Data publication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ‡\n| Data from the NCEI database\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ♭\n| Data from newspaper(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ♯\n| Maximum width of tornado\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ±\n| Tornado was rated below F2 intensity by Grazulis but a specific rating is unavailable.\n|-\n|}\nMarch&nbsp;1 event\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Confirmed tornadoes – Saturday, March 1, 1980\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:2%; text-align:center;\"|F#\n! scope=\"col\" text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\" text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\" text-align:center;\"|State\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|Start\n! scope=\"col\" text-align:center;\"|Time (UTC)\n! scope=\"col\" text-align:center;\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\" text-align:center;\"|Width Values provided by Grazulis are the average width, with estimates being rounded down (i.e.  is rounded down from 880 yards to 800 yards.}}\n! scope=\"col\" text-align:center;\"|Damage\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#; border-bottom: 1px solid black\"| F3\n|Southwestern Oakland Park to Pompano Beach\n|Broward\n|FL\n|\n|01:50–?†\n|♭\n|\n|♭\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\" border-bottom: 1px solid black;|1+ death – See section on this tornado – 33 injuries occurred.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#; border-bottom: 1px solid black\"| F1\n|Deerfield Beach※\n|Broward\n|FL\n|\n|02:30–02:45♭\n|‡\n|‡\n|※\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\" border-bottom: 1px solid black;|A brief tornado smashed glass, jalousie windows, and roofing, including a  patio roof-and-screen section; it also tore off tarpaper and awnings.

There it damaged 20&nbsp;or more automobiles and flipped five, one&nbsp;of which it piled atop another. It also extensively damaged 20&nbsp;condo units; flying glass flayed several residents, resulting in severe injuries. Hitting Easterlin Park, it downed trees, lofted tents, and upended campers, injuring four&nbsp;people. Officials said the park was \"leveled\" and that tree damage would \"take years\" to repair, the Fort Lauderdale News stated. The twister then overturned an 18-wheeler on 44th Street, near Commercial Boulevard. Crossing I-95, it was described as a \"triangular black funnel with blue lights around it\". It then impacted an elementary school, wrecking a portable classroom. Near Andrews Avenue and Prospect Road it flipped a few other large trucks, while tipping a nearby car onto its side, stranding people inside. At Oakland Pines Apartments it broke windows, felled trees, and unroofed buildings, turning the complex into a \"battlefield\", according to a denizen. A transformer was blown away and deemed missing. One&nbsp;person commented that she \"saw the traffic lights flying off the wires and power lines flying in every direction\".\n**[https://www.newspapers.com/article/fort-lauderdale-news/177341267/ P. 16A] }}\nIn Pompano Beach the twister blew out windows in an art gallery, badly damaged a furniture store, unroofed a warehouse, hit the Sun Sentinel offices, and injured 10&nbsp;restauranteurs. It knocked down fencing and gates at a cemetery; tore out walls at the Island Club; and entangled an  fishing boat in power lines,  above ground. It then hit oceanside condos, doing most of its damage. An elderly woman fell six&nbsp;stories to her death, and a few other deaths were rumored. The tornado then moved over the Atlantic Ocean, having injured 33&nbsp;people, most of them slightly. It or related events may have hit northern Fort Lauderdale, just south of Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport; Coconut Creek; or near Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport. Multiple funnel clouds were sighted in Coconut Creek and elsewhere along the path. The tornado was the most damaging to hit South Florida since 1953, unroofing numerous apartments and other buildings; it also damaged many businesses. About 300&nbsp;to 400&nbsp;buildings were affected, but homes were not completely destroyed. After the storm 200&nbsp;public workers in Pompano Beach were mustered for cleanup, as were 80&nbsp;in Oakland Park. As of 2024, the tornado is one&nbsp;of just three official E/F3s on record in South Florida. Ratings were retroactively applied to events prior to the formal adoption of the F-scale by the National Weather Service. While official ratings extended back to 1950, tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis rated older events.}}\nOther effects\nWinds toppled trees in Wilton Manors, and peaked at  in Monroe County.\nSee also\n* List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks\n* Tornado outbreak of February 23, 1965 – Also spawned an F3 tornado near Fort Lauderdale\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*}}\n*\n*\n*}}\n*\n**\n**\n**\n**\n* |author1=National Weather Service |date=March 1980 |title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena |journal=Storm Data |volume=22 |issue=3 |publisher=National Climatic Data Center |location=Asheville, North Carolina|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/sd/sd.html}}\n*|author=National Weather Service|date=March 1980 |title=Storm Data Publication|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|via=Storm Events Database|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/}}"
