The monarch's prerogative power to dissolve Parliament was revived by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, which also repealed the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. By virtue of amendments made by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act to Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983, the dissolution of Parliament automatically triggers a general election.\nThe last dissolution of Parliament occurred on 30 May 2024, following the announcement that the 2024 general election would be held on 4 July.\nMechanism\nParliament is dissolved by the King on the Prime Minister's request. After agreeing to the request the King will authorise a proclamation at a Privy Council meeting, which he will then order to be issued under the Great Seal of the Realm.\nAs soon as Parliament is dissolved, members of Parliament cease to hold office, and they may not enter the Palace of Westminster, although they and their staff continue to be paid until polling day. Ministers retain their positions until the election, but government activity is limited to prevent public funds being used to support the incumbent government's electoral campaign. Parliament is usually prorogued or adjourned before it is dissolved. Parliament may continue to sit for a wash-up period of a few days after the Prime Minister has announced the date when Parliament will be dissolved, to finish some last items of parliamentary business. Business left unresolved after this period will not be entered into law.\nAfter Parliament has dissolved, a royal proclamation is made summoning a new Parliament, fixing the date when the new Parliament is to assemble, and requiring the issuing of writs of summons to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and writs of election for the members of the House of Commons. If Parliament is dissolved by proclamation, the proclamation dissolving it will usually also summon the next one. While it is the royal proclamation, and subsequent Order in Council, which direct the issue of writs of election, the amended parliamentary election rules direct that a writ is to be deemed to have been received the day after Parliament has been dissolved and that therefore, the general election process can begin before the writ is received by returning officers. The poll for the general election is held 25 working days (a day which is not a weekend, bank holiday or a day of national mourning or thanksgiving) after Parliament is dissolved. By tradition, a copy of the royal proclamation is delivered by hand from the Privy Council Office to Mansion House in the City of London. The proclamation is then read out on the steps of the Royal Exchange by the Common Cryer and Serjeant-At-Arms of the City. Similar reading also takes place on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. This tradition was again carried out in May 2024.\n| source = Proclamation for the dissolution of Parliament made on 30 May 2024\n| align = none\n}}\nHistory\nPrior to the Triennial Acts, Parliaments of England could be summoned and dissolved at the Sovereign's discretion. The Acts mandated that gaps between parliaments must not exceed three years, but did not originally put in provisions for mandated dissolution, leading to the Long Parliament which was formed in 1640 and was not dissolved until 1660, and the Cavalier Parliament which sat continuously for 18 years. The 1694 Act set the maximum duration to three years, with mandatory general elections between each. This legislation was carried forward into the Parliament of Great Britain following the ratification of the Acts of Union 1707.\nThe Septennial Act 1715 increased the maximum length of a parliament to seven years, after which time it would automatically expire. This was later amended by the Parliament Act 1911, reducing the maximum term to five years. This could, however, be overridden at the pleasure of Parliament. The length of a Parliament has been extended on two occasions since 1911, once during each of the two World Wars. At any time the Sovereign could dissolve Parliament and call a general election. In accordance with constitutional convention, the Sovereign did not act independently, but at the request of the Prime Minister. Constitutional experts held that the monarch might refuse permission under the Lascelles Principles if a Parliament had more than a year still to run and if another person could potentially command a majority in the House of Commons. In practice, this meant that a Prime Minister with a Commons majority and the support of his party had de facto authority to dissolve Parliament at a time of his choosing. Prior to 1918, it was the Cabinet who collectively sought permission from the monarch in order for Parliament to be dissolved. However, since 1918, the Prime Minister alone sought the permission of the Sovereign.\nSummary of historical term lengths of the Parliament of the United Kingdom\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, general elections were to be held at fixed intervals and Parliament was to be dissolved 17, later 25, working days before the polling day for the next general election. The date for the next general election could be brought forward if the House of Commons passed a motion of no confidence in the Government or passed a motion for an early general election with a two-thirds majority. The Act did not affect the Sovereign's power to prorogue Parliament.\nUnder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, writs of election were issued to the returning officers of each constituency automatically by virtue of section 3(3) of the Act. This was due to the fact that the royal proclamation no longer summoned the holding of the election, but only the meeting of the new Parliament.\nParliament was dissolved automatically due to the expiration of its term for the first time on 30 March 2015, as opposed to being dissolved by royal proclamation. Although Prime Minister David Cameron met the Queen on the day of the dissolution, the only business discussed was the calling of the new Parliament, and not a request for a dissolution, as had happened at every such meeting historically, and the subsequent royal proclamation made on 30 March simply called for the holding of the next Parliament. At the 2015 general election, the period between the dissolution of the previous Parliament and the meeting of the new Parliament was the longest period the United Kingdom had been without a Parliament since 1924.\nThe 2017 general election was called by virtue of a motion for an early general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The motion was passed in the House of Commons with a vote of 522 to 13.\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019, Parliament was dissolved without passing the motion cited under the provisions of section 2(2) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which was then the default mechanism for dissolving Parliament prior to the expiration of its term. The 2019 Act fixed the polling day for the next general election as 12 December 2019, as if it had under section 2(7) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. This caused Parliament to be dissolved by virtue of section 3(1) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act on 6 November.\nDissolution and Calling of Parliament Act\nIn December 2020, the Conservative government published a draft Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill, later retitled the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill when it was introduced to the House of Commons in May 2021, which would repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in its entirety, restore the monarch's prerogative powers to dissolve Parliament at the prime minister's request, and ensure that a parliamentary term automatically ends five years after a Parliament's first meeting, with the polling day being held 25 working days later. The bill was given royal assent on 24 March 2022. The first dissolution of Parliament under this bill occurred on 30 May 2024, following its prorogation six days earlier.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/genelec2010faq/ Frequently Asked Questions: General Election]\n* [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2009/RP09-044.pdf Election Timetables], House of Commons Library Research Paper 09/44, 13 May 2009\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100417025233/http://news.parliament.uk/2010/04/dissolution-of-parliament-12-april-2010/ Dissolution of Parliament 2010]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/my_playlists?p=5FEC6D5B784B24E5 Prorogation of the 54th Parliament of the United Kingdom] video on YouTube."
