It was designed to look worn down and like the former Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong, with the design handled by now-defunct Japanese design company Hoshino-Gumi, with props imported directly from Hong Kong. It was described as being a \"gloriously authentic-looking cyberpunk dystopia\". Its location was a ten-minute walk from Kawasaki Station.\nThe facility featured retro games in addition to modern ones, and was also a common locale for both amateur and professional photo and video shoots, such as music videos for idol groups Keyakizaka46 (\"Gomen ne Christmas\") and Yumemiru Adolescence (\"20xx\").\nThe facility closed on 17 November 2019.\nSee also\n* Wenheyou\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n* ... in Japan |work=South China Morning Post |date=1 October 2013 |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1321559/arcade-brings-kowloon-walled-city-back-dead-japan |language=en |accessdate=15 November 2019 }}\nExternal links\n*[https://www.warehousenet.jp/ Anata no Warehouse official website]"
