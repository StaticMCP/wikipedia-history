It was a loose knit group of grass roots activists adopting the PGA hallmarks.\nProtests it organised included the Halloween 2002 anti-war protest in London, and the Old Street Roundabout protest that occurred the day after the War in Iraq started.\nSee also\n* Protests against the Iraq War\nNotes\nReferences\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2378843.stm Anti-war protests under way], BBC news, Thursday, 31 October, 2002\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070103113546/http://www.wombles.org.uk/article20060334.php Disobedients' Callout]\n* [http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2003/09/277888.html Don't Attack Iraq Actions Across Country], Indymedia report\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060928003547/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/doa.asp StWC reports on the day]\n* Stop the War: the story of Britain's biggest mass movement, Andrew Murray and Lindsey German,"
