It was opened on 1 August 1845 with the section of Rhine Valley Railway between Offenburg and Freiburg and lies a few kilometres west of the town's centre.\nName\nThe station is on the boundaries of Dinglingen, which was a separate municipality until 1933. Until the incorporation of Dinglingen into Lahr, the station was called Dinglingen. After its incorporation, Deutsche Reichsbahn called the station Lahr-Dinglingen. After the former Lahr Stadt (Lahr town) station lost its passenger services in 1959, Deutsche Bundesbahn gave the station its present name in 1962.\nHistory\nFrom 1865, there was a short branch line to Lahr Stadt. In 1959, Deutsche Bundesbahn ended passenger services on the line and in 1995 it also ended freight services.\nFrom 1894 to 1959, there was also a transfer track to the metre gauge railway of the Central Baden Railways (Mittelbadischen Eisenbahnen), which had a level crossing over the Rhine Valley Railway until 1910, when the crossing was replaced by a bridge. There was a station on the metre-gauge line to the east of the bridge, about 250&nbsp;m from the standard gauge station, which allowed the interchange of passengers.\nRail services\nThe station is served by Regionalbahn and Regional-Express services and has had an Intercity service daily each way between Basel and Munich since 16 December 2013 and a TGV service daily each way between Freiburg and Paris since 9 December 2018.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Rail services in the 2024 timetable\n!
