The railway was operated using a variety of different preserved rolling stock.\nThe EHR had planned to eventually operate the line into Cortonwood, with a new halt at Hemingfield, doubling the length of the line to .\nHistory\nThe line was built to serve Earl Fitzwilliam's collieries and ironworks, which he leased out to local ironmasters. It opened in 1850 as part of the South Yorkshire Railway, known as the Elsecar Branch. Following assorted mergers the line finally became part of the LNER upon formation of the Big Four.\nThe whole infrastructure was nationalised after the Second World War, with the mines becoming part of the National Coal Board in 1947 and the railway becoming part of British Railways in 1948.\nThe Elsecar branch closed in 1984 following closure of the final colliery on the line.\nRestoration began in 1994 as a project of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, and the line reopened as a heritage railway in 1996, operated by the Council. The Elsecar Heritage Railway became the operator in 2006.\nClosure\nElsecar Heritage Railway was mothballed indefinitely when its operators surrendered their lease in November 2020, it was reported at the time that a commitment was made by Barnsley Council to reopen the site.\nIn November 2023 Barnsley Council and Historic England announced plans to re-open the site with a track engineering college with places for 400 students each year and employment for 40 staff. The £25&nbsp;million plan has been allocated some funding from the Cultural Development Fund though the plans are not expected to happen straight away. Other ideas for developing the site include a restaurant, a cycle hire centre, an outdoor performance area, and public spaces.\nMotive power\n'']]\nSteam locomotives\nThe railway's collection of steam locomotives were used regularly for passenger services.\n* Sentinel  No. 6807 Gervase. (Running number 10) (Operational, returned to steam in 2013).\n* Sentinel  No. 9376 (unnamed). (Running number 7) (Scrapped).\n* Sentinel  No. 9599 William. (Operational, returned to steam in 2017).\n* Peckett OQ Class  No. 2150 Mardy Monster. (Undergoing overhaul).\n* Avonside  No. 1917 Earl Fitzwilliam, formerly Pitsford. (Stored).\n* Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns  No. 7386 Birkenhead. (Undergoing overhaul).\nDiesel locomotives\nThe railway's diesel locomotives were used to operate both passenger and engineering trains.\n* Hunslet Engine Co.  No. 6950 Louise. (Operational.)\n* Yorkshire Engine Company  No. 2895 Earl of Strafford. (Operational.)\n* Sentinel  Elizabeth. (Operational.)\nOther motive power\n* Wickham trolley track inspection vehicle. (In storage, awaiting restoration.)\nCoaching stock\nCoaching stock was painted in British Railways 'lined maroon' livery.\n* BR Mk 1 TSO No. 3958. (In service.)\n* BR Mk 1 TSO No. 4903. (In service.)\n* BR Mk 1 BSK No. 35305. (In service.)\n* BR Mk 1 SK No. 25562. (In service.)\nStations\n* Rockingham – Terminus and headquarters, serving the Elsecar Heritage Centre.\n* Hemingfield – current temporary terminus, with groundworks complete for proposed new intermediate station.\n* Cortonwood – planned new terminus station on the railway's Cortonwood extension.\nCortonwood extension\nThe railway's extension, currently under construction, involves the reinstatement of two level crossings, Tingle Bridge Lane and Smithy Lane. The latter, being a quiet road, will be protected by manually operated crossing gates of traditional design. Tingle Bridge Lane is a busier road, and the railway is constructing a semi-automated crossing barrier system, with barriers manually lowered from a signal box, but automatically raised by track circuitry. On 16 May 2011 the permanent way materials for the level crossing arrived and a donation scheme was set up to raise the remainder of the money needed. Funds raised through this scheme have since been used to purchase barriers and traffic signals for the crossing ready for building. In August 2012 trial holes were dug to locate services under the road surface ready for construction of the crossing to take place.\nOn 21 June 2012 the ground was cleared and levelled for ballast and track alterations in anticipation of constructing the station at Hemingfield, currently the end of the line.\nOn 19 April 2013 the EHR built the level crossing on Tingle Bridge Lane, financed by a Director's loan, and began extending the line into Cortonwood Colliery, as the next step of the Project.\nBy June 2014 the whole track had been laid up to Cortonwood, with minor levelling and ballasting remaining to become operational. The railway is now engaged in refinements to the permanent way, together with the necessary regulatory processes (with the local authority and the Office of Rail and Road) to see the extension opened for public services.\nCortonwood memorial\nIn November 2013 the EHR received a lottery grant of £50,000 to finance the provision of a Coal Mining Memorial Park at Cortonwood Colliery, a nationally important site, where the 1984/5 Miners Strike began. The project was completed in November 2014.\nSee also\n* Earl Fitzwilliam's private railway\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.elsecarrailway.co.uk Elsecar Railway Website]"
