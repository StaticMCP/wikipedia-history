He began playing hockey at age 10 and was taught by a former Harvard University player who emphasized lower body strength and using deceptive motions using his shoulders and eyes. At age 14 he began playing the sport of polo as well, though he considered it secondary to hockey at the time. While playing hockey at Pawling Preparatory, he was offered a professional contract from Lester Patrick, manager of the National Hockey League's (NHL) New York Rangers. He declined the offer as he had no interest in playing professional sports.\nIn 1928 Iglehart began playing with the varsity team at Yale University.

However, he was able to represent the United States the following year at the World Ice Hockey Championships. At the tournament he played right wing and center in addition to defense as Team USA won the gold medal. Following the World Championship tournament Iglehart played in the Eastern Hockey League (EHL) for the New York Rovers. He was considered one of the top amateur players during his time with the Rovers. At this time the Rovers were the farm team for the Rangers. In 1936 he was selected to represent America at the 1936 Winter Olympics, but was again unable to participate due to other responsibilities. He stopped playing hockey that same year in order to concentrate on playing polo.\nIglehart became an accomplished polo player earning a 10-goal rating, winning five Open Championships, and two Indoor Polo Open Championships. He represented The United States internationally on four occasions. In 1936 he was part of a group that attempted to purchase the NHL's New York Americans.
