He outperformed Democratic presidential nominee and former Delaware Senator Joe Biden (whose seat Coons was elected to in a 2010 special election) by 0.7 percentage points, compared to the concurrent presidential election. Coons also won Kent County, a swing county, for the first time in his senatorial career.\nDemocratic primary\nCandidates\nNominee\n* Chris Coons, incumbent U.S. senator\nEliminated in primary\n* Jessica Scarane, technology executive\nWithdrawn\n*Scott Walker, Republican nominee for  in 2018 (running for governor as a Republican)\nDeclined\n* Kerri Evelyn Harris, former candidate for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2018\n* Lisa Blunt Rochester, incumbent U.S. representative for Delaware's at-large congressional district (running for re-election)\nEndorsements\nState executives\n* Jack Markell, Governor of Delaware (2009-2017), Treasurer of Delaware (1999-2009)\nState legislators\n* Margaret Rose Henry, Member of the Delaware Senate from the 2nd District (1994-2019), Majority Leader of the Delaware Senate (2017-2019)\n* Sean Lynn, Member of the Delaware House of Representatives from the 31st district (2014-present)\n* Nicole Poore, Majority Leader of the Delaware Senate (2009-present), Member of the Delaware Senate from the district 12 (2013-present)\nIndividuals\n* Sarah McBride, LGBTQ rights activist, National Press Secretary of the Human Rights Campaign and candidate for the Delaware State Senate\nOrganizations\n* 314 Action\n* American Bankers Association\n* Brady Campaign\n* Council for a Livable World\n* Delaware AFL-CIO\n* Delaware Bankers Association\n* Delaware Building and Construction Trades\n* Delaware Stonewall PAC\n* Democratic Majority for Israel\n* End Citizens United\n* Everytown for Gun Safety\n* Giffords\n* Human Rights Campaign\n* Humane Society of the United States Legislative Fund\n* Jewish Democratic Council of America\n* Joint Action Committee for Political Affairs\n* League of Conservation Voters\n* Moms Demand Action\n* NARAL Pro-Choice America\n* Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund\n* Planned Parenthood\n* Pro-Israel America\n* Sierra Club\n}}\nOrganizations\n*Brand New Congress\n*Democratic Socialists of America\n*Sunrise Movement - Newark Hub\nPolitical parties\n*Working Families Party\n}}\nPolling\nwith Lisa Blunt Rochester and Chris Coons\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The choice of Lauren Witzke, a controversial extremist and believer of QAnon, as the nominee, only cemented this prediction. Networks declared Coons the winner as soon as voting ended, based on exit polling alone. Coons also outperformed Biden (who also once held this Senate seat) in terms of percentage, but underperformed in terms of raw vote, likely due to the lack of third-party Senate candidates.\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n| align=left | The Cook Political Report\n|\n|October 29, 2020\n|-\n| align=left | Inside Elections\n|\n|October 28, 2020\n|-\n| align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n| November 2, 2020\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Daily Kos\n|\n| October 30, 2020\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Politico\n|\n|November 2, 2020\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RCP\n|\n|October 23, 2020\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |DDHQ\n|\n|November 3, 2020\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |538\n|\n|November 2, 2020\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Economist\n|\n|November 2, 2020\n|}\nGeneral election endorsements\nOrganizations\n* Delaware State Education Association\n* National Education Association\n}}\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
