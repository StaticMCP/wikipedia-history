The Kingdom of Kandy was the only independent Sinhalese kingdom to survive. The period was characterised by the fragmentation of the Sinhalese polity, intervention of foreign forces and constant military conflict.\nOverview\nPeriodization of Sri Lanka history:\nSee also\n* Crisis of the Third Century – a similar period in Roman history\n* Sengoku period – a similar period in Japanese history\n* Warring States period – a similar period in Chinese history\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*"
