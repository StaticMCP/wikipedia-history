In sixty meetings that season, Warren was unbeaten by an opponent in twenty five of them and averaged almost eleven points a match. In the May 1948, just two months after arriving in the UK for a trial with Birmingham, Warren was selected to ride for Australia. By 1949 he was the captain of his country. In 1949, despite being in a tougher division he still scored almost ten points a meeting and he qualified for his first World Final.\nIn 1949, he finished third in the Australian Championship and finished second a year later in 1950. Also in 1950, Warren qualified and finished in third place during the 1950 Individual Speedway World Championship. In early 1951, a severe accident at a meeting in New Zealand left Warren with a triple skull fracture and his career was never to hit the heights of 1950 again.\nWorld final appearances\n* 1949 -  London, Wembley Stadium - 12th - 5pts\n* 1950 -  London, Wembley Stadium - 3rd - 12pts\n* 1952 -  London, Wembley Stadium - 13th - 5pts\n* 1953 -  London, Wembley Stadium - 12th - 5pts\nReferences"
