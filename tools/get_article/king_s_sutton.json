It is sited about  south-east of Banbury, Oxfordshire. The parish includes the hamlets of Astrop, contiguous with eastern end of King's Sutton, and Upper Astrop, about  north-east, in the same area as the shrunken villages of Great and Little Purston.\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe village toponym means the King's south estate.\nBlacklands,  north of the village, is the site of a Roman town. Coins from the 4th century AD have been recovered from the site.\nThe infant Saint Rumwold (or Rumwald, Rumbold or Rumbald) is said to have lived and died at King's Sutton in 662. Rumwold is said to have lived for only three days, but professed his faith throughout.\nThe English Civil War\nThe English Civil War helped develop Banbury’s then arms industry. The Royalist garrison was constantly at work early in 1645 digging saltpetre in King's Sutton and making gunpowder out of it in a house specially built near Banbury. Just over ten years earlier, a government saltpetreman had operated at Banbury for a year, having moved there from the then small market town of Coventry, before moving on to Hook Norton a short while afterwards. King's Sutton was a local centre for saltpetre excavation and digging at the time.\nNotable buildings\nThe Court House was built in about 1500, partly of stone and partly timber-framed. It was altered in the 16th and 18th centuries.\nThe manor house was built in the middle of the 17th century.\nParish church\nThe oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saints Peter and Paul are the Norman font and largely Norman chancel. The north aisle was added in the 13th century and the south aisle early in the 14th century. The bell tower and most of the windows are Decorated Gothic. The spire was added to the tower, probably late in the 14th century, raising the steeple to a height of . Sir Nikolaus Pevsner considered it \"one of the finest, if not the finest, spire in this county of spires\". The south porch, north aisle, west window and very fine east window of the chancel are Perpendicular Gothic.\nSs. Peter & Paul parish is now part of a single Church of England benefice with the adjacent parish of Newbottle and Charlton.\nAstrop House\nAstrop house is a Grade II* listed country manor about  north-east of the village. It is constructed of limestone ashlar in two storeys, with a 7-bay frontage\nIt was built c.1740 for Sir John Willes, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Sir John Soane added wings for the Revd. William Shippen Willes, which were extended in the 19th century and demolished in 1961. William Wilkinson added the Keeper's lodge, pheasantry and a cottage in 1868. Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown laid out the grounds.\nAstrop was the site of a famous Spa discovered in the 17th century. All that now remains is a small well, known as St. Rumbald's Well, south of the house in a valley.\nGovernance\nThe village has a parish council with 15 members.\nTransport\nKing's Sutton railway station is served by two train operating companies:\n* Chiltern Railways operates regular services between  and , via\n* Great Western Railway runs services to  and .\nAmenities\noutside the village]]\nKings Sutton Primary School is in Richmond Street.
