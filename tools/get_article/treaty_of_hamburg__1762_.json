      "text": "# Treaty of Hamburg (1762)\n\nThe Treaty of Hamburg was signed on 22 May 1762 in Hamburg between Sweden and Prussia during the Pomeranian War, a theater of the Seven Years' War.\nThe treaty came into being after Russia had allied to Prussia on 5 May, making it impossible for Sweden to continue the war which they had entered to regain territories in Pomerania, which they had previously lost. The treaty reaffirmed the pre-war status quo.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Hamburg (1638)\n* List of treaties\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ieg-friedensvertraege.de/treaty/1762%20V%2022%20Friedensvertrag%20von%20Hamburg/t-57-1-de.html?h=1 Scan of the treaty at IEG Mainz]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060312121557/http://www.bartleby.com/67/665.html The Encyclopedia of World History (2001)]"
