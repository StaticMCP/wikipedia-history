He was killed in a motorcycle racing crash in 2013.\nWarner was born in Little Falls, New York. He studied marine biology and chemistry at the University of Tampa. Warner was a tropical fish farmer in Wimauma, Florida. On July 17, 2011, riding a highly modified turbocharged Suzuki Hayabusa, Warner set a new world motorcycle land speed record of  from a standing start to  at the Loring Timing Associations Land Speed Race, at the Loring Commerce Centre (the former Loring Air Force Base) in Limestone, Maine.\nBill Warner began land speed racing his unfaired, normally aspirated  Yamaha V-max in March 2007, with a run in Maxton, North Carolina, which placed him in the East Coast Timing Association (ECTA) Maxton 200&nbsp;MPH Club. He purchased an unfaired turbo Suzuki Hayabusa in 2008, and quickly set the fastest unfaired motorcycle records in land speed racing, eventually reaching  in 2010 at the Texas Mile. The same year, Warner built, with the consultation of Bonneville motorcycle racer Larry Forstall, a set of Modified-class fiberglass fairings for his Hayabusa. With this bodywork, plus sponsorship and managerial support from Walt Kudron, he set the Maxton track record on the standing mile at the ECTA meet in May 2010, going . In addition to the Maxton track record, Warner holds track records at the Texas Mile at Goliad, Texas (), Loring (311&nbsp;mph) and California's Mojave Air and Space Port () land speed sanctions.\nAfter going 278&nbsp;mph in a mile on a Modified-class land speed motorcycle, Warner began building a new, Altered-class chassis, engine, and bodywork in order to attempt to break the  barrier on a conventional (rider-exposed) motorcycle. This undertaking was supported by many industry and personal sponsors, and absorbed all of Warner's time and energy. After breaking 300 on his first attempt in 2011, running  on a 1.5 mile track, Warner sought to break 300&nbsp;mph in a single mile, after which he planned to retire from ultimate land speed racing, auction his racing motorcycle, and manage his own standing-mile land speed event in Houston, Texas.\nOn July 14, 2013, while attempting to break 300&nbsp;mph in a single mile at the Loring Timing Association land speed meet, Warner lost control of his motorcycle at . His motorcycle veered off the course and struck a 6\" concrete landing light pedestal and he was thrown a great distance. Warner was conscious after the crash, but he was pronounced dead at Cary Medical Center in Caribou, Maine. He had achieved  in a mile at the event in less than optimal conditions. The cause of the accident is unclear, but investigators suspected mechanical or tire failure. He was survived by his parents, brother, and sister.\nReferences"
