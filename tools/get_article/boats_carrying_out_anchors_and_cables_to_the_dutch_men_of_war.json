Turner. A historical seascape depicts a scene from 1665. It has been suggested that Turner may have been warning about the danger of Napoleonic France repeating the Dutch attack on the Royal Navy fleet during the Raid on the Medway in the Anglo-Dutch War.\nThe painting was displayed at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1804 held at Somerset House in London. It was acquired by the banker and art collector Samuel Dobrée, and in 1827 along with the Iveagh Sea Piece it was bought by Lord Delamere.Bryant p 406 today it is in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, having been acquired from the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 2014.\nSee also\n* List of paintings by J.
