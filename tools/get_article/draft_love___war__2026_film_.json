The film stars Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Vicky Kaushal in lead roles with Muzammil Ibrahim in a pivotal role, who will mark his acting comeback. It is scheduled to release on 14 August 2026, on the occasion of Naga Panchami and Indian Independence Day weekend.\nThe film was officially announced in January 2024. Principal photography began on November 7, 2024, in Mumbai. The final 20-day schedule, including the climax, is expected to be filmed in Italy by December 2025. The film's soundtrack album is being composed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Initially scheduled for a Christmas 2025 release, the release date was pushed to 20th March, 2026 until postponed again to 14th August, 2026.\nCast\n*Ranbir Kapoor\n*Alia Bhatt\n*Vicky Kaushal\n*Muzammil Ibrahim\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn October 2024, it was announced that Sanjay Leela Bhansali would write, direct and produce his next venture under his own banner Bhansali Productions; the project would tentatively be titled Love & War. In the same month, reports revealed that actors Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal had been approached and were in advanced talks to play key roles.\nBy the end of October 2024 the team confirmed that principal photography would commence on 7 November 2024 in Mumbai, with the set construction already underway at major studio facilities.\nIn August 2025 it was reported that a 15-day schedule would be shot in a British-era army base in the town of Mhow, Madhya Pradesh — the setting was chosen to reflect a pre-Independence era war backdrop integral to the film’s narrative. Around the same time, Bhansali revealed that more than half the film’s shoot had been completed and that the next phase would include a dramatic face-off between the two male leads.\nDuring the pre-production period, both Ranbir Kapoor and Vicky Kaushal underwent significant physical transformations for their roles — Kapoor reportedly lost approximately 12 kg and Kaushal around 15 kg to meet the demands of their characters.\nMeanwhile, Bhansali reportedly re-imagined studio interiors in Mumbai to evoke a 1970s European war-era aesthetic, using sprawling sets that doubled for Italian military barracks.\nThe official release date was locked for an August 2026 theatrical launch, timed to coincide with India’s Independence Day holiday weekend, underlining the film’s scale and patriotic underpinnings.\nRecent casting whispers suggest that actor Muzammil Ibrahim has been approached for a supporting role, though no final confirmation has been made yet.\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began in Mumbai on 7 November 2024. The team completed approximately 125 days of shooting in Mumbai before moving to a major international schedule in Italy (Sicily) in the second half of October 2025, where the climax and a song featuring the lead trio were filmed. Prior to the Italy leg, the production undertook a 15-day schedule in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, at a British-era army base to capture period-war sequences. The shoot is projected to wrap by end of 2025 or early January 2026."
