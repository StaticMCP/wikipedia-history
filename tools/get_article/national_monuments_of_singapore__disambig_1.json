National monuments also visible are the Fullerton Building, Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall, the Former Supreme Court and the Former City Hall.]]The National Monuments of Singapore, , }} are sites, buildings and structures in Singapore that have been designated by the National Heritage Board (NHB) as possessing exceptional historic, traditional, archaeological, architectural or artistic merit. These monuments are legally protected from demolition due to their cultural and historical significance, including associations with pivotal events such as the Second World War, the independence of Singapore and the nation's early development. The Preservation of Monuments Act empowers the NHB to oversee the preservation of these landmarks and encourages research as well as public engagement with Singapore's architectural heritage.\nThe framework for designating national monuments was established under the Preservation of Monuments Act, enacted in December 1970. The act provided for the identification and legal protection of culturally significant sites, leading to the formation of the Preservation of Monuments Board (PMB) in April 1972. This body was tasked with enforcing the act amidst growing concern over the loss of heritage buildings due to rapid urban redevelopment. By mid-1973, forty sites were shortlisted for preservation and public suggestions were invited to expand the list. The initial batch of eight designated landmarks included the Thong Chai Medical Institution, Armenian Church, St Andrew's Cathedral, Telok Ayer Market, Thian Hock Keng Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple, Fatimah Mosque and the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd. In 2021, amendments were proposed to expand the act's definition to include open spaces, inland waters and any land area associated with human activity, both past and present.\nThe NHB, a statutory board under the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth within the Government of Singapore, is responsible for gazetting and maintaining national monuments. As of date, 82 structures have been gazetted of which 75 are formally recognised as national monuments. These include religious sites, civic buildings, marketplaces and other culturally significant landmarks across the island. The most recent addition to the list is the Padang, officially gazetted on National Day in 2022. A comprehensive and regularly updated list of these monuments is accessible via the NHB's heritage portal.\nList of national monuments\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable static-row-numbers sticky-header col1left\"\n|-\n!
