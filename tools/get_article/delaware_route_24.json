The route runs from Maryland Route&nbsp;348 (MD&nbsp;348) at the Maryland border east of Sharptown, Maryland, east to an intersection with DE&nbsp;1 in Midway, between Lewes and Rehoboth Beach. Along the way, DE&nbsp;24 passes through Laurel, Millsboro, and Long Neck. DE&nbsp;24 intersects U.S. Route&nbsp;13 (US&nbsp;13) in Laurel, US&nbsp;113/DE&nbsp;20 and DE&nbsp;30 in Millsboro, and DE&nbsp;5 and DE&nbsp;23 in Long Neck. DE&nbsp;24 features an alternate route, DE&nbsp;24 Alternate (DE&nbsp;24 Alt.), that runs to the north of the route from US&nbsp;113 in Stockley to DE&nbsp;24 near Midway. DE&nbsp;24 was built as a state highway throughout the 1920s, with completion of the entire route by 1931. DE&nbsp;24 was assigned onto its current alignment by 1936. DE&nbsp;24 Alt. was designated by 2006.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;24 begins at the Maryland border, where the road continues west into that state as MD&nbsp;348. From the state line the route heads east on two-lane undivided Sharptown Road. The road heads through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, crossing Cod Creek before curving to the northeast and crossing Tussocky Branch. DE&nbsp;24 runs to the south of Laurel Airport and passes homes, crossing Little Creek to the north of Horseys Pond before it enters the town of Laurel. At this point, the route turns north onto West Street and runs through residential areas. DE&nbsp;24 curves east and becomes West Market Street, crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade as it continues into the downtown area of Laurel. At the Central Avenue junction, the route becomes East Market Street and runs southeast, bending east onto East 4th Street and heading through areas of homes to the south of Records Pond. At the eastern edge of Laurel, DE&nbsp;24 comes to an intersection with US&nbsp;13.\nPast Laurel, DE&nbsp;24 heads east on Laurel Road through farmland with some woodland and homes, crossing James Branch. The route then passes to the north of Trap Pond State Park, with Trap Pond Road heading south to provide access to the state park. The road continues east through a mix of farms and woods with occasional residences, reaching an intersection with Millsboro Highway in Mission. Here, DE&nbsp;24 turns north onto Millsboro Highway, with the road running northeast. Farther along, residential development increases as the road crosses into the town of Millsboro. At this point the road name becomes Laurel Road as it passes homes and reaches an intersection with US&nbsp;113/DE&nbsp;20. Past this intersection, DE&nbsp;24 turns north-northeast on Washington Street. The two routes split into a one-way pair that heads north, following Main Street eastbound and Washington Street westbound. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line at-grade. The one-way pair heads through the downtown area of Millsboro, rejoining along two-way Main Street and crossing Indian River to the east of Millsboro Pond. A short distance later, the route comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of DE&nbsp;30.\nPast the DE&nbsp;30 intersection, DE&nbsp;24 heads northeast on John J. Williams Highway, soon curving to the east. The road runs through farmland with some woods and homes, passing through a Mountaire Farms chicken plant and briefly gaining a center left-turn lane. The route continues through rural areas as a two-lane road and crosses Swan Creek and Warwick Gut, bending to the northeast and passing northwest of the Nanticoke Indian Museum before coming to an intersection with DE&nbsp;5 northwest of Oak Orchard. At this point DE&nbsp;5 turns northeast to form a concurrency with DE&nbsp;24. The road heads north through residential and commercial development with some fields as it enters the Long Neck area, where it intersects DE&nbsp;23. Here, DE&nbsp;5 splits from DE&nbsp;24 by turning northwest onto DE&nbsp;23, and DE&nbsp;24 continues north through a mix of farms, woods, and residential neighborhoods, crossing Guinea Creek and passing the Baywood Greens golf course. The road runs through Angola and passes east of Burton Pond before it curves to the northeast, crossing Love Creek on the Eugene D. Bookhammer Bridge. The route continues northeast, widening to four lanes at the Mulberry Knoll Road intersection, and intersects DE&nbsp;1D/DE&nbsp;24 Alt. Here, DE&nbsp;1D turns northeast to join DE&nbsp;24 and the two routes pass homes and businesses as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. DE&nbsp;24/DE&nbsp;1D becomes a four-lane undivided road and then a divided highway as it comes to its end at an intersection with DE 1 in Midway, located between the cities of Lewes and Rehoboth Beach.\nThe section of DE&nbsp;24 east of US&nbsp;113 serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the Oak Orchard and Long Neck areas to points inland while the section of DE&nbsp;24 between US&nbsp;13 and Millsboro Highway serves as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from the coastal areas. The portions of the route between Townsend Street and Delaware Avenue in Laurel and Christ Church Road and Trap Pond Road east of Laurel are designated as part of the Nanticoke Heritage Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE&nbsp;24 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 34,023&nbsp;vehicles at the DE&nbsp;30 intersection to a low of 1,681&nbsp;vehicles at the intersection with Dickerson Road west of Laurel.\nHistory\nBy 1920, what is now DE&nbsp;24 existed as a state highway between Mission and Phillips Hill, with the remainder of the route existing as an unimproved county road. At this time the road was under contract as a state highway between Laurel and Pepper and from Phillips Hill to east of Millsboro. The sections under contract were completed by 1924 and the remainder of present-day DE&nbsp;24 was proposed as a state highway a year later. Completion of these final segments occurred by 1931. DE&nbsp;24 was assigned to its current alignment between the Maryland border west of Laurel and DE&nbsp;14 (now DE&nbsp;1) in Midway by 1936. In 1940, a new bridge was built over Love Creek as part of improving the route east of Millsboro for traffic heading to the beaches in the summer.\nOn April 16, 2018, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) unveiled plans to widen DE&nbsp;24 to four lanes between the Love Creek bridge and DE&nbsp;1 along with adding left turn lanes and improving intersections. This project is planned in order to improve safety and reduce traffic congestion along the road. Construction on the first phase between Mulberry Knoll Road and DE&nbsp;1 began on March 3, 2020 and was completed in early 2022. Construction on the second phase between the Love Creek bridge and Mulberry Knoll Road began in March 2022; construction is scheduled to be finished in 2024.\nA two-lane bypass of DE&nbsp;24 is being built to the north of Millsboro, running from the intersection of US&nbsp;113 and DE&nbsp;20, which will be converted to an interchange, east across Millsboro Pond, DE&nbsp;30, and Hollyville Road to an intersection with DE&nbsp;24 east of Millsboro. The bypass is being built to reduce congestion on the section of DE&nbsp;24 through Millsboro. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 31, 2023, with Governor John Carney, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, DelDOT secretary Nicole Majeski, and local officials in attendance. Construction of the Millsboro bypass is planned to be completed in the later part of 2025.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Maryland state line; western terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of DE&nbsp;30\n}}\n|notes=West end of DE&nbsp;5 overlap\n}}\n|notes=East end of DE&nbsp;5 overlap\n}}\n|notes=West end of DE&nbsp;1D overlap; eastern terminus of DE&nbsp;24 Alt.\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus; southern terminus of DE&nbsp;1D\n}}\nDelaware Route 24 Alternate\nDelaware Route&nbsp;24 Alternate (DE&nbsp;24 Alt.) is an alternate route of DE&nbsp;24 between US&nbsp;113 in Stockley and DE&nbsp;24 in Midway. The route heads east from US&nbsp;113 on two-lane undivided Speedway Road, passing to the north of Georgetown Speedway. DE&nbsp;24 Alt. reaches a roundabout with Zoar Road/Bethesda Road and heads southeast onto Zoar Road, passing through agricultural areas with some woods and homes and crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line. The road continues east through more areas of farms, woods, and residences, turning north and east before crossing DE&nbsp;30 in Zoar. The route heads east-northeast through more rural areas, turning north onto Hollyville Road. DE&nbsp;24 Alt. turns northeast and comes to a junction with DE&nbsp;5 in Hollyville. The road continues east as Hollymount Road and intersects DE&nbsp;23 in Hollymount. Here, DE&nbsp;24 Alt. turns north to join DE&nbsp;23 on Beaver Dam Road and the two routes continue through agricultural and wooded areas with residential developments, curving to the northeast and crossing Bundicks Branch. In Five Points the road intersects DE&nbsp;1D at a roundabout, with DE&nbsp;23 turning to the north and DE&nbsp;24 Alt. continuing northeast along with DE&nbsp;1D on Plantation Road, which soon becomes a divided highway. The two routes curve southeast immediately to the south of the intersection between US&nbsp;9/DE&nbsp;404 and DE&nbsp;1 and head through a mix of farmland and residential development as an undivided road. Finally, the road reaches an intersection with DE&nbsp;24 where DE&nbsp;24 Alt. ends and DE&nbsp;1D turns northeast to join DE&nbsp;24. DE&nbsp;24 Alt. was designated by 2006.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Western terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=West end of DE&nbsp;23 overlap\n}}\n|notes=Roundabout; east end of DE&nbsp;23 overlap; west end of DE&nbsp;1D overlap; northern terminus of DE&nbsp;1D\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-024/ DE&nbsp;24 at AARoads.com]\n* [https://www.alpsroads.net/roads/de/de_24/ Delaware Roads - DE&nbsp;24]"
