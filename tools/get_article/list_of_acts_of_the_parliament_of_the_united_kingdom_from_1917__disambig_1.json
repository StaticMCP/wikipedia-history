For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n7 & 8 Geo. 5\nThe seventh session of the 30th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 7 February 1917 until 6 February 1918.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 7 & 8 Geo. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  with respect to the times at which a Census of Production may be taken.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to Mines other than Coal Mines.}}\n|  }}\n-\n| |note4= }}\n|  with respect to the Officers to whom powers under that Act may be delegated.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  and for certain other purposes connected with Pensions and Allowances.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the amalgamation of Trade Unions.|note4= }}\n|  and to grant relief in connexion with the present war from liabilities and disqualifications arising out of certain contracts.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  confirmation in Scotland to estates of persons serving in Naval or Military Service during the present War.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  as extended by subsequent enactments.}}\n|  and for the transfer of their powers, duties, and functions to the Minister of Pensions, and for purposes connected therewith.}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n-\n|  as respects the Prevention and Treatment of Disease in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|  in cases of total incapacity.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1916.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  with respect to the time for noting Bills.}}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and 1916. }}\n|  of disabled men discharged from the Naval and Military Services of His Majesty and of women in receipt of Pensions.|note4= }}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Ramsey First Hollow Drainage District.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  in its application to the North Riding of the County of York.|note4= }}\n|\n| |note4=|po1=St. John Great Wollaston St. Alphege Greenwich and Bethesda Chapel Narberth Order.|po1short=n}}\n|  relating to the School Board of Perth.|po1=Perth School Board Order 1917|Provisional Order to confer on the School Board of Perth additional powers with regard to Sharp's Institution Perth to authorise the transfer to the School Board of Perth of the assets of the Perth Educational Trust to provide for the future administration thereof and for other purposes.}}\n|  and the Local Government Board (Ireland) Provisional Orders Confirmation (No. 2) Act 1911.\n|po2=Rathfriland Sewerage Order 1917|Provisional Order to enable the Council of the Rural District of Newry No. 1 to put in force the Compulsory Clauses of the Lands Clauses Acts.}}\n|  relating to Lanarkshire County Council (Water &c.).|po1=Lanarkshire County Council (Water, &c.)
