It provides banking and payments services to hundreds of public bodies and offers advice on monetary transactions and cash management.\nFunctions\nGovernment Banking runs shared banking arrangements for customer bodies and procures payment services from commercial providers under a direct-to-bank model. It supports Bacs, CHAPS and card-acquiring services and provides a help desk for customer bodies.\nOrganisation\nGovernment Banking operates within HM Revenue and Customs and serves central departments, agencies and other public bodies. GOV.UK describes a team of about 40 staff that supports more than 750 customer organisations. Procurement notices state that Government Banking provides services to over 600 organisations, which reflects contractual lots at a point in time.\nHistory\nGovernment Banking was created in 2008 when the government announced that the Office of HM Paymaster General would be incorporated into a new body responsible for shared banking for government. The Office’s historic functions were transferred into the new service.\nThe Government Banking Service is not the exclusive provider of banking services to UK government. In August 2025, Lloyds Banking Group won an 8 year contract to provide services to over 30 government departments, hosted on their Gem payments platform.\nSee also\n* Bank of England\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n}}"
