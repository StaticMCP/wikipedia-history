In 1968, the album was re-released as Eternally Soul.\nReception\nEditors of AllMusic Guide gave this album three out of five stars, with critic Richie Unterberger characterizing the release as \"respectable but not terribly exciting, and a bit schizo in concept\", due to alternating tracks between the musical acts rather than having them collaborate directly. In a review of reissues for Billboard, Chris Morris called this album a \"bopping session\".\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
