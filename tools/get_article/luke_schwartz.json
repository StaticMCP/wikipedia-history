Since then, he has only had a few other results, including £10,850 at the 2005 Harbour Lights in Brighton.\nSchwartz is best known for his online prowess, especially on Full Tilt Poker before the site was shut down, where he played under the moniker __FullFlush1__. He started off grinding ring games in 2005 but went broke several times before winning the Sunday Million on Poker Stars in 2007. After this win, Schwartz returned to the cash tables. In recent times, he has taken on some of the biggest names in online poker such as Urindanger, durrrr, and Ziigmund, at the biggest stakes with some success.\nLuke Schwartz has played in the Party Poker Premier League several times including Party Poker Premier League 4 where he finished second and won $200,000, beaten by David Benyamine.\nWhat has perhaps garnered more attention is Schwartz' outspoken nature, both on and off the table. He regards himself as the best tournament player around, and even made his claim at the Monte Carlo High Rollers event to the rest of his table, which included Daniel Negreanu and Phil Ivey.\nIn December 2009, Schwartz was chip leader heading into the Full Tilt Poker Million VIII final table, and eventually finished fourth, collecting prize money of $150,000. Schwartz had previously won his heat in the Poker Million VIII, overcoming a table of Bill Edler, Mark Vos and Tony G, before coming from behind to defeat John Duthie heads-up. He then navigated a semi-final featuring Annette Obrestad and Tony Bloom to secure his place in the final. In 2012 at World Series of Poker [the poker players championship] Schwartz finished fourth for over $400,000. According to High Stakes Database, Schwartz’ cash game losses stand at $775,000.\nSchwartz is currently a featured blogger on Black Belt Poker. His comments, many of which divide audiences, are often cited on forums such as Two Plus Two.\nAs of 2023, his live tournament winnings exceed $1.7 million.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-players/149392-luke-schwartz Card Player profile]\n*[http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&n=50385 Hendon Mob profile]\n*[https://www.worldpokertour.com/player/luke-schwartz/ WPT profile]\n*[https://www.wsop.com/players/profile/?playerid=120250 WSOP profile]"
