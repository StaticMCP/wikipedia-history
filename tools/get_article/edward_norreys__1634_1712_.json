His father was the illegitimate son of Francis Norris, 1st Earl of Berkshire and Sarah Rose. He was educated at The Queen's College, Oxford from 1650 before entering Lincoln's Inn in 1654. Between 1656 and 1658 he travelled in France. Norreys was knighted by Charles II on 22 November 1662 and on 9 November that year he married Jane Clarke, daughter of Sir John Clarke of Shabington.\nIn 1666 he was appointed a justice of the peace for Oxfordshire and he was made a deputy lieutenant of the county two years later. Norreys was elected to the House of Commons of England as the Member of Parliament for Oxfordshire in a by-election in November 1675. He made few contributions to the Cavalier Parliament. He was returned for the county seat again in March 1679. In the second election of 1679 and in the elections of 1681 and 1685, he unsuccessful stood for election in Oxford as an opponent of the Exclusion Bill.\nIn late 1687, he refused to answer the questions of James II's agents on whether he would support repeal of the Test Act and he was removed from his local offices in February 1688. Following the Glorious Revolution, Norreys was elected to represent Oxford but stayed relatively inactive in parliament. He remained a Tory, at first refusing the Association of 1696. Between 1701 and 1708, Norreys returned to representing the county seat, including in the First Parliament of Great Britain from 1707.\nNorreys died in 1712 and was buried at Weston-on-the-Green on 5 October that year. By his wife he had four sons and five daughters. All of his sons, including Francis Norreys, predeceased him and his estates were inherited by Henry Bertie, the husband of his eldest daughter Philadelphia. One of Norreys' daughters, Susanna, was the second wife of Sir Cyril Wyche.\nReferences"
