ASECS was established in 1969, and has been an affiliate of the American Historical Association (AHA) since 2000. ASECS is an interdisciplinary society in the sense that its members come from a wide range of humanities disciplines, including history, literature, philosophy, art history, and musicology. The society organizes an annual conference and sponsors two publications: the quarterly journal Eighteenth-Century Studies and the annual volume Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture. It awards the Louis Gottschalk Prize and the James L. Clifford Article Prize.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth-century_studies/ Eighteenth-Century Studies]\n*[http://muse.jhu.edu/journal/378 Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture]"
