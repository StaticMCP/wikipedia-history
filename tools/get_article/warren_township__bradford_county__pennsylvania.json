It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The population was 959 at the 2010 census.\nHistory\nThe first Euro-American settlers in the township bought tracts of land beginning in the 1790s and moved into a forested wilderness from their New England homes. The Providence, Rhode Island–based company Brown & Ives was a major player in recruiting settlers, especially to the southern half of the town. Parley Coburn represented the company's interests for nearly 40 years, until his death in 1860. He was proud of the fact that at his death he had finally sold the last of the lots. It had been a difficult task because money was scarce, the original lot prices were high, and developing a living from the earth was difficult. In some instances, Brown & Ives held mortgages into the third generation of a family on the land.\nGeography\nWarren Township occupies the northeastern corner of Bradford County, along the New York state line.
