The Ancient Paleo-Siberian population is thought to have arisen from an Ancient East Asian lineage, which diverged from other East Asian populations sometime between 26kya to 36kya, and merged with Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) sometime between 20kya to 25kya. The ANE themselves are described as the \"result of a palaeolithic admixture\" between ancient West Eurasians and ancient East Eurasians. The source for the East Asian component among Ancient Paleo-Siberians is to date best represented by Ancient Northern East Asian populations from the Amur region older than 13,000 years, such as AR19K and AR14K, and before the Devil's Cave Ancient Northeast Asian specimens.\nThe Ancient Paleo-Siberians are mainly defined by two human archaeological specimens: the 14,000-year-old Ust-Kyakhta-3 (UKY) individual found near Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, and the 9-10,000-year-old Kolyma_M individual found in northeastern Siberia. Ancient Paleo-Siberians derive between 30–36% ancestry from the Ancient North Eurasians (ANE), deeply related to European hunter-gatherers, with the remainder ancestry (64–70%) being derived from an East Asian source. The Ancient Paleo-Siberians are closely related to the Ancient Beringians, and modern far-northeastern Siberia communities, such as the Koryaks, as well as to Native Americans.\nTechnologically, Ancient Paleo-Siberians have been associated with microblade technology and post-Last Glacial Maximum mammoth hunting.\nAncient Paleo-Siberians, in conjunction with an Inner Northeast Asian (Yumin-like) lineage, gave rise to the Cisbaikal_LNBA ancestry, which may be associated with ancient Yeniseian speakers. Ancient Paleo-Siberians also formed the dominant ancestral source for Altai hunter-gatherers (7500BP), in conjunction with a Botai-like source, as well as for the subsequent Okunev culture, in conjunction with additional Baikal hunter-gatherer and Afanasievo-like sources.\nThe Paleo-Siberians were later largely replaced by waves of Neo-Siberians and Neolithic Amur populations, which may be associated with the expansion of early Uralic and Yukaghir speakers, followed later on by Tungusic, Turkic, and Mongolic speakers.\nAccording to a 2025 study, Native American-related Paleosiberian ancestry in continental Siberia mixed with East Asian groups from the Amur River region and Inland East Asia and contributed to the genetic makeup of ancient and present Yeniseian and Uralic-speaking groups. The latter is responsible for spreading haplogroup N throughout Eurasia. They also received input from North Eurasian Hunter-Gatherers, who lived about ~10–4kya and are characterized by distinct West and East Eurasian admixture. Input from these hunter-gatherers, however, is limited in ancient and present Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic-speaking populations from Central and Northern Eurasia, as well as pastoralists from the Late Bronze Age and Iron age such as Scythians, Sarmatians, and Xiongnu.\nSee also\n* Indigenous peoples of Siberia\n* Paleosiberian languages\nReferences\nSources\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* |doi-access=free }}\n* }}\nFurther reading\n*"
