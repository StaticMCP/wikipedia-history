A new Royal Warrant issued on 21 March 1956 provided for separate Colonial Fire Brigades and Police medals under their own warrants, with the name of the medal changing to the Colonial Fire Brigades Long Service Medal. The name was again changed in 2012 to the Overseas Territories Fire Brigades Long Service Medal. This reflected the change in the way Britain's remaining colonies were described, they being classed as 'Overseas Territories' from 2002.\nThe medal is awarded for 18 years continuous and efficient full or part-time service in a fire brigade of any British Colony or Overseas Territory. Service in more than one colony can qualify, as can previous service in any fire brigade entitled to the Fire Brigade Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, excluding any service already recognised by the award of a British long service medal. Compulsory service in the British armed forces or Merchant Navy which interrupted, and was continuous with, qualifying fire service counts.\nClasps are awarded for completing 25 and 30 years service respectively.  In undress uniform, when only ribbons are worn, these clasps are represented by silver rosettes attached to the ribbon.\nAppearance\nThe medal is circular and silver,  in diameter.  The obverse depicts the effigy of the reigning sovereign surrounded by the royal titles.\nTo date, there have been five types of obverse, the date in brackets showing the year the design was introduced:\nFile:Colonial Police Long Service Medal, George V obverse.jpg|George V, robed bust (1934)\nFile:George Medal, King George VI, first obverse.png|George VI, INDIAE IMP (1937)\nFile:George Medal, King George VI, second obverse.jpg|George VI, omits INDIAE IMP (1948)\nFile:George Medal, Queen Elizabeth, first obverse.png|Elizabeth II, BR:OMN (1953)\nFile:George Medal, Queen Elizabeth, second obverse.png|Elizabeth II, DEI GRATIA (circa 1955)\nFrom the creation of the medal in 1934 the reverse was distinct from the police version of the medal, and bears the depiction of a Firefighter's helmet and Fire axe superimposed on a laurel wreath.  Circumscribed around the central design are the words FOR LONG SERVICE AND GOOD CONDUCT • COLONIAL FIRE BRIGADES •. In 2012 this latter wording was changed to OVERSEAS TERRITORIES FIRE BRIGADES.\nThe medal hangs from a ring with claw suspension. The ribbon is dark blue with a central stripe of green, with the centre stripe divided by three thin stripes of white. The clasps for further service are attached to the ribbon and are silver and decorated with a spray of laurel.\nReferences"
