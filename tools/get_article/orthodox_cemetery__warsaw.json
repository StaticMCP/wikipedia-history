The Roman Catholic parish of St. Lawrence was then turned into an Orthodox church, by decree of the Tsar himself. Although the cemetery was officially consecrated in 1841, the first burials took place there as early as 1836. In 1905 a new church, St. John the Ladder was built, while St. Lawrence Church returned to the Roman Catholic church after Poland regained its independence.\nCustoms\nThe burial place of a person depended on his/her social status. Thus, generals, clergy and notable civil servants were buried near the church. The second 'zone' included the graves of lower rank officers, clerks and wealthy merchants. The third 'zone' housed the graves of soldiers and members of the bourgeoisie, while the poorest were buried in the area furthest from the church. During the Warsaw Uprising mass executions of Varsovians were carried out there.\nOn All Saint's Day, processions of the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches take place there, preceded by an ecumenical service conducted by priests from both congregations.\nNotable burials\nAmong those buried at the cemetery are:\n* Mikhail Artsybashev (1879–1927), Russian poet and writer\n* Marko Bezruchko (1883–1944), Ukrainian military commander and a General of the Ukrainian National Republic\n* Andrzej Butruk (1964–2011), Polish actor, satirician, singer\n* Dmitry Filosofov (1872–1940), Russian author, essayist, literary critic\n* Aleksander Gudzowaty (1938–2013), Polish economist and entrepreneur\n* Czesław Kiszczak (1925–2015), Polish general, Interior Minister, Prime Minister\n* Jerzy Klinger (1918–1975), Polish Orthodox theologian\n* Siergiej Muchanow (1833–1897), Russian official, officer in the Special Corps of Gendarmes,  director of the Warsaw Theatre Directorate\n* Alexander Petrov (1794–1867), Russian chess player, chess composer, and chess writer\n* Aleksandr Puzyrevskii (1845–1904), Russian General of the Infantry\n* Witold Smętek (1910–1983), Polish athlete (spelled as Witold Smentek)\n* Sokrates Starynkiewicz (1820–1892), Mayor of Warsaw\n* Jerzy Turonek (1929–2019), Polish-Belarusian historian\n* metropolitan Dionizy (Waledyński) (1876–1960)\n* Timothy (Szretter), a Polish Orthodox clergyman, the third Metropolitan of Warsaw and all Poland (1901–1962)\n* Andrzej Walicki (1930–2020), Polish historian\nGallery\nFile:PL Wwa, Cmentarz Prawoslawny - praw - Raskuwarkin,2023.09.10, fot Ivonna Nowicka (1)a.jpg|A Russian grave from 1908\nFile:Awramow cmentarz prawosławny na woli grób.JPG\nFile:Widok na dzwonnicę cerkwi jana klimaka.JPG|The belltower\nFile:Jerzy Klinger grób cmentarz prawosławny na Woli.JPG|The grave of Jerzy Klinger painted by Jerzy Nowosielski\nExternal links\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&t=k&om=1&ll=52.230849,20.946035&spn=0.011776,0.029268 Cmentarz prawosławny na Woli z satelity]\n*"
