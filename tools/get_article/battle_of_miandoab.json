It was part of the broader uprising led by Simko Shikak, a Kurdish nationalist and tribal leader who sought to assert autonomy in northwestern Iran during the weakening of central authority in the aftermath of World War I.\nThe battle resulted in a Kurdish victory, with Simko's forces successfully repelling Iranian government troops and taking control of the area.\nBackground\nFollowing the collapse of the Qajars after World War I, Iran was politically fragmented, with various tribal leaders exercising autonomous control over their territories. One of the most prominent of these figures was Simko Shikak, a Kurdish leader who had established de facto rule in parts of northwestern Iran. From 1919 to 1922, Simko led a series of uprisings and formed loose alliances with other Kurdish and tribal leaders, exploiting the weakness of the central government of Iran to expand his power base.\nSimko's rule in the region was marked by efforts to centralize authority within his domain, collect tribute, and maintain a standing military force. However, his ambitions increasingly alarmed the central authorities. His forces operated in areas such as Urmia, Salmas, and Miandoab, often clashing with Iranian military units and rival tribal elements. Reports of atrocities committed by his forces, including attacks on Assyrians and Armenians, further fueled opposition to his rule.\nIn 1921, Reza Khan, minister of war, initiated a military campaign to bring rebellious tribal regions under state control. Miandoab became a strategic target due to its location at the crossroads of tribal movement and its significance as a base of Simko's operations.\nBattle\nThe confrontation at Miandoab began when government forces, under officers loyal to Reza Khan, launched an offensive against Simko's entrenched positions. However, the Kurdish forces, experienced in irregular mountain warfare and well-fortified in the region, successfully repelled the attack. Simko's troops inflicted heavy losses on the Iranian forces, forcing them to retreat from the area and leaving Miandoab under Kurdish control; he was at the height of his power in 1921. Some Azerbaijanis in Miandoab and Maragheh sent letters of submission to Simko.\nThe victory at Miandoab marked one of Simko's most significant military achievements, consolidating his control over a large portion of northwestern Iran. His authority expanded further following the battle, and for a time, he governed effectively as a regional warlord.\nSimko was in a strong enough position to potentially threaten Tabriz, one more victory could have made him \"chieftain of all western tribes\" and enabled him to establish a republic.\nAftermath\nDespite the Kurdish victory at Miandoab, the battle provoked a more forceful response from the central government. Reza Khan, committed to consolidating power and eliminating tribal autonomy, launched a series of broader campaigns in subsequent years. Although Simko attempted to expand and solidify his rule, internal divisions among the Kurdish tribes and growing pressure from the Iranian military eventually eroded his power base.\nBy 1922, government forces had begun to regain territory, and Simko's movement steadily declined. In 1930, he was lured into negotiations by Iranian authorities and assassinated by a trap, bringing an end to his resistance.\nSee also\n* Simko Shikak revolt (1926)\n* Kurdish separatism in Iran\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
