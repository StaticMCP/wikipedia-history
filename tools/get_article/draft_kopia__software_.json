It does not image the whole machine, but allows choosing files and/or directories to backup.\nKopia offers various features such as data compression, encryption (via symmetrical methods such as AES-256 and ChaCha20), error correction to prevent data corruption by faulty hardware, and data deduplication. It also recognizes that moved or renamed files have the same content, avoiding re-uploading.\nPerformance\nKopia was benchmarked by Veeam in 2023, and performed significantly better than Restic (a similar, but CLI-only software). In this test, the time taken to backup 200GiB of data was of about 200 seconds. It also performed far better than the benchmark in backup size (90GB vs 199GB for Restic), and in tests regarding a scenario of a large number of files with very little data.\nSee also\n* Comparison of file synchronization software\n* List of backup software\n* Comparison of backup software\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Synchronization_and_backup_programs| ArchWiki: Syncronization and backup programs]"
