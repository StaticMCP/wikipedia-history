The president also serves ex officio as the '''chief justice of the People's Republic of China'''. The incumbent president of the Supreme People's Court is Zhang Jun, who took office on 11 March 2023.\nHistory\nThe Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government was established on 1 October 1949. Shen Junru served as the first president by the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\nOn 27 September 1954, the SPC of the Central People's Government was replaced with the SPC of the People's Republic of China.\nSelection\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ. However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders. Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.\nAfter the nomination, the president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote. The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years, and the president is restricted to two consecutive terms. Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.\nPowers\nAccording to the Judges Law of the People's Republic of China, the president of the SPC is the chief justice of the People's Republic of China.\nList of presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background: #cccccc;\"\n!No.\n!width=\"150\" colspan=\"2\"|Chairperson\n!align=\"left\" width=\"20\"|NPC term\n!align=\"center\" width=\"140\"|Took office\n!align=\"center\" width=\"140\"|Left office\n!Political Party\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |President of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government\n|-\n!1\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|沈钧儒\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|October 1, 1949\n|align=\"center\"|September 27, 1954\n|China Democratic League (CDL)\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |President of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China\n|-\n!2\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |董必武\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|align=\"center\"|September 27, 1954\n|align=\"center\"|April 27, 1959\n| rowspan=\"14\" |Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\n|-\n!3\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |谢觉哉\n| align=\"center\" |2nd\n| align=\"center\" |April 27, 1959\n| align=\"center\" |January 3, 1965\n|-\n!4\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |杨秀峰\n| align=\"center\" |3rd\n| align=\"center\" |January 3, 1965\n| align=\"center\" |January 20, 1975\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |5\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |江华\n|4th\n|January 20, 1975\n|March 5, 1978\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |5th\n| align=\"center\" |March 5, 1978\n| align=\"center\" |June 20, 1983\n|-\n!6\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |郑天翔\n| align=\"center\" |6th\n| align=\"center\" |June 20, 1983\n| align=\"center\" |April 9, 1988\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |7\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |任建新\n|7th\n|April 9, 1988\n|March 28, 1993\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |8th\n| align=\"center\" |March 28, 1993\n| align=\"center\" |March 17, 1998\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |8\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |肖扬\n| align=\"center\" |9th\n| align=\"center\" |March 17, 1998\n| align=\"center\" |March 16, 2003\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |10th\n| align=\"center\" |March 16, 2003\n| align=\"center\" |March 16, 2008\n|-\n!9\n| rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" |\n| rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" |王胜俊\n| align=\"center\" |11th\n| align=\"center\" |March 16, 2008\n| align=\"center\" |March 15, 2013\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |10\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |周强\n|12th\n|March 15, 2013\n|March 18, 2018\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|13th\n|align=\"center\"|March 18, 2018\n|align=\"center\"|March 11, 2023\n|-\n!11\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|张军\n|align=\"center\"|14th\n|align=\"center\"|March 11, 2023\n|align=\"center\"|Incumbent\n|}\nTimeline\nColors =\nid:mm value:rgb(0.905,0.643,0) legend:China_Democratic_League\nid:cpc value:rgb(0.87,0,0) legend:Chinese_Communist_Party\nLegend     = columns:1 left:150 top:20 columnwidth:170\nTextData =\npos:(20,20) textcolor:black fontsize:M\ntext:\"Political party:\"\nBarData =\nbarset:PM\nPlotData=\nwidth:8 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbarset:PM\nfrom: 01/10/1949 till: 27/09/1954 color:mm text:\"Shen Junru\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 27/09/1954 till: 27/04/1959 color:cpc text:\"Dong Biwu\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 27/04/1959 till: 03/01/1965 color:cpc text:\"Xie Juezai\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 03/01/1965 till: 20/01/1975 color:cpc text:\"Yang Xiufeng\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 20/01/1975 till: 20/06/1988 color:cpc text:\"Jiang Hua\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 20/06/1988 till: 09/04/1993 color:cpc text:\"Zheng Tianxiang\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 09/04/1993 till: 17/03/1998 color:cpc text:\"Ren Jianxin\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 17/03/1998 till: 16/03/2008 color:cpc text:\"Xiao Yang\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 16/03/2008 till: 15/03/2013 color:cpc text:\"Wang Shengjun\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 15/03/2013 till: 11/03/2023 color:cpc text:\"Zhou Qiang\" fontsize:10\nfrom: 11/03/2023 till: $now       color:cpc text:\"Zhang Jun\" fontsize:10\n}}\nReferences"
