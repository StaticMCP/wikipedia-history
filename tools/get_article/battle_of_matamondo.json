General Van Deventer had already occupied the Central Railway from Kilimatinde to Dodoma and  Belgian troops advanced on Tabora.\nBut for a distance of about 45 miles, the Central Railway passes close under the Nguru and Kanga mountains.\nHere the Germans had positioned 12 companies or some 3,000 men with much heavy and light artillery in the mountains.\nGeneral Smuts sent 4 brigades to the Nguru Mountains to surround and defeat this German force.\nOn 10 August, the British advance guard, the 57th Wilde's Rifles, encountered a fortified German position at the Matamondo pass. The Wild's Rifles were joined by the King's African Rifles and the 5th and 6th South African Infantry battalions. There was fierce fighting all day long, but by nightfall the German defense had not yet been breached.\nThe next morning, the Germans were gone. The day's gain had allowed the main force to escape the planned encirclement.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://archive.org/stream/britishcampaigns00dane/britishcampaigns00dane_djvu.txt British Campaigns in Africa and Pacific]"
