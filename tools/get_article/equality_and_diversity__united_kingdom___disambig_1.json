It promotes equality of opportunity for all, giving every individual the chance to achieve their potential, free from prejudice and discrimination.\nUK legislation requires public authorities to promote equality in everything that they do, also making sure that other organisations meet their legal duties to promote equality while also doing so themselves.\nIn the UK under the Equality Act 2010 there are certain legal requirements under existing legislation to promote equality in the areas of nine protected characteristics. These are often collectively referred to as the general duties to promote equality.\nAs the independent advocate for equality and human rights in Britain, a Commission of Equality and Human Rights (EHRC) exists that aims to reduce inequality, eliminate discrimination, strengthen good relations between people and promote and protect human rights. EHRC has a duty to challenge prejudice and disadvantage and promote the importance of human rights, enforcing equality laws on age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief and sexual orientation and encourage compliance with the Human Rights Act.\nRequirements and duties\nThe requirements to eliminate unlawful sex discrimination and harassment also include discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender reassignment.\nIt follows that:\nEquality and discrimination\nAge\nIt is unlawful for age to be the cause of less favourable treatment in a workplace or in vocational training, unless there is an objective justification for doing so.\nWhere this is referred to, it refers to a person belonging to a particular age (e.g. 32 year olds) or range of ages (e.g. 18 - 30 year olds).\nDisability\nIf one has a physical or mental impairment, that person has specific rights that protect them against discrimination. Employers and service providers are obliged to make reasonable adjustments. Under certain circumstances this protection also extends to their carers [http://www.carersuk.org/Newsandcampaigns/Carersinaction/1216739551]\nA person has a disability if s/he has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on that person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.\nGender reassignment\nThe process of transitioning from one gender to another.\nMarriage and civil partnership\n''Marriage is defined as a 'union between a man and a woman'. Same-sex couples can have their relationships legally recognised as 'civil partnerships'. Civil partners must be treated the same as married couples on a wide range of legal matters.\nPregnancy and maternity\nPregnancy is the condition of being pregnant or expecting a baby. Maternity refers to the period after the birth, and is linked to maternity leave in the employment context. In the non-work context, protection against maternity discrimination is for 26 weeks after giving birth, and this includes treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.\nRace\nRefers to the protected characteristic of Race. It refers to a group of people defined by their race, colour, and nationality (including citizenship) ethnic or national origins.\nWherever one was born, wherever their parents came from, whatever the colour of their skin, they have a right to be treated fairly and be protected against racial discrimination and prejudice.\nReligion and belief\nReligion has the meaning usually given to it but belief includes religious and philosophical beliefs including lack of belief (e.g. Atheism). Generally, a belief should affect your life choices or the way you live for it to be included in the definition.\nReligion or belief should not interfere with anybody’s right to be treated fairly at work, at school, in shops or while accessing public services such as health care and housing.\nSexual orientation\nWhether a person's sexual attraction is towards their own sex, the opposite sex or to both sexes.\nWhether one is straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual should not put them at a disadvantage. The law protects the citizen against discrimination in the workplace, including harassment, on grounds of sexual orientation.''\nYou can see a more in-depth definition of these protected characteristics on the Office of Public Sector Information website.\nSee also\n*British labour law\n*Gender equality\n*Gender inequality\n*Disability\n*Equal pay for women\n*Mental Health\n*Human Rights\n*Antiracism\n*Antisemitism\n*Political correctness\n*Multiculturalism\nReferences\n*[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts Acts of the UK Parliament (with explanatory notes)] – website includes the following viewable documents:\n**Equality Act 2010\n**Equality Act 2006\n**Equal Pay Act 1970\n**Sex Discrimination Act 1975\n**Race Relations Act 1976 and Amendment 2000\n**The Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003\n**Disability Discrimination Act 1995\n**Employment Act 2002\n**Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006\n**Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003\n**Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003\n*[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Race+Relations+Act&Year=1976&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&TYPE=QS&NavFrom=0&activeTextDocId=2059995&PageNumber=1&SortAlpha=0 Race Relations Act 1976 (c. 74)] (UK Statute Law Database, Ministry of Justice, 1976)\n*[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/pdf/ukpga_20000034_en.pdf Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000] (Office of Public Sector Information, 30 November 2000)\n*[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0043:EN:NOT Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin], the Equality Framework Directive 2000 (text in all EU languages)\n*[http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2001/02/feature/eu0102295f.htm New European Framework Equal Treatment Directive examined] (2001)\nExternal links\n*[http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/ Equality and Human Rights Commission] - The EHRC brings together the work of the three provision Commissions, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), Disability Rights Commission (DRC) and Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101029051902/http://www.healthinfoplus.co.uk/ Health Information Plus Website] - Quality assured health information for patients, carers and the public with evaluated information sources including: NHS Scotland, BBC Health, and published healthcare research.\n*[http://www.pickereurope.org/index.php The Picker Institute Europe] - undertakes a combination of research, development and policy activity within the healthcare sector.\n*[http://www.stonewall.org.uk/ Stonewall] - campaigns on behalf of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community in the UK.
