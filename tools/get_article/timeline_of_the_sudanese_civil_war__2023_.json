Moreover, some events may only be fully understood and/or discovered in retrospect.\nApril 2023\n15 April\nKhartoum\nThe Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched attacks on multiple Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) bases across the country, including in the capital Khartoum. At 12:00 (CAT), RSF forces claimed to have captured Khartoum International Airport, Merowe Airport, El Obeid Airport as well as a base in Soba.

A military official said it repelled an RSF attack on the prison saying a few other prisoners were killed or injured while high-profile inmates such as former President Omar al-Bashir were safely secured inside. However, the SAF later said that Bashir had been transferred to the Aliyaa military hospital prior to the fighting. The interior ministry said that the jailbreak at Kobar was part of a series of attacks on five prisons by the RSF from 21 to 24 April. It said that the RSF raid on Kobar led to the deaths of two prison officials and the release of all detainees. The total number of escapees from the attacks was estimated to be at about 25,000.\nFormer interior minister Ahmad Harun, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Darfur and was imprisoned after Bashir's ouster in 2019, said that he and other former officials of the Bashir regime had escaped during the attack with the help of prison guards and the armed forces. He also voiced his support for the SAF in the war. The SAF denied any involvement, saying it did not have jurisdiction over the prison system.\n24 April\nThe SAF accused the RSF of sabotaging the telecom exchange in Khartoum, leading to a nationwide loss of internet service and reduced connectivity in Chad, whose internet infrastructure is interconnected with Sudan.
