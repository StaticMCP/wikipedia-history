They captured Camp Boiro and liberated the prisoners. The camp commandant Siaka Touré managed to hide, but General Lansana Diané, minister of Defense, was captured. He later escaped and took refuge with the ambassador of Algeria.\nThe coup attempt failed, and in the aftermath many opponents of the regime were rounded up and imprisoned in Camp Boiro.\nConstruction of the monument began before 22 November 1971 in memory of the victims of the coup attempt.\nPresident Sékou Touré laid the foundation stone. The occasion was attended by many Guinean officials, and by Guinean and Chinese workers at the construction site. The Chinese chargé d'affaires Tsao Kouan-lin made a speech praising the militant friendship between the people of Guinea and of China.\nThe monument has the legend:\n::\nMONUMENT DU 22 NOVEMBRE 1970.LA REVOLUTION EST EXIGENTE!L´IMPERIALISME TROUVERA SON TOMBEAU EN GUINEE!\n(Monument of 22 November 1970. The Revolution is Imperative! Imperialism finds its grave in Guinea!)\nReferences"
