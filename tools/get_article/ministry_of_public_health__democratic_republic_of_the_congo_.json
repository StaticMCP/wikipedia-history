      "text": "# Ministry of Public Health (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\nThe Ministry of Public Health () is the health ministry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nIt has a public health system based loosely on the historical Belgian colonial public health system.  The ministry is largely a policy and oversight organization, with operational functions embodied within a number of subordinate ministry organizations, including the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Research (Institut National de Recherché Biomédicale) and the Kinshasa School of Public Health.  The latter trains physicians in public health, staffs the public health infrastructure composed of Health Zones, including the Health Zone doctors who provide both public health services and partial staffing of district hospitals.\nIn November 2012, Dr. Félix Kabange Numbi was appointed Health Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As of 2018, the position is held by Oly Ilunga Kalenga.\nSee also\n*William Close\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [http://www.minisanterdc.cd Official Website of the Health Ministry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]"
