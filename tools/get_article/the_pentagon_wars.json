Burton about the development of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.\nPlot\nThe Bradley Fighting Vehicle project, stalled in development for seventeen years at the running cost of $14&nbsp;billion, is the charge of Major General Partridge. To curtail further excessive Pentagon spending, Congress appoints U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Burton to observe the Bradley's field development and tests.\nBurton delves into the complicated development history, beginning in the 1960s under Colonel Robert L. Smith, who becomes frustrated with the continuous design changes mandated by higher ups, leading to the Bradley's transformation from a light troop carrier into a bulky tank-like vehicle poorly suited to its original role. Burton also discovers discrepancies in testing of the Bradley's survivability due to Partridge's cronies, Colonel Bock and Major Sayers. Burton receives confidential information from Smith on the condition of anonymity. Master Sergeant Dalton, the man in charge of live fire testing, reveals he's been routinely ordered to manipulate the test results, asserting that honest officers such as Burton always end up buckling to the pressure of corruption to gain their next promotions.\nBurton's continuous insistence on fair testing prompts Partridge to reassign Burton to Alaska but another anonymous leak from General Smith convinces Defense Secretary Weinberger to demand a full written report on the Bradley. Partridge cancels Burton's transfer and orders him to write the report which he plans to alter when it is sent to him for approval. Burton circumvents this by highlighting the changes made on Partridge's orders in a memorandum, which is leaked to the press and instigates a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee.\nPartridge is humiliated at the hearing and the Committee Chairwoman orders the tests Burton has demanded go ahead. Burton reminds the soldiers performing the survivability tests that despite Partridge's orders to manipulate the tests, their real responsibility is to their fellow soldiers whose lives depend on honest testing. Partridge is humiliated when the live fire testing results in the complete destruction of the vehicle. Dalton and his men admit they were swayed by Burton's sincerity and integrity.\nA postscript explains the Bradley was extensively redesigned in response to Burton's demands, significantly reducing casualties during its use in the Gulf War. Most of the officers involved in the Bradley's development earned promotions and high paying jobs while Burton was forced to retire.\nCast\n* Kelsey Grammer as Major General Partridge\n* Cary Elwes as Lieutenant Colonel James G.
