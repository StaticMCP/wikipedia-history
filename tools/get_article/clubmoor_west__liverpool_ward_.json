      "text": "# Clubmoor West (Liverpool ward)\n\nClubmoor West ward is an electoral district of Liverpool City Council within the Liverpool Walton constituency.\nThe ward was created for the elections held on 4 May 2023 following a 2022 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which decided that the previous 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Clubmoor West ward was created as a single-member ward from the western half of the former Clubmoor ward and a small part of the former County ward. The ward boundaries follow Walton Hall Avenue, Richard Kelly Drive, Queens Drive, Muirhead Avenue, the North Liverpool Extension Line, and Cherry Lane.}}\nReferences"
