Notable militarised interstate disputes are included. For a list of wars before the Acts of Union 1707 merging the Kingdom of England and Scotland, please see List of wars involving England & List of wars involving Scotland. For a list of wars involving the predecessors of both states and a broader list of wars fought on the Island of Great Britain, see the list of wars in Great Britain.\nHistorically, the United Kingdom relied most heavily on the Royal Navy and maintained relatively small land forces. Most of the episodes listed here deal with insurgencies and revolts in the various colonies of the British Empire.\nDuring its history, the United Kingdom's forces (or forces with a British mandate) have invaded, had some control over or fought conflicts in 171 of the world's 193 countries that are currently UN member states, or nine out of ten of all countries.\nLists\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: 4px double #d69d36;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#C8102E; color:white;\" | 1707–1801 ||  || List of wars involving the Kingdom of Great Britain in the 18th century\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#C8102E; color:white;\" | 1801–1900 ||   || List of wars involving the United Kingdom in the 19th century\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#C8102E; color:white;\" | 1901–2000 ||  || List of wars involving the United Kingdom in the 20th century\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#C8102E; color:white;\" | 2001–present ||  || List of wars involving the United Kingdom in the 21st century\n|}\nSee also\n* List of wars involving England\n* List of wars involving Scotland\n* List of wars in Great Britain\n* Military history of the United Kingdom\n* Declaration of war by the United Kingdom\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* Tal, David (2001).
