The Almoravid forces ravaged Catalan territory but were surprised in an ambush and defeated.\nBackground\nFollowing the fall of Valencia in 1102, the Almoravid dynasty began to expand into the Upper March, conquering Zaragoza, the last taifa in the Iberian Peninsula, in 1110.\nThree years later, in 1113, the Catalan counties together with the republic of Pisa and the county of Provence began an expedition against the Balearic Islands. The Taifa of Mallorca asked the Almoravids for help, who sent reinforcements to the islands. Taking advantage of the fact that a large part of the armies of the Catalan counties were outside the peninsula, the governors of Zaragoza and Valencia,  and , began an expedition to Catalan territory.\nExpedition\nThe Almoravid forces penetrated through Lleida, the Pla d'Urgell and Segarra. They attacked the Bages and caused great damage to the Monastery of Sant Benet de Bages, which would be restored three years later. An Almoravid army from the Balearic Islands landed at the mouth of the Besòs River and attacked Sant Adrià de Besòs and Sant Andreu de Palomar.\nThey had captured a large loot. However, while they were returning through the plain of Barcelona, they were ambushed in a ravine near Martorell by the combined armies of the counties of Barcelona, Urgell and Cerdanya, killing Muhammad ibn al-Hajj and most of their army. The remaining Almoravid army was pursued along the coast of Salou. Although Muhammad ibn Aisha managed to escape, he was seriously injured, which caused his death shortly after.\nAftermath\nOne year later, in 1115, the Almoravids laid siege to Barcelona. However, after 20 days, Catalan reinforcements commanded by Ramon Berenguer III arrived and forced them to lift the siege. That same year, the Christians managed to conquer the Balearic Islands but they were reconquered again by the Almoravids some months later.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
