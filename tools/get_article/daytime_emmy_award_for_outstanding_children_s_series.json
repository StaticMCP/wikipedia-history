Children's television had been recognized at the Emmys since the inaugural year. In 1995, a separate award for pre-school children's television was created, and the two categories had been recognized since then. Starting in 2018, a distinction between children's series and educational series was created, resulting in two separate categories. In November 2021, it was announced that all Daytime Emmy categories honoring children's programming would be retired in favor of a separate Children's & Family Emmy Awards ceremony that was held starting in 2022.\nWinners and Nominees\nWinners in bold\nOutstanding Entertainment Children's Series\n1974\n* Zoom (PBS)\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (CBS)\n* Star Trek: The Animated Series (NBC)\n1975\n* Star Trek: The Animated Series (NBC)\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* The Pink Panther Show (NBC)\n1976\n* Big Blue Marble (SYN)\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (CBS)\n* Zoom (PBS)\n1977\n* Zoom (PBS)\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"David Copperfield\") (PBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"Heidi\") (PBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"The Prince and the Pauper\") (PBS)\n1978\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"Robin Hood\") (PBS)\n* Zoom (PBS)\n1979\n* Kids Are People Too (ABC)\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"John Halifax, Gentleman\") (PBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"Lorna Doone\") (PBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"The Secret Garden\") (PBS)\n1980\n* Hot Hero Sandwich (NBC)\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Kids Are People Too (ABC)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"Leatherstocking Tales\") (PBS)\n1981\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"A Tale of Two Cities\") (PBS)\n* ABC Weekend Specials (ABC)\n* Once Upon a Classic (\"The Legend of King Arthur\") (PBS)\n1982\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* ABC Weekend Specials (ABC)\n1983\n* Smurfs (NBC)\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n1984\n* Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n* Smurfs (NBC)\nOutstanding Children's Instructional Programming\n1976\n* Schoolhouse Rock!
