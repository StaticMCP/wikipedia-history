It services North Queensland and Far North Queensland, and is the largest TAFE region in Queensland with close to 20 campus locations in sixteen localities, covering an area of 52'000 kilometres.\nIn 2017 TAFE Queensland commenced consolidating TAFE Queensland North and its five other regional registered training organisations (RTOs) into a single RTO. TAFE Queensland North now no longer exists as a separate RTO.\nCampus locations\n*Atherton\n*Northern Peninsula Area (Bamaga)\n*Bowen\n*Burdekin\n*Cairns\n*Cairns - Great Barrier Reef International Marine College\n*Charters Towers\n*Cloncurry\n*Ingham\n*Innisfail\n*Mareeba\n*Mount Isa\n*Normanton\n*Palm Island\n*Thursday Island\n*Townsville (Aitkenvale)\n*Townsville (Bohle - Trade Training Centre)\n*Townsville (Pimlico)\n*Whitsundays\nSee also\n*TAFE Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://tafeqld.edu.au TAFE Queensland]"
