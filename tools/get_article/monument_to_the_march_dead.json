A 1920 design produced by Walter Gropius, in collaboration with Fred Forbát, was selected from those submitted in a competition organized by the Gewerkschaftskartell (Union Cartel) and the Städtisches Museum Weimar (Weimar Municipal Museum).\nAlthough Gropius had said that the Bauhaus should remain politically neutral, he agreed to participate in the competition of Weimar artists at the end of 1920.\nThe monument was built between 1920 and 1922. An unveiling ceremony for the memorial was held on May 1, 1922.\nObjecting to it politically and as an example of what they called degenerate art, the Nazis destroyed the monument in February 1936.\nThe monument was reconstructed in 1946.\nArchitecture\nThe form of the monument alludes to a thunderbolt. The structure is constructed of concrete.\nThe monument was arranged around an inner space, in which visitors could stand. The repeatedly fractured and highly angular memorial rose up on three sides, as if thrust up from or rammed into the earth.\nReception\nTheo van Doesburg, leader of the De Stijl movement, criticized Gropius' expressionist design, decrying it as \"the result of a cheap literary idea.\"\nGallery\nFile:Monument to the March Dead Opening.jpg|Opening ceremony of the monument\nFile:Hauptfriedhof Weimar Denkmal der Märzgefallenen 06.jpg|The structure in 2019 in its current form\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/panorama/1920_bauhaus2019_monumenttothemarchdead_vr_008 Interactive panorama of the monument]"
