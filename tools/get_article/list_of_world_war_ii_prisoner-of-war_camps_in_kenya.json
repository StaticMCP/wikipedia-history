Roy Ashworth\nCamp No. 360 at Ndarugu, that held some 10,000 prisoners, has miraculously escaped sub-division and new constructions. It was “discovered” by Mr. Aldo Manos in 2007, with the church and the monument built by the prisoners almost intact. In 2011 they were gazetted by the Government as “monuments of the history of Kenya”.\nReferences\nSee also\nReference to Camp 354 in No Picnic on Mount Kenya"
