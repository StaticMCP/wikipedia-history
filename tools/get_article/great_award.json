Morad is a smooth-talking con artist who is constantly getting himself and the others into jail.  Bijan works at a pizza place where his boss Mr. Sa'adati (Saeid Pirdoost) is trying to get him to marry his daughter Mahnaz.  When Bijan wins a brand new Mercedes Benz in a sweepstakes at his bank, it seems like all of their problems are over, but that all changes when Bijan meets Kambiz (Reza Shafiei Jam), and hilarity ensues.\nCast\n* Reza Shafiei Jam\n* Javad Razavian\n* Siamak Ansari\n* Saed Hedayati\n* Behnoosh Bakhtiari\n* Mehran Modiri\n* Saeid Pirdoost\n* Tarlan Parvaneh\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
