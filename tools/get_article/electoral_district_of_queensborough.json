It was based in the southern suburbs of Tasmania's capital city, Hobart, in particular Sandy Bay, and surrounding districts such as Cascades, Taroona and Kingston.\nThe seat was created as a single-member seat ahead of the Assembly's first election held in 1856. It was abolished at the 1886 election when neighbouring Kingborough became a two-member seat.\nThe seat was then recreated as a single-member seat at the 1897 election and was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model for the entire state in 1909.\nMembers for Queenborough\nFirst incarnation: 1856–1886\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
