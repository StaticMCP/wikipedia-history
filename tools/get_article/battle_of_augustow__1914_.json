It took place between the Russian Empire and the German Empire in September 1914.\nPrelude\nFollowing the retreat of the Russian 2nd Army after the Battle of Tannenberg, Russian forces found themselves defending the perimeter of Augustów. The 10th Army established positions along the banks of the Neman river. Due to the outbreak of the battle for Warsaw, the command of the Northwestern Front decided to conduct an operation to secure the rear of the main army.\nThe Russians brought in reserves from the 10th Army, consisting of 9 infantry divisions and 1.5 cavalry divisions. They faced General Schubert's 8th Army, which included 7 infantry divisions, 1 cavalry division, and Landwehr units. Overall, the forces were roughly equal in size.\nBattle\nFighting erupted against the German 8th Army on 12 September as German forces attempted to capture the Osowiec fortress, while other units launched attacks on Druskininkai. The fighting lasted for three days and yielded no significant benefits for the Germans. Meanwhile, the Russians capitalized on their defensive success and launched a counteroffensive on 15 September.\nGerman units attempting to ford the Neman River were overwhelmed, and the battle moved into the Augustów forests. The German units were partially blocked, and the 3rd Siberian Corps advanced to their rear, where the Germans suffered significant losses, with some forces being defeated and others captured. On 18 September, a counter bayonet battle took place, during which Russian General Stelnitsky personally led the infantry into action, achieving complete success. The Germans retreated after losing 600 soldiers, while Russian casualties amounted to only 16.\nSubsequent fighting was limited to German attempts to cross the Neman, which ended in complete failure, and artillery duels, in which the Russians emerged victorious. According to one report in the Evening Standard, approximately 20,000 German bodies were seen floating down the Neman River. The Germans retreated eight miles, pursued by Russian Cossack soldiers, leaving behind wounded troops, weapons, munitions, and supply convoys.\nGeneral Flug corroborated these accounts, stating that German losses were at least as great as those of the Russians. The Russians captured significant trophies, including 22 guns, several dozen ammunition boxes, a few vehicles, and 3,000 German prisoners. This victory allowed the Russians to recover from their earlier setbacks at the start of the war. The situation had dramatically reversed: the Russian 10th Army completely defeated the German 8th Army and advanced into East Prussia, occupying several key cities.\nAftermath\nThe battle concluded with a significant operational victory for Russia. The skillful actions of the Russian command pinned down elements of the German 8th Army, contributing to the victory at the Battle of Warsaw and facilitating the invasion of East Prussia. This success also bolstered the positions of the Northwestern Front.\nThe exact German losses remain unknown but were reportedly extremely high. According to accounts from participants, \"The Neman was red with blood after the battle,\" and \"The entire German retreat path was littered with their corpses.\"\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* 10-я армия в сентябре 1914 г. // Военный сборник — Кн.
