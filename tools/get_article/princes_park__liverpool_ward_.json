The ward was retained during the 1953 boundary review, before being merged with the Granby ward to form Granby Princes Park ward in 1973. The ward was re-created in the 2003 boundary review, and retained as a smaller ward electing one councillor in the 2022 review.\n2004 boundaries\nThe ward was reinstated for the 2004 Municipal elections taking the whole of the former Granby ward with part of the former Abercromby and Smithdown wards.\nThe population of the 2004 ward taken at the 2011 census was 17,104. That census showed the ward to be ethnically diverse, with a 53% white, 16% black, 9% asian and 10% mixed ethnicity population.\n2023 boundaries\nThe ward boundaries were changed in 2023 following a review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Princes Park ward was reformed as a single-member ward. The ward boundaries retained the eastern half of the 2004 ward, gaining a small part of the former Greenbank ward. It contains the parts of the Toxteth area, including the Granby Four Streets, Princes Road Synagogue as well as Princes Park itself.\nThe population of the ward at the 2021 census was 8,221.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2004\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Mohamed Ali (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Gideon Ben-Tovim (Lab)\n|-\n| 2006\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Gideon Ben-Tovim (Lab)\n|-\n| 2007\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"|  Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Gideon Ben-Tovim (Lab)\n|-\n| 2008\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2011\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"|  Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2012\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"|  Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2014\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2015\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2016\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2018\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Dean (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Moore (Lab)\n|-\n| 2019\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Anna Rothery (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Tomas Logan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Joanne Anderson (Lab)\n|-\n| 2021\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|Anna Rothery (Ind)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tomas Logan (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"|  Lucille Harvey (Lab)\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#FFF\"| WARD REFORMED\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"|  Lucille Harvey (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\n* Following the resignation of Cllr Tim Moore a by-election was held on 17 October 2019;
