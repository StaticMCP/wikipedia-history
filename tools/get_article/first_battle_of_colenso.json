At the time, the Boers had just surrounded the city of Ladysmith, placing them under siege.\nDescription\nWith the Boers having laid Ladysmith under siege, and trapping most of the British force in Natal there, the remainder of the British forces began to move towards Estcourt. A small detachment of the Durban Light Infantry and a naval brigade from HMS Tartar had constructed fortifications at Colenso, acting as an outpost for the British forces in the area. On 3 November, the Boers moved their artillery to the heights to the north of Colenso. They began to open fire on the British position, with the British taking no cover as they had no artillery to counter. They hastily evacuated their positions after some time, and left before Boer infantry could take the town. These forces then moved to Estcourt, leaving the Tugela River undefended, allowing the Boers to set up defensive positions there.\nReferences"
