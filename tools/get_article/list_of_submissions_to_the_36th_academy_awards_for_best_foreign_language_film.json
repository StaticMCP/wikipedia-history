The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 36th Academy Awards, fourteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Poland and the Soviet Union submitted films to the competition for the first time. Pakistan didn't submit a film again until 2013 with Zinda Bhaag being submitted. The five nominated films came from Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland and Spain.\nItaly won for the sixth time with 8½ by Federico Fellini, which also won Best Costume Design – Black-and-White, alongside nominations for Best Director, Best Story and Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen and Best Art Direction – Black-and-White.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
