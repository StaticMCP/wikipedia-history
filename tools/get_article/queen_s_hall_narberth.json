In 1970, the venue hosted Elton John’s first performance in Wales.\nHistory and building\nFrom 1912 to 1930, the building was a Cine-variety. From 1930 to 1947, it was the Victoria Cinema. In 1953, it was bought by the local community to become a community hall. The Queen’s Hall was opened on 1 Feb 1958 by the High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, Joseph Edward Gibby.\nIt is a registered charity and run by a board of trustees.
