The vice president was the first in the Mongolian presidential line of succession, becoming the new President upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president. Furthermore, according to the constitution, the vice president was the presiding officer of the State Little Khural, the standing legislative body, from 1990 to 1992.\nThe position was filled by a vote in the State Little Khural at the same time as the President of the Mongolian People's Republic. Radnaasümbereliin Gonchigdorj was the only person to occupy this office. Along with the Little Khural, the position was abolished after the ratification of the 1992 Constitution of Mongolia.\nHistory\nAfter the 1990 Democratic Revolution, the People's Great Khural amended the Constitution of the MPR, legalized opposition parties, and created the office of the President of the MPR and the State Little Khuralduring its parliamentary session in May 1990. According to the Constitution, the vice president is also the ex officio of the State Little Khural, similar to that of the Vice President of the United States. The first free multi-party elections were held on 29 June 1990. Fifty seats for the newly established Little Khural were allocated through proportional representation of the total party vote.\nThe People's Great Khural first convened on September 3 and elected the president (MPRP), the vice president (MSDP), the prime minister (MPRP), and the fifty members of the Little Khural from its 430 members. Radnaasümbereliin Gonchigdorj, a member of the Mongolian Social Democratic Party, was appointed as the vice president and served until the abolishment of the position in 1992.\nA new constitution transitioning Mongolia to a market economy and a representative democracy was ratified and put into effect on February 12. This new constitution abolished the office of the vice president and the Little Khural, in favour of a new unicameral legislature called the State Great Khural. Thereby, making Gonchigdorj the first and last person to serve as the vice president of the MPR.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Political Party\n! rowspan=2| Election\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2| President\n|-\n!
