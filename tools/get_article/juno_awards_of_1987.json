      "text": "# Juno Awards of 1987\n\nThe Juno Awards of 1987, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 2 November 1987 in Toronto at a ceremony in the O'Keefe Centre. Howie Mandel was the host for the ceremonies, which were broadcast on CBC Television.\nThis was the last year the Juno presentations were held in the latter part of the calendar year. CARAS, which was responsible for the awards, chose to revert to an early-year scheduling, therefore no Junos were awarded 1988 but were rescheduled to March 1989.\nNominees and winners\nCanadian
