To illustrate their point, anti-war films often present the effects of war—such as destruction, suffering, war trauma, casualties, war crimes, war's impact on the environment or on children, or the excesses of war—in a negative manner. Though many anti-war films make this negative depiction explicit and clear for the audience to understand, some are more subtle in delivering their anti-war messaging (such as making the ostensibly good side as brutal as their enemies), or may use parody and black comedy to satirize wars and conflicts.\nWhile most anti-war films use real historical or then-ongoing conflicts—commonly modern wars in recent memory that the intended audience is familiar with or understands, such as World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, or the war on terror—as their settings to criticize those wars, their casus belli, or their effects, others use hypothetical conflicts (e.g. World War III), fictional wars involving fictional countries, or even a conflict in a fictional universe, an alternate history, or the far future. Some anti-war films may not depict front line or battlefield conflict at all, and instead present anti-war messaging through depictions of the rear, military hierarchy, military operations other than war, military misconduct or corruption, the military–industrial complex, refugees and survivors, or the aftermath of wars, ranging from the immediate post-war recovery to the post-apocalypse.\nWithin this category of anti-war films that choose to de-emphasize the actual battlefield conflicts of war, some films specifically focus on communicating pacifist ideologies by emphasizing war's devastating effects on innocent civilians and the lands in which war is waged. This niche of anti-war films often utilizes visceral imagery that confronts viewers with the tragic realities of war's presence in beloved main characters' lives, such as by depicting main characters' homes being decimated by war bombs, main characters being forced to contend with the uncomfortable, off-putting presence of soldiers in their city, and characters dealing with the emotional toll of witnessing war's violence in their own life or the lives of their loved ones. According to film researcher Lindsay Smith, by forcing viewers to see war through the lens of its devastation on beloved fictional characters, these anti-war films make it accessible for audiences--regardless of their knowledge or experience with war's effects in the real world--to empathize with war's victims since emphasizing the human costs of war can make its violence feel more real and personal.\nAnti-war films have sometimes been accused of anti-Americanism by the American right wing. These accusations can be somewhat attributed to the fact that there are definitive examples of modern anti-war films that are specifically motivated by criticisms of American militarism in particular rather than the violence of war as a whole. One such prominent example is ''Howl's Moving Castle'', a Japanese anti-war film made by pacifist Hayao Miyazaki as a direct criticism of the Iraq War, which was a war waged by US-led forces in Iraq as part of America's ongoing War on Terror in response to 9/11. Miyazaki declared that he expected and intended for ''Howl's Moving Castle'' to fail with American audiences due to its direct critique of America's military actions in Iraq, thus framing the film as seemingly un-American in its anti-war commentary.\nCriticism\nSeveral filmmakers and critics have been quoted as stating that \"there is no such thing as an anti-war film\", first attributed to François Truffaut. This school of criticism argues that cinema is inherently \"an inadequate medium through which to convey the horrors of conflict\" and that any such portrayal of combat and violence will always glorify warfare on some level, even if only through the death of the author. Supposedly failed anti-war films in this regard include Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan; The former was decried as \"another goddamn recruiting film\" by Samuel Fuller, while the latter was criticized by Toby Miller as legitimizing the United States as the military savior of the world.\nList of anti-war films\nThe following is a list of anti-war films.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Film\n!data-sort-type=\"number\"|Year\n!Ref(s)\n|-\n|1917\n|2019\n|\n|-\n|All Quiet on the Western Front\n|1930, 1979, 2022\n|\n|-\n|Aman\n|1967\n|\n|-\n|Amazing Grace and Chuck\n|1987\n|\n|-\n|The Americanization of Emily\n|1964\n|\n|-\n|American Sniper\n|2014\n|\n|-\n|Apocalypse Now\n|1979\n|\n|-\n|Barefoot Gen\n|1983\n|\n|-\n|The Battle of Algiers\n|1966\n|\n|-\n|Beyond Treason\n|2002\n|\n|-\n|Beasts of No Nation\n|2015\n|\n|-\n|Breaker Morant\n|1980\n|\n|-\n|Das Boot\n|1981\n|\n|-\n|Born on the Fourth of July\n|1989\n|\n|-\n|The Boy with Green Hair\n|1948\n|\n|-\n|Breaking The Silence: Truth and Lies in The War On Terror\n|2003\n|\n|-\n|The Bridge on the River Kwai\n|1957\n|\n|-\n|A Bridge Too Far\n|1977\n|\n|-\n|Die Brücke\n|1959\n|\n|-\n|The Burmese Harp\n|1956\n|-\n|Les Carabiniers\n|1963\n|\n|-\n|Casualties of War\n|1989\n|\n|-\n|Catch-22\n|1970\n|\n|-\n|Civilization\n|1916\n|\n|-\n|Come and See\n|1985\n|\n|-\n|Coming Home\n|1978\n|\n|-\n|Les Croix de bois\n|1932\n|\n|-\n|Cross of Iron\n|1977\n|\n|-\n|The Day the Earth Stood Still\n|1951\n|\n|-\n|The Deer Hunter\n|1978\n|\n|-\n|''Don't Cry, It's Only Thunder\n|1982\n|\n|-\n|Dr. Strangelove\n|1964\n|\n|-\n|Empire of the Sun\n|1987\n|\n|-\n|The Enemy Below\n|1957\n|\n|-\n|L'Ennemi Intime\n|2007\n|\n|-\n|Escalation\n|1968\n|\n|-\n| Fahrenheit 9/11\n|2004\n|\n|-\n|Fail Safe\n|2000\n|\n|-\n|Fail-Safe\n|1964\n|\n|-\n|Fear and Desire\n|1953\n|\n|-\n|Field of Honor\n|1986\n|\n|-\n|Fires on the Plain\n|1959\n|\n|-\n|First Blood\n|1982\n|\n|-\n|Flags of Our Fathers\n|2006\n|\n|-\n|The Forgotten Battle\n|2020\n|\n|-\n|Forrest Gump\n|1994\n|\n|-\n|Fort Apache\n|1948\n|\n|-\n|Fort Graveyard\n|1965\n|\n|-\n|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\n|1921\n|\n|-\n|Free State of Jones\n|2016\n|\n|-\n|F.T.A.\n|1972\n|\n|-\n|Friend of the World\n|2020\n|\n|-\n|Friendly Fire\n|1979\n|\n|-\n|The Frozen War\n|1973\n|\n|-\n|Full Metal Jacket\n|1987\n|\n|-\n|Gallipoli\n|1981\n|\n|-\n|Gardens of Stone\n|1987\n|\n|-\n|Godzilla\n|1954\n|\n|-\n|Go Tell the Spartans\n|1977\n|\n|-\n|Goodbye Billy\n|1971\n|\n|-\n|Grace Is Gone\n|2007\n|\n|-\n|The Great War\n|1959\n|\n|-\n|La Grande Illusion\n|1937\n|\n|-\n|Grave of the Fireflies\n|1988\n|\n|-\n|The Great Dictator\n|1940\n|\n|-\n|The Greatest Beer Run Ever\n|2022\n|\n|-\n|Greenery Will Bloom Again\n|2014\n|\n|-\n|Greetings\n|1968\n|\n|-\n|The Glassworker\n| 2024\n|\n|-\n|The Ground Truth\n| 2006\n|\n|-\n|Hacksaw Ridge\n|2016\n|\n|-\n|Hair\n|1979\n|\n|-\n|Hamburger Hill\n|1987\n|\n|-\n|Hearts and Minds\n|1974\n|\n|-\n|Hedd Wyn\n|1992\n|\n|-\n|Hell Is for Heroes\n|1962\n|\n|-\n|Hell on Earth\n|1928\n|\n|-\n|A Hidden Life\n|2019\n|\n|-\n|Hiroshima mon amour\n|1959\n|\n|-\n|Hijacking Catastrophe\n|2004\n|\n|-\n|Honor Guard\n|2007\n|\n|-\n|Hotel Rwanda\n|2004\n|\n|-\n|How I Won the War\n|1967\n|\n|-\n|Howl's Moving Castle\n|2004\n|\n|-\n|The Human Bullet\n|1968\n|\n|-\n|The Human Condition\n|1959-1961\n|\n|-\n|Iluminados por el fuego\n|1989\n|\n|-\n|In the Valley of Elah\n|2007\n|\n|-\n|Innocent Voices\n|2004\n|\n|-\n|J'accuse\n|1919\n|\n|-\n|Jacob's Ladder\n|1990\n|\n|-\n|Johnny Got His Gun\n|1971\n|\n|-\n|Jojo Rabbit\n|2019\n|\n|-\n|Journey's End\n|1930\n|\n|-\n|Joyeux Noël\n|2005\n|\n|-\n|Kameradschaft\n|1931\n|\n|-\n|Kanal\n|1956\n|\n|-\n|Kelly's Heroes\n|1970\n|\n|-\n|King and Country\n|1964\n|\n|-\n|King of Hearts\n|1966\n|\n|-\n|Letters from Iwo Jima\n|2006\n|\n|-\n|Lions for Lambs\n|2007\n|\n|-\n|Little Big Man\n|1970\n|\n|-\n|Lord of War\n|2005\n|\n|-\n|Love and Honor\n|2013\n|\n|-\n|Major Dundee\n|1965\n|\n|-\n|Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media\n|1992\n|\n|-\n|Many Wars Ago\n|1970\n|\n|-\n|M*A*S*H\n|1970\n|\n|-\n|Maudite soit la guerre\n|1914\n|\n|-\n|Memphis Belle\n|1990\n|\n|-\n|The Memory of Justice\n|1978\n|\n|-\n|Men in War\n|1957\n|\n|-\n|Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\n|1983\n|\n|-\n|Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\n|1969\n|\n|-\n|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\n|1984\n|\n|-\n|Neighbours\n|1952\n|\n|-\n|No Man's Land\n|2001\n|\n|-\n|None but the Brave''\n|1965\n|\n|-\n|Occupation 101: Voices of the Silenced Majority\n|2006\n|\n|-\n|Off Limits\n|1988\n|\n|-\n|Oh!
