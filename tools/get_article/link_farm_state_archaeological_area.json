The site is most widely known for the stone artifacts found during excavations in the late 19th century.\nSite features\nThe site features include two substructure platform mounds, three conical burial mounds, a loaf shaped mound, and a central plaza area measuring  east to west and  north to south. The  site was acquired by the State of Tennessee in 1974 and is now preserved as part of the Johnsonville State Historic Park.\nArtifacts\nThe site is mostly known for being the location where the \"Duck River cache\" of chert artifacts was discovered in December 1894 in a low hillock at the site. In March 1895 the same but slightly deeper location was also the site of the discovery of a paired male and female set of Mississippian sandstone statues nicknamed \"Adam\" and \"Eve\". The male statue is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the female statue has been lost. The Duck River cache was acquired by the McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture in Knoxville, Tennessee and is now on permanent display.\nFile:Mississippian Figure MET DP100985.jpg|Front view of \"Adam\", statue\nFile:Mississippian Figure MET DP261003.jpg|Oblique view of \"Adam\"\nFile:Mississippian Figure MET DP346458.jpg|Side view of \"Adam\"\nFile:Mississippian Figure MET DP261007.jpg|Rear view of the \"Adam\" statue\nSee also\n* Angel Mounds\n* Annis Mound\n* Chucalissa\n* Mound Bottom\n* Obion Mounds\n* Sellars Farm site\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://tnstateparks.com/parks/johnsonville Johnsonville State Historic Park Official site]\n*"
