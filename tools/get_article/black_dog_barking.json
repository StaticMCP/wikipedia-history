No Glory. The album was released in Europe and Australia on 20 May 2013, and worldwide on 21 May 2013.\nBackground\nIt was announced in November 2011 through their official Facebook page that since mid-2011 the band had been working on a new album. The album's name, Black Dog Barking, was announced in early February 2013. Following this, the band released the following statement:\nThe Album was released on 21 May 2013 via Roadrunner. Black Dog Barking is Airbourne's first full-length album not to feature the band on the cover art. The artwork was once again created by Australian artists The Sharp Brothers, who also did the cover artwork for No Guts. No Glory. According to David Roads, the idea behind the album title was, to use the Black Dog as a metaphor for the band's ability to break the rules, especially not to care for db limits.  At the end of 2013 Airbourne toured Europe, supported - amongst others - by the Swedish band Corroded. The song \"Back in the Game\" was featured in Season 2, Episode 3 \"Fire and Ice\" of Cobra Kai, while “Live it Up” was featured in the NHL 14 soundtrack.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Joel O'Keeffe - lead vocals, lead guitar\n* David Roads - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n* Justin Street - bass, backing vocals\n* Ryan O'Keeffe - drums\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
