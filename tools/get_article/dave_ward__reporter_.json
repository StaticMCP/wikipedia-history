He was an anchor of the weekday 6:00 pm newscast on KTRK-TV's Eyewitness News in Houston, Texas for more than 50 years. He joined KTRK-TV in 1966 as reporter and photographer and was promoted to his final position as weekday evening anchor in 1968, which he held until 2017.\nCareer\nWard began his career at KGKB radio while attending Tyler Junior College (class of 1960).\nThree years later, he began working at WACO-FM as a staff announcer. Later in 1963, Ward became the first full-time reporter at KNUZ radio, located in Houston. In 1966, he was hired on the spot at KTRK-TV:\nHe was hired as an on the street reporter and photographer in November 1966 and in 1967 was assigned to anchor KTRK's 7 a.m. newscast and a year later, he was promoted to co-anchor of the weekday 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. weekday newscasts. In December 2014, Ward announced he was leaving the weeknight 10 p.m. broadcast, but would still continue to co-anchor the weekday 6 p.m. newscast with Gina Gaston. In June 2016, Ward was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for having the longest tenure of any news anchor in the world at the same station in the same market. On August 4, 2016, Ward announced on the 6 p.m. news that he would be leaving KTRK at the end of the year. Soon after, Ward told the Houston Chronicle he was leaving against his will and did not want to retire, even after multiple falls in the newsroom left his health capricious. Ultimately, the station and Ward agreed to not renew his contract and that he would leave in December 2016.  Prior to that date, another health scare delayed his departure. Ward underwent an open heart surgery in December, and the managers at the station decided to let Ward have a final newscast appearance on May 2, 2017.\nWard, a personal friend of Marvin Zindler, helped Zindler obtain his position at Channel 13, by urging the station to hire him after Zindler had been fired from his job at the sheriff's department.\nIn May 2019, Ward published his memoir, “Good Evening, Friends.” The title reflects the salutation he used to begin each newscast at KTRK. The City of Houston honored Ward's 50 years at KTRK with an honorary street sign outside the ABC 13 studios. The marker says \"Honorary Dave Ward Place.\"\nPositions and achievements\nIn addition to his television and radio career, he has played an active role in establishing Houston Crime Stoppers, currently serving as President of the local Easter Seals Society, and chairing the Public Affairs Advisory Board of the Houston Business Council.\nVideo\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.davewardshouston.com Dave Ward official site]\n* [http://abc13.com/about/newsteam/dave-ward/ Biography by ABC 13]\n* [http://htexas.com/columns/good-evening-friends-im-dave-ward-local-tv-anchor-celebrates-40-years-of-delivering-the-news Biography by H Texas magazine]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070914035033/http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=action13&id=5519844 Ward's posthumous report on Marvin Zindler]"
