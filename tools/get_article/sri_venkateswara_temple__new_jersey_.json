The temple is 11,000 square feet.\nHistory\nIn 1989, a group of practicing Hindus in areas surrounding New Jersey established the Hindu Temple and Cultural Society of USA Inc. (HTCS). In February 1992, the HTCS purchased land in Bridgewater, New Jersey in hopes of building a traditional stone temple. Devotees began engaging in regularly scheduled spiritual activities and worship in the building previously built on the purchased land, as the planning for a new temple continued. In 1995, the ground breaking ceremony of the new temple was performed. In May 1996, a stone laying ceremony was conducted by Chinna Jeeyar Swami and the temple construction began according to the Vastu Shastras. In 1998, consecration ceremony was conducted by Chinna Jeeyar Swami and other priests and the temple was inaugurated.\nIn 2004, the temple applied to the Bridgewater zoning board to expand their facilities. In 2009, after a five year legal battle, the board approved a scaled down version of the plan.\nDeities\nThere are 16 shrines within the temple which include sacred images of Venkateswara, Sridevi, Bhudevi, Garuda, Ganesha, Ambika, Nandi, Siva Lingam, Ayyappa, Subrahmanya, Satyanarayana, Durga, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Lakshmi Narayan, Radha Krishna, Rama, Anjaneya, Navagraha and Dhwajastambham.\nReferences"
