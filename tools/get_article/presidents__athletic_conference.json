Of its 12 member schools, all private, liberal arts institutions of higher learning, nine are located in Western Pennsylvania. The other three are located in adjacent areas, historically tied to Western Pennsylvania—Appalachian Ohio, Northeast Ohio, and the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia.\nHistory\nThe PAC was founded in 1955 by the presidents of Western Reserve University (1955–1967, operating athletically as Adelbert College from 1967 to 1970), Case Institute of Technology (1955–1970), John Carroll University (1955–1989) and Wayne State University (1955–1967). Unlike other conferences of the time, the PAC was designed to be supervised by the presidents of the institutions rather than the athletic directors. Member institutions were to admit athletes on the same academic standards as other students and award scholarships based only on academic achievement or need.\nBy 1958, the PAC expanded east to include Allegheny College (1958–1984, 2022–), Bethany College (1958–), Thiel College (1958–) and Washington & Jefferson College (1958–). Eventually, many other member institutions joined the PAC, like Chatham University (2007–), Geneva College (2007–), Grove City College (1984–), Saint Vincent College (2006–), Thomas More College (2005–2018), Waynesburg University (1990–) and Westminster College (2000–).\nSome former PAC member institutions are Alfred University (1996–1998), Carnegie Mellon University (1968–1990), Eastern Michigan University (1962–1967) and Hiram College (1971–1989, returning in 2025). On May 31, 2017, Thomas More College (University), announced its withdrawal from the PAC at the conclusion of the 2017–18 school year.\nIn April 2019, Franciscan University, which had joined the PAC as an associate member in the newly launched conference sports of men's and women's lacrosse for the 2018–19 school year, was unveiled as the effective replacement for Thomas More. Franciscan added five sports to its PAC membership for 2019–20—women's golf, men's and women's indoor track & field, and men's and women's outdoor track & field, and became a full conference member in 2020–21.\nEffective July 1, 2022, Allegheny College rejoined the PAC after a 38-year absence spent in the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). Allegheny remains an affiliate member of the NCAC in the sport of field hockey as the PAC does not sponsor the sport.\nOn December 14, 2022, the PAC announced that it would add men's volleyball starting in 2024–25. At the time of announcement, the men's volleyball league was planned to start with six full members. Geneva, Saint Vincent, and Thiel were associate members of the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference; Bethany and Chatham were committed to adding men's volleyball in 2023–24; and Grove City was to add men's volleyball in 2024–25.\nOn June 6, 2023, the PAC announced that its future men's volleyball league would also include former full member Hiram as a single-sport member for the 2025 spring season.\nOn April 23, 2024, the PAC announced that Hiram would return to full PAC membership after an absence of 35 years. It joined for administrative purposes on July 1 of that year, coinciding with its becoming a men's volleyball associate member, but will not start conference competition in other sports until 2025–26.\nOn Sept. 9, 2024, Carnegie Mellon announced that it will leave the PAC to join the Centennial Conference as an associate football member in time for the 2025 fall season.\nOn March 25, 2025, the PAC announced that Saint Francis University would be reclassifying from the Division I ranks and the Northeast Conference and will compete in the PAC effective July 1, 2026. Saint Francis joined for administrative purposes on July 1, 2025, but will not be eligible for the NCAA tournaments until the 2029–30 academic year.\nThe headquarters is located in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania.\nTimeline\nSource:\n| nolabels = 1\n| title = Presidents' Athletic Conference\n| mark-coord  =  |label=Bethany      |label-pos  =  left   | mark  = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size=10 | label-color  = black\n| mark-coord1 =  |label1=Thiel  |label-pos1 = top   | mark1 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size1=10 | label-color1 = black\n| mark-coord2 =  |label2=Wash. & Jeff.     |label-pos2 = bottom   | mark2 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size2=10 | label-color2 = black\n| mark-coord3 =  |label3=Grove City |label-pos3 = right   | mark3 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size3=10 | label-color3 = black\n| mark-coord4 =  |label4=Waynesburg |label-pos4 = bottom  | mark4 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size4=10 | label-color4 = black\n| mark-coord5 =  |label5=Westminster |label-pos5 = left   | mark5 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size5=10 | label-color5 = black\n| mark-coord6 =  |label6=Saint Vincent |label-pos6 = bottom   | mark6 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size6=10 | label-color6 = black\n| mark-coord7 =  |label7=Chatham |label-pos7 = top   | mark7 = Blue pog.png  |mark-size7=10 | label-color7 = black\n| mark-coord8 =  |label8=Geneva |label-pos8 = top   | mark8 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size8=10 | label-color8 = black\n| mark-coord9 =  |label9=Franciscan |label-pos9 = left   | mark9 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size9=10 | label-color9 = black\n| mark-coord11 =  |label11=Case Western |label-pos11 = top   | mark11 = Gold pog.svg  |mark-size11=10 | label-color11 = black\n| mark-coord12 =  |label12=Allegheny |label-pos12= right   | mark12 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size12=10 | label-color12 = black\n| mark-coord13 =  |label13=Hiram |label-pos13 = right   | mark13 = Blue pog.svg  |mark-size13=10 | label-color13 = black\n| mark-coord14 =  |label14=Saint Francis |label-pos14 = bottom | mark14 = Green pog.svg  |mark-size14=10 | label-color14 = black\n| zoom = 7\n| caption = Location of PAC members: 10px full, 10px affiliate, and 10px future\n}}\n* 1955 – In 1955, the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC) was founded.
