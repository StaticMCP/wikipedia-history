Born in the Netherlands, he is of Moroccan descent.\nCareer\nAlmere City\nBensabouh played youth football for AFC and Almere City. He made his debut for their reserve team, Jong Almere City, on 31 March 2018, starting in a 1–0 loss in the Derde Divisie against Jong FC Volendam. On 5 May 2018, he scored his first senior goal, opening the score in a 2–0 home victory against Magreb '90. He contributed to the team's promotion to the Tweede Divisie at the end of the season, after a two-legged play-off win over JVC Cuijk.\nAhead of the 2018–19 season, Bensabouh was promoted to the first team, signing his first professional contract with the club in August 2018. He made his professional debut for Almere City in the Eerste Divisie on 20 August 2018 in a game against Jong AZ, replacing Anass Ahannach in the 86th minute. On 12 April 2019, he scored his first goal in a 3–1 league win over FC Den Bosch. Almere City qualified for promotion play-offs to the Eredivisie that season, which saw Bensabouh score his second goal for the club in the first round against Cambuur. They would however be knocked out by Cambuur after a loss in the second leg.\nOn 11 June 2019, Bensabouh signed a contract extension, keeping him at Almere City until 2022.\nTelstar\nOn 30 June 2021, Bensabouh signed a two-year contract with league rivals Telstar. He made his debut for the club on the first matchday of the season, playing 90 minutes in a 1–1 home draw against Emmen. On 22 October, he scored his first goal for Telstar in an Eerste Divisie draw against Helmond Sport.\nHe suffered a knee injury on 26 October 2021 in a KNVB Cup match against Kozakken Boys, which sidelined him for several months. On his comeback on 4 March 2022, he scored an important goal from distance to secure a 2–2 draw against TOP Oss. He scored four goals in 24 appearances in his first season at the club, which saw them finish in a disappointing 19th place in the league table.\nUnder new head coach Mike Snoei, Bensabouh grew into a key player in midfield for Telstar early in the 2022–23 season. In September 2022, he suffered a knee injury which sidelined him for several weeks. In the second half of the season, Bensabouh appeared as captain in Glynor Plet's absence. On 28 April 2023, he scored the decisive goal of a 1–0 victory against Den Bosch, keeping Telstar in the race for a spot in the promotion play-offs. The team eventually finished in ninth place, improving drastically on their performance from the previous season, albeit missing out on play-offs by five points. Bensabouh scored once in 30 appearances that season.\nQuick Boys\nOn 14 October 2024, after 15 months as a free agent, Bensabouh signed with Tweede Divisie club Quick Boys following several weeks of training with the team. He agreed to a contract lasting until 2025, with an option for an additional season. During his free agency, transfer negotiations with two Qatari clubs and Eerste Divisie side FC Den Bosch fell through.\nBensabouh made his debut for Quick Boys on 30 October, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute in a stunning 3–0 KNVB Cup victory over Eredivisie side Almere City—his former club. Three days later, on 2 November, he made his Tweede Divisie debut, appearing as a half-time substitute in a 5–0 away win against Noordwijk. He scored his first goal for the club on 15 March 2025 in a 4–1 local derby win over Katwijk.\nStyle of play\nBensabouh is a creative and versatile midfielder, capable of playing in multiple positions. He has highlighted his creative ability and strong work ethic. Additionally, he has a good understanding of the game, enabling him to assess situations on the field and anticipate the right decisions. He consistently looks forward and has an attacking mindset, and is able to deliver accurate passes both on the ground as well as through the air.\nPersonal life\nBorn in the Netherlands, Bensabouh is of Moroccan descent.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|KNVB Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Jong Almere City\n|2017–18\n|Derde Divisie\n|8||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||11||1\n|-\n|2018–19\n|Tweede Divisie\n|20||5||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||20||5\n|-\n|2019–20\n|Derde Divisie\n|3||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!31!!6!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!3!!0!!34!!6\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Almere City\n|2018–19\n|Eerste Divisie\n|18||1||0||0||2||1||20||2\n|-\n|2019–20\n|Eerste Divisie\n|25||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||25||0\n|-\n|2020–21\n|Eerste Divisie\n|13||0||1||0||0||0||14||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!56!!1!!1!!0!!2!!1!!59!!2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Telstar\n|2021–22\n|Eerste Divisie\n|23||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||24||4\n|-\n|2022–23\n|Eerste Divisie\n|29||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||30||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!52!!5!!2!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!54!!5\n|-\n|Quick Boys\n|2024–25\n|Tweede Divisie\n|18||2||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||21||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!157!!14!!6!!0!!5!!1!!168!!15\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
