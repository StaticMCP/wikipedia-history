Though her path was full of obstacles, she rose like a phoenix and resurrected from the ashes. She regrouped various factions of the Maratha army. Like a coveted general, she guided two brave generals, Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav in a series of battles against Aurangzeb. In a period of seven years, Tararani defeated most of the Mughal generals to recapture the major portion of the Maratha Empire. Aurangzeb realized that he was fighting a losing battle. Aurangzeb – who came down to Dakkhan with a vow to crush the Marathas – finally died in Dakkhan. Warrior queen Tararani fulfilled her pledge. She upheld the glory and power of the saffron flag like never before.\nCast\n* Swarda Thigale as Maratha Empress Tarabai\n* Yatin Karyekar as Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb\n* Amol Kolhe as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (Cameo)\n* Sangram Samel as Chhatrapati Rajaram\n* Rohit Deshmukh\n* Amit Deshmukh\n* Dipti Bhagwat as Yesubai Bhonsale\n* Ravindra Kulkarni\n* Anand Kale\n* Kiran Dange\n* Krushna Rajshekhar as Jankibai\n* Anant Jog\n* Apurva Nemlekar as Keladi Chennamma\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.sonyliv.com/shows/swarajya-saudamini-tararani-1700000818 Swarajya Saudamini Tararani] at SonyLIV"
