It was the work of Earl William Anderson, a Pan Am airline captain, who flew the prototype on 24 April 1969. By 1978, 200 sets of kits for the plane had been sold, and 100 Kingfishers were reported to be under construction. The aircraft is a shoulder-wing monoplane with a flying boat hull and outrigger pontoons. On land, it uses retractable tailwheel undercarriage.  The single engine with a tractor propeller is mounted in a nacelle above the wing.  Some builders utilize the wings from a Piper Cub rather than making their own.\nThe planes were later marketed by Richard Warner Aviation before becoming the Wings Unlimited Kingfisher in the late 1990s. A variant with improved performance is known as the 'Super Kingfisher'.\nSpecifications (original configuration)\n|prime units?=imp\n|genhide=\n|crew=1\n|capacity=1 passenger\n|length m=\n|length ft=23\n|length in=6\n|span m=\n|span ft=36\n|span in=1\n|height m=\n|height ft=8\n|height in=0\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=1032\n|gross weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=1600\n|fuel capacity=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Lycoming O-235\n|eng1 type=four-cylinder horizontally-opposed engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=115\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=fixed pitch\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=6\n|prop dia in=0\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=120\n|max speed kts=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=85\n|cruise speed note=at\n|stall speed mph=45\n|range km=\n|range miles=200\n|range note=with maximum fuel\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=10000\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=500–600\n|more performance=*Takeoff run to 50 ft (m):\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n* [http://www.anderson-kingfisher.com/specifications.php?show=performance anderson-kingfisher.com]"
