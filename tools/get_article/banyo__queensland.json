This history includes the recent preservation of an Aboriginal Bora Ring. The areas of Nudgee and Nudgee Beach border on the Boondall Wetlands, which is protected by the Brisbane City Council.\nBanyo has vastly increased the number of its business and industrial parks in recent years due to its close proximity to Brisbane Airport and the nearby Port of Brisbane.

It was not until 1897 when it officially adopted the name Banyo, an Aboriginal word which means a hill or ridge. The name was chosen by the Secretary for Railways James Dickson, and was also given to the Banyo railway station.

By the 1990s the hall was in a dilapidated condition and in May 1988 a public meeting voted to demolish the hall, which took place in October 1988 and the land was sold in 2001.
