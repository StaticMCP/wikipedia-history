He was a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy during World War II, from 1942 to 1945, and thereafter served as a United States Naval Reserve Lieutenant Commander. After law school he was in private practice in San Diego, California, from 1940 to 1941. He resumed his legal practice after servicing in World War II in San Diego, becoming one of two original founders of Procopio Law in 1946. During this time he specialized on business, probate and corporate law. Governor Pat Brown appointed him to the Municipal Court of San Diego in 1959. He was a judge of the Municipal Court of San Diego from 1959 to 1964, and on the Superior Court of San Diego County from 1964 to 1968.\nFederal judicial service\nOn January 29, 1968, Schwartz was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of California vacated by Judge James Marshall Carter. Schwartz was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 28, 1968, and received his commission the same day. He served as Chief Judge from 1969 to 1982, assuming senior status on March 26, 1982, and serving in that capacity until his death on March 22, 2000, in San Diego.\nHonor\nThe Edward J.
