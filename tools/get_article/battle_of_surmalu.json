It lasted from October 24–30, 1920. The sides involved were the First Republic of Armenia, which was commanded by Drastamat Kanayan, and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey with Kurdish volunteers.\nBackground\nThe Turks had launched an offensive into the Oltu district, pushing the poorly-equipped Armenian forces backward; Sarikamish was captured without much of a fight. The only fronts after that were the Surmalu (Iğdır) front, and the line of defense at Kars. The First Republic of Armenia had appointed Drastamat Kanayan to be in main command of the defense of the front.\nFirst Turkish Offensive\nOn October 24, a significant Turkish attack on Surmalu began before dawn, with the 34th Regiment targeting Iğdır, the district seat, as well as the Markara and Karakala bridges that connect Yerevan and Etchmiadzin. Operations were carried out simultaneously in Kiulluk-Charukhchi, Sultanabad-Igdir, and Dashburun-Karakoy. Despite Dro's expedition defeating attacks from Sultanabad and Orgov, the struggle for the Araxes bridges lasted three days.\nSecond Turkish Offensive\nOn the second day, Armenian armored vehicles from Kanaker joined Kuro Tarkhanian's group, breaching Turkish isolation in Igdir despite heavy machine-gun fire. Colonel Tarkhanian lost half of his 260 soldiers in harsh close-combat near Dalikdash before Turkish forces left on October 26. Meanwhile, the Turkish 11th Caucasus Division attacked the Karakala bridge but was unable to dislodge the defenders. They burned the bridge before fleeing. Colonel Khudabashian distinguished himself in these battles, driving the Turks and Kurds toward Kulp, up the slopes of Mount Ararat, and into the Bartoghi Mountains along the old Russo-Turkish frontier with the assistance of Colonel Tarkhanian's men and Lieutenant Colonel Halberian's newly formed 10th Infantry Regiment. Dro's invading army established bases from the Karakala bridge to Verin and Nerkin Charukhchi, Yaidji, Khoshkhabar, the Igdir-Khalfalu road, Sultanabad, Mount Gasimtach, Dalikdash, Karakoyunlu, Dashburun, and , constituting the battle.\nAftermath\nWith the loyalty of the Armenian soldiers to their officers, the Armenians enjoyed a victory at Surmalu. Although the Armenians would abandon their positions at Surmalu later on due to the Turkish capture of Kars, the two-day battle denied the Turks entry into the Surmalu region temporarily.\nReferences"
