Florida voters chose four representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nFlorida was won by Rutherford B. Hayes, the governor of Ohio (R-Ohio), running with Representative William A. Wheeler, with 50.99% of the vote, against Samuel J. Tilden, the former governor of New York (D–New York), running with Thomas A. Hendricks, the governor of Indiana and future vice president, with 49.01% of the popular vote.\nFlorida, along with South Carolina and Louisiana, was one of the states affected by the Compromise of 1877. Had Tilden won the state, he would have won the election.\nThis would be the final time a Republican presidential candidate would carry Florida until 1928.\nResults\nSee also\n* 1876 United States House of Representatives elections in Florida\n* 1876 Florida gubernatorial election\nReferences"
