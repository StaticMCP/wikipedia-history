He held positions of hyōbu-kyō (chief military officer) and sangi (associate counselor).\nShōtoku placed her imperial bodyguards under the command of Kurajimaro.\nIn 764, Kurajimaro was a leader of forces opposing Fujiwara no Nakamaro, also known as Emi no Oshikatsu. Nakamaro and others unsuccessfully plotted with Emperor Junnin against retired Empress Kōken and the monk Dōkyō resulting in a military confrontation known as Fujiwara no Nakamaro Rebellion.\nAfter stability was restored, Kurajimaro was placed in charge of the party escorting Emperor Junnin to Awaji province.\nGenealogy\nKurajimaro was the ninth son of Fujiwara no Umakai.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric and Käthe Roth.
