The rebels ambushed and routed the British.\nThe battle was an ambush of a British force of 400 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Walpole, containing one troop of regular cavalry (the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards) and militia and yeomanry auxiliaries. They were ambushed in a narrow defile by United Irish rebels. Walpole and 100 men were killed, the rest, throwing away their weapons and uniforms, fled. The regular dragoons made an attempt to fight back but they were in a bad place for cavalry so they withdrew. This defeat allowed three cannon to be captured which were subsequently used against British troops at the battle of Arklow. The rebels were unable to take Arklow however. The day after the engagement at Tubberneering, the United Irishmen tried to take New Ross in the south of county Wexford but were repulsed at a heavy cost.\nReferences"
