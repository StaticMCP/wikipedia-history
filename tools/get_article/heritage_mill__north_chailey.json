In 1844 she was moved to Newhaven, replacing a mill that had burnt down. She was made redundant by the erection of a steam mill and was moved again, this time to her current location at Chailey, replacing a post mill. This second move was done by Medhurst, the Lewes millwright. Heritage Mill'' was working by wind until 1911.\nIn 1928 the mill was tailwinded, and the cap and sails were blown off. The mill was restored in 1933. The work was done by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights. A few years later, the mill was tailwinded again, and this time the windshaft snapped between the Brake Wheel and canister. Neve's installed the windshaft from Punnetts Town Windmill, which had been partly dismantled in 1935.\nDescription\nHeritage Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. It has a Kentish-style cap winded by a fantail. When working it had four Patent sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The only machinery remaining is the clasp arm great spur wheel.\nMillers\n*John Arnold 1841(Hammingden)\n*Bollen 1844 (Newhaven)\n*Messrs Stone & Towner – 1864 (Newhaven)\n*Godley\n*Thomas Comber\n*H K Wallis 1870\n*A G Sparkes 1874\n*Lockyer 1878–1911\nReferences for above:-\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [http://theweald.org/bk.asp?BookId=wind900&xid=A&xnm=1 Online version]\nExternal links\n*[http://www.windmillworld.com/millid/2627.htm Windmill World] Page on Chailey Windmill.\n*[http://www.sussexmillsgroup.org.uk/open1.htm#chailey Visiting information]"
