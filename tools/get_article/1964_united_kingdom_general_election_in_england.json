In the post-war era, this remains one of the two elections (the other being the 1950 election) where the party winning a majority in the House of Commons not winning a plurality of seats in England- rather, the party which lost the general election won a majority of seats in England.\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total vote\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Conservative\n|262\n|53\n|10,106,028\n|44.1%\n|5.9%\n|-\n|Labour\n|246\n|53\n|9,982,360\n|43.5%\n|0.1%\n|-\n|Liberal\n|3\n|\n|2,775,752\n|12.1%\n|5.8%\n|}\n|51.27}}\n|48.14}}\n|0.58}}}}\nReferences\n* Barberis, Peter (September 2007). \"Introduction: The 1964 General Election—the 'Not Quite, But' and 'But Only Just' Election\".
