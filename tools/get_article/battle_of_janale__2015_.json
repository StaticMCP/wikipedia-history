Al Shabaab later named the suicide bomber in a propaganda video as Abdullah Ahmed Omar, a former Somali soldier who defected to Al Shabaab in 2014. Following that, a team of heavily armed fighters entered the breach and attacked the troops inside. The attack was launched to commemorate one anniversary after the group's former leader Ahmed Abdi Godane's death, who was killed in a U.S. drone airstrike in the previous year.\nReferences"
