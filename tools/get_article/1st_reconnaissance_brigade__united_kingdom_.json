Brigadier Royal Armoured Corps, British Army of the Rhine would become 'Commander Screening Force' on mobilisation.\nThe force's objective, if mobilised, was to hold off a soviet frontal invasion for as long as possible until the 1st and 4th Armoured Divisions could be moved into position.  If mobilised, the brigade would control al the units of the division in the reconnaissance role and providing a reconnaissance/screening force.  On mobilisation, the force would have consisted:\n* Brigadier, I (BR) Corps Royal Armoured Corps (Commander Screening Force)\n** Queen's Dragoon Guards, at Northampton Barracks, Wolfenbüttel (under command of 1st (UK) Armoured Division during peacetime)\n** 16th/5th The Queen's Royal Lancers, Harewood Barracks, Herford (under command of 4th Armoured Division during peacetime)\n** No. 664 Squadron, Army Air Corps, at Saint George's Barracks, Minden (under command of Commander Aviation BAOR during peacetime)\nIn 1992 following the disbandment of the British Army of the Rhine, the force HQ was disbanded.\nis pictured during a firepower demonstration on Salisbury Plain.]]\nReconnaissance Brigade\nThe 1st Reconnaissance Brigade was established on 1 April 1997.\nThe brigade might have been assigned to HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps.  Following the 2003 reorganisation of the Army under 'LANDmark', HQ Theatre Troops was formed to oversee the specialist brigades of the army. The brigade soon joined HQ Theatre Troops, which it would remain under until disbanding in 2005-06, following the Future Army Structure programme.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n* Ministry of Defence, ''Staff Officer's Handbook Number 71038, D/DGD&D/18/35/54, 1999.\n* James Tanner, The British Army since 2000'', 2014 Osprey Publishing, Oxford, United Kingdom. .\n*"
