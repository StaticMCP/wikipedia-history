He went to high school in Perkinston, Mississippi and graduated from Perkinston Junior College. He enlisted as a seaman in the United States Navy in 1941 and retired with rank of lieutenant commander in 1946. During his service in World War II, he lost his right forearm to a grenade accident while training in the South Pacific in 1944.\nHe studied law at Santa Clara University School of Law and at the University of Houston, and then did some post-graduate studies at MIT, from which he earned a M.S. in industrial management. He was a practicing attorney.\nPollock served in the Alaska Territorial Legislature from 1953 to 1955. He later served in the Alaska Senate from 1961 to 1963 and 1965–1966; and was elected as a Republican to the Ninetieth and Ninety-first Congresses (January 3, 1967 – January 3, 1971), being the first Republican elected to Congress from Alaska. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1970 to the Ninety-second Congress, but rather was an unsuccessful candidate for Republican  nomination for Governor of Alaska. Pollock was also a past president of the National Rifle Association of America.\nFrom 1998 until his death in January 2011, Pollock was a resident of Arlington, Virginia.\nElectoral history\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ Alaska's at-large congressional district: Results 1966&ndash;1968\n!|Year\n!\n!|Republican\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|Democrat\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n|-\n|1966\n|\n| |\n| align=\"right\" |34,040\n| |\n|\n| |\n| align=\"right\" |31,867\n| |\n|-\n|1968\n|\n| |\n| align=\"right\" |43,577\n| |\n|\n| |\n| align=\"right\" |36,785\n| |\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://100years.akleg.gov/bio.php?id=1381 Howard Pollock] at ''100 Years of Alaska's Legislature''"
