Their designation are done by presidential decrees and executive orders, acts of congress (or by their predecessors) and the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP).\nBackground\nPresidential Decree No. 105, issued in 1973 defines national shrines as sites associated with significant events in the lives of great and eminent leaders of the nation, such as sites of their birth, exile, imprisonment and/ or death.  While this definition provides a foundational understanding, it could be expanded to encompass a broader range of historical and cultural significance, which have extended to military sites and battlefields.\nRA 10066, sec. 22 reinforces the protection of  national shrines (as with other declared cultural property) by prohibiting the renaming of sites unless a written approval by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, and only after due hearing on the matter. This measure ensures that these historical sites retain their original identities and the sacredness of the site.\nThe NHCP plays a pivotal role in preserving and managing national shrines. The commission's board oversees the declaration of these sites and ensures their protection. It is of note that many national shrines have been declared by Republic Acts.\nHowever, it's important to note that military memorials and battle monuments designated as national shrines fall under the purview of the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office (PVAO), operating within the Department of National Defense. Moreover, local government units often play a significant role in the establishment, maintenance, and preservation of national shrines. A notable example is the Melchora (Tandang Sora) Aquino National Shrine, which was developed through the initiative and efforts of the local government.\nPrivileges and Protections of declared National Historical shrines\nThe privileges and protections to National Historical Shrines are as follows\nPrivileges\n* Identification, maintenance, restoration, conservation, preservation and protection of shrines\n* Collection of fees for the use of the NHCP's resources and for technical services rendered, as well as entrance fees to its Shrines\nProtections\n* Protection from modification, alteration, destruction, construction or real estate development, which includes its buffer zones, without written permission from the NHCP\n* Prohibition and fines for desecration of national shrines by disturbing their peace and serenity through digging, excavating, defacing, causing unnecessary noise, and committing unbecoming acts within their premises.\nDeclared National Historical Shrines in the Philippines\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Image\n!Official National Historical Shrine/ National Shrine name\n!Description\n!Location\n!Legal Basis\n!Year declared\n|-\n|\n|Shrine of Freedom\n(Dambana ng Kalayaan)\n|Declares Fort Santiago as Shrine of Freedom.
