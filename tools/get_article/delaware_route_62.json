The route  runs from DE&nbsp;2 and the southern terminus of DE&nbsp;41 in Prices Corner east to a dead end near Newport; however, DE&nbsp;62 signage ends at the DE&nbsp;4 intersection. The road runs through suburban areas along Newport Gap Pike and Boxwood Road, meeting the DE&nbsp;141 freeway at an interchange. The Newport Gap Pike portion of road was built as a state highway by 1925 and became part of DE&nbsp;41 by 1936. Boxwood Road was improved in 1946. DE&nbsp;62 was assigned to its current alignment by 1981.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;62 heads southeast from DE&nbsp;2 (Kirkwood Highway) on Newport Gap Pike, a two-lane undivided road. Newport Gap Pike continues northwest past this intersection as DE&nbsp;41. The road passes west of Prices Corner Shopping Center and intersects Old Capitol Trail as it heads through suburban residential and commercial developments, crossing the Wilmington and Western Railroad and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line at-grade. DE&nbsp;62 passes more development and reaches the community of Belvedere, where it turns into a divided highway and comes to a ramp from southbound DE&nbsp;141.\nAt this point, the route turns east onto Boxwood Road, a four-lane divided highway, with Newport Gap Pike continuing south to provide access to southbound DE&nbsp;141. DE&nbsp;62 passes over the DE&nbsp;141 freeway and intersects Centerville Road, which provides access to and from northbound DE&nbsp;141. Past this intersection, the road becomes two lanes and undivided, passing to the south of an Amazon fulfillment center and to the north of residential subdivisions. DE&nbsp;62 continues through more residential neighborhoods, passing to the north of the Conrad Schools of Science, and reaches an intersection with DE&nbsp;4 (Maryland Avenue/Newport Pike), where DE&nbsp;62 signage ends. The route officially continues east on Middleboro Road through more neighborhoods, intersecting South Dupont Road before coming to a dead end. DE&nbsp;62 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 23,750&nbsp;vehicles at the intersection of Newport Gap Pike and Boxwood Road to a low of 283&nbsp;vehicles at the eastern terminus.\nHistory\nWhat is now the Newport Gap Pike portion of DE&nbsp;62 was originally chartered as the Gap and Newport Turnpike in 1808, an extension of the 1807-chartered turnpike in Pennsylvania that was to run from Gap, Pennsylvania, southeast to Newport, Delaware. By 1920, what is now DE&nbsp;62 existed as a county road. The Newport Gap Pike portion of the route became a state highway by 1925. This state highway became a part of DE&nbsp;41 by 1936, when Delaware designated its state highways. In 1946, Boxwood Road was improved to provide access to the new General Motors' Wilmington Assembly plant (now the site of an Amazon fulfillment center) along the road. By 1981, DE&nbsp;62 was designated onto its current alignment, with the Newport Gap Pike section replacing a portion of DE&nbsp;41.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Western terminus of DE&nbsp;62; southern terminus of DE&nbsp;41\n}}\n|notes=DE&nbsp;141 exit&nbsp;5\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of DE&nbsp;62 signage\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-062/ DE&nbsp;62 at AARoads.com]"
