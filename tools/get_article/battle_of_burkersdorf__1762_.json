A Prussian army of 23,000 men fought an Austrian army of around 20,000 men.\nAfter the death of Elizabeth of Russia, czarina of Russia, her nephew Peter III came to the throne. Peter was a great admirer of Frederick the Great and all things Prussian, and Frederick used this to his advantage. Peter promptly withdrew his army from the war, abandoned Russian-occupied East Prussia, and signed a treaty of peace with Frederick. Peter then sent a force to aid the Prussian army in the campaign against the Austrians.\nPeter's reign was short-lived, however, as his wife Catherine the Great seized the throne, and he died shortly afterwards. Catherine withdrew from the war and sent orders for Count Zakhar Tchernyshov aiding the Prussians to withdraw.\nThe Austrian army was not aware of the exit of the Russian forces until Frederick began the battle.\nFrederick attacked and won, and the Russian force returned home.  Catherine's attempts to resume the war against Prussia were in vain, as peace talks were already being initiated at Hubertsberg.\nReferences\n*\n* [http://www.britishbattles.com/frederick/battle-burkersdorf.htm \"Battle of Burkersdorf Frederick the Great\"]. www.britishbattles.com.
