Her only brother, Thomas Stafford King-Harman, was killed in Normandy in 1944.\nDuring the 1930s, she visited Germany and was impressed with Adolf Hitler. By the time of her death, she was one of the last living people to have met Hitler in person. Having volunteered for Air Raid Precautions (ARP) service at the start of the Second World War in 1939, she was recruited to MI6 by Admiral John Godfrey, mainly for her knowledge of the German language, and worked as a confidential secretary alongside Kim Philby. The department was moved to Bletchley Park, where she also met future author Ian Fleming.\nIn 1943, she married Captain George Dennehy of the Irish Guards, who later became a solicitor; he died in 1990. From her first marriage, she had four daughters; Rosemary, Sarah, Mary and Caroline. By the time of her death she had 16 grandchildren and 32 great-grandchildren.\nHer second husband, whom she married in 1997, was the judge Sir Robin Horace Walford Dunn, whom she had known since childhood; he had three children from his first marriage. Sir Robin died in 2014.\nLady Dunn spent her last years as a resident at Maesbrook care home, Meole Brace, Shrewsbury, where she died in 2018 aged 100 years. A Roman Catholic, she was buried at Odiham Cemetery, Hampshire, on 25 July 2018 following a requiem mass at Shrewsbury Cathedral.\nReferences"
