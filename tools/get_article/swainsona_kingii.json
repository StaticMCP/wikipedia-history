It is a prostrate or ascending annual or perennial herb, with imparipinnate leaves with usually 5 egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, and racemes of 1 to 3 pink to purple flowers.\nDescription\nSwainsona kingii is a prostrate or ascending annual or perennial herb, that typically grows to a height of about  and has many stems. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly  long with usually 5 egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base,  long and  wide with stipules  long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are pink to purple, arranged in racemes of 1 to 3  long, on a peduncle up to  long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube  long, with lobes shorter than the tube. The standard petal is  long and almost as wide, the wings  long and the keel  long and about  deep. Flowering occurs from May to October, and the fruit is a narrowly elliptic pod  long on a stalk about  long, with the remains of the strongly curved style  long.\nTaxonomy and naming\nSwainsona kingii was first formally described in 1886 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Henry Sandford King's Plants Collected in Capricornic Western Australia. The specific epithet (kingii) honours King.\nDistribution\nThis species of swainsona is widespread in Western Australia, extending to the far west of South Australia, often in clay depressions, often near the edges of creek beds or lakes. It occurs in the Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Geraldton Sandplains, Great Sandy Desert, Great Victoria Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Murchison, Nullarbor, Pilbara and Yalgoo bioregions of Western Australia.\nReferences"
