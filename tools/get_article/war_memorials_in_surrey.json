Generally, World War II casualties have been added to the original memorial though in a few cases, such as at Ashford and Guildford, there is a separate memorial. A few display a lantern instead of a cross. The other main group of memorials consists of plinth mounted statues of either allegorical figures or of soldiers.\nIndoor memorials, such as those found in churches, generally consist of either metal or stone plaques inscribed with the names of the dead.\nIn addition to the conventional memorials, funds raised for memorials were often used to endow community facilities such as village halls or gardens of remembrance.\nOutdoor memorials\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\"\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!scope=\"col\" width=200px|Name and location\n!Date\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Description\n!Listing\n|-\n|\n|\n----\nChurch Green, Abinger Common\n| colspan=1 style=\"text-align: center;\"|\n| Designed by Edwin Lutyens and erected in 1920.
