The episode was written by Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg, and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis.\nPlot\nDisappointed that she hasn't found a new shelter yet, Charlie runs away from the group and ends up in a synagogue. There she is saved by Rabbi Jacob Kessner, who offers her an inn for the night. After shaking hands while repairing a light, Charlie thinks they can reinforce the chapel and create a new safe area for the group.\nJohn and June arrive, who say it won't work because it is too small and lacks a water supply. Charlie has to abandon the idea when the walkers invade and destroy the temple, forcing everyone to flee.\nMeanwhile, some members of Logan's crew discover the location of the caravan and chase after Sarah and Dwight, who are in the oil truck. They eventually run out of fuel, but Logan's group surprisingly leaves without conflict. Sarah is relieved, but Dwight wonders if it was a setup. Elsewhere, Logan arrives at the oil fields, having discovered the location through the Althea tapes.\nReception\n\"Ner Tamid\" received negative reviews. It currently holds a 36% negative rating with an average score of 4.75/10 out of 14 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: \"Meandering and stocked with credulity-straining moments, 'Ner Tamid' keeps the season's narrative momentum frustratingly stuck in neutral -- although it finds some grace notes in a nuanced depiction of Judaism.\"\nIn his review, Liam Mathews of TV Guide wrote: \"Every episode of Fear the Walking Dead has one thing you never thought you'd see.\" However, Erik Kain of Forbes was negative about the episode and wrote: \"It's all contrived. You could probably boil down the entire 12 episodes we've seen so far into two and not lose anything.\"\nRating\nThe episode was seen by 1.14 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, below the previous episodes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.amc.com/shows/fear-the-walking-dead/episodes/season-5-episode-12-ner-tamid--1303 \"Ner Tamid\"] at AMC.com\n*"
