He was resisted by the inhabitants, which ended the expedition in failure.\nBackground\nIn 1446, Nuno Tristão doubled Cap-Vert ninety miles to the north of the mouth of the Gambia River.\nNuno got into touch with the locals at Cap-Vert and agreed on a treaty of friendship and commerce with them. Afterwards, ships were sent from Portugal every year to trade with them.\nExpedition\nIn 1447, Nuno made his final voyage to explore the coast to the south of Cap-Vert. He stood out to sea from that point and consequently failed to discover the mouth of the Gambia River. Eventually he reached the Rio Grande. However, he was met with hostility, his party was attacked by the natives and he himself was killed.\nReferences"
