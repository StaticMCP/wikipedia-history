Medina, allied with generals Santiago González Portillo and José María Rivas, prepared for war with three fronts: South led by Generals Francisco López and , Center commanded by General Mariano Álvarez, and North under General Juan López Aguirre.\nThe Southern army attacked Pasaquina on March 16, 1871, defeating the Honduran forces led by General Florencio Xatruch. Xatruch seized Nacaome and advanced towards Tegucigalpa. Simultaneously, the Center and North fronts invaded El Salvador from Gotera and Sensuntepeque, respectively. Santiago González Portillo declared himself Provisional President of El Salvador after capturing Sensuntepeque. Decisive battles occurred in Santa Ana from April 7 to 10, where Honduran generals López, Ochoa, and Pineda, along with Salvadoran General , defeated the forces led by Generals Tomás Martínez and Ciriaco Choto in San Miguel.\nOn April 12, 1871, after a brief 27-day campaign, the Honduran army captured San Salvador, taking President Francisco Dueñas and ex-President of Nicaragua General Tomás Martínez into custody. The swift military actions resulted in the successful invasion and occupation of El Salvador by Honduras.\nSee also\n*El Salvador–Honduras relations\nReferences"
