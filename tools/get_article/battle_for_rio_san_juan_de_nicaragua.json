The conflict, which took place in July–August 1762, began when William Lyttelton, the British governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica, sent a naval expedition to Nicaragua with the primary objective of capturing the town of Granada.\nLocation\nGranada, the objective of the British military expedition, is located on the norther shore of Lake Nicaragua. Water from the lake discharges into the San Juan River (Río San Juan) at San Carlos in the south east corner of the lake. The river flows eastward for  into the Caribbean Sea. The Fortress of the Immaculate Conception, which would be besieged by the British, is located on the southern side of the rive by the village of El Castillo in present day Nicaragua. El Castillo is located approximately three-quarters of the way along the river inland from the sea. The border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica roughly parallels the line of the river. At the time of the siege, Nicaragua was part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, an administrative division of the Spanish Empire. This also included present-day Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the Mexican state of Chiapas.\nBackground\nBecause it represented a potential route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as the possibility of expanding their colonization of Central America beyond Mosquitia, Nicaragua was a major target of attacks by the British during the 18th century. Due to the economic interests of the British in Central America, the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed on 16 March 1740 between King Edward of Mosquitia and King George II of Great Britain. Under the terms of the treaty, a protectorate was established over the Mosquito Coast, and the British supplied modern weapons to the Miskito people. The kingdom later aided Britain during the American Revolutionary War by attacking Spanish colonies and gained several victories alongside the British.\nBetween 1739 and 1748, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Bourbon Spanish Empire had been at war over a series of trading disputes in a conflict known as the War of Jenkins' Ear, which was later subsumed by the wider War of the Austrian Succession. Most of these disputes were more or less settled by the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 and the Treaty of Madrid in 1750.\nWhen the Seven Years' War broke out in Europe in 1756, Spain did not initially join either of the two coalitions of belligerents. The Spanish policy of neutrality was immediately tested on 26 December 1756, when a British privateer, the Antigallican, captured the French ship Penthievre. When the British captain took both ships into the Bay of Cadiz, the Spanish authorities impounded both ships. Spain insisted that the captured ship should be returned to France, along with the Antigallican which was awarded as compensation. This outraged the British, but no military action was taken. This incident marked the beginning of a decline in Anglo-Spanish relations.\nAs the Seven Years' War progressed, the neutral Spanish government became concerned that the string of significant French losses at the hands of the British had threatened Spanish interests. On 15 August 1761, King Charles III of Spain and King Louis XV of France signed the Third Pacte de Famille. This treaty created an alliance between Spain and France, bringing Spain into the ongoing war. By an ancillary secret convention, Spain became hurriedly committed to preparing for war against Britain. The major objectives of Spain were the capture of Gibraltar and Jamaica from Britain.\nBritain first declared war against Spain on 4 January 1762, and on 18 January 1762, Spain declared war against Britain. The British quickly captured Cuba and the Philippines in early 1762. Also, in early 1762, William Lyttelton, Jamaica's British governor and commander-in-chief, proposed a naval expedition to the Spanish province of Nicaragua. The goal was to sail up the San Juan River to Lake Nicaragua and capture the town of Granada, which would effectively cut Spanish America in half as well as provide potential access to the Pacific Ocean. The first and most significant obstacle to success was to capture the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception.\nThe conflict began in June 1762, during the administration of interim Governor of Nicaragua Melchor Vidal de Lorca y Villena. Supplied by the British expeditionary force, a group of Miskito Sambu filibusters attacked cocoa plantations in the Valley of Matina. The following month, they raided many undefended settlements in Nicaragua, including Jinotega, Acoyapa, Lovigüisca, San Pedro de Lóvago, the mission of Apompuá near Juigalpa and Muy Muy, burning and looting the villages as well as capturing some Spanish prisoners. Many of the people they captured were sold into slavery in colonial Jamaica.\nThe combined British and Miskito Sambu expeditionary force headed towards the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception on the San Juan River in July. The attacking force consisted of two thousand men and more than fifty boats, while the soldiers at the fortress numbered only around a hundred. To make matters worse, the invaders threatened the region at a time when the commander of the fortress, Don José de Herrera y Sotomayor, had recently died on July 15. Lieutenant Don Juan de Aguilar y Santa Cruz assumed temporary command of the garrison.\nSiege Operations: July 29 – August 3, 1762\nThe British siege of the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception began in earnest on July 29, 1762, at approximately 4:00 a.m., when a cannon shot and sustained musket fire were heard downstream, near the Spanish sentry post. The garrison immediately took up arms, readied the artillery, and fortified positions where an attack seemed imminent. Acting commander Alférez Juan de Aguilar y Santa Cruz, who had assumed command following the death of José de Herrera y Sotomayor earlier that month, dispatched a reconnaissance boat to investigate. The Spanish encountered enemy forces near the sentry post and quickly withdrew under fire. Although no casualties were suffered, the Spanish boat was abandoned, and its crew returned to the fortress overland.\nLater that morning, seven large British piraguas accompanied by numerous smaller boats approached from downstream. After exchanging fire—including nine cannon shots—the enemy landed troops on the southern bank, using the jungle to shield themselves from the fortress's guns. British detachments also moved upstream on the northern side, advancing through the forest under cover.\nBy mid-afternoon, British forces were observed in a cordon stretching along the riverbanks. During this time, two allied indigenous Caribs attempted to return to a nearby ranch to retrieve their wives but encountered a large group of English and Zambo soldiers. From the fortress, Rafaela Herrera, the daughter of the late commandant requested and received permission to fire a cannon. Her shot, loaded with ball and shrapnel, struck with remarkable accuracy, scattering the enemy and reportedly killing several, including a prominent British officer. One of the Caribs managed to return to the fortress and confirmed the extent of the destruction.\nThat night, British forces began sustained musket fire against the fortress, hoisting seven English flags and maintaining pressure throughout the night.\nOn July 30, the British maintained their siege positions, now reinforced into seven distinct camps with sentinels and firing posts. The Spanish responded with cannon fire, which caused the enemy to pull back slightly. Later that morning, a British officer accompanied by an interpreter approached under a white flag, demanding the surrender of the fortress and offering safe conduct in exchange. Alférez Aguilar replied that he could not capitulate without superior orders and was prepared to resist. A brief truce was agreed to retrieve artillery pieces left in the nearby residence of the deceased commandant.\nLater that day, the British envoy returned, warning the Spanish not to open the gates again or risk massacre. Aguilar replied firmly that the territory and fortress belonged to the King of Spain, not to the King of England, and warned the British against further hostilities or destruction of local plantations. The night passed without renewed attacks.\nOn the morning of July 31, the British again approached under a white flag. The interpreter relayed threats from the British commander, warning that the fortress would be stormed within three days if it was not surrendered. Aguilar refused, stating he would not yield without orders from his superiors or unless killed in action. The British envoy departed, and shortly afterward, the British raised a black flag, signalling renewed hostilities. They opened fire, which was met with a vigorous Spanish artillery and musket response, continuing throughout the night.\nHostilities persisted into August 1 and 2, with constant exchanges of fire. However, by the evening of August 2, Spanish defenders noticed a significant decrease in enemy activity. At around 5:00 p.m., a small sparrow entered the fortress chapel and briefly landed on the image of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the fortress’s patroness. The bird circled the chapel and departed—an event the defenders interpreted as a favourable omen.\nOn August 3, minimal firing occurred. Spanish lookouts observed that while fires still burned in the enemy's upstream camps, few soldiers remained visible. Only scattered sentinels were seen near the fortress, while downstream, British forces were spotted cutting down local banana plantations. A large musket volley was heard from within the jungle, and enemy forces gradually disappeared from view.\nAftermath\nFortunately for the defenders of the fortress, Spain and Britain began peace negotiations (in Fontainebleau in November, the Spanish ceded Florida to the British.\nAfter Spain entered the American Revolutionary War in 1779, Major General John Dalling, the British governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica, proposed a second naval expedition to Nicaragua. During this expedition, which took place in 1780 and later became known as the San Juan Expedition, Colonel John Polson and Captain Horatio Nelson led a British attack against the fortress. At the time, the Spanish garrison consisted of 228 men under the command of Juan de Ayssa (who later served as Governor of Nicaragua from 1783–7). The expeditionary force succeeded in capturing the fortress on 19 April 1780, despite the fact that it consisted of only 200 men. The 22-year-old Nelson, in command of , was responsible for leading his men through dense jungle to attack the fortress from a hill in the rear. The British captured and occupied the fortress for nine months, finally abandoning it in January 1781.\nSee also\n* Spain in the American Revolutionary War\n* Great Britain in the Seven Years War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.manfut.org/cronologia/castillo.html El Castillo de la Concepción, Manfut.org (in Spanish)]"
