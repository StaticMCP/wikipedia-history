It is the administrative centre for the Shire of Balonne. In the , the locality of St George had a population of 3,130 people.\nHistory\nAboriginal people\nThe present township of St George was founded on the boundaries of three Aboriginal groups, the Mandandanji to the north, the Kooma to the south-west and the Bigambul to the south-east.\nThese people of the Balonne River fished with hoop nets and hunted ducks and marsupials for meat. They supplemented their diet with the small native melons that grew in abundance in the area, and with yams dug out from the flats along the riverbanks. Their funeral rites consisted of constructing an elevated bark platform on which the deceased would be placed, with fires lit underneath to smoke and preserve the corpse. The mummified remains would then be wrapped in bark and possum cloaks and carried with care by the relatives until they were deposited in a hollow of a tree. Surrounding trees were marked and decorated.\nBritish colonisation\nIn 1845, pastoralist squatters John Gordon Town and Christopher Bagot entered the vicinity looking for land to take up for cattle. The local Commissioner for Crown Lands, Roderick Mitchell conducted an expedition along the Balonne River later that year, taking the name for the river from the Aboriginal residents.\nIn 1846, the site where the town of St George now stands was Major Thomas Mitchell's Camp VIII of his expedition into northern Australia. He noticed the natural rocky ford across the Balonne River on St George's Day, 23 April, thereby naming the site St George's Bridge. He directed his second-in-charge Edmund Kennedy to construct a cattle depot there while he explored further north. Kennedy and his stockmen remained at St George's Bridge for around a month.\n]]\nIn 1847, the first cattle stations were established: Burgorah (also known as Warroo, owned by Robert Fitzgerald and managed by Patrick Brennan); Boombah (owned by Henry Dangar and managed by George Hazard); Gulnarbar (owned by George and Anthony Loder, and managed by William Clay); and Wagoo (also known as Wachoo or Culpa, owned by William Ogilvie Jnr, and managed by Robert Hazard).\nConflict with the local Aboriginal people over land and the killing of cattle ensued with around 40 Aboriginal people and up to nine whites being killed on Burgorah in 1849, Patrick Brennan being wounded in the leg by a spear. Aboriginal men later counter-attacked the stockmen on Burgorah, forcing them to flee to the nearby Boombah property, where Dangar's men were able to reinforce and arm both the stockmen and members of a rival Aboriginal clan. Upon returning to Burgorah, they slaughtered the resident Aboriginal people, burying around 70 of their corpses in a large pit.\nIn 1852, sweeps by the paramilitary Native Police began in the area. Sergeant Richard Dempster with property managers Patrick Brennan and others, shot at least five Aboriginal people on Wagoo. Later that year, a detachment under Lieutenant George Fulford drove the free Aborigines into the \"back country\". Some Aboriginal people were allowed to remain on the properties to be utilised as labourers and prostitutes. These were called \"station blacks\" and by 1855 there were around 40 remaining on Burgorah and 200 at Boombah.\nBy 1862, Burgorah and Gulnarbar were being utilised as a temporary Native Police barracks where Aboriginal prisoners were tied to trees and flogged, and occasionally shot dead. Lieutenant John Marlow and his troopers made a final sweep of the region in 1862, destroying Aboriginal camps and pursuing them as far as Angellala Creek where he \"dispersed\" them after a brief battle.\nTownship of St George\nThe township of St George was gazetted upon a portion of the Burgorah run in March 1864 with the first 59 parcels of land offered for sale a month later.\nAndrew Nixon was contracted in 1890 by the Queensland government to build a timber bridge across the Balonne River at St George's Bridge. This was completed in 1892 and later replaced by the current Andrew Nixon bridge and Jack Taylor Weir in 1953.\nSt George State School opened on 2 February 1874. In 1960 a secondary department was added which operated until St George State High School was opened in 1978.\nThe first St Patrick's Catholic Church was built in 1874; it is now known as the old parish hall. On 3 May 1959 the new St Patrick's Catholic Church was blessed and opened.\nThe St. George Standard and Balonne Advertiser newspaper was published from 1878 - 1879 and 1902 - 1904.\nBurgorah South Provisional School opened in 1902. On 1 January 1909, it became Burgorah South State School. It closed circa 1917.\nThe Balonne Beacon newspaper was published in St George from 2 January 1909 to 29 December 1954.\nMyrtlemount Provisional School, Warrie Provisional School and Hollymount Provisional School (all named after local pastoral stations) opened on 29 September 1919 as a group of part-time schools (sharing a teacher between them). All three schools closed in 1922 due to low student numbers.\nTow Towri State School opened circa 1931. It closed circa 1945. Towtowri is a local pastoral property.\nRocky Crossing State School opened on 25 January 1988 and closed on 31 December 2003. It was  from St George.\nFloods\nThe town was severely affected by flooding in March 2010, which peaked at 13.5 metres, and again in December 2010 - January 2011.\nFlooding once again occurred in February 2012, and about 2000 residents were mandatorily evacuated on 4 and 5 February to evacuation centres in Dalby and Brisbane. A temporary levee was built in St George on the morning of 5 February (Sunday). The Balonne River reached a height of 13.85 metres on Tuesday 7 February.\nGeography\nSt George is a town and locality in the Shire of Balonne, situated  due west of Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and sits just inside the region of South West Queensland.
