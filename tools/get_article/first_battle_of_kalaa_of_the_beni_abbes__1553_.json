The army of the Regency camped at Bona, a league from the Kalaa. Abdelaziz made a sortie against them and defeated them after a clash which was deadly for both sides. The armies of the Regency were forced to retreat after heavy losses, and this battle diminished their reputation. The victory allowed Sultan Abdelaziz to confirm his control over the Bibans and the Hodna. The following year the Regency of Algiers directed another expedition against Abdelaziz in the Battle of Oued-el-Lhâm.\nSee also\n*Second Battle of Kalaa of the Beni Abbes\n*Kalâa of Ait Abbas\n*Regency of Algiers\n*Kingdom of Ait Abbas\n*Campaign of Tlemcen (1551)\nReferences"
