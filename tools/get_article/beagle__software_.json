It is not actively developed.\nBeagle grew out of Dashboard, an early Mono-based application for watching and presenting useful information from a user's computer. It is written in C# using Mono and uses a port of Lucene to C# called Lucene.Net as its indexer. Beagle includes a Gtk#-based user interface, and integrates with Galago for presence information.\nBeagle was developed and maintained by Joe Shaw with help from the open source community. Notable contributors included Jon Trowbridge, Robert Love, Nat Friedman and David Camp.\nFeatures\nBeagle searches the content of documents and associated metadata. Users can search for:\n* Applications\n* Archives (zip, tar, gzip, bzip2) and their contents\n* Conversations (Pidgin, Kopete and IRC logs)\n* Documents (AbiWord, OpenOffice.org, Microsoft Office, pdf, txt, rtf, HTML)\n* Emails and address book contacts (from Evolution, Mozilla Thunderbird (header info only) and KMail)\n* Help files (Texinfo, man pages)\n* Images (png, jpg, tiff, gif, svg)\n* Music files (mp3, ogg, flac)\n* Notes taken in Tomboy, KNotes, and Labyrinth\n* RSS feeds (via Blam or Akregator)\n* Source code (C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python and more)\n* Video files (through MPlayer or Totem)\n* Web history (Firefox, Konqueror, Epiphany)\nBeagle can also index additional file types not natively supported using external tools through a configuration file.\nOn Linux, Beagle efficiently indexes documents using inotify without the need for frequent reindexing.\nSee also\n*Desktop search\n*List of desktop search engines\n*Tracker, an actively developed search system\n*Recoll\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://archive.today/20130415122550/http://nat.org/demos Nat's flash demos of Beagle]\n* [http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=38289 Peagle-Project]  (PHP-Based Web-Frontend for Beagle)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071022080616/http://beagle2.kbs.uni-hannover.de/ Beagle++] - a NEPOMUK-based extension of Beagle for semantic desktop search"
