The duo formerly used the name Mergener & Weisser.\nHistory\nThe group released their records under the IC (Innovative Communication) label, which also released a number of other electronic musicians, including Klaus Schulze and the Neue Deutsche Welle group Ideal.\nDuring a brief hiatus from 1990 to 1992, Weisser produced four albums using the Software name with a different group composition: Fragrance with Klaus Schulze and Georg Stettner, and Modesty-Blaze I / II and Cave with Billy Byte (Stephan Töteberg).\nAfter the dissolution of Software in 1999, the two musicians went their separate ways: Peter Mergener continues to compose and play electronic music, while Michael Weisser first founded the group G.E.N.E. (Grooving Electronic Natural Environments), and is currently, among other things, active as a media artist.\nThe project released one other album in 2007. In September 2017 Weisser without Mergener released six albums under the Software name. Earlier that year, Vaporwave artist George Clanton re-released the band's 1988 album Digital-Dance on his 100% Electronica label.\nMembers\n* Michael Weisser – (1984–1999, 2007, 2017)\n* Peter Mergener – (1984–1990, 1992–1999)\n* Billy Byte – (1990–1993)\n* Klaus Schulze – (1990–1992)\n* Georg Stettner – (1990–1992)\nDiscography\nMergener & Weisser\n*Beam Scape (1984)\n*Phancyful Fire (1985)\n*Chip Meditation I (1985)\n*Chip Meditation II (1985)\n*Electronic Universe I (1985)\n*Night-Light (1986)\nSoftware\n* Past-Present-Future I (1987)\n* Past-Present-Future II (1987)\n* Syn-Code (1987)\n* Digital Dance (1988)\n* Electronic Universe II (1988)\n* Software Visions (1988)\n* Kassettenbuch Dea Alba (1988)\n* Visions (1989)\n* Live-3rd Dimension (1989)\n* Ocean (1990)\n* Fragrance (1990)\n* Modesty-Blaze I (1991)\n* Modesty-Blaze II (1992)\n* Software Visions (1992)\n* Space Design (1993)\n* Cave (1993)\n* Ten Years (1994)\n* Brain Food Music (1994)\n* Heaven to Hell (1995)\n* Sky-Dive (1997)\n* Fire-Works (1998)\n* Mystic Millennium I (1999)\n* Mystic Millennium II (2000)\n* Spring Visions (2007)\n* Space World (2017)\n* Sacral World (2017)\n* Ocean World (2017)\n* Erotic World (2017)\n* Electronic World (2017)\n* Dea Alba (2017)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.peter-mergener.de Website of Peter Mergener] (German)\n* [http://www.mikeweisser.de Website of Michael Weisser] (German)\n*\n* [http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=2688 Software on Progressive archives]"
