The company, operating under the SaaS through the mobile app iAuditor, specializes in mobile-first and IoT technology for occupational safety and health and quality management. The company's regional offices are in Kansas City, Manchester, and Manila. As of 2024, SafetyCulture has raised over A$350 million in venture capital funding, achieving a valuation of approximately A$2.5 billion.\nHistory\nSafetyCulture was founded in 2004 by Luke Anear in Townsville, Queensland, initially operating out of his garage.  In 2014, SafetyCulture secured a Series A investment of A$6.1 million led by Blackbird Ventures and Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar, supporting its growth beyond Townsville. The company opened a Sydney office in 2015.\nBy 2016, SafetyCulture expanded internationally with offices in San Francisco, Kansas City, and Manchester. In October 2016, it raised $30 million in a Series B funding round led by Index Ventures, valuing the company at approximately $160 million post-money. In 2017, SafetyCulture established a support office in Manila, Philippines. In 2018, the company raised A$60 million in a Series C round.\nThe following year, 2019, SafetyCulture rebranded its corporate identity and expanded its Manila operations, forming an SEO team and announcing a joint venture with QBE Insurance named Mitti.\nIn 2020, SafetyCulture and QBE officially launched Mitti. SafetyCulture reached unicorn status with a valuation around A$1.3 billion and made its first acquisition, EdApp, a microlearning startup. In 2023, SafetyCulture raised $34 million in funding from Morpheus Ventures, Marbruck Investments, and Index Ventures, raising its valuation to approximately $2.7 billion.\nProducts and Services\nSafetyCulture's primary product, originally launched as iAuditor, is a comprehensive mobile and web-based platform designed to facilitate digital safety inspections, quality audits, and incident reporting. Users can easily create customized checklists, capture photographic evidence, flag issues, and generate detailed reports instantly.\nSafetyCulture Care (Insurance)\nSafetyCulture Care, originally launched as Mitti in 2020 in collaboration with QBE, became fully controlled by SafetyCulture in 2023, partnering with Allianz for underwriting support. This service offers specialized insurance and risk management solutions targeted at small and medium-sized businesses and is distributed through insurance brokers.\nSafetyCulture Care combines insurance coverage with SafetyCulture’s digital tools, encouraging businesses to carry out regular inspections and training to help manage workplace risks.\nAcquisitions\nSafetyCulture has made several acquisitions to expand its products and enter new markets. In September 2020, it acquired EdApp, a Sydney-based startup that offers a learning management system and content library, which became the basis for its employee training feature. In April 2022, SafetyCulture bought SHEQSY, a safety app for workers who are alone, which includes features like check-in timers and emergency alerts.  Its technology (including check-in timers and emergency alerts via a mobile app) was integrated to enhance SafetyCulture's solutions for field workers and those working remotely or in high-risk solo roles. This technology was added to SafetyCulture’s tools for field workers and people in high-risk jobs. In 2023, SafetyCulture took full ownership of its insurance joint venture, Mitti, by buying the remaining 50% stake from QBE, allowing it to operate the business independently and rebrand it as SafetyCulture Care. SafetyCulture has also made minority investments in other tech companies, like Unleash Live. an AI video analytics firm, and Inauro, an IoT platform.\nGrowth and Market Presence\nBy 2023, SafetyCulture reported serving over 75,000 organizations globally, a number that increased to approximately 85,000 business customers in 2024. Notable global clients include major enterprises and public agencies such as the National Health Service (NHS), National Grid, British Airways, Transport for London, Qantas, Shell, Hilton, and NASA.\nSafetyCulture's strategic focus has increasingly emphasized sustainable growth and profitability. In 2023, the company narrowed its losses to $36 million over the financial year, with revenues rising to $160.6 million.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://safetyculture.com Offical Website]\n* [https://training.safetyculture.com SC Training]\n* [http://marketplace.safetyculture.com/ SafetyCulture Marketplace]\n* [https://care.safetyculture.com SafetyCulture Care]\n* [https://sheqsy.com Sheqsy by SafetyCulture]\n* [https://safetydocs.safetyculture.com SafetyDocs by SafetyCulture]"
