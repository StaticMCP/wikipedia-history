It is given in memory of Ruth Curtain (from University of Groningen, The Netherlands), a leading contributor to the field of control of distributed parameter systems, supporter of the careers of many young researchers and author of reference books and major publications on system theory applied to distributed parameter systems. The award consists of a plaque that is presented during the IFAC Workshop on Control of systems Governed by Partial Differential Equations (CPDE). The plaque is presented by the IPC Chair of the IFAC Workshop on Control of systems Governed by Partial Differential Equations. The award is jointly sponsored by the International Federation on Automatic Control  IFAC and IEEE Control Systems Society TCs on Distributed Parameter Systems and is awarded every three years.\nSee also\n* IFAC TC Awards https://www.ifac-control.org/awards/tc-awards\nRecipients\n* 2022: Miroslav Krstic\n* 2025: Jean-Michel Coron\nReferences"
