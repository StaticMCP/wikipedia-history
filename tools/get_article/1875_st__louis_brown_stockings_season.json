Orrick Bishop\n| manager = Dickey Pearce\n|}}\nIn the fall of 1874, a group of civic boosters in St. Louis raised $20,000 to organize the creation of the cities first professional ball club. The St. Louis Brown Stockings joined the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players for the 1875 season and finished the season in fourth place. They subsequently joined the new National League for the 1876 season. The Brown Stockings joined the National League as a founding team and thus inspired what is now a rich baseball history in the city of St. Louis.\nPreseason acquisitions\nC. Orrick Bishop, a local St. Louis lawyer, was named as the Brown Stockings Vice President and given the task of going east to recruit top talent. In Brooklyn, Bishop picked up Dickey Pearce, Jack Chapman, Herman Dehlman, and Lip Pike. In and around Philadelphia, Bishop added Ned Cuthbert, Reddy Miller, George Bradley, Bill Hague, and Joe Battin.\nManagement\nDickey Pearce having been signed from the 1874 Brooklyn Atlantics became the first ever manager of the St. Louis Brown Stockings. Dickey Pearce is most known for his cunning managerial mind and creating the position of shortstop which he manned for the Brown Stockings in 1875.\nHitters\nThe St. Louis Brown Stockings worst hitter—starting catcher Tom Miller—had an OPS+ of 24 over 56 games. He hit .164—33 singles, two doubles, and one walk in 214 at-bats. The St. Louis Brown Stockings best hitter, Lip Pike, hit .346/.352/.494, for an OPS+ of 203—74 singles, 22 doubles, 12 triples. Lip Pike was known as the leagues most athletic hitter and for good reason as he is rumored to have raced a trotting horse and won.\nPitchers\n, right field and change pitcher; George Bradley, pitcher; John Clapp, catcher; Dickey Pearce, short fielder. Bottom row from left to right: Joe Battin, third base; George Seward, substitute and change catcher; John Chapman, right field; Lip Pike, right; Edgar Cuthbert, center; Michael McGeary, second base; Denny Mack, short fielder and general utility man.]]\nEighteen-year-old Pud Galvin is credited with leading the league in ERA (1.16) while just only pitching 62 innings.\nRegular season\nSeason standings\nRecord vs. opponents\nRoster\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: C4C3D0; color: #964B00; text-align: center;\" | 1875 St. Louis Brown Stockings roster\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #964B00; color: white; text-align: center;\" | Roster\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Pitchers\nCatchers\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Infielders\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Outfielders\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Manager\n|-\n|}\nPlayer stats\nBatting\nNote: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg.\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI\n|- align=center\n| Tom Miller || 56 || 214 || 35 || .164 || 0 || 12\n|- align=center\n| Herman Dehlman || 67 || 254 || 57 || .224 || 0 || 14\n|- align=center\n| Joe Battin || 67 || 284 || 71 || .250 || 0 || 33\n|- align=center\n| Dickey Pearce || 70 || 311 || 77 || .248 || 0 || 29\n|- align=center\n| Bill Hague || 62 || 260 || 57 || .219 || 0 || 22\n|- align=center\n| Lip Pike || 70 || 312 || 108 || .346 || 0 || 44\n|- align=center\n| Jack Chapman || 43 || 195 || 44 || .226 || 0 || 30\n|- align=center\n| Ned Cuthbert || 68 || 319 || 78 || .245 || 0 || 17\n|- align=center\n| Charlie Waitt || 30 || 113 || 23 || .204 || 0 || 12\n|- align=center\n| George Seward || 25 || 96 || 24 || .250 || 0 || 8\n|- align=center\n| Frank Fleet || 4 || 16 || 1 || .063 || 0 || 1\n|}\nStarting pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO\n|- align=center\n| George Bradley || 60 || 535.2 || 33 || 26 || 2.13 || 60\n|- align=center\n| Pud Galvin || 8 || 62.0 || 4 || 2 || 1.16 || 8\n|- align=center\n| Frank Fleet || 3 || 27.0 || 2 || 1 || 3.33 || 3\n|}\nRelief pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SV\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO\n|- align=center\n| Dickey Pearce || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3.38 || 0\n|}\nReferences\n*\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1875.shtml 1875 St. Louis Brown Stockings season at Baseball Reference]"
