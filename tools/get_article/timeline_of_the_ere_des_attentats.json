      "text": "# Timeline of the Ère des attentats\n\nThis page presents all events related to the Ère des attentats (English: Era of Attacks) from 1892 to 1894.\nGeneral overview\nThis timeline is largely based on the list provided by Hélène Millot, with additional references from the more comprehensive works of John M. Merriman and Vivien Bouhey. The start and end dates of the period follow Millot's framework, beginning with the Saint-Germain bombing (11 March 1892) and ending with the massacre of anarchist convicts (22 October 1894). However, Bouhey offers a broader perspective, considering the period from 1890 to 1894, which is not adopted here. The Fourmies massacre and the Clichy affair are included in the timeline, as most sources regard these two events as immediate precursors to the Ère des attentats.\nEvents\n:\n:\n:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n!Date\n! width=\"30%\" |Event\n!Place\n! width=\"20%\" |Instigator(s)\n! width=\"30%\" |Outcome\n!References\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#ed1aae\" |Massacre at Fourmies\n| Fourmies\n|\n* French state\n* French army\n|\n* Massacre of a dozen peaceful demonstrators in Fourmies\n* 9 dead, at least 35 injured\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#1a95ed\" |Clichy affair\n| Paris\n|\n* French state\n* French police\n|\n* Violent arrest of three anarchists\n* High-profile trial which radicalised the anarchists through its harshness\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#eaed1a\" |Saint-Dominique bombing\n| Paris\n|\n* French anarchist (?)\n|\n* Explosion in a wealthy residence on rue Saint-Dominique, in Paris\n* 0 dead, 0 injured\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#eaed1a\" |Saint-Germain bombing\n| Paris\n|\n* François Koenigstein (Ravachol)\n* Rosalie Soubère (Mariette)\n* Joseph Jas-Béala (Béala)\n* Charles Simon (Biscuit)\n|\n* Symbolic start of the Ère des attentats\n* They failed to kill or injure Edmond Benoît, the judge presiding over the trial of the accused in the Clichy affair\n* 0 dead, 1 injured.\n* Shift from ‘person-based’ terrorism to ‘location-based’ terrorism\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#eaed1a\" |Lobau bombing\n| Paris\n|\n* Théodule Meunier (Pied Plat)\n|\n* 0 dead, 0 injured.\n* Shift from ‘person-based’ terrorism to ‘location-based’ terrorism\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#eaed1a\" |Clichy bombing\n| Paris\n|\n* Ravachol\n|\n* 0 dead, 6 injured.\n* Failed to kill or injure Bulot, the prosecutor in the Clichy affair.\n* Shift from ‘person-based’ terrorism to ‘location-based’ terrorism\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#1a95ed\" |Arrest of Ravachol\n| Paris\n|\n* French state\n* French police\n* Jean-Marie Véry\n|\n* After being denounced by the owner of the restaurant Le Véry, Ravachol was arrested.\n* The other members of Ravachol's group had already been arrested.\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#eaed1a\" |Véry bombing\n| Paris\n|\n* Théodule Meunier\n* Jean-Pierre François (Francis)\n* Pieds plats\n|\n* Explosion at the restaurant Le Véry targeting the owner, who was killed.\n* 2 dead, at least 1 injured.\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#1a95ed\" |First trial of Ravachol\n| Paris\n|\n* French state\n* French justice system\n|\n* Rosalie Soubère and Joseph Jas-Béala acquitted.
