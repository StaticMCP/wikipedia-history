But in this war, it was attacked from all sides by several countries: Denmark–Norway to the west, the Tsardom of Russia in the east, the  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to the southeast, and the Electorate of Saxony to the south. The countries formed a coalition against Sweden and surprise attacked from all sides. By 1721, Sweden had been forced to sign a very disadvantageous peace, giving up Swedish Livonia and losing all their power.\nThis list shows the list of the military engagements using the Julian calendar, Swedish calendar and the Gregorian calendar.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
