The Ghibelline army of Pisa, commanded by Uguccione della Faggiuola, won a victory over the Guelf armies of the Florentines and their allies. The Neapolitan forces, made up of 3200 cavalry and 30,000–60,000 infantry, were commanded by Philip I of Taranto, while the Pisan forces consisted of 3000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry.\nPhilip survived the battle, his eldest son Charles of Taranto and his brother Peter, Count of Eboli and Gravina, were both killed in the fight. Additional deaths included members of 114 Florentine noble families. Francesco della Faggiuola, son of Uguccione, was killed possibly in personal combat with Charles of Taranto.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
