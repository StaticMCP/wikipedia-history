The proposed site is located at the parking lots adjacent to Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). The project is being undertaken by  Queens Future, LLC, a joint venture between Mets owner Steve Cohen and Hard Rock Entertainment.\nHistory\nIn October 2013, the New York City Council approved a plan to build a mall and entertainment center called Willets West in the Citi Field parking lot where Shea Stadium stood, as part of an effort by the city to redevelop the nearby neighborhood of Willets Point. However, in 2015, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the site, considered parkland, could not be used for commercial development without permission from the New York state government.\nIn 2022, Mets owner Steve Cohen began pushing to build a casino in the parking lot, which was supported by New York City mayor Eric Adams, but still needs final approval from the New York state government. In November 2023, Cohen unveiled a proposal to build an $8 billion, 50-acre casino and entertainment complex in the parking lot, called Metropolitan Park, which would include a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, restaurants, bars, and a live music venue as well as public park space, community athletic fields, and playgrounds.\nNew York state senator Jessica Ramos, who represents New York's 13th State Senate district where the site is located, announced her intention to formally oppose the construction of the casino and entertainment complex in May 2024. In March 2025, the New York City Council voted in favor of modifications in zoning regulations for the site, the penultimate step of the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP). In May 2025, over the objections of Ramos, a parkland alienation bill sponsored by neighboring state senator John Liu which reclassified the site as commercial property passed the New York State Senate, clearing the way for casino construction to begin. Liu was criticized for his support of the plan, with concern or parkland alienation and that the casino will target the local older Asian community members in surrounding neighborhoods that are most vulnerable.\nThe construction of the Hard Rock hotel and casino and its neighboring public park, food hall, and other improvements hinge on the project winning one of the three downstate casino licenses from the New York State Gaming Commission. On September 30, 2025, a community advisory committee unanimously approved  the proposal, sending it back to the Gaming Commission for final licensure.\nSee also\n* Ballpark Village (St. Louis) - a similar mixed-use development adjacent to Busch Stadium, home of the St. Louis Cardinals\n* The Battery Atlanta - a similar mixed-use development adjacent to Truist Park, home of the Atlanta Braves\n* Hellinikon Metropolitan Park - a similar park which will feature a Hard Rock themed casino-hotel\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.metropolitanpark.com/ Official website]\n*[https://www.nyc.gov/assets/designcommission/downloads/pdf/pres/4-28-25-pres-EDC-DPR-c-Metropolitan-Park-Queens-Future.pdf Site Master Plan (PDF)]"
