For works on Stalinism and the history of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, please see Bibliography of Stalinism and the Soviet Union. Book entries may have references to reviews published in English language academic journals or major newspapers when these could be considered helpful.\nAdditional bibliographies can be found in many of the book-length works listed below; see Further reading for several book and chapter length bibliographies. The External links section contains entries for publicly available select bibliographies from universities.\nA limited number of English translations of significant primary sources are included along with references to larger archival collections.\nInclusion criteria\nWorks included are referenced in the notes or bibliographies of scholarly secondary sources or journals. Included works should either be published by an academic or widely distributed publisher, be authored by a notable subject matter expert as shown by scholarly reviews and have significant scholarly journal reviews about the work. To keep the bibliography length manageable, only items that clearly meet the criteria should be included.\nCitation style\nThis bibliography uses APA style citations. Entries do not use templates. References to reviews and notes for entries do use citation templates. Where books which are only partially related to Soviet history are listed, the titles for chapters or sections should be indicated if possible, meaningful, and not excessive.\nIf a work has been translated into English, the translator should be included and a footnote with appropriate bibliographic information for the original language version should be included.\nWhen listing works with titles or names published with alternative English spellings, the form used in the latest published version should be used and the version and relevant bibliographic information noted if it previously was published or reviewed under a different title.\nGeneral works\n* Buttar, P.
