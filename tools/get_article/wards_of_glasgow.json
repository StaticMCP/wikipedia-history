These electoral districts, as they are also known, are used to elect councillors to Glasgow City Council. The council, composed of the elected members from each ward, provides local government services to the City of Glasgow.\nThere are 23 wards situated within the perimeters of Glasgow City Council. Each one elects 3 or 4 councillors every five years in the Scottish local council elections. The most recent elections were held in 2022.\nGlasgow City Council is one of the 32 council areas for Scotland (each council containing a number of wards). The boundaries for all Scottish council areas and their sub divisional wards are regulated and regularly reviewed by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland.\nMap\nThe following is a map of the party representation for each ward following the 2022 Glasgow City Council election.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|width=\"90\"|Party colour\n|width=\"150\"|Party name\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Conservative\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Scottish Green\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Labour\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Scottish National Party\n|-\n|}\nList of Wards (2017)\nThe following is a list of each Glasgow ward and its population data.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" | Ward Number\n!

The result from this system in 2003 was 69 of the 79 councillors representing the Labour Party, although that party gained only around half the votes cast in the election to the council, and the Scottish National Party represented by just four councillors, despite gaining some 20% of the votes. There were also three Liberal Democrat councillors, one from the Conservative party, and one from the Scottish Socialist Party.\nThe earlier election returns were even more skewed in terms of seats versus overall vote share due to the voting system in use: in 1999 council election result, Labour received 74 seats (94%) from 49% of the vote and the SNP received two seats from 29% vote share. In the first GCC election in 1995, which included 83 wards, Labour won 77 (93%) of the seats from approximately 62% of the overall vote, while the SNP's 23% overall vote share gave them only one seat.\nWards list (1999 and 2003 elections)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 200px; background:#c8c8ff;\"|Ward!! style=\"width: 200px; background:#c8c8ff;\"|Ward!! style=\"width: 200px; background:#c8c8ff;\"|Ward!! style=\"width: 200px; background:#c8c8ff;\"|Ward\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|\n# Drumry\n# Summerhill\n# Blairdardie\n# Knightswood Park\n# Knightswood South\n# Yoker\n# Anniesland\n# Jordanhill\n# Kelvindale\n# Scotstoun\n# Victoria Park\n# Hayburn\n# Hyndland\n# Hillhead\n# Partick\n# Kelvingrove\n# Anderston\n# Woodlands\n# North Kelvin\n# Wyndford\n| valign=\"top\"|\nMaryhill\nSummerston\nMilton\nAshfield\nFirhill\nKeppochhill\nMerchant City\nRoyston\nCowlairs\nSpringburn\nWallacewell\nMilnbank\nDennistoun\nCalton\nBridgeton/ Dalmarnock\nParkhead\nCarntyne\nRobroyston\nGartcraig\nQueenslie\n| valign=\"top\"|\nGreenfield\nBarlanark\nShettleston\nTollcross Park\nBraidfauld\nMount Vernon\nBaillieston\nGarrowhill\nGarthamlock\nEasterhouse\nDrumoyne\nGovan\nIbrox\nKingston\nMosspark\nNorth Cardonald\nPenilee\nCardonald\nPollok\nCrookston\n| valign=\"top\"|\nNitshill\nDarnley\nCarnwadric\nMaxwell Park\nPollokshields East\nHutchesontown\nGovanhill\nStrathbungo\nBattlefield\nLangside\nPollokshaws\nNewlands\nCathcart\nMount Florida\nToryglen\nKings Park\nCastlemilk\nCarmunnock\nGlenwood\n|}\nand 2003 council elections (amended from 1995, 83 wards)]]\nSee also\n*Demographics of Glasgow\n*Politics of Glasgow\n*Subdivisions of Scotland\nReferences"
