The party was founded in 1991, and it acquired ballot status in 1994. The party lost its ballot status in 2020 following changes to New York's ballot access requirements. On December 9, 2022, New York governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation banning the use of the words \"independent\" and \"independence\" from use in political party names in New York, effectively banning the party, though in January 2025 Cuti Frisch filed a lawsuit on Independent 2025 New York City mayoral election candidate Jim Walden's behalf challenging the law as he has asked to run as a member of the party despite it being banned. A U.S. appeals court would later uphold the ban. Walden would later drop out of the election in September 2025.\nHistory\nFounding\nThe Independence Party was founded in 1991 by a Rochester, New York-based, group, later merging for a time with the Bronx-based Independent Fusion Party to form the Independence Fusion Party. The Bronx-based Independent Fusion Party had earlier been active in endorsing Rudy Giuliani in the 1989 mayoral election (and again in 1993), seeking to emulate the City Fusion Party of the Fiorello H. La Guardia era and taking the historic four-leaf clover as its symbol. The unexpectedly strong showing of Ross Perot in the 1992 U.S. presidential election raised the profile of political independents in the country and led to centrist political parties rising to prominence in many states. It first achieved ballot status in New York as the \"Independence Fusion Party\" in 1994, and after that election reverted to just the Independence Party again.  The Independence Party was affiliated with the Reform Party of the United States, which was directly founded by Perot in 1995, and broke off from that party in 2000.\n1991–2002\nIn the elections for Governor of New York in 1994, 1998, and 2002, the Independence Party's candidate was businessman Tom Golisano, whose personal wealth enabled him to mount well-funded campaigns. In the 1994 election, he finished 4th, and 3rd in the 1998 and 2002 elections, far ahead of all other candidates not running on the Democratic or Republican ballot lines. Because Golisano received more than 50,000 votes each time, the party was guaranteed an automatic ballot line for the following four years.  It has enjoyed the 4th ballot line after the 1994 election, the third line on the ballot continuously since the end of the 1998 gubernatorial election cycle. Following the 2010 election, the party was in 5th place. Following the 2014 election, it finished in 6th place and was Row F for the following four years. The party endorsed Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 election, receiving 68,713 votes on the Independence Party line.\nIn the 2000 elections, Fred Newman initially backed Reform presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, but then he switched to Natural Law Party candidate John Hagelin. This resulted from squabbles between Newman's faction and the Buchanan campaign. The Independence Party chose Hagelin as the nominee over Ralph Nader.\n2003–2010\nIn 2003, members of the Republican Party successfully took over the Cattaraugus County branch of the Independence Party.\nIn 2004, the Independence Party endorsed Ralph Nader in his independent bid for president. Nader also petitioned for an independent line, which he named the Peace and Justice Party. Nader received 84,247 votes on the Independence Party line as opposed to 15,626 on Peace and Justice.\nWith the approach of the 2005 elections for municipal offices, Bloomberg gave the Newman-controlled Manhattan branch of the Independence Party $250,000 to fund a phone bank seeking to recruit volunteers for Bloomberg's re-election campaign. On May 28, 2005, the Independence Party endorsed Michael Bloomberg for re-election. Bloomberg won by a wide margin. During the campaign, a consulting outfit controlled by the Newman wing of the party received an additional $180,000 as a Bloomberg campaign subcontractor, according to the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\nSince the summer of 2005, the party has had an internal factional struggle between libertarians in much of New York and Long Island, and followers of Marxist psychotherapist Fred Newman based in New York City. In September 2005, the brewing struggle resulted in the party's state executive committee's ousting Lenora Fulani and other Newman followers. The catalyst was a media controversy over Fulani's refusal to publicly disavow her now-infamous 1989 statement that Jews are \"mass murderers of people of color\". Seventy-five percent of all state committee members supported this move. But Fulani—whose supporters called the purge racist, sexist, McCarthyistic and even antisemitic—continues to be active in the party's Newman-controlled New York City machine. The New York County chairperson Cathy Stewart and party strategist Jacqueline Salit run it on Newman's behalf. The New York City organization remains the most influential of the party's factions because of its small army of hard-working volunteers and the financial support it receives from prominent politicians and Newman's own political and psychotherapy base.\nOn February 4, 2006, the Executive Committee of the Independence Party of the State of New York dissolved the Interim County Organizations of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, which had been controlled by Newman and Fulani. The Committee's resolution stated the action was a result of the antisemitism and racism espoused by Fulani and Newman, which are antithetical to the principles of the Independence Party. One week later they attempted to suspend the chair of the Staten Island IP, a member of the Fulani group. The resulting court action allowed the chair to stay in office but also gave the opposing faction the right to make party endorsements for several local offices in the 2006 election. Although the \"Newmanites\" still control the Manhattan County organization, the recent revolt has probably ended their ability to influence the selection of the party's nominees anywhere in New York State except the borough of Manhattan.\nOn June 4, 2006, State Chairman Frank MacKay started dis-enrollment hearings against Fred Newman, Lenora Fulani, and almost 140 of their followers, in order to seize control of the New York City county organizations. Three different judges, in three different counties, repudiated MacKay’s efforts to disenroll Fulani, Newman and the other 140 New York City activists.  In July 2006, more than 4,000 New York City Independence Party members created duly constituted County Committees in Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, so that the State Chair could not take away local control in New York City.\nIn November 2006, Eliot Spitzer, running for Governor, received over 190,661 votes on the Independence Party line, more than enough to secure the party's spot on Row \"C\" for the next four years. Also, 19% of those votes were produced by the New York City organization. Additionally, in 2006, the Independence Party had its first member elected to the New York Legislature with the election of Timothy P. Gordon in the State Assembly, who also ran with the Democratic endorsement.\nIn the 2008 presidential election, the Independence Party endorsed John McCain for President and Sarah Palin for Vice President.  They received 163,973 votes on the Independence Party line, compared to 170,475 on the Conservative Party line and 2,418,323 on the Republican Party line.\nOn April 5, 2009, the Independence Party endorsed Michael Bloomberg for Mayor of New York City.\nIn September 2009, Assemblyman Fred Thiele switched parties from the Republican Party to the Independence Party.\n2011–2021\nThe Nassau County committee was dissolved in February 2011 after MacKay seized control over the party's operations from Bobby Kalotee.\nOn February 18, 2011, the Independence Party's assets were frozen as a result of an investigation into the theft of $1.2 million from the campaign of Michael Bloomberg, which ended up in the Independence Party's accounts.\nIn 2016, in response to a change in New York state law, the Independence Party allied itself with the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) of the New York State Senate, which allows the IDC to set up a caucus campaign committee. The State Senate's Republican conference was a major contributor to the Independence Party's coffers, and numerous Independence Party operatives took jobs with Republican state senators.\nThe Independence Party endorsed Gary Johnson in the 2016 presidential election, cross-endorsing with the Libertarian Party of New York. Notably, the Independence Party endorsed Johnson over Republican Party nominee Donald Trump, who (during his 2000 campaign for the Reform Party nomination) had previously been a member of the Independence Party.  Johnson received 119,160 votes on the Independence Party line and 57,438 votes on the Libertarian Party line.\nBen Walsh, despite coming from a family of prominent Republicans, refused to affiliate with the Republican Party. When he ran for mayor of Syracuse in 2017, he did so on two minor party lines: The Independence Party of New York and the Reform Party of New York State line. In what was generally seen as an upset, Walsh defeated Democratic candidate Juanita Perez Williams.\nIn 2017, the Independence Party endorsed Paul Massey for mayor of New York City.\nThe Independence Party endorsed entrepreneur and independent candidate Brock Pierce in the 2020 presidential election.\nThe Independence Party was affiliated with the Alliance Party in 2020. In 2021, both the Alliance Party and the Independence Party agreed to disaffiliate, but stated that they still intend to work with each other.\nDemise\nIn 2020, New York election law was changed to require that political parties receive at least 130,000 votes in a statewide election every two years to maintain ballot status. In the 2020 election, the party failed to achieve that total and lost its ballot status.\nIn 2022, the Independence Party of New York attempted to regain ballot access by supporting Lee Zeldin, the Republican nominee for governor. A petition was filed with the New York State Board of Elections, with the Republican slate seeking to restore the Independence Party line. On July 14, 2022, the Board of Elections denied the petitions submitted by the Zeldin campaign, due to contested signatures.\nOn December 9, 2022, New York governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation banning the use of the words \"independent\" and \"independence\" from use in political party names in New York state.\nin January 2025 Cuti Frisch filed a lawsuit on Independent 2025 New York City mayoral election candidate Jim Walden's behalf challenging the law as Walden has asked to run as a member of the party despite it being banned. Though a U.S. appeals court would later uphold the ban In August. Walden would later drop out of the election in September 2025.\nIdeology and ballot position\nThe Independence Party has been described as a populist, centrist, and \"big tent\" political party.\nDuring each gubernatorial election, the votes received by each party determine the order in which the parties will be listed on all state ballots for the next four years.  The Independence Party placed fourth in 1994 with its own candidate, Tom Golisano to Row D, and moved up to third in 1998 and 2002, again with Golisano to achieve Row C. In 2006, the Independence Party endorsed Democratic candidate Eliot Spitzer, and retained its place as the top minor party-Row C. Democrat Andrew Cuomo won the party's nomination for governor in 2010. However, Cuomo drew less than 140,000 votes on the Independence line (compared to the 190,000 Spitzer drew in 2006), which resulted in the Independence Party falling to Line E as of 2011 behind the Conservative Party and the Working Families Party. It fell to Line F in the 2014 gubernatorial election, garnering less than 80,000 votes and falling behind the Green Party.\nLeadership\nThe chairman of the Independence Party of New York was Frank MacKay, also the leader of the party in Suffolk County and National Chairman of the newly formed Independence Party of America; he resigned as of 2022.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Chairpersons\n|-\n!
