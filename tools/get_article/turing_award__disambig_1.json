Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to computer science. It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in the field of computer science and is often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\". , 79 people have been awarded the prize, with the most recent recipients being Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton, who won in 2024.\nThe award is named after Alan Turing, also referred as \"Father of Computer Science\", who was a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester. Turing is often credited as being the founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, and a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher during World War II. From 2007 to 2013, the award was accompanied by a prize of , with financial support provided by Intel and Google. Since 2014, the award has been accompanied by a prize of &nbsp;million, with financial support provided by Google.\nThe first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis. The youngest recipient was Donald Knuth, who won in 1974 at the age of 36, while the oldest recipient was Alfred Aho, who won in 2020 at the age of 79. Only three women have been awarded the prize: Frances Allen (in 2006), Barbara Liskov (in 2008), and Shafi Goldwasser (in 2012).\nand Ken Thompson, on display at Nokia Bell Labs.]]\n__TOC__\nRecipients\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Recipients of the ACM Turing award\n!scope=\"col\" |Year\n!scope=\"col\" |Recipient(s)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Photo\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Rationale\n!scope=\"col\" |Affiliated institute(s)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1966\n|\n|align=\"center\" |\n|\"For his influence in the area of advanced computer programming techniques and compiler construction\"\n|Carnegie Mellon University\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1967\n|\n|\n|For contributions including being \"the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the second computer with an internally stored program\" and introducing program libraries (together with David Wheeler and Stanley Gill)\n|University of Cambridge\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1968\n|\n|align=\"center\" |\n|\"For his work on numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes\"\n|University of LouisvilleBell Labs\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1969\n|\n|\n|\"For his central role in creating, shaping, promoting, and advancing the field of artificial intelligence\"\n|Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1970\n|\n|align=\"center\" |\n|\"For his research in numerical analysis to facilitate the use of the high-speed digital computer, having received special recognition for his work in computations in linear algebra and 'backward' error analysis\"\n|National Physical Laboratory\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1971\n|\n|\n|Award citation refers to McCarthy's lecture \"The Present State of Research on Artificial Intelligence\"\n|Stanford University\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1972\n|\n|\n|\"For fundamental contributions to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; for eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into correctness; for illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of program design\"\n|Centrum Wiskunde & InformaticaEindhoven University of TechnologyUniversity of Texas at Austin\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1973\n|\n|\n|\"For his outstanding contributions to database technology\"\n|General Electric Research Laboratory (now under Groupe Bull, an Atos company)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |1974\n|\n|\n|\"For his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, and in particular for his contributions to 'The Art of Computer Programming' through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title\"\n|California Institute of TechnologyCenter for Communications Research, Center for Communications and Computing, Institute for Defense AnalysesStanford University\n|-\n!scope=\"rowgroup\" rowspan=2 |1975\n|\n|align=\"center\" |\n|rowspan=2 |In collaboration with J.
