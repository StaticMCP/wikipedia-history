For the first six months after the line was completed, no locomotives were available, so wagons on the line were towed by horses. It was converted to broad gauge with a new terminus one kilometre east of Kingston, on the edge of the port township in 1957. It closed on 28 November 1987. The last train on the line travelled on 9 December 1987; a Rail Tourist Association tour with Bluebird railcar 255 'Pelican'. The line  was dismantled on 15 September 1991.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.johnnyspages.com/mt_gambier_sth_east.htm Gallery]"
