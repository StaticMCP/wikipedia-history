Wolfe\nReception\nThe show received a positive reception from media publications. Some media outlets received the broadcast more positively with praise for Corden and how he dealt with the Orlando nightclub shooting. The Hollywood Reporter'' columnist David Rooney remarked, \"In terms of Corden's overall performance as host, it was very much in line with his Late Late Show monologues — sweet and upbeat, if not the least bit risky or cutting-edge. Despite the inevitable longueurs that set in as the evening wore on, for the most part he kept the show moving briskly with affable appearances to paper the gaps.\" Television critic Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times remarked, \"Where Neil Patrick Harris, who once seemed to have permanent first-refusal rights on the job, is a cool cat, Corden is a ball of energy, a big dog that won't stop licking your face; but it is a style that works for him.\" The New York Times theatre critic Charles Isherwood commented, \"Was a bit jarring moving to comedy, but Mr. Corden is such a genial presence.\"\nIn addition, Maureen Ryan from Variety wrote, \"Corden was an energetic host, even if the opening number meant to showcase his lifelong love of theater felt as though it went on a little long. There was also the inevitable Carpool Karaoke number. Corden was an affable host, and his opening remarks on Orlando were short but effective.\" Frazier Moore of the Rolling Stone wrote, \"On a night that was marked by tragedy — and occurring mere hours after news broke of the deadly mass shooting in Orlando, Florida — the Tonys provided a much-needed bit of levity. The performers and honorees didn't shy away from speaking about the shocking events of the day, but the overall mood was one of celebration. Part of the credit goes to the master of ceremonies James Corden, best known as the goofy host CBS's Late Late Show, yet still a dorky theater kid at heart; his charming, cheerful persona brought an upbeat mood to the proceedings.\" The Washington Post theatre critic Peter Marks gave high marks toward Corden saying, \"Corden served for the first time Sunday night as host of the Tony Awards and, as a result, ushered in a completely pleasurable Era of Good Feeling for an awards ceremony, and an industry, badly in need of one.\"\nRatings\nThe ceremony averaged a Nielsen 6.8 ratings/11 share, and was watched by 8.7 million viewers. The ratings was a 33 percent increase from previous ceremony's viewership of 6.4 million, becoming the highest rating in over 15 years.\nIn Memoriam\nAn orchestra was performing in the tribute as images of theatre personalities who died in the past year were shown in the following order.\n*Doris Roberts\n*Sir Peter Shaffer\n*Billie Allen\n*Arnold Wesker\n*Patty Duke\n*Anne Jackson\n*Robert de Michiell\n*Ken Howard\n*Maureen O'Hara\n*Michael White\n*Biff Liff\n*Brian Bedford\n*Kyle Jean-Baptiste\n*Brian Friel\n*Patricia Elliott\n*Richard Libertini\n*Dean Jones\n*Elizabeth Swados\n*Alan Rickman\n*David Margulies\n*David Bowie\n*Saeed Jaffrey\n*Frank D.
