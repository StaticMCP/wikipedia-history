Originally a four-member ward, Ayr East was reduced in size following a boundary review and has elected three councillors since the 2017 South Ayrshire Council election.\nThe area produced strong results for both the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Conservatives prior to the boundary changes but, since the changes, it has been politically split between the SNP, the Conservatives and Labour with each party holding one seat at each subsequent election.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Ayr East was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained all of the former Ayr Belmont, Ayr Forehill and Ayr Masonhill wards, the majority of the former Ayr Old Belmont ward and the southeastern part of the former Ayr Central ward. The ward centres on the eastern portion of the town of Ayr which is situated on the Firth of Clyde coast in the northwest of the council area. It originally contained everything in the town south of the River Ayr, east of Carrick Road/Monument Road and north of the Rozelle Estate. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward's western boundary was amended east to run along the Glasgow South Western railway line. As a result, the ward was reduced from a four-member ward to a three-member ward.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Ian Douglas(SNP)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|Mary Kilpatrick(Conservative)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Eddie Bulik(Labour/Independent)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Winifred Sloan(Conservative)\n|-\n!2009\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Brian McGinley(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Corri Wilson(SNP)\n|-\n!2015\n|John Wallace(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Chris Cullen(SNP)\n|colspan=2; rowspan=2\n|-\n!2022\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2015 by-election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
