He is the first head of the Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) to be appointed from the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN). For over five decades previously, the Chief of the Defence Force had traditionally been a 4-star General from the Malaysian Army. Anwar broke the tradition by being appointed the first Navy Admiral to be promoted to Chief of Defence Force.\nAfter retirement\nAfter retirement, Anwar was involved in politics and appointed a Senator of Dewan Negara for one term from 23 April 2015 to 22 April 2018, representing United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a component of Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. He also served as the chairman of the Armed Forces Fund Board or Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT).\nHonours\nHonours of Malaysia\n*\n**  Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (PMN) – Tan Sri (2005)\n**  Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Royal Family of Malaysia (PSD) – Datuk (2002)\n**  Companion of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (JSM) (1997)\n**  Companion of the Order of Loyalty to the Royal Family of Malaysia (JSD) (1993)\n**  Officer of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (KMN) (1991)\n**  Recipient of the Loyal Service Medal (PPS)\n**  Recipient of the General Service Medal (PPA)\n**  Recipient of the 9th Yang di-Pertuan Agong Installation Medal\n**  Recipient of the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Agong Installation Medal\n**  Recipient of the 12th Yang di-Pertuan Agong Installation Medal\n*\n**  Knight Commander of the Order of Loyalty to Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah (DHMS) – '''Dato' Paduka (2007)\n*\n**  Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Life of the Crown of Kelantan (SJMK) – Dato' (2007)\n*\n**  Knight Commander of the Exalted Order of Malacca (DCSM) – Datuk Wira (2006)\n**  Recipient of the Commendable Service Star (BKT) (1991)\n*\n**  Knight Grand Companion of the Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang (SSAP) – Dato' Sri (2003)\n*\n**  Knight Grand Commander of the Order of Taming Sari (SPTS) – Dato' Seri Panglima (2004)\n**  Knight Commander of the Order of Taming Sari (DPTS) – Dato' Pahlawan (1997)\n**  Commander of the Order of the Perak State Crown (PMP) (1994)\n*\n**  Knight Grand Companion of the Order of Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah (SSIS) – Dato' Setia (2004)\n**  Knight Commander of the Order of the Crown of Selangor (DPMS) – Dato' (2003)\n**  Recipient of the Sultan Sharafuddin Coronation Medal (2003)\nForeign honours\n*\n**  First Class of the Order of Paduka Keberanian Laila Terbilang (DPKT) - Dato Paduka Seri'''\n*\n**  Officer of the Legion of Honour (2007)\n*\n**  First Class (Utama) of the Star of Yudha Dharma (2006)\n*\n**  Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2004)\nReferences"
