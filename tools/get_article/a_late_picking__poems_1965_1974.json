A few poems set you back slightly. They're still Hope but in genres you wouldn't have thought his temperament would come to: for example, 'Hay Fever', (a kind of carpe diem poem which almost becomes a pastoral lyric); an elegy for Osip Mandelstam (an artist one would not have thought much to Hope's Augustan tastes); 'Winterreise' (a straight medieval lyric) or 'Dialogue' (a placid accepting love poem in no way touched with either irony or sexual energy).\"\nPublication history\nThe poetry collection was also published by Wentworth Press in a limited edition of 60 copies.\nAwards\nThe collection won both 1976 The Age Book of the Year awards for Best Fiction and Best Book of the Year.\nSee also\n* 1975 in poetry\n* 1975 in Australian literature\nReferences"
