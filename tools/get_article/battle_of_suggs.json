The skirmish was part of a larger conflict known as the Johnson County War fought from 1889 to 1893 between wealthy ranchers and settlers of modest means whom the former accused of being rustlers.\nBackground\nCommunities near the Powder River in Wyoming became battlefields for a range war known as the Johnson County War, in which large cattle ranchers fought smaller settlers and homesteaders for the limited resources needed for ranching. The war resulted in lynchings and assassinations, culminating in a gunfight at the KC Ranch and a large siege at the TA Ranch.\nTo stop further violence, the government sent out the army to keep the peace. Initially, the 6th cavalry from Fort McKinney was tasked to pacify the locals but failed because many became embroiled in the conflict. This failure resulted in the death of US Marshall George Wellman and the injury of First Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood. The 6th was later replaced by the 9th Cavalry, a Buffalo Soldier regiment from Fort Robinson, on June 13, 1892. The regiment was composed of 310 men and was led by Major Charles S. Isley. They created Camp Bettens as a base of operations upon arriving.\nThe cattle barons hoped that the regiment would be less sympathetic to the plight of the homesteaders as compared to the 6th. This turned out to be correct, as the arrival of the 9th was met with hostility from the locals who did not take kindly to the authority of colored soldiers. The hostility was exacerbated by the 9th's association with Phil DuFran, a detective and combatant for the cattle barons during the TA Ranch siege. DuFran assisted the soldiers during their occupation.\nBattle\nThe battle occurred on June 17, 1892. Off-duty Buffalo Soldiers were being refused services in bars, barbershops, and brothels by the locals of the nearby town of Suggs. At that time, Suggs was a temporary makeshift community built near a railroad. The fraught relationship between the two parties became heated to the point that a dispute over a prostitute resulted in a brief gunfight. Even after the soldiers retreated, they were continually shot upon by the locals. The next day, a group of 20 or more soldiers slipped out of the camp and rode out to Suggs. Upon arrival, they began firing their guns and demanded the town surrender the people responsible for the prior act of violence. The locals refused and began firing at the soldiers from behind windows, doors, and walls.\nThe retaliation surprised the soldiers; two of them were wounded and another, Private Willis Johnson, was killed. The soldiers were then forced to retreat. In his report, Major Isley stated:\nAfter the gunfight, Camp Bettens sent out two detachments to pacify Suggs. In contrast to the previous event, the homesteaders allowed these troops into the town. The Army conducted an investigation but could not identify the people responsible for Johnson's death. To prevent further violence, the camp could only prohibit the presence of off-duty soldiers in the town.\nOther murders\nAnother soldier by the name of Brown was murdered in a separate incident in Johnson County. Brown was at a shooting range when a cowboy rode by and came upon him. After a brief conversation, the cowboy drew a pistol and shot Brown, killing him. DuFran also went missing during the fracas.}}\nAftermath\nThe deaths of several Buffalo Soldiers forced the Army to remove the regiment from Johnson County and back to Fort Robinson in November 1892. Peacekeeping went back to local law enforcement for the duration of the war.\nIn other media\nThe battle was briefly mentioned in Asa Mercer's book entitled The Banditti of the Plains and the episode \"Johnson County Cattle War\" of the documentary Vendettas by History Channel.\nReferences"
