The set was packaged in a longbox format with the booklet fixed inside like a book.\nAs well as including all of Thin Lizzy's best known songs and successful hits, this set features a number of rarer tracks, such as the band's first single, \"The Farmer\", the 1973 b-side \"Cruising in the Lizzymobile\", and the 1978 live b-side \"Me and the Boys\", none of which had been released on CD before. \"Try a Little Harder\" was a previously unreleased outtake from the Fighting recording sessions, and \"Song for Jimi\" had only been available on a flexi disc given away with a magazine. Other non-album b-sides were also included, such as \"Half Caste\", \"Just the Two of Us\" and \"Don't Play Around\". All of these tracks except \"Me and the Boys\" and \"Song for Jimi\" were later re-released on expanded versions of the studio albums, as part of a remastering of the whole Thin Lizzy catalogue.\nThis boxed set also includes a small number of Phil Lynott solo songs, and one by his post-Thin Lizzy band, Grand Slam. The track \"A Night in the Life of a Blues Singer\" had been recorded in January 1978 by the Black Rose: A Rock Legend line-up of Thin Lizzy, but was eventually released as a Phil Lynott solo track on the 12\" version of his \"Nineteen\" single in November 1985.\nTrack listing\n;Disc 1 (1970-1973)\n#\"The Farmer\" (Philip Lynott)\n#\"The Friendly Ranger at Clontarf Castle\" (Eric Bell, Lynott)\n#\"Remembering, Pt. 1\" (Lynott)\n#\"Dublin\" (Lynott)\n#\"Remembering, Pt. 2 (New Day)\" (Lynott, Bell, Brian Downey)\n#\"Things Ain't Workin' Out Down at the Farm\" (Lynott)\n#\"Buffalo Gal\" (Lynott)\n#\"Sarah\" (Lynott)\n#\"Brought Down\" (Lynott)\n#\"Whiskey in the Jar\" (Trad. arr.
