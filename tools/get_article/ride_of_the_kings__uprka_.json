It depicts the folk festival Ride of the Kings, which is celebrated in the spring at Pentecost. The celebration begins with a church service and a greeting by the mayor, then follow the final preparations of the costumes of the participants and the decoration of the horses. Ornamental decorations and costumes are made by the women, and each one has a different colour and pattern, depending on which village the participant comes from. The participants are about 15-26 young men preceded by singers and an \"honor guard\": a boy aged between 10 and 15 years, who carries a sword to protect the \"King\". the boy's face is partially covered and in his mouth he's holding a rose. The King and his entourage are dressed in women's clothes while everyone else is in men's attire.\nReferences"
