It was established around 1515 CE and ruled by the Ath l-Qadi dynasty until 1632 or 1638 CE. Ahmed ou el Kadhi (Ou l-Qadi) is acknowledged as the founder.\nOrigins\nThe Ath l-Qadi are generally accepted to have been from the Ath Ghoubri region and having a maraboutic lineage. According to Laurent-Charles Féraud (1829–1888), the dynasty possessed parchments which attributed their genealogy to a certain Ammar ben Idris, hence relating them to the Sharifian Idrisids of Fez, while Joseph Nil Robin associates them with a non-Sharifian Fassi ancestry.\nReferences"
