The band had released no music and were unknown until they were announced to play at that year's Download Festival, sparking speculation to their identity. Their frontman, the eponymous President, is described by Revolver as \"silver-haired, wearing an eerie, not-quite-lifelike mask etched with deep wrinkles and radiating wax-figure unease\". They released their debut EP, King of Terrors, in 2025.\nThe band's current lineup consists of The President (vocals), Heist (guitarist), Protest (bassist) and Vice (drummer). While their identities remain concealed, multiple sources have suggested the masked lead vocalist is Charlie Simpson, co-lead vocalist and guitarist for Busted and former frontman for Fightstar.\nHistory\nBeginnings and initial releases\nIn an interview with Revolver, it was revealed that the band began as a solo project and later expanded into a full band. Development of the project occurred over several years in complete secrecy until the band was announced as a performer at the 2025 Download Festival in February 2025, confusing fans as no details were released as to who the band was and they had released no music. Shortly afterward, the band created an Instagram page and started posting cryptic teasers.\nIn April 2025, they released a teaser for a new song, their debut single \"In The Name of the Father\", released on 15 May 2025. The song was named \"Tune of the Week\" on BBC Radio 1 and they appeared on the cover of an issue of Rock Sound. Speculation ran rampant on who the band was, as fans discovered ties to the band with several companies used by another masked band Sleep Token (who were headlining Download Festival that year) and using similar iconography to Crosses. On May 21, they announced their first headlining show at The Garage in London. The show, which took place on July 30, sold out in less than 48 hours. A second single, \"Fearless\", was released on 5 June 2025. The band debuted at Download Festival 2025 in June 2025. Their performance was praised by Kerrang! as an \"absolute pandemonium from the off,\" and was favorably received by the crowd. The band was later announced to open for Architects for several dates between December 2025 and January 2026.\nKing of Terrors (2025–present)\nOn 18 July 2025, the band announced their debut EP, King of Terrors, to be released on September 26, accompanied by the third single \"Rage\". The band's fourth single, \"Destroy Me\", was released on September 4. Following the release of \"Destroy Me\", it was announced that President would be headlining the upcoming TakeDown Festival 2026, set to take place at Portsmouth Guildhall in April 2026, with the band scheduled to headline on Saturday, April 4.\nOn 17 September, in an interview with Kerrang!, the band confirmed they were working on their debut album, which will expand on the lore of the President character. Several days later, the band was announced for multiple upcoming festivals: Slam Dunk festival (23-24 May 2026), Nova Rock Festival (12 June), Rock for People festival (13 June), and Copenhell festival (24-27 June).\nPresident’s swift ascent has led to speculation that the band may be an industry plant. The frontman rejected the claim as \"bewildering\", emphasizing that King of Terrors  was self-produced, independently released, and promoted through grassroots efforts by friends and online supporters, without label involvement or major industry backing.\nOn 26 September, the EP was released worldwide, along with neon-stylized visualizer videos for the both \"Dionysus\" and \"Conclave\".\nFollowing the release of the EP, the band announced a one-off Australian show that's set to take place on 12 December, coinciding with their tour in support of Architects. This was followed by an announcement for an appearance at the Greenfield Festival (11-13 June).\nOn October 28, the band was announced as an opening act, alongside Beartooth, for Bad Omens's upcoming 2026 North American arena tour.\nMusical style, themes, and imagery\nfeaturing a patriarchal cross.]]\nThe band's music has been described as metalcore, with elements of alternative metal, alternative pop, and electronica. Their third single \"Rage\" is described as a \"swirling, synth-laden cut\", in contrast to the previous single's guitar-based music. Lyrically, the song was inspired Dylan Thomas’s poem \"Do not go gentle into that good night.\"\nPresident's work often explores themes of religion, mortality, and existential fear. Their debut EP, King of Terrors, references the biblical figure associated with death, highlighting mortality as a central motif.\nThe band's frontman has described the project as rooted in a personal crisis shaped by religion and loss, and has said \"I didn’t want it to feel modern, I wanted it to feel like something else. We wanted to add an element of [...] discomfort, kind of in the way The Shining makes you uncomfortable. I wanted it to feel beautiful but unsettling.\"\nThe band incorporates political campaign themes into its public image and press releases. Live performances are presented as \"rallies,\" promotional materials are referred to as \"endorsements,\" music videos as \"broadcasts,\" and fans are encouraged to \"join the campaign\" to receive updates.\nBand members\n* The President – lead vocals, production (2025–present)\n* Heist – guitars (2025–present)\n* Protest – bass (2025–present)\n* Vice – drums (2025–present)\nDiscography\nExtended plays\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Title\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|EP details\n!scope=\"col\"|Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|King of Terrors\n|\n*Released: 26 September 2025\n*Label: King of Terrors / ADA\n*Formats: CD, DL, streaming\n| 25\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\" | Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album/EP\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\" | UK\nSales\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\" | UK Rock & Metal\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\" | UK Down.\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\" | UK Indie\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\" | US Hard Rock\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"In the Name of the Father\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2025\n| 52\n| 19\n| 50\n| 41\n| 14\n| rowspan=\"4\" | King of Terrors\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Fearless\"\n| 71\n| 37\n| 68\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Rage\"\n| 98\n| 32\n| 93\n| —\n| —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Destroy Me\"\n| 95\n| 31\n| 92\n| —\n| 22\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"font-size: 85%\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n|}\nOther charted songs\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album/EP\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\" | US Hard Rock\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Dionysus\"\n| 2025\n| 24\n| King of Terrors\n|-\n|}\nMusic videos\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\"|Title\n!scope=\"col\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\"|Director(s)\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\"|Album/EP\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\"In the Name of the Father\"\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2025\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Blindeye\n|rowspan=\"4\"|King of Terrors\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\"Fearless\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\"Rage\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\"Destroy Me\"\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
