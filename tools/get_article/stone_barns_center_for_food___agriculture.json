The center was created on  formerly belonging to the Rockefeller estate. Stone Barns promotes sustainable agriculture, local food, and community-supported agriculture. Stone Barns is a four-season operation.\nStone Barns Center is also home to the Barber family's Blue Hill at Stone Barns, a restaurant that serves contemporary cuisine using local ingredients, with an emphasis on produce from the center's farm. Blue Hill staff also participate in the center's education programs.\nHistory\nStone Barns' property was once part of Pocantico, the Rockefeller estate. The Norman-style stone barns were commissioned by John D. Rockefeller Jr. to be a dairy farm in the 1930s. The complex fell into disuse during the 1950s and was mainly used for storage. In the 1970s, agricultural activity resumed when David Rockefeller's wife Margaret \"Peggy\" McGrath began a successful cattle breeding operation.\nStone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture was created by David Rockefeller, his daughter Peggy Dulany, and their associate James Ford as a memorial for Margaret Rockefeller, who died in 1996. Stone Barns opened to the public in May 2004.\nIn 2008, Stone Barns opened its slaughterhouse to slaughter its livestock for plating at Blue Hill. Using their own slaughterhouse also eliminated the long and expensive drives to the closest one.\nIn 2017, Stone Barns published Letters to a Young Farmer, a compilation of essays and letters about the highs and lows of farming life, including Barbara Kingsolver, Bill McKibben, Michael Pollan, Temple Grandin, Wendell Berry, Rick Bayless, and Marion Nestle.\nFarm\nThe farm at Stone Barns is a four-season operation with approximately  used for vegetable production. It uses a seven-year rotation schedule in the field and greenhouse beds. The farm grows 300 varieties of produce year-round, both in the outdoor fields and gardens and in the  minimally heated greenhouse that capitalizes on each season's available sunlight. Among the crops suitable for the local soil and climate are rare varieties such as celtuce, Kai-lan, hakurei turnips, New England Eight-Row Flint seed corn, and finale fennel. The farm uses no pesticides, herbicides or chemical additives, although compost is added to the soil for enrichment. The farm has a six-month composting cycle using manure, hay, and food waste scraps.\nLivestock\nStone Barns raises cattle, chickens, sheep, pigs, goats and bees suited to the local ecosystem. The livestock farmers try to raise animals in a manner consistent with the animals' evolutionary instincts. The cattle, chickens, sheep and goats are raised on pastures kept healthy and productive through carefully managed rotational grazing. The sheep and pigs' bedding packs are regularly turned and composted. Farmers who raise animals in this fashion are frequently called \"grass farmers\" because there is so much emphasis on the health of the pastures. Strategies for maintaining the pastures include intensive paddock management so the grazed area has ample time to recover and provide a natural refuge for birds and other wildlife, essential for the maintenance of ecological balance.\nIn 2018, Stone Barns began managing 300+ acres of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve. The first season saw a multi-species intensive grazing program where pigs forage and consume food waste including spent grain from the Captain Lawrence brewery in Elmsford, New York. Cattle, sheep, goats, hens and ducks also graze the preserve's land.\nPrograms\nStone Barns offers a variety of programs for farmers, teachers and the public. Annually, the farm engages eight livestock and crops apprentices. The hands on training also includes courses on business, pollination, water and soil.\nYoung Farmers Conference\nIn 2008, Stone Barns held the first Young Farms Conference to provide inspiration and education for beginning farmers. With at least 30 percent of American farmers over 65 and only 6 percent under 35 and usually unable to purchase land, the conference aims to address farming on a smaller scale and training workshops.\nFarm & Garden Workshops\nHands-on classes for all experience levels — amateur gardeners, community garden leaders and members, regional farmers, industry professionals, and anyone interested in regenerative agriculture. Students receive firsthand training from the crops and livestock farmers.\nBlue Hill at Stone Barns\nIn spring of 2004, Blue Hill at Stone Barns opened at Stone Barns, pioneering farm-to-table dining which sources many ingredients from Stone Barns fields and pastures. In 2020, the restaurant received two stars from the Michelin Guide. Its owners, Dan, David and Laureen Barber, also own Blue Hill in New York City.\nMedia\nEpisode eight of Top Chefs fifth season was filmed at Stone Barns, where competing chefs used the restaurant's kitchen to prepare a meal for the farm's workers and their families.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.stonebarnscenter.org/ Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture]\n* [http://www.bluehillfarm.com/food/blue-hill-stone-barns Blue Hill at Stone Barns]\n* [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E3D91238F931A35751C0A9659C8B63 New York Times, 2003: The Estate Next Door]\n* [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9F00E0DD1F3BF932A15757C0A9629C8B63 New York Times, 2004: Dine at the Rockefellers', Get in Touch with the Earth]"
