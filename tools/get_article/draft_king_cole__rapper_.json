To properly create such a draft page, please see the articles  ‘Your First Article’,  ‘Referencing for Beginners’ and  ‘Easier Referencing for Beginners’. In short, \"notability\" requires reliable sources about the subject, rather than by the subject.\nPlease note that many of the references would appear to be from sources that are NOT considered  for establishing notability and should be removed (including blogs, company websites, press releases, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Spotify etc).\nAdditionally, the draft tends to read too much like a promotional CV, which Wikipedia is not; and contains prose that is not of a standard appropriate for an encyclopaedia (also see WP:PEACOCK).\nThank you for declaring your conflict of interest.\nPlease familiarise yourself with these pages before amending the draft. If you feel you can meet these requirements, then please make the necessary amendments before resubmitting the page. It would help our volunteer reviewers by identifying, on the draft's talk page, the WP:THREE best sources that establish notability of the subject.\nIt would also be helpful if you could please identify with specificity, exactly which criteria you believe the page meets (eg \"I think the page now meets WP:MUSICBIO criteria #3, because XXXXX\").\nOnce you have implemented these suggestions, you may also wish to leave a note for me on my talk page, including the name of the draft page, and I would be happy to reassess.
