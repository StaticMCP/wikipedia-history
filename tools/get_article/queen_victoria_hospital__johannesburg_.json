It was built in 1904 on Siemert Road and administered by the Guild of Loyal Woman. In 1906, it moved to Milner Park.\nIn 1913 it became a branch of the Johannesburg Hospital. In 1943 a new building was built on Sam Hancock Street, designed by Gordon Leith. The building is standing as of February 2015, although it is no longer in use.\nWhen the new Johannesburg Hospital was built, the first block was dedicated to obstetrics and gynaecology, making the Queen Victoria Hospital obsolete. It became a residential building.\nReferences"
