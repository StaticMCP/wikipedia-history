The 5th Battle Squadron was initially part of the Royal Navy's Second Fleet. During the First World War, the Home Fleet was renamed the Grand Fleet.\nHistory\nFirst World War\nAugust 1914\nIn August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was based at Portland, and consisted of a number of pre-dreadnought battleships. These were:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFollowing the loss of HMS Bulwark in 1914,  and  were transferred from the 6th Battle Squadron. With the commissioning of the five fast battleships of the Queen Elizabeth class, the remaining pre-dreadnoughts were sent to the Mediterranean.  herself was delayed in joining the squadron, instead taking part in the Dardanelles Campaign until May 1915.\nBattle of Jutland\nIn 1916, the 5th Battle Squadron—under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas— was temporarily transferred to David Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet. On 31 May, four ships of the Squadron served with distinction in the battle of Jutland. These were:\n*  Flagship of Rear Admiral H. Evan-Thomas; Captain A. W. Craig;\n*  Captain M. Woollcombe;\n*  Captain E. M. Philpotts;\n*  Captain the Honourable A. D. E. H. Boyle;\nIn the clash with the German I Scouting Group under Admiral Franz von Hipper, the 5th Battle Squadron \"fired with extraordinary  rapidity and accuracy\" (according to Reinhard Scheer), damaging the battlecruisers  and  and a number of other German warships.\nThree of the Queen Elizabeths received hits from German warships during the engagement, yet they all returned home, though Warspite—whose steering was jammed—was targeted by the German line, taking 15 hits.\nAfter the battle, HMS Queen Elizabeth—which had missed the battle due to being in dock—rejoined the squadron.\nVice and Rear-Admirals commanding\nPost holders as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !!
