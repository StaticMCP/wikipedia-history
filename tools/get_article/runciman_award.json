On some years the prize has been awarded jointly and shared between two or more authors. The award is named in honour of the late Sir Steven Runciman and is currently sponsored (since 2021) by the A. G. Leventis Foundation and the Athanasios C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation. The value of the prize is £10,000.\nRecipients\nUK prizes\nPrizes awarded for books published in the United Kingdom in the previous year:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=95%\n|- bgcolor=\"#505050\"\n!Year !!
