After graduating from college in 1933 he worked for his father's prominent Chicago advertising agency until entering the U.S. military for service during World War II in 1942.  He later relocated to Los Angeles, became a film producer, went to law school in his 40s, and long served on the board of two prominent industrial and banking corporations.\nBiography\nLasker was one of the three children of Albert Davis Lasker and Flora (née Warner).

After the war (by which time his father had left the advertising  business), Lasker moved to California, where he became a film producer in Hollywood.\nIn 1952, at age forty, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles to study law. He graduated in 1955 and began practicing, going on to serve for many years on the boards of directors of Phillip Morris, Inc. and Great Western Financial.\nPersonal life\nIn 1935 Lasker married Gimbels department-store heiress Caral Gimbel (daughter of Bernard Gimbel), who joined him as a race horse owner. The marriage ended in divorce in 1945 and Caral wed baseball star Hank Greenberg in 1946.\nIn 1947, Lasker married actress Jane Greer, with whom he had three children: Alex and Lawrence Lasker (both screenwriters and producers) and two time Grammy Award winner Steven Lasker. In 1963, Lasker married Cynthia Stone Palmer.\nLasker died in Los Angeles on July 11, 1997, aged 85.\nReferences\nSources\n* Ingham, John N.
