It was introduced at the Art Directors Guilds' 5th annual honors in 2001 alongside the award for Excellence in Production Design for a Multi-Camera, Variety, or Unscripted Series - both of which had been spun out of the previously awarded Excellence in Production Design for a TV series award.\nThe award was given until 2008, after which it was subsequently further split into half-hour and one-hour categories beginning with the 2009 ADG Awards.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Program\n! width=\"20%\" | Episode(s)\n! width=\"45%\" | Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n|- style=\"background:\n|2001(5th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |The X Files\n|Corey Kaplan (production designer)\nPhil Dagort (art director)\nSandy Getzler (art director)\nSteven R.
