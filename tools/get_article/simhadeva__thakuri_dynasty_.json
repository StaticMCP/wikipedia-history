This is because the colophons mention both the names: Simhadeva, and Shivadeva, while the chronicles only give the name of the then monarch as Shivadeva. Some historians still disagree that both were the same person, but substantial evidences points towards the fact that both the names belonged to the same monarch.\nReign\nSimhadeva was a son of Shankaradeva, who was ousted by Vamadeva in 1083. His early reign was generally peaceful and local lords had either partially or completely given their sovereignty to the monarch. However, during the later years of his reign, the feudal lords and the Jivas of Udaypur wielded extreme power and assumed for themselves the title of mahasamanta, previously used by Amshuverma and other Licchavi kings.\nSimhadeva was a religious monarch and a devoted follower of both Hinduism and Buddhism. He made donations to the Pashupatinath Temple and is also credited with the founding of Kirtipur. Simhadeva had nominated his elder son Mahendradeva as the heir apparent, but after the death of Simhadeva in 1126, Indradeva succeeded him as the king.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
