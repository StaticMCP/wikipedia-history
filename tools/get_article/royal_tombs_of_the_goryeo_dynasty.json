Most tombs are located in Kaepung County, which borders Kaesong to the west, though there are also a significant number in Changpung County, which borders Kaesong to the east. Some tombs, all unidentified, are also located within Kaesong itself.\nKoryo-era royal tombs followed the guidelines outlined in Chinese Confucian texts, such as the Book of Rites (Li Ji) and the Rites of Zhou (Zhou Li). Many factors went into consideration when deciding the location of a tomb, such as the distance from Kaesong, the distance in relation to other royal tombs, the accessibility of the location, and the tradition of Feng Shui (known as 'Pungsu' in Korean). The tomb construction also took into account traditional burial rituals of Korea and the natural environment.\nHyonnung\nHyonrung (), also known as the Tomb of King Wanggon, is the tomb of King Taejo (877-943, r. 918-943), founder of the Koryo dynasty. Taejo, who adopted that name upon ascending the throne, was the first king to unify the entire Korean peninsula after subjugation the southern states of Silla and Paekje. Construction on the tomb began after the king's death in 943. He was buried with his favorite wife, Queen Sinhye.\nThe tomb was heavily reconstructed in 1994, and all of the original buildings and statues were cleared away in order to accomplish its \"restoration\". Today, the burial chamber is open to tourists, and displays the coffins containing the remains of Taejo and his queen, as well as the tomb's original carved decorations.\nHyonrung is located on the side of Mt. Mansu in Haeson-ri, Kaepung County, and is listed as North Korean National Treasure #179. In the valley behind the tomb is the Chilrunggun, a group of seven tombs containing the remains of various princes, princesses, and concubines.\nChongrung\nChongrung () is the tomb of Queen Sinsong, a wife of King Taejo.

It is listed as North Korean Cultural Asset #553.\nHurung\nHurung () contains the remains of King Kangjong (1152–1213, r. 1211–1213), 22nd monarch of the Koryo dynasty. Almost nothing remains of it.

It is the best-preserved of the Koryo dynasty royal tombs, and a popular tourist site. Construction on the tombs began after Princess Noguk's death in 1365, and was completed seven years later in 1372. The tombs consist of a carved granite base topped with a small hill; they are surrounded by statues of sheep and tigers, representing the nations of Korea and Mongolia respectively. The \"spirit road\" up to the tombs is lined with statues of military officers and Confucian officials. Their placement was an important consideration for the king, and many geomancers, astrologers, and mathematicians were consulted to make sure the site had good feng shui. Unfortunately, the tomb's relics were lost in 1905 when the tomb chamber was blasted open with dynamite and looted by the Japanese; most of the relics inside were believed to be taken to Japan, though Kongmin's coffin is exhibited in the Koryo Museum in Kaesong.\nThe tomb is located in Haeson-ri, Kaepung County, and is listed as North Korean National Treasure #123.\nReferences\n* http://cafe.naver.com/historyexam.cafe?iframe_url=/ArticleList.nhn%3F%26search.boardtype=%26search.menuid=333%26search.clubid=15134008%26search.totalCount=151%26search.page=5\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20111007061716/http://www.vnc.nl/items/steden/kaesong.php?id=289\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20131219195853/http://north.nricp.go.kr/nrth/kor/inx/index.jsp\n* http://www.cybernk.net\nSee also\n* Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty\n* Koryo Dynasty"
