Hodges and the legalization of Same-sex marriage in the United States.]]\nIn Washington, D.C., LGBTQ culture is heavily influenced by the U.S. federal government and the many nonprofit organizations headquartered in the city.\nDemographics\nFrom 2015 to 2016, Gallup polling reported that 8.6% of District of Columbia residents identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT), a higher percentage than any U.S. state.\nThere are an estimated 209,000 LGBT people living in the broader Washington metropolitan area, making up 4.5% of the population. The Census Bureau reported that there were 6,935 same-sex households in Washington, D.C., in 2018, of which 61% were same-sex spouses. In 2017, 2.9% of all households were same-sex couple households. 77.4% of these households were male couples.\nHistory\n1950-60s\nStarting in 1950, in parallel to McCarthyism, the \"Lavender Scare\" resulted in the firing of thousands of government employees and contractors who were believed to be gay or lesbian, on the grounds of a tenuous perceived connection between homosexuality and espionage. Washington, D.C. vice squad lieutenant Roy Blick asserted to the Senate without evidence that there were 5,000 homosexual government employees. In 1961, following the Lavender Scare, Frank Kameny and Jack Nichols founded the Washington chapter of the Mattachine Society, adapting tactics learned from the civil rights movement and organizing pickets at the White House, Pentagon, and State Department.\n1970-80s\n, held since 1975.]]\nIn 1970, activists from the civil rights movement, antiwar movement, and Black Panthers created the Gay Liberation Front-DC. The group staged public demonstrations and helped organize Washington's first gay pride in May 1972. The festival took place in Lafayette Park and at George Washington University and featured a dance, a drag show, and a religious celebration.\nIn 1971, Kameny ran unsuccessfully in the 1971 District of Columbia's at-large congressional district special election.\nThe Furies Collective, a lesbian feminist collective whose members included Rita Mae Brown and Joan E. Biren, pressured the National Organization for Women to accept lesbians in the early 1970s.\nA former member of the Gay Liberation Front-DC, Deacon Maccubbin, opened Lambda Rising in 1974. The now-defunct bookstore was one of the United States' largest gay bookstores and provided a space for other community groups. Maccubbin organized the first official DC gay pride in 1975.\n, one of the largest protests in American history.]]\nIn April 1978, the Coalition of Black Gay Women & Men was founded in Washington, D.C., by A. Billy S. Jones, Delores Barry, and Darlene Hines (later Garner), with the goal of advocating for Black LGBTQ Washingtonians. The organization emerged in response to limited representation of Black gay and lesbian concerns in existing gay advocacy groups, such as the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club and the Gay Activists Alliance, which primarily represented the city’s white LGBTQ population.\nThe Coalition quickly became involved in local politics, notably participating in the 1978 mayoral election. Despite Marion Barry’s strong record on LGBTQ issues, the Coalition endorsed Sterling Tucker, emphasizing the importance of addressing racism within the LGBTQ community and ensuring Black gay voices were heard. The organization also hosted a community forum on race relations within the LGBTQ community, although it was postponed until November 1978 due to the challenges of being a new organization.\nBy 1980, the Coalition had expanded nationally, establishing chapters in cities including Philadelphia, New York, Richmond, Portland, Minneapolis, and St. Louis. The organization helped organize the first National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conference and participated in marches aligned with the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.\nIn 1979, students at Howard University created the Lambda Student Alliance, the first organization for LGBT students created at a historically black college or university. In October the same year, the National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conference took place at an unknown hotel near the university, coinciding with the first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.\nIn 1982, James Tinney created Faith Temple to cater to LGBT Christians.\nThe Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights was a large political rally that took place in Washington, D.C., on October 11, 1987.\nThe AIDS Memorial Quilt, originally created by Cleve Jones in response to the assassination of Harvey Milk was displayed on the National Mall in 1987.\n1990-2000s\non the National Mall]]\nThe March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation in 1993 generated widespread attention and included a performance by Melissa Etheridge.

Biren, this was the first time Jumbotrons were set up on the National Mall aside from government-organized events.\nThe Millennium March on Washington was an event to raise awareness and visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and issues of LGBT rights in the US, it was held April 28 through April 30, 2000.\nThe National Equality March was a national political rally that occurred October 11, 2009 in Washington, D.C.\n2010-20s\n, held in memory of the Pulse-Orlando shooting]]\nIn 2015, following the U.S. Supreme Court rulings that states must recognize same-sex marriages, the White House was lit in with the colors of the Pride flag.\nIn 2017, protesters with No Justice No Pride blocked the Capital Pride Parade near 15th Street NW and P Street NW. The group opposed Capital Pride's corporate sponsorship and cooperation with police, and accused the event of marginalizing minorities. The parade was re-routed onto 16th Street NW and towards Rhode Island Avenue, while police allowed the group to continue protesting with no arrests.\nThe National Pride March took place on June 11, 2017 alongside Capital Pride.
