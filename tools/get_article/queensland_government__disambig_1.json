Government is formed by the party or coalition that has gained a majority in the Legislative Assembly, with the governor officially appointing office-holders.  The first government was formed in 1859 when Queensland separated from New South Wales under the state constitution. Since federation in 1901, Queensland has been a state of Australia, with the Constitution of Australia regulating its relationship with the Commonwealth. Like its federal counterpart, the Queensland Government takes the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.\nQueensland's system of government is influenced by the Westminster system and Australia's federal system of government. Executive acts are given legal force through the actions of the governor of Queensland (the representative of the monarch, Charles III), although the governor in practice performs only ceremonial duties, with de facto executive power lying with the Cabinet. The Cabinet is the government's chief policy-making organ which consists of the premier and senior ministers. Each minister is responsible for exercising policy and legislation through the respective state government department.\nThe headquarters for each government department are located in the capital city of Brisbane, with most departments based at 1 William Street, a purpose-built skyscraper in the Brisbane central business district.\nExecutive power\nQueensland is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the Parliament of Queensland, which consists of the King, represented by the Governor of Queensland, and the one house, the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. De jure executive power rests formally with the Executive Council, which consists of the Governor and senior minister, but is exercised de facto by the state cabinet.\nThe Governor, as representative of the Crown, is the formal repository of power, which is exercised by him or her on the advice of the Premier of Queensland and the Cabinet. The Premier and Ministers are appointed by the Governor, and hold office by virtue of their ability to command the support of a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly.\nCurrent Ministry\nOn 27 October 2024, Crisafulli announced that he and Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie would be sworn in as an interim two-person cabinet, however which portfolios will be assigned to each of them is unknown. Crisafulli and Bleijie were formally sworn in by Governor Jeanette Young on 28 October. On 1 November 2024, the full ministry was formally sworn in, as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:#555; text-align:center; \"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Portrait\n!
