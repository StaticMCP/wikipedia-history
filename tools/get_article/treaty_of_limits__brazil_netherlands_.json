The treaty defined the border as being\nThe treaty also established the possibility of designating a joint Brazilian–Dutch commission that would physically demarcate the border with markers if that was deemed necessary. The boundary defined by the treaty is still the recognized border between Brazil and now-independent Suriname. There are no border checkpoints along the border, and much of the border region consists of impenetrable rainforest, but the boundary commission has set down 60 border markers along the Brazil–Suriname border.\nThe border described in the treaty was the result of a negotiation process between the Netherlands and Brazil and followed the establishment of the borders between Brazil and France (French Guiana, to the east) and Brazil and the United Kingdom (British Guiana, to the west. ) that were based on the same watershed. The latter borders were established after two arbitrations that were headed by Walter Hauser, President of the Swiss Confederation, and King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III, respectively.\nThe treaty was signed in Rio de Janeiro on 5 May 1906. Brazil and the Netherlands both ratified the treaty in 1908.\nSee also\n*Borders of Suriname\n*Borders of Brazil\nReferences\n*Surya P. Sharma (1997).
