The engagement occurred on June 30, 1847, between Mexican troops and or militia and an American landing force from the Mosquito Fleet under Matthew C. Perry. Not much is known but a skirmish was fought, ending in the deaths of one U.S. man, and another who died two or three days later. Five other men were wounded, not including the said sixth man who died later on. At least four of the wounded Americans were made casualties by a gunpowder barrel explosion, caused by an unknown source. Mexican casualties are unknown. The United States blockade of Tuxpan continued on.\nSee also\n* First Battle of Tuxpan\nReferences\n* Nevin, David; editor, The Mexican War (1978)\n* Bauer, K.
