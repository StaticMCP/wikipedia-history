The Almoravids achieved a resounding victory against the Catalans.\nBackground\nFollowing the loss of Zaragoza in 1118, the city of Lleida was under threat by Alfonso the Battler. For unknown reasons, Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, established an alliance with the governor of Lleida, Abdulla ibn Iyad. Ramon acted as the defender against any attack by Alfonso. Ibn Iyad would cede castles to Ramon in exchange for help against his own enemies and will pay tribute to Ramon. In 1123, Alfonso attacked Lleida. The siege ended in failure due to Ramon's intervention. Ramon was already planning to capture Lleida for himself. In October 1122, he allied with Ponç II of Empúries. Pope Callixtus II issued a crusading bull for Ramon's preparations to restore the churches in Iberia. Archbishop Olegarius was charged with managing the crusade. Ramon ordered all laymen who received tithes to go on crusade. Once preparations were done, Ramon revolted against the Almoravids.\nBattle\nLittle detail is known regarding the attack, which probably took place in 1126. The Almoravids entered the borders, causing great damage and cutting down fields, burning all towns and places on the banks of Segre and Noguera Ribagorçana. Learning of this attack, the Catalans faced the Almoravid troops near the castle of Corbins. The Almoravids, with their superiority in numbers, defeated them in a resounding battle. A bloody battle resulted in a few survivors for the Catalans. Many Catalan knights perished in this battle; among them was Bernard Raymond Count of Pallars Jussà. The Almoravid victory pushed back the defensive line by County of Urgell between Albesa and Térmens.\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Corbins led to a rise of doubts concerning a potential successful attack against the Almoravids. Alfonso met with Ramon alongside the bishops of Huesca and Roda. Both rulers agreed to an alliance against the Almoravids on the upper frontier. This alliance did not result in a campaign against the enemy, but it did postpone the Alfonso campaign surrounding Lleida to 1131.\nReferences\nSources\n*Thomas W.
