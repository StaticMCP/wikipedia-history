In the , Grahams Creek had a population of 149 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the north by the creek Grahams Creek and to the east by the Mary River.\nThe North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south (Mungar) and exits to the north (Yengarie). The locality was served by the now-abandoned Grahams Creek railway station ().\nThe land use is a mixture of grazing on native vegetation, crop growing, and rural residential housing.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from its former railway station, which in turn was derived from the creek name. The creek in turn takes its name from pastoralist Hugh Graham who established the Marianna pastoral run in 1848.\nThe construction of the railway line from Gympie to Maryborough in the late 1870s (now part of the North Coast railway line) was delayed by the difficulties of crossing Graham's Creek () which required considerable ingenuity to construct a bridge. The line was officially opened in August 1881.\nIn 1916, the railway bridge's superstructure was replaced and the bridge strengthened. This was to enable the use of the heavier B17 class locomotives.\nIn May 2012, a  saltwater crocodile was found in the Mary River between Brothers Island and the mainland near the locality of Beaver Rock, significantly further south than the normal range for such a crocodile. As per Queensland Government policy, crocodiles spotted south of the Boyne River are trapped and relocated to their natural habitat by wildlife official. However, the crocodile eluded the trap for many months, with wildlife officials reporting confirmed sightings of a second smaller crocodile in the river in July 2013. The smaller female crocodile was trapped in November 2013. In November 2014, the larger male crocodile was harpooned approximately  up the river at Grahams Creek to be relocated to Koorana crocodile farm at Rockhampton.\nDemographics\nIn the , Grahams Creek had a population of 157 people.\nIn the , Grahams Creek had a population of 149 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Grahams Creek. The nearest government primary school is Mungar State School in neighbouring Mungar to the south. The nearest government secondary school is Aldridge State High School in Maryborough to the north-east.\nReferences"
