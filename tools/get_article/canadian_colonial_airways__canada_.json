(\"Incorporated\"), a United States airline, notwithstanding the name. The two airlines operated joint service between New York City and Montreal.\nOn October 15, 1939, the American parent sold 51% of the Canadian subsidiary's stock to meet restrictions on the citizenship of owners of Canadian carriers and in March 1940, they reduced their ownership of the Canadian subsidiary further, to 24.5%.\nPursuant to the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) of the United States certificated Incorporated as a United States scheduled airline on January 9, 1940. Thereafter, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which succeeded the CAA in 1940, regulated Incorporated as a trunk carrier.\nHowever, on August 13, 1941, the CAB rejected a permit for Limited to operate to the US as a foreign air carrier, because such permits were restricted to foreign airlines operating foreign-registered aircraft, and during the qualification period, Limited operated US-registered aircraft. The CAB directed Limited to stop flying in the United States and on June 30, 1942, Limited ceased operations.\nOn April 30, 1942, Incorporated changed its name to Colonial Airlines, Inc.\nCities served\nSurviving airline timetables for the 1928-1942 timeframe (some of which are marked as being the Canadian or American versions of the airline) show the following:[http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/ca1.htm Colonial Airlines – CCA – Canadian Colonial Airways][http://www.airtimes.com/cgat/usa/colonial.htm Colonial Airlines]\n*Albany, New York\n*Buffalo, New York\n*Montreal, Quebec\n*Newark, New Jersey\n*Ottawa, Ontario\n*Toronto, Ontario\n*Troy, New York\nSee also\n* List of defunct airlines of Canada\nReferences"
