Napoleon also promised to furnish the Shah with arms, officers and workmen. France on its side required the Shah to declare war against the United Kingdom, to expel all British people from Persia, and to maintain an open way if France wanted to attack British possessions in the far east.\nDespite the treaty, France failed to achieve diplomatic success in Persia, and none of its provisions were fully implemented. Furthermore, just two months after signing the treaty with Persia, France concluded the Treaties of Tilsit with Russia, effectively abandoning Iran in its struggle against Russian expansion.\nOn 12 March 1809, the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Persia forcing the French out of that country.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Franco-Persian alliance\n*Pierre Amédée Jaubert\n*Claude Matthieu, Count Gardane\n*François Mulard\n*List of treaties"
