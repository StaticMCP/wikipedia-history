Traditional knowledge GIS differ from ordinary cognitive maps in that they express environmental and spiritual relationships among real and conceptual entities. This toolset focuses on cultural preservation, land rights disputes, natural resource management, and economic development.\nTraditional knowledge GIS analyze the nature of political and social struggles that lead to competing resource claims. They are powerful tools for mediation and negotiation among coexisting social groups.\nTechnical aspects\nTraditional knowledge GIS employs cartographic and database management techniques such as participatory GIS, map biographies, and historical mapping.\nParticipatory GIS encourages public involvement in all aspects of a GIS, and is widely accepted as necessary for sound environmental and economic planning in developing areas. This method incorporates sacred sites and traditional land use practices into scientific analysis. Participatory GIS can be effective for local resource management and planning, but researchers doubt its efficacy as a tool in attaining land tenure or fighting legal battles because of lack of expertise among local individuals and lack of access to technology.\nMap biographies track the practices of local communities either for the sake of preservation or to argue for resource protection or land grants. This also allows for the recording and playing of oral histories and representations of abstract ecological knowledge.\nHistorical mapping analyzes and documents events that are meaningful to a particular tradition or locale. Cultural and humanitarian benefits can be derived from including maps in the historical record of an area.\nCultural preservation\nAs adherents to traditional lifestyles decline in population, a degree of urgency has developed around the collection of data and wisdom from aging local elders. A central feature of cultural preservation is language revitalization. Bilingual visual and auditory maps depict oral traditions and historical information in places of cultural significance at various scales and levels of detail.\nResearchers encounter significant obstacles to data acquisition due to the sensitive nature of much of the data sought for a traditional knowledge GIS, and locals may distrust the motives of outside consultants.\nLand rights and natural resource management\nTraditional knowledge GIS can influence debates over land rights and resource management in ecologically sensitive areas. The interests of local residents in these regions often conflict with those of migrant workers, state conservation units, and domestic and foreign mining or logging enterprises. GIS hardware and software are used to identify spatial trends in interpreting these conflicts.\nEconomic development\nEconomic development through traditional knowledge GIS is subject to local ownership over the systems and full access to relevant data and training.  This situation is rare outside of industrialized nations, so little progress has been made in this field of research.\nCurrent issues and effectiveness\nThere is a disparate nature to implementations of traditional knowledge GIS across geographies. Though developing nations utilize some forms of participatory GIS, their communities are less likely to gain access to expensive databases and cartographic methods compared to those in developed nations.\nThe overall effectiveness of traditional knowledge GIS has not been conclusively determined. Those who advocate for traditional mapping cite successes in acquiring land titles, managing local databases, and creating new skill sets for local communities worldwide. However, detractors cite cost, the need for specialized training, and cultural differences as reasons GIS may be inappropriate for these applications.\nSoftware\nNo cost or open-source software\nThe Nunaliit Atlas Framework was developed by and is maintained by the Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre at Carleton University. The focus of this software is to create community atlas projects.\nCommercial software\nThe CEDAR tool has a number of modules focused on contact relationship management, consultation for development projects, heritage projects and GIS.\nThe LOUIS toolkit is a suite of tools for recording, managing and using traditional land use and traditional knowledge information.\nSee also\n*Participatory 3D modelling (P3DM)\n*Participatory GIS\nReferences"
