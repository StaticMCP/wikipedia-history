      "text": "# Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials__disambig_1\n\nin New Orleans being taken down on May 19, 2017.]]\nThere are more than 160 Confederate monuments and memorials to the Confederate States of America (CSA; the Confederacy) and associated figures that have been removed from public spaces in the United States, all but five of them since 2015. Some have been removed by state and local governments; others have been torn down by protestors.\nMore than seven hundred monuments and memorials have been created on public land, the vast majority in the South during the era of Jim Crow laws from 1877 to 1964. Efforts to remove them began after the Charleston church shooting, the Unite the Right rally, and the murder of George Floyd later increased.\nProponents of the removal of the monuments cite historical analysis which supports their belief that the monuments were not built as memorials, instead, they were built to intimidate African Americans and reaffirm white supremacy after the Civil War; and that they memorialize an unrecognized, treasonous government, the Confederacy, whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of slavery. They also argue that the presence of these memorials more than a hundred years after the defeat of the Confederacy continues to disenfranchise and alienate African Americans. However, opponents believe that the removal of the monuments is the erasure of history, or they believe that it is a sign of disrespect for their Southern heritage. Some Southern states passed state laws restricting or prohibiting the removal or alteration of public monuments.\nAccording to The Washington Post, five Confederate monuments were removed after the Civil War, eight in the two years after the Charleston shooting, 48 in the three years after the Unite the Right rally, and 110 in the two years after George Floyd's murder. In 2022, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he would order the renaming of U.S. military bases which are named after Confederate generals, as well as the renaming of other Defense Department property that honors Confederates.\nThe campaign to remove monuments has been extended beyond the United States; around the world, many statues and other public works of art which are related to the transatlantic slave trade and European colonialism have been removed or destroyed.\nBackground\n, by year of establishment]]\nMost of the Confederate monuments on public land were built during periods of racial conflict, such as the period when Jim Crow laws were being passed during the late 19th century as well as at the start of the 20th century or the period of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.}} These two periods also coincided with the 50th and 100th year after the end of the Civil War, including the American Civil War Centennial.  The peak in construction of Civil War monuments occurred between the late 1890s up to 1920, with a second smaller peak in the late-1950s to mid-1960s.\nAcademic commentary\nIn an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy, the American Historical Association (AHA) said that to remove a monument \"is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history\". The AHA said that most monuments were erected \"without anything resembling a democratic process\", and recommended that it was \"time to reconsider these decisions\". Most Confederate monuments were erected during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century, and this undertaking was \"part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South\". Memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period \"were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life\". A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA, \"these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes.\"\nMichael J. McAfee, curator of history at the West Point Museum, said, \"There are no monuments that mention the name Benedict Arnold. What does this have to do with the Southern monuments honoring the political and military leaders of the Confederacy? They, like Arnold, were traitors. They turned their backs on their nation, their oaths, and the sacrifices of their ancestors in the War for Independence.... They attempted to destroy their nation to defend chattel slavery and from a sense that as white men they were innately superior to all other races. They fought for white racial supremacy. That is why monuments glorifying them and their cause should be removed. Leave monuments marking their participation on the battlefields of the war, but tear down those that only commemorate the intolerance, violence, and hate that inspired their attempt to destroy the American nation.\"\nUniversity of Chicago historian Jane Dailey wrote that in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a \"white supremacist future\". Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at Villanova University agrees: \"White supremacy is really what these statues represent.\"\nHistorian Karyn Cox of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte has written that the monuments are \"a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era\". University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill historian James Leloudis wrote, \"The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule.\"\nAdam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at Washington College, told National Geographic, \"They're 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people.\" Goodheart said that the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise. Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and a scholar of Civil War history, said, \"If white nationalists and neo-Nazis are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again\".\nElijah Anderson, a professor of sociology at Yale University, said the statues' continued existence \"really impacts the psyche of black people\". Harold Holzer, the director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, argued that this was intentional: the statues were designed to belittle African Americans. Dell Upton, chair of the Department of Art History at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote that \"the monuments were not intended as public art,\" but rather were installed \"as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity,\" and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent, their removal from civic spaces was a matter \"of justice, equity, and civic values\".}}\nIn a 1993 book on the issue in Georgia, author Frank McKenney argued otherwise: \"These monuments were communal efforts, public art, and social history,\" he wrote. Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women, the \"mothers widows, and orphans, the bereaved fiancees and sisters\" of the soldiers who had died. Many ladies' memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War, most of them joining the United Daughters of the Confederacy following its inception in 1894. The women were advised to \"remember that they were buying art, not metal and stone.\"\nCheryl Benard, president of the Alliance for the Restoration of Cultural Heritage, argued against the removal of Confederate war monuments in an op-ed written for The National Interest: \"From my vantage point, the idea that the way to deal with history is to destroy any relics that remind you of something you don't like, is highly alarming.\"\nCivil War historian James I. Robertson Jr. said that the monuments were not a \"Jim Crow signal of defiance\". He called the current climate to dismantle or destroy Confederate monuments as an \"age of idiocy\", motivated by \"elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of Americans have painfully constructed\".\nBut Dell Upton argues that the monuments celebrated only one side of the story, one that was \"openly pro-Confederate\". The monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved. Robert Seigler, who documented more than 170 Confederate monuments in South Carolina, found only five dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy to build fortifications or \"had served as musicians, teamsters, cooks, servants, and in other capacities\". Four of those were to slaves and one to a musician, Henry Brown.\nAlfred Brophy, a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues \"facilitates forgetting,\" although these statues were \"re-inscribed images of white supremacy\". Brophy said that the Lee statue in Charlottesville should be removed.\nJulian Hayter, a historian at the University of Richmond, supports a different approach for the statues: re-contextualization. He supports adding a \"footnote of epic proportions\" such as a prominent historical sign or marker that explains the context in which they were built to help people see old monuments in a new light. \"I'm suggesting we use the scale and grandeur of those monuments against themselves. I think we lack imagination when we talk about memorials. It's all or nothin'.... As if there's nothin' in between that we could do to tell a more enriching story about American history.\"\nHistory\nin Charlottesville, Va. sparked protests and counter-protests, resulting in three deaths.]]\nJust five Confederate memorials were removed in the century-and-a-half after the Civil War. The modern effort to remove them was sparked by the Charleston church shooting of 2015. In the two years that followed, eight memorials were removed. In the city of New Orleans, a crane had to be brought in from an unidentified out-of-state company as no local company wanted the business.\nThe removal movement was further galvanized by the August 2017 Unite the Right rally, which gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest the proposed removal of its Robert Edward Lee statue.  The rally saw deadly violence and the public display of white supremacist symbols. Within days, other cities moved to remove similar memorials. In Baltimore, for example, the city's Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15–16, 2017. Mayor Catherine Pugh said that she ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety. Similarly, in Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray asked the city council on August 16, 2017, to approve the removal of two statues from a courthouse.\nWithin three years of the Charleston shooting, at least 114 Confederate monuments were removed from public spaces, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which published an extensive report in 2016 of Confederate memorials in public spaces and keeps an up-to-date list online. Texas removed 31, more than any other state.\nA 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of American adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. According to Reuters, \"responses to the poll were sharply split along racial and party lines, however, with whites and Republicans largely supportive of preservation. Democrats and minorities were more likely to support removal.\" Another 2017 poll, by HuffPost/YouGov, found that 48% of respondents favored the \"remain\" option, 33% favored removal, and 18% were unsure. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll released in 2017 found that most Americans, including 44% of African Americans, believe that statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy should remain in place.\nIn 2017, Jason Spencer, a white member of the Georgia legislature, told an African-American colleague that if she continued calling for removal of Confederate monuments, she wouldn't be \"met with torches but something a lot more definitive,\" and that people who want the statues gone \"will go missing in the Okefenokee....Don't say I didn't warn you.\"\nVarious groups of proponents met March 22–24, 2018, in New Orleans \"to commemorate, celebrate and strategically align Take 'Em Down efforts\". A second such conference was held March 22–24, 2019, in Jacksonville, Florida.\nIn April 2020, a study found that Confederate monuments were more likely to be removed in localities that had a large black and Democratic population, a chapter of the NAACP, and Southern state legislatures that have the power to decree removal. Public support for removal increased during the George Floyd protests, with 52% in favor of removal, and 44% opposed.\nMost of the removals have been undertaken by state and local governments, while a relative few memorials were pulled down by protestors. For example, the bust of Robert E. Lee in Fort Myers, Florida, was toppled by unknown parties during the night of March 11–12, 2019. At least three were demolished by protestors in states that had passed laws to make it more difficult to legally remove them: Silent Sam, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; the Confederate Soldiers Monument in Durham, North Carolina; and the Screven County Confederate Dead Monument, in Sylvania, Georgia. The latter two were damaged beyond repair, while Silent Sam, which was not seriously damaged, was placed in storage, awaiting a political decision on its fate. The \"Confederate Dead Monument\" was replaced through funds raised by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Years\n!Removals\n|-\n|1865–2009 || 2\n|-\n|2009–2014 || 3\n|-\n|2015 (after Charleston church shooting) || 4\n|-\n|2016 || 4\n|-\n|2017 (year of the Unite the Right rally) || 36\n|-\n|2018 || 8\n|-\n|2019 || 4\n|-\n|2020 (after murder of George Floyd) || 94\n|-\n|2021 || 17\n|-\n|2022\n|16\n|}\nLegal impediments\nSeven states have passed laws that impede or forbid the removal or alteration of public Confederate monuments. Laws in Georgia (early 20th century), North Carolina (2015), and Alabama (2017) prohibit removal or alteration. Laws in South Carolina (2000), Mississippi (2004), and Tennessee (2013, updated 2016) impede such actions.\nA 1902 law in Virginia was repealed in 2020; other attempts to repeal state laws have not been successful.\nIn 2023, Florida Republican Dean Black filed legislation that would punish any lawmakers who vote to remove \"historical monuments and memorials\". Under this bill, if local lawmakers vote in favor of the removal of Confederate statues, they may be fined or removed from office by the governor. The bill died in committee in March 2024.\nTennessee law\nIn 2016, Tennessee passed its Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which requires a two-thirds majority of the Tennessee Historical Commission to rename, remove, or move any public statue, monument, or memorial. A 2018 amendment passed in response to events in Memphis (see below) prohibits municipalities from selling or transferring ownership of memorials without a waiver, and \"allows any entity, group or individual with an interest in a Confederate memorial to seek an injunction to preserve the memorial in question\". The New York Times wrote in 2018 that the Tennessee act shows \"an express intent to prevent municipalities in Tennessee from taking down Confederate memorials\".\nAs of 2022, the Tennessee Historical Commission has considered seven petitions to remove a Confederate monument and approved just one: for the Forrest bust in the state capitol.\nSouth Carolina law\nThe removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature, as would the removal of any other Confederate monument in South Carolina.\nNorth Carolina law\nA state law, the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015, prevents local governments from removing monuments on public property, and places limits on their movement within the property. In August 2017, Governor Roy Cooper asked the North Carolina Legislature to repeal the law, writing: \"I don't pretend to know what it's like for a person of color to pass by one of these monuments and consider that those memorialized in stone and metal did not value my freedom or humanity. Unlike an African-American father, I'll never have to explain to my daughters why there exists an exalted monument for those who wished to keep her and her ancestors in chains...We cannot continue to glorify a war against the United States of America fought in the defense of slavery. These monuments should come down.\" He also asked the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to \"determine the cost and logistics of removing Confederate monuments from state property\". Cooper later removed, on the grounds of public safety, three Confederate monuments at the North Carolina Capitol that the legislature had in effect made illegal to remove.\nAfter the University of North Carolina renamed Saunders Hall in 2014 (see below), its Board of Trustees prohibited further renamings for 16 years.\nIn 2019, North Carolina's law prohibiting monument removal was challenged indirectly. The Confederate Soldiers Monument in Winston-Salem was removed as a public nuisance, and a similar monument in Pittsboro was removed after a court ruled that it had never become county property, so the statute did not apply.\nVirginia law\nOn March 8, 2020, the Virginia legislature \"passed measures that would undo an existing state law that protects the monuments and instead let local governments decide their fate\". On April 11, 2020, Governor Ralph Northam signed the bill into law, which went into effect on July 1. Previously, the state law had prohibited local governments from taking the monuments down, moving them, or even adding placards explaining why they were erected.\nAlabama law\nAlabama's law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, was passed in May 2017. On January 14, 2019, a circuit judge ruled that the law is an un-Constitutional infringement on the City of Birmingham's right to free speech, and cannot be enforced. On November 27, 2019, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed that ruling by a vote of nine to zero. In their decision, the court stated that \"a municipality has no individual, substantive constitutional rights and that the trial court erred by holding that the City has constitutional rights to free speech.\"\nUnsuccessful federal legislation\nOn July 22, 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 305–113 to remove a bust of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney from the old robing room next to the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol Building. The bill (H.R. 7573 (116th)) would also have removed statues honoring Confederate figures and create a \"process to obtain a bust of [Justice [[Thurgood Marshall|Thurgood] Marshall]]...and place it there within a minimum of two years.\" The bill reached the Republican-led Senate on July 30, 2020 (S.4382 (116th)) and was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration, which took no further action on it.\nVestigial pedestals\nThe empty pedestals or plinths left after monument removal have met various fates.\nIn Baltimore, one of the four empty plinths was used in 2017 for a statue of a pregnant black woman, naked from the waist up, holding a baby in a brightly covered sling on her back, with a raised golden fist: Madre Luz (Mother Light). The statue was first placed in front of the monument before its removal, then raised to the pedestal. Artist Pablo Machioli said \"his original idea was to construct a pregnant mother as a symbol of life. 'I feel like people would understand and respect that'\". The statue was vandalized several times before it was removed by the city.\nFor the toppled Silent Sam monument at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, two scholars proposed leaving the \"empty pedestal — shorn all original images and inscriptions — [which] eliminates the offending tribute while still preserving a record of what these communities did and where they did it.... The most effective way to commemorate the rise and fall of white supremacist monument-building is to preserve unoccupied pedestals as the ruins that they are — broken tributes to a morally bankrupt cause.\" Instead, the plinth and its plaques were removed on January 14, 2019, at the direction of university Chancellor Carol Folt.\nThe plinths of the statues in Richmond, Virginia, were removed in 2022. In some of Richmond's Monument Avenue intersections, the spotlights remain—pointed upward toward now-empty space.\nList of removals\nNational\nIn 2000, the U.S. Army renamed Forrest Road - named for Confederate general and Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest - at Fort Bliss after receiving complaints. The road was renamed Cassidy Road after Lt. Gen. Richard T. Cassidy, a former post commander.\nIn February 2020, the commandant of the Marine Corps, General David H. Berger, ordered \"the removal of all Confederate-related paraphernalia from Marine Corps installations\", including Confederate flags, bumper stickers, and \"similar items\".\nThe U.S. Navy has similarly prohibited the display of the Confederate flag, including as bumper stickers on private cars on base; a wave of corporate product re-branding has also ensued.\nIn 2021, Congress ordered the Defense Department to establish a commission to consider whether to rename various bases, ships, buildings, streets, and other things named to honor Confederate figures. In 2022, this Naming Commission recommended changing the names of nine Army bases, two Navy ships, and other items. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to follow the commission's recommendations.\nIn May 2022, the first part of the Naming Commission's report recommended changing the names of nine Army bases:\n* Fort Benning, Georgia, was renamed Fort Moore, in honor of Lt. Gen. Hal Moore and his wife Julia Moore.\n* Fort Bragg, originally named in honor of Confederate General Braxton Bragg, was renamed Fort Liberty in 2023. The Fort was renamed back to Fort Bragg in 2025 in honor of WWII veteran Roland L. Bragg.\n* Fort Gordon, Georgia, was renamed Fort Eisenhower.\n* Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, was renamed Fort Walker, in honor of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, the first female Army surgeon.\n* Fort Hood, Texas, was renamed Fort Cavazos, in honor of Gen. Richard E. Cavazos, who won the Distinguished Service Cross during the Korean War.\n* Fort Lee, Virginia, was renamed Fort Gregg-Adams on April 27, 2023, in honor of Lt. Gen. Arthur J. Gregg and Lt. Col. Charity Adams\n* Fort Pickett, Virginia, was renamed Fort Barfoot on March 24, 2023, in honor of Colonel Van T. Barfoot, who received the Medal of Honor for service during World War II.\n* Fort Polk, Louisiana, was renamed Fort Johnson, in honor of Sgt. William Henry Johnson, who performed heroically in the first African American unit of the United States Army to engage in combat in World War I.\n* Fort Rucker, Alabama, was renamed Fort Novosel on April 10, 2023, in honor of Army aviator CW4 Michael J. Novosel, who received the Medal of Honor for service in Vietnam.\nThe last of these changes were finalized in October 2023.\nBy December 2022, the Naming Commission had also directed the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, to rename buildings, roads, and other facilities. West Point also removed several displays related to former superintendent Robert E. Lee, including a portrait, bust, quotation, and bronze panels depicting him and members of the Ku Klux Klan.\nAlabama\n* Alabama State Capitol, Montgomery: On June 24, 2015, in the wake of the Charleston church shooting on June 17, 2015, on the order of Governor Robert J. Bentley, the four Confederate flags and their poles were removed from the Confederate Memorial Monument.\n* Anniston\n** The monument to Confederate artillery officer John Pelham, erected in 1905, was removed by the city on September 27, 2020.  It was rededicated March 26, 2022, on public (county) property. An Alabama law prohibiting the removal of historical monuments was deliberately broken by the city council of Anniston, Alabama.\n* Birmingham\n** The Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was erected in 1905. In the midst of the George Floyd protests, was removed by the city on June 1, 2020, in violation of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, a law passed specifically to prevent the removal of this monument. It was the most prominent Confederate monument in the state. The Alabama Attorney General has filed suit against the city of Birmingham for violating the statute; the city could be fined $25,000 for the violation but cannot be forced to restore the monument. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city.\n* Demopolis\n** Confederate Park. Renamed \"Confederate Park\" in 1923 at the request of&nbsp;the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A Confederate soldier statue was erected in 1910 at the intersection of North Main Avenue and West Capital Street adjacent to the Park. It was destroyed on July 16, 2016, when a policeman accidentally crashed his patrol car into the monument. The statue fell from its pedestal and was heavily damaged. In 2017, Demopolis city government voted 3–2 to move the damaged Confederate statue to a local museum and to install a new obelisk memorial that honors both the Union and the Confederate soldiers.\n* Huntsville\n** The statue of an unnamed Confederate soldier which stood outside the Madison County Courthouse in downtown Huntsville since 1905 was removed on October 23, 2020.\n* Mobile\n** In 2020, a statue of Confederate Navy Admiral Raphael Semmes removed from downtown on orders of Mayor Sandy Stimpson. The $25,000 fine was paid by July 10.\n* Montgomery\n** The statue of Robert E. Lee in front of the Robert E. Lee High School was removed on June 1, 2020. Four people were charged with felony criminal mischief. In November 2022, the Montgomery school board announced the school would be renamed to Dr. Percy L. Julian High School after Percy Lavon Julian.\n* Tuscaloosa\n** In September 2020, the University of Alabama trustees renamed Morgan Hall, named for a Confederate general and U.S. Senator John Tyler Morgan, to the English Building.\nAlaska\n* Kusilvak Census Area: In 1913, Judge John Randolph Tucker named the Wade Hampton Census Area to commemorate his father-in-law. It was renamed Kusilvak Census Area in 2015 to remove a place named for a slave-holding Confederate general.\nArizona\n*Picacho Peak State Park: A wooden marker dedicated to Col. Sherod Hunter's Arizona volunteers was removed by Arizona State Parks & Trails in 2015. Deterioration of the wood was the supposed cause of the removal.\n*Wesley Bolin Plaza, Arizona State Capitol, Phoenix: Regifted in a letter by the UDC dated June 30, 2020, to the State stating \"These monuments were gifted to the State and are now in need of repair but due to the current political climate, we believe it unwise to repair them where they are located.\" Removed July 22, 2020.\n*Jefferson Davis Highway Marker, U.S. 60 at Peralta Road, near Apache Junction: Regifted in a letter by the UDC dated June 30, 2020, to the State stating \"These monuments were gifted to the State and are now in need of repair but due to the current political climate, we believe it unwise to repair them where they are located.\" Removed July 22, 2020.\n*Picacho Peak State Park: A brass plaque honoring Confederate soldiers who fought there was vandalized and removed in June 2020. According to officials from Arizona State Parks and Trails and the Arizona Historical Society (AHS), it will not be replaced. Stated one AHS official, \"Times change. We probably put our name on a few things we shouldn't have.\"\nArkansas\nIn 2017, the Arkansas Legislature voted to stop honoring Robert E. Lee's birthday.\nIn 2019, the Arkansas Legislature voted to replace Arkansas's two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Uriah Milton Rose, an attorney and founder of the Rose Law Firm, advised against secession, but backed the Confederacy during the war; while not a soldier or elected officeholder, he served the Confederacy as chancellor of Pulaski County, later being appointed the Confederacy's state historian.  A statue of white supremacist progressive era-Governor James Paul Clarke was also removed. They will be replaced with statues of Johnny Cash and journalist and state NAACP president Daisy L. Gatson Bates, who played a key role in the integration of Little Rock's Central High School in 1957.\n* Fort Smith:\n* Little Rock:\n** Confederate Boulevard was renamed Springer Boulevard in 2015. The new name honors an African-American family prominent in the area since the Civil War.\n**Memorial to Company A, Capitol Guards, removed June 2020\n* Pine Bluff\n**Pine Bluff Confederate Monument, removed from public area June 2020\nCalifornia\ns around former site of Jefferson Davis Highway marker in Horton Plaza, San Diego on August 16, 2017]]\n* Springtown: Established 1868. Originally known as Springtown, it was renamed Confederate Corners after a group of Southerners settled there in the late 1860s. Name changed back to \"Springtown\" in 2018.\n* Los Angeles\n** Confederate Monument, Hollywood Forever Cemetery. \"Covered with a tarp and whisked away in the middle of the night after activists called for its removal and spray-painted the word 'No' on its back\", August 15, 2017.\n* San Diego\n** Markers of the Jefferson Davis Highway, installed in Horton Plaza in 1926 and moved to the western sidewalk of the plaza following a 2016 renovation. Following the Unite the Right rally in Virginia, the San Diego City Council removed the plaque on August 16, 2017.\nDistrict of Columbia\nin Washington, D.C., on July 2, 2020, after the statue was toppled by protesters]]\n* U.S. Capitol, National Statuary Hall Collection\n** Alabama's statue of Confederate officer Jabez Curry was replaced by a statue of Helen Keller in 2009.\n** In 2019, the Arkansas Legislature voted to replace Arkansas's statues; see above.\n** In July 2022, Florida's statue of Edmund Kirby Smith was replaced by a statue of civil rights advocate and educator Mary McLeod Bethune.\n**On December 21, 2020, a statue of Robert E. Lee representing Virginia was removed to be replaced by a statue of civil rights activist Barbara Rose Johns.\n* Confederate Memorial Hall, a brownstone row house at 1322 Vermont Avenue NW, just off Logan Circle, was a gathering place for Confederate veterans in Washington, D.C., and later, a social hall for white politicians from the South. The organization that owned it, the Confederate Memorial Association, keeps active [https://confederate.org/hall.html the 1997 web page]  that lists paintings and artifacts at this self-designated \"Confederate Embassy\". The building was seized and sold in 1997 to pay $500,000 in contempt-of-court fines imposed by District of Columbia courts on association president John Edward Hurley. It then became a private residence.\n*On June 19, 2020, protesters in the movement protesting the murder of George Floyd tore down the statue of Albert Pike, doused it with a flammable liquid and ignited it. After several minutes, local police intervened, extinguished the flames, and left the scene. The statue was taken away later on. In August 2025, the NPS announced the statue would be restored.\nFlorida\nAn August 2017 meeting of the Florida League of Mayors was devoted to the topic of what to do with Civil War monuments.\n* State symbols\n** Until 2016, the shield of the Confederacy was found in the Rotunda of the Florida Capitol, together with those of France, Spain, England, and the United States – all of them treated equally as \"nations\" that Florida was part of or governed by. The five flags \"that have flown in Florida\" were included on the official Senate seal, displayed prominently in the Senate chambers, on its stationery, and throughout the Capitol. On October 19, 2015, the Senate agreed to change the seal so as to remove the Confederate battle flag from it. The new (2016) Senate seal has only the flags of the United States and Florida.\n* Bradenton\n** On August 22, 2017, the Manatee County Commission voted 4–3 to move the Confederate monument in front of the county courthouse to storage. This granite obelisk was dedicated on June 22, 1924, by the Judah P. Benjamin Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. It commemorates Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and Jefferson Davis, and the \"Memory of Our Confederate Soldiers\". On August 24, while being moved (at 3 AM), the spire toppled and broke. The clean break is repairable, but the County recommends it not be repaired until a new home is found. No final decision has been made as of September 2018, but the Gamble Plantation Historic State Park has been suggested as a possible new home for it.\n* Crestview\n** Florida's Last Confederate Veteran Memorial, City Park (1958). In 2015, ownership was transferred to trustees of Lundy's family and the memorial was moved to private property. Soon after, research determined the memorialized man had not been a veteran but had falsified his age to get veteran benefits. After the removal of the Confederate monument and flag, the park is now referred to as the \"former Confederate Park\".\n* Daytona Beach\n** In August 2017, the Daytona Beach city manager made the decision to remove three plaques from Riverfront Park that honored Confederate veterans.\n* Fort Myers\n** The bust of Robert E. Lee, on a pedestal in the median of Monroe Street downtown, was found face down on the ground on March 12, 2019; the bolts holding it in place had been removed. It did not appear to be damaged, and was removed by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The bust had been commissioned in 1966 from Italian sculptor Aldo Pero for $6,000 by the defunct Laetitia Ashmore Nutt Chapter of UDC, chapter 1447. In 2018 there had been conflict over the future of the monument, both at a Ft. Myers City Council meeting and at the monument itself.\n* Gainesville\n** Confederate monument called \"Old Joe\", Alachua County courthouse lawn, erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and unveiled January 20, 1904.

The city chipped in $200.\" In May 2018, the Lakeland City Commission approved unanimously the removal of the statue to Veterans Park. However, they specified that private funds would have to cover the costs. In six months, only $26,209 was raised, so commissioners voted in November \"to use $225,000 in red light camera citation money to pay for the move\". A coalition of individuals and groups opposed to the move, including the Sons of Confederate Veterans, filed suit in federal court alleging that the money being used was public money, but the suit was dismissed in January 2019 \"as a matter of law\", and the city proceeded, noting that it will be moved in the daytime. The move started on March 21, 2019.\n* Orlando\n** Confederate \"Johnny Reb\" monument, Lake Eola Park. Erected in 1911 on Magnolia Avenue; moved to Lake Eola Park in 1917.

The new shield was in place in 2016.\n** The Confederate Stainless Banner flag flew over the west entrance of the Florida State Capitol from 1978 until 2001, when Gov. Jeb Bush ordered it removed.\n]]\n* Tampa\n** In 1997, county commissioners removed the Confederate flag from the Hillsborough County seal. In a compromise, they voted to hang a version of the flag in the county center. Commissioners voted in 2015 to remove that flag. In 2007 the county stopped honoring Confederate History Month.\n** In June 2017, the Hillsborough County School Board started a review of how to change the name of Robert E. Lee Elementary School in east Tampa. In September 2017, the school was seriously damaged by fire of accidental origin. Teachers and students were transferred, and the school with this name went out of existence.\n** Memoria In Aeterna (\"Eternal Memory\"), Old Hillsborough County Courthouse, in 2017 Annex to the current Courthouse. \"The monument is  two Confederate soldiers: one facing north, in a fresh uniform, upright and heading to battle, and the other facing south, his clothes tattered as he heads home humbled by war. Between them is a 32-foot-tall obelisk with the image of a Confederate flag chiseled into it.\" It was called \"one of the most divisive symbols in Hillsborough County\". It was first erected in 1911 at Franklin and Lafayette Streets, and moved to its former location, in front of the then-new county courthouse, in 1952. After voting in July 2017 to move the statue to the small Brandon Family Cemetery in the suburb that bears its name (Brandon, Florida), the County Commission announced on August 16 that the statue would only be moved if private citizens raised $140,000, the cost of moving it, within 30 days. The funds were raised within 24 hours. The following day Save Southern Heritage, Veterans' Monuments of America, and United Daughters of the Confederacy filed a lawsuit attempting to prevent the statue's move. On September 5, 2017, a Hillsborough administrative judge denied their request for an injunction. Removal of the monument, which took several days, began the same day. It was cut into 26 pieces to enable its removal. It was moved on September 5, 2017, to the Brandon Family Cemetery; the county paid half the $285,000 cost.\n** A  x  Confederate flag—when erected, the largest such flag ever made—at the privately owned Confederate Memorial Park, placed so as to be visible at the intersection of I-4 and I-75, just east of Tampa (actually Seffner, Florida), was removed on June 1, 2020, by its owner, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, after threats to burn it were made on social media.\n* West Palm Beach\n** Confederate monument, Woodlawn Cemetery (1941), located at the front gate, directly behind an American flag. \"The only one south of St. Augustine, likely the only Confederate statue in Palm Beach and Broward counties, said historian Janet DeVries, who leads cemetery tours at Woodlawn.\" Vandalized several times. Removed and placed in storage by order of Mayor Jeri Muoio on August 22, 2017, since its owner, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, had not claimed it despite notification. \"Believed by local historians to be the last Confederate monument in Palm Beach County.\"\n** Jefferson Davis Middle School. Renamed Palm Springs Middle School in 2005.\nGeorgia\n* State flag: From 1956 to 2001 the state flag of Georgia incorporated the Confederate battle flag. The current (2003) flag incorporates a less familiar version of the Confederacy's first flag, the Stars and Bars.\n* Confederate Memorial Day and Robert E.

The monument had been erected on Confederate Memorial Day, April 26, 1909, and moved to the city cemetery in the 1950s when the city turned the downtown Main Street park – where the monument was originally located – into a parking lot. The Georgia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans is offering a $2,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of those involved; the reward was subsequently increased to $10,000. A photo of the destroyed monument shows a flagpole with a Confederate flag.\nIndiana\n* Indianapolis: On June 8, 2020, following the protests in response to the murder of George Floyd, the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was removed from Garfield Park and dismantled. It originally marked a mass grave for Confederate soldiers who died at Camp Morton, but was moved away from the grave in 1912.\nKansas\n* Wichita: Confederate Flag Bicentennial Memorial (1962, removed 2015). The Confederate battle flag had been displayed at the John S.

It was removed on June 13, 2020.\n* Lexington\n** John C. Breckinridge Memorial (1911) and John Hunt Morgan Memorial (1887), Fayette County Courthouse. In November 2015, a committee, the Urban County Arts Review Board, voted to recommend removal of both memorials. The city council approved the removal on August 17, 2017.  They were removed October 17, 2017, with the plan to move both to Lexington Cemetery. On July 24, 2018, this was accomplished.\n* Louisville\n** The Confederate Monument in Louisville statue was dedicated in 1895 and was placed next to the University of Louisville on city property.

Lee High School, renamed Lee High School in 2016, Lee Magnet High School in 2018, and in 2020, Liberty Magnet High School. Sports teams, formerly Rebels, are now Patriots.\n* New Orleans: The first Confederate monuments removed in 2017 were those of New Orleans, although it was in 2015 that the City Council ordered their removal. Court challenges were unsuccessful. The workers who moved the monuments were dressed in bullet-proof vests, helmets, and masks to conceal their identities because of concerns about their safety. According to Mayor Landrieu, \"The original firm we'd hired to remove the monuments backed out after receiving death threats and having one of his cars set ablaze.\" \"Opponents at one point found their way to one of our machines and poured sand in the gas tank. Other protesters flew drones at the contractors to thwart their work.\" The city said it was weighing where to display the monuments so they could be \"placed in their proper historical context from a dark period of American history\". On May 19, 2017, the Monumental Task Committee, an organization that maintains monuments and plaques across the city, commented on the removal of the statues: \"Mayor Landrieu and the City Council have stripped New Orleans of nationally recognized historic landmarks. With the removal of four of our century-plus aged landmarks, at 299 years old, New Orleans now heads into our Tricentennial more divided and less historic.\" Landrieu replied on the same day: \"These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.\"A seven-person Monument Relocation Committee was set up by Mayor LaToya Cantrell to advise on what to do with the removed monuments. The statue of Jefferson Davis, if their recommendation is implemented, will be moved to Beauvoir, his former estate in Biloxi, Mississippi, that is now a presidential library and museum. The Committee recommended that the statues of Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard be placed in Greenwood Cemetery, near City Park Avenue and Interstate 10 (where three other Confederate generals are entombed). However, this conflicts with a policy of former mayor Mitch Landrieu, who had directed that they never again be on public display in Orleans Parish. The Battle of Liberty Place Monument will remain in storage.\n**Battle of Liberty Place Monument – Erected 1891 to commemorate the Reconstruction Era Battle of Liberty Place (1874) and celebrate Louisiana's White League.

In 1992, the School Board announced plans to rename schools named after owners of slaves, if the parents, teachers, and children of each school approved. Other public schools renamed, not directly relevant to the war, were originally named for Marie Couvent (a black slave owner), George Washington, William C. C. Claiborne, Samuel J. Peters, Étienne de Boré, William O. Rogers (\"a general school superintendent who didn't believe blacks should be educated after the 5th grade\"), and Edward Douglass White, Jr., a Supreme Court chief justice who voted to uphold the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n*** Jefferson Davis Elementary School renamed in 1993 for Ernest \"Dutch\" Morial, New Orleans' first African-American mayor.\n*** P.G.T.

Installed in 1965, removed in August 2017.\nMaryland\n* State of Maryland\n** State Song: In 2021 Maryland officially repealed its state song, Maryland, My Maryland, due to controversial lyrics that call on Maryland to join the Confederacy and label the Union as tyrannical. In March 2021, both houses of the Maryland General Assembly voted to repeal the state song and governor Larry Hogan signed it into law on May 18, 2021. Since then, Maryland has had no official state song. Previously in 2017, the University of Maryland marching band announced it would no longer play the song before football games and in 2020, Pimlico Race Course scrapped its tradition of playing the song before the race.\n* Plaque (1964): Maryland State House Trust removed a plaque from the Maryland State House in 2020.\n** Sons of Confederate Veterans Commemorative License Plate featuring the Confederate battle flag was revoked in 2015 after an 18-year legal battle.

Maryland That We Through Life May Not Forget to Love The Thin Gray Line Erected A.D. 1913 / 1861 CSA 1865.\" (Gray was the color of Confederate uniforms.) The dedication was on June 3, 1913 (Jefferson Davis's birthday), and 3,000 (out of a county population of 30,000) attended. It was originally located in a small triangular park called Courthouse Square. In 1971, urban renewal led to the elimination of the Square, and the monument was moved to the east lawn of the Red Brick Courthouse (no longer in use as such), facing south. In 1994 it was cleaned and waxed by the Maryland Military Monuments Commission. It was marked with \"Black Lives Matter\" in 2015; a wooden box was built over it to protect it.

The timing coincided with the work New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's committee on monuments, and Hallman's article was distributed to members of New York's Public Design Commission. The commission voted unanimously to remove Sims's statue, and it was removed in April 2018. Hallman has since written articles about Sims's statue in Montgomery, Alabama, and is working on a book, The Anarcha Quest, about Sims and his so-called \"first cure\", Anarcha Westcott.\n**Brooklyn\n*** On August 16, 2017, the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island removed a 1912 plaque from a tree Robert E.

As of November 1, 2024, the University has not decided whether or where the statue will be restored. In her January 19, 2019, letter of resignation as Chancellor, Carol Folt ordered the removal of the plinth and plaques as a threat to public safety, as they attracted pro-Confederate demonstrators unconnected with the University. A proposal to build a special museum on the campus for the statue was rejected as too expensive and wasteful of resources. A scandal erupted in late 2019 after the press reported a secret agreement to transfer the monument to the Sons of Convederate Veterans, with funding. This deal collapsed once it was exposed. As of November 2024 the statue remains in an undisclosed University of North Carolina warehouse, and its fate remains undecided.\n** The Orange County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously on October 16, 2018, to remove the Jefferson Davis Highway designation from the portion of US 15 that runs through the county.

The bronze plaque and stone pedestal were not removed immediately because it was not clear who their owner was.\n* Charlotte:\n** In 2015, the Mecklenburg County Confederate Soldiers Monument (1977) was vandalized following the events of the Charleston church shooting on June 17. In July, the monument was removed from its location at the northwest corner of the Old City Hall for cleaning. Later that same month, the \"Historic Artifact Management and Patriotism Act\" became law while the monument was still located in a city-owned warehouse. With a technicality, city manager Ron Carlee informed the City Council that he was moving the monument to the Confederate section of city-owned Elmwood Cemetery. By end of year, it was moved, next to other Confederate monuments and graves.\n** The Confederate Reunion Marker (1924), located on a hill next to Grady Cole Center and American Legion Memorial Stadium, was removed on June 21, 2020, after the Mecklenburg County Commission became aware of online threats to damage or deface it.

The base currently remains on the Courthouse grounds.\n* Durham:\n** Confederate Soldiers Monument (1924) at the Old Durham County Courthouse, was pulled down and severely damaged during a protest on August 17, 2017. Eight individuals were arrested for destroying the memorial, but the charges were later dropped. The monument is being stored in a county warehouse. In early 2019, a joint city-county government committee to consider what to do with the damaged statue, recommended that it be displayed indoors in its crumpled state. \"The committee said displaying the statue in its current damaged form would add important context. The proposal would leave the statue's pedestal in place and add outdoor markers honoring Union soldiers and enslaved people.\" The proposal needs approval from the Durham County Commission. Durham County maintains that the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015 does not apply, since the law does not address damaged monuments. On August 11, 2020, contractors removed the stone pedestal and moved it to a secure location following the recommendation of the City-County Committee on Confederate Monuments and Memorials.\n** Statue of Robert E. Lee in the Duke Chapel, Duke University. Installed in the 1930s in consultation with \"an unnamed Vanderbilt University professor\". Defaced in August 2017.

The decision of its removal was done by its owner, the J.E.B. Stuart Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), in an effort so the monument would not be vandalized. It is not known if it will be returned, moved or stay in storage indefinitely. This was its third location, originally located at the intersection of Grove, Green, Rowan, and Ramsey Streets; it moved to the northeast corner of the square in 1951 due to road realignments. In 2002, the statue was then moved to its last location, by the UDC, believing the original site lost its charm becoming to commercialized.\n* Gastonia: On June 23, 2020, the Gaston County Commissioners approved creating a council of understanding to give a recommendation to the commissioners about the future of the Gaston County Confederate Soldiers Monument (1912), located at the Gaston County Courthouse along Marietta Street.

Churton St., was built in 1934 and housed the (whites only) public library. The UDC donated $7,000 towards its construction, and it was named the Confederate Memorial Library. In 1983, after the library (now the Orange County Public Library) moved into a larger facility, the Museum moved in. The word \"Library\" was removed from the lettering over the front door, but \"Confederate Memorial\" remained. In 2015, the Hillsborough Town Board voted to remove the words.\n* Lexington: In October 2020, the United Daughters of the Confederacy requested that a Confederate monument owned by the organization which stood at the city square in Lexington since 1902 be removed.

The monument was placed in storage until a new location was determined. This was the second location of the monument; it was first located in front of the Granville County Courthouse till 1971, when it was moved to the library as a compromise from the Oxford Race Riot.\n* Pittsboro: Confederate Soldiers Monument (1907), Old Chatham County Courthouse; erected by Winnie Davis Chapter, UDC. In 2019, there were \"months\" of discussion about what to do with it, including \"multiple late-night Chatham County Board of Commissioners meetings\". There were citizens' groups calling for its removal (\"Chatham for All\") and for leaving it alone. As it is privately owned (by the UDC), the statute protecting public Civil War monuments does not apply, said the County. In July 2019, the local UDC chapter and the county \"signed a memorandum of understanding, agreeing to 'meet, cooperate, and work together in good faith to develop a mutually agreeable framework for \"reimagining\" the monument.'\" In an August 12 statement, the UDC said the statue was given by the UDC to the county, which now owns it, \"notwithstanding the statement on the south side of the statue carved in granite\", the state statute does apply, and \"is inappropriate that we re-imagine the statue in any way\". After a court ruled that the statue belonged to the UDC and not the county, it was removed on November 20, 2019.\n* Raleigh:\n** A Confederate battle flag hanging in the Old North Carolina State Capitol was removed in 2013.\n** On June 19, 2020, protesters pulled down two of the three bronze soldiers on the  Confederate monument at the state Capitol, with one of the statues hung by its neck from the streetlight.

Two of the three monuments, the Women of the Confederacy (1914) and a statue of Henry Lawson Wyatt (1912), were removed that day and moved into storage. The third, what remains of the monument to fallen Confederate soldiers (1895) was removed from June 21–23. Governor Cooper laid blame to the 2015 law as creating legal roadblocks to removal that eventually led to the dangerous incidents that happened. The two cannons that flanked 75-foot Confederate monument were moved to Fort Fisher on June 28.\n* Reidsville: From 1910 to 2011, the monument stood in Reidsville's downtown area. In 2011, a motorist hit the monument, shattering the granite soldier which stood atop it.

The city's Twitter page posted at 5:28&nbsp;a.m.: \"In accordance with NC law, the city has temporarily removed two monuments from the downtown area. This was done in order to protect the public safety and to preserve important historical artifacts.\" It is not known where the monuments are stored or what the plans for them will be.\n* Winston-Salem: The Confederate Soldiers Monument (1905), formerly in front of the former Forsyth County Courthouse, now private apartments, was removed on March 12, 2019, by the city, due to safety concerns and the property owner's unwillingness to maintain it. Mayor Allen Joines said that the statue would be moved to Salem Cemetery after being temporarily in storage. It was vandalized with paint in August 2017 and again late in 2018 with the words \"Cowards & Traitors\" written with black marker. The UDC, its owner, declined to move it to the Salem Cemetery after the city proposed it. On December 31, 2018, the city attorney sent a letter to the UDC saying that the monument is a threat to public safety and calling for its removal by January 31. \"And if they don't, we're prepared to file legal action to achieve that removal\", said  Joines. The owner of the property, Clachan Properties, also asked the UDC to remove it. The local chapter of the UDC sued the city and county on May 4, 2020, claiming the city did not own the statue and did not have the right to remove it.

Confederate Park (1908) was renamed Memphis Park; Jefferson Davis Park (1907) was renamed Mississippi River Park; and Forrest Park (1899) was renamed Health Sciences Park. The vote of the City Council was unanimous. At the time the monuments were dedicated, African Americans could not use those parks.\n** Jefferson Davis Monument in Memphis Park, 1904/1964.

After exploring legal remedies, the city of Memphis decided to sell the two parks to a new non-profit, Memphis Greenspace, whose president was a county commissioner, for $1,000 each. Memphis Greenspace removed the statue, under police guard, the same day, December 20, 2017. The Sons of Confederate Veterans sued the city, but their suit was unsuccessful.

Calls for its removal started in 2017 by then-House Speaker Joe Straus, in a letter to the State Preservation Board that oversees the Capitol grounds, in which he was joined by 40 other lawmakers.\n** The Texas Confederate Museum closed in 1988. Opened in 1903 in a room on the first floor of the Capital, it moved in 1920 to the adjacent Old Land Office Building, where it remained until 1998, much longer than the building had been used by the Land Office. When the building was vacated for renovation, the Museum was not permitted to return. (The building is now the Capital Visitors Center.) It never reopened as it never found another home. Its collections are now divided between the Haley Memorial Library and History Center in Midland and the Texas Civil War Museum in White Settlement, a suburb of Fort Worth.\n** Robert E.

Previous messages had included \"Davis must fall\" and \"Liberate U.T.\" (the University of Texas). The University of Texas officials convened a task force to determine whether to honor the students' petition for removal of the statue. Acting on the strong recommendation of the task force, UT's President Gregory L. Fenves announced on August 13, 2015, that the statue would be moved to serve as an educational exhibit in the university's Dolph Briscoe Center for American History museum. He said: \"it is not in the university's best interest to continue commemorating him [Davis] on our Main Mall.\" Legal action by the Sons of Confederate Veterans was unsuccessful.

Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston, and Confederate Postmaster John H. Reagan. They were dedicated in 1933. On August 20–21, 2017, the university removed the three Confederate statues from the Austin campus grounds and moved them to a museum. The decision was inspired by the Unite the Right rally on August 10–11 in Charlottesville.

In June 2019, the city sold it in an online auction for $1,435,000, on condition that it not be displayed in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\n**Thomas Jefferson High School's sports mascot changed from Rebels to Patriots \"in the 1970s\".\n**William L.

In April, the City Council voted to sell the statue. In May a six-month court injunction staying the removal was issued as a result of legal action by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and others. The prospect of removal, as well as the park renaming, brought numerous white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other alt-right figures to the Unite the Right rally of August 2017, in which there were three fatalities. In June 2016 the pedestal had been spray painted with the words \"Black Lives Matter\", and overnight between July 7 and 8, 2017, it was vandalized by being daubed in red paint. On August 20, 2017, the City Council unanimously voted to shroud the statue, and that of Stonewall Jackson, in black. The Council \"also decided to direct the city manager to take an administrative step that would make it easier to eventually remove the Jackson statue\".

In 1986, the UDC, who oppose memorials to John Brown, erected at the entrance to the Jefferson County Courthouse a bronze plaque \"in honor and memory of the Confederate soldiers of Jefferson County, who served in the War Between the States\". The local newspaper, Spirit of Jefferson, and a group of local African Americans called for its removal. On September 7, 2017, the Jefferson County Commission voted 5–0 to let the plaque be.  The group Women's March West Virginia attended each County Commission meeting holding signs that say \"Remove the plaque\".

Removal of the stone monument, which contains the names of the soldiers buried there, did not take place immediately because of legal challenges and logistical concerns. On October 2, 2018, the Madison City Council voted 16–2 for its removal, overruling a Landmark Commission's recommendation that it stay.\n*** In January 2019, a stone cenotaph etched with the names of Confederate 140 prisoners of war was removed from the cemetery by the Madison Parks Department and transferred to storage at the Wisconsin Veterans Museum.\nBrazil\n* From 1975 to 1998, a version of the Confederate battle flag appeared on the shield and the flag of Americana, Brazil, a city which was settled by Confederate expatriates.\nCanada\n* Montreal:\n**In 1957, the United Daughters of the Confederacy had a plaque installed on the outer wall of a Hudson's Bay Company store, commemorating Jefferson Davis's brief stay in the city; the plaque was removed following the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally of August 2017, in response to public complaints.\n* Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia:\n**When it was built in 1958, the Tallahassee Community School was named after the Confederate cruiser , which a local pilot had guided around nearby Lawlor Island in August 1864 to avoid Union warships rumored to be monitoring the main entrance to Halifax Harbour. Although nominally a reference to the pilot's navigational feat, the name grew controversial due to the Confederacy's support of slavery, and the school was renamed Horizon Elementary School in March 2021.\n* Kincardine, Ontario:\n**A monument outside the Kincardine public library, dedicated in 1910 to former Confederate Army physician Solomon Secord and referencing his Civil War service, was removed in 2023 to facilitate road construction.
