In 1928 he was confirmed as a lieutenant in the reserves. On 1 March 1930 he transferred to the Territorial Army (TA) as a lieutenant in the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry.  By 1939 he was a major and in May 1939 was elected as Member of Parliament for Birmingham Aston. He was also a big game hunter.\nThe Second World War saw him fighting in Tunisia as a colonel of the Royal Armoured Corps. Kellett is prominently featured in Keith Douglas' memoir 'Alamein to Zem Zem', where he is referred to under the pseudonym 'Piccadilly Jim'.
