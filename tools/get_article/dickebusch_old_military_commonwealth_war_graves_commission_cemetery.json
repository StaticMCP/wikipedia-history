It was used until March 1915, when a new cemetery was established in the village.\nThe cemetery was used again in May 1940, for ten British troops killed during the retreat after the invasion of Belgium by Nazi forces.\nThe cemetery was designed by J R Truelove.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=2159307 Dickebusch Old Military Cemetery] at Find a Grave"
