The Banu Lahyan were situated deep in the heart of Hijaz on the borders of Mecca, and due to deep-seated blood-revenge between the Muslims on the one hand, and Quraish and the Arabians on the other.\nWhen the power of the allied Confederates collapsed and they began to slacken and resign to the current unfavourable balance of power, Muhammad seized this rare opportunity and decided that it was time to take justice on Banu Lahyan.\nInvasion\nMuhammad set out in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal or Jumada Al-Ula in the year six Hijri (July 627 AD) with 200 Muslim fighters and made a feint of heading for Syria, then soon changed route towards Batn Gharran, the scene of where 10 Muslims were killed in the Expedition of Al Raji. Bani Lahyan were on Alert and got the news of his march, the tribe then immediately fled to the mountain tops nearby and thus remained out of his reach. On his way back, Muhammad despatched a group of ten horsemen to a place called Kura‘ Al-Ghamim, in the vicinity of the habitation of Quraish in order to indirectly confirm his growing military power. All these skirmishes took 14 days, after which he left back for home.\nIslamic sources\nHadith literature\nThe event is mentioned in the Sahih Muslim hadith collection:\n}}\nSee also\n*List of battles of Muhammad\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*Muslim–Quraysh War\n*Banu Quraysh\nNotes"
