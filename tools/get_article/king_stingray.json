With a sound self-described as \"Yolŋu surf rock\", the band perform songs with lyrics in both English and Yolŋu Matha. King Stingray released their debut single, \"Hey Wanhaka\", in October 2020, and their self-titled debut album on 5 August 2022.\nOrigins\nSeveral of the band's founding members have known one another since childhood, and have deep roots in Arnhem music history. Former lead vocalist Yirrŋa Yunupiŋu is the nephew of Dr M. Yunupiŋu, and guitarist Roy Kellaway is the son of Stuart Kellaway, who were both founding members of Yothu Yindi. The pair, as well as current lead vocalist Dimathaya Burarrwanga, who is the grandson of Warumpi Band frontman  George Burarrwanga, all grew up together on the same street in the community of Yirrkala. The trio, joined by bassist Campbell Messer, formed King Stingray in 2020. They signed to The Chats' Bargain Bin Records in 2020. The following year, Lewis Stiles joined as the group's drummer.\nCareer\nKing Stingray's debut single, \"Hey Wanhaka\", written by Yirrnga Yunupiŋu and Roy Kellaway, was released in October 2020.\nIn January 2021, King Stingray released \"Get Me Out\"; a song described by Double J as \"a tribute to the importance of home\". According to a press statement, the song was written following a family member of the band getting lost in Melbourne when they were on tour with Yothu Yindi. The band said: \"She had no phone, [and] Yolŋu style, she navigated her way back to us miraculously and we now laugh about it.\" Dan Condon from the ABC said \"It's as catchy as it is stirring and will no doubt help this new band continue to win the hearts of a broad range of music lovers.\" Lewis Stiles joined on drums in early 2021.\nIn August 2021, King Stingray signed with Cooking Vinyl Australia (a partner of Sony Music) and released \"Milkumana\"; a song described by triple j as being \"about the power of passing on knowledge\". The music video was filmed in the band's hometown of Yirrkala, and features tribal elders Mangatjay Yunupingu and Malŋay Yunupingu. In January 2022, both \"Milkumana\" and \"Get Me Out\" charted in the triple j Hottest 100 at number 56 and 46, respectively.\nIn March 2022, King Stingray released \"Camp Dog\". The title refers to the dogs that wander the streets of Yirrkala. The following month, the band supported Midnight Oil at the latter's final headlining show in Sydney on their Resist tour. In May 2022, King Stingray released the single \"Let's Go\" and announced their debut self-titled album. The album was released on 5 August 2022.\nIn July 2022, King Stingray were featured on the cover of NME Australia for an in-depth interview feature about their debut album, conducted by Torres Strait Islander freelance journalist Rhianna Patrick. In the same month, they did a Like a Version cover of Coldplay's \"Yellow\" using  a combination of the original English lyrics as well as Yolŋu Matha.\nIn October 2022, King Stingray released a cover of Men at Work's \"Down Under\" as part of a new campaign for Tourism Australia.\nIn June 2023, King Stingray released \"Lookin' Out\". August 2023 saw King Stingray win three AIR Awards: Best Independent Rock Album or EP, Independent Album of the Year, and Breakthrough Artist of the Year. They were also winners at the 2023 National Indigenous Music Awards and along with Wildfire Manwurrk were the only groups to win more than one. King Stingray picked up the Film Clip of the Year and Song of the Year awards for \"Lets Go\".\nIn December 2023 they performed at the ABC New Year's Eve concert at Sydney Harbour. The group's second studio album, For the Dreams, was released in November 2024.\nIn March 2025, the band announced that founding member Yirrŋa Yunupiŋu was no longer part of the band, with Yolŋu performer Ngalakan Wanambi stepping in. From late March to early April 2025, the band held a tour for their recent album For the Dreams at various major cities across the country. This followed a successful tour the previous year in the United States, where they supported fellow Australian rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard.\nBand members\n;Current members\n* Roy Kellaway – guitar, backing vocals (2020–present)\n* Dimathaya Burarrwanga – guitar, vocals, yiḏaki, bilma (2020–present), lead vocals (2024–present)\n* Lewis Stiles – drums, backing vocals (2020–present)\n* Campbell Messer – bass, banjo, backing vocals (2020–present)\n* Ngalakan \"Billy\" Wanambi – yiḏaki, backing vocals, lead vocals, bilma (2025–present)\n;Former members\n* Yirrŋa Yunupiŋu – lead vocals, bilma (2020–2025; inactive 2024–2025)\n* Yimila Gurruwiwi – yiḏaki, backing vocals (2022–2025)\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| King Stingray\n|\n* Released: 5 August 2022\n* Label: Cooking Vinyl Australia\n* Format: Streaming, vinyl, CD, digital download\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| For the Dreams\n|\n* Released: 8 November 2024\n* Label: Cooking Vinyl Australia\n* Format: Streaming, vinyl, CD, digital download\n| 51\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of singles\n! scope=\"col\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Album\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Hey Wanhaka\"\n| 2020\n|rowspan=\"6\"| King Stingray\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Get Me Out\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2021\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Milkumana\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Camp Dog\"\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 2022\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Let's Go\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Lupa\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Down Under (Under One Sun)\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Lookin' Out\"\n| 2023\n|rowspan=\"3\"| For the Dreams\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Through the Trees\"\n|rowspan=\"6\"| 2024\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Best Bit\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Octopus\"(with Bluey)\n| Rug Island\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Cat 5 (Cyclone)\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"| For the Dreams\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Light Up the Path\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Oysters in My Pocket\" (Like a Version)  (with Jem Cassar-Daley)\n|\n|-\n|}\nAwards and nominations\nAIR Awards\nThe Australian Independent Record Awards (commonly known informally as AIR Awards) is an annual awards night to recognise, promote and celebrate the success of Australia's Independent Music sector.\n!\n|-\n| 2022\n| \"Get Me Out\"\n| Independent Song of the Year\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 2023\n| rowspan=\"2\"| King Stingray\n| Independent Album of the Year\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n| Best Independent Rock Album or EP\n|\n|-\n| \"Camp Dog\"\n| Independent Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n| King Stingray\n| Breakthrough Independent Artist of the Year\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2025\n| rowspan=\"2\"| For the Dreams\n| Independent Album of the Year\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Best Independent Rock Album or EP\n|\n|-\nAPRA Awards\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\".
