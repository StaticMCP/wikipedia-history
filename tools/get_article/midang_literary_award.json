('Midang' is a penname of Seo Jeong-ju). In 2001, it was established with the Hwang Soon-won Literature Award in the novel section. The prize money is 30 million won.\nOn the other hand, the Writers Association of Korea argues the abolition of the literary award in connection with the pro-Japanese activities of Midang.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
