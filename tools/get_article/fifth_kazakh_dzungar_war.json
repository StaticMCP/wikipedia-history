The roots of the conflict lie in the 17th-century geopolitical shifts that saw the rise of the Dzungar Khanate as a major power and the fragmentation of the Kazakh Khanate.\nFollowing the decline of the Uzbek Khanate, the Kazakh Khanate emerged as the dominant power in the steppe, but by the mid-17th century, it faced internal divisions into three Jüzes (hordes) and external pressure from the expanding Dzungar Khanate. The Dzungars, having consolidated their state in the region between the Tengeri and Altai mountains, began campaigns westward into Lake Balkhash and the Ili River region.\nThe immediate prelude to the Fifth War was marked by the reign of Dzungar leader Tsewang Rabtan (1697–1727), who significantly strengthened the Dzungar military and pursued an aggressive expansionist policy. Meanwhile, the Kazakh Khanate remained politically divided, with the three Jüzes often acting independently and lacking unified leadership, making them vulnerable to a coordinated Dzungar attack.\nBy early 1723, the stage was set for a final, decisive confrontation that would determine control of the entire Kazakh steppe and its vital trade routes and pasturelands.\nCourse of the War\nDzungar invasion (1723)\nIn February–March 1723, Dzungar commanders suddenly attacked the Kazakh nomadic camps of the Senior and Middle Jüzes, concentrating their main forces along a wide front from the upper reaches of the Irtysh river to the Chu and Talas rivers. The attack occurred during a difficult season for the Kazakhs the time of livestock lambing and the transition to spring pastures. The uluses were in their wintering areas and scattered, and therefore were unable to organize resistance. The Kazakhs of the Senior and part of the Middle Jüz crossed the Syr Darya river above the mouth of the Chirchik and retreated toward Samarkand and Bukhara. The Junior Jüz crossed the Syr Darya in its middle reaches and fled to Khiva, as well as north and northwest toward the borders of the Russian Empire — to the territories of the Yaik Cossacks, Bashkirs, and Kalmyks. The politically fragmented Kazakhs were caught completely unprepared. Their resistance collapsed. The Dzungar army swept across the steppe, capturing and sacking the Southern Kazakhstan and Jetisu, defeating the Kazakh militia which lost the city of Tashkent and Sairam. The new Uzbek territories now included Khujand, Samarkand, and Andijan which were reliant on Dzungar protection. Furthermore, they captured the Fergana Valley as well.  a detachment of Oirats attacked deep into territory previously controlled by the Kazakhs, including the cities of Turkistan.\nFirst Kazakh offensive against Kalmyks (July–December 1723)\nIn mid July 1723, Ayuka dispatched his envoy, Kuzytush to Abulkhair Khan in an attempt to negotiate peace. While traveling near the Temir River, the Kalmyk delegation encountered a 15,000-strong Kazakh force led personally by Abulkhair. The Kazakh khan reportedly declared:\nFollowing this exchange, three of the Kalmyk envoys were executed, while the other seven were taken captive. Abulkhair then pushed forward into the Trans-Volga region, aiming to expel Kalmyk and Russian presence from both sides of the Yaik River and extend Kazakh nomadic grounds toward the northwest. The swift Kazakh advance compelled Kalmyk taishis -- Dorzhi Nazarov, Khoshot-Dondok, and Lekbey—to withdraw quickly from the Yaik’s left bank toward Krasny Yar.\nBy August 5, Yaik colonel Zakharov had informed the Astrakhan authorities that a force of 5,000 Kazakh and Karakalpak fighters had crossed the Yaik and moved west, threatening Russian settlements as well as Kalmyk and Mari camps. In response, Ayuka Khan asked Astrakhan governor A.P. Volynsky for military support; Volynsky subsequently dispatched artillery and six squadrons of Russian troops to reinforce the Kalmyks.\nLater in August, Abulkhair’s troops overran the uluses of Taisha Lekbey, which consisted of roughly 2,000 families. The clashes resulted in the Kazakhs capturing numerous prisoners and livestock, many of which were later sold to Dorzhi Nazarov. After this victory, the Kazakhs advanced further into Kalmyk-held territory. That autumn, Kazakh forces also seized 5,000 Kalmyk kibitkas from the uluses of Ayuka and Lubzhi.\nAlarmed by the Kazakh incursions into the Kalmyk Khanate, the Russian imperial government issued a decree to Ayuka in December 1723, urging his assistance in countering the joint Kazakh–Karakalpak offensive:\nSubsequently, joint forces under Ayuka and Dosang succeeded in stopping Abulkhair’s detachments from advancing further, though minor clashes continued along the front.\nBy early 1724, large-scale fighting along the Kazakh–Kalmyk border had diminished, with the exception of a Karakalpak raid in January on Kalmyk camps near Guryev town. However, in the spring of that year, Abulkhair continued his military campaign.\nSecond Kazakh offensive against Kalmyks (March–August 1724)\nIn early March, a combined Kazakh–Karakalpak force of 13,000 soldiers crossed into the left bank of the Volga. Approximately 60 km from Saratov, they assaulted the uluses of Dorzhi Nazarov, capturing 50 Kalmyks and seizing 8,500 head of livestock. Nearby Kalmyk encampments were also raided, resulting in 400 people taken captive and 13,600 animals stolen. On March 20, 1724, Astrakhan official S. P. Shakhmatov documented fighting on the meadow side of the Volga, as well as a battle near the Elton area, where Kalmyk casualties totaled 60 killed and 60 captured, while the Kazakhs lost 55 men killed or captured.\nDuring April, Karakalpak forces again struck Kalmyk camps near Guryev. They broke into the Kalmyk encampment but were eventually driven back by Russian artillery fire.\nDetermined to retain Kalmyk control over the Volga’s left bank, Dorzhi Nazarov prepared for a pitched battle. By August, he had assembled an army of 18,000, while evacuating civilian Kalmyk populations toward the Volga under the protection of guard units and Russian troops.\nIn early August, Kalmyk scouts crossed the Yaik River and engaged a Karakalpak reconnaissance party before pulling back. Shortly afterward, the Oirats were pursued by the Karakalpaks and drawn into combat, though most of the Kalmyk detachment managed to escape. Scouting reports estimated the Kazakh army’s strength at around 10,000. Nazarov’s assembled forces were deemed sufficient to repel a Kazakh assault. For their part, Kazakh commanders delayed a full-scale offensive against the Volga Kalmyk settlements, hoping to rely on the element of surprise.\nOn August 21, a small detachment under Kazakh batyr -- Eset attacked and overran the ulus of Lubzhi before withdrawing. However, the Kalmyk ruler quickly mobilized his forces and caught up with the Kazakhs in the Uzeni area. In the ensuing battle, the Kazakh detachment was nearly wiped out—only eight men survived, including Eset himself.\nAccording to Russian historian L. A. Bobrov, the Battle of Uzeni diminished the Kazakh army’s military potential and underscored the difficulty of conquering Kalmyk territory. In contrast, Kazakh historian R.Zh. Temirgaliev argues that the victory was largely propagandistic, since the overall military successes still favored the Kazakh side.\nDespite the August defeat, Abulkhair Khan had significantly weakened the Kalmyk Khanate’s military strength and eliminated the threat of a Kalmyk attack on the Junior Jüz. After this, the Kazakh khan shifted his military operations to the Southeastern Front.\nSouth Eastern Theatre (1725)\nWhilst on the Southeastern Theatre, the Kazakhs, led by Abulkhair Khan, liberated Turkistan with five thousand troops, but in the spring of 1725, the Dzungars captured the city again. During the darkest days, large-scale battles were impossible. The Kazakh resistance took the form of Guerrilla Tactics with Small, mobile detachments of Kazakh batyrs harrying Dzungar supply lines, attacked scouting parties, and conducted raids. This constant pressure wore down the occupiers.\nKalmyk offensive and the Ulus Devastations (August 1725)\nFollowing Abulkhair’s defeat in the Syrdarya region in 1725, roughly 10,000 Kazakh kibitkas moved northwest toward Kalmyk pastures, believing the Kalmyks had withdrawn to the Volga’s right bank. However, after discovering the Kalmyks still held their positions, the Kazakhs reversed course and halted along the Emba River.\nIn early August 1725, a Kalmyk force of 20,000 troops commanded by Galdan-Dandjin advanced eastward, traveling from the Yaik to the Emba in just nine days. Upon encountering the first Kazakh encampments, the Kalmyks destroyed approximately a thousand yurts. From another Kazakh ulus consisting of 10,000 yurts, they seized livestock and horse herds in what became known as the \"Ulus devastation.\"\nAs Dorzhi Nazarov’s forces returned toward the Yaik, he discovered that several thousand Kazakh and Karakalpak fighters were pursuing them. Nazarov remained near the Yaik and sent a reconnaissance detachment toward Kazakh positions.\nThe August campaign led by Galdan-Dandjin, by the Kalmyk rulers’ own admission, produced limited results. As one account notes: “From the Karakalpaks and the Kazakhs we were in great fear, and from our campaign achieved little, except that we further provoked and angered them.”\nThird Kazakh offensive against Kalmyks (September–October 1725-1726)\nIn September 1725, Kazakh forces opened a new offensive. A Kalmyk escapee from captivity reported that 17,000 Kazakh troops were advancing toward Kalmyk territories, ostensibly to negotiate peace but actually planning to destroy Yaik town and settle their uluses along the Yaik River.\nOn October 6, Saratov authorities documented that 400 Karakalpaks had raided Kalmyk uluses near the Ryn Sands, taking prisoners and livestock. Later, on October 30, a combined Kazakh–Karakalpak army of 17,000 men appeared in the Karakum area. According to Samara commandant Kushnikov, their goal was to capture the Cossack town, ravage Kalmyk uluses, cross the Volga, and escape to the Kuban.\nIn February 1726, Kalmyk high priest Shakur-Lama informed V. P. Beklemishev that the previous autumn, a 10,000-strong Kazakh force under Khans Abulkhair and Sameke assaulted Lekbey's ulus and defeated it. However, Kalmyk nobles rallied a 20,000-strong army and routed the Kazakh detachment. Several smaller Kazakh groups were driven to the Caspian Sea and wiped out, while the main force was encircled near the Yaik.\nWith timely Russian artillery support, the Kalmyks dealt a decisive blow to the Kazakh detachment, inflicting between 1,000 and 2,000 casualties and forcing Kazakh leaders to agree to a truce. The Kalmyks recovered all captured property and took 13 (or, by some accounts, 60) amanats along with their attendants.\nLiberation of Southeastern Kazakhstan\nIn 1726, a meeting of representatives from the Kazakh juzes took place in Ordabasy near Turkestan, which decided to organize another militia. The committee chose Abilhair Khan who was the leader of the Younger juz to be a commander of an army. After the meeting, the militia of the three Juzes united and were headed by Abulhair and Bogenbai Batyr who in the Battle of Bulanty, defeated the Dzungar troops, which occurred in the foothills of Ulytau, in the Karasyir area. This was the first, over many years, a major victory for Kazakhs over the Dzungars that gained a moral and strategic recognition. The terrain where this battle took place was called \"Kalma қırılғan\" – \"a place where the Kalmaks were exterminated\".\nIn 1727, Tsewang Rabtan died which caused a rivalry between the contenders and heirs to the throne with most of the competition revolving around the sons of Tsewang Rabtan who were Lausan Shono and Galdan Tseren. Galdan Tseren, after defeating his brother Lausan Shono for the power, had to deal with a two-front war conflict. This internal Dzungar weakness provided the Kazakhs with a critical window of opportunity to consolidate their forces and prepare for a final, decisive confrontation.\nIn November 1728, Sameke Khan sent a special embassy to the Volga Kalmyks for peace negotiations. The talks led to mutual reconciliation, allovwing the Kazakh khans to shift their main military efforts to the Southeastern Front.\n1727–1730\nAlthough the Kazakhs won their first major victory over the troops of the Dzungar Khanate, the task of liberating the Kazakh lands in the south and east of the country remained on the agenda. On November 6, 1728, the khan of the Middle Zhuz, Semeke, sent an embassy to the Volga Kalmyks for peace talks in order to secure his western rear and enable the Kazakhs to concentrate all their forces against the troops of the Dzungar Khanate .\nAt the kurultai, which, according to Alexander Shaidatovich, took place after 1728, Khan Abulhair of the Junior Juz was elected commander-in-chief of the united Kazakh militia. The last major battle between the Kazakh militia and the troops of the Dzungar Khanate took place 120 kilometers from Lake Balkhash in the Angraka area.}} According to estimates by Moiseev, the Battle of Anrakai took place in 1729,  Kadybaev estimates 1729 or spring 1730.\nAccording to Tynyshpaev, during this offensive, Kazakh horsemen repeatedly struck enemy forces. Large combat units were commanded by sultans Abilmambet, Barak, Abylai, Bulkhaiir, and other Chingizids. Along with them, representatives of the \"Kara Suyek\" such as the batyrs Bogenbay and Eset from the generation of Zhetiru of the Younger Zhuz, Bogenbay from the Kanzhigaly clan and his namesake from the Shakshak clan of the Argyn tribe of the Middle Zhuz, as well as the batyrs Kabanbay, Zhanibek, Otegen, Tailak, Sauryk, Malaysary, and many others.\nContinued Conflict and Diplomacy (1729–1733)\nThe Kazakh victory in 1730 did not bring a definitive end to hostilities, but rather initiated a period of continued raids, diplomatic maneuvering, and shifting alliances that lasted into the mid-1730s.\nIn 1729, the Dzungar leader Galdan Tseren, seeking to regain the initiative, probed the possibility of a joint military campaign with the Russian Empire against the Kazakhs. He asked the Russian envoy M. Etigerov, \"Are they not attacking the Cossacks [Kazakhs] on your side?\" However, the Siberian administration categorically rejected this proposed alliance.\nThe conflict continued through raids and counter-raids. In the winter of 1731, Kazakh troops attacked a Dzungar trade caravan, capturing a Russian convoy in the process. The Kazakh batyrs subsequently released the Russians but took the Uyghur merchants prisoner, demonstrating the complex interplay of relations in the region.\nThe Kazakhs dealt significant blows to the Dzungars throughout this period. In the summer of 1730, they captured about a thousand Derbet yurts with their livestock. In the fall of 1731, a deep Kazakh raid into Dzungaria resulted in the capture of \"many people, women and children, yurts with a thousand or more head of cattle and belongings.\"\nIn response to planned Kazakh offensives, a 7,000-strong Dzungar army attacked the Kazakh uluses of the Middle Jüz in the summer of 1732 but was successfully repelled.\nRussian Diplomacy and Division\nThe Russian presence became an increasingly important factor in the post-war politics. When the Russian ambassador A. I. Tevkelev arrived in the Kazakh steppe in 1732, tensions among Kazakh feudal lords over the issue of allegiance to Russia provided Galdan Tseren with another opportunity to propose a military alliance to the Russians against the Kazakhs.\nIn May 1733, the Oirat prince Tsagan arrived in Semipalatinsk with a formal request for Russian troops to jointly \"destroy the Cossack horde.\" The Russian commanders refused, stating they could not provide military assistance without higher orders, especially in the absence of open conflict with the Kazakhs.\nThe Dzungar campaign against the Middle Jüz in 1732 ended in failure, with the Dzungar troops returning \"with great losses, so that almost all of them remained there.\" The invasion was significant enough to prevent the traditional meeting of the Middle Jüz nobility from taking place that year.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
