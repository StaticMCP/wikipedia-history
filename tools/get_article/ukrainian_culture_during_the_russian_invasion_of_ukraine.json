It is the largest military attack in Europe since World War II. During the fighting, many pieces of Ukrainian cultural heritage were either destroyed, damaged, or put at risk due to the widespread destruction across the country. This deliberate destruction and looting of over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites is considered as a war crime and has been described by Ukraine's Minister of Culture as cultural genocide.\nLegal protections\nCultural property enjoys special protection under international humanitarian law. The first protocol of the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (both binding on the Ukraine and Russia settlements) prohibit states parties from using historic monuments to support their military effort or making them the objects of acts of hostility or reprisals. The Second Protocol to the Hague Convention allows attacks on cultural property only in case of \"imperative military necessity\" when there is no feasible alternative. Attacks against cultural heritage amount to war crimes and can be prosecuted before the International Criminal Court.\nNotable sites\nin Chernihiv saw damage during Russia's siege of the city.]]Prior to the invasion, Ukraine had seven United Nation Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites, including the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, and the Historic Center of Lviv. Additional sites in Kharkiv (Derzhprom), Mykolaiv (Observatory) and Chernihiv (Transfiguration and Boris and Gleb cathedrals) are on the tentative list.\nIn late April 2022, Politico reported that Ukraine had registered the shipwreck of the Russian cruiser Moskva as an \"underwater cultural heritage\" site.\nConservation efforts\nDomestic\nThe director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in Kyiv, Fedir Androshchuk, worked with two colleagues to conserve and safe guard the museum from attack and potential looting. Androschuck also reported that four other museums in Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Chernihiv had managed to remove, store and protect their main exhibitions with the museum in Vinnytsia used as a displaced persons housing. An artist collective; Asortymentna kimnata (Assorted Room, based at the Ivano-Frankivsk Contemporary Art Center, created several bunkers and worked with galleries in Kyiv, Mariupol, Odesa, Zaporizhzhya and elsewhere to evacuate and preserve pieces from the galleries.\nin Kyiv protected by bags with sand]]\nMany monuments and memorials were protected with bags of sand or wrapped in various materials. In Kyiv, approximately 28 objects were protected in this way as of mid-April. Residents in Lviv attempted to help preserve several stone statues and fountains that could not be dismantled, by wrapping them in plastic, foam and other materials. Additional efforts were photographed and posted by the Lviv Foundation for the Preservation of Architectural and Historical Monuments of wooden frames and boards being used to protect monuments and church stained glass windows.\nOn 28 March an NFT museum launched by the Ministry of Digital Transformation to help preserve the statehood and history of Ukraine, with all proceeds to go to the ministry. The site, Ukrainian MetaHistory NFT-Museum, would include a \"warline\" or timeline of events with a corresponding NFT, which would include a tweet regarding a significant moment in the war and an illustration by a Ukrainian artist. By 1 April, about $600,000 had been raised through the sale of the NFTs, with the funds slated to help rebuild museums, theaters and others cultural institutions that had been destroyed or damaged.\nMany of cultural heritage objects being protected in Ukraine from Russian invasion are objects of Russian culture.\nInternational\nShortly after the invasion, UNESCO announced that they were working to mark any possible key historic monuments and sites across the country with the emblem of the 1954 Hague Convention, the internationally recognized symbol for the protection of cultural heritage in an armed conflict. The organization would also work with the country's museum directors to coordinate conservation efforts to protect collections and monitor any damage to cultural sites through satellite imaging. Shortly after the invasion, officials with the International Council of Museums began to document artifacts and pieces that law enforcement might come across if they were moved illegally across national borders.\nCultural institutions in Poland offered aid, through the Committee for Aid to Museums of Ukraine created shortly after the invasion. The Committee offered support to all museums and cultural institutions in Ukraine to support and secure their collections as well as documentation, digitalization and inventory of collections. The aid from other institutions continued throughout the war. In May 2022 the Czech Ministry of Culture commissioned the National Museum of Prague to send packing materials such as bubble wrap and polyethylene foam along with safety equipment such as fire extinguishers and oriented strand boards to block windows.  International organizations such as the [http://uaac.info Ukraine Art Aid Center] (based in Germany, supported by the German government, among others) and [https://www.aliph-foundation.org ALIPH] (based in Switzerland) have also been active in providing emergency aid since spring 2022.\nIn March 2022, an effort to back up and preserve potentially endangered data and technology of Ukraine's cultural institutions began as Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO).\nExhibitions\nThe Ukrainian Cultural Center in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, California hosted an arts fundraiser which highlighted works by Ukrainian artists in LA in an art exhibit and silent auction as well as a concert, which included the work of late Myroslav Skoryk. Organizers stated that all proceeds will be donated towards humanitarian aid in Ukraine, and hope that the cultural heritage and language would be passed on to another generation. Others, both refugees and transplants, have embraced traditions and traditional clothing during holidays, outside of Ukraine to show support and resilience against the invasion.\nDuring a Milan furniture fair in June 2022, Ukrainian designers Victoria Yakusha and Kateryna Sokolova, highlighted the cultural heritage and symbolisms of Ukraine with their pieces. Sokolova stated her pieces were created in an effort to avoid \"Ukrainian design being wiped off the world map\" while Yakusha claims her mission is to \"show the world the creativity and beauty of Ukrainian culture and thus assert the identity.\"\nThe Backup Ukraine project in partnership with Virtue Media Group VICE, Blue Shield Danmark and the Danish National Commission for UNESCO was announced in May 2022. It is proposed to use the application to scan objects in Ukraine, which will then be converted into a 3D model and uploaded to a cloud database for backup.\nDamage\nOn 16 October 2024, UNESCO UNESCO has verified damage of 457 objects: 143 religious sites, 231 buildings of historical and/or artistic interest, 32 museums, 33 monuments, 17 libraries, 1 archive.

The group moved to expand the use of the Internet Archives Wayback Machine which only documents the homepage, and utilized grants from the Association for Computers and the Humanities and European Association for Digital Humanities as well as Amazon and DigitalOcean. In the first two weeks of the initiative, more than 1,500 websites, digital exhibits, open access publications and other online resources from Ukrainian cultural organizations had digital archives made, which accounted for about three terabytes of data.\nThe project Backup Ukraine was announced in May 2022 and is working in partnership with VICE Media Group's [http://www.virtueworldwide.com Virtue], the Blue Shield Denmark and the Danish UNESCO National Commission. The project asks volunteers to use an app to scan objects in Ukraine, which are then turned into a 3D model and uploaded into a cloud database to be backed up. Scans already uploaded to the project include everyday items such as bedrooms and pets along with works of art. Google created the Ukraine is Here experience which allows for the viewer to experience over 40 cultural landmarks in 3D along with 360-degree views of national parks. Art pieces can also be seen through augmented reality through the Google Arts and Culture app.\nEffect of damage to sites\nThe chief researcher at Ukraine's Institute of Archaeology; Oleksander Symonenko, told reporters that any looting and destruction of artifacts and cultural institution were irreplaceable and that if the Ukrainian culture disappears then it is an irreparable disaster.

The director of UNESCO World Heritage Center likewise stated that not only was Ukraine losing part of its cultural heritage but its identity and part of its history would disappear if the war did not end. Additional concerns were raised by a US Special Rapporteur on Cultural Rights, who warned that the questioning and denial of Ukrainian identity and history, comments made by Russian authority figures and the destruction of the Ukrainian cultural heritage, would have lasting effects.\nThe chair of Blue Shield Denmark noted that destroying a country's cultural heritage was the fastest way to undermine its national identity and that what has been learned after WWII and other conflicts is that saving a country's cultural heritage is the best path to rebuilding that society after conflicts.\nResponse\nUkrainian scholars have raised concerns about an \"unfolding cultural catastrophe\", which has been echoed by the President and CEO of the J Paul Getty Trust, James Cuno.

At the same time, the Ministry urged not to disseminate information about ways to protect cultural property or the location or movement of museum collections during the war. On 5 April, the Ukrainian Cultural Foundation launched an interactive map called the \"Map of Cultural Losses\", showcasing destroyed or damaged heritage sites across the nation since the invasion.\nAfter reports of looting of Scythian artifacts by Russian troops, the Greek Culture Minister Lina Mendoni called the looting heinous and barbaric, and highlighted the past actions of Russia looting after World War II, when Priam's Treasure from the Schliemann excavation was taken to Russia. Mendoni, reiterated her call for the creation of a Red List to prevent the illegal trade of looted artifacts and the creation of a platform to collect information of the looted cultural goods.\nSee also\n* Looting by Russian forces during the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Art theft and looting by Russia during the invasion of Ukraine\nReferences\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://mkip.notion.site/mkip/7be52d2803994651a23a220a8ed85f1c List of damaged objects] by Ukrainian Ministry of Culture"
