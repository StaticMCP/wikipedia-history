It manages six historic sites, including Lewes Castle and Fishbourne Roman Palace.\nHistory\nThe discovery in 1845 of remains of Lewes Priory during the construction of the Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway sparked interest in the county's history and in the formation of an archaeological society. On 18 June 1846 a meeting was convened by Mark Antony Lower, William Henry Blaauw and William Figg at County Hall in Lewes at which the Sussex Archaeological Society was formally established.\nIn 1864 the Society appointed its first curator and librarian, and in 1866 the first museum catalogue was compiled. Having rented space in Castle Lodge, the Society later acquired Barbican House, which continues to house its museum and library.\nActivities\nThe Sussex Archaeological Society organises excavations, talks and conferences on the archaeology and history of Sussex and offers research facilities at its library. Its chief executive is currently Andrew Edwards.\nAs well as supervising excavations in Sussex, it also publishes the Sussex Archaeological Collections and an annual report, and administers the Long Man of Wilmington. It manages six historic properties and museums, which are open to the public:\n* Fishbourne Roman Palace\n* Lewes Castle and Barbican House Museum\n* Anne of Cleves House, Lewes\n* Michelham Priory\n* Marlipins Museum, Shoreham-By-Sea\n* The Priest House, West Hoathly\nIn 2006 the Society began an archeological investigation in the Tide Mills area, which, according to the Newhaven Local & Maritime Museum, would include not only the tide mill but also a record of the entire East Beach site, comprising the mills, railway station, nurses home, Chailey Heritage Marine Hospital, Newhaven Seaplane Base, holiday homes and the Newhaven Marconi Radio Station.\nIn 2020 the society received a £250,000 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to cover costs during the Covid-19 pandemic. It also received £323,800 from the British government's Culture Recovery Fund in 2021.\nNotable members\n* John George Dodson, politician\n* Peter Ladson Drewett, archaeologist and author\n* Walter Hindes Godfrey, architect and historian\n* Henry Andrade Harben, barrister and politician\n* James Henry Hurdis, artist\n* Philip Mainwaring Johnston, architect and historian\n* Mark Antony Lower, historian and teacher\n* John Manley, archaeologist and author\n* Katherine Maud Elizabeth Murray, biographer and educationalist\n* Rev.
