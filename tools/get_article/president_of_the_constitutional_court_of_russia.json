However, in 2009, such elections were canceled and the President became appoint by the Federation Council. Also, until 2020, only a judge of the Constitutional Court could be appointed President of the Court. In 2020, this requirement was lifted.\nCurrently, the President of the Constitutional Court is nominated by the President of Russia and appointed by the Federation Council for a six years term, renewable.\nAfter the expiration of his term of office, the President of the Constitutional Court may be re–appointed to his office. The maximum number of terms during which the President can hold office is not set.\nThe President of the Constitutional Court is not subject to the restriction that a person who has reached the age of 70 cannot be a judge.\nPowers\n's fifth inauguration]]\nIn accordance with the article 24 of the Federal Constitutional Law \"On the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation\", the President of the Constitutional Court has the following powers:\n* overseeing preparation of the sessions of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, convening them and presiding over them;\n* submitting for the consideration of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation the questions to be considered at its sessions;\n* represent the Constitutional Court of Russian Federation in relations with state bodies and organizations, social associations, and, under the authority of the Constitutional Court of Russian Federation, issuing statements on its behalf;\n* performing general management of the staff of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, submitting for the confirmation by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation candidates for head of the Apparatus and head of the Secretariat of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation as well as the Regulations of the Secretariat of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the structure of the staff;\n* exercising other powers in accordance with the present Federal Constitutional Law and the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation.\nThe President of the Constitutional Court also administers the oath of office of the President of Russia, but this is more of a custom than a responsibility.
