It is located at the former Woodford Aerodrome, and it replaced the former Avro Heritage Centre.\nHistory\nAvro Heritage Centre\nOriginally opened in Woodford's personnel block, the centre had five rooms with displays and photos about Avro, an archive, and a small shop. It was only open for tours on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and visits were only possible by prior appointment.\nAvro Heritage Museum\nAs part of the deal to sell Woodford Aerodrome for redevelopment in December 2011, BAE agreed to fund the renovation of the former aerodrome fire station to become the new Avro Heritage Museum. Designed to replace the previous heritage centre, the work was carried out by Conlon Construction and Cassidy + Ashton. Plans were submitted in February 2014; planning permission was approved on 20 May; construction started in August; and the museum opened on 13 November 2015. At , the new building is 70% larger than the previous centre and includes an exhibition hall, a gallery, a café, reading rooms, and classrooms.\nIt holds the Avro Heritage Trust's collection of over 30,000 artefacts on aircraft development, including a set of murals that used to be located in Woodford's employee restaurant.\nAircraft on display\n* Avro Vulcan B.2 XM603\n* Avro Type F – Replica\n* Roe I Triplane – Replica\nCockpits\n* Avro Anson XIX G-AGPG\n* Avro Lancaster B.I R5868 \"S for Sugar\" – replica\n* Avro Vulcan B2 XM602\n* English Electric Canberra WK118\n* Hawker Siddeley 748 1756\n* Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.2 XV235\n* Vickers VC10 C1K XV106 – on loan\nSee also\n*List of aerospace museums\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/avro-heritage-museum Avro Heritage Museum Podcast]"
