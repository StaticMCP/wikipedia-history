It was produced and directed by Dan Curtis, while Wouk adapted his own novel to screen. Like the novel, the series follows the lives of the fictional Henry and Jastrow families as they intersect with the major global events of the early years of World War II. The series also includes segments of documentary footage, narrated by William Woodson, to explain major events and important characters. It stars an ensemble cast, featuring Robert Mitchum, Ali MacGraw, Jan-Michael Vincent, John Houseman, Polly Bergen, Chaim Topol, Peter Graves, Jeremy Kemp, Victoria Tennant, and Ralph Bellamy.\nThe series was aired in seven installments between February 6 and February 13, 1983 on ABC. With 140 million viewers of part or all of Winds of War, it was the most-watched miniseries at that time. It won three Primetime Emmy Awards (out of thirteen nominations) and was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, including Best Miniseries or Television Film. The success of The Winds of War spawned a 1988 sequel miniseries, War and Remembrance, also based on a novel written by Wouk and also directed and produced by Curtis.\nPlot\nThe series follows the plot of Wouk's novel closely, depicting events from March 1939 until the entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941. It tells the story of Victor \"Pug\" Henry (played by Robert Mitchum), an American Naval attaché in Berlin and a confidant to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his family, and their relationships with a mixture of real people and fictional characters. A significant subplot of the series follows the activities of Adolf Hitler and the German General Staff, with the fictitious general Armin von Roon as a perspective character.\nCast\nStarring\n* Robert Mitchum as Victor \"Pug\" Henry\n* Ali MacGraw as Natalie Jastrow\n* Jan-Michael Vincent as Byron \"Briny\" Henry\n* John Houseman as Aaron Jastrow\n* Polly Bergen as Rhoda Henry\n* Lisa Eilbacher as Madeline Henry\n* David Dukes as Leslie Slote\n* Topol as Berel Jastrow\n* Ben Murphy as Warren Henry\n* Peter Graves as Palmer \"Fred\" Kirby\n* Jeremy Kemp as Brig.

He was convinced by Paramount Pictures and the ABC television network that a miniseries would allow the full breadth of his epic story to be brought to life onscreen. Wouk required unusual control over the production in his contract, including considerable influence on the production and veto power over what products could be advertised during the miniseries and how many commercials would be allowed. Wouk also has a cameo as the Archbishop of Siena.\nI, Claudius screenwriter Jack Pulman was originally hired to adapt the novel. He and Wouk worked for months preparing an outline. After Pulman died suddenly in 1979, Wouk himself wrote the teleplay for the series.\nCasting\nThe casting of Lee Strasberg as Aaron Jastrow was publicly announced in February 1981. Strasberg had to withdraw from the production before filming any scenes, due to ill health (he died in 1982). He was replaced by John Houseman. Houseman later had to withdraw from the sequel miniseries, War and Remembrance, due to his own ill health (he died in 1988). He was replaced by John Gielgud.\nFilming\nParamount produced the miniseries for $40 million ($}} in  dollars). ABC paid $32 million for the broadcast rights, then charged advertisers $175,000 for 30-second commercials and $350,000 for one-minute commercials. ABC expected simply to break even on the original broadcast and make any profits from later reruns and syndication.\nPrincipal photography began on December 1, 1980 aboard the  in Long Beach, California and was completed (except for miniature photography) on December 8, 1981, on US Navy vessels at Port Hueneme, California, with filming of the recreation of the Attack on Pearl Harbor.\nThe series was shot at 404 locations in Europe, California and Washington state over 14 months. The 962-page script contained 1,785 scenes and 285 speaking parts. The production involved 4,000 camera setups and shot a million feet of exposed film. The production had a 206-day shooting schedule and came in four days ahead of schedule.\nPrincipal locations were Zagreb, Opatija and Rijeka in Yugoslavia; Berchtesgaden and Munich in West Germany; Siena, Florence, Milan and Rome, Italy; London, UK; Vienna, Austria; Naval Station Bremerton in Bremerton, Washington and throughout the Los Angeles area and Southern California. Scenes were filmed onboard the  (LHA-5) and the , the latter still in mothballs.\nThe opening scene sub-titled \"Berlin\" was actually filmed in and around the Hofburg in Vienna. The OpsRoom at RAF Uxbridge, from which the Battle of Britain fighter defenses were commanded, was only rarely made available to the public (though now the \"Battle of Britain Bunker Exhibition and Visitor Centre\" there in Uxbridge, west London, is fully open to the public). In the beginning of part 6, the train scenes were filmed at the Orange Empire Railway Museum with Ventura County 2-6-2 number 2.\nNazi concentration camp-survivor Branko Lustig was an associate producer in the miniseries and also on ''Schindler's List.\nMusic\nThe music was composed by Bob Cobert, a composer often associated with Curtis.\nUse of stock footage\nThe production made use of battle scenes from other films during the attack scene on Pearl Harbor and during the German attacks on the Soviet Union, including scenes for both battles from Tora! Tora! Tora!\nEpisodes\nThe miniseries was shown by ABC in seven parts over seven evenings, between February 6 and February 13, 1983. It had a runtime of 18 hours including commercials, or 14 hours 40 minutes excluding commercials. Parts One, Two, Six and Seven ran for three hours including commercials, while parts Three, Four and Five ran for two hours including commercials. It attracted an average of 80 million viewers per night.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #544d2c; color: #ffffff;\"| Part\n! style=\"background: #544d2c; color: #ffffff;\"| Title\n! style=\"background: #544d2c; color: #ffffff;\"| Original air date\n|-\n|ShortSummary =\n|LineColor = 544d2c\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n|LineColor = 544d2c\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n|LineColor = 544d2c\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n|LineColor = 544d2c\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n|LineColor = 544d2c\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n|LineColor = 544d2c\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n|LineColor = 544d2c\n}}\n|}\nRelease\nA premiere screening of the first episode was held in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center on Thursday, February 3, 1983, three nights before airing on ABC. The screening was attended by members of the cast including Robert Mitchum, Ali MacGraw, John Houseman, Polly Bergen and Peter Graves. Producer/director Dan Curtis and writer and Washington resident Herman Wouk also attended, though Wouk refused all requests for interviews, saying \"I'm a very private person.\" Also attending were Paramount owner Charles Bluhdorn, who hosted the event, as well as ABC Motion Pictures President Brandon Stoddard, Jack Valenti, Ted Kennedy, Robert McNamara, Art Buchwald, two senators, and numerous other Washington luminaries.\nAfter running a massive year-long advertising campaign, which cost an additional $23 million, ABC reported that the miniseries had 140 million viewers for all or part of its eighteen hours, making it the most-watched miniseries up to that time, beating previous champ, Roots.\nReception\nCritical response\nNew York Times TV critic John O'Connor said that the \"hoopla on 'The Winds of War' has been nearly as massive as the project itself. The result, while not as artistically impressive as Brideshead Revisited, is less manipulative than Holocaust and at least as emotionally compelling as 'Roots.'\" Mitchum, he said, \"manages to carry the art of acting to the extremes of minimalism. He moves like an imposing battleship.\" Most of the actors, he said, are \"at least 10 years older than the characters they are playing.\" Overall, O'Connor said, \"the story does hold. It rumbles along, creating its own momentum, until it eventually becomes the television equivalent of a good read that can't be put down.\"\nColumnist Tom Shales of The Washington Post called the miniseries \"bulbous and bloated\" and said \"a first-year film-school student could edit three or four hours out of the thing without hurting the flow at all.\" Watching Winds of War, he said, \"ecstatic superlatives like 'competent' and 'acceptable' come to mind.\" He ridiculed the performances, and described the actors as too old for their roles. Winds of War was generally historically accurate, getting numerous details correct such as places, dates, and small dialog such as Hitler saying to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, \"Now what?\" when the two heard of the British and French declaration of war on September 3, 1939 -- an important detail many documentaries get wrong (depicting Hitler's surprise that the Western powers would take action over Poland).\nThe show was a success throughout the United States and received many accolades, including Golden Globe nominations and various Emmy wins and nominations.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
