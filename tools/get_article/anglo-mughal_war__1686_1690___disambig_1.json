In 1682, William Hedges was sent on behalf of the Company to negotiate with the governor of the proto-industrialised Bengal Subah, Shaista Khan, and to obtain a firman, an imperial decree that would allow the English company regular trading privileges across the Mughal provinces.\nIn 1685, after some breaking of negotiations by Josiah Child, the Governor of Bengal reacted by increasing the tributaries of the trade with the north-east from 2% to 3.5%. The company refused the newly introduced taxes and began to try to get the province of Bengal to accept new terms in favour of the trading power and expressed to capture Chittagong. They also planned to establish fortified enclaves throughout the region, and attain independence of the surrounding subah from the Mughal territory by bringing the local governors and the Hooghly River under their control, which would later allow formation of relationships with the Kingdom of Mrauk U based in Arakan (today's Myanmar) and hold substantial power in the Bay of Bengal.\nUpon the Company's request, King James II sent warships to help out the company rule in India, but the expedition failed. Following the dispatch of twelve warships loaded with troops, a number of battles took place, leading to the siege of Bombay Harbour and bombardment of the city of Balasore. New peace treaties were negotiated, and the East India Company sent petitions to the emperor, Aurangzeb, about trade involving the Portuguese at Hooghly and religious intolerance of the Tamil community in Madras, but praised Aurangzeb's imperial majesty and compared him with ancient Persia's emperors Cyrus and Darius. However, the company eventually failed to reach an agreement.\nThe English naval forces established a blockade of the Mughal ports on the western Indian coast, engaged in several battles with the Mughal Army, and captured ships with Muslim pilgrims journeying to Mecca.\nThe East India Company navy blockaded several Mughal ports on the western coast of India and engaged the Mughal Army in battle. The blockade started to effect major cities like Chittagong, Madras and Mumbai (Bombay), which resulted in the intervention of Emperor Aurangzeb, who seized all the factories of the company and arrested members of the East India Company Army, while the Company forces commanded by Josiah Child captured further Mughal trading ships.\nUltimately the Company was forced to concede by the armed forces of the Mughal Empire and the company was fined 150,000 rupees (roughly equivalent to today's $4.4 million). The company's apology was accepted and the trading privileges were restored by Aurangzeb.\nBackground\nIn 1682 the English East India Company sent William Hedges to Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal Subah, in order to obtain a firman, an imperial directive that would grant the Company regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal Empire. The intervention of the company's governor in London, Josiah Child, with Hedges's mission caused Emperor Aurangzeb to break off the negotiations. After that Child decided to go to war against the Mughals.\nEvents\nIn 1685, Admiral Nicholson was sent out with twelve warships, carrying 200 pieces of cannon and 600 men, to be reinforced by 400 men from Madras. His instructions were to capture and fortify Chittagong, with 200 additional guns placed on board, to demand the cession of the encompassing territory, to conciliate the Zamindars and Taluqdars, to establish a mint, and to enter into a treaty with the ruler of Arakan. But the fleet was dispersed during the voyage, and several of the vessels entered the Hooghly instead of steering to Chittagong, joining English troops from Madras, and anchoring off the Company's factory.\nThe arrival of the formidable expedition alarmed Shaista Khan, and he offered to compromise his differences with the English; but an unforeseen event brought the negotiation to an abrupt close. Three English soldiers, strolling through the marketplace of Hooghly, quarrelled with Mughal officials, and were severely beaten. After that, Nicholson dispatched a force to capture the town.\nIn 1686, new negotiations started in Chuttanutty which the Mughals intentionally prolonged till their troops could be assembled to attack the English encampment, and English commander Job Charnock retired with his soldiers and establishments to the island of Ingelee, at the mouth of the Hooghly River. It was a low and deadly swamp, covered with long grass, without any fresh water. In three months, half of the English troops had died from disease.\nIn 1688, an English fleet was dispatched to blockade the Mughal harbours in the Arabian Sea on the western coast of India. Merchantmen containing Muslim pilgrims to Mecca (as part of the hajj) were among those captured. Upon hearing of the blockade, Emperor Aurangzeb resumed negotiations with the English. However, the Company sent out reinforcements commanded by Captain Heath who on his arrival disallowed the treaty then pending and proceeded to Balasore which he bombarded unsuccessfully. He then sailed to Chittagong; but finding the fortifications stronger than he had anticipated, landed at Madras.\nAfter that, Emperor Aurangzeb issued orders for the occupation of the East India Company's possessions across the subcontinent, and the confiscation of their property. As a result, possessions of East India Company were reduced to the fortified towns of Madras and Bombay.\nIn 1689, the strong Mughal fleet from Janjira commanded by Sidi Yaqub and composed of Mappila from the Ethiopian Empire blockaded the East India Company fort in Bombay. After a year of resistance, a famine broke out due to the blockade, the Company surrendered, and in 1690 the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb's court to plea for a pardon and to renew the trade firman. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large imperial fine of 1,500,000 rupees, and promise better behavior in the future. Emperor Aurangzeb then ordered Sidi Yaqub to lift the siege of Bombay and the company subsequently re-established itself in Bombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.\nSee also\n* Henry Every\n* Thomas Tew\n* Polacca\nReferences"
