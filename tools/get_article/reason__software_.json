The first version was released in 2000.\nBackground\nPropellerhead Software was founded in 1994 by Ernst Nathorst-Böös, Pelle Jubel and Marcus Zetterquist and launched with ReCycle. They became popular in 1996 after releasing the ReBirth RB-338, described by MusicRadar in February 2011 as \"one of the most important virtual instruments in the history of electronic music\". By the late 1990s, advancements in technology meant that it became feasible for home users to build their own virtual studios from software, and so in 1999, Propellerhead ended development on ReBirth to work on Reason.\nRelease history\nReason was first released in November 2000. MusicRadar described it in 2011 as \"broadly similar to the likes of Logic and Cubase, but\" with its \"user interface mimick[ing] a rack full of equipment, allowing instruments, effects and mixers to be linked together in order to create a complete production setup\". Subsequent versions came out in September 2002, 2005, September 2007, August 2010, September 2011, April 2013, September 2014, June 2016, October 2017, September 2019, September 2021, and June 2024. Early versions of the program lacked the ability to record audio, and in September 2009, Propellerhead released Record to work alongside Reason; Record was later merged into Reason 6. The success of the program prompted Propellerhead to rebrand itself as Reason Studios in August 2019.\nReviewing Reason 12, MusicRadar questioned how useful Reason 11 users would find it, but noted that it looked \"the best it has in years\", while Musictech.com described it as a \"brilliant buy\" for producers looking for a new digital audio workstation. Pcmag.com noted that \"existing fans [...] should take a close look\", though criticised its user interface, saying that it had \"aged considerably\" compared to its competition.\nNotable users\nThe following producers and musical acts have at some point used Reason:\n*Beastie Boys\n*MGMT\n*Toro Y Moi\n*The Prodigy\n*Michael Oakley\n*LCD Soundsystem\n*Flying Lotus\n*Tyler, the Creator\n*J.
