Kerrang! gave it 4/5, stating \"listeners will have decided whether the blend of metal heft and post-hardcore crunch with hip-swivelling R&B, ambient electro and earworm alt.pop is for them. Seeing all six tracks ... underlines the soulful power at play, and offers a fabulous chance to digest it all and join the dots of a bigger picture still emerging\".\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written and produced by The President, except where noted.\nNotes\n* \"Rage\" is stylised in all caps.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for King of Terrors\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
