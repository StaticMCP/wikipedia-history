The dynasty's first and only ruler was Mar-biti-apla-usur.\nHistory\n, especially in the Kassite period. The Babylonian princess married by Untash-Napirisha (himself the son of a Kassite princess) could be identified with Napir-Asu, whose bronze statue is now at the Louvre.]]\nBabylon's seventh dynasty, also known as the Elamite dynasty, was founded around 980 BC. It was the third of a series of very short lived Babylonian dynasties, namely the Second Sealand Dynasty, the Bazi Dynasty and the Elamite Dynasty. Its first and sole ruler was the Elamite Mar-biti-apla-usur. His regnal name was Akkadian, which was the language spoken in Babylon at the time. However, since no known rulers of Elam are known to have carried Akkadian titles (though Mār-bīti-apla-uṣur was his Babylonian name, and his reign coincides with a blank period in Elamite political history), Brinkman has argued that he might not have been himself from Elam, nor the patrilineal descendant of an Elamite, but rather a Babylonian with some Elamite ancestor (possibly a king).\nFall of the Dynasty\nThe dynasty's reign might have suffered Aramean incursions, because of which the Akitu festival might have been suspended. After his death, the dynasty's sole ruler Mar-biti-apla-usur was buried in the palace of Sargon as a “legitimate king.” This designation depends on the interpretation of ina É-GAL LUGAL(-)GI.NA qé.bir, suggesting an interment suitable for a rightful king.\nList of kings of the Elamite Dynasty\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" |Name\n|style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" |Reign\n|style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" |Succession and notes\n|style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" |Ref\n|-\n|Mar-biti-apla-usur\n| 980 – 975 BC(6 years)\n|First and last member of the dynasty\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
