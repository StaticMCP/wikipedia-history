He played 21 Test matches and 31 One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 1976 and 1983 as a wicket-keeper batsman. He was coach of the New Zealand national cricket team between 1990 and 1993.\nLees was born at Dunedin in 1952 and educated at King's High School in the city.\nDomestic career\nLees made his first-class debut in February 1971, playing for a New Zealand under-23 side against Auckland. He made his Otago debut in December 1971 and played for the province's representative side until the end of the 1987–88 season. He played 146 first-class matches and scored 4,932 runs as well as 81 List A matches, scoring 1,071 runs. In his final season as captain of Otago (1987–88), Otago won both the one-day and first-class competitions.\nInternational career\nLees followed Ken Wadsworth into the New Zealand side and soon proved himself a capable wicketkeeper-batsman. In only his third Test, against Pakistan at Karachi in 1976–77, he made 152 at a time New Zealand were in deep trouble and followed with 46 in the second innings to save the match.\nHe was very unfortunate to be left out of the tour of England in 1978, arguably being a better wicketkeeper and batsman than Jock Edwards, his replacement, who was described by one journalist as the worst wicketkeeper he had ever seen. He returned to England the following year as part the New Zealand side which reached the semi-finals of the World Cup, but the emergence of Ian Smith meant that these opportunities thereafter were limited.\nIn 1982–83 he took five catches in an innings and eight in the match against Sri Lanka at Wellington, and played his final Tests on the 1983 tour of England.\nCoaching career\nOtago\nAfter ending his cricketing career he turned to coaching in 1989, he remained there until 1990 before being promoted to national team with which he spent nearly three years.\nNew Zealand\nLees' first tour in charge was very tough. New Zealand lost all three Tests and three ODIs, against Pakistan by big margins. Travelling did not get any easier, and they managed only one win on the road, against Zimbabwe in Harare. But there was one standout moment as coach for Lees – the 1992 World Cup.\nNew Zealand reached the semi-final of the tournament, losing to eventual champions Pakistan. He found good players for New Zealand but was not able to find any of great players. Players like Gavin Larsen, Rod Latham and Willie Watson were his find under Martin Crowe as captain of the team.\nIt was a tour abroad that ended Lees' national coaching role. After the team abandoned their trip to Sri Lanka in November and December 1992, when bomb blasts threatened their safety.\nIn 2014, after spending years with Black Caps, Lees became an interim coach of a New Zealand women's national cricket team called White Ferns. During that year, his team had participated in the 2017 World Cup against Sri Lanka and won seven wickets at the County Cricket Ground, Derby.\nFrom 2012 until 2017 Warren Lees spent five years as the coach of the Otago Sparks cricket team. He considers the two titles that they won as a highlight in his coaching career.\nHonours\nIn the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours, Lees was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket.\nPersonal life\nLees lives in Clyde, Central Otago, with his wife Jude. He spends his days coaching what he calls \"country kids\", who do not have access to the same resources as their counterparts in big cities.\nReferences"
