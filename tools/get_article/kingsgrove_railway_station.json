It is served by Sydney Trains T8 Airport & South Line services.\nHistory\nKingsgrove station opened on 21 September 1931 when the East Hills line opened from Tempe to East Hills. It was the original terminus of the double track electrified section from Tempe. Until 1939, passengers transferred at Kinsgrove to a CPH railmotor or steam service to continue their journey towards East Hills. The line was duplicated and electrified beyond Kingsgrove in 1948.\nIn 2000, as part of the quadruplication of the line from Wolli Creek to Kingsgrove, through lines were added on either side of the existing tracks extending to just east of . A headshunt was provided to the west of the station in association with this project, which was previously used by terminating services. In 2013, the quadruplication was extended to Revesby as part of the Rail Clearways Program.\nThe station was upgraded in 2005.\nAccident\nOn 6 October 2000, an eight car Tangara derailed at low speed near Kingsgrove station causing the rear three carriages to topple onto their side. The derailment was caused by a track buckling as a result of high temperatures. Ten people were hospitalised.\nServices\nPlatforms\n|p2linename = T8\n|p2stop     = services to Revesbyearly morning & late night services to Macarthur\n|p2notes    = }}\nKingsgrove is typically served by 4 trains per hour in each direction, with increased frequencies during peak hours.\nThe station is accessible with one lift from the west side of Kingsgrove Road to the single island platform.\nTransport links\nTransit Systems operates three bus routes via Kingsgrove station, under contract to Transport for NSW:\nKingsgrove Station:\n*490: Drummoyne to Hurstville via Five Dock, Burwood and Campsie\n*492: Drummoyne to Rockdale via Five Dock, Burwood and Campsie\nKingsgrove Shops:\n*493: Roselands Shopping Centre to Rockdale via Beverly Hills, Bexley North and Bexley\nU-Go Mobility operates one bus route via Kingsgrove station, under contract to Transport for NSW:\nKingsgrove Shops:\n*455: to Rockdale Plaza via Kingsway West, Hurstville and Kogarah\nKingsgrove station is served by one NightRide route:\n*N20: Riverwood station to Town Hall station via Narwee, Rockdale and Airport\nTrackplan\n| legend = no\n| map = s\\bs\\s\\+d\\o\\s*↑E to\nbs\\+s!~s*StationConcourse↓\\cd\\b\\\\\\+c\\b*\nd\\b\\s\\s\\bs\\\\d\\fvSTR!~MFADEg\\\n-STRq!~MFADEgq\\-STRfq\\-STRq\\SHI1+rq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq!~hRP4a\\STRq\\SHI1rq\\-STRq\\-STRfq\\-STRq!~MFADEfq\\b\\fvSTR\\\nSTRq!~MFADEgq\\STRfq\\STRq\\SHI1lq\\STRq-PLT!~*Platform__align=b\\STRq-PLT\\STRq-PLT\\STRq-PLT!~*1↑__align=b\\STRq-PLT\\STRq-PLT!~XPLTal\\STRq-PLT!~hRP4\\STRq-PLT\\SHI1+lq\\STRq\\STRfq\\STRq!~MFADEfq\\b\\fvBHF\\\nSTRq!~MFADEgq\\STRgq\\STRq\\SHI1rq\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq!~*Platform__align=t\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq!~*2↓__align=t\\PLT-STRq!~XPLTel\\PLT-STRq!~hRP4\\PLT-STRq\\SHI1+rq\\STRq\\STRgq\\STRq!~MFADEfq\\b\\fvSTR\\\nSTRq-!~MFADEgq\\STRgq-\\STRq-\\SHI1+lq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq\\STRq!~hRP4e\\STRq\\SHI1lq\\STRq-\\STRgq-\\STRq-!~MFADEfq\\b\\fvSTR!~vNULgf.g\\\nd\\\\s\\\\d\\b*↓to buses\\bs\\b\\\\fvSTR!~MFADEf\\\nc\\s\\\\d\\s\\+d!~*KingsgroveRoad\\d\\\\c\\d\\d\\b\\+d\\d*plt__abbr=Platforms\\c\\b*1&nbsp;2\\\\c\nbs\\b\\\\bs\\d\\s*↓W to\n}}\n| legend = no\n| map = s*←W To \\bs\\s\\\\\\\n-STRq!~MFADEgq\\-STRfq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRfq\\-STRq!~MFADEfq\\\nSTRq-!~MFADEgq\\STRfq-!~-STRq!~l-ENDE@Gq\\STRq-!~-STRgq\\STRq-!~-STRfq\\vSTRq\\STRq-!~-SHI2lq!~-SHI2rq\\STRq-\\STRq-!~lvBHF-Rq\\STRq-\\STRq-\\STRq-\\STRq-\\STRfq-\\STRq-!~MFADEfq\\\nvSTRq!~MFADEgq\\vSTRgq\\vSTRq\\vSTRq\\vSTRq\\vSTRq!~SHI2+lq-\\vSTRq\\vSTRq!~lvBHF~Lq\\vSTRq\\vSTRq\\vSTRq\\vSTRq\\vSTRgq\\vSTRq!~MFADEfq\\\n\\d\\\\b\\s*Kingsgrove\\s*E To →\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101412#/ Kingsgrove station details] Transport for New South Wales"
