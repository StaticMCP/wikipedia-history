The traditional list of 12 kings, with reigns dated to 990–785 BC, is derived from the lost history of Menander of Ephesus as quoted by Josephus in Against Apion I. 116–127. Josephus asserts that Menander had drawn his list from the chronicles of Tyre itself. Menander-Josephus also contains a list of 9 kings and judges, with reigns dated to 591–532 BC in Against Apion I. 154–160.\nAncient Tyrian rulers based on Hellenic mythology\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Agenor || c. 2050–1450 BC || Son of Poseidon or of Belus.

Tyre regained independence with Assyria's demise, although Egypt controlled Tyre during some of the time afterwards. Eventually, Tyre fell under the control of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|missing|| –592 BC ||\n|-\n|Ithobaal III(Ethbaal III) || 591–573 BC || This is the king mentioned in Ezekiel 28:2 at the time of the fall of Jerusalem. Carthage became independent of Tyre in 574 BC.\n|}\nShoftim of Tyre\nIn the 560s the monarchy was overthrown, and an oligarchic government established, headed by \"judges\" or shoftim (cf. Carthage). The monarchy was restored with the ascension of Hiram III to the throne. Josephus mentions these judges in his treatise Against Apion (Book I, §21), and which last judge (Hiram III) is said to have been contemporary with Cyrus the Great. According to Josephus, Hiram's reign extended to the fourteenth year of Cyrus', ascension to power in Babylon. Cyrus took control of Babylon on October 29, 539, therefore Hiram III's rule spanned from 551 to 532 BC.\nUnder Persian control 539–411 BC\n*Mattan IV fl. c. 490–480\n*Boulomenus fl. c. 450\n*Abdemon c.420–411 BC.
