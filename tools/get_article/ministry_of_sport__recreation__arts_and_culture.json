The position was created by President Emmerson Mnangagwa following his cabinet formation in December 2017 when he split Higher Education and Primary and Secondary Education into two separate government agencies, the latter being responsible for sports and the arts prior to this move.\nThe minister is The Honourable Lieutenant General (Rtd) Anselem Nhamo Sanyatwe, who was appointed on 25 March 2025, replacing former Olympic swimmer Kirsty Coventry, following her election as President of the International Olympic Committee.\nIn 1980, Robert Mugabe created a Ministry of Youth, Sport and Recreation, which he filled with a woman.\nReferences"
