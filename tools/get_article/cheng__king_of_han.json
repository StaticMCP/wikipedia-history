He lived as a commoner during the Qin dynasty after his native state was conquered by the Qin state in 230 BC.\nIn 209 BC, when uprisings against the Qin dynasty broke out throughout China, Han Cheng joined Xiang Liang's rebel group, hoping to leverage on their military power to revive the Hán state. Along the way, he met Zhang Liang, a descendant of a bureaucratic family of the former Hán state. Zhang Liang succeeded in persuading Xiang Liang to restore the former Hán state, and Han Cheng was appointed as its ruler with Zhang Liang serving as his chancellor. Xiang Liang also provided some troops to Han Cheng and allowed him to attack the Qin garrison at Yingchuan.\nAfter the fall of the Qin dynasty in 206 BC, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin territories into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Han Cheng was appointed as the King of Han. Months later, Xiang Yu killed Han Cheng and replaced him with Zheng Chang.\nReferences\n*"
