It is based on the Kings League, launched by Piqué shortly before. The league rules include a tie-breaker penalty shoot-out, unlimited substitutions, and the implementation of secret weapons.\nHistory\nShortly after the inaugural season of the Kings League began, Oriol Querol, CEO of Kings League and Kosmos Holding director, announced the Queens League, a competition for women. From May 2023, Queens League matches will be played on Saturdays, ahead of Kings League matches on Sundays. Former Spain players like Priscila Borja and Willy offered themselves to join the Queens League. Ibai Llanos of Porcinos, was the first Kings League chairperson to confirm the creation of his women's team, Porcinas. Former player Borja Fernández offered to coach the team.\nThe Queens League had a launch event on 24 February 2023 at the Cupra Arena, with all of the Kings League teams taking part in the new tournament; some have changed branding for the women's team, and some have introduced more female streamers and popular figures as chairpersons.\nWhile the Kings League's first season saw involvement from former professional footballers, the Queens League also includes current professionals, particularly in the organisation of teams: FC Barcelona Femení and Switzerland player Ana-Maria Crnogorčević is part of the staff of Saiyans FC; her club teammates Patricia Guijarro, Clàudia Pina, and Sandra Paños are all ambassadors of teams; as are Spain player Jennifer Hermoso and Chile player Christiane Endler. The number one draft pick was Zaragoza CFF, Egypt, and former Barcelona player Sara Ismael.\nMexican sports newspaper Récord wrote upon the announcement of the Queens League that it would be important in promoting gender equality in the world of video gaming. The Queens League teams are given the same conditions and pay as the Kings League. In May 2023, Pique and Spanish broadcasting company Mediaset announced that one match each day – the 8pm games of both the Queens League and Kings League – would be broadcast on free-to-air television on channel Cuatro, which broadcasts most sports content. Highlights from other games and the related talkshows Chup Chup and After are also shown on Cuatro.\nVenue\nThe Queens League is held at the Cupra Arena in the Port of Barcelona area along with the Kings League.\nOther venues around Spain, both outdoor and indoor, have since hosted Final Fours, with Mexico also once hosting a Queens League final:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Venue List\n|-\n!

The first season is set to begin on 6 May 2023 and host its Final Four event on 29 July.\nPerformance by team\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Team\n!Titles\n!Runners-up\n!Splits won\n!Splits runner-up\n|-\n|\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|1\n|2024 Summer\n|2023 Summer\n|-\n|\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|0\n|2023 Summer\n|\n|-\n|\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|0\n|2023 Cup\n|\n|-\n|\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|0\n|2024 Winter\n|\n|-\n|\n|align=center|0\n|align=center|1\n|\n|2023 Cup\n|-\n|\n|align=center|0\n|align=center|1\n|\n|2024 Winter\n|-\n| Jijantas FC\n|align=center|0\n|align=center|1\n|\n|2024 Summer\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Queens League\n* Media football\n* Women's football in Spain\nReferences"
