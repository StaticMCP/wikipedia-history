It depicts a standing Confederate Army soldier, holding a rifle whose butt rests on the ground.  The statue, built out of Georgia marble by the McNeel Marble Company, stands on a stone base  in height and  at the base.  It was placed in 1910 by the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. On June 20, 2020, the monument was removed from the Jefferson County courthouse as part of a cooperative agreement between County Judge Gerald Robinson and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The statue was then moved to an undisclosed location for storage where it can be cleaned and repaired.\nSee also\n*List of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson County, Arkansas\nReferences"
