It was created on May 4, 1910 by members of Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization's (SMARO) Solun, Strumica and Ser revolutionary regions, excluding the supporters of Yane Sandanski. A statute and a central committee, led by Hristo Chernopeev and Anton Bozukov, were created shortly after. Some of the other more renowned members of the organization were Tane Nikolov, Apostol Petkov, Georgi Zankov and Dimitar Lyapov.
