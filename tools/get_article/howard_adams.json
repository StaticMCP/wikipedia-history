Adams became the first Métis in Canada to gain his PhD after studies at the University of California, Berkeley in 1966.\nHe returned to Canada and became a prominent Métis activist, contributing regularly to newspapers and magazines and appearing on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio shows. In 1969, he was elected president of the Metis Association of Saskatchewan.\nAdams' intellectual influences include Malcolm X whom he saw lecture at Berkeley, and the general radical environment of that institution during the 1960s. He was the maternal great grandson of Louis Riel's lieutenant Maxime Lepine who fought in the North-West Rebellion of 1885.\nDeath\nAdams died in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 8, 2001, on his 80th birthday.\nWorks\n* The Education of Canadians 1800-1867: The Roots of Separatism, Harvest House, 1968\n* Prison of Grass: Canada from a Native Point of View New Press, 1975, ; Fifth House, 1989,\n* Tortured People: The Politics of Colonization Theytus Books Ltd., 1999,\nHonours\n* National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, for education, 1999.\nSee also\n*History of Saskatchewan\n*Politics of Saskatchewan\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.metismuseum.ca/browse/index.php/700 Metis Museum Page on Howard Adams]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070905193811/http://www.sicc.sk.ca/faces/madamho.htm Aboriginal Faces of Saskatchewan: Howard Adams]\n* Archives of Howard Adams [https://central.bac-lac.gc.ca/.redirect?app=fonandcol&id=209461&lang=eng (Howard Adams fonds, R10982)] are held at Library and Archives Canada\nFurther reading\n* Hartmut Lutz, Murray Hamilton and Donna Heimberker. \"Howard Adams: OTAPAWY!
