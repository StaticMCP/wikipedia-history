The locality is within the Murray-Darling drainage basin and is specifically within the catchment of the Balonne-Condamine River. Mount Mocatta lies close near the north-eastern boundary close to the range () and rises  above sea level.\nThe land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with some crop growing in the south.\nHistory\nRangemore State School opened on 17 March 1913. In 1917 it was downgraded to a half-time provisional school in conjunction with King's Tent Provisional School (meaning the two schools shared a single teacher). In 1918 King's Tent Provisional School closed and Rangemore once again became a full-time state school. It was finally closed circa 1962.\nDemographics\nIn the , Rangemore had a population of 3 people.\nIn the , Rangemore had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Rangemore. The nearest government primary schools are Cooyar State School in Cooyar to the east and Quinalow State School in Quinalow to the south. The nearest government secondary schools are Quinalow State School (to Year 10) and Dalby State High School (to Year 12) in Dalby to the south-west. However, Dalby may be too distant from some parts of Rangemore; the alternatives are distance education and boarding school. There are also two non-government primary-and-secondary schools in Dalby.\nReferences"
