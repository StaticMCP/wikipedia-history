The Tuzigoot Site is an elongated complex of stone masonry rooms that were built along the spine of a natural outcrop in the Verde Valley. The central rooms stand higher than the others and they appear to have served public functions. The pueblo has 110 rooms. The National Park Service currently administers , within an authorized boundary of .\n″Tú Digiz/Tuzigoot″ is a Tonto Apache term for \"crooked waters,\" from nearby Pecks Lake, a cutoff meander of the Verde River; from Tú Digiz one principal Tonto Apache clan gets its name. The pueblo was built by the Sinagua people between 1125 and 1400 CE. Tuzigoot is the largest and best preserved of the many Sinagua pueblo ruins in the Verde Valley. The ruins at Tuzigoot incorporate very few doors; instead, the inhabitants used ladders accessed by trapdoor type openings in the roofs to enter each room.\nThe monument is on land once owned by United Verde/Phelps Dodge. The corporation sold the site to Yavapai County for $1 so that the excavation could be completed under the auspices of federal relief projects. The county in turn transferred the land to the federal government.\nTuzigoot was excavated from 1933 to 1935 by Louis Caywood and Edward Spicer of the University of Arizona, with funding from the federal Civil Works Administration and Works Project Administration. In 1935–1936, with additional federal funding, the ruins were prepared for public display, and a Pueblo Revival-style museum and visitor center was constructed.\nFranklin D. Roosevelt designated Tuzigoot Ruins as a U.S. National Monument on July 25, 1939.  The Tuzigoot National Monument Archeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\nThe ruins are surrounded by the tailings pond of the former United Verde copper mine at Jerome. The tailings have recently been stabilized and revegetated.\nClimate\nTuzigoot National Monument has a semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk) with cool winters and very hot summers.\n}}\nGallery\nImage:tuzigoot.jpg|Tuzigoot National Monument\nImage:Tuzigoot, pond 1945.jpg|Tuzigoot, viewed from across the old tailings pond, 1945\nImage:Tuzigoot Museum near (Clarkdale, Arizona).jpg|Tuzigoot Museum\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Yavapai County, Arizona\n* List of historic properties in Clarkdale, Arizona\n* List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
