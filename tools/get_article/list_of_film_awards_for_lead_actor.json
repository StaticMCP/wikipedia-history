The lists is organized by the region and country of the sponsoring organization or festival, but some awards are not restricted to films or actors from that country. Thus the David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actor, awarded by the Italian Academy of Films, is given to non-Italian actors.\nAfrica\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:6em;\"|Country !!
