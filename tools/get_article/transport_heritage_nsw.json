Other transport heritage groups also expressed concern for their future existence. Peter Lowry was appointed as chairperson of the board and the nominated chief executive of Transport Heritage NSW, Andrew Killingsworth has been seen as a political appointment.\nIn February 2016, Andrew Moritz was appointed as the new chief executive following the resignation of Andrew Killingsworth. On 1 March 2017, Rob Mason, former chief executive of RailCorp was appointed as the new chairman of the board, replacing Peter Lowry.\nIn November 2018, plans were announced to move Transport Heritage NSW items currently stored at Eveleigh Railway Workshops and Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot to a secure undercover storage facility in part of the Chullora Railway Workshops to be known as the Chullora Heritage Hub.\nIn August 2022, former New South Wales premier Nathan Rees was appointed as the new chair of the board, replacing Rob Mason.\nAll locomotives and rolling stock formerly owned by the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum are now owned by THNSW.\nMuseums\n* NSW Rail Museum, Thirlmere\n* Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum\nAwards\n* Winner National Trust (NSW) Heritage
