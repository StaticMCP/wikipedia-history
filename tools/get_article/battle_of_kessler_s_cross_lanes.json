Gen. John B. Floyd, commanding Confederate forces in the Kanawha Valley, crossed the Gauley River to attack Col. Erastus Tyler's 7th Ohio Infantry Regiment encamped at Kessler's Cross Lanes. The Union forces were surprised and routed and the regiment was defeated with severe loss. The two wings of Tyler's line retreated in opposite directions. Throughout the rout and carnage Major Jack Casement, at the head of Tyler's left wing, commenced a retrograde march through Confederate territory over mountain ranges to the Elk River and what is now the Town of Clendenin and then on to Charleston, West Virginia without the capture of a man.\nFloyd then withdrew to the river and took up a defensive position at Carnifex Ferry. During the month, Gen. Robert E. Lee arrived in western Virginia and attempted to coordinate the forces of Brig. Gens. Floyd, Henry A. Wise, Col. Douglas Micklich and William W. Loring.\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108185041/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/CWSII/WestVirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Greenbrier%20River%20to%20Kesslers%20Cross%20Lanes.pdf CWSAC Report Update and Resurvey: Individual Battlefield Profiles]\nde:Kampfhandlungen im Kanawha-Tal"
