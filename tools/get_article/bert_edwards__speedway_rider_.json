In 1955, he averaged 9.45 and was club captain. In 1956, he was called up by England for test matches that included fixtures against Sweden and Australia. His final two seasons were with Ipswich in the highest division of British speedway in the National League.\nFamily\nHis father was Richard Edwards was a councillor in Harrow and his uncle was Bob Edwards, a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1955 to 1987.\nReferences"
