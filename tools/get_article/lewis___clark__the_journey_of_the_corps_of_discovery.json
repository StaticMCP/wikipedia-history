It was the United States' first exploration of the West and one of the nation's most enduring adventures.\"\n\"This extraordinary film tells the remarkable story of the entire Corps of Discovery—not just the two famous Captains, but the young army men, French-Canadian boatmen, Clark's African-American slave, and the Shoshone woman named Sacagawea, who brought along her infant son.
