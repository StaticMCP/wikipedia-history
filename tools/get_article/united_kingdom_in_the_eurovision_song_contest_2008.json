According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Four\" (France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top nine songs from each semi-final as determined by televoting progress to the final, and a tenth was determined by back-up juries. As a member of the \"Big Four\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final on 24 May 2008. In addition to their participation in the final, the United Kingdom is also required to broadcast and vote in one of the two semi-finals.

Right before the winner’s reprise, he said “… and possibly goodbye, Europe”. The suggestion that the United Kingdom should follow Italy's suit and no longer enter the competition was also made. In Wogan's radio show on 27 May 2008, he remarked on a conversation with Abraham who had said that he was not expecting many points due to bloc voting and another reason which Wogan was not prepared to discuss on air, presumed to be related to his race. Swedish group BWO, which revealed during an interview that they had previously been approached to compete in a British national final but refused as they were not allowed to write their own song, stated that if the United Kingdom put in more effort they can win the contest.\nFollowing the 2008 contest, Wogan resigned as a commentator, and was replaced by Graham Norton in 2009.\nNotes and references\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0070hvg BBC's official Eurovision website]"
