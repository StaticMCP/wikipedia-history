The true stem of the plant—the rhizome—remains underground and only the leaves, flowers and fruit appear above ground. The leaves are ,  and about 60&nbsp;cm long by 12&nbsp;cm wide. The inflorescence is a compact cluster about 5&nbsp;cm long and 3&nbsp;cm wide produced at ground level. The fruit is a capsule about 4&nbsp;cm long by 3&nbsp;cm wide with nine wings.\nTaxonomy\nThe Cape York ginger was first described by the Scottish botanist and ginger specialist Rosemary Margaret Smith, who published it in the journal Notes from the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh in 1980.\nDistribution and habitat\nAmomum queenslandicum favours disturbed areas of lowland and gallery rainforest in Cape York Peninsula and New Guinea, at altitudes from sea level up to 200&nbsp;m.\nConservation\nPopulations of this species are declining, and it is listed as critically endangered under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act.
