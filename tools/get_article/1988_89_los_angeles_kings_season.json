It saw the Kings finish second in the Smythe Division with a record of 42 wins and 31 losses and 7 losses in overtime for 91 points.\nThe 1988–89 season was the first for the great Wayne Gretzky in a Kings uniform. He had come over in a shocking trade with the Edmonton Oilers in the off-season (see below). Paced by Gretzky, Los Angeles Kings led the league in goal scoring, with a total of 376 goals scored. In the playoffs, the Kings completed the upset by beating the Oilers (defending champions and Gretzky's former team) in seven games in the Smythe Division Semi-finals before being swept in the Smythe Division Finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames in four straight games.\nThis was also the first season that the Kings wore their silver and black uniforms, which they would wear until the 1997–98 season. In the off-season, they had changed their team colours to silver and black from gold and purple, which were more associated with their co-tenants at the Great Western Forum, the National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Lakers. They had also unveiled a new logo that reflected the new team colours.\nAs of 2025, this remains the most recent season where the Kings eliminated the Oilers in the playoffs as the Kings have lost 7 straight playoff series since, and the Kings are 2–9 all time in series wins against the Oilers.\nOffseason\nNHL draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Round\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pick\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"20%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"20%\" | Nationality\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30%\" | College/junior/club team\n|-\n|1||7||Martin Gélinas (LW)||||Hull Olympiques (QMJHL)\n|-\n|2||28||Paul Holden (D)||||London Knights (OHL)\n|-\n|3||49||John Van Kessel (RW)||||North Bay Centennials (OHL)\n|-\n|4||70||Rob Blake (D)||||Bowling Green State University (CCHA)\n|-\n|5||91||Jeff Robison (D)||||Mount St. Charles Academy (USHS-RI)\n|-\n|6||109||Micah Aivazoff (RW)||||Victoria Cougars (WHL)\n|-\n|6||112||Robert Larsson (D)||||Skellefteå AIK (Sweden)\n|-\n|7||133||Jeff Kruesel (RW)||||John Marshall High School (USHS-MN)\n|-\n|8||154||Timo Peltomaa (RW)||||Ilves (Finland)\n|-\n|9||175||Jim Larkin (LW)||||Mount Saint Joseph Academy (USHS-VT)\n|-\n|10||196||Brad Hyatt (D)||||Windsor Spitfires (OHL)\n|-\n|11||217||Doug Laprade (RW)||||Lake Superior State University (NCAA)\n|-\n|12||238||Joe Flanagan (C)||||Canterbury School (USHS-CT)\n|-\n|S||12||Sean Fitzgerald (LW)||||State University of New York at Oswego (SUNYAC)\n|}\nWayne Gretzky trade\nOn August 9, 1988, in a move that drastically changed the dynamics of the NHL, the Oilers traded Gretzky (along with Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski) to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, $15 million in cash and the Kings' first-round draft picks in 1989 (Jason Miller), 1991 (Martin Rucinsky) and 1993 (Nick Stajduhar). \"The Trade\", as it came to be known, upset Canadians to the extent that New Democratic Party House Leader Nelson Riis demanded that the government block it and Peter Pocklington was burned in effigy. Gretzky himself was considered a \"traitor\" by some Canadians for turning his back on his adopted hometown, his home province and his home country; his motivation was widely rumoured to be the furtherance of his wife's acting career. Others believe it was Pocklington who instigated the trade, seeking to benefit personally from the transaction.\nRegular season\nOn October 6, 1988, Wayne Gretzky made his debut as a member of the Los Angeles Kings in a game against the Detroit Red Wings. Gretzky scored on his first shot, and contributed 3 assists in an 8–2 victory. In Gretzky's first season with the Kings, he led the team in scoring with 168 points on 54 goals and 114 assists, and won his ninth Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's Most Valuable Player. He led the Kings to a second-place finish in the Smythe Division with a 42–31–7 record (91 points), and they ranked fourth in the NHL overall.\nGretzky recorded at least one point in all forty regular season home games, as well as the Kings' six home playoff games. No other NHL player has ever accomplished such a feat under a schedule of seventy games or more.\nGretzky's first season in Los Angeles saw a marked increase in attendance and fan interest in a city not previously known for following hockey. The Kings, who then played their home games at the Great Western Forum, named Gretzky their captain (a position he held until his trade to St. Louis in 1996) and boasted numerous sellouts on their way to reaching the 1989 playoffs.\n*December 1, 1988: Bernie Nicholls had an eight-point game versus the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nSeason standings\nRecord vs. opponents\nSchedule and results\n}}\n|-\n| 1 || October 6 || Detroit || 2 – 8 || Los Angeles || || 1–0–0 || 2\n|-\n| 2 || October 8 || Calgary || 5 – 6 || Los Angeles || OT || 2–0–0 || 4\n|-\n| 3 || October 9 || N.Y.
