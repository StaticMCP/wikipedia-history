It is primarily aimed at teenage readers.\nContent\nThe book is a young adult adaptation of 2016's Our Revolution, in which Sanders chronicled his upbringing, first brushes with Democratic Socialism, and emergence into American politics—capped off, with an outline of his policies. It has an emphasis on calling on young people \"to fight for a progressive economic, environmental, racial, and social justice agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment, and provides healthcare for all.\"\nIn the foreword, Sanders points out that, in his campaign for president, he received more votes from young people than Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's combined, and that \"in virtually every state primary and caucus, we won the overwhelming majority of young people—black, white, Latino, Asian American, and Native American\".\nThe book features numerous infographics and illustrations in the hopes of breaking down complex issues like income inequality, climate change, healthcare, law enforcement reform, prison system reform and student loan debt.\nReferences"
