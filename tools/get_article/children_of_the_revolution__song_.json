Rex, written by Marc Bolan. It was a UK number 2 hit single in September 1972. The song broke their sequence of four official single releases all reaching number 1 on the UK Singles Chart (\"Hot Love\", \"Get It On\", \"Telegram Sam\" and \"Metal Guru\", although unofficial releases \"Jeepster\" and \"Debora\" had only reached number 2 and 7 respectively), although it did reach the summit position on the New Musical Express and Melody Maker charts, becoming the last T. Rex single to do so on any UK chart. It did not receive a regular album release.\nRecording\n\"Children of the Revolution\"\nA studio rehearsal of the song, at over twelve minutes in length, was recorded on 31 March 1972 at Copenhagen's Rosenberg Studios during sessions for the band's third album The Slider. Flo & Eddie, formerly of the Turtles, contribute backing vocals to this version of the release. The tape box contained the note that the jam was \"for the attention of Ringo\".\n\"Children of the Revolution\" was next recorded on 6 April 1972 at Apple Studios for the film Born to Boogie, featuring Elton John on piano and Ringo Starr on a drum kit, along with a cover of Little Richard's \"Tutti Frutti\".\nThe recording of the single version of the song began during the initial sessions for the Tanx album in August 1972. The track was mixed at Air Studios in mid August before being released on 8 September.\n\"Jitterbug Love\"\n\"Jitterbug Love\" was initially recorded on 2 August 1972 at the Château d'Hérouville in France, however only the drum track recorded at this session made it to the final release. Additional instrumentation was added at Air Studios on 11 August 1972.\n\"Sunken Rags\"\n\"Sunken Rags\" was recorded during the last of the sessions for The Slider at Rosenberg Studios, Copenhagen in March 1972. A version, credited to Marc Bolan solo, appeared prior to the single release on the 1972 Glastonbury Fayre compilation album.\nRelease and reception\nThe single was released on 8 September 1972. While it topped the Melody Maker and NME charts it could only reach number 2 on the official Record Retailer chart, breaking a run of number one hits for the group. Reviews in the UK were largely positive, with many critics noting the song sounding heavier than the group's usual fare. Penny Valentine of Sounds enthusiastically remarked that it was \"the best he's ever done\" while Chris Welch of Melody Maker opined it was \"a good song with plenty of attack\". Conversely, Danny Holloway of NME complained that Bolan \"had run a good thing into the ground\".\nCover versions\nIn 1986, Violent Femmes released the version of the single from their album The Blind Leading the Naked.\nIn 1989, Greater Manchester artist Baby Ford released an acid house version on the Rhythm King record label.
