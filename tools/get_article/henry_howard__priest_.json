His eldest brother, George, succeeded their father as the 6th Earl of Carlisle in 1825, his second eldest brother, Maj. Frederick Howard, was killed in action at the Battle of Waterloo, and his third brother, William Howard, was a Conservative MP. He had six sisters, including Elizabeth, Duchess of Rutland. He was sent to Eton College in 1805, followed by Christ Church, Oxford, earning a B.A. (1818), M.A. (1822), B.D. (1834), and D.D. (1838).\nCareer\nIn 1820, he was ordained deacon and priest, and in 1822 appointed succentor of York Cathedral, with the prebendal stall of Holme attached. He became Dean of Lichfield and rector of Tatenhill, Staffordshire (a preferment worth £1,524 a year with a residence), on 27 November 1833, and in the following year he also obtained the rectory of Donington, Shropshire, worth £1,000 per annum ().
