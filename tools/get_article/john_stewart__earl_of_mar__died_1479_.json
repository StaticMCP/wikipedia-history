The third surviving son of King James II and his wife, Mary of Guelders, he held the title of Earl of Mar. John died under mysterious circumstances in Edinburgh, probably on the orders of his eldest brother, King James III.\nLife\nJohn was probably born in 1457. He was the fourth son of James II of Scotland. John had been given the title of Earl of Mar by 23 June 1459, after a dispute between the king's lawyers and Thomas, Lord Erskine, over possession of the earldom. James II was killed by an exploding cannon in 1460, after which John's eldest brother, James III, became King of Scots.\nLittle is known about John's life; the historian Gordon Donaldson called him \"no more than a name\". John's potential marriage was discussed by the Scottish parliament in 1466. He attended meetings of parliament in 1476 and 1479. John frequently spent time in Aberdeen, and was apparently involved in disputes with residents of that burgh. In April 1476, John received a royal letter commanding the residents of Aberdeen to support him in his local \"feuds\".\nJohn fell under the suspicion of his brother, James III, after attending parliament in Edinburgh in March 1479. Later in 1479, John was arrested and imprisoned at Craigmillar Castle on the king's orders. John's imprisonment may have been related to the downfall of his other brother, Alexander, Duke of Albany, earlier that same year. Two contemporary chronicles claimed that John was arrested over his associations with witchcraft. John was convicted in a trial at Craigmillar, and was then taken to a house in the Canongate of Edinburgh, presumably to serve his sentence. However, he died at this house soon afterwards, possibly in December 1479. According to John Lesley and other later historians, John was killed in his bathtub, traditionally while receiving the contemporary medical treatment of bloodletting.\nJohn never married, and left no known issue.\nAncestry\nReferences\n*\n*"
