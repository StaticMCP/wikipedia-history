It was also released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 19, 2010, and in North America on February 8.\nThe characters are primarily cartoon-like anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables, though the game does contain some human characters, including Princess Tomato's sister, Lisa, and the villainous Farmies.\nPlot\nThe Garlic Wanderer in Orange Park\nTaking the role of Sir Cucumber, a knight, the player is assigned by King Broccoli (now deceased) to defeat the evil Minister Pumpkin, who has kidnapped Princess Tomato. Early on, Sir Cucumber gains a sidekick, Percy the baby persimmon, who offers advice and helps throughout the quest (and always refers to Sir Cucumber as \"Boss\").\nGameplay\nPrincess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom plays similarly to a text adventure, though due to the NES's lack of a keyboard accessory, the possible commands are represented by buttons which line both sides of the screen. The commands are fixed and do not change during gameplay. Primarily, the game consists of still screens, with the exception of the \"finger wars\", mazes and occasional animated character, such as the octoberry and fernbirds. Players can issue commands to the game's protagonist. While the player may run into difficulty determining which actions will advance the game, the only way to \"lose\" is by failing to defeat the second-to-last boss, Minister Pumpkin, in a penultimate game of \"finger wars\".\nRelease and reception\n|rev1 =\n|rev1Score = 2/5\n}}\nPrincess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom was released for the Famicom on May 27, 1988.\nReviewing the Famicom release, two reviewers in Biweekly Famicom Tsūshin said that the game has been updated since its home computer release with better selection commands and while one reader said it was written in an \"easy-to-read\" kanji, the text could use more subtlety. The reviewer in  said it had changed so much, it might as well be a new game.\nThree of the reviewers complimented the story and setting and themes as making the game fun and cute. One review in Famicom Hisshobon disliked the gameplay elements of a 3D maze and the Rock Paper Scissors efforts were obnoxious and the graphics were below average, saying that even Princess Tomato is not even cute.\nLegacy\nPrincess Tomato makes an appearance in Super Bomberman R as a playable DLC character named \"Princess Tomato Bomber\". She was added in the 2.0 update released in November 2017.\nSee also\n* List of Nintendo Entertainment System games\n* List of Hudson Soft games\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
