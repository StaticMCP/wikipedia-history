Occurring during the Rif War or Morocco War, the series revolves around a group of nurses from Madrid who are sent to Africa by Queen Victoria Eugenia to open a hospital in the war torn region. The nurses learn firsthand the cruelty of war, but still find time for romance. The series debuted in 2017 on Antena 3 and in 2018 on Netflix.\nPlot\nIn 1921, Morocco is being ravaged by the events of the Rif War. The Riffian resistance in the country has killed many soldiers of the Spanish Army and wounded many more. To succour them, Queen Victoria Eugenie sends a group of nurses from the Spanish Red Cross to Melilla to establish a new hospital. Led by the Duchess of Victoria, María del Carmen Angoloti y Mesa, the group is composed of young women from Spain's upper classes.\nThe nurses arrive in Melilla and set up a hospital in an old school building. Almost immediately, they are put into action. Yet, despite all the horrors of war that surround them, these nurses have not lost hope and still find  romance with the soldiers and doctors who surround them.\nIn time, the military high command recognizes that more lives can be saved on the front lines before wounded soldiers are even brought back to the hospital. None of these nurses is combat trained, but some of them will now have to learn how to stay alive while serving on the front lines.\nCast\n.\n* José Sacristán as Colonel Vicente Márquez.\n* Amaia Salamanca as Julia Ballester.\n* Álex García as Fidel Calderón.\n* Verónica Sánchez as Pilar Muñiz de Solaruce.\n*  as Magdalena Medina.\n*  as Lieutenant Andrés Pereda.\n*  as Alférez Pedro Ballester.\n* Alicia Rubio as Verónica Montellano.\n* Daniel Lundh as Larbi Al Hamza.\n* Silvia Alonso as Susana Márquez.\n* Carmen Balagué as Manuela de la Maza.\n*  as medical lieutenant Luis Garcés.\n*  as Raquel Fuentes.\n* Miguel Rellán as Suboficial Dámaso.\n* Vicente Romero as Comandante Silva.\n*  as medical lieutenant Guillermo.\n* Toni Agustí as Captain Somarriba.\n* David Marcé as Daniel.\n*  as the Queen.\n* Marc Clotet as Alejandro Prada.\n* Pepa Rus as Gloria Montellano.\n}}\nProduction\nProduced by Atresmedia Televisión in collaboration with Bambú Producciones, the series was created by Ramón Campos, Teresa Fernández-Valdés and Gemma R.
