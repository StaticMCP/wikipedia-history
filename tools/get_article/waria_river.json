It flows into the Solomon Sea.  The river is fast-flowing with heavy sediment.  The lower Waria Valley is home to the indigenous Zia people, flowing through the communities of Pema, Popoe and Saigara.  Australian anthropologist Ernest Chinnery discovered the source of the river in the 1910s.\nSee also\n* Waria Rural LLG"
