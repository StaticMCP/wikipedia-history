He rose to prominence as one of the principal lead singers of the R&B vocal group the Drifters, singing the lead vocals on three of their biggest hit singles: \"There Goes My Baby\", \"This Magic Moment\", and \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (their only US number one hit).\nAs a soloist, King is best known as the singer and co-composer of \"Stand by Me\", which became a US top-10 hit, both in 1961 and later in 1986 (when it was used as the theme to the film of the same name), and a number-one hit in the United Kingdom in 1987. The single was also placed on the RIAA's list of Songs of the Century. His 1975 single \"Supernatural Thing\" became a top-five hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, King was the original recording artist of songs such as \"Spanish Harlem\", \"I (Who Have Nothing)\", \"So Much Love\", \"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\", \"We're Gonna Groove\", and \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore\", all of which have been covered by multiple artists to varying degrees of success.\nKing was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, as a member of the Drifters, and has been nominated as a solo artist. Along with the Drifters' \"There Goes My Baby\", King's songs \"Stand by Me\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" also appeared on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Additionally, he was inducted alongside the Drifters into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000, as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 with the Towering song award.\nEarly life\nBenjamin Earl Nelson was born on September 28, 1938, in Henderson, North Carolina, but moved to Harlem, New York, at the age of nine in 1947. He began singing in church choirs, and in high school formed the Four B's, a doo-wop group that occasionally performed at the Apollo Theater.\nCareer\nThe Drifters\nIn 1958, King (still using his birth name) joined a doo-wop group called the Five Crowns. Later that year, the Drifters' manager George Treadwell fired the members of the original Drifters, and replaced them with the members of the Five Crowns.\nKing had a string of R&B hits with the group on Atlantic Records. He co-wrote and sang lead on the first Atlantic hit by the new version of the Drifters, \"There Goes My Baby\" (1959). King sang lead on a succession of hits by the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, including \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"This Magic Moment\", and \"I Count the Tears\". He recorded only 13 songs with the two backing other lead singers and 11 lead vocal including an unreleased song called \"Temptation\" (later redone by Drifters vocalist Johnny Moore). The last of the King-led Drifters singles to be released was \"Sometimes I Wonder\", which was recorded on May 19, 1960, but not issued until June 1962.\nAfter a year of touring with the Drifters, contract disputes arose with Treadwell, in which King and his manager Lover Patterson demanded greater compensation. Treadwell refused, and King was only hired for studio recordings. On television, fellow Drifters member Charlie Thomas usually lip-synched the songs that King had recorded with the Drifters.\nSolo career\nIn May 1960, King left the Drifters, assuming the stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a solo career. Remaining with Atlantic Records on its Atco imprint, his first release, \"Show Me the Way\"/\"Brace Yourself\" failed to hit the charts. His second effort, \"A Help-Each-Other\"/\"How Often\", with Lavern Baker, was not a hit either. King’s first charting single was \"First Taste of Love\". It peaked on the US Billboard at number 53, but it became a bigger hit in the UK, charting at number 27. His first Top 10 release as a solo artist was \"Spanish Harlem\" (1961), written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector and produced by Leiber and Mike Stoller. It peaked on the US pop charts at number 10, and on Billboard's R&B chart at number 15.\nKing's next single, \"Stand by Me\", written with Leiber and Stoller, ultimately would be voted as one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. King cited singers Brook Benton, Roy Hamilton, and Sam Cooke as influences for his vocals of the song. \"Stand by Me\", \"There Goes My Baby\", \"Spanish Harlem\", and \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" were all named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll; and each of those records has earned a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. King's other well-known songs include \"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\", \"Amor\", \"Seven Letters\", \"How Can I Forget\", \"I Swear by Stars Above\" , \"It Ain’t Fair\", \"Young Boy Blues\", \"Its All Over\", \"River of Tears\", \"Ecstasy\", \"She’s gone Again\", \"That's When It Hurts\", and \"On the Horizon\". In the summer of 1963, King had a Top 30 hit with \"I (Who Have Nothing)\", which reached the Top 10 on New York's radio station, WMCA.\nKing's records continued to place well on the Billboard Hot 100 chart until the mid-1960s. British pop bands began to dominate the pop music scene, but King still continued to make R&B hits. Some of these hits include \"What is Soul?\", \"Tears, Tears, Tears\", and \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore\". In 1975, King made a comeback on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with the disco hit \"Supernatural Thing\": number 5 on Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Billboard R&B chart. It was also nominated for a Grammy at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards in 1975 for \"best R&B vocal performance, male\". In 1977, King collaborated with Average White Band in releasing the album Benny & Us. The album spawned two top 40 R&B hits, \"A Star in the Ghetto\" and \"Get It Up\".\nKing returned to the Drifters in late 1982 in the United Kingdom and sang with them until the group's break-up and reorganization in 1986. From 1983 until the band's break-up, the other members of this incarnation of the Drifters were Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown.\nA 1986 re-issue of \"Stand by Me\" followed the song's use as the theme song to the movie Stand By Me and re-entered the Billboard top ten after a 25-year absence. This reissue also topped the charts in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for three weeks in February 1987. The reissue also made King the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 10 in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, either as a member of an act that reached that high (in this case, the Drifters) or as a solo act that did.\nIn 1990, King and Bo Diddley, along with Doug Lazy, recorded a revamped hip hop version of the Monotones' 1958 hit song \"Book of Love\" for the soundtrack of the movie Book of Love. He also recorded a children's album, I Have Songs In My Pocket, written and produced by children's music artist Bobby Susser in 1998, which won the Early Childhood News Directors' Choice Award and Dr. Toy's/the Institute for Childhood Resources Award. King performed \"Stand by Me\" on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2007. Ahmet Ertegun said, \"King is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll and rhythm and blues.\"\nAs a Drifter and as a solo artist, King has achieved a few number-one hits: \"There Goes My Baby\", \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"Stand By Me\", \"Supernatural Thing\", and the 1986 re-issue of \"Stand By Me\". On the US pop and R&B charts combined, he achieved 12 Top 10 hits and 28 Top 40 hits. King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Drifter; he was also nominated as a solo artist.\n, Massachusetts, on March 31, 2012]]\nA re-recording of King's \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" was selected for the Sopranos Peppers and Eggs Soundtrack CD (2001).\nKing was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.\nOn March 27, 2012, the Songwriters Hall of Fame announced that \"Stand By Me\" would receive its 2012 Towering Song Award and that King would be honored with the 2012 Towering Performance Award for his recording of the song.\nLater life\nKing was active in his charitable foundation, the Stand By Me Foundation, which helps to provide education to deserving youths. King was a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey, from the late 1960s onwards.\nKing performed \"Stand by Me\" during a televised tribute to late comedian George Carlin, as he was one of Carlin's favorite artists. On November 11, 2010, King performed \"Stand by Me\" at the Latin Grammys with Prince Royce.\nKing toured the United Kingdom in 2013 and played concerts in the United States as late as 2014, despite reported health problems.\nFollowing a brief illness, King died at Hackensack University Medical Center on April 30, 2015; he was 76 years old. King was married to his wife Betty, for 50 years, and had three children: Terris Cannon, Benjamin King Jr., and Angela Matos, in addition to six grandchildren.\nLegacy\nKing has been covered by acts from several genres. \"So Much Love\" was recorded by Dusty Springfield and many others. \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" was performed by Shirley Bassey in 1963 and also by Tom Jones in 1970, as well as a 1979 recording by Sylvester. \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore\" was revisited by peer Ray Charles in 1970 and \"Spanish Harlem\" was sung by Aretha Franklin in 1971. \"Stand by Me\" was covered by the Righteous Brothers, Otis Redding, John Lennon, Mickey Gilley, Seal, Florence and the Machine, and Tracy Chapman. The song forms the basis for the Indian hit \"Dildaara\" by songwriters Vishal–Shekhar. King also inspired a number of rock bands: Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded \"Supernatural Thing\" in 1981 and Led Zeppelin did a cover version of \"Groovin'\", which is better known under the title of \"We're Gonna Groove\".\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Year\n! colspan=\"4\" |Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%\" |US\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%\" |USR&B\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%\" |UK\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Spanish Harlem\n| 1961\n| —\n| —\n| 30\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Ben E.
