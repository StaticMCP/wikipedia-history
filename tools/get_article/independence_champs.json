They moved to the OAK League when the KSL folded after the 1906 season. The OAK League folded after the 1907 season, with Independence and fellow OAK League members Bartlesville and Muskogee moving to the new Oklahoma–Kansas League for the 1908 season.\nMultiple notable players spent time with the team, including Chick Brandom, Drummond Brown, Dick Crutcher, Danny Friend and Marc Hall.\nTimeline\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\"\n!
