The resurgence allowed Disney's animated films to become powerhouse successes at the domestic and foreign box office, earning much greater profit than most of the Disney films of previous eras.\nThe animated films released by Disney during this period are: The Little Mermaid (1989), The Rescuers Down Under (1990), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Pocahontas (1995), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Hercules (1997), Mulan (1998), and Tarzan (1999).\nIn just ten years, Disney Renaissance films have received many awards and nominations. Nine of the ten films were nominated for Academy Awards, six of which won at least one Academy Award; six Best Original Song and five Best Original Score, with the first five films won awards in both categories. Disney Renaissance is also notable for being its film Beauty and the Beast became the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture. Nine of the films were nominated for Annie Awards, with eight of them winning at least one, and five of them received Best Animated Feature.\nAlan Menken has received most of the awards and nominations in his career thanks to the Disney Renaissance.\nAcademy Awards\nThe Rescuers Down Under is the only Disney Renaissance film to not have an Academy Award nomination of any kind.\nhas received more Academy Award wins (8) and nominations (14) for his work in Disney Renaissance than any other period in his career.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Category\n!Film\n!Nominee(s)\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1990\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Original Song\n| rowspan=\"3\" |The Little Mermaid\n|\"Under the Sea\" — Music by Alan Menken; Lyrics by Howard Ashman\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\"Kiss the Girl\" — Music by Alan Menken; Lyrics by Howard Ashman\n|\n|-\n|Best Original Score\n|Alan Menken\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |1992\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Best Original Song\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Beauty and the Beast\n|\"Beauty and the Beast\" — Music by Alan Menken; Lyrics by Howard Ashman\n|\n| rowspan=\"6\" |\n|-\n|\"Be Our Guest\" — Music by Alan Menken; Lyrics by Howard Ashman\n|\n|-\n|\"Belle\" — Music by Alan Menken; Lyrics by Howard Ashman\n|\n|-\n|Best Original Score\n|Alan Menken\n|\n|-\n|Best Picture\n|Don Hahn\n|\n|-\n|Best Sound\n|Terry Porter, Mel Metcalfe, David J.
