It was unveiled to the public during the park's reopening on May 19, 2021. The ride features a short film directed by Takashi Yamazaki, along with new designs by Yamazaki for the monsters that appear in the ride.\nPlot\nThe public address system at a Tokyo movie theater suddenly warns that a giant monster was attacking Japan. A Japan Self-Defense Forces soldier enters and shows footage of King Ghidorah ravaging the city with his gravity beams and Godzilla approaching from the sea. The soldier received orders to evacuate the people in an armored vehicle operated by the Special Disaster Countermeasures unit and airlifted by helicopter. He delivers a safety briefing just before Ghidorah destroys the part of the theater, the dragon roars at the audience, then flies away.\nGhidorah destroys the lead vehicle with rubble, meanwhile the second vehicle evades a flying train car and Ghidorah. The dragon lands in front of it, but it drives between Ghidorah's legs. Ghidorah gives chase, trying and failing to bite it with all three of his heads. Ghidorah keeps chasing the vehicle until he soon finds it and snatches it up in the jaws of his center head. Ghidorah takes the vehicle but is intercepted by Rodan. Ghidorah overpowers and defeats Rodan and drops the vehicle. Ghidorah blasts the top off of Tokyo Tower towards the vehicle, Godzilla arrives in the city and challenges Ghidorah to fight. The vehicle lands on Godzilla's side and evades the two monsters, landing on a roof to watch the monsters fight.\nGodzilla overpowers and defeats Ghidorah with a powerful blast of atomic breath. Godzilla roars in victory as the vehicle lands on the ground, only to be caught up with one of Ghidorah's still-conscious heads. Godzilla crushes Ghidorah's final head with his foot, splashing blue blood on the vehicle and ground before Godzilla roars victoriously.\nReception\nOn September 16, 2022, Nicholas Driscoll wrote a review about Godzilla the Ride:\n}}\nReferences\n*  Text was copied from [https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_the_Ride:_Giant_Monsters_Ultimate_Battle Wikizilla], which is released under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license]."
