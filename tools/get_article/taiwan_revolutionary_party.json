The TRP advocated for labor and other social movements and supported the liberation of Taiwanese nation. The TRR also referred to the PRC as \"great power\" (列強) rather than an anti-imperialist state. So they were against the Chinese Communist Party, although there was a Marxist–Leninist element.\nIn May 1986, Hsu Hsin-liang defected from the Taiwan Revolutionary Party, saying, \"If the KMT sincerely promotes democratization, it has no intention of overthrowing the KMT regime in a revolutionary way\". The TRP disbanded on March 23, 1987.\nSee also\n* Anti-imperialism\n* Minzu jiefang (民族解放)\n* Taiwan independence Left\nReferences"
