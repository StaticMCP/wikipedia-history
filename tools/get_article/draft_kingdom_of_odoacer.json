The creation of this state marked the end of the Western Roman Empire. Odoacer's Kingdom lasted until the assassination of Odoacer by Theoderic the Great who proclaimed himself King of Italy under the Ostrogothic Kingdom.\nGovernance\nOdoacer's rule over the Kingdom was managed with resumption of activities of the Roman Senate Under Odoacer's rule freedom of religion was also granted to Pagans and Christians\nHistory\nIn 476, Odoacer was proclaimed rex by his soldiers and dux Italiae by emperor Zeno, initiating a new administrative era over Roman lands. Odoacer introduced a few important changes to the administrative system of Italy. According to Jordanes, at the beginning of his reign he \"slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans.\" He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighbouring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king Gaiseric to cede Sicily to him. Noting that \"Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November\", F. M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476. When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (9 May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.\nAs Bury points out, \"It is highly important to observe that Odoacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources permit us to draw inferences.\" He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the Consulate and other prestigious offices: \"Basilius, Decius, Venantius, and Manlius Boethius held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; Symmachus and Sividius were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance.\" A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the Senate acquired \"enhanced prestige and influence\" in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule. As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, for the first time since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend S(enatus) C(onsulto). Jones describes these coins as \"fine big copper pieces\", which were \"a great improvement on the miserable little  hitherto current\", and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by Anastasius in the Eastern Empire.\nIn 487/488, Odoacer led his army to victory against the Rugians in Noricum, taking their king Feletheus into captivity; when word that Feletheus's son, Fredericus, had returned to his people, Odoacer sent his brother Onoulphus with an army back to Noricum against him. Onoulphus found it necessary to evacuate the remaining Romans and resettled them in Italy. The remaining Rugians fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths; the abandoned province was settled by the Lombards by 493.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.example.com www.example.com]"
