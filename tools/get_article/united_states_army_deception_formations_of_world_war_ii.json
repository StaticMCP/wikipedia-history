The most notable fictional US formation was the First United States Army Group (FUSAG); this force was originally intended as the main invasion force for the Invasion of Normandy. However, the British 21st Army Group took up this role. FUSAG remained in existence on paper and was used during Operation Fortitude South to divert Axis attention to the Pas de Calais area.\nThe imaginary formations ranged in size from battalion to field army and were faked using documents, photographs, double agents, news reportage and physical subterfuge. Some of the units were either based on previously active formations (usually World War I formations) or created afresh. Many were used multiple times, Clarke in particular believed that reusing units in the long term would help establish their existence in the mind of the enemy.\nField armies and army groups\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Had Operation Pastel been carried out, the first elements of the Corps, quartering parties of the notional 18th Airborne Division, would have been depicted as reaching Okinawa on 15 August 1945. Following this glider pilots were to have been depicted as reaching Okinawa around 20 August 1945, followed by the troops of the real 11th and 18th Airborne Divisions, starting to arrive in Okinawa on 1 September 1945.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| XXXVII Corps\n|1944\n|\n|\n* 17th Infantry Division\n* 59th Infantry Division\n|Fortitude South\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|XXXVIII Corps\n|\n|\n|None\n|Fortitude South\n|Activated as part of SHAEF, never used.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|XXXIX Corps\n|\n|\n|None\n|Fortitude South\n|Activated as part of SHAEF, never used.\n|}\nDivisions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Supposedly arrived in Sicily from the United States in May 1944. It was notionally attached to the Seventh United States Army and was to be dropped on the town of Paulhan in France to support a fictional invasion of the Narbonne region. It was disposed of by announcing in July 1944 that the division had been disbanded.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|9th Airborne Division\n|June – November 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*523rd Parachute Infantry Regiment\n*196th Glider Infantry Regiment\n*199th Glider Infantry Regiment\n|Fortitude South\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|11th Infantry Division\n|? – October 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*178th Infantry Regiment\n*352nd Infantry Regiment\n*392nd Infantry Regiment\n|Fortitude South\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|14th Infantry Division\n|June - September 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n|Ferdinand\n|Activated as part of SHAEF.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|17th Infantry Division\n|June – October 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n* 293rd Infantry Regiment\n* 336th Infantry Regiment\n* 375th Infantry Regiment\n|Fortitude South\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|18th Airborne Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*566th Parachute Infantry Regiment\n*567th Glider Infantry Regiment\n*570th Glider Infantry Regiment\n|Dervish (1945)Pastel Two\n|Dervish was an unrealized deception plan intended to further strain the German war effort in early 1945. It sought to depict a large-scale airborne threat to the strategically vital Stendal–Brandenburg–Wittenberg–Magdeburg region, with the airborne force possessing the resources to support itself for thirty days. Although Dervish ultimately came to nothing, the notional 18th Airborne Division was activated in the United States to support this effort, and plans were made to depict it being deployed to Europe. The 18th Airborne was later designated for use in Pastel, the deception plan to protect Operation Olympic, the planned invasion of Kyushu.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|21st Airborne Division\n|June – November 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*521st Parachute Infantry Regiment\n*277th Glider Infantry Regiment\n*278th Glider Infantry Regiment\n|Fortitude South\n|The division was initially depicted as being under the direct command of US 14th Army with its headquarters located in Fulbeck, Lincolnshire in June 1944. In the Pas de Calais landings it and the 9th Airborne Division were to be dropped behind the XXXVII Corps beachheads. In August 1944 it was notionally transferred to the direct command of First United States Army Group, where it assisted in the training of the U.S. 48th Infantry Division in air landing techniques. In the aftermath of Fortitude South, the notional U.S. 9th and 21st Airborne Divisions, the notional British 2nd Airborne Division, and the real United States 17th Airborne Division were used to depict an airborne threat to the Kiel-Bremen area, supporting Operation Market Garden. In November 1944 it was announced that the division had been merged with the 9th Airborne Division to form the 13th Airborne Division, a real unit that was about to be deployed to France.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|22nd Infantry Division\n|June - September 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n|Ferdinand\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|46th Infantry Division\n|December 1943 – March 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n| Operation Fortitude\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|48th Infantry Division\n|June – December 1944\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*80th Infantry Regiment\n*95th Infantry Regiment\n*146th Infantry Regiment\n|Fortitude South\n|The 48th Infantry Division was \"created\" in 1944 as an 'phantom division'. It formed part of Operation Quicksilver and Fortitude South II to replace the real 6th Armored Division when it moved to Normandy.\nThe division was presented to the Germans as a well trained unit that had been formed at Camp Clatsop, Oregon, in 1942. Following training at the Desert Training Center and maneuvers in the Olympic Peninsula the division had guarded the ALCAN Highway before being shipped to England in June 1944, where Agent Garbo reported that the uncle of one of his agents (An American NCO in the ETO Services of Supply.) was a member of the division, which was not at the time he made the report under the command of either the First US Army Group or the 21st Army Group. After disembarkation, the division established its initial headquarters at Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire before moving to Woodbridge in Suffolk. There, as part of the  U.S. XXXIII Corps (United States) of the US 14th Army it was assigned the role of following up the Pas de Calais landings.\nFollowing Fortitude South II the division was depicted as moving to Brockenhurst in Hampshire where it carried out air landing training in conjunction with the US 21st Airborne Division. In December 1944 the division was depicted as moving to Dundee in Scotland where it was disbanded at the start of 1945, with some soldiers being used as replacements for other units while a small cadre returned to the United States.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|50th Infantry Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|None\n|None\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|55th Infantry Division\n|October 1943 – March 1945\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*78th Infantry Regiment\n*83rd Infantry Regiment\n*96th Infantry Regiment\n|Fortitude North\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|59th Infantry Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*94th Infantry Regiment\n*139th Infantry Regiment\n*171st Infantry Regiment\n|Fortitude South\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|15th Armored Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|None\n|None\n|Activated as part of SHAEF, never used.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|25th Armored Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*72nd Tank Battalion\n*73rd Tank Battalion\n*74th Tank Battalion\n*498th Armored Infantry Battalion\n*499th Armored Infantry Battalion\n*500th Armored Infantry Battalion\n|Fortitude South\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|39th Armored Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|None\n|None\n|Activated as part of SHAEF, never used.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|119th Infantry Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*488th Infantry Regiment\n*489th Infantry Regiment\n*491st Infantry Regiment\n*639th Field Artillery Battalion\n*640th Field Artillery Battalion\n*641st Field Artillery Battalion\n*649th Field Artillery Battalion\n|Wedlock\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|130th Infantry Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*492nd Infantry Regiment\n*493rd Infantry Regiment\n*494th Infantry Regiment\n*642nd Field Artillery Battalion\n*643rd Field Artillery Battalion\n*644th Field Artillery Battalion\n*650th Field Artillery Battalion\n|Wedlock\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|135th Airborne Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*551st Parachute Infantry Regiment\n*524th Glider Infantry Regiment\n*525th Glider Infantry Regiment\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|141st Infantry Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*495th Infantry Regiment\n*496th Infantry Regiment\n*497th Infantry Regiment\n*645th Field Artillery Battalion\n*646th Field Artillery Battalion\n*647th Field Artillery Battalion\n*651st Field Artillery Battalion\n|Wedlock\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|157th Infantry Division\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |\n|\n*557th Infantry Regiment\n*558th Infantry Regiment\n*565th Infantry Regiment\n*944th Field Artillery Battalion\n*946th Field Artillery Battalion\n*952nd Field Artillery Battalion\n*956th Field Artillery Battalion\n|Wedlock\n|\n|}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
