This was a move from the position of abbot at Bruerne Abbey. Previously he had been vicar at Charlbury.\nKing became abbot at Oseney Abbey in 1537. Both Thame Park and Oseney were dissolved in 1539, as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. In 1541 King was made Bishop of Thame and Oseney. The next year his diocese was changed, into the Diocese of Oxford. In further changes the cathedral in Oxford was the previous St Frideswide's Priory, and became instead part of Christ Church, Oxford. King is commemorated there by a window made by Bernard van Linge.\nThe buildings of the old Gloucester College, Oxford, which had become in 1542 the bishop's palace, were under Edward VI taken back by the Crown. King lived in what is now called the Old Palace (rebuilt in the seventeenth century), and Littlemore Hall.\nUnder Mary, he returned to Catholicism. He was a judge at the trial of Cranmer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/RobertKing.htm Tudor Place – Robert King, Bishop of Oseney and Oxford]\n*[http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/bishops/ Oxford History – Bishops – Introduction]"
