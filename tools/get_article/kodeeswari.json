The contestant was given 60 seconds if the contestant successfully answered the 10th question, they could answer 11-15 questions. In the meantime, the clock would be disappeared, and the player could think long time as they wanted.\nLifelines\n* Audience Poll (பார்வையாளர் கருத்துக்கணிப்பு):- If any contestant would use this lifeline, the host would repeat the question to the audience. The studio audience would get 10 seconds to answer the question. Audience members would use touchpads to give the answer what they believe.
