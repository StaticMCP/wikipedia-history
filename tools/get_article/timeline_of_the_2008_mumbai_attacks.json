Security was increased, but was removed soon after.\nOn 18 November, Indian intelligence agencies intercepted a satellite phone call to a leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist organization, which revealed plans for a sea borne attack.\nEntry into India and initial attacks\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!style=\"width: 70px;\"|Date!!style=\"width: 120px;\"|Estimated Time(+0530 UTC)!!
