The club was eliminated in the second round of the 2000 U.S. Open Cup after losing 1–0 to the Mid-Michigan Bucks. They qualified for the quarterfinals of the MLS Cup Playoffs, where they were eliminated by the Chicago Fire in a three-game series.\nSummary\nThe Revolution entered a busy off-season following their 1999 campaign, in which they'd missed the playoffs for the second year in a row. On October 12, 1999, the Revolution named Sunil Gulati managing director of Kraft Soccer and appointed Brian O’Donovan as chief operating officer. Following the dismissal of Walter Zenga on September 30, the Revolution appointed Fernando Clavijo as their fourth-ever manager (following Steve Nicol's interim stay at the end of the 1999 season). Renato Capobianco joined Clavijo's staff as an assistant on December 7, and on January 5,  Derek Aframe would join the front office as the Vice President of Operations.\nThe Revs made several acquisitions in the offseason to strengthen their squad. On December 3, Clavijo's Revolution made their first acquisition, signing 1996 MLS All-Star and MLS Best XI striker Eduardo \"El Tanque\" Hurtado. Three days later, the Revolution acquired 1998 MLS All-Star Mauricio Ramos and a selection in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft from the Tampa Bay Mutiny in exchange for a \"player allocation.\"\nFebruary 6, the Revolution acquired Wolde Harris and a third-round pick in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft from the Colorado Rapids in exchange for New England's first- and second-round picks\nin the 2000 MLS SuperDraft. In the 2000 MLS SuperDraft, Revolution selected Rusty Pierce, Shaker Asad,\nFabio Zúñiga, Bo Oshoniyi, Adam Eyre, and Tom Hardy. The club also signed goalkeeper Scott Budnick off waivers from the Miami Fusion. In March, the Revolution signed Costa Rican international William Sunsing from CS Herediano and acquired U.S. International goalkeeper Juergen Sommer from the Columbus Crew in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft and future considerations.\nDespite missing star striker Joe-Max Moore, who had signed for Everton F.C. in November, Clavijo's Revolution got off to a strong start to the season, dropping only four of their opening fifteen matches. The season opened on March 18 with a 1–1 draw away to the Miami Fusion, courtesy of an Imad Baba 80th minute equalizing goal. The Revolution's first win came in the season home opener, 2-1, thanks to a brace from Baba. In May the club went on a five-game unbeaten run, the longest in their existence to that point.\nThe club made several more acquisitions as the season progressed. Midfielder Joe Franchino signed for the club in May from the LA Galaxy, as part of a \"special draft\" that saw Luis Hernández join the Galaxy.\n1998 MLS All-Star Mauricio Wright also joined the club in June from the San Jose Earthquakes, in exchange for 1996 Revolution marquee signing Mike Burns, Dan Calichman, and a first-round pick in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft.\nIn July, the Revolution acquired U.S. International Eric Wynalda and future draft considerations\nfrom the Miami Fusion in exchange for defender Ivan McKinley. The club also signed Spanish forward José Luis Morales from Salamanca.\nThe Revolution made history in the 2000 U.S. Open Cup, becoming the first-ever MLS team to lose to an amateur club, when they were defeated in the second round at home by the Mid Michigan Bucks 1-0.\nAfter a six-game winless run mid-summer, the Revolution picked up only four wins in August and September, but still managed to clinch a playoff spot in the final game of the season; a 4–3 win over the MetroStars that saw a brace from Joe Franchino. The Revolution concluded their regular season with a 13-13-6 record (W-L-D), their best in club history to that point.\nIn the Revolution's second-ever playoff campaign, the club squared off against \"Central Division\" champion and overall 2nd-seed Chicago Fire in a best-of-three series. The Revolution took a 50th-minute lead in the opening game at Soldier Field, but conceded an own goal four minutes later, and lost on a 73rd minute Dema Kovalenko goal. Four days later the Revolution leveled the tie, in a 2–1 home victory thanks to goals from Eric Wynalda and Mauricio Wright. The match marked the fist playoff victory in Revolution history. Unfortunately in the final match of the tie, the Revolution conceded four first-half goals, en route to a 6-0 Fire victory, and the end of the Revolution's season.\nSquad\nFirst-team squad\nAs of September 30, 2024.\nPlayer Movement\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a; text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | New England Revolution – 2000 Transfers In\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Position\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Method\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Fee\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Previous Club\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Reference\n|-\n| Wolde Harris || FW || February 6, 2000 || Trade || N/A  || Colorado Rapids ||\n|-\n| Rusty Pierce || DF || February 11, 2000 || Draft || N/A || UNC Greensboro Spartans ||\n|-\n| Shaker Asad || MF || February 11, 2000 || Draft || N/A ||NC State||\n|-\n| Fabio Zuniga || FW ||February 11, 2000 || Draft || N/A || N/A||\n|-\n| Bo Oshoniyi || GK ||February 11, 2000 ||Draft || N/A || Atlanta Silverbacks FC||\n|-\n| Adam Eyre || DF ||February 11, 2000 ||Draft || N/A || Santa Clara||\n|-\n| Tom Hardy || DF ||February 11, 2000 ||Draft || N/A || Vancouver 86ers||\n|-\n| Scott Budnick || GK || February 11, 2000 || Waiver claim || N/A || Miami Fusion||\n|-\n| William Sunsing || FW || March 7, 2000 || Transfer || Undisclosed ||  C.S.
