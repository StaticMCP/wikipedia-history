In addition, they needed to have been produced or majority co-produced by a British company, or in receipt of at least 51% of their budget from a British source. Lastly, they could not be solely funded by a single studio.\nNominations were announced in early October 2000. The award ceremony, hosted by Richard Blackwood, was held later that same month and for the third year in succession at the Café Royal, in London's West End. Winners in eleven categories were selected from the shortlists and a further three were awarded entirely at the jury's discretion, whose make up included Andy Paterson, Ayub Khan Din, Declan Lowney, Duncan Heath, Fiona Mitchell, Michele Camarda, Richard Holmes, Rupert Preston and Samantha Morton.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"50%\" |Best British Independent Film\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Billy Elliot – Stephen Daldry'\n** Last Resort – Paweł Pawlikowski\n** One Day in September – Kevin Macdonald\n** Saving Grace – Nigel Cole\n** The House of Mirth – Terence Davies\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Stephen Daldry – Billy Elliot\n** Nigel Cole – Saving Grace\n** Terence Davies – The House of Mirth\n** Mike Leigh – Topsy-Turvy\n** Paul Pawlikowski – Last Resort\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actor\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Daniel Craig – Some Voices as Ray'\n** Paul Bettany – Gangster No. 1 as Young Gangster\n** Jim Broadbent – Topsy-Turvy as W.
