Due to a naming conflict with an existing blog publishing system, Sterling Hughes suggested the name serendipity. This suggestion is based on an Essay by Sam Ruby. The short form s9y stems from abbreviations such as i18n for internationalization where the number represents the amount of omitted letters. Today the project is maintained by Garvin Hicking.\nBook\nThe first book about Serendipity was published in German by OpenSourcePress: Serendipity - Individuelle Weblogs für Einsteiger und Profis.\nThe publisher donated the book's copyright to the Serendipity project, who has released it under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and made a GitHub repository available online.\nSee also\n* Comparison of content management systems\nReferences"
