She was briefly captured by Taiping troops and renamed Ti-ping under their service.\nHistory\nFirefly was an armed steamer of the Ever Victorious Army, purchased into the army in 1863 by Li Hongzhang. Under the command of one Captain Ludlam, she participated in the retaking of Kahpoo (Zhapu) on 27 July 1863 and Wokong (Wujiang) on 28 July 1863.\nWhile moored in Shanghai, on 15 November 1863, Firefly was stolen by British adventurer Augustus Frederick Lindley. Lindley was offered £20,000 by the Taiping government for the steamer. At midnight, Lindley, along with around 30 Europeans, were guided on board by one of Ludlam's Cantonese servant. At that time, Firefly was \"filled with ammunition\" and was also carrying a 24-pounder gun intended to be installed on another ship, the Tsatlee. The quartermaster of Firefly managed to escape by jumping overboard, and brought the news to Ludlam. Also on board was four European crew of the Firefly: Dolly, Martin, Perry and Easton. Lindley promised to deliver the men as prisoner-of-wars to Ludlam, but their bodies were later found burnt and mutilated with signs of torture.\nThe theft and deaths were eventually reported to the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, who claimed that the men were \"roasted to death\" and used the incident as an example of the Taiping's cruelty. Lindley would later deny direct involvement in the men's deaths.\nIn any case, the steamer was presented to Li Xiucheng, put under the command of Lindley and renamed Ti-ping. With Ti-ping, the Taiping Army captured the town of  in Changzhou. The steamer was recaptured by Qing forces in 1864, and subsequently destroyed in another battle in Changzhou on 25 December 1864.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
