It is an adaptation of Alice Thomas Ellis’s 1987 novel of the same name. The production was first broadcast on BBC2 in 1993 and stars Lena Headey in one of her early leading roles.\nPlot\nThe story follows Margaret, a quiet and unassuming young woman who finds herself reluctantly engaged to a man she does not love. Pressured by family expectations and social convention, she attempts to navigate the complexities of her situation while confiding in her friend and confidante. The narrative explores themes of duty, repression, and the quiet forms of resistance open to women constrained by tradition.\nCast\nLena Headey as Margaret\nPadraig O'Loinsigh as Nour(as Padraig Casey)\nBritta Smith as Mother Joseph\nCatherine Schell as Marie-Claire\nPierre Sioufi as Ahmed\nSherine El Ansari as Gypsy Girl\nJulie Walters as Monica\nDavid Threlfall as Syl\nJoan Plowright as Mrs. Monro\nJeanne Moreau as Lili\nAnnabel Burton as Margaret as a Child\nMaggie Steed as Mrs. Raffald\nJohn Wood as Robert\nProduction\nThe film was produced as part of Screen Two, the BBC’s flagship single-drama strand which ran from 1985 to 1998.
