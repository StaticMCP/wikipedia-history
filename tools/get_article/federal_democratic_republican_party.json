Its ideology was federal republicanism and progressivism.\nHistory\nIn 1868, the left-wing and federalist republican wing of the Democrats established the Democratic Federal Republican to achieve a secular and democratic federal republic in Spain.\nThe PRDF was the ruling party during the First Spanish Republic (1873–1874), but it failed in its goal of consolidating a republican form of government and in establishing federalism. After the fall of the First Republic, it became a minority party, although retaining some influence in the republican movement during the Restoration.\nSee also\n* Liberalism and radicalism in Spain\n* List of political parties in Spain\nReferences\n* Jorge Vilches (2001).
