Signed by 75 prominent figures from the artistic, journalistic, and academic communities of Wallonia, the manifesto aimed to promote Walloon culture and identity.\nWalloon Language and Identity\nThe Flemish journalist, Guido Fonteyn, described it as a Walloon awakening.\nFor Dimitrios Karmis and Alain Gagnon, on the road to cultural self-assertion this manifesto has marked a powerful moment.\nFor Emmanuelle Labeau, Arthur Masson's novels before the period of the Manifesto (Masson died in 1970), are located in Wallonia,\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=Legc2mKR3-8C&pg=PA282 Conclusion]}}\nThe regional varieties of French are not necessarily the Walloon dialect but Philip Mosley wrote: }}\nCriticism from Brussels\nThis Manifesto was violently criticized in Brussels:\nFurther response\nAccording to Michael Keating, John Loughlin, and Kris Deschouwer in 2003: The \"single French culture\" is still the official discourse, and is defended  by the French community authorities (...) The Walloon movement of today, supported by a small number of intellectual elites, defends very much the typical Walloon difference, but has not been able to mobilize for it.\nThe Brussels Manifesto was a document published in December 2006 that called for the regionalization of the French Community of Belgium. Similar in spirit to the 1983 Walloon Manifesto, it advocated for increased autonomy for both Wallonia and Brussels within the French Community.\nThe manifesto was signed by prominent figures from Brussels, including philosophers Philippe Van Parijs and Jean-Marc Ferry. Its publication served as a reminder of the long-standing demands of Walloon \"regionalists\" who, since the 1983 manifesto, had called for the dissolution of the French Community and the transfer of its competencies, particularly in education and culture, to the Walloon Region.\nBenoît Lechat summarized the issue:\nThe Manifesto for Walloon Culture concludes with a two-pronged statement regarding inclusivity and regional identity. Firstly, it posits that all those who live and work in Wallonia are undeniably part of the region. This suggests a broad definition of Walloon identity that extends beyond ethnicity or language. Secondly, the manifesto emphasizes that a range of respectable ideas and beliefs contribute to Wallonia's character. This implies a desire for tolerance and openness within the region.\nNew debates\nThe Walloon Minister President started a debate about the Walloon identity on 1 March 2010 in the newspaper La Meuse. He made a proposal to his government to rename the 'Walloon Region' as 'Wallonia'. The director of the Institut Destrée commented on this initiative the day after on the RTBF. He linked this initiative and the Manifesto for Walloon culture together:\nLe Figaro (4 March 2010) reminds the last sentences of the Manifesto for Walloon Culture : 'All those who live and work in the Walloon region are undeniably part of Wallonia.' These sentences are hopefully a reason to hope a peaceful debate...'\nCriticism about this new debate appears both in Wallonia and Brussels, but perhaps mainly in the Brussels' Newspapers. For instance Pascal Lorent in Le Soir 4 March 2010 writes: 'The Walloon identity doesn't exist'. And Pierre Bouillon wrote in Le Soir 6 March 2010 that the Walloon identity refers mainly to tourism, unemployment and bribery in Charleroi. It seems that the dispute between Brussels and Wallonia about this issue remains as for instance Europe since 1945: an encyclopedia, Tome I wrote it for some years: 'A Walloon identity is also emerging that exhibits at the political level the still mainly hidden tension between French-speaking Brussels and Wallonia'  On the contrary, it seems to Paul Piret, journalist at La Libre Belgique,  a debate on the concept 'Identity' is good about  political citizenship, roots, collective project and even pride.\nBouli Lanners said that his films are the reflection of the Walloon culture but with an American inspiration because we are overflowed by the American culture\nSee also\n* Culture of Belgium\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/manifesto-walloon-culture-1983 Manifesto for Walloon Culture] (September 1983)\n* [http://www.larevuetoudi.org/en/story/second-manifest-2003 Second Walloon Manifesto] (September 2003)\n* [http://www.bruxsel.org/?q=en/appeal We Exist  Brussels Manifesto] (December 2006)\n* [http://www.bruxsel.org/?q=fr/node/355 100 Wallons répondent au Nous existons bruxellois (French, Dutch, German, Walloon)] (May 2007)\n*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HQsHy3eDYI An answer from people of Brussels Alain Maskens at the Assemblée wallonne 29 February 2008 (French)]\n* [http://www.bruxsel.org/fr/node/643 Twenty years Brussels autonomy bruXsel forum  That it is time to assume responsibility and that Brussels should not be joined with either Flanders or Wallonia but should become autonomous and that Belgium should be composed of 3 Regions (...)] (January 2009)"
