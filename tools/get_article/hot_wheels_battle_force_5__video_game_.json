While Hatch tries to open it, the device malfunctions, separating the Battle Force 5, the Vandals, and the Sark. Vert, having been freed from capture early on, must find the rest of his team, reclaim the Infinity Key, and lock down the affected zones to stabilize them.\nGameplay\nThe game features vehicular combat in numerous \"Battle Zones\" with the Sark and Vandals. The gameplay-loop consists of Vert driving along a linear-path to a designated point in the environment, engaging in vehicular combat with enemies, freeing one of his partners, and then using their vehicle in the following level. Each vehicle has a unique ability, such as grenades and four-bladed buzz saws.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.battleforce5.com/ Official website]"
