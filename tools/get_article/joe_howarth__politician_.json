Howarth lost re-election in the 2019 GOP primary. He left office on January 14, 2020.\nEarly life\nA resident of Evesham Township, Howarth received a bachelor's degree from Trenton State College (now The College of New Jersey) with a major in health and physical education. He has worked for the Lenape Regional High School District as a special education paraprofessional.\nBurlington County Politics\nHowarth served on the Board of Education of the Evesham Township School District from 2003 to 2007 and on the Evesham Township Council from 2009 to 2011. He was elected to the Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholders and was sworn into office on January 3, 2012, as part of an all-Republican board. Howarth chose not to run for re-election in 2014 after serving a single term as a freeholder in order to allow himself an opportunity to take care of personal health issues.\nNew Jersey Assembly\nHowarth was elected to the Assembly in November 2015 after Assemblyman Christopher J. Brown announced his retirement.\nIn September 2017, after two-term incumbent Maria Rodriguez-Gregg decided against running for election after an incident earlier that year in which police thought that she was driving under the influence following a traffic accident, the Burlington County Republican Committee chose Burlington County Freeholder Ryan Peters to run for the Assembly seat as Howarth's running mate.\nIn the November 2017 general election, Howarth (with 28,841; 25.1% of all ballots cast) and Peters (with 28,671 votes; 25.0%), defeated Democratic challengers Joanne Schwartz (28,321; 24.7%) and Maryann Merlino (28,196; 24.6%) to win both Assembly seats from the district for the Republicans. With Joanne Schwartz, the closest Democratic candidate 350 votes behind Peters, the Democratic Party had considered filing for a recount.Levinsky, David. [http://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/20171117/republicans-howarth-peters-still-lead-in-8th-district-race-after-provisional-ballot-count Republicans Howarth, Peters still lead in 8th District race after provisional ballot count\"] , Burlington County Times, November 17, 2017; accessed January 19, 2018.\"The official vote count has the incumbent Howarth and Peters, who currently serves as a Burlington County Freeholder, winning the contest for the district Assembly seats with 28,841 and 28,671 votes respectively. Schwartz finished a close third with 28,321 votes — just 350 shy of Peters — followed by Merlino with 28,196. The votes have been counted and Republicans Joe Howarth and Ryan Peters have emerged as the winners of the razor-tight 8th District Assembly race. At least for now. Democrats Joanne Schwartz and Mary Ann Merlino have not ruled out asking for a recount.\" Of all 40 districts, the race in the 8th District was the closest in the state, with 650 votes separating the first and fourth vote-getters.\nAfter the 8th District's Senator Dawn Addiego switched her party affiliation from Republican to Democrat in early 2019, Howarth allegedly attempted to do the same. The Burlington County Republican Party dropped its support for Howarth, choosing to instead support Burlington County Sheriff Jean Stanfield to run with incumbent Ryan Peters.\nIn the primary election where he heavily tied himself to President Donald J. Trump, Howarth was defeated by Stanfield.\nTenure\nThe following Monday after Howarth's defeat, his nameplates were missing from the GOP caucus room, fueling speculation he would switch parties or resign, however neither happened. Later that month, he proposed a bill that would take the pay away from legislators who are absent from a session.\nCommittee assignments\n*Law and Public Safety\n*Tourism, Gaming, and the Arts\nDistrict 8\nNew Jersey's 8th Legislative District encompasses parts of Burlington County, Camden County, and Atlantic County, New Jersey.
