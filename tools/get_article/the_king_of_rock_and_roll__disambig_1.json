It was his second album for Reprise Records. It was rereleased as part of the King of Rock and Roll: The Complete Reprise Recordings set.\nProduction\nThe King of Rock and Roll was produced and arranged by H. B. Barnum. It contains one original Little Richard song, the gospel rock \"In the Name\", and a new song co-written by Barnum, \"Green Power\", the album's single. The rest of the tracks are covers. The title track is a mock braggadocio that references Tom Jones, Elvis Presley, Ike & Tina Turner, Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, among others. The album title and cover art were inspired by Little Richard's image in the early 1970s, when he would often appear in public wearing robes, jewelry, and a crown.\nCritical reception\nThe album received a largely negative review in Rolling Stone, where Vince Aletti stated: \"Much of the album seems designed around the Talk Show Personality rather than the Singer, giving it the sticky veneer of a jive extravaganza.\" Reviewing the album as part of the Reprise collection, The Austin Chronicle deemed it a \"pandering covers concept.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"King of Rock 'n' Roll\" (Bradford Craig, H.B.
