This election was for all of the 122 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 37 single-member constituencies, 24 2-member constituencies, seven 3-member constituencies and four 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult male British subjects, resident in New South Wales. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 7 October 1885 by the Governor, Lord Augustus Loftus, on the advice of the Premier, George Dibbs.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election. Instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system. It became the last election to be organised in such a fashion with the rise of the nascent political parties known as the Protectionist Party and the Free Trade Party that were founded in time to contest the 1887 election, and eventually merged in 1909 to become the first of the parties in the lineage of the modern Liberal Party of Australia.\nDibbs had succeeded Alexander Stuart two weeks before the election was held, and maintained a fragile grip on power after the election until 22 December, when he was defeated by Sir John Robertson.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Instead, this numbers are gathered from the ministerial and opposition benches at the start of Parliament, as well as the results of an 8 December 1885 attempted Vote of no confidence against Premier Dibbs. All candidates stood and were elected as independents and their classification here into groups is intended only to give an easier assessment of the political situation in the colony.\nSee also\n* Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, 1885–1887\n* Candidates of the 1885 New South Wales colonial election"
