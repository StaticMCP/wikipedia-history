Previously, he served as Acting Governor of Aceh from 2004 to 2005 and Vice Governor of Aceh from 2000 to 2004.\nBiography\nAbubakar was born in Banda Aceh, Indonesia on 21 June 1952. He received a bachelor's degree in architecture from the Bandung Institute of Technology, later receiving a master's degree in management from Syiah Kuala University in Aceh. After graduation, he began working as a consultant and entrepreneur. After the resignation of President Suharto in 1998, he became active in politics, co-founding the Aceh branch of the National Mandate Party.\nFrom 2000 to 2004, Abubakar served as the deputy governor of Aceh, later becoming the acting governor from 2004 to 2005 after Governor Abdullah Puteh was convicted of corruption. As acting governor he handled the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, with the amount of civil servants at first thought to have been reduced by almost two-thirds. He also had to deal with the Free Aceh Movement. He ran for governor in 2006 with Prosperous Justice Party member Nasir Djamil as his deputy, but lost to Irwandi Yusuf.\nAbubakar was elected to the People's Representative Council in 2009, representing Aceh. He became a member of Commission I, which oversees defence and foreign affairs. On 19 October 2011, Abubakar replaced EE Mangindaan as the Administrative Reform Minister of Indonesia.\nReception\nDjamil viewed Abubakar's appointment as a way for President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to strengthen his support in Aceh and from the National Mandate Party. Abubakar's appointment as minister was met warmly in Aceh, with several prominent Acehnese calling him \"the best son of Aceh\".\nPersonal life\nAbubakar is married to Mutia Safrila, and together they have four children. According to the Report on Material Wealth of State Figures (Laporan Harta Kekayaan Penyelenggara Negara) published in February 2011, Abubakar has a net worth of over Rp&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;billion (US$150,000), the lowest of the six ministers appointed in October 2011.\nReferences\n;Footnotes\n;Bibliography\n*\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213047/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/11/07/eight-hopefuls-declared-eligible-aceh-gubernatorial-race.html\n|archivedate=4 March 2016\n|df=dmy\n}}\n*\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019150949/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/17/sby-appoints-5-new-ministers-ongoing-reshuffle.html\n|archivedate=19 October 2011\n|df=dmy\n}}\n*\n|url-status=usurped\n|df=dmy\n}}\n*\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111020143405/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/meet-the-six-new-ministerial-candidates/472314\n| archive-date = 20 October 2011\n| url-status = dead\n}}\n*\n| archive-date = 28 October 2011\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111028051332/http://www.tokohindonesia.com/biografi/article/286-direktori/3746-menjulang-setelah-reformasi\n| url-status = dead\n}}\n*\n|work=The Jakarta Post\n|location=Jakarta\n|url=http://images.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/01/07/aceh-bureaucracy-back-action-less-900-employess.html\n|accessdate=1 November 2011\n|ref=\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406173812/http://images.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/01/07/aceh-bureaucracy-back-action-less-900-employess.html\n|archivedate=6 April 2012\n|df=dmy\n}}\n*\n}}\n|years=2004–2005}}"
