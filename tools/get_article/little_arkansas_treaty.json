On October 14 and 18, 1865 the United States and all of the major Plains Indians Tribes signed a treaty on the Little Arkansas River, which became known as the Little Arkansas Treaty. It is notable in that it lasted less than two years, the reservations it created for the Plains Indians were never created at all, and were reduced by 90% eighteen months later in the Medicine Lodge Treaty.\nThe full treaty can be found online.\nThe Civil War\nThe Civil War was ending, and the Union did not want to have to keep hundreds of thousands of men under arms to defend immigrants against Indian attacks. Therefore the government sent highly respected Commissioners to the Plains Tribes, and asked them to meet and talk peace.\nChiefs and Commissioners in attendance\nAmong the Native American Leaders in attendance were Chiefs Black Kettle and Seven Bulls (Cheyenne), Little Raven and Big Mouth (Comanche), Poor Bear, Old Fool Man, and Crow (Apache), Little Raven, and Storm, (Arapaho), Satanta and Satank (Kiowa).   Federal commissioners with great prestige and standing among the Indians were General Harney, Colonel Leavenworth, Kit Carson and William Bent.\n:For the United States, the signatories of the treaty were:\n*John B. Sanborn\n*William S. Harney\n*James Steele\n*William. W. Bent\n*Kit Carson\n*Thomas Murphy\n*Col. J. H.

The Indians demanded unrestricted hunting grounds and reparation for the Chivington massacre of Black Kettle's band. Treaties made here gave the Indians reservations south of the Arkansas, excluded them north to the Platte and proclaimed peace. Several white captives were released, among them a woman and four children from Texas, the Box family, taken by a war party under Satanta.\nThe aftermath\nThis is one of the shortest treaties in history.  None of its major provisions were ever implemented.  Both sides charged violations and warfare continued until the Medicine Lodge treaties of 1867.   There is a monument one mile west of the Little Arkansas River, on the Council Grounds, in Kansas, commemorating the Treaty.\nReferences\n*Cozzens, Peter, ed. (2003).
