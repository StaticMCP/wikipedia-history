The Iraqi government and British administration approved this decision; and a referendum was held to determine the public approval.\nResults\nThe referendum started on 16 July 1921 and ended on 11 August 1921. The results were announced on 19 August 1921 with 96% of the voters approving Faisal as King.\nAftermath\nFaisal was crowned on 23 August 1921. Subsequently, a new Iraqi government was formed by Abdul-Muhsin Al-Saadoun on 20 November 1922, and elections for a constituent assembly were held between 1922 and 1924.\nReferences"
