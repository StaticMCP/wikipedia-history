It has been built to provide expansive and unobstructed corridors around the Meghanad Pacheri, for giving an opportunity to devotees and pilgrims to have better darshan with the temple, Nila Chakra and Meghanad Pacheri, similar to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The project also provides ample facilities and amenities for pilgrims and visitors to give them a hassle-free and memorable experience, and for strengthening the safety and security of the temple and the devotees. It has been constructed at a cost of , and is the core part of the ongoing plan of developing Puri into a world heritage city, to cater to the growing number of footfalls of devotees and visitors. Construction began in November 2021, and was inaugurated by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on 17 January 2024.\nHistory\nThe project was first conceptualized by the Government of Odisha in 2016, after hearing a query from the date cabinet officials about developing a 'heritage corridor' as part of 'Puri Heritage Corridor Project' plan, to modernise the space around the 12th century-temple complex and provide adequate facilities and amenities to pilgrims and visitors for a better and smoother experience. Another reason stated in favour of the project was that it would be crucial for the temple's future, as unlike the other three Dhams, Puri did not have a \"Parikrama Marg\", or a path for circumambulation in a heritage corridor, similar to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. Hence, in 2019, the project was renamed as Shree Mandir Parikrama Project (SMPP), or Shree Jagannath Heritage Corridor (SJHC), to be executed for the beautification of the perimeter of the Jagannath temple.\nIt covers an area of 15.64 acres (6.32 ha), and has been built at an initial cost of , which later decreased to . Apart from the temple project, the state government is spending another , which later increased to , for transforming Puri's heritage and infrastructure, under the Augmentation of Basic Amenities and Development of Heritage and Architecture (ABADHA) scheme. Then, land acquisition for the project began in November 2019, where over 600 people living around the temple gave up 15.64 acres, critical for development of the security zone. It was cleared after a three-bench judgement of the Supreme Court headed by the then Justice of the Court, Arun Kumar Mishra, in November 2019, who suggested that a 75-metre radius around the temple be cleared of all structures for safety, security and improvement of the temple premises. A few months before, between August and September 2019, the Puri district administration had cleared the centuries-old Embar Matha and its Raghunandan Library, along with other buildings deemed as illegal encroachments.\nAfter completion of the land acquisition, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and the incumbent King of the Gajapati Empire and of Puri, as well as the adhyasevak, or the chief servitor of the Jagannath temple, Dibyasingha Deba, laid the foundation stone of the project in November 2021 for the development of the area, within the 75-metre corridor of the boundary wall of the Jagannath temple, to transform it into a pilgrim centre, similar to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in the Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Varanasi.  The project was supposed to begin construction in January 2021, but got delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the issuance of draft by-laws by the National Monuments Authority (NMA) for the temple in the same month, that prohibited any construction work within a 100-metre periphery of the temple, also prohibiting construction within another 200 metres, without the NMA giving nod. However, the by-laws were withdrawn following a request from the Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik. Further roadblocks came in February 2022, when the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) in Puri asked the state government to stop excavating, as it would be a violation of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.\nAs the case landed in the High Court of Odisha, the ASI, in an affidavit, submitted that the archaeological remains of the heritage site may have been destroyed during the excavation, as no heritage impact assessment studies were done before the digging. However, all roadblocks related to this were cleared in September 2022, after the NMA granted a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) for the construction of the reception centre–the most important component of the project, just outside the prohibited zone. In June 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed two Public Interest Litigations (PILs) that challenged the renovation project, calling it \"frivolous litigations\". The project also became a subject of political controversy, claiming that the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government in Odisha would get space for itself to win seats in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections, instead of going through the project and benefitting the people of Puri.\nConstruction began soon after laying down the foundation stone, and witnessed a few slowdowns due to the objections mentioned above. It continued, and the date for the corridor's inauguration was set for January 2024 in November 2023. All structural works were completed by the first week of January 2024, after an inspection by state government officials was conducted on 6 January 2024. The project was inaugurated and opened to the public by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and King Dibyasingha Deba on 17 January 2024.\nDescription\nThe 75 metre-long corridor of the SJHC surrounding the Meghanad Pacheri is broadly divided into nine zones on the northern, southern and western side.
