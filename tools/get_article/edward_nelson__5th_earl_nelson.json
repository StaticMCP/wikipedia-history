He was known as The Hon. Edward Nelson for almost all of his life, up until he became Earl Nelson in September 1947. He married Geraldine Haddon Cave in 1889 and with her had eight children:\n* Albert Francis Joseph Horatio Nelson, 6th Earl Nelson\n* Henry Edward Joseph Horatio Nelson, 7th Earl Nelson\n* Lt.-Col.

He inherited Trafalgar Park in 1947 and sold it in 1948 as a result of the loss of the government pension attached to his title and Death Duties imposed on the estate following the death of his brother.\nLord Nelson died in London in January 1951 aged 90, and on his death the title passed to his son Albert Nelson. Edward had only been Earl Nelson for three years and four months exactly at the time of his death.\nReferences"
