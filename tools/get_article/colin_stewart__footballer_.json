He is currently goalkeeping coach for  club Liverpool.\nStewart gained one U21 international cap for Scotland.\nEarly life\nStewart is the son of former Scotland goalkeeper Jim Stewart. Stewart was born in England when his father was playing for Middlesbrough. The Stewarts returned to Scotland later on that year, when Jim signed for Rangers.\nPlaying career\nClub\nStewart started his career with Scottish Premier League club Kilmarnock, but could not win the place as their starting goalkeeper. He was loaned out to a number of lower division clubs, namely Clydebank, Alloa Athletic, Queen's Park and Hamilton Academical. Since 2003 he has played more regularly, mainly at the First Division level. Stewart was first choice goalkeeper throughout the second half of season 2006–07 for First Division side Livingston, where he played the last dozen or so games after ousting Mariusz Liberda from the number one jersey. After being released by Livingston's new owners, Stewart signed for Division One rivals Morton in May 2008.\nStewart was originally expected to be the first choice goalkeeper for season 2008–09, however after a shaky début against Clyde at Broadwood on 2 August 2008, he was dropped for the former St Johnstone goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert, who was listed as a trialist on the substitutes bench for that game. After this he spent most of his début season in the stand, with manager Davie Irons preferring to list youth players Kieran Cannon and Ryan McWilliams as the back-up goalkeepers to Cuthbert. Despite having a year left on his contract with Morton, he was told in May 2009 that he was free to find another club.\nSince then he turned himself into the club's first choice goalkeeper, and signed a new contract in June 2010. He was released by the club in May 2012 and claimed that the signing of Alan Combe in March, after he sustained a broken toe, forced him to leave the club to find regular football elsewhere.\nStewart became a goalkeeping coach in Qatar, with Al-Khor Sports Club in August 2013. Stewart returned to Scotland during February 2013, playing three trial matches for Stranraer before signing for Cowdenbeath. After leaving Central Park, Stewart signed for Airdrieonians after a free transfer on 8 June 2013 and signed a one-year contract. On 27 August 2013, after the club's League Cup second round defeat at home to Livingston, Stewart had to be restrained by stewards as he argued with a fan as he headed up the tunnel at full-time. On 30 August 2013, Stewart departed the club by mutual consent.\nOn 9 November 2013, it was announced that Stewart had signed for Raith Rovers.\nInternational\nStewart made one appearance for the Scotland u21 side keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory over Latvia. Stewart now coaches the goalkeepers for the Scotland U15 side.\nCoaching career\nStewart was appointed as co-manager of Junior club Kilwinning Rangers in February 2014 alongside former Queen of the South and Ayr United player Chris Strain.\nStewart joined the Rangers F.C. Academy becoming the head of academy goalkeeping, before being promoted to first-team goalkeeping coach by Graeme Murty in 2017.\nIn July 2025, Stewart left Rangers to take up the role of goalkeeper development and pathway lead with Liverpool.\nPersonal life\nStewart is married to women's football star Julie Fleeting. They have three daughters named Ella, Sophia and Matilda.\nSee also\n*Greenock Morton F.C. season 2008–09 | 2009–10 | 2010–11 | 2011–12\n*Stranraer F.C. season 2012–13\n*Cowdenbeath F.C. season 2012-13\n*Raith Rovers F.C. season 2013–14\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/mens/staff/colin-stewart Profile] at the Liverpool F.C. website\n*"
