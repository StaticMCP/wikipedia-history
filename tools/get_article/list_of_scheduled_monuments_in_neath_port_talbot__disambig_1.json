The 93 scheduled monuments include 43 prehistoric sites which include a stone circle, standing stones, burial mounds and chambered tombs. The six Roman sites are all connected to military occupation. There are 18 medieval sites which include abbeys, castles and churches. The  26 post-medieval sites are mostly connected to over 400 years of industrial activity in the area. All of the sites on this list (and the whole of Neath Port Talbot County Borough) are within the historic county of Glamorgan. Five of the sites lie on or cross the border into neighbouring counties, and are included on both lists.\nScheduled monuments have statutory protection. It is illegal to disturb the ground surface or any standing remains. The compilation of the list is undertaken by Cadw Welsh Historic Monuments, which is an executive agency of the National Assembly of Wales. The list of scheduled monuments below is supplied by Cadw with additional material from RCAHMW and Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust.\nScheduled monuments in Neath Port Talbot\n{| class=\" wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:101%; margin-right:0; margin-left:0\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!scope=\"col\" |Name\n!scope=\"col\" |Site type\n!scope=\"col\" |Community\n!scope=\"col\"|Location\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Details\n!scope=\"col\" |Period\n!scope=\"col\" |SAM No& Refs\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Craig Ty-Isaf Camp\n|Hillfort\n|Baglan\n|, SS756933\n|One of three hillforts on Mynydd-y-Gaer.

An open stone-lined cist 2.1 m long is in the centre. It was first noted in 1695 in William Camden's Britannia. It may once have had a mound, but it is more likely it was always a ring cairn, a raised ring with its central area at ground level.
