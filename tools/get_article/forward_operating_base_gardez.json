In mid-August 2011, a truck packed with explosives detonated at the entrance, killing two Afghan guards but otherwise doing minimal damage to the base. The Taliban, however, made spurious claims of massive casualties and destroyed helicopters.\nColonel Burke Garrett published a letter in the Fort Drum Blizzard in which he described the living conditions at the Gardez Fire Base, and its neighboring bases:\nFOB Gardez was closed in November 2014 by the 319th Movement Control Team from Dover, Delaware (Army Reserve). The FOB was run by the 101st Airborne Division, 1st/506 Infantry Easy Co. (Band of Brothers).\nCustodial death of Jamal Nasser\nJamal Nasser, an Afghan militia soldier in United States' custody, died at Gardez Fire Base on March 16, 2003.\nNasser, 18-year-old Afghan militia soldier was captured with seven other militiamen in March 2003. Members of the Green Beret team who captured Nasser and his comrades were under investigation because it was alleged that they hid his death, colluded and falsified their reports.\nIn 2004, eighteen months after his death, when Nasser's death in custody was brought to the attention of American headquarters, his death was attributed to a kidney infection.\nCBS News reported, on September 21, 2004, that former Paktia Governor Raz Mohammed Dalili confirmed that he had requested a Green Beret officer named \"Mike\" to apprehend militia soldiers who were conducting illegal roadblocks, on the Khost-Gardez highway, and extorting money from travelers. CBS News identified Dalili as the current Governor of Wardak Province.\nLater, an investigation determined that the account of death by natural causes was the result of collusion among the GIs in the Special Forces unit who had custody of Nasser when he died. After a two-year investigation, no one was held responsible for his death.  Reprimands were filed in the dossiers of several GIs for the failure to report his death.\nSee also\n*Jamal Nasser\n*Sayed Nabi Siddiqui\n* Gardez Air Base\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-sep-24-na-torture24-story.html A Silence in the Afghan Mountains] Los Angeles Times 24 September 2006\n* [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-sep-25-na-torture25-story.html Two Deaths Were a `Clue That Something's Wrong'] Los Angeles Times 25 September 2006"
