      "text": "# Intersex Awareness Day\n\nIntersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed awareness day each October 26, designed to highlight human rights issues faced by intersex people.\nHistory\nThe event marks the first public demonstration by intersex people in North America, on October 26, 1996, outside the venue in Boston where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. Intersex activists Morgan Holmes and Max Beck participated for the (now-defunct) Intersex Society of North America, alongside allies from Transsexual Menace including Riki Wilchins. Holmes has written that the event was intended not as a demonstration but as participation in the conference. She states that Beck and Holmes had intended to deliver an address, \"on long-term outcomes and to challenge their still-prevailing opinion that cosmetic surgery to \"fix\" intersexed genitals was the best course of action\", but were \"met, officially, with hostility and were escorted out of the conference by security guards\". The group only later demonstrated, carrying a sign saying \"Hermaphrodites With Attitude\".\nThe commemoration day itself began in 2003 with the establishment of a central awareness raising site by Betsy Driver and Emi Koyama. A central awareness raising site was later re-established in 2015 by Morgan Carpenter with Laura Inter of Brújula Intersexual, and support from Open Society Foundations.\nObservance\nIntersex Awareness Day is an international day of grass-roots action to end shame, secrecy and unwanted genital cosmetic surgeries on intersex children. The day also provides an opportunity for reflection and political action. Between October 26 and November 8, intersex organizations bring attention to the challenges intersex individuals face, culminating in the Intersex Day of Remembrance on November 8, the birthday of Herculine Barbin, also sometimes known as Intersex Solidarity Day.\nNotable observances\n2013\nOn Friday 25 October 2013, the day before Intersex Awareness Day that year, the Australian Senate published a report on an inquiry titled the Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia.
