These were then replaced by the Lockheed Hudson.\nA meteorological observation unit No. 405 Flight of Bomber Command was set up as part of the effort to gain important weather information.  When Coastal Command took over all the meteorological units this became No. 1401 (Met) Flight and received a greater variety of aircraft.  As well as Blenheims it operated Spitfires, Gloster Gladiator biplanes and Hawker Hurricanes. These aircraft were all used to take measurements of temperature and humidity; from 40,000&nbsp;ft downwards in precise areas. In August 1942 the Flight was made into a Squadron – No. 521 – with Hudsons, Handley Page Hampdens, de Havilland Mosquitos and Lockheed Venturas. The squadron's Mosquitos would operate deep into occupied Europe to take measurements over target areas; known as \"PAMPA\". In 1944 the squadron moved to the other satellite for Bircham Newton, RAF Langham\nPosted units\nThe following squadrons were here at some point:\n;Units:\n* No. 27 Air Crew Holding Unit RAF\n* No. 401 Meteorological Flight RAF (October 1941 – ?)\n* No. 1401 Meteorological Flight RAF (August – September 1943)\n* No. 1525 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF (July 1942 – ?)\n* No. 1693 (General Reconnaissance) Flight RAF (May 1945)\n* No. 2731 Squadron RAF Regiment\n* No. 2749 Squadron RAF Regiment\n* No. 2765 Squadron RAF Regiment\n* Air Sea Rescue Training Unit RAF (October 1943)\n* Warwick Training Unit RAF (June – July 1943)\n}}\nCurrent use\nThe site has reverted to farmland.\nSee also\n*List of former Royal Air Force stations\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*Norfolk Airfields in the Second World War Graham Smith, Countryside Books, 1997.\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.controltowers.co.uk/D/Docking.htm Control Towers – RAF Docking]\n*[http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20081010080735/http://airfieldarchaeology.fotopic.net/c1480866.html Airfield Archeology – RAF Docking]\n*[http://www.rafbnmp.org.uk/langham.htm Bircham Newton Memorial Project]"
