Incumbent Héctor Trujillo was the only candidate in the presidential election, and was unopposed for a second term. However, his predecessor and brother Rafael Trujillo, the country's de facto leader since 1930, maintained absolute control of the country. The Dominican Party won every seat in the Congressional elections. Notably, the previous foreign minister and diplomat Joaquin Balaguer was chosen as Vice President, which would usher in his near-quarter of a century in the presidency (longer than Trujillo himself).\nThese would be the last elections held under Trujillo's three-decade rule. In 1960 Héctor Trujillo stood down in favor of Vice President Balaguer. Rafael Trujillo was assassinated a year later in 1961. His son, Ramfis, seized power, but only survived for five months before being forced out in November by Balaguer, clearing the way for the country's first free elections in 1962.\nResults\nReferences"
