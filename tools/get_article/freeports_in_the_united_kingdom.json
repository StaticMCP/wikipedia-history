The theoretical purpose of such freeports is to encourage economic activity in the surrounding area and increase manufacturing. Critics of such schemes, including the parliamentary opposition, see them as possible tax havens and open to money laundering.\nGoods imported into freeports do not incur usual import procedures on entry and re-exit. Import duties are not payable until the goods are put into free circulation or used within the free zone.\nThe first freeport in the United Kingdom opened in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, as an attempt to combat de-industrialisation and a declining economy. Several freeports operated throughout the United Kingdom, but by 2012 the Conservative-led government decided not to renew their licences.\nDuring the 2021 United Kingdom budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak announced the first eight new freeports would be created.\nHistory\nIn their 1983 manifesto, The Challenge of Our Times, the Conservative government outlined its plans to establish 'experimental' freeports as a part of its regional policies to modernise the British economy following the early 1980s recession. After winning a second term at the general election Margaret Thatcher's government assigned freeport status to six areas; namely Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Southampton. These freeports experienced limited success during their lifetime and by 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron decided not to renew the freeport licences. Teesside MP Simon Clarke blamed the failed experiment on \"an uncharacteristic lack of ambition by the Thatcher Government\" and \"the regulatory constraints placed on them by the EU\".\n21st century\nIn 2016, the then backbench MP—and later Chancellor of the Exchequer—Rishi Sunak published a white paper for the Centre for Policy Studies outlining his ideas for post-Brexit freeports similar to those in the United States. The paper titled The Free Ports Opportunity suggested that creation of such ports could create 86,000 jobs and help fuel the Northern Powerhouse by bringing increased trade to deprived areas. After the Conservative Party's victory in the 2019 general election, plans were announced for ten freeports to be set up by 2021 with regions bidding for free status. Up to 40 bids for freeport status were received during the process.\nAs part of the 2021 United Kingdom budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced that eight new freeports would be created in England. They are East Midlands Airport, Felixstowe and Harwich, Humber region, Liverpool City Region, Plymouth, Solent, Thames and Teesside.\nThe UK government named three aims behind creating freeports, promoting regeneration and job creation, creating a hub for global trade and to create a hotbed for innovation.\nOther devolved governments within the United Kingdom were invited to establish freeports, one or two each. The Scottish government announced plans for so called sustainable \"green ports\", the Welsh government said it would continue, providing it received the same level of funding as England and the Northern Ireland Executive said it was working with the HM Treasury to implement its own site.\nIn October 2024, the Keir Starmer Labour government announced official clearance for five existing freeports to have customs sites, which is needed to class them as operational.\nList of UK Freeports\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Location\n!Port(s) and customs sites\n!Country\n!Operational\n!Note\n!Website\n|-\n|Anglesey Freeport  Porthladd Rhydd Ynys Môn\n|Holyhead, Anglesey Prosperity Zone, Rhosgoch, M-Sparc\n|\n|pending\n|\n|[https://angleseyfreeport.co.uk/home-e/]\n|-\n|Celtic Freeport  Porthladd Rhydd Celtaidd\n|Milford Haven and Port Talbot\n|\n|pending\n|\n|[https://www.celticfreeport.wales/EN/pages]\n|-\n|East Midlands Freeport\n|East Midlands Airport\n|\n|April 2023\n|\n|[https://www.emfreeport.com]\n|-\n|Forth Green Freeport\n|Grangemouth, Rosyth and Leith ports, Edinburgh Airport, Burntisland\n|\n|pending\n|\n|[https://forthgreenfreeport.com]\n|->\n|Freeport East\n|Port of Felixstowe, Harwich International Port\n|\n| January 2023\n|\n|[https://freeporteast.com]\n|-\n|Humber Freeport\n|Port of Immingham, Port of Hull, Port of Grimsby, Goole\n|\n|pending\n|\n|[https://humberfreeport.org]\n|-\n|Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport\n|Inverness, Cromarty Firth, Nigg and Inverness Airport.\n|\n|pending\n|\n|[https://greenfreeport.scot]\n|-\n|Liverpool City Region Freeport\n|Liverpool Waters, Wirral Waters\n|\n|January 2023\n|\n|\n|-\n|Plymouth and South Devon Freeport\n|Devonport\n|\n|December 2022\n|\n|[https://pasdfreeport.com]\n|-\n|Solent Freeport\n|Port of Southampton, Southampton Airport, Portsmouth International Port\n|\n|December 2022\n|\n|[https://solentfreeport.com]\n|-\n|Teesside Freeport\n|Teesport, Hartlepool, Teesside Airport\n|\n|December 2022\n|\n|[https://www.teessidefreeport.com]\n|-\n|Thames Freeport\n|London Gateway, Port of Tilbury, Ford Dagenham\n|\n|March 2023\n|\n|[https://thamesfreeport.com/ ]\n|-\n|}\nRules regarding freeports\n* Maximum of 45 km in diameter.\n* Freeports receive up to £25 million initial seed funding.\n* Each Freeport has a number of sites, which may have different tax rules and are limited to 6 km2 per Freeport.\n* Each Freeport will contain between one and three tax and customs locations.\n* Temporary tax incentives to encourage investment\n** Stamp Duty Land Tax relief in England until March 2026.\n** Enhanced capital allowances until 30 September 2026.\n** Employment tax incentives and National Insurance Contributions reliefs on low paid employees, until April 2026.\n** Business rates relief for 5 years.\n* Allow certain specific developments without requiring planning permission, the same permitted development rights as those available to airports.\n* Simplified import and export procedures.\n* Deferrals and exemptions from duty payments\n* VAT suspension within customs site\nCriticism\nProposal for freeports in the United Kingdom have been heavily criticised by opposition parties, trade unions, think tanks and various economists. Reasons for this include the possibility for use as tax havens, smuggling and a way to erode worker's rights.\nDespite claims of a cross party consensus, Labour Party members showed opposition to the idea with a speaker at a Labour conference describing them as \"job-destroying\". Further to this, Labour party leader Keir Starmer called it \"giving up\" and \"blind faith\". Former Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell suggested it to be '\"a revival of a failed Thatcherite plan from the 1980s, designed to cut away at regulation and our tax base.\"\nAt a Liberal Democrat conference in 2019, members passed a motion for the abolition of freeports due to the increased risk of money-laundering and tax evasion. Similarly the then Home Affairs spokesperson—and later leader— Sir Ed Davey suggested the UK could become the world capital of money laundering.\nIn Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) was sceptical, with trade minister Ivan McKee calling them a \"shiny squirrel\" to distract from the consequences of Brexit. adding \"the reputation of freeports across the world is mixed, with concerns about deregulation and risks of criminality, tax evasion and reductions in workers’ rights\". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also raised concern over them being \"low-cost, low-wage, low-value opportunities\".  Despite these remarks, in 2021 the SNP announced its own version of freeports, called 'green ports', which they say will adopt \"best practice which helps deliver our net-zero emissions and fair work principles, alongside supporting regeneration and innovation ambitions\".\nFreeport developments\nEast Midlands Freeport\nAn inland Freeport, comprising 533 hectares at three sites, East Midlands Airport, East Midlands Intermodal Park and the Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station redevelopment site.
