The conflict was rooted in religious and geopolitical tensions, as the Shia Qajar state sought to counter the expansion of the Sunni Wahhabi Emirate, which had gained influence across the Persian Gulf and parts of southern Iran. The war involved multiple battles, shifting alliances, and culminated in a diplomatic resolution that reshaped regional power dynamics.\nBackground\nThe Wahhabi movement, founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab in the 18th century, aimed to purify Islamic practice and gained political backing from the House of Saud. By the early 1800s, Wahhabi forces had expanded into eastern Arabia, threatening Persian Gulf territories and challenging Ottoman and Qajar authority.\nThe Qajar dynasty, under Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, viewed Wahhabi expansion as both a religious threat and a strategic challenge. The Qajars sought to assert control over coastal regions such as Bushire, Qatif, and Bahrain, which had come under Wahhabi influence. The conflict also drew in regional powers including the Omani Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire, each with vested interests in Gulf stability.\nMilitary Campaigns\nWahhabi Raids and Early Qajar Defeats (1808–1809)\nWahhabi-aligned tribes launched raids into Qajar-controlled coastal areas, defeating Persian forces in several engagements. The Qajars suffered setbacks in Bushire and Qatif, prompting a military response.\nDiriyah Campaign (1810–1811)\nLed by Sadiq Khan Qajar, Persian forces advanced into central Arabia and sacked Diriyah, the Wahhabi stronghold. Wahhabi commanders Saif bin Malik and Muhammad bin Saif were wounded, and the city was briefly held before Persian forces withdrew.\nBattle of Manama (1811)\nPersian attempts to control Bahrain were met with resistance. Wahhabi forces regrouped and defeated Persian troops near Manama, forcing a withdrawal and reasserting Wahhabi influence.\nNaval Engagements and Coastal Skirmishes\nIn 1809, the Qajar fleet was defeated by Wahhabi-aligned Qasimi naval forces near Bushire. Later, in 1815, Omani forces allied with the Qajars sacked Wahhabi quarters in Bushire, retaliating for earlier raids.\nDiplomacy and Resolution\nIn late 1811, Emir Saud ibn Abdulaziz sent envoys to Shiraz, demanding assurances that Qajar Iran would cease support for Oman against Wahhabi forces. The Qajar court agreed, and Persian troops were withdrawn from Oman. This diplomatic victory solidified Wahhabi dominance in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and marked the end of major hostilities.\nAftermath\nAlthough the Qajars achieved temporary military successes, the Wahhabis retained influence in Arabia and Oman. The conflict deepened sectarian divides and set the stage for future tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The war also highlighted the strategic importance of Gulf alliances and the role of external powers in shaping regional outcomes.\nKey Figures\n*  Fath-Ali Shah Qajar – Ruler of Iran\n*  Sadiq Khan Qajar – Persian military commander\n*  Muhammad Ali Mirza – Qajar prince\n*  Saud ibn Abdulaziz – Wahhabi leader\n* [[File:Flag_of_the_First_and_Second_Saudi_State_(174"
