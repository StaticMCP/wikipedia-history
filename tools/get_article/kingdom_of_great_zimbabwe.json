Its capital was Great Zimbabwe, the largest stone structure in precolonial Southern Africa, which had a population of 10,000. Around 1300, Great Zimbabwe replaced Mapungubwe as the most important trading centre in the interior, exporting gold via Swahili city-states into the Indian Ocean trade.  At Great Zimbabwe's centre was the Great Enclosure which is thought to have housed royalty and had demarcated spaces for rituals, while commoners surrounded them within the second perimeter wall.  The Zimbabwe state was composed of over 150 smaller zimbabwes and likely covered .\nIt is unknown what caused Great Zimbabwe's decline and migration of the Shona to other places from the 15th century, however land depletion or a depletion of critical resources, increased regional competition, shifting trade routes, and overpopulation likely played a role. By the 16th century, the Mutapa Empire and the Kingdom of Butua centred on Khami had replaced Great Zimbabwe as the major powers in the region. Great Zimbabwe likely continued to be inhabited into the 17th century, before it was eventually abandoned.\nEtymology\nThe Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe derives its name from its capital, Great Zimbabwe. The name \"dzimbabwe\" is Shona for \"great house of stone\", from the nouns 'dzimba-' meaning \"great house\" and 'ibwe' meaning \"-stone\". \"Zimbabwe\" derives from Zimba-ra-mabwe or Zimba-re-mabwe, translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as \"houses of stones\" (dzimba = augmentative noun of imba, \"house\"; mabwe = plural of ibwe, \"stone\"; ra/re = preposition for of).\nHistory\nOrigins and rise\nThe region had been inhabited by the San dating back over 100,000 years,}} and was inhabited by Bantu-speaking peoples from 150 BC, who from the 4th century AD formed various agricultural chiefdoms. An early settlement and predecessor was Gumanye. The site of what would become Great Zimbabwe had been occupied since 1000 by speakers of proto-Karanga (south-central Shona).}} The settlement lay on the margins of mainstream developments occurring to its south from the 10th century in the Limpopo-Shashe Basin, where states and chiefdoms competed over gold and other goods for the Indian Ocean trade. In the 13th century Great Zimbabwe was on the fringe of the Mapungubwe state.\nFrom the 12th century, Great Zimbabwe wrestled with other settlements, such as Chivowa, for economic and political dominance in the Southern Zambezi Escarpment. Agriculture and cattle played a key role in developing a vital social network, and served to \"enfranchise management of goods and services distributed as benefits within traditional political and social institutions\", while long distance trade was crucial for the transformation of localised organisations into regional ones. This process rapidly advanced during the 13th century, which saw large dry masonry stone walls raised, and by 1250 Great Zimbabwe had become an important trade centre. Gold production increased rapidly during this time. By 1300, trade routes had shifted north as merchants bypassed the Limpopo and Mapungubwe by travelling the Save River into the gold-producing interior, precipitating Mapungubwe's rapid decline and the dominance of Great Zimbabwe.\nApogee\nAt its peak Great Zimbabwe covered  and became a centre for industry and political power. At Great Zimbabwe's centre was the Great Enclosure which housed royalty and had demarcated spaces for rituals. Commoners surrounded them within the second perimeter wall, and its population was around 10,000. Great Zimbabwe dominated trade routes despite not directly controlling village-based mining and smelting, and engaged in the Indian Ocean trade via Swahili city-states such as Sofala. The state was composed of over 150 smaller zimbabwes, and likely covered . Stone structures were built around the north-eastern plateau, likely provincial outposts controlling areas of gold production. The institutionalisation of Great Zimbabwe's politico-religious ideology served to legitimise the position of the king (mambo), with a link between leaders, their ancestors, and God. Ken Mufuka writes that the shrine in the Hill Complex was the home of spirit mediums (svikiro) who were tasked with acting as the conscience of the state, and preserving the traditions of the founders, reported to be Chigwagu Rusvingo (the first mambo), Chaminuka, Chimurenga, Tovera, and Soro-rezhou among others. The community incorporated dhaka pits into a complex water management system.\nIt is unclear to what extent coercion and conflict played in Great Zimbabwe's growth and dominance due to this being challenging to recognise archaeologically. While the Great Enclosure served to display prestige and status, and to reinforce inequalities between elites and commoners, it likely also served to deter contestation for political power amid the close linkage between wealth accumulation and political authority, with rivals for power, such as district chiefs and regional governors, located outside the settlement in prestige enclosures. The perimeter walls also likely served a defensive purpose, indicating warfare was conventional.\nDecline\nIt is unknown what caused Great Zimbabwe's demise and its eventual abandonment. It is unclear to what extent climate change played a role, however Great Zimbabwe's location in a favourable rainfall zone makes this unlikely to have been a primary cause. Great Zimbabwe's dominance over the region depended on its continual extension and projection of influence, as its growing population needed more farming land and traders more gold. Shona oral tradition attributes Great Zimbabwe's demise to a salt shortage, which may be a figurative way of speaking of land depletion for agriculturalists or of the depletion of critical resources for the community. It is plausible the aquifer Great Zimbabwe sat on top of ran out of water, or the growing population contaminated the water.\nFrom the early 15th century, international trade began to decline amid a global economic downturn, reducing demand for gold, which adversely affected Great Zimbabwe. In response to this, elites possibly expanded regional trading networks, resulting in greater prosperity for other settlements in the region. By the late 15th century, the consequences of this decision would have begun to manifest, as offshoots from Great Zimbabwe's royal family formed new dynasties, possibly as a result of losing succession disputes. According to oral tradition, Nyatsimba Mutota, a member of Great Zimbabwe's royal family, led part of the population north in search for salt to found the Mutapa Empire.}} It was believed that only their most recent ancestors would follow them, with older ancestors staying at Great Zimbabwe and providing protection there. Angoche traders opened a new route along the Zambezi via Mutapa and Ingombe Ilede to reach the goldfields west of Great Zimbabwe, precipitating its decline and the rise of Khami, the capital of the Kingdom of Butua. By the 16th century, political and economic power had shifted away from Great Zimbabwe to the north and west. The site likely continued to be inhabited into the 17th century, before it was eventually abandoned.\nGovernment\nThe social institution had a mambo as its sacred leader, aided by a designated brother or sister, along with an increasingly rigid three-tiered class structure. The kingdom taxed other rulers throughout the region, and was composed of over 150 tributaries headquartered in their own minor zimbabwes.\nSociety and culture\nGreat Zimbabwe was likely a centre for crafts and a place of great religious significance, however, unlike at Mapungubwe, rainmaking centres and cults were kept distant from the centre of power, and it was often entrusted to native members of particular regions. There was a mystical relationship between leaders and the land, and a link between leaders, their ancestors, and God. The ''mambo's first wife held authority over his other wives. Royalty initially lived at the Eastern and Western enclosures, with archaeological research uncovering ritual spears, gongs, and soapstone bird effigies. The public surrounded them until the space became too limited for the growing population and the royalty moved to the Great Enclosure, constructed throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. The Great Enclosure partitioned domestic and public spaces, the latter likely used for rituals. Similar to Venda tradition (who diverged from the Shona in the 17th century), the Great Enclosure could have been used for circumcision rites and served as a pre-marital school for girls and boys, called Domba''.\nNobles resolved disputes in a private court, while commoners resolved them in public. Common homes were built out of mud on wooden frame structures. Exotic goods found in the kingdom's region acquired local meanings in rituals, aesthetics, and status, such as Persian earthenware bowls and Chinese celadon. Metalworking and iron bloomery were in the domain of men. As the spiritual home of the Mutapa dynasty, in the 16th century the Mutapa king kept some wives at Great Zimbabwe, which served as the site for the masungiro ritual, involving the parents of both wife and husband.\nEconomy\nThe Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe had a mosaic political economy which embedded production and circulation to address needs at individual, household, village, district, capital, and state levels within a multidimensional environment dependent on local qualities. This system later incorporated global trade, however imports were relatively  minimal, and it was not solely responsible for the region's economic development.\nGreat Zimbabwe's wealth was derived from cattle rearing, agriculture, and the domination of trade routes from the goldfields of the Zimbabwean Plateau to the Swahili coast. Cattle was important to the elites in the kingdom since their wealth came from the management of cattle. The large cattle herd that supplied the city moved seasonally and was managed by the court. Salt, cattle, grain, and copper were traded as far north as the Kundelungu Plateau in present-day DR Congo. They had extensive regional and long-distance trading networks with central Africa, the Swahili coast, the Persian Gulf, India, and the Far East. Trade routes shifting north from the Save River, which linked Great Zimbabwe to Sofala, to the Zambezi, which linked Khami to Ingombe Ilede, Mutapa, Angoche, and Quelimane, likely contributed to Great Zimbabwe's demise.\nStone masonry\nThe rulers of the Zimbabwe Kingdom (known as mambo) cultivated and expanded dry-stone masonry traditions that developed across the Zambezi and Limpopo basins and are also evidenced at sites such as Mapungubwe. Skilled builders used locally available granite, which naturally fractures into regular blocks when heated and cooled, to construct terraces, enclosures, platforms, and free-standing walls without mortar. These techniques evolved from earlier Iron Age settlements in the region and reached their highest architectural expression at Great Zimbabwe during the 13th–15th centuries.\nDry-stone structures in the Zimbabwe tradition were built using a combination of coursed granite blocks, careful interlocking, and gravity-based stability. Distinct regional styles emerged, including coursed masonry, polygonal masonry, and chequered or herringbone motifs, which were both decorative and functional. Large walls such as the Great Enclosure and the Hill Complex demonstrate advanced understanding of load distribution, battering angles, and the thermal properties of granite.\nStone-building was closely connected to political authority, ritual landscapes, and long-distance trade. Platforms and walled enclosures served as elite residences, administrative spaces, and ritual areas, while the distribution of stone sites across the plateau reflects patterns of political control and economic networks within the Zimbabwe Kingdom.\nKnowledge of dry-stone construction continued in the later capitals of Khami and Danamombe, incorporating new styles such as decorated retaining walls and terraced platforms. However, by the 19th century, the practice had largely declined as political centers shifted and new building materials were adopted. Despite its importance, traditional knowledge of stone masonry was not systematically documented until the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Efforts by researchers, heritage authorities, and universities in Zimbabwe, including the National University of Science and Technology (NUST), the University of Zimbabwe, and Great Zimbabwe University, are now working to record indigenous building techniques and conservation knowledge to support heritage preservation.\nHistoriography and the site\nEuropean antiquarians looted and pillaged Great Zimbabwe and similar structures from the 1890s to 1920s, greatly inhibiting the work of future archaeologists. Mired in racial prejudice, Rhodesians found it inconceivable that the structures could have been built be indigenous Africans, stipulating that archaeological discoveries of Persian bowls and Chinese celadon were the result of pre-Bantu settlement. The colonial government pressured archaeologists to deny that the structure was built by indigenous Africans, and the refutation of various fantastical and dehumanising theories ascribing the construction to Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians, and anyone but the Shona, along with other activities of the antiquarians, dominated the historiography of Great Zimbabwe throughout the 20th century. Its African origin only became consensus by the 1950s.\nLocal narratives, despite each clan claiming the site of Great Zimbabwe, are very similar in lamenting both the European antiquarians and the professional archaeologists for desecrating and appropriating a sacred site. They hold the government responsible for the \"silence\" and \"closure\" of Great Zimbabwe due to their refusal to \"acknowledge the ownership and control of the site by the ancestors and Mwari\".\nRulers\nThe following is a list of Mambo (also called Mwene-Mutapa) of the Zimbabwe Kingdom according to Mhare Yenhaka, a Zimbabwean historian.\n# Kutamadzoka Chaminuka (Mutapa I, capital at Wedza)\n# Chingwangu Rusvingo (Mutapa II, moved the capital to Great Zimbabwe)\n# Chidyamatamba\n# Chimedzamabwe\n# Mombemuriwo\n# Mavhudzi (Chibatamtosi)\n# Kangambeu-Kurima-Kwakona (Dyambeu)\n# Nyatsimba Mutota (he would later moved to establish the Mutapa Kingdom)\n# Munembire Mudadi\nSee also\n*Kingdom of Butua\n*Kingdom of Mutapa\n*Khami\n*Danan'ombe\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
