The award, named in honor of James Naismith's daughter-in-law, was established for men in 1969 and for women in 1984. The men's award was presented to the nation's most outstanding senior who stands 6&nbsp;ft 0&nbsp;in (1.83&nbsp;m) or shorter, while the women's award was presented to the top senior who is 5&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in (1.73&nbsp;m) or shorter. Early in the women's award's history, the cut-off height was . The men's award was selected by a panel from the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), while the women's was selected by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA). The award was discontinued  following the 2013–14 season.\nBoth the men's and women's winners were generally players in NCAA Division I. For the men's side, John Rinka from Kenyon College&nbsp;(1970), Mike Scheib from Susquehanna University&nbsp;(1978) and Jerry Johnson from Florida Southern College (1988) won from NCAA Divisions II, III, and II, respectively. For the women's winners, Julie Dabrowski of New Hampshire College (now Southern New Hampshire University)&nbsp;(1990) and Amy Dodrill&nbsp;(1995) and Angie Arnold&nbsp;(1998), both from Johns Hopkins University, were also winners from Division III.\nOnly three schools from the list of men's winners (Louisville, St. John's and UCLA) and six schools from the list of women's winners (Baylor, Gonzaga, Johns Hopkins, Notre Dame, Penn State, and UConn) had multiple award winners. Of these programs, the only one with winners in consecutive seasons is the Louisville men's program (Peyton Siva in 2013 and Russ Smith in 2014). Six other schools have had winners of both the men's and women's awards: California, Eastern Michigan, NC State, Purdue, Virginia, and Wake Forest.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Awarded a national player of the year award: Men – Sporting News; Oscar Robertson Trophy; Associated Press; NABC; UPI; Naismith; Wooden; Adolph Rupp Trophy; Helms FoundationWomen – Wade; Associated Press; Naismith; Wooden\n|}\nWinners\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"\n|+ Men\n!
