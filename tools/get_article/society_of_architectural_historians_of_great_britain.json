The Society has no official location and its activities cover the United Kingdom. The Society also represents the interests of UK architectural history to governmental and non-governmental bodies within the education and heritage fields. The Society specifically avoids conservation issues.\nArchitectural History is the main journal of the society. It is published each autumn and members of SAHBG receive a copy. There is also a newsletter for members. The society also published five research registers.\nHistory\nThe foundation of the Society was prompted in 1955 by Turpin Bannister in discussion with Frank Jenkins, a British architect and scholar who worked with Bannister at the University of Illinois in the United States. Initially it was conceived as being a chapter of the American Society of Architectural Historians partly because Bannister had been a founder-member in 1940. However, it was decided in 1956 that the Society should be independent. The early members were mainly architects and teachers. The Chairmen of the first meetings were Bruce Allsopp and William A. Singleton, the latter affiliated with the York Institute of Architectural Study.\nAndor Gomme was an architectural historian and chairman of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain, whose journal, Architectural History, he edited for many years.\nSee also\n* Royal Institute of British Architects\n* Society of Architectural Historians\n* SAHANZ\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  of the SAHGB\n*\n*[https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/special-collections/guide-to-special-collections/a-to-z/collection/?match=Society+of+Architectural+Historians+of+Great+Britain+Archive Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain archives] at the John Rylands Library, Manchester."
