The first published version appeared as \"Levee Song\" in Carmina Princetonia, a book of Princeton University songs published in 1894. The earliest known recording is by The Shannon Quartet, released by Victor Records in 1923.\nMusic\nThe melody of the opening line of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" may have been inspired by the very similar melody at the beginning of the cello solo, about one minute into Franz von Suppé's 1846 Poet and Peasant overture.\nLyrics\nThe verses that generally constitute the modern version of the song are:\nThe 1894 version includes one verse very much like the modern song, though in Minstrel dialect, with an intro that is no longer sung and a very different second verse:\nThe \"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah\" section, with its noticeably different melody, is actually an older song that has been absorbed by \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\". It was published as \"Old Joe, or Somebody in the House with Dinah\" in London in the 1830s or '40s, with music credited to J.H. Cave. \"Dinah\", an abducted woman from the biblical story of Genesis, was a generic name for a slave woman and, by extension, any woman of African-American descent. The melody for this section of the song may have been adapted from \"Goodnight, Ladies\", written (as \"Farewell Ladies\") in 1847 by E.P. Christy.\nAccording to the liner notes to Pete Seeger's ''Children's Concert at Town Hall'' (1963), the \"Dinah won't you blow\" section is a more modern addition, contributed to the song by \"some college students\".\nOther extant verses and stanzas\nOne extant verse that has been recorded in prominent sources follows the \"Singin' fee, fie, fiddly-i-o\" verse:\n:Someone's makin' love to Dinah\n:Someone's making love I know.\n:Someone's making love to Dinah\n:'Cause I can't hear the old banjo!\nIn another version of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" that is printed in \"The Family Car Songbook\", researched and edited by Tam Mossman, the song continues as follows:\n:I've been working on the trestle,\n:Driving spikes that grip.\n:I've been working on the trestle,\n:To be sure the ties won't slip.\n:Can't you hear the engine coming?\n:Run to the stanchion of the bridge!\n:Can't you see the big black smokestack\n:Coming down the ridge?\n:Chorus\n:I've been living in the boxcars.\n:I'm a hobo now.\n:I've been living in the boxcars,\n:Which the yard bulls won't allow.\n:Brother, can you spare a quarter?\n:Buy me something good to eat?\n:Brother, can you spare a nickel,\n:Till I'm on my feet?\n:Chorus\n:I'll be owner of this railroad\n:One of these here days.\n:I'll be owner of this railroad,\n:And I swear, your pay I'll raise.\n:I'll invite you to my mansion,\n:Feed you on goose and terrapin.\n:I'll invite you to the racetrack\n:When my ship comes in.\n:Chorus\n\"The Eyes of Texas\"\n\"The Eyes of Texas\" is the spirit song of the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas at El Paso. It is set to the tune of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" with alternate lyrics written in 1904. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni of the university sing the song at&nbsp;Longhorn&nbsp;sports games and other events.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.org/stream/carminaprinceto00univgoog#page/n27/mode/2up Levee Song] in Carmina Princetonia: The Princeton Song Book (1898)\n* [http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=50253 Discussion]  of \"Someone in the Kitchen with Diana\"  at Mudcat Cafe"
