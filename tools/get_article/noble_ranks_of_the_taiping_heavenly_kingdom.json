The nobility titles were not hereditary.\nE and An were most highest ranks of the nobility, once they were very noble titles of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. If the Heavenly King wanted to promote someone, he gave the person either E or An. However, this rule was challenged after 1860 because the nobility titles had been given too freely.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Ranks !! Male titles !! Female titles !! Derived from !!
