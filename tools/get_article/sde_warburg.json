It was an open woodland dominated by Mount Tabor Oak, which extended from Kfar Yona in the north to Ra'anana in the south. The local Arab inhabitants traditionally used the area for pasture, firewood and intermittent cultivation. The intensification of settlement and agriculture in the coastal plain during the 19th century led to deforestation and subsequent environmental degradation.\nThe moshav was established in 1938 as a Tower and Stockade settlement by immigrants from Germany and was named after Botanist and Zionist leader Otto Warburg.\nFile:שדה ורבורג - מראה שדה ורבורג ליד כפר סבא-JNF033634.jpeg|Sde Warburg 1938\nFile:שדה ורבורג - 5 שנים לקיומו של שדה ורבורג-JNF033646.jpeg|Sde Warburg 1943\nFile:שדה ורבורג - חמש שנים לקיומו-JNF024460.jpeg|Sde Warburgh 5th anniversary celebrations 1943\nFile:Tsofit 1942.jpg|Sde Warburg (Sedie Warburg) 1942 1:20,000\nFile:Qalqilya 1945.jpg|Sde Warburg (Sede Warburg) 1945 1:250,000\nWorld record\nWorld's largest lettuce salad\nSde Warburg held the Guinness World Record for the largest lettuce salad, weighing 10,260&nbsp;kg.
