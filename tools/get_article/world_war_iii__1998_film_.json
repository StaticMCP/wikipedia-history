An English version was also made, which aired on TLC in May 1999. It depicts what might have transpired if, following the overthrow of Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet troops, under orders from a new hard-line regime, had opened fire on demonstrators in Berlin in the fall of 1989 and precipitated World War III. The film mixes real footage of world leaders and archive footage of (for example) combat exercises and news events,  with newly shot footage of citizens, soldiers, and political staff.\nPlot\nIn the summer of 1989, many East German citizens are dissatisfied with Communist leadership and seek reunification with West Germany. East German leader Erich Honecker hopes to crush demonstrations against the regime with military force. General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, a supporter of reforms, visits East Berlin in October but is deposed by hard-line Communist leadership in a coup. Lieutenant General Vladimir Soshkin, a senior official in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Soviet security apparatus, is installed as the new General Secretary and Gorbachev is never heard from again.\nSoshkin and the hard-liners, resistant to glasnost and perestroika, reverse Gorbachev's reforms and the Soviet Union experiences democratic backsliding and a return to autocratic rule. In late October Chinese-style military crackdowns against uprisings in the Eastern Bloc inflames popular opposition to communism. In late November, a demonstration in Leipzig is repressed by East German military and police with great loss of life, and a demonstration at the Brandenburg Gate ends with East German border guards border guards and soldiers killing East Berlin residents trying to scale the Berlin Wall and firing into West Berlin.\nThe East German government responds to international condemnation by ordering foreign journalists out of the country and imposing a media blackout. Soshkin holds his first ever interview with western media in Moscow, and tells West German ZDF correspondent Dirk Sager that the western news media used Gorbachev's reforms to discredit the Soviet system and turn West Berlin into a 'base of aggression' against Warsaw Pact nations. The removal of Gorbachev, he argues, was a 'defensive action'.\nIn mid-December, NATO airlifts military reinforcements to West Berlin following threats by far-left and far right groups. Secretary of State James Baker tries to meet secretly with General Dmitry Leonov, the Soviet commander in East Germany, who opposes Soshkin's crackdown, but Leonov is killed by a car bomb by West German neo-Nazis. When Soshkin threatens West Berlin, US tactical nuclear weapons West Germany are placed on high alert. Soshkin responds by deploying the massive Soviet submarine fleet, and sends Soviet Bear bombers into Alaskan airspace. On January 25, 1990, East German and Soviet tank divisions cut off transportation and supply links between West Germany and West Berlin while the Soviet Air Force closes off East Germany's airspace. NATO deploys additional troops to West Germany.\nWhen the United States announces the first military convoy across the North Atlantic the Soviets announce their intention to blockade the U.S. Navy transports. After last-ditch attempts at negotiation fail, the Soviet Navy & Soviet Air Force attack as the NATO convoy crosses into the Soviet-designated exclusion zone. Nearly a quarter of the convoy is sunk in the ensuing battle before NATO forces clear the air and sea lanes to Europe. An emergency session of the UN Security Council fails to reach a solution to the crisis. American National Security Advisor Martin Jacobs travels to the Soviet Union for talks with Soshkin, and offers an extended timetable for Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe in exchange for a military de-escalation. Soshkin refuses, speaking only once in the entire meeting: \"Nyet (No.)\"\nThe battle for Germany\nincluding Polish resistance movement Royal Netherlands Army units\n| combatant2= Warsaw Pactincluding\n| commander1= NATO bloc George H.

The invasion is intended to provide Soshkin a stronger strategic position for diplomatic bargaining, but the cost is high: both sides lose over 1,000 dead in the first 24 hours. Although pressed to the limit of endurance, NATO forces fight ferociously to stall the Warsaw Pact's advance, but by March 17 the Soviets and their allies have driven 50 miles into West Germany. Public order collapses, and cars jam the roads as civilians try to flee.\n24 hours before a planned series of last-resort tactical nuclear strikes meant to stop the Warsaw Pact advance, NATO launches a surprise counteroffensive to seize control of the air. One component of the mass air offensive is dedicated to striking the Soviet Army's forward headquarters in Poland with American stealth aircraft and crippling Warsaw Pact command and control posts, while the rest directly attack Warsaw Pact fighters and airbases. NATO and Warsaw Pact aviators battle to the death for control of the skies. Already hard-pressed after losing 1/5th of their combat aircraft in the initial offensives, the Warsaw Pact's air forces are ultimately defeated in the struggle, and NATO's air counteroffensive emerges a costly but complete success.\nNATO gains supremacy over Eastern Europe while Polish underground forces cut off Soviet supply lines, and the Warsaw Pact rapidly loses the initiative with numerous headquarters and command posts gone. Unable to coordinate their efforts, and with their numerical superiority negated by Western technological superiority, the East German and Soviet armies melt under sustained NATO airstrikes, and counterattacking NATO forces cross into East Germany on March 23.\nGlobal nuclear war\nNATO forces break through and reach West Berlin on March 27, and the retreating Soviet Army abandons East Germany entirely as they withdraw into Poland, leading many Germans on both sides to believe reunification is at hand. In an effort to avoid escalating the conflict further, American leadership reassures Soshkin NATO will not advance beyond East Germany. Open revolt erupts throughout the Eastern Bloc, spurred by the collapse of East Germany. Soshkin's paranoia rises as the Eastern Bloc falls apart, and despite NATO's statements to the contrary, Soshkin becomes convinced NATO intends to fight all the way to Moscow.\nOn March 31 Soshkin makes a show of force with a nuclear strike above the North Sea. The USA orders full nuclear alert and prepares to execute the Single Integrated Operational Plan. On April 1, a Soviet radar post suffers an equipment malfunction. Falsely believing the USSR is under nuclear attack, Soshkin orders a retaliatory strike against the West. The nuclear powers of NATO have no choice but to respond in kind, and thousands of nuclear devices are launched across the Northern Hemisphere. The narrator announces \"There is no further historical record of what happens next.\"\nBack to reality\nThe film shifts back to Gorbachev's visit to East Berlin and a montage of heartwarming music reminds the audience the Cold War actually ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the eastern bloc regimes.\nCharacters\nActors playing fictional characters\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Actor\n!Character\n!Title\n|-\n|Boris Sichkin\n|General Vladimir Soshkin\n|General Secretary of the Soviet Union\n|-\n|Boris Leskin\n|Yuri Rubanov\n|Soviet Foreign Minister\n|-\n|Christopher Wynkoop\n|Martin Jacobs\n|US National Security Advisor\n|-\n|Sigrid Braun-Umbach\n|Franziska Bruckner\n|West Berlin doctor\n|-\n|Gunter Walch\n|General Karl Frohm\n|West German Army\n|-\n|Klaus Schleif\n|Colonel Wolfgang Heckler\n|East German Army\n|-\n|Oliver Hohlfeld\n|Markus Lehmann\n|East German citizen\n|-\n|Daniel Schorr\n|himself\n|Reporter in Washington, DC\n|-\n|John Ydstie\n|himself\n|Reporter in Lower Saxony\n|}\nClips of real life political leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Person\n!Title\n|-\n|Mikhail Gorbachev\n|General Secretary of the Soviet Union\n|-\n|Erich Honecker\n|General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany\n|-\n|George H.

Frohm and Dr. Bruckner speak in German in the ZDF version and English for TLC.\n*The English version contains two scenes not included in the German one: an interview with two East German soldiers who escaped to the West during the Brandenburg Gate massacre, and a pair of \"man on the street\" interviews (one bellicose, delivered with the accent and demeanor of a stereotypical New Yorker, the other nervous but optimistic) in Times Square.\n*The English version mentions West German, British, Dutch, and American soldiers meeting the initial Baltic attack; in the German version, Belgian forces take part as well.\n*In the German version, the decisive NATO air assault is named \"Operation Bloody Nose\"; in English, it is never given a name.\n*The rewound montages between the missile-launch \"ending\" and the celebratory images of the actual events are slightly different.\n*While the German version concludes with scenes from both the events of November 1989 and reunification (along with the \"different course\" line), the English narration has no such coda, and the montage is entirely from the fall of the Wall.\nParallels and references to real-life events\n*Prague Spring/Invasion of Czechoslovakia—General Soshkin had participated in the 1968 crackdown; the brutality of the forces under his command was so notorious that he appeared on the cover of  Life magazine.\n*Stanislav Petrov prevented the start of nuclear war during a time of increased US/Soviet tension when a Soviet radar computer malfunctioned in November 1983.\n*Black Monday of 1987—Images of the alarming headlines it generated for the New York Post (\"CRASH!\") and Daily News (\"PANIC!\") were used to illustrate a Wall Street crash caused by uncertainty over the future.\n*Tiananmen Square protests of 1989—Chinese students hold a pro-democracy protest near the seat of the Chinese government. After weeks of demonstrations, the Chinese military forcibly ended the protest. This is likely the \"Chinese solution\" alluded to by Soshkin. The events of the movie are set four months after the crackdown. In reality, Honecker openly desired to deal with the unrest in this manner (to the point of trying to talk Gorbachev into such crackdowns in Poland and Hungary), even issuing a written order to do so in Leipzig, and was ousted in mid-October largely to prevent them from being carried out.\n*The fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany—Clips from both also appeared out of context: footage of the reunification was used to show celebrations following the liberation of West Berlin, to suggest it happened after the November massacre.\n*The Soviet coup attempt of 1991 against Mikhail Gorbachev—Clips of US officials and \"West German\" Chancellor Helmut Kohl discussing this event were used in this film; since the coup occurred after 1990, Kohl was actually speaking as the leader of a unified Germany when he made these statements.\n* The Persian Gulf War of 1990–91—Clips of US officials discussing this war were used in this film. FLIR video footage of Coalition air attacks on Iraq is used to illustrate the attack on Warsaw Pact headquarters. News footage of the Allied airstrikes on Baghdad at the start of Operation Desert Storm is used to illustrate the bombing of Hamburg by Soviet and East German air forces.\n* The Falklands War of 1982. Footage from the Battle of San Carlos and the Bluff Cove Air Attacks is used to illustrate the naval battle.\n* The Bosnian War of 1992–95. Shots from aircraft cameras were used to illustrate the NATO bombing of Legnica.\n* The Vietnam War. Footage of the US Marines at Khe Sanh under attack from North Vietnamese Army artillery is used to illustrate the Soviet and East German airstrikes on Ramstein Air Base in West Germany.\n* The First Chechen War. Footage of Russian troops in the Battle of Grozny is used to illustrate Soviet forces retreating from West Germany back into East Germany. Footage of Chechen rebels fighting Russian troops is also used to illustrate the collapse of the East German government as well as to illustrate the growing armed resistance inside the Soviet Union to Soshkin's regime.\n* The Soviet–Afghan War. Footage of Soviet troops is used to illustrate Soviet forces retreating to Poland.\n* George H.W. Bush's statements \"We're dealing with Hitler revisited\" and possibly \"our hearts go out to the hostages\" refer to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, not Soshkin.\n*MiG 29 pilot ejecting at extremely low altitude. He is not shot down, he was performing aerobatics at the 1989 Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport when his engine flamed out.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
