This practice encompasses a wide array of crops, including olives, grapes, citrus fruits, cereals, and vegetables, with a notable emphasis on olive oil production, establishing Greece as a global leader in this industry. The country's vineyards produce tons of grapes and also yield renowned wines. Greece also produces a wide variety of livestock products. Fisheries are playing an important role while forestry plays a secondary role.\nGreek agriculture is based on small, family-owned dispersed units. Currently, 47,9% of agricultural land is arable land, 27,4% is composed of tree plantations, 2,1% is composed of vines and 22,4% is composed of other cultivations (mostly used as pasture land). Greek agriculture employs 615,000 farmers, 12,4% of the total labor force. It produces more than 4,2% of the national GDP, occupies 2.824.449 hectares of land and is the main source of occupation for the majority of rural areas in the country.\nCurrent production\nCurrently, Greek agriculture like other countries of the European Union is heavily subsidized by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Certain deductions of subsidies are planned within the next decade.\nGreece produced in 2018:\n* 1.2 million tons of maize;\n* 1 million tons of olive (5th largest producer in the world, behind Spain, Italy, Morocco and Turkey);\n* 1 million tons of wheat;\n* 968 thousand tons of peach (3rd largest producer in the world, behind China and Italy);\n* 933 thousand tons of grape (19th largest producer in the world);\n* 913 thousand tons of orange (17th largest producer in the world);\n* 837 thousand tons of cotton;\n* 835 thousand tons of tomatoes;\n* 630 thousand tons of watermelon;\n* 465 thousand tons of potato;\n* 353 thousand tons of sugar beet;\n* 344 thousand tons of barley;\n* 285 thousand tons of apple;\n* 265 thousand tons of kiwi (5th largest producer in the world, behind China, Italy, New Zealand and Iran);\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\nModern history\n19th century\n, late 19th century]]\nIn the 19th century, Greek agriculture was very basic. Implements found in western Europe had not yet appeared. The following description was reported by William Henry Moffett, American Consul in Athens and was published in the American periodical Garden and Forest (Volume 2, Issue 95, 18 December 1889, p.&nbsp;612: published by Garden and Forest Publishing Co., Tribune Building, New York, N.Y.):\n:William H. Moffett, United States Consul at Athens, reports the impossibility of making any official statement as to the agriculture of Greece, because \"agriculture is here in the most undeveloped condition. Even in the immediate neighborhood of Athens it is common to find the wooden plow and the rude mattock which were in use 2,000 years ago. Fields are plowed up or scratched over, and crops replanted season after season, until the exhausted soil will bear no more. Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent, and the farm implements are of the very rudest description. Irrigation is in use in some districts, and, as far as I can ascertain, the methods in use can be readily learned by a study of the practices of the ancient Egyptians. Greece has olives and grapes in abundance, and of quality not excelled; but Greek olive oil and Greek wine will not bear transportation.\"\n20th century\nGreek agricultural production was vastly expanded in the 20th century, as per the information given elsewhere on this page. In particular grain production (wheat, barley, etc.) has been significantly increased using more modern farming methods. Much of the research on soil classification, fertiliser use, and dissemination of improved agricultural practice was carried out starting from 1938 in the Kanellopoulos Institute of Chemistry and Agriculture.\nThe main varieties of domestic wheat produced in Greece during 2002 were FLAVIO, VAVAROS and MEXA.\nIn 2020 Greece had 530,679 farms, a 26,6% decrease from 2009 when it had 723,006 farms. 12,588 of those were certified organic or under conversion, a decrease of 23,5% from 2009 when organic farms amounted to 16,448, but at the same time the number of hectares certified as organic increased by 19,3% from 130.828 hectares in 2009 to 156.058 hectares in 2020.\nNotable products\nNotable products include:\n* Avgotaracho of Messolonghi\n* Zante currant\n* Greek wine\n* Fava Santorinis\n* Firiki Piliou\n* Santorini tomato\n* Krokos Kozanis (saffron)\n* Menalou honey\n* Florina pepper\n* Rodi Ermionis\n* Mastic (plant resin) of Chios\n* Tobacco production (region of Macedonia)\n* Tropical fruits (such as bananas and avocados) in Crete\n* Carob\nOlive cultivars/varieties\n*Note: The below list is not considered exhaustive.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
