The game developer is the Russian studio .dat and published by Akella and Kalypso Media. The project was in development since the summer of 2005.\nThe player assumes the role of one of the lords of Nevendaar. This new episode contains three playable races, 'The Empire', 'The Legions of the Damned' and the 'Elven Alliance', with the remaining factions making an addition in planned expansions. The battle system is completely different from that of previous Disciples games. Units are able to move around the battlefield and make use of terrain for fortifications. The player's hero is highly customizable. His abilities as well as his armour and weapons can be changed. All of the equipment changes are noticeable on the actual character model.\nDisciples III: Renaissance uses .dat's in-house Virtual Dream engine.\nStory\nThe story follows a character deemed The Highfather, placed in the world of Nevendaar and its inhabitants. His mind is occupied with the coming fate of his world. During this time, a star falls on the border of the Empire and is seen as a sign by the people. While prophets and other scholars in the universe attempt to solve its mystery, other races such as humans, elves, and demons send their own heroes to find it. One such hero, Bethrezen, wishes to possess the heavenly messenger and use its power as his own.\nThus begins the journey of a mysterious messenger from the heavens named Inoel. She becomes a symbol of hope for many inhabitants of Nevendaar. While traveling the world with representatives of three ancient races, Inoel begins to experience emotions previously unknown to her. The game follows her physical and emotional journey to both find the star and explore the world of Nevandaar while also exploring her humanity.\nExpansion\nThe Russian-language version of Disciples III: Resurrection was released featuring the 'Undead Hordes' faction.
