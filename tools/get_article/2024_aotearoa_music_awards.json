The awards took place on 30 May 2024 at the Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland and was hosted by Jesse Mulligan and Kara Rickard.\n2024 was the first time a televised public ceremony had taken place since 2021; COVID-19 affected the 2022 awards, and the awards had a hiatus for 2023.\nThe awards were live streamed by Radio New Zealand, and made available to watch the next day on TVNZ+.\nBackground\nRecorded Music NZ commissioned a review of the awards following 2022, to ensure that they remained relevant in the current landscape; due to the review, no awards were held in 2023. For 2024, the awards were moved to the end of May, to coincide with New Zealand Music Month; previously they had been held in October/November. Nominations for the 2024 awards had an extended eligibility period dating back to 2022.\nTwo new award categories were introduced in 2024; the Breakthrough Single of the Year () was created alongside the pre-existing Breakthrough Artist of the Year award, and the  category was introduced to recognise \"artists that have made a significant impact on the music landscape\" during the eligibility period.\nA new Tūī trophy design was introduced in 2024. While the shape—first introduced in 1996—remained the same, the new Tūī are carved from tōtara, which was seen as more ecologically-friendly than the previous electroplated trophy.\nCeremony\nwas inducted into the NZ Music Hall of Fame at the awards.]]\nThe awards were held on the evening of 30 May 2024 at Auckland's Viaduct Events Centre, and were hosted by journalists Jesse Mulligan and Kara Rickard. The night was split between an opening ceremony, in which the technical and genre categories were awarded, followed by the \"main showcase\" featuring live performances and the major award categories.\nA kapa haka group from Western Springs College delivered a haka pōwhiri to open the ceremony. The opening also featured live performances from MOHI and Jordyn with a Why.\nStan Walker opened the main showcase with a performance of \"I Am\". The showcase also featured live performances from Corrella, Kaylee Bell, Princess Chelsea, and Coterie.\nDame Hinewehi Mohi received a standing ovation, following a tribute from Moana Maniapoto inducting her into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame.\nThe ceremony closed with Mohi – joined by Drax Project, Stan Walker, Rob Ruha, MOHI and Jordyn with a Why – performing her 1999 hit \"Kotahitanga\".\nNominees and winners\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Album of the YearTe Tino Pukaemi o te Tau\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Single of the YearTe Tino Waiata Tōtahi o te Tau\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'The Beths – Expert in a Dying Field'\n** Avantdale Bowling Club – Trees\n** Coterie – Coterie\n** Erny Belle – Not Your Cupid\n** Home Brew – Run It Back\n** Leisure – Leisurevision\n** Marlon Williams – My Boy\n** Paige – King Clown\n** Princess Chelsea – Everything Is Going To Be Alright\n** Stan Walker – All In\n** Tiny Ruins – Ceremony\n** Unknown Mortal Orchestra – V\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*\"Friday Night At The Liquor Store\" – Avantdale Bowling Club\n** Aaradhna – \"She\"\n** Corrella – \"Blue Eyed Māori\"\n** Coterie – \"Always Beside You\" (ft.
