These will reduce visibility to less than 1&nbsp;km and produce large accumulations of snow on the ground along narrow corridors in lee of the waters. Duration of these events can extend for days.\nFrontal snow squalls are associated with a fast moving intense cold front in winter. Visibility must be reduce to less than 500 m, wind over 40&nbsp;km/h with a wind shift. Quantities of snow is not important with this type but intensity is heavy for a short period, typically 10 to 20 minutes.\nCriteria\nSquall warnings, reduce visibility\nCanada\nIn Canada, snow squall warnings are issued for conditions expected to be:\n*Heavy snow off an open body of water producing at least 15&nbsp;cm accumulations per 12 hours and reducing visibility to less than 400 meters over a limited region.\n*Line of convective snow showers, associated with a cold front, reducing suddenly and for a short period the visibility in snow and blowing snow, causing difficult road conditions.\nUnited States\nBeginning November 1, 2018, the snow squall warning was declared operational in the United States, and the capability to issue these warnings was rolled out to all NWS offices in the US. These issuances are intended to warn drivers of potentially life-threatening road conditions. The warnings are issued in a polygon area, to make the warned area as localized as possible, similar to a tornado, severe thunderstorm, or flash flood warning.\nCriteria for the National Weather Service to issue a snow squall warning include:\n* Visibility of less than one quarter of a mile\n* Sub-freezing temperatures on the ground\n* Expected to last in one area less than 60 minutes\n* Cause dangerous and life-threatening conditions\nIn the winter season of 2023-2024, the National Weather Service started using Impact-Based Warnings for snow squall warnings. Previously, all snow squall warnings would prompt a Wireless Emergency Alert. However, only warnings tagged 'Significant' will trigger an alert, while 'General' warnings, those without an impact tag, will not.\nUS Example\nThe following is an example of a snow squall warning issued by the USA National Weather Service in Binghamton, New York, on February 2, 2018.\n148\nWWUS51 KBGM 021452\nSQWBGM\nBULLETIN - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED\nSnow Squall Warning\nNational Weather Service Binghamton NY\n950 AM EST Fri Feb 2 2018\nNYC007-017-023-053-077-107-109-021545-\n/O.NEW.KBGM.SQ.W.0002.180202T1450Z-180202T1545Z/\nOtsego NY-Broome NY-Madison NY-Cortland NY-Tioga NY-Tompkins NY-\nChenango NY-\n950 AM EST Fri Feb 2 2018\nThe National Weather Service in Binghamton has issued a\n* Snow Squall Warning for...\nCentral Otsego County in central New York...\nNorthwestern Broome County in central New York...\nSouthern Madison County in central New York...\nCortland County in central New York...\nTioga County in central New York...\nTompkins County in central New York...\nChenango County in central New York...\n* Until 1045 AM EST.\n* At 950 AM EST, a dangerous snow squall was located along a line\nextending from near Exeter Center to near Poolville to near\nErieville to near Cuyler to East Homer to near Groton to Enfield,\nmoving southeast at 25 mph.\nHAZARD...Extremely poor visibility in heavy snow.
