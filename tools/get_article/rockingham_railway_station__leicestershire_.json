Despite being in Leicestershire and closest to Caldecott, it was named after the village of Rockingham, Northamptonshire, which although  distant and smaller than Caldecott, was named because of the proximity location to Rockingham Castle.\nThe station opened in 1850, as part of the single track Rugby and Stamford Railway line of the London and North Western Railway (although it joined the Midland Railway at Luffenham). In 1873 the line was doubled and became part of a new Rugby to Peterborough East route.\nThe Great Northern Railway also provided trains between 1880 and 1916.\nAt grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.\nFollowing the closure of the station, the station building itself has now become a private residence, to the south of the village of Caldecott. The stations coal shed is still standing. The Castle Inn, public house in the vicinity, has photographs of the station showing it during usage.\nLine and station closed |route1=London and North Western RailwayRugby and Stamford Railway |col1=\n|previous2=MedbourneLine and station closed |route2=Great Northern RailwayLeicester Belgrave Road to Peterborough North |col2= }}\nReferences"
