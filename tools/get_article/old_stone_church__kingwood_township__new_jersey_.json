It was built in 1837 and is now owned by the First Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Hunterdon County. The church, described using its historic name, Old Stone Presbyterian Church in Kingwood, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 25, 2018 for its significance in architecture. The earlier church located here was a smaller stone building built in 1755, called the Old Stone Meetinghouse. The stones from this church were probably used to build the current one. The Kingwood congregation was established in 1728 and grew during the First Great Awakening, with Gilbert Tennent and George Whitefield preaching here in 1739.\nThe Oak Summit School, located next to the church, is a one-room schoolhouse that was established in 1849 and used until 1953. The building is not part of this NRHP listing.\nGallery\nFile:The Jerseyman (1891) (14767397995).jpg|Kingwood Presbyterian Church, erected 1755\nFile:Oak Summit School, Kingwood Township, NJ.jpg|Oak Summit School\nOak Summit Cemetery\nThe cemetery for the Presbyterian church was established on the south side of Oak Summit Road in 1754.
