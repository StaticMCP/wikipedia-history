The liner notes include essays written for the box set by producers Jerry Wexler, Arif Mardin, and Tom Dowd, as well as contributors Ahmet Ertegun, Dave Marsh, David Ritz, and Thulani Davis. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Album Notes at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards, the first win in the category by a woman (Davis).\nThis release by Atlantic Records should not be confused with the February 2014 release by Rhino Records entitled The Queen of Soul.
