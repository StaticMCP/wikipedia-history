Most of the members, including Prime Minister Osachi Hamaguchi in the center, are in the uniforms of  officials. Minister of the Army Kazushige Ugaki (second from the right) is in military uniform, while Minister for Foreign Affairs Kijūrō Shidehara (third from the right) is in the uniform of a baron.]]\nThe official , used from the Meiji period until the end of the Second World War, consisted of European-inspired clothing of the 1870's. It was first introduced at the beginning of the Meiji period and maintained through the institution of the constitutional monarchy by the Meiji Constitution, and represented the highest uniforms in use at the time. Uniforms for members of the  peerage and civil officials were officially set.\nHistory\nin 1871. Sanjo Sanetomi in the center is wearing traditional . Another Japanese man is in a Western-style military uniform and topknot.]]\nWhen the Meiji Restoration began, those working to build the new government were wearing a diverse array of different clothing based on their social status during the previous Edo period. Nobles had their  court wear and informal , samurai had the distinct  and  dress, and members of Westernized military forces had their Western-style uniforms. For example, during the Emperor's visit to Tokyo in 1868, opinions were divided between the high officials Nakayama Tadayasu and Date Munenari. Nakayama argued that  should be worn only when departing and when entering the castle, while  would be worn en route; Date held that  should be worn only when entering the castle, with  and  both allowed en route. As a result, it was decided that both  and  would be allowed en route, with  also permitted when entering the castle. Furthermore, the colors and designs on the , , and  were all unique to each individual, destroying the visual unity of the procession. Meanwhile, the soldiers guarding it were dressed in Western-style uniforms, but were not at all accustomed to the clothing. Ernest Satow commented that their slovenly appearances ruined the solemnity of the procession. This lack of uniformity was once again evident on the Emperor's repeat visit the next year.\nThe situation was clearly untenable, and so after the election of officials to the new government in summer 1869, the Minister of Justice Saga Saneharu was put in charge of the problem. In a meeting of the legislature that winter, Iwakura Tomomi proposed deliberation over the court dress for governmental officials that Saga and his helpers had come up with. However, as this design was based on the former dress of court nobles, it met with opposition from those of samurai descent. In order to resolve this disorder, the  was released on October 17, 1871. In order to quiet the  still attached to traditional styles of dress, the order claimed that  and similar kinds of clothing were weak, and Japan should go back to the styles of the time of Emperor Jimmu and Empress Jingū. The \"styles of that time\" meant tight sleeves and narrow , and so the order implied that Western-style dress, complying to these standards, had much in common with the essential garb of the Japanese themselves. Calling back to the spirit of Jimmu's legendary founding of the country, it appealed for the creation of a new uniform.\ncontrol their strength through indomitability. The modern  dress has been based on the old dress of the Tang, and is a weak style. We lament this greatly. It is distant from Our roots, ruling by the strength of Japan's warriors. We of the Imperial Line have Ourselves become marshals, and by the people We revere that style. There is nothing of Emperor Jimmu's founding of the country or Empress Jingū's subjugation of Korea in the style of today. We ought not to show such weakness to the world for even one day. I now resolve to revise our uniform and reform our mores, and wish to construct a warrior's  not seen since our ancestors' time. My vassals, give shape to these my wishes.|朕惟フニ風俗ナル者移換以テ時ノ宜シキニ随ヒ国体ナル者不抜以テ其勢ヲ制ス今衣冠ノ制中古唐制ニ摸倣セシヨリ流テ軟弱ノ風ヲナス朕太タ慨之夫レ神州ノ武ヲ以テ治ムルヤ固ヨリ久シ天子親ラ之カ元帥ト為リ衆庶以テ其風ヲ仰ク神武創業神功征韓ノ如キ決テ今日ノ風姿ニアラス豈一日モ軟弱以テ天下ニ示ス可ケンヤ朕今断然其服制ヲ更メ其風俗ヲ一新シ祖宗以来尚武ノ国体ヲ立ント欲ス汝近臣其レ朕カ意ヲ体セヨ}}}}\nOn December 12, 1872, the Dajō-kan released an edict implementing regulations for the uniforms of civil officials and nobles, and on December 29 of that year another edict determined regulations for their wearing. The new official uniforms were indeed designed based on the court uniforms used in Europe at the time. The first of these edicts also designated white tie dress as the court dress of choice for those not entitled to any particular court uniform, such as private citizens.\nThe uniforms for members of the Imperial Family were first decided by an edict of the Dajō-kan on February 22, 1873, and then updated in 1876 and 1911.\nAfter the Peerage Act of July 7, 1884, divided the existing  into five ranks, the Ministry of the Imperial Household further established the uniforms for these new subcategories. On October 29 of the same year, another edict of the Dajō-kan created gown-type court uniforms for senior officials within palace agencies like the Board of Chamberlains and Board of Ceremonies. From 1888 to 1889, various other personnel were outfitted with uniforms and assigned court uniforms. The Imperial Household Agency's uniforms underwent major changes in 1911 and 1928.\nin the manteau de cour]]\nOn June 23, 1886, provisions were set to determine formal Western wear for women. In order from most to least formal, these were the manteau de cour, robe décolletée, robe mi-décolletée, and robe montante.\nOn December 4 of the same year, the designs of the court uniforms for civil officials were modified, but the designs for junior officials were not updated. Because the officials were responsible for providing their own court uniforms, the cost had been too much for junior officials. From this point on, junior civil officials wore standard white tie court dress. The difference in price was extreme: when the official Kikuchi Takeo ordered both a three-piece suit and his court uniform at the same shop, the suit cost 28 yen and the uniform 220 yen.\nOn March 2, 1908, an Imperial edict established substitute court uniforms for diplomats dispatched to the tropics or very hot areas. Later, on September 29, 1926, another Imperial edict established alternative court uniforms and court dress for Japanese officials in the South Pacific. All of these consisted of white tunics. Old news footage shows officials of the South Seas Mandate, including Kōki Hirota, in these clothes.\nAlthough their names differed, naval and military officers also had dress corresponding to court uniforms. Unlike civil officials, military officials were allowed to wear their uniforms to personal ceremonies such as marriages and funerals.\nThese various kinds of court uniforms continued to be used at court functions and ceremonies even into the Shōwa period, at events like the Imperial enthronement and the Duke of Gloucester' visit or the first visit of Emperor of Manchukuo Puyi to Japan. However, as the strain of war continued, opportunities for their use became rarer and rarer. On July 2, 1938, the Imperial Household Agency announced its policy to stop wearing robes by simplifying court ceremonies while the 'Incident' continued, and accordingly the court uniforms disappeared from public view.\nWhen Mitsumasa Yonai became Prime Minister during the Second Sino-Japanese War, his morning dress could not be tailored in time for the appointment, and he wore a naval uniform in its place at his official investiture.\nAfter the war, Imperial Household Agency edicts and the pertinent Dajō-kan edicts were abolished, on May 2, 1947, and July 1, 1954, respectively. The Empire of Japan's court uniforms disappeared with them, but similar male uniforms do remain in use around the world, including in France, various South American countries, and Thailand.\nCourt uniforms for civil officials\nThree of the highest subcategories of civil officials were allocated specific court uniforms: , , and .\nThese uniforms were officially decided by edict of the Dajō-kan on December 12, 1872. The Iwakura Mission, which had departed Japan earlier, also gathered information on uniform design via Hayashi Tadasu. However, the mission had no time to wait for a final decision before an audience with Queen Victoria. They therefore ordered uniforms in England, based on the designs they had been discussing with the homeland. Unfortunately, the designs they reported back were determined to be impossible to create in Japan's still-immature Western clothing stores and were not adopted directly. The versions ultimately decreed by the Dajō-kan differed considerably from the Iwakura mission's prototypes. The Dajō-kan's edicts were still incomplete as a form of law, and the details of the original edict itself were in some areas insufficient, so variations were visible depending on the manufacturer.\nThere were also problems with the uniforms themselves. The pants for  were designated as being white, but in Europe white pants were only worn in court uniforms on special occasions. This issue was even pointed out by Otto von Bismarck when the Iwakura mission visited Germany. On September 18, 1877, an edict of the Dajō-kan brought these pants into line with the coats, changing them to the same black wool material.\nAiming to set clear and unified standards for the uniforms, the regulations were amended on December 4, 1886, by an order of the Ministry of the Imperial Household. Pictures and diagrams were published in an official telegram, and related manufacturers were provided with sample illustrations printed in color.\nThe amendment was targeted at the uniforms for senior officials. Those of junior officials were not addressed and instead died out. A minor amendment from the same office on December 10, 1892, modified the side decorations on the uniforms of . Correspondence between the Cabinet's chief clerk Kawasaki Takashi and Under-Secretary of the Army Hajime Sugiyama suggests that further modifications to civil officials' uniforms were being considered at the time of the 1928 changes to the uniforms of the Imperial Household Agency.\nFile:Court uniform 1872 01.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1872 02.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1872 03.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1886 01.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1886 02.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1886 03.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1886 04.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1886 05.jpg|\nFile:Court uniform 1886 06.jpg|\nCourt uniforms to the 1872 Dajō-kan standard\nFile:Inoue, K.jpg|Inoue Kaoru\nFile:Inoue Kowashi as Minister of Education.jpg|Inoue Kowashi\nFile:Sano Tsunetami2.jpg|Sano Tsunetami\nFile:SanjoSanetomi.jpg|Sanjō Sanetomi\nFile:Okuma Shigenobu2.jpg|Ōkuma Shigenobu\nFile:Eikichi Ishida.JPG|\nFile:Nakamura Masanao.jpg|Nakamura Masanao\nFile:Hisoka Maejima.jpg|Maejima Hisoka\nFile:Viscount Ogyu Uzuru.PNG|Matsudaira Norikata\nFile:Date Munenari in uniform.jpg|Date Munenari\nFile:Tadakatsu Utsumi.JPG|Utsumi Tadakatsu\nFile:宮城浩蔵.jpeg|\nCourt uniforms of the Iwakura Mission\nFile:IWAKURA Tomomi.jpg|Iwakura Tomomi\nFile:Prime Minister Hirobumi Ito.jpg|Itō Hirobumi\nFile:Ōkubo Toshimichi.jpg|Ōkubo Toshimichi\nFile:Genichiro Fukuchi 3.jpg|Fukuchi Gen'ichirō\nComposition\n; Hat\n: , , and  wore the same kind of hats, but had different embellishments to the decoration on the right side.\n; Coat\n: A frock coat of black wool.

However, the higher-ranking among these affixed symbols of their ranks to each cuff.\nAfter the 1886 revision\n]]\nFile:勅任官大礼服.JPG|, front and back\nFile:奏任官大礼服.JPG|, front and back\nFile:Hiroshi Saitō (ambassador).jpg|The ambassador Hiroshi Saitō as a\nFile:Hiroshi Saitō at the diplomatic reception at White House.jpg|Hiroshi Saitō as a\nCourt uniforms for court ranks\n, dressed to the 1872 standard\n| image2            = Yukio Ozaki.jpg\n| caption2          = Yukio Ozaki, dressed to the 1886 standard\n| footer            =\n}}\nThe court uniforms for people possessing court ranks, but no official position, were decided along with those for civil officials in the December 12, 1872, edict of the Dajō-kan. After the establishment of the five ranks (duke, baron, etc.) within the  peerage, however, heads of titled households wore uniforms specific to their titles. According to the  of May 4, 1887, people possessing the  or above were entitled to treatment comparable to that of titled peers. Specifically, the junior first rank was to correspond to the title of duke, the senior second rank to a marquis, the junior second rank to a count, the senior third rank to a viscount, and the senior fourth rank to a baron.\nThe uniforms for ranks above the fourth conformed to those of , and those for the senior fifth rank and above to those of . However, they were decorated only with  (emblems), with no additional foliage scrollwork embroidery, and with one  emblem, two  (about ) in diameter, affixed at the small of the back. In the 1872 version, the hat plumage was black even for those above the fourth rank, and the stripes on the trousers were composed of embroidered lines of five  (about ) across in a  pattern, while people of the fifth rank and below had single stripes of the same width. An edict of the Dajō-kan on October 8, 1877, added black wool trousers, and a May 27, 1911, Imperial Household ordinance changed the hat plumage for those of fourth rank or above to white.\nFile:Court uniform 1872 04.jpg|Accompanying diagram to the 1872 court uniforms for the fourth rank and above\nFile:Court uniform 1872 05.jpg|Accompanying diagram to the 1872 court uniforms for the fifth rank and below\nFile:MakinoTadayuki.jpg|Makino Tadayuki\nThe Emperor's Western clothes\nThe continuing Westernization of the Emperor's clothing, food, and living conditions after the Meiji Restoration led to the need for Western , or Imperial garb. This was prepared in 1872, and resembled the court uniforms for civil officials. At the time, the Emperor still had a topknot, and so his hat was designed to contain it.\nHowever, the foreign government advisor  advised that the emperor of France wore a military general's uniform, rather than that of a civil official. Shortly thereafter, was used from the Emperor's Birthday in 1872; Osakabe claims their use began in June of the next year.}} new military-style , called  or , were created. These  were used until October 11, 1880, when another edict of the Dajō-kan created a new uniform called the , based on the uniform of a general in the Japanese army. The 1880 edict was replaced on November 14, 1913, by an Imperial Household ordinance. Along with a redesign of the army uniform-based outfit, a version based on naval uniform was also introduced. After this, the army- and navy-style uniforms were redefined and the corresponding ordinance modified whenever the base army and navy uniforms were themselves updated.\nWhen Japan lost the Second World War and the Imperial Japanese Army was dissolved in 1945, a new Imperial uniform was established. However, this new uniform was abolished on May 2, 1947, along with all other Imperial Household Edicts.\nFile:Mutsuhito-Emperor-Meiji-1873.png|Emperor Meiji in army-style\nFile:Showa emperor wearing tenno gofuku.jpg|Emperor Shōwa in the 1945 Imperial uniform design\nCourt uniforms for the Imperial Family\nWhen the court uniforms for the Imperial Family were first established on February 22, 1873, the designs were more or less the same as those for court ranks, but with the paulownia crests replaced with the chrysanthemum seal. This made the Imperial Family's uniforms difficult to distinguish from those for court ranks, and so on October 12, 1876, they were updated with chrysanthemum foliage scrollwork.\nIn 1911, the Imperial Household Ordinance on Imperial Family Dress was promulgated, and an additional clause in it abolished the pertinent Dajō-kan edicts of 1873 and 1876. This order defined two levels of formal dress, changed the chrysanthemum foliage scrollwork to use a sakura motif instead, and specified fully closed mandarin collars. However, as Imperial Family members were now supposed to wear the uniforms of their offices if they held any, and most princes were appointed as officers in the military or navy unless there was a reason not to, most wore military uniforms, and these new uniforms for the Imperial Family saw little actual use.\nFile:Court uniform for Princes 1873.jpg|Diagram from the 1873 Dajō-kan edict\nFile:Court uniform for Princes 1876.jpg|Diagram from the 1876 Dajō-kan edict\nFile:Court uniform for Princes 1911.jpg|Diagram from the 1911 Imperial Household Agency edict\nCourt uniforms for the\ncourt uniforms\n| width             = 150\n| image1            = Yoshinobu Tokugawa 2.jpg\n| caption1          = Duke Tokugawa Yoshinobu\n| image2            = Kinto Saga 01.jpg\n| caption2          = Marquis\n| footer            =\n}}\nAfter the Peerage Act of July 7, 1884, divided the existing  into five ranks, uniforms were established for these ranks by the Ministry of the Imperial Household on October 25 of the same year.\nComposition\nCompared to the uniforms for civil officials, those for  lacked embroidery on the breast, but had a mandarin collar and epaulets.\n;Identifying the five ranks\n:The five ranks of  were distinguishable by the color of the embroidery around their sleeves and collars, and on the right side of their hats.

In 1886, the Imperial Guard were assigned both regular and court uniforms, and in 1888 the rest of the institutions of the Ministry of the Imperial Household were allocated their own. In 1889,  and  of the Crown Prince's Household got both formal and informal court uniforms, and in 1891 escort dress was created for high officials in the Agency. These various regulations were unified in a 1911 revision, and major changes were made in 1928.\n1884 designs\nThe October 29, 1884, edict 91 of the Dajō-kan allocated court uniforms for  and  on the Board of the Chamberlains and the Board of Ceremonies. These gown-like designs were based on Prussian court clothing, and were supposedly proposed by Yamagata Aritomo.\nFile:Court officer uniform 1884 01.jpg|\nFile:Court officer uniform 1884 02.jpg|, seventh rank or higher\nFile:Court officer uniform 1884 03.jpg|, eighth or ninth rank\n1886 designs\nThe June 26, 1886, edict 9 of the Ministry of the Imperial Household established regular and court uniforms for the Imperial Guard.

Servants and coachmen were also assigned formal and informal court wear, as well as regular uniforms.\nFile:Eirch Sellin - Ottmar von Mohl (um 1910).jpg|Ottmar von Mohl\nFile:Hijikata Hisamoto 2.jpg|Hijikata Hisamoto (in 1891 escort dress)\nFile:Iwakura Tomosada.jpg|Iwakura Tomosada (in 1911 court uniform for Imperial Household Agency )\n1911 designs\ncourt uniforms to the 1911 standard\n|width = 150\n|image1 = Hijikata, H.jpg\n|caption1 = Hijikata Hisamoto\n|image2 = Katayama-Tokuma.jpg\n|caption2 = Katayama Tōkuma\n| footer    = }}\nOn May 26, 1911, the Imperial Household Ordinance on Imperial Household Agency Uniforms abolished the 1884 and 1891 uniforms and unified the regulations.
