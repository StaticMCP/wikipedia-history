The ceremony was co-hosted by Bill Cosby and Merv Griffin.\nThe top shows of the night were Get Smart, which won Outstanding Comedy Series for the second consecutive year, and Outstanding Dramatic Series winner NET Playhouse. NET Playhouse, from the PBS predecessor National Educational Television Network, became the first show outside the Big Three television networks to win a top series award.\nDue to several categories being combined for the ceremony, no show received more than two major wins. The most drastic rule change was that all shows that had aired more than two seasons were ineligible. The cause of this change was due to the rise in repeat winners in recent years. There was no winner in the category of Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role'', because the judges felt that none of the nominees were worthy of an award.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Get Smart (NBC)'\n** Bewitched (ABC)\n** Family Affair (CBS)\n** The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (NBC)\n** Julia (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'NET Playhouse (NET)'\n** The F.B.I.
