The kingdom evolved through several distinct phases, beginning with the M'nyanjagha Kingdom (c. 1400s–1770s) and later transitioning to the Chikulamayembe dynasty (c. 1805–1870s) after the arrival of Unyamwezi traders known as the Balowoka.\nOrigins of the Tumbuka people\nThe Tumbuka trace their origins to the Luba Kingdom in the Congo Basin region, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They left the Luba Kingdom in the early 1400s as part of a larger Bantu migration that included the Hehe and Gogo of modern Tanzania. The migration was led by a senior leader named Mudala, while each ethnic segment had its own junior leader. Mulonga Mbulalubilo led the Tumbuka group and was the first to cross the Lualaba River.\nThe group moved eastward, passing north of Lake Mweru and through Lake Mweru Wantipa, reaching southern Tanzania. Following Mudala's death around 1410, leadership disputes led to the division of the migrating community into three groups by 1415. The Gogo and Hehe moved north, while the Tumbuka continued southward.\nDuring their migration, they discovered a river they called Kalonga (\"small river\"), later known as the Songwe River. The term \"Tumbuka\" derives from their experience of crossing rivers and lakes, meaning \"we are crossing the water.\" In the Kalonga District, they referred to themselves as Batumbuka kwa Luba (\"the group that broke off from Luba\"). By the 15th century, the Tumbuka had settled between the Luangwa River valley and the northern shores of Lake Malawi, becoming the predominant inhabitants of the region.\nM'nyanjagha Kingdom (c. 1400s–1770s)\nFoundation and structure\nUpon settling in their new homeland, a leader named Kayazga established himself in a fertile valley with many coconut trees. His son Mukamanga (\"owner of the coconut trees\") became a notable ancestor of the Bakamanga (or Kamanga) clan. The Kamanga settled across what are now western Rumphi, Nkhamanga, parts of Mzimba, and into Lundazi and Chama in Zambia, extending south to the Bua River.\nMukamanga’s descendant Nyanjagha Botawota (Katungambizi I) fathered Longwe Botawota, who became the first M'nyanjagha (king) of the Tumbuka, founding the M'nyanjagha Kingdom.\nPolitical organization\nThe M'nyanjagha Kingdom was decentralized. By the 18th century, the Tumbuka lived in scattered homesteads, cultivating millet and herding goats and sheep across the plateau between the Luangwa Valley and Lake Malawi. Villages were organized around clans such as the Luhanga, Kumwenda, and Mkandawire, each maintaining local autonomy.\nThe Tumbuka were generally peaceful and lacked centralized taxation or formal tribute systems. Instead, loyalty was expressed symbolically, such as by offering leopard or lion skins.\nDifferent Tumbuka subgroups occupied specific territories:\n* The Henga occupied the Henga Valley north of Rumphi.\n* The Phoka lived south of the Nyika Plateau.\n* The Kamanga settled in the central Nkhamanga plains.\n* The Tonga lived along the lakeshore.\nArrival of the Balowoka (1770–1805)\nBetween 1770 and 1780, long-distance traders from Unyamwezi in central Tanzania arrived across Lake Malawi. Led by Kakalala Msawira Gondwe (Mlowoka, \"the one who crossed over\"), they landed at Chilumba and moved inland via Chiweta, Phwezi, and Njakwa into Nkhamanga.\nThe Tumbuka called these traders Balowoka (\"those who crossed over\"). They sought ivory and brought cloth, beads, cowrie shells, salt, and iron hoes, which they traded for ivory and other goods.\nMlowoka settled in the Nkhamanga area around 1775, marrying into the Luhanga and Kumwenda clans.\nWhen Mubila Luhanga died, succession passed to Mlowoka’s son, establishing a new political order.\nChikulamayembe dynasty (c. 1805–1870s)\nFoundation under Gonapamuhanya\nAround 1805, Mlowoka’s son Gonapamuhanya (Khalapamuhanya) became the first to hold the title Chikulamayembe. The name derives from the Kiswahili phrase chukuwamajembe (\"to carry hoes\"), referencing the imported hoes he distributed as gifts.\nGonapamuhanya ruled from Bolero in modern Rumphi District, still the seat of the Chikulamayembe chieftaincy. His rule blended Balowoka and Tumbuka traditions, shifting inheritance to patrilineal lines and creating a more centralized trade-based authority.\nExtent and organization\nThe extent of Chikulamayembe authority extended from the Songwe River in the north to the Dwangwa River in the south, and from the Luangwa valley in the west to Lake Malawi in the east, an area of approximately 20,000 square miles.\nList of Chikulamayembe rulers (pre-colonial era)\nThe following rulers are documented from the Chikulamayembe dynasty before British colonial intervention:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They killed several rulers, including Mkuwayira and Mujuma, enslaved many Tumbuka, and integrated young men into Ngoni regiments. By the 1870s, the Chikulamayembe state had collapsed.\nCultural transformation\nNgoni rule brought major cultural shifts such as patrilineal descent became dominant, Ngoni dances and marriage customs spread, but the Tumbuka language persisted and eventually replaced Ngoni speech.\nBritish colonial period and revival\nThe Northern Ngoni accepted British rule in 1904. Missionaries encouraged restoration of Tumbuka leadership, and the colonial government revived the Chikulamayembe chieftaincy in 1907.\nThe revival was influenced by a 1909 manuscript by Saulos Nyirenda, later translated by missionary Thomas Cullen Young, which exaggerated the precolonial kingdom’s extent. Based on this version, Mbawuwo Mgonanjerwa Gondwe (Cilongozi Mlowoka), a descendant of Gonapamuhanya, was installed as Themba Chikulamayembe in 1907. He later gained administrative powers under the Native Authority Ordinance of 1933.\nSee also\n* Tumbuka people\n* Chikulamayembe dynasty\n* Nkhamanga Kingdom\n* Ngoni people\n* History of Malawi\n* Tumbuka language\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/tumbuka Encyclopedia.com: Tumbuka]\n* [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tumbuka Britannica: Tumbuka]"
