He was appointed assistant manager to Lee Turnbull there in April 2003 until he left in 2005.\nHe later played for Goole, Brigg Town, Stocksbridge Park Steels and AFC Blackburn Leisure.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.doncasterrovers.co.uk/players/UtoW/Warren,Lee.htm doncasterrovers.co.uk profile]\n* [http://www.oncloudseven.com/warren-l.htm On Cloud Seven (Brigg Town) profile]"
