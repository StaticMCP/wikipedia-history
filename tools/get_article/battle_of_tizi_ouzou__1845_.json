They promised the tribes the imminent arrival of Prince Abd al-Qadir following his remarkable victories in the western region of Algeria Some factions from Ait Irathen From Larbaa Nath Irathen, Ait Fraoussen From Mekla, and Ait Jnad, responded to the call of Belqasem Oqasi and Ahmed ben Salem. They rallied to expel the leaders appointed by France in the region.\nHowever, the French occupation forces swiftly mobilized their collaborating troops at the onset of the rebellion, fortifying themselves in \"Burj Tizi Ouzou\" in the Rajaouna Mountains. They communicated the precarious situation to the Governor-General in Algiers General De Bar dispatched approximately 200 cavalry, overseen by the Commander of the Yser Region, to Tizi Ouzou to reinforce the appointed leaders and repel the tribal resistance's attack This support was followed by the arrival of another contingent of knights sent by the Commander of the Khachna Region, known as \"The Arab General,\" to reinforce the defenders of Tizi Ouzou.\nBattle\nThe two forces, the tribal resistance on one side and the French collaborators on the other, clashed in the region of \"Ouled Boukhelifa\" (Boukhalfa) at the beginning of June 1845. There, Belqasem Oqasi and Ahmed ben Salem, along with the tribal resistors supporting them, suffered defeat, The resistance suffered some casualties, leading them to abandon Belqasem Oqasi and his successor, especially after discovering the camp of General Jean-François Gentil, who had arrived to support the French collaborators in Tizi Ouzou.\nAftermath\nAfter this, The leadership of France's allies in the Kabyle region was reinforced and it marked an extension of French influence in Kabylia.\nReferences"
