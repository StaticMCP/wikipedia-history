It has been awarded 29 consecutive times from 1996 to 2025.\nBackground\nDefinition of the award\nThe award recognises 'completed works of architecture of the highest quality' in the public architecture category. Previously the award was offered for 'institutional buildings' with winning and commended projects including a wider array of building types. In 1995 Wood Marsh was awarded the last Award of Merit, Institutional New, for Deakin University Stage 1.\nProjects in this awards category must be predominantly of a public or institutional nature and generally fall within Building Code of Australia (BCA) Class 9, excluding projects within the definition of 'Educational Architecture or any BCA Class 9b building used primarily for educational purposes'. In 1997 the previous institutional awards were recategorised into separate and distinct public, educational and commercial categories.\nA total of 15 of the 24 named awards (62%) presented between 1996 and 2024 were also awarded the top award, the Victorian Architecture Medal at the same awards.\nEarlier award\nIn 1986 Denton Corker Marshall were awarded the William Wilkinson Wardell Medal for One Collins Street. The award was defined as 'best building of the last three years'.\nMultiple winners\nARM Architecture (Ashton Raggatt McDougall) have won the award on five separate occasions: 1996, 2004, 2009, 2015 and 2016.\nNational awards for public architecture\nWinners of this award are eligible for consideration in the annual national Australian Institute of Architects architecture awards for the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, usually announced in October or November. Projects awarded either the Named Award or Architecture Awards in the William Wardell Award can also be considered for the National Award in the same year. To 2024 only three projects from Victoria have gone on to win the national named award.\nWilliam Wardell\nThe naming of the award recognises English born architect and civil engineer William Wardell (1823–1899). Wardell was appointed government architect in Victoria in 1858. He designed many important public and eccliastical buildings in Melbourne over a 20-year period. After being dismissed by the government Wardell moved to Sydney, extending his career as an influential and important public architect. He died in North Sydney in 1899.\nNamed award winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | William Wardell Prize for Public Architecture by year\n|-\n!
