In Meitei mythology and the religion of Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur), she is the highest female divinity as well as is revered as the mother of every living being in the universe.\nImoinu, also spelled as Emoinu (|}}), is an ancient Meitei goddess, associated with household, hearth, family, fireplace, kitchen, wealth, peace and prosperity. In Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur), she is also identified as a form of goddess Leimarel Sidabi.\nIn Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur), Panthoibi (|Paanthoibee}}, |Panthoipi}}), also known as , is an ancient Meitei goddess associated with civilization, courage, fertility, handicraft, love, victory, warfare and wisdom.\nShe is considered to be a divine incarnation of goddess Leimarel Sidabi as well as that of Nongthang Leima.\nIn Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur), Phouoibi, also known as Phouleima, is an ancient Meitei goddess associated with agriculture, crops, fertility, grains, harvest, paddy, rice and wealth.\nWomen in Meitei literature\nThe Meitei Chanu (poem) depicts the feminization of the Meitei language and Meitei literature.\nIts opening lines notably shows the idea of a culture that is prevalent in the form of a shrine (). The very literary temple refers to the remaining empty without a goddess () for a very long period of time. This metaphor shows significant transformation in history as \"Ema\" () or the \"Meitei Chanu\"  () re-occupies the temple. The reasons why she could enter into her past shrine once again are because of the western education, their imitations and the feminization of language and literature.\nWomen in music\nIn traditional music\nIn the 2010s, Ima Thoinu, a traditional Moirang Sai singer, got only a few students to learn the endangered art form, which was the only means to keep it alive.\nA small group of performers are again learning the nearly extinct art form of the Moirang Sai to save it from total extinction.\nThe art form was outstandingly revived due to the hard works of Mangka Mayanglambam (}}), a traditional Meitei folk singer and artist of the \"Laihui\" (}}). Mangka is re-popularising the nearly extinct art form among the present youth once again.\nWomen's only market\nThe Ima Market (), also known as the  or the , in Imphal, is the only market in the world run entirely by women.–––––––– Inside the market, male shopkeepers and vendors are not allowed to sell anything.\nThe three major building complexes of the Ima Market are named after three prominent ancient Meitei goddesses, who are Leimarel Sidabi (for Market No. 1), Emoinu/Imoinu (for Market No. 2) and Phouoibi (for Market No. 3).\nIma Keithel is a classic example of the long-lasting tradition of business management done by Meitei women in Manipur. Traditionally, Meitei women always enjoyed high status in the economy of the society. Women lead the trade and commerce in food and vegetables, household things and clothes in Meitei society. In history, it is the symbol of the empowerment and the leadership prospects of Meitei women in Manipur.\nWomen's rebellions\nagainst British colonial rule ]]\nWomen in sports\nIn traditional sports\nIn non traditional sports\nWomen torch bearers\nThe  are traditional Meitei women's social organisations and their movements in Manipur.They originated during the times when there were no artificial light available or rare in Manipur, hence the womenfolk used handmade torches to light the paths. They work against many different social evils, like the misuse of military powers by the Indian Army in Manipur, India. They are called the \"Guardians of the society\". The name comes from the burning torches that the women carry. The torch has become the symbol of peaceful protest for justice at all levels of life.\nWomen in extravaganzas\nMiss Meetei Chanu, also spelled as Miss Meitei Chanu, is an international annual beauty pageant that is run by the Manipur based Lainingthou Sanamahi Sana Pung (LSSP), aiming to make Meitei women understand the culture and tradition of Sanamahism (traditional Meitei religion).\nSee also\n* Plants in Meitei culture\n* Hills and mountains in Meitei culture\n* Birds in Meitei culture\n* Animals in Meitei culture\n* Women in Buddhist culture\n* Women in Christian culture\n* Women in Hindu culture\n* Women in Islamic culture\n* Women in Jewish culture\nNotes\nReferences"
