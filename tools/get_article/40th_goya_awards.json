In July 2025 the Academy presented the regulations for the 2026 awards. A key feature was the modification of the eligibility criteria for the Goya Award for Best New Director, changing the nature of the debut work from first ICAA-assessed feature film to first feature film released in theatres, thus enabling directors such as Eva Libertad (Deaf) with previous works without theatrical distribution (Nikolina) to be eligible for the award. In addition it was established than only one previously designated awardee was allowed to deliver a thank you speech during the gala for each award presentation. The final date of 28 February 2026 was announced in September 2025. The chosen date (somewhat delayed in relation to customary early February dates) set some distance with the celebration of the 18th Gaudí Awards of Catalan cinema on 8 February 2026 also due to be hold in Barcelona, but put the ceremony close to the 29th Málaga Film Festival, opening on 6 March 2026.\nOn 21 October 2025, the Spanish Film Academy presented the 15 submissions (down from 17 in 2025) for the Goya Award for Best Ibero-American Film:\nUnder the Flags, the Sun (Paraguay), Banzo (Portugal), Belén (Argentina), Quadrilateral (Peru), El extraordinario viaje del dragón (Venezuela), The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo (Chile), La piel del agua (Costa Rica), La Virginia de los bolivianos (Bolivia), Los ahogados (Ecuador), Manas (Brazil), We Shall Not Be Moved (Mexico), A Poet (Colombia), Dogs (Uruguay), Beloved Tropic (Panama), and Sugar Island (Dominican Republic).\nOn 28 October 2025, Méndez-Leite announced Luis Tosar and Rigoberta Bandini as the gala hosts.\nCategories\n{| role=\"presentation\" class=wikitable\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Film}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Director}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Actor}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Actress}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Supporting Actor}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Supporting Actress}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best New Actor}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best New Actress}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Original Screenplay}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Adapted Screenplay}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Ibero-American Film}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best European Film}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best New Director}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Animated Film}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best Cinematography}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Editing}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Art Direction}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Production Supervision}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Sound}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Special Effects}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Costume Design}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best Makeup and Hairstyles}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best Original Score}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best Original Song}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best Fictional Short Film}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best Animated Short Film}}\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"||Best Documentary Film}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\"| |Best Documentary Short Film}}\n|}\nHonorary Goya\nOn 29 July 2025, director, screenwriter, producer, writer, sports journalist, and actor Gonzalo Suárez was announced as the recipient of the Honorary Goya Award.
