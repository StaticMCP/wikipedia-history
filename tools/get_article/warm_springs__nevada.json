It is located at the junction of U.S. Route 6 and State Route 375 (the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\"), around 50 miles east of Tonopah. Only two abandoned buildings remain.\nHistory\nThe first white settlement in Warm Springs was in 1866, when it served as a stopover for stagecoaches and other travellers.\nThe post office was in operation from January 1924 through June 1929.\nThe population was 9 in 1940.\nIn 1947, the springs was purchased by the Fallini brothers and it was reported that Thomas Hurt had been operating the springs for several years.\nNever more than a tiny settlement, Warm Springs' population dwindled until it became a ghost town. All that remained was a single streetlight, a telephone box, and several huts built over pools filled by the warm springs that give the town its name.\nClimate\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/nv/warmsprings.htm Warm Springs ghost town info]\n* [http://www.pupfish.net/dsac/railroadvalley/c_ws01_1994.htm Photos of Warm Springs in 1994]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WdXZZkpuB8 Warm Springs Video Nov 2006]"
