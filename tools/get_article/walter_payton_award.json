The honor was first given  in 1987 to the outstanding player in the division, but in 1995, eligibility was restricted to offensive players, as the Buck Buchanan Award for defensive players was inaugurated.\nThe award was named in honor of National Football League (NFL) legend Walter Payton, who starred at Jackson State University in the early 1970s.\nUp until presentations for the 2014 season, the Payton and Buchanan Awards were awarded by The Sports Network. Since STATS LLC, now known as Stats Perform, acquired The Sports Network in February 2015, it has presented all of the major FCS awards.\nThe most recent winner of the award is Tommy Mellott, a quarterback from Montana State who earned the honor during the 2024 season.\n]]\nArmanti Edwards was the first player to win the award more than once (2008, 2009).\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
