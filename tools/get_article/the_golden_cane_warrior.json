While it depicts martial arts and violence, the film also explores themes such as loyalty, integrity, ambition, and betrayal.\nPlot\nCempaka is a silat master known as the Golden Cane Warrior. She had four disciples: Biru, Gerhana, Dara and Angin; all of whom are children of enemies she defeated. In deteriorating health, Cempaka names Dara as her successor, but before teaching Dara her ultimate technique Cempaka is ambushed by Biru and Gerhana who want her powerful Golden Cane for themselves. Cempaka fights them to her death, allowing time for Dara and Angin to flee.\nBiru and Gerhana pursue Dara and Angin, who fall from a cliff during a fight and are saved by a mysterious man called Elang.  Dara and Angin decide to seek Cempaka's former partner, the White Dragon Warrior, who could teach Dara the ultimate technique of the golden cane.  However, Elang says they are not yet ready. Tricked into thinking Dara and Angin are responsible for Cempaka's death, the Red Wing Warriors capture Angin.  Dara trades the Golden Cane to Biru and Gerhana for Angin's release, but they break the deal and Angin is killed saving Dara.\nBiru and Gerhana take over the Red Wing Warriors by poisoning their leader, in the same manner that they had poisoned Cempaka. Dara sneaks into their compound to avenge Angin and Cempaka, but Elang intervenes, believing she is not yet ready to fight them. Elang apologizes for not helping, being honour bound not to have anything to do with Cempaka. He is revealed to be the son of Cempaka and the White Dragon Warrior, who is now dead, leaving Elang the only person who knows the ultimate technique.  The technique can only be performed by two warriors, and Dara realizes that Angin was intended to be trained alongside her. Breaking the promise to his father and the advice of the high council, Elang agrees to take Dara as his disciple.  Meanwhile, Biru and Gerhana transform the Red Wing Warriors into the Golden Cane Warriors, and become lovers.\nSome time later, Dara and Elang invade the compound and, denied a peaceful surrender of the Golden Cane, challenge Biru and Gerhana to fight. Dara pauses from fighting when Gerhana's daughter walks out, not wanting to traumatize her; Gerhana uses the incident to catch Dara off-guard but Dara kills her.  Biru becomes enraged and blindly attacks but falls from a blow, allowing Dara to retrieve the Golden Cane. In its place, Biru attacks them with a tree trunk.  However, Dara and Elang spin with the Golden Cane, performing its ultimate technique which kills Biru with a single blow.\nDara and Elang kiss and embrace, admitting their feelings.  However, the next morning Elang departs and talks to the leader of the high council, his uncle, submitting to punishment for breaking his promise.  Dara returns to Cempaka's old barn and teaches martial arts to Biru and Gerhana's daughter, continuing Cempaka's tradition.\nCast\nThe main cast are (with Chinese names):\n* Eva Celia as Dara (達拉)\n* Nicholas Saputra as Elang (鷹光)\n* Reza Rahadian as Biru (比魯)\n* Tara Basro as Gerhana (日食)\n*  as Angin (風雲.)\n* Christine Hakim as Cempaka (酒店)\n* Slamet Rahardjo as High Council Leader (高級議會領袖)\n* Darius Sinathrya as The White Dragon Warrior (白龍)\n* Prisia Nasution as Young Cempaka (小酒店)\n*  as Master of the Red Wing Warriors (紅翼戰士大師.)\nProduction\nThe film was directed by Ifa Isfansyah, who previously received critical acclaim for his direction of Sang Penari.
