The bureau is under the purview of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Assistance, Humanitarian Affairs and Religious Freedom.\nHistory\nThe bureau was formerly known as the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, but was reorganized and renamed in 1994, to reflect both a broader sweep and a more focused approach to the interlocking issues of human rights, worker rights, and democracy.\nFrom 2011 to 2015, DRL provided financial support to the Tor network (The Onion Router).\nIn 1982, the State Department asserted that \"Where it has been possible to assign responsibility [for killings in Guatemala] it appears more likely that in the majority of cases the insurgents … have been guilty.\" However, US intelligence reports found the opposite.\nFunctions\nDRL's responsibilities include promoting democracy in U.S. and around the world, formulating U.S. human rights policies, and coordinating policy in human rights-related labor issues.  The Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism is a separate agency included in the Bureau.\nThe Bureau is responsible for producing annual reports on the countries of the world with regard to religious freedom through its Office of International Religious Freedom and human rights. It also administers the U.S. Human Rights and Democracy Fund (HRDF), which is DRL's flagship program.\nExamples of DRL's human rights advocacy in foreign locations include China, the Middle East, and Russia.\nOrganization\nThe head of the Bureau is the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, currently Riley Barnes.\nThe Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor is divided into six offices.\n*Office of Natural Rights\n*Office of Reports and Sanctions – Prepares the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights\n*Office of Free Markets and Fair Labor\n*Office of International Religious Freedom – Supports the United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom\n*Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons\n*Office to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-foreign-assistance-humanitarian-affairs-and-religious-freedom/bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/ Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor] official website\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160706014527/http://www.humanrights.gov/ HumanRights.gov]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/stateDRL Official page on Facebook]\n*[http://www.allgov.com/departments/department-of-state/bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor?agencyid=7196 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor] on AllGov.com"
