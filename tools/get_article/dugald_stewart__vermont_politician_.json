He graduated from Middlebury College in 1842, studied law and attained admission to the bar.\nRather than practicing law Stewart opted for a business career, becoming an accountant and paymaster for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad, where he worked from 1848 to 1855.\nFrom 1855 until his death Stewart was Clerk of the Courts in Addison County.\nStewart served in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1860 to 1862.  He also served in local offices, including Justice of the Peace.\nDuring the American Civil War Stewart served in the Vermont Militia as Judge Advocate of the 1st Brigade with the rank of First Lieutenant.\nIn 1864 Stewart was named State Auditor, and he held the position until his death in Middlebury on March 23, 1870.  Stewart was buried in Middlebury's West Cemetery.\nReferences"
