It was the seventh event under the Battle Riot chronology.\nProduction\nBackground\nBattle Riot is an annual event produced by Major League Wrestling that was first held in 2018 as a television taping for MLW Fusion. The event is named after the Battle Riot match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner. The match begins with a number of participants in the ring, who are then eliminated by either pin, submission, or going over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor. The declared winner of the Battle Riot match receives a \"golden ticket\", which they can redeem for a future MLW World Heavyweight Championship title shot anytime and anywhere, however in this year, World Heavyweight Championship will be on the line in this Battle Riot.\nOn December 2, 2024, it was announced that Battle Riot VII would take place on April 5, 2025, at the Commerce Casino & Hotel in Commerce, California. On March 21, 2025, MLW decided to move the event to larger Thunder Studios Arena in Long Beach, California.\nStorylines\nThe card will consist of matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers.\nAt SuperFight 6, after Matt Riddle defended the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Satoshi Kojima and Alex Kane, he was confronted by the executive producer for the night Eric Bischoff on the video wall. Bischoff was unhappy with Riddle, who went over Bischoff and made the match himself; Bischoff had previously fired Kane at One Shot the past December, but Riddle circumvented that decision by bringing Kane back through MLW's \"Open Door\" policy. As such, Bischoff retaliated by declaring that, for the first time, Riddle would defend the MLW World Heavyweight Championship at Battle Riot VII in the titular match.\nAt SuperFight 6, MLW announced that Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling (TJPW) wrestler Shoko Nakajima would make her MLW debut at Battle Riot VII. A few weeks later on MLW's website, the company confirmed that Nakajima would challenge Delmi Exo for the MLW World Women's Featherweight Championship at the event.\nAt SuperFight 6, MLW World Middleweight Champion Místico teamed with Máscara Dorada to face Templario and Esfinge. The match ended with the latter team victorious, with Templario pinning Místico. This marked the first time Místico had ever been pinned in MLW. Immediately after, Cesar Duran came out to speak with Templario, who put out a challenge to Místico for the MLW World Middleweight Championship. Duran proposed the match for Battle Riot VII, which Místico accepted. The match was made official via MLW's website on March 4. On May 4, however, MLW announced that the match would be cancelled due to Místico sustaining an injury. A three-way match between Templario, Esfinge, and Hechicero would replace the title match, with Místico still appearing at the event for a live interview.\nResults\n| match1 = Atlantis, Atlantis Jr., and Star Jr. defeated Último Guerrero, Bárbaro Cavernario, and Magnus by pinfall\n| stip1 = Trios match\n| time1 = 11:48\n| match2 = Janai Kai defeated Himawari by pinfall\n| stip2 = Singles match\n| time2 = 7:24\n| match3 = Templario defeated Hechicero and Esfinge by submission\n| stip3 = Three-way match\n| time3 = 9:51\n| match4 = Shoko Nakajima defeated Delmi Exo (c) by pinfall\n| stip4 = Singles match for the MLW World Women's Featherweight Championship\n| time4 = 9:15\n| match5 = Matt Riddle (c) won by last eliminating Rob Van Dam\n| stip5 = 40-man Battle Riot match for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship\n| time5 = 1:06:31\n}}\nBattle Riot match entrances and eliminations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Draw\n!Entrant\n!Order\n!Eliminated by\n!Method of elimination\n!Elimination(s)\n|-\n|1||Alex Hammerstone||28||Matt Riddle||Over the top rope||7\n|-\n|2||Raj Dhesi||16||Alex Hammerstone||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|3||Atlantis Jr.||2||Magnus||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|4||Virus||1||Raj Dhesi||Pinfall||0\n|-\n|5||Jesús Rodríguez||14||Alex Hammerstone||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|6||Star Jr.||5||Alex Hammerstone||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|7||Esfinge||6||Alex Hammerstone||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|8||Ikuro Kwon||3||Alex Hammerstone||Submission||0\n|-\n|9||Bárbaro Cavernario||4||Alex Hammerstone||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|10||Blue Panther||10||Hechicero||Pinfall||1\n|-\n|11||Magnus||11||Jesús Rodríguez||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|12||Juicy Finau||15||Alex Hammerstone||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|13||Último Guerrero||8||Blue Panther||Submission||1\n|-\n|14||Atlantis||7||Último Guerrero||Submission||0\n|-\n|15||Hechicero||12||Mr. Thomas||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|16||Okumura||9||Mr. Thomas||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|17||Ariel Dominguez||13||Mr. Thomas||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|18||Mr. Thomas||18||Matt Riddle||Over the top rope||3\n|-\n|19||Journey Fatu||17||Alex Hammerstone||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|20||Bobby Fish||19||Paul Walter Hauser and Paul London||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|21||C.
