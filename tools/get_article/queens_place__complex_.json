Upon completion, they will be amongst the tallest buildings in Melbourne, and the tallest twin skyscrapers in Australia.\nThe 350 Queen Street site, which hosts KTS House –a 21-story office building– was purchased by Chinese developers 3L Alliance in October 2014, for $135 million. In 2015, 3L Alliance submitted plans through Fender Katsalidis Architects and Cox Architecture for two residential skyscrapers reaching heights of  and , respectively, and to comprise 1,700 apartments across 79 levels. These plans would retain the KTS House commercial skyscraper, which would sit in between the twin skyscrapers.\nIn October 2015, the project received planning approval by the City of Melbourne, before being approved by the Minister for Planning Richard Wynne in March 2016. Construction on the North Tower commenced in January 2018 and was completed in 2021.\nSee also\n* List of tallest buildings in Melbourne\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.queensplacemelbourne.com/ Official website]"
