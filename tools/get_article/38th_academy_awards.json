They were hosted by Bob Hope, and were the first Oscars to be broadcast live in color. Lynda Bird Johnson, daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson, attended the ceremony, escorted by actor George Hamilton.\nThe most successful films of the year were The Sound of Music and Doctor Zhivago, each with ten nominations and five wins, with the former winning Best Picture. Both films are in the top 10 inflation-adjusted  commercially successful films ever made, and both would go on to appear on the American Film Institute list of the greatest American films of the twentieth century.\nThe Sound of Music was the first Best Picture winner without a screenwriting nomination since Hamlet, and would be the last until Titanic at the 70th Academy Awards. Othello became the third film (of four to date) to receive four acting nominations without one for Best Picture. William Wyler received the last of his record twelve Best Director nominations for The Collector.\nAwards\nNominees were announced on February 21, 1966. Winners are listed first and highlighted with boldface.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Directing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'The Sound of Music – Robert Wise, producer'\n** Darling – Joseph Janni, producer\n** Doctor Zhivago – Carlo Ponti, producer\n** Ship of Fools – Stanley Kramer, producer\n** A Thousand Clowns – Fred Coe, producer\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Robert Wise&nbsp;– The Sound of Music'\n** William Wyler&nbsp;– The Collector\n** John Schlesinger&nbsp;– Darling\n** David Lean&nbsp;– Doctor Zhivago\n** Hiroshi Teshigahara&nbsp;– Woman in the Dunes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actor\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Lee Marvin&nbsp;– Cat Ballou as Kid Shelleen / Tim Strawn'\n** Richard Burton&nbsp;– The Spy Who Came In from the Cold as Alec Leamas\n** Laurence Olivier&nbsp;– Othello as Othello\n** Rod Steiger&nbsp;– The Pawnbroker as Sol Nazerman\n** Oskar Werner&nbsp;– Ship of Fools as Dr. Wilhelm \"Willi\" Schumann\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Julie Christie&nbsp;– Darling as Diana Scott'\n** Julie Andrews&nbsp;– The Sound of Music as Maria von Trapp\n** Samantha Eggar&nbsp;– The Collector as Miranda Grey\n** Elizabeth Hartman&nbsp;– A Patch of Blue as Selina D'Arcey\n** Simone Signoret&nbsp;– Ship of Fools as La Condesa\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actress in a Supporting Role\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Martin Balsam&nbsp;– A Thousand Clowns as Arnold Burns'\n** Ian Bannen&nbsp;– The Flight of the Phoenix as \"Ratbags\" Crow\n** Tom Courtenay&nbsp;– Doctor Zhivago as Pavel \"Pasha\" Antipov\n** Michael Dunn&nbsp;– Ship of Fools as Carl Glocken\n** Frank Finlay&nbsp;– Othello as Iago\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Shelley Winters&nbsp;– A Patch of Blue'' as Rose-Ann D'Arcey'\n** Ruth Gordon&nbsp;– Inside Daisy Clover as Lucile Clover\n** Joyce Redman&nbsp;– Othello as Emilia\n** Maggie Smith&nbsp;– Othello as Desdemona\n** Peggy Wood&nbsp;– The Sound of Music as the Mother Abbess\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Writing (Story and Screenplay -- Written Directly for the Screen)\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Writing (Screenplay -- Based on Material from Another Medium)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Darling&nbsp;– Frederic Raphael'\n** Casanova 70''&nbsp;– Agenore Incrocci, Furio Scarpelli, Mario Monicelli, Tonino Guerra, Giorgio Salvioni and Suso Cecchi d'Amico\n** Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&nbsp;– Jack Davies and Ken Annakin\n** The Train&nbsp;– Franklin Coen and Frank Davis\n** The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&nbsp;– Jacques Demy\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Doctor Zhivago&nbsp;– Robert Bolt from Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak'\n** Cat Ballou&nbsp;– Walter Newman and Frank Pierson from The Ballad of Cat Ballou by Roy Chanslor\n** The Collector&nbsp;– Stanley Mann and John Kohn from The Collector by John Fowles\n** Ship of Fools&nbsp;– Abby Mann from Ship of Fools by Katherine Anne Porter\n** A Thousand Clowns&nbsp;– Herb Gardner from A Thousand Clowns by Herb Gardner\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Foreign Language Film\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Documentary (Feature)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'The Shop on Main Street (Czechoslovakia)'\n** Blood on the Land (Greece)\n** Dear John (Sweden)\n** Kwaidan (Japan)\n** Marriage Italian Style (Italy)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Eleanor Roosevelt Story\n** The Battle of the Bulge...
