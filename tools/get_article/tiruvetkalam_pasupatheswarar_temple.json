One day, Arjuna spotted a wild boar speeding to attack him. While he shot the boar with an arrow, another hunter also claimed that he was the first to shoot the beast. A fight of superiority started between the two. Arjuna attacked the hunter with an arrow, the impact of which was felt by all beings in the world. The hunter then tossed Arjuna with his toe, who fell in Krupa Samudram. It took Arjuna time to realise that it was Shiva in the form of the hunter who attacked him. Parvati, the consort of Shiva was angry at Arjuna for hitting her husband, but Shiva pacified her. They both granted boons to Arjuna, a weapon named Pasupatham. Since Shiva granted Pasupatham at this place, he came to be known as Pasupatheeswarar. Periyapuranam, the 11th century compilation of the Nayanmars has details about Sambandar visiting the place after coming via Thillai Nataraja Temple.\nArchitecture\nPaasupatheeswarar temple is located in Annamalai Nagar, a place  from Chidambaram and inside the premises of Annamalai University. The temple has a three tiered rajagopuram on the eastern side with concentric rectangular walls surrounding the temple. The sanctum is approached through a pillared hall called mukha mandapa and an artha mandapa. The shrine of the goddess is located in the mukhamandapa facing south. The presiding deity in the form of lingam (an iconic form of Shiva) is located in the sanctum. There is a circumabulatory passage around the shrines. The pillars in the hall leading to the sanctum has sculpted images depicting various Hindu legends. The pillared halls in the hall has legends of Arjuna doing penance. The image of Parvati with her hair unlocked is a notable feature. The metal image of Arjuna getting Pasupathasra from Shiva is housed in the temple.\nReligious importance and festivals\nSambandar, an 8th-century Tamil Shaiva saint poet, venerated Uchinathar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai.
