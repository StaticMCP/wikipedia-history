This was a response to Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales, and her deputies Melchor Arthur Carandang and Rodolfo Elman pursuing a fact-finding investigation on Duterte's alleged illegal bank deposits worth at least  as stated by Senator Antonio Trillanes. Duterte earlier said he would create a commission to have Carpio-Morales and her deputies investigated for possible abuse of power. The PACC enables the President to conduct lifestyle checks and fact-finding on public officials and employees.\nOn December 28, 2018, Duterte issued Executive Order No. 73 which mandates the PACC to recommend complaints of violation against the Anti-Red Tape Act to the Anti-Red Tape Authority.\nIn September 2021, the National Anti-Corruption Coordinating Council (NACC), a child agency under the PACC, was formed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. The NACC launched the Project Kasangga: Aksyon Kontra Korapsyon, an initiative to improve the detection of anomalous transactions amidst scrutiny on the utilization of the government's funds for the pandemic response by the Duterte administration.\nImmediately after assuming the presidency on June 30, 2022, Duterte's successor, President Bongbong Marcos, abolished the PACC through Executive Order No. 1, as part of a reorganization of agencies under the Office of the President in \"abolishing duplicated and overlapping official functions\". The PACC's powers and function was transferred to the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs, which shall make recommendations on matters requiring its actions to the Executive Secretary for approval of the President.\nChairpersons\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!rowspan=2|Image\n!rowspan=2|Name\n!colspan=2|Term\n!rowspan=2|Ref.\n|-\n!Start\n!End\n|-\n|\n| || January 12, 2018 || January 29, 2021 ||\n|-\n|\n| || March 15, 2021 || October 8, 2021 ||\n|-\n|\n|Fortunato Guerrero || December 29, 2021 || June 30, 2022 ||\n|}\nCommissioners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term\n|-\n!Start\n!End\n|-\n|Rickson Chiong || January 12, 2018 || June 30, 2022\n|-\n|Yvette Contacto\n|September 18, 2020\n|June 30, 2022\n|-\n|Atty, Baldr Bringas\n|December 29, 2021\n|June 30, 2022\n|-\n|Jayvee Hinlo\n|January 25, 2022\n|June 30, 2022\n|-\n|Danilo Yang\n|August 2, 2020\n|May 31, 2021\n|-\n| || January 12, 2018 || March 14, 2021\n|-\n|Gregorio Luis Contacto III\n|January 12, 2018\n|April 20, 2020\n|-\n|Atty.
