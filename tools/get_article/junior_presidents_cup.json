It is based around the Presidents Cup and is run by the PGA Tour and American Junior Golf Association. The inaugural event took place at the Plainfield Country Club, Edison, New Jersey on September 25 and 26, 2017. The United States have won all four events that have been contested.\nQualification\nThe teams consist of 12 junior boys. Participants must be at least 12 years old at the start of the event and must be 18 or younger and have not yet graduated high school as of January 1 of the year of the contest. Players must be amateurs who have not yet started college and are not members of a competitive collegiate golf program. Members of each team mostly qualify through a ranking system, the United States team based on the Rolex AJGA Rankings, and the International Team based on the World Amateur Golf Rankings.\nIn 2017 11 members of each team were selected based on the rankings on August 3 with the final place being given to the leading player in the rankings, not already qualified, on September 6. In 2019 all 12 members of the team were selected based on the rankings on September 5. In 2022 10 members of each team were selected based on the rankings on August 19, with one player selected by the team captain and the final place being given to the leading player in the rankings, not already qualified, on September 8.\nFormat\nThe event is held over two days, with six fourballs and six foursomes matches on the first day, and twelve singles matches on the second day.\nResults\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year !!
