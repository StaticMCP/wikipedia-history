The division was formed on January 31, 1915, out of the formerly independent 56th Landwehr Infantry Brigade, which had been dissolved on January 25, 1915.  The division spent the period from its formation to early 1917 mainly involved in positional warfare in Upper Alsace, after which it occupied the trenchlines near Verdun.  It remained in positional warfare in this general region until the end of the war. It participated in no major battles, but was primarily suited to quieter sectors of the line.  Allied intelligence rated the division as a fourth class division, though it noted that \"in the attack it did fairly well, without heavy loss.\" The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nThe 8th Landwehr Division, like the 56th Landwehr Infantry Brigade before it, was raised in the Grand Duchy of Baden.  As a Landwehr division, it was primarily composed of older soldiers who had already fulfilled their regular and reserve service obligations.\nCommanding officers\nThe commanding officers of the 8th Landwehr Division were:\n*Generalleutnant Albert von Bodungen (January 25, 1915 - January 5, 1917)\n*Generalleutnant Otto Hans Eduard Schumann (January 6, 1917 - December 15, 1918)\nOrder of battle on March 12, 1915\nThe order of battle of the division on March 12, 1915, shortly after its formation, was as follows:\n*Badisches Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 109\n*Badisches Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 110\n*Feld-Maschinengewehr-Zug Nr. 27\n*Feld-Maschinengewehr-Zug Nr. 29\n*Festungs-Maschinengewehr-Trupp/Festung Istein\n*Festungs-Maschinengewehr-Trupp/Festung Hüningen\n*2.

The 8th Landwehr Division, originally not much bigger than a reinforced brigade, received a third infantry regiment and was reorganized as a standard German infantry division.  An artillery command and a divisional signals command were created. The 8th Landwehr Division's order of battle on January 4, 1918, was as follows:\n*56. Landwehr-Infanterie-Brigade\n**Badisches Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 109\n**Badisches Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 110\n**Badisches Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 111\n*1.
