The XP-72 was designed around the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major 28-cylinder air-cooled radial engine with a supercharger mounted behind the pilot and driven by an extension shaft from the engine. The armament consisted of six .50 caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) wing-mounted Browning AN/M2 machine guns and underwing racks for two 1,000 lb bombs; Alternative armament packages included two 37&nbsp;mm M4 autocannons with four .50 caliber AN/M2s, or four M4 autocannons.\nDesign and development\nThe XP-72 development paralleled that of another Republic design, the XP-69 that was to be powered by an experimental 42-cylinder Wright R-2160 liquid-cooled radial engine mounted in the nose of the aircraft and driving contra-rotating propellers. The XP-69 was intended for high altitude operations and featured a pressurized cockpit and armament of two 37&nbsp;mm cannon and four 50 caliber machine guns. As the XP-72 displayed greater promise than the XP-69, the XP-69 was canceled on 11 May 1943 and an order for two XP-72 prototypes was placed on 18 June 1943.\nOperational history\nThe XP-72 flew for the first time on 2 February 1944, equipped with a four-bladed propeller. The second prototype was completed on 26 June 1944 and was equipped with an Aero-Products contra-rotating propeller. As the XP-72 displayed exceptional performance during flight tests, an order for 100 production aircraft was awarded. The order included an alternate armament configuration of four 37&nbsp;mm cannon. By this time, World War II had progressed to where the need was for long-range escort fighters and not high-speed interceptors. Furthermore, the advent of the new turbojet-powered interceptors showed greater promise for the interceptor role. Thus, the production order for the P-72 was canceled.\nSpecifications (XP-72)\n|crew=One\n|length ft=36\n|length in=7\n|length m=11.15\n|span ft=40\n|span in=11\n|span m=12.47\n|height ft=16\n|height m=4.88\n|wing area sqft=300\n|wing area sqm=27.9\n|empty weight lb=11476\n|empty weight kg=5216\n|gross weight lb=14433\n|gross weight kg=6560\n|max takeoff weight lb=17490\n|max takeoff weight kg=7950\n|eng1 name=Pratt & Whitney R-4360-13\n|eng1 type=radial engine\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 hp=3500\n|eng1 note=(dash 13 engine)\n|max speed mph=490\n|max speed kmh=789\n|max speed note= 387mph (623 km/h at sea level)\n|range miles=1200\n|range km=1932\n|ceiling ft=42000\n|ceiling m=12805\n|climb rate ftmin=5280\n|climb rate ms=26.8\n|wing loading lb/sqft=48.1\n|power/mass=0.24 hp/lb (0.39 kW/kg)\n|armament=\n* 6× 50 caliber Browning machine guns\nor\n* 2x 37mm M4 cannons and 4x 50 caliber Browning machine guns\nor\n* 4x 37mm M4 cannons\n* 2× 1,000 lb (476&nbsp;kg) bombs\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n* Bodie, Warren. \"The Whine of the Jug\".
