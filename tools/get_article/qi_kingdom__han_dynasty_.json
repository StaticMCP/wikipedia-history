In 206 BC, Xiang Yu divided the Qin empire into Eighteen Kingdoms. Three of them – Qi, Jiaodong and Jibei – were founded on Qi territories and were ruled by the former state's aristocrats. In 203 BC, the region was conquered by Han Xin, a prominent military general serving under Liu Bang, the later Emperor Gaozu of Han dynasty. Han Xin was briefly granted the title \"King of Qi\", but was later offered Chu instead.\nIn 201 BC, Emperor Gaozu installed his eldest son Liu Fei as the King of Qi, known posthumously as King Daohui. According to an order by Emperor Gaozu, \"All the people who are able to speak the language of Qi shall be granted to Qi [Kingdom].\" At the time, Qi consisted of seven commanderies, namely Linzi, Boyang, Jibei, Jiaodong, Jiaoxi, Chengyang and Langya.\nAfter the death of Emperor Gaozu, the Han court was dominated by Empress Lü. In 193 BC, Liu Fei offered Chengyang to Princess Yuan of Lu, daughter of Empress Lü, as her fief. In 187 BC, a part of Jinan was split off to form the Kingdom of Lü, ruled by the empress' nephew Lü Tai (呂台). In 181 BC, Langya was also separated from Qi to form a new kingdom held by Liu Ze (劉澤), nephew-in-law of the empress.\nLiu Fei died in 189 BC and was succeeded by his son Xiang. In 180 BC, Qi participated in the war against the Lü clan. Afterwards, the three commanderies Chengyang, Jinan and Langya was returned to the kingdom. Qi passed to Liu Ze (劉則), a son of Xiang, after the latter's death in 179 BC. Xiang's brothers Zhang and Xingju received Jibei and Chengyang, respectively, as their own kingdoms. Jibei was revoked by the Han government when Xingju attempted to rebel in 177 BC.\nZe died in 165 BC, leaving no male issue. Qi was subsequently divided between Fei's surviving sons. The territory under Liu Jianglü (劉將閭) retained the name \"Qi\", however, it only covered the Linzi Commandery. Jianglü's line continued until 126 BC. In 117 BC, the reigning Emperor Wu granted Qi to his son Liu Hong (劉閎), who also died without issue in 110 BC. Afterwards, the kingdom was converted to the Qi Commandery.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!In Chinese\n!Posthumous name\n!In Chinese\n!Reigned from\n!Reigned to\n|-\n|Liu Fei\n|劉肥\n|King Daohui of Qi\n|齊悼惠王\n|201 BC\n|189 BC\n|-\n|Liu Xiang\n|劉襄\n|King Ai of Qi\n|齊哀王\n|189 BC\n|179 BC\n|-\n|Liu Ze\n|劉則\n|King Wen of Qi\n|齊文王\n|179 BC\n|165 BC\n|-\n|Liu Jianglü\n|劉將閭\n|King Xiao of Qi\n|齊孝王\n|164 BC\n|154 BC\n|-\n|Liu Shou\n|劉壽\n|King Yi of Qi\n|齊懿王\n|154 BC\n|131 BC\n|-\n|Liu Cichang\n|劉次昌\n|King Li of Qi\n|齊厲王\n|131 BC\n|126 BC\n|-\n|Liu Hong\n|劉閎\n|King Huai of Qi\n|齊懷王\n|117 BC\n|110 BC\n|}\nReferences"
