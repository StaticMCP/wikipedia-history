For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n51 & 52 Vict.\nThe third session of the 24th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 9 February 1888 until 24 December 1888.\nPublic general acts\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n| or the Ashbourne Land Act|public|13|28-06-1888|archived=n|An Act to amend Section One of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887, in regard to Leaseholders.}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  in respect to voting by Proxy.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  with reference to certain societies now subject to the provisions of section thirty of that Act.|note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n| |note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and to enable the Commissioners of Police of the burgh of Govan, in the county of Lanark, to apply certain funds arising under that Act to the maintenance of a public Park now vested in them, and to the erection and maintenance of public Halls and other buildings for the said burgh; and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  and to make further provision with reference to the Company's Capital and for other purposes.}}\n|\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|  and the Metropolitan Commons Amendment Act, 1869, relating to Farnborough Common, Broadstreet Green, Leach's Green and Green Street Green.|po1=Farnborough Common, Broadstreet Green, Leach's Green and Green Street Green Scheme.|po1short=n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n-\n|\n|  as amended and extended by the Poor Law Act, 1879, relating to the Parishes of Asheldam, Black Notley, Bradwell near Coggeshall, Cressing, Dengie, Fairstead, Feering, Goldhanger, Great Coggeshall, Great Totham, Kelvedon, Langford, Little Coggeshall, Little Totham, Mayland, Pattiswicke, Purleigh, Rivenhall , Saint Lawrence, Saint Mary's, Saint Peter's, Southminster, Steeple, Stisted, Stow Maries, Terling, Tollesbury, Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Tolleshunt Knights, Tolleshunt Major, Ulting, White Notley, and Wickham Bishop.|po1=Black Notley, &c.
