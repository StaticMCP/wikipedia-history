As an amateur, he won a men's super heavyweight bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nBackground\nDokiwari is a descendant of the Kalabari people of the Niger Delta of Rivers State, Nigeria. He is a son of the Horsfall and David-West group of houses in Buguma, in the Asaritoru Local Government Area of Rivers State. Dokiwari is the fifth of eight children raised by their mother and grandmother. As a child, he played different sports ranging from track and fields, soccer, badminton, powerlifting, to volleyball, which has been evident in his agility and strength as a boxer.\nDokiwari attended Port Harcout Primary School and Akpor Grammar School Ozuoba.\nDokiwari graduated with degrees in criminal justice and advertising from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in the summer of 2008. He is an avid reader whose reading interest include philosophy, history, English literature, law and justice, as well as religious literature.\nAmateur career\nDokiwari came out of the same Nigerian amateur boxing program that produced the likes of Peter Konyegwache, David Izon, Richard Igbeneghu, Ike Ibeabuchi, and Friday Ahunanya.\nAs a boxer Dokiwari was a late comer to the sport. He did not lace a pair of gloves until months after his 18th birthday. Within a span of five years from 1991 through 1996 Dokiwari rose from a virtually unknown in Nigerian boxing circle to become the country's foremost amateur boxing star. Dokiwari won the prestigious Eagle Belt champion of champions title consecutively between 1994 and 1995 in Lagos, Nigeria. Between 1993 through 1996 Duncan was Nigerian super heavyweight champion.\nDokiwari won the gold medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. A year later he defeated the Cubans in Cuba by winning the gold medal at the Guama Cup International Boxing Championships. Also in 1995, he was proclaimed the African Boxer of the Year after winning the title at the African Games in Harare, Zimbabwe, where he knocked out all his opponents in the first round.\n*Gold Medalist at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Australia.\n**Emilio Leti (Samoa) won by TKO 1\n**Danny Williams (England) won on points\n**David Anyim (Kenya) won on points\n*Represented Nigeria as a Super Heavyweight at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.\n**Mohammad Reza Samadi (Iran) won by TKO 2\n**Safarish Khan (Pakistan) won by TKO 2\n**Adalat Mamedov (Azerbaijan) won by TKO 3\n**Paea Wolfgramm (Tonga) lost on points, this was a semi-final match, and with the loss Dokiwari won a bronze medal.\nProfessional career\nDokiwari's boxing career has been plagued with disputes with promoters and managers since turning professional in July 1997. Dokiwari's boxing skill has been honed by reputable trainer such as Eddie Futch, Thell Torrence, and Mike McCallum. Duncan dropped a decision to Fres Oquendo early in his career, and after running off 10 consecutive victories, dropped a unanimous decision to Dominick Guinn. A year after the loss to Guinn, Dokiwari was stunningly TKO'd in the first by unknown Stacy Frazier. Despite the loss, he continued his boxing career recording impressive wins against tough opposition. In December 2006 Dokiwari won the WBC USNBC Heavyweight title with an impressive 4th-round knockout of strong and durable Wllie Palms in Laughlin, Nevada. With the victory Dokiwari became the first man to stop Palms.\nOutside the ring Dokiwari was also featured in the motion picture \"Undisputed\" with Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames.\nProfessional boxing record\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=8|25 Wins (22 knockouts, 3 decisions), 3 Losses (1 knockout, 2 decisions) [http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=14747&cat=boxer]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Result\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Record\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Opponent\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Type\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Round\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Date\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Location\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Notes\n|-align=center\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Willie Palms\n|TKO\n|4\n|01/12/2006\n|align=left| Avi Resort & Casino, Laughlin, Nevada\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Kerry Biles\n|KO\n|2\n|08/10/2006\n|align=left| Marriott Arena, Junction City, Kansas\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Patrick Smith\n|KO\n|2\n|26/08/2006\n|align=left| Junction City Convention Center, Junction City, Kansas\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Loss\n|\n|align=left| Stacy Frazier\n|TKO\n|1\n|02/10/2004\n|align=left| Caesars Palace, Paradise, Nevada\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Loss\n|\n|align=left| Dominick Guinn\n|UD\n|10\n|27/09/2003\n|align=left| HSBC Arena, Buffalo, New York\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Carlton Johnson\n|TKO\n|3\n|26 Apr 2003\n|align=left| Foxwoods, Mashantucket, Connecticut\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Andy Sample\n|TKO\n|1\n|07/11/2002\n|align=left| Centennial Garden, Bakersfield, California\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Tali Kulihaapai\n|TKO\n|1\n|16/10/2002\n|align=left| Marriott Hotel, Irvine, California\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Armando Rodríguez\n|TKO\n|2\n|26/09/2002\n|align=left| Compaq Center, San Jose, California\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| David Vedder\n|UD\n|8\n|08/08/2002\n|align=left| Centennial Garden, Bakersfield, California\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Tim Knight\n|KO\n|5\n|20 Jul 2002\n|align=left| Conseco Fieldhouse, Indianapolis, Indiana\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Mike Sedillo\n|KO\n|2\n|27/06/2002\n|align=left| Marriott Hotel, Irvine, California\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Agustin Corpus\n|UD\n|6\n|23/10/1999\n|align=left| MGM Grand Garden Arena, Paradise, Nevada\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Matthew Brooks\n|TKO\n|1\n|25/07/1999\n|align=left| Harrah's Casino, Kansas City, Missouri\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Clement Hassan\n|TKO\n|1\n|03/04/1999\n|align=left| The New Frontier, Paradise, Nevada\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Loss\n|\n|align=left| Fres Oquendo\n|UD\n|6\n|16/01/1999\n|align=left| MGM Grand Garden Arena, Paradise, Nevada\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Miguel Otero\n|UD\n|4\n|03/12/1998\n|align=left| Casino Magic, Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Rowyan Wallace\n|TKO\n|1\n|23/10/1998\n|align=left| Trump Marina, Atlantic City, New Jersey\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Otis Tisdale\n|KO\n|1\n|19/05/1998\n|align=left| Memorial Coliseum, Corpus Christi, Texas\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Larry Cureton\n|KO\n|1\n|17/04/1998\n|align=left| Mohegan Sun, Uncasville, Connecticut\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Joseph Kenneth Reyes\n|TKO\n|1\n|31/01/1998\n|align=left| Trump Taj Majal, Atlantic City, New Jersey\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Mike Middleton\n|TKO\n|1\n|18/11/1997\n|align=left| Show Place Arena, Upper Marlboro, Maryland\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Doug Phillips\n|TKO\n|1\n|03/10/1997\n|align=left| The Tropicana, Atlantic City, New Jersey\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Derrick Edwards\n|KO\n|1\n|12/09/1997\n|align=left| Pikesville Armory, Pikesville, Maryland\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Jesse Shaw\n|KO\n|1\n|23/08/1997\n|align=left| Wild Wild West Casino, Atlantic City, New Jersey\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Donnell Cummings\n|TKO\n|1\n|09/08/1997\n|align=left| South Padre Island, Texas\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Shidevin Brown\n|TKO\n|2\n|20/07/1997\n|align=left| Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, Indio, California\n|align=left|\n|-\n|Win\n|\n|align=left| Stanley Wooten\n|KO\n|1\n|05/07/1997\n|align=left| MARK of the Quad Cities, Moline, Illinois\n|align=left|\n|}\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
