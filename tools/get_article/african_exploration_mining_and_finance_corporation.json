It has been granted mining and prospecting rights, in competition with other mining companies. AEMFC is, officially, subsidiary to the Central Energy Fund.\nIn February 2011, the AEMFC launched a coal mining project in Mpumalanga, which is expected to produce 1.68 million tons of coal per year.\n, AEMFC was still loss-making, but gets interest-free loans from the Central Energy Fund (R209M as of 2016). Performance of its coal, limestone, and uranium mines has been disappointing.  It moved into profit, by March 2013 stating a profit of R77M per year, and an equity of R490K, despite a loss of 54 409 tonnes of uninsured coal which was burned.\nActivities\nAEMFC owns the Vlakfontein coal mine in Ogies which supplies the Kendal Power Station run by Eskom.\nReferences"
