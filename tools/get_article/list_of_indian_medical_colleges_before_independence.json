The year 1600 marked a significant milestone with the arrival of medical officers accompanying the inaugural fleet of ships dispatched by the East India Company. Their presence facilitated the inception of Western medical practices within the Indian subcontinent. Initially, medical departments were established, complete with surgeons, to cater to the healthcare needs of the troops and staff affiliated with the East India Company.\nA pivotal development occurred in 1775 when hospital boards were established, consisting of the Surgeon General and Physician General.

These departments assumed responsibility for the healthcare of both military personnel and British civilians residing in India.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+\n|-\n!
