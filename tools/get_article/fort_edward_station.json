It was originally built as a Delaware and Hudson Railroad depot in 1900, as a replacement for two earlier stations. The first was built in 1840 but was later converted into a store in 1880, the same year it was replaced with a second depot on the existing site. The third and current station has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since December 13, 2000. The station serves both Fort Edward and nearby Glens Falls. It has one low-level side platform to the west of the single track of the Canadian Pacific Railway Canadian Subdivision.\nThe station is served by Amtrak's daily Adirondack and Ethan Allen Express.  The station also is a stop on the CDTA's Route 404 providing bus service to Glens Falls and surrounding communities Monday through Saturdays, as well as seasonal \"train-catcher\" service to Lake George, New York.\nIn March 2020, all Amtrak service at the station was suspended indefinitely, with trains being truncated to Albany–Rensselaer station after Vermont Governor Phil Scott ordered all Amtrak stations in Vermont closed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Ethan Allen Express service between New York City and Rutland, Vermont resumed on July 19, 2021. The Adirondack service between New York City and Montreal resumed daily operations on April 3, 2023.\n, the station is occupied by Evergreen Bicycle Works.\nReferences\nExternal links"
