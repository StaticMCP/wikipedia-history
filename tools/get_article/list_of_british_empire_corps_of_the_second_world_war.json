A combat Corps was composed of specialist units from various \"administrative\" Corps from combat arms, combat support arms and combat services. Combat Arms were formation sized units from the Corps of infantry and armour, usually 2 or more divisions in strength. Combat Support Arms were smaller units from the Corps of artillery, engineers, signals, intelligence or reconnaissance. Combat Services were units from the Corps of medicine, general services, ordnance, pioneers, logistics and other more specialized functions. For example, I Canadian Corps consisted of 1 infantry division, 1 armour division, 1 armour brigade and Corps Troops (20 plus companies from the Corps of engineers, signals, medicine, military police, etc...)\nMilitary formations within the British Empire were composed of a changing mix of units from across Britain, its colonies and the dominions. As a result, military formations within the Empire and Commonwealth are not easily attributable to specific Imperial or national entities and naming conventions do not necessarily correlate with modern country names.\nBritish Army\n;Field Corps\n* I Airborne Corps\n* 1 Anti-Aircraft Corps\n* 2 Anti-Aircraft Corps\n* 3 Anti-Aircraft Corps\n* I Corps\n* II Corps\n* III Corps\n* IV Corps\n* V
