Initiated on 26 November 2004 by the Luhansk Oblast Council, the project was discontinued the next month by the Donetsk Oblast Council. The republic was intended to consist out of nine regions of Ukraine.\nThe idea on creating of the political entity arose at a session of the Luhansk Oblast Council chaired by Viktor Tikhonov and attended by Oleksandr Yefremov. The session adopted a decision to discontinue subordination to the Luhansk State Regional Administration and create a separate executive committee headed by Oleksandr Yefremov. The session also included for revision by the congress of bodies of local self-government and executive power in Southeastern territories of Ukraine a proposition in organization of working group in creation of tax, payment, banking and finance institutions of the Southeastern territories.\nDonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Lukyanchenko, however, stated that no one wanted autonomy, but rather sought to stop Orange Revolution demonstrations going on at the time in Kyiv and negotiate a compromise.\nSee also\n*2004 Ukrainian presidential election\n*Sievierodonetsk Congress\n*Novorossiya (confederation)\n*Novorossiya\n*Luhansk People's Republic\n*Donetsk People's Republic\n*Regionalism in Ukraine\nReferences\nExternal links\n*Crouch, D.
