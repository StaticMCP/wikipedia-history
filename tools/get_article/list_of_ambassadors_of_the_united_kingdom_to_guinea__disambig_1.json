In 1965 the mission was briefly combined with Mali before a break in diplomatic relations; when relations were resumed in 1970 the mission was combined with Senegal until 2000 and with Sierra Leone until 2003.\nList of heads of mission\nAmbassadors\n*1959–1960: Guy Clarke (non-resident)\n*1960–1962: Donald Logan\n*1962–1965: Hilary William King\n*1965: John Waterfield (non-resident)\n*1965–1970: Diplomatic relations severed over Rhodesia\n*1970–1971: John Tahourdin (non-resident)\n*1971–1973: Ivor Porter (non-resident)\n*1973–1976: Denzil Dunnett (non-resident)\n*1976–1979: John Powell-Jones (non-resident)\n*1979–1982: William Squire (non-resident)\n*1982–1985: Laurence O'Keeffe (non-resident)\n*1985–1990: John Macrae (non-resident)\n*1990–1993: Roger Beetham (non-resident)\n*1993–1997: Alan Furness (non-resident)\n*1997–2000: David Snoxell (non-resident)\n*2000–2003: Alan Jones (non-resident)\n*2003–2004: Helen Horn\n*2004–2008: John McManus\n*2008–2011: Ian Felton\n*2011–2015: Graham Styles\n*2015: Ian Richards ''(chargé d'affaires)''\n*2015-2019 Catherine Inglehearn\n*2019–2022: David McIlroy\n*2023–2025: John Marshall\n*2025–present: Daniel Shepherd\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-conakry British Embassy Conakry]"
