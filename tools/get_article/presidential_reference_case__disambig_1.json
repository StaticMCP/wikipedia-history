The president referred a total of 14 questions, challenging the Court's earlier verdict in State of Tamil Nadu v. Governor of Tamil Nadu, which ruled that the Governor of a state cannot exercise an absolute veto or a pocket veto over legislation duly passed by the State Legislatures.\nThe case was heard by a five-judge constitution bench of the Court led by Chief Justice of India B. R. Gavai. The court heard the matter for ten days and reserved its judgement on 11 September 2025.\nSee also\n* State of Tamil Nadu v. Governor of Tamil Nadu\nReferences"
