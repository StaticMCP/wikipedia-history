      "text": "# Queen & Country\n\nQueen & Country is an American comic book published by Oni Press and written by Greg Rucka with various artists illustrating.\nIt was inspired by the British ITV television series The Sandbaggers (1978–1980), which was created and primarily written by Ian Mackintosh. Mackintosh is heavily praised in an essay by Rucka in Issue #1 of Queen & Country.\nPublication history\nThe first series began in March 2001 and ran for 32 issues, finishing in August 2007.\nThree Queen & Country: Declassified spin-off mini-series have also been published, the first two written by Rucka and the third by Antony Johnston under Rucka's supervision.  They deal specifically with the past missions of various characters.  Events of the first Declassified miniseries in particular influence what happens in later issues of the main series; it is best read before \"Operation Stormfront\".\nTranslated editions of the collected volumes are available in Polish, French and German, and several volumes are available in Spanish.\nPlot\nThe series is centered on Tara Chace, an operative of the Special Operations Section of SIS, known as the Minders. It attempts to portray the bureaucracy and politics which the agents deal with realistically, as well as including the dangerous missions typical of the spy genre.\nOther recurring characters in the series alongside Tara Chace include Director of Operations Paul Crocker, Deputy Chief of Service Donald Weldon, Chief of Service Frances Barclay (known as \"C\"), Mission Control Officer and Main Communications Officer Alexis and former Head of Special Section Tom Wallace.\nStorylines\n*Operation: Broken Ground\n:(Queen & Country #1–4)\n:Written by Greg Rucka.
