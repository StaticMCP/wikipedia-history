Founder Mike Lancaster put Ready to Wear as the one 1994 film among his five worst movies of the 1990s, alongside ''It's Pat, Kids, Lost in Space, and Nothing but Trouble. Listed as follows are the different categories with their respective winners and nominees, including Worst Picture and its dishonourable mentions, which are films that were considered for Worst Picture but ultimately failed to make the final ballot (30 total).
