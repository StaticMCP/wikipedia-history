She entered service as a MAC ship in December 1943; however, only her air crew and the necessary maintenance staff were naval personnel.  She was operated by Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co.\nShe returned to merchant service as an oil tanker in 1946 and renamed Naninia and was eventually scrapped in Hong Kong in 1960.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\ncategory:Ships built by Swan Hunter"
