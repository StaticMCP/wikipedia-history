Indonesia is a country of origin, destination,  and transit for sex trafficking.\nSex trafficking victims in the country are from all ethnic groups in Indonesia and foreigners.\nChildren, migrants,  refugees, and people with low education or in poverty are vulnerable.

Many are abducted, deceived and forced into prostitution and unfree labour. Victims are threatened and experience physical and psychological abuse. They contract sexually transmitted diseases from rapes. They have been drugged and forced to take pills to delay menstruation to maximize profits. Some are coerced to be in online pornographic films.\nThe sex traffickers are often part of or collude with criminal syndicates.

Some perpetrators are victims of sex trafficking themselves.\nThe government of Indonesia has been criticized for the weak implementation of sex trafficking laws and poor victim protections.
