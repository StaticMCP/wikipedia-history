The designated area of the Mississippi Gulf Coast comprises six counties recognized for their unique cultural and scenic qualities. The National Heritage Area designation provides a unified marketing and promotional framework for the region.\nThe National Heritage Area comprises Pearl River, Stone, George, Hancock, Harrison and Jackson counties. It includes the Mississippi portion of Gulf Islands National Seashore.\nThe area was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  Much of the national heritage area's efforts since that time have focused on recovery and preservation and restoration of buildings and cultural resources damaged or lost in the storm.\nThe Mississippi Gulf Coast National Heritage Area was established in December 2004 by Public Law 108-447.\nThe Mississippi Gulf Coast National Heritage Area introduced a program for the Gulf Coast, creating a 'Passport to Adventure' where participants could head to different landmarks across the coast to receive a stamp. The program ran for the month of July 2024.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://msgulfcoastheritage.ms.gov Mississippi Gulf Coast National Heritage Area official site]"
