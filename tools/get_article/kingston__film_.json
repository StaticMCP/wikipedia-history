Its striking cinematography, atmospheric storytelling, and committed lead performance make it an engaging watch for those who appreciate mood-driven horror over outright scares\". Abhinav Subramanian of The Times of India gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Nothing deflates a seafaring horror faster than skeletons that can’t seem to skeletonize anyone—leaving Kingston adrift in unnecessarily stormy narrative waters.[...] The muddled screenplay struggles to clearly communicate its complex mythology through dialogue that shifts between contemporary and regional dialect.\" Sanjay Ponnappa of India Today gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Overall, 'Kingston and the Cursed Sea' is an ambitious attempt at a genre rarely explored in Indian cinema. For its visual effects and the horror elements in the second half, the film could be deemed watchable.\" Baradwaj Rangan wrote for Galatta Plus, \"Kingston could have been a fun equivalent of a page-turner, but the non-linear narration and the stabs at rootedness keep playing spoilsport.\"\nAvinash Ramachandran of The Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Kingston is trapped under its own weight of having to cramp up multiple storylines to set the stage for the showdown.[...] Kingston makes you feel like reading one of those fascinating pulp fiction stories that are not just radical and intriguing, but also knew never to overstay its welcome.\" Anusha Sundar of OTTPlay gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"With its convoluted screenplay and no breathing space for character development, Kingston is a half-baked attempt to make a first-of-its-kind genre film. You will be in for a disappointment if you had thought Kingston would be genre loyal for its entirety.\" Prashanth Vallavan of Cinema Express gave 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"Kingston seems to exhibit technical competency, and you could see how it could have offered an entertaining genre film.[...] However, when the pay-off is just them telling you it was never a magic show but a stand-up comedy routine all along, perhaps the joke is on you. \"\nBhuvanesh Chandar of The Hindu wrote \"The problem is that the narrative cuts back and forth in such a ragged rhythm that it hardly allows you to breathe in the world of Kingston. There’s no space for silences, punctuations or any scope for good drama.[...]The characters we follow are no cleverer than the stereotypical horror movie chumps with no survival instincts.\"\nAudience reception\nViewer reactions were mixed. Some praised GV Prakash Kumar’s performance and the adventurous sea setting.\nOn social media, fans noted the “raw and realistic portrayal of sea smuggling” and expressed suspense about the “Sea Ghost” reveal in the second half.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
