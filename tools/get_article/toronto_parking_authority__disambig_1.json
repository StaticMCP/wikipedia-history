The TPA was established in 1998 with the merger of parking operations in the area of the former Metropolitan Toronto. A municipal parking authority in the pre-amalgamation City of Toronto was first set up in 1952, taking over management of parking from the police.\nThe TPA operates off-street parking lots and parking garages, on-street metered parking, and Toronto's bicycle-sharing system, named Bike Share Toronto. It is one of the largest operators of municipal parking services in North America and is 100% self-sustaining through parking user fees and other sources, returning 75% of its annual net operating income to the City of Toronto, totaling $1.5 billion since 1992.\nOperations\ngarage under Nathan Phillips Square]]\nstation]]\nThe TPA operates around 59,000 parking spaces divided into 3 categories – off-street parking lots and garages, on-street metered parking, and joint venture managed lots across Toronto.\n21,000 of these spaces are located in over 300 off-street parking lots and garages, with the largest parking garage being the 2,027 space Toronto City Hall underground parking garage at Nathan Phillips Square. Parking lots that are operated by the Toronto Parking Authority are marked by green signs with their signature P in the middle, hence the name 'Green P' parking.\nThe TPA also manages and operates parking facilities under contract for the Toronto Transit Commission, with around 13,000 spaces located at 17 TTC stations, including at Pioneer Village and Highway 407 stations in the City of Vaughan (making them the only TPA facilities outside Toronto), although the lots at Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station are privately operated.  The largest TTC parking lot is the combined parking lot for Finch Station, with over 3,200 spaces.\nThe TPA operates and maintains Toronto's bicycle-sharing system, which is known as Bike Share Toronto. The TPA took over from Public Bike System Company (PBSC) in 2013, when they ran into financial difficulties. Since then, ridership has grown exponentially with the system now covering  of the Greater Toronto Area with 6,850 bikes at 625 stations and 12,000 docking points.\nEnforcement\nEnforcement of parking rules in TPA's lots is carried out by TPA's own parking enforcement officers. Customers who fail to pay, or who park for longer than the amount of time that they purchased, may be issued an official police tag for each parking violation.\nSee also\n* Bike Share Toronto – bike-sharing program run by TPA\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
