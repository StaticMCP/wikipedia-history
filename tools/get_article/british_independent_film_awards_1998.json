In addition they could not be solely funded by a single studio.\nThe awards ceremony was held at the Café Royal in London's West End and hosted by Keith Allen. Winners in ten categories were determined from shortlists and a further three were awarded entirely at the jury's discretion. The jury for 1998 included Bobby Allen, Grace Carley, Kay Mellor, Kirk Jones, Lora Fox Gamble, Mark Shivas, Martin Myers, Paul Webster, Steve Kenis, Tim Bevan and Wendy Palmer.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"50%\" |Best British Independent Film\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'My Name Is Joe – Ken Loach'\n** Elizabeth – Shekhar Kapur\n** Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels – Guy Ritchie\n** Nil by Mouth – Gary Oldman\n** Twenty Four Seven – Shane Meadows\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Ken Loach '– My Name Is Joe'\n** Carine Adler – Under The Skin\n** Gillies MacKinnon – Regeneration\n** Gary Oldman – Nil by Mouth\n** Guy Ritchie – Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actor\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Ray Winstone – Nil by Mouth as Raymond'\n** John Hurt – Love and Death on Long Island as Giles De'Ath\n** Peter Mullan – My Name Is Joe as Joe Kavanagh\n** Jonathan Pryce – Regeneration as William Rivers\n** David Thewlis – Divorcing Jack as Dan Starkey\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Kathy Burke – Nil by Mouth as Valerie'\n** Louise Goodall – My Name Is Joe as Sarah Downie\n** Rachel Griffiths – My Son The Fanatic as Bettina / Sandra\n** Samantha Morton – Under The Skin as Iris Kelly\n** Emma Thompson – The Winter Guest as Frances\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Most Promising Newcomer\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Screenplay\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Laila Morse – Nil by Mouth as Janet'\n** James Breese – My Funny Valentine (director)\n** Enda Hughes – ''Flying Saucer Rock 'n' Roll (director)\n** Jim Pilkington – Pocket (director)\n** Simon Rumley – Strong Language (director / writer)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Paul Laverty – My Name Is Joe'\n** Hanif Kureishi – My Son The Fanatic\n** Peter Mullan – Orphans\n** Gary Oldman – Nil by Mouth\n** Guy Ritchie – Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best International Independent Film (English Language)\n! width=\"50%\" |Best International Independent Film (Foreign Language)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Boogie Nights – Paul Thomas Anderson\n** Broken Vessels – Scott Ziehl\n** Chasing Amy – Kevin Smith\n** Left Luggage – Jeroen Krabbé\n** The Castle – Rob Sitch\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Apartment –  Gilles Mimouni\n** Airbag –  Juanma Bajo Ulloa\n** Live Flesh – Pedro Almodóvar\n** Marquise – Véra Belmont\n** Men with Guns – John Sayles\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Douglas Hickox Award (Best Debut Director)\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Achievement in Production\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Shane Meadows – Twenty Four Seven'\n** Genevieve Joliffe – Urban Ghost Story\n** Peter Mullan – Orphans\n** Andrew Piddington – The Fall\n** Guy Ritchie – Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Matthew Vaughn – Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'\n** Jake West and Robert Mercer – Razor Blade Smile\n** Allan Scott and Peter R.
