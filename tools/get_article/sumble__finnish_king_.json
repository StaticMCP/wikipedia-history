According to Gesta Danorum, Gram, the king of the Danes invaded his realm, but halted after noticing Sumble's daughter, Signe and proposed to her. This enraged Gram's brother-in-law, the king of Norwegians, thus Gram was forced to leave Finland in order to defeat him. However, while he was away, Sumble arranged a marriage between Signe and Henry, the king of the Saxons. Nonetheless, this plan was foiled when Gram murdered Henry during the wedding feast for Signe had informed him.\nThe text\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Gesta Danorum, Book One\n|-\n| ''Many other deeds also King Gram did. He declared war against Sumble, King of the Finns; but when he set eyes upon the King's daughter, Signe, he laid down his arms, the foeman turned into the suitor, and, promising to put away his own wife, he plighted troth with her.\n|-\n| But, while much busied with a war against Norway, which he had taken up against King Swipdag for debauching his sister and his daughter, he heard from a messenger that Signe had, by Sumble's treachery, been promised in marriage to Henry, King of Saxony. Then, inclining to love the maiden more than his soldiers, he left his army, privily made his way to Finland, and came in upon the wedding, which was already begun''\n|}\nReferences"
