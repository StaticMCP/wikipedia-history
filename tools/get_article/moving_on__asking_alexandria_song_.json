It was released on 29 July 2014, as the final single from the album From Death to Destiny.\nBackground\nIn an interview with Blabbermouth.net, guitarist Ben Bruce commented on the video: \"For the first time in our careers, we are showcasing ourselves in the most sincere light possible. No drugs, no partying, no script, and no bullshit. It's just the five of us completely vulnerable. No matter what the circumstance, being away from those you love and care about is very difficult and drags you down. Luckily for us, we have incredible fans that love and support us and help us through our toughest times. I hope this video gives you all a little bit of a look into our world. Thank you for all of your continued support and for keeping us going.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video was released on 12 September 2014. It shows the band members touring. Between the shots of the tour, there are shots of the band members reuniting with relatives or showing messages, such as \"I'll be home soon, I love you\", \"Thinking of you always\", \"Miss you so much\" and shots of the band members smoking, drinking or even crying.
