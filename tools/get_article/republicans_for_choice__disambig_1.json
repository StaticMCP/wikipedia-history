However, Republicans for Choice spends very little on campaigns, relative to other PACs.\nSupported Members of Congress\nSenate\nServing as of 2020:\n*Susan Collins, Maine\n*Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia\n*Lisa Murkowski, Alaska\nHouse\nServing as of 2020:\n*None\nMission\nThe organization has quoted the Republican Party's Statement of Principles, suggesting that this encompasses the option to choose abortion: the Party wants \"[a]n America with a smaller less burdensome government that trusts its people to decide what is best for them ... [a]n America where freedom of expression, individual conscience, and personal privacy are cherished and respected.\"\nIt has called for the Human Life Amendment to be removed from the abortion plank and that the platform reflect real policy that represents a common ground approach where both sides of the GOP can work together to make abortion unnecessary without taking away women's rights.\nRFC has successfully gotten language into the platform that encourages Republicans to follow their conscience on this and other divisive issues. They do not ask those who disagree with them to leave the GOP but rather to join with them to return to the real core Republican values that call for smaller government and protecting personal freedom.  They believe this should extend to both men and women. Ultimately they believe in a GOP that helps get the government out of the boardroom and the bedroom.\nIn that light, Republicans for Choice has suggested changes to the Republican National Platform with regard to societal attitudes towards gay and lesbian issues.\nRepublicans for Choice is partners with other Republican groups such as The Wish List, The Republican Majority For Choice, IMP-PAC (It's My Party Too), and the Republican Main Street Partnership.\nSee also\n*Democrats for Life of America\n*Libertarians for Life\n*Republican Majority for Choice\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.republicansforchoice.com Republicans for Choice PAC] - Official website"
