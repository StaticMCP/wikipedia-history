For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n11 & 12 Geo. 5\nThe third session of the 31st Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 15 February 1921 until 10 November 1921.\nThe fourth session, which met from 14 December 1921 until 19 December 1921, did not pass any acts (it met solely to consider the Anglo-Irish Treaty).\nThis session was traditionally cited as 11 & 12 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\nand to vary the conditions for the receipt of such benefit, and to amend the said Act with respect to the rates and crediting of contributions thereunder, and otherwise.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  in respect of the Expenses of Reformatory and Industrial Schools.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1921, and otherwise to amend those Acts.|note4= }}\n| or the Plumage Act 1908|public|16|01-07-1921|repealed=y|An Act to prohibit the importation of Plumage.|note4= }}\n|  and the First Schedule to that Act so far as that Schedule amends subsection (1) of section one of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, and the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1908, and to remove doubt as to the procedure in arbitrations as to rent under section ten of the Agriculture Act, 1920.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  amending that Act.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to the giving of guarantees in connection with export transactions, and otherwise to amend section one of that Act.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n-\n| }}\n|\n|\n|  and to limit the aggregate amount of such grants in respect of houses in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n-\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and sections twenty-six and twenty-nine of the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act, 1919, by extending the periods of time therein respectively mentioned, and to raise the limit on the aggregate amount which may be issued out of the Consolidated Fund under the said section twenty-six for the purpose of advances to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1920, to make provision as to payments under those Acts in respect of the crops of the current year, to provide funds for agricultural development, to promote the formation of joint conciliation committees for the industry of agriculture, and to make certain consequential amendments in section twelve, and to repeal subsection (1) of section fifteen of the Agriculture Act, 1920.|note4= }}\n|\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1889. }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Overseas Trade (Credits and Insurance) Amendment Act, 1921.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  relating to the Forth Conservancy.|note4=|po1=Forth Conservancy Order 1921|Provisional Order for the constitution of a Board of Conservators for the Preservation Maintenance and Improvement of part of the River and Firth of Forth;
