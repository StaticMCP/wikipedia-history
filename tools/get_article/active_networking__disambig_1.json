Network processors are one means of implementing active networking concepts. Active networks have also been implemented as overlay networks.\nWhat does it offer?\nActive networking allows the possibility of highly tailored and rapid \"real-time\" changes to the underlying network operation.\nThis enables such ideas as sending code along with packets of information allowing the data to change its form (code) to match the channel characteristics.\nThe smallest program that can generate a sequence of data can be found in the definition of Kolmogorov complexity.\nThe use of real-time genetic algorithms within the network to compose network services is also enabled by active networking.\nHow it relates to other networking paradigms\nActive networking relates to other networking paradigms primarily based upon how computing and communication are partitioned in the architecture.\nActive networking and software-defined networking\nActive networking is an approach to network architecture with in-network programmability. The name derives from a comparison with network approaches advocating minimization of in-network processing, based on design advice such as the \"end-to-end argument\". Two major approaches were conceived: programmable network elements (\"switches\") and capsules, a programmability approach that places computation within packets traveling through the network. Treating packets as programs later became known as \"active packets\".  Software-defined networking decouples the system that makes decisions about where traffic is sent (the control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane). The concept of a programmable control plane originated at the University of Cambridge in the Systems Research Group, where (using virtual circuit identifiers available in Asynchronous Transfer Mode switches) multiple virtual control planes were made available on a single physical switch. Control Plane Technologies (CPT) was founded to commercialize this concept.\nFundamental challenges\nActive network research addresses the nature of how best to incorporate extremely dynamic capability within networks.\nIn order to do this, active network research must address the problem of optimally allocating computation versus communication within communication networks. A similar problem related to the compression of code as a measure of complexity is addressed via algorithmic information theory.\nOne of the challenges of active networking has been the inability of information theory to mathematically model the active network paradigm and enable active network engineering. This is due to the active nature of the network in which communication packets contain code that dynamically change the operation of the network. Fundamental advances in information theory are required in order to understand such networks.\nNanoscale active networks\nAs the limit in reduction of transistor size is reached with current technology, active networking concepts are being explored as a more efficient means accomplishing computation and communication. More on this can be found in nanoscale networking.\nSee also\n* Nanoscale networking\n* Network processing\n* Software-defined networking (SDN)\n* Communication complexity\n* Kolmogorov complexity\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Towards an Active Network Architecture (1996), David L.
