They had originally been planned for 17 May, but were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. They are the second elections since 1994 in which all positions will be elected simultaneously, and the first in Dominican history in which all authorities will be elected simultaneously and directly.\nIncumbent President Danilo Medina was ineligible to stand for re-election, having served two consecutive terms since 2012. The governing Dominican Liberation Party's 16-year rule ended after Modern Revolutionary Party candidate Luis Abinader received a majority of the vote. Rival candidates Gonzalo Castillo and Leonel Fernández also conceded defeat. The Modern Revolutionary Party also won a majority of seats in the Senate and a plurality in the Chamber of Deputies. The election was a partial realignment, with the Modern Revolutionary Party entering a status as a major party in the country, replacing the Dominican Revolutionary Party, who saw poor election results for the second election in a row and who obtained its lowest total vote share and seat count in its history. Abinader would be officially sworn in as President on 16 August.\nElectoral system\nThe President of the Dominican Republic is elected using the two-round system; if no candidate receives 50% + 1 vote, or more, of the total votes, a second-round runoff will be held between the two candidates with the highest votes on the first round.\nThe 32 members of the Senate are elected from the 31 provinces and the Distrito Nacional using first-past-the-post voting.\nThe 190 members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected in three groups; 178 are elected by proportional representation from 32 multi-member constituencies based on the 31 provinces and the Distrito Nacional, with the number of seats based on the population of each province. A further seven members are elected by proportional representation by Dominican expatriates in 3 overseas constituencies, and five seats are allocated at the national level to parties that received at least 1% of the vote nationally, giving preference to those that did not win any of the 178 constituency seats.\nThe 20 seats in the Central American Parliament are elected by proportional representation.\nPresidential candidates\n{| class=wikitable\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Presidential candidate\n!Vice presidential candidate\n|-\n| style=\"background:#870B9C;\"|\n|Dominican Liberation Party (PLD)||Gonzalo Castillo||Margarita Cedeño\n|-\n| style=\"background:#005BAC;\"|\n|Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM)||Luis Abinader||Raquel Peña\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00AC5B;\"|\n|Fuerza del Pueblo (FP) || Leonel Fernández||Sergia Elena Mejía\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00ACA1;\"|\n|Alianza País (ALPAÍS)||Guillermo Moreno García||Agustín González Morel\n|-\n| style=\"background:#283084;\"|\n|National Citizen Will Party (PNVC)||Juan Cohen||Hugo McFarlane Kaluche\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FD8204;\"|\n|Partido Demócrata Institucional (PDI)||||Frank Gene Troncoso Haché\n|}\nOpinion polls\nPresident\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:14px;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Pollster\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Date(s)\n! style=\"width:60px;\" |Castillo(PLD)\n! style=\"width:60px;\" |Abinader(PRM)\n! style=\"width:60px;\" |Fernandez(FP)\n! style=\"width:60px;\" |Moreno(ALPAIS)\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n|-\n|[https://elnacional.com.do/abinader-ganaria-con-amplia-ventaja-a-cualquier-candidato-segun-encuesta-de-centro-economico-del-cibao/ Centro Económico del Cibao]\n|11–13 Oct 2019\n|29.7%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"| 43.7%\n|23.6%\n|\n|-\n|[https://eldia.com.do/luis-abinader-ganaria-elecciones-del-2020-con-48-1-segun-encuesta/ Centro Económico del Cibao]\n|3–5 Nov 2019\n|31%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"|42.9%\n|18.4%\n|1.9%\n|-\n|Centro Economico del Cibao\n|29 Nov –1 Dec 2019\n|25.6%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"| 46.6%\n|24.4%\n|\n|-\n|[https://www.teleradioamerica.com/2019/12/encuesta-afirma-49-de-los-domincanos-eligirian-a-gonzalo-castillo-proximo-presidente/ Pool Logistic SRL]\n|1–5 Dec 2019\n| style=\"background:#ECBAF5;\"|49%\n|36%\n|3.9%\n|\n|-\n|[https://listindiario.com/la-republica/2019/12/17/596156/encuesta-ideame-abinader-47-5-gonzalo-31-8-y-leonel-18-3- Ideame]\n|3–10 Dec 2019\n|31.8%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"|47.5%\n|18.3%\n|\n|-\n|[https://acento.com.do/fotogalerias-luis-47-3-gonzalo-22-6-y-leonel-20-9-segun-encuesta-abc-marketing-8761447.html ABC Marketing]\n|10–14 Dec 2019\n|22.6%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"| 47.3%\n|20.9%\n|\n|-\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20200625231230/http://primicias.com.do/?p=15658 Sigma Dos]\n|15–17 Dec 2019\n| style=\"background:#ECBAF5;\"|39.9%\n|35%\n|8%\n|\n|-\n|[https://acento.com.do/politica-abinader-lleva-la-delantera-con-43-segun-encuesta-mark-penn-8770232.html Mark Penn/Stagwell]\n|8–10 Jan 2020\n|28%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"|43%\n|19%\n|\n|-\n|[https://www.quisqueyapeach.com/encuesta-gallup-rd-abinader-42-gonzalo-31-y-leonel-15-para-las-elecciones-de-mayo/ Gallup-RD]\n|16–21 Jan 2020\n|31.4%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"| 42.2%\n|15.5%\n|1.2%\n|-\n|[https://www.quisqueyapeach.com/encuesta-gallup-rd-abinader-42-gonzalo-31-y-leonel-15-para-las-elecciones-de-mayo/ Gallup-Hoy]\n|16–21 Jan 2020\n|31.7%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"| 44.9%\n|19.3%\n|\n|-\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20160505215452/http://www.ciesinternational.com/news_-_latest_dominican_rep_polls CIES International]\n|31 Jan–2 Feb 2020\n|35%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"|37%\n|11%\n|3%\n|-\n|[https://hoy.com.do/luis-abinader-52-gonzalo-castillo-24-y-leonel-fernandez-17-en-encuesta-greenberg-diario-libre/ Greenberg-Diario Libre]\n|21–24 Feb 2020\n|24%\n| style=\"background:#7B92A6;\"| 52%\n|17%\n|2%\n|-\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20160505215452/http://www.ciesinternational.com/news_-_latest_dominican_rep_polls CIES International]\n|23–25 Feb 2020\n|28.8%\n| style=\"background:#BCDAF5;\"| 43.7%\n|12.6%\n|6.4%\n|-\n|[https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/politica/luis-abinader-ganaria-en-primera-vuelta-con-el-556-de-los-votos-segun-la-encuesta-abc-marketing-GA18908538 CIMERAN Former President Leonel Fernández, who left the ruling party and ran for the presidency as a member of the People's Force party, also conceded defeat.

The ruling Dominican Liberation Party lost nearly 30% of their prior seats. No party has a majority on their own in the Chamber, meaning alliances or coalitions will need to be made to guarantee the passage of bills. A total of 96 seats is needed for a majority.\nReferences"
