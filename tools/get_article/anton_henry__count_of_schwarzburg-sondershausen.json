He was the ruling Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen from 1594 until his death.\nLife\nHe was the son of Count John Günther I of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (1532–1586), and his wife, Countess Anna (1539–1579), a daughter of Count Anthony I of Olenburg-Delmenhorst.\nHe was still a minor, when his father died, an so were his brothers, and they were put under the regency and guardianship of their maternal uncles John VII (1540–1603) and Anthony II (1550–1619).  Later, the brothers ruled jointly.  During this period, Anton Henry did most of the work, especially during the inheritance dispute with the Counts of Honstein.\nThe county suffered badly during the Thirty Years' War.  The worst his area was around Arnstadt, where many troops were quartered.  The counts did their best to mitigate the damage.\nAnton Henry died in 1638.  He was unmarried and had no legitimate issue.  However, he did have children from a non-marital relationship.\nReferences\n* Friedrich Apfelstedt: Das Haus Kevernburg-Schwarzburg von seinem Ursprunge bis auf unsere Zeit, Arnstadt, 1890\n* Dr. Kamill von Behr: Genealogie der in Europa regierenden Fürstenhäuser, Leipzig, 1870"
