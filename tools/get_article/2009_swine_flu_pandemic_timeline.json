Overall, the activity of the H1N1 pandemic has peaked.\nNepal First death confirmed, that of a woman who suffered major organ failure.\nDecember 29\nWHO In Geneva Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO, remarks in the context of the H5N1 bird flu virus that \"The fact that the long overdue influenza pandemic is so moderate in its impact is probably the best health news of the decade\" but that \"No, the world is not ready for a pandemic to be caused by H5N1.\" Given that H1N1 could still mutate, however, the WHO shall continue to monitor the pandemic for six months to a year. She also said that it would take at least two years before a true death total is established. (Approximately 11,500 people are believed to have died in more than 200 countries.)\nDecember 30\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine finds that \"household contacts less than 18 years of age were twice as susceptible to an acute respiratory illness as were those 19 to 50 years of age, whereas contacts older than 50 years were less susceptible\".\nDecember 31\nA joint US-UK study shows that children are twice as likely as adults to catch H1N1.\n2010\nJanuary 2010\nJanuary 2\nUnited States CDC FluView Week 52: The proportion of deaths attributed to P&I falls below the epidemic threshold. No influenza activity is reported in Nebraska. \"One state reported geographically widespread influenza activity, 12 states reported regional influenza activity, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and 17 states reported local influenza activity, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 19 states reported sporadic influenza activity, and one state reported no influenza activity.\"\nJanuary 8\nUnited States The CDC reports that only Alabama reports widespread influenza activity.\nJanuary 11\nMali First case confirmed.\nJanuary 15\nUnited States According to the CDC no states have reported widespread influenza activity.\nJanuary 20\nBermuda First death confirmed.\nJanuary 29\nChad First case confirmed.\nNigeria First death confirmed.\nFebruary 2010\nFebruary 3\nMauritania First case confirmed.\nFebruary 5\nUnited States The weekly report released by the CDC states that H1N1 activity has either remained stable or decreased over the past week in nine out of the ten regions of the United States. Furthermore, the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza, which technically remains above the epidemic threshold, has declined over the past week.\nFebruary 8\nSenegal First case confirmed\nFebruary 19\nUnited States According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\nFebruary 25\nNiger First case confirmed\nMarch 2010\nMarch 5\nUnited States According to the CDC, only four states have reported regional influenza activity: Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\nMarch 12\nUnited States According to the CDC, five states have reported regional influenza activity: Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Maine.\nMarch 19\nUnited States According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.\nMarch 26\nUnited States According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\nMarch 27\nCuba Mass vaccination begins.\nMarch 31\nUnited States The CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report states that inoculation rates varied, with the highest rates in New England and the lowest in the South. (E.g., roughly 39% of the population of Rhode Island is immunized vis-à-vis 13% that of Mississippi.) Among children Georgia had the lowest vaccination rate, with 21%; the state currently has the highest level of H1N1 flu activity.\nApril 2010\nApril 2\nUS According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\nCambodia Mass vaccinations begin.\nApril 9\nUS According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\nApril 12\nGuinea First case confirmed.\nApril 14\nWHO An external panel advises against winding down the pandemic alert level until experts have tracked the southern hemisphere's traditional autumn and winter flu season. Accusations of undue influence from the pharmaceutical industry were also addressed.\nApril 17\nUS According to the CDC, no states have reported either widespread or regional influenza activity, and four have reported local activity: Hawaii, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\nApril 19\nWHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan states that \"It is still premature and too early for us to say we have come to an end of the pandemic influenza worldwide. It would be prudent and appropriate... to continue to monitor the evolution of this pandemic for the next six to 12 months,\" i.e. possibly into 2011. She also remarked that although the United States, Britain and Canada have passed through a second wave of H1N1, outbreaks in India, Egypt and elsewhere are intensifying, and reiterates that countries remain ill-prepared for a bird flu (H5N1) pandemic. More than 200 countries have now been affected by H1N1 with almost 12,000 confirmed deaths worldwide, although the vast majority of those infected recovered without special treatment.\nApril 26\nPhilippines Mass vaccinations begin.\nMay 2010\nMay 16\nWHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan states at the U.N.'s World Health Assembly that \"We are just plain lucky ... This has been the case with the A/ H1N1 influenza pandemic... The virus did not mutate to a more lethal form. Cases of resistance to oseltamivir remained few and isolated. The vaccine closely matched circulating viruses and showed an excellent safety record,\" Chan said. \"Emergency wards and intensive care units were often strained, few health systems were overwhelmed ... Schools closed, but borders remained open, and disruptions to travel and trade were far less severe than feared,\" she told delegates from the agency's 193 member states. \"Had things gone wrong in any of these areas, we would have a very different agenda before us today,\" she added.\"\nAugust 2010\nAugust 6\nUS Researchers discover the mutation which had enabled the pandemic.\nAugust 10\nWHO Director-General Margaret Chan officially declares the H1N1 pandemic over  as countries are now seeing a mix of H1N1, H3N2, and B viruses, with some populaces displaying community-level immunity to H1N1 of 20% to 40%.  Nevertheless, Angus Nicoll of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control urged health officials worldwide to \"prepare for a new type of seasonal flu to appear in the near future that will combine elements of the pandemic A(H1N1) strain, and older A(H3N2) strain and several lesser strains\".  \"Pandemics are unpredictable and prone to deliver surprises,\" Director-General Chan noted.\nSummary\nSee also\n* 2009 flu pandemic timeline summary\n* 2009 flu deaths by region\nReferences"
