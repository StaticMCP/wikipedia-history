Officially called The day of establishment of Slovak republic.\n9 January in Republika Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina)\nAfter Yugoslavia fell apart, Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina wanted to stay with Serbia and Montenegro. Croats and Bosniaks, on the other hand, wanted to create an independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 9 January 1992, Bosnian Serb authorities declared the creation of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, now called Republika Srpska (\"Serb Republic\", not to be confused with the Republic of Serbia) as a state within the country of Bosnia of Herzegovina. Republika Srpska now celebrates Republic Day on the anniversary of the state's creation.\n23 January in Philippines\n26 January in India\nduring the annual Republic Day Parade in 2004.]]\nThe Constitution of India came into force, and India declared itself a Republic on 26 January 1950, a day thereafter celebrated annually as Republic Day in India. The Constitution had been drafted by the Constituent Assembly headed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar which was set up when India gained its independence from the British in 1947. This was a deliberate act: The 26 January was initially India's \"Independence Day\", one of Mahatma Gandhi's many symbolic acts during India's struggle for freedom against British colonial rule, and the adoption of the Constitution on this date was felt able to strengthen its initial meaning, one calling for Indians of all ages to declare their freedom from the British Raj by Mahatama Gandhi. It is one of three national holidays in India, the other two being the nation's Independence Day on 15 August (since 1947) and the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on 2 October.\nTo mark this occasion, a grand parade is held near Kartavya Path, formerly Rajpath in New Delhi, beginning from Raisina Hill near the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), along the Kartavya path, past India Gate and on to the historic Red Fort in the old quarter of the city. Different infantry, cavalry and mechanized regiments of the Indian Army, the Indian Marines and the Indian Air Force march in formation, decked in all their finery and official decorations. The President of India, who is also the Commander in Chief of the Indian Armed Forces, takes the salute. The Chief Guest of the parade is the Head of State or Head of Government of another nation. The parade also includes many traditional dance troupes, to symbolize the cultural heritage of India. It traditionally ends with a colourful flypast by Indian Air Force jets in a tiranga formation. Similar parades are held in the capitals of all the states of India, where the Governors of the respective states take the salute. The official conclusion of Republic Day festivities is much later on 30 January, four days after the Republic Day.\nFebruary\n1 February in Hungary\nOn 1 February 1946 Hungary commemorates the proclamation of the Republic of Hungary. Since 2004, this day is a national commemoration day, without being a public or national Holiday.\nMarch\n23 March in Pakistan\nIn Pakistan this day marks the passing of the Lahore Resolution. Republic Day of Pakistan was first observed in 1956 when Pakistan officially became a Republic and shunned the former status of Dominion. The main events of this day include a full military parade and the awarding of honours at the Presidency (Presidential Palace) by the president.\nEvery year, on 23 March, the Pakistani people commemorate their National Day in remembrance of \"The Pakistan Resolution\" passed on 23 March 1940, in the historic city of Lahore which is also the day the country was declared a republic.\nMay\n28 May in Armenia and Nepal\nOn 28 May 1918 Armenia and Nepal Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, thus forming the Democratic Republic of Armenia and the Nepal Democratic Republic. These were the first sovereign republics in the history of both countries and Nepal was the first democratic parliamentary republic only achieved consistency after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nA decade-long People's Revolution by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) along with several weeks of mass protests by all major political parties of Nepal in 2006, culminated in a peace accord and the ensuing elections for the constituent assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of the abdication of the last Nepali monarch Gyanendra Shah and the establishment of a federal democratic republic on 28 May 2008.\n31 May in South Africa (1961–1994)\nBetween 1961 and 1994, 31 May was celebrated in South Africa as Republic Day. This practice was discontinued in 1995 following the attainment of majority rule and the reorganisation of public holidays as a consequence. On the last Republic Day, in 1994, South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations.\nJune\n2 June in Italy\n]]\non 10 June 1946, which approved the results of the Italian institutional referendum]]\nAn institutional referendum (, or ) was held by universal suffrage in the Kingdom of Italy on 2 June 1946, a key event of contemporary Italian history. Until 1946, Italy was a kingdom ruled by the House of Savoy, reigning since the unification of Italy in 1861 and previously rulers of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1922, the rise of Benito Mussolini and the creation of the Fascist regime in Italy, which eventually resulted in engaging the country in World War II alongside Nazi Germany, considerably weakened the role of the royal house.\nFollowing the Italian Civil War and the Liberation of Italy from Axis troops in 1945, a popular referendum on the institutional form of the state was called the next year and resulted in voters choosing the replacement of the monarchy with a republic. The 1946 Italian general election to elect the Constituent Assembly of Italy was held on the same day. As with the simultaneous Constituent Assembly elections, the referendum was not held in the Julian March, in the province of Zara or the province of Bolzano, which were still under occupation by Allied forces pending a final settlement of the status of the territories.\nThe results were proclaimed by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 10 June 1946: 12,717,923 citizens in favor of the republic and 10,719,284 citizens in favor of the monarchy. The event is commemorated annually by the Festa della Repubblica. The former King Umberto II voluntarily left the country on 13 June 1946, headed for Cascais, in southern Portugal, without even waiting for the results to be defined and the ruling on the appeals presented by the monarchist party, which were rejected by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 18 June 1946. With the entry into force of the new Constitution of the Italian Republic, on 1 January 1948, Enrico De Nicola became the first to assume the functions of president of Italy. It was the first time that the whole Italian Peninsula (excluding Vatican City) was under a form of republican governance since the end of the ancient Roman Republic.\nJuly\n1 July in Ghana\nGhana Republic Day.\n4 July in the Philippines\n4 July 1946 is the Philippines' Republic Day.\n25 July in Tunisia\nIt's the day the monarchy was abolished by the National Assembly and Republic was proclaimed. Habib Bourguiba was chosen to be the first President.\nAugust\n2 August in North Macedonia\nOctober\n5 October in Portugal\n5 October in Portugal is known as Implantação da República. It celebrates the proclamation of the Portuguese First Republic in 1910.\n10 October in Republic of China\n10 October in Taiwan is a national holiday commemorating the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, the symbolic start of the 1911 Revolution with the Wuchang Uprising. It is also known as the Double Ten Day.\n25 October in Kazakhstan\nIn the waning days of Soviet rule, individual republics of the Soviet Union sought greater autonomy. The Soviet Union agreed in early 1990 to give up its monopoly of political power. Following the lead of Lithuanian SSR, Russian SFSR and others, Kazakh SSR declared its sovereignty on 25 October 1990, and Kazakhstan subsequently became independent on 16 December 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.  25 October, the anniversary of the adoption of the \"Declaration on State Sovereignty of Kazakh SSR\" by the Kazakh legislature in 1990, is now commemorated as Republic Day (), a public holiday in Kazakhstan.\n29 October in Turkey\nOn 29 October 1923, the Turkish constitution was amended and Turkey became a republic. This formally declared the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Republic Day (Turkish: Cumhuriyet Bayramı) is celebrated throughout Turkey and Northern Cyprus every year. Commemorative events usually begin in the afternoon on the previous day. In observance of the holiday, government offices and schools close for a day. Also, there are fireworks shows in all cities of Turkey. That day everyone commemorates Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\nNovember\n11 November in the Maldives\nOn 11 November 1968, Maldives the then existing monarchy was abolished and replaced by a republic.\n15 November in Brazil and Northern Cyprus\nOn 15 November 1889, in the city of Rio de Janeiro (the Brazilian capital at that time), a military coup led by Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca overthrew Emperor Pedro II and declared Brazil a republic.\n30 November in Barbados\nThis day is celebrated as both Independence Day and Republic Day, as on 30 November 2021, Barbados was declared as a Republic within the Commonwealth. Dame Sandra Mason, the last Governor-General of Barbados was installed as the first President of Barbados.\nDecember\n13 December in Malta\nOn 13 December 1974, the constitution of Malta was substantially revised, transforming the former British colony from a Commonwealth Realm into a republic within the Commonwealth. The British Monarch ceased to be recognised as ''Reġina ta' Malta (Queen of Malta) and the new Head of State was President Sir Anthony Mamo. This occasion is marked every year as Republic Day (Maltese: Jum ir-Repubblika'') in Malta. The monument of Republic Day is at Marsa.\n18 December in Niger\n18 December 1958 is commemorated in the Republic of Niger as Republic Day, the national holiday.  Although not the date of formal, complete independence from France, 18 December marks the founding of the Republic and creation of the Presidency of the Republic of Niger, following the constitutional changes of the French Fifth Republic, and the elections of 4 December 1958 held across The French Colonial possessions. Nigeriens consider this date to be the founding of their nation. Between 18 December 1958 and 5 August 1964, Niger remained a semi-autonomous Republic within the French Community.\nThe 16th is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, as well as public parties and festivities. The 50th-anniversary celebrations were held in 2006, centered not in the capital, but in the regional center of Tillabéry, and surrounded by sports, musical and arts competitions, the opening of new buildings, a National Youth Festival, and other public festivities.\nRepublic Day in other countries\n* Guyana: 23 February (1970, also known as Mashramani)\n* Iceland: 17 June (1944)\n* Iran: 1 April (Islamic Republic Day)\n* Lithuania: 15 May (1920, known as the Constituent Assembly Day)\n* North Korea: 9 September (1948)\n* Republic of the Congo: 28 November (1958)\n* Sierra Leone: 27 April (1961)\n* Sri Lanka: 22 May (1972)\n* Trinidad and Tobago: 24 September (1976)\nSee also\n* National Day\n* Public holiday\nNotes\nReferences"
