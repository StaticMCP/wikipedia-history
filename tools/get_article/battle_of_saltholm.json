Danish and Norwegian ships attacked a British convoy off the island of Saltholm in Øresund Strait near Copenhagen.\nThe convoy of 70 British merchant vessels left Malmö Roads under the escort of three Royal Navy brigs and one bomb vessel. The brigs were  of 12 guns, the 14-gun  and the 12-gun HMS Charger. The bomb was .\nThe Danes and the Norwegian assembled twenty-one gunboats and seven mortar boats for the attack. Once the Dano-Norwegian force attacked, the battle was over within twenty minutes.\nTurbulent, under the command of Lieutenant George Wood, was bringing up the rear. She and Thunder engaged while the remaining ships attempted to flee. This proved difficult as the wind was very calm, which allowed the Danish and Norwegians to row up to and board several of the British merchantmen. Turbulent was finally dismasted, which forced her to strike. Still, her resistance enabled most of the merchant fleet to escape. The Dano-Norwegian force captured 12 or 13 merchant vessels, plus Turbulent.Thunder escaped with some damage.\nPostscripts\nThe subsequent court-martial of Lieutenant Wood for the loss of his ship acquitted him of all charges.\nAlthough the Danish gunboats were active, this convoy was the only one to suffer a large loss. Still, the loss of the 12 ships led northern English merchants to publish a public protest against the Royal Navy in Hull.\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*Voelcker, Tim (2008) Admiral Saumarez versus Napoleon: The Baltic 1807–1812.
