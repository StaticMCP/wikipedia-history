In 1922, an article was issued by the member of the Macedonian Federative Organization Trifon Grekov entitled \"The Flag of Independent Macedonia\". It was published in the Bulgarian newspaper \"Autonomous Macedonia\", and proposed this flag to become the flag of the future Independent Macedonia. The flag was also the state flag of the proposed puppet state: Independent State of Macedonia. Today the flag is used by right wing political parties in North Macedonia like VMRO-DPMNE and also Bulgarian political parties like VMRO-BND.\nSources\nSee also\n*  Flags of Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization"
