The museum is situated within the Thrissur Zoo compound.\nHistory\nThe archaeological museum was established as Sree Mulam Chithrasala (Picture Gallery) in 1938 under the auspices of the Government of Cochin. The gallery was initially located in the balcony of Thrissur Town Hall. An archaeological gallery was added to the Picture Gallery in 1948. In 1975, the Department of Archaeology acquired a building at Chembukavu in Thrissur City. The archaeological and Picture Gallery collections were then shifted to the new building and the institution was renamed the Archaeological Museum, Thrissur.\nCollections\nThe museum houses life-size statues of prominent personalities, models of ancient temples and monuments, and manuscripts written on dry palm leaves.
