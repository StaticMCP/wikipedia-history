Via the Muskingum and Ohio Rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.\nCourse\nThe Licking River is formed at Newark in Licking County by the confluence of its north and south forks including many other small fishable streams.\n* The North Fork Licking River, about 35&nbsp;mi (55&nbsp;km) long, rises in southwestern Morrow County and initially flows generally east-southeastwardly through Knox County, past Centerburg, into Licking County, where at Utica it turns southwardly and flows past St. Louisville.  In Licking County, the North Fork collects the Otter Fork Licking River, which rises in Knox County and flows past Hartford; the Lake Fork Licking River; and the Clear Fork Licking River.  The Lake and Clear forks both flow for their entire lengths in Licking County.\n* The South Fork Licking River, about 30&nbsp;mi (50&nbsp;km) long, rises in southwestern Licking County and initially flows southeastwardly past Pataskala and Kirkersville and briefly enters Fairfield County, where it turns northeastwardly back into Licking County and flows past Heath.\nFrom Newark, the Licking River flows generally eastwardly through the Black Hand Gorge State Nature Preserve into Muskingum County, where it turns southeastwardly.  It joins the Muskingum River at Zanesville; the confluence of the two rivers is spanned by a Y-shaped bridge.\nUpstream of Zanesville, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam causes the river to form Dillon Lake, along which Dillon State Park is located.\nFlow rate\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He took a load of apple seed from Pennsylvania cider presses into the Territory of Ohio in 1801, according to a Harper magazine article written in November 1871, \"Johnny Appleseed - A Pioneer Hero\" by W.D. Haley (pp.&nbsp;830–836).\nVariant names\nAccording to the Geographic Names Information System, the Licking River has also been known as:\n* Licking Creek\n* Nepepenime Sepe\n* Pataskala Creek\n* Pataskala River\n* Salt Lick Creek\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Ohio\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050817061851/http://reference.allrefer.com/gazetteer/L/L04057-licking-river.html Columbia Gazetteer of North America entry for Licking River]\n* DeLorme (1991).
