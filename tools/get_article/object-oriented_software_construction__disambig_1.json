The first edition was published in 1988; the second edition, extensively revised and expanded (more than 1300 pages), in 1997. Many translations are available including Dutch (first edition only), French (1+2), German (1), Italian (1), Japanese (1+2), Persian (1), Polish (2), Romanian (1), Russian (2), Serbian (2), and Spanish (2). The book has been cited thousands of times. , The Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) Guide to Computing Literature counts 2,233 citations, for the second edition alone in computer science journals and technical books; Google Scholar lists 7,305 citations. , the book is number 35 in the list of all-time most cited works (books, articles, etc.) in computer science literature, with 1,260 citations.\nThe book won a Jolt award in 1994. The second edition is available online free.\nUnless otherwise indicated, descriptions below apply to the second edition.\nFocus\nThe book presents object technology as an answer to major issues of software engineering, with a special emphasis on addressing the software quality factors of correctness, robustness, extendibility and reusability. It starts with an examination of the issues of software quality, then introduces   abstract data types as the theoretical basis for object technology and proceeds with the main object-oriented techniques: classes, objects, genericity, inheritance, Design by Contract, concurrency, and persistence. It includes extensive discussions of methodological issues.\nTable of contents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:linen\"\n|valign=\"top\"|\nPreface etc.\nPart A: The issues\n:1 Software quality\n:2 Criteria of object orientation\nPart B: The road to object orientation\n:3 Modularity\n:4 Approaches to reusability\n:5 Towards object technology\n:6 Abstract data types\nPart C: Object-oriented techniques\n:7 The static structure: classes\n:8 The run-time structure: objects\n:9 Memory management\n:10 Genericity\n:11 Design by Contract: building reliable software\n:12 When the contract is broken: exception handling\n:13 Supporting mechanisms\n:14 Introduction to inheritance\n:15 Multiple inheritance\n:16 Inheritance techniques\n:17 Typing\n:18 Global objects and constants\n|valign=\"top\"|\nPart D: Object-oriented methodology:\napplying the method well\n:19 On methodology\n:20 Design pattern: multi-panel interactive systems\n:21 Inheritance case study: “undo” in an interactive system\n:22 How to find the classes\n:23 Principles of class design\n:24 Using inheritance well\n:25 Useful techniques\n:26 A sense of style\n:27 Object-oriented analysis\n:28 The software construction process\n:29 Teaching the method\nPart E: Advanced topics\n:30 Concurrency, distribution, client-server and the Internet\n:31 Object persistence and databases\n:32 Some O-O techniques for graphical interactive applications\n|valign=\"top\"|\nPart F: Applying the method in various\nlanguages and environments\n:33 O-O programming and Ada\n:34 Emulating object technology in non-O-O environments\n:35 Simula to Java and beyond: major O-O languages and environments\nPart G: Doing it right\n:36 An object-oriented environment\n:Epilogue, In Full Frankness Exposing the Language\nPart H: Appendices\n:A Extracts from the Base library\n:B Genericity versus inheritance\n:C Principles, rules, precepts and definitions\n:D A glossary of object technology\n:E Bibliography\nIndex\n|}\nNotation\nThe first edition of the book used the programming language Eiffel for the examples and served as a justification of the language design choices for Eiffel. The second edition also uses Eiffel as its notation, but in an effort to separate the notation from the concepts it does not name the language until the Epilogue, on page 1162, where Eiffel appears as the last word. A few months after publication of the second edition, a reader posted on Usenet his discovery that the book's 36 chapters alternatively start with the letters E, I, F, F, E, L, a pattern being repeated 6 times. Also, in the Appendix, titled \"Epilogue, In Full Frankness Exposing the Language\" (in first initials), the first letters of each paragraph spell the same pattern.\nSee also\n*Uniform access principle\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*, Bertrand Meyer (author), free online 2nd edition 1997 isbn 978-0136291558\n*[https://docs.eiffel.com/book/method/object-oriented-software-construction-2nd-edition Book's page at Eiffel Software]\n*[https://archive.eiffel.com/doc/spanish-oosc.html Page on Spanish translation]\n*[https://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications Bertrand Meyer's publication page]"
