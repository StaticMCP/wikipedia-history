The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), internally selected both the song and the performer.\nAs a member of the \"Big Five\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 13, the United Kingdom placed eighteenth out of the 25 performing countries with 46 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2024 contest, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom sixty-five times since its first entry in . Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in  with the song \"Puppet on a String\" performed by Sandie Shaw, in  with the song \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" performed by Lulu, in  with \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" performed by Brotherhood of Man, in  with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\" performed by Bucks Fizz and in  with the song \"Love Shine a Light\" performed by Katrina and the Waves. After its latest win, it has failed to be consistently successful, only reaching the top ten four times: in , , , and ; and ending last five times: in  (the first time in the country's history in the contest), , , , and . In , it was represented by \"I Wrote a Song\" performed by Mae Muller, which finished in 25th place. The United Kingdom is the country that has hosted the contest the most times, with nine in total (in , , , , , , , , and ).\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster has used various methods to select its entry: From 1957 to , it organised a national final which featured a competition among several artists and songs to choose its entry for the contest. Between  and , the BBC opted to internally select its entry. For its  entry, the broadcaster announced that a national final would be organised again. The same process was used in  and , and changes were brought in for 2019. From , the BBC opted to return to an internal selection.\nBefore Eurovision\n(pictured in 2019) was internally selected by the BBC.]]\nInternal selection\nOn 1 August 2023, TaP Music, the label with which the BBC had collaborated to internally select the British act in 2022 and 2023, announced that it had terminated their partnership with the broadcaster. On 24 August, the head of entertainment at BBC, Kalpna Patel-Knight, commented on the news, indicating that the broadcaster's intention was to look for another specialist team for 2024.\nOn 17 October 2023, the BBC revealed that executive producer Lee Smithurst and Will Wilkin, commissioning executive at BBC Music, had led the search for both the 2024 act and song during the summer. By October, Olly Alexander was selected, which the artist himself announced during the final of the 21st series of Strictly Come Dancing on 16 December. His song for the contest, titled \"Dizzy\" and co-written with Danny L Harle, was released on 1 March 2024. Later that evening, Alexander appeared on a special broadcast on BBC One, titled Graham Meets Olly, where he was interviewed by Graham Norton, followed by the first full televised broadcast of the song's music video.\nPreparation and promotion\nOn 16 February 2024, Alexander travelled to Tbilisi, where he met with Georgian representative Nutsa Buzaladze before filming the music video for \"Dizzy\" in the country.\nFollowing the release of \"Dizzy\", Alexander made appearances on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2, where the song received its radio premiere on The Radio 2 Breakfast Show with Zoe Ball. Alexander performed \"Dizzy\" live on ''Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway on 9 March 2024, as part of the End of the Show Show'' segment. The day prior to this performance, 8 March 2024, Alexander performed \"Dizzy\" for Vevo's Live from Vevo Studio series. In late April 2024, he travelled to New York, where he was a guest on The Kelly Clarkson Show. On 1 May 2024, the singer made a cameo appearance on an episode of the soap opera EastEnders, where he was seen rehearsing his Eurovision performance.\nAs part of the promotion of his participation in the contest, Alexander attended the London Eurovision Party on 7 April 2024 as the headline act, as well as the PrePartyES in Madrid on 30 March 2024, the Eurovision in Concert event in Amsterdam on 13 April 2024, and the Nordic Eurovision Party in Stockholm on 14 April 2024.\nControversy\nAfter his reveal as the British entrant for the contest, it emerged that, in October, Alexander had signed a letter by LGBT association Voices4London which accused Israelone of the participating countriesof committing apartheid against Palestinians and \"Zionist propaganda\" of pinkwashing the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. The Israeli embassy in London, as well as spokespeople of the Israeli government in the UK, criticised Alexander's views as \"biased\" and the BBC for \"sending an entrant to Eurovision who espouses  partial views of Israel and promotes  dehumanising language of Israelis\". The BBC commented that it was not in a position to cut ties with someone who is not a journalist over their personal use of social media, thereby confirming Alexander as the 2024 UK representative. The incident occurred in the backdrop of the Gaza war, which led to calls for Israel to be excluded from the contest.\nOn 29 March 2024, Alexander released a joint statement with other Eurovision 2024 entrantsnamely Bambie Thug (),  (), Iolanda (), Megara (), Mustii (), Nemo (), Saba (), Silvester Belt () and Windows95man ()calling for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire\" in Gaza as well as the return of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Alexander received criticism over his refusal to boycott the contest despite Israel's participation, and a dedicated petition was signed by over 450 queer artists, with a protest calling for his withdrawal subsequently taking place outside Outernet London on the day of the London Eurovision Party. In an interview with The Times on 2 May 2024, the singer claimed to have experienced severe stress on the occasion, \"trying not to have a breakdown\" and feeling \"ashamed of  and embarrassed\", while reiterating that he would participate as his withdrawal would not \"make a difference\" with regard to the humanitarian and hostage crises.\nAt Eurovision\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden. It consisted of two semi-finals held on 7 and 9 May, respectively, and the final on 11 May 2024. All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete in the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressed to the final. As a member of the \"Big Five\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final on 11 May 2024, but was also required to broadcast and vote in one of the two semi-finals. This was decided via a draw held during the semi-final allocation draw on 30 January 2024, when it was announced that the United Kingdom would be voting in the first semi-final. For the first time for a contest held outside of the United Kingdom, the BBC made the draw available on its online platform BBC iPlayer. Despite being an automatic qualifier for the final, the British entry was also performed during the semi-final. On 4 May 2024, a draw was held to determine which half of the final each \"Big Five\" country would perform in; the United Kingdom drew to perform in the first half of the show.\nThe BBC broadcast all three shows of the contest on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, with semi-final commentary by Scott Mills and Rylan Clark and final commentary by Graham Norton, as well as on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Sounds, with semi-final commentary by Richie Anderson and final commentary by Mills and Clark, and on BBC Red Button with British Sign Language interpreters. In addition, as part of the Eurovision programming, the BBC cooperated with DR and SVT alongside other EBU member broadcastersnamely ARD/WDR, ČT, ERR, , NRK, NTR, RÚV, VRT, and Yleto produce and air a documentary titled ABBAAgainst the Odds, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of  with \"Waterloo\" by ABBA. The BBC also rebroadcast the  in full as part of the anniversary celebrations; the contest aired on BBC Four on 7 April 2024 and was preceded by an introduction from  co-host Hannah Waddingham. A BBC-produced documentary following Alexander's Eurovision journey premiered during the week of the contest.\nPerformance\nOlly Alexander took part in technical rehearsals on 2 and 4 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 10 and 11 May. The theme of his performance of \"Dizzy\" at the contest is set around a \"post-apocalyptic dystopian boxing gym locker room, aboard a spaceship hurtling toward Earth through a black hole in 1985\", with four male backing dancers and the singer himself dressed in red boxing gear.\nFinal\nOn 4 May 2024, a draw was held to determine which half of the final each \"Big Five\" country would perform in; the United Kingdom drew to perform in the first half of the show. The United Kingdom performed in position 13, following the entry from  and before the entry from . Olly Alexander once again took part in dress rehearsals on 10 and 11 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show on 11 May. He performed a repeat of his semi-final performance during the final on 11 May. The United Kingdom placed eighteenth in the final, scoring 46 points, all of which came from the juries.\nVoting\nBelow is a breakdown of points awarded to and by the United Kingdom in the first semi-final and in the final. Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting in the final vote, while the semi-final vote was based entirely on the vote of the public.

Each jury, and individual jury member, is required to meet a strict set of criteria regarding professional background, as well as diversity in gender and age. No member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final.\nThe following members comprised the British jury:\n* Maia Beth\n* Chandrika Darbari (Rika)\n* Adam Murray\n* Louise Redknapp\n* Kojo Samuel\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable collapsible plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n!
