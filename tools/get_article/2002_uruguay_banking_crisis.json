The crisis unfolded after years of heavy dollarization since the 1950s when chronic inflation and weak confidence in the peso led Uruguayans to prefer U.S. dollars. This left the economy highly exposed to external shocks. Banks were mainly run by nonresident depositors on foreign banks which held 45 percent of deposits. Additionally, the crisis was caused by a considerable contraction in Uruguay's economy and by over-dependence on Argentina (tourism, and construction boom), which experienced a strong phase of an economic meltdown itself in late 2001. In total, approximately 1/3 of the country's deposits were withdrawn and five financial institutions were left insolvent. The value of the Uruguayan peso fell, losing nearly half of its value against the U.S. dollar in 2002.\nAmid the crisis, the government's initial reliance on international banks to self-regulate delayed intervention, but political management eventually shifted.\nEvents Leading to the Crisis\nDollarization\nDollarization has been a longstanding characteristic of the Uruguayan economy, rooted in chronic inflation and declining confidence in the domestic currency beginning in the 1950s. Dollar deposits were authorised in 1962 and became the preferred store of value during inflationary episodes. Researchers attribute Uruguay's high degree of dollarization to \"incomplete markets\", including the \"absence of effective hedging instruments against alternatives to dollar inflation\" and the \"lack of peso dominated alternatives\". Additionally, private risk assessments failed to account for the systemic impact of dollarization. By the mid-1970s, Uruguayan public debt was fully dollarized, and by 1982, its debt-to-GDP ratio nearly doubled. Dollarization created a vulnerability to external shocks which triggered a loss of confidence in the banking system due to its heavy exporsure to foreing currency.\nThe high degree of dollarization of the exposed Uruguay to \"sudden reversals of capital flows\", leaving the economy vulnerable to external shocks, such as the Argentine crisis. Researchers have identified these dollarization patterns and the resulting \"currency mismatches\" as key structural weaknesses of the Uruguayan economy leading up to the 2002 crisis, where \"financial dollarization reached its peak\" and created a sustained reliance on foreign-currency assets. Due to dollarization, Uruguay's mostly dollar-dominated debt added up to more than 60 percent on the G.D.P in 2002 .\nDomestic depositors were concerned that the Uruguayan government would also impose a freeze, similar to that of Argentina, resulting in the public believing that the central banks did not possess sufficient international reserves to provide banks with th liquidity required to cover large deposit withdrawals .\nArgentina\nUruguay's economy had become heavily reliant on its larger neighbour, Argentina. During the 1980s, Uruguay had increasingly become an important regional offshore center which 45 percent of dollar deposits in the banking system head by nonresidents abroad . In December 2001, the Argentine government imposed \"capital controls and deposit freezes to Argentina's nations\" during its own financial crisis. Two of Uruguay's largest private banks, Banco Galicia Uruguay and Banco Commercial, faced \"liquidity problems\" due to their ownership by Argentine financial groups, making them \"susceptible to Argenitica's economic turmoil\".\nFollowing these capital controls, Argentines depositors began withdrawing their savings from Uruguay's overexposed financial system. As a result, Uruguay lost approximately 12 percent of its bank deposits by March 2002.\nBank-Specific Vulnerabilities\nCondition of the Banking Sector\nThe banking system was vulnerable to exchange rate depreciation. Dollar deposits amounted to 93 percent of total deposits while 83 percent of loans were denominated in dollars, approximately half represented loans to borrowers who had no dollar earnings . Two of Uruguay's largest banks, Banco de la Republica Oriental de Uruguay and Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay accounted for about 33 percent of total deposits and assets while foreign banks held 45 percent o deposits, and private domestic institutions held 22 percent ,\nBanco Galicia Uruguay\nBanco Galicia Uruguay (BGU) operated fully off-shore, receiving deposits from Argentines and lending them in turn to enterprises and local governments in Argentina . By February 2002, the bank was intervened do to its inability to support its Uruguayan subsidiary.\nBanco Comercial del Uruguay\nIn 1990, Chemical Overseas Holdings, Inc. (a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase) together with Dresdner Bank Latinamerika and Credit Suisse First Boston acquired the Banco Comercial del Uruguay (BCU), one of that country's oldest and largest national banks. Over time, Uruguay developed into a large offshore banking center for Argentina and Brazil, largely as a result of its lax banking laws and the predominant view among Argentines that Uruguay was a stable place for their savings.\nAs a result of the banking crisis, some US$800 million went missing from the BCU alone. In the end, five financial institutions failed and hundreds of thousands of depositors in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil were left in dire economic straits after seeing their bank accounts literally disappear.\nIn January 2005, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce ruled that the Uruguayan government would have to pay US$120 million to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Dresdner Bank AG, and Credit Suisse First Boston for failing to maintain the solvency of the BCU.\nThe crisis underscores the three banks’ difficulty in managing risk in developing countries and dealing with local partners during a time of financial crisis. As a result, a class of BC's former depositors is suing the three international banks and the individual directors they appointed to BC's board to recover the losses suffered as a result of the banks collapse.\nPolitical crisis management\nPresident Jorge Batlle appointed one of his most respected politicians, Alejandro Atchugarry, as Minister of Economics and Finance, a decision which proved vital in the reestablishment of fundamentals for economic recovery. The role of the economist and academic  was also considered fundamental to the way out of the crisis.\nDocumentary\n* Jorge Batlle: entre el cielo y el infierno.
