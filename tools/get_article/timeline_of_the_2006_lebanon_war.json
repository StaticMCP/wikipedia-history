      "text": "# Timeline of the 2006 Lebanon War\n\nThis is a timeline of events related to the 2006 Lebanon War.\nJuly 12–19\nWednesday, July 12\nThe conflict began on July 12 when 8 Israeli soldiers were killed and a further two were captured during a cross-border attack. At approximately 9 am local time, Hezbollah's military wing launched a barrage of rockets and mortars on the northern Israeli town of Shlomi, apparently as a diversion.\nAn Israeli border patrol consisting of two armored IDF Humvees patrolling on the Israeli side of the border near the village of Zar'it was attacked with anti-tank rockets killing three soldiers, wounding three, and abducting two into Lebanon's territory. Hezbollah has named this operation \"True Promise.\". The IDF confirmed that two Israeli troops were abducted from Israeli territory by Hezbollah, and identified them as Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. An Israeli Merkava Mark II tank was damaged by a 300&nbsp;kg improvised explosive device as it crossed the border in Lebanon, attempting to pursue Hezbollah. All four of the crew members were killed. Another Israeli soldier was killed when he came under heavy fire during an attempted recovery of the bodies from the tank.  In all, 8 soldiers were killed, 2 captured and 6 wounded. Israel's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mark Regev claims the Hezbollah unit that captured the two soldiers is trying to transfer them to Iran. However, the spokesman did not disclose his source. Israel attacked Hezbollah's TV station Al-Manar and radio station Al-Nour in Haret Hreyk (Harat Hurayk), a southern suburb of Beirut, and in Baalbeck.\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah later declared that \"No military operation will return them [the captured soldiers]... The prisoners will not be returned except through one way: indirect negotiations and a trade [of prisoners].\"\nThe attacks came two weeks after the beginning of the Gaza Strip-focused Operation Summer Rains by the Israel Defense Forces whose objective was to free the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit captured on June 25, 2006, by Hamas militants in an earlier cross-border attack organized by Hamas that left two Israeli soldiers dead.\nIn negotiations for the 2004 prisoner exchange, Hezbollah had sought the release of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel. While many were released, Hezbollah failed to achieve the release of Samir Kuntar. Having failed to achieve this objective, Hassan Nasrallah declared that the organization would carry out further operations at a later date to gain the release of the remaining prisoners. The Hezbollah leader later called for talks on prisoner exchange which was officially rejected by Olmert. However it was widely believed that negotiations were underway with Egypt as mediator.\nIsrael called together an emergency cabinet meeting, during which Prime Minister Olmert said that it held the Beirut government responsible for the attack, vowing that it would pay a \"heavy price\" for the attacks, adding \"The Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a part, is trying to shake regional stability\". Plans to locate \"thousands\" of reserve troops were also announced. Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz also said that  \"the State of Israel sees itself free to use all measures that it finds it needs, and the [Israeli Forces] have been given orders in that direction.\" The United Nations envoy to the region, Geir Pedrson, condemned the Hezbollah action and called on Hezbollah to release the soldiers.\nLebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora denied any knowledge of the raid and stated that he did not condone it.  An emergency meeting of the Lebanese government reaffirmed this position. Hezbollah's action aroused varying reactions among Lebanese political forces. It was harshly criticised by many members of the largely anti-Syrian parliamentary majority, while Michel Aoun, despite his understanding with the party, declared that he supported the government's position.\nIn response, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) launched a series of air and artillery strikes at positions in southern Lebanon, generally seen as the support base for Hezbollah. Israeli General Dan Halutz threatened to \"turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years\" in a reference to the destruction Lebanon suffered in its bloody civil war. Israeli troops later bombed a main road in the south of Lebanon leaving two civilians dead, and a series of air-raids followed during the night which also targeted the civilian infrastructure. Israel said that they were trying to prevent the captured soldiers from being removed to Iran.\nThursday, July 13\nOn Thursday, July 13, Israel began implementing a land and sea blockade on Lebanon.  The Beirut International Airport (the sole international airport in Lebanon) was bombed, forcing all international flights to be diverted to Cyprus.  The Israeli army said the airport had been used to smuggle in weapons to Hezbollah.\nMany roads and bridges were struck by Israel, essentially cutting off the predominantly Shia southern Lebanon from the Capital in Beirut.Warplanes also bombed the road to Damascus, the capital of Syria, and struck a bridge in a suburb south of Beirut, a place highly valued by Hezbollah. They also struck a power plant's fuel storage south of Beirut (but did not destroy the plant itself). People living in this region heard at least three strikes. No casualties were reported. However, the strike eventually resulted in the spilling of over 15,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, affecting  of coastline and threatening aquatic life and fishing. Israeli jets attacked two Lebanese military air bases, destroying runways which Israel claims were used by the Hezbollah to transfer supplies. Attacks against the Rayak air base in the eastern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border and the Qulayaat military airport (also known as Kleyate or Rene Mouawad airport) in northern Lebanon were the first attacks against Lebanon's army in the conflict.\nAn unnamed senior IDF officer stated that the strikes were targeted against rocket launch sites and rocket storerooms, although, he said, many of them were intentionally located by Hezbollah in civilian population centers. An unnamed Lebanese official responded that \"Hezbollah did not store arms in civilian areas.\" Air strikes were also carried out against outposts of Hezbollah. Israel had named the overall operation \"Just Reward\", and Maj.-Gen. Udi Adam of the Northern Command, says Israel has not ruled out sending ground forces into Lebanon.\nHezbollah declared an all-out military alert, and said it had 13,000 rockets capable of hitting towns and installations far into northern Israel. As a result, Defense Minister Peretz told commanders to prepare civil defense plans, and some 220,000 Israeli civilians spent the night in bomb shelters. Hezbollah continued to fire rockets at Israel, killing one Israeli civilian, a 40-year-old in Nahariya, and wounding 14 others. Another Israeli civilian, a 33-year-old man in Safed, later died from the wounds inflicted.\nHezbollah had threatened to hit the city Haifa, \"if the southern suburbs and the city of Beirut are subjected to any direct Israeli aggression\". Two rockets hit Haifa, hours after the threat. Hezbollah denied firing any rockets at the city. Israeli sources later reported that two rockets were fired from inside Lebanon. The attack is the first time rockets have hit so far south into Israel. One shock injury had been reported from these initial attacks on Haifa.\nTwelve members of one Lebanese family were reported by Lebanese authorities to have been killed when Israeli planes bombed their home in the Lebanese village of Zibqine, near Tyre. According to the Lebanese government, in Dweir, a small village near Nabatiye, Israeli planes dropped a bomb onto the home of a local Shia Muslim cleric, killing him, his wife and eight of his children. Another family from that same village was also reported to have lost seven members following Israeli bombing. Israel intensified its response on Lebanon by attacking the Beirut International Airport and damaging three runways.\nThe Lebanese government called for a Cease-fire, claiming the Israeli response was \"disproportionate\", a view echoed by France and Russia. 35 Lebanese civilians are believed to have been killed.\nFriday, July 14\nThe Israeli offensive into Lebanon continues, and for the first time the offices of Hezbollah are bombed. Hezbollah declares \"open war\".\nThe Israeli Sa'ar 5-class missile boat INS Hanit that was blockading the waters  off of the Lebanese coast was damaged in the stern after being hit by a C-802 anti-ship missile. Various sources are reporting that the missile is Chinese-made while others report that it was Iranian-made or procured from Iran, a charge which Iran denies.  It is known that China has provided Iran with this type of missile in the past. Early on there were mistaken reports that it had been hit by an unmanned aerial vehicle packed with explosives, and that there was no serious damage to the ship. Israel immediately recovered one sailor's body, and three more were found two days later.\nAn Egyptian civilian merchant ship, the Moonlight, was hit by a Hezbollah rocket, caught in the cross-fire as Hezbollah was firing on the Israelis. The ship was registered in Cambodia, but sailing under Egyptian flag, carrying several hundred tons of cement. The ship sank in minutes, but the Egyptian crew managed to board lifeboats and was picked up by another civilian vessel.  One crewman, however, was seriously injured.\nHezbollah launched about 100 Katyusha rockets on Israeli towns of Nahariya, Safed, Hatzor HaGlilit, Rosh Pina, Kiryat Shmona, and Karmiel, and in the agricultural settlements Mattat, Sasa, Peki'in, Beit Jan, Biria, Biranit, Kabri, Gesher Haziv, Sa'ar and Ben Ami, resulting in 30 injuries.\nLate the same day, a Katyusha in Meron killed two people, a grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, and residents of Haifa are reportedly being ordered into bomb shelters.\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that an attempt by a group of Hezbollah members to enter Israel was stopped by IDF.\nThe number of Lebanese civilians killed in the Israeli strikes rises above 50, and the United Nations convened an emergency meeting of the Security Council where Lebanon accused Israel of launching \"a widespread barbaric aggression\".\nSaturday, July 15\nThree Patriot anti-ballistic missile batteries were deployed in Haifa. These are aimed at intercepting missiles launched at Haifa. The last time Patriot missiles were deployed to the region was in 2003, during the Iraq War.\nIsraeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz has declared martial law throughout north Israel.\nOn July 15, Israel attacked commercial ports in the towns of Beirut and Tripoli, as well as ports in Jounieh and Amsheet, two predominantly Christian towns.\nA witness reported that at least 15 Lebanese villagers were killed on July 15 in an Israeli air strike on vehicles fleeing a village in southern Lebanon. The convoy left the border village of Marwahin, was refused asylum in a U.N. base and afterwards it was attacked. It is also reported that some hours before the strike, Israeli forces had told the inhabitants of the village to evacuate by loudspeaker.\nSunday, July 16\nOn the morning of July 16, several barrages of Katyusha rockets hit the northern cities of Haifa, Acre, and Nahariya, and explosions were also heard in Rosh HaNikra. Eight were killed in Haifa, and several were seriously wounded when unguided rockets hit a railway maintenance depot. Al-Manar has reported that the Hezbollah attack included a Fajr-3 and a Ra'ad 1 liquid-fuel missiles, developed by Iran. Hezbollah said the attack was aimed at a large Israeli fuel storage plant adjacent to the railway facility.

Rockets also hit the villages of Shtula and Zar'it, the site of the original Hezbollah attack. Additional barrages hit the Israeli Arab town of Ghajar and kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch as well as striking Meron and Safed again, all with no injuries.\nOn Sunday evening Hezbollah militants attempted to infiltrate an Israel Defense Forces post on the Lebanese Border.\nOn July 16, Lebanese President Émile Lahoud and Lebanese military sources stated that Israeli forces had used white phosphorus incendiary bombs against civilian targets on villages in the Arqoub area in the South accusing Israel of using banned weapons against Lebanese civilians.\nThis claim has not been verified. (However, according to several sources, mainly UN, Israel artillery sprayed the entire Southern Lebanon with cluster bombs, mostly outdated surplus from previous wars, some as old as 1982. As much as 2/3 of the explosives was reported unexploded, and according to UN mine clearing units as of March 2008 still on average killing or wounding one Lebanese every second day. UN has to date disarmed 160.000 hidden bomb units but believes to have another million to go.)\nOn July 16, Sky News reported that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was wounded in a morning air strike on his Beirut compound, though Hezbollah affiliated sources have denied the reports as propaganda. News services report that three explosions have been heard in Beirut. Hezbollah TV reports that the air strike destroyed a building containing the headquarters of Hezbollah, with Hezbollah's chief, Hassan Nasrallah, likely inside. He was not harmed, however, and has since released a videotape.\nMonday, July 17\nThe Hezbollah leader, Nasrallah, said in his third televised speech since the conflict began that \"In the beginning, we started to act calmly, we focused on Israel military bases and we didn't attack any settlement, Hizbullah militants had destroyed military bases, while the Israelis killed civilians and targeted Lebanon's infrastructure.\" He added that Hezbollah's arsenal had yet to take a direct hit \"and so far we have used a small portion of our weaponry.\"\nOn July 17, 2006, three rounds of Hezbollah rockets struck the port city of Haifa, wounding two people and partially destroying a three-story residential building.

After bombing the last land routes into Beirut, and effectively cutting off the Lebanese capital from relief supplies, Israel issued a statement saying the attacks were designed to thwart Syrian attempts to arm Hezbollah.\" \"Syria is determined to continue rearming Hezbollah and supply it with weaponry used to attack Israel\", said an IDF statement. \"The IDF is determined to stop this flow of arms to Hezbollah. The attacks on the bridge last night, which connect Syria and Lebanon, were to this end.\"\nThe IDF said the two or three rockets were among more than 200 that landed across northern Israel. The most deadly attack came in Tiberias, where three civilians were killed. The IDF put the Israeli death toll at 74, including 30 civilians. Israeli authorities say more than 600 people have been injured.\nAcross Lebanon, dozens died in Israeli attacks, as Hezbollah rockets struck Hadera, the southernmost point the Islamic militia has reached with its attacks thus far in the conflict. No injuries were reported, police said. Hadera is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Tel Aviv, which Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah threatened August 3 to strike in retaliation for Israeli attacks on Beirut. On the Lebanese side of the border, AP quoted Lebanese security officials as saying that Israeli airstrikes buried 57 people under rubble after flattening homes in two villages near the Israeli border, Taibeh and Ayta ash Shab. No other details were immediately available.\nSunday, August 6\nTwelve IDF reservists are killed by a Katyusha rocket explosion in Kfar Giladi, in the single deadliest strike on Israeli soldiers during the 2006 Lebanon War.\nThursday, August 10\nBy this time, nine IDF brigades of both regular and reserve troops were operating in Southern Lebanon, about 12 kilometers (8 miles) into Lebanon.\nIDF troops kill three Hizbullah fighters in Ayta ash-Sha'ab, and four others in another village. Israeli commandos also destroyed a rocket launcher on a beach south of Tyre, and another rocket launcher was destroyed north of Bint Jbeil.\nPost-ceasefire events\nJust hours after the beginning of the ceasefire on August 14, 2006, about four mortars were fired inside southern Lebanon. An Israeli military spokesman said that Israel would not respond to their firing. On that day four more incidents were recorded when armed Hezbollah members said to have approached Israeli positions were killed.\nThe day after, on August 15, 2006, Israeli soldiers opened fire when four Hezbollah fighters approached them, killing three. The same day, about 10 rockets were fired by Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon. Israel reiterated it wouldn't respond since the rockets did not cross border.\nOn August 18, 2006, Lebanese police sources reported that Israeli warplanes launched four missiles toward targets in the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek. Israeli sources acknowledge that its air force performs sorties over Lebanese territory, but denied breaking the ceasefire. Lebanese officials later contradicted the police sources stating that no missiles were fired by the Israeli planes. The Associated Press reported that Hezbollah had fired at least 10 Katyusha rockets into southern Lebanon. The IDF stated that as none had crossed the border and there were no casualties, they did not respond. Earlier, skirmishes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah left six guerrillas dead. UNIFIL also reported that the IDF fired a tank shell at the Lebanese village of Markaba but that there was no response from the other side.\nOne day later, on August 19, 2006, Israel launched a raid in Lebanon's eastern Beqaa Valley it says was aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to Hezbollah from Syria and Iran. Lebanese officials said \"the Israelis were apparently seeking a guerrilla target in a school.\" Reports indicate that the Israeli commandos were disguised in Lebanese Army uniforms (thus masquerading as a non-combatant party) and spoke Arabic in an attempt to pass themselves off as Arabs. Two Israeli soldiers and four Hezbollah fighters were killed. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was \"deeply concerned\" about an Israeli commando raid in eastern Lebanon Saturday, calling it a violation of a U.N.-backed ceasefire. The statement also cites UNIFIL troops as saying there have \"also been several air violations by Israeli military aircraft.\" Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev told the Associated Press that \"[t]he cease-fire is based on (U.N. resolution) 1701 which calls for an international arms embargo against Hezbollah.\" Regev was referring to article 8 of the resolution which calls for an end to all weapons transfers to Hezbollah.\nLess than a week later, on August 27, 2006, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that U.N. troops would not intercept Syrian arms shipments to Hezbollah unless requested to do so by the Lebanese Government.\nFollowing these events, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on August 29, 2006, that Israel had committed most of the truce violations and described Israel's continuing embargo as \"a humiliation and an infringement on [Lebanese] sovereignty.\" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reiterated Israel's willingness to lift the blockade after full implementation of the U.N.-brokered cease fire.[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060831/ap_on_re_mi_ea/mideast ]\nA week later, on September 7, 2006, the aviation blockade was lifted. Then on September 8, 2006, the naval blockade was lifted.\nBut on September 21, 2006, Hezbollah supporters threw stones over the border fence at Israeli patrols in Israel, seen as part of Hezbollah redeployments. On September 22, 2006, Nasrallah reported in a victory rally that Hezbollah possessed over 20,000 rockets and that it was stronger than before July 12. According to various estimates, the organisation had fewer than 20,000 rockets before and fired about 4,000 rockets during the conflict.\nOn October 1, 2006, the Israeli army reported that it had completed its withdrawal. The UN has said Israel has withdrawn the bulk of its troops from Lebanon, fulfilling a key condition of the UN ceasefire ending war with Hezbollah, but that some Israeli troops remained in Ghajar. The IDF confirmed its forces were still operating near Ghajar, a village split in two by the border. Because of the volatile nature of the place, Israel says it will maintain a presence in Ghajar until a security agreement is reached with the UN and the Lebanese army. Then on October 3, 2006, Israeli jets conducted mock air raids over Nabatiyeh, Khiam, and Marjayoun in Southern Lebanon, and later over the Iqlim al-Tuffah region and Western Bekaa Valley. An Israeli fighter penetrated the  defence perimeter of the French frigate Courbet without answer radio calls, triggering a diplomatic incident\nIsrael admitted on October 22 to using white phosphorus in Lebanon. Although Israel continues to deny the use of phosphorus on civilians, doctors in southern Lebanon have suspected some injuries were caused by contact with the chemical. On October 23, Lebanese police reported the \"most intensive [Israeli] overflights\" of Lebanon after the ceasefire. Two jets flew low over Beirut, while four more aircraft conducted sonic boom raid in Tyre. France, who leads UNIFIL troops, called the continuing overflights \"extremely dangerous.\"\nSix Israeli F-16's flew over a German vessel patrolling off Israel's coast just south of the Lebanese border on October 24. The German Defence Ministry said that the planes had given off infrared decoys and one of the aircraft had fired two shots into the air, which had not been specifically aimed. The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said \"as of now\" it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it. Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz telephoned his German counterpart Franz Josef Jung to clarify that 'Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions' against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of UNIFIL to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah. Germany confirmed the consultations, and that both sides were interested in maintaining good cooperation.\nOn October 31, 2006, eight Israeli F-15s flew over many areas of Lebanon, including Beirut. The IAF jets also flew over a French peacekeeper position in Lebanon. According to the French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, the planes came in at what was interpreted as an attack position, and the peacekeepers were \"seconds away\" from firing at the jets.\nAfter one month, on December 1, 2006, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council president maintaining \"there were no serious incidents or confrontations\" since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel \"almost on a daily basis\", which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon. In one case, a UNIFIL demining team was challenged by two Hezbollah members in combat uniforms armed with AK-47 rifles. UNIFIL notified the Lebanese army, who arrested three suspects the next day. There were also \"13 instances where UNIFIL came across unauthorized arms or related material in its area of operation\", including the discovery of 17 katyusha rockets and several improvised explosive devices in Rachaiya El-Foukhar, and the discovery of a weapons cache containing seven missiles, three rocket launchers, and a substantial amount of ammunition in the area of Bourhoz. Annan also reported that as of November 20, 2006, 822 cluster bomb strike sites had been recorded, with 60,000 cluster bomblets having been cleared by the UN Mine Action Coordination Center.\nThen on January 17, 2007, Israeli IDF Chief of General Staff Dan Halutz resigned. The resignation came shortly after work on a governmental investigation on the conflict was announced complete.\nOn February 1, 2007, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the Winograd Commission, formed to inquire into the Israeli-Lebanese war, that the attack was planned four months in advance based upon an earlier target list drawn up by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Based on prior Hezbollah abduction of IDF soldiers in the North of Israel, Olmert ordered the IDF to put an end to it.\nIn April 2007, Olmert vowed not to resign despite findings from a comprehensive report which noted his \"severe failure\" in handling the war.\nOn June 17, 2007, an unknown militant group fired two rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel, an action which the UN condemned as a serious violation of the ceasefire. Hezbollah denied involvement in the incident, and Israel emphasized that it would restrain itself from responding by force. Saniora pledged that \"The state [...] will spare no effort in uncovering those who stand behind this incident.\"\nIsraeli jets entered Syrian airspace on September 6, 2007, claiming to search for Syrian weapons shipments to Hezbollah. Iran and North Korea condemned the Israeli action, but the incident provoked little international response otherwise.\nSee also\n* Military operations of the 2006 Lebanon War\n* Ceasefire attempts during the 2006 Lebanon War\n* International incidents during the 2006 Lebanon War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5179434.stm BBC News:Day-by-day: Lebanon crisis - week one], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5194156.stm two], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5218210.stm three], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5239142.stm four], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4776627.stm five]\n* [http://www.ynetnews.com/home/0,7340,L-4289,00.html Israel at war - Ynetnews]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKq38COoTG8 Video covering background details]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5274408.stm Day-by-day: Lebanon crisis] BBC"
