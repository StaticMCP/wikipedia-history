The Terteroba had ruled the Cuman-Kipchak confederation in the late 11th century, as well as in the mid-13th century under Khan Köten.\nMonarchy\nThe earliest representatives of the dynasty in Bulgaria were the despotēs Aldimir (Eltimir) and his older brother George Terter who was crowned emperor of Bulgaria as George I of Bulgaria (1280-1292), marrying the Bulgarian Maria. After his reign, Bulgaria was under the de facto control of the Golden Horde, with Nogai Khan nominating the next ruler, Smilets (1292-1298), who was of another noble family, and was briefly succeeded by his son Ivan II (1298-1299). In 1299–1300, Bulgaria was controlled by the Mongol Chaka. Chaka was deposed by George Terter's son, Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria (1300-1321), beginning the second reign of the Terterids, which also spanned that of his son, George II of Bulgaria.\nThe Terter dynasty was succeeded by the Shishman noble dynasty of Vidin, also of partial Cuman origin.\nMembers\n* Aldimir (Eltimir)\n** Ivan Dragushin\n* George I of Bulgaria (ruled 1280-1292)\n** Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria (ruled 1300-1321)\n*** George II of Bulgaria\n** Anna, wife of Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia\n** Elena, wife of Chaka\nReferences"
