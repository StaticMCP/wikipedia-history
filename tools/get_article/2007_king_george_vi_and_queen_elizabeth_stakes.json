It was the 57th King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.\nThe winner was Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor's Dylan Thomas, a four-year-old bay colt trained at Ballydoyle in Ireland by Aidan O'Brien and ridden by Johnny Murtagh. Dylan Thomas's victory was the second in the race for his trainer, jockey and owners. In addition, Michael Tabor had won the race independently with Montjeu (2000) and Hurricane Run (2006).\nThe race\nThe race attracted seven runners but no three-year-olds. Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable were represented by Scorpion, the winner of the 2005 St Leger Stakes and the 2006 Coronation Cup and the favourite Dylan Thomas, whose wins included the Irish Derby, Irish Champion Stakes and Prix Ganay. The only challenger from continental Europe was the German colt Prince Flori, winner of the Grosser Preis von Baden. The Godolphin stable was represented by Laverock, a five-year-old who had won the Prix d'Ispahan and the Gran Premio del Jockey Club in 2006. The three remaining runners, all trained in Britain, were Youmzain, winner of the Preis von Europa and Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, Maraahel, twice winner of the Hardwicke Stakes and the veteran stayer Sergeant Cecil, whose wins had included the Ebor Handicap, Cesarewitch, Doncaster Cup and Prix du Cadran. Dylan Thomas headed the betting at odds of 5/4 ahead of Scorpion (3/1), Maraahel (6/1) and Prince Flori (10/1).\nScorpion set the pace from Prince Flori in the early stages before Maraahel (who had started poorly) moved into second place after half a mile. Laverock and Dylan Thomas tracked the leaders ahead of Youmzain and Sergeant Cecil. On the turn into the straight Maraahel gained the advantage from Scorpion but was quickly overtaken by Dylan Thomas on the outside. Youmzain finished strongly, but never looked likely to challenge the favourite, who recorded an \"impressive\" four length victory. Maraahel was a further three and a half lengths back in third, half a length ahead of Laverock.\nRace details\n* Sponsor: none\n* Purse: £738,600; First prize: £425,850\n* Surface: Turf\n* Going: Good to Soft\n* Distance: 12 furlongs\n* Number of runners: 7\n* '''Winner's time: 2:31.11\nFull result\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#7d7; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:35px;\"| Pos.\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| Marg.\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Horse (bred)\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| Age\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Jockey\n! style=\"width:210px;\"| Trainer (Country)\n! style=\"width:50px;\"| Odds\n|-\n| 1'''\n|\n| Dylan Thomas (IRE)\n| 4\n| Johnny Murtagh\n| Aidan O'Brien (IRE)\n| 5/4 fav\n|-\n| 2\n| 4\n| Youmzain (IRE)\n| 4\n| Richard Hughes\n| Mick Channon (GB)\n| 12/1\n|-\n| 3\n| 3½\n| Maraahel (IRE)\n| 6\n| Richard Hills\n| Michael Stoute (GB)\n| 6/1\n|-\n| 4\n| ½\n| Laverock (IRE)\n| 5\n| Frankie Dettori\n| Saeed bin Suroor (GB)\n| 11/1\n|-\n| 5\n| 3\n| Scorpion (IRE)\n| 5\n| Mick Kinane\n| Aidan O'Brien (IRE)\n| 3/1\n|-\n| 6\n| 5\n| Sergeant Cecil (GB)\n| 8\n| Ryan Moore\n| Rod Millman (GB)\n| 33/1\n|-\n| 7\n| 3½\n| Prince Flori (GER)\n| 4\n| Jimmy Fortune\n| S Smrczek (GER)\n| 10/1\n|}\n* Abbreviations: nse = nose; nk = neck; shd = head; hd = head\nWinner's details\nFurther details of the winner, Dylan Thomas\n* Sex: Colt\n* Foaled: 23 April 2003\n* Country: Ireland\n* Sire: Danehill; Dam: Lagrion (Diesis)\n* Owner: Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor\n* Breeder:  Tower Bloodstock\nReferences"
