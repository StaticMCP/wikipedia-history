In addition, there are more than thirty different kinds of scientific instruments and equipment indigenously developed in China for the ROUV after it entered service.\nSpecification\n*Length: 3 meter\n*Width: 1.7 meter\n*Height: 2 meter\n*Payload: 300&nbsp;kg\n*Maximum operating depth: 6000 meter\nUpgrade\nMerely less than half a decade after entering service, Discovery ROV went through an upgrade that lasted more than half a year in China, from end of October 2018 thru April 2019. It's reported that during this maintenance/upgrade, by incorporating more advanced technologies, the maximum operating depth is increased by a third, to the original 4,500 meters to 6,000 meter after Discovery ROV returned to service. The mothership of Discovery ROUV has been Chinese research ship Science (Ke-Xue, 科学) since the ROUV first entered service in 2014.\nReferences"
