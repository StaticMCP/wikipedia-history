Although never formalized into a definitive treaty, it constituted a significant moment in the diplomatic relations between the independent Kingdom of Mosquitia and the Spanish Crown during the late eighteenth century, with Spain formally relinquishing its claim over Mosquitia.\nHistorical Context\nThroughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Kingdom of Mosquitia maintained an independent status along the Caribbean coast of Central America. The Mosquitian leadership engaged in complex relations with European powers, notably aligning with the British Empire against Spanish territorial claims. However, intermittent diplomatic overtures were made between the Mosquitian and Spanish colonial authorities in an effort to establish peace and regularise commerce.\nBy the late 1770s, Spanish authorities in Central America sought to consolidate control over the Caribbean frontier and curtail British influence. The Mosquitians, for their part, expressed willingness to explore peaceful coexistence with their Spanish neighbours while preserving their independence.\nProvisions of the Treaty\nThe preliminary treaty was declared by a delegation of Mosquitian leaders—George Rex, Isaac (Duke and Regent), Governor Briton, Admiral Frederick, General John Smee, and Admiral Dilson—who met at the San Juan River. The document affirmed the following principal points:\n* Recognition of Jeremiah Terry as a mediator and friend to the Mosquitian Nation, who facilitated discussions with Spanish authorities.\n* Agreement to establish a \"permanent, firm, and enduring peace\" between the Mosquitian and Spanish nations.\n* Communication of the treaty to the Governors of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, the Viceroy of New Granada (Santa Fe de Bogotá), and ultimately to the King of Spain, with a proposed date for ratification or response set for 15 August 1779 at a location referred to as Sicuya (likely Sixaola).\n* Suspension of any claims or hostilities by the Mosquitians against Spain pending formal confirmation by the Spanish Crown.\n* Intent to establish mutual trade and visitation rights, permitting Spanish subjects to visit Mosquitian territory and vice versa, fostering commercial exchange.\nSpanish Response\nA formal Spanish reply was issued nearly a year later, on 5 August 1779, by Josef Perié, Governor of Cartago (Costa Rica), under the authority of the Spanish Crown. Perié affirmed Spain’s readiness to engage in peaceful relations and emphasized that:\n* Spain solemnly respected treaties concluded with other nations, including the Mosquitians, who were acknowledged as neighbours within their own \"rightful and legitimate dominions.\"\n* The Spanish authorities did not hold the Mosquitian leaders responsible for recent naval confrontations involving Jeremiah Terry, citing duress.\n* Mosquitian subjects were invited to frequent Spanish territories—including Matina, northern ports, and coastal inlets—to trade peacefully and freely associate with Spanish vassals.\n* A reciprocal observance of peace was expected, with all parties instructed to avoid reprisals or acts of hostility.\n* The Mosquitian leaders were invited to visit the Spanish capital in Cartago, where further discussions could be held under royal safe-conduct to formalise the accord.\nGovernor Perié emphasized the benevolence of the Spanish Crown, noting the King’s desire for free and contented vassals, regardless of religious differences, and declared that Spain did not seek to enslave or dominate the Mosquitians, but rather to establish mutual friendship and profitable commerce.\nSignificance\nAlthough the preliminary treaty did not result in a finalized or ratified agreement, it represents one of the most direct and diplomatically significant exchanges between the Kingdom of Mosquitia and the Spanish Empire. The document affirms the de facto and de jure independence of the Miskito rulers, their recognition by Spanish authorities, and their agency in conducting international relations.\nIt also reflects the evolving geopolitical context of colonial Central America in the late eighteenth century, where indigenous polities like the Miskito played an active role in regional diplomacy amid the competing interests of imperial powers.\nSee also\n* List of Treaties\n* Kingdom of Mosquitia\n* Spanish Empire in Central America\nReferences"
