He was raised by his great-uncle, Rebbe Meir II of Premishlan.\nYissachar Dov Ber (Bertche) Leifer of Nadvorna was a son of Rabbi Yitzchak of Kalish. Since many of the rebbes of the Nadvorna Dynasty (as in other rabbinic dynasties) married relatives, many of the rebbes in this list are sons-in-law of other rebbes on the list.\nThere are Nadvorna congregations in Israel, Brooklyn, London, and Bloomingburg, among others.\nThe mode of dress of Nadvorna rebbes is unique in that they typically wear a white gartel over a colorful bekishe, and a white crocheted Jerusalem-style kippah under their shtreimel.\nRebbes are known as \"Admorim\" (Hebrew אדמו\"ר, which is the acronym for \"אדוננו מורינו ורבינו\", \"''Adoneinu Moreinu V'Rabeinu\", \"Our master, our teacher, and our rabbi\").\nOutline of the History of the Nadvorna Dynasty\nGrand Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism\n* Grand Rabbi Meir the Great of Premishlan
