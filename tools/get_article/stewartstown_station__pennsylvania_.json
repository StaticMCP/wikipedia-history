It was used as both a freight and passenger station. It was the second station in Stewartstown, as the original 1884 station was taken out of service so the New Park & Fawn Grove Railroad, which interchanged with and was later operated by the Stewartstown, could be serviced easier. It was once the departing location for the now abandoned railroad's passenger excursion trains.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.\nIn 2018, the original slate roof was replaced with a new metal roof, after a tree planted at the station's opening dropped limbs on the roof, causing damage.\nReferences"
