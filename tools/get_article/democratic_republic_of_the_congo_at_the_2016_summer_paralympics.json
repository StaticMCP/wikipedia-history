Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.\nAthletics\n;Men's Track\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Events\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-\n!Time\n!Rank\n!Time\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Jhon Mwengani Mabonze\n|align=left|100 m T54\n|17.46\n|7\n|colspan=2|did not advance\n|}\n;Women's Field\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-align=center\n!Athlete\n!Events\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Rosette Luyina Kiese\n|align=left|Shot Put F56-57\n|4.97\n|10\n|}\nSee also\n*Democratic Republic of the Congo at the 2016 Summer Olympics\nReferences"
