There were ten constituencies, seven single-seat constituencies with elected by FPTP and three two-seat constituencies with MPs elected by bloc voting.\nResults\nThe Nationalist Party did not contest this election. The nationalist interest was represented in the election by Sinn Féin, but they failed to win any seats, and the two seats which had been held by the Nationalist Party were won by the Ulster Unionists, so that all MPs in the region were from the same party. Three Ulster Unionists were elected unopposed.\nIn the election as a whole, the Conservative Party, which included the Ulster Unionists, returned to government with 412 of the 615 seats, and Stanley Baldwin was re-appointed as Prime Minister.\n}}\n|gain       = 2\n|loss       = 0\n|net        = +2\n|votes      = 286,895\n|votes %    = 83.8\n|seats %    = 100.0\n|plus/minus = +34.4\n}}\n|}\nVotes in constituencies using the bloc voting system are counted as 0.5 each, as each voter had one vote per seat.\nMPs elected\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
