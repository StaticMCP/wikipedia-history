His ancestor was a Syed who originally settled in Raipur, arriving from Delhi. Golam Sarwar's father and grandfather were known as pious people and followed strict religious rites. They were hereditary servants of Diyara Sharif of Shampur. Diyara Sharif was considered a holy place by all Hindus and Muslims in the area.\nCareer\nHe was an elected member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly, representing the radical or \"extremist\" wing of the Krishak Sramik Party. He was elected as a lawmaker in 1937 but lost in 6 September 1946, being unseated by an All-India Muslim League candidate.\nControversy\nIt is stated that Hosseini played an important role in the 1946 Noakhali riots.  Ghulam Sarwar Hussaini and his followers started preparing the stage for the massacre by spreading provocative speeches in various rallies. Noakhali was a remote area as it was inhabited by many canals and rivers. He called on the persecuted Biharis in Noakhali. To this end he created a force to provide the Biharis with security and accommodation. It was known as the Miyar Fauj (Miah's Army মিয়ার ফৌজ). On the morning of October 10, he sent a letter to Rajendralal Chowdhury through the Chowkidar and offered to discuss the matter. But when Rajendralal did not respond, Muhammad Ghulam Sarwar Hussaini called a rally of his loyal devotees and Muslims at Shahpur Bazar in the morning. There he highlighted the position of the Muslims at that time and called for the overthrow of the educated Hindus.With this Muhammad Golam Sarwar Hussaini started a conflict with him. However, Sarwar was sheltering the Biharis.But the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League did not respond to his efforts. No one played a strong role in the solution and he was very disappointed.\nReferences"
