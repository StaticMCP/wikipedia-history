While many successful candidates have won the presidency without winning their birth state, only four (James K. Polk, Woodrow Wilson, Richard Nixon, and Donald Trump) have won an election despite losing their state of residence. Nixon, a lifelong Californian, had taken residence in New York after his failed run for governor of California, but later switched back during his presidency and ahead of his reelection.\nList of candidates\nWon the presidential election\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election year\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! colspan=\"3\" |State of birth\n! colspan=\"3\" |State of residence\n|-\n!State\n!Result\n!Margin\n!State\n!Result\n!Margin\n|-\n|1832\n|Andrew Jackson\n|Democratic\n|South Carolina\n| style=\"background-color:#FFC1DC;\" | Lost\n| N/A\n|Tennessee\n| Won\n| 90.84%\n|-\n|1840\n|William Henry Harrison\n|Whig\n|Virginia\n| style=\"background-color:#FFC1DC;\" | Lost\n| –1.3%\n|Ohio\n| Won\n| 8.53%\n|-\n|1844\n|James K.
