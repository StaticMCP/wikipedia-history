He was elected to honorary membership of Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society on 17 April 1894.  He was president of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft 1899–1905. His name is notably associated with the Warburg element of electrochemistry.\nAmong his students were James Franck (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1925), Eduard Grüneisen, Robert Pohl, Erich Regener and Hans von Euler-Chelpin (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1929). He carried out research in the areas of kinetic theory of gases, electrical conductivity, gas discharges, heat radiation, ferromagnetism and photochemistry.\nHe was the father of Otto Heinrich Warburg (Nobel Prize in Physiology, 1931). He was a friend of Albert Einstein.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
