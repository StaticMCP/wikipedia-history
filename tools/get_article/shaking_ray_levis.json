      "text": "# Shaking Ray Levis\n\nThe Shaking Ray Levis is an ongoing collaboration of musicians with a common interest in free improvisation. The project was conceived and led by the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based team of Dennis Palmer and Bob Stagner. They use storytelling, synthesizers, samplers and percussion to achieve their distinctive sound. They are the first American group to have recorded for Incus Records, the record label of British free improvisational guitarist Derek Bailey. Additionally, they have performed and recorded with Borbetomagus, John Zorn, David Greenberger, Killick Erik Hinds, Fred Frith, Min Tanaka, Amy Denio, and Derek Bailey, as well as with many other critically acclaimed artists.\nDennis Palmer died in Chattanooga on February 15, 2013.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041118132206/http://www.shakingray.com/index.shtml The Shaking Ray Levi Society]\n*[http://www.myspace.com/shakingraylevisociety Shaking Ray Levi Society MySpace page]\n*[http://www.myspace.com/shakingraylevis Shaking Ray Levis MySpace page]\n*[http://cdbaby.com/mp3lofi/levis-01.m3u Do lak ah sez sample], 1997\n*[http://cdbaby.com/mp3lofi/levis-04.m3u thank the knife sample], Boss Witch, JD Parran, Steve Beresford, Davey Williams, Frank Pahl, Mary Richards and the Shaking Ray Levis, 1997."
