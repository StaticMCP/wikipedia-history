By 1856, a number of manufacturers had sprung up in the city, including Kitson and Company, and E. B. Wilson and Company, doing business as the Railway Foundry after 1848.\nManning Wardle\nThe Railway Foundry (E.B Wilson from 1838–48) operated in Leeds until 1858. At least some of the company's designs and some materials were purchased by Manning Wardle & Company, who located their Boyne Engine Works in Jack Lane in the Hunslet district of the city. Steam locomotive construction commenced on the site in 1859. Within the next few years, two other companies, the Hunslet Engine Company and Hudswell, Clarke & Company also opened premises in Jack Lane.  There was a good deal of staff movement between the three firms, leading to similar designs leaving all three works. Whilst Hudswell Clarke and Hunslet Engine Company built a wide variety of locomotive types, Manning Wardle concentrated on specialised locomotives for contractor's use, building up a range of locomotives suitable for all types of contracting work.\n]]\nThe pivotal Manning Wardle inside-cylinder design was an  with  cylinders, one of which might have been owned by David Joy (it is described as being for sale in Leeds in 1856 in Vol. 3 of his Diaries) and which was later owned by the Midland Railway. An  with  cylinders was developed from this design for the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway in 1853. In 1855 a  with  class was developed, mainly for colliery work. Two of these, named Alliance and Victory were used in the Crimea; a contemporary descriptions of them in the Leeds press clearly show that the 'Railway Foundry   was the direct forerunner of the Manning Wardle 'Old Class I'. The origin of the outside cylinder  standard designs is more obscure. The ''Chronicles of Boulton's Siding mentions a Railway Foundry  outside cylinder , but this work is notoriously unreliable. An 1856-vintage  gauge outside cylinder  with all wheels of the same diameter, La Porteña'' survives in Luján, Argentina (Manning Wardle later built a coupled version of this), but the most credible evidence for the first outside cylinder  design is the  gauge   alluded to in the 1862 London Exhibition Catalogue as being similar to the maker's 'D' and 'E' classes apart from the gauge.\nManning Wardle went on to play an important part in narrow gauge steam locomotive evolution. After neighbours Hunslet Engine Co. had pioneered the 'Leeds Mainstream' pattern of narrow-gauge steam locomotive (full length outside mainframes; outside cylinders; proper locomotive-pattern boiler; direct drive to coupled wheels; foundation ring below top of frame level, and firebox width not constrained by wheelset 'back-to-back' dimension) with its Dinorwic in 1870, in 1871 Manning Wardle made series production of the type a serious proposition commencing with  gauge  Lord Raglan (No. 353) for the Royal Arsenal. Similar locomotives followed for both the Arsenal and Chatham Dockyard and in 1872 Manning Wardle's first long-wheelbase  to John Barraclough Fell's patents, an  gauge  tender locomotive for the Royal Engineers on the 'Leeds mainstream' Model appeared. This was followed by two  gauge Fell-pattern 's in 1873 for the Bay of Havana Railway (see below), one (later two) 's for the Pentewan Railway in Cornwall, and several 'Quasi-Fell' six-coupled locomotives for Sweden, India and Mexico (again see below). After the appearance of Hunslet's  Beddgelert in 1877, the 'Leeds Mainstream' specification had truly come of age and the Boyne Engine Works went on to produce its own more sophisticated designs in the same vein, including the well-known 's for the Lynton & Barnstaple,  gauge 's for India, and a pair of 's for South Africa. Further examples, including two s, were to emanate from Boyne Engine Works almost up to the Company's demise, but most of the later-built examples were for overseas customers in Chile, India and Argentina, the last-mentioned example (No. 2039 of 1924) being an 18-inch gauge development of No. 353 of 1871.\nManning Wardle became a limited company in 1905.\nMany Manning Wardle locomotives – of  and various narrow gauges – were exported to Europe, Africa, the Middle East (e.g. the Palestine Railways Class M), the Indian sub-continent, Australasia (e.g. NZR WH class) and South America.\nDuring the First World War, Manning Wardle produced a petrol engined standard gauge shunter for the War Office. This had a 180 hp Thornycroft 6-cylinder marine type reversing engine, and had coupled 0-4-0 layout, weighing . Ten of these were ordered initially, with armour-plated superstructures for heavy haulage of rail-mounted guns. The first was delivered to the Longmoor Military Railway in October 1915, the last to France in May 1916. They proved 'wholly' unsuccessful and were soon relegated to shunting work.\nDecline and closure\nThe company employed traditional construction throughout its existence and failed to take advantage of the more efficient mass production techniques becoming available.  The Wardle family connection with the company ceased in 1919 and the company was latterly owned largely by railway contractors (historically an important customer base). The loss of Russian orders following the 1917 October Revolution and the imposition of a punitive Excess Profits Tax in 1921 played their part in bringing about the company's eventual demise, as did expenditure on a new Boiler Shop in 1924 in an attempt to modernise production methods. In what had become a bleak environment for private locomotive builders generally Manning Wardle had simply become uncompetitive.\nThe last complete locomotive was No. 2047, a standard gauge  delivered to Rugby Cement Works in August 1926. This locomotive was preserved at the Severn Valley Railway and last steamed in 1977 when the boiler was condemned. After some years on static display at Kidderminster Railway Museum, restoration began in 2010 and  is in progress at Bewdley. The design for a new boiler has been approved.\nAcquisition\nFollowing closure in 1926 after producing more than 2,000 steam locomotives, much of the site was taken over by Hunslet Engine Co., with some parts going to the diesel engine manufacturer, McClaren. The company's intellectual property rights, goodwill, drawings and patterns initially passed Kitson & Co., thence to Robert Stephenson & Hawthorn in 1938 and finally to Hunslet Engine Company in 1960. Kitson & Co. made twenty-three locos of Manning Wardle design until the firm's withdrawal from locomotive manufacture and Robert Stephenson & Hawthorn produced a further five in 1940-1, all T class 0-6-0ST's for Stewarts & Lloyds. The surviving drawings are now held at Statfold Barn Railway Museum, near Tamworth.\nThe trademark name Manning Wardle is owned by a company formed in 1999 to preserve the name for the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway, which from 1898 to 1935 operated what have become some of the company's most famous products, narrow gauge  engines: Exe, Taw, Yeo and later Lew.\nPreservation\nMany locomotives of the company have been preserved, as listed below\nSteam\n*No. 375 of 1871: Ituana Railway, Brazil, Caramaru originally 3ft&nbsp;1.6in gauge, now .
