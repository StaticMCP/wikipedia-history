His 1872 Dictionary of American Biography, containing 10,000 biographical sketches, was expanded after his death as ''Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography''.\nBiography\nDrake was born in Northwood, New Hampshire, the son of antiquarian and historian Samuel Gardner Drake. He was educated in the public schools of Boston. After aiding his father in his Boston book store, he entered a counting house in Boston. In 1862, he went to Leavenworth, Kansas, and engaged in bookselling there until 1867, when he returned to Boston. Drake inherited his father's taste for historical work, and was an eager collector long before he wrote anything for publication.\nWriting\nDrake spent 20 years collecting material for his Dictionary of American Biography and wrote it by himself. The first edition contains 10,000 biographies and was published by Osgood in 1872. With his latest corrections and all the materials that he had gathered for a new edition—before his 1885 death in Washington D.C.—it was incorporated in ''Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography''.\nHe edited Henry Schoolcraft's History of the Indians, and contributed articles on Brighton, Watertown, and Roxbury to the Justin Winsor's Memorial History of Boston (1880–82).\nPublished books\n* [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001598496 Dictionary of American Biography] (Boston: James R.
