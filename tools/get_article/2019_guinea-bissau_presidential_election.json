As no candidate received a majority of the vote, a second round was held on 29 December. Incumbent president José Mário Vaz finished fourth in the first round of voting, failing to progress to the runoff. Umaro Sissoco Embaló won the second round with 54% of the vote, becoming the first president to be elected without the backing of the PAIGC since 1999–2000.\nBackground\nGuinea-Bissau returned to constitutional order in 2014 with the election of Vaz as president. Vaz won the 2014 presidential election as the PAIGC’s candidate but fell out with the party after he dismissed his Prime Minister Domingos Simões Pereira, leader of the PAIGC, in August 2015. During his presidency (2014-2019), Vaz has worked with seven prime ministers – an indicator of the degree of political instability that characterises his administration.\nOn 26 October 2019 violent protests followed the dismissal of Prime-Minister Aristides Gomes. Vaz met with a senior military leader as rumors of a coup took hold. On 9 November 2019 President Vaz yielded to pressure from the West African regional organization ECOWAS and the African Union and reinstated his former prime minister.\nCandidates\nThe elections were contested by 12 candidates, including:\n*José Mário Vaz, incumbent president. An economist elected in 2014 as the candidate of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), but now running as an independent; the first president to complete his five year term in office\n*Gabriel Fernando Indi of the United Social Democratic Party, a former football club director\n*Umaro Sissoco Embaló of Madem G15, a former prime minister\n*Carlos Gomes Júnior, a former prime minister running as an independent\n*Baciro Djá of the  (FREPASNA), another former prime minister\n*Nuno Gomes Nabiam, an MP from the Assembly of the People United\n*Mamadú Iaia Djaló of the New Democracy Party, a former foreign minister.\nResults\nIn the first round of voting Domingos Simões Pereira led the field, with 40.13% of the vote. Incumbent president José Mário Vaz finished fourth in the first round of voting, failing to progress to the runoff. According to the preliminary and final results published by the national commission of elections, Umaro Sissoco Embaló won the runoff vote against Simões Pereira, 54% to 46%.\n|votes6=7126\n|cand7=|party7=Democratic Convergence Party|votes7=4250\n|cand8=Mamadú Iaia Djaló|party8=New Democracy Party|votes8=2813\n|cand9=Idrissa Djaló|party9=National Unity Party|votes9=2569\n|cand10=Mutaro Intai Djabi|party10=Independent|votes10=2385\n|cand11=Gabriel Fernando Indi|party11=United Social Democratic Party|votes11=1982\n|cand12=|party12=Republican Party for Independence and Development|votes12=1061\n|invalid=11125|invalid2=5694\n|electorate=761676|electorate2=761676\n|source=[http://www.cne.gw/noticias/225-cne-resultados-provisorios-presidenciais-2019 CNE], [http://www.cne.gw/noticias/241-a-cne-cumpriu-com-a-recomendacao-emandada-pela-cedeao-ponto-10-do-comunicado-do-dia-30-de-janeiro CNE]\n}}\nAftermath\nSimões Pereira disputed the results. Although neither the supreme court of Guinea-Bissau nor the parliament had given its approval for the official swearing-in ceremony, Sissoco Embaló had organized an alternative swearing-in ceremony in a hotel in Bissau to announce himself as legal president of Guinea-Bissau. Several politicians in Guinea-Bissau, including prime minister Aristides Gomes, accused Sissoco Embaló of arranging a coup d'état, although outgoing president Vaz stepped down to allow Embaló to take power.\nEmbaló was inaugurated as president in a ceremony in Bissau on 27 February 2020. However, the PAIGC rejected the results, claiming there had been electoral fraud, and submitted a petition to the Supreme Court. Holding a majority in National People's Assembly, the party swore in Speaker Cipriano Cassamá as a rival president. Cassamá resigned after a day, saying he had received death threats.\nEmbaló appointed Nuno Gomes Nabiam as Prime Minister. However, former Prime Minister Aristides Gomes refused to resign. After Embaló, a former army general, took office, armed soldiers were deployed at all government offices and the national radio.\nReferences"
