The FLN militants put up a strong resistance against the French colonial army. As a result of the battle, the Algerians heavily defeated the French colonial army which lost 500 to 700 soldiers killed, 400 seriously wounded and 1 aircraft shot down, while the Algerians only had 120 killed and 60 wounded. A few days later, the French army took revenge by bombarding the entire region of Fellaoucene and the Trara mountains from Nedroma to Ghazaouet with napalm bombs and transferring the population.\nReferences"
