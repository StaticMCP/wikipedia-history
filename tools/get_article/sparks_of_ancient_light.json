Like many of Stewart's works, the album's songs deal with historical figures, including British prime minister Lord Salisbury, deposed Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and 34th U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  According to Stewart, the songs all deal with the themes of \"certainty and uncertainty.\"  A music video for \"Elvis at the Wheel,\" shot in Arizona, was released in December 2013.\nCritical reception\nAllmusic reviewer Richie Unterberger praised the production on the album. He wrote: \"Stewart's principal strengths – pleasant haunting melodies, mellifluous vocals, accomplished folk guitar work, and literate, historical-minded lyrics – stand at the forefront, undiminished by extraneous arrangements.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Lord Salisbury\" - 3:26\n# \"(A Child's View Of) The Eisenhower Years\" - 3:11\n# \"The Ear of the Night\" - 3:06\n# \"Hanno the Navigator\" - 4:17\n# \"Shah of Shahs\" - 5:03\n# \"Angry Bird\" - 2:42\n# \"The Loneliest Place on the Map\" - 3:31\n# \"Sleepwalking\" - 4:31\n# \"Football Hero\" - 5:38\n# \"Elvis at the Wheel\" - 3:10\n# \"Silver Kettle\" - 3:56\n# \"Like William McKinley\" - 4:15\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n* Laurence Juber - Guitar (Acoustic), Guitar (Electric)\n* Jim Cox - Organ, Piano\n* John \"Hot Fat Reynolds\" Ferraro - Percussion, Drums\n* Eric Gorfain - Violin\n* Daphne Chen - Violin\n* Leah Katz - Viola\n* Richard Dodd - Cello\n* Rick Baptist - Trumpet\nProduction\n* Laurence Juber - Arranger, Producer, Engineer\n* Greg Townley - Engineer, Mixing\n* Joe Gastwirt - Mastering\n* Buzz Person - Photography\n* Aaron Walk - Assistant\n* Steve Chapman - Management\nAllusions and historical references\n* Lord Salisbury is a reference to Robert Cecil, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1895 to 1902.
