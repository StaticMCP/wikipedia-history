      "text": "# Singing the Living Tradition\n\nSinging the Living Tradition is a hymnal published by the Unitarian Universalist Association.\nHistory\nFirst published in 1993 by the Hymnbook Resources Commission of the UUA, it was meant to be much more inclusive in both gender references, multicultural sources, and a wider number of religious inspirations. According to Jason Shelton,\nSinging the Living Tradition was the first standard denominational hymnbook to include songs from Unitarians in Eastern Europe, spirituals from the African American tradition, folk and popular songs, music of major, non-Christian religious traditions, and chants and rounds gathered from the various traditions of the world.\nThe hymnal succeeded the UUA's first hymnal, Hymns for the Celebration of Life, which had been amended repeatedly in the decades after its initial 1964 publication due to concerns over biased gender language.\nList of hymns and tunes\nThe hymns are split up by subject, such as theme (Commitment/Action, Love and Compassion, Hope, Freedom, Justice, Stewardship of the Earth) time (Morning, Evening, The Seasons, Harvest, Solstice and Equinox), origin (Music of The Cultures of the World, Words from Sacred Traditions, The Jewish Spirit, The Christian Spirit), holiday (Kwanzaa, Pesach / Passover, Hanukkah, Advent, Christmas, Easter), and for specific services or parts of services (Entrance Songs, Chalice Lightings, Weddings, Memorials and Funerals, Recessionals).\nThree of the hymns—\"Your Mercy, Oh Eternal One\", \"Now I Recall My Childhood\", and \"There Are Numerous Strings\"—were written by Rabindranath Tagore. time)\"\n# \"Amazing Grace!
