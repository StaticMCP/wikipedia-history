The Guelphs attacked the Imperial camp when Frederick II was away. The Imperial forces were defeated and much of Frederick's treasure was lost.\nBackground\nThe free commune of Parma had been a longtime supporter of the Ghibelline (pro-imperial) party. However, it was also considered an important stronghold to take by the Guelphs (pro-papal), due to its flourishing economy and its position across the Via Francigena.\nOn 25 June 1243 Innocent IV, who had several friends in the city and had held several positions in the local diocese, was elected as pope. He thus started a plan to bring Parma to the Guelph side, by replacing the current bishop with Alberto Sanvitale, who was more loyal to him, and order the local Franciscans to convince the population to change side. The already strained relationship between Emperor Frederick II and the pope worsened: the situation was further aggravated by the coup by which the city fell in the hands of a Guelph group, including Ugo Sanvitale (the brother of the new bishop of Parma) and Bernardo di Rolando Rossi (the pope's brother-in-law and a former collaborator of Frederick).\nThe emperor knew of the rebellion when he was at Pavia. He immediately mustered an army, marched against Parma from Emilia, ousted Rolando Rossi, and installed Tebaldo Franceschi as the new city's captain. Innocent IV, however, continued his hate campaign against Frederick both in Lombardy and the Kingdom of Sicily with letters to the local nobility and clergymen. Several noblemen, including the Sanseverino and three Fasanella, set a plot against the emperor in 1244: however, they were betrayed by a participant, and many were arrested and executed. Some conspirators sought the protection of the pope, who, in the meantime, had moved to Lyon, which was more distant from the imperial armies. Here he summoned the Council of Lyon in 1245, where it was decided to confirm the excommunication of the emperor, proclaimed in 1227 by Gregory IX.\nBattle\nNow that the papal participation in the plot against him had become clear, Frederick wrote to the noblemen to inform them of the pope's vile behavior, and marched with an army to Lyon in 1247. Once he had arrived in Turin, however, he received news that Parma had rebelled again. According to Salimbene di Adam, a group of Guelph Parmigian refugees, who had taken shelter in Piacenza, was led by Ugo di Sanvitale (the new bishop of Parma's brother) and Bernardo di Rolando Rossi (the pope's brother-in-law and a former collaborator of Frederick). They defeated the imperial garrison under the imperial podestà Enrico Testa near Borghetto di Taro and occupied the city with no resistance, since the garrison of Enzio of Sardinia, Frederick's son, was besieging Quinzano. Frederick immediately diverted his troops to Emilia, and at the same time he called for reinforcements from friendly lords and communes. The imperial army was also joined by Enzio, who raised the siege of Quinzano, and by a Cremonese contingent led by Ezzelino III da Romano, as well as by soldiers from Padua, Verona, and Vicenza.\nThe pope did his best to send help to Parma from cities faithful to him, such as Milan, Piacenza, Mantua, and Ferrara. Gregorio di Montelongo was able to reach the city, organizing its defense with Bernardo Rossi and Gilberto da Gente.\nPerhaps due to a shortage of siege weapons, Frederick decided to take the city by starvation. The Guelphs were however determined to resist thanks to the papal help, and the siege dragged on for eight months. Frederick ordered the construction of an entrenched camp near Grola, calling it Victoria (Latin for \"victory\"), including houses, palaces, and a church, declaring that it would become the seat of his kingdom after the fall of Parma. However, several noblemen abandoned him. Further, on 12 February 1248 Gregorio di Montelongo launched a sortie: after the sufferings they had faced during the siege, the people in arms followed the image of the Holy Virgin and attacked, Frederick was hunting in the Taro valley, and Vittoria was destroyed. He took refuge at Borgo San Donnino, and then moved to Cremona.\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Parma was a seemingly decisive defeat for Frederick, who had to abandon his efforts to conquer northern Italy in for the immediate future. The Second Lombard League recovered some territories, the whole Emilia and Romagna embraced the Guelph cause, while the Marquisate of Montferrat and the Republic of Genoa remained hostile to him. Sensing imperial weakness, Innocent IV began plans for a crusade against Sicily. However, it proved a temporary success for the anti-imperial forces. Frederick soon recovered, rebuilt an army and cauterized the immediate fallout from his defeat. Yet his defeat still encouraged resistance in many cities that could no longer bear the fiscal burden of his regime. In May 1248, Frederick’s illegitimate son Richard of Chieti defeated a papal army led by Hugo Novellus near Civitanova Marche and recaptured some areas of the Marche and Spoleto. Basing himself in Piedmont in June, Frederick hosted many nobles of northern Italy and ambassadors from foreign kings in his court, and neither his deposition by Innocent nor the defeat at Parma, it seems, had diminished his fame or preeminence. Nevertheless, it was only by strenuous, even unrelenting effort that Frederick was able to stabilize the situation by the close of 1248 and replenish his coffers, raising some 130,000 gold ounces. Frederick remained confident but after several years of war and conspiracy he was increasingly suspicious and wearied.\nAccording to anti-imperial Franciscan chronicler Salimbene di Adam, \"Parma fuit causa totius ruine\" (\"Parma was the cause of the whole ruin\").\nSince then, the town's motto has been \"Hostis turbetur quia Parmam Virgo tuetur\" (\"May the enemy be scattered, because the Holy Virgin protects Parma\").\nSalimbene’s comment notwithstanding, Frederick had by no means been ‘ruined’ and the imperial position was still strong. The battle had less effect than reported by Frederick’s enemies. Frederick’s relatively rapid recovery showed that the defeat at Parma was far from a decisive disaster, and the war in Lombardy remained fundamentally spasmodic and localized. The year of 1250 saw numerous defeats for the papacy and the Lombard League, with Oberto Pallavicino inflicting a severe defeat against the Parmese. At the time of Frederick’s death later that year, his preeminent position in Europe was challenged but certainly not lost, and his power was still very strong throughout most of Italy and Germany. The political situation remained fluid and the victories of 1250 had put Frederick seemingly in the ascendant once again.\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*"
