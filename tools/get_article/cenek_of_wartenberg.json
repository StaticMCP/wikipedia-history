Up until the first half of 1420 he was a commander of the Utraquist League, a moderate fraction of the Hussite movement. As a result of severe atrocities committed by Taborites, members of the more radical part of this movement, he returned to the royalist/Catholic side.\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n---\n\n## Cenek of Wartenberg\n\n#redirect Čeněk of Wartenberg"
