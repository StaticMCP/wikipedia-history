But the advance party decided to disobey Hideyoshi's commands and relieve the castle of Toshimitsu. The Shimazu besieging army noted their approach, and redoubled their efforts to take Toshimitsu castle, so that when the invaders arrived at the Hetsugi river, which flowed within sight of the castle, they could see the flags of Shimazu flying from its towers.\nMotochika proposed a withdrawal, but his companions, Yoshimune and Hidehisa, insisted on doing battle, so the Shimazu set their trap.\nThe decoy force led by Ijuin Hisanori attacked across the river and then withdrew, which persuaded the allied left wing to follow them. They were met by arquebus and arrow fire, and the main body of the Shimazu under Iehisa and Tadamoto, then fell upon them.\nAfter much fierce fighting the invading force withdrew across the river and caused confusion to its own right wing. Chōsokabe Motochika was obliged to signal a full retreat, during which his son Nobuchika and Sogō Masayasu were killed.\nReferences\n*Turnbull, Stephen (2012). Samurai Armies 1467-1649.
