In its ninth season under head coach David M. Nelson, the team compiled an 8–1 record (5–0 against MAC opponents) and outscored opponents by a total of 286 to 95. Mark Hurm was the team captain.\nThe Blue Hens started the year unranked, but early victories over Lafayette, Lehigh and Massachusetts catapulted them into the UPI small college poll's national top 3 by mid-October. Delaware held the No. 1 spot for two weeks in November before ceding it to Bowling Green in a head-to-head matchup. Delaware dropped to No. 4, and remained at that rank through the end of the season.\nThe team played its home games at Delaware Stadium in Newark, Delaware.\nSchedule\n|October 3|at|UMass|T–16|Alumni Field|Amherst, MA|W 42-12| 4,500 |\n|October 10|at|Lafayette|9|Fisher Field|Easton, PA|W 26-8| 6,000–9,000 |\n|October 17||New Hampshire|3|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 50-12| 7,000–8,500 |\n|October 24||Marshall|2|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 30-6| 4,896–5,809 |\n|October 31||Rutgers|2|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|W 34-14| 10,500 |\n|November 7||Temple|1|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 62-0| 2,000–4,500 |\n|November 14|at|#3 Bowling Green|1|University Stadium|Bowling Green, OH|L 8-30| 8,700 |\n|November 21|at|Bucknell|4|Memorial Stadium|Lewisburg, PA|W 22-6| 8,000 |\n}}\nReferences"
