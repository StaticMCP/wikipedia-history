The JC Hotel Ruins are located at this site.\nGeography\nCanterbury's closest neighbour is Morney which is also the name of its closest river. It is located on the Diamantina Developmental Road.\nHistory\nIn the late 1860s, pastoralist John Costello set up camp at a waterhole in the area and carved his initials in a nearby tree. The place afterwards was known as JC Waterhole. By the 1870s it had become the headquarters of the Native Police detachment in the region under Sub-Inspector William Gough. In the early 1880s the JC Hotel was established and in 1884 the settlement was renamed Canterbury.\nCanterbury Post Office opened on 1 January 1891 (a receiving office had been open from 1888) and closed in 1920.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.multimap.com/wi/126352.htm Map showing location of Canterbury]"
