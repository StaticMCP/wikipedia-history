A  1943 message, later decrypted by the Army Signals Intelligence Corp,  revealed Schwartz's activity on behalf of the GRU to be of such value that a request was put in for $1200 to assist Schwartz in personal financial matters.\nSchwartz's code name with the GRU, and deciphered by the Venona project is \"Matvey\".\nReferences\n*[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/R3LT2JWLAL03XYL0.pdf ''Who was 'Venona's' 'Ales'? cryptanalysis and the Hiss case] Intelligence & National Security, Taylor & Francis Group,  Volume 18, Number 3 / September 2003, pgs. 45 - 72\n* John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', Yale University Press (1999), pgs. 186, 364, 462."
