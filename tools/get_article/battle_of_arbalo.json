      "text": "# Battle of Arbalo\n\nThe Battle of Arbalo was fought between the Romans and the Germani in 11 BC. It was part of the Drusus' campaigns (12–8 BC), which started in the unstable north of the Roman Empire near Gaul. With the Germanic from the east of Gaul constantly attacking Rome, Augustus would send Drusus.\nAs part of operations by Augustus to secure the borders of the Roman Empire, Drusus, military commander and stepson of Augustus, was given the order to pacify the region on either side of the River Rhine. In spring 11 BC. he crossed the Rhine with his army and defeated the Usipetes. He built a bridge over the Lippe and marched through the territory of the Sugambri and the Cherusci to the Weser.\nDuring its return march to the Rhine the army was lured into an ambush at a place called Arbalo. It was attacked in a narrow pass by Cherusci.\nUsing the element of surprise and their advantageous position, the Germans were winning until they decided to retreat for some time, allowing the Romans to break through the force defending one of the exits and escape. After the battle, Drusus would build a fortified fort where the battle take place. However, only 2 years after the battle of Arbalo, Drusus would pass away after falling off a horse.\nArbalo is thought to be near modern-day Hameln or Hildesheim. At the end of the campaign, The Roman was able to secure their lands to the north.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* Pliny, Nat. Hist. 11, 28, 55.\n* Cassius Dio, Rom.
