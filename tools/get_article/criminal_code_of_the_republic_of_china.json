Commonly referred to as the \"general criminal law\", the Code is divided into two main sections: general provisions and specific provisions.\nThis Code is a type of substantive law (as opposed to procedural law), defining the substantive conditions under which the state exercises its criminal authority. It also functions as a general law (as opposed to special law), meaning that in cases where other laws contain specific provisions on the same matters, the provisions of those other laws shall take precedence. In principle, the general provisions of the Criminal Code apply to all criminal statutes in the laws of the Republic of China. Criminal provisions found in other laws are typically referred to as subsidiary criminal laws. The specific provisions of the Code enumerate the primary categories of criminal offenses and their corresponding punishments.\nHistory\nMarch 10, 1912, the first year of the Republic of China calendar, President Yuan Shikai promulgated the Provisional New Criminal Law, which became the first criminal code enacted following the establishment of the Republic of China.\nThe current criminal law in use is officially titled the Criminal Code (commonly referred to simply as the \"Criminal Law\").
