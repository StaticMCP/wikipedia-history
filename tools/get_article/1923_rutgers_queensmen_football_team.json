In their 11th and final season under head coach George Sanford, the Queensmen compiled a 7–1–1 record and outscored their opponents, 260 to 36. The team shut out six of nine opponents, including victories over Villanova (44–0), Richmond (56–0), Boston University (61–0), and Fordham (42–0), but lost to West Virginia (27–7).\nThe team was led by Homer Hazel who played for the 1916, dropped out due to lack of funds, and returned in 1923 at age 28. During the 1923 season, he played at fullback, end, and quarterback, tallying 10 touchdowns and 85 points. Described as \"muscular, fast and agile\", he \"could run, block, tackle, kick, and pass.\" He was credited with a 75-yard punt, as well as the longest pass in college football that year, a pass that covered 69 yards in the air. He also scored a touchdown on his own kickoff on October 6, 1923, when an opposing player fumbled the ball behind the goal line, and Hazel fell on the loose ball for the touchdown. At the end of the season, Hazel was selected by Walter Camp as a first-team end on the 1923 All-America team.\nOther key players included team captain and tackle William Kingman, quarterback \"Bus\" Terrill, lineman Dave Bender, back Carl White and halfback Henry Benkert.\nAt the end of the 1923 season, Sanford surprised the football world by retiring from the game at age 53. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971.\nSchedule\n|Neilson Field|New Brunswick, NJ|W 27-0|4,500|\n|October 6||Villanova|Neilson Field|New Brunswick, NJ|W 44-0|3,000|\n|October 13||Lehigh|Neilson Field|New Brunswick, NJ|W 10-0|8,000|\n|October 20||NYU|Neilson Field|New Brunswick, NJ|W 7-3|3,000|\n|October 27|at|Lafayette|March Field|Easton, PA|T 6-6||\n|November 6||West Virginia|Polo Grounds|New York, NY|L 7-27|20,000|\n|November 10||Richmond|Neilson Field|New Brunswick, NJ|W 56-0||\n|November 17|||Neilson Field|New Brunswick, NJ|W 61-0|> 3,000|\n|November 24|vs|Fordham|Ashland Stadium|East Orange, NJ|W 42-0|5,000|\n}}\nReferences"
