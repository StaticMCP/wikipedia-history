W. Clark & Co. investment house, a vice president of the First National Bank of Philadelphia, and a manager of Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company. In his leisure time, he was a prominent cricket player in Philadelphia-area clubs, served as commodore of the Philadelphia Corinthian Yacht Club, and was a part-owner of the Irolita Kennels.\nBiography\nHe was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 17, 1857. He was the eldest of six siblings, including a brother, Clarence Munroe Clark, born to Mary Todhunter Sill (1835-1908) and Edward White Clark (1828-1904). His grandfather was Enoch White Clark (1802-1856). Edward was called \"Jr.\" to distinguish him from his father.\nClark, who attended Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania. He married Lydia Jane Newhall (1858-1936) on October 31, 1882, in Philadelphia. They had two sons, George Newhall Clark (1887-1906), who died while at Harvard of influenza; and Sydney Procter Clark; and two daughters, Frances Clark Stoddard, and Christine Clark Willetts.\nIn 1904, he became a senior partner at E. W. Clark & Co.\nHe became a trustee of the Pomfret School, and gave the school a dormitory, Dunworth, in 1905. In 1907, he donated the Clark Memorial Chapel to honor his deceased son.\nIn 1925, he bought the yacht Resolute. In 1930, with Winthrop Aldrich and Vincent Astor, he financed the sloop Enterprise to compete in the America's Cup.\nClubs\nHe was a member of the Rittenhouse Club, the Racquet Club of Philadelphia, the Germantown Cricket Club, the Union League, the New York Yacht Club.\nCricket\nClark was a prominent cricketer, playing as a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm medium bowler, bowling in the round-arm style. His career in front-rank American cricket lasted from 1877 to 1906, during which he played for many different sides.\nBetween 1880 and 1897, he appeared in 27 matches that are considered as \"first-class cricket\", some of them all-American games and others against touring teams from England. His highest first-class score was an innings of 147 made in a rather strange match in 1894 in which his team batted for the whole of the two days allotted to the game, which was therefore left drawn.\nHis brothers Herbert, Joseph, and Percy also played first-class cricket, though Joseph was better known as a tennis champion.\nDeath\nHe died on April 4, 1946, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.\nReferences"
