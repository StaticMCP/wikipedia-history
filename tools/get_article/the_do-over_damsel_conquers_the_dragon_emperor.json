Filled with thoughts of regret for becoming engaged to Gerald in her final moment, she finds herself six years in the past right before she became Gerald's fiancé at his 15th birthday party. Desperate to not become Gerald's fiancé, Jill confesses her love with a random person not knowing that the person would go on to become kingdom's greatest enemy, the emperor of the Rave Empire Hadis Teos Rave. Hadis brings Jill to his ship on the way to Rave. Jill asks about why Hadis accepted her confession despite the age difference as Hadis was attracted to her great magical power. Jill then tells Hadis that the marriage proposal was just a lie to get out of marrying Gerald, and the dragon god Rave appears before the two. But Jill decides she wants to go through with the marriage hoping to steer Hadis away from his path of darkness.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = With Jill and Hadis agreeing to get married, Rave gives Jill a Dragon Consort's Ring as proof of their relationship. The ship comes under attack, and Jill uses her power to launch it safely into the harbor in the town of Beilburg in the Rave Empire. At the harbor, Jill finds out that only she and Hadis can see Rave, while also meeting Sphere de Beil, the daughter of a marquess and one of Hadis' potential fiancés who went on a murder-suicide rampage in the original timeline after Hadis returned from Kratos. Hadis explains to Jill that he is known as the cursed emperor because all the princes ahead of him in the line of succession mysteriously died. The next day, Jill goes out disguised as a boy to gather information about Sphere and learns that Kratos soldiers have infiltrated Rave. The soldiers kidnap Sphere, while Marquess Beil lies to Hadis about Jill being a spy and the one responsible for the infiltration. Jill is imprisoned with Sphere, and Sphere explains that she was a loner due to her ability to see dragons that others could not, but Hadis reached out to her and even defended her from her father. She fell in love with him but got rejected for Jill. Jill figures out that Marquess Beil orchestrated Sphere's kidnapping to frame Jill for kidnapping Sphere and decides that she needs to expose the marquess for his crimes. Soon afterwards, Zeke and Camila, Jill's would-be bodyguards who were killed in the original timeline, arrive to rescue the two.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Piecing together the information from Jill, Sphere, Camila, and Zeke, the group figures out that Marquess Beil hired ruffians to disguise as soldiers from the northern forces to disgrace them and erode the emperor's reputation so that the marquess can rise to power, all while intending to sacrifice Sphere for that objective. After realizing that the purpose of Sphere's murder-suicide was to protect the disgraced northern forces that Camila and Zeke are part of that led to them coming to Kratos in the original timeline, Jill reveals herself and comes up with a plan to save everybody. Jill asks Sphere to formally accuse her father, while telling her that she is married to Hadis in name only. Jill puts the plan into action by using her power to break the castle walls and rescue the captured soldiers. After coming into contact with Hugo, the leader of the ruffians, Jill comes up with a plan to pretend to get captured and overpowers Hugo and the ruffians, while the freed soldiers destroy the ruffian ships in the port and Zeke stops the priest from stabbing Sphere.

That night, Jill heads to her new bedroom and finds Hadis hung over after drinking wine. Hadis asks Jill to feed him apples, but has to cut them himself after Jill struggles to cut them. Jill thanks Hadis for not executing the marquess, and the two have a romantic conversation before Jill falls asleep. The next day, Camila and Zeke are assigned to be Jill's bodyguards, and Jill tells that them that while she and Hadis are a married couple, the marriage is just for show. Zeke sees the ring and explains that she has been cursed by the goddess Kratos. Camila explains the story of the goddess Kratos and dragon god Rave as the two lands they governed were cursed and separated by a magic shield but became prosperous when they married. Sphere delivers Jill a letter written by Gerald that tells her that he is coming to take her back to Kratos.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = With Gerald coming to Rave to see if she has become Hadis' dragon consort, Jill struggles to make her unofficial relationship look convincing in preparation for his arrival. Jill, Hadis, and Gerald discuss the matter. Jill tells Gerald that Hadis needs her since she can see the dragon god, and in response Gerald will break that dependency. The conversation is interrupted with news of Marquess Beil's apparent death that convinces the civilians that the emperor's curse is active. Afterwards, Camila and Zeke further explain the myth about the goddess and dragon god as due to the magic shield separating the lands, the goddess transformed into the Sacred Spear to bypass the shield, and when presented by Kratos to the emperor, she impaled the dragon consort. In response, the consort stabbed herself with the Heavenly Sword to trap the goddess in her own shadow that destroyed the curse. Sphere, possessed by the shadow of the goddess, attacks Jill before Hadis knocks her out and tells Jill that he does not see her as his wife. He orders Camila and Zeke to bring the women to the palace and kill any who disobey. As Sphere recently turned 14, Jill understands that Hadis wanted somebody under 14 to be his wife to avoid marrying a vessel for the goddess.

Jill shatters the shield with the sword and rings the bell at the central tower to draw the goddess to her, while telling Hadis that he needs to do what an emperor is supposed to do. The spear flies towards Jill to fight her. Jill recognizes the spear as the same one that killed her in the original timeline, getting her to realize that it was the goddess who sent her back in time. Jill breaks the spear to defeat the goddess. Exhausted from fighting the goddess, Gerald swoops in to kidnap her, but Hadis comes to the rescue. Hadis sends Gerald flying towards the Rakia Mountains that border Rave and Kratos.

That night, Jill makes another attempt, but realizes that she is not ready to confess at the moment.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jill dreams of the time in her original timeline when Kratos took Elentzia Teos Rave, the first princess of Rave, prisoner. The next morning, Jill and Hadis travel to Rahelm, the capital of Rave, with Camila and Zeke accompanying them. Upon arriving at Rahelm, Hadis' uncle George Teos Rave attacks and wounds Jill and Hadis with the real Heavenly Sword, notifying him that he does not recognize Hadis as the Dragon Emperor. Rave teleports Jill and Hadis to safety in a village inside the Duchy of Neutrahl, a neutral territory on the border of Kratos, but it causes Rave to disappear, all while Jill and Hadis had their magic energy sealed. Jill recalls that George would go on to raise his own army and initiate the False Emperor Rebellion having declared Hadis a false emperor. The four settle in an abandoned home in Neutrahl, laying low until their energy returns in about half a year. One month later, news arrives that George has ordered the lords of each region to search for Hadis. In response, Jill and Zeke decide to join the Dragon Knights in order to gather intel and head for town. Jill sees a dragon and attacks it at its weak point, not realizing that it was a test for applicants.

Elentzia has her dragon Rosa do a compatibility test and Rosa attacks Jill, causing her to come home dejected. Hadis cheers Jill up, vowing to fight Rosa if nothing else. The next day, Jill is assigned to town patrol duty and spots Lawrence Marton, who was the aide-de-camp in the original timeline who always made correct decisions. As Lawrence tries to tell Jill a rumor, the second prince Risteard Teos Rave arrives asking Jill to deliver a message from Elentzia. After telling her the message, Elentzia tells Jill she and Risteard both believe that Hadis is the true emperor, but they cannot support him because their grandfathers, Duke Neutrahl and Duke Lehrsatz respectively, do not recognize Hadis as emperor having both lost a crown prince to the curse. She also tells Jill that Rosa sees Jill as her equal or a threat through her actions. Afterwards, Risteard has Jill greet his dragon, Brynhild. The dragon flees out of fear, causing Risteard to question who Jill is since the only other time Brynhild fled was when she met Hadis. At the end of the day, Jill returns home with Risteard having followed her, which Jill admits was on purpose knowing that he can be trusted. Hadis and Risteard engage in a shouting match after seeing that Hadis had been gardening.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Risteard and Jill bring Hadis over to see Elentzia to fill him in on the situation. To figure out where their allegiances lie, Jill asks for aid, then take Elentzia and Risteard hostage. But before they could get an answer, one of Elentzia's knights informs her that George has set the village on fire. The dragons quickly put out the fire while the village was evacuated resulting in no deaths. Afterwards, Risteard and Elentzia express their support for Hadis, and Elentzia brings Hadis to meet Gerald's sister Faris der Kratos, who had come to Rave to propose that she marries Hadis because she has six years before becoming a vessel for the goddess, and to use the engagement to resolve tensions between Kratos and Rave. However, Faris acted in secrecy because of Gerald's overprotectiveness. With the imperial forces issuing a proclamation, Jill tells Hadis to go through with the engagement so that Elentzia can mobilize her dragon knights, with Hadis just needing to refuse the betrothal. After Faris leaves, Hadis cooks dinner while Elentzia tells him that she got in contact with his brother Vissel and that Risteard's sister Frida is safe. Afterwards, Hadis becomes frightened that Jill is cheating on him because he heard a rumor that Jill and Lawrence fell in love, but Jill clears up the matter and tells him that she has been bullied by some of the dragon knights.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = With Vissel having dispatched the troops under the pretense of looking for Hadis, Elentzia instructs Hadis and Risteard to meet up with them at the handover location. Jill makes the two-day expedition to the location with Hadis, Zeke, Camilla, Risteard, and Lawrence and along the way, Jill explains that his relationship with Lawrence is meant to serve as a distraction. That night with the party camping for the night, Lawrence warns Zeke and Camilla that the plan is possibly a trap and review a contingency plan in that scenario to pass onto Jill. In that situation, the party is to head over to the dragon's nest to regroup. The next day, the party heads to the dragon's nest by following a dried-up river. At the nest, the party unexpectedly meets up with Elentzia, who reluctantly follows George's orders and had set up a trap there. Elentzia takes Jill hostage, and Hadis orders the rest of the party to retreat. Despite his magical power being sealed, Hadis easily deals with the Dragon Knights and jumps on Elentzia's dragon to free Jill while fighting George, but Jill gets attacked by the dragon's breath. While Hadis was fighting, the rest of the party retreats, but gets ambushed by George's troops. However, the stuffed bear and stuffed chicken that she brought along as a familiar saves them.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hadis is taken prisoner while Jill awakens inside the dragon's nest after being knocked out having been teleported there by a black dragon. However, the black dragon does not recognize Jill as the Dragon Consort and attacks her. Meanwhile, the remaining party members hide out at a nearby cave waiting until the enemy troops retreat. Jill figures out that George's Heavenly Sword was made from the Sacred Spear after learning from the black dragon that her magic is sealed by the goddess. Jill uses the magical eggshell she picked up to defeat the black dragon. She notices a black dragon egg that will hatch into a monster if the Dragon Emperor dies beforehand. Jill shows her conviction and obligation to protect Hadis, convincing the black dragon to allow her to ride on it and leave the nest. Jill rides the black dragon to the cave where Risteard and company are hiding to prepare for the counterattack. The party rides dragons that Risteard sent Brynhild to fetch and attack the enemy troops from above, while Jill engages in a fight with Elentzia. Jill's sword breaks, but refuses to surrender, while Risteard confronts Elentzia demanding her to explain why she betrayed Hadis. George suddenly appears and shows Risteard the family lineage scroll, revealing that Hadis is not a blood relative of the since his parents are Vissel's mother and a guard and thus, the imperial family is not descended from the Dragon Emperor and are at risk of being executed as scapegoats should the rightful bloodline continue. It is revealed Elentzia hid the truth so Hadis and Risteard wouldn't feel the need to kill one another. As Jill prepares to engage in combat with George, Hadis suddenly appears.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hadis goes berserk and tries to kill George, Elentzia, and Risteard, but Jill calms him down after promising to bear ten children with him and become a family with Elentzia and Risteard despite being unrelated by blood.

Half a month later in Rahelm, Jill's magic remains sealed despite the fake Heavenly Sword being destroyed, while Jill turns 11 years old, prompting Hadis to cancel the scheduled parade to throw a birthday party for Jill, but Jill tells Hadis that they can do both.

Faris reveals herself as the embodiment of the goddess who is aware of Jill's previous life. Jill declares that she will make Hadis happy and fights Faris using the Heavenly Sword against the Sacred Spear Faris retrieved after Jill broke it, but is overwhelmed forcing Rave to teleport her back to Rahelm. Hadis has his coronation ceremony where he declares his marriage to Jill, and Jill makes a sudden appearance to greet him.\n}}\n}}\nSee also\n* ''I'm the Villainess, So I'm Taming the Final Boss'', another light novel series by the same author.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Shōsetsuka ni Narō\n*\n*\n*\n*"
