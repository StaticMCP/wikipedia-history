It was the 32th edition of the Presidential Cup, since its establishment in 1966. Galatasaray won the match in extra time with a penalty scored by Hakan Şükür, which was awarded as a result of a referee mistake in the match played at Ankara 19 Mayıs Stadium, which ended 1-1 in normal time with the mutual goals of Ümit Davala and Roman Dąbrowski. Sabri Çelik, who connected to Show TV by phone after the end of the match, admitted that he had done injustice to Kocaelispor and stated:Until I came home from the airport, I told my journalist friends that I handed out what I saw in the match. What I saw was a contact made by Dąbrowski to Hakan with his hand and shoulder. Then Tayfur sent the ball out for a corner. I was behind the position. There may have been a distance of 25-30 metres. I watched the position many times, there is no virtue like accepting one's mistake. I saw that the position was not a penalty. I apologise to the football community, especially to that of Kocaelispor's and I accept my mistake.He quit refereeing after this match.\nMatch details\n| time = 20:00 TRT\n| team1 = Galatasaray\n| score = 2 – 1\n| report = [https://www.tff.org/Default.aspx?pageID=29&macId=44324 Report]\n| team2 = Kocaelispor\n| goals1 = Ümit Davala Hakan Şükür\n| goals2 = Dąbrowski\n| stadium = Ankara 19 Mayıs Stadium, Ankara\n| attendance =\n| referee = Sabri Çelik\n| event =\n| round =\n| score1 =\n| score2 =\n| aet = yes\n}}\n{| width=\"50%\"\n|Assistant referees:\nTurgay Güdü\nHasan Serdar Çakıroğlu\nFourth official:\nMuhittin Boşat\n|}\nReferences"
