It is an open-source project developed by the OpenSearch Software Foundation (a Linux Foundation project) written primarily in Java.\nAs of August 2024, AWS  reported that OpenSearch had \"tens of thousands\" of customers, while Elastic claimed to have over 20,000 subscribers. In the preceding year, OpenSearch had about 50 monthly contributors while ElasticSearch had between 70 and 90.\nHistory\nThe project was created in 2021 by Amazon Web Services as a fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana after Elastic NV changed the license of new versions of this software away from the open-source Apache License in favour of the Server Side Public License (SSPL). Amazon would hold sole ownership status and write access to the source code repositories, but invited pull requests from anyone. Other companies such as Logz.io, CrateDB, Red Hat and others announced an interest in building or joining a community to continue using and maintaining this open-source software.\nOn September 16, 2024, the Linux Foundation and Amazon Web Services announced the creation of the OpenSearch Software Foundation. Ownership of OpenSearch software was transferred from Amazon to OpenSearch Software Foundation, which is organized as an open technical project within the Linux Foundation. The Linux Foundation reported that at the time, \"OpenSearch recorded more than 700 million software downloads and participation from thousands of contributors and more than 200 project maintainers.\" The OpenSearch Software Foundation would launch with support from premier members Amazon Web Services, SAP, and Uber.\nProjects\nOpenSearch\nOpenSearch is a Lucene-based search engine that started as a fork of version 7.10.2 of the Elasticsearch service. It has Elastic NV trademarks and telemetry removed. It is licensed under the Apache License, version 2, without a Contributor License Agreement.  The maintainers have made a commitment to remain completely compatible with Elasticsearch in its initial versions.\nOpenSearch Dashboards\nOpenSearch Dashboards started as a fork of version 7.10.2 of Elastic's Kibana software, and is also under the Apache License, version 2.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
