Much of the book has translations of materials from Chinese authors of various backgrounds. Some of the material is stated by the editors to either probably not be of a good veracity or to be outright untrue. Stanley Hornbeck stated in a review that \"They serve admirably to acquaint the reader with\" aspects of the Ming and Qing dynasties.\nReviewer William Churchill wrote that the Mandate of Heaven was a \"central theme\" of the work.\nReception\nHornbeck argued that \"The present work is not on the whole as consistent or convincing as was their China under the Empress Dowager.\nReferences\n*\n*\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.loc.gov/item/14030273/ Annals and Memoirs of the Court of Peking] - Library of Congress\n* [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008617241 Annals and Memoirs of the Court of Peking] - Hathi Trust - [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t52f8926t PDF link]"
