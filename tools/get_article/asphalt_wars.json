The acting is uniformly flat and unconvincing, the racing sequences are outrageously cheap-looking, and the whole flick looks like it was shot on a streetcorner with my grandfather's old Handycam.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://letterboxd.com/film/asphalt-wars/ Asphalt Wars] at Letterbox DVD\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7QknehMOsA Trailer] at YouTube"
