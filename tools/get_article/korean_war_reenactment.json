Such displays normally focus on the \"material culture\" of the military during the war, with tents, vehicles, weapons, and other everyday items on display in as close to their original context as possible. Participants in uniform are generally available to answer questions or perform period activities for public observation.\nTactical re-enactment\nIn this form of Korean War re-enactment, participants attempt to \"walk in the shoes\" of a Korean War soldier, and simulate the experience as completely as possible with all its discomforts, but without physical danger. While other re-enactors may be portraying Chinese or North Korean soldiers, Korean War events lack the competitive \"win or lose\" wargaming aspect of more mainstream World War II re-enactments and tend to be much more scripted. Participants are generally required to create a persona and remain \"in character\" throughout the event.\nThe first such event documented was held in North Vernon, Indiana, by members of the 20th Century Tactical Studies Group portraying Canadian and North Korean troops on March 15, 1997.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://theforgottenwar.proboards61.com/index.cgi Korean War re-enactor forum]\n*[http://floridawar.tripod.com/5rctreenactors/ 5th RCT Korean War Re-enactors in Florida]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024552/http://www.livinghistory.nl/index.php?Itemid=7&id=6&option=com_content&view=article&limitstart=12&lang=nl Dutch Korean War Reenactment group], NDVN\n* [http://bf.onu.en.coree.xooit.com/index.php French Korean War re-eactment forum and group reenacting the French contingent in Korea], the BF ONU"
