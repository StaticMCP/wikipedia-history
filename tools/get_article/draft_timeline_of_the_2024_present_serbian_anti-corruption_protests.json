The Serbian railway infrastructure company issued a statement the same day saying that the canopy was not part of the renovations recently performed on the building.\n2 November\nThe Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Novi Sad ordered the questioning of at least 20 officials from various relevant government bodies, including the then minister of construction, transport and infrastructure, Goran Vesić.\nClaims quickly started to emerge that the canopy was included in the reconstruction of the railway station after all, contrary to the statements of government officials. Opposition politicians, such as Marinika Tepić of the Party of Freedom and Justice and Green-Left Front members of parliament placed the blame for the accident on systemic corruption in the country, with the latter organising a protest in front of the building of the government of Serbia in Belgrade demanding accountability and leaving red handprints on the pavement, a symbol which would later go on to become a defining emblem of the protest movement.\n3 November\nAnother protest was held, this time in the form of a march from the former Belgrade railway station, past the building of the government of Serbia and to the building of the Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure, demanding political accountability for the disaster and calling for the resignation of Goran Vesić.\n4 November\nGoran Vesić announced his resignation, but denied him or the ministry being at fault for the collapse.\n5 November\nA large protest was held in Novi Sad, with up to 22,000 people attending. The protest started out peacefully, calling for the immediate arrest and punishment of everyone at fault for the tragedy, the resignation of the mayor of Novi Sad Milan Đurić and the prime minister of Serbia Miloš Vučević and the release of classified documents pertaining to the reconstruction of the railway station, but quickly turned violent, with several demonstrators smashing up the windows of the local ruling Serbian Progressive Party offices, and later throwing red paint and stones and smashing the windows of the Novi Sad city hall. Several opposition politicians were arrested, such as the former mayor of Inđija Goran Ješić, Miran Pogačar of the Bravo movement and Mišlov of the Be a Hero civic group, the last of whom had brought a tank allegedly full of sewage which he dumped in front of the city hall. None of the people causing damage to the city hall were arrested, prompting opposition politicians to denounce them as agents provocateurs. Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić later visited his party offices in Novi Sad, leading to further tensions between supporters of the ruling party and its opponents. By the end of the day, a total of 14 people had been arrested.\n8 November\nA session of the SNS central committee was held, where Vučić called for resignations of government officials.\nThat evening, a 6-hour-long blockade of the Varadin bridge in Novi Sad was organised by local opposition activists, resulting in three arrests.\n15 November\nAt the initiative of local opposition groups, to mark exactly two weeks since the collapse, a large number of people stopped what they were doing at 11:52 for 14 minutes — one minute for each victim. This would be the first of many such demonstrations, with participants standing in traffic in silent vigil.\n19 November\nOpposition politicians gathered in front of the Novi Sad High Court and High Prosecutors office to protest the arrest of demonstrators and perceived inefficiency in dealing with the train station collapse, with no arrests being made, and only one statement made by the prosecutor's office, namely that 70 people had been interrogated in regards to the disaster.\n20 November\nReferences"
