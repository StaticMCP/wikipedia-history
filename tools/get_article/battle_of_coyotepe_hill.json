U.S. Marine Major Smedley Butler's Marine battalion, with whom Zeledón's rebels had skirmished on September 19, returned from its capture of Granada, Nicaragua on 3 October and shelled the rebel stronghold on Coyotepe.\nDuring pre-dawn hours on 4 October Butler's battalion, in concert with two Marine battalions and one from the  led by Marine Colonel Joseph H. Pendleton converged from different positions to storm the hill and capture it. Zeledón was killed during the battle, probably by his own men.\nAftermath\nWith the capture of León, Nicaragua two days later by U.S. Marines and the recapture of Masaya by Nicaraguan government troops, the Nicaraguan revolution of 1912 was essentially over. During the Somoza dictatorship the fortress was used as a prison. Occasionally dissidents imprisoned there would be taken from the fortress in a helicopter and dropped into a nearby volcano.\nSee also\n*Battle of Fort Dipitie\nReferences"
