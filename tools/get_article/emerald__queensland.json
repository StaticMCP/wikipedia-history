Emerald Post Office opened on 5 June 1879.\nEmerald State School opened on 3 November 1879. A secondary department was added to the school in 1919 but that department was closed in 1921.

It closed in 1992, in favour of a new weather station at the airport  south east.\n}}\nFlooding\nThe biggest impact of flooding of the Nogoa River in Emerald itself was that one side of Emerald was cut off from the other and caravans at the Carinya Caravan Park would be towed to higher ground each time the Nogoa River rose, to prevent the caravans from being completely submerged. This caravan park is now the site of the Centro Property where Coles Supermarket and other businesses operate. A former swamp area is now part of Kidd Street (a housing development) which was an old river course. The watercourse that extended along the back of the hospital, past the rear of Woolworths and past the Information Centre has been converted into a channel with a concrete section on one side near the information centre, reducing the channel in size by approximately two-thirds.
