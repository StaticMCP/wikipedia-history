The play premiered in 1993 at the Royal National Theatre, London, England.\nThe play is based on his behind the scenes observations of the Labour Party leadership during their unsuccessful General Election campaign of 1992.\nThe central character, party leader George Jones, is so smothered and constricted by his cautious advisers that eventually none of the great talents that brought him to prominence is visible to the public.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
