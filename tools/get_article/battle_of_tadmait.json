General Bugeaud's forces set out from El-Harrach on April 27, 1844, comprising an army of approximately 6,000 to 8,000 soldiers after assembling the gathering since April 25, 1844. The objective was to curb the influence of Emir Abdelkader and maintain control over tribes in the region.\nBattle\nAfter 18 days of marching towards Djurdjura, including clashes with Algerian resistance fighters, a portion of General Bugeaud's force was stationed in Tadmayt under the command of General Gentil, General Court, and Colonel Schmitt. The remaining forces continued advancing towards the mountains of Sidi Ali Bounab. General Bugeaud encountered resistance from the tribes and hamlets of Iflissen Umellil, leading to an attack by Ahmed ben Salem's horsemen. The Algerians withdrew towards the heights of Sidi Ali Bounab, and General Bugeaud eventually withdrew after losing 32 French soldiers. The Zawawa resistance also suffered significant losses, with some of their villages being burned and destroyed.\nAftermath\nFollowing the battle, the leader of Fleyset El-Jbel, known as \"Ben Zaamoum,\" advanced towards the French camp to negotiate a truce with France. He secured recognition as the leader of his tribe by the French.\nReferences"
