The compilation includes a track from the former's sessions for Wildwood Flower, as well as Johnny Cash's final recording.\nReception\nThe editorial staff at AllMusic Guide gave the compilation three out of five stars, with reviewer Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr., writing that the first several tracks are low points, but that several subsequent recordings are high quality, particularly Marty Stuart's cover of \"Never Let the Devil Get the Upper Hand of You\" and the version of \"Little Moses\" on this album that \"sounds more old-time than the Carter Family\". PopMatters noted that this is \"as good as a tribute album can be\", commenting on the quality of John Carter Cash's musical direction, the album packaging, and sums up the assessment as \"a reverent, well-executed, at times excellent, at times flawed, but always enjoyable, tribute album\".\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
