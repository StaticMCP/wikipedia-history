On 1 January 1852 Akitoye signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing the slave trade.\nKosoko fled to Epe and built up an independent base with about 400 warriors and mounted multiple attacks on Lagos; one on 5 August 1853 and another on 11 August 1853 which came dangerously close to the Oba's palace but was rebuffed just in time by a burst of fire from the British naval force under Commander Phillips of HMS Polyphemus.\nAfter much negotiation, Kosoko eventually signed the Treaty of Epe on 28 September 1854 with Consul Benjamin Campbell, agreeing not to make any claims to Lagos or to endanger commerce in Lagos. The treaty was a tactical success for Kosoko who got the British to recognize his state in Epe. In the big picture, however, the Lagos throne remained out of reach with Akitoye and Dosunmu's descendants firmly rooted.\nTreaty text\nThe text of the treaty is transcribed below:\n''Agreement entered into this 28th day of September 1854 between Kosoko his Caboceers and Chiefs and Chiefs, and Benjamin Campbell Esquire Her Brittanic Majesty's Consul for the Bight of Benin, and Thomas Miller Esquire Commander H.M.S.
