He then served under articles to a senior lawyer in Saint John, Robert Leonard Hazen, was made an attorney in 1863, and was called to the bar in 1865.\nKing was elected to the first provincial legislature of the new Canadian Confederation in 1867 and served in the Confederation Party government as minister without portfolio. When Andrew R. Wetmore resigned, the Confederation Party became the Liberal-Conservatives and King became Premier in 1870. At 30 years of age, King was the youngest person to assume the premier's office in New Brunswick history. Some members of King's caucus felt he was too close to the federal Conservatives of Sir John A. Macdonald and King was maneuvered out of the leadership by George L. Hathaway with King taking a position in the new cabinet. When Hathaway died in 1872, King became Premier for a second time serving until 1878.\nOne of King's major accomplishments was the Common Schools Act of 1871 which implemented a single, tax supported public school system.  As Attorney General, King appeared in the courts to defend the Act from constitutional challenges, including appearing before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire, in the case of Maher v. Town Council of Portland, which upheld the Act.\nIn 1880 he became a justice of the province's supreme court, the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick.\nJustice of the Supreme Court of Canada\nOn September 21, 1893, King was appointed by Prime Minister John Sparrow David Thompson to the Supreme Court of Canada to fill the vacancy created upon the death of Justice Christopher Salmon Patterson on July 24, 1893. King was described as \"having the pugnacity and aggressiveness that made him a leader,\" and historian Ian Bushnell notes his appointment may have been to have a countervailing force to Chief Justice Samuel Henry Strong.\nKing had a specialty in commercial and criminal law, and was described by Chief Justice Strong as \"probably the best commercial lawyer in the Dominion\". The replacement of an Ontario justice Patterson, with a second Maritimer justice in King occurred despite rumblings of a lack of representation of Western Canada. King had previous been rumored as a suitable appointee for the Supreme Court as early as 1888.\nOn his death in 1901, of a work-related heart attack, he was interred in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick.\nLegal historian Ian Bushnell notes that despite his eight years on the Supreme Court, King \"made no mark on the jurisprudence of Canada\".\nElection results\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140725015624/http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/judges-juges/bio-eng.aspx?id=george-edwin-king Supreme Court of Canada Biography]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081219204051/http://www.gnb.ca/legis/leglibbib/special_projects/premiers-bios/english/GEKing.pdf Government of New Brunswick profile of Premier King]"
