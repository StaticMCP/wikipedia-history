From then until 1995, the British heads of mission were ambassadors. In 1996, Mozambique joined the Commonwealth of Nations; Commonwealth countries exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors. Since 1996, the heads of mission have been high commissioners.\nHeads of mission\nAmbassadors\n*1975–1979: John Lewen\n*1979–1980: Achilles Papadopoulos\n*1980–1984: John Stewart\n*1984–1985: Eric Vines\n*1986–1989: James Allan\n*1989–1992: Maeve Fort\n*1992–1995: Richard Edis\nHigh commissioners\n*1996–2000: Bernard Everett\n*2000–2003: Robert Dewar\n*2003–2007: Howard Parkinson\n*2007–2010: Andrew Soper\n*2010–2014: Shaun Cleary\n*2014–2018: Joanna Kuenssberg\n*2018–2022: NneNne Iwuji-Eme\n*2022–: Helen Lewis\nReferences"
