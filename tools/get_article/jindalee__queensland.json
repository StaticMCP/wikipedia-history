In the , Jindalee had a population of 5,320 people.\nGeography\nJindalee is  by road south-west of the Brisbane CBD, and is a part of the Centenary suburbs. It is bordered by the Brisbane River to the north.\nThe Centenary Motorway enters the suburb from the north (Kenmore), crossing the river on the Centenary Bridge (), and forms the south-eastern boundary of the suburb before exiting on the south-east corner of the suburb into Mount Ommaney / Sinnamon Park.\nThe older part of the suburb is to the west of the motorway and is predominantly residential in character with individual houses. The Jindalee Golf Course is immediately west of the motorway (). To the east of the motorway are two large retail centres, separated by Sinnamon Road (). Also to the east of the motorway is a more recent townhouse estate between the retail precinct and the river ().\nThe north-western boundary with the river has a riverside park with boat ramp () provided by the Brisbane City Council.\nHistory\nWolston Estate was the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named.\nIn 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division, which contained the area of Wolston Estate.\nA small portion of Jindalee comes from the Wolston Estate, consisting of fifty-four farms on an area of three thousand acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction.\nIn 1903, the Sherwood Division became the Shire of Sherwood.\nIn 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\nThe Aboriginal meaning for Jindalee is \"bare hills\". Jindalee was the first of a series of suburbs originally called the \"Centenary\" suburbs, as planning for them commenced in 1959, the year of Queensland's centenary.\nPrior to development, the area had been largely used for grazing and dairy farming; however, it was developed as part of the Hooker Centenary Project, beginning in 1960. The 8th Australian Scout Jamboree was held in the southwestern corner of Jindalee, which was subdivided and became Jamboree Heights, a suburb in its own right.\nJindalee State School opened on 24 January 1966.\nThe 1974 floods caused extensive damage to Jindalee, including inundation of many houses, as well as severe damage to the Centenary Bridge. A gravel barge rammed into the upstream side, blocking the floodwaters and raising real fears that the bridge would collapse. The barge was partly sunk using explosives to reduce pressure on the bridge. When the floodwater receded, the barge was refloated and beached downstream to be cut up for scrap. The damage sustained by the bridge required its partial closure for repairs. For two years after the floods, the bridge was reduced to a single lane. The bridge was duplicated in 1980, providing two lanes each way.\nIn 1987 Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School in Darra opened a pre-school in Jindalee, renaming the school Darra-Jindalee Catholic School. In 2003 the facility in Jindalee closed and on 14 July 2008 the school returned to the name of the Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School operating only at Darra.\nCentenary State High School opened in January 1999.\nThe 2011 floods badly affected the suburb.\nDemographics\nIn the , Jindalee had a population of 5,320 people.\nIn the , Jindalee had a population of 5,320 people.\nEducation\nJindalee State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at 114 Burrendah Road ().
