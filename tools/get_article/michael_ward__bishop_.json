He was born in Newport, Shropshire, England, and he was educated at Trinity College Dublin. Ward was Regius Professor of Divinity at Trinity College Dublin from 1670 to 1678 and its Provost from 1674 to 1678; Dean of Lismore from 1670 to 1678; Archdeacon of Armagh from 1674 to 1678; Bishop of Ossory from 1678 to 1680; and Derry from 1680; until his death on 3 October 1681. His early death at 38 cut short a career which saw his meteoric rise to high office, fuelled by his great ambition.\nHis nephew, also  Michael Ward, was an Irish politician and judge, and father of the first Viscount Bangor.\nNotes\nExternal links"
