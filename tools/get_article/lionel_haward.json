Following service with the Royal Air Force Police during the Second World War, he worked in the National Health Service in psychiatric hospitals. He led a successful campaign to allow psychologists to testify as experts in court in England, and was then himself an expert witness at a number of high-profile trials. He latterly taught at the University of Surrey, rising to become Professor of Clinical Psychology.\nEarly life and education\nHaward was born in 1920. He was educated at the Earl Haig School in Aldershot, Hampshire, England. He later studied chemistry and psychology at the University of Bristol (BA, MA) and undertook a Doctor of Psychology (Dr Psy) degree at Leyden University in the Netherlands.\nCareer\nDuring the Second World War, Haward joined the Royal Air Force (RAF). He was first attached to RAF Technical Training Command, before transferring to the RAF Police with whom he served in Germany. In the aftermath of the liberation of the concentration camps, Haward \"drew up a list of characteristics that high-ranking Nazi war criminals might display\" that could be used in addition to survivors' witness testimony to identify SS officials and camp guards who had disguised themselves as ordinary soldiers or airmen; this strategy was an early example of offender profiling.\nHaward successfully led a campaign to allow psychologists to testify as experts in court in England; previously only medically qualified persons were allowed to testify on the \"mental functioning of witnesses or defendants\". He was an expert witness for many notable criminal trials in the 1960s and 1970s, including Donald Neilson, John Stonehouse MP, and the Oz magazine obscenity trials.\nHe worked in the National Health Service as a clinical psychologist at psychiatric hospitals, including Barrow Hospital, Bristol, Winterton Hospital, County Durham, and Graylingwell Hospital, Chichester. In 1973, he joined the University of Surrey as a reader in clinical psychology. He rose to become Professor of Clinical Psychology, giving his inaugural lecture in 1979 titled \"Hypnosis in the service of research\". He retired from the university in 1987 and was appointed professor emeritus, but continued to work as an honorary consultant psychologist and as an expert witness.\nSelected works\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
