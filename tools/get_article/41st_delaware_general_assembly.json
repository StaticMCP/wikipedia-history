Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 7, 1817, two weeks before the beginning of the first year of the administration of Governor John Clark.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Federalist majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Henry Molleston, Sussex County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Nathan Vickers, Sussex County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*George Clark Jr.\n*Caesar Augustus Rodney\n*Nicholas Van Dyke Jr.\n|\n:Kent County\n*George Cummins\n*Henry Molleston\n*Jacob Stout\n|\n:Sussex County\n*Benjamin Burton\n*Jesse Green\n*Joseph Maull\n|}\nHouse of Representatives\nRepresentatives were elected by the public for a one-year term.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Samuel H.
