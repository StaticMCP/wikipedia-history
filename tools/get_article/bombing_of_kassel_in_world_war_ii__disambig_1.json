In a single deadliest raid on 22–23 October 1943, 150,000 inhabitants were bombed-out, at least 6,000 people died, the vast majority of the city center was destroyed, and the fire of the most severe air raid burned for seven days. When the US First Army captured Kassel on 3 April 1945, only 50,000 inhabitants remained of its 1939 population of 236,000.\nTargets\nAs well as being the capital of the provinces of Hesse-Nassau and Kurhessen, Kassel had some important targets:\n*Fieseler aircraft facility\n*Henschel & Sohn facilities, maker of the Tiger I and King Tiger heavy tanks\n* The Henschel & Sohn firm's locomotive plant\n* engine plant\n* motor transport plant\n* railway works\n* Military HQs at Wehrkreis IX, and Bereich Hauptsitz Kassel\n* Central Germany HQ, highway & railway construction\n* Regional Supreme Court\nBombing raids\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Bombing raids on Kassel during World War II\n!style= width=20%        | Date\n!style= width=18%         | Target\n!style=    |\n|-\n|\n|\n| 12px 10 Wellingtons and 3 Stirlings to Emden, Hamburg, Kassel and Aachen.\n|-\n|\n| Henschel\n| 12px 306 aircraft destroyed/seriously damaged 144/317 buildings, particularly in the city southwest.  Three Henschel buildings were seriously damaged, and 43/251 were killed/injured.\n|-\n| 8/9 September 1942\n|\n| 12px Nearly 100 aircraft hit several armament factories, and destroyed the railway station, the Red Palace, and the  Museum Fridericianum, home of the Kassel State Library, along with 350,000 books, seven-eighths of the library's entire book collection.\n|-\n| 2/3 October 1943\n|\n| 12px The Pathfinder Force (PFF) was not able to find the center of the city, and most bombs into Ihringshausen and Bettenhausen.  In addition to considerable damage, an ammunition store was hit.\n|-\n| 3/4 October 1943\n|\n| 12px 547 aircraft used H2S radar; the main weight of bombs fell on the western suburbs and outlying towns and villages.\n|-\n| 22/23 October 1943\n| city centre\n| 12px 569 bombers dropped more than 1,800 tons of bombs (including 460,000 magnesium fire sticks) in a concentrated pattern. For deception, the attack used Operation Corona radio spoofing and a Frankfurt diversionary raid. The blaze caused a minor firestorm similar in nature to that at Hamburg.  Damage to the main telephone exchange and the city's water pipes hindered firefighting efforts.\n|-\n| 18/19 March 1944\n|\n| 12px 11 Mosquitos on a diversionary raid.\n|-\n| 30/31 March 1944\n|\n| 12px 34 Mosquitos on  diversionary raids to Aachen, Cologne and Kassel.\n|-\n| 27/28 September 1944\n|\n| 12px 46 Mosquitos on a diversionary raid.\n|-\n| 28 September 1944\n| Henschel motor transport plant\n|  Mission 652: 243 of 262 dispatched B-24s bombed the Kassel/Henschel motor transport plant.\n1942:\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/jan42.htm January] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/feb42.htm February] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/mar42.htm March] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/apr42.htm April] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/may42.htm May] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/jun42.htm June] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/jul42.htm July] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/aug42.htm August] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/sep42.htm September] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/oct42.htm October] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/nov42.htm November] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/42/dec42.htm December] 1943:\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/jan43.htm January] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/feb43.htm February] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/mar43.htm March] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/apr43.htm April] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/may43.htm May] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/jun43.htm June] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/jul43.htm July] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/aug43.htm August] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/sep43.htm September] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/oct43.htm October] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/nov43.htm November] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/43/dec43.htm December] 1944:\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/jan44.htm January] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/feb44.htm February] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/mar44.htm March] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/apr44.htm April] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/may44.htm May] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/jun44.htm June] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/jul44.htm July] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/aug44.htm August] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/sep44.htm September] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/oct44.htm October] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/nov44.htm November] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/dec44.htm December] 1945:\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/jan45.htm January] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/feb45.htm February] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/mar45.htm March] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/apr45.htm April] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/may45.htm May] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/jun45.htm June] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/jul45.htm July] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/aug45.htm August] ,\n[http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/sep45.htm September]\n|-\n| 3/4 October 1944\n|\n| 12px 43 Mosquitos.\n|-\n| 15/16 October 1944\n|\n| 12px 2 Mosquitos on a diversionary raid.\n|-\n| 9/10 November 1944\n|\n| 12px 3 Mosquitos.\n|-\n| 27/28 December 1944\n|\n| 12px 7 Mosquitos on Oboe (navigation) trials (some flew over Kassel).\n|-\n| 6/7 January 1945\n|\n| 12px 20 Mosquitos.\n|-\n| 18/19 January 1945\n|\n| 12px 12 Mosquitos.\n|-\n| 21/22 January 1945\n|\n| 12px 76 Mosquitos\n|-\n| 2/3 March 1945\n|\n| 12px 67 Mosquitos on a training raid.\n|-\n| 8/9 March 1945\n|\n| 12px 176 aircraft; the last heavy raid by the RAF on Kassel.\n|-\n| 18/19 March 1945\n|\n| 12px 24 Mosquitos.\n|-\n| 20/21 March 1945\n|\n| 12px 16 Mosquitos on a diversionary raid.\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* List of strategic bombing over Germany in World War II\nReferences\nSources\n* Werner Dettmar: Die Zerstörung Kassels im Oktober 1943.
