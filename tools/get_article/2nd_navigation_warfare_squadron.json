It is a component of Space Operations Command's Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Integrated Mission Delta (Provisional) and headquartered at Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado.\nThe squadron is augmented by reserve personnel from the 19th Space Operations Squadron, part of the 310th Space Wing.\nMission\nThe squadron performs the command and control mission for the Global Positioning System satellite constellation. GPS is the world's premiere space-based position, velocity and timing system, capable of providing precision navigation and timing capability simultaneously to an unlimited number of properly equipped users. Continuous GPS availability and unprecedented signal accuracy has resulted in widespread integration of the technology; numerous military, commercial and international users have embraced GPS.\nHistory\nThe squadron was originally constituted as the 2d Surveillance Squadron and activated on 16 January 1962 under North American Air Defense Command. It was then organized on 1 February 1962 at Ent Air Force Base under the 9th Aerospace Defense Division, under which it operated SPACETRACK, the USAF globe-spanning space surveillance network, from 1962 through 1967. The squadron was inactivated on 1 January 1967.\nIt was redesignated the 2d Satellite Control Squadron as the first operational squadron of the 2d Space Wing. It was activated at Falcon Air Force Station on 1 October 1985.\nThe squadron has controlled the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System satellite constellation and managed the Nuclear Detonation System in support of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty since 1987.\nOn 30 January 1992, as part of an Air Force reorganization, 2 SCS was redesignated the 2d Space Operations Squadron.\nOn June 18, 2004, a 24/7 user focal point, the GPSOC, was established.\nIn late 2005, several National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency monitor stations were integrated into the network to improve navigation accuracy and signal monitoring.\nThe unit had one geographically separated unit, Detachment 1, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. It was responsible for maintenance of a GPS Ground Antenna, Monitor Station, and various operational test assets. It is now discontinued, though contractors remained to perform the mission.\nOn 15 October 2024, 2 SOPS was redesignated as the 2nd Navigation Warfare Squadron when the PNT Delta (Provisional) was redesignated as Mission Delta 31.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 2d Surveillance Squadron (Sensor) and activated, on 16 January 1962 (not organized)\n: Organized on 1 February 1962\n: Discontinued and inactivated on 1 January 1967\n* Redesignated 2d Satellite Control Squadron on 16 Jul 1985\n: Activated on 1 October 1985\n: Redesignated 2d Space Operations Squadron on 30 Jan 1992\nAssignments\n* Air Defense Command, 16 January 1962 (not organized)\n* 9th Aerospace Defense Division, 1 February 1962 – 1 January 1967\n* 2d Space Wing, 1 October 1985 – 30 January 1992\n* 50th Operations Group, 30 January 1992 – 24 July 2020\n* Space Delta 8, July 2020 – 13 October 2023\n* Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Integrated Mission Delta (Provisional), 13 October 2023 – present\nStations\n* Ent Air Force Base, Colorado, 1 February 1962 – 1 January 1967\n* Falcon Air Force Station (later Falcon Air Force Base, Schriever Space Force Base), Colorado, 1 October 1985 – present\nDecorations\nAir Force Outstanding Unit Award\n* 1 June 1964 – 31 May 1966\n* 1 December 1987 – 30 November 1989\n* 1 September 1990 – 31 August 1991\nList of commanders\n* Lt Col Steven C.
