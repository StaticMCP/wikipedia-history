Republicans only carried the county three times, all amidst national landslides, and the county almost always weighed in to the left of the national popular vote. However, in 2016, the county swung dramatically towards Republican Donald Trump, going from a 21-point Democratic margin in 2012 to a more than 20-point Republican margin in 2016. With this 41-point swing, Howard County voted Republican in a presidential election for the first time since 1984, with Trump's 57.27% vote share marking the strongest Republican performance in the county since 1952. In 2020, Trump further expanded his vote share to 63.07%, the best performance for any candidate in Howard County since Warren G. Harding a century earlier. Trump improved yet again in 2024, taking more than 65% of the vote in the county. Overall, Howard County shifted to the right from 2012 to 2024 by 53 percentage points, representing one of the strongest such rightward shifts for any county in the country.\n|source2=}}\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Howard County, Iowa\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.howard-county.com/ Howard County Development Commission's website]\n*[http://co.howard.ia.us/ Howard County Government Website]"
