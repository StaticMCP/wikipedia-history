The main aim of the expedition was to extend the magnetic survey of New Zealand by investigating Campbell Island and the Auckland Islands, but botanical, biological and zoological surveys were also conducted.\nPreparations\nThe planning committee of the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury approached the various branches of the New Zealand Institute for support and armed with this, approached the New Zealand Minister in Charge of Marine Department, John A. Millar, for possible transport. On being informed that neither of the New Zealand Government steam ships would be available, the committee sent a delegation to the Acting Premier, William Hall-Jones.\nBy 8 June 1907, it was confirmed that  under the captaincy of John Bollons would be available to transport the expedition.\nPersonnel\nA group of 26&nbsp;participants went on the expedition. Although Thomas Kirk requested that the expedition include a ‘distinguished lady botanist’, the Council of the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury ‘could not see its way clear to take a lady’, and all 26 participants were men.\nThe group was split into two main parties—one for Campbell Island and one for the Auckland Islands—with the intention that the groups were to be dropped off to survey while NZGSS Hinemoa conducted its regular round of checking the castaway depots at other subantarctic islands before returning to pick the groups up.\nBotany survey\n* Leonard Cockayne\n* Bernard Aston\n* John Smaillie Tennant\n* Arthur Dorrien-Smith\n* Robert M.

Some disembarked for an episode of botanical collecting. The voyage continued at 21:00 that evening with an overnight steam to the Snares Islands, which were reached at 06:00. All of 15&nbsp;November was spent at The Snares exploring the islands and collecting soil, rock, zoological and botanical specimens.\nBy 16 November, the expedition arrived at Auckland Islands and discovered the castaways of the wreck of the . After ensuring that the castaways were supplied with provisions and taking on board one of the castaways to act as a cook for the Campbell Island expedition group, the Auckland Islands expedition party was dropped off at Camp Cove.\nCampbell Island was reached on 18 November, and the remainder of the expedition was dropped off. Hinemoa returned and picked up the Campbell Island group on 25&nbsp;November. While Hinemoa was away, the Auckland Islands group, who had also been supplied with a whaleboat and crew, were rowed to various locations around Auckland Islands during their ten-day stay. With the return of the Hinemoa on 26&nbsp;November, the Auckland Islands group packed up and boarded the vessel.\nOn 27 November, the ship steamed to Enderby Island for further exploration and specimen hunting, before moving on to Disappointment Island on 28&nbsp;November. A number of expedition members collected specimens and samples while Captain Bollons organised the exhumation of the Dundonalds chief mate, Jabez Peters, for reburial at Hardwicke cemetery. The funeral was held that evening. Hinemoa'' arrived back in Bluff on 30&nbsp;November.\nReferences\nSources\nBibliography\n*\n*\nNewspapers\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\nExternal links\n*"
