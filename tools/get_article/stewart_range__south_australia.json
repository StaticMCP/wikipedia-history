It was renamed as Stewarts in 1940.  Boundaries for the locality within the former District Council of Lucindale were created in 1998 which includes “the Government Town of Stewarts“ and was given the “long established name” which was derived from a range of hills known as Stewart Range. The portion within the Naracoorte Lucindale Council was added on 12 April 2001.  A school named as \"Stewart's Range\" opened in 1885 and closed in 1945 after a name change in 1941. The western two-thirds of the locality is roughly the northern half of the Hundred of Spence. The eastern portion is part of the Hundred of Naracoorte.\nThe Stewarts railway station opened on the narrow gauge Kingston-Naracoorte railway line in 1876. The railway was converted to broad gauge in 1957 and closed in 1987. It was dismantled in 1991.\nThe principal land use in the locality is primary production.\nThe 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that  Stewart Range had a population of 67 people.\nStewart Range is located within the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of MacKillop and the local government area of the Naracoorte Lucindale Council.\nReferences"
