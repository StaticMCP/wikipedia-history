He was also the quartermaster general.\nOn the same day as the Bloody Sunday (1920) massacre he was one of the gunman involved in the shooting of 18 suspected members of the Cairo gang.\nAccording to Irish Historian Tim Pat Coogan, Cullen and two other intelligencers broke the Dublin Castle spy system.\nHe sided with the Pro-Treaty forces during the Irish Civil War and joined the Irish National Army, rising to the rank of Major-General.\nWhen the Irish Republican Army Organisation (IRAO) was founded, Cullen was elected organiser.\nDuring Collins’ funeral he led the procession carrying his coffin to Glasnevin Cemetery.\nDeath\nHe died from asphyxia due to accidental drowning (according to his death certificate), on 20 June 1926 and was buried in Rathnew cemetery. Up until the mid 1960s, veterans from Dublin and Wicklow held an annual commemoration in his honor.\nBibliography\n*'[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fear-Not-Storm-Cullen-Revolutionary/dp/0970415532 Fear Not the Storm: The Story of Tom Cullen, an Irish Revolutionary by Cathal Liam]'\nReferences"
