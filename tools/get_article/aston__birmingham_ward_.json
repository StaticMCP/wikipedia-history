As a typical inner city ward, which tends to lose population the boundaries have been altered on a number of occasions.\nElection fraud scandal\nIn 2004 the ward saw a voter fraud scandal in which Labour councillors were guilty of a systematic attempt to rig elections. They had set up a \"vote-rigging factory\" in a disused warehouse, stealing and intercepting hundreds and possibly thousands of ballot papers to achieve this.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1487144/Judge-lambasts-postal-ballot-rules-as-Labour-6-convicted-of-poll-fraud.html Judge lambasts postal ballot rules as Labour 6 convicted of poll fraud – Telegraph] Three councillors, Mohammed Islam, Muhammed Afzal (later cleared) and Mohammed Kazi were convicted of voter fraud, with the elections having to be rerun.
