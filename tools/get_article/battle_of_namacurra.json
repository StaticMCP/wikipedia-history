It took place on July 1–3, 1918, at the Namacurra River near Namacurra. It was the deadliest engagement of German general Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck's campaign into Mozambique; 209 of the British and Portuguese died.\nBackground\nOn 25 November 1917, during World War I's African theatre, German general Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck crossed the Rovuma River from German East Africa into Portuguese Mozambique. They started going south. By the end of March 1918, British general Jacob van Deventer, whose troops were following von Lettow's troops in an attempt to encircle them, expected von Lettow to turn back into German East Africa. Von Lettow kept going south. British and Portuguese troops could not stand their ground to the German forces. The British Gold Coast Regiment withdrew their forces. At Ile, the defending Portuguese troops ran off after they spotted the Germans. They left behind a large amount of supplies, more than von Lettow could carry. Much of it was burned to prevent future use by the British or Portuguese.\nNamacurra, also spelled Nhamacurra, was a town that had a newly established supply depot for British and Portuguese armies, which contained \"vast warehouses stuffed full of arms and ammunition, food, wine, and whiskey\". It was connected by railroad to the nearby port town of Quelimane, where the British feared the Germans would seize vessels and escape from Africa.\nBattle\nThe battle started on July 1, 1918. It was the southernmost strike of Vorbeck's campaign. The Portuguese offered stiffer resistance than they had at Ile. Three Portuguese battalions, aided by two British King's African Rifle companies commanded by Colonel Eric Gore-Browne, fought against three German companies commanded by Captain Müller. By July 3, von Lettow had brought out his main force. The Portuguese units were steadily pushed back, until they were forced to retreat across the Namacurra River. One hundred European and African men drowned, including Gore-Browne. The fighting ended on the afternoon of July 3.\nAftermath\nOn Vorbeck's campaign, there were about 100 engagements, and Namacurra was the most deadly of them. 209 of the British and Portuguese lost their lives, and 540 were taken as prisoner. The Germans received the enemy spoils. Days later, the bodies of the men who drowned in the river were found downstream. Instead of going to Quelimane, the Germans looped back across the Namiurre River to Numarroe, and went north. For a few days, while the Germans were going north, van Deventer's forces kept going south to Quelimane. Van Deventer's forces, still chasing von Lettow, admitted defeat in September 1918. Von Lettow started losing his men for various reasons, and eventually turned back into German East Africa.\nNamacurra and a native revolt against Portuguese misrule in Angoche effectively ended Portugal's involvement in World War I's East African theater.\nSee also\n*Portuguese campaign in Mozambique (World War I)\nReferences\nSources\n*David Smith, Graham Turner (2022).
