A force of roughly 500 Dominican troops, a portion of the Army of the South, led by General Manuel de Regla Mota,  encountered an  outnumbering force of roughly 10,000 troops of the Haitian Army led by General Souffrand and was routed, fleeing to Azua de Compostela.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
