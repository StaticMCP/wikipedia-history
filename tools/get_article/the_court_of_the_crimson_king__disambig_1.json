Released as a single, it reached No. 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the only King Crimson single to chart on the Hot 100.\nBackground\nThe track is dominated by a distinctive, repeated four-bar riff performed on a Mellotron. The main part of the song is split into four stanzas, divided by an instrumental section called \"The Return of the Fire Witch\". The song climaxes at seven minutes, but after a pause continues with a brief instrumental interlude called \"The Dance of the Puppets\", before ending with a reprise of the main theme. The music was composed by Ian McDonald, and the lyrics were written by Peter Sinfield.\nCash Box said \"Unusual lyric imagery and instrumental impact with a 'Jude' hypnotism should set the side on a breakout path.\" Record World called it \"a heavy hard rock item with some classy jazz overtones.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Robert Fripp – guitars\n* Ian McDonald – Mellotron, flute, reed organ, harpsichord, backing vocals\n* Greg Lake – bass guitar, lead and backing vocals\n* Michael Giles – drums, percussion, backing vocals\n* Peter Sinfield – lyrics\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
