The station was on the former Midland and South Western Junction Railway, which was a north–south through-route between the Midlands and the south coast ports and which had been built through Collingbourne Kingston in 1882.\nThe M&SWJR did not provide a station at Collingbourne Kingston, which was served by Collingbourne railway station at Collingbourne Ducis, 1.5 miles away. But in 1932, after the M&SWJR had been taken over by the Great Western Railway in the 1923 Grouping, a halt was built for the village in an effort to generate traffic in the face of competition from road transport. The construction of the station was fairly rudimentary: railway sleeper platforms with corrugated iron shelters. No staff were ever provided and tickets were sold at No 54 High Street.\nTraffic on the M&SWJR line declined heavily after the war and the line closed to passenger and goods traffic in 1961. There are no traces of Collingbourne Kingston Halt today, apart from a road bridge over the former line.\nRoutes\nLine and station closed |next=Line and station closed |route=Midland and South Western Junction RailwaySwindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway |col= }}\nReferences\n* Wiltshire Railway Stations, Mike Oakley, Dovecote Press, Wimborne, 2004, , pages 43–44"
