Cheshire described it as \"Mumblecore Civil War,\" critiquing its minimalist narrative, contemporary-sounding dialogue, and underwhelming period atmosphere. He argued that the film’s naturalistic aesthetic failed to convincingly portray the era or the realities of war, stating, \"War is not hell in Men Go to Battle. It’s barely anything.\" He also cited issues with the acting and period detail, asserting that the script and performances lacked the skill needed to effectively represent the time period. Overall, Cheshire concluded that the film squandered the rich thematic and historical potential of its setting.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.filmmovement.com/filmcatalog/index.asp?MerchandiseID=462 Film Movement official site]"
