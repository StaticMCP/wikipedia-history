In 2000, The Grierson Trust forged a link with the UK Film Council in order to expand and add prestige to the awards. The awards have grown in stature and recognition over the years.\nAwards trophy\nThe awards trophy is in the form of a bust of John Grierson. Sculpted posthumously by Ivor Roberts-Jones, it was struck in a limited edition of 10, with three copies held by the Trust.\nOriginally, the trophy was given to the award winner for one year before being returned and presented to the next recipient.\nJohn Grierson\nJohn Grierson was a leading documentary filmmaker, and he has also been attributed to have coined the name \"documentary\". He was born in Scotland in 1898. Grierson was the founder of a new movement of documentary film in the 1930s. He started the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit, and in 1933 the GPO Film Unit, gathering together such diverse and exciting talents as Humphrey Jennings, Paul Rotha and Alberto Cavalcanti.  His ground-breaking work on the Scottish herring fleet, Drifters, had its premiere in 1929 alongside the first British showing of Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin. In 1936, he produced the celebrated Night Mail, directed by Harry Watt with script by W.H. Auden and score by Benjamin Britten.\nThe Grierson Trust\nFounded as the Grierson Memorial Trust in 1972, shortly after the death of John Grierson, the Grierson Trust is a registered UK charity that exists to celebrate the best factual and documentary filmmaking from both the UK and globally. The trust also nurtures factual TV talent via training and mentoring schemes. Since its inception it has had nine chairs:\n* 1972 – ?: Basil Wright\n* ? – 1987: Edgar Anstey\n* 1989 – 2000: John Chittock\n* 2000 – 2002: Larry Chrisfield\n* 2002 – 2006: Edward Mirzoeff\n* 2006 – 2008: Jenny Barraclough\n* 2008 – 2010: Murray Weston\n* 2010 – 2013: Dawn Airey\n* 2013 – Present: Lorraine Heggessey\nIn 2022, to mark its fiftieth anniversary, the Trust published its 50 must-see documentaries since its inception in 1972.\nJudging\nAs of 2023, the Grierson Awards employ a two-stage judging process, with each individual entry reviewed by a minimum of three members of the Trust.\nA long list of eight nominees for each category is drawn up; then the contenders are judged by five-person juries, drawn from documentary makers, broadcasters and subject experts. The jurors then decide on the final four shortlisted nominations, and subsequently the winner for each category.\nThe judges look for evidence of quality, integrity, creativity, originality and overall excellence. They also consider the steps taken by producers to ensure the best diversity and inclusion practices, as this is considered key to the integrity and quality of any documentary. Since 2020, entrants to all but the Best Student Documentary category have been required to provide a statement on diversity and inclusion.\nThe Grierson Trustees' Award and Grierson Hero of the Year Award are honorary and not selected by the jury process.\n2000–2024 winners\n2024 winners\nThe eligibility window was for documentaries broadcast or available to stream in the UK between 1 June 2023 and 31 May 2024.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n|+Hosted by Kerry Godliman: 7 November 2024 at The Roundhouse, London.\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Best Single Documentary – Domestic\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" |Best Single Documentary – International\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Best Current Affairs Documentary\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n* Winner — Me and the voice in My Head: (Channel 4). dir.
