Based in modern-day Iran, it was the largest empire by that point in history, spanning a total of . The empire spanned from the Balkans and Egypt in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east.\nAround the 7th century BC, the region of Persis in the southwestern portion of the Iranian plateau was settled by the Persians. Cyrus conquered the Medes as well as Lydia and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, marking the establishment of a new imperial polity under the Achaemenid dynasty.\nIn the modern era, the Achaemenid Empire has been recognized for its imposition of a successful model of centralized bureaucratic administration, its policy of tolerance, building complex infrastructure such as road systems and an organized postal system, the use of official languages across its territories, and the development of civil services, including a large, professional army. Its advancements inspired the implementation of similar styles of governance by a variety of later empires.\nPre-Imperial Kings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Achaemenes\n|\n|First ruler of the Achaemenid kingdom and founder of the dynasty.
