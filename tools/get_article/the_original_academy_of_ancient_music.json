The group's raison d'être was to study the music of the past through the performance of it. In 1973 a new Academy of Ancient Music was established, also focussed on performing the music of the past.\nOrigin\nThe group began life in 1726 as The Academy of Vocal Music, whose membership was restricted to Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal or of ‘the Cathedrals’, and no other persons ‘but such as profess Musick, and shall be approv’d by the Majority’. Among the early participants, in addition to singers from the Chapel Royal and St Paul's Cathedral (and later Westminster Abbey), were a  number of eminent names from the worlds of music, politics and fine art, such as:\n* the musicians Giovanni Bononcini (1670–1747), Giovanni Stefano Carbonelli (1690/91–1772), Francesco Geminiani (1697–1762), Nicola Haym (1678–1729), Giovanni Battista Sammartini (c.1700–75) and Senesino (1686–1758)\n* political figures such as the Earl of  Plymouth, Lord Paisley, Viscount Percival (later the First Earl of Egmont), the Earl of Abercorn, and the Modenese diplomat Giuseppe Riva.\n* the  artist William Hogarth.\nThe composer and theorist Johann Christoph Pepusch emerged as the musical director. In 1731 the group changed its name to The Academy of Ancient Music.\nVenues\nFrom the outset the academy met at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, Strand, London. Later in the century the academy moved its performances to the newly built, commodious Freemasons Hall in Great Queen Street, Covent Garden. Details of the academy's meetings often appeared in the London  press.\nRepertoire\nThe programmes of the academy show a marked preference for the music of pre-Reformation England along with later English works by such as Purcell and Handel, as well as Italian music of the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\nDirectors\nThe academy had just three musical directors:\n* 1726 - Johann Christoph Pepusch (1667–1752)\n* 1752 - Benjamin Cooke (1734–1793)\n* 1784 - Samuel Arnold (1740–1802)\nDemise\nThe Academy of Ancient Music began to decline at the closing of the eighteenth century with its last known concert in 1802.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Tim Eggington (2014) The Advancement of Music in Enlightenment England: Benjamin Cooke and the Academy of Ancient Music (Music in Britain, 1600–2000).
