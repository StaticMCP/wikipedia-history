They were called the \"Erotic Awards\" from 2002 until 2013 when they become what is now known as the Sexual Freedom Awards.  The awards ceremony is an annual event in London with a semi-finals event and the finals held at the \"Sex Maniacs Ball\", but now is a fully fledged award night in its own right. The Leydig Trust organise these events which raise funds for the \"Outsiders Club\", a charity that supports disabled people to find partners.\nThe Erotic Awards had twenty-one award categories including \"Campaigner\", \"Sex Worker\", \"Striptease Artist\", \"Fashion\", \"Academic\", \"Writer\", and \"Film\". Nominations come from the public, and three finalists in each category are then selected by the \"Grand Jury of Conspicuous Sensuality\". The winners are announced during the ceremony, where the finalists' work is also exhibited and performed. All award winners receive the Erotic Awards’ signature trophy, the \"Flying Penis\".\nPast winners\n1994\n* Best Erotic Publication – Journal of Erotica\n* Most Pleasurable Erotic Gadget – Get Wet's Silicone Dildos\n* Best Erotic Writer – Carol A.
