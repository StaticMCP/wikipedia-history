It was founded in 2022 as the Buffalo Party of Alberta and adopted its current name in February 2025. The party supports a binding referendum on Alberta independence and a subsequent non-binding referendum on joining the United States.\nHistory\nThe Buffalo Party of Alberta was registered as a political party with Elections Alberta on January 20, 2022. The first leader of the party was John Molberg. The party held a launch event in Calgary on May 12, 2022.\nThe party ran one candidate, Andrew Jacobson, in the 2023 Alberta provincial election in the district Edmonton-Strathcona.\nIn March 2024, Andrew Jacobson was listed by Elections Alberta as the new interim leader of the party.\nOn February 10, 2025, the party changed its name to the Republican Party of Alberta.\nOn April 11, 2025, Cameron Davies was acclaimed as the new leader. The party made the announcement of his leadership on April 29.\nIn May 2025, the Republican Party and the Independence Party of Alberta signed a memorandum of understanding, which sought to advance and unify the independence movement in Alberta. The parties worked together to select candidates who ran under the Republican banner in the 2025 Alberta provincial by-elections.\nOn May 14, 2025, the party announced its first candidate since their rebranding: Fred Munn would run in the Edmonton-Ellerslie by-election. On May 20, leader Cameron Davies was announced as the candidate for the Olds-Didsbury-Three Hills by-election. On May 27, Ravina Chand was named the candidate in the Edmonton-Strathcona by-election. The party did not win any of the elections, which were held on June 23, 2025.\nIdeology\nAs the Buffalo Party, the party did not call for Alberta independence but rather more autonomy from the federal government. After becoming the Republican Party, it shifted towards a separatist stance, describing itself as being \"at the forefront advocating for Alberta independence\". It proposes holding a binding referendum on Alberta independence and a subsequent non-binding referendum on Alberta joining the United States as a state or territory.\nAside from the independence movement, the Republican Party also supports firearm ownership and abolishing the restrictive federal regulations. It supports stricter immigration laws and the restriction of temporary foreign worker permits. The party is fiscally conservative, supporting lower taxes, responsible spending, and lean government focused mainly on core services. The party supports freedom of speech and the free market. On issues such as gun rights, smaller government, and stricter immigration, the party has similar viewpoints as the United States Republican Party. The party advocates a melting pot society after leaving Canada.\nMembership\nThe Republicans announced that 48 hours after the 2025 Canadian federal election, the party grew by 11,394 members. In mid-May 2025, the party said it had given out 20,000 free memberships. As of June 2025, the party claims to have reached 24,000 members.\nLeaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Leader\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term in office\n!Notes\n|-\n!
