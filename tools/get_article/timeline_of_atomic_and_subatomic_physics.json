R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble postulate that a fundamental quantum field, now called the Higgs field, permeates space and, by way of the Higgs mechanism, provides mass to all the elementary subatomic particles that interact with it. While the Higgs field is postulated to confer mass on quarks and leptons, it represents only a tiny portion of the masses of other subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons. In these, gluons that bind quarks together confer most of the particle mass. The result is obtained independently by three groups: François Englert and Robert Brout; Peter Higgs, working from the ideas of Philip Anderson; and Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble.. The Higgs mechanism was originally proposed already in 1938 by Ernst Stueckelberg\n* 1964 Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig independently propose the quark model of hadrons, predicting the arbitrarily named up, down, and strange quarks. Gell-Mann is credited with coining the term quark, which he found in James Joyce's book Finnegans Wake.\n* 1964 Sheldon Glashow and James Bjorken predict the existence of the charm quark. The addition is proposed because it allows for a better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks and other particles to decay), equalizes the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implies a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.\n* 1964 John Stewart Bell shows that all local hidden variable theories must satisfy Bell's inequality\n* 1964 Peter Higgs considers the breaking of local phase symmetry\n* 1964 Val Fitch and James Cronin observe CP violation by the weak force in the decay of K mesons\n* 1967 Bruno Pontecorvo postulated neutrino oscillation;\n* 1967 Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam publish papers in which they describe Yang–Mills theory using the SU(2) X U(1) supersymmetry group, thereby yielding a mass for the W particle of the weak interaction via spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n* 1967 Steven Weinberg puts forth his electroweak model of leptons\n* 1968 Stanford University: Deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) show that the proton contains much smaller, point-like objects and is therefore not an elementary particle. Physicists at the time are reluctant to identify these objects with quarks, instead calling them partons — a term coined by Richard Feynman. The objects that are observed at SLAC will later be identified as up and down quarks. Nevertheless, \"parton\" remains in use as a collective term for the constituents of hadrons (quarks, antiquarks, and gluons). The existence of the strange quark is indirectly validated by the SLAC's scattering experiments: not only is it a necessary component of Gell-Mann and Zweig's three-quark model, but it provides an explanation for the kaon (K) and pion (π) hadrons discovered in cosmic rays in 1947.\n* 1969 John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony and Richard Holt propose a polarization correlation test of Bell's inequality\n* 1970 Sheldon Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani propose the charm quark\n* 1971 Gerard 't Hooft shows that the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg electroweak model can be renormalized\n* 1972 Stuart Freedman and John Clauser perform the first polarization correlation test of Bell's inequality\n* 1973 Frank Anthony Wilczek discover the quark asymptotic freedom in the theory of strong interactions; receives the Lorentz Medal in 2002, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004 for his discovery and his subsequent contributions to quantum chromodynamics.\n* 1973 Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa note that the experimental observation of CP violation can be explained if an additional pair of quarks exist. The two new quarks are eventually named top and bottom.\n* 1973 David Politzer and Frank Anthony Wilczek propose the asymptotic freedom of quarks\n* 1974 Burton Richter and Samuel Ting: Charm quarks are produced almost simultaneously by two teams in November 1974 (see November Revolution) — one at SLAC under Burton Richter, and one at Brookhaven National Laboratory under Samuel Ting. The charm quarks are observed bound with charm antiquarks in mesons. The two discovering parties independently assign the discovered meson two different symbols, J and ψ; thus, it becomes formally known as the J/ψ meson. The discovery finally convinces the physics community of the quark model's validity.\n* 1974 Robert J. Buenker and Sigrid D. Peyerimhoff introduce the multireference configuration interaction method.\n* 1975 Martin Perl discovers the tau lepton, predicted by Antonino Zichichi in 1967\n* 1977 Leon Lederman observes the bottom quark with his team at Fermilab. This discovery is a strong indicator of the top quark's existence: without the top quark, the bottom quark would be without a partner that is required by the mathematics of the theory. The bottom quark was theorised already in 1973 by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa.\n* 1977 Steve Herb finds the upsilon resonance implying the existence of the beauty/bottom quark\n* 1979 Gluon observed indirectly in three-jet events at DESY;\n* 1982 Alain Aspect, J.

It has a mass much greater than had been previously expected — almost as great as a gold atom.\n* 1995 The D0 and CDF experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron discover the top quark.\n* 1998 – The Super-Kamiokande (Japan) detector facility reports experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations, implying that at least one neutrino has mass.\n* 1998 Super-Kamiokande (Japan) observes evidence for neutrino oscillations, implying that at least one neutrino has mass.\n* 1999 Ahmed Zewail wins the Nobel prize in chemistry for his work on femtochemistry for atoms and molecules.\n* 2000 scientists at  Fermilab announce the first direct evidence for the tau neutrino, the third kind of neutrino in particle physics.\n* 2000 CERN announced quark-gluon plasma, a new phase of matter.\n* 2001 the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (Canada) confirm the existence of neutrino oscillations.
