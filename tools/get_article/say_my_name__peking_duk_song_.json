The song features vocals from Benjamin Joseph. The song is another single from their debut EP, this time the third and final single.\nIt is the first single from the group to be released in the United States and is taken from their first extended play, Songs to Sweat To, to be released on 31 July 2015.\nThe song was written after their appearance at Stereosonic Music Festival in Melbourne in December 2014. The group adds; \"The song was actually written in a matter of 20 minutes. It sounded rough but all the ideas were there, a wrap-up session in Canberra and some tightening up in Los Angeles later and 'Say My Name' was complete.\"\n\"Say My Name\" debuted at number 29 on the Australian ARIA Charts.\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Anthony Chirco and released on 21 September 2015. The clip features Matt McGorry (of Orange Is the New Black and How to Get Away with Murder). The video was the subject of comments from Ariana Grande, who tweeted \"oh................... my god\" and Ruby Rose, who said \"I could watch this all day\".\nReview\nLindsay Herr of Earmilk said, \"While 'Say My Name' is much less electronic influenced than their previous collaboration, it proves a new side of the Peking Duk sound, one that has much more crossover appeal. A little bit of rock, a little bit of pop, and a whole lotta catchy vibes, Peking Duk prove to be force to be reckoned with\".\nTrack listing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
