The song is anti-war, and questions the actions of the pilot.\n* American composer Steve Heitzeg's \"Green Hope After Black Rain (Symphony for the Survivors of Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Manzanar Concentration Camp)\" is a memorial to the victims of the 1945 atomic bombings of the two Japanese cities, and includes percussion elements made from Hiroshima and Nagasaki trees as well as stones from the Manzanar Japanese-American concentration camp.\n* Canadian composer R.

A photo of the Enola Gay plane was doctored to replace the pilot and bombardier with a whale and a dolphin, therefore convincing the Japanese that these two animals are responsible for the devastating bombing. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, however, create a new doctored version of the photo, replacing the dolphin and whale with a cow and a chicken, and they convince the Japanese that the latter two animals were the real culprits of the bombing. Thus, the Japanese redirect their crusade to all the chickens and cows in the world.\nPhotography books\nIn The Photobook: A History, Vol. 1, Martin Parr and Gerry Badger wrote \"These three books, along with Kikuji Kawada's 'symbolic reportage' in Chizu (The Map, 1965), constitute photography's most significant memorials to the defining event in twentieth-century Japanese history.\"\n*Chizu () = The Map (1965) by Kikuji Kawada.\n*Hiroshima () (1958) by Ken Domon.\n*Hiroshima-Nagasaki Document 1961 by Shōmei Tōmatsu and Ken Domon.\n*\"11 ji 02 fun\" Nagasaki (, \"11:02\" Nagasaki) (1966) by Shōmei Tōmatsu.\nReferences"
