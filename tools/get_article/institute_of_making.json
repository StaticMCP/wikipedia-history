Members are encouraged to \"make, break, design and combine both advanced and traditional tools, techniques and materials\".\nIt was founded by directors Mark Miodownik, Zoe Laughlin and Martin Conreen in 2010 at King's College London and moved to UCL in 2012, officially opening on 16 March 2013. The institute has produced some notable projects and research in the fields of making and maker culture and sensoaesthetics.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk The Institute of Making website]"
