It is located in the central part of the region, on the left bank of the Kama river. The administrative center of the district is the urban-type settlement of Alekseevskoe.\nThe district was formed on August 10, 1930. In 1963, it was abolished and its lands transferred to the Chistopolsky District. The district was reestablished as an administrative unit on March 4, 1964.\nGeography\nThe Alekseevsky district encompasses 2074.4&nbsp;km². The district is located in the central part of the Republic of Tatarstan along the Kazan - Orenburg federal highway. The administrative center of the region is the urban-type settlement of Alekseevskoe which is located on the shore of the Kuybyshev Reservoir, 108&nbsp;km south-east of Kazan.\nThe district borders the Chistopolsky, Aksubaevsky, Nurlatsky, Alkeyvsky and Spassky districts of the republic. It shares a water border with Laishevsky and Rybno-Slobodsky districts in Kuybyshev Reservoir.\nCoat of arms and flag\nThe coat of arms and flag of the Alekseevsky district was approved by the Council of the Alekseevsky municipal district on May 10, 2006. The imagery was developed by the Heraldic Council under the President of the Republic of Tatarstan together with the Union of heraldry of Russia. It is based on the regimental coat of arms of the Bilyar Landmilitsky Regiment from 1747.\nA purple elk is depicted in the center of the coat of arms in honor of the city of Bilär, the military-political center of Volga Bulgaria which had been located on the territory of the region since the Middle Ages. Purple symbolizes power and nobility, the elk - freedom and dignity. A broken golden spruce signifies the Zakamskaya zasechnaya line that stood on the lands of the modern region in the 17th century and which included the village of Bilyarsk, founded in 1654 as a fortress.\nHistory\n]]\nChurch in the village of Sakony]]\nThe center of the district is located on the territory of the former village of Alekseevskoye which was founded at the beginning of the 18th century. At the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th centuries, the wool spinning, plaster and furnace industries developed in the village.\nUntil 1920, the territories of the region belonged to the Laishevsky, Spassky and Chistopol districts. Beginning in 1920, cantons replaced districts in the administrative system of the region. The district first appeared as an independent administrative entity of the TASSR on August 10, 1930. In 1963, it was abolished and its territory was transferred to the Chistopol region until the district was reconstituted on March 4, 1964.\nFrom 2005 to 2018, the head of the district was Vladimir Konstantinovich Kozonkov. Subsequently this position would be taken on by Sergey Anatolyevich Demidov. The District Executive Committee is headed by Oleg Gainullin.\nPopulation\nAs of 2020, 24,969 people lived in the district.
