He was sent in March 1822 to the Grey Friars Priory, a private school kept by William Brooke, to whom on 29 September 1828 he was apprenticed for four years. On the expiration of this apprenticeship he worked for a time under his father's supervision, copying armorial bearings and other heraldic devices for Hudson Gurney. He also studied botany, and kept notes, some of which were used by Hewett Cottrell Watson.\nIn January 1834 he went as tutor in J. S. Buck's school at East Dereham, Norfolk, and late in the following year he obtained a post in the banking house of Messrs. Gurney at Great Yarmouth. Through the influence of friends at East Dereham he became attracted to the congregational ministry, and on coming of age left Yarmouth and went to study under William Legge at Fakenham, Norfolk, and Robert Drane at Guestwick. In 1838 he entered as a student at the newly established Highbury College, Middlesex, and graduated B.A. London, 17 June 1841.\nOn 27 April 1843 he was publicly recognised pastor of the independent church of Wortwell-with-Harleston in Norfolk.\nHe soon after began to apply himself to literary work, with the friendship of John Childs, head of the printing firm at Bungay, and acted for a time also as tutor to his grandsons. At the end of 1848 he resigned his pastorate, and, with the view of devoting himself solely to literature, removed to St John's Wood, London, in March 1849. In November 1853 he moved to Bungay to be nearer to his friends the Childs, who were concerned in the production of his larger works, and whom he assisted in many of their undertakings; but in 1858 he returned to the neighbourhood of Hampstead.\nOn 2 July 1860 he was appointed librarian in ordinary to the queen at Windsor Castle. Under the superintendence of the Prince Consort he began the rearrangement of the collection of drawings by the Old Masters at Windsor. He died at his official residence, Royal Mews, Pimlico, on 12 October 1869; he was succeeded as Royal Librarian by Richard Rivington Holmes. Woodward was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1857.\nFamily\nIn 1843 he married Fanny Emma, ninth daughter of Thomas Teulon of Berkeley Street, London, the descendant of a Huguenot family. By her he had three daughters. She died on 30 April 1850, and he married, on 19 August 1851, Emma, seventh daughter of George Barham of Withersdale Hall, Suffolk.\nWorks\nWoodward was author of:\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011591381 The History of Wales], London [1850–3].\n* The Natural History of the Year (originally issued in the ''Teacher's Offering, 1851), London, 1852; 3rd ed. 1863; revised edit.
