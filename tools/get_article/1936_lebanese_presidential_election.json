The Nationalist Émile Eddé defeated the Constitutional Bechara El Khoury. He took office as the third president of Greater Lebanon and the second elected one after Charles Debbas, who was elected in 1926 and 1929.\nThe President is elected by the Members of Parliament. He needs a two-thirds majority to win in the first round, while an absolute majority is enough in the second round.\nAll 25 Members of the Parliament attended the session, including Eddé and El Khoury, and voted in two rounds. Eddé won the first one with 14 votes against 11 for El Khoury. In the second round however, 15 deputies elected Eddé, which was enough for him to become the next President.\nReferences"
