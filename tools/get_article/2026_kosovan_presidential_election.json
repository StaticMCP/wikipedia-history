This will be the sixth presidential election in Kosovo since 2008, when Kosovo declared its independence.\nBackground\nThe incumbent president of Kosovo, Vjosa Osmani, took office on 4 April 2021 and her term is due to end on 4 April 2026.  If Osmani serves out her term in full, the new presidential term will begin in 2026 and will be due to end in 2031.  Osmani would be eligible for re-election for a second and final five-year term in 2026.\nElectoral system\nInitially, a candidate is required to receive at least 80 votes, equivalent to two-thirds of the 120 members of the Assembly, in order to be elected.  However, if no candidate succeeds during the first two rounds, a third round is held between the top two candidates of the second round, and the requirement is reduced to a simple majority of 61 votes.  If the third round also does not produce a successful candidate, the Assembly is dissolved, with new elections to take place within 45 days.\nLeadership approval\nVjosa Osmani\nThe polls below asked voters for their opinion of Vjosa Osmani, president of  Kosovo  since April 2021.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px; margin-bottom:0\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pollster\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Date\n!
