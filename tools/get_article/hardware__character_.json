An original character from DC's Milestone Comics imprint, he first appeared in Hardware #1 (April 1993), and was created by Dwayne McDuffie and Denys Cowan.\nPublication history\nHardware was the first of Milestone's titles to be published, and (along with Blood Syndicate, Icon, and Static) was one of the company's main titles.\nFictional character biography\nMilestone universe\nCurtis Metcalf is a genius inventor who, in his Hardware identity, uses a variety of high-tech gadgets to fight organised crime. A central irony of the series (of which Metcalf is fully aware) is that Metcalf's employer, respected businessman Edwin Alva—who provides the resources Metcalf uses to create his technology—is secretly the crime boss whom Hardware is trying to bring down.\nMetcalf was a working class child prodigy who was discovered aged 12–13 by businessman Edwin Alva, who enrolled him in A Better Chance, \"a program intended to get minority students into elite prep schools\". Metcalf proves to be much smarter than all the other prep school students, graduating at age 14 and earning his first college degree at age 15. Alva pays for Metcalf's college tuition up to six additional college degrees in exchange for Metcalf being allowed to work in Alva's laboratory. Metcalf's inventions made Alva many millions of dollars.\nAfter several years of working for Alva, Metcalf attempts to request royalties for his inventions, but Alva rejects him, stating that he is no longer of use to him. Metcalf intends to quit working for Alva, but his contract forbids him from working for any competitors. After learning that Alva is deeply corrupt and has ties to organized crime, Metcalf intends to publicly expose him. However, he realizes that the government will not act on this information and decides to become the superhero Hardware to bring down Alva himself.\nDC Universe\nFollowing the death of Darkseid in Final Crisis, the space-time continuum is damaged, threatening the existence of the DC and Dakota universes. Dharma uses energy harnessed from the entity Rift to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon, and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants ever existed in a parallel universe.\nIn the revised continuity, Hardware and the other Milestone characters have always existed in the DC Universe. The first non-Dakota heroes he encounters are the Justice League of America, whom he meets while aiding the Shadow Cabinet in kidnapping Kimiyo Hoshi and stealing the remains of Arthur Light. After attempting to flee the Justice League Satellite with Light's corpse, Hardware is surprised and beaten into unconsciousness by Hawkman. It is later revealed that, during Hoshi's brief period of captivity, Hardware gave her a new costume which can collect and assimilate light energy.\nSoon after, Hardware teams up with Blue Beetle to stop SYSTEM smugglers from selling stolen Alva Industries technology to Intergang. The pair of heroes are ambushed by a smuggler wearing advanced armor designed by Gizmo, an ally of SYSTEM. Despite his initial dislike of Blue Beetle, Hardware parts with him on friendly terms after rounding up the smugglers.\nHardware later appears in the aftermath of the JLA's dissolution following \"Final Crisis\". After raiding the hideout of Holocaust, he is forced into helping the remaining Justice League members track down Doctor Light, who went missing while chasing Shadow Thief and Starbreaker. Using a tracer installed in Light's costume, Hardware tracks her to the Shadow Cabinet's headquarters, where he and the League and defeat Starbreaker.\nFollowing the events of Flashpoint, Hardware becomes a mentor to Static, who has moved to New York City. He provides the youth with a modified flying disk and a new costume which possesses a holographic interface that allows them to communicate over vast distances. He also gets Static a job as an intern at the New York branch of S.T.A.R. Labs.\nSupporting characters\n]]\n]]\n* Barraki Young is Curtis' girlfriend.\n* Don \"Jolly Jock\" Cornelius is a mob leader. After faking Hardware's death, Harm is left in control of Cornelius' mob sector in Dakota.\n* Deacon \"Phreaky Deak\" Stuart is a hardcore computer hacker and friend of Hareware.\n* Deathwish (Wilton Johnson) is a psychotic vigilante obsessed with sex-related crimes. He was the victim of a brutal family raping of which only he survived.

He has created breakthroughs in metallurgy, computer science, nanotechnology, and plasma weapons. Metcalf is also a good hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by his father in the martial arts.\nEquipment\nHardware version 2.0 armor\nAll of Curtis Metcalf's superhuman abilities derive from his armor. It consists of a self-designed metal alloy, is resistant to bullets and energy, increases Hardware's strength via flexible polymers, and can fly via jet boots. Furthermore, the armor's helmet includes a spectral scanning unit, a radio receiver, radar, a chemical analyzer, a digital video player/recorder, a translator, and a voice modulator.\nAdditional equipment\nCurtis has designed various pieces of equipment to enhance the capabilities of his Hardware armor. Many of them are hand-held and can be easily carried on his belt. Larger pieces of equipment are mounted on Hardware's helmet, gauntlets and shoulder pads.\n* The Quick Pick is a lock-picking tool that can create keys of any shape to pick locks.\n* The Sonic Drill is a shoulder-mounted device that creates stunning sonic pulses.\n* The Inertia Winder is a device that can absorb and store kinetic energy.\nOther equipment Hardware has used include a forearm-mounted welding tool, tracking devices, a handheld scanning device, a laser cutting tool, a flare gun, wrist-mounted flashlights, and a portable electromagnet.\nWeapons\n* Omnicannon: A forearm-mounted cannon that fires blasts of compressed air and has various effects depending on the shell equipped.\n* Plasma Whip: A magnetic whip that can extend up to 15 feet long and generate plasma.\n* Retractable Sword: A sword that can retract and extend up to 30 inches by manipulating its magnetic charge.\n* PLASER: A device that generates vaporizing plasma blasts.\n* Energy Field: A forearm-mounted device that generates energy barriers.\n* Fluid Gun: A gun that generates immobilizing fluids.\n* Flow Gun: A handgun made of nanomachines that resemble mercury and can assemble at will.\n* Holographic Projection System: This device projects holographic copies of Hardware that he can use to distract or confuse opponents.\nOther weapons Hardware uses less frequently include tasers, timed explosives, tranquilizer dart launchers, a flamethrower, a remote-controlled jet thruster, a rocket pistol, a kusarigama, a machine gun that fires explosive bullets, a remotely-controlled Hardware robot, a power shield that blocks energy-draining weaponry, and a field of paralyzing supercool atoms.\nTransportation\n* Skylark: A modified Moller M400 Skycar that can fly at speeds above 400 mph, receive television and radio signals, and become invisible.\n* Jet-Pack: A personal short-range propulsion rig with turbine thrusters that gather surrounding air, then expel it in a continuous stream.\nAfrofuturism\nHardware can be included in the discourse of Afrofuturism based on its adherence to Mark Dery's definition of \"speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th century technoculture—and, more generally, African-American signification that appropriates images of technology and a prosthetically enhanced future\".\nCurtis Metcalf re-purposes technology as a force of liberation, fighting against the evil Edwin Alva. As Hardware, he uses his superhuman understanding and fluency with technology as a form of agency. Hardware's status as a superhero, through the manipulation of technology, is a means of transcending the digital divide.\nIn other media\n* Hardware makes a cameo appearance in Superman & Batman Magazine #7.\n* Hardware makes non-speaking appearances in Young Justice. This version is a member of the Justice League.\nReferences"
