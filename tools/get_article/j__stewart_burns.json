Stewart Burns or simply just Stewart Burns is a television writer and producer most notable for his work on The Simpsons, Futurama, and Unhappily Ever After.\nEducation\nBurns attended Harvard University, where he wrote for the Harvard Lampoon.\nNoted in the DVD commentaries of \"The Deep South\" and \"Roswell That Ends Well\", Burns has an M.A. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied under John Rhodes. Burns is partly credited for The Simpsons' inclusion of a number of complex mathematical concepts and jokes within the series.\nBurns was famously referenced in a 1993 Newsweek article about his decision to jump from pursuing a graduate degree in mathematics to writing comedy: \"You could read the entire story of American decline in that one career move.\"\nCareer\nBurns got his start by writing for Beavis and Butthead. Since then, he has written for The Simpsons, Futurama, and Unhappily Ever After.\nAside from writing on the original series, Burns also wrote the script for the Futurama video game as well as one of the Spyro games, ''Spyro: A Hero's Tail. Burns developed and has served as the game runner of The Simpsons: Tapped Out since its inception.\nAwards\nBurns has won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animation Program four times — for Futurama in 2002, and for The Simpsons in 2006, 2008 and 2019.\nWriting credits\nFuturama episodes\n*\"My Three Suns\" (1999)\n*\"Mars University\" (1999)\n*\"A Head in the Polls\" (1999)\n*\"The Deep South\" (2000)\n*\"The Cryonic Woman\" (2000)\n*\"Roswell That Ends Well\" (2001)\n*\"Where the Buggalo Roam\" (2002)\n*\"Neutopia\" (2011)\nThe Simpsons'' episodes\n*\"Moe Baby Blues\" (2003)\n*\"The Way We Weren't\" (2004)\n*\"There's Something About Marrying\" (2005)\n*\"The Monkey Suit\" (2006)\n*\"Homerazzi\" (2007)\n*\"Marge Gamer\" (2007)\n*\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\" (2007)\n*\"Waverly Hills 9-0-2-1-D'oh\" (2009)\n*\"Holidays of Future Passed\" (2011)\n*\"The D'oh-cial Network\" (2012)\n*\"What Animated Women Want\" (2013)\n*\"Steal This Episode\" (2014)\n*\"Days of Future Future\" (2014)\n*\"Simpsorama\" (2014)\n*\"Every Man's Dream\" (2015)\n*\"Puffless\" (2015)\n*\"Fland Canyon\" (2016)\n*\"Friends and Family\" (2016)\n*\"Dogtown\" (2017)\n*\"Flanders' Ladder\" (2018)\n*\"Treehouse of Horror XXX\" (2019)\n*\"The Miseducation of Lisa Simpson\" (2020)\n*\"Screenless\" (2020)\n*\"Mother and Child Reunion\" (2021)\n*\"Write Off This Episode\" (2023)\n*\"The Tipping Point\" (2024)\n*\"The Last Man Expanding\" (2025)\n*\"Yellow Planet\" (2025)\nSupervising producer credits\nThe Simpsons episodes\n* \"The Great Louse Detective\" (2002)\n* \"Special Edna\" (2003)\n* \"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\" (2003)\n* \"The Strong Arms of the Ma\" (2003)\n* \"Pray Anything\" (2003)\n* \"Barting Over\" (2003)\n* \"I'm Spelling As Fast As I Can\" (2003)\n* \"A Star Is Born Again\" (2003)\n* \"Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington\" (2003)\n* \"C.E.
