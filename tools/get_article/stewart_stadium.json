Originally Wildcat Stadium, it was renamed in 1998 for Stewart (1905–1996), a notable campus and community benefactor.\nUsed primarily for football, the 17,312-seat venue is the home of the Weber State Wildcats of the Big Sky Conference. It was expanded in 1966 with the construction of the primary grandstand along the northwest sideline, nearly doubling its capacity. The elevation of its synthetic turf playing field is  above sea level; aligned northeast to southwest, the field was natural grass until 2011.\nStewart Stadium is also the home venue for Weber State's outdoor track and field teams.\nSee also\n* List of NCAA Division I FCS football stadiums\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://static.weberstatesports.com/custompages/Facilities/stewart-stadium.html Weber State University Athletics] – Stewart Stadium"
