The film tells the story  of the military coup in 1980, which led to his decision to become a missionary to America for the last 35 years.\nBob Hager was the producer/Director of the documentary under auspices of Tiny Seed Films.\nLife and career\nBorn on 30 April 1935 in Careysburg District, Montserrado County, Warner was later adopted by Vivienne Newton Gray and Ulysses Samuel Gray Sr.\nHe was a bishop in the United Methodist Church for four years before he was plucked from relative obscurity to become Vice President in 1977, succeeding James Edward Greene. Warner was attending a conference of Methodist bishops in Nashville, Indiana when a military coup led by Samuel Doe overthrew the Liberian government on 12 April 1980. Warner attempted to form a government in exile in Ivory Coast to challenge the coup makers.  A month after he was evicted from political power, he was removed from ecclesiastical power: Methodist minister D. Sieh Doe proclaimed the bishopric vacant, and for six months the seat was empty and the church run by Warner's administrative assistant.
