In 2008 and 2009, the category was called \"Outstanding Special Class Short-Format Animated Program\", and was an \"area\" award which could have one, more than one, or no, winners; starting in 2010, the name was changed, and it was made a \"category\" award which (unless there is a tie) must have one winner. Note that a show whose episodes mainly consist of multiple stories, each 15 minutes or shorter, can either enter one story in this category, or a full episode in the Outstanding Animated Program category.\nBeginning in 2024, the category will be consolidated with Outstanding Animated Program.\nWinners and nominations\n2000s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"13%\" | Program\n! width=\"12%\" | Episode\n! width=\"65%\" | Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n|-\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2008(60th)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Camp Lazlo\n| '''\"Lazlo's First Crush\"'''\n| Joe Murray and Brian A.
