He is the younger brother of Edwin F. Harding.\nJudges' trial\nFollowing indictments on sixteen different Nazi jurors and lawyers, Harding was selected as an alternate judge during the trials. The indictments were formally presented on January 4, 1947. On June 19, 1947 Carrington T. Marshall, the presiding judge, retired due to illness. Judge Harding then became a full member of the tribunal when Judge James T. Brand was appointed to fill Judge Marshall's position. The trials officially concluded on December 4, 1947.
