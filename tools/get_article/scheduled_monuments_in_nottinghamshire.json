Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. There are about 20,000 Scheduled Monument entries on the list, which is maintained by English Heritage; more than one site can be included in a single entry.\nWhile a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, English Heritage considers listed building status as a better way of protecting buildings than scheduled monument status. If a monument is considered by English Heritage to \"no longer merit scheduling\" it can be descheduled.\nNottinghamshire has over 160 scheduled monuments including various Roman, medieval and Civil War sites, buildings and ruins.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Image\n!Name\n!Feature\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|All Saints Church and graveyard\n|Church\n|Annesley, Ashfield\n|Remains of medieval C13th church and graveyard.
