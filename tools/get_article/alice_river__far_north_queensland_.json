It flows westward down the valleys and across Aerodrome Plain where they turn south west forming braided channels. The river then turns northwest and continues forming the northern border of Mitchell-Alice Rivers National Park before discharging into Mitchell River. From source to mouth, the river is joined by twelve tributaries and descends  over its  course.\nThe catchment area of the river occupies , part of the much larger Mitchell River catchment that has a total area of .\nVegetation across the catchment area is speargrass savannah dominated by stringybark, bloodwoods and Moreton Bay ash. Along the river banks and tributaries there are open stands of paperbarks and dense riparian rainforest. The season swamps and lagoons have Melaleucas and freshwater mangrove with water lilies in standing water.\nThe river was named  by Frank Johnston, the manager of Koolata cattle station, after his wife Alice.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences"
