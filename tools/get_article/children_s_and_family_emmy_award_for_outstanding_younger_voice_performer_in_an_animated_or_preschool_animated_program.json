The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022, and is open to lead, supporting and guest performers of all genders who are under the age of 18. The category is a counterpart to the Preschool and Children's or Young Teen categories honoring performers in animated series, and is one of two awards specifically designed to award younger actors, alongside the Younger Performer category.\nThe current holder of the award is Jacob Tremblay, who won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards for his role as Orion in the Netflix streaming film Orion and the Dark.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. From 1995 to 2021, voice performers were honored with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program however, this category was discontinued following the announcement of the Children's and Family Emmys.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"85%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!
