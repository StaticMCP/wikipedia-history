The Confederates were attempting to retake ground they had lost to Federal forces during battles near Richmond, Virginia. Their efforts failed.\nOn October 13, Union forces advanced to find and feel the new Confederate defensive line in front of Richmond.  While mostly a battle of skirmishers, a Federal brigade assaulted fortifications north of Darbytown Road and was repulsed with heavy casualties. The Federals retired to their entrenched lines along New Market Road.\nBackground\nOpposing forces\nUnion\nThe Union order of battle is compiled from the official tabulation of casualties and includes only units which sustained casualties.\nMilitary rank abbreviations used\n* MG = Major General\n* BG = Brigadier General\n* Col = Colonel\n* Ltc = Lieutenant Colonel\n* Maj = Major\n* Cpt = Captain\nOther abbreviations\n* w = wounded\n* mw = mortally wounded\n* k = killed\n* c = captured\nArmy of the James\nX Corps\nMG Alfred H.
