He was awarded the 2003 Sahitya Akademi Award for his Hindi novel Kitne Pakistan (translated in English as Partitions), and the Padma Bhushan in 2005.\nHe is considered a part of the league of Hindi writers like Mohan Rakesh, Nirmal Verma, Rajendra Yadav and Bhisham Sahni, who left the old pre-independence literary preoccupations and presented the new sensibilities that reflected new moorings of a post-independence India, thus launching the Hindi literature's Nayi Kahani (\"New Story\") movement in the 1950s.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nKamleshwar Prasad Saxena was born in the Mainpuri district of Uttar Pradesh, India, where he spent his early years.
