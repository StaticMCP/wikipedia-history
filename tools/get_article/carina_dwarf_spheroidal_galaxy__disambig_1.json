It was discovered in 1977 with the UK Schmidt Telescope by Cannon et al. The Carina Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and is receding from it at 230&nbsp;km/s. The diameter of the galaxy is about 1600 light-years, which is 75 times smaller than the Milky Way. Most of the stars in the galaxy formed 7 billion years ago, although it also experienced bursts of star formation about 13 and 3 billion years ago. It is also being tidally disrupted by the Milky Way galaxy. -->\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://spider.seds.org/spider/LG/car_dw.html Carina Dwarf] at SEDS\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061011041911/http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v28n2/aas188/abs/S077005.html Observations of Tidal Disruption of the Carina Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy]\n*"
