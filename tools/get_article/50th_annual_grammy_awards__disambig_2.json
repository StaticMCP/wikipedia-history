It honored musical achievement of 2007 in which albums were released between October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007. The primary ceremonies were televised in the US on CBS; however, as has become the custom, most of the awards were handed out during a pre-telecast portion of the show held at the Los Angeles Convention Center and broadcast on XM Satellite Radio. Two nights prior to the show Aretha Franklin was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year.\nThe year's big winner was Amy Winehouse: the 24-year-old singer had recently entered a drug rehabilitation program and did not come to Los Angeles. American officials initially refused her a work visa; they reversed the decision, but by then it was too late for her to make the trip from the UK.  She became the fifth female solo artist to get five awards in one night, alongside Lauryn Hill, Norah Jones, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé and later, Alison Krauss, Adele and Billie Eilish. The nominees were announced by Taylor Hawkins and Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, George Lopez, Vince Gill, Herbie Hancock, Jimmy Jam, Fergie, Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, and Akon.\nThe golden anniversary of the Grammys and NARAS was noted in references and performances throughout this year's ceremony. Alicia Keys was the evening's opening musician, singing and playing piano alongside archived video and audio of Frank Sinatra. Other collaborative performances linking contemporary and past musicians included Beyoncé with Tina Turner, Rihanna with The Time, classical pianist Lang Lang with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and inaugural Grammy winner Keely Smith with Kid Rock. Special recognition of the musical contributions of The Beatles also featured.  The Foo Fighters won Best Rock Album and performed their nominated song \"The Pretender\" in a highly collaborative performance that involved a social media selection of classical musicians (the \"My Grammy Moment\" YouTube contest was won by violinist Ann Marie Calhoun).\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Performer(s)\n!Song(s) Performed\n|-\n|Alicia KeysFrank Sinatra\n|\"Learnin' the Blues\"\n|-\n|Carrie Underwood\n|\"Before He Cheats\"\n|-\n|The TimeRihanna\n|\"Jungle Love\"\"Umbrella\"\"Don't Stop the Music\"\n|-\n|The cast of Cirque du Soleil – Love\n|\"A Day in the Life\"\n|-\n|The cast of Across the Universe\n|\"Let It Be\"\n|-\n|Kanye WestDaft Punk\n|\"Stronger\"\"Hey Mama\"\n|-\n|FergieJohn Legend\n|\"Finally\"\n|-\n|BeyoncéTina Turner\n|\"What's Love Got to Do with It\"\"Better Be Good to Me\"\"Proud Mary\"\n|-\n|Foo FightersJohn Paul JonesAnn Marie Calhoun\n|\"The Pretender\"\n|-\n|Brad Paisley\n|\"Ticks\"\n|-\n|Aretha FranklinBeBe WinansThe Madison BumblebeesThe Clark SistersTrin-i-tee 5:7Israel and New Breed\n|\"Never Gonna Break My Faith\"\"You Brought the Sunshine\"\"With Long Life\"\"Old Landmark\"\n|-\n|Feist\n|\"1234\"\n|-\n|Keely SmithDave KozKid Rock\n|\"That Old Black Magic\"\n|-\n|Alicia KeysJohn Mayer\n|\"No One\n|-\n|Lang LangHerbie Hancock\n|\"Rhapsody in Blue\"\n|-\n|Amy Winehouse\n|\"You Know I'm No Good\"\"Rehab\"\n|-\n|Eldar\n|\"Jazz Piano Composition\"\n|-\n|Andrea BocelliJosh Groban\n|Tribute to Luciano Pavarotti \"The Prayer\"\n|-\n|Little RichardJerry Lee LewisJohn Fogerty\n|\"Comin' Down The Road\"\"Great Balls of Fire\"\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\"\n|-\n|will.i.am\n|\"Grammy Awards 50th Anniversary Freestyle Rap\"\n|}\nPresenters\nThe following is a list of presenters:\n*Prince - presented Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.\n*Tom Hanks - paid tribute to The Band as a Lifetime Achievement Award recipient and introduced Cirque du Soleil and Julie Taymor\n*Cyndi Lauper and Miley Cyrus - presented Best New Artist.\n*Jason Bateman - Introduces a contest winner to perform with the Foo Fighters in the My Grammy contest.\n*John Legend and Fergie - Presents the award for Best Soundtrack.\n*Cher - Introduces a performance by Beyonce.\n*Nelly Furtado, Andy Williams, and Roselyn Sanchez - Pay tribute to Burt Bacharach as the Lifetime Achievement recipient and present the award for Song of the Year.\n*George Lopez - Introduces a performance by Brad Paisley.\n*Chris Brown, Akon, and Solange Knowles - Introduce the award for Best Rap Album.\n*Ludacris - Pays tribute to Cab Calloway as Lifetime Achievement Recipient and introduces a gospel performance by Aretha Franklin, Bebe Winans, Madison Bumblebees, The Clark Sisters, Trin-i-Tee 5:7, and Israel & New Breed.\n*Carole King and Dierks Bentley - Pay tribute to Earl Scruggs as a Lifetime Achievement recipient and introduces a performance by Feist.\n*Keely Smith and Kid Rock - Presents the award for Best Rock Album.\n*Stevie Wonder - Pays tribute to Berry Gordy and introduces a performance by Alicia Keys.\n*Ringo Starr and Dave Stewart (Eurythmics) - Presents the award for Best Country Album.\n*Joe Mantegna - Pays tribute to Itzhak Perlman and Max Roach as Lifetime Achievement recipients and introduces a performance by Herbie Hancock and Lang Lang.\n*Taylor Swift and Juanes - Presents the award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\n*Cuba Gooding Jr. - Introduces a performance by Amy Winehouse.\n*Natalie Cole and Tony Bennett - Pays tribute to Doris Day and presents the award for Record of the Year.\n*Neil Portnow - Makes his annual speech and pays tribute to the 2008 WGA strike and Oscar Peterson, introduces a performance by Eldar, and presents the In Memoriam segment.\n*Andrea Boccelli and Josh Groban - Pays tribute to Luciano Pavarotti.\n*Usher & Quincy Jones - Album of the Year\n*Bonnie Raitt - Introduces a performance by Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and John Fogerty.\nWinners and nominees\nBold type indicates the winner out of the list of nominees.\nMultiple nominees and wins (wins/nominations)\n* Amy Winehouse (5/6)\n* Kanye West (4/8)\n* Foo Fighters (2/5)\n* Justin Timberlake (2/3)\n* Herbie Hancock (2/3)\n* Rihanna (1/6)\nGeneral\n;Record of the Year\n*\"Rehab\" – Amy Winehouse\n**Mark Ronson, producer; Tom Elmhirst, Mark Ronson, Dom Morley, Vaughan Merrick & Gabriel Roth, engineers/mixers\n*\"Irreplaceable\" – Beyoncé\n**Beyoncé Knowles, Ne-Yo & Stargate, producers; Jim Caruana, Jason Goldstein & Geoff Rice, engineers/mixers\n*\"The Pretender\" – Foo Fighters\n**Gil Norton, producer; Adrian Bushby & Rich Costey, engineers/mixers\n*\"Umbrella\" – Rihanna featuring Jay-Z\n**Kuk Harrell & C. \"Tricky\" Stewart, producers; Kuk Harrell & Manny Marroquin, engineers/mixers\n*\"What Goes Around...
