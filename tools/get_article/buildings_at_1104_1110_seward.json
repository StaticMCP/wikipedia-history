Both buildings are four-unit apartments built in 1927. Architects Van Gunten & Van Gunten designed the buildings in the Tudor Revival style. The buildings' designs are meant to resemble large homes, an unusual form not seen in any of Evanston's other residential apartments. Each design features a brick exterior, a Tudor arched stone entrance, a two-story bay window, and a gable roof.\nThe buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1986.\nReferences"
