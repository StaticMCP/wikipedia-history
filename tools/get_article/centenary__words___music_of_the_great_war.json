The unique project is a double album by English folk duo Show of Hands; the first disc features war poems recited by Jim Carter and Imelda Staunton set to the duo's music, whilst the second disc features songs inspired by the War, sung instead by Show of Hands' lead singer Steve Knightley.\nThe album was released on 30 June 2014 on Ian Brown's label Mighty Village, through Universal Music, becoming Show of Hands' first album since 1995 not to be released on their own label Hands on Music. The album contains the single \"Lads in their Hundreds\", released as a single 14 July 2014.[http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a568012/jim-carter-imelda-staunton-to-release-wwi-centenary-album/ Jim Carter, Imelda Staunton to release WWI centenary album] Although not strictly a compilation, the album reached number 13 in the UK Compilation Chart, and became perhaps the duo's best known album.\nBackground and development\nOutbreak of World War I and war poetry\nThe July Crisis had culminated in Austria-Hungary declaring war on the Kingdom of Serbia on 28 July 1914. Over the following days and weeks, this and the invasion of Luxembourg and Belgium by the German Empire, led to a succession of other declarations of war that drew the major European powers into a worldwide conflict, the Great War, later to become known as World War I. In the 2010s, leading up to the centenary of the outbreak in 2014, governments in Europe began preparing for a series of official commemorative events to mark the occasion. Other than official memorials, narrative films and music was being created to mark the event.\nDuring World War I, there was a great wave of British war poets, poets who participate in a war and writes about their experiences. The term \"war poet\" is generally applied especially to those who served during World War I.\nCentenary\n(pictured in 2013) was asked by Knightley to read the poems on the album with his wife Imelda Staunton.]]\nIn 2013, Ian Brown, manager of the sea shanty folk group Fisherman's Friends, created plans to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak with a studio album, which would be released on his record label Mighty Village, via major label Universal Music. He asked the Devon-based folk duo Show of Hands (Steve Knightley and Phil Beer) if they would be interested in a major recording project to commemorate the event, and the duo accepted, and began work at Christmas 2013. The duo had recently released their sixteenth studio album Wake the Union (2012) to critical acclaim and toured in promotion of the album throughout 2013.\nThe duo had decided to create a double album, with two stylistically different discs. The first disc would contain war poems written during World War I, whilst the second disc would comprise songs.[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-steve-knightley-jim-carter-jim-has-this-chaotic-clown-alter-ego-a-bad-tempered-drunkard-9563358.html How We Met: Steve Knightley & Jim Carter: 'Jim has this chaotic clown alter ego - a bad-tempered drunkard' | The Independent] Knightley chose not to recite the poems on the first disc himself and instead opted for his old friend, actor Jim Carter and his wife Imelda Staunton.\nKnightley and Carter had known each other since around 1980; the two lived in the same flat building in Maida Vale, London, where the two would regularly visit The Warwick Castle pub together. When Knightley moved back from London to his native West Country, the two did not see each other for about five or six years, until Knightley held a benefit concert in Dorset, and invited Carter and his wife Staunton. Carter performed as a magician whilst Staunton sang soul classics. Knightley noted she had an \"amazing voice\". Knightley and the couple did not cross paths for a great number of years. Show of Hands, and therefore Knightley, had become more popular over the years, whilst Carter's role as an actor became highly prolific, with his best known role being Mr Carson in the ITV drama Downton Abbey (2010−present), whilst Staunton reached similar heights as an actress, well known for her award-winning titular performance in Vera Drake.\nAfter beginning work on Centenary, Knightley approached Carter and Staunton and asked if they could recite poems for the album, and the couple agreed. Carter recalled that he and Knightley had been \"out of touch for a few years when, out of the blue, he got in touch [in 2013]: he'd had an idea for the centenary of the First World War, setting poetry to music−and he asked me to read the poems\". Carter and Show of Hands had previously collaborated when Carter read \"The Wrecker’s Prayer\" at the start of Show of Hands' 1990 opus \"Tall Ships\", from the album of the same name.\nRecording\nThe album was produced and arranged by Knightley with Show of Hands' regular producer Mark Tucker, who recorded and mixed the album at The Green Room, Devon. Jonathan Allen engineer the album with assistance from Matt Jones.[https://mainlynorfolk.info/folk/records/showofhands.html Show of Hands] Carter and Staunton recorded the poetry at Abbey Road Studios, London. The recordings were then sent to Show of Hands and Tucker in Devon who then spent \"three months or so trying to find settings, just themes, just atmospheres, from all of those classic songs\". Knightley said that it was a \"labour of love\", because \"sometimes there's a mismatch, and sometimes you record a version of one of those songs and you can't find the poetry to go with, and then occasionally, everything just locks together, and you have this wonderful moment in the studio where people are reduced to tears or of joy and laughter.\" He further commented that when moments like that happen, \"you just have this great moment where you feel very privileged to be part of something\".\nThe duo were also asked \"wherever possible\" to use instruments such as a tenor guitar and an octave mandolin, due to them being current in World War I. Knightley said that, for example, they \"could take 'I Vow to Thee, My Country' played on the solo instrument rather than by an orchestra\" and \"it would become a bit more plaintive\", and that the poem that \"just locked together\" with it \"straight away\" was Carter's reading of \"The Soldier\". Knightley commented that recording the album was a \"fascinating three months work\".\nContent\n's \"Anthems for Doomed Youth\" (lyrics pictured) opens the album.]]\nThe album marks the second time that Show of Hands and Carter had collaborated, as Carter had recited \"The Wrecker’s Prayer\" at the start of their 1990 opus \"Tall Ships\", from the album of the same name. Carter also commented that despite being married to Imelda for three decades, they have had few occasions to collaborate and this album was \"a very rare opportunity for us to work together\".[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/carter-records-war-poetry-album-30231764.html Carter records war poetry album - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk] Knightley said Carter \"has such distinctive tones with rich overtones that he's brought an incredible sense of Englishness to the album, and−it has to be said−the resonance of Downton and that period.\"\nThe first disc, Music and Poetry, features twenty-two of the original war poems set to musical tunes that were well known at the time and played on instruments familiar to those who fought in the war, such as acoustic guitar, concertina, octave-mandolin, harmonica, fiddle, melodeon, piano and double bass. The poems are read by Carter and Staunton, whilst the music is performed by Show of Hands. The selection of poems includes Wilfred Owen's \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" and \"Dulce et Decorum est\", along with works by Siegfried Sassoon and \"I Have a Rendezvous with Death, written by Alan Seeger, the uncle of the late folk star Peter Seeger. There are also works by female poets, such as AE Housman's \"The Lads in their Hundreds\", which dates back to the end of the 19th century and that was reappropiated during World War I. \"When This Bloody War is Over\" was originally recorded by Beer as part of a medley with traditional piece \"Flowers of the Forest\" for his solo album Rhythm Methodist (2005). Beer had learnt the song many years prior in a Methodist chapel.\nThe second disc, Songs Inspired by the Great War, is dominated by songs instead of poetry, with Show of Hands presenting distinctive versions of World War I favourites as well as newer material and songs composed especially for the project inspired by the war. Unlike the first disc, Show of Hands were given a free rein, and on occasion, they took music from the first disc and extended it. Knightley created \"Requiem\" and his own setting of Housman's \"The Lads in their Hundreds\", while the duo's occasional collaborator and fellow Topsham songwriter Chris Hoban composed \"The Padre\" and \"Love Will Make the World Go Round\" specially for the project. Previous collaborators Jackie Oates and Jim Causley appear on a medley of \"Goodbye-ee\" and \"If You Were the Only Girl in the World\" whilst \"The Sunshine of Your Smile\" features Miranda and Rex Preston. Knightley's composition \"The Keeper\" ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gkAlLdZ4Hs \"The Gamekeeper\"]), played with a mandolin, was re-arranged by Chris Hoban to overlap with the traditional songs \"The Keeper\" and \"The Water is Wide\" and features Phil Henry and Hannah Martin. The disc also contains a \"beatbox harmonica treatment\" of \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\".[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/25/show-of-hands-centenary-great-war-review Show of Hands: Centenary – Words & Music of the Great War review | Music | The Guardian] \"The Blue Cockade\" features the Urban Soul Orchestra, who had accompanied Show of Hands on tour the previous year.\nRelease and reception\n[http://www.aaamusic.co.uk/2014/08/14/show-of-hands-centenary/ SHOW OF HANDS – Centenary | AAA Music]\n| rev2      = The Financial Times\n| rev2Score = [https://www.ft.com/content/6938f934-fa73-11e3-a328-00144feab7de Various Artists: Centenary: Words & Music Of The Great War – review]\n| rev4      = The Guardian\n| rev4Score =\n| rev3      = Folk Radio\n| rev3Score = favourable[http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2014/08/the-making-of-centenary-words-and-music-of-the-great-war-show-of-hands/ The making of 'Centenary: Words and Music of the Great War - Show of Hands' | FRUK]\n| rev5      = The Living Tradition\n| rev5Score = favourable[http://www.livingtradition.co.uk/webrevs/3784840.htm Living Tradition CD review of SHOW OF HANDS - Centenary: Words And Music Of The Great War]\n| rev6      = Press Party\n| rev6Score = favourable[http://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/republic_media/view/108146/ ‘Centenary: Words & Music Of The Great War’ Music Played By Show Of Hands, Poetry Read By Jim Carter And Imelda Staunton: Pressparty]\n| rev7      = Spiral Earth\n| rev7Score = favourable\n| rev8      = The Daily Telegraph\n| rev8Score = [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/11048085/Folk-music-treats-for-summer-2014.html Folk music treats for summer 2014 - Telegraph]\n}}\nCentenary was released on 30 June 2010 by Brown's record label Mighty Village via Universal Music, becoming Show of Hands' first album since 1995 not to be released by their own record label Hands on Music.

It contains inspired, powerful and extraordinary war poetry and remarkable new music which reflects the emotions of the time.\" Johnny Whalley of Folk Radio said the album \"stimulates such a variety of emotions and fittingly commemorates without glorifying a wasted generation.\" Kevin T. Ward of The Living Tradition said the album was \"creatively crafted with immense skill and sensitivity, rich in range and mood, this is a memorable piece of work of enduring experiential, emotional and educational value.\" Iain Hazlewood of Spiral Earth said \"a hundred years is no time at all, Carter and Staunton make it real and immediate, whilst Show of Hands make it heartfelt.\" Shire Folk later ranked the album at number 1 on their list of the \"Top 10 Albums of 2014\".
