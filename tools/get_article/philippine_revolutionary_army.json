Rules and regulations were laid down for the reorganization of the army, along with the regulation of ranks and the adoption of new fighting methods, new rank insignias, and a new standard uniform known as the rayadillo. Filipino artist Juan Luna is credited with this design. Juan Luna also designed the collar insignia for the uniforms, distinguishing between the services: infantry, cavalry, artillery, sappers, and medics. His brother, General Antonio Luna commissioned him with the task and personally paid for the new uniforms. At least one researcher has postulated that Juan Luna may have patterned the tunic after the English Norfolk jacket, since the Filipino version is not a copy of any Spanish-pattern uniform. Infantry officers wore blue pants with two white stripes down the side, while Cavalry officers wore red trousers with two black stripes. Soldiers and junior officers wore straw hats while senior officers often wore peaked caps.\nOrders and circulars were issued covering matters such as building trenches and fortifications, equipping every male aged 15 to 50 with bows and arrows (as well as bolo knives, though officers wielded European swords), enticing Filipino soldiers in the Spanish army to defect, collecting empty cartridges for refilling, prohibiting unplanned sorties, inventories of captured arms and ammunition, fundraising, purchasing of arms and supplies abroad, unification of military commands, and exhorting the rich to give aid to the soldiers.\nAguinaldo, a month after he declared Philippine independence, created a pay scale for officers in the army: Following the board, a brigadier general would receive 600 pesos annually, and a sergeant 72 pesos.\nWhen the Philippine–American War erupted on February 4, 1899, the Filipino army suffered heavy losses on every sector. Even Antonio Luna urged Apolinario Mabini, Aguinaldo's chief adviser, to convince the President that guerrilla warfare must be announced as early as April 1899. Aguinaldo adopted guerrilla tactics on November 13, 1899, dissolving what remained of the regular army and after many of his crack units were decimated in set-piece battles.\nWeaponry\nThe Filipinos were short on modern weapons. Most of its weapons were captured from the Spanish, were improvised or were traditional weapons. The service rifles of the nascent army were the Spanish M93 and the Spanish Remington Rolling Block rifle. Moreover, while in Hong Kong, Emilio Aguinaldo purchased rifles from the Americans. Two batches of 2,000 rifles each including ammunition were ordered and paid for. The first batch arrived while the second batch never did. In his letters to Galicano Apacible, Mariano Ponce also sought weapons from both domestic and international dealers in the Empire of Japan. He was offered different breech-loading single-shot rifles since most nations were discarding them in favor of new smokeless bolt-action rifles. However, there was no mention of any purchase occurring. Another planned purchase was the Murata rifle from Japan but no record exists that it made its way into the hands of Filipino revolutionaries.\nCrew-served weapons of the Philippine military included lantaka, Krupp guns, Hontoria guns, Ordóñez guns, Hotchkiss guns, Nordenfelt guns, Maxim guns, and Colt guns. Many of these were captured from the Spanish and the Americans. There were also improvised artillery weapons made of water pipes reinforced with bamboo or timber, which could only fire once or twice.\nFile:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Nación 97 (Mondragon cropped).jpg|The Filipino Army considered acquiring the Mondragón rifle.\nFile:Murata gun.jpg|Murata rifles were used in small numbers by the Filipino Army.\nFile:Gevär m-1867 Sverige (Typexemplar serienummer 1 - Armémuseum).jpg|The Spanish Remington Rolling Block rifle was one of the first rifles used by the Filipinos during the Revolution.\nFile:Nordenfelt machine gun 10 barrels.jpg| the multi-barreled Nordenfelt machine gun.\nFile:Philippine Revolutionary Army Rifles.jpg|Relics of Mauser 93 rifles used by Filipino infantry during the Philippine Revolution and Philippine–American War on display at Clark Museum.\nFile:Filipino knives.jpg| Bolo knives were widely available in the islands and were used extensively by the revolutionaries.\nRanks\nCommissioned officer ranks\nThe rank insignia of commissioned officers.\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Since the revolutionaries had become regular soldiers at the time of Emilio Aguinaldo, they started to recruit males and some females aged 15 and above as a form of national service. A few Spanish and Filipino enlisted personnel and officers of the Spanish Army and Spanish Navy defected to the Revolutionary Army, as well as a number of foreign individuals and American defectors who volunteered to join during the course of the revolution.\nConscription in the revolutionary army was in effect in the Philippines and military service was mandatory at that time by the order of Gen. Antonio Luna, the Chief Commander of the Army during the Philippine–American War.\nOrganization\nThe army was formed into a regular army by Aguinaldo's decree of July 30, 1898. The army was organized into companies of 110 soldiers and officers, with soldiers armed with rifles and bolos while officers were armed with revolvers and swords. Four companies comprised a battalion headed by a lieutenant colonel. A full-complement battalion was composed of six companies and was headed by a brigadier general or colonel. In practice, the battalion varied in size depending on the province: six-company battalions in populous provinces like Cavite and Manila, four-company battalions in Morong, Bataan, and Nueva Ecija, a two-company battalion in Mindoro, and a single company in Marinduque. Battalions were named after their respective provinces, such as the 1st Battalion of Tayabas. Soldiers were recruited voluntarily, with surplus volunteers either joining the police or forming a central corps under the direct command of the President. It grew to four regiments of battalions totaling 10,560 men.\nPhilippine Revolutionary Navy\nThe Philippine Revolutionary Navy was established during the second phase of the Philippine Revolution when General Emilio Aguinaldo formed the Revolutionary Navy. On May 1, 1898, the first ship handed by Admiral George Dewey to the Revolutionary Navy is a small pinnace from the Reina Cristina of Admiral Patricio Montojo, which was named Magdalo. The Navy was initially composed of a small fleet of eight Spanish steam launches captured from the Spaniards. The ships were refitted with 9-centimeter guns. The rich, namely Leon Apacible, Manuel Lopez and Gliceria Marella de Villavicencio, later donated five other vessels of greater tonnage, the Taaleño, the Balayan, the Bulusan, the Taal and the Purísima Concepción. The 900-ton inter-island tobacco steamer further reinforced the fleet, Compania de Filipinas (renamed as the navy flagship Filipinas), steam launches purchased from China and other watercraft donated by wealthy patriots.\nNaval stations were later established to serve as ships' home bases in the following:\n*Ports of Aparri\n*Ports of Legaspi\n*Ports of Balayan\n*Ports of Calapan\n*Ports of San Roque, Cavite\nOn September 26, 1898, Aguinaldo appointed Captain Pascual Ledesma (a merchant ship captain) as Director of the Bureau of the Navy, assisted by Captain Angel Pabie (another merchant ship captain). After passing of the Malolos Constitution the Navy was transferred from the Ministry of Foreign Relations to the Department of War (thereafter known as the Department of War and the Navy) headed by Gen. Mariano Trías.\nAs the tensions between Filipinos and Americans erupted in 1899 and a continued blockade on naval forces by the Americans, the Philippine naval forces started to be decimated.\nFlags and early banners of the revolution\nFile:Flag of the Philippines (1898–1901).svg|Official Flag of the First Philippine Republic.\nFile:Philippines Aguinaldo flag (obverse).svg|Color of the North Luzon Expeditionary Forces.\nFile:Flag of the Biak-na-Bato.svg|Flag of the Republic of Biak-na-Bato.\nFile:Personal flag of Andres Bonifacio.svg|Flag used during the Cry of Pugadlawin.\nFile:Flag of the Sovereign Tagalog Nation.svg|Flag of Magdiwang faction led by Mariano Álvarez and Flag of the Magdalo faction led by Baldomero Aguinaldo.\nFile:Flag of Katipunan.svg|The flag of the Katipunan was also used in many campaigns.\nFile:Philippine revolution flag llanera.png|The Skull Banner by General Mariano Llanera of the republican army.\nFile:Flag of Pio del Pilar.svg|Banner of Pio del Pilar, called the Bandila ng Matagumpay (Flag Of the Triumphants).\nFile:Philippine revolution flag gregoriodelpilar.svg|Banner of General Gregorio del Pilar, which he used during his campaigns.\nFile:Flag of the Katagalugan Republic.svg|Flag of \"Republic of Katagalugan\" established by Macario Sakay\nFile:Red flag.svg|The supposed flag adopted by the Kakarong Republic was either the Katipunan banner or a plain red banner shown above.\nFile:Flag of the Katipuneros of Bicol.svg|Flag of the Katipuneros of the Bicol region.\nFile:Flag of the Negros Republic.svg|Flag of the Revolutionary Government in Bacolod (1899), Republic of Negros.\nFile:Negrense revolution banner.svg|Flag of the Negros Revolution.\nOfficers\nGeneral officers\nDuring the existence of the Philippine Revolutionary Army, over a hundred individuals were appointed to General Officer grades.\nOther notable officers\n, a former president of the Philippines, rose to the rank of major in the army.]]\n– Aide to Lieutenant General Antonio Luna.]]\n* General Águeda Kahabagan y Iniquinto - Commander of the Reserve Corps from April 6, 1899.
