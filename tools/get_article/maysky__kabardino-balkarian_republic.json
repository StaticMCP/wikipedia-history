Population:\nHistory\nA Russian military outpost of Prishib was founded in 1824. It was re-organized as the stanitsa of Prishibskaya in 1829. In 1875, Kotlyarevskaya railway station was built  south of the stanitsa, and a settlement formed around it in 1888. In 1920, that settlement was renamed Prishibsky, in 1925—Maysky. In 1959, the settlement and the stanitsa were merged into the urban-type settlement of Maysky, which was granted town status in 1965.\nAdministrative and municipal status\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Maysky serves as the administrative center of Maysky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Maysky, together with five rural localities, is incorporated within Maysky Municipal District as Maysky Urban Settlement.\nDemographics\nPopulation:\nEthnic composition\nAs of the 2002 Census, the ethnic distribution of the population was:\n*Russians: 74.2%\n*Turks: 7.8%\n*Koreans: 3.8%\n*Kabardins: 3.7%\n*Ukrainians: 2.0%\n*Other ethnicities: 8.5%\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*"
