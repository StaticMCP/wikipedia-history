(or URHS of NJ) is a non-profit educational organization directed at supporting the preservation of New Jersey's historical railroad equipment and artifacts for the proposed New Jersey Transportation Heritage Center or in its absence, another railroad museum in New Jersey.\nIn order to coordinate resources, representatives from most of New Jersey's major railroad-interest organizations formed the URHS of NJ in 1987. URHS of NJ has been working toward rescuing potential items from scrapping and has been assisting in searching for the location of The New Jersey Transportation Heritage Center. The URHS of NJ expects to play a major role in its design, content and operation.\nThe United Railroad Historical Society of NJ Inc. is located at 104 Morris Avenue in Boonton, NJ. The zip code is 07005–1314.\nLocomotives\nThe URHS has a handful of locomotives either restored or under restoration, while some are awaiting restoration.[https://www.urhs.org/]\nLocomotives:\n* \"Baltimore and Ohio Railroad #412:\" A Baldwin VO-1000 originally built in February 1945 as United States Navy #19.

It was stored along with three other sister engines at the Meadowlands Maintenance Complex, while the rest of the fleet are currently stored on the Lackawanna Cut-Off as of August 2024.
