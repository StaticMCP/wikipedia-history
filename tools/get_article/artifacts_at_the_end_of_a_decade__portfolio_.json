Assembled by Steven Watson and Carol Huebner Venezia, Artifacts is a collection of pieces designed uniquely for this project. The portfolio is  and weighs . Its \"pages\" are made from everything from glass, copper, clay, rope, felt, and film to lycra, neoprene, polyester, mylar, vinyl, stucco, and glitter. Artifacts was described by Jessica Scott of UMass Amherst as a \"multidisciplinary American survey of the 1970's in the form of an artists' archive.\" Artifacts is a limited edition of 100.\nMost recently, Artifacts was exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021, and at the Centre Pompidou in 2022 accompanied by a talk by Watson.\nConception and Production\nIn 1979, Watson and Huebner Venezia sent 200 letters to active visual artists, writers, and musicians, inviting them to take part in a collaborative project. Those who responded created a page for the \"book\" that became Artifacts. The portfolio was assembled without any outside funding or intervention and was finished in 1981. In an interview for Widewalls Magazine, Watson expressed that he was \"amazed\" that he, Huebner Venezia, and the participating artists \"could produce such a huge collaborative project organized without grants or gallery sponsorship or professionals in the art world.\" He continued that the project depended strictly on \"engagement from artists who were drawn to the idea, rather than any commercial benefits.\"\nArtists\nThe artists who contributed to Artifacts, in alphabetical order by last name, are:\n* Harry Anderson, Laurie Anderson, John Ashbery, Charles Arnold Jr., Bern Boyle, Stephanie Blumenthal, Lucinda Childs, Jane Comfort, R.
