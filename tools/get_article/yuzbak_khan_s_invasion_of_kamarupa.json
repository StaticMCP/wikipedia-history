However, he was defeated and captured by the Kamata ruler, Sandhya.\nBackground\nIn 1228, Raja Prithu of Kamarupa was killed by Malik-us-said Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah and his son was placed on the throne on the condition of paying tributes. In 1229, Nasir-ud-din, the governor of Bengal died, Raja Sandhya of Kamata Kingdom drove away Muslims from the country and brought the regions up to Karatoya under his control. Next, Raja Sandhya invaded Gaur and with the support of several Hindu chiefs of Kamarupa called Bhuyans, annexed trans–Karatoya regions without any strong resistance from the Muslims. Thus, Sandhya avenged the previous loss of Kamarupa the hands of Muslim invaders and assumed the title of \"Gaudesvara\".\nBattle\nMalik Yuzbek was determined to invade Kamarupa and to avenge the previous loss. According to Jadunath Sarkar, Yuzbek crossed the Karatoya River near Goraghat in Rangpur district and marched through modern Goalpara district. Yuzbek invaded Kamarupa (present day Gauhati) and its immediate vicinity. This was called Kamarupa Nagara by Pala kings. Yuzbek occupied Kamarupa and got immense wealth and treasures. Yuzbek's army did not meet much resistance while advancing, however they met effective resistance from the rear. Invaders first occupied the capital and Rai of Kamarupa evacuated it. But the Muslims could not get full possession of the city as they were engaged in fierce fighting with Kamarupa soldiers who were armed with bows and arrows.\nAs the monsoon arrived, Kamarupa soldiers arrived from all sides, cut off the supplies of the city and seized the plains and waterways. The sultan caught hold of a guide who undertook to conduct his army by a shorter route through the submontane tract, evidently by way of Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri, in the direction of Devkot. When the\nsultan had retreated several stages, and entered the defiles and jungles he was trapped in a narrow valley assailed by the Hindus on all sides. In an engagement there, the entire Turkish army was defeated and killed and the sultan with all his children, family and dependents became captives in the hands of Sandhya.\nAftermath\nDue to wounds, Yuzbak died in front of his son. To check the further invasion of the Muslims, Sandhya shifted his capital from north Gauhati to Kamatapur. This place had more strategic importance than the old\ncity. The Kingdom of Kamarupa was called Kamata and the king designated as Kamatesvar after this event.\nSee also\n*Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Yuzbak\n*Kamarupa\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
