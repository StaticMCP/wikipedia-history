Avril Lavigne and k-os won three awards each, while Billy Talent and Feist won 2 apiece.\nNominations were announced 7 February 2005.\nThe Tragically Hip were this year's Canadian Music Hall of Fame recipient. Dan Aykroyd was originally scheduled to present this honour, but inexplicably cancelled several days before the awards ceremony. Sarah Harmer presented the Hall of Fame award in his place. Both Aykroyd and Harmer have ties to the Kingston, Ontario community in which The Tragically Hip are based.\nNeil Young was scheduled to appear at these awards, based on a promise that he would attend if the ceremonies were held in Winnipeg. But the 1982 Canadian Music Hall of Fame inductee cancelled his appearance shortly before the Juno ceremonies following surgery to correct a brain aneurysm.\nOther Juno Weekend events included the JunoFest concert series held at venues around the city, the Songwriters’ Circle on Sunday afternoon, and the Juno Fan Fare autograph session with Keshia Chanté, Great Big Sea, Kardinal Offishall, The Tea Party, Thornley, and other Canadian bands and artists.\nThe following awards were presented during the primary ceremonies, with other categories awarded at a non-televised ceremony the previous night:\n*Group of the Year\n*New Artist of the Year\n*Juno Fan Choice Award\n*Songwriter of the Year\n*Album of the Year\n*Adult Alternative Album of the Year\n*Rap Recording of the Year\n*Single of the Year\nNominees and winners\nArtist of the Year\nWinner: Avril Lavigne\nOther Nominees:\n*Bryan Adams\n*Celine Dion\n*Diana Krall\n*k.d. lang\nNew Artist of the Year\nWinner: Feist\nOther Nominees:\n*Keshia Chanté\n*Fefe Dobson\n*Matt Dusk\n*Matt Mays\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Billy Talent\nOther Nominees:\n*Great Big Sea\n*Simple Plan\n*Sum 41\n*The Tragically Hip\nJuno Fan Choice Award\nWinner: Avril Lavigne\nOther Nominees:\n*Diana Krall\n*Sarah McLachlan\n*Marie-Elaine Thibert\n*Shania Twain\nNew Group of the Year\nWinner: Alexisonfire\nOther Nominees:\n*Death from Above 1979\n*The Marble Index\n*Thornley\n*The Waking Eyes\nSongwriter of the Year\nWinner: Ron Sexsmith, \"Whatever It Takes\", \"Not About to Lose\", \"Hard Bargain\"\nOther Nominees:\n*Buck 65 \"Wicked and Weird\", \"463\", \"Sore\" (all co-written with T.O.A.B.
