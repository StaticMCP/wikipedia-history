      "text": "# List of Battlefield Friends episodes\n\nBattlefield Friends, often abbreviated as BFFs, is an American animated comedy web series created by Hank & Jed Movie Pictures and originally distributed by Machinima before becoming an independent series published on YouTube by Neebs Gaming. The show is based on the video game series Battlefield by Electronic Arts and features an ensemble voice cast starring Brent Triplett, Jon Etheridge, Tony Schnur and Nate Panning. The show centers on a group of four friends — Noob, Engineer, Recon and Medic — as they get into various comedic scenarios while playing Battlefield. Each character is based on a Battlefield 3 multiplayer class aside from Noob, who is a stereotype of inexperienced players in the game.\nDuring the show's time under Machinima, episodes would air weekly through the main network or the company's Happy Hour block channel. Between seasons five and six, episodes would air early on the streaming service Vessel before it was bought and closed by Verizon on October 31, 2016. After the conclusion of the show's sixth season, Machinima was shut down by AT&T and all videos on the network were permanently set to private, including all previous episodes of Battlefield Friends. Hank & Jed Movie Pictures subsequently reuploaded all of the episodes to their gaming channel, Neebs Gaming, in 2021, and released an independent seventh season based on Battlefield 2042 a year later.\nSeries overview\n| end1       =\n| infoA1 = Battlefield 3\n| color2 = #FF6229\n| link2 = #Season 2 (2012)\n| episodes2 = 13\n| start2     =\n| end2       =\n| infoA2 = Battlefield 3\n| color3 = #005F6C\n| link3 = #Season 3 (2013)\n| episodes3  = 14\n| start3     =\n| end3       =\n| infoA3 = Battlefield 3\n| color4 = #50B5A5\n| link4      = #Season 4 (2014)\n| episodes4  = 13\n| start4     =\n| end4       =\n| infoA4 = Battlefield 4\n| color5 = #ccccfc\n| link5      = #Season 5 (2015)\n| episodes5  = 15\n| start5     =\n| end5       =\n| infoA5 = Battlefield 4 / Battlefield Hardline\n| color6 = #8A4627\n| link6      = #Season 6 (2016)\n| episodes6  = 15\n| start6     =\n| end6       =\n| infoA6 = Battlefield 4\n| color7 = #574AA9\n| link7      = #Season 7 (2022)\n| episodes7  = 6\n| start7     =\n| end7       =\n| infoA7 = Battlefield 2042\n}}\nEpisodes\nBattlefield 3\nSeason 1 (2012)\n|ShortSummary = When a group of friends jump into a helicopter in Battlefield 3, they quickly realize that it is being piloted by a noob, and are forced to reluctantly help him learn to fly.\n|LineColor = 7196DA\n}}\n|ShortSummary = Recon gets into position to take out an enemy tank crew with a sniper rifle, until Noob appears and compromises his mission through varying comedic gags.\n|LineColor = 7196DA\n}}\n|ShortSummary = When Engineer gets his hands on a USAS-12, one of the most overpowered weapons in Battlefield 3, the group of friends argue whether it might be an unfair advantage.\n|LineColor = 7196DA\n}}\n|ShortSummary = When Noob and Engineer are pinned down by a team of enemies, Noob discovers the power of the defibrillator.
