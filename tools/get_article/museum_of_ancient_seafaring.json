The new archaeological center is built right beside the current museum building. A workshop is affiliated to the museum, where visitors have the opportunity to watch the staff replicate ancient ship models.\nHistory\nDue to the fact that in 1981/82 during construction works near the Rhine river well-preserved remains of several ships from Late Antiquity, the so said Mainzer Roman ships were discovered, an adequate exhibition space for these was required. There were discovered two different types of warship of late Roman Rhine fleet ″Classis Germanica″ and other ship types.\nLiterature\n* Barbara Pferdehirt, Das Museum für antike Schifffahrt.
