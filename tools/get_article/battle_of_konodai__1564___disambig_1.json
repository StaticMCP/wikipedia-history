Both Ujiyasu and Yoshihiro were the sons of the commanders at the first battle of Kōnodai, in which Hōjō Ujitsuna defeated the combined forces of Satomi Yoshitaka and Ashikaga Yoshiaki (Oyumi).\nBattle\nOutnumbered 20,000 to 8,000, Satomi fell back when the Hōjō vanguard advanced. But this was a feint, and an attempt to draw his enemy into a trap. However, Hōjō Ujiyasu expected a trap of this sort, and had sent his son, Ujimasa, with a small force to attack the Satomi rear, surrounding, and later Ujiyasu defeated Yoshihiro. In the ensuing battle, Satomi Yoshihiro saw his son, Chokuro, killed by Matsuda Yasuyoshi, a Hōjō retainer.\nAftermath\nHōjō Ujiyasu celebrated his victory with a poem:\n:: Conquering the foe\n:: As I wished at Kōnodai\n:: Now do I behold\n:: The evening sunshine of Katsuura\nAfter the battle, Matsuda Yasuyoshi who had killed Yoshihiro's son, entered a life of monkhood, feeling remorse for the death of the young boy.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Turnbull, Stephen (1998).
