For other glossaries relevant to agricultural science, see Glossary of biology, Glossary of ecology, Glossary of environmental science, and Glossary of botanical terms.\nA\n.}}\nto drain from the land into the sea. The term may also refer to a method of land reclamation which relies on these gated sluices to convert tidal flats and coastal marshes into land suitable for agriculture. Aboiteau systems are usually installed several seasons prior to planting to allow time for natural flows of fresh water to drain through the soil and reduce its salinity. This method is practiced in areas with extremely high tidal amplitudes, particularly Atlantic Canada, where large tracts of coastal land would otherwise be rendered useless by regular tidal inundation.}}\nintended to kill or incapacitate members of the arthropod subclass Acari, which includes ticks and mites, either by targeting adults or by preventing the growth and development of their eggs or larvae. Acaricides specifically helpful against ticks may also be known as ixodicides and those specific to mites may be known as miticides. Though ticks and mites are not technically insects, in common usage, acaricides are sometimes referred to as .}}\n(66 feet) by one  (660 feet), equivalent to , or about 0.40 .}}\nconsidered collectively, united by their ownership, management, usage, geographical location, or some other unifying feature.}}\nof surface area to a depth of one foot, commonly used in the United States about large-scale water or soil resources.

Aircraft can be useful for quickly seeding vast expanses of land or wherever the terrain makes conventional ground-based seeding methods difficult or impractical, e.g., in marshy or flooded areas, where they are commonly used for sowing .}}\nof plants with the roots suspended in an air or mist environment rather than in soil or a solid , usually inside a closed or partially closed chamber where the properties of the air can be easily controlled. Plants are typically supported by the chamber itself or with foam supports or . Sometimes, only the roots are inside the growth chamber; stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits may or may not be. The primary benefits of aeroponics are increased gas exchange in the  and reduced access by pests and pathogens borne by solid or liquid growth media. It is often practiced in research contexts. Aeroponics is sometimes considered a subclass of  since water is still delivered to the plant via atomized droplets from a mist sprayer.

Fencing materials and designs vary widely depending on terrain and the kinds of animals they are intended to deter, though , , and  are common. They must often be continuous for long distances to surround farms or pastures. In many places, ranchers are required by law to build fences to enclose their grazing  within designated ; in others, livestock are , and responsibility for fencing belongs to those who wish to prevent animals from accessing their land.}}\n, i.e., the deliberate and systematic reproduction of living organisms to produce commodities that humans can use. In the broadest sense, agricultural land may also include certain types used only partially or seasonally for agricultural purposes, such as  and wild forests.

This necessarily diverts resources away from its edible or usable non-reproductive parts, which can negatively impact their flavor and texture and the quality of the harvest in general. The phenomenon is of particular concern in certain annual or biennial vegetable crops, including lettuce, spinach, cabbage, onions, leeks, carrots, and beetroot. Warm temperatures and changes in day length can both trigger the phytohormonal changes that cause bolting, and it may also occur as part of the plant's natural response to stress. In many species it manifests as the sudden rapid growth of unusually elongated stems which, if not removed, will produce an inflorescence.}}\nfor cultivated plants.}}\nin which a gently sloping field is divided into narrow strips by a series of low, parallel ridges of soil which align with the direction of the slope. Water is supplied to the upper edge or border of each strip, between the ridges, which act as levees to guide the flow of water as it moves down the length of the field by gravity. This method is useful for efficiently irrigating large areas of closely growing crops as well as certain  and  where topography and soils are suitable.}}\nin a  , consisting of the combined aleurone and pericarp and, in maize, also the pedicel.

In the United States, the cattle cycle refers to the approximately 10-year period during which the industry-wide population of  is alternately expanded and reduced over several consecutive years in response to perceived changes in profitability by beef producers. Low prices occur when cattle numbers or beef supplies are high, precipitating several years of herd liquidation; as cattle numbers decline and supplies diminish, prices gradually begin to rise along with renewed demand, causing cattle producers to begin breeding cattle and expanding their herds again.}}\n.}}\n.}}\n.}}\n.}}\nand production of agricultural products from cell cultures grown in a laboratory, such as , by using techniques of molecular biology and biochemistry to directly synthesize the complex mixture of proteins, fats, and other substances which are found naturally in living tissues. Most of the industry is focused on cultivating animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs by growing animal tissues from stem cells in vitro'' and then simulating the same series of biochemical processes that occurs naturally in actual animal bodies, as opposed to raising and  farmed  as in conventional , which has long been criticized for its negative impacts on the environment, human health, , and animal welfare. Cellular agriculture has therefore been championed as a  and ethical alternative, though the necessary procedures and infrastructure are usually highly specific and technical.}}\n, livestock numbers, agricultural  and expenses,  and profits, types and uses of facilities and , demographics of owners and workers, product quality, and sustainability, among others.

Water is usually supplied by a well or an underground pipeline near the pivot, and the wheeled frame is propelled by hydraulic pressure or electric motors. A typical center-pivot line is  long and capable of irrigating a  circle within a  square, covering about 78% of the surface area; some systems can also irrigate the corners of the square by means of an  at the end of the line or a trailing segment of frame that swings out into the corner areas.

Conservation tillage includes , , and  systems.}}\nmore or less continuously throughout an extended or indefinite , without any significant pause or interruption such as for replanting. For most conventionally grown plant and animal crops, production is limited to specific times of year by the need for suitable weather or for periods of inactivity during which soils can recover fertility and producers can resupply  and otherwise prepare for the start of the next , meaning the harvested products are only available to consumers for a few weeks or months at the end of each growing season. In some places, however, where the climate is largely consistent throughout the year, or wherever labor and inputs are consistently available, certain crops may be grown, harvested, and sold during unusually long seasons or even year-round. Some seasonal crops can also have their harvest windows  by growing them in highly  or by deliberately staggering planting times so that different groups of plants are of different ages and thus one or more groups are ready for harvest at any given time of year.}}\nand/or  a sloping field by following its natural contour lines, such that the resulting  and  curve around the slope perpendicular to the direction of the force of gravity, with each remaining at approximately the same elevation for its entire length. This orientation helps prevent  and  by reducing the velocity with which water and soil moves down the slope, minimizing the formation of rills and gullies during heavy precipitation and allowing more time for the water to settle into the soil. Contour farming also reduces the runoff of , power consumption, and wear on machines, thereby increasing production efficiency.}}\nor other agricultural production carried out on the basis of an agreement between the buyer or consumer and the farmer or producer. Contracts typically involve the producer agreeing to supply certain quantities of a crop or other product according to quality standards and delivery requirements specified by the buyer, and the buyer agreeing to buy the product, often at ; the buyer often also agrees to support the producer in various ways, e.g. by supplying inputs, assisting with land preparation, providing production advice, and helping to transport the finished product.}}\nsuch as  over the same area of land, particularly , which often has negative consequences for numerous aspects of crop production.}}\nor efficiency or some other production target.

The term may also refer to the unused land itself. Intensive cultivation depletes soils of moisture and nutrients and disrupts many of the natural ecological processes that would ordinarily restore them, which are typically most active during the summer.
