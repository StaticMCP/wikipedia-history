The \"Regulation on State Awards and Medals\" (numbered 19892) was prepared and entered in the Official Gazette on 7 August 1988.\nCharacteristics\nThe medal of the Order of the Republic of Turkey has a diameter of 8.9&nbsp;cm. Composed of gold and silver, there is 18 carat green gold in the hexagonal center, a white enamel crescent and star on a red background, and a pencil application on six crescents around it. There are a total of seven swords, four long and three short, with white and red metal applications from the middle of the crescents and six white and red star enamels at the ends of these swords. 18-carat green gold is used in the stars.\nThe badge is a horizontal rectangle and measures . There is a silver frame pen application around it, a Turkish flag motif on the ground, and a rhodium-plated crescent and star enamel in white and red in the middle. The order consists of 61.5 grams of silver (925 sterling silver) and 5.4 grams of gold (750 mil gold). The rosette is 7.15 grams (925 sterling silver).\nOn 5 November 2013, with the regulation issued by the Justice and Development Party and approved by the President Abdullah Gül and published in the Official Gazette, the Mustafa Kemal Atatürk silhouette on the front of the state badge and the caption of \"Turkish Republic Order of the State\" on the back were removed. The Public Workers Unions Confederation of Turkey (Kamu-Sen) sued the State Council at the request of a stay of implementation and cancellation. In October 2016, the Council of State gave the cancellation of the missing regulation part of the state medal decision in the 6th article of the State Medals and Insignia Regulation, without including the \"Atatürk Relief\". The Prime Ministry appealed the decision. On 10 October 2018, a higher court of the Council of State, the Board of Trial Chambers, \"emphasizing that Atatürk is the immortal leader\", approved the decision of the lower court by majority vote and canceled the regulated part.\nCeremony\nThe Order of the State is given to the awardee together with the certificate and badge by the President of Turkey or a person appointed by the President at a ceremony. If the awardee is deceased (and the award has not been delegated to an heir), it is given to a son, starting from the eldest; to a daughter if there are no sons; to the father if there are no children; to the mother if there is no father; or to the spouse if there is no mother. In the absence of a spouse, it is transferred to the awardee's legal heirs in accordance with the provisions of the Turkish Civil Code.\nThe ceremony follows certain protocol and procedures. It starts with the National Anthem of Turkey and then decision regarding the aiming parties is read. Then, the award presenter faces each recipient and attaches their medal, awards their badges and certificates, and congratulates them. Recipients stand at intervals from the right, separately for each medal and decoration group. The order of the groups is arranged according to the priority order of the awards or medal in the law, the priority of the persons according to state protocol for public officials, and the surname (for private persons).\nStatistics\ngives the medal and certificate to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, 12 November 2013, Ankara]]\nThe order was first given to Lech Wałęsa, the second president of Poland, by President Süleyman Demirel in 1994. Demirel awarded the honor to the heads of state of 12 countries during his tenure. President Ahmet Necdet Sezer awarded the order only to the first president of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel. No order was given between 2001–2006. After President Abdullah Gül took office, the state order was given again beginning with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan awarded the order to King Philippe I of Belgium, King Salman bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, Emir of Kuwait Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, and Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi. Azerbaijan, Poland, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia are the only countries to have received the order twice.
