After the Bill became law if inconvenience resulted the ratepayers could petition him.  The Government would give due consideration to any such request.\nA subsequent petition signed by 51 ratepayers from the Hundred of Dudley which requested the severing of the Hundred of Dudley and the eastern part of the Hundred of Haines from the district council was received by the Government and was published in its gazette on 29 March 1888.  On 7 June 1888, the petitioners’ request was granted by a proclamation under the District Councils Act 1887 with the creation of a new local government area, the District Council of Dudley.\nHistory\nThe District Council of Kingscote’s seat was located in the town of Kingscote where two council chambers were constructed during its lifetime with the first in 1910 and the second in 1955.\nIn 1936, the district council was reported as covering an area of  with  of “main roads” and  of “district roads”, and a population of 851 people all accommodated in 1083 dwellings.  The industries included the production of eucalyptus oil from the leaves of the Kangaroo Island narrow-leaf mallee and the harvesting of gum from naturally-cultivated yacca plants known as “yacca-gumming.”\nIn 1986, the district council was reported as having an area of  and a population of about 3450 (as of 1984-85) with about 1500 people living in Kingscote and about 100 living in the smaller centre of Parndana located about  to the west of Kingscote.  The principal industries were agriculture and tourism.  Agriculture was concerned with the production of wool and meat, while tourism  was changing from a traditional focus on recreational fishing to one where people visited the island to see its landscape, flora and fauna.\nIn 1996, it was amalgamated with the District Council of Dudley to create the Kangaroo Island Council.\nChairmen and mayors\nThe following persons were elected as chairman of the district council up until 1974 when the title was changed to mayor for the following terms:\n*William Jones (1888-1890)\n*A.
