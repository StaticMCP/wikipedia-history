The movement is described as the \"world's first successful eco-revolution\" and has drawn parallels with the conflict depicted in the 2009 film, Avatar.\nOverview\nThe movie tells the story of the successful uprising of the indigenous peoples of Bougainville Island against the Papua New Guinea army and the mining plans of the mining corporation Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ) to exploit their natural resources.
