The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1983\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used once again the television show A Song for Europe to select its entry, as it had since its debut at the contest in 1957.\nCompeting entries\nAbout 445 entries were submitted for the national final. Of the entries, songwriters Tony Hiller, Martin Lee and Paul Curtis had had songs in the Eurovision final before. Stephanie De Sykes and Stuart Slater had twice won the A Song for Europe contest previously, in both  and . Songwriter Marty Kristian had competed with the New Seekers in 1972. His group featured former New Seekers singer Kathy Ann Rae and former entrant Lance Aston (of Prima Donna). \"When the Kissing Stops\", written by Martin Lee and Barry Upton of Brotherhood of Man together with their longtime writing partner Tony Hiller (who had co-written \"Save Your Kisses For Me\" with Lee), was originally intended for the group themselves, but they decided it would be best not to risk losing and thus not to take part; although all four members of the group attended the broadcast. The group did go on to record the song however and it featured on their album Lightning Flash. The writers of \"Keeping Our Love Alive\", Doug Flett and Guy Fletcher had written many previous British finalists, including the  winner \"Power to All Our Friends\". The group Casablanca were short lived, but the three main artists, Des Dyer, Samantha Spencer-Lane and Carla Donnelly all featured in other editions of the British final.\nFinal\nThe final was held on 24 March 1983 at the BBC Television Theatre in London, and was hosted by Terry Wogan. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of John Coleman as conductor accompanied all the songs, but all the music was pre-recorded. Prior to the voting, a dance and song montage filmed at the Royal Mint was played featuring the song \"Money (That's What I Want)\". The votes of eight regional juries based in Cardiff, Belfast, Norwich, Glasgow, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester and London decided the winner. Each jury region awarded 15 points to their favourite song, 12 points to the second, 10 points to the third and then 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 points in order of preference for the songs from 4th to 8th.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|+ A Song for Europe 198324 March 1983\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Draw\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist\n! scope=\"col\" | Song\n! scope=\"col\" | Songwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Points\n! scope=\"col\" | Place\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:gold;\"\n| 1\n| align=\"left\" | Sweet Dreams\n| align=\"left\" | \"I'm Never Giving Up\"\n| align=\"left\" | Ron Roker, Phil Wigger, Jan Pulsford\n| 109\n| 1\n|-\n| 2\n| align=\"left\" | Sam Childs\n| align=\"left\" | \"I'm Going Home\"\n| align=\"left\" | Geoff Stephens, Graham Preskett\n| 50\n| 8\n|-\n| 3\n| align=\"left\" | Stuart Slater\n| align=\"left\" | \"All Around the World\"\n| align=\"left\" | Stephanie De Sykes, Stuart Slater\n| 63\n| 5\n|-\n| 4\n| align=\"left\" | Casablanca\n| align=\"left\" | \"With Love\"\n| align=\"left\" | Des Dyer, Clive Scott\n| 72\n| 3\n|-\n| 5\n| align=\"left\" | Mirror\n| align=\"left\" | \"We've Got All the Time in the World\"\n| align=\"left\" | Tony Hiller, Paul Curtis\n| 91\n| 2\n|-\n| 6\n| align=\"left\" | Audio\n| align=\"left\" | \"Love on Your Mind\"\n| align=\"left\" | Marty Kristian, Trevor Spencer\n| 68\n| 4\n|-\n| 7\n| align=\"left\" | Rubic\n| align=\"left\" | \"When the Kissing Stops\"\n| align=\"left\" | Tony Hiller, Martin Lee, Barry Upton\n| 63\n| 5\n|-\n| 8\n| align=\"left\" | Ritzy\n| align=\"left\" | \"Keeping Our Love Alive\"\n| align=\"left\" | Guy Fletcher, Doug Flett\n| 60\n| 7\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+ Detailed Jury Votes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Draw\n! scope=\"col\" | Song\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n| 1\n| align=\"left\" | \"I'm Never Giving Up\"\n| 15 || 12 || 15 || 15 || 15 || 15 || 10 || 12\n| 109\n|-\n| 2\n| align=\"left\" | \"I'm Going Home\"\n| 10 || 5 || 6 || 8 || 5 || 5 || 5 || 6\n| 50\n|-\n| 3\n| align=\"left\" | \"All Around the World\"\n| 6 || 7 || 12 || 9 || 10 || 6 || 6 || 7\n| 63\n|-\n| 4\n| align=\"left\" | \"With Love\"\n| 5 || 10 || 10 || 5 || 8 || 12 || 7 || 15\n| 72\n|-\n| 5\n| align=\"left\" | \"We've Got All the Time in the World\"\n| 12 || 15 || 8 || 12 || 12 || 7 || 15 || 10\n| 91\n|-\n| 6\n| align=\"left\" | \"Love on Your Mind\"\n| 8 || 9 || 5 || 10 || 6 || 9 || 12 || 9\n| 68\n|-\n| 7\n| align=\"left\" | \"When the Kissing Stops\"\n| 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 7 || 10 || 8 || 8\n| 63\n|-\n| 8\n| align=\"left\" | \"Keeping Our Love Alive\"\n| 7 || 6 || 9 || 7 || 9 || 8 || 9 || 5\n| 60\n|-\n! colspan=\"11\" | Jury Spokespersons\n|-\n| colspan=\"11\" |\n* CardiffIwan Thomas\n* BelfastDavid Olver\n* NorwichIan Masters\n* GlasgowKen Bruce\n* BristolAndy Batten-Foster\n* BirminghamMarjorie Lofthouse\n* ManchesterJohn Mundy\n* LondonColin Berry\n|}\nAt Eurovision\nAfter Bardo's \"One Step Further\" in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982, the United Kingdom placed one spot better at sixth place, scoring 79 points, with \"I'm Never Giving Up\" by Sweet Dreams.\nThe contest was broadcast on BBC1 (with commentary by Terry Wogan).
