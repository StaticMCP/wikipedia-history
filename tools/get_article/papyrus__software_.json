It has been developed by the Laboratory of Model Driven Engineering for Embedded Systems (LISE) which is a part of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA-List).\nPapyrus can either be used as a standalone tool or as an Eclipse plugin. It provides support for Domain Specific Languages and SysML. Papyrus is designed to be easily extensible as it is based on the principle of UML Profiles.\nUML2\nPapyrus is a graphical editing tool for UML2 as defined by OMG. Papyrus provides support for UML profiles. Every part of Papyrus may be customized: model explorer, diagram editors, property editors, etc.\nSysML\nPapyrus also provides a complete support to SysML in order to enable model-based system engineering. It includes an implementation of the SysML static profile and the specific graphical editors required for SysML.\nUML-RT\nA variant of Papyrus, Papyrus for Real Time (Papyrus-RT), implements UML-RT, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed for realtime embedded systems development. UML-RT is a UML-based variant of Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling (ROOM).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cea.fr/english About CEA]"
