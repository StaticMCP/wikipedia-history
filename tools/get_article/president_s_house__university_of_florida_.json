It was replaced in 2015 with the Dasburg House which is the current residence of the President of UF. It was re-named Earl and Christy Powell University House. The facility now is open to UF organizations and groups that want to entertain, meet or hold a retreat there.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*https://president.ufl.edu/office/house/ Official website]\n*[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20061216/LOCAL/612160323 Gainesville Sun article about President's House]"
