It is named after the most famous landmark of Caloocan, the Monumento Circle, which houses the Bonifacio Monument, a famous monument to Filipino revolutionary Andrés Bonifacio. It opened on May 12, 1985, when LRT-1 became fully operational. Being the northern terminus of LRT-1 until Balintawak was opened in 2010, it is called Monumento Terminal and historically as North Terminal.\nMonumento is located on Rizal Avenue in Grace Park West & Grace Park East, Caloocan. It is the third station for trains headed to Dr. Santos, the twenty-third station for trains headed to Fernando Poe Jr., and is one of the two LRT-1 stations in Caloocan, the other being 5th Avenue.\nLRTA has modified two tracks at Monumento leading to Balintawak, Fernando Poe Jr., and North Triangle Common stations.\nIt underwent renovations in September 2017 and was relaunched on February 14, 2018, as Yamaha Monumento station as Light Rail Manila Corporation entered into a naming rights deal with Yamaha Motor Philippines.\nTransportation and building links\n]]\nThe station serves as a terminal and transfer point for several bus and jeepney routes serving the cities of Manila, Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela via Rizal Avenue Extension, Samson Road, and MacArthur Highway. Major provincial bus companies also have their own terminals right outside the station like Victory Liner, First North Luzon Transit, and RJ Express.\nThere was a proposal to extend the Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3, or MRT-3, to Monumento, which would result in both stations being linked and Monumento terminal becoming a transfer point between LRT-1 and MRT-3. However, those plans have been shelved in favor of an extension of the LRT-1 Line towards the North Triangle Common Station over the same routing as the previous MRT-3 proposal.\nThe station is directly linked to SM City Grand Central, which replaced the former Ever Gotesco Grand Central that burned down. The station's east gate and platform are directly connected to the LRT Caloocan Mall.\nA bus stop of the EDSA Carousel, also named Monumento, is located nearby along EDSA.\nSee also\n*List of rail transit stations in Metro Manila\n*Manila Light Rail Transit System\nReferences"
