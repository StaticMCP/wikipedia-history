It was fought by the Emirate of Córdoba and the Byzantine Empire who were besieged by the Muslims in the Castle of Alaró for eight years and five months.\nThe emir Abdullah of Córdoba recognized the conquest and named Issam al-Khawlani governor of the island, a position he held from 904 to 912.}}The historiography debates about who were the rums that offered resistance, due to the polysemy of this word; on the one hand it could refer, in a restricted sense, to the Byzantine Empire or, in an extended sense, to the Christians, given that in 897, a papal bull made the islands dependent on the bishopric of Girona, showing the great weakness of the power structures, which have been greatly weakened by successive Muslim attacks.\nMuslim rule\nThe Muslim rule in Majorca (902-1229) began when a powerful man from the Emir of Córdoba, Issam al-Khawlani, traveled on his way to Mecca on pilgrimage with more ships. Faced with a great storm, the emir and his entourage took refuge in Majorca. He discovered an island that he did not know and when he returned from his pilgrimage he tried to find out more about it and inform his lord, the emir Abdullah of the defensive conditions and incite him to conquer it.\nIssam al-Khawlani informed his lord that Majorca belonged to an archipelago of islands that the old Romans called Baleària. Soon the emir sent many ships towards the archipelago, mainly the largest one to achieve its conquest. Despite the opposition, the natives held out for eight years and five months. Once reintegrated into the Emirate of Córdoba, the arrival of Saracens was constant.\nGovernors of Majorca\nLords of Majorca of the Emirate of Córdoba (902-1012)\n* Issam al-Khawlani (902-913)\n* Abdullah ibn Issam al-Khawlani (913-946)\n* Al-Muwaffaq (946-969)\n* Kautir (969-998)\n* Muqatil (998-1012)\nLords of Majorca of the Taifa of Dénia (1009-76)\n* Abu-l-Abbàs ibn Raixiq (1016-?)\n* Al-Àghlab (< 1041)\n* Sulayman ibn Maxiqan (<1076)\n* Abd-Al·lah ibn al-Murtada ibn al-Àghlab (1076-1087) Valí.\nIndependent Emirs of Majorca (1076-1115)\n* Abd-Al·lah ibn al-Murtada ibn al-Àghlab (1087-1093), Emir.\n* Mubàixxir Nàssir-ad-Dawla (1093-1114)\n* Abu-r-Rabí Sulayman (1114-1115)\nAlmoravid lords of Majorca (1116-1203)\n* Wànur ibn Abi-Bakr (1116-1126)\n* Muhàmmad ibn Ghàniya (1126-1155)\n* Ishaq ibn Muhàmmad ibn Ghàniya (1155-1184)\n* Muhàmmad ibn Ishaq ibn Ghàniya (1184)\n* Alí ibn Ghàniya (1184-1187)\n* 'Abdallah ibn Ghaniya (1187-1203)\nAlmohad lords of Majorca (1203-1229)\n* Abd-Al·lah ibn Ta-Al·lah al-Kumí (1203)\n* Abu Zayd ibn Tujan (1204-1208)\n* Abu Abd-Allah ibn Abi Hafs ibn Abdelmumen (1208)\n* Abu Yahya Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abi Imran al-Tinmalali (1208-1229)\nReferences"
