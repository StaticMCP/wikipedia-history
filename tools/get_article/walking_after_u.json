Rubber Duckie was led by technical guitarist Jia starting in the early 2000s, along with (then) drummer Sunny. Rubber Duckie had attained much recognition as a strong female rock group, and had released two singles and a full album. Swings was led by vocal and bassist Haein, along with drummer A-zzang. Swings received much critical acclaim and mainstream popularity when proceeding through several elimination rounds on 'Top Band - Season 2'. Both Rubber Duckie and Swings were featured in episode \"Breaking Down Our Prejudice\" of Arirang TV's program \"Rock on Korea\" in July 2013.\nAfter the Girls' Rock Festival, and much discussion by management of both bands, an agreement was reached to draw talent and form a single new band. Walking After U drew from both bands' previous work, taking strengths and finding a new style. Many songs in the current repertoire still come from one of the previous bands' catalogs.\nIn 2017, Walking After U represented South Korea at the Emergenza World Band Competition after they won the national round at Hongdae V-Hall in Seoul.\nWalking After U competed in Mnet's band competition Great Seoul Invasion in 2022, in which they performed their song You in the first round with positive reaction from the other competing bands, but weren't chosen by any of the team leaders. They however scored high in the band pool system and were then chosen by judges No Min-woo and N.Flying's Jaehyun and Hun. In the second round of the competition, they performed an arrangement of DNA by BTS as part of a mini mission and were praised for their interpretation of the song by the judges, but did not advance to the next round.\nTouring\nAfter releasing their debut album in 2014, Walking After U toured South Korea extensively. Playing in clubs, bars, coffee shops, and concert venues, the band focused on building a wide fanbase. Following their Korean tour, they also performed in other East Asian countries, including a club tour in Tokyo. They also toured in South Korea after they released their albums Running Wild (2016) and Arirang (2018).\nIn 2023, they performed across South Korea as part of their tour The most important thing is not to lose your mind. With more than 40 performances, the tour lasted from April to September.\nDiscography\nCompilation albums\n* Different Color #blue (2022)\n* Walking After U (2023)\nExtended plays\n* Unleash (2014)\n* Running Wild (2016)\n* Arirang (2018)\n* Six of Swords (2020)\n* Are We Ready?
