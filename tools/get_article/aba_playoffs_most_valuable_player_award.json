The award was first awarded in the 1968 ABA Playoffs and was retired as part of the ABA–NBA merger. In sports, the player judged to be the most important to the team is the most valuable player (MVP).\nThe inaugural award winner was Pittsburgh Pipers' player Connie Hawkins. On all occasions, the player who won the Playoffs MVP award was from the team that won the ABA championship. Julius Erving, who led the New York Nets to two ABA championships in 1974 and 1976, was the only player to win the award twice.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| *\n|Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has received the Playoffs MVP award\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
