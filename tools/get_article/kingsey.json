It is near the boundary with Oxfordshire, about two miles east of Thame and a mile south of Haddenham.\nThe village toponym is of 12th-century origin and means 'king's island', referring to a piece of dry land that belonged to the king in the marshes that were once common in this part of the country.  In 1174 the village was called Eya, meaning 'island', though by 1192 it had gained its more modern name of Kingesie.  This leads historians to believe that the village is named after King Richard I of England.\nKingsey was transferred to Buckinghamshire from Oxfordshire in 1933, effectively being swapped for Towersey.\nHistorically people from this village and those surrounding it were known by the derogatory term 'wetfeet', because of the high water table of the area leading to the ground being so waterlogged.\nGrade 1 listed Tythrop Park in Kingsey is listed as having an early duck decoy similar to that in Boarstall Duck Decoy in Buckinghamshire.
