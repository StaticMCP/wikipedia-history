The company was founded in 1898 and is among the oldest in its industry in the United States. It operates in over 90 countries and has more than 30 licensees.\nIn 2015 and 2016 the firm came under the ownership and operation of Malaysia-based Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor (60%) and Kaiserkorp Corp (40%) as a result of acquisitions made then.\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1898 as the United States Bedding Company by Samuel Bronstein in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. It commenced its operations with six employees in a small factory and gradually expanded its manufacturing. The company was officially incorporated as  United States Bedding Co. in 1905.\nBy 1912, the company had developed a complete product line that included mattresses, frames, pillows, and couches. In the early 1900s, U.S. Bedding expanded its workforce and gained recognition for innovation in the industry. In 1923, the company obtained its first patent for a non-stretchable mattress. By 1926, it had 150 employees.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, the U.S. Bedding Company held a naming contest for their redesigned mattress. The winning entry, 'King Koil', proposed by a 13-year-old African-American girl named Erla Bell Thompson, became the brand's name.\nKing Koil had supplied the U.S. Government with cots, beds, and mattresses during World War I and World War II. During the war years, the company manufactured various military equipment and furniture, including wooden gun racks, chopping blocks, billy clubs, submarine bunks, stretchers, and beds for military bases worldwide, while also focusing on the sales and marketing of King Koil mattresses.\nIn the late 1970s, King Koil completed the acquisition of the Englander Mattress Company, followed by a merger with King Koil. This strategic move resulted in a substantial expansion of the company's scale and presence.\nIn 1982, the company commenced its franchising operations, and by April 1990, it had established 175 franchisees operating in 22 states across the United States.\nIn 2015, King Koil Licensing Company was acquired by Kaiserkorp Corp, its licensee from Malaysia. In May 2016, Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor (KPS) acquired a 60% stake in King Koil for US$28.8&nbsp;million, while Kaiserkorp Corp retained the remaining 40% of the stake.\nIn December 2019, the company shifted its U.S. headquarters from Willowbrook, Illinois, to Avondale, Arizona, where its manufacturing plant had been in operation since May 2018.\nIn 2024, King Koil was acquired by AI Dream, a licensing division of Hillhouse Investment Management.\nOperations\nThe company shifted to a licensing model. As of 2019, it has over 30 licensees and is operating in more than 90 countries.\nKing Koil ventured into the United Arab Emirates in 1993, collaborating with its licensee, Dubai Furniture Manufacturing Company (DFMC), which became the first licensee in the Middle East, and now it operates 15 King Koil showrooms in the UAE.\nIn September 2006, King Koil signed a licensing agreement with Askona to manufacture and market mattresses in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.\nKing Koil began its foray into the Chinese market in 2000 through a licensing agreement with King Koil Shanghai Sleep System Co., Ltd. In August 2014, CITIC Capital, a private equity firm, secured a controlling stake in the company. Subsequently, in November 2016, Advent International acquired a majority stake in King Koil China.\nAfter being acquired by Kaiserkorp Corp in 2015, King Koil returned to its role as a direct manufacturer in the United States. The Avondale facility of King Koil serves 17 states, such as Arizona, Arkansas, Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.
