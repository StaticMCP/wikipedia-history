Chartered in 1837 as Muskingum College, the institution is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). New Concord is located in far eastern Muskingum County, which derives its name from the Muskingum River. It offers more than 60 undergraduate majors and graduate programs and enrolled 2,100 students in 2023. Muskingum's campus consists of 21 buildings, a football stadium, and a small lake which all sit atop  of rolling hills overlooking New Concord. Alumni are referred to as the \"Long Magenta Line\" and students are known simply as \"Muskies\", while its athletic teams are called the \"Fighting Muskies\".\nHistory\nIn 1827, the National Road (now US 40) was laid through what is now New Concord, roughly following what had been the primitive roadway known as Zane's Trace. A year later, the village of New Concord was established by Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. On July 9, 1836, the first recorded meeting of the \"Friends of Education\" in New Concord, led by residents Samuel Willson and Benjamin Waddle, was held. A year later, the Ohio General Assembly authorized the creation of a college in New Concord after being petitioned by the \"Friends of Education\" committee. On April 24, 1837, Muskingum College opened. Muskingum became a coeducational institution in 1854. In 1958, the United Presbyterian Church of North America and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America merged by signing a historic agreement in Brown Chapel on Muskingum's campus. In 2001, the school's women's softball team captured the NCAA Division III National Championship, the school's first national title.\nIn 2009, Muskingum College achieved university status to become Muskingum University.\nAcademics\nMuskingum has been continuously accredited by the North Central Association of college and Secondary Schools or one of its successors since 1919. \"The school up on the hill\", as it is sometimes called by locals, offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees at the undergraduate level, and at the graduate level Master of Information Strategy Systems and Technology, Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Arts in Teaching graduate degrees. The university offers 44 academic majors along with a large number of minors, nine pre-professional programs (including pre-law and pre-medicine) and teaching licensure.\nCampus\nMost of Muskingum's academic buildings are clustered around a traditional quad near the southern part of the campus.
