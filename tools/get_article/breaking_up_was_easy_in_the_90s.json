It was released on October 12, 2020 as the fifth single from his second studio album Southside. Hunt wrote the song with Zach Crowell, Chris LaCorte, Ernest Keith Smith and Josh Osborne, and produced by Zach Crowell.\nBackground\nThe song suggests that it was easier to cope with the end of a relationship before the existence of social media. Hunt said about the song: \"The trick was not filling it up with a bunch of technology references and trying to find the story within it. It's just the world's so much smaller now. In a lot of ways, like the fact that I can release the record and still stay in touch with my fans, there's so many positives. But when it comes to relationships and navigating old relationships or new relationships and especially breakups, it can be tricky\".\nMusic video\nThe video was released on November 25, 2020, directed by Justin Clough. It is a story of a man who was just released from prison. As he tries to get his life back on track, the man finds himself haunted by memories of a past girlfriend.\nLive performance\nHunt performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Breaking Up Was Easy in the 90s\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020–2021)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia Country Hot 50 (TMN)\n| 11\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for \"Breaking Up Was Easy in the 90s\"\n!
