These ancient texts feature inscriptions in Sanskrit, with some expressions in Prakrit, indicating Sanskrit's dominance during that period.  Circular seal with a relief figure of a swan (though each ruler may have had their own symbol) and Ratification of gifts made by Prabhu Naga Bhogikamatya for spiritual salvation. Interestingly, other rulers, like Ashankit, had different symbols - his was an elephant, as seen on three copper plates. Devaraja is credited with establishing a well-organized administrative system, which facilitated trade, commerce, and cultural exchange. He also patronized Hinduism and encouraged the construction of temples and other public works.\nThe earliest recorded Bhoja ruler in Goa, King Devaraj, is mentioned in a 3rd- or 4th-century AD inscription found in South Goa. This southern Brahmi script plate, issued from Chandrapur, grants tolls and land to Brahmins Govindswami and Indraswami. The Bhoja rulers of Chandrapur controlled areas beyond Goa's west coast, with records of grants found in Ponda taluka and surrounding Konkan regions.\nThe Chalukya period began with Pulakesi II (AD 610). Following Dantidurga's establishment of the Rashtrakuta dynasty (AD 753), the Chalukyas became feudatories, remaining so until AD 980. Later, the Silaharas and Kadambas also became Rashtrakuta feudatories.\nSuccessors and Decline\nDevaraja was succeeded by Asankita who continued to rule over the Bhoja kingdom for several centuries. However, the dynasty declined in the 6th century CE, eventually giving way to other ruling powers.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*"
