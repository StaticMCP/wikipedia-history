He taught art at his alma mater, the University of Utah, from 1957 to 1991, and he was the dean of its College of Fine Arts from 1964 to 1981. He painted watercolors. According to Utah Art, Utah Artists: 150 Year Survey, \"His paintings are representational but contemporary in that the colors are modified and intensified, as is the light and shade, and space is used in an arbitrary way. The subject matter is stylized freely to enhance the abstract quality of the work.\"\nEarly life and education\nEdward Deloy Maryon was born on April 5, 1931, to Edward Baker and Helen Sorenson Maryon. He had two sisters, Joyleen (born July 5, 1933) and Gaylo. Edward Baker Maryon, born in Idaho in 1897, had worked for the Utah tax and road commissions and spent two years as a secretary to Governor Herbert B. Maw, then served from 1950 to 1975 as the Salt Lake City tree warden (renamed forester in 1963). Helen Maryon had been born in 1905 in Bingham Canyon, Utah, to Lafayette and Annie C. Warnick Sorenson, and worked as a bookkeeper until marrying in 1927. Edward Baker's father, Percy Walter Maryon, had been born in Devonshire in 1874 and immigrated to the United States in 1889; he married Mamie Cameron of Falls City, Nebraska, in 1902. They moved to Utah sometime around 1908, and Percy Maryon naturalized there in 1913.\nEd Maryon, who sometimes went by his middle name Deloy while young, grew up in neighborhoods around Liberty Park in Salt Lake City. He went to public schools there. This included Hamilton School for elementary, and East High School; he edited the yearbook there, winning an award for the Eastonian, and graduated on June 2, 1948.\nUndergraduate studies\nThe same year he graduated from high school, Maryon matriculated at the University of Utah. Maryon became a part of the university's School of Fine Arts, and studied under instructors including Joseph Hirsch, LeConte Stewart (a mentor to Maryon), Alvin Gittins, George S. Dibble, and Arnold Friberg. These teachers, along with Maryon's later colleague Doug Snow, were among those Maryon would go on to credit as most influencing his own work and teaching.\nDuring his four years at the university, Maryon was active in many organizations. As a freshman, Maryon was part of the Junior Prom Committee and Associated Students of the University of Utah (ASUU) Art Committee, and Division Editor for the university's yearbook, the Utonian. During end-of-term honors he was awarded a sweater for his involvement in student activities. As a sophomore, he was a member of the Centennial Prom Committee and the ASUU Art Committee, an editor for the Frosh Handbook, and again Division Editor for the Utonian—a post that turned into that of head editor for Maryon's junior year. At the end of his junior year Maryon ran for senior class president, losing to Thomas E. Robinson. As a senior, he was a member of the Student Affairs committee, and again edited the Frosh Handbook; he designed the metal link that, during commencement ceremonies, was added to a chain representing the long line of graduating classes. Maryon was also a four-year member of Sigma Chi. The page for the Utonian itself termed Maryon a \"perennial Sig sweetheart\", and stated that he \"has a faithful sense of humor and gets a bang out of Homecoming\".}}\nMaryon's active participation in student life led to his being one of eight named to Skull an Bones as a junior, and, as a senior, one of nine named to Owl and Key and one of an equal number named to Beehive. Skull and Bones honored junior men who were outstanding in student activities; similarly, Owl and Key consisted of senior men who had been active in student affairs, and who strove to promote class spirit and uphold university traditions. Beehive, proclaimed the \"highest honorary at the University of Utah\", consisted of those who had contributed greatly to campus life. Maryon graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in June 1952.\nMilitary service\nAfter graduation, Maryon worked in advertising for the annual Summer Festival, then was drafted into the Army and sent to basic training at Fort Ord in California. \"During basic training he kept his pencil and pad handy\", the Deseret News reported, and had at least one drawing published in the paper. Maryon's unit was scheduled to ship out to Korea; the day before it did so, however, Maryon was assigned to work as an illustrator in the Army Language School's Reproductions and Publications section at the Presidio of Monterey. Maryon designed posters there alongside other drafting and art work.\nThe assignment to the Presidio, which a later biography termed \"fortunate\", left open Maryon's evenings and weekends—time he would devote to his art. The Deseret News reported that he spent his spare time sketching, particularly by the wharf, along the coast, or through his barracks window, and filled multiple sketchbooks with felt-pencil and watercolor drawings. During this time, Maryon's former instructor Dibble wrote while reviewing a 1983 show of Maryon's watercolors, Maryon's work \"flowered\"; it also presaged a lifetime focus on waterfront scenes.\nGraduate studies\nIn 1954, after two years in the Army and with a portfolio of artworks under his arm, Maryon returned to the University of Utah to pursue a Master of Fine Arts. His instructors there included Harry Leith-Ross, Francis de Erdely, Howard Bradford, and Joseph Hirsch. Maryon wrote his thesis on Portrait in Oil, and graduated in August 1956.\nCareer\nGraphic design\nFollowing graduate school, Maryon worked alongside Ralph Reynolds at David W. Evans Inc., where he was a designer, illustrator, and graphic artist. Maryon would do occasional graphic design into the 1960s, even after entering academia. This included for The Improvement Era, the official magazine of the Mormon Church. By the November 1957 issue, Maryon was listed as an art director alongside Reynolds; Maryon's drawing for the August 1960 cover, depicting covered wagons along the Mormon Trail, received a first-place award from the Utah Advertising Artists Association; he also drew the cover for the March 1963 issue, and had a 1966 illustration recognized by Dibble as among \"outstanding examples of journalistic art\".\nUniversity of Utah\nShortly after Maryon's graduation from his masters program, his mentor Stewart suggested that Maryon apply to teach at the University of Utah's Department of Painting; Maryon did so, and in 1956 became an instructor in basic drawing there. In addition to instruction, Maryon was involved in and oversaw exhibitions during this time, served as a judge for exhibitions and competitions, gave talks, and served on a committee to select artwork to furnish the Salt Lake City Public Library's new central location. In 1961 Maryon was promoted to assistant professor, and the following year the Departments of Art and Sculpture merged into one, with Maryon named chairman of the surviving Department of Art.\nOn October 14, 1963, Maryon was appointed assistant dean of the College of Fine Arts. Early in his tenure, he was thrust into a school controversy when the Board of Regents ordered the university to remove paintings, including impressionistic landscapes and nudes, by three artists from a student art exhibit. Maryon decried the decision in a letter as \"arbitrary\" and \"handed down without any reasonable attempt to solve the problem\", and stated that there must be \"a clear understanding of what [the] exhibition policy is to be\". The paintings, he added, were \"of unimpeachable character\", and from artists who had all won \"top honors\" in competitions and exhibits.\nMaryon was named acting dean on May 18, 1964 (effective July 1), and in March 1966 (effective July 1), Maryon's acting deanship became permanent; he held the position until 1981. During Maryon's deanship, the university built the Arts and Architecture Center as a replacement for the G.I. barracks that had previously housed the department, and expanded the Utah Museum of Fine Arts from a small gallery into a major museum. The university also expanded its focus on dance, forming the Departments of Ballet and Modern Dance, creating Ballet West (a successor to the University Theatre Ballet), and helping to found the Repertory Dance Theatre, where he served on the board. As he had in his pre-administrative days, too, Maryon continued to organize and judge exhibitions, give talks, attend conferences, and preside over events.\nMaryon led students on a number of trips throughout his time at the university. Most enduringly, starting in June 1970 and lasting for 30 years, he took students to spend a week in Monterey; they would paint along the Monterey Peninsula, and receive teaching and critiques from Maryon. Harrison T. Groutage and Snow later participated in the program as well. Even before the Monterey program became established, however, Maryon led students on trips. These included a trip to the San Francisco Bay to visit galleries and sketch with the university's Art Club over the 1959–60 winter break, and a two-month cultural trip to Europe in the summer of 1962.\nPersonal life\nMaryon married Patricia Bushman on August 3, 1953, while on leave from the Army Language School. They had eight children: Ann (born August 9, 1955), Ed (born November 2, 1956,), Beth (born October 1958), Daniel Christian (born September 14, 1959,), Don (born May 22, 1962.), Kris, Robin, and Jane (two of whom were born in June 1968 and October 1970). The couple divorced in 1981. In 1985, Maryon married Judy Kurtz. He kept his studio on a piece of property that he purchased from his stepson, Ken Kurtz.\nMaryon was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and served in the high council for the University West Stake. In the 1960s, Maryon served as bishop of a student ward in the University Stake. He was a member of the Board of Editors for Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought when it was conceived in 1965, and the same year helped prepare a brochure commemorating the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood. In 1964, Maryon was one of many professors at the University of Utah to endorse Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert Humphrey in the presidential election.\nIn August 1951, Maryon served as best man at the wedding of Wallace Vernon Jenkins and Anna Lou Dinwoodey; Jenkins was two years above Maryon at university, and also a member of Sigma Chi and Owl and Key. Maryon also ushered at the September 1958 wedding of his sister Gaylo Maryon.\nMaryon died on March 9, 2005, aged 73, in Salt Lake City, of Parkinson's disease.\nExhibitions\n* Before August 1956: Springville Art Show\n* February 1955: Exhibition of alumni art at the university's Park Building.
