The NAADM program was authorized by the Canada-United States Memorandum of Understanding signed by Prime Minister Mulroney and President Reagan at the summit.  The purpose of the upgraded facilities at Rankin Inlet Airport was to accommodate up to six fighters in hangars when needed, 200 support personnel, and storage facilities.   The facility was built and accepted by DND in 1994, without munitions storage facilities.\nFOL Rankin Inlet is located immediately southwest of the Rankin Inlet Airport.  As part of the airport upgrades needed during the construction of the FOL, a layer of insulation was placed under the paved surfaces to better protect the permafrost layer beneath them.  Apron II / Taxiway B serves the FOL's operation.\nIn 2005 the Government of Nunavut was reported to have been pursuing acquiring use of the support buildings at FOL Rankin Inlet for trades educational programs, but in 2006 it was announced that plan had been scrapped since the school would have short notice to vacate the building in case the military needed the premises back.\nReferences"
