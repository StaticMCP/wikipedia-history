At the same time, vernacular literatures ranging from Provençal to Icelandic embodied in lyric and romance the values and worldview of an increasingly self-conscious and prosperous courtly aristocracy. These two trends contributed to a sweeping revival of letters with a lasting influence on the development of literature in the following centuries.\nEvents\n*1104: September 3 &ndash;  St. Cuthbert is reburied in Durham Cathedral (England) and the St. Cuthbert Gospel of St. John removed from his tomb.\n*1170: Poet, politician and historian Lu You (陸游) travels on the Grand Canal (China) from Shaoxing to the river Yangtze, recording his progress in a diary.\n*Before 1173: Copenhagen Psalter produced in northern England\n*1170: 29 December &ndash; Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket is assassinated in Canterbury Cathedral, an event that inspires several plays, notably: Alfred, Lord Tennyson's Becket (1884), T. S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral (1935), Jean Anouilh's Becket (''Becket, ou l'honneur de Dieu'', 1959) and Paul Webb's Four Nights in Knaresborough (1999). It also features in novels such as Conrad Ferdinand Meyer's Der Heilige (\"The Saint\", 1879), Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth (1989) and Sharon Kay Penman's Time and Chance (2002).\n*: The university and its libraries at Nalanda in India are sacked and burned by Turkic invader Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji; the burning of the library is said to have continued for several months.\nHistories\n*Early 12th century\n**Gesta Francorum\n**\n**Liber Eliensis by monks of Ely Abbey\n*By 1106  by monks of Clonmacnoise\n*1108 Dei gesta per Francos by Guibert of Nogent\n*–18  by 'Gallus Anonymus'\n* Primary Chronicle (, ''Povest' Vremyan'nykh Let', Tale of Bygone Years or Chronicle of Nestor)\n*–40 Annals of St Neots by monks of Bury St Edmunds\n*1122–54 Peterborough Chronicle\n*–50 Historia Hierosolymitanae expeditionis by Albert of Aix\n*–39 Estoire des Engleis by Geoffrey Gaimar\n*  by Geoffrey of Monmouth\n*From 1137 Vita Ludovici regis by Abbot Suger and Historia gloriosi regis Ludovici by Suger and others\n*Concludes 1140 Chronicon ex chronicis by John of Worcester\n*c. 1140 Chronicon Roskildense\n*1145 Samguk Sagi (삼국사기, History of the Three Kingdoms) by Kim Pusik and others\n*Concludes 1146 Chronica de duabus civitatibus by Otto of Freising\n*–50  transcribed by Brother Marcus\n*–55 Roman de Brut by Wace\n*Concludes 1152 Gesta Friderici Imperatoris Book 1 by Otto of Freising\n*1153–54 Relatio de Standardo (Account of the Standard, or De bello standardii, On the Battle of the Standard) by Aelred of Rievaulx\n*1154 Historia Anglorum by Henry of Huntingdon (fifth and last book completed)\n*–84  by monks of Santa Maria de Ripoll\n*\n*1170–84 Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum by William of Tyre\n*c.1168–69 Chronica Slavorum by Helmold of Bosau\n*By 1177 Unum ex quatuor (gospel harmony with commentary) by Clement of Llanthony\n*–1208  by Saxo Grammaticus\n* Witherlogh by Sven Aggesen\n*  by Joseph of Exeter\n* Historia brevis regum Dacie by Sven Aggesen\n*1188 Topographia Hibernica (\"Topography of Ireland\") by Gerald of Wales\n*1190s Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja\n*–1215 Brut by Layamon\n*1192 Chronicon de rebus gestis Ricardi Primi by Richard of Devizes\n*  (On the education of a prince) by Gerald of Wales\nPhilosophy/theology\n*Early 12th century Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible\n* Theologia 'Summi Boni' by Peter Abelard\n*  by Peter Abelard\n*–42 Historia Ecclesiastica by Orderic Vitalis\n* Speculum caritatis (The Mirror of Charity) by Aelred of Rievaulx\n*1150 Skara Missal\n*\n** by Ibn Tufail\n**The Four Books of Sentences (Libri Quattuor Sententiarum) by Peter Lombard\n**De tribus in paenitentia consideranda and Unum ex quatuor by Clement of Llanthony\n*Mid-12th century Unum ex quatuor by Clement of Llanthony (translation into Middle English: Oon of Foure)\n*–64 Liber viarum Dei by Elisabeth of Schönau\n*\n**De institutione inclusarum by Aelred of Rievaulx\n**Policraticus by John of Salisbury\n*1163?
