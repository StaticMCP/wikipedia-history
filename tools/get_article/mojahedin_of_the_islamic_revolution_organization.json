The groups were:\n*\"United Ummah\" (; Ommat-e-Vahede)\n*\"Monotheistic Badr\" (; Towhidiye-Badr)\n*\"Monotheistic Queue\" (; Towhidiye-Saff)\n*\"Peasant\" (; Fallah)\n*\"Daybreak\" (: Falaq)\n*\"Victors\" (; Mansouroun)\n*\"Monotheists\" (; Movahedin)\nDissolution\nThe organization dissolved in 1986 as a result of tensions between the leftist and rightist members.\nLegacy\nLeft-wing members of the organization decided to resume activities in 1991 and established leftist Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran Organization (adding the words “of Iran” to the name) which later emerged as a reformist party. Some right-wing members founded Society of Devotees of the Islamic Revolution in late-1990s.\nNotable members\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Original group\n!Faction\n!Later career\n!Ref\n|-\n|Behzad Nabavi||Ommat-e-Vahedeh||Left||Politics||\n|-\n|Mohammad Salamati||Ommat-e-Vahedeh||Left||Politics||\n|-\n|Sadegh Norouzi||Ommat-e-Vahedeh||Left||Politics||\n|-\n|Mohsen Makhmalbaf||Ommat-e-Vahedeh||Left||Cinema||\n|-\n|Abdulali Ali-Asgari||||Right||Media||\n|-\n|Ahmad Tavakoli||||Right||Politics||\n|-\n|Alireza Afshar||||Right||Military → Politics||\n|-\n|Abbas Duzduzani||||Left||Military → Politics\n|-\n|Hashem Aghajari||||Left||Academia||\n|-\n|Feyzollah Arabsorkhi||Ommat-e-Vahedeh||Left||Politics||\n|-\n|Abdollah Nasseri|| ||Left||Media||\n|-\n|Hossein Fadaei||Towhidiye-Badr||Right||Military → Politics||\n|-\n|Safar Naeimi||Towhidiye-Badr||Right||Military → Politics||\n|-\n|Mohammad Boroujerdi||Towhidiye-Saff|| ||Military||\n|-\n|Mojtaba Shakeri||Towhidiye-Saff||Right||Military → Politics||\n|-\n|Mohsen Armin||Towhidiye-Saff||Left||Politics||\n|-\n|Morteza Alviri||Fallah||Left||Politics||\n|-\n|Mostafa Tajzadeh||Falaq||Left||Politics||\n|-\n|Mohsen Rezaee||Mansouroun||Right||Military → Politics||\n|-\n|Ali Shamkhani||Mansouroun||Left||Military||\n|-\n|Hossein Nejat||Mansouroun||Right||Military||\n|-\n|Esmaeil Daghayeghi||Mansouroun|| ||Military||\n|-\n|Mohammad Bagher Zolghadr||Mansouroun||Right||Military → Politics||\n|-\n|Gholam Ali Rashid||Mansouroun||Right||Military||\n|-\n|Hosein Alamolhoda||Movahedin|| ||Military||\n|}\nEndnotes\nReferences"
