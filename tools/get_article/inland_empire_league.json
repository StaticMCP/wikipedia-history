The four–team Inland Empire League consisted of teams based in Oregon and Washington, with the same four cities hosting teams in both seasons. The Inland Empire League permanently folded during the 1908 season.\nHistory\nThe four Inland Empire League host cities first formed together in the Pacific Interstate League of 1891. The Independent level league comprised the Baker Bunch Grassers, La Grande Grand Rhonders, Pendleton Ho Hos and Walla Walla Walla Wallas.\nThe Inland Empire League began play in the 1902 season as a Class D level four–team league, with the Baker City Gold Diggers, La Grande Beetpullers, Pendleton Indians and Walla Walla Sharpshooters as charter members. The complete 1902 league standings and statistics are unknown. A game report noted Walla Walla defeated Baker 2–0 on July 25, 1902, in front of 300 fans at Baker. Another game report has Pendleton defeating La Grande 2–0 and Walla Walla defeating Baker 6–0 on August 25, 1902. It was also reported that the 1902 league folded a before the end of the scheduled season.\nThe team records on August 25, 1902 were reported to be: Pendleton 21–8, Walla Walla 14–15, La Grande 12–16 and Baker City 10–18.\nAfter the 1902 league ended, it was reported some of the Inland Empire League players created a barnstorming team. Called the \"Mormons\" and based out of Salt Lake City, Utah, the team played games in Lincoln, Nebraska, where some of the players were signed by the Atlantic team from Atlantic, Iowa.\nThe Inland Empire League formed again in 1908, under the direction of league president W.L. Thompson, with the same four cities hosting franchises. The Baker Nuggets/Miners, La Grande Babes, Pendleton Pets/Wheat Growers and Walla Walla Walla Wallas began league play on June 10, 1908. However, the league permanently disbanded on Sunday, July 12, 1908 due to extreme heat.\nAt the time the league folded in 1908, the La Grande Babes, with a 19–12 record under manager O'Brien, were in first place, 2.5 games ahead of the second place Baker Nuggets/Miners, who finished with a record of 15–15. They were followed by the Walla Walla Walla Wallas (14–17) and Pendleton Pets/Wheat Growers (14–18) in the final standings. The Inland league did not return to play after the 1908 season.\nInland Empire League teams\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Team name\n!City represented\n!Ballpark\n!Year(s) active\n|-\n|Baker City Gold Diggers (1902)Baker Nuggets/Miners (1908)\n|Baker City, Oregon\n|Unknown\n|,\n|-\n|La Grande Beetpullers (1902)La Grande Babes (1908)\n|La Grande, Oregon\n|Unknown\n|,\n|-\n|Pendleton Indians (1902)Pendleton Pets/Wheat Growers (1908)\n|Pendleton, Oregon\n|Round-Up Park\n|,\n|-\n|Walla Walla Sharpshooters (1902)Walla Walla Walla Wallas (1908)\n|Walla Walla, Washington\n|Unknown\n|,\n|-\n|}\nInland Empire League standings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1902 Inland Empire League\n!Team standings!!W!!L!!PCT!!GB!!
