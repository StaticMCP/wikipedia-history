It  exhibits a royal collection of\nsculptures, natural stone figures and plaster models.\nThe museum is situated in the 400 year old brewhouse of King Christian IV.\nDuring the years leading up to 2013, the Board of the Palace and Culture Agency (Styrelsen for Slotte & Kulturejendomme), with the support of TrygFonden, implemented a fire protection of the 8,000-storey square meter brew house, to enable the building to be opened to the public. Lapidarium was officially opened on June 3, 2014.\nThe collection consists of 300 statues, sculptures and ornamentation in different materials gathered from royal gardens, palaces and buildings. Among the treasures are a model of the equestrian statue of King Frederick V at Amalienborg, and the original equestrian statue of Christian V at Kongens Nytorv.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://kongeligeslotte.dk/en/palaces-and-gardens/the-lapidarium-of-kings/explore-the-lapidarium-of-kings.html Explore The Lapidarium of Kings] at kongeligeslotte.dk"
