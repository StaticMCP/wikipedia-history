Moldavia supported Russia in its war against the Ottomans with troops and by allowing the Russian army to cross its territory and to place garrisons in Moldavian fortresses. The Moldavians were represented by the Metropolitan of Moldavia Ghedeon. The text of the treaty was elaborated entirely by Moldavian Hospodar Dimitrie Cantemir, who asked for Moldavia to be put under the protection of Russia in exchange for support in the war against the Ottomans.\nTerms\nIn the preamble and in Article I, Dimitrie Cantemir worships the tsar, receiving in return protection from Peter I for himself and for all the people of Moldavia. It is provided that the lord of Moldavia \"with all the great boyars and her nobles and with the inhabitants of any state of the glorious Moldavian people\" should henceforth be under the protection of the tsar and will take an oath of obedience at first in secret, until at the entry of the Russian armies into the principality and then, the voivode will carry his faith secretly \"by correspondence and other means\".\nArticle II makes the lord of Moldavia join the army of the Russian army.\nArticles III to V provide that the heirs of the Russian throne do not have the right to rule in Moldavia or in the Wallachian land. In Moldavia, the reign is to be hereditary in the Cantemir family.\nArticle VI provides, \"According to the old Moldovan custom, all power should be with the lord\". The tsar cannot interfere in the internal affairs of Moldavia.\nArticle XI provides that the borders of the principality, according to its ancient rights, are those described with the Dniester River, Camenețu, Bender, with all of Budjak, Danube, Muntenia, the Grand Duchy of Transylvania and Poland.\nAccording to Articles XII to  XV, Russian protection over Moldavia is to be maintained after the conclusion of the peace in the sense that Peter is not to leave Moldavia under the domination of the Gate.\nArticles XVI and XVII contain the oaths of Peter I and Dimitrie Cantemir.\nLinks\n* [http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/Tratatul_de_la_Lu%C5%A3k Enciclopedia României — Tratatul de la Lutsk]\nReferences"
