He is known for his involvement in ecumenical organizations domestically and internationally and in international affairs, especially within the Middle East and Southern Africa. He is the son of the late Laura Turner Howard and the late Moses William Howard, Sr. He attended public schools in Americus before enrolling in Morehouse College, where he graduated in 1968. He earned a Master of Divinity degree at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1972. His worldview was shaped initially in response to the racial segregation he experienced in his hometown, where he participated in voter registration drives in the early 1960s. He studied Philosophy and Psychology at Morehouse and was heavily influenced by Professors Samuel Woodrow Williams and Lucius M. Tobin (https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/lucius-m-tobin-charles-e-batten). His principal academic advisor at Princeton was Professor Edward Jabra Jurgi.\nCareer\nAfter Princeton, Howard joined the national staff of the Reformed Church in America (RCA) in 1972, where he remained until assuming the presidency of New York Theological Seminary (NYTS) in 1992. During his tenure at the RCA, he served as an Advisor to the 5th Assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC) in Nairobi, Kenya and as Moderator of the WCC's Programme to Combat Racism (1976–78). In 1978, at age 32 he was elected the youngest president of the National Council of Churches, and in that capacity at Christmas in 1979, he journeyed with Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit, and the Reverend William Sloane Coffin, Senior Minister of The Riverside Church, to conduct Christmas services for the U.S. personnel being held hostage Iran.

This is Dr. Howard's account of how the Reformed Church in America responded to the Black Manifesto and its demand for reparations to African Americans for slavery and subsequent oppression.\nIn 2022, Howard joined with other residents of his community in demonstrating how a diverse community can live together, employing values of justice, fair play and mutual respect. They have led the community in conversations related to reparations for the enslavement of Africans in America; protecting public schools from efforts to limit instruction in the history and culture of diverse populations; affordable housing; opposition to book banning; gun safety; the Township’s Master Plan; treatment of local students with different sexual orientation; and recognition of African American history in the region, all topics deemed vital to engagement of the kind that strengthens community.\nInternational engagements\nFor most of the 1970s and 1980s, Howard played a role in the movement for freedom from colonialism and white minority rule in Southern Africa (Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa) and the former Portuguese colonies. From 1975 until 1990, the year of Nelson Mandela's release from prison, Howard was denied visas to enter the Republic of South Africa by the apartheid government. During this period, he chaired the Board of the American Committee on Africa; he presided at the United Nations-sponsored North American Regional Conference for Action Against Apartheid in 1984, and the 1981 United Nations Seminar on Bank Loans to South Africa in Zurich, Switzerland.

Henderson, a New Jersey businessman and Commissioner of the Port Authority of NY/NJ, Howard founded Management Futures, an initiative that provided internships to black South Africans in fields from which they had been excluded under the Job Reservations Act.\nHoward led the first post-revolution, American church delegation to the Christian Council of Cuba in 1977 and the first such delegation to the churches of the People's Republic of China after the Cultural Revolution.
