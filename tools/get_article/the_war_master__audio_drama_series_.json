It sees the return of Sir Derek Jacobi as the Master, a role he previously portrayed in the TV story \"Utopia\". The first volume consists of a four-CD box set; it was released in December 2017. In July 2018, a further 3 series were confirmed for release between December 2018 – December 2019.\nIn January 2019, Paul McGann was confirmed as an appearance within the third series, Rage of the Time Lords, as the Eighth Doctor alongside Jacobi. Seán Carlsen reprised his role as Narvin from the Gallifrey series alongside Pippa Bennett-Warner and Nicholas Briggs as Livia and the Daleks.\nThe series was created by Scott Handcock, who is the producer of the range as well as director and script-editor for sets released between 2017 and 2024. It was announced that he will be succeeded by Robert Valentine, after Handcock became a script editor for future series of Doctor Who on screen.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"11\" | Appearances\n|-\n!
