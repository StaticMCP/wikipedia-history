The largest part of sites dates to the late 5th and early 6th century AD according to Late Roman iron fibulae. Settlements were as a rule placed at rivers, near water sources, and were typically unfortified, with 8–20 households with courtyards. Burial sites were both flat graves and barrows (kurgans), and cremation was dominant.\nSlavic archaeologists including M. Kazanski identified the 6th-century Prague (Prague-Korchak) culture and Sukow-Dziedzice group as Sclaveni archaeological cultures, and the Penkovka culture (Prague-Penkovka) was identified as Antes.\nSee also\n*Korchak culture\n*Penkovka culture\n*Ipotesti-Candesti culture\n*Kolochin culture\n*Sukow-Dziedzice group\n*Sclaveni\n*Antes people\n*Early Slavs\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
