Ten personnel of the Border Security Force, three officers and seven senior technicians, were killed. The 22-year-old Beechcraft B200 King Air took off for Ranchi just before 9.30am, before crashing shortly afterwards.\nAircraft\nThe aircraft involved in the accident was a 22-year-old Beechcraft B200 King Air.\nPassengers and crew\nThe plane has two pilots, each with a commercial pilot licence.\nIn addition to the pilots, the plane was carrying eight technicians to Ranchi to repair a helicopter.\nAccident\nAfter the aircraft's engines were started the crew reported that there was a problem (the nature of which has not been reported), but continued with the flight after receiving advice from ground staff. The aircraft took off at 9:27am local time with an expected arrival time at Ranchi of 12:00pm.\nSoon after taking off, the crew informed air traffic control that something was wrong and that they would return to Delhi. The pilots were then cleared to make an emergency landing on Delhi's Runway 28. At 9:40 AM, contact was lost with the aircraft. The plane then veered to the left, narrowly missing a village. It brushed a tree before hitting the perimeter wall of the airport and crashed into a sewage treatment plant within the airport complex. The aircraft then caught fire and was destroyed. All ten occupants were killed and another on the ground was injured.\nCause\nThe cause can be attributed to pilot error who incorrectly activated the autopilot and failed to take the proper corrective action. Five recommendations are also made.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://reports.aviation-safety.net/2015/20151222-0_BE20_VT-BSA.pdf Final report of the accident]\n*"
