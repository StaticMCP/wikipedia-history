They hoped to \"boost the state's profile among the campaigns and energize the party.\" In spite of this change, only one presidential candidate actually visited Montana, Mitt Romney in June 2007. McCain, Romney, Huckabee and Paul each orchestrated last-minute conference calls with voters at caucus sites.\nEndorsements\nFormer Senator Conrad Burns endorsed McCain. Secretary of State Brad Johnson endorsed Romney. Former Governor Judy Martz endorsed Huckabee.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+100% of precincts reporting\n|-\n!
