Now in its tenth year, the event honours the achievements of the individuals and teams that work across the cancer research sector to lessen the impact of cancer for the people of NSW.\nThese awards are an opportunity to honour the state's outstanding cancer researchers whose brilliant minds together with their commitment to years and even decades of focused work have led to new discoveries about cancer diagnoses, treatments and survival. Their achievements reflect that improving cancer outcomes is a series of incremental steps.\nAs the NSW Government's cancer control agency, the Cancer Institute NSW supports, facilitates and collaborates with all in the cancer control sector to translate new discoveries in to meaningful knowledge to improve the health system of NSW. This new information is providing the evidence we need to drive rapid improvement in cancer prevention, treatment, care and ultimately, survival outcomes.\nPast award nights\n[https://www.cancerinstitute.org.au/about-us/events/premiers-research-awards/previous-winners#winners2011 2011 Cancer Research Awards]\n[https://www.cancerinstitute.org.au/about-us/events/premiers-research-awards/previous-winners#winners2012 2012 Cancer Research Awards]\n[https://www.cancerinstitute.org.au/about-us/events/premiers-research-awards/previous-winners#winners2013 2013 Cancer Research Awards]\n[https://www.cancerinstitute.org.au/about-us/events/premiers-research-awards/previous-winners#winners2014 2014 Cancer Research Awards]\n[https://www.cancerinstitute.org.au/about-us/events/premiers-research-awards/past-awards 2015 Cancer Research Awards]\n2016 awards\n*   Outstanding Cancer Researcher of the Year – Professor John Simes\n*   The Professor Rob Sutherland AO Make a Difference Award – Professor Minoti Apte\n*   Outstanding Cancer Research Fellow – Dr Zaklina Kovacevic\n*   The 'Rising Star' PhD Student Award  – Dr Andrew Chen\n*   Big Data, Big Impact – Associate Professor Daniel Catchpoole and Team, Sydney Children's Hospital Network\n*   Excellence in Translation Cancer Research – Dr Natalie Taylor and Team, Australian Institute of Health Innovation Behaviour Change Research Stream\n*   The 'Wildfire' Highly Cited Publication Award – Dr James Wilmott\n*   Innovation in Cancer Clinical Trials – Central Coast Local Health District\n2017 awards\n*   Outstanding Cancer Researcher of the Year – Professor Richard Kefford\n*   The Professor Rob Sutherland AO Make a Difference Award – Professor David Goldstein\n*   Outstanding Cancer Research Fellow – Dr Marina Pajic\n*   The 'Rising Star' PhD Student Award  – Rebecca Poulos\n*   Big Data, Big Impact – no award\n*   Excellence in Translational Cancer Research – Professor Richard Scolyer and Professor Georgina Long, Melanoma Institute Australia\n*   The 'Wildfire' Highly Cited Publication Award – Professor Helen Rizos, Melanoma Translational Research Team\n*   Outstanding Cancer Clinical Trials Unit Award – Central West Cancer Care Centre\nSee also\n* Cancer Institute NSW\n* List of medicine awards\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cancerinstitute.org.au/ Cancer Institute NSW]"
