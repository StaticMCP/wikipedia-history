They operated services in South East Queensland including suburban trains in Brisbane.\nIn 1996, four were sold to Tranz Rail in New Zealand. After rebuilding at Hutt Workshops, they were placed in service with the Australian Transport Network in Tasmania as the DQ2000 class.\nAll had been withdrawn by 1999. In 2002, six were overhauled and fitted with  bogies from FreightCorp 49 class locomotives for use by Interail in New South Wales as the 423 class.\nIn 2005, seven have been exported to Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia, Chile. In 2006, two were rebuilt and transferred to Australian Railroad Group for use in Western Australia as the AD class.\nClass register\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Number\n!
