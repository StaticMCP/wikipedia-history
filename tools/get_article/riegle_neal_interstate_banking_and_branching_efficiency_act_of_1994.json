The goal was the return to a balance between the benefits of a state bank charter versus a federal bank charter. Among other notable changes, the Act stipulated that a federally chartered bank wishing to expand must first undergo a review of its Community Reinvestment Act compliance. Congress approved the bill by September 14, 1994. The bill was signed by Bill Clinton on September 29, 1994.\nExpansion of the Community Reinvestment Act\nThree sections of the IBBEA address and expand the Community Reinvestment Act: Section 107, Section 109, and Section 110. Section 110 amends the Community Reinvestment Act itself to include a new section regarding the method of evaluating the compliance of banks with branches in more than one state.\nEffect\nNewly formed firms used less outside debt financing and invested less, suggesting that greater banking competition increased financial constraints for these firms. These effects diminished and ultimately reversed as firms aged.\nUsage in popular media\n* It was referenced by Chuck McGill in Season 2, Episode 8 (\"Fifi\") of Better Call Saul.\nReferences\nhttps://portal.ct.gov/DOB/Consumer/Consumer-Education/ABCs-of-Banking--Banks-Geographic-Structure"
