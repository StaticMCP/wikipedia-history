Giles, a close friend of one of the founders of the South Australian Company, George Fife Angas, left England for South Australia on the ship Hartley sixteen months later, in June 1837. He was accompanied by his new (and pregnant) second wife, Emily Elizabeth (née McGeorge) (c. 1814 – 5 August 1876) and their 1-year-old daughter Emily jnr, together with all nine children from his earlier marriage to Sarah (née Roper).  Emily gave birth to her second child, George Hartley Giles during the voyage.\nThe Hartley was a three-masted vessel measuring 27 x 7 x 5.6 metres built at Sunderland in England in 1836. Her owner and captain was Thomas Fewson.  On 16 October 1837 the Hartley arrived at Kingscote, Kangaroo Island where the Company's first settlement was founded. Once in South Australia, William and Emily had a further ten children. By November 1837, the European population of the new province had reached approximately 2,500. The pre-settlement indigenous population of South Australia is estimated to have been approximately 15,000.\nBusiness life\nShortly after arrival on Kangaroo Island in 1837, Giles, T. H. Beare, and Henry Mildred imported a flock of Merino ewes from Van Diemens Land, some of the first brought into the colony, though stock losses on the unusually long trip aboard the Cygnet were considerable.\nGiles was appointed Stipendiary Magistrate by Governor Hindmarsh in 1838 then appointed as the third colonial manager of the South Australian Company in January 1841, succeeding David McLaren. He continued as manager until 1861, when he retired.\nPolitical life\nGiles stood for the Electoral district of Port Adelaide in the first elected parliament in July 1851, but was narrowly defeated by Captain George Hall.\nHe was elected as member for the District of Yatala for five sessions of the South Australian Legislative Council, from July 1851 until 1854. He was a devout Congregationalist. As a legislator he opposed state aid to religion, as did his close friend, Rev. T. Q. Stow.\nHe died at his home in Beaumont on 11 May 1862.\nFamily life\nWilliam's second daughter, Jane Isabella, described the family's new life, using pseudonyms, in her book \"Family Life in South Australia\", published in 1890.\nA précis of Jane's book was compiled in 2015 including references to the actual family members.\nFamily\nWilliam married twice:\n:* to Sarah Roper (25 November 1791 - 6 October 1833) on 1 November 1813, and\n:* to Emily McGeorge (7 December 1813 – 5 August 1876) on 12 January 1835.\nIn total his two wives had 21 children from 1814 to 1852, resulting in 78 grandchildren.\n;Children with Sarah Roper\n1.
