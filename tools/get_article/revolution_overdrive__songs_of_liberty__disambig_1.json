The album features original and cover songs heard in JoeyRay's bar, a bar in the video game. It is the second soundtrack to the game; the first features the game's original score. A vinyl record version of the soundtrack was originally released for BlizzCon 2010. The dual sided record featured 6 tracks on A-side and 5 on B-side. CD and iTunes LP versions of the album were released later that year. These versions feature an additional 3 tracks, and the iTunes version includes extra features, including the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty trailer, fictional biographies for all the artists on the album (most of which are Blizzard Entertainment house bands), as well as a list of cocktails made in JoeyRays's bar.\nTrack listing\nVinyl version\nA-side\n*\"Jem's Tune\" by Big Tuna\n*\"Suspicious Minds\" by The Bourbon Cowboys\n*\"Zerg, Shotgun, and You\" by Whiteboy James and the Blues Express\n*\"Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (And Loud, Loud Music)\" by Big Tuna\n*\"Raw Power\" by Romeo Delta\n*\"An American Trilogy\" by Brian Bode\nB-side\n*\"Free Bird\" by The Blasters\n*\"Rumble\" by The Dirty Knobs\n*\"Excuse Me for Scribblin'\" by Whiteboy James and the Blues Express\n*\"Sweet Home Alabama\" by Big Tuna\n*\"Terran Up the Night\" by Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain\nAdditional tracks on the CD and iTunes versions\n*\"Most Wanted\" by StarCraft Terran Band\n*\"Blood and Glory\" by StarCraft Terran Band\n*\"Suspicious Minds (Black Label)\" by The Bourbon Cowboys\nReferences"
