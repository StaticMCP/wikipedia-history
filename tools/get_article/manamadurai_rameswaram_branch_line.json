The line starts at Manamadurai and ends at Rameswaram.\nHistory\nThe Madras Railway laid the metre gauge lines viz. Manamadurai–Mandapam line in 1902, Mandapam–Pamban line in 1914, Pamban–Rameswaram line in 1906 and Pamban–Dhanushkodi line in 1908.\nDuring 1964 Rameshwaram Cyclone, the Pamban–Dhanushkodi section was completely damaged and was dismantled afterwards and was never rebuilt by Indian railways. This is because of the declarement of dhanushkodi as \"Abandoned and Unfit for Habitation\" by madras(chennai) government.\nThe Madurai–Manamadurai–Rameshwaram section was entirely converted to broad gauge in 2006.\nFuture\nThere are plans to build a rail-cum-road bridge or tunnel from India to Sri Lanka. It would be built via Rameshwaram or Dhanushkodi.\nFunds has been allocated for the reconstruction of Dhanushkodi Railway Line.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sr.indianrailways.gov.in Southern Railways - Official Website]"
