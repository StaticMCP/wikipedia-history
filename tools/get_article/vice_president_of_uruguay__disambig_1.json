The vice president replaces the elected President in case of death or absence. The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch, president of the Chamber of Senators and the General Assembly.\nThe president and vice president run on a single ticket submitted by their party. A runoff is held between the top two candidates if no candidate obtains the majority of votes (50%+1). In this case, the candidate who receives a plurality in the runoff wins the election. The current Vice President is Carolina Cosse, who took office on March 1, 2025.\nHistory\nThe position of Vice-President of the Republic was established in the Constitution of 1934. Previously, the President of the Senate assumed the Presidency in case of the absence of the President. The Constitution of 1952 established a 9-member executive council, the National Council of Government, abolishing the figure of the Vice President. The Constitution of 1967 eliminated the National Council of Government and resumed the presidential system, maintaining the figure of the Vice President.\nList of vice presidents of Uruguay\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!
