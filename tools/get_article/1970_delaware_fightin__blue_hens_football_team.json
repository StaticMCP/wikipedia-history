Roy Holcomb was the team captain.\nFollowing the decision by the Middle Atlantic Conference to end football competition in its University Division, the Blue Hens competed as a football independent in 1970, though five of the former league rivals (Bucknell, Delaware, Gettysburg, Lafayette and Lehigh) continued to play an informal round-robin called the \"Middle Five\".\nGuard Conway Haymon received first-team honors on the 1970 Little All-America college football team, and running back Chuck Hall received second-team honors.\nThe team played its home games at Delaware Stadium in Newark, Delaware.\nSchedule\n||Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE (rivalry)|W 39-22|17,318|\n|September 19|at|||Musselman Stadium|Gettysburg, PA|W 34-7|4,892|\n|September 26||New Hampshire|5|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 53-12|13,348|\n|October 3||Villanova|4|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE (rivalry)|L 31-34|19,067|\n|October 10||Lafayette|11|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 36-20|17,116|\n|October 17|at|Rutgers|7|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|W 54-21|16,500|\n|October 31|at|Temple|7|Temple Stadium|Philadelphia, PA|W 15-13|14,000|\n|November 7|at|Lehigh|8|Taylor Stadium|Bethlehem, PA (rivalry)|L 13-36|13,000|\n|November 14||Boston University|18|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 51-19|14,949|\n|November 21||Bucknell|16|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 42-0|16,827|\n|December 12|vs||11|Atlantic City Convention Center|Atlantic City, NJ (Boardwalk Bowl)|W 38-23|10,078|\n}}\nReferences"
