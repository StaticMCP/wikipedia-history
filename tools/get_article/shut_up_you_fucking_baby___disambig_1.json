It was nominated for a Grammy for Best Comedy Album in 2003, but lost to \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's Poodle Hat.  The CD was sold brand new with an obi covering the top stating the title as \"Shut Up, You [lift flap for dirty word] Baby!\" to accommodate stores that would object to the full title.  Cross trolled potential buyers of the recording by having the cover deliberately designed to look like it has deep scratches in the cardboard of the Digipak packaging and titling the pieces on it after clichéd stand-up comedy topics, with none of the content actually having anything to do with them. The album was released on CD by indie-rock label Sub Pop, and on vinyl by comedy label Stand Up! Records, which issued a limited edition of 500 triple LPs , with each respective LP pressed on red, white and blue vinyl.\nTrack listing\nDisc one\n#\"Lunch with Frankenstein\" – 1:31\n#\"Austin Powers Saying 'Yeah Baby'\" – 11:10\n#\"You Go, Girl!\" – 2:28\n#\"Phone Call from a Cranky Terrorist\" – 5:02\n#\"Sex on the Internet!?\" – 8:05\n#\"Spider-Man vs. Batman vs. Wonder Woman on the Rag\" – 4:55\n#\"Shaving the Pope's Pussy\" – 4:08\n#\"Monica Lewinsky and the Three Bears\" – 5:03\n#\"Fake Tits/Real Beer\" – 6:34\nDisc two\n#\"My Wife's Crazy!\" – 3:52\n#\"Flying on a Mexican Plane\" – 9:40\n#\"Abortion Doctor from Hell!\" – 7:25\n#\"Socks and Shoes\" – 3:52\n#\"My Daughter's First Date\" – 5:15\n#\"Diarrhea Moustache\" – 16:03\n#\"If Baseballs Had AIDS on Them\" – 22:44\n#\"Goodnight Assholes!\" – 5:41\nThe first track on Disc 1 features a hidden track.
