It is near the boundaries of four English counties:  Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire. Nearby in the late 19th century were Netherseal Colliery and Netherseal Hall. Today a small village exists here, also called No Man's Heath, which is the northernmost settlement in Warwickshire. No-Mans-Heath was formerly an extra-parochial tract, in 1858 No Mans Heath became a separate civil parish, on 24 March 1888 the parish was abolished and merged with Newton Regis. In 1881 the parish had a population of 70. The county boundary which used to divide the village between Leicestershire and Warwickshire has been re-drawn on 1 April 1965 to place the whole village in Warwickshire.\nThe village has an Indian restaurant called The Four Counties Spice; this used to be the village public house, called The Four Counties Inn.\nLeicestershire, Warwickshire, and Staffordshire meet about  northwest of the village. Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Staffordshire meet a further half-mile northwest. There is an ancient (probably Mercian) stone, divided into four parts, which may mark the point where the four counties met before boundary adjustments.\nSee also\n* Dow Bridge, meeting point of Warwickshire, Northamptonshire and Leicestershire.\n* Four Shire Stone, meeting point of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire (historically also Worcestershire)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2006/08/04/local_tv_archive_four_counties_in_one_pub_feature.shtml BBC Staffordshire] article about the Four Counties Inn, 2006"
