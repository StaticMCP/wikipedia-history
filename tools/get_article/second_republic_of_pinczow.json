Power in the Republic belonged to delegate of Polish Government in Exile and local commander of the Home Army Forces. There was also a separate authority for the communist forces which did not recognize the London-based government-in-exile. The Republic collapsed due to concentration of Wehrmacht nearby and lack of supplies. The anniversary of the creation of the Pińczów Republic is commemorated by local Polish authorities.\nmural in Pińczów commemorating the Republic]]\nSee also\n* First Republic of Pińczów\nReferences"
