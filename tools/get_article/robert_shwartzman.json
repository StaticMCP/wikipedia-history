Shwartzman took the pole position ahead of his home race at Sochi, but he couldn't save his race lead and finished second behind Armstrong. However, Shwartzman's point advantage on Daruvala was enough for him to clinch the championship title.\nFIA Formula 2 Championship\n2020\nShwartzman joined Prema Racing for the 2020 FIA Formula 2 Championship, partnering Mick Schumacher.\nThe season was planned to begin in March, but was postponed until July due to COVID-19 pandemic. On 18 April 2020, Shwartzman's father died of COVID-19 aged 52. On his rookie season of F2, Shwartzman expected his season as \"toughest season of my life\" mainly due to his father's death. Shwartzman qualified eighth on the opening race at the Red Bull Ring in Austria. He made a good start, moving up to fifth and later taking advantage for a mechanical issue for Guanyu Zhou and a mistake from Schumacher. This led him to take a podium finish on his Formula 2 debut, taking third place in the feature race.  Shwartzman finished in fourth, two places higher than where he started due to retirements from Giuliano Alesi and former Formula 3 teammate Marcus Armstrong.

He left the first turn of the first lap five places ahead in sixth. He had a tire strategy different from the front-runners and had better tyre management.

He would retire with a car issue at the halfway mark of the feature race. Shwartzman stormed back to ninth in the sprint race despite a mistake on lap eighteen but was not enough to nab points.\nAt his home event at Sochi Autodrom, Shwartzman qualified seventh. However, a slow pit stop costed Shwartzman and soon slipping down to 11th. Shwartzman only finished tenth in a red-flagged sprint race, capping off another point-less weekend. Following the weekend, Shwartzman sat fifth in the standings, a distant 51 points off championship leader Schumacher. Shwartzman qualified fourteenth in the first of two rounds in Bahrain.

He converted it to a dominant win, leading every lap. Shwartzman qualified fourth at the second Sakhir round. He improved ahead to second on the first lap, passing both Carlin drivers. He eventually was passed by Tsunoda, and later in the race by Guanyu Zhou and Felipe Drugovich. He finished in fifth, but when Nikita Mazepin was penalised, he was moved to fourth position.

He then scored his first win of the season, winning by five seconds. He finished fifth in the second sprint race, and ended the weekend in third place, taking advantage of multiple incidents and penalties for other drivers. In Silverstone, Shwartzman qualified seventh. He won once again, having a brilliant start to pass Christian Lundgaard, Jüri Vips and Roy Nissany before the first corner. He described his win as \"redemption\" following his win being taken away the previous year due to a collision. In the second sprint race, Shwartzman was running just outside the points when he spun on the penultimate corner on the penultimate lap, dropping him to fifteenth at the flag. He bounced back to secure fifth in the feature race.\nShwartzman qualified twelfth in Monza.

He finished the 2021 season as vice-champion with two wins, three fastest laps and eight podiums in total. He also achieved a total of 192 points that year, albeit 60.5 points off champion Piastri.
