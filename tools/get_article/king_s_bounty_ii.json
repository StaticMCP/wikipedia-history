Jarrett Green of PCGamesN wrote similarly, stating that while combat was both fun and challenging, the game was hindered by unexciting presentation of story, characters, and derivative mechanics. Leana Hafer of IGN criticized the game's inconsistent voice acting, lack of storytelling nuance, inability to form relationships, and its predictable characters and story in contrast to its well-crafted setting. She also noted the abundance of technical issues, from the general glitchiness of the camera to the \"phoned-in\" story cutscenes. John Rairdin of Nintendo World Report criticized the poor image quality and resolution exclusive to the Nintendo Switch version of the game.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.1cpublishing.eu/game/744-king-s-bounty-ii ''King's Bounty 2'']  at 1C Company official website"
