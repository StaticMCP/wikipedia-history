The plan called for the construction of five prisoner of war camps, one in each Corps Tactical Zone and one in the Capital Military District (Saigon), each having an initial capacity of 1,000 prisoners. Each camp would be staffed by South Vietnamese military police with U.S. military police prisoner of war advisers also assigned to each camp. The plan was approved in December 1965. Late in 1966 work was begun on the Can Tho camp in IV Corps.\nIn October 1971 the camp held 3,007 prisoners including 66 People's Army of Vietnam soldiers. Prisoners were allowed weekly visits by family members. The camp commander stated that 62 prisoners had died since the camp opened in 1967, most from injuries sustained during capture, while 310 prisoners had become Chieu Hoi.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.britishpathe.com/asset/220990/ 1971 Pathe News film]\n*[https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4F250B76999277463A9AFFFDD54A83D3/S0022463423000449a.pdf/capture_classification_and_incarceration_of_communist_captives_during_vietnams_american_war.pdf Capture, classification and incarceration of Communist captives during Vietnam’s American War]"
