As such, he is the Metropolitan of the Province of Southwark.\nThe archdiocese has an area of  and covers the London Boroughs south of the Thames, the county of Kent and the Medway Unitary Authority. The Metropolitan See is in Southwark where the archbishop's seat is located at the St George's Cathedral.\nThe eleventh and current archbishop is John Wilson, who was appointed on 10 June 2019 and was installed on 25 July 2019.\nHistory\nThe Diocese of Southwark was created on 29 September 1850 and originally covered the historic counties of Surrey, Berkshire, Hampshire, Kent, Sussex, the Isle of Wight, and the Channel Islands. It lost territory on the creation of the Diocese of Portsmouth on 19 May 1882. The diocese lost further territory on the creation of the Diocese of Arundel & Brighton on 28 May 1965. However, on the same day the diocese of Southwark was elevated to an archdiocese when the ecclesiastical province of Southwark was established; from 1850 the diocese had been part of the Province of Westminster. The metropolitan archbishop of Southwark has jurisdiction over the bishops of Arundel & Brighton, of Plymouth, and of Portsmouth.\nList of bishops and archbishops\nBishops of Southwark\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"; border=\"1\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\"|Roman Catholic Bishops of Southwark\n|- align=center\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"9%\"|From\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"9%\"|Until\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"32%\"|Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"45%\"|Notes\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=center|1851\n|align=center|1870\n|Thomas Grant\n| Appointed bishop on 27 June 1851 and consecrated on 6 July 1851.
