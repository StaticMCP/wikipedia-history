It was formed in September 1916 and was still in existence at the end of the war.\nChronicle\nThe 54th Corps (z.b.V.) was formed in September 1916.  With the onset of trench warfare, the German Army recognised that it was no longer possible to maintain the traditional Corps unit, that is, one made up of two divisions.  Whereas at some times (and in some places) a Corps of two divisions was sufficient, at other times 5 or 6 divisions were necessary.  Therefore, under the Hindenburg regime (from summer 1916), new Corps headquarters were created without organic divisions.  These new Corps were designated\nGeneral Commands for Special Use ().\nBy the end of the war, the Corps was serving on the Western Front as part of 2nd Army, Heeresgruppe Kronprinz Rupprecht with the following composition:\n* 21st Reserve Division\n* 22nd Division\n* 4th Division\n* 113th Division\n* 239th Division\n* 12th Reserve Division\n* Jäger Division\n* 185th Division\nCommanders\nThe 54th Corps had the following commanders during its existence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
