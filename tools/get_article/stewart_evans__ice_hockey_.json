The Falcons were renamed in 1932 as the Detroit Red Wings. He played for the Red Wings until the 1933–34 season when he was traded to the Montreal Maroons. He won the Stanley Cup in 1935 with the Maroons. He served as the final captain of the Maroons from 1937 to 1938. He played out the season with the Maroons then moved on for the following season, 1938–39, to the Montreal Canadiens.\nPost-playing career\nAfter retiring from hockey in 1939, Evans moved into the car business, and joined the Ford Motor Company as a labour relations manager. Although he went on to pursue business interest he never severed ties with the Red Wings.\nIn 1945 Evans built his first Lincoln-Mercury dealership. He acquired a second dealership in 1955 in Detroit, and by 1957 was the successful owner of a third dealership. At the height of his career in the car industry his company was among the nation's top 100 in sales and customer satisfaction. In 1993 Evans sold his remaining dealerships to his eldest grandson John, but continued on as chairman of the board until his death in 1996.\nIn 1960 Evans founded the Red Wings Alumni Association and served as its first president.\nPersonal life\nEvans was born June 19, 1907, in Ottawa, Ontario, to Hadarezer and Jeanne \"Jennie\" (nee Lapalm) Evans. On August 12, 1930, in Iroquois Falls, Ontario, he married Elizabeth Jane Thompson (1905–1983). They had three children.\nEvans's great-grandfather, Thomas Galway McNaughton Evans (1807–1898) was born in Limerick, Ireland. Thomas Galway Evans was the patriarch of the family that left Ireland and made it to North America where he died October 27, 1898, in Nepean, Ontario.\nEvans died on June 2, 1996, in Atlantis, Palm Beach County, Florida. He was survived by his wife, children, 11 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren.\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
