A self-produced effort, it marked their first release since 2009's 21st Century Breakdown not to be produced by longtime producer Rob Cavallo. It is also their first release since that album to be recorded as a trio. Green Day's previous three studio albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! (all released in 2012), featured touring guitarist Jason White joining the band in the studio as an additional musician.\nThree singles were released from the album: \"Bang Bang\", \"Revolution Radio\", and \"Still Breathing\". The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, appeared on multiple year-end lists, and sold 95,000 first-week album-equivalent units in the US to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Revolution Radio also debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Canada, and New Zealand.\nBackground and composition\nWork on what would become Revolution Radio began in 2014, following the 99 Revolutions Tour, in support of ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! (2012).\nAfter acknowledging that the trilogy of albums had \"absolutely no direction to them\" and were an attempt at being \"prolific for the sake of it\", lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong claimed that the record is \"not so much a makeover as a make under\". The lead single, \"Bang Bang\", described by Armstrong is about \"the culture of mass shooting that happens in America mixed with narcissistic social media.\"\nThe album's lead single, \"Bang Bang\", premiered on August 11, 2016. Prior to the album's release, its title track, \"Revolution Radio\", and \"Still Breathing\" were released on September 9 and September 23, respectively. On the album's release date, the official lyric video for \"Youngblood\" was uploaded on the band's website. On October 12, a lyric video for the song \"Ordinary World\" was released. On October 19, another lyric video was released, for the song \"Say Goodbye\". On November 7, a music video was released for \"Still Breathing\". On January 16, a lyric video was released for \"Troubled Times\". On September 8, a lyric video for the song \"Too Dumb to Die\" was released. The album's final track \"Ordinary World\" was featured in the 2016 film of the same name, which starred Armstrong. On December 13, 2018, an official music video for \"Youngblood\" was released with the caption \"Merry Xmas 2018\" on the band's YouTube channel.\nProfessional reviewers describe the album as punk rock, pop-punk, and alternative rock.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Alternative Press\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = The Guardian\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Kerrang!\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Mojo\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = NME\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = Pitchfork\n| rev7score = 5.1/10\n| rev8 = Q\n| rev8score =\n| rev9 = Rolling Stone\n| rev9score =\n| rev10 = Slant Magazine\n| rev10score =\n| rev11 = Uncut\n| rev11score =\n}}\nRevolution Radio received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 72 out of 100, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\" based on 29 reviews.\nAaron Burgess at Alternative Press observed, \"It's the first time in years Green Day haven't had all the answers. But as a statement on how it really feels to fight, it's the closest to the truth they've ever gotten.\" Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian stated \"[after their last few albums] the band have decided to get back to basics: Revolution Radio is their most focused work in years. Lead single Bang Bang sets the tone, with a caustic consideration of the fame-hungry psychosis of a mass shooter.\"}}\n|-\n| NME\n| NME's Albums of the Year 2016\n| 2016\n| }}\n|-\n| Radio X\n| The 25 Best Albums of 2016\n| 2016\n| }}\n|-\n|Kerrang!\n|2016 – The Ultimate Rock Review, Top 50 Albums of 2016\n|2016\n|\n|}\nCommercial performance\nRevolution Radio debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 95,000 album-equivalent units, of which 90,000 were album sales.
