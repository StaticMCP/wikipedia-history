Watson Brake is one of the earliest mound complexes in the Americas.  Next oldest is the Poverty Point Culture, which thrived from 1730 to 1350 BC, during the late Archaic period in North America. Evidence of this mound builder culture has been found at more than 100 sites, including the Jaketown Site near Belzoni, Mississippi. The largest and best-known site is at Poverty Point, located on the Macon Ridge near present-day Epps, Louisiana. The culture is named for the  archeological site, which is in turn named after a 19th century cotton plantation built in the area.\nThe Poverty Point culture may have hit its peak around 1500 BC. It is one of the oldest complex cultures, and possibly the first tribal culture in the Mississippi Delta and in the present-day United States. The people occupied villages that extended for nearly  on either side of the Mississippi River.\nPoverty Point culture was followed by the Tchefuncte and Lake Cormorant cultures of the Tchula period, a local manifestation of the early Woodland period.  These descendant cultures differed from Poverty Point culture in trading over shorter distances, creating less massive public projects, completely adopting ceramics for storage and cooking, and lacking a lapidary (stone-carving) industry.\nEarthworks\nFile:Louisiana - Poverty Point - Karte (English version).png|Map of site with 2008 structures\nFile:Barrow pit at Poverty Point IMG 7422.JPG|Swale with a flowing stream\nFile:Circular structures at Poverty Point IMG 7433.JPG|Circular structure\nFile:Ridges One through Six at Poverty Point.jpg|Ridges\nFile:Mound & Mound at Poverty Point.jpg|Mounds\nFile:Magnificent Landformations & Waterways at Poverty Point.jpg|Bayou Marçon waterway at left, ridges at right\nAlthough the earthworks at Poverty Point are not the oldest in the United States (those at Watson Brake were built about 1900 years earlier), they are notable as the oldest earthworks of this size in the Western Hemisphere. In the center of the site is a plaza covering about 15 hectares or . Archeologists believe the plaza was the site of public ceremonies, rituals, dances, games and other major community activities.\nThe site has six concentric earthworks separated by ditches, or swales, where dirt was removed to build the ridges. The ends of the outermost ridge are  apart, which is nearly 3/4 of a mile.  The ends of the interior embankment are  apart. If the ridges were straightened and laid end to end, they would compose an embankment of  long. Originally, the ridges stood  to  high and  to  apart. Many years of plowing have reduced some to only  in height. Archeologists believe that the homes of 500 to 1,000 inhabitants were located on these ridges.\nIt was the largest settlement at that time in North America. The site also had a  high,  long earthen pyramid, which was aligned east to west. A large bird effigy mound, measuring  high and  across, is also located on the site.[http://www.lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2001aprilbeads.htm Prehistoric Beads]\nOn the western side of the plaza, archeologists have found some unusually deep pits. One explanation is these holes once held huge wooden posts, which served as calendar markers. Using the sun’s shadows, the inhabitants could have predicted the changing of the seasons. This great building project demanded a sustained investment of human labor, and the organized skill and cultural will to sustain the effort over many centuries. One authority calculated that it would take more than  of basket-loaded soil to complete the earthworks. That would mean 1,350 adults laboring 70 days a year for three years.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130130183652.htm Archaic Native Americans built massive Louisiana mound in less than 90 days]\nArtifacts\nFile:Poverty Point female figurines HRoe 2009.jpg|Female effigies, clay\nFile:Poverty Point gorgets atlatl weights HRoe 2009.jpg|Atlatl weights and carved stone gorgets\nFile:Poverty_pt_objects.jpg|Baked loess objects used in cooking, dating from 1650 and 700 BCE\nArcheological excavation has revealed a wealth of artifacts, including animal effigy figures; hand-molded, baked-clay cooking objects; simple thick-walled pottery; stone vessels, spear points, adzes, hoes, drills, edge-retouched flakes, and blades. Stone cooking balls were used to prepare meals. Scholars believe dozens of the cooking balls were heated in a bonfire and dropped in pits along with food. Different-shaped balls controlled cooking temperatures and cooking time.\nCrude human figures, forming another category of artifacts, are thought to have been used for religious purposes. Points made of imported gray Midwestern flint were also found.  In addition, plummets were fashioned out of heavy iron ore imported from Hot Springs, Arkansas; they served as weights for fish nets. Many of the raw materials used, such as slate, copper, galena, jasper, quartz, and soapstone, were from as far as  away, attesting to the distant reach of the trading culture.\nThe Poverty Point culture developed a tradition of making high-quality, stylized, carved and polished miniature stone beads.  Other early cultures in eastern North America rarely used stone to make their beads, opting for softer materials such as shell or bone. The beads depict animals common to the Poverty Point culture's environment, such as owls, dogs, locusts, and turkey vultures.\nSee also\n* Archaeological periods of the Mississippi Valley\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ancient-native-americans-were-incredible-engineers-180978605/ Louisiana’s Poverty Point Earthworks Show Early Native Americans Were ‘Incredible Engineers’], Smithsonian magazine news item, September 8, 2021"
