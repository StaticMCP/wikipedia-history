However, in late 1908, the two non-Labour parties merged into a new grouping known as the Liberals, also sometimes identified as the Ministerial party (a generic form referring to supporters of the Ministry). As not all members of the original parties supported the new Government, Kidston called another election — the third in 29 months — for 2 October 1909.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n!
