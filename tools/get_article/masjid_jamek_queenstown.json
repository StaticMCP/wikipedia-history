Built in 1964, it is one of the smallest mosques in the country with a capacity of at least 400 worshippers. It is currently a heritage site of the Queenstown neighbourhood.\nHistory\nMasjid Jamek Queenstown was built in 1964, opened on 25 December of that year by Mohammed Khir Johari, who was then the Malayan Minister for Agriculture and Co-Operatives. Due to its location next to the Alexandra Canal, the mosque was flooded by waters from the canal during construction works in 1993. To resolve the issues, the ground surrounding the mosque was raised six times to prevent intense flooding. The mosque was eventually recognized as a landmark of Queenstown by 2011, being listed on the main heritage trail of the area as well.\nThe mosque received a major upgrading and renovation in 2017, as part of a project to renovate old generation mosques, which included Masjid Tasek Utara at Farrer Park and Masjid Hussain Sulaiman at Pasir Panjang. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mosque was affected by the outbreak and was temporarily closed down but resumed functionality as per usual after the pandemic.\nArchitecture\nMasjid Jamek Queenstown is built in a Javanese architectural style, with a tiered roof, one covering the main building and the other topping the single minaret. The mosque's architectural style is also meant to have a traditional Malay village aesthetic. The mosque was formerly known for its predominantly blue colour scheme which was later changed to a white, brown and green colour scheme after the 2017 renovations.\nGallery\nFile:Jamek Queenstown.JPG|Masjid Jamek Queenstown in 2011, when the building was primarily blue in colour.\nSee also\n*Masjid Hang Jebat\n*Masjid Mujahidin\n*List of mosques in Singapore\nReferences"
