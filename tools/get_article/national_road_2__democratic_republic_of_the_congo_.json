It runs from Mbuji-Mayi through Bukavu, Goma, and terminates at Beni.\nIn the north, the road runs along the western edge of Virunga National Park until it reaches Kanyabayonga, where it cuts through the park to Rutshuru and then south to Goma, which lies on the northern shore of Lake Kivu around the western shore of Lake Kivu via Katana towards Bukavu. The condition of the road in North Kivu is passable, but from Bukavu to Kitutu, the condition of the road is very poor.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Towns linked (north to south)\n|-\n! Town !!
