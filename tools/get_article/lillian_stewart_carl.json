She has been a friend of Lois McMaster Bujold since childhood; both authors credit Carl with getting Bujold started writing. This is described in the introduction to Bujold's collection ''Dreamweaver's Dilemma''.  Bujold's second novel, ''The Warrior's Apprentice, is dedicated to Carl.   Both authors are friends with fantasy and sci-fi author Patricia Wrede. Lillian co-edited The Vorkosigan Companion'', a retrospective on Lois McMaster Bujold's science fiction work, with John Helfers.  It was published by Baen Books in December 2008 and nominated for a Hugo Award in the \"Best Related\"\ncategory at Anticipation, the 2009 Worldcon.\nSelf description\nIn her biographical statement on her website and in her publicity materials, Carl says:\nLillian has lived for many years in North Texas, in a book-lined cloister cleverly disguised as a tract house. Therefore she's developed a passion for mountains and seacoasts, especially the ones in Scotland. Lillian is a member of The Author's Guild, Novelists Inc., Science Fiction Writers of America, and Sisters in Crime.\nGenre\nCarl originally wrote science fiction and fantasy, then branched out later to romantic suspense and mystery. Many of her books also cross genres, containing touches of what she calls her own genre mix of all the above with touches of the paranormal.\nCarl states that: \"It was she [Bujold] who introduced me to science fiction and fantasy in general and Tolkien in particular.\" and \"Recently I re-read my first published fantasy novels. I was appalled to discover I'd used several Tolkien-esque phrases — quite unconsciously, as so much of his prose is now lodged deep in my subconscious.\"\nCritical response\n''Lucifer's Crown''\nJayme Lynn Blaschke writes:\nLucifer's Crown is not an easy book to describe or classify. It tries to be many things at once, but first and foremost, it's a novel of Biblical apocalypse. In a time where Christian fiction with an apocalyptic bent — led by the wildly popular Left Behind series — is a multi-million dollar industry, it was inevitable that more traditional fantasy writers would eventually turn their hand to these tropes and themes. Lillian Stewart Carl, in taking up this challenge, has responded with her most complex and ambitious novel to date. What's more important, it's also by far her best.\nPlanted firmly and unabashedly in the tradition of the Inklings, ''Lucifer's Crown'' evokes the theology-steeped works of C.S. Lewis and Charles Williams — a connection reinforced by repeated references and allusions to Tolkien.... Carl's book compares favorable to another classic work of Christian-themed fantasy, The Book of the Dun Cow by Walter Wangerin, Jr.... But pigeonholing Lucifer's Crown as apocalyptic Christian fiction does a grave disservice to the book and to readers. It's so much more than that. Carl has taken half a dozen or more traditions and genres, mixing them together to forge an alloyed novel of unexpected strength.\nHis praise is not unmixed, however—he complains that:\nTwo serious flaws work against the novel, however — flaws made all the worse by being easily correctable, to my mind. Carl opens the book by throwing almost the entire cast at the reader, making it hard to grasp and identify with any of them, much less the setting of contemporary Glastonbury. ... The other major problem I had with Lucifer's Crown is infuriating simply because it's so utterly unnecessary: The novel takes place in the final months of the year 2000. That's right, we're treated to yet another clichéd end-of-the-millennium apocalypse. Other than hopelessly dating a story that otherwise manages to be effectively timeless, the move is just downright dumb.\nLibrary Journal wrote:\nBlending historical mystery with a touch of the supernatural, the author creates an intriguing exploration of faith and redemption in a world that is at once both modern and timeless.\nIn Green Man Review Matthew Scott Winslow wrote:\nLillian Stewart Carl's latest fantasy novel, ''Lucifer's Crown'', effectively combines Arthurian legend, Grail myth, and British folkways to create a powerful novel.\nThe highest praise I can give this novel is that it reminds me strongly of Charles Williams, but it succeeds where Williams always failed: it has believable characters. Not at first, however. It takes Ms. Carl about fifty to seventy-five pages to get into her stride with this story. Until then, the characters feel stiff and wooden and contrived.\nAlso much like Williams is the theological and philosophical subtext. Ms. Carl takes the ideas of good vs. evil quite seriously and probes deeply into the idea of redemption. She does not, however, take her themes lightly, instead giving them a vigorous shaking down before she's done, resulting in a gripping spiritual thriller. One could easily call this 'in the tradition of Charles Williams' — which it certainly is — but it more importantly moves beyond that master of the spiritual thriller.\nAlong the Rim of Time\nJayme Lynn Blaschke writes:\nLike many genre authors, Carl perfected her craft at the short fiction level.... I was delighted to find Carl's most important stories collected here for the first time.... Of the 11 stories contained here, all have some sort of underlying mythic/historical theme, which is Carl's forté.... Perhaps the most ambitious story here is \"From the Labyrinth of Night.\" A Martian exploration setup is developed nicely with rich allusions to the Minotaur legends of ancient Crete, culminating in the \"sacrifice\" demanded by the beast in the maze. The interpersonal relationships are the real driving force to the narrative, as by this point, the astronauts' explorations are mechanical efforts done out of habit more than enthusiasm.... \"Upon this Shoal of Time\" is another ambitious science fiction story cloaked in the trappings of mythology. This time, Carl takes the reader to a far-future archaeological dig, where real science is dependent upon the financial sponsorship of media conglomerates hopeful of unearthing exclusive rights to digs that capture the public fancy, King Tut-style. After unearthing an intact Pictish skull from a Scottish burial site in Cawdor, Dr. James Henderson subjects it to a series of elaborate processes, each one designed to unlock lost memories from the subject at the sub-atomic level. His experiment is far more successful than he'd ever dreamed. At turns disturbing and impressive, with MacBethian overtones, Carl crafts a moving tale around the strength and impact memories can have on a person. One of the strongest stories presented here — the fuzzy science of the premise is presented smoothly and logically, detracting nothing from the narrative.\nShadow Dancers\nin Thrust Ardath Mayhar writes:\nAnyone who believes that fantasy must contain magic and elves has never read the work of Mary Renault...in Lillian Carl we have found another who can offer her readers an alternate reality that will live inside the mind long after the book has been finished.\"\nWings of Power\nin Thrust Ardath Mayhar writes\n...resonances between adolescent lust and mature love, between interior and exterior beauty, and between faith and skepticism underlie the story with a steely webwork of reality...an elegant thread of eroticism woven with delicacy and with through the story...the prose is crafted with a jeweler's precision and the use of imagery is masterful.  Carl may well be the finest stylist working in fantasy today..\"\nAshes to Ashes\nIn the Ohioana Quarterly Barbara Leskey writes:\n...characters come to life through Carl's ear for everyday dialogue...especially spell-binding is the realistic description of the ghostly presence that stalks the twisted corridors...the reader is drawn into the mystery as well as the love story that unfolds...a believable story laced with historical fact and delicious humor. I highly recommend it...\"\nMemory and Desire\nIn Murder Express Kay Martinez writes:\nThe setting is wonderful, Ms. Carl describes the village of Somerstowe and the English climate so well that this reader felt as if she were viewing a film. The characters, both major as well as minor, come to life clearly with all their traits, quirks, and foibles helping the reader understand some of their actions. The mystery kept me guessing until the last few chapters where I had an \"AHA! moment\" just as I suspect the author intended.\nShadows in Scarlet\nPublishers Weekly's reviewer wrote:\nPresenting a delicious mix of romance and supernatural suspense, Carl (Ashes to Ashes) delivers yet another immensely readable tale. She has created an engaging cast and a very entertaining plot, spicing the mix with some interesting twists on the ghostly romantic suspense novel.\nin Romantic Times, Toby Bromberg writes:\nShadows in Scarlet successfully combines time-travel elements with classic romantic suspense. There is a little something for everyone here, making for a pleasing read.\nThe Secret Portrait\nLibrary Journal writes:\nIn pursuit of information about Bonnie Prince Charlie's legendary lost gold, reporter Jean Fairbairn discovers a new corpse instead. Before all is said and done, she tangles with a nouveau-riche Stuart aficionado and Inspector Cameron. An entertaining blend of policing and sleuthing.\nThe Murder Hole\nIn Cozy Library \"Diana\" writes:\nBilled as a blend of mystery, romance and the paranormal, The Murder Hole is a meaty book.... Not a frothy mystery to gulp down in one sitting, it’s a book to save for a lazy weekend or relaxing vacation when there’s time to savor the complexities of the story and take in the scent and sense of Scotland.\nThe Burning Glass\nPublishers Weekly's reviewer wrote:\nAuthentic dialect...detailed descriptions of the castle and environs, and\nvivid characters recreate an area rich in history and legend. The tightly\nwoven plot is certain to delight history fans with its dramatic collision of\npast and present.\nKirkus Reviews writes:\nA little romance, a dash of mystery and a soupcon of history make a\nhearty...dish.\nThe Muse and Other Stories of History, Mystery and Myth\nOn ''Lesa's Book Critiques, Lesa Holstine writes:\nThe Muse and Other Stories of History, Mystery and Myth allows the author to explore a range of historical periods, and literary classics. Carl has intriguing plots in which she challenges the reader to look at culture with a different eye. Lillian Stewart Carl invites the interested reader into a collection of stories filled with the magic of the past.\nBlackness Tower\nOn ParaNormal Romance Reviews,'' Clover Autrey writes:\nLillian Stewart Carl's writing is at once intelligent, captivating, and\nromantic, caressed by light fingers of poetic description. In no way am I\ngoing to give anything away about the mystery itself except to say that I\npride myself on usually being able to figure them out. This one kept me\nintrigued and guessing until the end. In fact, she had so many clues and\ndetails involving the present and not one, but two time lines from the past,\nI was a little worried that Carl wouldn't be able to pull off a satisfying\nending. But I worried for nothing, because the ending blew me away.\nBlackness Tower is definitely a keeper, a book meaty enough to inspire hours\nand hours of discussion for the most tenacious book club.\nBibliography\nBooks\n* Sabazel series — Fantasy\n**\n**\n**\n**\n* Reid/Campbell series — Romantic Suspense\n**\n**\n** — spin-off from the Reid/Campbell series.\n* (collection of short fiction including previously unpublished story, Wild Honey)\n*) .
