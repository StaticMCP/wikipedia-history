It has an L shape, with intersecting hip roofs, and two interior chimneys. The main entry is centered on the five-bay front facade, and is elaborately framed with sidelight windows and a fanlight, and is sheltered by a portico with Tuscan columns. The house is notable for its association with Dr. Edward Francis Gleason, founder of Cape Cod Hospital, and for its ownership by Timothy Baker, a ship's captain engaged in the coasting trade.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1987.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Barnstable County, Massachusetts\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://mhc-macris.net/details?mhcid=brn.1457 MACRIS Listing - Edward Francis Gleason House]"
