It is dedicated to the participants of the Second World War.\nInformation\n\"Memorial complex of the participants of the Great Patriotic War\" was built during the USSR rule and is dedicated to the participants of the Second World War. The complex includes bas-reliefs of Soviet soldiers, a park and the \"Mothers Statue\". The city of Shusha was occupied by the Armed Forces of Armenia in May 1992 and the bas-reliefs of the soldiers in the complex were shot, the \"Mothers statue\" was vandalized, and the eternal flame was extinguished. In November 2020, the territory of the complex was liberated from occupation together with the city. The complex is planned to be restored. In April 2021, residents of the city of Shusha, together with Russian peacekeepers, cleaned and painted the elements of the monumental complex to the participants of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, as well as the arrangement of the adjacent area.\nReferences"
