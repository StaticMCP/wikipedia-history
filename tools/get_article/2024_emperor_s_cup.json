As usual it featured 88 teams representing the prefectural football associations, university football federation, J1 League, J2 League and Japan Football League. The winner qualified to the group stage of the 2025–26 AFC Champions League Elite.\nKawasaki Frontale were the defending champions, winning the 2023 final on penalties against Kashiwa Reysol.\nOn 19 September 2023, it was announced by JFA that Urawa Red Diamonds was banned from participating in this tournament following supporters clash after a 0–3 loss against Nagoya Grampus in the 4th round of the previous year's edition. For this reason, instead of one, two specially designated amateur clubs were designated by JFA, being them 2023 Japan Football League champions Honda FC and 2023 University Championship winners Meiji University. Both teams were given a bye from prefectural qualifications, as usual.\nCalendar\nThe schedule for the first round to the quarter-finals was announced on 15 December 2023 in JFA's 12th Board of Directors meeting.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
