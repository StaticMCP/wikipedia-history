Witnesses said they heard human voices being transmitted.\n* 1861: Johann Philipp Reis transfers voice electrically over a distance of 340 feet with his Reis telephone. To prove that speech can be recognized successfully at the receiving end, he uses the phrase \"The horse does not eat cucumber salad\" as an example because this phrase is hard to understand acoustically in German.\n* 1864: In an attempt to give his musical automaton a voice, Innocenzo Manzetti invents the 'speaking telegraph'. He shows no interest in patenting his device, but it is reported in newspapers.\n* 1865: Meucci reads of Manzetti's invention and writes to the editors of two newspapers claiming priority and quoting his first experiment in 1849. He writes \"I do not wish to deny Mr. Manzetti his invention, I only wish to observe that two thoughts could be found to contain the same discovery, and that by uniting the two ideas one can more easily reach the certainty about a thing this important.\"\n* 1871: Meucci files a patent caveat (a statement of intention to file a patent application) for a Sound Telegraph, but it does not describe an electromagnetic telephone.\n* 1872: Elisha Gray founds the Western Electric Manufacturing Company.\n* 1872: Professor Vanderwyde demonstrates Reis's telephone in New York.\n* July 1873: Thomas Edison notes varying resistance in carbon grains due to pressure, and builds a rheostat based on the principle but abandons it because of its sensitivity to vibration.\n* May 1874: Gray invents an electromagnet device for transmitting musical tones. Some of his receivers use a metallic diaphragm.\n* July 1874: Alexander Graham Bell conceives the theoretical concept for the telephone while vacationing at his parents' farm near Brantford, Ontario, Canada. Alexander Melville Bell records notes of his son's conversation in his personal journal.\n* 29 December 1874: Gray demonstrates his musical tones device and transmits \"familiar melodies through telegraph wire\" at the Presbyterian Church in Highland Park, Illinois.\n* 4 May 1875: Bell conceives of using varying resistance in a wire conducting electric current to create a varying current amplitude.\n* 2 June 1875: Bell transmits the sound of a plucked steel reed using electromagnet instruments.\n* 1 July 1875: Bell uses a bi-directional \"gallows\" telephone that was able to transmit \"indistinct but voice-like sounds\" rather than clear speech. Both the transmitter and the receiver were identical membrane electromagnet instruments.\n* 1875: Thomas Edison experiments with acoustic telegraphy and, in November, builds an electro-dynamic receiver but does not exploit it.\n1876 to 1878\n* 11 February 1876: Elisha Gray invents a liquid transmitter for use with a telephone, but he did not make one.\n* 14 February 1876\n** about 9:30am: Gray or his lawyer brings Gray's patent caveat for the telephone to the Washington, D.C. Patent Office (a caveat was a notice of intention to file a patent application. It was like a patent application, but without a request for examination, for the purpose of notifying the patent office of a possible invention in process).\n** about 11:30am: Bell's lawyer brings to the same patent office Bell's patent application for the telephone.  Bell's lawyer requests that it be registered immediately in the cash receipts blotter.\n** about 1:30pm: Approximately two hours later Elisha Gray's patent caveat is registered in the cash blotter. Although his caveat was not a full application, Gray could have converted it into a patent application and contested Bell's priority, but did not do so because of advice from his lawyer and his involvement with acoustic telegraphy.  The result was that the patent was awarded to Bell.\n* 7 March 1876: Bell's U.S. Patent, No. 174,465 for the telephone is granted.\n* 10 March 1876: Bell first successfully transmits speech, saying \"Mr. Watson, come here! I want to see you!\" using a liquid transmitter as described in Gray's caveat, and Bell's own electromagnetic receiver.\n* 16 May 1876: Thomas Edison files first patent application for acoustic telegraphy for which U.S. patent 182,996 was granted 10 October 1876.\n* 25 June 1876: Bell exhibits his telephone at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where it draws enthusiastic reactions from Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil and Lord Kelvin, attracting the attention of the press and resulting in the first announcements of the invention to the general public. Lord Kelvin describes the telephone as \"the greatest by far of all the marvels of the electric telegraph\".\n* 10 August 1876: Alexander Graham Bell makes the world's first long-distance telephone call, one-way, not reciprocal, over a distance of about 6 miles, between Brantford and Paris, Ontario, Canada.\n* 1876: Hungarian Tivadar Puskás invents the telephone switchboard exchange (later working with Edison).\n* 9 October 1876: Bell makes the first two-way long-distance telephone call between Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts.\n* October 1876: Edison tests his first carbon microphone.\n* 1877: The first experimental telephone exchange in Boston.\n* 20 January 1877: Edison \"first [succeeds] in transmitting over wires many articulated sentences\" using carbon granules as a pressure-sensitive varying resistance under the pressure of a diaphragm.\n* 30 January 1877: Bell's U.S. Patent No. 186,787 is granted for an electromagnetic telephone using permanent magnets, iron diaphragms, and a call bell.\n* 4 March 1877: Emile Berliner invents a microphone based on \"loose contact\" between two metal electrodes, an improvement on Reis' Telephone, and in April 1877 files a caveat of an invention in process.\n* April 1877: A telephone line connects the workshop of Charles Williams, Jr., located in Boston, to his house in Somerville, Massachusetts, at 109 Court Street in Boston, where Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson had previously experimented with their telephone. The telephones became No. 1 and 2 in the Bell Telephone Company.\n* 27 April 1877: Edison files telephone patent applications. U.S. patents (Nos. 474,230, 474,231 and 474,232) were awarded to Edison in 1892 over the competing claims of Alexander Graham Bell, Emile Berliner, Elisha Gray, Amos Dolbear, J.W. McDonagh, G.B.
