He succeeded his father, who had been created Baron De La Warr and died in 1595, by letters patent in 1597.\nHe was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight in 1586 and for  Aylesbury in 1593. He was knighted in 1587. It is probable, though uncertain, that he had previously represented Chichester in the 1571 Parliament and East Looe in the 1572 Parliament.\nFrom 1590 to his death he was one of the two Chamberlains of the Exchequer.\nIn 1597 he petitioned the House of Lords to have the precedence of the original barony, 1299, on the basis that he actually held the ancient peerage. After his claim was admitted, he sometimes referred to himself as 11th Baron.\nMarriage and issue\nWest married, on 19 November 1571, Anne Knollys, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys and Catherine Carey, daughter of William Carey, esquire, by whom he had six sons and eight daughters:\n*Sir Robert West, who married, about 1592, Elizabeth Cocke, daughter of Henry Cocke of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and predeceased his father.
