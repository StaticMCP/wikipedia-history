Hosted by Arsenio Hall, the show honored the best music videos released between May 2, 1987 and April 1, 1988.\nAustralian rock band INXS was both the most-nominated and most-awarded artist at the show, winning five of their nine nominations, including the awards for Video of the Year and Viewer's Choice for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\". This marked the first of a few instances in VMA history where the same artist and music video won both awards at the same ceremony. Other artists with multiple nominations included George Harrison and U2, who earned eight each.\nThe category for Best Overall Performance in a Video was eliminated from the award lineup while the category for Most Experimental Video was renamed to \"Breakthrough Video\", a name it would keep until the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, after which it was also removed from the lineup.\nBackground\nNominees were revealed on July 12, 1988. Dick Clark was announced as the show's producer on August 1 while Arsenio Hall was named a co-host—no other co-host was subsequently announced. Clark's hiring was rooted in MTV's desire to streamline the ceremony by bringing in a producer with experience in music and award ceremony broadcasting. On show-day, the live broadcast was preceded by the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards Pre-Game Show, during which Ken Ober and Colin Quinn highlighted the nominated videos.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of musical performances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n| Rod Stewart\n| \"Forever Young\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Jody Watley\n| \"Some Kind of Lover\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Aerosmith\n| \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Elton John\n| \"I Don't Wanna Go on with You Like That\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Depeche Mode\n| \"Strangelove\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Crowded House\n| \"Better Be Home Soon\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Michael Jackson\n| \"Bad\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Cher\n| \"Main Man\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| The Fat Boys  Chubby Checker\n| \"Louie Louie\"\"The Twist\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Guns N' Roses\n| \"Welcome to the Jungle\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| INXS\n| \"New Sensation\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nPresenters\n* David Coverdale and Tawny Kitaen – presented Best Group Video\n* Eric Roberts and Teri Garr – presented Best Video from a Film\n* Bryan Ferry and Melanie Griffith – presented Breakthrough Video\n* Crowded House – presented Best New Artist in a Video\n* Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and Magic Johnson – presented Best Concept Video\n* DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince and Justine Bateman – presented Best Stage Performance in a Video\n* Peter Gabriel – presented the Video Vanguard award to Michael Jackson during his acceptance segment in London\n* Adam Curry and Kevin Seal – announced the winners for Best Special Effects, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, and Best Cinematography in a Video\n* Suzanne Vega and Robert Downey Jr. – presented Best Direction in a Video\n* Julie Brown and Downtown Julie Brown – presented Best Choreography in a Video; also appeared in pre-commercial segments about what was 'coming up' on the show\n* The Bangles – presented Best Male Video\n* Cyndi Lauper and Rod Stewart – presented Viewer's Choice\n* Aerosmith – presented Best Female Video\n* Cher and Hall – presented Video of the Year\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were selected from \"a list of 644 videos that were exhibited for the first time on MTV between May 2, 1987, and April 1, 1988.\" Two rounds of voting were used to first select ten semifinalists followed by five finalists in each category.
