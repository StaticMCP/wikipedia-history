The State Council (Russian Empire) had its centenary at the Mariinsky Palace marked by Repin's work. Repin quickly sketched while in the room, and later expanded this into the full painting with the aid of assistants Boris Kustodiev and Ivan Kulikov. The photorealism of the painting was noted in its time.\nThe painting is in the collection of the Russian Museum, Saint Petersburg.\nReferences"
