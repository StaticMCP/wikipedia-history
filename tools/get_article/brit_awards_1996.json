At the ceremony he accompanied his single \"Earth Song\" with a stage show, culminating with Jackson as a 'Christ-like figure' surrounded by children. Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker mounted the stage in what he would later claim as protest at this portion of the performance. Cocker ran across the stage, lifting his shirt and pointing his (clothed) bottom in Jackson's direction. Cocker was subsequently questioned by the police on suspicion of causing injury towards three of the children in Jackson's performance, who were now on stage. No criminal proceedings followed. It was later alleged that someone in Jackson's entourage hurt the children.\nOasis and Blur\n1996 saw the height of a well-documented feud between Britpop rivals Oasis and Blur. The differing styles of the bands, coupled with their prominence within the Britpop movement, led the British media to seize upon the rivalry between the bands. Both factions played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the ceremony by singing a vulgar rendition of \"Parklife\" when they collected their \"Best British Band\" award.\nCut moments\nOasis and Michael Hutchence\nINXS frontman Michael Hutchence presented the British video award to Oasis, whose guitarist Noel Gallagher mocked Hutchence upon receiving the award, by sneering, ″Hasbeens shouldn't give awards to gonnabes″, which according to musician and producer Danny Saber upset Hutchence. This inspired Hutchence to add the lyrics ″I'm better than Oasis″ to INXS' single Elegantly Wasted, released the following year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1996 Brit Awards 1996 at Brits.co.uk]"
