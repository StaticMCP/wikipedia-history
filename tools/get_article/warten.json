As of January 2017, it had a population of approximately 915.\nThe village is home to a restored windmill named De Ikkers. Warten is situated near the De Alde Feanen National Park.\nWarten is the hometown of Olympic gold medallist Marit Bouwmeester (2016: Laser Radial sailing).\nHistory\nThe village was first documented in 1412 under the name Wartena. Its etymology remains unknown. Warten was originally a terp (artificial living mound) village in the early middle ages. Later, it developed into a canal village. The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1780 as a replacement of the medieval church. The tower was restored in 1880. The Oud Friese Greidboerderij is an old Frisian longhouse farm constructed around 1728 on a terp. It is one of the few remaining farms which is still in original condition.\nThe polder mill De Ikkers originated from the 18th century. In 1921, it was purchased and moved to Snikzwaag to remove excess water from the Broeksterpolder. In 1970, it was purchased, relocated to Warten, and restored, though it is no longer in service.\nIn 1840, Warten was home to 461 people. Until 2014, Warten was part of Boarnsterhim municipality and until 1984 it belonged to Idaarderadeel.\nNotable people\n* Marit Bouwmeester (born 1988), sailor\nGallery\nFile:Warten, kerk foto9 2011-04-23 16.58.JPG|Warten church\nFile:Plaatsnaambord Warten.JPG\nFile:Warten, direkteurswente fan it eardere molkfabryk.jpg|Farm in Warten.
