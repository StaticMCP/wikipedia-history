Gibbs Jr. Memorial Award for Excellence in Systematic Ichthyology for an outstanding body of published work in systematic ichthyology from the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists in 1991, and was honored at an international symposium on neotropical fishes in Brazil with an award for his \"Invaluable Contributions to Neotropical Ichthyology\" in 1997.\nTaxa named in his honor\nNumerous taxa have been named after Weitzman:\n*Lophiobrycon weitzmani R.
