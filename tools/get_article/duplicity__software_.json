Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), Duplicity is free software.\nDuplicity operates under a scheme where the first archive is a complete (full) backup, and subsequent (incremental) backups only add differences from the latest full or incremental backup. Chains consisting of a full backup and a series of incremental backups can be recovered to the point in time that any of the incremental steps were taken. If any of the incremental backups are missing, then the incremental backups following it cannot be reconstructed. It does this using GnuPG, librsync, tar. To transmit data to remote backup repositories, it can use SSH/SCP/SFTP, rsync, FTP, IMAP, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage amongst others. even more backends may be used via the Rclone backend.\nDuplicity works best under Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X), though it can be used with Windows under Cygwin or the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Currently duplicity supports deleted files, full Unix permissions, directories, and symbolic links, fifos, and device files, but not hard links.\nDéjà Dup is a graphical user interface for Duplicity.\nDuply is a shell frontend for Duplicity adding support for profiles and batch commands.\nSee also\n* List of backup software\n* Duplicati is a C# re-implementation of Duplicity\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://duplicity.us Duplicity home page]"
