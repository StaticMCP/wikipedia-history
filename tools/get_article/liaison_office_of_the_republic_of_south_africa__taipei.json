It also provides visa services. Its counterpart of Taiwan is the Taipei Liaison Office in the Republic of South Africa in Pretoria.\nThe Office is headed by a Representative.\nHistory\nThe Office was formerly the Embassy of the Republic of South Africa. South Africa first established a Consulate in Taipei in 1967, which was upgraded to a Consulate General three years later. In 1976, this was upgraded to an Embassy.\nHowever, when South Africa recognised the People's Republic of China, its diplomatic relations with Taiwan were terminated. This led to the establishment of the Office in 1998.\nSee also\n* South Africa–Taiwan relations\n* List of diplomatic missions of South Africa\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
