Elevations range between  along the James River's floodplain and  at the areas highest points.\nHardware River Wildlife Management Area is owned and maintained by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. The area is open to the public for hunting, trapping, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, boating, and primitive camping.
