He works at JamFactory and at his home studio with fellow glass artist and life partner Clare Belfrage.\nEarly life and education\nTim Edwards was born in 1967 in Millicent, South Australia.\nIn 1988 he started studying at Deakin University's art school in Warrnambool, where he graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor of Arts (Applied Art) degree, with major studies in ceramics and sculpture. In 1991 he received a graduate diploma in ceramics from the University of Tasmania in Hobart.\nIn 1992 he trained in ceramics with Stephen Bowers, before completing a traineeship in glass art with Nick Mount in 1996 (becoming the first artist in the JamFactory's history to undertake a second traineeship).\nHe has also undertaken training at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington, US.\nCareer\nEdwards worked as an artist at Blue Pony studio in Adelaide from 2001 to 2008.\nHe is closely affiliated with JamFactory, and  is senior technician and artist at its Glass Studio.\nFrom December 2024 to March 2025, his work was exhibited in a major JamFactory exhibition called Gathering Light, which was developed to coincide with Chihuly in the Botanic Garden, an outdoor exhibition of the work of Seattle glass artist Dale Chihuly in the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The exhibition also celebrated 50 years of glassblowing at JamFactory and the connections between the glass art communities of Adelaide and Seattle, in particular the Pilchuck Glass School. The work of six glass artists were displayed, the other five being Nick Mount, Liam Fleming, Kristel Britcher, Clare Belfrage, and Jessica Murtagh.\nPractice\nObserving natural objects, shapes, and patterns, Edwards draws in lead pencil or black pen, planning glass forms in the drawings. He first blows or shapes his work in the hot shop, and then carves, cuts or grinds the glass, using a lathe with diamond and stone wheels. He mostly creates vessels.\nHe has said:\nFor his 2022 prize-winning work Ellipse #8, he first spent about two hours blowing the piece, with help from assistants at JamFactory's Glass Studio. It then took him around 35 hours in his home studio \"grinding perfect ovals out of the glass using high-end German stone and diamond tools\".\nTeaching and other activities\nEdwards has taught in the United States at the Pilchuck Glass School, as well as the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine, and Ohio State University, where he was Scholar in Residence.\nHe has also written a number of articles and essays, which have been published in books and journals such as New Glass Review.\nRecognition and awards\n* 1997: Scholarship, Pilchuck Glass School, Washington, US\n* 1997: First prize,  Barbara Wallace Memorial Exhibition, South Australia\n* 2004: Short Notice Grant to attend SOFA Chicago (Sculpture Objects Functional Art and Design), from Arts South Australia\n* 2006: Rakow Commission from the Corning Museum of Glass (the second Australian to receive this major award)\n* 2007: Artist-in-residence at the Tacoma Museum of Glass.\n* 2018: A featured artist in the 2018 Adelaide Biennial, Divided Worlds\n* 2022: Tom Malone Prize, at the Art Gallery of Western Australia, for his work entitled Ellipse #8.\nIn addition, Edwards has received a number of grants from the Australia Council and Arts SA.\nPersonal life\nEdwards is married to Clare Belfrage, who is also an internationally acclaimed glass artist, and they have two sons.
