These were increased by concentrating 25 graves from the nearby Boeschepe churchyard in France.\nThe cemetery is named for the wartime aerodrome established in nearby fields although the cemetery itself contains no Royal Air Force graves.\nThe cemetery was designed by G. H. Goldsmith, who also designed Orient House in Manchester.\nNotable graves\nReference works point to two unusual inscriptions on gravestones in this cemetery. One asks the poignant question ''\"Old Pal, why don't you answer me\", whilst another, less unusually, is in Welsh and reads \"Arglwydd Dangos Ini Tad Digon Yw Ini\"''.\nCasualties by Units\nThis is a list of the 104 known casualties in the cemetery, Commonwealth and foreign casualties are given in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|Buffs: 14\n|Sherwood Foresters: 11\n|-\n|West Yorkshire Regiment: 11\n|King's Shropshire Light Infantry: 8\n|-\n|York and Lancaster Regiment: 9\n|Lancashire Fusiliers: 7\n|-\n|Royal Engineers: 7\n|Royal Field Artillery: 7\n|-\n|Cheshire Regiment: 7\n|Middlesex Regiment: 3\n|-\n|North Staffordshire Regiment: 3\n|Royal Army Medical Corps: 2\n|-\n|Royal Garrison Artillery: 2\n|Duke of Wellington's Regiment: 1\n|-\n|Queen's Royal Regiment: 1\n|Royal Irish Fusiliers: 1\n|-\n|South Wales Borderers: 1\n|King's Regiment: 1\n|-\n|Royal Irish Rifles: 1\n|Seaforth Highlanders: 1\n|-\n|Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers: 1\n|Highland Light Infantry: 1\n|-\n|King's Royal Rifle Corps: 1\n|Manchester Regiment: 1\n|-\n|Army Cyclist Corps: 1\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070303135635/http://www.wo1.be/ned/database/dbDetail.asp?subtypeID=19&typeid=6&ItemID=5859&lID=3 wo1.be]\n*"
