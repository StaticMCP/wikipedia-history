Founded in 2023, the federation advocates for the preservation of classical Taekwondo techniques, its ethical teachings, and its philosophical foundations, distinguishing itself from modern sport-oriented versions of the martial art. The GTTF emphasizes the martial art's historical aspects and its focus on personal development, rather than competitive success.\nBackground\nTraditional Taekwondo refers to the early form of Taekwondo that emerged in Korea in the mid-20th century, influenced by older Korean martial arts such as Taekkyeon and Hwa Rang Do, as well as by Japanese and Chinese martial traditions. While modern Taekwondo has evolved, particularly in the direction of sport and competition, Traditional Taekwondo is typically associated with the period before the martial art's inclusion in the Olympic Games, notably during the 1950s to 1970s, when it was primarily taught for self-defense, character development, and discipline.\nTraditional Taekwondo training includes five primary components:\n* Poomsae (Forms): Pre-arranged sequences of techniques to build muscle memory and express philosophical principles.\n* Kyorugi (Sparring): Controlled partner-based combat emphasizing timing, distance, and respect.\n* Ho Sin Sul (Self-defense): Practical techniques to defend against grabs, strikes, or weapons.\n* Kyukpa (Breaking): Demonstrating technique and power against inanimate targets, such as boards or tiles.\n* Dobok (Ethics/Morality): Studying and practicing virtues like integrity, perseverance, and respect.\nTraining takes place in a dojang (training hall), where students follow a strict hierarchy and observe cultural etiquette. The practice emphasizes mental discipline, respect, and personal growth.\nHistory\nThe GTTF was founded on May 16, 2023, by a group of Taekwondo masters concerned with the increasing focus on sport-oriented Taekwondo and the loss of traditional values in martial arts training. The federation was officially registered as a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, USA, on September 12, 2024, and recognized as a charitable entity by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe GTTF was created in response to the growing influence of World Taekwondo (WT), the international governing body of sport Taekwondo, which is focused on Olympic-style competition. Founding members, including practitioners and instructors from various countries, sought to revive the traditional aspects of Taekwondo, which they felt were being overshadowed by the emphasis on competition and speed in modern Taekwondo practices.\nGlobal Scope\nThe GTTF operates globally through affiliated dojangs and regional coordinators. Its organizational hubs are located in:\n* North America Headquarters: Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.\n* Asia Regional Office: Gwangmyeong, South Korea.\nThe federation supports local Taekwondo schools, organizes seminars, and hosts educational initiatives aimed at reinforcing traditional training principles.\nNotable Members\nThe GTTF includes several distinguished members who have made significant contributions to Taekwondo or other fields:\n* Samer Kamal – Olympic bronze medalist (1988 Seoul Games)\n* Herbert Perez – Olympic gold medalist (1992 Barcelona Games)\n* Yumnam Khemchand Singh – Government minister, India\n* Violeta Chávez – Multi-medalist in Pan American and international Poomsae events\n* Jaime De Pablos – Silver medalist, World Taekwondo Championships.\nReferences\n:Category:Games and sports introduced in 2023\n:Category:Culture of Korea\n:Category:Korean martial arts\n:Category:Mixed martial arts styles\n:Category:Sports originating in Korea\n:Category:Summer Olympic sports"
