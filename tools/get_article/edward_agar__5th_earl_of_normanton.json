On 25 November 1933, he succeeded his father as Earl of Normanton, Viscount Somerton, and Baron Somerton, all in the peerage of Ireland, and as Baron Somerton of Somerley in the peerage of the United Kingdom. The last of these gave him a seat in the House of Lords. From his father, he also inherited Somerley House in Hampshire and an estate of some 7,000 acres, and an art collection which included the Somerley Venus and Adonis by Titian.\nOn 13 November 1935, Normanton resigned his commission and transferred as a lieutenant from the active list to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. During the Second World War, he returned to the army and rose to the rank of Captain.\nHe died in 1967 aged only 56, without having planned for the inheritance tax on his estate, and as a result, his son owed 88 per cent of the value of the property for that.\nPrivate life\nOn 5 July 1937, Normanton married firstly Barbara Mary Prior-Palmer, a daughter of Sir Frederick William Francis George Frankland, 10th Baronet, and Mary Cecil Curzon, 17th Baroness Zouche. She was previously married to Otho Prior-Palmer, who in 1936 had successfully sued her for divorce on the grounds of her adultery with Normanton. They were divorced in 1943. On 30 October 1944, Normanton married secondly Lady Fiona Pratt, a daughter of John Pratt, 4th Marquess Camden, and Lady Joan Marion Nevill. She had previously been married to  Sir John Gerard Henry Fleetwood Fuller, 2nd Baronet and had two young sons, John Fuller (1936–1998)\nand Anthony Fuller (born 1940).\nWith his second wife, Normanton had two sons:\n*Shaun James Christian Welbore Ellis Agar, 6th Earl of Normanton (1945–2019)\n*Mark Sidney Andrew Agar (born 1948)\nNotes"
