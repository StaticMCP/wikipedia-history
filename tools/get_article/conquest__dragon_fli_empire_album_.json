Although the 2004 release is officially considered DFE's first album, there was a locally circulated CD-R version released in June 2002. The 2004 version replaced three tracks from the CD-R version with new ones: \"D-E-F\", \"From Under\" and \"Beauty Full 2.0\". The album is most notable for the popular track \"Mount Pleasant\", a song about Teekay's observations while riding Calgary Transit.\nMusic video\nOnly one video was made for the album. \"Beauty Full\" was filmed around Calgary in late 2002 and cameos are made by several emcees in Alberta's underground hip hop community.\nTrack listing\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!#\n!Title\n!Producer\n!Featured guest(s)\n!Time\n|-\n|1\n|\"Empire\"\n|Teekay\n|\n|1:05\n|-\n|2\n|\"Beauty Full\"\n|DJ Cosm\n|\n|4:36\n|-\n|3\n|\"D-E-F\"\n|DFE\n|\n|4:11\n|-\n|4\n|\"4U\"\n|Infinite P\n|Infinite P\n|4:16\n|-\n|5\n|\"All That\"\n|DJ Cosm\n|Curtis Santiago\n|4:10\n|-\n|6\n|\"Thoughtful Poet\"\n|DJ Cosm\n|Lingo\n|3:54\n|-\n|7\n|\"Mount Pleasant\"\n|DFE\n|\n|4:19\n|-\n|8\n|\"Speak to Me\"\n|Teekay\n|\n|4:11\n|-\n|9\n|\"From Under\"\n|DJ Nato\n|Chris Plus, Shortop\n|4:07\n|-\n|10\n|\"Language of Music\"\n|DFE\n|Curtis Santiago\n|4:31\n|-\n|11\n|\"Beauty Full 2.0\"\n|Teekay, Ohmega Watts\n|Ohmega Watts\n|5:12\n|-\n|12\n|\"Tower of Babel\"\n|DJ Cosm\n|\n|3:54\n|-\n|13\n|\"Conquest/Encore!\"\n|DJ Grub/Teekay\n|\n|8:34\n|}\nReferences"
