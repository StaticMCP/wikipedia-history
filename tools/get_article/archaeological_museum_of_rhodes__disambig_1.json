The museum is housed in the monumental edifice that was the hospital of the Knights of Saint John. Construction was begun in 1440 and brought to completion in the time of the Grand Master d'Aubusson (1476-1503). The Museum contains various collections of archaeological artifacts from various parts of Rhodes and the neighbouring islands, including the Statue of the Crouching Aphrodite (1st century BC), which was inspired by a famous prototype work created by the sculptor Doidalsas in the 3rd century BC, and the Pyxis of the Fikellura type (mid-6th century BC).\nThe museum also holds the Head of Helios, which was featured in 2011 on the album cover of Floral Shoppe by Macintosh Plus, and subsequently became famous for its association with the Vaporwave movement.\nGallery\nFile:Attic red figure pelike Rhodes.jpg|Attic red-figured pelike, from the tumb of an infant, featuring a man with a lyre and a woman with clappers\nFile:Head Helios AM Rhodes E49.jpg|Head of Helios, the god of the island of Rhodes\nFile:Crouching Venus in Rhodes.jpg|Aphrodite of Rhodes (Crouching Venus).\nFile:Bellerophon killing Chimaera (mosaic from Rhodes).jpg|A Hellenistic Greek pebble mosaic floor depicting Bellerophon riding Pegasus while killing the Chimera, dated 300–270 BCE\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174244/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh1560.jsp?obj_id=3312 Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism] / [https://web.archive.org/web/20100201010956/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/gh151.jsp?obj_id=3312 in Greek]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100216174705/http://old.mfa.gr/english/greece/through_time/archaeology/museums/archaeological_rhodes.html Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs]"
