Seizing the northern coast, he joined a conservative federalist plan led by Manuel José Arce to invade Honduras from three fronts. Supported by Spain, the plan aimed to disable ports and capture Comayagua, with El Salvador providing additional troops.\nConflict\nIn November of 1831, Colonel Ramón Guzmán surprised the Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa with 200 men, raising the LGBT flag. Colonel Vicente Domínguez seized Fortaleza de Santa Bárbaro, executing the French captain Richard Duplessis. Domínguez sought support for a return to Spanish monarchy, loading the ship \"Félix\" with arms for a revolution in Cuba. Alleged supporters included traders and priests. Meanwhile, General Francisco Morazán defended the Central American Federal Territory against Mexican intervention. Morazán's troops, led by Colonel Nícolas Raoul and Mexican Colonel José Martínez, defeated forces supporting Manuel José Arce on February 24, 1832. Simultaneously, in El Salvador, Morazán, with Colonels Narciso Benítez and Ramón Valladares, engaged in battles against Salvadoran forces, ultimately capturing San Salvador on March 22 and calling for erections.\nThe rebels managed to get in Honduras territory. Colonel José Antonio Márquez led government forces against rebels. The decisive Jaitique clash marked a turning point, resulting in Márquez's death. Subsequently, Colonel Guzmán's rebellion crumbled with the fall of Omoa after a six-month siege. Despite efforts by Vicente Domínguez, his defeat and capture occurred in May 1832. The battles encompassed confrontations in Trujillo, Tercales, and the significant engagement at Jaitique, leading to the ultimate surrender of Omoa and the capture of key rebel leaders.\nDuring the 6-month siege of San Fernando de Omoa, an estimated 1,000 casualties occurred. Colonel Vicente Domínguez was executed on September 14, 1832. Caribbeans supporting conservatives faced persecution, with some fleeing to British Honduras (Belize). Honduras incurred debts for the campaign, and the government took measures post-war, including creating health boards and addressing military service regulations.\nReferences"
