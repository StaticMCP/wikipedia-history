Northern Ireland has its own legislation.\nThe law is administered in England by Historic England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, in Scotland by Historic Environment Scotland and formerly by Cadw in Wales.\nProvisions\nAncient monuments\nSection 61(12) defines sites that warrant protection due to their being of national importance as 'ancient monuments'. These can be either scheduled monuments or \"any other monument which in the opinion of the Secretary of State is of public interest by reason of the historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching to it\". If an ancient monument is scheduled then it gains additional legal protection.\nA monument is defined as:\nDamage to a scheduled monument is a criminal offence and any works taking place within one require scheduled monument consent from the Secretary of State.\nThe Act also provides for taking ancient monuments into the care of the Secretary of State – the concept of 'guardianship' where an ancient monument remains in private ownership but the monument is cared for and (usually) opened to the public by the relevant national heritage body.\nAreas of archaeological importance\nThe Act (in Part II) also introduced the concept of areas of archaeological importance (AAI), city centres of historic significance which receive limited further protection by forcing developers to permit archaeological access prior to building work starting.  As of 2004 only five city centres, all in England, have been designated AAIs (Canterbury, Chester, Exeter, Hereford and York). Part II of the Act was never commenced in Scotland.\nAs the provisions in AAIs are limited compared with the requirements that can be made of developers through the NPPF, and formerly its predecessors in PPS5 and PPG16, AAIs have fallen out of use.\nReplacement in Wales\nThe act no longer has effect in Wales, its provisions having been repealed and replaced there by the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023.\nSee also\n*Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882\n*Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900\n*Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910\n*Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913\n*Ancient Monuments Act 1931\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/ancientmonuments.htm Historic Scotland Website] – a page about Ancient Monuments of Scotland, which also includes a downloadable copy of the Act."
