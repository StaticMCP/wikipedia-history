One night, after the husband has had plenty of shōchū to drink and is in bed, they strangle him and dump his body down a well. To avert any suspicions, Seki pretends her husband has gone off to Tokyo to work. For three years Seki and Toyoji secretly see each other. Their relationship has moments of intense passion, but the young man starts to distance himself from Seki. Finally, suspicions in the village become very strong and people begin to gossip. To make matters worse, her husband's ghost begins to haunt her and the law arrives to investigate her husband's disappearance.\nCast\n* Tatsuya Fuji - Toyoji\n* Kazuko Yoshiyuki - Seki\n* Takahiro Tamura - Gisaburo\n* Takuzo Kawatani - Inspector Hotta\n* Akyoshi Fujiwara\n* Masami Hasegawa - Oshin\n* Kenzo Kawarazaki\n* Tatsuya Kimura\n* Eizo Kitamura\n* Akiko Koyama - Mother of Landowner\n* Osugi - Dancer\n* Sumie Sasaki - Odame\n* Takaki Sugiura\n* Rinichi Yamamoto\n* Taiji Tonoyama - Toichiro\nRelease and honours\nEmpire of Passion was Japan's submission to the 51st Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee.
