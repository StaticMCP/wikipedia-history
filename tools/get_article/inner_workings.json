It is written and directed by Leo Matsuda and produced by Sean Lurie. It premiered in theaters on November 23, 2016 along with Walt Disney Pictures' Moana.\nPlot\nThe short follows the inner workings of Paul, a man living in California during the 1980s.  Paul's Brain, Heart, Lungs, Stomach, Bladder and Kidneys all awaken on a typical day for work. Heart expresses desires to try a large breakfast special at the urging of Stomach, play around on the beach, and try out a new pair of sunglasses at a stand that is run by an attractive sunglasses vendor named Kate. However, Brain simply wants Paul to get to work on time at Boring, Boring & Glum and avoid possible hazards that Brain thinks will kill Paul along the way. Fed up with Heart's constant sidetracked nature, Brain takes away Heart's control so that Paul can get to work on time. He and dozens of other employees sit at desks and enter data into their computers, moving simultaneously. Brain takes notice of the dreary routine of Paul's life and comes to realize that this cycle will eventually lead to his death as a miserable old man.\nDuring lunch, Brain gives control of Paul back to Heart, who sends him off to partake of the activities that Brain had passed up on the way to the office. Paul returns to work afterward, happy and content, and begins to dance to a lively beat whose energy quickly spreads to his coworkers and even to his elderly bosses. During the credits, Paul starts performing other fun activities with his bosses and coworkers, marries Kate, and has children with her.\nCast\n*Tucker Gilmore\n*Raymond S.

Leo Matsuda, a story artist on Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph, directed the film, which Sean Lurie produced. According to Matsuda, the film was loosely based on biological transparent overlays he read from Encyclopædia Britannica as a child.\nThe short combines hand-drawn and CG animation, using Walt Disney Animation Studios' 2D interpolation software Meander, which was employed before in their Oscar-winning shorts Paperman and Feast.\nMusic\nThe short's music was composed by Ludwig Göransson. The Miami Sound Machine-esque theme song \"California Loco\", featuring Este Haim, was released on Amazon.com on December 16, 2016.\nRelease\nInner Workings was released on November 23, 2016, along with Walt Disney Pictures' Moana and also included in The Animation Showcase 2016.\nSee also\n*Inside Out (2015)\n*Reason and Emotion (1943)\n*Osmosis Jones (2001)\n*Cranium Command (theme park attraction)\n*Cranium (board game)\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
