      "text": "# Talking Pictures (TV series)\n\nTalking Pictures is an occasional BBC Two television series which examines the lives and careers of well-known actors, as well as exploring various cinematic themes and genres. Episodes largely comprise interview clips from the BBC archives and vary in length between 30 and 60 minutes. With just two exceptions, the first 66 episodes were narrated by actress Sylvia Syms (2013–2019), following which the role was taken over by Celia Imrie (2020 onwards). Only three films, On the Waterfront, Spartacus, and The Silence of the Lambs have been the subject of episodes in their own right, although one episode was devoted to The Godfather trilogy. Episode 64 is notable in that it did not cover an aspect of the film-making industry itself, but rather was a look back at the career of film critic and longtime presenter of the BBC Film... programme, Barry Norman, who had died earlier in 2017.\nEpisodes\nSince the BBC does not group episodes into distinct series on the programme website, they are listed below in strict chronological order (according to the date when an episode was first shown). Episodes have been repeated on an ad hoc basis at fairly regular intervals, but the complete series (as it stands currently) has never been shown sequentially.\nbut, for reasons which are not entirely clear, was never actually shown - except, perhaps, in one or two regions. To the apparent dismay of some Potter fans, it seems to have been supplanted in the schedule by an episode of ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b094ndf8 Grand Tours of Scotland's Lochs]'' and was not given an alternative time slot. }} | Harry Potter\n| 61  | 16 December 2017 | Roger Moore\n| 62  | 17 December 2017 | Jane Fonda\n| 63  | 23 February 2017 | Bette and Joan\n| 64  | 30 December 2017 }} | Barry Norman\n| 65  | 30 March 2018 | Epics\n| 66  | 15 September 2019 | Westerns\n| 67  | 15 February 2020 | Rom Coms\n| 68  | 4 April 2020 | 70s Legends\n| 69  | 23 May 2020 | Joan Collins\n| 70  | 6 December 2020 | Christmas Classics\n| 71  | 28 December 2020 | Agatha Christie\n| 72  | 1 January 2021 | Great Dames\n| 73  | 30 May 2021 | War Stories\n| 74  | 12 June 2021 | Marvellous Musicals\n| 75  | 4 September 2021 | Film's Family Favourites\n| 76  | 2 April 2022 | Perfect Partners\n| 77  | 7 May 2022 | Meryl Streep\n| 78  | 30 December 2023 | Glenda Jackson\n| 79  | 4 January 2024 | Dustin Hoffman\n| 80  | 5 June 2025 | Spartacus (31 May – 6 June issue).}}\n| 81  | 21 August 2025 | The Silence of the Lambs\n| 82  | 28 August 2025 | The Godfather Trilogy\n| 83  | 11 December 2025 | Psycho\n}}\nLast updated 19 November 2025.\nTranscripts and downloadable subtitles of some episodes in SRT/ASS (SSA) format are available from the Subsaga website.\nNotes\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* .\n* ."
