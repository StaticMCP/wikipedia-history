MSDT considers interdependencies within and between the following scales: system level, time and information.\nMultiscale decision theory builds upon decision theory and multiscale mathematics. Multiscale decision theory can model and analyze complex decision-making networks that exhibit multiscale phenomena. The theory's results can be used by mechanism designers and decision-makers in organizations and complex systems to improve system performance and decision quality.\nMultiscale decision theory has been applied to manufacturing enterprise enterprises, service systems, supply chain management, healthcare, systems engineering, among others. In healthcare, for example, MSDT has been used to identify multi-level incentives that can improve healthcare value (quality of outcomes per dollar spent). The [http://www.msdm.ise.vt.edu/index.html Multiscale Decision Making Laboratory] at Virginia Tech directed by Dr. Christian Wernz is working at the forefront of MSDT theory and applications.\nMultiscale decision theory is related to:\n* Multiscale modeling\n* Decision analysis\n* Cooperative distributed problem solving\n* Decentralized decision making\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Filar, J., Vrieze, K., Competitive Markov Decision Processes, Springer, 1996.\n* Mesarović, M.
