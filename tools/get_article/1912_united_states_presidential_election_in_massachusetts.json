Voters chose 18 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMassachusetts was won by the Democratic nominees, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson and his running mate, Indiana Governor Thomas R. Marshall, marking the first time in history that the state had backed a Democrat for president. Opposing him were the Republican nominees, incumbent President William Howard Taft and Vice President James S. Sherman, and the Progressive Party candidates, former President Theodore Roosevelt and his running mate California Governor Hiram Johnson. Also in the running was the Socialist Party candidate, Eugene V. Debs, who ran with Emil Seidel.\nWilson won Massachusetts with a plurality of 35.53% of the vote, Taft came in second, with 31.95%, and Roosevelt came in third, with 29.14%, Wilson's margin over Taft being 3.58%. Debs came in fourth, with 2.58% of the total vote. In terms of margin, Massachusetts was about 11% more Republican than the national average.\nMassachusetts had long been a typical Yankee Republican bastion in the wake of the Civil War, having voted Republican in every election from 1856 through 1908. However, in 1912, former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt decided to run as a third-party candidate with his Bull Moose Party against incumbent Republican President William Howard Taft, splitting the Republican vote and allowing Woodrow Wilson as the Democratic candidate to win Massachusetts with a plurality of only 35.53% of the vote. Were Taft and Roosevelt voters united behind a single Republican candidate, they would have taken a combined majority of over 61% of the vote, but the split would instead prove fatal to the Republicans both nationally and in Massachusetts. As a result of Wilson's win, 1912 marked the first time in history that Massachusetts had ever given its electoral votes to a Democratic presidential candidate.\nTheodore Roosevelt finished strong for a third-party candidate with 29.14% of the vote, about 2% more than he received nationally, although Massachusetts was not amongst his strongest states. Nonetheless, Roosevelt's performance remains as of 2020 the best-ever third-party presidential performance in Massachusetts. The state's traditional Republican voters, especially in rural Western Massachusetts, proved to be mostly loyal to President Taft as the official Republican nominee. While Roosevelt came in second place nationally ahead of Taft, in Massachusetts, Taft beat Roosevelt and finished second behind Wilson.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1912 United States presidential election in Massachusetts\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Woodrow Wilson\n| align=\"right\" | 173,408\n| align=\"right\" | 35.53%\n| align=\"right\" | 18\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| William Howard Taft (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 155,948\n| align=\"right\" | 31.95%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#CCFF99; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Progressive\n| Theodore Roosevelt\n| align=\"right\" | 142,228\n| align=\"right\" | 29.14%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#CC0000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Socialist\n| Eugene V.

Taft's support was strongest in Western and Central Massachusetts, his most significant win being Worcester County, where he won with over 40% of the vote. Roosevelt was strongest in the southeast part of the state, his overall most significant win being Plymouth County, where he won with over 40% of the vote. Roosevelt's most populous county win was Norfolk County, although he only won it with a plurality of less than forty percent of the vote.\nHowever, Wilson was able to edge them out statewide by holding on to the Democratic base of support in the cities. Wilson's most important county victory by far was winning Suffolk County, home to the state's capital and largest city, Boston, winning it with over 40% of the vote. Wilson also won heavily populated Middlesex County with a plurality of less than 40% of the vote.\nWhile, due to vote-splitting, Massachusetts finally voted Democratic for the first time ever in 1912, this was not indicative of any long-term trend at the time. With the Republican base re-united in 1916, Massachusetts returned to the Republican column and remained solidly Republican until the 1928 election.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\nNotes\nReferences"
