Subsequently, major political and social changes have tended to break-down the historical continuity that had been a source of military tradition in many armies.\nIn the United Kingdom\nIn Britain, military traditions developed primarily along regimental lines, taking the form of  long-established regimental customs, insignia, badges and distinctive features of uniform. Since the late 1960s, a series of regimental mergers and disbandments have diluted British military tradition, although it still remains strong in the Guards Division.\nA French zouave from 1888 in the distinctive campaign uniform worn in North Africa. His trousers would normally be red.\nIn Germany\nIn Prussia and the German Empire, states relied on their own history to maintain military traditions, although some specific regiments within elite formations did maintain distinctive customs and items of dress.  For example, one regiment, the Potsdam Grenadiers, consisted of extremely tall men.\nIn France\nThe French created the concept of Esprit de corps, or the concept of pride in one's unit, within most elite or uniquely French units. North African units like the Zouaves, the tirailleurs, the French Foreign Legion, or even the Mamluks which served in Napoleon Bonaparte's Imperial Guard developed distinctive styles of dress. Many of these distinctive styles were later adopted by the French Metropolitan Army during the nineteenth century.\nIn Japan\nA traditional samurai warrior, circa 1860. Photograph by Felice Beato\nIn Japan, most military tradition was based on the bushido code.  Bushido, translated as 'way of the warrior' in English, was the strict code of military discipline adhered to by Samurai warriors.\nIn North America\nIn the United States, military tradition can refer simply to a father-son relationship or a much longer, ancestors-long line. Military tradition refers to the tradition in a family to systematically destine one of its sons for a military career. This tradition is associated with the Southern United States and is seen in a high representation of Southerners in the U.S. military today and throughout the nation's history.\nIn fiction\nMilitary Tradition is used in the strategy game ''Sid Meier's Civilization III, released by Atari, as a technological advance that allows the building of cavalry units.\nMilitary Tradition is a game concept in the strategy game Europa Universalis IV released by Swedish PC strategy game designer, Paradox Interactive. In the game, a player-controlled faction can accumulate Military Tradition by engaging in land battle. A higher Military Tradition value results in the ability to recruit generals and conquistadors of better quality.\nDistinct elements of a military culture are also present in many fictional publications. These are often used as an important element in shaping fictional culture by authors. Military fiction is a key component of the \"military and popular culture\" subfield.\nReferences"
