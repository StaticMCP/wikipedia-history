The elections were held during the 1860–62 civil war, but not in the parts of the country controlled by the Liberal Party, and the Liberal Party did not put forward a candidate in the remainder of the country. As a result, the election was a contest between two Conservative Party candidates, Pedro Alcántara Herrán and Julio Arboleda Pombo, with Julio Arboleda Pombo emerging as the winner with 73% of votes.\nResults\nReferences"
