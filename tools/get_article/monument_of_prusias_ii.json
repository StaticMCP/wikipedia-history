It has been restored  in situ. The monument has been identified through an inscription mentioning that it was dedicated  by the Aetolian League to honour king Prusias II of Bithynia, in northwestern Asia Minor:\n«».(To the king Prusias, son of king Prusias, the Aetolian League for his virtue and the benefactions he bestowed upon them).\nDue  to  this inscription it was also possible  to date the ex voto  after 182 BC, when Prusias II succeeded his father, Prusias I, on the throne of Bithynia.\nDescription\nThe monument consists of a tall base made of rows of rectangular blocks, whereas on its upper part it bears a decoration in relief depicting garlands and bucraniums; the decoration included  also  a low molding with supports (geisipodes). Its total  height reached 9.70 meters. At the top stood the statue of king Prusias on horseback. On the upper part  of the monument rows  of  rectangular slits are possibly  related to  the entire composition, as they might have been used  to fasten floral  motifs, such as crops, which probably alluded to  the benefaction of the king.  They could also have contained bronze blades aiming at protecting the monument against  the birds. The monument was similar to the pedestal the Monument of Aemilius Paullus, set up about 15 years later to the south of the entrance of the temple of Apollo, nowadays exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.\nBibliography\n*Miller, G.,(2000) \"Macedonians at Delphi\", in Jacquemin, A.
