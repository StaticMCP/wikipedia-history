It was a turning station of two lines operated by the Wilanów Railway, and one line of the Grójec Commuter Railway. It was opened in 1892, and in 1935, it was moved the intersection of Puławska and Odyńca Streets, where it operated until 1938.\nHistory\nIn 1892, next to the Union of Lublin Square, between Puławska and Chocimska Streets, was opened the Warszawa (Warsaw) narrow-gauge railway station. It was a terminal station of two lines operated by the Wilanów Railway, one to leading to Piaseczno, and other to station Warszawa Główna Wąskotorowa in the city centre. In 1898, there was also added a line of the Grójec Commuter Railway, leading to the Nowe Miasto nad Pilicą. In 1930, it was renamted to Warszawa (Mokotów), and in 1933, to Warszawa Mokotów, in reference to the nearby town of Mokotów. The station was moved in 1935 further south, to the intersection of Puławska and Odyńca Streets, where it operated until 1938. After that, its role was fulfilled by the Warszawa Południowa station.\nIn 1962, in the original location of the station was opened Supersam, a first supermarket in Poland. It was considered a notable example of the modern architecture in Poland. It was deconstructed in 2006, and in 2013, in its place was opened the\nPlac Unii skyscraper, that serves as an office building and a shopping centre.\nReferences"
