Fort Hartsuff was active from 1874 to 1881. Among its surviving original structures are the post headquarters, enlisted men’s barracks, officers’ quarters, commanding officers quarters, and post hospital; other buildings have been reconstructed.\nHistory\nFort Hartsuff was named in honor of George Lucas Hartsuff, a graduate of West Point who was wounded in action in 1855 during the Florida Seminole Indian War, and who also later rose to the rank of major-general of volunteers during the American Civil War.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://outdoornebraska.gov/forthartsuff/ Fort Hartsuff State Historical Park] Nebraska Game and Parks Commission\n*[http://outdoornebraska.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FortHartsuff.pdf Fort Hartsuff State Historical Park Map] Nebraska Game and Parks Commission\n* [http://forthartsuff.org/friends-of-fort-hartsuff/ Friends of Fort Hartsuff State Historical Park]"
