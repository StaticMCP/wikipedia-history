Most did not compete in elections, instead being splinters of previously existing parties. Ethnic and Islamist parties were officially banned after 1909, though Armenian political parties remained legal until 1915. While the Second Constitutional Era basically ended after 1912, new parties were founded during the Armistice Era and up until the end of the Ottoman monarchy.\nParties\nSecond Constitutional Era parties (1908–1912)\n* Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) – İttihad ve Terakki Cemiyeti/Fırkası (İTC/F).

The most powerful Young Turk faction before and after the revolution, it espoused centralism and secularism as the way to achieve Ottomanism. Following the revolution, it handedly won the election of 1908, and came under the control of the Activist wing of Mehmed Talat, İsmail Enver, Mehmed Nazım, and Bahaeddin Şakir. After rigging the 1912 election, the committee was forced out of government after a coup d'état that summer, but it took back control of the government after the Raid on the Sublime Porte in 1913.

A successor to the Private Enterprise and Decentralization Association, it served as an organized political party for the decentralists to compete in the 1908 general election.
