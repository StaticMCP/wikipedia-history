For example, the 6th Cavalry was also numbered the 70th Volunteer Regiment since it was raised between the 69th Infantry and the 71st Infantry, so there is no 70th Infantry.\n*1st Regiment\n*2nd Regiment\n*3rd Regiment\n*4th Regiment\n*5th Regiment\n*6th Regiment\n*7th Regiment\n*8th Regiment\n*9th Regiment\n*10th Regiment\n*11th Regiment\n*12th Regiment\n*13th Regiment\n*14th Regiment\n*15th Regiment\n*16th Regiment\n*17th Regiment\n*18th Regiment\n*19th Regiment\n*20th Regiment\n*21st Regiment\n*22nd Regiment\n*23rd Regiment\n*24th Regiment\n*25th Regiment\n*26th Regiment\n*27th Regiment\n*28th Regiment\n*29th Regiment\n*30th through 44th Regiment – See Pennsylvania Reserves section below\n*43rd Pennsylvania Militia Infantry Regiment\n*45th Regiment\n*46th Regiment\n*47th Regiment\n*48th Regiment\n*49th Regiment\n*50th Regiment\n*51st Regiment\n*52nd Regiment\n*53rd Regiment\n*54th Regiment\n*55th Regiment\n*56th Regiment\n*57th Regiment\n*58th Regiment\n*61st Regiment\n*62nd Regiment\n*63rd Regiment\n*66th Regiment\n*67th Regiment\n*68th Regiment\n*69th Regiment (Originally 2nd California)\n*71st Regiment (Originally 1st California)\n*72nd Regiment (Originally 3rd California)\n*73rd Regiment\n*74th Regiment\n*75th Regiment\n*76th Regiment\n*77th Regiment\n*78th Regiment\n*79th Regiment\n*81st Regiment\n*82nd Regiment\n*83rd Regiment\n*84th Regiment\n*85th Regiment\n*86th Regiment - failed to complete organization\n*87th Regiment\n*88th Regiment\n*90th Regiment\n*91st Regiment\n*93rd Regiment\n*94th Regiment\n*95th Regiment\n*96th Regiment\n*97th Regiment\n*98th Regiment\n*99th Regiment\n*100th Regiment\n*101st Regiment\n*102nd Regiment\n*103rd Regiment\n*104th Regiment\n*105th Regiment - The Wildcat Regiment\n*106th Regiment (Originally 5th California)\n*107th Regiment\n*109th Regiment\n*110th Regiment\n*111th Regiment\n*112th Regiment - See 2nd Heavy Artillery\n*113th Regiment - See 12th Cavalry\n*114th Regiment\n*115th Regiment\n*116th Regiment\n*118th Regiment\n*119th Regiment\n*120th Regiment - failed to complete organization\n*121st Regiment\n*122nd Regiment\n*123rd Regiment\n*124th Regiment\n*125th Regiment\n*126th Regiment\n*127th Regiment\n*128th Regiment\n*129th Regiment\n*130th Regiment\n*131st Regiment\n*132nd Regiment\n*133rd Regiment\n*134th Regiment\n*135th Regiment\n*136th Regiment\n*137th Regiment\n*138th Regiment\n*139th Regiment\n*140th Regiment\n*141st Regiment\n*142nd Regiment\n*143rd Regiment\n*144th Regiment\n*145th Regiment\n*146th Regiment - failed to complete organization\n*147th Regiment\n*148th Regiment\n*149th Regiment\n*150th Regiment\n*151st Regiment\n*152nd Regiment\n*153rd Regiment\n*154th Regiment\n*155th Regiment\n*156th Regiment - failed to complete organization\n*157th Regiment\n*158th Regiment\n*164th Regiment\n*165th Regiment\n*166th Regiment\n*167th Regiment\n*168th Regiment\n*169th Regiment\n*170th Regiment\n*171st Regiment\n*172nd Regiment\n*173rd Regiment\n*174th Regiment\n*175th Regiment\n*176th Regiment\n*177th Regiment\n*178th Regiment\n*179th Regiment\n*183rd Regiment\n*184th Regiment\n*186th Regiment\n*187th Regiment\n*188th Regiment\n*189th Regiment\n*190th Regiment\n*191st Regiment\n*192nd Regiment\n*193rd Regiment\n*194th Regiment\n*195th Regiment\n*196th Regiment\n*197th Regiment\n*198th Regiment\n*199th Regiment\n*200th Regiment\n*201st Regiment\n*202nd Regiment\n*203rd Regiment\n*205th Regiment\n*206th Regiment\n*207th Regiment\n*208th Regiment\n*209th Regiment\n*210th Regiment\n*211th Regiment\n*213th Regiment\n*214th Regiment\n*215th Regiment\n*Erie Regiment\nU.S. Colored Troops\n*3rd Regiment\n*6th Regiment\n*8th Regiment\n*24th Regiment\n*25th Regiment\n*32nd Regiment\n*41st Regiment\n*43rd Regiment\n*45th Regiment\n*127th Regiment\nPennsylvania Reserves\n*1st Reserves (30th Infantry) chemical combination truck decorated with American flags.
