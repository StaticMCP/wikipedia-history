The award recognizes the work of communities in using inclusive civic engagement to address critical issues and create stronger connections among residents, businesses and nonprofit and government leaders. Once called by the organization the \"Nobel Prize for Constructive Citizenship,\" it has been awarded to more than 500 communities across the country. The award is open to all American communities ranging from major cities and regions to towns, villages, counties, neighborhoods and tribes.\nSince the program's inception in 1949, more than 500 communities have been named \"All-America Cities\". Each year, interested communities submit a comprehensive package based on published criteria that are evaluated in the award selection process. Deserving communities are named as finalists, and the year's ten award winners are named from that pool of applicants. Representatives from the finalist communities then travel to Denver to present the story of their work and their community to a jury of national experts. The awards conference includes workshops on promising practices.\n, highlighting its award in 2001]]\n, New York, awarded in 1997 to mark its recovery from the decline of the 1960s–80s.]]\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.allamericacityaward.com/ The All-America City Program]"
