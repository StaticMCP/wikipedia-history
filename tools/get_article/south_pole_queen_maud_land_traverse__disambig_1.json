and for measurements of gravity, surface slope, and snow density, and for weather observations.\nThe surface slope was measured by scanning the horizon with a theodolite and recording the azimuth and vertical angle of the highest and lowest points.\nBeginning with SPQMLT-2, the ice thickness was profiled en route with a new radio sounder.\nAt the beginning and ending points, and approximately every 50 to 75&nbsp;km in between, a station was set up for the following work:\na vertical 40-m hole was bored into the ice,\nthe density and temperature of the ice at various depths in the borehole were measured,\nthe ice sheet was sounded seismically,\nthe accumulation rate was studied in hand-excavated 2-m pits,\nthe intensity and direction of the geomagnetic field were measured,\nsnow samples and ice cores were collected and analyzed,\nand the geographic position (latitude and longitude) and a geographic azimuth were determined by celestial (solar) observations with a theodolite.\nSPQMLT-1\nSPQMLT-1 began on December 4, 1964, at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station and, after traveling a zigzag route of 1530&nbsp;km, ended on January 27, 1965, at the unoccupied Pole of Inaccessibility Station.\nThe surface encountered varied from soft and smooth to hard and rough, with sastrugi over 1-m high.\nThe sky was often clear or patched with light cirrus clouds.\nSolar halos were observed frequently, and whiteouts occurred several times.\nThe average air temperature was &minus;28&nbsp;°C, with a maximum of &minus;18°C on January 5 and a minimum of &minus;45&nbsp;°C on January 26.\nThe greatest wind speed measured was 9&nbsp;m/s, on December 29 and January 17.\nOn January 8 two skuas were sighted.\nAt Pole of Inaccessibility Station a snow-accumulation stake net was installed and the vehicles were secured.\nOn February 1 personnel and cargo were airlifted to McMurdo Station.\nSPQMLT-2\nSPQMLT-2 began on December 15, 1965, at Pole of Inaccessibility Station (where SPQMLT-1 had ended the previous summer) and, after traveling a dogleg route of 1340&nbsp;km, ended on January 29, 1966, at the newly constructed Plateau Station .\nAt Pole of Inaccessibility Station a detailed map was drawn, the existing strain-rate and accumulation-stake networks were measured, and a 5-km accumulation stake line was installed.\nOn January 4 a heavily crevassed zone at  was encountered when a vehicle broke through a snow bridge and had to be retrieved.\nThe main crevasses were several tens of meters wide, 5 to 7&nbsp;km long, and oriented approximately east-west.\nThe crevassed zone is above a major anomaly in the bedrock topography, an abrupt rise of over 1200 m over a horizontal distance of less than 9&nbsp;km.\nTwo similar crevassed zones were spotted by aerial reconnaissance at approximately  and .\nAfter reaching Plateau Station, a strain network was installed, and all three vehicles were backloaded to McMurdo Station for reconditioning.\nSPQMLT-3\nSPQMLT-3 began on December 5, 1967, at Plateau Station (where SPQMLT-2 had ended nearly two years earlier) and, after traveling a dogleg route of 1326&nbsp;km, ended on January 29, 1968, at geographic position .\nAerial reconnaissance of the planned route showed no significant crevassing except near the end point.\nOn December 14, at 320&nbsp;km from Plateau Station, the traverse encountered a sled-mounted building, similar to the one at Pole of Inaccessibility Station, which was left by a Soviet traverse in March 1967.\nCairns built of empty fuel drums were erected at the sites of resupply airdrops.\nThe temperature ranged from −40&nbsp;°C to −10&nbsp;°C, and the wind rarely exceeded 18&nbsp;km/h.\nSevere whiteouts occurred during the final week of travel.\nTwo pickup flights, on January 30 and 31, airlifted personnel, equipment, snow samples, and one Sno-Cat to McMurdo Station.\nScientific Results\nSurface Elevation and Slope\nThe elevation (above sea level) of the surface along the routes of SPQMLT-1 and SPQMLT-2, based on the altimeter measurements, averaged  2780&nbsp;m and 3090&nbsp;m, respectively.\nOn SPQMLT-1 it ranged from 2628&nbsp;m at the second turning point () to 3718&nbsp;m at Pole of Inaccessibility Station.\nOn SPQMLT-2 it decreased from there to 2512&nbsp;m at the turning point (), from where it increased eastward (toward Plateau Station) at a gradient of 1 to 3 m/km.\nOn SPQMLT-3 the elevation ranged from 3625 m at Plateau Station to 2210 m at the ending point (). From Plateau Station to the turning point, the surface sloped downward with an average gradient of -0.5 to -1 m/km, and became much more negative on the southwest leg of the traverse. Two pronounced valleys, about 50 m deep and 10&nbsp;km wide, and several smaller valleys, were encountered near the end of the traverse.\nBased on the altimeter and slope measurements, the surface in the region of the traverse slopes downward to the west, toward the Weddell Sea, with a gradient of about -2 m/km.\nIce Thickness and Subglacial Topography\nThe elevation of the subglacial terrain, based on the seismic soundings, radio sounding (SPQMLT-2 and SPQMLT-3), and gravity measurements, ranged from nearly 1&nbsp;km below sea level to more than 1&nbsp;km above sea level.\nOn SPQMLT-1 and SPQMLT-2 the thickness of the ice averaged 2740&nbsp;m and 2770&nbsp;m, respectively.\nAccumulation Rate\nThe average rate of ice accumulation in the area of the traverse has been estimated at 3.7 g/cm2/yr with a method that involves profiling the radioactivity  in the core samples and identifying layers that correspond to a 1955 atmospheric atomic test.\nThis estimate is now considered to be more accurate than earlier estimates based on the pit studies.\nGeomagnetism\nThe measurements of the intensity and direction of the geomagnetic field were added to the database (now maintained by the National Geophysical Data Center) upon which are based the 1970 and subsequent World Magnetic Charts, World Magnetic Models, and International Geomagnetic Reference Field.\nThe measurements from SPQMLT-3 were compared to the (existing) 1965 World Magnetic Charts (corrected to 1968) and found to disagree on average by more than 1° in magnetic declination and magnetic inclination, and 500 nT in total intensity.\nSee also\n*South Pole Traverse (Goes from South Pole to Hut Point Peninsula (McMurdo))\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
