It served in the 1777 attacks on Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery, the Southern Campaign 1780–1781, the 1780 Siege of Charleston, the 1781 raids on Newport and Richmond, Virginia, and the 1781 Campaigns in Province of Georgia and East Florida.\nThe regiment was brought into the American Establishment, on March 7, 1781, and renamed the \"4th American Regiment of Foot\". The regiment later joined the British Regular Army, on December 25, 1782, possibly as the \"110th Regiment of Foot\", and was disbanded in British Canada in 1783.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.lib.unb.ca/collections/loyalist/seeOne.php?id=672&string= The Loyalist Collection, University of New Brunswick]\n* [http://www.royalprovincial.com/military/rhist/kar/kar1hist.htm History of the King's American Regiment, Parts 1-8 - On-Line Institute for Advanced Loyalist Studies]\n* [http://www.toriesfightingfortheking.com/ToryArmy.htm: Picture of King's American Regiment private and officer]"
