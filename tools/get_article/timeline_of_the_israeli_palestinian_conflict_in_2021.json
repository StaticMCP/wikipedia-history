The Israeli rights group B'Tselem called the demolition \"unusually broad,\" accusing Israel of seeking \"to forcibly transfer Palestinian communities in order to take over their land.\"\nApril\nClashes occur throughout April in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of Jerusalem where dozens of Palestinian families are threatened with eviction due to the long-running Sheikh Jarrah property dispute.\nMay\nMay 2\n2021 Tapuah Junction shooting: Muntasir Shalabi, a Palestinian-American dual citizen opened fire in a drive-by shooting in the Tapuach Junction in the West Bank, killing a 19 years old Yeshiva student named Yehuda Guetta, seriously injured a second teenager and lightly wounded a third.\nMay 5\nNegotiations to form a new Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu fail and Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid party is asked by President Reuven Rivlin to try form a government.\nMay 6\nThe rising tensions in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in recent weeks were confirmed as two Palestinians were killed in clashes with the Israel Defense Forces.\nMay 7\nOn 7 May, large numbers of police were deployed on the Temple Mount as around 70,000 worshippers attended the final Friday prayers of Ramadan at Masjid Al-Aqsa. After the evening prayers, some Palestinian worshippers began throwing previously stockpiled rocks and other objects at Israeli police officers. Police officers fired stun grenades into the mosque compound, and into a field clinic.\nMay 8\nMore clashes occurred on 8 May, the date of the Islamic holy night of Laylat al-Qadr. Palestinian crowds threw stones, lit fires, and chanted \"Strike Tel Aviv\" and \"In spirit and in blood, we will redeem al-Aqsa\", which The Times of Israel described as in support of Hamas. The Israel Police, wearing riot gear and some on horseback, used stun grenades and water cannons. At least 80 people were injured.\nMay 10\nA mosque spokesman stated that major clashes broke out after Israeli police attempted to evacuate the compound, where many Palestinians sleep over in Ramadan, adding that the evacuation was intended to allow access to Israelis. More than 300 Palestinians were wounded as Israeli police stormed the mosque compound. Palestinians threw rocks, firecrackers, and heavy objects, while Israeli police fired stun grenades, tear gas, and rubber bullets at worshippers. The storming came ahead of a Jerusalem Day flag march by Jewish nationalists through the Old City. At least 215 Palestinians were injured, 153 of whom were hospitalised. Militants in Gaza fired rockets into Israel the following night.\nThe same day, a video showing a raging fire on the al-Haram al-Sharif, caused by the conflagration of a tree near the Al-Aqsa mosque, began to circulate on social media. Below in the Western plaza, a packed group of Jewish Israelis chanted what Yair Wallach called \"genocidal songs of vengeance\" while cheering the flames with words from a song from Judges 16:28 in which Samson cries out before he tears down the pillars in Gaza, \"O God, that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!\"\nMay 11\n, Israel, 11 May]]\n.]]\nWidespread protests and riots intensified across Israel, particularly in cities with a large Arab population. the Mayor of Lod Yair Revivio urged Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to deploy Israel Border Police units to help quell the violence that saw the burning of three synagogues and dozens of cars in the city, saying that the city had \"completely lost control\" and describing it as \"near civil war\". Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod, marking the first time since 1966 that Israel had used emergency powers over an Arab community. Minister of Public Security Amir Ohana has implemented the emergency orders.\nOn 11 May, the 13-story residential Hanadi Tower in Gaza collapsed after being hit by an Israeli airstrike. The tower housed a mix of residential apartments and commercial offices. IDF said the building contained offices used by Hamas, and said it gave \"advance warning to civilians in the building and provided sufficient time for them to evacuate the site\"; Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired 137 rockets at Tel Aviv in five minutes. Hamas stated that they fired their \"largest ever barrage\". In addition, an Israeli state-owned oil pipeline was hit by a rocket.\nMay 12\nOver 850 rockets crossed into Israeli territory after being launched from Gaza, and another 200 fell inside the Hamas-run coastal enclave. Several rockets have made direct hits on buildings and cars in Israel, killing five Israelis.\nAn anti-tank guided missile fired from the northern Gaza Strip toward a target inside Israel near the community of Netiv Ha'asara, just north of the enclave.

The rocket that fell in the Hevel Eilot region, near Israel's southernmost city, Eilat, appears to be the longest-ranged projectile ever fired by Hamas into Israel. The rocket traveled some 250 kilometers into Israeli territory. Hamas launched a number of armed suicide drones from Gaza into southern Israel. One of these crash-landed in an open field, causing no injury or damage, as the aircraft was disarmed by a police sapper.\nOn 13 May three rockets were fired from the al-Rashidiya Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon across the Israeli–Lebanese border, landing in the Mediterranean Sea.

That same day, the Israeli Air Force launched a massive bombardment of Hamas' tunnel network as well as above-ground positions, reportedly inflicting heavy casualties. It was suspected that the reports of an Israeli ground invasion had been a deliberate ruse to lure Hamas operatives into the tunnels and prepared positions above ground to confront Israeli ground forces so that large numbers could then be killed by airstrikes. According to an Israeli official, the attacks killed hundreds of Hamas personnel, and in addition, 20 Hamas commanders were assassinated and most of its rocket production capabilities were destroyed. Also on 14 May, a Hamas drone was downed by Israeli air defense forces.

The Associated Press, which had used the building for 15 years, said they had never seen Hamas in the building.\nMay 16\nDuring the night 40 rockets were fired from Gaza towards Ashdod and Ashkelon, according to the IDF.

Numerous employers threatened to fire Arab workers who participated in the strike. The management of Rambam Hospital in Haifa sent letters to their Arab employees warning against participating in the strike, and the Ministry of Education came under heavy criticism from teachers throughout Israel after it sent requests to the principals of schools in Arab towns asking for a list of teachers who participated in the strike. There were some instances of employees who participated in the strike being unlawfully dismissed without a prior hearing as required under Israeli law. The Israeli telecommunications company Cellcom paused work for an hour as an act in support of coexistence. The move led to calls for a boycott of Cellcom among Israeli right-wingers who accused it of showing solidarity with the strike, and several Jewish settlement councils and right-wing organizations cut ties with it. Cellcom's stock subsequently dropped by 2%.\nMay 20\nIsrael and Hamas agree to implement a ceasefire beginning at 2:00am local time on May 21. Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi commends U.S. President Joe Biden for joint assistance in brokering the ceasefire.\nMay 21\nThe IDF reports the total count of targets hit in Gaza as 1500, and reports that 4360 rockets had been fired at Israel since the beginning of the 2021 Israel—Palestine crisis.
