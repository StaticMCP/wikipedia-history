It was removed from the town square in September 2020 and relocated to the private James H. Berry Park in July 2023.\nDescription and history\nPlaced in the center of Square Park, the  granite statue of a Confederate soldier standing at parade rest was placed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1908. A later plaque honors James Henderson Berry, a Confederate soldier with the 16th Arkansas Infantry Regiment who would later become the first Arkansas Governor from Benton County. The inscription reads \"They Fought For Home and Fatherland. Their Names are Borne On Honors Shield. Their Record Is With God.\".\nThe statue was manufactured in Barre, Vermont.\nAlthough the park was deeded to the United Daughters of the Confederacy for use as a park in perpetuity, the chapter had disbanded prior to 1996. Benton County took control of the park, and allowed the City of Bentonville to take over care and maintenance.\nThe monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996.\nIn September 2020, after years of controversy over Confederate monuments nationwide, the monument was removed from the Bentonville Square.\nIn February 2022, the Bentonville city planning commission announced a plan for the statue to be placed at a new park. The privately owned and operated park, named after James H. Berry, will feature the Statue and original base as the centerpiece, with the park located next to the Bentonville Cemetery. The new park opened in July 2023 and the statue is now back in public view.\nInscriptions\nNorth face:\nEast face:\nSouth face:\nWest face:\nMetal plate added to west face on January 30, 1914:\nSee also\n* 1908 in art\n* Downtown Bentonville\n* List of Confederate monuments and memorials\n* List of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
