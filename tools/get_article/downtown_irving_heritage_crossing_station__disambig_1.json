The station is located at the intersection of Rock Island Road and O'Connor Road in the Irving Heritage District, which includes the Irving Civic Center and the city's historic downtown.\nIn addition to the TRE, Downtown Irving serves seven bus routes (many of which connect to the  in Irving's Las Colinas district) and two microtransit service zones. The station features an indoor waiting area.\nHistory\nThe city of Irving was originally constructed along a rail corridor served by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. The historic Rock Island depot site was later rebuilt into South Irving Transit Center.\nTrinity Railway Express service to the transit center started on December 30, 1996. South Irving was the western terminus of the TRE until West Irving station opened in 2000.\nIn 2012, the city of Irving requested that South Irving station be renamed to emphasize the Heritage Crossing district. The change was applied on July 30 of that year, the same date that the Orange Line was extended to northern Irving.\nGallery\nFile:Irving June 2019 02 (Downtown Irving-Heritage Crossing station).jpg|TRE platform (2019)\nFile:DART S Irving Sta.jpg|DART buses and TRE awaiting departures (2007)\nFile:Darttresouthirvingsta.jpg|DART bus awaiting departure from South Irving (2007)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.dart.org Dallas Area Rapid Transit] - [https://www.dart.org/guide/transit-and-use/rail/rail-station-detail/downtown-irving-heritage-crossing-station Downtown Irving/Heritage Crossing Station]\n* [https://www.trinityrailwayexpress.org/ Trinity Railway Express] - [https://www.trinityrailwayexpress.org/stations/#dallascounty Dallas County stations]"
