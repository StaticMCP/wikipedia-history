The continental drift/ Airy-Heiskanen isostasy hypothesis had many flaws and scarce data. The fixist/ Pratt-Hayford isostasy, the contracting Earth and the expanding Earth concepts had many flaws as well.\nThe idea of continents with a permanent location, the geosyncline theory, the Pratt-Hayford isostasy, the extrapolation of the age of the Earth by Lord Kelvin as a black body cooling down, the contracting Earth, the Earth as a solid and crystalline body, is one school of thought. A lithosphere creeping over the asthenosphere is a logical consequence of an Earth with internal heat by radioactivity decay, the Airy-Heiskanen isostasy, thrust faults and Niskanen's mantle viscosity determinations.\nIntroduction\nChristian creationism (Martin Luther) was popular until the 19th century, and the age of the Earth was thought to have been created circa 4,000 BC. There were stacks of calcareous rocks of maritime origin above sea level, and up and down motions were allowed (geosyncline hypothesis, James Hall and James D. Dana). Later on, the thrust fault concept appeared, and a contracting Earth (Eduard Suess, James D. Dana, Albert Heim) was its driving force. In 1862, the physicist William Thomson (who later became Lord Kelvin) calculated the age of Earth (as a cooling black body) at between 20 million and 400 million years. In 1895, John Perry produced an age of Earth estimate of 2 to 3 billion years old using a model of a convective mantle and thin crust. Finally, Arthur Holmes published The Age of the Earth, an Introduction to Geological Ideas in 1927, in which he presented a range of 1.6 to 3.0 billion years.\nWegener had data for assuming that the relative positions of the continents change over time. It was a mistake to state the continents \"plowed\" through the sea, although it isn't sure that this fixist quote is true in the original in German. He was an outsider with a doctorate in astronomy attacking an established theory between 'geophysicists'. The geophysicists were right to state that the Earth is solid, and the mantle is elastic (for seismic waves) and inhomogeneous, and the ocean floor would not allow the movement of the continents. But excluding one alternative, substantiates the opposite alternative: passive continents and an active seafloor spreading and subduction, with accretion belts on the edges of the continents. The velocity of the sliding continents, was allowed in the uncertainty of the fixed continent model and seafloor subduction and upwelling with phase change allows for inhomogeneity.\nThe problem too, was the specialisation. Arthur Holmes and Alfred Rittmann saw it right . Only an outsider can have the overview, only an outsider sees the forest, not only the trees . But A. Wegener did not have the specialisation to correctly weight the quality of the geophysical data and the paleontologic data, and its conclusions. Wegener's main interest was meteorology, and he wanted to join the Denmark-Greenland expedition scheduled for mid 1912. So he hurried up to present his Continental Drift hypothesis.\nMainly Charles Lyell, Harold Jeffreys, James D. Dana, Charles Schuchert, Chester Longwell, and the conflict with the Axis powers slowed down the acceptance of continental drifting.\n* Abraham Ortelius  (cited in ), Francis Bacon (cited in ), Theodor Christoph Lilienthal (1756) (cited in , and in Schmeling, 2004), Alexander von Humboldt (1801 and 1845) (cited in Schmeling, 2004), Antonio Snider-Pellegrini , and others had noted earlier that the shapes of continents on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean (most notably, Africa and South America) seem to fit together (see also , and .).\n** Note: Francis Bacon was thinking of western Africa and western South America and Theodor Lilienthal was thinking about the sunken island of Atlantis and changing sea levels.\n*\n* Catastrophism (e.g. Christian fundamentalism, William Thomson) vs. Uniformitarianism (e.g. Charles Lyell, Thomas Henry Huxley) .\n** Term coined by William Whewell.\n** Uniformitarism is the prevailing view in the U.S. .\n* Charles Lyell assumed that land masses changed their location, but he assumed a mechanism of vertical movement . James Dwight Dana assumed a permanent location as well, influencing the American fixist school of thought . It wasn't known that the seafloor isn't mainly granite rock (sial) (as the continental cratons) but mainly basalt rock (sima).\n** Quote, Lyell: \"Continents therefore, although permanent for whole geological epochs, shift their positions entirely in the course of ages.\" ( cited in )\n** Quote, Wallace about Dana: \"In 1856, in articles in the American Journal, he discussed the development of the American continent, and argued for its general permanence; and in his Manual of Geology in 1863 and later editions, the same views were more fully enforced and were latterly applied to all continents.\" ( cited in )\n* Pratt's isostasy is the prevailing view :\n** Airy-Heiskanen Model; where different topographic heights are accommodated by changes in crustal thickness.\n** Pratt-Hayford Model; where different topographic heights are accommodated by lateral changes in rock density.\n** Vening Meinesz, or Flexural Model; where the lithosphere acts as an elastic plate and its inherent rigidity distributes local topographic loads over a broad region by bending.\n* A cooling and contracting Earth is the prevailing view.\n** H. Jeffreys was the most important contractionist ,  –\n* H. Wettstein , E. Suess, Bailey Willis and Benjamin Franklin allow horizontal move of the Earth's crust.\n**  . But Willis was a fixist, as he supported the permanent position of the oceans, although he didn't believe in land-bridges .\n**\n** Quote, Benjamin Franklin (1782): \"The crust of the Earth must be a shell floating on a fluid interior.... Thus the surface of the globe would be capable of being broken and distorted by the violent movements of the fluids on which it rested\".\n* The vertical movement of Scandinavia after the ice age is accepted (recent average uplift c.&nbsp;1&nbsp;cm/year). This implies a certain plasticity under the crust .\n** The alpine geology with its theory of thrusting (as geosyncline hypothesis; today's thrust tectonics) accepted horizontal movements.  cited in\n* 1848 Arnold Escher shows Roderick Murchison the Glarus thrust at the Pass dil Segnas. But Arnold Escher does not publish it as a thrust as it contradicts the geosyncline hypothesis.\n* Eduard Suess proposed Gondwanaland in 1861, as a result of the Glossopteris findings, but he believed that the oceans flooded the spaces currently between those lands. And he proposed the Tethys Sea in 1893. He came to the conclusion that the Alps to the North were once at the bottom of an ocean .\n* The idea of continental drifting shows up for the first time. John Henry Pepper merges Antonio Snider-Pellegrini's map, Evan Hopkins' proof of northward shifting of the continents of his neptunist book and his plutonism ( and  cited in ).\n* 1884, Marcel Alexandre Bertrand interpretes the Glarus thrust as a thrust.\n**\n* Hans Schardt demonstrates that the Prealps are allochthonous.\n**\n**\n**\n* 1907, resolution of the \"Highlands Controversy\": thrust faults get established: Lapworth, Peach and Horne working on parts of the Moine Thrust, Scotland.\n**\n**\n** Director-Generals of the British Geological Survey: Roderick Murchison (1855–1872) and Archibald Geikie (1881–1901)\n* Although Wegener's theory was formed independently and was more complete than those of his predecessors, Wegener later credited a number of past authors with similar ideas: Franklin Coxworthy (between 1848 and 1890), Roberto Mantovani (between 1889 and 1909), William Henry Pickering (1907) and Frank Bursley Taylor (1908).\n** 1912–1929: Alfred Wegener develops his continental drift hypothesis. (, )\n* In the 1920s Earth scientists refer to themselves as drifters (or mobilists) or fixists . Terms introduced by the Swiss geologist Émile Argand in 1924 .\n* Moreover, most of the blistering attacks were aimed at Wegener himself, an outsider (PhD in astronomy) who seemed to be attacking the very foundations of geology.\nControversy\n, Ladinian stage (230&nbsp;Ma).]]\nfossils (#1: South America, #2: Africa, #3: Madagascar, #4: Indian subcontinent, #5: Antarctica, #6: Australia).]]\nand a syncline.]]\n* 1912, Wegener presents his ideas at the German Geological Society, Frankfurt . Karl Erich Andrée (University of Marburg) must have delivered him some references. Strong points:\n** Matching of the coastlines of eastern South America and western Africa, and many similarities between the respective coastlines of North America and Europe.\n** Numerous geological similarities between Africa and South America, and others between North America and Europe.\n** Many examples of past and present-day life forms having a geographically disjunctive distribution.\n** Mountain ranges are usually located along the coastlines of the continents, and orogenic regions are long and narrow in shape.\n** The Earth's crust exhibits two basic elevations, one corresponding to the elevation of the continental tables, the other to the ocean floors.\n** The Permo-Carboniferous moraine deposits found in South Africa, Argentina, southern Brazil, India, and in western, central, and eastern Australia.\n** Flooded land-bridges contradict isostasy.\n** Note I: Wegener described in a sentence the seafloor spreading in the first publication only. But he believed it is a consequence of the continental drift ( in ). He abandoned this sentence probably under the advice of Emanuel Kayser, University of Marburg.\n** Note II: 'Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen' is one of the leading geographical monthlies of international reputation. ; Wladimir Köppen (father-in-law), , ,  and Kurt Wegener (brother), , ,  defended there the Continental drift hypothesis in a somewhat mirror controversy (in ).\n** Note III: Although the climate distribution was not always similar to nowadays. In the Carboniferous, coal mines are remains of the Equatorial Realm, glaciation remains are near the South Pole, and between glaciation and Equatorial Realm (centered between latitude 30° and the Tropic of Cancer and the Capricorn) there are remains of deserts (evaporites, salt lakes and sand dunes) . These are consequences of the evaporation rate and the atmospheric circulation.\n* 1912, Patrick Marshall uses the term \"andesite line\".\n* 1914, the idea of a strong outer layer (lithosphere), overlying a weak asthenosphere is introduced .\n* H. Jeffreys and others, most important criticisms , :\n** Continents can not \"plow\" through the sea, because the seafloor is denser than the continental crust.\n** Pole-fleeing force is too weak to move continents and produce mountains.\n*** Paul Sophus Epstein calculated it to be one millionth of the gravity.\n** If the tidal force moves continents, than the Earth's rotation would stop after only one year.\n*\n** Its opening sentence is Galileo's allegedly muttered rebellious phrase And yet it moves.\n** Quote: \"Daly,..., seeks to substitute sliding for drifting, assuming that broad domes or bulges form at the earth's surface, and on the flanks of these domes the continental masses slide downward, moving over hot basaltic glass as over a lubricated floor\". (pp.&nbsp;170–291)\n* By the mid-1920s, A. Holmes had rejected contractionism and he had introduced a model with convection , , , .\n** Note: in a way, not only A. Wegener ( in ) but A. Holmes and K. Wegener suggested seafloor spreading as well. ( in ), ( in )\n* The Alps were and still are the best investigated orogen worldwide. Otto Ampferer (Austrian Geological Survey) rejected contractionism 1906 and he defended convection, locally only at first. Otto Ampferer even used the word swallowed in a geological sense. The Geological Society Meeting in Innsbruck, held on 29 August 1912, changed a paradigm (T. Termier words, the acceptance of nappes and thrust faults). So that Émile Argand (1916) speculated that the Alps were caused by the North motion of the African shield, and finally accepted this reason 1922, following Wegener's Continental drift theory ( as ). Otto Ampferer in the meantime, at the Geological Society Meeting in Vienna, held on 4 April 1919, defended the link between the alpine faulting and Wegener's continental drift.\n** Quote, translation: \"The Alpine orogeny is the effect of the migration of the North African shield. Smoothing only alpine folds and nappes on the cross section between the Black Forest and Africa once again, then from the present distance of about 1,800&nbsp;km, we have an initial gap of around 3,000 to 3,500&nbsp;km, ie. a pressing of the alpine region, alpine region in a broader sense, of 1,500&nbsp;km. To this amount must be Africa have moved to Europe. This brings us then to a true large scale continental drift of the African shield\".  cited in\n* W.A.J.M. van Waterschoot van der Gracht, Bailey Willis, Rollin T. Chamberlin, John Joly, G.A.F.
