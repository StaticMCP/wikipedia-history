The instrumental \"Dunluce\" is named after Dunluce Castle in Northern Ireland.\nOn \"Led Clones\", Ozzy Osbourne, with whom Moore had worked before the singer united with Randy Rhoads, shares lead vocals. The song pokes fun at bands such as Kingdom Come which were popular at the time, and is based on a Led Zeppelin-type sound and image. \"That song was great fun,\" Ozzy recalled, \"and it was an honour to record with Gary.\" The Sisters of Mercy frontman, Andrew Eldritch, provides backing vocals on the songs \"After the War\", \"Speak for Yourself\" and \"Blood of Emeralds\". Moore again pays tribute to the memory of his long-time friend and colleague Phil Lynott with the song \"Blood of Emeralds\".\nAfter the War'' was Moore's last foray into conventional hard rock, and his last rock album of any kind until Dark Days in Paradise in 1997. Starting with his next album, Still Got the Blues, he primarily played blues.\nAlthough Cozy Powell played drums on the album, he was replaced by Chris Slade for the tour, as he was set to tour with Black Sabbath, in support of the album, Headless Cross, on which he also played drums.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Musicians\n*Gary Moore&nbsp;– guitars, lead vocals\n*Neil Carter&nbsp;– keyboards, backing vocals\n*Bob Daisley&nbsp;– bass guitar\n*Cozy Powell&nbsp;– drums\n*Don Airey&nbsp;– keyboards on \"The Messiah Will Come Again\", \"Running from the Storm\" and \"This Thing Called Love\"\n*Laurence Cottle&nbsp;– bass guitar on \"The Messiah Will Come Again\"\n*Steve Piggott - sequencer bass on \"Ready for Love\"\n*Charlie Morgan&nbsp;– drums on \"After the War\"\n*Simon Phillips&nbsp;– drums on \"Speak for Yourself\" and \"Blood of Emeralds\"\n*Brian Downey&nbsp;– drums on \"Emerald\"\n*Chris Thompson&nbsp;– backing vocals on \"After the War\", \"Led Clones\" and \"Ready for Love\"; violin on \"Led Clones\"\n*Ozzy Osbourne&nbsp;– co-lead vocals on \"Led Clones;\" backing vocals on \"Speak for Yourself\"\n*Andrew Eldritch&nbsp;– backing vocals on \"After the War\", \"Speak for Yourself\" and \"Blood of Emeralds\"\n*Sam Brown, Miriam Stockley&nbsp;– backing vocals on \"Ready for Love\"\n;Production\n*Peter Collins&nbsp;– producer\n*Duane Baron&nbsp;– mixing\n*Ian Taylor&nbsp;– engineer, mixing\n*Steve Barnett, Stewart Young, Hard to Handle – management\nCharts\nAlbum\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\"|Year\n!align=\"center\"|Chart\n!align=\"center\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"10\"|1989\n|align=\"center\"|German Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Finnish Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Norwegian Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Swedish Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Swiss Albums Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|New Zealand Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |Japanese Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\" |16\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Dutch MegaCharts\n|align=\"center\"|17\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|UK Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (US)\n|align=\"center\"|114\n|}\nSingles\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Single\n!Chart\n!Position\n|-\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"10\"|1989\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"7\"|\"After the War\"\n|align=\"center\"|Norwegian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Finnish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Swedish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Irish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Swiss Singles Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|17\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|New Zealand Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|37\n|-\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|\"Ready for Love\"\n|align=\"center\"|Mainstream Rock Tracks (US)\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| Finnish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|56\n|}\nSales and certifications\nSee also\n* List of anti-war songs\nReferences"
