Both men and women, soldiers, nurses, civilians and even children wrote poetry about the war. There were five main arenas where Australian Great War Poetry was written in the period of 1914 to 1939: the Home Front, Gallipoli, The Middle East, The Western Front and England. Australian poets weren't as well established as their British counterparts, however, in their poetry, they too expressed humorous, melancholy, anger or longing for home. Many Australian servicemen, for example, wrote about the Australian flora, and how they missed it.\nSoldiers\nMany poets served in more than one campaign, while others only served in one, either joining up after Gallipoli, or being invalided back home or killed in action. A small listing of Australian Great War Poets can be seen below.\n* Leon Gellert\n* Frank Westbrook\n* Oliver Hogue writing as Trooper Bluegum\n* Tom Skeyhill\n* Frederic Manning\n* Edwin Gerard\n* Geoffrey Wall\n* Walter James Redfern Turner\n* William McDonald\n* Ion Idriess\n* Andrew Barton Paterson and many others.\nNurses\n* Christine Erica Strom\n* Alice Ross-King\n* Emily 'Beryl' Henson.\nCivilian men\n* Archibald Strong\n* Arthur Henry Adams\n* Bernard Patrick O’Dowd\n* C.J.
