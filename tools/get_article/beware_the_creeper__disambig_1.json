This series was cancelled after six issues. The second was a five-issue limited series published in 2003 by DC under their Vertigo imprint.\n1968 series\nBeware the Creeper #1, art by Steve Ditko.\nBeware the Creeper began in the March/April dated, Showcase #73 in 1968, in a story plotted and drawn by Steve Ditko, with Don Segall assisting with the dialog. DC's policy at the time was to give a character a single appearance in Showcase as an introduction before launching their series. Two months later, the first issue of Beware the Creeper was released with a cover date of June 1968.\nBeware the Creeper was cancelled after six issues, the victim, per columnist and artist Fred Hembeck, of \"bean-counters [who] were a little quick to yank the rug out from underneath a new series during that particular stage of DC's history....\"\nThe storyline started in the six issues of Beware the Creeper would eventually be concluded seven years later in Super-Team Family #2, published in 1975.\nCreators\n* Denny O'Neil - writer\n* Steve Ditko - penciller and inker (co-writer issue #1)\n* Mike Peppe - inker (issues #5 and #6)\n* Jack Sparling - penciller (pages #12-24 of issue #6)\n2003 series\nBeware the Creeper #1, art by Cliff Chiang.\nWith no obvious connection to the original series (though with subtle ties to DC Universe continuity), DC released Beware the Creeper, a five issue limited series, under their Vertigo imprint in 2003.\nSet in 1925 Paris, Beware the Creeper tells the story of Judith and Madeline Benoir, twin sisters, one a surrealist painter, the other a playwright.\nPlot\nAfter Judith is beaten by Mathieu Arbogast, a man from a rich upper-class family, a woman calling herself the Creeper begins to terrorize the Arbogast family. The Creeper uses methods that appear to be based out of the surrealist movement.\nThe situation quickly spirals out of control as the Arbogasts begin to seek revenge in turn, and lives are eventually lost.\nThere is also a major sub-plot involving Ric Allain, the inspector in charge of the Creeper investigation. He is in love with Judith based on letters sent to him while he was fighting in the Great War. Unbeknownst to him, Madeline wrote the letters but was too shy to sign them, instead having Judith sign them for her.\nCreators\n* Jason Hall - writer\n* Cliff Chiang - penciller and inker\n* Dave Stewart - colourist\n* John Workman - letterer\nNotes\nReferences\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/creeper.htm Toonopedia listing for The Creeper mentioning 1968 series]\n* [http://www.hembeck.com/Covers/Creeper1.htm Hembeck.com overview of the 1968 series]\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070331101950/http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/snapjudgments/041403/bewarethecreeper1.shtml The FourthRail review of first issue of 2003 series]\n* [http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/10523770579702.htm Comicsbulletin.com review of first issue of 2003 series]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040334/http://www.comicreaders.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=224 Comic Readers review of first issue of 2003 series]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061214150417/http://www.thexaxis.com/misc/bewarethecreeper1.htm The X Axis review of first issue of 2003 series]"
