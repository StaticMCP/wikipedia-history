Its candidate was secretary-general Manoel Antonio de Oliveira Horta, who received 0.1% of the votes in the first round.\nIn November 1989, members of the party took part in the foundation of the Labour Party of Brazil (PTdoB), now called Avante. In April 1990, the PDC do Brasil, the PTdoB and the Brazilian People's Party had their merger request denied by the Superior Electoral Court, as parties with provisional registration were not allowed to merge.\nThe registration of the party expired later in 1990.\nReferences"
