There are special theme issues such as Corona Times, focusing on COVID-19, or Fempire Times, which is written primarily or exclusively by women.\nCollaborations\nEmpire Times has done collaborative issues with other student newspapers.\nIn 1973, Dit ego times was a joint publication between University of Adelaide's student newspaper On Dit, South Australian Institute of Technology’s student newspaper Egois, and Empire Times.\nIn 2022, On Dit collaborated with Empire Times to produce OnDit x Empire Times, both producing issues to circle around their content censorship for each other's restrictions respectively.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
