It landed in France in November 1915. Major-General Reginald Barnes took command of the division for a short while in November 1916 before being replaced by the controversial Major-General Cameron Shute.\nThe division was raised from volunteers for Lord Kitchener's New Armies, made up of infantry 'Pals battalions' and artillery brigades raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the War Office in September 1915. It served in France and Belgium in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war. It saw action at the Battle of the Somme, the Pursuit to the Hindenburg Line, the Defence of Nieuport, the German spring offensive, and the Allied  Hundred Days Offensive beginning at the Battle of Amiens.\nOrder of Battle\nThe following units and formations served with the division during the war:\n, VC, killed in action 4 June 1918 while in command of 14th Brigade; posthumous portrait by H.
