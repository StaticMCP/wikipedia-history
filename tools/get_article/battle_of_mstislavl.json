The Lithuanian forces were defeated.\nThe Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars renewed in 1500. In 1501, Ivan III of Russia sent a new force under the command of  towards Mstislavl. Local princes Mstislavsky together with Ostap Dashkevych organized the defense and were badly beaten on 4 November. They retreated to Mstislavl and Mozhayskiy decided not to attack the castle. Instead, Russian forces besieged the city and pillaged surrounding areas.\nLithuanians organized a relief force, brought by Great Hetman Stanislovas Kęsgaila. Neither Mozhayskiy nor Kęsgaila dared to attack and the Russian forces retreated without a battle.\nThe main task of the Russians was to prevent the joint military actions of the entire coalition (Lithuania, Livonia and the Great Horde) against Muscovy, as a result of defeating a large group near Mstislavl this task was successfully completed.\nReferences\n}}"
