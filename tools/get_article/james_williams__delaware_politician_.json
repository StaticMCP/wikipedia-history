He was a member of the Democratic Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as U. S. Representative from Delaware.\nEarly life and family\nWilliams was born on August 4, 1825, in Philadelphia, to John (1775–1849) and Esther Williams. His father was a lumber merchant, and his early education was by private tutoring. He first became an apprentice carpenter, intending to become an architect. In 1848 his father bought a large estate in Kent County, Delaware and young Williams moved to Kenton to take up farming and manage the property.\nProfessional and political career\nWilliams became politically active in the Democratic Party, and was elected to the Delaware House of Representatives, serving in 1857/1858, 1863/1864 and 1883/84. He next served in the State Senate from 1891/92, and was the Speaker of the Senate for 1869/70. In 1872, he was a delegate to the party's national convention which nominated Horace Greeley for U.S. president. Williams was twice elected as Delaware's only member in the United States House of Representatives, serving in two terms from 1875 until 1879, in the 44th and 45th Congress under U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes.\nHe remained a farmer throughout his public service. After returning to private life he expanded into fertilizer manufacturing, and increased his farm holdings in Delaware and Maryland. In 1891 he moved to Smyrna, Delaware, but continued farming for the rest of his life.\nDeath and legacy\nWilliams died on April 12, 1899, in Smyrna, Delaware, and is buried there, at the St. Peter's Episcopal Church Cemetery.\nElectoral history\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width: 94%\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"\n|-bgcolor=#cccccc\n!colspan=7 style=\"background: #ccccff;\" |Public Offices\n|-\n!
