As a way to stay active musically, he approached rapper Eddie Wellz to do a cover of Linkin Park's \"Lying from You\" after seeing a video of Wellz performing on YouTube. Due to positive reception, Ramey approached previous members of The Bad Chapter; Trevor Norgren and later Staig Flynn and Rob Sebastian and previous bandmates Chucky Guzman and Tre Scott from We The Collectors to form a new band called Phoenix Down, which by 2017 had changed its name to Dropout Kings.\nOn April 6, 2018, it was announced that Dropout Kings signed with Napalm Records, & the band released the music video for '\"NVM\", their first single from their debut album AudioDope the same day.
