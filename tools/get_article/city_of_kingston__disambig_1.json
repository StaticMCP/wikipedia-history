It covers an area of  and has an estimated population of 167,228 people.\nWith 13&nbsp;km of coastline abutting Port Phillip, the city has been described as becoming a 'lifestyle capital' of Melbourne, where the municipality features Moorabbin Airport, DFO Moorabbin and Westfield Southland, with two AFL facilities for the respective teams of Hawthorn Football Club and St Kilda Football Club.\nHome to a number of golf courses including hosts of international tournaments, such as the World Cup of Golf, Australian Open, Australian Masters and in 2028 the Presidents Cup; the city is dotted by parkland and reserves aside from the expansive 2,070 hectare Green Wedge. Braeside Park, Karkarook Park and Patterson River are all managed through Parks Victoria, with the latter providing access to Port Phillip being the busiest boat launching facility in Victoria.\nHistory\nin Cheltenham.]]\nThe City of Kingston area was originally governed by the Moorabbin Roads Board, which formed in 1862 and became a shire council in 1871, covering a large area of mixed agricultural and semi-urban land. After years of agitation in 1917 the seaside town of Sandringham became a borough with its own council, and this fuelled the desire of those living in towns further south to combine their efforts and demand self-representation. This finally occurred in May 1920 and the 'Borough of Mordialloc and Mentone' was formed. It became a town in 1923 and the City of Mordialloc in 1926.\nThe City of Moorabbin had a population of 109,588 by the time of the 1971 census.\nIn 1994, the state government amalgamated local councils all over Victoria, as part of its local government reform.  The new City of Kingston was one result, and on 15 December 1994 the city was formally gazetted comprising all of the City of Chelsea, most of the City of Mordialloc, a substantial portion of the City of Moorabbin, and parts of the cities of Oakleigh and Springvale. The City of Kingston headquarters opened at 34 Brindisi Street, Mentone that remains a property portfolio asset.\nAn electoral structure for Kingston was introduced in November 2008 to include three wards – North Ward, Central Ward and South Ward, with three Councillors representing each ward. This made a total of nine Councillors instead of the previous structure of seven wards each represented by one Councillor. Further electoral structure changes led to in November 2020 there being a total of 11 wards each individually represented by a Councillor.\nKingston's headquarters since 2005 have been in Cheltenham at the former 7-storey office of Fujitsu Australia built in 1993.\nEducation\nPrimary education\nSecondary education\nPrimary and secondary education\n* Mentone Girls' Grammar School\n* Mentone Grammar School\nTechnical and further education\n*Holmesglen Institute of TAFE\nTownships and localities\nThe city had a population of 158,129 at the 2021 census, up from 151,389 in the 2016 census.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Population\n|-\n!
