The two schools are located about 110 miles from each other (Southern Miss in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Tulane in New Orleans, Louisiana) via Interstate 10 and Interstate 59, making for a heated game.\nThrough the teams' most recent meeting in September 2023, Southern Miss holds a 24–10 lead in the series.\nHistory\nThe two teams played annually from 1979 through 2006; both programs were independent through 1995, and both competed as members of Conference USA (C-USA) starting in 1996. In 1999, the series became a trophy game with the addition of the Bell. Following a reconfiguration of  in 2006,  the teams no longer met annually; they played in 2009 and 2010 as a cross-divisional conference match-up. The series then went on hiatus due to Tulane's move to the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in July 2014.\nOn April 13, 2017, the schools announced a return of the rivalry—a four-game football series between 2022 and 2027, the first game scheduled for Yulman Stadium in New Orleans.\nPrior to the regular-season series resuming, the two teams met in the 2020 Armed Forces Bowl (January) played in Fort Worth, Texas, which was a 30–13 Tulane victory. The bell trophy, which had been in the possession of Southern Miss since 2003, was transferred to the Green Wave after the game.\nGame results\n| team2          = Tulane\n| team2style     =\n| October 13, 1979   | Hattiesburg | Tulane            | 20 | Southern Miss | 19\n| September 6, 1980  | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 17 | Tulane        | 14\n| September 19, 1981 | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 21 | Tulane        | 3\n| October 16, 1982   | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 22 | Tulane        | 10\n| October 22, 1983   | Hattiesburg | Tulane            | 14 | Southern Miss | 7\n| October 13, 1984   | New Orleans | Tulane            | 35 | Southern Miss | 7\n| November 23, 1985  | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 24 | Tulane        | 6\n| October 25, 1986   | New Orleans | Tulane            | 35 | Southern Miss | 20\n| September 19, 1987 | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 31 | Tulane        | 24\n| October 8, 1988    | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 38 | Tulane        | 13\n| October 7, 1989    | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 30 | Tulane        | 21\n| October 13, 1990   | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 20 | Tulane        | 14\n| October 19, 1991   | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 47 | Tulane        | 14\n| October 15, 1992   | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 17 | Tulane        | 7\n| November 6, 1993   | Hattiesburg | Tulane            | 17 | Southern Miss | 15\n| September 3, 1994  | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 25 | Tulane        | 10\n| September 30, 1995 | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 45 | Tulane        | 0\n| October 26, 1996   | New Orleans | #24 Southern Miss | 31 | Tulane        | 28\n| October 25, 1997   | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 34 | Tulane        | 13\n| October 3, 1998    | New Orleans | #25 Tulane        | 21 | Southern Miss | 7\n| September 6, 1999  | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 48 | Tulane        | 14\n| October 14, 2000   | New Orleans | #16 Southern Miss | 56 | Tulane        | 24\n| November 17, 2001  | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 59 | Tulane        | 6\n| November 23, 2002  | New Orleans | Tulane            | 31 | Southern Miss | 10\n| November 15, 2003  | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 28 | Tulane        | 14\n| September 25, 2004 | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 32 | Tulane        | 14\n| November 26, 2005  | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 26 | Tulane        | 7\n| November 11, 2006  | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 31 | Tulane        | 3\n| October 24, 2009   | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 43 | Tulane        | 6\n| November 6, 2010   | New Orleans | Southern Miss     | 46 | Tulane        | 30\n| January 4, 2020 | Fort Worth, TX | Southern Miss  | 13 | Tulane | 30\n| September 26, 2020 | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss     | 24 | Tulane | 66\n| September 24, 2022 | New Orleans | Southern Miss  |  27| Tulane | 24\n| September 16, 2023 | Hattiesburg | Southern Miss  |  3| Tulane | 21\n| footnote =\n}}\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\nReferences"
