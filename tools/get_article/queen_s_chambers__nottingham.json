Edward Skipwith was a long-standing merchant operating from premises on Long Row, and he rebuilt this building as he retired, possibly as a retirement investment. It comprised 4 shops with offices above.\nIn 1993 the building underwent a £500,000 refurbishment lasting six months by Thomas Fish. This project won the 1993 Lord Mayor's Urban Design Award.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Nottingham (Bridge ward)\nReferences"
