Initially, it was supposed to be set in Canada and was unsuccessfully pitched to local broadcasters as Queen of Canada. Tate then decided to move the setting to Australia after touring there with The Catherine Tate Show in late 2018.\n]]\nQueen of Oz was one of a number of commissions announced at the BBC's annual Edinburgh International Television Festival panel on 25 August 2022. It was reported that the six-part sitcom, written by Tate and Jeff Gutheim and directed by Christiaan Van Vuuren, will be produced by the Australian production company Lingo Pictures and filmed at the end of 2022. Producer Michele Bennett described Queen of Oz as a \"fabulously witty series\" and a \"riotous take on royalty in Australia\".\nFilming\nmansion, where much of the series was filmed|left]]\nThe production began in Australia in September 2022. In October, the talent agency MCTV specified that the filming was taking place in Sydney. Much of the series was filmed on location at Swifts, a 19th century mansion in Darling Point, which doubled as the fictional Macquarie House, Queen Georgiana's official Australian residence. Some scenes of the second episode were shot in the middle of the Australian bush.\nAt the end of November, several members of the production team made social media posts with the phrase \"That's a wrap\", indicating the end of filming. Additional scenes, including the street interview-style footage, were shot in February 2023, with post-production eventually ending in April.\nRelease\nIn the UK, all six episodes were released on BBC iPlayer on 16 June 2023, with the first episode airing on BBC One later that day. On 7 July, the fourth episode was moved to BBC Two because of Wimbledon. In Australia, the series premiered on ABC TV and ABC iview on 21 June 2023.\nReception\nCritical response\nIn her three-star review, Lucy Mangan of The Guardian said that Queen of Oz is \"a solidly written\" and \"well-constructed\" series with \"lots of callbacks within each episode, and nicely drawn relationships among the main and peripheral characters\". Although she didn't find the show \"spectacularly funny\", she concluded that it is \"extraordinarily watchable\" and praised the performances of Tate, Rob Collins and Robert Coleby. She described the main character as \"truly and refreshingly monstrous\" and called her a middle-aged version of Lauren Cooper crossed with Nan and Princess Margaret.\nA four-star review from Kylie Northover of The Sydney Morning Herald also praised Tate's performance, while describing it as a \"mostly silly fun\" show that \"occasionally veers into darker comedy while still feeling, at times, old-fashioned\". Ben Pobjie of the same newspaper found that Queen of Oz is \"really a damn good show\", describing Tate's acting as \"brilliant\" and claiming that she and the show's co-writers have \"crafted the scripts superbly\" resulting in what is \"surely the best new local comedy of the year\".\nIn a less favourable, one-star review from The Daily Telegraph, Anita Singh called the series \"desperate and lazy\", criticising Tate and her central character for not being \"remotely likeable\" and favouring \"far funnier\" supporting performances, especially from Niky Wardley. In a three-star review, the Daily Mail's Sarah Vine said \"there is some good stuff here, not least the supporting cast of characters, which are funny and well-written\", and proclaimed that Tate \"remains one of the few TV comedians who still dares to push people's buttons\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable unsortable\"\n|-\n!
