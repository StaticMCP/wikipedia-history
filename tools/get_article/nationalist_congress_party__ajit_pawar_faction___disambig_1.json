The faction had come into existence due to several disagreements with the then party president and Ajit's uncle Sharad Pawar. The faction got hold of the party name afterwards.\nHistory\nIn July 2023, a majority of the elected representatives of the party led by Ajit Pawar joined the National Democratic Alliance government. This caused a direct split between Ajit Pawar and the founder-president of the party Sharad Pawar.[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/ncp-splits-ajit-pawar-to-join-nda-govt-take-oath-as-deputy-cm-of-maharashtra/articleshow/101431751.cms Ajit Pawar Maharashtra Deputy Cm: Ajit Pawar joins NDA govt, takes oath as deputy CM of Maharashtra - The Economic Times]\nOn 7 February 2024, the Election Commission of India awarded the party name and symbol to the group headed by Ajit Pawar.
