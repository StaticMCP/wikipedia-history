An Austrian force under the command of general Beck assaulted 3,500 Prussian troops under Diericke at Meissen, overwhelming them and driving the survivors across the Elbe. The Prussians lost 400 men in the action and 1,543 fell prisoner. Austrian losses were few, totalling only 72 killed and 115 wounded. The Austrians secured an important victory, which effectively kept their ally Saxony in the war.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n* Szabo, Franz. The Seven Years War in Europe: 1756–1763. Routledge, 2013,  ."
