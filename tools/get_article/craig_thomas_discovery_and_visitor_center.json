The visitor center is open from early spring until the fall.\nOpened in 2007 to replace an old and inadequate facility, the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center was built with a combination of federal grants and private donations and is adjacent to the park headquarters in Moose, Wyoming. Fund raising efforts for an adjoining 154-seat auditorium were nearing completion as of 2011. Exhibits include the park's natural history, mountaineering and Western artifacts.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/hours.htm Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Center] - Grand Teton National Park"
