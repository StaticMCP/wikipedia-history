It was completed in 1896 and is a modest late-Victorian Gothic Revival building constructed in brick comprising a nave, chancel, and porch. The church was listed on the City of Penrith local government heritage register on 20 December 1991.\nHistory\nIn 1897 four blocks of Crown land were given to the residents of Kingswood for a church meeting place and cemetery (later not needed due to the dedication of Penrith Cemetery). The contractor was Jack Melville with ironwork given by local blacksmith James Wainwright. The porch on the western side was added later. Opened in 1898, the church was not consecrated until 1959. A Sunday school hall was completed in 1958 but was demolished.\nMinistries and services\nOn Sundays, there is a 9:30&nbsp;am family service. There is also a 5:00&nbsp;pm traditional prayer book service. The 1978 AAPB liturgy is used in this service. In the 7:00&nbsp;pm cafe church, people sit at tables instead of rows and drink coffee and cold drinks, eat food, discuss faith and sing a few songs, hear a talk and say some prayers.\nThe church run a wide range of groups, running from a boys group on Wednesday nights and kids club on Friday afternoons to a Youth Group on Friday nights 7:30–9:30 for kids in years 6–10.\nThe church runs scripture in local primary school and do work with the Western Sydney University.\nSee also\n}}\n* List of Anglican churches in the Diocese of Sydney\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
