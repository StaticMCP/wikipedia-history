A club cricketer for Perthshire Cricket Club, Dewar made his debut for Scotland in first-class cricket against Ireland at Paisley in 1960. His second match against Warwickshire at Edgbaston bought him considerable success, with him taking bowling figures of 7 for 71 in Warwickshire's first innings; amongst his wickets were the Test cricketers Khalid Ibadulla and Tom Cartwright. He appeared in two further first-class matches in 1961, against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Ireland, before making a fifth and final appearance in 1962 against Warwickshire. Besides his 7 for 71 against Warwickshire in 1961, Dewar struggled to have an impact with the ball in the matches which followed, taking just 3 more wickets. In his five first-class matches, he took 11 wickets at an average of 33.27. Dewar died at Perth in January 2020.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
