Throughout life, humans need to be able to make a decision with sound judgment to provide for their family and or make the best decision possible that will most benefit them in the long run. Decision making is the process when someone will choose between multiple alternatives. As stated above, being able to make a decision a good one at that you need to have a solid judgment.

Being able to make these good judgments and decisions also will depend highly on attention influences one will encounter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
