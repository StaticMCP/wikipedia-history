The area formed part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks and was strategically important for commerce, later becoming significant to the Hanseatic League. The clashes between Catholic Swedes and Orthodox Novgorodians carried religious overtones, although no evidence exists of official crusade bulls being issued by the Pope before the 14th century.\nBackground\nScandinavians maintained trade relations and other links with Novgorod from the Viking Age onwards. Merchants from Gotland operated both their own trading house (Gutagård) and Saint Olaf's Church in Novgorod. Scandinavians also conducted occasional raids on Novgorodian settlements. Eiríkr Hákonarson raided Ladoga in 997, and his brother Sveinn Hákonarson did the same in 1015.\nFollowing the marriage of Yaroslav I, Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev, to Ingegerd of Sweden in 1019, Ladoga became a jarldom within the sphere of Kievan Rus'. It was administered by Ragnvald Ulfsson, who is alleged to have been the father of King Stenkil of Sweden (r. 1060–1066). Dynastic marriages between Rus' and Scandinavian royal families continued; for example, in the 1090s Stenkil's granddaughter Christina married Mstislav of Novgorod. After Mstislav's death in 1132, the Novgorod Republic seceded from Kievan Rus'.\n12th century\nwas built in stone in the 12th century and rebuilt about 400&nbsp;years later.]]\nDocumentation for the 12th century is limited in Sweden, and East Slavic sources from this period are fragmentary.\nIn the Novgorod First Chronicle\nArnold Lelis (2005) noted that the Novgorod First Chronicle (NPL) records 42 instances of warfare between 1111 and 1205. Of these, 18 were conflicts with other Rus' principalities over dynastic succession, 11 with the Chud, and only 2 (in 1142 and 1164) with Swedes. The 1142 entry describes an incident involving merchants who may or may not have been \"Novgorodian\".\nAccording to the sub anno 1142 entry, a \"knyaz of the Svei with a bishop in sixty boats attacked merchants arriving from overseas in three vessels, killing about 150 of them.\" Scholars disagree on the interpretation of this passage: the identity of the merchants (Novgorodian or otherwise) is unclear, as is whether they were travelling to or from Novgorod. The account also leaves uncertain who defeated whom. Earlier historians such as Nikolay Karamzin (1826) and Vladimir Pashuto (1968) suggested that Novgorodian merchants overcame Swedish raiders. More recently, Beñat Elortza Larrea (2023) argued that the Swedish fleet intercepted and destroyed three Novgorodian merchant ships. Philip Line (2007) further observed that it remains uncertain whether the raid had official backing from the Swedish king or whether it was coordinated with the Yem people, who are recorded in the NPL as raiding Ladoga earlier in 1142 and again independently in 1149 and 1228.\nThe chronicle also reports under the year 1164 that a Swedish fleet of 55 ships approached Ladoga but was defeated on the river Voronai, with most of its ships captured by Novgorod. The maximum mobilisation capacity of the Swedish ledung is estimated at about 280 ships, of which roughly a quarter could be deployed at one time. This would correspond to around 2,500 men. See Jokipii (2002), p. 5.}}\nIn ''Erik's Chronicle\nAccording to Erik's Chronicle'', Karelians, supported by Novgorod, attacked mainland Sweden in the late 12th century and destroyed Sigtuna, then Sweden's most important city. However, Novgorodian sources do not mention this attack, and earlier Swedish texts describe the assailants only as \"heathens\", without identifying them further. The chronicle also recounts that Jon Jarl spent nine years fighting Novgorodians and Ingrians towards the end of the century. This account, however, is not corroborated by other sources.\n13th century\nPope Honorius III (r. 1216–1227) received several petitions concerning new Baltic crusades, primarily focused on Prussia and Livonia, but also a report from the Swedish archbishop regarding difficulties with the mission in Finland. Honorius responded by declaring an embargo on trade with pagans in the region; it is not known whether the Swedes requested additional assistance at that time.\nwas founded by the Swedes in 1293.]]\nThe 1230s and 1240s marked the first papal involvement in Latin crusades against the Novgorod Republic. In 1237, the Swedes obtained papal authorization to launch a crusade, and in 1240 new campaigns were initiated in the easternmost part of the Baltic.\nThe Finnish mission's expansion eastward brought Sweden into conflict with Novgorod, as the Karelians had been allies and tributaries of Novgorod since the mid-12th century. Following a successful campaign in Tavastia, the Swedes advanced further east but were halted by a Novgorodian force led by Prince Alexander Yaroslavich, who reportedly defeated them at the Battle of the Neva in July 1240, earning the epithet Nevsky. The Novgorodian chronicle is the sole source for this engagement. Novgorod opposed the crusade for economic reasons, particularly to defend its monopoly over the Karelian fur trade.\nAfter 1240, Sweden concentrated its efforts on Finland, where it gradually consolidated control over western territories. Swedish forces did not return to the Neva until the end of the century. Earlier, in 1220, Sweden had unsuccessfully attempted to establish a foothold in Estonia at the Battle of Lihula. Novgorodian interests continued to clash with Sweden's in Finland, where Novgorodian expeditions are recorded on several occasions from the 11th century onward. A raid in the winter of 1226–1227 inflicted heavy losses on the Finns, while a Finnish retaliatory expedition against Ladoga in 1228 was defeated, contributing to Finland's eventual subjugation during the Second Swedish Crusade in 1249. In 1256, Novgorod retaliated with another major raid on Swedish Finland.\nIn 1293, the Swedes captured part of western Karelia and founded the fortress of Viborg, an expedition traditionally referred to as the Third Swedish Crusade. Seven years later, they established the fortress of Landskrona at the mouth of the Neva on the Okhta River, destroying Novgorodian settlements in the area. Later that year, Novgorodian troops counterattacked and destroyed Landskrona.\n14th century\nIn 1311, the Novgorodians devastated central Finland, where the Swedes had recently built Hakoinen Castle, beginning the Häme War. In retaliation, a Swedish fleet sailed to Ladoga and set the trading post on fire. Three years later, dissatisfaction with Novgorodian rule erupted in Karelia, where locals killed Novgorodian governors and sought assistance from Sweden. After several months of conflict, Karelia again submitted to Novgorod's authority.\nIn 1318, Novgorod attacked Turku in southwestern Finland, burning the city, Turku Cathedral, and the episcopal castle at Kuusisto Castle. Four years later, Novgorod laid siege to Viborg and founded Oreshek, a fortress controlling the entrance to Lake Ladoga.\n, one of the fortresses built by Novgorodians to contain Swedish expansion.]]\nFollowing the Kexholm War (1321–1323), the first treaties concluded between the belligerents were the Treaty of Nöteborg (12 August 1323) and, in 1326, the Treaty of Novgorod between Novgorod and Norway. Both agreements aimed to establish \"eternal peace\" in the region.\nBy 1328, Sweden was encouraging settlers to occupy the northern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, defined by the treaty as belonging to Novgorod. In 1337, Karelians again rebelled against Novgorod, and King Magnus Eriksson sent troops in their support, briefly occupying Korela Fortress during Sten Bielke's war against Novgorod. The following year, Novgorod besieged Viborg, but an armistice was soon agreed.\nAfter a decade of peace, Magnus IV resumed hostilities and demanded that the Novgorodians recognise papal authority. According to the Novgorod First Chronicle and Fourth Chronicle, the king insisted that the Novgorodians debate his \"philosophers\" (Catholic theologians) and that the losing side convert to the victor's faith. Archbishop Vasily Kalika of Novgorod consulted with the posadnik and other city leaders, and replied that, since Novgorod had received Christianity from Constantinople, the king should send his philosophers there to debate with the Byzantines.\nAfter receiving this response, the king launched a crusade sending his army to Oreshek and set it ablaze, but Novgorod soon regained control. The king launched another unsuccessful attack in 1350. That same year, the Black Death reached Northern Europe, effectively halting further hostilities.\nLater clashes were sporadic. Swedish attempts to assert control over the Gulf of Bothnia prompted Novgorod to begin constructing a castle near the Oulujoki delta in the 1370s. Sweden responded by establishing a fortress nearby. Novgorod attacked in 1377 but failed to capture it. The following year, Pope Gregory XI issued a crusade bull against Novgorod. Soon afterwards, Novgorodian forces withdrew from Ostrobothnia, leaving it under Swedish control.\nBy the late 14th century, Novgorod had established the fiefs of Korela, Oreshek, Koporye, Luga, and Ladoga as buffer territories between its core domains and Sweden. Several Lithuanian dukes noted for their military expertise—Narimantas, his son Patrikas, and later Lengvenis—were invited to govern this Ingrian duchy.\n15th century\nHostilities between Novgorod and Sweden resumed in 1392 and 1411. By this time, Sweden was part of the Kalmar Union and was largely occupied with internal Scandinavian power struggles throughout the 15th century. The final recorded conflict occurred in 1445, several decades before Novgorod was incorporated into the Muscovy. Novgorod's fall did not bring lasting peace, and hostilities continued between Muscovy (later the Tsardom of Russia) and Sweden until the early 19th century.\nList of wars\nSee also\n* Capture of Novgorod (1611)\n*\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nPrimary sources\n* Novgorod First Chronicle (NPL,  1275), sub anno 6650 (1142)\n** (Church Slavonic Synodal Scroll critical edition)  – digitised version of the late-13th-century Synodal Scroll edition (or \"Older Edition\") of the Novgorod First Chronicle (Synodalnyy NPL).\n** (modern English translation)\n* ''Erik's Chronicle ( 1330)\n** (modern English translation) The Chronicle of Duke Erik : a Verse Epic from Medieval Sweden'' (2012).\nLiterature\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
