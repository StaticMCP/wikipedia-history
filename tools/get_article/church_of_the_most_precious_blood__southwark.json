The shrine outside the church to Our Lady of Lourdes (or Our Lady of All Nations) was dedicated in 1957. It is made from Sicilian marble and stands in a niche lined with flint from Norfolk.\nThe church serves the Parish of the Most Precious Blood which was established in 1891 by the Bishop of Southwark, John Baptist Butt, upon a bequest of £10,000. The church was designed by the architect Frederick Walters and the combined cost of the construction of the church and adjoining presbytery was £7,000.\nDenis Evinson, in his book Catholic Churches of London, described the interior as \"...a joy to enter, warm, welcoming and uncluttered by busy detail\".\nThe two bells of the church were made in the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and installed in 1956. The Stations of the Cross that adorn the walls of the interior were made from terracotta by the Swiss artist .\nIn 2013, the parish joined the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.\nReferences"
