Pokorny. The project works of the Club began in 1923.\nThe club occupied the quarter between the streets Petrovskaya and Frunze and the alleys Klubny and Gogol.\nThe building is a bright example of constructivism in architecture. According to the construction, the building resembled the head spanner wrench as a symbol of peaceful labor. The Metalworkers' Club was built by the Taganrog Instrument Factory (later - Taganrog Combine factory) and the Krasny Kotelshchik factory.\nThe club was built by the young people of Taganrog from the brick of the disassembled church in the name of St. Michael the Archangel. Facades are plastered. The main entrance is accented by the semi-cylindrical facade of the lobby and the foyer of the second floor. The third floor of this wing was built in the 1960s. Metal window bindings emphasized the \"industriality\", and not the residential character of the building.\nHistory\nIn 2004, the owners of Taganrog Combine factory, being unable to finance the activities of the Palace of Culture, sold the building to «Interresource», which began its reconstruction.\nIn 2011, the Taganrog Palace of Youth was established in the building of the former Palace of Culture of the Combine factory.\nArt studio of Culture House of Combine factory\nIn the Culture House of Combine factory worked a studio of fine art, considered to be the strongest in Taganrog. In different years it was directed by artists Nikolay But, Valentina Russo, Leonid Stukanov.\nNames of the Palace of Culture\n* Metalworkers' Club\n* The club B.S.R.M (mechanical engineering)\n* Club of the factory named after Stalin\n* The Palace of Culture of the Stalin factory\n* Palace of Culture of Combine Builders\nLinks\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130126140908/http://virtualtaganrog.ru/maps/obshestvenye-organizaci/mbuk-dvorec-molodezhi.html Виртуальная экскурсия по Зданию Дворца культуры комбайнового завода (Дворец молодёжи, 2011)]\nReferences"
