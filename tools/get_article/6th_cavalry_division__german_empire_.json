Kavallerie-Division) was a unit of the German Army that fought on Eastern and Western Fronts during World War I. The division was formed on the mobilization of the German Army in August 1914 and was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nCombat chronicle\nAfter formation, the division was initially assigned to IV Cavalry Corps, which preceded the 4th and 5th Armies on the Western Front. In October 1914, it was transferred to Russia and then in October 1916 to Romania. In February 1917, it returned to the Western Front, where it served in Alsace until July 1918, Flanders until August 1918, and Artois to October 1918 before moving back to Flanders where it remained until the end of the war. Dismounted on 5 May 1918, it was restructured to form 6th Cavalry Schützen Division. By the end of the war, it was serving under the Guards Corps, 4th Army, Heeresgruppe Kronprinz Rupprecht on the Western Front.\nA more detailed combat chronicle can be found at the German-language version of this article.\nOrder of Battle on mobilization\nOn formation, in August 1914, the component units of the division were:\n*28th Cavalry Brigade (from XIV Army Corps District)\n**20th (1st Baden) Life-Dragoons\n**21st (2nd Baden) Dragoons\n*33rd Cavalry Brigade (from XVI Corps District)\n**9th (1st Hannover) Dragoons \"King Charles I of Rumania\"\n**13th (Schleswig-Holstein) Dragoons\n*45th Cavalry Brigade (from XVI Army Corps District)\n**13th (1st Kurhessian) Hussars \"King Umberto of Italy\"\n**13th Jäger zu Pferde\n*Horse Artillery Abteilung of the 8th (1st Rhenish) Field Artillery \"von Holtzendorff\" Regiment\n*6th Machine Gun Detachment\n*Pioneer Detachment\n*Signals Detachment\n**Heavy Wireless Station 4\n**Light Wireless Station 9\n**Light Wireless Station 11\n*Cavalry Motorised Vehicle Column 6\nSee: Table of Organisation and Equipment\n6th Cavalry Schützen Division\nThe 6th Cavalry Division was extensively reorganized during the course of the war, culminating in its conversion to a Cavalry Schützen Division, which was a dismounted cavalry formation. The cavalry brigades were then renamed Cavalry Schützen Commands and performed a similar role to that of an infantry regiment command. Likewise, the cavalry regiments became Cavalry Schützen Regiments and were allocated the role of infantry battalions, with their squadrons acting as infantry companies. However, these units were much weaker than normal infantry formations as a Schützen squadron had a strength of just four officers and 109 NCOs and other ranks, which was considerably less than that of an infantry company.\n*28th Cavalry Brigade transferred to the 4th Cavalry Division on 1 February 1917;\n*33rd Cavalry Brigade became independent on 14 September 1916;\n*45th Cavalry Brigade became independent on 14 October 1916. It rejoined the division from the 4th Cavalry Division on 1 May 1918 and was renamed 45th Cavalry Schützen Command on 6 May 1918;\n*3rd Cavalry Brigade joined the division from the 4th Cavalry Division on 17 October 1916 and was renamed 3rd Cavalry Schützen Command on 6 May 1918;\n*5th Cavalry Brigade (formerly independent) joined the division on 19 October 1916 and renamed 5th Cavalry Schützen Command on 11 May 1918;\n*8th Cavalry Brigade joined from 1st Cavalry Division on 18 October 1916 and became independent on 6 October 1917.\nLate World War I organization\nAllied Intelligence rated this division as 4th Class (of four classes).
