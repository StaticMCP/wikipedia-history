      "text": "# Edward Greene Malbone\n\nEdward Greene Malbone (1777 – May 7, 1807) was an American painter, and the most sought-after miniaturist of his day. He was an influence on other artists including Charles Fraser, William Dunlap and John Wesley Jarvis.\nEdward Greene Malbone was born at Newport, Rhode Island and began his career in Providence at the age of seventeen, later working in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston and London. Exacting and unceasing work undermined his constitution and following an attempt to recover his health in Jamaica, he came to Savannah and died there of tuberculosis at the home of his cousin, Robert Mackay, on May 7, 1807. He is buried in Savannah's Colonial Park Cemetery.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.historicnewengland.org/collections-archives-exhibitions/online-exhibitions/JewelryHistory/checklist/related-objects Historic New England].
