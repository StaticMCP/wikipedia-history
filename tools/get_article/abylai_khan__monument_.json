In his right hand he holds a rod, which is a symbol of the khan's power. The base of the pedestal of the equestrian sculpture is four angular columns, which hold a hinged cornice. The general feeling of the monument is power, strength and greatness.\nCritique\nThe monument was heavily criticized by sculptors. In particular, the sculptor Nurlan Dalbay spoke about it in the following way: \"It doesn't even smell of sculpture. Amateurs like these, who get to win government contracts, can't sculpt, don't understand anything about composition, and don't know the smell of sculpture. Monumental sculpture has its own laws, they learn that at academies. The main task is to insert the object into the urban situation. It should be silhouettically recognizable. Then the details come. That means you know very well human anatomy, the anatomy of a horse. You know composition at least a little bit, in other words you can portray some kind of gesture. And because you don't have that, you get not sculpture, but plasticine little people\".\nReferences"
