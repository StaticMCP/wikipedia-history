His findings concerning the British Gas Corporation's methane terminal were disputed by the Health and Safety Executive and the British Gas Corporation and there were doubts about his technical competence: he had conducted the inquiry without the benefit of technical assessors, and had exceeded his terms of reference.\nWard married Stella Elizabeth Ellis in 1947, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. His estate was worth £122,280 net.\nReferences\n|-"
