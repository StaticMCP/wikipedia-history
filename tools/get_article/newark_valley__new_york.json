The town is located in the northeast part of the county and is northwest of Binghamton.\nHistory\nThe first permanent settlers arrived around 1791. This area was called Brown's Settlement and was part of the Town of Berkshire until it was organized as the \"Town of Westville\" in 1823. In 1824, the town changed its name to \"Newark,\" at the suggestion of a settler from New Jersey, but then changed the name to Newark Valley in 1862, to avoid conflict with the name of a village in Wayne County.\nOne of the earliest settlers was Richard Sarles (1753-1849), a native of Bedford (town), New York and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War whose descendants share a common heritage albeit with various spelling permutations (Searles, Sarles, Sarlls). The area where he settled was known as Searlestown, between Newark Valley (village), New York and Flemingville Owego, New York, and the cemetery where he and over two dozen Newark Valley relatives and descendants are buried bears that same name.\nThe Belcher-Holden Farm, Bement-Billings House, Blewer Farm, Daniel Chamberlain House, Morris Clinton House, Farrand-Pierson House, Lipe Farm, Maple Lawn Farm, John Settle Farm, Wade Farm, West Newark Congregational Church and Cemetery, and West Newark School House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 50.4&nbsp;square miles (130.6&nbsp;km2), of which 50.3&nbsp;square miles (130.4&nbsp;km2)  is land and 0.1&nbsp;square mile (0.2&nbsp;km2)  (0.16%) is water.\nThe eastern town line is the border of Broome County.\nNew York State Route 38 and New York State Route 38B intersect south of Newark Valley village.\nDemographics\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census\n}}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 4,097 people, 1,488 households, and 1,123 families residing in the town.

It continues to be a peaceful tract of land with a serene lake located west of the Newark Valley Middle School.  Many community service groups come to utilize this park and help with the upkeep of maintenance.\n*Trout Ponds - This beautiful Victorian park was built in 1869 by Mr. Waring who wanted to breed trout, provide a recreation area for the public, and provide a place to build custom fly rods.  In its heyday, travelers flocked in masses from the Southern Central Railroad as far as Scranton, Pa, and Syracuse, NY for outdoor family parties and picnicking.  Public usage declined toward the turn of the century and New York State took possession to run this park solely as trout breeding.  In the 1950s, the village of Newark Valley bought this parcel of land for one dollar from New York State. This family park is still in use for the community to enjoy picnics and reunions.\n*Bement-Billings Farmstead - The Farmstead is currently owned and operated by the Newark Valley Historical Society.  It is a living history site that interprets the period c.1810.  The Farmstead was established by Asa Bement, one of the first settlers who came to Northern Tioga County in 1791.  The house was donated by Mrs. Myrtie Louise Billings Hills in 1976 to the newly formed Historical Society.  Outbuildings include an English threshing barn, an outhouse, a sap house, a blacksmith shop, a small barn and a farmer's workshop.  The Society currently has . The Farmstead is open to the public on weekends from the first weekend in July until the Apple Festival, the first weekend in October.  School tours are often conducted in May and June.  The Apple Festival is its largest fundraiser.\n*Newark Valley Community Center - Formerly known as the Newark Valley United Church of Christ, this building has been reshaped into a spot for the community to gather for events such as karaoke and craft fairs. The space is open to being rented out for family events, birthday parties, and other social gatherings. As of 2024, the Newark Valley Community Center is still being renovated and refurbished by volunteering students from Newark Valley High School's Interact Club and community members.\nCommunities and locations in the Town of Newark Valley\n*Alexander Pond &ndash; A small pond west of Newark Valley village.\n*East Branch Owego Creek &ndash; A stream flowing southward through the western part of the town.\n*East Newark &ndash; A hamlet in the southern part of the town on NY Route 38B.\n*Jenksville &ndash; A hamlet in the corner of the town on County Road 33.
