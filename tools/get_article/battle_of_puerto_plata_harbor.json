U.S. Marines then assaulted the Spanish Army's Fortaleza San Felipe; after another brief firefight, the fort was overrun and its cannons were spiked.\nBattle\nIn early May 1800, Captain Silas Talbot organized a naval expedition to Puerto Plata on the island of Hispaniola. His objective was to reduce French privateering. Having captured the small French sloops Sally and Ester,  arrived outside Puerto Plata. The French privateer Sandwich was known to be at anchor in the harbor.\nTalbot offloaded from USS Constitution a landing force of about 100 marines and sailors, onto the prize sloop Sally under the command of Lt. Isaac Hull. Hull, with the force hidden below deck, brought Sally into harbor and alongside an unsuspecting Sandwich. The French were no doubt shocked at the approaching American force and hardly put up a fight; Sandwich was captured in minutes. Then the Americans turned their attention on Fortaleza San Felipe, a Spanish fort whose guns covered the two ships. After another brief fight, the fort's defenses were overrun and the marines spiked the fort's cannons.\nWith the capture of Sandwich and the assault on the coastal fort, U.S. forces returned to their ships and sailed home. The Battle of Puerto Plata Harbor was one of the few land battles during the Quasi-War. Later the United States government would have to disavow Talbot's raid as it was an attack on a neutral party (Spain) and against a neutral military force (the fort).\nBibliography\n*\n* Benjamin Armstrong, Small Boats and Daring Men: Maritime Raiding, Irregular Warfare, and the Early American Navy, (University of Oklahoma Press, 2019)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081011032548/http://www.polkcounty.org/timonier/commanders/commanders.htm Commanding Officers of Constitution]\n* [http://www.historicphotography.com/uss_constitution_old_ironsides_i.htm Constitution and Grebe in Houston, 1932]\n* [http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/us_navy_pages/sailing_ships/constitution/uss_constitution.htm Maritimequest Constitution Photo Gallery]\n* [http://www.ussconstitutionmuseum.org USS Constitution Museum]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120829221054/http://www.history.navy.mil/ussconstitution/index.html USS Constitution Official homepage]"
