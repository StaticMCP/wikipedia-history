Stewart\n\nFred Waldorf Stewart (Binghamton, New York, 1894 &ndash; Sarasota, Florida, February 8, 1991) was an American surgical pathologist who was chief of pathology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\nStewart was a friend of Cornelius P. Rhoads, who later became the director of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Stewart, as \"Ferdie,\" was the addressee of a controversial letter by Rhoads. Stewart also served as acting director of Memorial in 1944 while Rhoads was in the military. In 1947, while Rhoads was director of Memorial, Stewart received a grant of $30,000 for cancer pathology and other teaching. This was part of the largest aggregation of Federal cancer grants ever given to a single institution at that time, a total of $142,550.\nIn the 1940s, while at Memorial Hospital (which later merged with Sloan-Kettering), Stewart studied breast cancer with the distinguished Pathologist, Frank William Foote, Jr. (1911&ndash;1989).\nStewart–Treves syndrome, one of the classical sarcoma syndromes, was first described by Stewart and his Fellow Pathologist, Norman Tannenbaum Treves (1894&ndash;1964) in 1948, in the first issue of the Cancer Journal. Stewart was the editor of Cancer until 1961, when he was replaced by the Arizona-Native Pathologist John W. Berg (1925&ndash;2007).\nSelected publications\n*Tumors of the Breast, 1950\n*\"Lymphangiosarcoma in postmastectomy lymphedema.
