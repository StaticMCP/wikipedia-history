He was Professor of History at the University of Aberdeen where he taught from 1964 to 1997. From 2002 to 2008 he was the President of the Hakluyt Society. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Historical Society.\nHis PhD thesis began his course of research into the identification and analysis of the British institutions which sent expeditions to East Africa from the period roughly 1840 to 1870. The thesis was concerned with the Royal Geographical Society, but the scope of his interest was soon extended to embrace missionary societies, British government representatives and the explorers themselves.\nHe also sought to analyse and discuss the nature of the interaction which took place between the newly arriving British institutions and their personnel on the one hand, and the various indigenous peoples of East Africa on the other. It is this examination of the interaction and demonstration that the relationships were not as straightforward as previously assumed that may justify the claim to some academic and wider historical significance for the publications produced.\nFull list of publications\n* 'Krapf and the Strategy of the Mission to East Africa', Makerere Journal 5 (1961) pp.&nbsp;37–50 (pamphlet: 2 copies).\n* 'Speke and the Royal Geographical Society', Uganda Journal 26 (1962) pp.&nbsp;23–43 (1 journal; 1 offprint).\n* ‘The RGS and the African Exploration Fund, 1876-1880', Geographical Journal 129 (1963) pp. 25-35 (2 copies).\n* 'Explorers and East African History', Proceedings East African Academy 1 (1964) pp. 69-73 (2 copies).\n* Introduction to second edition of JL Krapf, Travels, Researches and Missionary Labours [1858] London: Cass (1968) pp. 1-75.
