But Rin did not expect to become personally involved—until he met Takoro, the strange young \"deputy sheriff\" from another world who was on the trail of notorious space criminals. There were only four Kurodako Brothers, but they plotted to use their alien science and natural shapeshifting powers to become the secret masters of Earth. With Takoro's help, Rin became the mighty superhero, Muteking, to foil their schemes.\nRelease\nThe series was televised in Italy under the title of simply Muteking.\nAn English dub of episode one was also made, apparently in an unsuccessful attempt to sell the series to the United States. In this one-episode dubbed version (which has been posted on YouTube in three parts), Rin Yuki is named \"Scooter Loon,\" and his father is renamed \"Linus Loon.\"\nCast\n*Rin Yuki: Kazuhiko Inoue\n*Takoro: Yumiko Uzaki\n*Dr. Dankichi Yuki: Isamu Tanonaka\n*Koharu Yuki: Kazue Komiya\n*Sonny Yuki: Rokuro Naya\n*Mitchi: Takako Tsutsui\n*Nubon: Takemi Nakamura\n*Takokichi: Toru Ohira\n*Takomaru: Shigeru Tsuji\n*Takosaku: Shin Aomori\n*Takomi: Makoto Kōsaka\nEpisode list\n|writer=\n|writerR=\n|airdate=\n|episodes=\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
