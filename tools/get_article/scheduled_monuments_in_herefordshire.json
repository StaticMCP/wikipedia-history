These protected sites date from the Neolithic period in some cases and include barrows, churchyard crosses,  ruined abbeys, castles, and Iron Age hill forts.\nIn the United Kingdom, the scheduling of monuments was first initiated to ensure the preservation of \"nationally important\" archaeological sites or historic buildings.
