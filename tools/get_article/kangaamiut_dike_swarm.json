      "text": "# Kangaamiut dike swarm\n\nThe Kangaamiut dike swarm (old spelling: Kangâmiut) is a 2.04 billion year old dike swarm located in the Qeqqata region of western Greenland.  The dikes cut Archean orthogneisses and are exposed along approximately  of the coast and a similar distance up to the inland ice to the east, covering an area of about . To the north it is bounded by the paleoproterozoic Ikertooq shear zone (old spelling: Ikertôq) while to the south the boundary is gradational with a gradual reduction in the density of dikes. The dike swarm was intruded during a phase of extensional tectonics. They were later deformed during the Nagssugtoqidian orogeny, with the amount of strain increasing towards the Iqertooq shear zone.\nReferences"
