Detox was a fixture of the Southern California drag scene before coming to international attention on the fifth season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race, as well as the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars''.\nCareer\nDetox has appeared in music videos with Ke$ha and Rihanna and is a member of Chad Michaels' Dreamgirls Revue, the longest-running female-impersonation show in California. She is also a member of the band Tranzkuntinental. The band was started by Charlie Paulson and Xander Smith and features drag queens Kelly Mantle, Rhea Litré, Vicky Vox, and Willam Belli.\nDetox modeled as part of the Tranimal Master Class Workshop at the Machine Project. The event was photographed by Austin Young. In 2011, Detox acted in Showgirls in Drag, a live adaptation of Showgirls. The production was directed by Stephen Guarino and played at the Dragonfly nightclub in Hollywood.\nShe started doing drag at 15 when working with her sister, and originally went by the name Cornanda Cobb. In March 2012, Willam Belli released \"Chow Down,\" a parody of \"Hold On\" by Wilson Phillips. The song featured Detox and Vicky Vox, who co-wrote the parody's lyrics. The three began performing under the name DWV, a dual reference that takes note of their first initials (Detox, Willam and Vicky) while also parodying the group SWV. Together they released several other singles: \"Boy is a Bottom\", a parody of \"Girl on Fire\" by Alicia Keys which debuted at number six on Billboards Comedy Digital Songs, selling 3,000 downloads in its first week.; \"Silicone\", a parody of \"Dancing on My Own\" by Robyn; and \"Blurred Bynes\", a parody of \"Blurred Lines\" by Robin Thicke. In April 2019, Lizzo released a second music video for her song \"Juice\", in which Detox makes an appearance.\n''RuPaul's Drag Race\nIn November 2012, Logo announced that Detox was among 14 contestants who would be competing on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race''. Detox won the children's TV show-themed main challenge in the episode \"Draggle Rock\". As part of the show, Detox sang on the \"We Are the World\"-inspired song \"Can I Get an Amen?\", with the song's proceeds benefiting the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. Detox placed fourth overall, and was the last queen eliminated before the finale.\nIn 2016, Detox was announced as one of the cast members on the second season of ''RuPaul's All Stars Drag Race. She ultimately finished as a runner up in the competition alongside Katya. In 2017, Detox appeared in the film Cherry Pop, directed by Assaad Yacoub, alongside fellow Drag Race alumni Tempest DuJour, Mayhem Miller and Bob the Drag Queen. In 2019, a panel of judges from New York magazine placed Detox 14th on their list of \"the most powerful drag queens in America\", a ranking of 100 former Drag Race contestants. She was one of 37 queens to appear on the cover.\nPersonal life\nDetox came out as transgender in August 2024 and uses the pronouns she/they. She comes from a military family and grew up in Mesa, Arizona, Hope Mills, North Carolina, Wilson, North Carolina, and Anna Maria Island, Florida as a kid and teen. She has a twin brother and an older sister.\nDiscography\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Comedy\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Chow Down\" (Willam Belli featuring Detox and Vicky Vox)\n| rowspan=\"1\"| 2012\n|12\n| The Wreckoning''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Boy Is a Bottom\" (Vicky Vox featuring Detox and Willam Belli)\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 2013\n|6\n| rowspan=\"4\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Can I Get an Amen?\" (RuPaul featuring the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race Season 5)\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Silicone\" (Detox featuring Willam Belli and Vicky Vox)\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Blurred Bynes\" (Detox featuring Willam Belli and Vicky Vox)\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"This Is How We Jew It\"\n| 2015\n|—\n|Christmas Queens\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Supersonic\"\n| 2016\n|—\n| rowspan=\"6\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"She's Gotta Habit\"\n| 2017\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"#SueList\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2018\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Like It Like That\"\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"El Camino\"  (with Ellis Miah)\n| 2020\n|—\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Fleuressence\"  (featuring Danny Boy Steward)\n| 2022\n|—\n|-\n|}\nOther appearances\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Song\n!scope=\"col\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\"| Album\n|-\n|\"Pretty Lady\" (Kesha featuring Lady Lloyd and Detox)\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2012\n| N/A (Unreleased Track)\n|-\n|\"Starfucker\" (Willam Belli featuring Detox and Vicky Vox)\n| The Wreckoning\n|-\n|\"Read U Wrote U\" (RuPaul featuring Detox, Katya, Alaska & Roxxxy Andrews)\n| 2016\n| Non-album singles\n|}\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
