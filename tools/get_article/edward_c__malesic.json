Malesic later received a Licentiate of Canon Law from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.\nAfter his ordination in 1987, the diocese assigned Malesic as assistant pastor at the following Pennsylvania parishes:\n* St. Theresa in New Cumberland from 1987 to 1989\n* St. Rose of Lima Parish in York from 1989 to 1992. Also in 1989, he was appointed campus minister at York College of Pennsylvania in Spring Garden Township\nIn 1992, Malesic left St. Rose to become campus minister at Millersville University of Pennsylvania in Millersville.  The diocese transferred him from Millersville in 1996 to serve as an auditor in the ecclesiastical tribunal.  Two years later, Bishop Nicholas C. Dattilo named Malesic as defender of the bond and canonical consulter for the tribunal.\nMalesic became associated with the Newman Center at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, from 2000 to 2004. The diocese in 2004 assigned him as first administrator and then pastor at Holy Infant Parish in York Haven, Pennsylvania.
