Mangi means king in Kichagga.\nRise to power\nAfter Rengua's death in 1842, his son Mamkinga, along with his three brothers (Kishongu, Kileo, and Samanya) engaged in a power struggle that marked the decline of the Machame Kingdom throughout the 19th century. The Kikafu basin communities, focused on their own issues, had little influence on neighboring chiefdoms. Rengua's authority ended with his passing, leading local leaders, or masumba, to reclaim their independence and reject centralized leadership, resulting in chaos.\nThe conflict primarily unfolded in specific areas, with each brother vying for support. Samanya emerged as a strong contender in Foo, prompting Mamkinga to retreat to Wari, where he established a new base with the help of Kishongu. Kileo had some backing but was largely overshadowed by Samanya's popularity. Eventually, Mamkinga eliminated his rivals, leading to the deaths of Kileo and Kishongu on his orders, Samanya fled and never to be seen again.\nMamkinga emerged as the mangi king of the territories situated east of the Kikafu River, receiving tributes from the Masumba people in the form of cattle, goats, and ivory during periods of relative stability. Conversely, his authority faced significant challenges, particularly from Isumba Muro Ntuku of Lemira, who notably resisted paying tribute. Mamkinga resided in three distinct locations: Wari, where he appropriated unoccupied land; Kyeri, located west of the Kikafu, which appears to have served as a refuge; and Foo, a hilltop retreat utilized by chiefs in times of crisis.\nReign\nHistorical records indicate that he ruled during the years 1848 and 1849, as documented by Rebmann, but his political authority had diminished prior to 1861, when von der Decken visited his successor. Evidence from the accounts of Rebmann and von der Decken suggests that Mamkinga's ascension to power involved strategic relocation to Wari, positioning him advantageously for trade with Swahili caravans. These caravans, which notably camped at Urara in Wari, facilitated not only trade but also the introduction of a magician who became a significant ally in his administration.\nThe magician known as Muigno or Munie, Wesiri—referred to as \"Nesiri\" by the Machame—was a Swahili individual described as \"a small modest man from Pangani.\" He initially arrived as a bearer with a caravan and claimed to possess magical powers, which allowed him to gain significant influence over Mamkinga. As a result, he became the first Swahili to settle in Machame, arriving in 1842, and by 1848, he served as Mamkinga's sorcerer, medicine-man, and rain-maker, acquiring the authority to act on Mamkinga's behalf. However, his influence diminished over time, and by 1861, during Mamkinga's successor's rule, he was relegated to the role of interpreter.\nIt is believed that Nesiri introduced new practices to Machame, which may have included potent poisons or talismans that helped Mamkinga eliminate his rivals and maintain his position. The origins of these practices could be traced back to coastal regions or the caravan routes, potentially acquired in places like Taveta, Kahe, or Kilimanjaro.\nDecline and death\nMamkinga's reign is often viewed as a brief and unclear period before the more defined rule of his son and successor, Ndesserua, who is characterized as a violent and tyrannical figure with a penchant for parricide. By 1861, Mamkinga had died, and Ndesserua was already in power in the mitaa east of the Kikafu. Von der Decken described him as a strong young man, approximately 20 years old, noted for his fearful demeanor and volatile temperament, while also being intimidated by Tatua, the successor to the elderly Kashenge in Kibosho.\nSee also\n* Mangi Ndesserua\n* Mangi Saiye\n* Mangi Ngalami\n* Mangi Rengua\n* Mangi Meli\n* Chagga states\nReferences"
