A total of four people have served as president (not counting the collective head of state, one disputed president, three acting presidents and one transitional president) since the post was formed in 1960.\nThe current president, Brice Oligui Nguema, took power in a coup on 30 August 2023 from Ali Bongo. He was eventually elected to the presidency in the 2025 presidential election.\nDescription of the office\nElection\nThe president of the republic is elected for a presidential term of seven years, universal and direct suffrage, as per the 2024 Constitution. The president is eligible for re-election once, with a maximum of two consecutive terms, regardless of constitutional revisions. The 2024 Constitution reintroduced a two-term limit, replacing the unlimited re-election allowed under earlier amendments and explicitly prohibiting more than two successive mandates.\nThe election is conducted via a two-round majoritarian system. The candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes expressed in the first round is elected. If no candidate achieves this, a second round is held 14 days after the proclamation of results, between the two candidates who received the most votes in the first round. The candidate with the most votes in the second round is elected. In case of withdrawal or permanent incapacity of one of the top two candidates, the next highest-ranking candidate from the first round replaces them.\nEligibility for the presidency is restricted to Gabonese citizens of either sex who:\n*are born Gabonese to at least one Gabonese parent, themselves born Gabonese;\n*hold exclusive Gabonese nationality (dual nationals must renounce other nationalities three years prior);\n*are aged between 35 and 70 years;\n*are married to a Gabonese spouse born to at least one Gabonese parent, themselves born Gabonese;\n*have resided in Gabon continuously for at least three years before the election;\n*can speak at least one  national language;\n*enjoy full civil and political rights;\n*are certified to be in complete physical and mental well-being by a sworn medical panel designated by the bureaus of both parliamentary chambers.\nThe president’s spouse and descendants are ineligible to run for the presidency immediately following the president’s term. If a candidate dies or is incapacitated within the month before the first round, the Constitutional Court may postpone the election, but not beyond the incumbent president’s term end.\nThe Constitutional Court may extend election timelines, but the election must occur no later than the expiration of the incumbent president’s mandate. If the election is delayed beyond the current president’s term, the president remains in office until their successor is elected. The modalities for these provisions are set by organic law.\nThe presidential term begins on the day of the presidential oath, within eight working days after the Constitutional Court proclaimed the results, and ends after the seventh year. The election must take place no later than three months before the end of the incumbent president’s term. The incumbent president may not shorten their term to seek another mandate.\nIf the incumbent president runs for re-election, they cannot legislate by ordinance from the announcement of their candidacy until the election, and the National Assembly  may not be dissolved. In cases of necessity, Parliament may convene in an extraordinary session.\nOath of office\nThe presidential oath marks the beginning of the presidential term and must occur after the Constitutional Court proclaims the official election results, within eight working days if no disputes arise, or within 15 days if contested. The president solemnly takes the following oath before the Constitutional Court and Parliament, with the left hand on the Constitution and the right hand raised before the national flag:\nVacancy\nIn case of a temporary incapacity of the president, as certified by the Constitutional Court upon referral by the presidents of both parliamentary chambers or the Vice-President of the Government, the  Vice-President of the Republic  temporarily assumes presidential duties, excluding certain powers (e.g., constitutional amendments, dissolution of the National Assembly, or referendum initiation). Temporary incapacity cannot exceed forty-five days, after which it becomes permanent. In case of a vacancy or permanent incapacity of the president, as certified by the Constitutional Court upon referral by the National Assembly bureau (by a two-thirds majority) or the Vice-President of the Government (after a simple majority vote in the Council of Ministers), the president of the Senate temporarily assumes presidential duties. If the Senate president is incapacitated, the first vice-president of the Senate takes over. The interim president exercises full presidential powers, except for specific powers (e.g., constitutional amendments or dissolution), and is ineligible to run in the subsequent presidential election. The interim president must take the following oath before the Constitutional Court and Parliament, with the left hand on the Constitution and the right hand raised before the national flag:\nIn cases of vacancy or permanent incapacity, the election for a new president must occur between 30 and 120 days after the vacancy or incapacity is declared, unless the Constitutional Court cites force majeure. The modalities are set by organic law.\nList of officeholders\n;Political parties\n|Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG) → Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Democratic and Republican Alliance (ADERE)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Democratic Union of Builders (UDB)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Other factions\n|Military|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Status\n;Symbols\nElected unopposed\nDied in office\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Elected\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Political party\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Prime minister(s)\n|-\n!
