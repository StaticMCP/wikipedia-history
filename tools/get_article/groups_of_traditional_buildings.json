They can be post towns, castle towns, mining towns, merchant quarters, ports, farming or fishing villages, etc. The Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs recognizes and protects the country's cultural properties under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties.\nMunicipalities can designate items of particular importance as  and approve measures to protect them. Items of even higher importance are then designated  by the central government. The Agency for Cultural Affairs then provides guidance, advice, and funds for repairs and other work. Additional support is given in the form of preferential tax treatment.\nAs of May 23, 2024, 129 districts have been classified as Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings.\nList of Important Preservation Districts\nCriteria\nImportant Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings are designated according to three criteria:\n#Groups of traditional buildings that show excellent design as a whole\n#Groups of traditional buildings and land distribution that preserve the old state of affairs well\n#Groups of traditional buildings and their surrounding environment that show remarkable regional characteristics\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n!
