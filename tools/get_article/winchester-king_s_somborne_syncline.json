It lies at the western end of the South Downs, immediately to the north of the Winchester-East Meon Anticline and east of Salisbury Plain.\nStructure\nThe fold axis runs for around  from north of East Tytherley in the west, between Winchester and Kings Worthy, towards Four Marks in the east. To the north-east of Winchester the fold axis is followed by the valley of the River Itchen, which turns abruptly south to cut across the structure and the Winchester-East Meon Anticline to the south.\nParallel folds to the north include the Stockbridge Anticline and the Micheldever Syncline. To the south-west across the River Test is the similar Alderbury-Mottisfont Syncline. As with other nearby folds, the structure is controlled by movement of fault blocks within the Jurassic strata below.\nSee also\nList of geological folds in Great Britain\nReferences"
