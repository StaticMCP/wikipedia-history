The -story wood-frame house was built c. 1890 for Mrs. Edward Hall by Charles Bacon, owner of the Felt Mills in Winchester.  It is one of the most elaborate treatments of Queen Anne style in the town, with asymmetrical massing typical of the style, Art Nouveau carvings in some of its gable ends, an elaborately decorated porch, and a turret with conical roof.  The interior was destroyed by fire in 1893.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Arlington, Massachusetts\nReferences"
