It was signed by Willy Brandt and Walter Scheel for West Germany's side and by Alexei Kosygin and Andrei Gromyko for the Soviet Union.\nDescription\nIn the 1970s, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik was a policy that \"abandoned, at least for the time being, its claims with respect to German self-determination and reunification, recognising de facto the existence of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the Oder–Neisse line\".\nBoth sides expressed their ambition to strive for a normalisation of the relations between the European states while they kept international peace and to follow the guidelines of the Article 2 of the UN Charter.\nThe signees renounced the use of force and recognised the postwar borders, specifically, the Oder–Neisse line, which hived off a large portion of historical eastern Germany to Poland and the Soviet Union.\nIt also enshrined the division between East Germany and West Germany, thus contributing a valuable element of stability into the relationship between the two countries.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Moscow (disambiguation), for other treaties known by this name\n*Treaty of Warsaw from December 7, 1970\n*Four Power Agreement on Berlin from September 3, 1971\n*Basic Treaty from December 21, 1972\nReferences\n* [http://www.documentarchiv.de/brd/1970/moskauer-vertrag.html Wording of the Treaty Of Moscow].\n* [http://www.portalus.ru/modules/history/rus_readme.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1142027784&archive=&start_from=&ucat=2&category=2 Texts of FRG Treaties with Socialist Countries in 1970–1973].\n* [http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_moscow_treaty_12_august_1970-en-d5341cb5-1a49-4603-aec9-0d2304c25080.html The Moscow Treaty (12 August 1970)] (in English) retrieved from the CVCE website.
