However, the proposed changes were approved by 93% of voters.\nIn the 1991 parliamentary elections the party ran in an alliance with the Democratic Union for Social Renewal (UDRS). The alliance won two seats, with Dassoundo becoming one of its MPs. By 1992 the party was led by Adekpedjou Sylvain Akindes.\nThe party contested the 1995 parliamentary elections alone, receiving 1.4% of the vote and winning one seat, taken by Antoine Idji Kolawolé. However, it lost its single seat in the 1999 elections.\nReferences"
