He was elected to Coquitlam City Council in 2005, and became mayor in 2008.\nPersonal life\nHe was married in 1983 to Anna Rosa, they have four children.

Stewart is a writer, and has operated his own publishing, government relations and communications business.\nIn 2004, MLA Elayne Brenzinger, then an independent, accused Stewart of improper conduct, claiming he had groped her. Brenzinger later retracted the allegations and issued an apology.\nOn November 15, 2008, Stewart was elected as mayor of Coquitlam in the British Columbia municipal elections, beating out incumbent Maxine Wilson.\nIn 2016, Stewart revealed that he had been wearing the same suit to work events for the past fifteen months, in an effort to highlight the double standard that women in the public sphere, particularly in politics, are subject to over their appearance. He stated that while he had heard of female colleagues at both the municipal and provincial levels of government receiving negative comments about their outfits and hairstyles, particularly when they re-used outfits, he had never heard of a male politician receiving similar comments. Although his original intention was to carry on until someone noticed, he went public after fifteen months because \"I was wearing the same suit to every meeting and (there was) no indication that anyone was ever going to notice.\"\nIn 2022, the Metro Vancouver Regional District, of which Coquitlam is a member, became involved in a dispute with construction company Acciona over a building project in North Vancouver. In fall 2022, a lawsuit filed by Metro Vancouver alleged that Anika Calder, the daughter of Coquitlam city manager Peter Steblin and an employee with Acciona, had used Stewart's login and password access confidential legal documents relating to this dispute, then provided copies of the documents to Acciona. , the city council has not commented on the allegations officially. In an interview in January 2023, Stewart stated that the details presented by Metro Vancouver \"aren't entirely accurate,\" and suggested that additional information would be presented at trial.\nCity Councillor committees\n* Chair of the Livable Communities Advisory Committee\n* Chair of the Disability Issues Advisory Committee\n* Chair of the Maillardville Revitalization Committee\n* Member of the GVRD Labour Relations Bureau\n* Chair of the Parcel Tax Review Panel\n* Council representative to the Fraser-Burrard Community Justice Society\n* Member of the Executive of Lower Mainland Municipal Association\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.richardstewart.ca/ Official website]"
