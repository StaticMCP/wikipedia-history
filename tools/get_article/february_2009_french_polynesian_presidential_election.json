There were seven changes of government in French Polynesia since the 2004 general election.\nThe President was chosen by members of the Assembly.\nElection background\nSix of the members of President Gaston Tong Sang's governing coalition had quit in the months proceeding the 2009 presidential election, leaving his government open to potential challengers. In January 2009, Tong Sang had opened negotiations with Oscar Temaru to try to create a union government and set the stage for new elections. The negotiations failed to produce any tangible results, and were deemed as a failure.\nPresident Tong Sang announced on 7 February 2009, that he would step down ahead of a proposed censure motion against his government by a coalition of pro-separatist parties led by Temaru. Tong Sang's resignation, which he described as \"immediate\" was widely expected in the French Polynesian media, which characterized the move as a \"strategy of resignation\".\nThe censure motion proposal against the Tong Sang government was supported by the Union for Democracy (UPLD), Tahoera'a Huiraatira, and Rautahi political parties. Together these parties put Temaru forward as their candidate for president as part of the no confidence measure. Supporters of the censure motion claimed that they could guarantee the support of 31 of the 57 members in the Assembly.\nFollowing his announcement of his intent to resign, Tong Sang immediately left Tahiti for Bora Bora, where he also serves as the mayor.\nTemaru, who also served as the President of the Assembly at the time, accepted Tong Sang's resignation, paving the way for a new presidential election.\nElection\nOscar Temaru appeared likely to be elected President, but shortly before the election, there were reports that the accord between Temaru, Gaston Flosse and Jean Christophe Bouissou had broken up again, calling into question Temaru's chances.\nFour candidates were nominated:\n* Oscar Temaru, by Tavini Huiraatira and the Union for Democracy\n* Gaston Tong Sang, by O Porinetia To Tatou Ai'a\n* Edouard Fritch, by Tahoera'a Huiraatira\n* Sandra Levy Agami, formerly a member of Tong Sang's alliance\nFirst round\nIn the first round of voting in the morning, Temaru received 24 votes, Tong Sang 20, Fritch 12 and Levy Agami one. The first round thus proved inconclusive, leading to a second round in the afternoon.\nSecond round\nThe second round of the election was held later on the afternoon of February 11, 2009. Temaru and Tong Sang advanced from the morning's first round. The Assembly elected Oscar Temaru as the next President during the second round. Temaru won 37 votes in the Assembly, which was 17 more votes than outgoing former President Tong Sang's 20. Temaru was elected thanks to support from the Tahoera'a Huiraatira party. The Tahoera'a Huiraatira candidate, Edouard Fritch, was defeated in the first round, and later support to Temaru. Temaru became President of French Polynesia for the fourth time in less than five years.\nThe coalition which allowed Temaru to return to power consisted of Temaru's Union for Democracy, Flosse's and Fritch's Tahoeraa Huiraatira and Bouissou's Rautahi party.\nIn his nomination speech to the Assembly, Temaru described the current tourism situation in French Polynesia as \"catastrophic\". Temaru noted that hotel occupancy rates in Bora Bora and Moorea are currently less than 20% on certain days due to the world financial crisis. He explained that the huge drop in foreign visitors may cause the government to cut the work hours of government employees, lay off workers or close state-owned hotels.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | French Polynesian presidential election, 2009\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 15em\" rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 12em\" colspan=\"2\" |First round\n! style=\"width: 12em\" colspan=\"2\" |Second round\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:blue; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Tavini Huiraatira\n| Oscar Temaru\n| align=\"right\" | 24\n| align=\"right\" | 42.11%\n| align=\"right\" | 37\n| align=\"right\" | 64.91%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:red; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | O Porinetia To Tatou Ai'a\n| Gaston Tong Sang\n| align=\"right\" | 20\n| align=\"right\" | 35.09%\n| align=\"right\" | 20\n| align=\"right\" | 35.09%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:orange; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Tahoera'a Huiraatira\n| Edouard Fritch\n| align=\"right\" | 12\n| align=\"right\" | 21.05%\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent\n| Sandra Levy Agami\n| align=\"right\" | 1\n| align=\"right\" | 1.75%\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 57\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 57\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n|}\nReferences"
