He was known as one of three members of the commission which revoked the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Evans was the only member who voted to allow Oppenheimer to retain his security clearance, stating that failure to clear Oppenheimer would be \"a black mark on the escutcheon of our country.\".\nBiography\nEvans was born in Rawlinsville, Pennsylvania, on June 6, 1880, the son of Elizabeth (née Oldham) and Jacob Evans, a farmer.\nHe studied at Millersville State Normal School (now known as Millersville University) in 1900, a B.A. at Franklin and Marshall College (1907), and a Ph.D. at Columbia University (1916). In 1916 he joined the faculty of Northwestern University as an instructor in chemistry. During the first world war, Evans spent a year in the army, where he was involved in testing explosives at Catholic University and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Mines. Evans then returned to Northwestern in 1918, where he remained until 1945, becoming department chair in 1942. In 1947 he joined the chemistry department at Loyola University Chicago, retiring as chair in 1951.\nFor more than 20 years, Evans served on the national council of the American Chemical Society, and in 1946 received an Honor Scroll from the American Institute of Chemists. An authority on explosions, Evans served as a consultant as well as expert witness on lawsuits related to explosions.\nIn 1954 Evans served as one of three panel members at the security clearance hearing of J. Robert Oppenheimer. He was the only member who voted to allow Oppenheimer to retain his security clearance.\nEvans died on August 2, 1957, at Lancaster General Hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
