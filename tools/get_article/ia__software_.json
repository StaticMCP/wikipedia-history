She uses Yamaha Corporation's Vocaloid 3 singing synthesizer technology. Her voice is created using samples of Lia. She has performed at live concerts onstage as either an animated projection or a Pepper's ghost. A rhythm game featuring her called IA/VT Colorful was made. Many songs have been made with her.\nIA's name was taken from her voice provider's name, \"Lia\". She was illustrated by Aka Akasaka, the author of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War and Oshi no Ko.\nDevelopment\nAfter Lia got married and became pregnant in 2009, she was forced to put her career on hold. Because of this, production began on IA as a way to \"stand in\" as a substitute during the singer's absence.\nIA was developed by 1st Place Co., Ltd. using Yamaha's Vocaloid 3. Her voice was created by taking voice samples from Japanese singer Lia at a controlled pitch and tone. She was the first release for the \"Aria on the Planetes\" project, of which the CeVIO Creative Studio vocal, also made by 1st Place, named \"One\", is also a part of.\nThe design philosophy 1st Place worked toward was to make the voice simple but easy to adjust and customize, letting creators create their own version of IA.\nIn October 2013, IA's software was announced to have an update for the Mac during the promotional period for the IA × Super GT Circuit Beats album.\nAdditional software\nIn 2014, a prototype vocal called \"IA -Aria On the Planetes- α Type C\" was released as a free trial version via a one-month-long feedback campaign.\nOn June 27, 2014, a new add-on for IA, called IA Rocks, was released. Once imported into the Vocaloid 4, it was possible to cross-synthesis the two vocals.\nIn January 2016, it was announced she would be released for CeVIO Creative Studio, receiving a talking vocal; this was released in 2018.\nMarketing\nInformation on IA was released much more slowly than the average Vocaloid. Her promotions have taken the approach to make her seem otherworldly and mysterious.\nThe licensing for IA is slightly different than past Vocaloids. Unlike some past Vocaloids, users can use her image on CDs, flyers and posters without requesting permission, although some consent from the company is needed for greater use of her image. This is a departure from past Vocaloids such as Crypton Future Media, which requires permission for use of their Vocaloids' images on things such as CDs, flyers and posters.\nCharacteristics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Name || IA\n|-\n| Release || January 27, 2012\n|-\n|-\n| Suggested genre || Pop, jazz\n|-\n| Suggested tempo || 63–228 bpm, 95–228 bpm (rocks)\n|-\n| Suggested vocal range || B2-A4\n|}\nFeatured music\n\"Children Record\" () by Jin is considered one of her most popular songs with over 3,000,000 views on Niconico and over 18,000,000 views on YouTube.\n\"Six Trillion Years and Overnight Story\" () by Kemu is also considered to be one of her most popular songs, with over 8,000,000 views on Niconico and over 54,000,000 views on YouTube.\n\"Night Sky Patrol of Tomorrow\" (アスノヨゾラ哨戒班) by Orangestar is the most viewed IA song on YouTube with over 61,000,000 views, followed by \"DAYBREAK FRONTLINE\" by the same producer with over 57,000,000 views on YouTube.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://1stplace.co.jp/ Official Website]"
