Players get to choose one of the contestants to play and complete to win against it's champion: President Conductor Aalvado, Duke of Destruction, Admiral of Diesel and Steam. Players customize their train with powerful upgrades and special abilities while building their deck of cards to aid their playstyle. When playing the game, they need to use their deck of cards around tracks, items, and abilities. They'll win some new prizes in various special events, each packed with some surprises along the way.\nGameshow\nFor the game-show, a random audience member is selected as a contestant.\nSimilar to the game Slay the Spire, the contestant makes their way through different challenges, layed out on a map.\nThe events on the map include battles, champion battles, minigames, shops, workshops (an opportunity to repair the train), story nodes, and random events.\nCompleting the challenges rewards the player not only with coins and cards to improve their deck, but also with trains parts which grant permanent upgrades. Except for hats and stickers, the player can only have one train part of each type though; the old part is swapped out when a new one is acquired.\nBefore facing the boss battle the contestant has to pass the Door of Worthiness.\nThe story nodes are animated cutscenes consisting of clips from a documentary about the game-show. The story progress is persistent and not reset at the end of the run. The unlocked cutscenes can be found and re-watched in the collection (reachable from the main menu).\nThe player is allowed to pick one of three random contestants for the run.\nThe contestants come with different cards added to the starting deck and usually have one starting train part.\nTutorial\nWhen playing the game for the first time, the player starts with the character Cherlyl and is given a tutorial. The tutorial consists of a train battle against Hank Hannigan, the Presenter, Showhost, and Voice of the Network of the game-show.\nAfter the tutorial, a run of the game show starts automatically, keeping Cherlyl as the contestant.\nThe tutorial can also be played again from the main menu later.\nDaily Run\nThe daily run is a seeded run of the game-show with a leaderboard where players can compete for the highscore. In the daily run the game displays the time remaining time until the leaderboard is reset and a new seed of the day is generated.\nThe player only gets one attempt at each daily run, it cannot be played again after completing it.\nIn the daily run the player is only given one contestant instead of being allowed to pick one.\nDevelopment and Release\nLorem Ipsum\nReferences\nExternal links"
