It then follows the Congo River, before reaching the confluence with the Ubangi River, one of its tributaries. Much of this segment of the border is poorly defined, and has been the subject of territorial disputes. The remainder of the border follows the Ubangi up to the tripoint with the Central African Republic.\nSettlements near the border\n* Kinshasa, Kwamouth, Bolobo, Yumbi, Irebu\n* Brazzaville, Impfondo, Dongou, Bétou\nSee also\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo–Republic of the Congo relations\nReferences"
