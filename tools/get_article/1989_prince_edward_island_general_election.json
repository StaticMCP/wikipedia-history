In this election, the Liberals won 60.7% of the popular vote, the highest percentage that a winning party has taken on record in Prince Edward Island. The Progressive Conservatives won 2 seats despite taking 36 percent of the popular vote; they were due 12 seats. This was the lowest share of the vote that the Progressive Conservatives ever received, 35.8%. Only 5 times has the Opposition had 2 or fewer seats in the history of Prince Edward Island; this was one of them.\nOne of the two members from each constituency is styled a Councillor, and the other an Assemblyman. In electoral contests Councillor candidates run against Councillor candidates; Assemblyman candidates against Assemblyman candidates.\nOpinion polls\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:85%;line-height:14px;\" align=\"center\"\n|+ Evolution of voting intentions at provincial level\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Polling firm\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Last day of survey\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Source\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"| PEILA\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"| PCPEI\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"| NDPPEI\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Sample\n|- style=\"line-height:5px;\"\n! style=\"background:;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! style=\"background:;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! style=\"background:;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |Election 1989\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |May 29, 1989\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |60.7\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |35.8\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |3.5\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |\n|-\n|Baseline Research\n|May 10, 1989\n|\n|style=\"background:#EA6D6A\"|68\n|26\n|6\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |Election 1986\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |April 21, 1986\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |50.3\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |45.5\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |4.0\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |\n| style=\"background:#ffd;\" |\n|}\nParty standings\n{| style=\"width:55%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#EA6D6A; width:93.75%;\" | 30\n| style=\"background:#9999FF; width:6.25%;\" | 2\n|-\n| Liberal\n| PC\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1986\n!Elected\n!Change\n!#\n!%\n!Change\n|Liberal\n|Joe Ghiz\n! align=right|21\n! align=right|30\n| align=right|+9\n! align=right|85,982\n! align=right|60.7%\n| align=right|+10.4%\n|\n|Mel Gass\n| align=right|11\n| align=right|2\n| align=right|-9\n| align=right|50,731\n| align=right|35.8%\n| align=right|-9.7%\n|\n|Jim Mayne\n| align=right|0\n| align=right|0\n| align=right|-\n| align=right|4,902\n| align=right|3.5%\n| align=right|-0.5%\n|-\n|}\n|60.72}}\n|35.82}}\n|3.46}}}}|93.75}}\n|6.25}}}}\nMembers elected\nThe Legislature of Prince Edward Island had two levels of membership from 1893 to 1996 - Assemblymen and Councillors. This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district. Before 1963, Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district, but afterward they were elected in the same manner as Assemblymen.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
