Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads, plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, tomatoes, melons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles).\nHistory\nSlavery and indentured servitude were critical elements of the development of colonial agriculture in Maryland. The first documented Africans were brought to Maryland in 1642, as 13 slaves at St. Mary's City, the first English settlement in the Province. Slave labor made possible the export-driven plantation economy. The English observer William Strickland wrote of agriculture in Virginia and Maryland in the 1790s:\nNothing can be conceived more inert than a slave; his unwilling labour is discovered in every step he takes; he moves not if he can avoid it; if the eyes of the overseer be off him, he sleeps. The ox and horse, driven by the slave, appear to sleep also; all is listless inactivity; all motion is evidently compulsory.\nMarylanders might agree in principle that slavery could and should be abolished, but they were slow to achieve it statewide. Although the need for slaves had declined with the shift away from tobacco culture, and slaves were being sold to the Deep South, slavery was still too deeply embedded into Maryland society for the wealthiest whites to give it up voluntarily on a wide scale. Wealthy planters exercised considerable economic and political power in the state. Slavery did not end until after the Civil War.\nThe southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times, but declined greatly after a state government buy-out in the 1990s.\nModern urban farms have been established in cities like Baltimore.\nProcessing\nThere is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.\nCrops\nStrawberries\nIn 2017 a total of  was grown. This crop is grown in all counties and the City of Baltimore.\n(Botrytis cinerea) is a common problem as it is around the world. Fernández-Ortuño et al., 2014 finds populations here have resistance to fludioxonil and to thiophanate-methyl. Many are multiresistant.\nHu et al.,  also find widespread resistance to SDHIs here. They find several etiologies, with various sdhB alleles producing the resistance.  resistance to boscalid, H272R or  multiresistance to boscalid and to penthiopyrad, H272Y resistance to boscalid, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad, and  or  resistance to boscalid, to fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad. There appears to be no resistance to benzovindiflupyr here. This is because it is a new substance.\nMuch of the phytoplasma research here in the 1990s was conducted by the Jomantiene group at USDA ARS Beltsville. This includes the first detection of both  and  in this crop here. This is also the first report of STRAWB2 anywhere outside of Florida.\nis common here. This is a disease with an uncertain etiology thought to involve several combined pathogens.\nIssues\nAgriculture in Maryland faces significant challenges from pollution and climate change.\nPests\nFarming suffers from weeds as anywhere else, including an unusual multiply resistant ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) found by Rousonelos et al., 2012 with both ALS- and PPO-resistances and which by 2016 had developed a third, EPSP resistance. This ragweed population is a drag on soybean cultivation and, , is the worst multiresistant weed problem in the state.\nSee also\n* Slavery in Maryland\nReferences"
