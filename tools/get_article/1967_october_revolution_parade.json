Commanding the parade was First Deputy Commander of the Moscow Military District, Colonel General Yevgeny Ivanovsky.\nParade events\nAs 1967 being the golden jubilee anniversary parade it would feature troops dressed up as historical units from the Russian civil war era. It would also feature the first color guard on parade from the honor guard.

Nationwide, the events were aired live on monochrome on Soviet Central Television. Moscow TV viewers saw the first color broadcasts during that parade for the first time on Programme 1 and Moscow Programme 3.\nFull order of the golden jubilee parade\nThe parade displayed the latest Soviet weaponry, with a news report describing it as \"a new muscle in every major category... ranging from a massive three-stage intercontinental missile to a relatively tiny anti-tank missile on a reconnaissance car.\"\nGround Column\nFollowing the limousine carrying the parade commander, the parade marched past in the following sequence:\n* Historical Units and Colors\n**Colour Guard wearing armed workers' uniforms of the Revolution and Civil War\n** Red Guards\n** Former Imperial Russian Army personnel with the Red Army\n** Naval contingent\n** Red Army personnel of 1922\n** Historical Cavalry Units\n** Tachanka\n** Historical horse artillery\n** Historical Armored Units\n* Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College\n* Frunze Military Academy\n* V.I.

On the right, the circle is surrounded by a strip in the form of a Ribbon of Saint George, and on the left, on a white strip in two lines. The number \"50\" is engraved in the lower part of the badge. The diameter of the badge is 30&nbsp;mm.\nCelebrations of the golden jubilee\nAfter the parade in Moscow the demonstration march of the workers of various sectors of the Soviet Union took place, preceded by an historic fireworks display at the beginning – one that had never been performed before – to mark the golden jubilee anniversary of the Revolution. The daytime fireworks display was a once in a lifetime moment and one of the big highlights of that year's Red Square parade. There were parades in cities such as Yerevan, Baku, Tselinograd (modern day Nur-Sultan), Priozersk, and Kubyshev (modern day Samara). During the parade on Lenin Square in Baku, the parade was opened by a guard of honor (from the Baku Higher Combined Arms Command School) instead of drummers, one of the first cities to do that in their annual parade.\nReferences"
