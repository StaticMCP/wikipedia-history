It was released worldwide as the album's first single on 9 April 1984.\nBackground\nIts meaning consists of the lasting memories of the main character Reg, and displays the benefits and problems associated with his hitchhiking, both figuratively and metaphorically. During the song, Waters mentions such popular icons as Dick Tracy, Shane and Yoko Ono. Waters has said the inclusion of Yoko Ono in the song comes from a dream his drummer Andy Newmark had.\nTrack listings\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1984)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|30\n|-\n|\n|-\n|US Mainstream Rock Songs  (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|The Netherlands\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discogs.com/Roger-Waters-The-Pros-And-Cons-Of-Hitch-Hiking/master/50077 The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking] at Discogs\n* Roger Waters [http://www.roger-waters.com/ official website]"
