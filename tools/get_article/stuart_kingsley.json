In other words, instead of \"listening\" for extraterrestrial intelligence, Optical SETI \"looks\" for it.\nKingsley received a B.Sc. Honors and Ph.D. in electronic and electrical engineering from The City University (London, England), and University College London, England in 1972 and 1984, respectively. He moved to the United States in 1981 and went to work for Battelle Columbus Division as a principal research scientist, becoming a senior research scientist in 1985. He left Battelle in 1987 and established his own photonics consultancy business, Fiberdyne Optoelectronics.\nKingsley is the Director of The Columbus Optical SETI Observatory, which is currently working to achieve nonprofit status. Since 1992 he has been the VP for Engineering at SRICO, Inc.  Kingsley retired from Srico, Inc. and returned to England in 2008, meaning that the Columbus Optical SETI Observatory has effectively moved to Bournemouth.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.stuartkingsley.com/ Introduction to the COSETI]\n* [http://www.setileague.org/admin/kingsley.htm The SETI League's Optical SETI Committee Chair]\n* [http://www.boseti.org The Bournemouth Optical SETI Observatory]"
