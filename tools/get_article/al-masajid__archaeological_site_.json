Yada'il Zarih I built the three most important temples dedicated to the Moon god Almaqah: the temple of Awwam in front of the gates of the capital city Ma'rib, the temple of Sirwah, and the temple of Masajid, which was named ''Ma'rib'', after the Sabaean capital city (with which it should not be confused). Around it, Yada'il Zarih I placed fortifications, which are repeatedly referred to as Murad. Inscriptions found on the site have been published as  3949 and Gl 1108, 1109, 1122, 1116 and 1120. Jacqueline Pirenne, an expert on Semitic languages, was able to use inscriptions of the site to determine how the visual depiction of Old South Arabian letters changed over time.\nTemple\nThe elliptical temple site is in a poor state of preservation; the temple itself lies in rubble. Only the remains of the foundations give any clue of the building's appearance. The Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry, who first described the temple, was able to show that it had been a rectangular structure, of a sort with many parallels. This rectangular peristyle surrounded a courtyard, with a cella on one side. Offerings were placed in the courtyard (see RES 2771 and 2774). The whole complex was surrounded by a stone peribolos wall measuring 100 x 37 metres. On the front side of this, there were three entrances. The middle one of these entrances was given special emphasis by a pillared propylon. The ground plan and form of the structure reflect the prototype of the Sabaean temple building.\nThe temple was an active religious site for centuries, so it frequently had to be renovated and modified in response to new trends. In the course of time, ornamental elements were added, such as floral compositions and elements influenced by foreign practices. The temple would have contained over-life-size, metal animal sculptures, as well as votive gifts and dedications in the form of inscribed stelae and other figural images.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Horst Kopp (ed.).
