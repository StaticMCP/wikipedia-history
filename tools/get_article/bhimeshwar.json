At the time of the 2011 Nepal census, it had a population of 32,486 people living in 8,639 individual households. The town is located at an altitude of 1,554 metres (5,101&nbsp;feet). The name of the district Dolakha came from Dolakha Town situated north-east of the headquarters Charikot Bazaar.\nBoundaries\nThe region is bordered by the Sun Kosi River on the west and the Khimti Khola River on the east. It is divided unequally by the River Tama Koshi and Charnawoti Khola, proportionately two-thirds to the west of the river and one-third to the east.\nTo the north east lies the impressive Rolwaling Himal to the western edge of which are such peaks as Gauri Shankar and Melungtse. Gauri Shankar is synonymous with the god Shiva and his consort Parvati.\nGeography\nTo the northwest the mountains slope gently downwards towards the ancient pass of Kuti that starts above the Tibetan town of Khasa and follows the waters of the Bhote Kosi from Tibet. The river flows past Kodari and Tatopani (Hot Springs) on the Nepalese side and gradually rushes down into an ever-widening stream of water that becomes the Sun Kosi.\nThe Khimti Khola drains down from a region of five lakes called Panch Pokhari. They have a specific place in legend and go by the names of Mohi (buttermilk), Jata (hair), Dudh (milk), Bahula (insane), and Bhut (ghost). People believe that if one bathes in Bahula Pokhari one will become insane, whereas the Ghost Lake cannot bear the smell of human perspiration and will pull one inside its murky waters to a certain death if you as much as venture near it. The Khimti Khola joins the Tama Koshi, as do the Khare Khola and Rolwaling Khola to the northeast and the Sangawati, Dolti and Charnewati Kholas to the west.\nThe riverine valleys open out into massive volcanic folds. Sub-tropical settlements on the banks of rivers boast banana trees, guava, and an abundance of fish. Above the banks hover the terraced fields of paddy, make, wheat, and millet.\nBetween Bhimeshwar and Jiri the road descends to 845 metres and is bordered by plantations of sugar-cane. Above these slopes are forests of dark oak, fir and pine, interspersed with tangles of bracken and fem all in the embrace of clinging orchids and coloured in the springtime by the rhododendrons, the national flower of Nepal.\nMosses cling to the shaded rocks and in the forests are wild strawberries, loganberries, red berries and thyme.\nDestination\nDolakha is approximately 139&nbsp;km from the Capital of Nepal, Kathmandu.

Each community brings unique traditions, languages, and customs, enriching the local heritage. The Tamang people, known for their vibrant culture and skilled craftsmanship, constitute a significant portion of the population, along with Sherpas renowned for their mountaineering prowess and unique religious practices.\nThe Newars (Newa:), traditionally associated with urban centres and trade up to Lhasa, Tibet, add a distinct cultural dimension to the region.\nThami people have traditionally sustained themselves through agriculture, animal husbandry, and craftsmanship. Their language, Thami Kham, belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family and is crucial to their cultural identity. The Thami community is known for its vibrant festivals, such as \"Bisu,\" celebrated to mark the New Year, and \"Gai Jatra,\" a festival honouring departed souls. Despite facing challenges such as marginalization and socio-economic disparities, the Thami people continue to preserve their cultural heritage and strive for recognition and empowerment within Nepal's diverse social tapestry.\nBrahmins and Chhetris, predominantly engaged in various professions, hold significant social influence, while Dalits contribute to the socio-economic diversity of Dolakha. This ethnic amalgamation reflects the complexity and unity of Dolakha's society, where diverse identities coexist harmoniously.\nMedia\nTo promote local culture Bhimeshwar has two community radio stations Sailung (104&nbsp;MHz) and Radio Kalinchowk (106.4&nbsp;MHz).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.facebook.com/hillstationtv Hill Station Dolakha]\n* [http://www.un.org.np/maps/district-constituency-maps/central/Dolakha.pdf UN map of the municipalities of Dolakha District]\n*[https://www.dolakha.info/ Web site about Dolakha]"
