While other hijackings in this time period were related to political defection or personal gains., the hijackings by Palestinian militant groups, were often high profile, violent and polically charged. Groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Black September carried out hijackings with the stated aims of demanding prisoner releases, drawing international attention to their cause, and pressuring governments. These attacks played a significant role in shaping global aviation security policies, leading to measures such as the introduction of metal detectors and the strengthening of counterterrorism responses by airlines and governments.\nSeveral of these incidents had long-term geopolitical consequences, such as the Dawson's Field hijackings of 1970, which prompted international crackdowns on air piracy, and the Entebbe hijacking of 1976, which led to a military rescue operation by Israeli forces.\nThere were significant tensions among airline pilots and organizations like the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations (IFALPA) during the late 1960s and early 1970s due to the rising number of hijackings. Pilots were deeply concerned about the lack of effective international responses to the growing threat of air piracy\nIn 1970, after a wave of high-profile hijackings - including the Dawson's Field hijackings carried out by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) - airline pilots, represented by the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations (IFALPA), threatened to strike. Their goal was to pressure governments and aviation authorities into implementing stronger security measures and more decisive responses to the growing threat of hijackings. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) did not organize or endorse the strike, it played a crucial role in the diplomatic efforts to combat air piracy. These efforts included the development of anti-hijacking conventions and the promotion of stricter airport security protocols.\nThe pilots' strike threats significantly heightened the sense of urgency among governments, contributing to the swift adoption of the Hague Convention of 1970, which established a stronger international legal framework for prosecuting hijackers and deterring future incidents.\nThis list includes confirmed aircraft hijackings and attacks attributed to Palestinian militant groups, based on credible historical and journalistic sources.\nThe criteria used for this list:\n* Attempted and successful aircraft hijackings committed by Palestinian militant groups or individuals and persons with Palestinian sympathies.\n* Successful sabotage or bombings of aircraft by Palestinian militant groups.\n* Attempted and successful attacks on stationary aircraft on the ground by Palestinian militant groups or individuals.\nHistory\nAircraft hijackings related to Palestinians started in the 1960s and continued up to the 1990s. The hijackings can be grouped into the following decades, with a count of registered incidents.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto;\"\n|+Aircraft hijack incidents by Palestinean militant groups, 1968–1996\n!Year\n|1960\n|1970\n|1980\n|1990\n!Total\n|-\n!Number\n|4\n|18\n|5\n|1\n|28\n|}\n1960s\n* July 23, 1968: To date, the only successful El Al hijacking attempt, as three members of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked El Al Flight 426 from Rome to Tel Aviv.
