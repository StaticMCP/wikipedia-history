It was founded by the Asaihemara Modaito clan of the Afars who came from the La'o and Doobi areas.\nHistory\nThe Sultanate of Aussa (Afar Sultanate) succeeded the earlier Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when Muhammad Gasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa (Asaita) with the split of the Adal Sultanate into the Imamate of Aussa and Emirate of Harar. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne. On 26 September 1725, the Mudaito Afars and their Harla allies invaded Aussa from the North-east Eli Da'ar and central-west of Andhar Kalu and burnt the state of Awsa. They began Modaito expansion through Dobi and Kalo by ransacking Adali settlements. The following month they defeated Imam Salman's soldiers, killing 200 Imamate soldiers. By 1734, Kedafo prevailed as Amoyta over the imamate and established the Mudaito dynasty. The primary symbol of the sultan was a silver baton, which was considered to have magical properties.\nIn June 1764, the Mudaito extended their area of control by overpowering Imamate tribes in and around Awsa. In July 1809, Amir Mahammad bin A'as Ali confronted the Mudaito to avenge his father's killing in Awsa but failed. In the following years, The Mudaito unleashed heavy blows against the pro-Imamate warriors of Adali Debne We'ima when the powerful Adals tried to halt Mudaito advance. In 1814, the Mudaito invaded Tadjourah, the capital of Adali Dardars, killing Adali rulers and destroying homes. This shaped the power struggle in Afar history in favour of Mudaito's rule which allowed the expansion of Mudaito's Awsa Sultanate lasting up until the colonial reorganisation in 1936.\nRulers\nThe following is a list of Mudaito dynasty rulers (Amoyta).\n| life1       =\n| reignstart1 = 1734\n| reignend1   = 1749\n| notes1      =\n| family1     =\n| image1      =\n| alt1        =\n| name2       = Kadhafo Mahammad ibn Kadhafo\n| nickname2   =\n| native2     =\n| life2       =\n| reignstart2 = 1749\n| reignend2   = 1779\n| notes2      =\n| family2     =\n| image2      =\n| alt2        =\n| name3       = Aydahis ibn Kadhafo Mahammad\n| nickname3   =\n| native3     =\n| life3       =\n| reignstart3 = 1779\n| reignend3   = 1801\n| notes3      =\n| family3     =\n| image3      =\n| alt3        =\n| name4       = \"Asa\" Aydahis ibn Mahammad ibn Aydahis\n| nickname4   =\n| native4     =\n| life4       =\n| reignstart4 = 1801\n| reignend4   = 1832\n| notes4      = First official Amoyta\n| family4     =\n| image4      =\n| alt4        =\n| name5       = Hanfere ibn Aydahis\n| nickname5   =\n| native5     =\n| life5       =\n| reignstart5 = 1832\n| reignend5   = 1862\n| notes5      =\n| family5     =\n| image5      =\n| alt5        =\n| name6       = Mahammad \"Illalta\" ibn Hanfere\n| nickname6   =\n| native6     =\n| life6       =\n| reignstart6 = 1862\n| reignend6   = 1902\n| notes6      = Won the battle of Arraddo against Menelik II in 1896.\n| family6     =\n| image6      =\n| alt6        =\n| name7       = Mahammad ibn Aydahis ibn Hanfere\n| nickname7   =\n| native7     =\n| life7       =\n| reignstart7 = 1902\n| reignend7   =  1910\n| notes7      = Starting from 1902, the governorship of Mahammad ibn Aydahis was challenged by his cousins, the nine sons of his direct predecessor, Aydahis, Alimirah, Kadhafo, Hanfadhe, Alo and Yayyo (the later sultan)\n| family7     =\n| image7      =\n| alt7        =\n| name8       = Yayyo ibn Mahammad ibn Hanfere\n| nickname8   =\n| native8     =\n| life8       =\n| reignstart8 =  1902\n| reignend8   = 1927\n| notes8      =\n| family8     =\n| image8      =\n| alt8        =\n| name9       = Mahammad Yayyo\n| nickname9   =\n| native9     =\n| life9       =\n| reignstart9 = 1927\n| reignend9   = 1944\n| notes9      =\n| family9     =\n| image9      =\n| alt9        =\n| name10       = Alimirah Hanfere\n| nickname10   =\n| native10     =\n| life10       =\n| reignstart10 = 1944\n| reignend10   = 2011\n| notes10      = In 1945 Awsa is incorporated into Ethiopia.
