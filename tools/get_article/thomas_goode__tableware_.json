It held two royal warrants to supply the British royal household, one from Queen Elizabeth II and the other from the Prince of Wales. The company was owned by property entrepreneur Johnny Sandelson since 2018 and had since expanded its operations into India opening a store and museum in Mumbai.\nHistory\nThe business was established in 1827 by Thomas Goode, and expanded by his son William. The younger Goode designed china ranges for both Queen Victoria and the Tsar of Russia. The store moved to its South Audley Street site in 1845. In 1875 its showroom was redesigned by the architects Peto and George.\nThe company was owned by the Liberal Democrat peer Rumi Verjee from 1995 to 2018.\nThe building was sold to property entrepreneur Cain for £80 million in 2015, but Verjee retained ownership of the business. Johnny Sandelson acquired the business in 2018.\nIt was closed at 2024.\nThe Thomas Goode Elephants\nAs part of The Paris Exhibition in 1889, Minton pottery was commissioned to create two, seven feet tall majolica elephants to display. These elephants were on display in the windows of Thomas Goode.\nReferences\nExternal links"
