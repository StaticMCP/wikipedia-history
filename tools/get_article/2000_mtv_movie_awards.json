The ceremony aired on MTV on Saturday, June 3, 2000 from Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. In conjunction with the success of Sex and the City, the awards show presented a parody of Sex and the City and The Matrix during the program's opening. It featured the Sex and the City cast (Samantha Jones, Miranda Hobbes, and Charlotte York) as they listened intently as Carrie Bradshaw (Parker's character on the series) describes getting caught in the Matrix, which is shown in flashbacks and in the narration style heard usually on the television series. Laurence Fishburne appeared in the spoof in a creative superimposition from the film, as well as Vince Vaughn (playing the supposed \"White Rabbit\") and Jimmy Fallon, who played Keanu Reeves's character, Neo, from the film. Also, it noted Parker's status as a fashion icon by appearing in no less than 15 different costumes during the duration of the awards ceremonies, even appearing in nothing but a bath towel.\nPerformers\n*D'Angelo — \"Devil's Pie\"\n*NSYNC — \"It's Gonna Be Me\"\n*Metallica — \"I Disappear\"\nPresenters\n*Amy Smart and Tom Green — presented Best On-Screen Duo\n*Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs — presented Best Kiss\n*George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg — presented Best Villain\n*Seth Green and Q-Tip — introduced D'Angelo\n*Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx — presented Breakthrough Female\n*Lucy Liu and Ice Cube — presented Best Fight\n*Aaliyah and Freddie Prinze Jr. — presented Best Action Sequence\n*Rebecca Romijn and Halle Berry — presented Best Musical Sequence\n*Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Klein — presented Breakthrough Male\n*Denise Richards and Marlon Wayans — introduced NSYNC\n*Samuel L.
