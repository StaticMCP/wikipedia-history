Sixteen of the men killed were USN training to fly the ship back to Cape May, NJ.  The ZR-2 (R38) crashed before the US Navy could take delivery of the airship; therefore ZR-2 did not officially receive its US designation, though it was painted with its planned Navy designation.\n1922\nConstruction of , 1923\nThe first American-built rigid airship, the , is built in Hangar No. 1 at Lakehurst, New Jersey.\n1923\nAugust 20,\nThe , is christened.\nSeptember,\nUSS Shenandoah is launched and flown from Lakehurst, New Jersey.  It was the first ship to be inflated with the noble gas helium, which was so rare that the Shenandoah contained most of the world's reserves.\n1924\nThe United States Navy purchases and takes delivery from Germany of the USS Los Angeles (ZR-3); the only German-built (as LZ 126) US Navy airship.  The Los Angeles was paid for with \"war reparations\" money, owed according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, thus saving The Zeppelin Works. The success of the Los Angeles encouraged the US Navy to invest in its own, larger, airships. The Los Angeles flew successfully for 8 years.\nIn the background, ZR-3, in front of it, (l to r) J-3 or 4, K-1, ZMC-2, in front of them, \"Caquot\" observation balloon, and in foreground free balloons used for training. US Navy airships and balloons, 1931\nNovember 25,\nUSS Los Angeles is commissioned in Lakehurst, NJ. The two airships  USS Shenandoah and USS Los Angeles had to share the limited supply of helium, and thus alternated operating and overhauls.\nThe Los Angeles flew successfully for 8 years.\n1925\nSeptember 3,\nUSS Shenandoah was lost on a poorly planned publicity flight when it flew into a severe thunderstorm over Noble County, Ohio. It broke into pieces, killing 14 of its crew.\n1926\nJune 24 (Washington, DC),\nThe Navy department authorizes construction of two large dirigibles, named USS Akron (ZRS-4) and USS Macon (ZRS-5), to be the nucleus of the modern Air Force.\nThe US Navy developed the idea of using airships as airborne aircraft carriers, although the British had experimented with an airplane \"trapeze\" on their R33 .  The USS Los Angeles was used to experiment with the project, followed by two other airships, the world's largest at the time, to test the principle—the  and . Each carried four F9C Sparrowhawk fighters in its hangar, and could carry a fifth on the trapeze. The idea had mixed results. By the time the Navy started to develop a sound doctrine for using the ZRS-type airships, the last of the two built, USS Macon, was lost. The seaplane had become more mature, and was considered a better investment.\n1929\nA metalclad-airship, ZMC-2, is built by the Aircraft Development Corp (scrapped in 1941)\n1930s\n1931\nThe Empire State Building completed in 1931, was fitted with a dirigible mast, in anticipation of passenger airship service.  Various entrepreneurs experimented with commuting and shipping freight via airship.\nUSS Akron over Lower Manhattan circa 1932\nAugust 8,\nthe USS Akron is launched.\n1932\nThe (ZR-3) Los Angeles is decommissioned.\n1933\nApril 3,\nUSS Akron was caught in a severe storm and flown into the surface of the sea off the shore of New Jersey. It carried no life boats and few life vests, so 73 of its crew of 76 died from drowning or hypothermia.\nMoffett Field in 1933]]\nApril 21,\nthe USS Macon is launched.\n1935\nFebruary 12,\nUSS Macon was lost after suffering a structural failure offshore near Point Sur Lighthouse. The failure caused a loss of gas, which was made much worse when the aircraft was driven over pressure height causing it to lose too much helium to maintain flight. Only 2 of its crew of 83 died in the crash thanks to the inclusion of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the Akron disaster.\n1940\nThe (ZR-3) Los Angeles is dismantled.\nReferences"
