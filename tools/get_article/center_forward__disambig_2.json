Established in 2010, it promotes centrist and bipartisan policymaking in the United States and engages in public education, policy research, and issue-based advertising. The group is chaired by former U.S. Representative Bud Cramer of Alabama.\nHistory\nCenter Forward was founded in 2010 as a successor to the Blue Dog Coalition’s Political Action Committee, following campaign-finance rule changes that limited how Blue Dog Coalition members could support outside advocacy. While the organization shares ideological roots with that coalition—emphasizing fiscal responsibility and bipartisan cooperation—it operates independently.\nDuring its early years Center Forward sponsored advertising campaigns promoting congressional bipartisanship and supported several moderate Democratic candidates. By 2012 it had begun purchasing national television ads encouraging “commonsense solutions” on fiscal and budget issues, and by 2014 it was active in U.S. House races such as Georgia’s 12th District contest involving former Representative John Barrow.\nToday, Center Forward conducts research, polling, and policy discussions focused on federal economic and social policies.\nActivities\nIt hosts congressional roundtables, briefings, and receptions for policymakers, academics, and industry representatives. The organization also publishes opinion pieces and analytical reports on legislative and regulatory topics.\nRecent projects have included:\n*Public-opinion research (2025) reporting that some Trump voters viewed the administration as distracted from economic issues.\n*A joint report with PwC (2024) comparing U.S. and international tax-filing systems, concluding that countries with return-free filing typically maintain simpler tax codes.\nIn April 2019, The Intercept reported that Center Forward hosted a bipartisan policy retreat for senior congressional staff at a resort in Virginia, featuring panels on healthcare legislation.\nFunding\nAccording to the organization’s 2022 IRS Form 990 filings (ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer), Center Forward reported $12.97 million in total expenses, nearly all dedicated to research, events, and nationwide advertising campaigns.\nInvestigations by Kaiser Health News and OpenSecrets (2018) identified Center Forward among advocacy groups that received substantial support from pharmaceutical-industry lobbying entities. The group does not disclose individual donors, consistent with U.S. law governing 501(c)(4) “social-welfare” organizations.\nPolicies\nInfluence Watch list Center Forward’s principal issue areas as:\n*Energy and sustainability\n*Financial services\n*Healthcare\n*Innovation and technology\n*Pragmatic governing\n*Tax policy\n*Trade and workforce development\nReferences"
