Sales of the record were very strong throughout Europe, where it debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, and several European countries, either considered as a single, or charting on album charts as an extended play or an LP. Chart success in the US was far less spectacular, but the EP still peaked at number 46 on the Billboard 200.\nA shortened version of \"Killer\" and \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\", a live medley performed by Michael at Wembley Arena, was released as a further independent single, in some territories only. The singer also shot a music video for it, but did not personally appear in full face. The video was directed by Marcus Nispel.\nWhile \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" is played by the remaining members of Queen, the vocal is a duet between George Michael and Lisa Stansfield.\nThe sixth track – only featured on some versions of the release – is represented by a short performance by Queen, entitled \"Dear Friends\", originally sung by Freddie Mercury. Recorded in 1974 and originally appearing on the band's Sheer Heart Attack album, this constitutes the one studio recording on the record. It was not included in the UK vinyl of the EP.\nUsually, countries where the six-track work is distributed consider it to be a short LP, whereas those where the five-track (hence its title) work is available generally tend to see it as an EP or even (if \"Killer\" / \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" was not marketed independently in those same territories) as a particularly long or content-rich single.\nTrack listing\n#\"Somebody to Love\" (Freddie Mercury)&nbsp;– 5:17 (US #30)\n#*Performed by Queen and George Michael\n#**Recorded at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1992\n#\"Killer\" (Adam Tinley, Seal-Henry Samuel)&nbsp;– 5:57 (US #69)\n#*Performed by George Michael\n#**Recorded at Wembley Arena in March 1991\n#\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" (Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong)&nbsp;– 5:25 (US #69)\n#*Performed by George Michael\n#**Recorded at Wembley Arena in March 1991\n#\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" (Queen)&nbsp;– 4:43\n#*Performed by Queen, George Michael and Lisa Stansfield\n#**Recorded at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1992\n#\"Calling You\" (Bob Telson)&nbsp;– 6:17\n#*Performed by George Michael\n#**Recorded at Wembley Arena in March 1991\n#\"Dear Friends\" (Brian May)&nbsp;– 1:07 (some releases only)\n#*Performed by Queen (1974 studio recording from Sheer Heart Attack)\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1993)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Danish Singles (IFPI)\n|2\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|European Albums (Top 100)\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|European Singles (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|7\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Finnish Albums (Suomen virallinen lista)\n|39\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|French Albums (SNEP)\n|12\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Greek Singles (AFP)\n|2\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon)\n|35\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Portuguese Albums (AFP)\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Spanish Albums (AFYVE)\n|18\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Spanish Singles (AFYVE)\n|1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Chart (1993)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)\n|19\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (MegaCharts)\n|19\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|European Singles (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|49\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|French Albums (SNEP)\n|30\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n|30\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|11\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\n}}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
