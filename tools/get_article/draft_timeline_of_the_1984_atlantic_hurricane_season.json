It was the most active since 1971. During the season, 13 tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean became named storms. the first named storm, Tropical Storm Arthur develops on August 28. the last named storm Hurricane Lili, dissipated on December 24. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most systems form.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) prior to 2020 were: Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest five&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers) and averaged over one&nbsp;minute, following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nJune\n;June 1\n* The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\n;June 11\n* 12:00&nbsp;UTC (1:00&nbsp;p.m. AST) Tropical Depression One formed approximately on Florida coast.\n;June 14\n* 20:00&nbsp;UTC (4:00&nbsp;p.m. AST) Tropical Depression One  It dissipated as a tropical cyclone.\n;June 18\n* 12:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Two, forms.\n;June 20\n* 06:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Two dissipated over the mountainous terrain of eastern Mexico.\nJuly\n;July 24\n;July 26\n* 18:00 UTC at Tropical Depression Three dissipates over south Venezuela.\nAugust\n;August 18\n* 06:00 UTC at Subtropical Depression One forms, north of Bermuda.\n;August 19\n*12:00 UTC at Subtropical Depression One strengthened into subtropical storm one.\n;August 21\n* 12:00 UTC  Subtropical Storm One weakens to a tropical depression.\n* 18:00 UTC  Subtropical Storm One dissipates over the open waters.\n;August 28\n* 18:00 UTC (2.p.m. AST) at Tropical Depression Arthur formed late on August 28 roughly 700 mi.\n;August 29\n* 12:00 UTC (8.a.m. AST) at Tropical Depression Arthur strengthens into Tropical Storm Arthur.\n;August 30\n* 12:00 UTC Tropical Depression Five forms about .\n;August 31\n*00:00 UTC Tropical Depression Six forms about  east of Jacksonville, Florida.\n*12:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Six strengthened into Tropical Storm Cesar.\nSeptember\n]]\n;September 2\n* 18:00 UTC  Tropical Storm Cesar transitions into an extratropical cyclone east of Newfoundland.\n;September 6\n* 00:00 UTC (8.p.m. AST) at  Tropical Storm Arthur dissipates over open waters.\n* 12:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Seven emerged over the southwest Gulf of Mexico.\n;September 8\n;September 11\n* 07:00 UTC Hurricane Diana makes landfall as a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of . near Wilmington.\n;September 12\n* 00:00 UTC  Hurricane Diana strengthens into a Category 4 hurricane.\n;September 14\n* 00:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Nine forms in the Bay of Campeche.\n;September 15\n* 12:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Ten develops.\n* 18:00 UTC  Tropical Storm Edouard dissipates shortly.\n;September 16\n;September 23\nOctober\n]]\n;October 2\n;October 8\n* 06:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Josephine strengthens into a Tropical Storm Josephine.\n;October 10\n* 06:00 UTC  Tropical Storm Josephine strengthens into a hurricane.\n;October 18\n* 18:00 UTC  Tropical Storm Josephine transitions into an extratropical cyclone.\n;October 25\n* 06:00 UTC  at   An unnumbered tropical depression develops about ?\nNovember\n;November 5\n* 18:00 UTC  Tropical Depression Klaus, forms about  south-east Aruba.\n;November 13\n* 18:00 UTC  Subtropical Storm Klaus transitions into an extratropical cyclone.\n;November 30\n*The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season officially ends.\nDecember\n;December 20\n* 12:00 UTC  Tropical Storm Lili strengthens into a hurricane.\n;December 23\n;December 24\n* 12:00 UTC  Tropical Depresstion Lili dissipates over the Dominican Republic.\nSee also\n* Lists of Atlantic hurricanes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ nhc.noaa.gov], National Hurricane Center homepage"
