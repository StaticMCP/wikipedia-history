It was an important episode of Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising which occurred 10 days after the Kruševo Republic was proclaimed back on August&nbsp;2, 1903, and eventually lead to the fall of the Republic and to the suppression of the uprising.\nThe Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation was unorganised for this battle. Many 16- and 17-year-old men were also involved in this battle even though men were drafted at the age of 18 to join the army. This battle happened above a mountain with a height of  above sea level that was densely forested and was only a few kilometres from a popular area known as Meckin Kamen.\nThe battle saw the Ottoman Army up against the Kruševo Republic and the IMRO. The IMRO had a force of 500 to 600 revolutionaries commanded by Todor Hristov, while the Ottoman Army had a total of 3,000 to 3,100 soldiers.\nThe Ottoman Army army saw a victory over the rebels.\nReferences\nSources\n* MI-AN Publishing, Skopje 1998, Macedonia Yesterday And Today"
