The warehouse was doubled in size in 1935 with the erection of a three-story brick expansion to the south of the original block. On the south elevation, the firm added a one-story brick packing room and loading dock in 1953. On the north elevation, a tiny two-story brick addition with bathrooms was constructed in 1977.\nIn 2018, it got listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nReferences"
