Tefnakht is always called the \"Great Chief of the West\" in Piye's Victory stela and in two stelas dating to the regnal years 36 and 38 of Shoshenq V. It is uncertain if he ever adopted an official royal title. However, Olivier Perdu has now argued that a certain Shepsesre Tefnakhte of Sais was not, in fact, Piye's famous nemesis. Perdu published a recently discovered donation stela which came from a private collection; the document is dated to Year 2 of Necho I of Sais and is similar in style, epigraphy and text with the donation stela of Shepsesre. However, Perdu's arguments are not accepted by most Egyptologists at present, who believe that the Year 8 Shepsesre Tefnakht Athens stela was most likely Tefnakht I. The later king Tefnakht II, if he existed, would have been a close predecessor of Necho I. Both Tefnakht II and Necho I ruled as local Saite kings during the Nubian era under Taharqa.\nBakenranef\nTefnakht I's successor, Bakenranef, definitely assumed the throne of Sais and took the royal name Wahkare. His authority was recognised in much of the Delta including Memphis where several Year 5 and Year 6 Serapeum stelas from his reign have been found. This Dynasty came to a sudden end when Shebitqo, the second king of the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty, attacked Sais, captured Bakenrenef and burned him alive.\nPharaohs of the 24th Dynasty\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name of Pharaoh\n!Image\n!Reign\n!Throne Name\n!Comments\n|-\n|Tefnakht I\n|\n|732-725 BC\n|Shepsesre\n|\n|-\n|Bakenranef\n|\n|725-720 BC\n|Wahkare\n|\n|}\nTimeline of the 24th Dynasty\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:12\nPlotArea  = top:100 bottom:100 right:100 left:100\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:-732 till:-715\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:-732\nColors     =\nid:canvas value:rgb(0.97,0.97,0.97)\nid:PA   value:green\nid:GP   value:red\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Rulers\nPlotData=\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbarset:Rulers\nfrom: -732 till: -725 color:PA text:\"Tefnakht I (732 BC &ndash; 725 BC)\"\nfrom: -725 till: -720 color:PA text:\"Bakenranef (725 BC &ndash; 720 BC)\"\nbarset:skip\nFamily tree\nReferences"
