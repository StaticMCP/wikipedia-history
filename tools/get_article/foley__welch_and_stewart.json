Working northwestward, he obtained grading subcontracts on the Northern Pacific Railway construction throughout the 1870s and early 1880s. Starting with a single scraper pulled by six mules, he greatly expanded his business. He settled in Billings, Montana, which became his headquarters. In 1898, Julius Bloedel and John Joseph Donovan partnered with him in establishing the Lake Whatcom Logging Co.\nIn 1905, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) began building westward from Fort William, Ontario. Anticipating that Prince Rupert, British Columbia, would become the terminus, Larson and Ed J. Matthews secured options on most of this land. Rather than immediately profit, Larson sold the options to the GTP at cost, looking to the longer term relationship. In due course, the partners of Foley, Welch and Stewart received the contracts to build the Edmonton–Prince Rupert leg of the GTP.\nJ.W. Stewart\nIn 1882, Stewart arrived in Canada from Sutherland, Scotland, with limited means. Working westward, he reached Vancouver in 1885, where he felled trees during the layout of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) townsite. In the 1886 Great Vancouver Fire, he stood for hours in False Creek to escape the inferno. After 1887, he moved to Montana Territory and worked for Peter Larson.\nIn 1911, Bloedel, Stewart and Welch (BS&W) was established for lumber operations on Vancouver Island.\nFoley Brothers\nIn 1830, the Foley family settled in Lanark, Upper Canada. Timothy and his three younger brothers became loggers. In the early 1870s, the brothers established a logging and sawmill operation in Benton County, Minnesota, which provided lumber for the westward extension of the Great Northern Railway (GN). Logging was in winter and railroad earthmoving in summer. In 1882, they were involved in constructing the Winnipeg–Calgary leg of the CP. In 1898, the Mann, Foley & Larson partnership built the Castlegar–Midway leg of the Columbia and Western Railway (C&W) for CP. In 1906, Foley, Locke & Larson undertook reconstruction for CP east of Winnipeg. That year, Foley, Larson & Co was awarded the  Saskatoon–Edmonton leg of the GTP westward extension.\nNot only did the partnership handle construction equipment and supplies, but also groceries. To this end, the wholesale grocery firm of Foley, Lock & Larson was established in 1903. Usually, the agreements with subcontractors compelled the latter to buy all supplies from the partnership.\nPatrick Welch\nIn 1888, Welch arrived in Helena, Montana, from New York (state). Establishing his headquarters, he oversaw the construction of the Montana Central Railway. In 1896, he relocated to Spokane, Washington, where he associated with the Foley Bros and Stewart on the GN westward extension.\nIn May 1904, the P. Welch & Co and J.W. Stewart & Co partnership was awarded the Grand Forks–Phoenix branch line of the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway (VV&E), owned by GN.}\nIn July 1905, P. Welch & Co was awarded the Midway–Myncaster extension of the VV&E.\nIn August 1905, a joint venture between P. Welch & Co and Porter Bros was awarded the Molson–Oroville extension of the VV&E. That month, P. Welch & Co was awarded  of rock work on the Alaska Central Railroad.\nDuring 1905–1907, a joint venture between P. Welch & Co and Porter Bros undertook $8 million of work on the GN Portland–Seattle line.\nIn 1907, P. Welch & Co was awarded the Keremeos–Hedley extension of the VV&E in BC.\nMain construction partnership\nEarly expansion\nWhereas Larson had married Margaret Moran, her sisters Susan and Elizabeth had married Welch and Stewart respectively. In 1907, John and Thomas Foley and Peter Larson died. The new partnership name became Foley Bros, Welch & Stewart or Foley, Welch & Stewart (FW&S), but it was not uncommon for projects to operate under the names of the individual partners.\nIn March 1908, Foley Bros was awarded the Superior Junction–Fort William, Ontario leg of the GTP.\nIn May 1908, Foley Bros was awarded the rock work on the double-tracking of the Fort William–Winnipeg leg of the CP.\nIn May 1908, FW&S commenced work on the  Edmonton–Prince Rupert leg of the GTP from both ends. Subcontractors were allocated sections of less than  each but some undertook multiple sections. The project was completed in April 1914.\nIn February 1909, after another subcontractor had failed, the GTP subcontracted FW&S to complete  eastward from a point  west of the Abitibi River crossing (Cochrane, Ontario) for the National Transcontinental Railway.\nIn 1910, J.W. Stewart & Co was awarded the Princeton–Coalmont and Abbotsford–Hope legs of the VV&E within BC. In May 1913, the eastward advance of the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) rail head reached Hope. When the VV&E track reached Cannor in September 1916, the junction with the CNoR, GN acquired running rights on the Cannor–Hope leg. Consequently, the FW&S contract was substantially reduced.\nIn the early 1910s, FW&S was the largest railway contracting firm in the west with 50,000 workers and  of railway under construction.\nIn July 1911, P. Welch & Co was awarded the  Port Arthur–Sudbury leg of the CNoR in Ontario. That month, a joint venture between P. Welch & Co and Northern Construction (NorCon) was awarded the  Hope–Kamloops leg of the CNoR in BC. Northern Construction was the contracting name of partners Mackenzie and Mann.\nPGE ramifications\nIn February 1912, the province entered an understanding with FW&S to build, own, and operate, a Vancouver–Fort George line. By this time, Timothy Foley was in his 70s, so the day-to-day management rested with Welch and Stewart, who were in their 50s. That month, the Conservative administration of Premier Richard McBride introduced legislation for the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE) to create a new  railway (later corrected to ).\nFinancially supported but not owned by government, the PGE model defied business logic. The railway was authorized to issue 4 per cent interest bonds to a total value of $35,000 per mile of the projected mileage, upon which the government guaranteed the principal and interest.\nIn September 1912, P. Welch & Co was awarded the construction contract. Stewart took extended medical leave August 1912–August 1913, an extremely busy period for FW&S, when Welch divided his supervisory time between multiple major projects.\nMcBride allowed the PGE and FW&S to be controlled by the same parties, which removed any incentive to build as quickly and economically as possible. The former sacrificed value for money, while the latter profiteered. In fact, the PGE was only partially completed before becoming insolvent, while FW&S made a 38 per cent profit on $16,475,630 billed. The FW&S profits from land sales were handled separately.\nSince both the PGE promoters and government suspected up front that the bond funding would be insufficient for the project, McBride had allegedly promised to provide additional aid to complete the project if this proved the case. Although construction began in October 1912, the first cost estimate was not prepared until late 1913, which revealed a $10 million projected funding shortfall.\nTo attract investors in 1913, the interest rate on new bond issues increased to  per cent. Although legally, the bond money should only have been dispensed in proportion to the work completed, the release of funds was far in excess. In February 1914, the government raised the bond issue limit from $35,000 to $42,000 per mile. The announcement of an extension into the Peace Country was intended to soften the news of huge cost over-runs to date.\nWelch underwent a major operation and took medical leave November 1913–November 1915, while Stewart shouldered the daily responsibilities.\nRather than reducing or suspending operations, which could have preserved almost 70 per cent of the bond money, the government continued releasing funds. When the bond money was exhausted in November 1915, the line was only 35 per cent complete, the PGE was insolvent, and as guarantor of principal and interest on the bonds, the BC Government faced a debt burden. Squamish and Clinton became the terminals of the  line.\nStewart left for overseas service in August 1916. During World War I, he was promoted to brigadier general in order to direct railway construction in France. His skills in the rapid construction of track elevated him to command all British and Canadian rail units.\nLater audits and enquiries revealed that the PGE Act, which usurped the basic checks and balances of the Railway Act, was itself laxly followed by the government, resulting in an overpayment of more than $5.7 million to FW&S.\nIn late 1917, limited grading having ceased, FW&S proposed a government takeover of the PGE. To avoid lengthy and expensive legal proceedings, FW&S agreed in February 1918 to hand over PGE assets and a cash payment of $750,000. Although released from all obligations and the dropping of government litigation, FW&S was allowed to retain ownership of the PGE Land Development Company. The degree to which financial assets had been transferred to this company since 1912 was never revealed. Although Welch had promised at the hearings to provide information on land sale profits, he instead relocated to Seattle with the corporate records.\nThe PGE insolvency had forced the BC government to assume the ownership and debt of the railway. As second premier of the following Liberal administration, John Oliver engaged NorCon to extend the line northward to Quesnel. A subsequent royal commission found many similar abuses by Norcon to those of FW&S. When Norcon took away equipment estimated at up to $1 million, the government stated it belonged to FW&S and not the PGE. Assumedly, Norcon directly compensated FW&S.\nConcurrent projects\nIn August 1912, P. Welch & Co was awarded the Coalmont–Brookmere extension of the VV&E in BC.\nIn September 1912, FW&S was awarded the Victoria–Port Alberni leg of the CNoR in BC.\nIn January 1913, a joint venture between FW&S and Edward Peterson was awarded the Weyburn–Lethbridge branch of the CP in Saskatchewan.\nIn July 1913, FW&S was awarded the CP Connaught Tunnel construction and connecting trackage by offering the lowest bid and earliest completion projection. The  tunnel opened in December 1916.\nIn November 1913, FW&S was awarded the new harbour and terminal works at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Carried out as a joint venture with Fauquier, Welch supervised the project. Following the 1917 Halifax Explosion, the project was suspended, and the military expropriated the floating cranes for priority needs.\nAfter World War I\nAfter 1917, Welch largely retired, but he associated with Stewart in the Calgary office of Stewart & Welch and with Bloedel in BS&W.\nIn 1919, Timothy Foley died and Welch was in poor health. During this period, Stewart primarily operated as sole proprietor on a series of smaller railway upgrade projects.\nIn 1921, Stewart joined A.R. Mann at NorCon, which became known as Northern Construction Co & J.W. Stewart. That year, Stewart and MacDonnell Ltd was established in the UK for the $17 million upgrade of harbour and railway infrastructure at Takoradi in the Gold Coast (later renamed Ghana). Experiencing delays before and after site work commenced in 1923, the company was replaced in September 1924 by Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, which completed the contract.\nIn Canada, the Norcon association was awarded the Ballantyne Pier superstructure in 1921, the Second Narrows Bridge in 1923, and the Dunsmuir Tunnel and Downtown Vancouver Canadian National Steamship pier in 1931.\nIn 1929, Welch died. During his funeral, construction workers on various projects throughout the world paused for an hour. That year, a former worker on the PGE project, who held Stewart at gunpoint demanding an $18,000 payment for an injury claim, was subsequently arrested for attempted robbery and carrying a concealed weapon.\nStewart died in 1938. His funeral was attended by dignitaries from across Canada and farther afield. His coffin was carried upon a gun carriage through Downtown Vancouver.\nHonours\nIn 1917, Stewart and Welch opened the Lucky Four Copper Mine. Mine superintendent Arthur Williamson named the nearby peaks as Mount Foley, Mount Welch, and Mount Stewart. Becoming established names in the mountaineering community, Foley Peak, Welch Peak, and Stewart Peak were officially adopted in 1946. In the 1910s, FW&S had undertaken railway construction both to the east and west along the Fraser River. The names of Foley Glacier, Foley Creek, and Foley Lake, derived from the mountain.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
