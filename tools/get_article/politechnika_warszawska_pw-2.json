Total number of 19 gliders were built, including variant PW-2D bis.\nDesign and development\nThe PW-2 was designed as a lightweight glider of modest performance with an open cockpit. The aircraft was intended to be produced as both a completed aircraft and as a kit for amateur construction.\nThe aircraft is made from composite material, with its control surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. Its  span wing employs an American-designed NACA 4415 airfoil. The maximum glide ratio is 16:1 at\nOperational history\nIn August 2011 five PW-2Ds were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration. All were in the Experimental - Exhibition/Racing category and all produced in 1992 or 1993.\nSpecifications (PW-2D)\nin rough air\n:::: on aero-tow\n:::: on winch launch\n|g limits=+5.3 -2.65\n|glide ratio=16:1 at\n|sink rate ms=1.1\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=at\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=17.32\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130806074733/http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/afplots/naca4415.gif NACA 4415 airfoil]\n*[http://jarek24.w.interia.pl/pw/pw2/pw2-photo-html/pw2-05.htm Photo of PW-2D]\n*[http://j2mcl-planeurs.net/dbj2mcl/planeurs-machines/photos/DWLKK_PW-2D.jpg Photo of PW-2D]"
