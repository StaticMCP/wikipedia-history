There have been a total of eleven reigns shared between seven different champions. The current title holder is Azusa Inaba who is in her first reign.\nTitle history\nAt the time of Professional Wrestling Just Tap Out establishment in 2020, a championship belt was not immediately produced, but instead, a ranking system was launched, later activating under the name of \"JTO Girls Ranking\" based on JTO rules that differed from other organizations.\nOn December 6, 2020, Aki Shizuku won the inaugural \"JTO Girls Tournament\" held at the Professional Wrestling Just Tap Out (later JTO) Wrestle Butoukan tournament and became the first champion. In 2022, a championship belt was created with the help of voters. The design of the title is still used today.\nReigns\n|location = Saitama, Japan\n|event    = JTO GIRLS Tournament\n|defenses = 3\n|notes    = Defeated Tomoka Inaba in a tournament final to become the inaugural champion.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Just Tap Out 2nd Anniversary Iwai\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Itadaki\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Yokohama, Japan\n|event    = JTO\n|defenses = 4\n|notes    = This was a JTO Girls 2022 Tournament semi-final match.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    = This was the JTO Girls 2023 Tournament final match.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO J1 League & GIRLS League Finals\n|defenses = 0\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Girls Special\n|defenses = 1\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Girls Special\n|defenses = 3\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Hatsu\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Girls Special In Osaka\n|defenses = 0\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}+\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO 6th Anniversary\n|defenses = 1\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\nCombined reigns\nAs of  , .\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|†\n|Indicates the current champion\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!Rank\n!Wrestler\n!No. ofreigns\n!Combineddefenses\n!Combined days\n|-\n!1\n| Tomoka Inaba || 4 || 7 || 884\n|-\n!2\n| Aki Shizuku || 1 || 3 || 213\n|-\n!3\n| Yuu Yamagata || 1 || 2 || 199\n|-\n!4\n| Aoi || 2 || 3 || 177\n|-\n!5\n| Yuu || 1 || 2 || 140\n|-\n!6\n|style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| Azusa Inaba † || 1 || 1 || +\n|-\n!7\n| Sumika Yanagawa || 1 || 2 || 65\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cagematch.net/?id=5&nr=5074 Queen Of JTO Championship at Cagematch.net]"
