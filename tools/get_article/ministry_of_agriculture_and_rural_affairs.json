The ministry is headquartered in Beijing. It was formed on March 19, 2018, as the agency superseding the former Ministry of Agriculture.\nHistory\nOn March 19, 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs was created at the first session of the 13th National People's Congress as part of the deepening the reform of the Party and state institutions, superseding the Ministry of Agriculture. That same day, Han Changfu was elected Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. It was also announced that some of its additional responsibilities come from the agricultural investment projects of the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Land and Resources, and the Ministry of Water Resources.\nThe Ministry stated in late 2020 that it would designate 6.6 million hectares of prime agricultural land as grain zones to be farmed with high production methods and which could not be converted to other crops. It also raised subsidies for rice, corn, and soybean growing.\nIn March 2023, it gained responsibilities related to rural science and technology from the Ministry of Science and Technology as part of the plan on reforming Party and state institutions. It also absorbed the National Rural Revitalization Administration.\nFunctions\nThe Ministry is responsible for handling the \"three rural issues\"; namely agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. It is responsible for managing fisheries, animal husbandry, farmland resources, irrigation projects, land reclamation and agricultural mechanization, checking agricultural product quality and safety, and managing agricultural investments. It also houses the Office of the Central Rural Work Leading Group.\nSee also\n* History of agriculture in China\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
