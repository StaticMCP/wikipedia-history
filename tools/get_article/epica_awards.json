This jury aims to achieve objectivity and widespread coverage of the results. The best work is also published in the annual Epica Book and shown in the Epica on Tour showcase.\nAwards\nThe awards encompass all main communication disciplines: TV, Press, Outdoor, Digital, Mobile, Social, Radio, Promotions, Direct & Experiential Marketing, Media, Business-to-business, Public relations, Branded Entertainment, Design, Packaging, Integrated Campaigns, Film Craft, Photography and Print Craft. Complete results of the annual awards are announced in the press and confirmed on the Epica website during the last week of November every year.

Only work that has been approved by clients and used, published or broadcast since 1 July of the previous year is eligible to enter.\nJury and judging criteria\nThe [https://www.epica-awards.com/jury Epica jury] consists of senior writers and reporters from newspapers and online news portals around the world. Each jury member is selected based on certain criteria. The jury includes representatives from 290 renowned publications such as Forbes, Entrepreneur, National Geographic, The Australian, Vogue, GCC Business News, Ad Week, People, Arab News, Indian Express and Business Insider. The Epica Awards are the only industry awards to be judged solely by journalists.\nEpica entries are judged on the basis of two criteria only: the originality of the creative idea and the quality of its execution (except in the Craft & Imagery categories where only quality of execution is taken into consideration).\nThe Epica results are determined by category. The highest scoring entry in each category wins gold, on condition that the work surpasses a minimum score that qualifies it as a category winner. Other entries in each category that achieve this score win silver or bronze. When no entry meets the standard there are no winners in the category. Four Grand Prix are awarded to the best overall film, press, outdoor and digital entries. These are selected from all the category winners. The agency and network with the most awards are given the Agency of the Year and Network of the Year trophies.\nEpica Book and Epica on Tour\nAll the winners and a selection of other high-scoring entries are published in the annual Epica Book, which they receive a free copy of. The book showcases more than 800 TV commercials, posters, press ads, radio spots, PR projects, promotions, internet sites, graphic design projects, integrated campaigns, direct marketing, branded content and innovative media entries honoured in the previous year's awards.\nFilm winners are also compiled and shown in the Epica on Tour showcase. In 2016, the showcase toured Sydney, London, Paris, Stockholm, Moscow, Copenhagen, Minsk, Milan, Kyiv and New York City.\nCeremony and conference\nThe Epica ceremony is held in a different capital city each year, on the Thursday of the third week in November.
