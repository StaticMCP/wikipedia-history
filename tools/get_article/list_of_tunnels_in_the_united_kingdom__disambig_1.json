Some government bodies define a tunnel as  in length or longer.\nA tunnel may be for pedestrians or cyclists, for general road traffic, for motor vehicles only, for rail traffic, or for a canal. Some are aqueducts, constructed purely for carrying water—for consumption, for hydroelectric purposes or as sewers—while others carry other services such as telecommunications cables. There are even tunnels designed as wildlife crossings for European badgers and other endangered species.\nThe longest tunnel in the United Kingdom is the Northern line at . This will be superseded in the 2030s by the  Woodsmith Mine Tunnel in North Yorkshire that will transport polyhalite from North Yorkshire to a port on Teesside. Standedge Tunnel at  is the longest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom. When completed in the late 2020s, the Chiltern tunnel will be the 2nd longest mainline railway tunnel in the UK at .\nEngland\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=2|Location !!rowspan=2|Tunnel !! rowspan=2 width=80|Type !! colspan=2|Length!! rowspan=2|Construction method / Notes !! rowspan=2|Date of opening || rowspan=2|Coordinates\n|-\n!(m) !!
