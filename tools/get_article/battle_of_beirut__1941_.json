At one minute past midnight on 12 July, a ceasefire came into effect. For all intents and purposes, this ended the campaign and an armistice was signed on 14 July at the \"Sidney Smith Barracks\" on the outskirts of the city of Acre. The armistice placed Syria under the French general Charles de Gaulle.\nThe triumphant entry of the Australian 7th Division into Beirut successfully established the Allied occupation of Lebanon. Beirut later became an important Allied base for Mediterranean naval operations.\nReferences"
