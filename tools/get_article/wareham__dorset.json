The town is situated on the River Frome  southwest of Poole.\nSituation and geography\nThe town is built on a strategic dry point between the River Frome and the River Piddle at the head of the Wareham Channel of Poole Harbour. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide flood plains and marsh land. At its estuary the river has formed the wide shallow ria of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\nThe town is situated on the A351 road Lytchett Minster-Swanage road. Wareham is also the eastern terminus of the A352 road to Dorchester, both roads now bypassing the town centre. Wareham railway station is on the South West Main Line railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the Swanage Railway. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service into Wareham from its current terminus at Norden, near Corfe Castle.\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, Wareham Forest stretches several miles to the A35 road and the southern foothills of the Dorset Downs. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including Wytch Farm oil field and Studland & Godlingstone Heath nature reserve. About  to the south is a chalk ridge, the Purbeck Hills which faces the Isle of Wight to the east, and  to the south is the English Channel.\nHistory\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early Mesolithic activity dating to around 9000 BCE. At the same site four large Neolithic pits containing worked flint and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the Bronze Age. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small Roman settlement, though the current town was founded by the Saxons. The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as Werham in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry of 784, from Old English wer (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and hām ('homestead') or hamm ('enclosure hemmed in by water').\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth ramparts surrounding the town, likely built by Alfred the Great in the 9th century to defend the town from the Danes as part of his system of burh towns. The Danes invaded and occupied Wareham in 876, and only left after Alfred returned with an army and made a payment of Danegeld. In 998 they attacked again, and in 1015 an invasion led by King Canute left the town in ruins. The town was a Saxon royal burial place, notably that of King Beorhtric (d. 802). Also in the town at the ancient minster church of Lady St. Mary  is the coffin said to be that of Edward the Martyr, dating from 978. His remains had been hastily buried there and were later taken from Wareham to Shaftesbury Abbey in north Dorset (and now lie in Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey).\nBy the end of the Saxon period, Wareham had become one of the most important towns in the county, to the extent that it housed two mints for the issue of Royal money. The Burghal Hidage lists the town as 1,600 hides, the third largest in the realm. During the Norman conquest of England, in late 1067, William I harried the town as his army passed into the west to lay siege to Exeter. The Normans later built a castle on the banks of the River Frome, at a site acquired from the Abbot of Shaftesbury and now known as Castle Close, which became the focus of much fighting between the forces of Stephen and Matilda during the period of civil war in the mid 12th century. The keep was destroyed at an unknown date in the 12th or 13th century, possibly under the terms of the Treaty of Wallingford, and no visible trace remains. Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.\nDuring the English Civil War, Wareham changed hands several times between the Royalists and Parliamentarians and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 Cromwellian soldiers besieging the town.\nAfter the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where Judge Jeffreys held the Bloody Assizes, with five rebels being hanged, drawn and quartered on the West Walls, an area known as 'Bloody Bank'. This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next Ascension Day King John's rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse's tail and hanged together with his son.\nIn 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in Georgian architecture with red brick and Purbeck limestone, following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The medieval almshouses escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian façades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\nWith the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Wareham became a garrison town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The garrison was re-located to nearby Bovington Camp in 1922. The town survived the Second World War largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a German aeroplane fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as Poole, grew rapidly.\nReligious sites\n]]\nWareham's oldest places of worship include the Saxon church of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are pre-conquest. The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841–2)\nSt. Martins-on-the-Walls is also Saxon (built , dedicated to Martin of Tours). Both are Anglican.\nThe 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew's and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham United Reformed Church in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr Roman Catholic church on Shatters Hill, Wareham Methodist Church in North St. and the Evangelical Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the First World War and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the Second World War.\nGovernment\nThe civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area. The parish has an area of .\nWareham is in the Dorset unitary district within the ceremonial county of Dorset. For elections to Dorset Council, it is in Wareham ward. Historically, Wareham was an ancient borough and then a municipal borough from 1886 to 1974, when it became part of Purbeck District until Dorset became a unitary district in 2019.\nWareham is within the Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency of the House of Commons. From the Middle Ages to 1885 Wareham was the seat of a parliamentary borough of the same name.\nCulture and Media\n]]\nWareham is twinned with Conches-en-Ouche in Normandy, France and with Hemsbach in Germany.\nSince the 16th century Wareham has been a market town, and still holds a market on Thursdays and Saturdays. In 2005 Wareham was named as a Fairtrade Town.\nEvents held in the town include the annual carnival which takes place in July with a parade, fireworks and music by the quay. A new event is the music festival held in summer, with bands playing on the Quay, at Wareham Town Hall and in the town's pubs. The Wareham Court Leet, one of the few remaining Court Leets in Britain, meets nightly during the last week in November.\nIn the church of St Martin-on-the-Walls, there is a recumbent effigy of T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) in Arab clothing, sculpted by Eric Kennington. Lawrence is buried in the churchyard at Moreton where every year a quantity (decreases by one each year) of red roses are left. Near the town is Clouds Hill and Bovington army camp where Lawrence died after a motorbike accident. Wareham Town Museum, in East Street, has an interesting section on Lawrence and in 2006 produced an hour-long DVD entitled T. E. Lawrence — His Final Years in Dorset, including a reconstruction of the fatal accident. The museum also contains many artefacts on all aspects of the history of the town.\nThe Royal Air Force Air Cadets has an Air Training Corps squadron based in the town, namely 2185 (Wareham) Squadron ATC. The squadron's cadets regularly partake in activities around the town for charitable purposes such as supporting the carnival, training exercises and parades. The squadron has a Detached Flight based at Swanage.\nLocal news and television programmes is provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge transmitting station.\nThe local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent, Heart South, Greatest Hits Radio South, Nation Radio South Coast and Greatest Hits Radio South.\nThe Wareham Advertiser is the town's local weekly newspaper.\nCultural references\nThomas Hardy in his novels based the town of \"Anglebury\" on Wareham. Dinah Craik used the town as one of the settings in her novel ''Agatha's Husband (as \"Kingcombe\"). Anglebury House - a tea house/restaurant still operating on the high street - was frequented by T E Lawrence. The seat where Lawrence regularly sat is marked by a plaque.\nWareham is the setting for one of the \"Amazing Adventures of Scary Bones the Skeleton\" series of books for children by Ron Dawson, Scary Bones meets the Wacky Witches of Wareham.
