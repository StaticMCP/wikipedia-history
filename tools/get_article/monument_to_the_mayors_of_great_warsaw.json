It consists of statues of Stefan Starzyński and Julian Kulski, mayors of Warsaw who served, respectively, from 1934 to 1939, and from 1939 to 1944. The monument was designed by Paweł Pietrusiński, and unveiled on 9 October 2021.\nHistory\nThe monument commemorates Stefan Starzyński and Julian Kulski. The prior was mayor of Warsaw from 1934 to 1939, and among other things, commanded the civil defence effort during the Siege of Warsaw. The latter was recognised by the Polish government-in-exile as the city mayor from 1939 to 1944, and served the office in the structures of the Polish Underground State. The statues were proposed by Julian Eugeniusz Kulski, military officer, architect, veteran of Warsaw Uprising, and son of Julian Kulski. He in turn was inspired by historian Kazimierz Sztarbałło. The monument was designed by Paweł Pietrusiński, and financed by the Kulski Foundation. It was unveiled on 9 October 2021.\nCharacteristics\nThe monument is located in the Old Town neighbourhood of the Downtown district.
