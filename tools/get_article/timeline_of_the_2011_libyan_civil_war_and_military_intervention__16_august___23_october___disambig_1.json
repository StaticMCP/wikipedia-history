By mid-August, anti-Gaddafi forces effectively supported by a NATO-led international coalition were ascendant in Tripolitania, breaking out of the restive Nafusa Mountains in the south to mount an offensive toward the coast and advancing from Misrata on loyalist-held cities and villages from the north and east.\nThis period of the war was its endgame, with Muammar Gaddafi's defensive perimeter around Greater Tripoli collapsing and his government ultimately being routed from Tripoli. A number of members of the Gaddafi government were arrested or killed in action, including Gaddafi's youngest son Khamis, and a string of its last outposts teetered and eventually fell under the assault of the (effectively) NATO-backed revolutionaries. By the end of September, the National Transitional Council had won recognition from the United Nations, the Arab League, and the African Union as the legitimate governing authority of Libya, asserting control over the vast majority of the country.\nAs the war entered its momentous final days, the last remaining stronghold of government loyalists was the city of Sirte, which Gaddafi declared to be the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's new capital after the fall of Tripoli. On 20 October, NTC forces that had been arrayed around the ever-shrinking positions occupied by loyalist holdouts made a decisive push and took control of the city, capturing Gaddafi as he attempted to flee. Gaddafi, who had been seriously wounded prior to his arrest, died in custody less than an hour later.\n, with line of control at around 19 October.

Spokespersons for both the Gaddafi government and the NTC denied face-to-face meetings between the two opposing governments.\n* As NTC forces encircled Tripoli, effectively cutting it off, an anonymous Russian diplomat stated that Russia was \"deeply disturbed\" by the NATO campaign, referring to \"the destruction of infrastructure and especially power supplies on territory controlled by the government. In a joint statement, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez went further, denouncing \"imperialist aggression\" (in both Syria and Libya).\n* Gaddafi government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim declared that pro-Gaddafi loyalists had retaken Misrata, a claim reported by the Xinhua News Agency, and the Morning Star. The statement was contradicted by continued reports of continued rebel possession of the city, further pacified due to the capture of Tawergha.\n* According to the Associated Press, Gaddafi loyalists still held some thirty percent of Zawiya, using a local hospital as a base and forcing doctors to perform around-the-clock surgeries while snipers were perched on the roof and an anti-aircraft gunner was placed at the entrance; civilian patients and occupants were forced out of most quarters by loyalists in order to make way for wounded soldiers and mercenaries.\n17 August\n* According to Xinhua News Agency, Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed that Zawiya and Brega was under full control of the Gaddafi loyalists, denying rebel, NATO and mainstream media reports to the contrary.\n* Libyan rebels were in control of seventy percent of Zawiya and had also reached the outskirts of Al-Heisha, they claimed.

The newspaper claimed Gaddafi's chief of staff, Bashir Saleh, had been dispatched to Djerba, Tunisia, and then to Bamako, Mali, to meet with British and French officials about the possibility of Gaddafi being allowed to leave Libya without facing arrest or trial. The report quoted unidentified sources within the NTC as saying, \"We do not want the battle to liberate the capital Tripoli to become a massacre, therefore if the price is for [Gaddafi] to leave power safely, then we are prepared to pay this.\" On Twitter, veteran Guardian correspondent Brian Whitaker expressed scepticism toward the report, calling it \"poorly sourced\" and suggesting it may be \"disinformation\".\n* Sabratha was reportedly captured by rebels, according to Xinhua News Agency, with the rebel brigade accepting the surrender of fifteen Gaddafi loyalists. This occurred after NATO bombed the Sabratha army barracks occupied by loyalists.

She said that heavy clashes were taking place in Mansoura as well as about  from Bab al-Azizia.\n* Later on, an Al Jazeera correspondent said that rebels entered the first gate of Bab al-Azizia, although it is unclear how close the correspondent was to Bab al-Azizia to verify it.

A spokesman for the NTC forces, Abdulrahman Busin, said in an interview that \"We have hard evidence of deals going on between China and Gaddafi, and we have all the documents to prove it\" and added both that rebels had other documents as well (saying \"I can think of at least 10 off the top of my head\"), and that it would harm relations between NTC-controlled Libya and China.\n5 September\n* Two of Gaddafi's sons, Saif al-Islam and Mutassim Gaddafi, are reported to have left Bani Walid for unknown destinations farther south.
