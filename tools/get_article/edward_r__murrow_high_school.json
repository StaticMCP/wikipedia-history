Murrow High School is a public high school in Midwood, Brooklyn, New York City, operated by the New York City Department of Education. The school is dedicated to the arts, and students can audition for programs in music, fine and visual arts, or theater. The school was established in 1974 by Saul Bruckner, who also served as its first principal, and was named after the renowned broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow. The school was founded based on the pedagogical theories of John Dewey and the learning and teaching methods of John Dewey High School.\nAfter Bruckner's retirement in 2004, Anthony Lodico became Murrow's second principal. In March 2012, Lodico announced his resignation, and Allen Barge took over as principal the following month.\nAcademics\nMurrow's academic year is divided into two semesters. Students receive new class schedules and teachers at the end of January. The daily schedule shifts depending on the day of the week, with class lengths varying from 45 minutes to an hour, and each class meets only four times a week. Rather than having a lunch period or study halls, Murrow students have free periods called \"OPTAs\" (Optional Time Activities), used for studying, eating, or relaxing.\nIn response to concerns over overcrowding and student behavior during free periods, the school administration made the decision to eliminate Optional Time Activities (OPTAs) and have a uniform schedule during the 2022-2023 academic year. To mitigate this change, students are now required to have a pass in order to visit the library, and are restricted to eating lunch only in their designated cafeteria. The 285 suite, which was previously available to students with an OPTA, has been repurposed as an additional cafeteria to accommodate the students.\nDuring the 2022-2023 school year, the school implemented significant changes to its schedule. In contrast to the previous model, where students met with each class four times a week, the updated schedule now requires students to attend each class five times per week. Additionally, the schedule has shifted to a more standardized system, with each period is now at a set, specific time rather than varying times throughout the week. On Friday, the schedule is shorter.\nMurrow has a number of features including:\n* NYC High School adjusted its grade policies in 2013 so that a \"U\" is used instead of an  \"N\". The letter grading system, with each letter corresponding to a numerical measurement, e.g. E = 90-100, G = 80–89, S = 79–65, U = 65 - 55, NS = below 55 (No Show = student who never reported to class), and MI for Mastery in Independent Study.\n* In calculating the average, E is treated as a 95, G = 85, S = 75, and U = 55. This means that for getting the highest grade in all classes, a student will not achieve an average higher than 95. In college admissions applications, an explanatory letter is forwarded to colleges to explain this fact.\n**In the spring semester of the 2022-2023 academic year, the school implemented a major change to its grading policy. Under the direction of the School Leadership Team, the traditional letter grading system was replaced by a numerical grading system. The new system assigns grades in increments of one, ranging from 65 to 100, with a grade of 55 representing a failing mark.\n* Instead of using numbers to represent class periods, Murrow uses letters from A-J, excluding I.  The periods are called \"bands\" (e.g., A-Band, D-Band). Some students take classes that meet before A-Band and after J-Band. These bands are \"0 (zero)-Band\" and \"K-Band\" and usually things like crew, cast, or costuming.\n* There are no daily \"home room\" meetings. Entering students are assigned to a \"Student Communication Section\", or SCS, and remain in that SCS until graduation. The SCS meets only on an \"as needed\" basis and is used solely for dissemination of school-wide administrative/logistical information (e.g., distribution of report cards or new class schedules; election of class officers); 2 morning bands are cut short to allow time for SCS to convene. For mandated citywide testing, students usually attend a half-day of classes, followed by the test in the SCS.\n**Following the return to full in-person schooling after the COVID-19 pandemic, the school decided to eliminate SCS meetings. Instead, important documents and information are now distributed during B-Band.\n* While many state-mandated courses (e.g., science- and math-based courses) are geared toward students of a particular class year, other elective courses (e.g., performing arts, physical education electives) are not; students taking these electives will usually find themselves in classes with students from other class years.\nEdward R. Murrow High School is also known for its outstanding theater program. Their success in the arts was recognized by Mel Brooks, who granted the school to be the first-ever to gain rights to the smash hit musical \"The Producers\" in Spring 2008.\nIn attempt to diversify schools, some high schools in NYC, including Murrow, use the DOE's \"Educational Option\" model. Instead of tracking, schools admit learners of all capabilities by purposefully accepting a set percentage of students with high, middle and low test scores.\nStudent demographics\nThe 2023-2024 academic year saw a student enrollment of approximately 3,595 students at the school. The ethnic makeup of the student body was diverse, with 30% identifying as White, 26% as Asian, 20% as Hispanic or Latinx, 18% as African American, and less than 1% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Out of the reported 3,595 students, 9% were identified as English language learners. Additionally, 18% of students had Individualized Education Programs (IEPs).The student-teacher ratio was reported as 15:1.\nAudition programs\nTheater\nThe Edward R.

During the 2015-2016 school year, the school launched the Music x Technology program with the help of Alicia Keys and Levi's Jeans. The program provides students with access to a recording studio and production equipment, allowing them to study sound engineering, audio-visual production, post-production, mastering, songwriting, and more.
