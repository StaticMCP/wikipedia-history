A battle ensued in which the Byzantines were routed with the loss of 20,000 men. The fight was so ferocious that the effusion of blood flowing into the Akhurian River is said to have coloured its waters completely red.\nThis victory allowed Vahram Pahlavuni along with Catholicos Petros Getadarts to crown Gagik II king of Armenia in the cathedral of Ani.\nSee also\n* Vahram Pahlavouni\n* Byzantine Empire\n* Byzantine Armenia\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n\n---\n\n## Battle of ani\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Ani"
