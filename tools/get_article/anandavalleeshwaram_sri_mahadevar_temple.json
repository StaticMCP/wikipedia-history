According to folklore, sage Parashurama has installed the idol of Lord Shiva. The temple is a part of the 108 famous Shiva temples in Kerala. It is located at Anandavalleeswaram, a major neighborhood of Kollam city, that comes to the west side of Kollam Collectorate.\nImportance\nThe main Sanctum Sanctorum  of Anandavalleeswaram Sri Mahadevar temple is 1200 years old and it constructed in Teak wood. This is the only Hindu temple in India which has the deities of Sree Krishnan, Maha Vishnu, Bhoomi Devi and Lakshmi Devi consecrated as idols under a single structure (Sanctum sanctorum).

Initially the temple had only Shiva as the deity and Devi Parvati was consecrated later in the form of Anandavally.
