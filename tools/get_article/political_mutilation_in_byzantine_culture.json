By blinding a rival, one would not only restrict his mobility but also make it almost impossible for him to lead an army into battle, then an important part of taking control of the empire. Castration was also used to eliminate potential opponents. In the Byzantine Empire, for a man to be castrated meant that he was no longer a man—half-dead, \"life that was half death\". Castration also eliminated any chance of heirs being born to threaten either the emperor's or the emperor's children's place at the throne. Other mutilations were the severing of the nose (rhinotomy), or the amputating of limbs.\nRationale\nThe mutilation of political rivals by the emperor was deemed an effective way of side-lining from the line of succession a person who was seen as a threat. Castrated men were not seen as a threat, as no matter how much power they gained they could never take the throne, and numerous eunuchs were entrusted with high and confidential offices in the Byzantine court and administration. In Byzantine culture, the emperor was a reflection of heavenly authority. Since God was perfect, the emperor also had to be unblemished; any mutilation, especially facial wounds, would disqualify an individual from taking the throne. An exception was Justinian II (ὁ Ῥινότμητος, \"the slit-nosed\"), who had his nose cut off when he was overthrown in 695 but was able to become emperor again in 705.\nHistory\nBlinding as a punishment for political rivals and a recognized penalty for treachery was established in 705, although Phocas () used it earlier during his rule as well, becoming common practice from Heraclius () onwards. Castration as a punishment for political rivals did not come into use until much later, becoming popular in the 10th and 11th centuries. An example is that of Basil Lekapenos, the illegitimate son of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos, who was castrated when young. He gained enough power to become parakoimomenos and effective prime minister for three successive emperors, but could not assume the throne himself.\nCases of disfigurement\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n!Victim!!Date!!width=15%|Disfigurement!!class=unsortable| Details!!class=unsortable|Reference\n|-\n|\n|1295\n|Blinded\n|Governor of the Thracesian Theme, he rose up against Andronikos II Palaiologos, but was captured by loyalist soldiers and blinded\n|\n|-\n|\n|743\n|Blinded\n|For supporting Artabasdos's usurpation against Constantine V he was blinded\n|\n|-\n|\n|743\n|Blinded\n|Artabasdos and his sons Nikephoros and Niketas were blinded for his failed insurrection against Constantine V during the iconoclasm crisis\n|\n|-\n|Sisinnios\n|743\n|Blinded\n|Strategos of the Thracesians, he supported Constantine V against Artabasdos but was blinded after the former's victory due to suspicions of conspiring to seize the throne himself\n|\n|-\n|Antiochos, David, Theophylact of Iconium, Christopher, Constantine, Theophylact the kandidatos, and 11 others\n|766\n|Blinded\n|High-ranking provincial governors and court officials, members of a group of nineteen who conspired against Constantine V.
