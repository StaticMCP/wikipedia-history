It is the twentieth installment of the Call of Duty series and is the third entry in the rebooted Modern Warfare sub-series, following Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022). The game was released on November 10, 2023, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\nModern Warfare III retains the realistic, modern setting of its predecessors and continues the sub-series storyline. The story follows multi-national special operations unit Task Force 141 tracking down Vladimir Makarov, a Russian ultranationalist and terrorist planning to trigger a third World War. The game's multiplayer includes sixteen remastered maps from 2009's Modern Warfare 2, with at least twelve new maps planned for inclusion post-launch. A Zombies mode, co-created by Black Ops sub-series developer Treyarch and built around an open world player versus environment experience, is also included.\nAfter wrapping development on Call of Duty: Vanguard (2021), Sledgehammer Games were reportedly assigned by Activision to develop an expansion pack for Modern Warfare II, which changed to a full, standalone release in the Call of Duty series. After a series of leaks in early-to-mid 2023, the game was officially revealed in August 2023, with a showcase event and public beta also taking place in October. Upon release, Modern Warfare III received mixed reviews, with criticism for its campaign. It became the second best-selling title of 2023 in the United States, behind Hogwarts Legacy.\nGameplay\nModern Warfare III features similar gameplay to its predecessor and other games in the Call of Duty series. Its single player campaign features a mixture of linear missions, and open-world missions known as \"Open Combat Missions\". In these missions, players have greater freedom to choose how they want to approach designated objectives, choosing between open combat to stealth and ambush tactics. Players have access to an on-screen map of the area, including a tactical map that outlines objectives and usual equipment, with caches of weapons, gear and specialized equipment on hand. Enemies react accordingly during such missions, searching for players if they lose sight of them, and calling in reinforcements as their numbers decrease in combat.\nIn Multiplayer, all sixteen maps from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) are available to play on, with the added ability to vote for maps while in a matchmade lobby (which was absent in some recent titles), and increased player health for longer \"time-to-kill\" (TTK). The \"red dot\" minimap that was absent from Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) also returns, allowing players to see enemies on their radar when they fire a weapon without a suppressor. In addition, players are also able to cancel sliding animations (i.e. \"slide cancel\"). Classic game modes such as \"Kill Confirmed\" and \"Hardpoint\" return alongside a new game mode titled \"Cutthroat\", where three teams of three players go head to head. Players can also engage in the 32v32 \"Ground War\" mode with a selection of dedicated maps, as well as the \"War\" mode, returning from Call of Duty: WWII (2017). The game features moderation powered by artificial intelligence, listening in on in-game interactions and immediately reporting any overly-toxic behavior. At least twelve new 6v6 multiplayer maps have been confirmed to release post-launch, while fan-favorite Modern Warfare II maps will also be added every season.\nAn open world player versus environment (PvE) Zombies mode, developed by Treyarch in collaboration with Sledgehammer Games, is also included in the game. The game mode is structured similarly to the DMZ mode in Call of Duty: Warzone, rather than the round-based survival experience from older Zombies modes. Up to 24 players play together as separate squads in a large-sized map, which is also used as the new battle royale map for Warzone. Each team can tackle zombies, as well as AI-controlled human enemies, to complete objectives around the map, as well as collect loot and sell them at buy stations, or extract them via exfiltration. In place of rounds, the map is divided into \"zones\", with varying levels of threat indicating the difficulty. After 45 minutes of in-match time, an \"Aether Storm\" begins to expand and cover the map, leaving players with 15 minutes to exfil with their loot. Core mechanics from previous Zombies modes return, such as weapon wallbuys, Perk-a-Cola drinks, and the Mystery Box. Players can also extract \"acquisitions\", which are items that can be stored or brought into subsequent matches for use, or \"schematics\", which allow them to craft said items, with a cooldown limit. Story quests are also featured in the mode, which further progress the narrative.\nPlot\nCampaign\nIn November 2023, operatives working for the Russian private military company Konni Group raid the Zordaya Prison Complex in Verdansk, Kastovia. There, they locate and free their commander, Vladimir Makarov (Julian Kostov), an ultranationalist terrorist who was sentenced to life imprisonment at the complex following his capture by SAS operatives John \"Soap\" MacTavish (Neil Ellice) and John Price (Barry Sloane) during a terrorist attack at the Verdansk Stadium in April 2019. Hours later, Konni assaults a port in Urzikstan, where the Urzikstan Liberation Force (ULF), led by Farah Karim (Claudia Doumit) and ex-CIA officer Alex Keller (Chad Michael Collins), was planning to obtain ballistic missiles from the American PMC Shadow Company and their commander, Phillip Graves (Warren Kole), who faked his death after his encounter with special forces unit Task Force 141 in Las Almas, Mexico. The missiles are stolen, though Farah manages to place trackers on them.\nHaving learned of Makarov's escape from CIA Station Chief Kate Laswell (Rya Kihlstedt), Price leads 141 to an abandoned nuclear power plant to prevent Konni from securing nuclear material left behind following the death of General Roman Barkov. They find, however, that the plant is actually carrying leftover chemical materials that Barkov had hidden within and that Makarov plans to refine it into a deadly chemical weapon. Konni escapes with the material, detonating some to thwart 141's efforts and nearly killing Price in the resultant chemical gas it creates.\nTo determine Makarov's plans, Laswell infiltrates the Arklov Military Base in Verdansk and meets with Colonel Yuri Volkov (Raphael Corkhill), who supplies a flash drive containing information on the chemical weapons Barkov had been producing. Laswell leaves with the information, moments into an attack on the base with the stolen missiles. Meanwhile, Makarov has a Kastovian airliner destroyed, using a vest bomb forced onto a former ULF fighter who was traveling aboard. To prevent an escalation of tensions between the East and West, Farah and Alex swiftly remove any evidence of ULF involvement at the plane's crash site in Urzikstan before local authorities arrive, despite Konni's efforts to prevent this.\nIn wake of the attacks, Price reluctantly accepts assistance from Graves and General Herschel Shepherd (Glenn Morshower), who is seeking to return to the United States after being forced into hiding, when they both make contact with Laswell; through their intel, Soap and Lieutenant Simon \"Ghost\" Riley (Samuel Roukin) locate and interrogate Makarov's financier, Milena Romanova (Tina Ivlev). Price and Sergeant Kyle \"Gaz\" Garrick (Elliot Knight) use Romanova's information and deploy in Saint Petersburg, where they apprehend Konni operative Andrei Nolan (Nikolai Nikolaeff), leading them to intercept a convoy moving across Siberia to a former Soviet prison. Price is shocked to find that the convoy's cargo is Shepherd, who had been captured by Makarov, and decides to give him an ultimatum – either give 141 all of his intel on Makarov's plans and agree to testify to his actions before the United States Congress, or be left to freeze to death in Siberia. Shepherd agrees, revealing that Makarov plans to destroy the Gora Dam in Verdansk to flood the city and kill its populace.\nWhile Soap and Ghost lead a task force to prevent Konni from destroying the Gora Dam, Farah, Alex, Price and Kyle lead an assault on a Konni base in Urzikstan, reluctantly accepting aid from Graves and Shadow Company. After resolving both issues, Shepherd and Graves return to the United States and testify to Congress about their actions, while effectively turning on each other during questioning. Meanwhile, 141 returns to London to continue their pursuit of Makarov. Shadowing a Konni contact, the group discovers Makarov has received a flash drive that can allow him control of the UK's train network, and that he intends to destroy the Channel Tunnel. Backed up by a counter-terrorism unit, Price leads the assault to free hostages and stop Makarov. He and Soap locate a dirty bomb in the tunnel and attempt to defuse it, but are ambushed by Makarov, who tries to execute Price, but is stopped by Soap who he shoots in the head before escaping once Ghost and Kyle arrive with reinforcements, helping Price defuse the bomb. Afterwards, the trio scatter Soap's ashes off a cliff in Scotland. In a mid-credits scene, Price kills Shepherd in his office.\nZombies\nIn 2021, during a raid on a hotel in Zaravan, Urzikstan, arms dealer Victor Zakhaev (Dave B. Mitchell) and ex-NZDF operative Jack Fletcher (Luke Cook) recover two vials containing \"Aetherium\", a substance of extradimensional origin. As Zakhaev and Fletcher prepare to exfil, they are intercepted by police reinforcements, who kill most of their men. Zakhaev throws one of the vials at the officers before fleeing from the area with Fletcher in an armored vehicle; the resulting blast stuns the police and transforms the dead into zombies. Weeks later, as part of Operation Deadbolt–a CIA contingency plan formed to contain the undead threat–Soap and a strike team of elite operators are sent by Laswell and SSO Selma Greene (Debra Wilson) to ensure that nothing can escape from the Zaravan exclusion zone; accompanying them is Sergei Ravenov (Andrew Morgado), a former Spetsnaz captain who allied with the classified CIA task force \"Requiem\" to thwart previous zombie incursions during the Cold War.\nShortly after establishing their foothold, Deadbolt finds a message from one of Zakhaev's scientists, Dr. Ava Jansen (Denise Hoey), who is requesting to be extracted from Zaravan; the strike team is deployed to assist her. Upon returning to Deadbolt HQ, Jansen is interrogated by Greene, Soap, and Ravenov. The former claims that Zakhaev possesses weapons-grade Aetherium, and that she's the only one who knows how to stop him. Greene accepts Jansen's offer and assigns the strike team with helping her build an Aetherium Neutralizer device, which is capable of destabilizing Aetherium crystals within its blast radius. Though the first test on raw Aetherium crystals was successful, Jansen points out that Zakhaev has managed to refine his Aetherium, requiring the Neutralizer to be upgraded before it can be deployed against him. She proposes they acquire research data from late scientist Oskar Strauss, a former lead of Requiem, to upgrade the Neutralizer. The strike team launches an assault on one of Zakhaev's outposts in Zaravan, and kills its commander \"Legacy\" Baranov (Luis Bermudez), who was in possession of Strauss' research data.\nWith the Neutralizer complete and ready for use against Zakhaev, Deadbolt deploys to Zakhaev's Aetherium refining plant and prepares to activate the Neutralizer, but faces opposition from Zakhaev's forces as well as a gigantic worm creature, Orcus. Jansen activates the Neutralizer, killing Orcus and destabilizing Zakhaev's vial. A vortex appears, sucking up everything in its wake and forcing Fletcher and Zakhaev to retreat. The vortex lifts Jansen into the air and an entity appears before her, demanding entry; Jansen screams and faints, floating down to the ground as the vortex closes. Ravenov quickly rushes to help Jansen as she opens her eyes, revealing a brief dark purple glow. Afterwards, Deadbolt drone pilot Lucas \"Luke\" Dobbs (Noshir Dalal) informs Ravenov that although the initial activation of the Neutralizer was a success, undead contacts are beginning to reappear across Zaravan, along with an energy spike appearing in the \"red\" zone.\nAt some point following Deadbolt's confrontation with Zakhaev, Jansen begins researching into the Requiem-backed \"Project Janus\" and all involved individuals, including Requiem's former leads and ex-BND agent Samantha Maxis, who trapped herself in the \"Dark Aether\" dimension in 1985 to contain a powerful entity, known as \"the Forsaken\". Jansen confronts Ravenov about his affiliation with Requiem; he tells her that Requiem attempted, but failed, to rescue Maxis from the Dark Aether following her sacrifice, and promises to tell Jansen more about Requiem after the Zaravan outbreak is contained. Jansen is later lured into the Dark Aether by the entity she encountered in Zaravan, forcing Ravenov and the strike team to enter the dimension and rescue her. Ravenov reprimands Jansen for blindly pursuing the research of Requiem scientist Elizabeth Grey (Amy Pemberton). He shows her a recording of Grey from 1996, which reveals that Jansen is Maxis' biological daughter, and Grey gave birth to her via surrogacy, using DNA samples of Maxis and Ravenov. Due to Maxis' exposure to the Dark Aether, Jansen was born with a strong bond to the dimension, and the Entity was a dark reflection of Jansen born at the same time as her. Angered at the revelation, Jansen scolds Ravenov for lying to her before storming off.\nEventually, Jansen decides to return to the Dark Aether to confront the Entity for the final time. She enlists Ravenov and the strike team's help, and enters the dimension through a rift in Zaravan. Ravenov and the strike team defend Jansen from the Entity's undead forces while she performs rituals to sever her connection with the Entity. With Jansen's assistance, the strike team destroys the Entity, though in its final moment, it warns Jansen that \"the Shadowsmiths\" are coming for her. Three months later, Jansen continues to pursue Project Janus, this time by traveling to Liberty Falls, a small West Virginian town where a Dark Aether incursion occurred in February 1991. While chatting with Ravenov on a phone inside her hotel room, Jansen hears a distorted voice calling out to her. A hand emerges from a mirror, pulling Jansen through a portal.\nDevelopment\nModern Warfare III was developed by Sledgehammer Games, and is the fifth mainline Call of Duty title that the studio has worked on, after co-creating 2011's Modern Warfare 3 with Infinity Ward and developing 2014's Advanced Warfare, 2017's WWII and 2021's Vanguard.\nAfter wrapping development on Vanguard, Sledgehammer Games reportedly began early work on a sequel to Advanced Warfare, but Activision chose to shelve the project before it could get far into production; instead, Activision assigned the studio to create an expansion pack for the then-upcoming Modern Warfare II (2022). According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, the expansion was originally intended to feature a new, smaller-scale single-player campaign, which was planned to be set in Mexico, along with new content for Modern Warfare IIs multiplayer component.\nBy Summer 2022, however, Activision chose to reboot the project entirely, tasking Sledgehammer Games with creating a direct, fully-fledged sequel to Modern Warfare II that would feature a rebooted version of original Modern Warfare trilogy antagonist Vladimir Makarov. This decision reportedly left the studio's developers with roughly sixteen months to develop Modern Warfare III, which was a similar schedule to what they faced when developing Vanguard. Treyarch, the lead developer behind the Black Ops sub-series, were also tasked with creating a Zombies mode for Modern Warfare III, making it the first Modern Warfare title to feature a Zombies mode.\nIn another report from Schreier, some developers at Sledgehammer Games claimed that they had initially not been made aware of the decision to turn the project into a full release, leading to crunch. In addition, certain developers were also frustrated with executives at Infinity Ward, who had reportedly stepped in at numerous times during development to make significant (and sometimes unwanted) changes to the project. Aaron Halon, Sledgehammer Games' studio head, has publicly denied Schreier's reporting, stating that plans for the game began \"long before we wrapped up our previous game\" and that Modern Warfare III was \"a labor of love\" that had been \"years in the making\".\nLeaks\nA large amount of content for Modern Warfare III was leaked before being officially revealed. Around July 17, 2023, the \"red dot\" minimap, War mode, and new perks were leaked from an internal alpha build. On July 24, 2023, the game's key art was leaked in a Monster Energy promotion, featuring an image of Captain Price behind the Modern Warfare III logo. Around the time of the key art leak, several new weapons were datamined. The key art leak was confirmed real by Activision, who issued copyright takedowns and acknowledged the leak via Twitter with sarcastic tweets.\nMusic\nWalter Mair composed the score for Modern Warfare III, following Sarah Schachner's departure from the rebooted Modern Warfare sub-series over challenges in the working dynamic with Infinity Ward's audio director. Mair has previously worked with the Call of Duty franchise on Call of Duty: Mobile. In addition to Mair's score, Modern Warfare III also features a Zombies score composed by Jack Wall, who frequently partners with Treyarch on the Black Ops sub-series. Additional music was composed by Steve Ouimette, who previously worked on Modern Warfare II season 2's soundtrack.\nThe soundtrack for Modern Warfare III was released to digital platforms simultaneously with the game's release on November 10, 2023. In addition, rapper 21 Savage released a song in promotion of the game, titled \"Call Me Revenge\", featuring singer d4vd.\nMarketing and release\nOn August 7, 2023, a teaser trailer was posted, confirming the title. Around this time, a phone number was set up by Activision that was shared via social media. This phone number, after participants agreed to a few terms, would begin sending anonymous messages to participants, such as \"we need someone like you, with experience in Al Mazrah.\" This phone number was noted to give unusual responses when sent the word \"zombies\" or the names of multiplayer maps from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (ex. \"Rust\"). A day later, on August 8, Activision confirmed that Modern Warfare II operators, weapons and cosmetic items would carry over into Modern Warfare III and released a blog post detailing the specifics of the carry-over.\nOn August 17, a full reveal took place inside of a Call of Duty: Warzone event, which concluded with a reveal trailer. Pre-orders were also opened, with players being able to play the campaign up to a week early, as well as gain access to new operator skins and an open beta for the multiplayer mode.\nModern Warfare III was released on November 10, 2023, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Similar to Modern Warfare II, the campaign was released in early access for all digital pre-orders, starting from November 2. In July 2024, Modern Warfare III was made available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers. In October 2024, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members were granted the ability to stream the title via Xbox Cloud Gaming.\nPost-release promotions\nAs with previous Call of Duty titles, Modern Warfare III features free seasonal content updates with an in-game store selling cosmetic item bundles via microtransactions.\nSimilar to past Call of Duty season updates, Activision partners with several media franchises to feature celebrities and licensed characters in the playable roster for multiplayer and Zombies modes. New additions include: Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen from the film Dune: Part Two; A-Train and Firecracker from Amazon Prime Video's The Boys TV series; Rick Grimes, Michonne, and Daryl Dixon from AMC's The Walking Dead TV series; the comedy duo Cheech & Chong; basketball player Devin Booker; WWE wrestlers Rhea Ripley, Cody Rhodes and Rey Mysterio; Eric Draven / The Crow from the film The Crow (2024); Michael Myers from the Halloween franchise; Art the Clown from the Terrifier film series; and Sam from the film ''Trick 'r Treat (2007). Additional themed cosmetic packs were also released in promotion of the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, the MonsterVerse film Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the Gundam franchise, the Fallout franchise, and the film Smile 2 (2024).(PS5) 56/100(XSXS) 61/100\n| OC = 13% recommend\n| EuroG =\n| GI = 5/10\n| Fam = 32/40\n| GSpot = : 5/10: 7/10\n| GRadar =\n| IGN = : 4/10: 6/10: 6/10\n| PCGUS = 47%\n| TG =\n| VGC =\n}}\nThe pre-release reviews of Modern Warfare IIIs campaign were negative, with critics highlighting that it felt shallow, short, and rushed. IGN gave the campaign a 4/10, describing it as \"bizarrely cobbling together pieces of the Warzone'' mode into actively bad sandbox missions\".\nUpon the game's official release, it received \"mixed or average reviews\" from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic, with 13% of critics recommending the game on aggregator OpenCritic. It is the lowest-rated mainline Call of Duty installment on Metacritic.\nBleacher Report called the campaign \"disappointing\", but praised the technical aspects as \"top notch\". Both The Guardian and Windows Central gave the game a 4 out of 5 star rating and particularly praised the multiplayer component, with the latter stating that it \"perfectly executes blending old maps with modern gameplay.\"\nSales\nIn the United Kingdom and the United States, Modern Warfare III topped the sales charts for the month of November 2023. However, sales figures were reported to be around 38% down from Modern Warfare IIs figures during the first three weeks of its launch. Modern Warfare III was the second overall best-selling game of 2023 in the United States, behind Hogwarts Legacy. In Japan, the PlayStation 5 version of Modern Warfare III was the fourth best-selling retail game during its first week of release, with 22,132 physical copies being sold.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" width=\"auto\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2024\n||27th Annual D.I.C.E.
