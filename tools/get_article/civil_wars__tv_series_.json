Finkelstein and produced by Steven Bochco.\nSynopsis\nThe series focused on the lives and cases of New York City divorce attorneys. In the series, two of New York City's top divorce lawyers, Charlie Howell (Peter Onorati) and Sydney Guilford (Mariel Hemingway), form a partnership despite barely knowing each other, following the mental breakdown of Guilford's stressed-out partner, Eli Levinson (Alan Rosenberg). The show had a famously misanthropic opening credits sequence; in it, romantic photo albums were shown as the voice track played couples ripping into each other in court, as each of the show's principal attorneys interrogated them, one by one, on the stand.\nCast\n* Mariel Hemingway as Sydney Guilford\n* Peter Onorati as Charlie Howell\n* Debi Mazar as Denise Iannello\n* Alan Rosenberg as Eli Levinson\n* David Marciano as Jeffrey Lassick\nAlan Rosenberg and Debi Mazar continued in their roles as Eli Levinson and Denise Iannello after ABC cancelled Civil Wars in 1993. The two characters were moved over to Bochco’s L.A. Law on NBC for its eighth and final season, with Levinson becoming a member of the series’ major law firm and Iannello serving as his secretary.\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (1991–92)\n| ProdCode = 4101\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4105\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = OJ02\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4108\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4104\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4103\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4106\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4109\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4111\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4110\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4112\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4107\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4113\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4114\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4115\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4116\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4117\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4116\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 000050\n}}\n}}\nSeason 2 (1992–93)\n| ProdCode = 4205\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4209\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4201\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4202\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4203\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4204\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4207\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ProdCode = 4208\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4206\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4210\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4211\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4212\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4213\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ProdCode = 4214\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4215\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4216\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4217\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ProdCode = 4218\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n}}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
