The leaves are densely clustered near the ends of the branchlets and are broadly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base,  long,  wide.

In 2005 Paul Irwin Forster changed the name to Philotheca queenslandica in the journal Austrobaileya.\nDistribution and habitat\nPhilotheca queenslandica grows in wallum heathland in moist or seasonally flooded, boggy or sandy soil. It is found in south-eastern Queensland between Boonooroo and Bribie Island.\nConservation status\nPhilotheca queenslandica is classified as of \"least concern\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.\nReferences"
