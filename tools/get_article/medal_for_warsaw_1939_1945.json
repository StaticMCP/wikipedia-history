For political reasons, most members of the Home Army were not awarded this medal. Pursuant to the decree, the Ministry of National Defense appointed a commission which oversaw the right to be awarded the medal. In 1946, the ministry handed over the right to award the medal to the commanders of military districts, commanders of the 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division, 2nd Warsaw Infantry Division, 3rd Pomeranian Infantry Division, 4th Pomeranian Infantry Division and 6th Pomeranian Infantry Division. The right to award the medal was also given to the commander of the 1st Warsaw Cavalry Division and the General Board of the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy.\nThe medal was later included in the Polish system of decorations by the Law of February 17, 1960 on Orders and Decorations. From 1958, the right to award the medal was granted to the State National Council, after 1989 to the President of the Polish People's Republic, and from January 1, 1990 to the President of the Republic of Poland.\nUntil 1989, a total of 131,242 awards were awarded, and in the years 1993–1999 was awarded to another 4,476 people. A total of 135,837 people were awarded this medal. By the Act of October 16, 1992, the awarding of the medal was deemed completed on May 8, 1999.\nAppearance\nThe Medal for Warsaw 1939–1945 was designed by Polish artists Stanisław Łoza and Stanisław Gepner.\nThe bronze medal is round with a diameter of 33&nbsp;mm.
