Polish forces were part of Tactical Group of General Karol Durski-Trzaska.\nOn October 29, the Group of Durski-Trzaska attacked Russian positions in the outskirts of Mołotków. Polish 4th Battalion commanded by Bolesław Roja managed to reach the center of the village, but was then stopped and forced to retreat. Meanwhile, the bulk of both 2nd and 3rd Regiments, with some 6,000 soldiers, fiercely resisted 12 battalions of Russian infantry (15,000) soldiers, supported by 24 machine guns and 16 cannons. The Russians broke through Polish positions, forcing both regiments to retreat, in order to avoid encirclement.\nPolish losses amounted to 200 dead, 300 wounded and 400 captured by the enemy. The Russians lost 100 dead.\nThe Battle of Mołotków was commemorated in the interwar period on Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with inscription “MOŁOTKÓW 29 X 1914”. The inscription was removed by Communist authorities, and returned after 1990.\nSources\n* Mieczysław Wrzosek, Polski czyn zbrojny podczas pierwszej wojny światowej 1914-1918, Państwowe Wydawnictwo \"Wiedza Powszechna\", Warszawa 1990\nExternal links\n* [https://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/1537017,Bitwa-pod-Molotkowem-krwawy-boj-Legionow Battle of Mołotków] on polskieradio.pl"
