In 2012 it was decided to disestablish the ward for the 2013 election, with the northern part being combined with Matakaoa Ward to form Matakaoa-Waiapu Ward, and the southern part being combined with Uawa Ward to form Tawhiti-Uawa Ward.\nWaiapu Ward contained the towns of Ruatoria, Te Puia Springs, and Tokomaru Bay. The majority of the ward lay within the Waiapu Valley.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Waiapu ward\n\n#REDIRECT Waiapu Ward"
