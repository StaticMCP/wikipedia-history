Residents in the east of the locality can access Kilcummin State School in neighbouring Kilcummin to the east, but it is too distant for those in other parts of the locality. Similarly, Clermont State High School in Clermont to the south-east is the nearest government secondary school, but most residents of Frankfield would be too far away. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
