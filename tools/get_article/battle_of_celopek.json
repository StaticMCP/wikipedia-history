Baceta was to replace the then Chief of Upper Staff, Ilija Jovanović. Baceta and Savatije Milošević, by mid-April, had moved 107 fighters across the border.\nFight\nAt dawn on Holy Saturday (), the two large bands (Cheta) -- Belgrade and Kragujevac -- arrived at the village of Dubočica. There, they were awaited by the bands of Ilija Jovanović, Lazar Kujundžić, Čiča-Pavle Mladenović and Ljubomir Jezdić. The Kragujevac Band was led by captain (kapetan) Borko Paštrović and had the sub-lieutenants (potporučnici): Vojin Popović-Vuk, Dušan Jezdić, Pera Todorović and Dušan Putniković. The Belgrade Band was led by Baceta, and included Vojvoda Savatije, the officers (oficiri) Janićije Mićić, Bogdan Jugović Hajnc, Vojislav Tankosić, Branivoj Jovanović; and the non-commissioned officers (podoficiri) Jović, Radul Kosovac, Novica Leovac, Radoš Vasiljević, Trajko and Radivoje Ilić. They were also accompanied by the bands of Stevan Nedić and Doksim Mihailović, which had been returned to western Povardarje after vacationing in Belgrade.\nOn , at the heights of Čelopek, around 120 chetniks under the command of voivodes Doksim, Čiča-Pavle, Baceta, Kujundžić, Borko Paštrović, Skopljanče, Vojislav Tankosić and Jovan Dovezenski fought a uniformed Ottoman army who were accompanied by Albanians from the surrounding villages. During the battle, Čiča-Pavle took the Čelopek heights and thus prevented the encirclement of the bands by the Albanian bashi-bozuks; overtaking the three peaks gave the chetniks a strategical advantage. After their victory in the battle, they inflicted heavy losses on the Turks and Albanians (over 200 dead and wounded), while only having two dead (Petar Todorović and Radul Kosovac) according to Serbian sources, while British Vice-Consul Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger claimed in a letter dated  that fighting near Kumanovo 'the earlier day' had taken 4 Serbian officers' lives, and 8 captured.\nAftermath\nThe victory enraged the Ottomans, who began a manhunt for the rebels. The rebels were forced to retreat across the border, and were dispersed. Čiča-Pavle and Bacetović were surrounded by the Ottoman army near the village of Beljakovce (today's Kumanovo) on 16 June, and everyone in their bands was killed.\nOn 21 January 1906, another fight took place in the same place, where Vasilije Trbić nearly lost his whole band (22 men) to the Ottomans.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
