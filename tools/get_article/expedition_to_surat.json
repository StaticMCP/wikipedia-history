After being instigated by both British and Dutch authorities, the local Nawab sent Indian troops and occupied the fortress, holding Christopher Henric Braad and several of his companions captive for 20 days.\nBackground\nAfter some time in India, Christopher Henric Braad, a member of the SOIC, had grown tired of waiting for a Swedish ship to arrive. Instead, he boarded a British vessel bound for Europe, and after being saved from a shipwreck in Limerick, he arrived back in Göteborg in 1759.\nAfter going back to the SOIC's headquarters, he began arguing for a new Swedish factory there, showing different numbers and graphs. He also argued that the imminent war between France and Britain would allow an opportunity for Sweden. A Swedish factory could be established in Surat, where prices were lower and where people would be able to find markets for their goods, allowing them to buy cotton among other things to export to China.\nExpedition\nIn April 1760, the ship Riksens Ständer with Braad onboard began its journey to India, with the goal being to establish a new Swedish factory in Surat. However, after arriving, likely at the instigation of other European powers like the Dutch and British, a tense relationship had developed between the Swedes and Indians.\nThe British, mistrustful of the Swedes, began doing whatever they could to prevent the Swedes in their work, and managed to make the locals also mistrust the Swedes. Suddenly, the local Nawab sent a military force of Indian troops, quickly defeating the Swedes and occupying the Swedish factory.\nAftermath\nAfter the attack, Braad and the others were imprisoned in the factory by the Indian troops. However, due to \"careful steps taken\", they were able to avoid serious consequences and instead continued the journey to China. Despite the attack, the visit to Surat yielded a profit, and after deducting wages for the crew and other things, the Swedes had a profit of 93,575 rupees.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*"
