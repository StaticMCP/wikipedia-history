In 2008 the awards went national and were renamed the National Indigenous Music Awards.\nJust a couple of weeks before the scheduled date of the 2021 event on 7 August, it was announced that it would be postponed until later in the year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic flaring in New South Wales.\nIn 2025, the event began a partnership with YouTube and the ceremony was livestreamed globally on the platform.\nDescription\nThe National Indigenous Music Awards are awarded during the Darwin Festival and run by MusicNT in association with the Northern Territory Government. They recognise excellence, innovation and leadership among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander musicians from throughout Australia. The Awards are presented at a special event in August as part of the Darwin Festival in Darwin, Northern Territory, and feature the best of Indigenous music talent.\nEligibility and categories\nTo be eligible, the associated release or achievement must have taken place from July (the year prior) to June (the year of the awards).\nThe categories have changed over the years, but the main categories in the ceremony include Artist/Act of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Film clip of the Year and Best New Talent/Emerging Talent, as well as an inductee into the Hall of Fame.\nUnearthed NIMAs Competition\nRadio station Triple j runs the Unearthed National Indigenous Music Awards Competition to select an emerging Indigenous artist to play at the Awards. Winners have included Dallas Woods, Thelma Plum, Baker Boy, Alice Skye, Kuren, and Tilly Tjala Thomas.\nAwards by year\nTo see the full article for a particular year, please click on the year link.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
