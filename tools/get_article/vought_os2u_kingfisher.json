It was a compact mid-wing monoplane, with a large central float and small stabilizing floats. Performance was modest because of its low-powered engine. The OS2U could also operate on fixed, wheeled, taildragger landing gear.\nThe OS2U was the main shipboard observation seaplane used by the United States Navy during World War II, and 1,519 of the aircraft were built. It served on battleships and cruisers of the U.S. Navy, with the United States Marine Corps in Marine Scouting Squadron Three (VMS-3), with the United States Coast Guard at coastal air stations; at sea with the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy; with the Soviet Navy; and with the Royal Australian Air Force.\nThe Naval Aircraft Factory OS2N was the designation of the OS2U-3 aircraft built by the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The OS2U first flew on 1 March 1938.\nDesign and development\nIn the late 1930s, Vought engineer Rex Beisel was tasked with designing an observation monoplane aircraft for the U.S. Navy suitable for many tasks, including directing battleship fire. In replacing the standard biplane observation aircraft with a more modern monoplane design, Beisel incorporated innovations making it the first production type to be assembled with spot welding, a process Vought and the Naval Aircraft Factory jointly developed to create a smooth fuselage that resisted buckling and generated less drag. Beisel also introduced high-lift devices and spoilers. In a unique arrangement, deflector plate flaps and drooping ailerons were located on the trailing edge of the wing to increase the camber of the wing and thus create additional lift. Beisel's first prototype flew in 1938, powered by an air-cooled,  Pratt & Whitney R-985-4 Wasp Junior radial engine.\nFor combat missions, the pilot had a  Browning M1919 machine gun, the receiver mounted low in the right front cockpit, firing between the engine cylinder heads, while the radio operator/gunner manned another  machine gun (or a pair) on a flexible Scarff ring mount. The aircraft could also carry two  bombs or two  depth charges. Additionally, the \"Kingfisher\", as it was designated, served as a trainer in both its floatplane and landplane configurations.\nOperational history\non the wings of an OS2U Kingfisher, 1 May 1944]]\nlaunches (left) while  recovers (right) Vought OS2U Kingfishers in 1944.\n}}\nThe first 54 Kingfishers were delivered to the U.S. Navy beginning in August 1940, and 6 had been assigned to the Pearl Harbor–based Battle Force before the end of the same year. Many of the following 158 OS2U-2s were attached to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, but 53 were assigned to equip the newly established Inshore Patrol Squadrons, based at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. In 1942, nine more Inshore Patrol Squadrons were established, all exclusively equipped with OS2N-1s built by the Naval Aircraft Factory.\nThe Kingfisher was widely used as a shipboard, catapult-launched scout plane on U.S. Navy battleships, heavy cruisers, and light cruisers during World War II and played a major role in support of shore bombardments and air-sea rescue. Two examples showing the plane's rescue capabilities include the recovery of World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker and his crew from the Pacific in November 1942 and Lieutenant John A. Burns' unique use of the aircraft on 30 April 1944 to taxi airmen rescued from Truk Lagoon to the submarine , which was serving rescue duty near the atoll. In all, Burns rescued ten survivors on two trips and was awarded the Navy Cross for his efforts.\nThe United States Coast Guard received 76 OS2U-3 Kingfishers starting in 1942 and employed them in anti-submarine warfare, reconnaissance, and search and rescue roles. No Coast Guard Kingfisher is credited with sinking any enemy submarines; however, they were successful in rescuing sailors from ships sunk by enemy torpedoes. The Coast Guard operated Kingfishers until October 1944.\nAustralia received 18 Kingfishers from a batch of aircraft ordered by the Dutch East Indies that was diverted to Australia in 1942. They were initially used as training aircraft for pilots destined for flying boats, but in 1943 they were used to equip No. 107 Squadron RAAF, which carried out convoy escort duties until disbanded in October 1945. One Kingfisher was used in support of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947–48.\nThroughout its U.S. Navy service, the OS2U and even its predecessor, the Curtiss SOC Seagull, served much longer than planned, as the planned successor, the Curtiss SO3C Seamew, suffered from an insufficiently powerful engine which was a complete failure. The OS2U was only slowly replaced in the latter stages of World War II with the introduction of the Curtiss SC Seahawk, the first examples reaching the U.S. Navy in October 1944.\nVariants\n, 1941.]]\n;XOS2U-1\n:Prototype Vought Model VS.310 powered by a  Pratt & Whitney R-985-4 engine, one built.\n;OS2U-1\n:Initial production variant as the prototype but powered by a  Pratt & Whitney R-985-48, 54 built.\n;OS2U-2\n:Production variant with minor equipment changes and powered by a  Pratt & Whitney R-985-50, 158 built.\n;OS2U-3\n:Based on the OS2U-2 with self-sealing fuel tanks, armour protection, two  guns (dorsal and nose mounted), and able to carry  of depth charges or  bombs, powered by a  Pratt & Whitney R-985-AN2 engine, 1006 built.\n;OS2U-4\n:Two aircraft converted with narrow-chord and high-aspect ratio wings, also fitted with full-span flaps.

It crashed there on a ferry flight to Alaska during World War II. It was initially restored for display by volunteers at Vought Aeronautics in Grand Prairie, Texas and sent to the battleship in 1971. The 2018 restoration of the Kingfisher was managed by a Wilmington resident and the Carolina Chapter of the Flight Deck Veterans Group.\n; In storage\n; OS2U-3\n*09643 – In storage at the Yanks Air Museum, Chino, California.\nSpecifications (OS2U-3)\n|prime units?=imp\n|crew=2\n|length ft=33\n|length in=7.2\n|length note=\n|span ft=35\n|span in=10.7\n|span note=\n|height ft=14\n|height in=8\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=261.9\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=root: NACA 23015; tip: NACA 23009\n|empty weight lb=3335\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight lb=4980\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=6000\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity= in an integral wing tank\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Pratt & Whitney R-985-AN2 Wasp Junior\n|eng1 type=9-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine\n|eng1 hp=450\n|eng1 note=for take-off\n:::: at\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=Hamilton Standard constant-speed propeller\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop dia note=\n|max speed mph=171\n|max speed note=at\n|cruise speed mph=152\n|cruise speed note=with 75% power at\n*Landing speed:\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range miles=908\n|range note=with 75% power at\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling ft=18200\n|ceiling note=\n|climb rate ftmin=960\n|climb rate note=at\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=19\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n*Take-off run:\n*Take-off distance to :\n*Landing run:\n*Landing distance from : -->\n|guns= One fixed, forward firing  M1919 Browning machine gun with 500 rounds and one  M1919 Browning machine gun with 600 rounds, flexibly mounted for the observer.\n|bombs=  of bombs or depth charges.\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3901/is_200406/ai_n9446476/pg_1 Wainwright, Marshall. \"Kingfisher goes to war\" Air Classics, June 2004.]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=vSYDAAAAMBAJ&dq=popular+science+june+1941&pg=PA61 \"Slingshot Planes\" Popular Science, May 1943] also [https://books.google.com/books?id=vSYDAAAAMBAJ&dq=popular+science+june+1941&pg=PA62 page 62] of the same article\n* [http://www.navsource.net/archives/01/57k1.htm NavSource Online: Battleship Photo Archive Vought OS2U Kingfisher]"
