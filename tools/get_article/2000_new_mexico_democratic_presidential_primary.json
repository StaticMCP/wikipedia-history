The New Mexico primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 35 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 26 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president and presumptive nominee Al Gore won the primary with roughly 74% of the vote and won 23 delegates, helping him solidify his presumptive nomination over Bill Bradley, who had suspended his campaign three months earlier, narrowly passed the threshold of 15% and received 3 delegates, while Lyndon LaRouche Jr. and Uncommitted ballot option received roughly 2% respectively.\nProcedure\nNew Mexico was one of five states that voted on June 6, 2000, in the Democratic primaries, along with Alabama, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7&nbsp;a.m. until 7&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15% at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 26 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results. Of these, between 5 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 3 congressional districts and another 3 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 6 at-large delegates.\nThe delegation also included 8 unpledged PLEO delegates: 5 members of the Democratic National Committee, 2 members of Congress (1 senator, Jeff Bingaman, and 1 representative, Tom Udall), 1 distinguished party leader, and 1 add on.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
