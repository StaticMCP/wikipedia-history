This commission was made up of representatives of state institutions, the academic community and civil society, assumed by EP Division General , also as an objective for the preparation and execution of the commemorative program throughout the country, for the 150th anniversary of Independence of Peru in 1971.\nThe Sesquicentennial Commission was in charge of organizing academic events, historical and music research contests, as well as advising on the construction of monuments and commemorative objects throughout the country; such as the Monument to San Martín and the Liberating Expedition (Paracas), Monument to the Heroes of Independence (Lima), Monument to Francisco Antonio de Zela (Tacna), Monument to the victors of Ayacucho (Ayacucho), etc. Likewise, plaques and busts were inaugurated in honor of all those who with their contribution, thought and exercise contributed to the Peruvian emancipation.\nThe academic work of the commission was reflected in 86 volumes of the Documentary Collection of the Independence of Peru, the History of the Emancipation of Peru and other publications.
