Sal cinquemani from Slant wrote that Keys \"declares\" on the song: “What if sex was holy and war was obscene/And it wasn't twisted,” and noted that \"at its core\", \"Holy War\" is a love song. In addition, Keys sings: “Maybe we should love somebody / Maybe we could care a little more / Maybe we could love somebody / Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war”. Describing its composition, Ryan Reed from Rolling Stone wrote that it \"quietly builds its minimalist arrangement, incorporating finger snaps, echoing snares and snaking, reversed samples\".\nAccording to Allmusic's Andy Kellman, the song discusses \"backward societal views of war and sex\". Ben Dandridge-Lemco from The Fader described the song as a \"guitar-driven ballad about healing the ills of the world\". Hilary Hughes from MTV News, described the song as a \"free love anthem\" and wrote that the song \"begs for understanding and compassion to win out over the destructive forces of hate, ignorance, violence, and greed\". According to Andy Gill from The Independent, the song \"critiqu[es] the separatist urge to build walls\". Accordin to Danny Schwartz from HotNewHipHop, the song could be intpreted in two ways, as an \"anti-Trump protest song\" or as an \"apolitical pro-love anthem\". He also opined that Keys \"beseeches us to give up divisive language and hateful thoughts and embrace our fellow man\" on the song. while Maurita Salkey from Revolt wrote that \"Keys shares her passion for bringing people together while emphasizing we are all one and no different from one another\".\nCritical reception\nTom Breihan from Stereogum wrote that  the song is a \"big, stormy heal-the-world ballad\" and \"while it's not as entrancing as Keys’ best songs, it's a work of real pop-music professionalism\". That Grape Juice wrote that \"Keys shows off her oft-praised pipes yet again in this simple, yet stunning arrangement\". Nolan Feeney from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song \"makes for one of the album's most spine-chilling performances\". Tom Barnes from Mic praised the song and its message, writing that as \"the most woke political track of 2016\", the song aims to \"get our society to face its most uncomfortable internal contradictions\", concluding that it's the \"most confrontational track Keys has ever released\". Maeve McDermott from USA Today highlighted the song, writing that: \"The album's final song brings Here's cinematic arc to a close, its hypothetical credits rolling over Keys' smoldering vocals and cinematic chorus likening war, sex and love\". In her review of Here, Emily Macay from The Guardian was positive, writing that \"Best of all are Holy War, which sorrows over the world's skewed priorities as it showcases the gritty, gut-punch power of Keys's voice at its best\".

Ryan Reed from Rolling Stone was also positive, calling the song \"soulful\" and praising Keys' delivery of the song, writing \"Keys explores her dynamic vocal range, from a soft croon to a raspy, full-throated roar\".

Reviewing Here for Salon, David Masciotra called the song one of standout tracks on the album, writing that \"The profound political commentary of the verses, referring to homophobia, religious violence, terrorism, and ethnic division, is met by the beautiful simplicity of the chorus\".\nLive performances\nKeys performed the song at 2016 Keep a Child Alive Black Ball on October 19, 2016.
