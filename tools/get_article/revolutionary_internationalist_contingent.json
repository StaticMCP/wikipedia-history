The basic programmatic document of the group was Break the Chains!  The group suffered a split in 1987.\nInternationally, the RIC was aligned with the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement. A London-based group calling itself \"Supporters of the RIM in Britain\" continued to produce a journal from 1988 to 1991.\nReferences"
