Macedonian, over-matched by every measure, was captured after a short fight. She became USS Macedonian, and served in the United States Navy until late 1828.  Arriving in Virginia 30 October 1828, she was decommissioned and broken up at Gosport Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Va. Her keel became that of the US Navy's second , a 36‑gun frigate started in 1832. Some time afterwards, the old ''Macedonian's'' figurehead became a monument at the shipyard. It was transferred to the Academy in 1875.\nThe monument was refreshened in 2014.  The figurehead was replaced with a newly carved mahogany version, the benches were replaced, the concrete base was repaired, and the cannons and plaques were refurbished. The project cost $300,000, provided as a gift by the Academy class of 1973. The rededication ceremony was 25 April 2014.\nReferences\nExternal links"
