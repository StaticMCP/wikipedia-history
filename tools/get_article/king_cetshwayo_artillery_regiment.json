This occurred in a series of engagements called the Battle of Gazala. One of these engagements was Rommel's attack against Allied forces near Tobruk was on 13 June 1942. The 21st Panzer Division attacked South African positions on Rigel Ridge in the middle of a sandstorm. This was the 6th South African Anti-tank battery of the 2nd field regiment. The South African gunners kept firing until all their guns were destroyed, allowing the withdrawal of other Allied formations. The guns were commanded individually and fired at the Panzers over open sights. The German tanks took up positions behind the ridge with anti-tank guns placed between them. The Germans put down a devastating fire onto the South African positions. One of the columns of Panzers attacked them from the rear, surrounding them and cutting off all escape. Nevertheless, the gunners kept firing until all eight guns had been destroyed. About half the gun detachments were killed and wounded, including the battery commander and many officers. When the battery had been silenced, the enemy tanks approached cautiously and the South African gunners were made prisoners. The entire Natal Field Artillery Regiment was captured and would not be re-formed until after the war. On that day the Germans captured over 3,000 Allied prisoners.\nAfter the Second World War, the regiment eventually became attached to the 84 Motorised Brigade of the 8th South African Armoured Division.\nOther names\nFrom 1913 to 1926, the NFA was designated the 7th Citizen Battery (NFA).  From 1926 to 1932, it was the 2nd Citizen Battery (NFA). During the Second World War, it was the 2nd Field Regiment (NFA).\nFrom 1960 to 1968, the regiment was affiliated to the University of Natal and was called the Natal University Regiment.\nIn August 2019, 52 Reserve Force units had their names changed to reflect the diverse military history of South Africa. The Natal Field Artillery became the King Cetshwayo Artillery Regiment, and have 3 years to design and implement new regimental insignia.\nLeadership\n|to-date=1989}}\nRegimental insignia\nFreedom of the City\nThe regiment was awarded the Freedom of Durban on 28 September 1962, the Freedom of Pietermaritzburg on 29 September 1962 and the Freedom of eMnambithi / Ladysmith on 2 July 2011.\nReferences"
