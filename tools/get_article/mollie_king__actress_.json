Two of her older siblings, Charles King and Nellie King also became actors and were likely instrumental in obtaining earlier roles for her in theatre. Mollie began working professionally on stage at the age of seven. Later, by age 16, she was appearing at the Winter Garden Theatre and at other Broadway venues. A few of her stage credits include roles in Good Morning, Judge and Blue Eyes.\nFilm career\nKing signed with Pathé before moving into film acting. She was cast in leading roles in two John M. Stahl directed films, and also starred in serials. George Irving directed her in the film Her Majesty. She later returned to the stage, appearing with her brother Charles King in a musical comedy Good Morning, Judge.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1918, King tried to enlist as an ambulance driver for the US Army in France. It took two sergeants and a first lieutenant to convince her that women are not wanted at that position.\nKing married Kentucky distiller Kenneth D. Alexander in 1919. The couple remained married until Kenneth's death in Arkansas in July 1935. On March 9, 1943, at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., she married Thomas Henry Claffey, with her son Flight Officer Kenneth Alexander of the Royal Air Force serving as best man.\nIn 1981, at age 86, King died of a stroke in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Her gravesite, however, is in her hometown of New York City, at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, as is that of her husband, who died the following year.\nFilmography\n, 1919]]\n* (1916)\n*A Circus Romance (1916)\n* (1916)\n* (1916)\n*The Summer Girl (1916)\n* (1916)\n*The Mystery of the Double Cross (1917)\n*The Seven Pearls (1917)\n*Kick In (1917)\n* Blind Man's Luck (1917)\n*The On-the-Square Girl (1917)\n*  (1917)\n*  (1920)\n*Suspicious Wives (1921)\n*Her Majesty (1922)\n*Pied Piper Malone'' (1924)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
