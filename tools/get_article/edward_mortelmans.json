He is best known for illustrating some books by Gerald Durrell, and covers for books by Edgar Rice Burroughs.\nMortelmans was a watercolor artist, who commercially practiced cover artistry and book illustration, mostly for a visual audience of children and young adults.  He illustrated the cover for a number of E. R. Burroughs paperback editions for Four Square Books including The Son of Tarzan, The Beasts of Tarzan and Lost on Venus. For Pan Books in the mid-1950s he produced the covers of Saint Overboard by Leslie Charteris and for Anthony Richardson's true war adventure Wingless Victory, among others. He also did some magazine work, including cover designs for the first American pulp magazine, Argosy. He has also been associated with illustrating several series, like the Twenty Names series of Hodder and Stoughton, How and Why Wonder Books of Corgi Books and the Oxford Graded Readers series of Oxford University Press.
