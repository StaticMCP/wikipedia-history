He made his List A debut on 27 December 2015 in the 2015–16 Ford Trophy. He made his first-class debut for Otago in the 2017–18 Plunket Shield season on 7 November 2017.\nIn December 2017, during a Twenty20 match between Otago and Northern Districts in the 2017–18 Super Smash, Barnes wore a protective helmet when he bowled. This is because it was felt he was particularly vulnerable due to his bowling action. The helmet is based on a hockey mask and was amended by a prosthetics designer in Dunedin to cover the top of the head.\nIn June 2018, he was awarded a contract with Otago for the 2018–19 season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
