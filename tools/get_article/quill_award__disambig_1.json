It was a \"consumer-driven award created to inspire reading while promoting literacy\".\nThe Quills Foundation, the organization behind the award, was supported by a number of notable media corporations, including Reed Business Information, then parent of Publishers Weekly, and NBC Universal Television Stations, along with Parade Magazine, Borders, Barnes & Noble, and the American Booksellers Association.\nHistory\nIn February 2008, Reed Business Information announced plans to dissolve the awards program and distribute the remaining Foundation funds to non-profit organizations First Book and Literacy Partners. Reed declined to give reasons for the suspension, but the awards had produced little effect on book sales, and the televised ceremonies were criticized for being too long and poorly planned.\nSelection process\nWinners were selected through a two-part process involving nomination by industry experts and final selection by consumer votes. To be eligible for nomination, a book had to be published in English during the previous year and be included in at least one industry or sponsor listing.\nReaders selected the winners from among the five nominees selected by the board for each category. For the 2007 edition, however, the choice by public vote was restricted to book of the year, and winners in other categories were chosen by retailers and librarians.\n2007 Quill Award winners\n*Book of the year: Angels Fall, Nora Roberts\n*Debut author of the year: Diane Setterfield, The Thirteenth Tale\n*Audio book: To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee (read by Sissy Spacek)\n*'''Children's illustrated book:' Flotsam, David Wiesner\n*'Children's chapter book/middle grade:' The Invention of Hugo Cabret, Brian Selznick\n*Young adult/teen: Sold, Patricia McCormick\n*General fiction: The Road, Cormac McCarthy\n*Graphic novel: Making Comics, Scott McCloud\n*Mystery/suspense/thriller: What the Dead Know, Laura Lippman\n*Poetry: For the Confederate Dead, Kevin Young\n*Romance: Angels Fall, Nora Roberts\n*Science fiction/fantasy/horror: The Name of the Wind, Patrick Rothfuss\n*Religion/spirituality: Religious Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know - And Doesn't, Stephen Prothero\n*Biography/memoir: Einstein: His Life and Universe, Walter Isaacson\n*Business: The No Asshole Rule, Robert I.
