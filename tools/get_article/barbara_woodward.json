She served as Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations from 2020 to 2025, having previously been the British Ambassador to China from 2015 to 2020, the first woman to hold that position.\nWoodward undertook her undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, before going on to study international relations at Yale University. She joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1994 and has worked in China and Russia, and at the European Union and the United Nations.\nEarly years\nWoodward was born in Gipping, Suffolk, to Arthur Claude Woodward (1921–1992) and Rosemary Monica Gabrielle Fenton.

In 1983, she took a MA in history from St Andrews. She taught English, first at Nankai University and then at Hubei University, in Wuhan, China, between 1986 and 1988. She later learned and mastered Chinese. Her teacher in London gave her the Chinese name Wu Baina (吴百纳 Wú Bǎinà).
