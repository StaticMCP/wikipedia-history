It is a unit within the Government of Queensland's Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy.\nGSQ collects geoscience data either from industry - mining companies compels by legislation to report certain activities - or directly through its own surveys and then shares that information, sometimes after embargo periods, to enable potential investors a better understanding of the resource potential of Queensland.\nThe GSQ works closely with Australia's equivalent national government agency, Geoscience Australia, to ensure that data collected/generated by either agency is interoperable since resource potential may cross state borders.\nGSQ is also involved with international efforts to standardise the reporting and representation of geoscience information, particularly through Semantic Web-based initiatives such as the ESIP Federation's [http://sweetontology.net Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) Ontologies] project which operates an integrated ontology used to model a wide range of geological (and many other) scientific concepts.\nThrough its current Geoscience Data Mondernisation Program (GDMP), GSQ intends to greatly increase the proportion of its data holdings that it makes publicly available from the current 10% to 90%, by 2021. This program is thought, by GSQ staff, to position GSQ at the cutting edge of government public data delivery both amongst Australia government organisations and its geological survey agency peers internationally.\nIn 2018, GSQ turned 150th years old making it one of the older geological agencies in the world today. Queensland's first geologists, Richard Daintree and Christopher Aplin, were appointed in April 1868.\nSee also\n* [https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq Geological Survey of Queensland, DNRME web page]\n* Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy\nReferences"
