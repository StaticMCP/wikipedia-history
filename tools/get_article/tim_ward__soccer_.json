Following his graduation, he played a year of college soccer at Saint Louis University, starting 18 games for the Billikens, and being named second-team All-Conference USA.\nProfessional\nWard left after his freshman season to sign a Generation adidas contract with MLS, whereupon he was selected 12th overall in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft by the MetroStars, who acquired the pick by trading Cornell Glen to FC Dallas. Ward acquitted himself well in his rookie season, especially with his runs and crosses from the left back spot. After the year, he was traded to Columbus Crew for Chris Henderson.\nAfter two seasons in Columbus, Ward was traded to Colorado Rapids on February 27, 2008, for Nicolas Hernández. However, he was waived at the end of the 2008 season without playing a first-team game. He was on trial with Chicago Fire for most of early 2009, eventually signing with the team in March. In 2009 Ward started all 19 games he appeared in for Chicago before breaking a toe on his left foot in the Superliga final against Mexican powerhouse Tigres and opting for surgery. Ward returned to Chicago in 2010. On August 6, 2010, Ward was traded to San Jose Earthquakes for a 2011 MLS SuperDraft pick. Ward remained with San Jose through the 2012 season appearing in 16 league matches until his contract expired on December 31, 2012.  Unfortunately, Ward has to retire early because of a torn hamstring tendon suffered in a preseason game against eventual English Premier League Champions Leicester City.\nInternational\nWard has played for various youth United States national teams, and was part of the Under-20 team at the 2005 World Youth Championship. He had to miss the tournament due to an injury.  Ward also was a member of the Under-20 team at the 2007 World Youth Championship.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
