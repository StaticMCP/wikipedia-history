Adinarayana Rao under Anjali Pictures, and directed by Vedantam Raghavayya. It stars N. T. Rama Rao an Anjali Devi, with music composed by P. Adinarayana Rao. The film was simultaneously made in Tamil as Mangaiyar Ullam Mangatha Selvam.\nPlot\nOnce upon a time, there was a kingdom. On the eve of Prince Chandrabhanu's birthday, a dancer, Swarna Manjari, mentored by her father Varma, does a gig, and the two fall in love. Following this, Chandrabhanu orders his baleful chief minister, Mahendra Shakti, to give them a big hand, who ruses and expels them for his lust for Swarna Manjari. Moreover, he holds page two as a vicious wizard and intrigues her to sacrifice for immortality. So, Mahendra abducts her, but she absconds. Meanwhile, Chandrabhanu, on tour with his best friend, gets knowledge of it via Varma when he pledges to shield Swarna Manjari and hails her as his queen. After a long quest, they halt at an arcane place where a Mermaid, Yamini, drags Chandrabhanu into the underwater world and tries to lure him, but in vain. Plus, a creeper, Latha, catches Srimukha, and they crush. Fortuitously, Swarna Manjari winds up therein, aware of the plight, and moves to rescue her beloved. Underwater, with the blessing of Jalakanteshwara, retrieves Chandrabhanu. However, Yamini cuts her to pieces when Chandrabhanu beseeches her, and she accepts if he backs her by the full moon day. Ergo, Swarna Manjari becomes usual, but her hands are misplaced. Despite this, Chandrabhanu knits her, and the word-wise Mermaid nets him. By that time, Swarna Manjari gives birth to a baby boy when Mahendra ruses and ostracizes her with the baby. In the forest, they detach. The baby reaches Varma, and he recognizes him by his locket. Besides, the Mermaid applies Chandrabhanu to comfort her curse, which he does, accomplishing a venturesome act, and she frees him. In the minute of his back, Chandrabhanu detects Mahendra's fraud, and he seizes him. Eventually, while seeking the baby, Swarna Manjari secures a snake god, and she recoups the hands with its boon. At last, all arrive at Mahendra's cave when Chandrabhanu ceases the blackguard. Finally, the movie ends happily.\nCast\n*N. T.
