The monument consists of a rusticated fieldstone base, on which a cubical stone with inscriptions has been set.  This is topped by an obelisk-like tapering marble element with a square cross section, which is topped by a sphere adorned with floral detailing.  It is set in a square area  on each side, in which a number of Union Army soldiers are buried.  The monument was placed in 1894 by the local chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union Army veterans' organization.  White County, where Judsonia is located, was divided in the war, with men from the county serving on both sides in the conflict.\nThe memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas\nReferences"
