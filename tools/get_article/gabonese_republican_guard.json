President Omar Bongo recruited members of the Presidential Guard from his own Bateke ethnic group. The Presidential Guard is committed daily some 750 people for security missions and 150 for missions normal. Since the death of Bongo in June 2009, the Republican Guard began to maintain a regular presence at every major intersection in Libreville and Bord de Mer, with French advisors being present at the larger intersections. It has close contact in the United States Africa Command East Africa Response Force.\nIn late 2015, the Republican Guard acquired a Gulfstream G650 for VIP transport.\nCoup attempt\nIn 2019, the Republican Guard was at the center of a coup attempt to oust President Ali Bongo's government.
