He is an American of Indonesian and Filipino ancestry.\nSastrowardoyo was raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and attended P.S. 163 and The Collegiate School as an elementary school student.\nHis tertiary education was at New York University and The New School.\nCareer\nSastrowardoyo began his journalism career as a reporter, copy editor and photographer on his junior high school and high school newspapers in Brentwood, New York. He was editor-in-chief of the Brentwood High School yearbook in 1981, which won honorable mentions from the American Scholastic Press Association and the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. Sastrowardoyo was also news director for WXBA-FM.\nHis first paying job was as an events photographer for the Brentwood school district. He has since dabbled in wedding photography, wedding videography, dance photography, and theatrical photography for Deborah Savadge's Woodstock Theatre Company (based in New Paltz, New York) and Algonquin Productions\nAfter working at Banque Indosuez, Dial Germany/Dial Bavaria (a travel wholesaler) and Marubeni America Corporation, Sastrowardoyo was hired as a copyboy at The New York Times in the fall of 1987. From 1988 to 2006, he was on the staff of the cultural news desk, and named a staff editor in 1999. From March 2006 to December 2009, he worked on the foreign news desk. Sastrowardoyo worked at the Times's United Nations bureau in November and December 2007.\nSastrowardoyo studied acting with Deborah Savadge beginning in the fall of 1989, ostensibly as a means to help him deal with his shyness. It was instrumental in helping him deal with his brother Sabartomo's death a few years previously. He has also studied poetry with Kimiko Hahn, Richard Tayson and Li-Young Lee; performance with Beau Sia and the Asian American troupe Peeling; playwriting with Julia Cho and David Henry Hwang; photography with Charles Gatewood; dance with Ducky DooLittle and Pamardi Tjiptopradonggo; and writing with Rachel Kramer Bussel and Paul Levitz.\nIn 1989 and 1990, Sastrowardoyo was a contributing editor for volumes 7 and 8 of Contemporary Theater, Film and Television, a reference series published by Gale Research (now known as Thomson Gale).\nIn the summer of 1990, Sastrowardoyo and some classmates from Deborah Savadge's acting class (directed by Guy Ventoliere) performed a series of one-act plays, originally performed by the Actors Theatre of Louisville, as a benefit for Coalition for the Homeless.\nSastrowardoyo gave a poetry reading at the Asian American Writers Workshop in January 2000. His one-act play, Lessons Learned, was scheduled to be read at AAWW on September 11, 2001, but the events of that day postponed its reading until September 24, 2001.\nSastrowardoyo retired from the Times in 2009.\nPersonal\nSastrowardoyo is the eldest son of Sumarsongko H. Sastrowardoyo (1929-2018), born in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, of the Economics and Information staff of the Consulate General of Indonesia, and Teresita M. Sastrowardoyo (1933-2020), born in Maasin, Iloilo, the Philippines, an operating room registered nurse. They were married at Calvary Baptist Church in New York City in 1962.\nSastrowardoyo's middle brother, Sabartomo Daniel Sastrowardoyo (1965–1986), died in an accident while a student at Cornell University. His youngest brother, Hartriono Benjamin Sastrowardoyo (b. 1969), is a reporter and online producer for the Asbury Park Press.\nSastrowardoyo is a nephew of Soenario (1902–1997), Indonesia's minister of foreign affairs from 1953 to 1955; and Subagio Sastrowardoyo (1924–1995), a noted poet, writer, essayist and literary critic. He is also a cousin of Sunaryati Hartono (1931-2023) and Astrid Susanto (1936–2006), officials in the Indonesian government; and Marina Joesoef (b. 1959), an Indonesian artist.\nSastrowardoyo is a first cousin once removed of the Indonesian actress Dian Sastrowardoyo (b. 1982).\nHis surname is derived from shastra (Sanskrit, writings) and hridaya (Sanskrit, heart), so literally means \"writings of the heart.\" His given name reportedly means \"of noble blood\" or \"noble-hearted.\" His first middle name was after his maternal grandfather, who died in 1952.\nHis paternal grandfather, Sutejo Sastrowardoyo (1878–1967), traced the family's ancestry back to 15th century Java.\nSastrowardoyo was raised Baptist but left the church in 1978. He became a Muslim revert after the events of 9/11, when his former minister in Central Islip, New York opined that God had used Muslims as an instrument of His wrath against a decadent America.\nTrivia\n* Sastrowardoyo was one of the subjects of a practical joke on April 1, 2001, where his name was put in place of an actor's name in The New York Times 's database of films.\n* Sastrowardoyo wears a bracelet on his right wrist in memory of Michael H. Waye, a junior high and high school friend who was killed in the 9/11 attacks.\n* On September 25, 2011, Sastrowardoyo spoke briefly at the memorial service for Nathaniel Rand, a Cornell University student who had died in a similar manner to Sastrowardoyo's brother Sabartomo.\n* Sastrowardoyo was tuckerized as a character in Dayton Ward's Star Trek novel, The Fall: Peaceable Kingdoms, published in December 2013.\nBibliography\nJournalism\nPrint\n* \"Babylon 5 Enters Its Final Stages.\" The New York Times, 19 July 1998.\n* \"Writing away for tickets, or trying to get on camera.\" (sidebar to Matt Lee and Ted Lee's \"American Cities: Who Wants to Be in the Audience?\") The New York Times, 14 May 2000.\n* \"For Young Viewers: Pooh's New Adventures, in a 100-Gigabyte Wood.\" The New York Times, 21 January 2001.\n* Review of Better Luck Tomorrow.
