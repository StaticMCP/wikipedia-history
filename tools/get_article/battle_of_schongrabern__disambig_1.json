On 13 November 1805, Marshals Murat and Lannes, commanding the French advance guard, had captured a bridge over the Danube at Vienna by falsely claiming that an armistice had been signed, and then rushing the bridge while the guards were distracted. Kutuzov needed to gain time to make contact near Brno (Brünn) with reinforcements led by Buxhowden. He ordered his rearguard under Major-General Prince Pyotr Bagration to delay the French.\nMurat and Lannes commanded the 4th and 5th Corps and the Reserve Cavalry. Bagration took up a position about 6&nbsp;km north of Hollabrunn, on the hill above the small town of Schöngrabern (today part of Grabern). Murat believed the whole Russian army was before him and hesitated to attack. Bagration then suggested to Murat that negotiations for an armistice should be opened. Murat agreed and did not attack. When Napoleon was informed of this, he was furious and wrote to Murat:\nOn 16 November 1805, Murat informed Bagration that the armistice would end at 5:00 pm. The confused action took place during the night. After sustaining several French assaults and holding the position for six hours, Bagration was driven out and executed a skilled and organised withdrawal to retire northeast to join the main Russian army. His skillful defence in the face of superior forces successfully delayed the French enough for the Russian forces of Kutuzov and Buxhowden to unite at Brno (Brünn) on 18 November 1805.\nIn popular culture\nThe battle is depicted in Leo Tolstoy's novel War and Peace. Prince Andrei Bolkonsky is present and attaches himself to the artillery battery of Captain Tushin. As the battle progresses, the battery ends up alone and unsupported, becoming the deciding factor in the successful withdrawal of the Russian troops. Later that evening, some Russian staff officers accused Captain Tushin of abandoning his artillery pieces rather than retreating with the guns as ordered. Prince Andrei tells Bagration that there were no supporting Russian troops and that Captain Tushin and his men might have been vital in delaying the French advance.\nGiven the lack of detail in historical sources for this battle, it is unclear how closely Tolstoy's version of the battle relates to the historical action.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrXP6OzSt7c Russian Hussar Charge at the Battle of Schöngrabern in 1805 (War & Peace, 2016)], at Youtube\n*[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/listings/c_3rdcoalition.html Napoleon Series]\n*\n*\n*"
