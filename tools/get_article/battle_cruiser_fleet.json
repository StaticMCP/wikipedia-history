The name 'Fleet' remained until 1916 although it was officially subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet. The fleet initially contained the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battlecruiser Squadrons but this was reduced to the 1st and 2nd BC Squadrons in June 1916. It also included two light cruiser squadrons and two destroyer flotillas, in addition the new 5th Battle Squadron that included the new fast Queen Elizabeth-class battleships operated with the fleet. On 29 November 1916 it was renamed Battle Cruiser Force. The force was disbanded in April 1919.\nVice-Admirals commanding\nPost holders included:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! Rank !! Flag !! Name !!
