It had originally been planned to be held in late February or early March, but was brought forward after an agreement by the three party groups in the Assembly.\nIn the first two rounds, an absolute majority is required to be elected, and in the third round, a relative majority suffices; should two candidates be tied in the third round, the older one is declared elected.\nGaston Flosse was reelected with the support of the pro-independence Union for Democracy with 29 to 27 votes.\nReferences"
