In Hong Kong, declaring a monument requires consulting the Antiquities Advisory Board, the approval of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong as well as the publication of the notice on the Hong Kong Government Gazette.\nAs of December 2024, there are 136 declared monuments in Hong Kong, with 58 listed on Hong Kong Island, 55 on New Territories, 14 on Kowloon, and 9 on the Outlying Islands.\nUnder Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance, some other buildings are classified as Grades I, II and III historic buildings, and are not listed below.\nMonument declaration and historic buildings grading system\nThere was no direct link between graded buildings and monuments. As of July 2007, 607 buildings had been graded (since 1980), 54 of these, including five Grade I buildings, had been demolished. As of August 2007, of 151 buildings classified as Grade I, only 28 pre-war buildings have been declared monuments since 1980.\nOn 26 November 2008, the Antiquities Advisory Board announced that the declaration of monuments would be related to the grading of historic buildings.\nProposed monuments\nThe Antiquities Authority (the Secretary for Development) may declare a building facing a demolition risk a proposed monument, thus providing the building with immediate protection against demolition. A Declaration of \"proposed\" status is valid for twelve months and may be extended. However the affected owner may object to the \"proposed\" status. Five buildings were declared proposed monuments between 1982 and 2012: Ohel Leah Synagogue (later Grade I in 1990), Morrison Building (subsequently declared in 2004), Jessville (later Grade III), King Yin Lei (subsequently declared in 2008) and Ho Tung Gardens (later demolished in 2013). Hung Lau was declared a proposed monument on 9 March 2017, and subsequently retained its Grade I status.\nMonuments\nHong Kong Island\n| lat = 22.246203\n| lon = 114.248817\n}}\n| lat = 22.279729\n| lon = 114.156778\n}}\n| lat = 22.282186\n| lon = 114.192761\n}}\n| lat = 22.218311\n| lon = 114.213122\n}}\n| lat = 22.280996\n| lon = 114.160116\n}}\n| lat = 22.28416667\n| lon = 114.13777778\n}}\n| lat = 22.252539\n| lon = 114.174758\n}}\n| lat = 22.2785\n| lon = 114.1625\n}}\n| lat = 22.279375\n| lon = 114.15964167\n}}\n| lat = 22.264292\n| lon = 114.235535\n}}\n| lat = 22.274346\n| lon = 114.173286\n}}\n| lat = 22.283445\n| lon = 114.148626\n}}\n| lat = 22.287279\n| lon = 114.150377\n}}\n| lat = 22.283492\n| lon = 114.143859\n}}\n| lat = 22.277483\n| lon = 114.158491\n}}\n| lat = 22.27434\n| lon = 114.14572\n}}\n| lat = 22.281739\n| lon = 114.154197\n}}\n| lat = 22.281076\n| lon = 114.15452\n}}\n| lat = 22.280968\n| lon = 114.153998\n}}\n| lat = 22.263428\n| lon = 114.135178\n}}\n| lat = 22.284579\n| lon = 114.137849\n}}\n| lat = 22.283507\n| lon = 114.139997\n}}\n| lat = 22.27866389\n| lon = 114.15741667\n}}\n| lat = 22.27885\n| lon = 114.15955833\n}}\n| lat = 22.27666667\n| lon = 114.15861111\n}}\n| lat = 22.209042\n| lon = 114.259121\n}}\n| lat = 22.266725\n| lon = 114.18086389\n}}\n| lat = 22.283724\n| lon = 114.111281\n}}\n| lat = 22.26498\n| lon = 114.13727\n}}\n| lat = 22.26\n| lon = 114.21\n}}\n| lat = 22.256572\n| lon = 114.195326\n}}\n| lat = 22.256902\n| lon = 114.163247\n}}\n| lat = 22.283982\n| lon = 114.150239\n}}\n| lat = 22.282\n| lon = 114.151\n}}\n| lat = 22.21575556\n| lon = 114.21544444\n}}\n| lat = 22.28444444\n| lon = 114.14027778\n}}\n| lat = 22.281547\n| lon = 114.160622\n}}\n| lat = 22.262156\n| lon = 114.135342\n}}\n| lat = 22.279588\n| lon = 114.192949\n}}\n| lat = 22.244823\n| lon = 114.155901\n}}\n| lat = 22.272749\n| lon = 114.189965\n}}\n| lat = 22.284892\n| lon = 114.144081\n}}\n|}\nKowloon\n| lat = 22.302175\n| lon = 114.174162\n}}\n| lat = 22.337954\n| lon = 114.159987\n}}\n| lat = 22.293581\n| lon = 114.169551\n}}\n| lat = 22.301555\n| lon = 114.172164\n}}\n| lat = 22.295478\n| lon = 114.169994\n}}\n| lat = 22.331795\n| lon = 114.190828\n}}\n| lat = 22.332237\n| lon = 114.19045\n}}\n| lat = 22.327439\n| lon = 114.179246\n}}\n| lat = 22.314938\n| lon = 114.17191\n}}\n| lat = 22.332784\n| lon = 114.187463\n}}\n| lat = 22.296106\n| lon = 114.174475\n}}\n|}\nNew Territories\n| lat = 22.35972222\n| lon = 114.31416667\n}}\n| lat = 22.24916667\n| lon = 114.28972222\n}}\n| lat = 22.270835\n| lon = 114.290232\n}}\n| lat = 22.255082\n| lon = 114.296864\n}}\n| lat = 22.37205\n| lon = 114.12015\n}}\n| lat = 22.445706\n| lon = 114.170622\n}}\n| lat = 22.39246389\n| lon = 114.32168889\n}}\n| lat = 22.309969\n| lon = 114.298903\n}}\n| lat = 22.44589\n| lon = 114.178826\n}}\n| lat = 22.280382\n| lon = 114.267264\n}}\n| lat = 22.499787\n| lon = 114.074407\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.448960\n| lon = 114.164442\n}}\n| lat = 22.44759\n| lon = 114.16434\n}}\n| lat = 22.510449\n| lon = 114.124200\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.453630\n| lon = 113.993079\n}}\n| lat = 22.382855\n| lon = 114.197197\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.499016\n| lon = 114.149909\n}}\n| lat = 22.45435\n| lon = 114.02778\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.529135\n| lon = 114.17557\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.43216\n| lon = 114.01636\n}}\n| lat = 22.43694\n| lon = 114.164\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.44889167\n| lon = 114.00615556\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.39678\n| lon = 113.978479\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.38611111\n| lon = 114.14722222\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n|}\nOutlying Islands\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat = 22.19845\n| lon = 113.85128056\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n| lat =\n| lon =\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n* List of buildings and structures in Hong Kong\n* List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong\n* List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong\n* List of Grade III historic buildings in Hong Kong\n* Heritage Trails in Hong Kong\n* History of Hong Kong\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.amo.gov.hk/en/monuments.php Declared Monuments in Hong Kong on the Antiquities and Monuments Office website]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=znCLeiCoEY7I.kgY3Wfmyu64g Google Map with all locations]"
