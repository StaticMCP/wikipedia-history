Barr, a physicist from the University of Delaware  and frequent contributor to First Things. This book is \"an extended attack\" on what Barr calls scientific materialism.  National Review says of the book: \"[A] lucid and engaging survey of modern physics and its relation to religious belief. . . . Barr has produced a stunning tour de force . . . [a] scientific and philosophical breakthrough.\"\nContents\nThe book is divided into five parts spanning 26 chapters. The main religious and philosophical themes include determinism, mind as a machine, anthropic principle, and the Big Bang theory.\nIts main thesis is that science and religion only appear in conflict because many have \"conflated science with philosophical materialism.\"\nReviews\n* James F.
