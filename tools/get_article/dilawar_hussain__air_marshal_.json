Prior to his retirement, he served as the eighth Director General of the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.\nIn 1994, Dilawar and Vice Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal Shafique Haider were controversially superseded by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in favour of Abbas Khattak for the position of Chief of Air Staff. Khattak was later accused of receiving kickbacks from Mirage sales, along with Benazir's husband, Asif Ali Zardari.\nEarly life\nHussain was born at Quetta, one of the major cities of Pakistan in 1940. Completing his studies from the Government College in Quetta, he opted for the Pakistan Air Force.\nMilitary career\nHussain joined the Pakistan Air Force Academy in 1959. During his training, he was sent to United States for advanced training with United States Air Force. He flew various elite aircraft of the time, including the T-33, T-34, and T-37.

In the early hours of the war, the PAF conducted Pathankot airstrike, of which Hussain was a part. With only 8 F-86F, under the leadership of the then Squadron Leader Sajad Haider, No. 19 Sqn had destroyed at least 11 (some claims say 13 or 14) aircraft of Indian Air Force. Hussain flew an F-86F in this mission, which became PAF's most successful air raid. For Hussain's gallantry action, he was awarded Sitara-e-Jurat, Pakistan's third highest gallantry award.\n1971 War\nHussain was a part of the No. 14 Squadron PAF at Dacca during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. On 4 December 1971, Hussain flew the Canadair Sabre Mk6 and shot down the then Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Charles Tremenheere of No. 14 Squadron IAF. The victim was later taken as PoW. On 6 December, Hussain flew with a group of four F-86s to support Pakistani soldiers in the Comilla Sector near Dacca. During this mission, one of the officers under command of Hussain, Flying Officer Shamshad reportedly shot an IAF Hunter.\nPost war\nAfter participating in two major wars, Hussain remained in the Air Force. Later he commanded the No. 14 Squadron, which was later modernized with JF-17 Thunder.He held the appointment Director of Operations at the Air Headquarters.
