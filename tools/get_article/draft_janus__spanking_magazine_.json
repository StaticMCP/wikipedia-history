      "text": "# Draft:Janus (spanking magazine)\n\nJanus was a British fetish magazine specialising in spanking and caning imagery, founded by Gordon Sergeant, published from 1971 to 2007, the date of its last printed issue.\nThe magazine had its own shop on Old Compton Street. Francis Bacon attended its opening.\nIn the 1970s, the glamour photographer Harrison Marks joined the magazine. He also produced and directed short erotic corporal punishment films for Janus for the then-emerging home video market. One of these, ''Warden's End'' (1981), starring glamour model and pornographic actress Linzi Drew, shows the exterior and interior of Janus's London storefront office at 40 Old Compton Street. In 1982 Marks left the Janus stable to set up his own fetish magazine Kane which also featured caning and spanking photos.\nThe magazine featured illustrations by the fetish artist Paula Meadows, who also modeled for the magazine. Meadows later edited a spin-off spanking magazine.\nAccording to a biography of Felix Dennis, Janus was printed by Holders Press, situated in Lamb's Conduit Street.\nSergeant died in 2011, handing control of the magazine to his nephew. It now continues as an online magazine.\nReferences\n:wikidata:Q65428546"
