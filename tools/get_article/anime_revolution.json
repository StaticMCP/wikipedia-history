Initially held in the East Wing of the Vancouver Convention Centre (Canada Place), it has been held in the newer West Wing since 2017 before expanding eastward in Toronto's Metro Toronto Convention Centre starting in 2025.\nWhile the name is similar, the convention has no connection to Anime Evolution.\nProgramming\nAnime Revolution is notable for being the first anime convention in Vancouver to host voice actor guests from Japan and often features high-profile recording session performances. They also regularly bring in representatives from North American anime distributors such as Bandai and Crunchyroll. Their regular programming includes anime and AMV screenings, voice actor panels, as well as stage events including cosplay shows and the 70s Anime Dating Show.\nOther events have included contests, industry/fan panels, workshops, vendor and artist rooms, video game groups, concerts, raves/masquerades and photo shoots.\nMascot\nThe Mascot for Anime Revolution is Senkaku Mei, or Senmei for short. She is a blunt, spontaneous, energetic attention grabber who loves to be the center of attention. She can usually be found dressed in her race-queen outfit with her two mini megaphones. A live action version of Senmei was portrayed by cosplay model Jessica Nigri in 2013.\nHistory\nAnime Revolution was launched in 2012 to meet demand for a new anime-focused convention in Metro Vancouver, after Anime Evolution (run by AE Convention Corp) had been cancelled in 2010. Since it began, the convention has grown significantly, being the first anime convention in Metro Vancouver to surpass 10,000 attendees and eventually expanding its audience to more areas of Japanese pop culture such as gunpla and maid cafés.\nStarting in 2025, Anime Revolution began to expand in the east coast with the launch of Anime Revolution Toronto, commonly known as AniRevo Toronto which is expected to be held from November 21–23, 2025.\nEvent history\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
