South Willingham acted as a terminus until South Willingham Tunnel was completed. The line then opened to  on 27 September 1875, still goods traffic only.\nThe line was completed through to  for goods traffic on 6 August 1876 and opened to passengers on 1 December 1876. It was absorbed by the Great Northern Railway in 1882.\nThe station was located 133 miles 05 chains from London Kings Cross via ,  and Bardney. The branch was mostly single track and the station had only one platform. A signal box was located at Kingthorpe, to control the block, and the small goods yard. The yard had only one siding serving a cattle dock. There was no loop at Kingthorpe to allow trains to pass one another but connections to the siding allowed the train's engine to run round a few wagons. At the road entrance to the goods yard was a weighbridge  and office. The B1202 Wragby to Bardney road crossed the railway on an overbridge at the south end of the platform.\nThe station building included living accommodation for the Station Master and his family as well as a booking office and waiting room. Architecturally, the building was in the same style as others on the line; built of brick with a number of brick string courses of a contrasting colour. The number and appearance of the string courses differed on each station; at Kingthorpe, the general bricks were a darker colour with lighter string course bricks. The station building was on the bank of Stainfield beck, and as a result the beck bisected the platform. It was carried across the beck on a bridge; the beck was too large to culvert. The track crossed the beck on a waybeam bridge, which can be seen in the photograph.\nThe signal box was of timber construction and was at the north end of the platform.\nPassenger service\nWhen the line opened five passenger trains a day were provided, but this was quickly reduced to 4, with 5 on Fridays. At the start of the Second World War the service was suspended for three months. When it was reinstated in December 1939 the timetable was reduced to three trains in each direction and the 1950 timetable shows that this arrangement continued after the war until closure. Although originally intended to run to Lincoln, trains on the line only ran between Louth and Bardney; passengers had to change at Bardney to get to . Trains were timetabled to get to Bardney in 7 minutes, with a connection to Lincoln taking a further 25 minutes. In the other direction, trains took 7 minutes to get to  and 40 minutes to arrive in Louth (these are sample times and varied during the day and in the direction travelled).\nPassenger services ended on 5 November 1951, goods traffic on 15 September 1956. However, the track through the station remained open for a further three years until 1 February 1960 to serve Wragby goods yard. The signal box was reduced to a ground frame in the locking room (the room under the signal box) sometime after closure to passengers and before 1953.\nAfter Closure\nThe track was lifted in 1961. The station building was demolished and no trace remains. The bridge carrying the B1202 was demolished and the road realigned sometime between 2010 and 2019.\nRoute\n}}\nReferences"
