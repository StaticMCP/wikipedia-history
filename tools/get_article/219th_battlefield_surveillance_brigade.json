The United States Army planned for the creation and transformation of nine intelligence brigades to a 'Battlefield Surveillance' role in 2007. The first Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB) was deployed the same year conducting Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence operations. However, gathering information is only half the challenge it faced. Along with the structural changes and intelligence capabilities, the sustainment capabilities of the brigade also changed.[2] The United States Army reorganized it’s intelligence formations into Battlefield Surveillance Brigades (BfSB). The brigades were self-sufficient Army Modular Forces. Army doctrine changed the name of the BfSB to Reconnaissance and Surveillance Brigade in 2011. In 2016, the 219th BfSB was redesignated to the 219th Engineer Brigade.\nThe 219th BfSB was composed of:\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) (Franklin, Indiana)\n** Commander: COL David Vesper\n** Command Sergeant Major: CSM Christopher Knies\n*  2nd Battalion, 151st Infantry Regiment – South Bend, IN (Transferring to the 76th IBCT, INARNG, effective 1 October 2013)\n** Company A – Hammond, IN (Light Infantry)\n** Company B – Logansport, IN (Light Infantry)\n** Company C – Hartford City, IN (Light Infantry)\n** Company D – Frankfort, IN (Heavy Weapons)\nDuring deployment to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2009-2010, Bco, 2nd Bn, 151st Inf received both the Meritorious Unit Citation and Valorous Unit Award, along with other combat awards and decorations while executing combat operations that included reconnaissance/surveillance operations, convoy security patrols, and quick reaction force (QRF) duties as part of Task Force Yukon (4th BCT (Airborne)) and Task Force Rakkasan (3d Bde, 101st Airborne Division) for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Khost province.\n*  2nd Squadron, 152nd Cavalry Regiment (Reconnaissance & Surveillance) – Columbus, IN\n** Troop A – Bluffton, IN Light Cavalry\n** Troop B – Bluffton, IN Light Cavalry\n** Troop C – Seymour, IN Long Range Surveillance (Airborne) [http://www.ranger151.com/ \"Indiana Rangers\"]\nTroop C, 2-152 CAV used to be known as Company D (Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol), 151st Infantry; Company D (Ranger), 151st Infantry; and 151st Infantry Detachment (Long Range Surveillance).

The unit was designated as Troop C (LRS), 2nd Squadron, 152nd Cavalry Regiment of the 219th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade and in 2016, was redesignated as Company D, 2d Battalion, 151st Infantry Regiment, 76th Brigade Combat Team. As an LRS troop, this elite unit was affiliated with the US Army's 75th Ranger Regiment as per their full membership within the [http://www.75thrra.com/units/d151.html 75th Ranger Regiment Association]. The Indiana Rangers originated as an elite 19th-century mounted militia force.\nPersonnel from the former Troop C (LRS), 2d Squadron, 152d Cavalry Regiment were used to form the new Company C, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 134th Infantry Regiment.
