He was Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Fine Arts at New York University.\nEarly life and education\nBrown was born on July 15, 1939, in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Leonard M. Brown, an insurance agent and Jean Brown, a librarian and art collector who was particularly intrigued by the Fluxus movement. He studied Spanish literature at Dartmouth College and spent a year abroad in Madrid. While in Spain, he became fascinated with the painter Diego Velázquez, which inspired a lifelong interest in Spanish art. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1960 and continued on to Princeton University, where he received his PhD in 1964 with a dissertation titled \"Painting in Seville from Pacheco to Murillo: A Study of Artistic Transition.\"\nAcademic career\nBrown began his teaching career at Princeton in 1965. The same year, Brown was promoted to associate professor. In 1972, he received the Arthur Kingsley Porter Prize of the College Art Association of America for an article the Art Bulletin about works of art in the Church of the Hermandad de la Caridad in Seville. The following year, Brown was appointed director of the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA), New York University's graduate program in art history. He was named full professor in 1977. At the IFA, Brown promoted the study of Spanish art, a relatively neglected field in the American academy. During the last two decades of his career, he expanded his interests to viceregal Latin American art, particularly the painting of New Spain.\nCuration\nBrown curated and co-curated a number of exhibitions throughout his career.  While a faculty member at Princeton, he organized \"Jusepe de Ribera: Prints and Drawings\" at the university's museum, which featured several Spanish drawings from its collection. He continued to organize shows focusing on Spanish drawings, including 1976's Murillo & His Drawings, also held at the Princeton University Art Museum, and \"The Spanish Manner: Drawings from Ribera to Goya,\" held at The Frick Collection in 2010. Brown had a long association with The Frick Collection, co-curating several shows at the institution, including ''Goya's Last Works'' in 2006. In his review of the exhibition, Andrew Schulz commented that: \"Brown and [his co-curator Susan Grace] Galassi did a marvelous job of assembling works from public and private collections in North America and Spain that covered the full range of [Goya's] late production: portraits in oil, ivory miniatures, black crayon drawings, and lithographs.\" Schulz concludes: \"Their landmark exhibition and catalogue will provide the point of departure as we continue to gain insights into the last works of this singular artist.\" Reflecting his later interest in the art of the Spanish viceroyalties, Brown organized the 2010–2011 traveling exhibition \"Pintura de los reinos. Identidades compartidas en el mundo hispánico\" on view at the Museo Nacional del Prado and Palacio Real in Madrid and the Palacio de Iturrbide in Mexico City. In 2013, he co-curated \"La Mexique au Louvre: Chefs-d'œuvrede la Nouvelle Espagne\" with Guillaume Kientz.\nPersonal life and death\nBrown died at his home in Princeton on January 17, 2022, at the age of 82.\nAwards and honors\nSlade Professor of Fine Art, Oxford University, 1981\nComendador de la Orden de Isabel la Católica, 1986\nMedalla de Oro de Bellas Artes (Spain), 1986\nAmerican Philosophical Society, 1988\nAndrew W.
