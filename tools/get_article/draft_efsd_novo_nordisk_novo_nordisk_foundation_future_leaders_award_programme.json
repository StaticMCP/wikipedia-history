Launched in 2018, the programme aims to support emerging researchers in diabetes by providing long-term funding to facilitate their transition to independent research careers.\nOverview\nEach year, the programme awards up to four grants, each valued at up to DKK 5 million (approximately €670,000) over a five-year period. These grants are intended to support various aspects of the recipients' research activities, including project costs and salaries. The total annual funding allocated through the programme amounts to DKK 20 million.\nThe primary objective of the programme is to support early-career scientists and clinicians in diabetes research by providing funding for independent research projects related to the understanding, prevention, or treatment of diabetes.\nEligibility and Selection\nApplicants must be at an intermediate stage of their research careers, typically having completed their most recent degree (PhD or MD) within 7 to 12 years prior to the application deadline. Candidates are required to document experience in diabetes research through publications, prior research funding, and other academic activities.\nEligibility may be extended in cases of documented career interruptions, such as parental leave, illness, or clinical training. Applicants must be affiliated with a university, hospital, or other non-profit research institution in Europe and must be members of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Applications are reviewed by a committee appointed by the EFSD. The committee assesses submissions based on the scientific quality of the proposed research, the applicant's qualifications, and the relevance of the project to diabetes research.\nProgramme Activities\nAward recipients are required to participate in activities related to diabetes research and education. These activities include giving presentations at the EFSD/Novo Nordisk Foundation Future Leaders Symposium, taking part in EASD Young Academy initiatives, contributing to postgraduate education, and participating in public outreach related to diabetes research.\nPrize Recipients\nBelow is the historical list of recipients for the EFSD/Novo Nordisk Foundation Future Leaders Award Programme:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Person\n!Institution\n|-\n|2024\n|Jakob Knudsen\n|University of Copenhagen - Denmark\n|-\n|2024\n|Jordi Merino\n|University of Copenhagen - Denmark\n|-\n|2024\n|Lykke Sylow\n|University of Copenhagen - Denmark\n|-\n|2024\n|Shane Wright\n|Karolinska Institute - Sweden\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|Roel Bijkerk\n|Leiden University Medical Center - Netherlands\n|-\n|2023\n|Charlotte Boughton\n|University of Cambridge - United Kingdom\n|-\n|2023\n|Elisa De Franco\n|University of Exeter - United Kingdom\n|-\n|2023\n|Maria Rohm\n|Helmholtz Centre Munich - Germany\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Alexander Jais\n|Helmholtz Centre Munich - Germany\n|-\n|2022\n|Niklas Mejhert\n|Karolinska Institute - Sweden\n|-\n|2022\n|Soren Fisker Schmidt\n|University of Southern Denmark - Denmark\n|-\n|2022\n|Zhichao Zhou\n|Karolinska Institute - Sweden\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|Alice Adriaenssens\n|University of Cambridge - United Kingdom\n|-\n|2021\n|Rongrong Fan\n|Karolinska Institute - Sweden\n|-\n|2021\n|Nicolas Pillon\n|Karolinska Institute - Sweden\n|-\n|2021\n|Nicolai Wewer Albrechtsen\n|University of Copenhagen - Denmark\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Florian Kahles\n|University Hospital Aachen - Germany\n|-\n|2020\n|Natalie Krahmer\n|Helmholtz Diabetes Center - Germany\n|-\n|2020\n|Mitsugu Shimobayashi\n|KU Leuven - Belgium\n|-\n|2020\n|Michaela Tencerova\n|Institute of Physiology - Czech Republic\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Claire Meek\n|University of Cambridge - United Kingdom\n|-\n|2019\n|Trine Moholdt\n|Norwegian University of Science - Norway\n|-\n|2019\n|Atul Shahaji Deshmukh\n|University of Copenhagen - Denmark\n|}\nReferences"
