The memorial was unveiled in 1979 during The Troubles, as a dedication to the Provisional Irish Republican Army.\nHistory\nDuring The Troubles, Crossmaglen and the South Armagh region were nicknamed \"Bandit Country\" by the British Army, due to the overwhelming support for the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The British Army established a base in the town, and in response, the Republican residents installed a Republican Memorial in the centre of the village, in Cardinal O'Fiaich Square.\nThe sculpture was designed by Yann Renard-Goulet (1914–1999), a native of Brittany. The pedestal features a phrase that is repeated in both English and Irish:\n}}\n}}\nReferences"
