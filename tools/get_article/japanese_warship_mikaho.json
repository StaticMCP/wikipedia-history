He left Shinagawa on August 20, 1868, with the four steam warships (Kaiyō, Kaiten, Banryū, Chiyodagata) and four steam transports (Kanrin, Mikaho, Shinsoku, Chōgei). The ship had 2,000 members of the Navy, 36 members of the \"Yugekitai\" (reaction force) headed by Iba Hachiro, several officials of the former Bakufu government such as the vice-commander in chief of the Army Matsudaira Taro, Nakajima Saburosuke, and members of the French Military Mission to Japan, headed by Jules Brunet.\nOn August 21, the fleet encountered a typhoon off Choshi, in which the Mikaho was lost and the Kanrin, heavily damaged, forced to rally the coast, where she was captured in Shimizu.\nOne of her captains was Tadaemon Aoki.\nReferences"
