It is located in Faisalabad, Punjab. Along with the Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the NIAB reports directly to the Islamabad-based PAEC Biological Science Directorate. The current director is Dr. Muhammad Hamed.\nHistory\nThe NIAB was established by Ishrat Hussain Usmani when PAEC established its first Biological Science Directorate in 1965. In 1967, with the efforts led by Dr. Abdus Salam, the Government of Pakistan approved a project, and the PAEC began its construction. The operations and research began in 1970, and it was officially inaugurated by Munir Ahmad Khan, then Chairman of the PAEC, on 6 April 1972. Khan later developed the institute and led the research activities in the institution. The nuclear medical research was also put under Khan, and NIAB had developed 23 different crop varieties that are high yielding, disease resistant and are being cultivated throughout the country.\nAt first, the institute's mandate was to create and maintain new genetic material for sustained agriculture development and to conduct research on applied problems in the field of agriculture and biology using nuclear and other related techniques.\nFacilities\nThe institute currently operates 60Co irradiation sources, gas chromatographs, a photo-documentation system, and atomic absorption.\nResearch and Achievements\nNIAB's research focuses on the development of high-yielding and disease-resistant crop varieties, soil fertility improvement, water management, and food preservation through irradiation. The institute has made significant contributions to enhancing agricultural productivity and food security in Pakistan.\nCollaborations\nNIAB collaborates with various national and international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to enhance its research capabilities and stay updated with global advancements in agricultural biotechnology.\nSee also\n* Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission\n* Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture\n* International Atomic Energy Agency\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.niab.org.pk/index.htm Official website]"
