A varied cast of presenters included Merrick and Rosso (who opened the televised show), stand-up comic Dave Hughes, Gretel Killeen, David Hasselhoff, and Hamish & Andy.\nOn 14 July 2005 ARIA sought to create a separate standalone 'ARIA Icons: Hall of Fame' event as only one or two acts could be inducted under the old format due to time restrictions. Six acts were inducted into the Hall of Fame in July with an additional act inducted at the following ARIA Music Awards in October.\nAwards\nWinners are highlighted in bold, other final nominees are in plain.\nARIA Awards\n*Album of the Year\n**Missy Higgins – The Sound of White\n***Ben Lee – Awake Is the New Sleep\n***Evermore – Dreams\n***Keith Urban – Be Here\n***Sarah Blasko – The Overture & the Underscore\n*Single of the Year\n**Ben Lee – \"Catch My Disease\"\n***Evermore – \"For One Day\"\n***Missy Higgins – \"The Special Two\"\n***Thirsty Merc – \"Someday, Someday\"\n***Wolfmother – \"Woman\"\n*Best Male Artist\n**Ben Lee – Awake Is the New Sleep\n***John Butler – \"Something's Gotta Give\"\n***Keith Urban – Be Here\n***Lior – Autumn Flow\n***Paul Kelly – Foggy Highway\n*Best Female Artist\n**Missy Higgins – The Sound of White\n***Kylie Minogue – \"I Believe in You\"\n***Mia Dyson – Parking Lots\n***Natalie Imbruglia – Counting Down the Days\n***Sarah Blasko – The Overture & the Underscore\n*Best Group\n**Eskimo Joe – \"Older Than You\"\n***Evermore – Dreams\n***Grinspoon – Thrills, Kills & Sunday Pills\n***Powderfinger – These Days\n***Thirsty Merc – \"Someday, Someday\"\n*Highest-Selling Album\n**Missy Higgins – The Sound of White\n***Anthony Callea – Anthony Callea\n***Casey Donovan – For You\n***Delta Goodrem – Mistaken Identity\n***Guy Sebastian – Beautiful Life\n*Highest-Selling Single\n**Anthony Callea – \"The Prayer\"\n***Anthony Callea – \"Rain\" / \"Bridge over Troubled Water\"\n***Casey Donovan – \"Listen with Your Heart\"\n***Delta Goodrem & Brian McFadden – \"Almost Here\"\n***Missy Higgins – \"The Special Two\"\n*Breakthrough Artist – Album\n**Missy Higgins – The Sound of White\n***Evermore – Dreams\n***Lior – Autumn Flow\n***Little Birdy – BigBigLove\n***Sarah Blasko – The Overture & the Underscore\n*Breakthrough Artist – Single\n**End of Fashion – \"O Yeah\"\n***Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets – \"These Kids\"\n***Kisschasy – \"Do-Do's & Whoa-Oh's\"\n***The Veronicas – \"4ever\"\n***Wolfmother – \"Woman\"\n*Best Adult Contemporary Album\n**The Go-Betweens – Oceans Apart\n***Architecture in Helsinki – In Case We Die\n***John Farnham & Tom Jones – Together in Concert\n***Renée Geyer – Tonight\n***The Church – El Momento Descuidado\n*Best Blues & Roots Album\n**Mia Dyson – Parking Lots\n***Ash Grunwald – Live at the Corner\n***The Beautiful Girls – ''We're Already Gone\n***Jeff Lang – You Have to Dig Deep to Bury Daddy\n***The Waifs – A Brief History...''\n*Best Children's Album\n**The Wiggles – Live: Hot Potatoes\n***Bananas in Pyjamas – Sing and Be Happy\n***Hi-5 – Making Music\n***Sean O'Boyle – Hush Little Baby\n***The Hooley Dooleys – Super Dooper\n*Best Comedy Release\n**Tripod – Middleborough Rd\n***Jimeoin – Third Drawer Down\n***Rodney Rude – Twice As Rude\n***Shane Dundas & Dave Collins – The Umbilical Brothers\n***Various Artists – Classic Skithouse\n*Best Country Album\n**Keith Urban – Be Here\n***Adam Harvey – ''Can't Settle For Less\n***Audrey Auld-Mezera – Texas\n***Paul Kelly & the Stormwater Boys – Foggy Highway\n***Sara Storer – Firefly\n*Best Dance Release\n**Infusion – Six Feet Above Yesterday\n***Bodyrockers – \"I Like the Way\"\n***Deepface – \"Been Good\"\n***Dirty South – \"Sleazy\"\n***Rogue Traders – \"Voodoo Child\"\n*Best Independent Release\n**Ben Lee – Awake Is the New Sleep\n***Architecture in Helsinki – In Case We Die\n***Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets – Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets\n***Lior – Autumn Flow\n***The Waifs – A Brief History...\n*Best Music DVD\n**Jet – Right!

Members of the academy are kept secret. Membership is by invitation only. An individual record company may have up to eight members on the academy. The only artists eligible to vote are winners and nominees from the previous year's awards. (See pie chart at right.)\nSee also\n*Music of Australia\n*Rock music in Australia\nReferences"
