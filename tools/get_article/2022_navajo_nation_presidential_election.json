The primary election was held on August 2. Incumbent president Jonathan Nez ran for reelection with attorney Chad Abeyta as his running mate. Incumbent Vice President Myron Lizer did not seek re-election, instead running for U.S. House in Arizona. Nez and Abeyta advanced to the general election, as did the challenging ticket of construction manager Buu Nygren and Torreon/Star Lake Chapter President Richelle Montoya. Nygren and Montoya won the general election by a 6-point margin, and Montoya became the Navajo Nation's first female vice president.\nCandidates\nAdvanced to general election\n*Jonathan Nez, incumbent president (party affiliation: Democratic)\n**Chad Abeyta, attorney for the Navajo Nation Office of Legislative Counsel\n*Buu Nygren, former Navajo Engineering and Construction Authority chief commercial officer, husband of Arizona state representative Jasmine Blackwater-Nygren, and candidate for vice president in 2018 (party affiliation: Democratic)\n**Richelle Montoya, president of the Torreon/Star Lake Chapter\nEliminated in primary\n*Dineh Benally, former member of the San Juan Chapter Farm Board and candidate for president in 2018\n*Greg Bigman, chair of the Diné College Board of Regents\n*Ethel Branch, former attorney general of the Navajo Nation (2015–2019)\n*Kevin Cody, tribal employee, environmental science student, and candidate for president in 2018\n*Frankie Davis, activist and granddaughter of former Navajo Nation Councillor Mescalito Nelson\n*Frank Dayish, former vice president of the Navajo Nation (2003–2007)\n*Emily Ellison, family shelter director and candidate for president in 2018\n*Sandra Jeff, former New Mexico state representative (2009–2015) (party affiliation: Libertarian)\n*Justin Jones, attorney\n*Rosanna Jumbo-Fitch, president of the Chinle Chapter\n*Dolly Manson, educator\n*Earl Sombrero, Ts'ah Bii' Kin Chapter manager\n*Leslie Tsosie, scholar}}\nGeneral election\n}}\nReferences"
