It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlottetown.\nHistory\nCatholic ministry in the Souris area is recorded in the 19th century; the parish is commonly dated to 1839 within the Diocese of Charlottetown. An earlier church and rectory were destroyed by fire in 1849.\nAs the parish grew around 1900, a large cruciform church of Island sandstone was built on Longworth Street and completed in the early 20th century. The Canadian Register of Historic Places describes it as a Gothic Revival church noted for its size, materials, and prominence in the town.\nIn March 1929, a fire destroyed the interior and left only the sandstone walls standing. The parish rebuilt quickly, and the church was reopened and blessed on 7 September 1930. Records of the period note that Charlottetown architect John Marshall Hunter oversaw the restoration work during 1929–30.\nArchitecture\nSt. Mary’s is a Gothic Revival church with a cruciform plan, a front tower-porch, pointed-arch windows, and steep gables. The exterior is built of Island sandstone, and the interior is finished in wood.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=19171 Canadian Register of Historic Places entry – ''St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church'' (CRHP ID 19171)]\n* [https://dioceseofcharlottetown.com/wp-content/themes/standard/inc/parish_details.php?id=40 Diocese of Charlottetown – parish listing for St. Mary’s (Souris)]"
