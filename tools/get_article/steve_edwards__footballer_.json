He signed professional terms in 1976, and captained both the youth and reserve teams before making his league debut at Mansfield Town in April 1978. Originally a midfield player, by then he was largely playing as a defender. In spite of some reasonably long first team spells over the next four seasons he found himself constantly facing strong competition for the full back place, and after a total of 85 appearances in League and Cup Competitions he was transferred to Crewe Alexandra in February 1983.\nHe made a good start to his career at Crewe, but moved on for a brief stay at Rochdale in July 1984.\nIn October of the same year, he moved back to his home town, when he joined Tranmere Rovers for what were probably his most successful three seasons, completing 72 league matches and scoring 6 goals.\nHe signed for Mossley from  Bangor City in March 1990 but moved to Vauxhall Motors for the following season.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
