Voters chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nMichigan voted for the Democratic candidate, Franklin Pierce, over Whig candidate Winfield Scott and Free Soil candidate John P. Hale. Pierce won Michigan by a margin of 9.62%.\n, this is the last and only time Sanilac County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate. It would also be the last time until 1964 that Allegan County, Hillsdale County and Lapeer County would support a Democratic presidential candidate. This was also the last time Michigan sent a full slate (or even a majority) of Democratic electors to the Electoral College until Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, although it did send five Grover Cleveland electors in 1892.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Michigan\nReferences"
