Whether dressing working-class Marylanders of the 1960s, amateur criminals of the 1970s, or West African immigrants in today’s Harlem, Ayite has a knack for conveying characters’ means, values, and aspirations before the actors utter a word.\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\"\n| Heather Christian\n|-\n| With the category-defying Oratorio for Living Things, Heather Christian aims to encompass all human existence in a single inventive and startlingly beautiful work. In times of pandemic, war, and social upheaval, Christian’s work (directed by Lee Sunday Evans and brought to life by a superb cast and creative team) is an awe-inspiring reminder that, even in the darkest times, there will always be artistic peaks to scale.\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\"| 2023\n| No award presented.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\"| 2024\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\"\n| ''How to Dance in Ohio's Authentic Autism Access Team'\n|-\n| Sammi Cannold, Nicole D'Angelo, Becky Leifman, Ava Xiao-Lin Rigelhaupt, Liz Weber, and Jeremy Wein – for their steadfast support of autistic theatermakers, and their strides toward true accessibility for neurodiverse individuals both on and offstage.\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\"\n| Isabella Byrd\n|-\n| During this season, Byrd illuminated two Broadway shows done in the round, An Enemy of the People and Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club. Off Broadway, her spotlight on quiet, small-scale stories both enchanted us in Primary Trust and mesmerized us in Infinite Life, with a parking-lot sky that marked the passage of time.\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"9\"| 2025\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\"\n| Ensemble of Liberation\n|-\n|The ensemble of Roundabout Theatre Company's  Liberation (Betsy Aidem, Audrey Corsa, Kayla Davion, Susannah Flood, Kristolyn Lloyd, Irene Sofia Lucio, Charlie Thurston, and Adina Verson) for bringing to vibrant life the specific and universal stories of women staring across the social battle lines of the 1970s from their perch \"somewhere in Ohio\" in Bess Wohl's beautiful new play.\n|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\"\n| Pregones/Puerto Rican Traveling Theater\n|\n|-\n|Pregones (founded in 1979) and the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater (founded in 1967) merged in 2014 to become a powerhouse producer of Latinx shows on two NYC stages: one in Manhattan's Theater District, the other in the South Bronx, both evoking an atmosphere of warmth and inclusivity. This season brought the blazing world premiere of Matthew Barbot’s the beautiful land i seek (la linda tierra que busco yo), a history-inspired fantasia about two Puerto Rican freedom fighters that deftly explores colonialism while riffing on Waiting for Godot, plus dozens of one-offs showcasing Latinx artists and culture.\n|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\"\n| Stacey Derosier\n|\n|-\n|For her deeply intimate and consistently gorgeous work across this season’s Off-Broadway stages. Whether lighting the minimalist theatricality of The Welkin and Grangeville, or the rich naturalism of The Counter and Danger and Opportunity, Derosier shows us not only that less is often so much more, but also that just a single light can have such a profound impact in the darkness.\n|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\"\n| Danger and Opportunity\n|\n|-\n|The team behind Danger and Opportunity – playwright Ken Urban, director Jack Serio, and ensemble Juan Castano, Julia Chan, and Ryan Spahn – for their genuinely serious, deeply moving consideration of the messy implications of a three-way relationship, done in an imaginatively immersive way that made such a small-scale story feel like a meaningful event.\n|}\nSee also\n* Society of London Theatre Special Award\n* Special Tony Award\nReferences\nExternal links"
