It is located in the former United States Post Office building, a handsome Colonial Revival structure built in 1940 with funding from a Depression-era works program.  The building was used as a post office until 1986.  The city acquired the building in 2000, and leased it to the local historical society, which has used it as a museum since.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Cleveland County, North Carolina\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kingsmountainmuseum.org/ Kings Mountain Historical Museum] - official site"
