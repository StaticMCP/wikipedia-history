At the end of the civil war, the Federalization Law was signed in this building. Due to this event, it was declared a National Historic Monument.\nIn 1938, at the 50th anniversary of Sarmiento's death, the federal government dedicated it as a museum. On 28 July of that year, the mansion was dedicated by presidential decree of then president Roberto Marcelino Ortiz, after a proposal of then head of the Historical Museums Commission Ricardo Levene.\nThe Sarmiento Museum was declared National Historic Monument of Argentina.\nThe collection\nThe museum displays some of Sarmiento's belongings, as established by Law #12556.
