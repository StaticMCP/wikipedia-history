It is located in the municipality of Zwartewaterland, at the mouth of the Zwarte Water river and the .\nHistory\nWillem and Joan Blaeu's \"Toonneel der Steden\"]]\nZwartsluis's history started in the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648): it developed around the Swartersluys fortress, which controlled traffic on the Zwartewater inlet leading to Hasselt and Zwolle. Zwartsluis attracted some trade and a fishing fleet in later centuries. Zwartsluis also served as a consolidation point for the peat-fuel trade, but was surpassed in importance by its neighbours, especially downstream Genemuiden.\nThe Dutch Reformed Church of Zwartsluis is a historic Dutch Reformed church building located on the Kerkstraat and the organ in the church is a designated Rijksmonument.\nRecreation\nThe town is home to many recreational boats, as well as a heritage fleet of fishing and cargo vessels. The Arembergergracht canal links the town with the Beulaker and Belter lakes and a multitude of smaller bodies of water just north, created by peat digging.\nGovernment\nZwartsluis was a separate municipality until 2001, when it became a part of Zwartewaterland.\nNotable people\n* Stieneke van der Graaf (born 1984), politician (MP)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
