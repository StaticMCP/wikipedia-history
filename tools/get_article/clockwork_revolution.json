The game is scheduled to be released for Windows and Xbox Series X/S.\nGameplay\nClockwork Revolution is an action role-playing game played from a first-person perspective. It features time-bending combat, roleplaying systems, and character creation.\nPlayers will be using the Chronometer, a time-traveling apparatus. This allows players to travel back in time, choose how to influence the past, and then return to the present to experience the effects of your decisions. Furthermore, the gameplay scenes in the teaser feature first-person shooting with a range of muskets and other, more sophisticated but functionally similar weapons. The Chronometer will allow players to travel into the past and make choices that could change the entire world. Weapons in Clockwork Revolution are mix of steampunk technology and late 19th-century firearms, including revolvers, lever-action repeaters, and modified Gatling guns.\nPlot\nSteampunk Victorian era metropolis Avalon serves as the main setting for Clockwork Revolution. In the city, affluent manufacturers replace their missing limbs with elaborate clockwork prosthetics, and mechanical slaves attend to their masters' every need.  But the sources of these technological advances are sinister: Lady Ironwood uses time travel to alter events in Avalon's past in order to maintain the social hierarchy that benefits her and her fellow upper-class residents. The game also explores political themes, suggesting the presence of different factions and ideologies that players can align with.\nDevelopment and release\nClockwork Revolution is InXile Entertainment's first AAA game under Xbox Game Studios. It is also their biggest game in terms of scope and budget. The game was first announced at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 12, 2023. It is an action RPG headed up by Chad Moore as game director and Jason Anderson as principal designer.\nOn January 30, 2024, InXile Entertainment announced that they are partnering with the newly founded video game studio Shapeshifter Games to develop Clockwork Revolution. Shapeshifter Games, a studio founded by former Volition developers, will offer co-development support for Clockwork Revolution.\nAt the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025, a 5 minute trailer was released showcasing gameplay and a closer look at the game's story and characters. The game is set to be released for Windows and Xbox Series X/S, and will be available on Xbox Game Pass upon launch.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
