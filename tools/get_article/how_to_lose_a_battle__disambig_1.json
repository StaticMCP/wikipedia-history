If we hope to make the right decisions about Iraq, we must understand why some battles are lost when they might have been won. Fawcett excels in offering the reader an understanding of these historical debacles.\"\nThe Historical Novel Society did not give the book a favorable review, noting several errors and pointing out that the book is a collection of essays by authors of unknown reputation.\nReferences"
