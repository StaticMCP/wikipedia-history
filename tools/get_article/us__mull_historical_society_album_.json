It includes the singles \"The Final Arrears\" and \"Am I Wrong\". Us (2003) received generally positive reviews; NME called it \"a joyous slice of orchestral prozac\". The track \"The Supermarket Strikes Back\" is a riposte to \"Barcode Bypass\" from Loss. After the album was released the record label, Warners, dropped the band.\nTrack listing\n#\"The Final Arrears\"  – 5:02\n#\"Am I Wrong\"  – 3:29\n#\"Oh Mother\"  – 3:05\n#\"Asylum\"  – 4:38\n#\"Live Like the Automatics\"  – 4:09\n#\"Don't Take Your Love Away from Me\"  – 3:52\n#\"Minister for Genetics & Insurance M.P.\"  – 5:25\n#\"5 More Minutes\"  – 3:32\n#\"Gravity\"  – 4:04\n#\"Can\"  – 3:42\n#\"The Supermarket Strikes Back\"  – 4:23\n#\"Clones\"  – 4:33\n#\"Her Is You\"  – 1:58\n#\"Us/Whiting of the People\"  – 7:38\n#\"Can’t Do It (CD Rom track)\"\n#\"You Asked Her to Marry You (CD Rom track)\"\n#\"MHS Lady (CD Rom track)\"\n#\"When I’m Awake (Cavum) (CD Rom track)\"\nReferences"
