Directed by Duwayne Dunham in his feature film directorial debut and featuring the voice talent of Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and Don Ameche, it was released on February 3, 1993. It grossed $57 million worldwide and was followed in 1996 by the sequel Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco. This film is dedicated to producer Franklin R. Levy, who died during production of the film, and Ben Ami Agmon, and it also marked the final film released during Don Ameche's lifetime.\nPlot\nChance, an immature American Bulldog and the narrator of the film, explains that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford, but expresses no interest in his owner or being part of a family. He shares his home with Shadow, a wise old Golden Retriever owned by Jamie's brother Peter, and Sassy, a pampered Himalayan cat owned by Peter and Jamie's sister Hope. That morning, the children's mother, Laura Burnford, marries Bob Seaver, and Chance causes trouble by devouring the wedding cake in front of all the guests.\nShortly after the wedding, the family has to temporarily move to San Francisco because Bob must relocate there for his job. They leave the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate, Laura's college friend. Shadow and Sassy miss their owners immediately, but Chance sees it as an opportunity to relax and be free. Later in the week, Kate goes on a cattle drive, leaving the animals to be looked after by her neighbor Frank. However, half of her message to him is lost, leading him to believe that she has taken them along, leaving the animals alone. Unsure about the disappearance of their host, the animals fear they have been abandoned. Shadow, refusing to think that his boy would abandon him, decides to make his way home. Not wanting to be left alone on the ranch, Chance and Sassy decide to accompany Shadow on his journey.\nThey head into the rocky, mountainous wilderness of the Sierra Nevada with Shadow leading. After a night spent in fear of the woodland noises, the group stops to catch breakfast at a river. However, two black bear cubs interrupt Chance and a large brown bear causes the group to retreat. At another river, Sassy refuses to swim across to follow the dogs and instead tries to cross via a wooden path farther downstream; halfway across, the wood breaks and she falls into the river. Shadow tries to save her, but she goes over a waterfall to her apparent death. Guilt-ridden, Shadow and Chance go on without her. Unknown to them, Sassy survives and is later found on the riverbank by an old man named Quentin, who nurses her back to health.\nOver the next two days, Shadow and Chance try unsuccessfully to catch food and encounter a mountain lion, which chases them to the edge of a cliff. Shadow gets an idea to use rocks positioned like a seesaw as a way to outsmart the mountain lion. While Shadow acts as bait, Chance pounces onto the end of the rock and sends the mountain lion over the cliff and into a river. Sassy hears the dogs barking in celebration and follows the sound to rejoin them.\nMeanwhile, Kate returns home to her farm; Frank confronts her about the note she left him, and she tells him that she didn't bring the animals. She contacts a forest ranger and then informs Bob that the animals are lost in the woods. The family grieves their loss, and Peter quarrels with his stepfather over whether or not they should search for them, believing that Bob wanted him to abandon Shadow. Peter tries unsuccessfully to enlist the help of the police, while their spat inspires Bob to send flyers to park rangers in hopes of relocating the animals.\nThe animals continue on their way, but Chance begins harassing a porcupine, ending up with a load of quills in his muzzle. They then encounter a missing little girl named Molly, and following their loyalty instincts they stand guard over her during the night. In the morning, Shadow finds a rescue party and leads them back to the girl. Two forest rangers recognize them from one of the flyers, and take them to the local animal shelter, where the medical staff remove the quills from Chance's muzzle. However, believing it to be an animal pound, the trio panic and Sassy escapes, later returning to free Shadow. Together, they retrieve Chance and escape the shelter, unaware that their owners are on their way to reclaim them.\nFinally reaching their hometown, the animals cross through a train yard, where Shadow falls into a muddy pit and injures his leg. He despondently tells the others to go on without him, but a heartbroken Chance insists he will not let the older dog give up. Near dusk, Chance and Sassy finally make it home and are happily reunited with their owners. Shadow eventually limps into view behind them, rejuvenated by his reunion with Peter. The film ends with Chance musing about the lessons he's learned, and his new appreciation for his family, before happily running into the house at the smell of food.\nCast\n*David MacIntyre as Foote\n*Caroll Spinney as Dog in Pound\n*Rattler as Chance\n**Michael J.
