The election was conducted on the basis of a simple majority or first-past-the-post voting system. In this election there were 29 multi-member districts returning 68 members and 43 single member districts. In the multi-member districts each elector could vote for as many candidates as there were vacancies. 14 districts were uncontested. There was no recognisable party structure at this election. The average number of enrolled voters per seat was 1,549 for a country seat and 2,361 for an urban one, ranging from East Maitland (966) to Bourke (3,478).\nThe electoral boundaries were established under the Electoral Act 1880 (NSW) which was the first major redistribution since 1858 in which 12 districts were abolished, and 23 new districts were created. an overall increase in the number of districts from 61 to 72, and an increase in the number of members from 73 to 108.\nElection results\nAlbury\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (new seat)\nGeorge Day was the sitting member for The Hume\nArgyle\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (1 new seat)\nThe sitting member William Davies did not contest the election.\nBalmain\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (new seat)\nThe Sydney Daily Telegraph reported that 60 of the informal votes had written \"I Vote for Taylor\" on them, where Jacob Garrard won the election by only 12 votes.\nBalranald\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (1 new seat)\nThe sitting member Colin Simson did not contest the election.\nBathurst\n}}\nThe Bogan\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (1 new seat)\nThe Bogan lost part of the district to the new seat of Forbes.
