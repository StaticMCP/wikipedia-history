Two Quran verses, 5:11 and 4:101, are related to this event.\nBackground\nMuhammad learned that certain tribes of Banu Ghatafan were assembling at Dhat al-Riqa.\nBattle\nHe proceeded towards Nejd leading 400-700 men after he had mandated Abu Dhar to manage Madinah during his absence. In another version, Uthman ibn Affan, is given this honor. The Muslim fighters penetrated deep into their land until they reached Nakhlah where they came across bedouins of Ghatfan.\nThis is called the expedition of Dhat al-Riqa (the patchwork of mountains). Muhammad conducted a surprise raid to disperse them. The Ghatafan fled to the mountains, leaving their women behind. No fighting took place, but Muhammad attacked their habitations and captured their women. Other sources report Muhammad signed a treaty with the tribe.\nWhen prayer time came, the Muslims worried that the Ghatafan men might descend from their mountain hideout and attack them while they were praying. Apprehending this fear, Muhammad introduced the ‘service of prayer of danger'. In this system, parties of faithful take turns standing guard while the other party prays. According to Muslim sources, God revealed verses 4:101 regarding shortening of a prayer.\n}}\nAftermath\nWhile Muhammad was resting under a shade tree at Dhat al-Riqa, a polytheist man came to him with the intention of killing him. The man was playing with Muhammad's sword and pointed it to Muhammad; asking him:  Muhammad replied:  The man asked:  Muhammad said:  The would-be assassin then sheathed the sword and returned it to Muhammad. Verse 5:11 was then revealed, proclaiming Allah's protection for Muhammad. After fifteen days Muhammad returned to Medina. However, he was not at peace; he apprehended that the Banu Ghatafan might attack to reclaim their women.\nTiming\nSome scholars claim that the expedition took place in Nejd (a large tableland in the Arabian Peninsula) in Rabi‘ Ath-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula, A.H. 4 (or beginning of AH 5). They claim that it was strategically necessary to carry out this campaign in order to quell the rebellious Bedouins to prepare for the encounter with the polytheists, i.e. minor Badr Battle in Sha‘ban A.H. 4.\nHowever, Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri claimed that Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign took place after the fall of Khaibar (and not as part of the Invasion of Nejd). This is supported by the fact that Abu Hurairah and Abu Musa Ashaari witnessed the battle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari came back from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and joined Muhammad at Khaibar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear that Muhammad observed at Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign, were revealed at the Asfan Invasion. Scholars say that this took place after Al-Khandaq (the Battle of the Trench).\nIt is well documented that the Battle of Badr was fought on Friday, 17 Ramadan AH 2. In his book ''Essai sur l'histoire des arabes avant l'islamisme, pendant l'epoque de Mahomet'' Armand-Pierre Caussin de Perceval equates Ramadan with the Muslim month ending in January AD 624 and notes (correctly) that the seventeenth of that month was a Saturday (14 January). Again, it is well documented that the battle of Uhud was fought on Saturday, 7 Shawwal AH 3. Caussin de Perceval equates Shawwal with the Muslim month ending in February 625 and says that the seventh of that month was Tuesday. The new moon of that month fell on a Monday morning so would have become visible that evening. Thus the first would have been Tuesday and the seventh Monday. The reason why the dates do not agree is that Caussin de Perceval assumes an intercalation every three years (thus in AH 1, AH 4 and AH 7). This period is too long (the average is seven intercalations in nineteen years rather than seven in 21), which means that his dates become progressively later moving back from the reform of the calendar in AD 632. Since the day of the week in the Muslim calendar advances by one or two days per month the discrepancy is resolved by pushing Caussin de Perceval's calculated dates back a month.\nIslamic sources\nQuran 4:101 and 5:11\nThe Quran verse 4:101 was reportedly revealed in this event, regarding shortening of prayers, as was verse 5:11, regarding a man who was sent to kill Muhammad or threaten him which states:\n}}\nBiographical literature\nThe event is mentioned by the Muslim jurist Tabari as follows:\nThis event is mentioned in Ibn Hisham's biography of Muhammad. The Muslim jurist Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya mentions the event in his biography of Muhammad, ''Zad al-Ma'ad. Among the modern secondary sources that mention this is The Sealed Nectar.\nHadith literature\nThe Sunni Hadith collection Sahih Muslim also says about this event:\n}}\nSee also\n* List of battles of Muhammad\n* Military career of Muhammad\n* Muslim–Quraysh War\nNotes"
