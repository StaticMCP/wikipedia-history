The book was written and compiled by the Qing dynasty scholar Wu Renchen ( 1628 –  1689). Wu took part in the compilation of Mingshi, the official history of the Ming dynasty, and felt that the official dynastic histories have neglected the Ten Kingdoms. The book contains 114 volumes (scrolls).\nContents\nThe book consists of 114 volumes covering the histories of the Ten Kingdoms:\n#14 volumes - Wu (907–937)\n#20 volumes - Southern Tang (937–975)\n#13 volumes - Former Shu (907–925)\n#10 volumes - Later Shu (934–965)\n#9 volumes - Southern Han (917–971)\n#10 volumes - Chu (907–951)\n#13 volumes - Wuyue (907–978)\n#10 volumes - Min (909–945)\n#4 volumes - Jingnan (924–963)\n#5 volumes - Northern Han (951–979)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&res=4800 《摛藻堂四庫全書薈要》本《十國春秋》 (Library) - Chinese Text Project]\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
