Both clubs are the most decorated in their respective counties and have 35 league championships between them to date (beaten only by the collective haul of St Helens and Wigan Warriors at 41). The rivalry has been described as the most underrated rivalry in British rugby league, and having the grounds to be placed with the aforementioned Good Friday Derby between St Helens and Wigan and the Hull Derby. The rivalry was not present in the early years of rugby league, despite both clubs being founder members of the NRFU, with Leeds not winning their first league title until 1961. From then, the competitive rivalry started to intensify, but it wasn't until Wigan's period of dominance in the late 80s and 90s then Leeds's dominance in the late 00s and early 10s which saw both teams win the treble in their respective periods and the rivalry become what it is today.\nName\nSince the discontinuation of the county origin series War of the Roses in 2003, the Leeds-Wigan rivalry has seemingly inherited the name in the years since only adding to the rivalry's intensity. As representatives of the largest city in their respective counties (Leeds and Manchester), the term \"Roses Derby\" is often used to describe derby matches from theses cities. The term has been used to describe matches in football and cricket, with the term deriving from the War of the Roses between the House of Lancaster and the House of York.\nHead to Head\n:Statistics correct as of 05/05/2025\nIn all competitions, competitive and uncompetitive:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Played\n!Leeds\n!Drawn\n!Wigan\n|-\n|274\n|107\n|8\n|157\n|}\nMeetings in major finals\nand Wigan Warriors contest the 2011 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium]]\n*1982–83 League Cup Final: Wigan 15–4 Leeds\n*1993–94 Challenge Cup Final: Wigan 26–16 Leeds\n*1994–95 Challenge Cup Final: Wigan 30–10 Leeds\n*1994–95 Premiership Final: Wigan 69–12 Leeds\n*1995–96 Charity Shield: Wigan 45–20 Leeds\n*1998 Super League Grand Final: Wigan 10–4 Leeds\n*2011 Challenge Cup Final: Wigan 28–18 Leeds\n*2015 Super League Grand Final: Leeds 22–20 Wigan\nCollective Honours\n:As of the 2024 Super League Grand Final.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Leeds Rhinos\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Honour\n!colspan=\"2\"|Wigan Warriors\n|-\n!Rank\n!No.\n!No.\n!Rank\n|-\n|\n|11\n|League Championships\n|24\n|\n|-\n|\n|9\n|League Leaders\n|23\n|\n|-\n|\n|14\n|Challenge Cup\n|21\n|\n|-\n|4th\n|2\n|Premiership\n|6\n|\n|-\n|\n|4\n|League Cup\n|8\n|\n|-\n|\n|0\n|Charity Shield\n|4\n|\n|-\n|\n|3\n|World Club Challenge\n|5\n|\n|-\n|\n|15\n|Yorkshire / Lancashire League\n|18\n|\n|-\n|\n|17\n|Yorkshire / Lancashire Cup\n|21\n|\n|-\n|5th\n|1\n|BBC2 Floodlit Trophy\n|1\n|5th\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Derbies in the Rugby Football League\n*Roses rivalry\nNotes\nReferences"
