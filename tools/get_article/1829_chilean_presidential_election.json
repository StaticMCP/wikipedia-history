Two hundred and sixteen electors, three for each congressman, were to be chosen. Each elector voted for two names, without specifying which vote was for President or Vice President.\nThe election was subject to abuses, so electors gave their vote to Francisco Antonio Pinto and to Joaquín Vicuña.\nEven though Pinto was accepted as president, his resignation and replacement by Vice President Joaquín Vicuña triggered the Chilean Civil War of 1829.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
