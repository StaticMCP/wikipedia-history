Several hundred Polish insurgents, mostly scythemen and some armed with sticks, planned to attack the town of Lubartów, Congress Poland, which was garrisoned by the Imperial Russian Army. Furthermore, the Poles wanted to capture the nearby hamlet of Skrobów, where Russian artillery cannons were kept.\nThe attack on Skrobów failed, and Russian sentries, who fled to Lubartów, warned their officers. The insurgents thus lost the element of surprise, and their action was repulsed. After losing some men, the rebels withdrew to the nearby forests.\nSources\n* J.
