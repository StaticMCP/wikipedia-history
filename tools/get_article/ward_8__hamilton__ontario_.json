Despite Climie's early entry into the race, he made no effort to campaign, not responding to any questions from local media, maintaining any campaign website or infrastructure, or appearing at any debates.\nJohn-Paul Danko, runner up in the 2016 Ward 7 by-election, registered to run in Ward 8 on May 11, 2018. Danko, the husband of Ward 7 Public School Trustee Dawn Danko, began to publicly campaign for an appointment to city council after the winner of the 2016 by-election, Donna Skelly, was elected Progressive Conservative MPP for Flamborough—Glanbrook.\nColleen Wicken registered to seek the seat on June 28, 2018. Wicken, a staffer with Ward 8 Councillor Terry Whitehead and former chair of the Bonnington-Buchanan-Mohawk-Southam Neighbourhoods Association, had previously advocated for more police presence in student neighbourhoods and against the city's ward boundary changes. Danko ran on a platform of supporting the city's LRT project, reducing speeds on local streets, investing in infrastructure, and planning for intensification along Upper James Street.\nOn the final day of registrations, former Mississauga City Councillor and MP for Mississauga-Brampton South, Eve Adams, registered to seek the Ward 8 seat. Adams, who was elected as a Conservative in 2011 and crossed the floor to the Liberals prior to the 2015 election before losing a nomination battle to Marco Mendicino in the Toronto-area riding of Eglinton-Lawrence, had served on Mississauga City Council representing Ward 5 from 2003 to her election to Parliament in 2011. Adams, who has family in Hamilton, noted that she wanted to widen the Red Hill Valley Expressway and the 403, cancel the city's LRT project, and attract more businesses to Hamilton.\nDuring the campaign, Ward 8 councillor Terry Whitehead, who was seeking election in Ward 14, mass-emailed constituents, accusing Wicken of stealing a contact list meant for Christmas cards for personal political gain and encouraging residents to report Wicken to the police. Wicken denied the accusation. Whitehead, who had endorsed Ruddick, requested the Hamilton Police open an investigation into the matter.\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Candidate\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular vote\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Expenditures\n|-\n!
