      "text": "# Edward Ecclestone\n\nEdward Ecclestone (c.1647–1675) was an English cleric, rector of St Mary's, Oldswinford in Worcestershire.\nLife\nEdward Ecclestone was a son of William Ecclestone of Charnock Richard, Lancashire.  He was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford, matriculating on 3 July 1663 at the age of 16.  He was awarded his BA on 24 February 1666. He died and was buried at Oldswinford on 24 January 1675.\nCareer\nEcclestone was the household chaplain to Thomas Foley, appointed on the recommendation of Richard Baxter.  According to Nash (citing the Register of Bishop Walter Blandford), Foley presented Ecclestone as rector of Oldswinford on 17 May 1673.  Ecclestone corresponded with Baxter about conforming, with the exchanges becoming acrimonious as Ecclestone decided to conform.\nSuggested authorship of ''Noah's Flood\nEdward Ecclestone has been identified as the author of a verse version of Noah's Flood'', a sequel to Dryden's The State of Innocence (1677). This work was first published in 1679 with subsequent versions in 1685 and 1690. Although it is possible ''Noah's Flood'' was the posthumous publication of Edward Ecclestone of Oldswinford, it is less likely that the subsequent versions could be attributed to his authorship.  The title page describes the author as \"Gent\".  A second Edward Eccleston(e) is listed as a graduate of Oxford and is described as the son of Thomas of Middlesex, \"gent\".  (Edward Ecclestone of Oldswinford's father is described as \"pleb\".)  There is no evidence to prefer the identification of Edward Ecclestone of Oldswinford as the author of ''Noah's Flood''.\nReferences\nSee also\n*"
