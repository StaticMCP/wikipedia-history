This species occurs in summer around the Mediterranean, through the Balkans via Turkey, the Caucasus and surrounding regions to Central Asia. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAt 15–16&nbsp;cm length—somewhat larger than a blackcap—this is one of the largest species of typical warblers. The adult males have a plain grey back. The bill is long and pointed and the legs black. The male has a dark grey head, black eye mask, and white throat. The iris is white. Females and immatures have a paler head and reddish underparts; their grey back has a brownish tinge. The iris is dark in young birds. It is difficult to visually distinguish from the Western Orphean warbler.\nThe song is a series of warbling  and scolding notes. Its song is more varied than that of the western Orphean warbler, approaching the Nightingale in richness.\nThese small passerine birds are found in open deciduous woodland. 4–6 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or tree. Like most \"warblers\", the eastern Orphean warbler is a nectarivore.\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://aulaenred.ibercaja.es/wp-content/uploads/369_OrpheanWarblerShortensis.pdf Ageing and sexing (PDF) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta]\n*\n**\n**\n}}"
