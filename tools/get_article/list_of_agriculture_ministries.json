The ministry is often headed by a minister for agriculture.\nSpecific duties may relate to regulation, promotion, agricultural research, price supports and agricultural subsidies, plant diseases, invasive species and the management of biosecurity. Some countries have multiple agriculture ministries, devoting entire ministries to be more specific; policy areas such as: forestry and fisheries; rural affairs; food and food quality, security, and safety; consumer protection; and matters relating to the Environment.\nAgriculture ministries by country\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
