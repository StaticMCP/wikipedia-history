      "text": "# Ibibio Kingdom\n\nThe Ibibio people are an ethnic group located predominantly in southeastern Nigeria, especially in present‑day Akwa Ibom and parts of Cross River State. Their history includes the formation of ancient kingdoms, notably the Mbot Abasi (or Ibom) Kingdom, and rich cultural traditions.\nHistory\nTraditionally, the Ibibio engaged in rainforest agriculture (yam, taro, cassava) as well as palm‑produce export. Many communities are coastal and involved in fishing or palm‑kernel trade.\nBefore the colonial era, the Ibibio are believed to have formed proto‑state entities such as the Ibom Kingdom (also called Mbot Abasi Kingdom) with its seat at Obot Okon Ita.\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Ibibio engaged in conflicts such as the Aro–Ibibio Wars.\nColonial and modern era\nUnder British colonial rule, the Ibibio regions were incorporated into the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and later into Nigeria after independence. Traditional governance structures such as secret societies (Ekpo) continued to influence local politics and social control.\nLanguage and culture\nThe Ibibio language belongs to the Lower Cross branch of the Niger–Congo family and is closely related to Efik and Annang.\nCultural practices include masquerades (e.g., Ekpo and Ekpe societies), wood‑carving, and the use of the nsibidi script in earlier times.\nSee also\n* Ibibio-Efik languages\n* Ekpo Society\n* List of ethnic groups in Nigeria\nReferences"
