The Aragonese fleet was able to capture 4 prize galleys, two more Marinid ships were run aground, and seven managed to escape.\nThis naval victory, along with the battles of Bullones, Algeciras and Guadalmesí, were part of the campaign that eventually led up to the Siege of Algeciras.\nBibliography\n* Manuel López Fernández: [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3202972 Aproximación a las fechas de las batallas navales de Bullones, Guadalmesí y Estepona].
