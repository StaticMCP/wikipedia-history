Enkhbayar, a former Chairman of the original MPRP, a former Prime Minister of Mongolia and a former President of Mongolia, was the party's only chairman.\nThe MPRP merged with the Mongolian People's Party (MPP) in May 2021.\nIdeology\nThe party's stated mission was to:\n# Dismantle the oligopoly\n# Give more authority to the people\n# Give the people Mongolia's natural wealth\n# Provide employment and property for every household\nThe MPRP believed that with the implementation of these integrated policies—aimed at creating human-centered social welfare, economic development and citizen-oriented governance—Mongolia and its people would achieve prosperity and progress.\nThe MPRP, along with the Democratic Party, advocated for restrictions on the number of years a foreign firm can operate in Mongolia, and called for new industrial mining projects to be fully Mongolian-controlled. Some observers labelled the party \"populist\" on account of this position. The MPRP campaigned on the platform of \"resource nationalism\" in the 2012 election.\nHistory\nThe topic of changing the name, symbol and the ideology of the MPRP in a post-communist Mongolia has been a subject to debate since the 1990s. During the 26th Party Congress of the MPRP in November 2010, it was ultimately decided that the party would revert back to its original name \"Mongolian People's Party\" and ideologically shift from democratic socialism to social democracy.\nThis decision was not popular among all factions within the MPRP and its 150,000 party members. Ultimately, it led to the party splitting into the MPP and MPRP, the latter led by former president, former prime minister and former MPRP chairman Nambaryn Enkhbayar. Enkhbayar's splinter party was officially permitted to use the name \"Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party\" by the Supreme Court of Mongolia on 24 June 2011.\nJustice Coalition\nIn May 2012, the MPRP formed the Justice Coalition with the Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP) to run for the upcoming 2012 elections. The coalition won 11 seats out of 76 in the State Great Khural and became a part of a coalition government with the Democratic Party (DP). The coalition gradually broke up as MNDP members of parliament crossed the floor to the DP, and was dissolved in May 2016.\nThe MPRP ran independently in the 2016 parliamentary elections and won only a single seat in the State Great Khural.\nOur Coalition\nIn March 2020, the MPRP, the Civil Will–Green Party, and the Mongolian Traditional United Party formed the Our Coalition to run for the 2020 parliamentary election. The coalition won a single seat in the State Great Khural, which belonged to the party's 2017 presidential nominee Sainkhuugiin Ganbaatar. He would join the Democratic Party in 2021, when the MPRP and the MPP decided to strategically unite for the upcoming 2021 presidential election.\nMerger with the Mongolian People's Party\nOn 29 April 2021, the year which commemorated the 100 Year Anniversary of the Mongolian People's Party, the MPRP and the Mongolian People's Party signed an agreement to merge the two parties. The MPRP was deregistered by the Supreme Court on 28 May 2021.\nElectoral history\nPresidential election\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n|2013\n|Natsagiin Udval\n|80,563\n|6.58%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2017\n|Sainkhuugiin Ganbaatar\n|409,899\n|30.61%\n|bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=3|not qualified for second round\n|}\nState Great Khural elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Government\n|-\n|2012\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Nambaryn Enkhbayar\n|252,115\n|22.31%\n|}}\n|New\n| 3rd\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|112,850\n|8.00%\n|}}\n| 10\n| 3rd\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|323,675\n|8.10%\n|}}\n| 0\n| 3rd\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mongolian-Peoples-Party Britannica]"
