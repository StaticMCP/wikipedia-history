      "text": "# Edge Hill (Liverpool ward)\n\nEdge Hill ward is an electoral division of Liverpool City Council centred on the Edge Hill area of the city. It was created in 1895 from part of the previous West Derby ward where three councillors were elected. It was dissolved in 1953.\nThe ward was recreated in 2023 following a review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Edge Hill ward was reinstated as a single-member ward from the western half of the former Picton ward and a small part of the former Princes Park ward. The ward contains Archbishop Blanch School, the Edge Hill railway station and Wavertree Botanic Garden and Park.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#FFF\"| 1953 - 2022 WARD DISESTABLISHED\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Naz Hasan (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\nReferences"
