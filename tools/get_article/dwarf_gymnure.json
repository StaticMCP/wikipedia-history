It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a vulnerable species due to a restricted range.\nThe dwarf gymnure was first described as a separate taxon in 1916, but it was not considered a valid species until it was more closely examined in 1994.\nThis small animal, measuring only 4-5 inches, has a foul scent, especially when threatened. It has an average lifespan of about 2 years and a gestation period of about 30–35 days.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf Gymnure\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf gymnure"
