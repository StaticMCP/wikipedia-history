He was born in Alyth, Perthshire.\nWith Silly Wizard he not only sang, but also played the tenor banjo, mandolin and tin whistles.\nAndy Stewart came from the Stewart family of Scottish Travellers which included Belle Stewart and Sheila Stewart. He learnt the song \"If I were a Blackbird\" from the former, his great-aunt.\nStewart toured with Silly Wizard until the band broke up in 1988. After this, he recorded four solo albums, as well as three with Manus Lunny. Several of Stewart's songs became well-known within the folk community, including \"The Ramblin' Rover\", \"Golden, Golden\", \"The Queen of Argyll\" and \"The Valley of Strathmore\". In addition, his renditions of classic Robert Burns songs have been well received.\nFailed spinal surgery in 2012 left Stewart paralysed from the chest down. He died from a stroke on 27 December 2015, aged 63.\nDiscography\nSolo\n*By the Hush (1982)\n*Songs of Robert Burns (1991)\n*Man in the Moon (1994)\n*Donegal Rain (1997)\nWith Silly Wizard\n*Silly Wizard (1976)\n*''Caledonia's Hardy Sons (1978)\n*So Many Partings (1979)\n*Wild and Beautiful (1981)\n*Kiss the Tears Away (1983)\n*Live in America (1985)\n*Golden Golden (1985)\n*A Glint of Silver (1987)\n*Live Wizardry (1988)\n*Live Again (2012)\nWith Manus Lunny\n*Fire in the Glen (1985, also with Phil Cunningham)\n*Dublin Lady (1987)\n*At It Again'' (1990)\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://andymstewart.org Andy M Stewart Official Website]\n*[http://greenlinnet.com/artists/andy-m-stewart Green Linnet (Record Label) Artist Page]\n*[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-andy-m-stewart-singer-and-songwriter-1-3989156 Obituary in The Scotsman]\n*[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andy-m-stewart-acclaimed-folk-singer-and-songwriter-who-made-his-name-as-a-member-of-the-much-loved-a6824246.html Andy M Stewart: Acclaimed folk singer and songwriter]"
