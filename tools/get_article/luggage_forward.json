There is no need for additional packaging.\nPricing is based on the size and number of bags being shipped as well as the shipping speed. Luggage Forward's pricing model is all-inclusive - there are no taxes or pick-up, handling or fuel surcharges.\nPartnerships\nLuggage Forward has partners throughout the travel industry and is the exclusive luggage delivery partner for Seabourn Cruise Line, providing the shipping for the Personal ValetSM service. Luggage Forward also powers the Luggage Liaison program for The Luxury Collection.\nAcquisitions\nIn 2009, Luggage Forward purchased several competitive brands including Baggage Quest and Sports Express.
