Bennett's interests lay in the history of practical mathematics from the 16th century to the 18th century, scientific instruments and astronomy.\nEarly life and education\nBennett was educated at Grosvenor High School, a grammar school in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He studied at Clare College, Cambridge, graduating with Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1969. He undertook a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, which he completed in 1974. His doctoral thesis was titled \"Studies in the life and work of Sir Christopher Wren\".\nCareer\nBennett was subsequently a fellow and senior tutor of Churchill College and curator of the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, both part of Cambridge University. His work in Cambridge included hands-on use of scientific and navigational instruments, using the Whipple collection to teach undergraduates how instruments worked, and gaining insight into the difficulties faced by the historical teachers of those instruments.\nBennett was Director of the Museum of the History of Science at Oxford University (since renamed the History of Science Museum). He was appointed on 1 October 1994, on the retirement of the previous director, Francis Maddison, and retired on 30 September 2012. He was also a fellow of the Faculty of History and Linacre College. In 2010, the University of Oxford gave him the title Professor of the History of Science. Under his leadership at the museum, the visitor figures increased from 25,000 to 180,000. He was an early adopter of the World Wide Web with a website for the museum, including online exhibitions such as The Measurers in 1995.\n]]\nIn 2016, Bennett became the president of the Hakluyt Society. He also held the position of Keeper Emeritus at the Science Museum, London. In addition, Bennett was President of the British Society for the History of Science and President of the Scientific Instrument Commission of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science. He also appeared in television documentaries.\nIn 1976, Bennett was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS). He was also elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA) on 3 March 1989.\nSelected publications\n* The Mathematical Science of Christopher Wren, J.A. Bennett.
