The Warriors, led by eighth-year head coach Joe Gallo, played their home games at Hammel Court, with some games at Lawler Arena, located in North Andover, Massachusetts, as members of the Northeast Conference (NEC). They finished the season 21–12, 13–3 in NEC play, to finish in a tie for the regular-season championship. As the No. 2 seed in the NEC tournament, they defeated LIU and Le Moyne before losing to Wagner in the championship game.\nOn October 23, 2023, it was announced that this season would be the last for Merrimack as members of the Northeast Conference, as they will be joining the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference next season.\nPrevious season\nThe 2022–23 season marked Merrimack's final year of a four-year transition period from Division II to Division I. As a result, the Warriors were not be eligible to play in the NCAA tournament. However, a rule change made by the Northeast Conference allowed the Warriors to compete in the NEC tournament.\nThe Warriors finished the 2022–23 season 15–16, 12–4 in NEC play, to claim first place. In the NEC tournament, Merrimack defeated LIU, Sacred Heart and Fairleigh Dickinson to win the championship. Due to their ineligibility to compete in the NCAA tournament, runners-up Fairleigh Dickinson were awarded the NEC conference auto-bid, ending the Warriors' season with a final record of 18–16.\nPreseason polls\nNortheast Conference poll\nThe Northeast Conference released its preseason coaches' poll on October 24, 2023.
