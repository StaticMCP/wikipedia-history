The Swedes were defeated, with a loss of 1,000 men killed and captured along with all their artillery pieces. The Russians sustained about 1,000 killed along with another 2,000 wounded (according to a Russian soldier who later admitted, after being captured by the Swedes, to 3,000 total losses).\nAftermath\nAlthough Sheremetev pulled back to Pskov after the battle, the next year he fought the Swedes again under Schlippenbach in the battle of Hummelshof.\nBefore invading Ingria, Tsar Peter I secured Poland's continued participation in the war against Sweden by promising King Augustus II of Poland, 20,000 Russian troops, 100,000 pounds of gunpowder, and 100,000 rubles per year over three years.\nCelebration\nIt was the first significant Russian victory in the Great Northern War. Peter I considered the battle a turning point - the first ever Russian victory against the Swedes in a field battle. Along with a gift of the tsars portrait adorned with diamonds, Sheremetev was elevated to general feldmarshall. All of the participating officers were gifted money and regular soldiers a freshly minted silver ducat. In Moscow a huge victory celebration was held, along with cannon volleys, thanksgiving services, and free wine, beer, mead and vodka. A firework ended the celebration in the evening.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
