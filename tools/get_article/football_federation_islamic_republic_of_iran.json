It was founded in 1920. The federation has been a member of FIFA since 1948 and a member of the Asian Football Confederation since 1958.\nHistory\nIn 2001, Iran were founding members of the West Asian Football Federation, along with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria.\nControversies\nOn 23 November 2006, the federation was suspended by FIFA, due to government interference in football matters. FIFA rules decree that a national football federation should remain autonomous from the national government. However, on 17 December 2006, the ban was lifted and a new Transitory Board was composed.\nDuring the 2009 Iranian election protests, seven members of the Iran national football team were initially reported to have been banned for life by the federation for wearing green armbands in support of the Iranian Green Movement.\nIran women's national football team was briefly suspended by FIFA from international competition in 2011 for being required by the federation to wear headscarves.\nIn 2014, Iran joined the Central Asian Football Association.\nIn 2015, the federation banned players from the men's national team due to conscription problems.\nIn August 2017, the federation banned Masoud Shojaei and Ehsan Hajsafi from the national team after they played against the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in the UEFA Europa League.\nOn 9 November 2018 Fatma Samoura, Secretary General of International Federation of Football Association FIFA said she would ask Iranian government to end ban on women's entry to sport stadiums. On 7 August 2019, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, prosecutor general of Iran, supporting the ban, said that it should not concern FIFA, if women in Iran can enter sports stadiums or not. However, after continuous pressure from FIFA, IRNA deputy Sports Minister Jamshid Taghizadeh said, women would be allowed to enter Azadi Stadium to watch the men's World Cup 2022 qualifier match between Iran and Cambodia in October. However, in March 2022, Iranian women were again banned from entering the stadium for a World Cup qualifier.\nDuring the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, the Iranian government and federation reportedly sent paid members of the Basij and IRGC to cheer for the team in the stands and to counter protesters.\nIn April 2024, goalkeeper Hossein Hosseini was summoned, suspended, and fined by the Iranian federation for hugging a female fan. In October 2024, Zahra Ghanbari was suspended and forced to apologize by the Iranian federation for \"improper hijab\" during a goal celebration at the 2024–25 AFC Women's Champions League. In December 2024, defender Ramin Rezaeian was summoned by the federation as well after hugging a female fan.\nCompetitions\nMen's\n*Persian Gulf Pro League\n*Azadegan League\n*League 2 (Iran)\n*League 3 (Iran)\n*Hazfi Cup\n*Iranian Super Cup\nWomen's\n*Kowsar Women Football League\n*Hazfi Cup (women)\n*Iranian Supercup (women)\nMembership\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Organization\n!Affiliation\n!Notes\n|-\n|FIFA\n|since\n|\n|-\n|AFC\n|since\n|\n|-\n|WAFF\n|2001–2014;\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Founding member\n|-\n|CAFA\n|since\n|}\nPresidents\nat the 1978 FIFA World Cup|alt=|261x261px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
