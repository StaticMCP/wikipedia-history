It was released on April 8, 2003 through Psychopathic Records. Production was handled by Zug Izland, Fritz the Cat, Monoxide Child and Violent J, with co-producers Eric Koder and Shaggy 2 Dope. It features guest appearances from Insane Clown Posse, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Esham, Zug Izland, Twiztid and Paris.\nThe album peaked at number 98 on the Billboard 200, number 42 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 4 on the Independent Albums in the United States.\nBackground\nFormerly known as Native Funk, Anybody Killa made his first appearance in the Juggalo world on the Dark Lotus song \"Drunken Ninja Master\" recorded specifically for Twiztid's 2001 compilation album Cryptic Collection Vol. 2. He then went on to have multiple appearances on Blaze Ya Dead Homie's debut album 1 Less G n da Hood, and with the overwhelmingly positive response from the fans, ABK recorded his first album for Psychopatic Records from 2002 through early 2003.\nThe album went through various name changes before its release date, including Foo Dang and Psychopathic Warrior.\nLegacy\nIn his review for AllMusic, Johnny Loftus wrote: \"Lines like 'Shootin' off my arrows like AKs' and broad references to the 'native hydro' -- which may or may not be peyote -- make ABK's act seem gimmicky, not menacing, and certainly don't establish him as a new voice in Native American hip hop\".\nIt was announced that while on 2017 April Fools Foolin' tour with Mr. Y.U.G., Mad V and Jay Villain, Anybody Killa will also be doing a Hatchet Warrior Show with fellow Michigan-based rapper Skitzo, performing the album in its entirety at selected locations.\nTrack listing\n| length3 = 2:12\n| title4 = Sticky Icky Situation\n| note4 = featuring Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Violent J and Esham\n| lyrics4 =\n| music4 =\n| length4 = 4:04\n| title5 = Ya Neden's Haunted\n| note5 = featuring Insane Clown Posse and Esham\n| lyrics5 =\n| music5 = Puwal\n| length5 = 3:37\n| title6 = Ghetto Neighbor\n| note6 = featuring Monoxide Child, Paris, Violent J and Syn\n| lyrics6 =\n| music6 =\n| length6 = 4:03\n| title7 = Come Out to Play\n| note7 = featuring Jamie Madrox and Violent J\n| lyrics7 =\n| music7 = Puwal\n| length7 = 3:42\n| title8 = Hated Me\n| note8 = featuring Violent J\n| lyrics8 = Lowery\n| music8 = Puwal\n| length8 = 5:24\n| title9 = Tools\n| note9 = featuring Blaze Ya Dead Homie\n| lyrics9 =\n| music9 = Puwal\n| length9 = 2:49\n| title10 = While You're Sleeping\n| lyrics10 = Lowery\n| music10 = Puwal\n| length10 = 3:53\n| title11 = Hollowpoint\n| note11 = featuring Violent J and Syn\n| lyrics11 = Lowery\n| music11 = Vankosky\n| length11 = 4:28\n| title12 = Now You Know\n| note12 = featuring Shaggy 2 Dope\n| lyrics12 =\n| music12 = Puwal\n| length12 = 3:00\n| title13 = Foo Dang\n| note13 = featuring Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Barry and Dan Miller\n| lyrics13 =\n| music13 =\n| length13 = 4:03\n| title14 = Gang Related\n| note14 = featuring Insane Clown Posse and Syn\n| lyrics14 =\n| music14 =\n| length14 = 4:49\n| title15 = In the City\n| note15 = featuring Lil' Pig\n| lyrics15 =\n| music15 = Joe Walsh\n| length15 = 4:12\n| total_length = 53:05\n}}\nPersonnel\nVocalists\n*James \"Anybody Killa\" Lowery – vocals\n*Joseph \"Violent J\" Bruce – vocals (tracks: 4-8, 11, 14)\n*Chris \"Blaze Ya Dead Homie\" Rouleau – vocals (tracks: 4, 9, 13)\n*Esham Smith – vocals (tracks: 4, 5)\n*Joseph \"Shaggy 2 Dope\" Utsler – vocals (tracks: 5, 12, 14)\n*Paul \"Monoxide\" Methric – vocals (track 6)\n*Oscar \"Paris\" Jackson, Jr. – vocals (track 6)\n*Syn – vocals (tracks: 6, 11, 14)\n*James \"Jamie Madrox\" Spaniolo – vocals (track 7)\n*Dan Miller – vocals (track 13)\n*Barry – vocals (track 13)\n*Ashley \"Lil' Pig\" Horak – vocals (track 15)\nInstrumentalists\n*Michael \"Mike P.\" Puwal – programming (tracks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-10, 12, 15), additional guitar (track 14)\n*Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky – programming (tracks: 3, 6, 11, 13, 14)\n*Violent J – programming (tracks 4)\n*Syn – additional guitar (track 6)\n*Lil' Pig – live drums (tracks: 8, 12, 14)\n*Shaggy 2 Dope – live cuts (track 12)\n*Zug Izland – programming (track 15)\nProduction\n*Mike P – producer (tracks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-10, 12, 15)\n*Fritz the Cat – producer (tracks: 3, 6, 11, 13, 14)\n*Monoxide – producer (tracks: 3, 6, 13, 14)\n*Violent J – producer (track 4), co-producer (tracks: 1-3, 5-14)\n*Zug Izland – producers (track 15)\n*Eric Koder – co-producer (tracks: 6, 11, 14)\n*Shaggy 2 Dope – co-producer (track 12)\nTechnicals\n*Mike P – engineering & mixing (tracks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-10, 12, 15), co-mixing (tracks: 3, 6, 11, 13, 14)\n*Fritz the Cat – engineering & mixing (tracks: 3, 6, 11, 13, 14)\n*Monoxide – engineering & mixing (tracks: 3, 6, 13, 14)\n*Violent J – engineering & mixing (track 4), co-mixing (tracks: 1-3, 5, 6, 9, 11-14)\n*Zug Izland – engineering & mixing (track 15)\n*Eric Koder – co-mixing (tracks: 6, 11, 14)\n*Shaggy 2 Dope – co-mixing (track 12)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
