Introduced in 2001, the Game Developers Choice Awards were preceded by the Spotlight Awards, which were presented from 1997 to 1999. Since then, the ceremony for the Independent Games Festival is held just prior to the Choice Awards ceremony.\nWinner selection process\nNominations for games are made by International Choice Awards Network (ICAN), a group of leading game creators. Votes are then additionally made by editors of Game Developer. Any video game released in the preceding calendar year, regardless of medium, is eligible to be nominated, though upgrades, expansions, and mission packs are not eligible to be nominated.\nThe top nominated games are assembled into the list of nominees, typically presented in December, are then voted on by final voting body, made up of ICANs, and editors of Game Developer. In this final stage of voting, games with the highest votes in a category are the winners.\nWinners for Special Awards (Lifetime Achievement, Pioneer, Ambassador) are decided by a \"Special Awards Jury\", which appears to consist of a variety of 5 people. This group may consider recommendations from ICAN members.\nThe winners are announced during the Game Developers Conference, which is typically held in March of the calendar year.\nGDC related properties are owned by the UBM technology group.\nHistorical process\nIn 2007, gamasutra.com took over management of the awards from the IGDA.\nAn advisory board selected by the editors of gamasutra.com and Game Developer magazine oversees the selection process.\nIn the past, nominations are accepted from registered gamasutra.com users, confirmed to be game developers, and from the advisory board.\nOnce the nomination process is complete, the advisory board identifies five finalists for each regular category.\nThe recipients of the Lifetime Achievement, Pioneer (formerly known as First Penguin) and Maverick awards are selected by the advisory board.\nFor the other awards, a vote open to all those who participated in the nomination process chooses a recipient from each category's finalists.\nList of winners\nNote: Events held for awards are held early in the following year. Winners are listed first and highlighted in bold.\nGame of the Year\nThe Game of the Year Award recognizes the overall best game released during the previous calendar year, as interpreted by the members of the Game Developers Conference.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
