It is intended to accommodate future suburban growth.\nHistory\nBanya is situated in the Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi) traditional Aboriginal country. The name Banya means bunya nut in the Gubbi Gubbi and Butchulla (Badtjala) languages.\nOn 14 June 2019, parts of the localities of Bells Creek and Meridan Plains were excised to create the localities of Banya, Corbould Park, Gagalba and Nirimba to accommodate future suburban growth in the Caloundra South Priority Development Area.\nThe Stockland-developed estate will house more than 800 families, a primary school and child care centre with future developments of the CAMCOS Rail Corridor.\nDemographics\nThe population of Banya was not separately reported in the 2021 Australian census. It was included in the 2021 census data for its neighbouring locality Bells Creek.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Banya. The nearest government primary school is Nirimba State Primary School in neighbouring Nirimba to the north. The nearest government secondary school is Baringa State Secondary College in Baringa to the north-east.\nReferences"
