Mohammed took refuge in Spain afterward. There he signed a treaty with Philip III of Spain, whereby he obtained military support in return for ceding the northern Moroccan port of Larache. At the time of the expulsion of Morsicos from Spain, Sidi al-Ayachi rose in fame, devouring himself to launch a holy war against the Christians. In April 1627, Sidi al-Ayachi revolted against the sultan and attacked the harbor of Salé, which he captured and transformed into his principality, the Republic of Salé, becoming its independent governor. al-Ayachi began attacking the Spanish areas in Morocco. In Larache, he managed to capture a spy named Ibn Aboud. Al-Ayachi ordered his execution, but Ibn Aboud begged for support in exchange for his life.\nBattle\nal-Ayachi then dispatched Ibn Aboud to Larache to lure the Spanish out of town. Ibn Aboud reported that a group of Arab tribes were camping on a hill close to the town, and a potential attack would result in a large amount of loot. The Spanish immediately left the town. Diego Ruiz de Colmenares led the Spanish troops of around 600 men. The troops of al-Ayachi surrounded the Spanish troops and massacred them. Diego was wounded in the battle and died later on. The Spanish troops suffered 436 casualties, or the entire force was killed. The ambush took place on February 7, 1631.\nReferences\nSources\n*Henry de Castries (1911), Unpublished sources of Moroccan history. Archives and libraries of France. Volume III.
