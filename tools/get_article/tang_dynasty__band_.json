They are often credited as being the first Chinese heavy metal band and the first folk metal band of Asian style as well.\nHistory\nSinger and rhythm guitarist Ding Wu, bassist Zhang Ju, and Chinese-American guitarist Kaiser Kuo co-founded Tang Dynasty in early 1989. Kuo left shortly after to return to the United States, with Liu \"Lao Wu\" Yijun taking his place. According to Kaiser, went on to become China's first \"guitar hero.\" In 1990 the band participated in the Chinese modern rock concert, where they performed early versions of two of their eventual songs. In 1991, the band released its metal/rock version of \"The Internationale\" in Chinese.\nTang Dynasty rose to fame with their eponymous debut album, released in December 1992. The album officially sold about 2,000,000 authentic copies throughout Asia and abroad, not counting the multitudes more of infringing copies. Their sound is part progressive rock and artistic metal and part traditional Chinese vocal technique. The lyrical poetry and musical arrangements meant to hearken back to the glorious days of ancient Chinese civilization; in particular, the art and cultural epitome of Chinese history as popularly represented by the era of the Tang dynasty.\nIn 1993, Tang Dynasty performed at \"The Chinese Avant Garde\", a concert featuring Cui Jian, Cobra, and Wang Yong, some of the most prominent rock artists from China at the time. During this concert, they would play songs from their first album, closing the concert with \"The Internationale\". In 1994, Tang Dynasty performed at \"The Power of Chinese Rock Bands\" alongside Dou Wei, Zhang Chu, and He Yong, closing the concert with \"Choice\" and \"Soaring Bird\".\nTragedy struck when bassist Zhang Ju died on May 11, 1995, when his motorcycle collided with a truck on the Zizhuqiao freeway overpass in western Beijing. Gu Zhong joined the band to fill the empty role of bass player. That August, Liu left the band. Co-founder Kaiser Kuo rejoined as guitarist in August 1996. During this time, the band had developed creativity conflicts and had parted with their Magic Stone Label, Almost disbanding during this era.\nThe band's 1998 release Epic was their second album, seven years after their debut record. The record received less recognition, as many believed the album had abandoned Tang Dynasty's oriental rock style for a more western style. In 1999, Tang Dynasty would hold a series of live performances showcasing tracks on Epic along with some popular tracks from Tang Dynasty. Kaiser again parted company with Tang Dynasty in June 1999 after a multitude of disagreements with Ding brought to a head by the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. He would later form another well-recognized metal/rock band, Spring and Autumn (Chunqiu). Kaiser was replaced by former Iron Kite frontman Yu Yang, and then by young guitar virtuoso Chen Lei in late 2000. After some more member changes, Liu rejoined the group in 2002.\nTang Dynasty released their third album Romantic Knight (\"Langman Qishi\") in mid-2008, featuring \"Feng Shan Ji\" as the album's lead track. Kaiser appeared in the Western documentary by Sam Dunn, Global Metal, released that same year.\nIn January 2009, Liu announced his second departure from the band due to \"personal reasons.\" Vocalist Ding filled the spot of second guitarist. In February 2010, Ding Wu announced that the band was preparing for their fourth release due out later in the year. The next month, Tang Dynasty put out a two-song EP entitled Ups and Downs. The band released their fourth album, Thorn, in November 2013, and toured outside China for the first time in nearly two decades.\nOn February 20, 2019, Tang Dynasty revealed on Weibo that lead guitarist Chen Lei had been replaced by Liu Jingwei and Fu Dalong, again making the band a five-piece lineup.\nMembers\n;Current members\n* Ding Wu&nbsp;– lead vocals, guqin, xiao (1991–present), rhythm guitar (1989–2002, 2009–2019)\n* Zhao Nian&nbsp;– drums, percussion (1989–present)\n* Gu Zhong&nbsp;– bass, backing vocals (1995–present)\n* Liu Jingwei&nbsp;– lead guitar (2019–present)\n* Fu Dalong&nbsp;– lead guitar (2019–present)\n; Former members\n* Kaiser Kuo&nbsp;– lead guitar (1989, 1996–1999)\n* Liu Yijun&nbsp;– lead guitar (1989–1996, 2003–2009)\n* Zhang Ju&nbsp;– bass (1989–1995; died 1995), lead vocals (1989–1991), backing vocals (1991–1995)\n* Yu Yang&nbsp;– lead guitar (1999–2000)\n*Chen Lei&nbsp;– lead guitar, backing vocals (2000–2019)\n* Andrew Szabo&nbsp;– drums (1989)\n;Touring musicians\n* Wang Yong&nbsp;- keyboards (1993–1995)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nColors =\nid:LDVOX        value:red       legend:Lead_vocals\nid:LDGTR        value:teal     legend:Lead_guitar\nid:RTMGTR       value:green    legend:Rhythm_guitar\nid:Bass         value:blue     legend:Bass\nid:Drums        value:orange    legend:Drums\nid:BKVOX        value:pink    legend:Backing_vocals\nid:studio   value:black     legend:Studio_album\nid: ep   value:gray(0.5)   legend: EP\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1989\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1989\nBarData =\nbar:Ding   text:Ding Wu\nbar:Kuo    text:Kaiser Kuo\nbar:Liu    text:Liu Yijun\nbar: Yu    text:Yu Yang\nbar: Chen  text:Chen Lei\nbar: LJW  text: Liu Jingwei\nbar: Fu   text: Fu Dalong\nbar:Zhang  text:Zhang Ju\nbar: Gu    text:Gu Zhong\nbar: Szabo  text:Andrew Szabo\nbar:Zhao   text:Zhao Nian\nPlotData=\nwidth:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\nbar:Ding from:05/01/1991  till:01/01/2002 color:LDVOX width:3\nbar:Ding from:02/01/1989  till:01/01/2002 color:RTMGTR\nbar:Ding from:01/01/2002  till:01/16/2009 color:LDVOX\nbar:Ding from:01/16/2009  till:02/19/2019 color:RTMGTR\nbar:Ding from:01/16/2009  till:02/19/2019 color:LDVOX width:3\nbar:Ding from:02/19/2019  till:end color:LDVOX\nbar:Kuo from:02/01/1989  till:06/08/1989 color:LDGTR\nbar:Kuo from:08/01/1996  till:06/01/1999 color:LDGTR\nbar:Zhang  from:02/01/1989  till:05/11/1995 color:Bass\nbar:Zhang  from:10/01/1989  till:05/01/1991 color:LDVOX width:3\nbar:Zhang  from:05/01/1991  till:05/11/1995 color:BKVOX width:3\nbar:Szabo  from:04/15/1989  till:06/08/1989 color:Drums\nbar:Zhao  from:10/01/1989  till:end color:Drums\nbar:Liu  from:10/01/1989  till:08/01/1996 color:LDGTR\nbar:Liu  from:01/01/2002  till:01/16/2009 color:LDGTR\nbar:Gu   from:05/11/1995  till:end color:Bass\nbar:Gu   from:05/11/1995  till:end color:BKVOX width:3\nbar:Yu   from:06/01/1999  till:06/01/2000 color:LDGTR\nbar:Chen  from:06/01/2000  till:02/19/2019 color:LDGTR\nbar:Chen  from:06/01/2000  till:02/19/2019 color:BKVOX width:3\nbar:LJW  from:02/19/2019  till:end color:LDGTR\nbar:Fu  from:02/19/2019  till:end color:RTMGTR\nLineData    =\nat:12/11/1992 color:studio layer:back\nat:12/01/1998 color:studio layer:back\nat:03/01/2000 color:ep layer:back\nat:09/01/2008 color:studio layer:back\nat:03/28/2010 color:ep layer:back\nat:11/01/2013 color:studio layer:back\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n* 1992 - 唐朝 (Tang Dynasty)\n* 1998 - 演义 (Epic)\n* 2008 - 浪漫骑士 (Romantic Knight)\n* 2013 - 芒刺 (Thorn)\nEPs\n* 2000 - 演义单曲纪念珍藏版 (Epic (single))\n* 2010 - 沉浮 (Ups and Downs)\nCompilations\n* 90 Modern Music Concert (1990) - \"谁都希望\"; \"粉雾\"\n* China Fire I (1992) - \"飞翔鸟\"\n* A Tribute to Teresa Teng (1995) - \"独上西楼\"\n* Goodbye Zhang Ju (1997) - \"月梦\"\n* True Love Forever (2000) - \"花儿为什么这样红\"; \"明月千里寄相思\"\n* Gift - \"春蚕\"\nSee also\n* Chinese heavy metal\n* Chinese rock\n* Cui Jian\n* Dou Wei\n* Overload\n* Zhang Chu\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://tangchao.ent.163.com/ tangchao.ent]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGUtUmQeTus Culture Express variety show hosted by Ji Xiaojun, featuring Tang Dynasty in studio for upcoming new record]\n*[https://archive.today/20070621152204/http://web125.burns.kundenserver42.de/rockinchina/wiki/index.php/Tang_Dynasty Tang Dynasty page] from Rock in China site\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061110025052/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/1857/2004-11-29/126@173357.htm \"Kaiser Kuo, Tang Dynasty, Spring and Autumn\"], from China Beat radio program"
