The club had enough sales that he continued for several years.\n* 1934 – Associated American Artists (AAA) was established by Reeves Lewenthal, and operated until 2000.

The Center became the \"heart of the Harlem Renaissance as a learning and meeting place for the first generation of modern African-American artists.\"\n* 1937 – African-American master printmaker and painter Dox Thrash joined the Fine Print Workshop of the Philadelphia Federal Art Project (of the WPA); He was the first African-American to join the workshop. Thrash co-discovered with Hugh Mesibov and Michael Gallagher the innovative Carborundum printmaking process, in which an artist grinds carborundum into a copper plate before inking it; the process \"produced a wide range of rich tones and smoothly modeled forms\".\n* 1938 – An exhibit of about thirty carborundum prints by Dox Thrash and his WPA associates was held in New Techniques in WPA Graphic Arts at the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.; at that time it was the most extensive display of new work produced by WPA printmakers.\n* 1938 – First one-person show of silkscreen prints, Guy Maccoy – artist, sponsored by the Contemporary Arts Gallery, New York\n* 1938 – Anthony Velonis, an experimental silkscreen pioneer and Federal Art Project team leader, encouraged the FAP to start a silkscreen project, which increased recognition of silkscreen as an art form. Also in that year Velonis wrote an important and influential pamphlet for artists, entitled \"Technical Problems of the Artist: Technique of the Silkscreen Process\".\n* 1938 – The FAP Graphic Arts Division team that reinvigorated screen printing processes and pioneered new screen-printing technologies under the leadership of Anthony Velonis included Harry Gottlieb, Louis Lozowick, Eugene Morley, Elizabeth Olds, and Hyman J.

It was organized by Elizabeth McCausland, who was an art critic, historian, and writer, at the Springfield (MA) Art Museum.\n* 1940 – The term 'serigraphy' was coined by Carl Zigrosser and Anthony Velonis, derived from the Latin word 'seri', meaning silk, and Greek word 'graphos', meaning to draw or write. They conceived of and promoted the term to draw a distinction between art prints and the commercial and industrial screen-processed images that were produced on a mass scale.\n* 1940 – Stanley William Hayter, fled Paris and moved his experimental print workshop, Atelier 17, to New York for the duration of World War II. Atelier 17 closed in 1955.\n* 1940 – National Serigraph Society founded. The group's original name was the Silk Screen Group until 1944.

The group conducted classes, ran a worldwide exhibition and information service, and provided a nation-wide lecture bureau and an exhibition and sales gallery in New York City.\n* 1940 – The Museum of Modern Art held two exhibits, American Color Prints Under $10. The purpose was to make American art available for purchase to a wide audience, to make ownership of prints by living artists and artisans practical in homes, offices, churches and social groups. The shows were so successful that a third exhibition and sale of color prints was held in 1941.\n* 1944 – Jackson Pollock went to Atelier 17 where in his etchings, using automatism, he created powerful and expressive prints that  characterized an early form of American Abstract expressionism, with Picasso-derived elements from pre-war compositions.\n* 1946 – Louise Bourgeois began making prints at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17, a leading printmaking workshop and studio in New York (previously in Paris). The following year she created a print project, her illustrated book called He Disappeared into Complete Silence, which included nine engravings, each accompanied by a parable written by the artist.  She was fascinated by skyscrapers upon arrival in New York from Paris; the imagery in her project was mainly of these buildings.\n* 1947 – Robert Blackburn, an African-American printmaker and highly regarded teacher, established the Printmaking Workshop in a Chelsea loft in New York City. Blackburn was a renowned master printer for Charles White, Faith Ringgold, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Betye Saar.\n1950s\n* 1951–1952 – Will Barnet experimented with multi-stone color lithographs in collaboration with Robert Blackburn at the latter's New York City workshop.\n* 1956 – The Print Council of America was established.\n* 1956 – The Pratt Graphics Center was established in New York City to be a stimulating experimental and international workshop at which students and artists would be welcome in an urban setting.

ULAE set a high standard for printmaking in the country after the war.

She emphasized the vital role that a small number of creative artists can play in generating a renaissance in an art form, when the circumstances of their activities are fortuitous in time and place. A few master printers geographically dispersed in America, with clusters of eager artists learning from them, could lead to a resurgence in global interest.June Wayne, Proposal for the Planning and Development for Tamarind Lithography Workshop, Inc. July 1959, p. 25. Ford Foundation Archives, Report #60-119\n1960s\n* 1960 – June Wayne established and led the Tamarind Institute in Los Angeles, which is widely credited with revitalizing fine art lithography, with co-founders Clinton Adams and Garo Antreasian, launching \"a new era in collaborative printmaking\".
