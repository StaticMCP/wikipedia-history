William Penn was granted the new proprietary colony in 1681 by Charles II of England in payment for debts owed to Penn's father. After Penn became ill in 1712, his second wife Hannah Callowhill Penn served as acting proprietor.\nAfter William's death in 1718, interest in the proprietorship passed to his three sons by Hannah: John Penn \"the American\", Thomas Penn, and Richard Penn, Sr., with John inheriting the largest share and becoming the chief proprietor. When John died without children, his brother Thomas inherited his share and became chief proprietor.\nWhen Richard Penn, Sr. died, his share passed to his son Governor John Penn. When Thomas Penn died, his share (and the chief proprietorship) passed to his son John Penn \"of Stoke\".\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # !! Chief proprietor !! Years !! Percentage interest !!
