Ball is the reluctant guest of a diminutive cadet, Bud Hooper, who wrote her a \"mash note\" and invitation to be his date at a school prom.\nBall's publicity man, Jack O'Riley, seizes upon the situation as a perfect PR stunt, and convinces her to travel 3,000 miles to join Hooper at Winsocki Military Institute's dance. When Ball actually shows up, mayhem ensues. Hooper, who never dreamed she would accept, has to disinvite his girlfriend, Helen Schlesinger, and ask Ball to pretend to be Helen, lest the actress herself not pass muster with the institution's screening committee.\nHelen fights back while Hooper tries to keep Ball from the clutches of other cadets who want to steal her for themselves. Meanwhile, Harry James and his orchestra perform various songs, including \"The Flight of the Bumblebee\".\nCast\nMusical numbers\ntinted Lucille Ball's hair flame red for her previous film, Du Barry Was a Lady (1943).
