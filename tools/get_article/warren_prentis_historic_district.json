The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\nThe district includes residential, commercial, institutional, religious and other buildings, and the majority of the pre-1930s building stock remains.\nHistory\nThe land included in the Warren–Prentis Historic District was originally the Park Lots, the Cass Farm, and the Jones/Crane Farm; these parcels were subdivided in the late 19th century. Due in part to the large lot sizes and the streetcar lines along Woodward and Third, the district became popular with upper-class Detroit businessmen and professionals moving away from downtown. A number of these citizens moved into the area in the period between 1880 and 1895, commissioning residences.\nIn the late 1880s, apartment living became more popular, and the construction of duplexes and small apartments increased while the construction of single-family homes dropped off. Commercial development in the area increased in the early 20th century, peaking in the years between World War I and the Great Depression.\nThe area declined during the Depression, as the larger single-family homes became too costly to keep up. These homes were divided into rental units, and the area was fully utilized during the boom years of World War II. The area again began declining after the war, but in the 1990s signs of revival have been evident, as the nearby Wayne State University and the Detroit Medical Center draw people to the area.\nStructures\n]]\nThere are 108 individual historic structures in the Warren–Prentis Historic District.
