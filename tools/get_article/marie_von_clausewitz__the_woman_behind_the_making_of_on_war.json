The book was released in 2015.\nSummary\nMarie von Brühl: Subject of Bellinger's biography\nThe book explores the life of Marie von Clausewitz, who was a member of the noble German Brühl family and married to military theorist, Carl von Clausewitz. After her husband's death in 1831, Marie edited and published her husband's books, the most famous one being, On War. Author Vanya Eftimova Bellinger examines the life of a \"wealthy, cultured, and politically engaged\" woman through archives and letters written between Marie and her husband.\nDevelopment history\nBellinger became interested in writing about Marie von Clausewitz after reading On War for the second time. She realized that no one had written in depth about Marie editing On War, and decided it would be worthwhile to study. After corresponding with various archives in Berlin, she was informed by the Prussian State Privy that family papers, including \"intimate correspondence\" between Marie and Carl, were donated by the aristocratic Buttlar family. The Buttlars are direct descendants of Marie's brother, Fritz.\nReception\nThe book has received positive reviews. Reviewer Jerry Lenaburg wrote, \"read this book to truly understand how this dynamic formed a loving and unprecedented marriage and intellectual partnership.\" Another reviewer praises Bellinger's ability to present Clausewitz as a woman who was politically savvy, and did everything to ensure her husband's work was preserved.\nReferences"
