Along with The Teahouse of the August Moon and the more successful film Sayonara, Japanese War Bride was argued by some scholars to have increased racial tolerance in the United States by openly discussing interracial marriages.\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79679/japanese-war-bride Japanese War Bride at Turner Classic Movies]"
