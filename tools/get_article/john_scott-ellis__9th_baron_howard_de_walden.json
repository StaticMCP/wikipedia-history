He bought a car and claimed that on his first day behind the wheel, he knocked over a pedestrian. The man's injuries were slight, apologies were made, and the two shook hands. As he drove away, Scott-Ellis's passenger told him, \"Don't you know you just knocked down Adolf Hitler?\"\nHe served in the Territorial Army in the Westminster Dragoons, rising to the rank of major.\nHe inherited Dean Castle in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, Scotland, which, along with his father's collections of arms and armour and his grandfather's collection of musical instruments, he gave to the people of Kilmarnock in 1975.\nMarriage and family\nHe married Countess Irene von Harrach in 1934. On their honeymoon in 1934, he met Hitler at a concert and spoke of his driving incident.\nHe and his wife had four daughters:\n* Hon. (Mary) Hazel Caridwen (12 August 1935 – 13 July 2024), the future 10th Baroness\n* Hon. Susan Buchan (b. 6 October 1937)\n* Hon. Jessica White (b. 6 August 1941)\n* Hon. Camilla Acloque (b. 1 April 1947)\nLady Howard de Walden died in 1975, and in 1978, Lord Howard de Walden married Gillian, Lady Mountgarret (née Buckley), 25 years his junior.\nThrough his sister Rosemary he was an uncle of the writer Miranda Seymour.\nThoroughbred racing\nLord Howard de Walden became involved in the sport of Thoroughbred racing immediately after World War II. In 1958, he bought Lord Derby's Plantation Stud at Exning, just outside Newmarket. A steward of the Jockey Club, he had success in National Hunt hurdle racing with Champion Hurdle winner, Lanzarote.\nOn the flat, he won the 1985 Epsom Derby with Slip Anchor. Lord Howard de Walden met with considerable success both on the track and in the breeding shed with Kris, who was the 1979 Champion European Miler and 1980 Champion European Older Miler, and who went on to become the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1985.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
