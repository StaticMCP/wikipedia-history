Additionally, the Democratic Party held North Dakota caucuses the same day.\nClinton had won the state eight years prior and had support from most of the state's Democratic Congressional delegation, including Senator Cory Booker. Feeling confident about her chances in the primary, Clinton cancelled campaign events in the state in favor of delegate-rich California ahead of the primary.\nOpinion polling\nResults\nResults by county\nHillary Clinton won every county except for Sussex and Warren.\n{|width=\"60%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"11%\" | County\n! width=\"10%\" | Clinton\n! width=\"10%\" | %\n! width=\"10%\" | Sanders\n! width=\"10%\" | %\n!Totals\n!Turnout\n!Margin\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tAtlantic\t||13,556||60.62%||\t8,805||39.38%\n|22,361\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tBergen\t||57,319||63.47%||\t32,994||\t36.53%\n| 90,313\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tBurlington\t||\t33,166||63.02%||\t19,461||\t36.98%\n| 52,627\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tCamden||44,400||62.27%||\t26,905||\t37.73%\n| 71,305\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tCape May\t||\t3,969||54.83%||\t3,269||\t45.17%\n| 7,238\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tCumberland\t||\t6,894||64.18%||\t3,847||\t35.82%\n| 10,741\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tEssex\t||77,836||73.07%||\t28,679||\t26.93%\n| 105,915\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tGloucester\t||\t18,011||56.12%||\t14,082||\t43.88%\n| 32,093\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tHudson\t||\t50,875||66.34%||\t25,815||\t33.66%\n| 76,690\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tHunterdon\t||\t5,794||51.93%||\t5,362||48.07%\n| 11,156\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tMercer\t||\t29,650||66.00%||\t15,276||\t34.00%\n| 44,926\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tMiddlesex\t||\t48,202||61.01%||\t30,800||\t38.99%\n| 79,002\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tMonmouth\t||\t30,967||58.07%||\t22,360||41.93%\n| 53,327\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tMorris\t||\t24,285||58.32%||\t17,355||\t41.68%\n| 41,640\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tOcean\t||\t19,663||54.49%||\t16,424||\t45.51%\n| 36,087\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tPassaic\t||29,997||67.63%||\t14,356||\t32.37%\n| 44,353\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tSalem\t||\t2,821||56.46%||\t2,175||\t43.54%\n| 4,996\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tSomerset\t||\t19,838||61.56%||\t12,385||\t38.44%\n| 32,223\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#228B22;\" |\tSussex\t||\t3,986||42.91%||\t5,303||\t57.09%\n| 9,289\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tUnion\t||\t41,605||68.82%||\t18,853||\t31.18%\n| 60,458\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#228B22;\" |\tWarren\t||\t3,413||49.00%||\t3,552||\t51.00%\n| 6,965\n|\n|\n|-\n|                             |Total                                      ||         566,247||63.32%||328,058||   36.68%\n| 894,305\n|\n|\n|}\nAnalysis\nWith its coalition of African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and college-educated, affluent Caucasian progressive/liberal professionals, New Jersey was seen as a state Clinton would win in the final batch of primaries on June 7. Having won the state eight years earlier against Barack Obama, Clinton managed a 26-point-routing against Bernie Sanders in 2016 despite the Sanders campaign's efforts in the state. She carried all counties in New Jersey but two, winning large victories in the cities of Newark, Trenton, and Atlantic City.\nReferences"
