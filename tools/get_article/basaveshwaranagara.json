It is located to the west of Rajajinagara and is sandwiched between the localities of Mahalakshmi Layout to the north and Vijayanagara to the south, spread across multiple sub-localities, three assembly constituencies and seven Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wards. The area of Basaveshwaranagara is often considered West of Chord Road as it lies to the west of Chord Road, an arterial road in the western part of Bengaluru.\nEtymology\nBasaveshwaranagara is named after Basavanna (also known as Basaveshwara), a social reformer whose followers comprise the Lingayat community.\nHistory\nBasaveshwaranagara was formed as an extension by the City Improvement Trust Board (currently the Bangalore Development Authority) in stages between the 1970s and early 1980s. At that time (even now unofficially), the area was known as West of Chord Road (WCR), as it lay to the west of the Chord Road which at the time was considered the western end of the city. There were also many private layouts in the area formed in the 1970s by public and private sector organisations for their employees such as LIC, Kirloskar Group, SBI and BEML among others. The close proximity of Basaveshwaranagara to the Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna Bengaluru Station, Kempegowda Bus Station, the Bengaluru Pete, residential-cum-commercial localities like Rajajinagara and Malleswara and the Peenya industrial area helped its growth. Today, Basaveshwaranagara is an important residential and commercial hub in West Bangalore. But since Basaveshwaranagara is very far away from the IT Corridor (a large area in the eastern and south-eastern parts of Bangalore city with IT and software parks and SEZs), large-scale development in the area has been minimal and Basaveshwaranagara is today considered one of the greenest and more conservative localities of Bengaluru city.\nGeography\nBasaveshwaranagara is situated in the western part of Bangalore, about 914 metres above sea level, at 12°98' N and 77°53' E. Nearby areas include Rajajinagara, Mahalakshmi Layout, Nandini Layout, Laggere, Sunkadakatte and Vijayanagara.\nThe terrain of Basaveshwaranagara is quite hilly and uneven. The area is known for its steep and hilly roads which rise high and low. The area was also known for lakes such as the Agrahara Dasarahalli Lake, Kurubarahalli Lake and Saneguruvahalli Lake among others. All the lakes have dried up in recent time and residential layouts or parks have been built over them.\nBasaveshwaranagara is considered to be the least polluted locality in Bengaluru city, with real-time air quality level coming well within Good levels of 0–50 most of the time. There is an air quality monitoring station at Saneguruvanahalli maintained by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Bangalore including Basaveshwaranagar itself experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw). Due to its high elevation, a more moderate climate throughout the year is experienced, although occasional heat waves can make summer somewhat uncomfortable. The coolest month is December with an average low temperature of  and the hottest month is April with an average high temperature of . The highest temperature ever recorded is  (recorded in March 1931).  The lowest ever recorded is  (recorded in January 1884). Winter temperatures rarely drop below , and summer temperatures seldom exceed . Receiving rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons ; the wettest months are September, October and August. The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding. The heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period is  recorded on 1 October 1997.\nLocalities\nBasaveshwaranagara is divided into four stages, which are further subdivided into blocks. The area also subsumes sub-localities such as:\n* Agrahara Dasarahalli\n* Ashtagrama Layout\n* Bhimajyotinagara\n* Bovi Colony\n* Gruhalakshmi Layout\n* Indiranagara\n* Kamalanagara\n* Kamalanagara Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) Layout\n* Karnataka Housing Board (KHB) Colony\n* Kirloskar Colony\n* Kurubarahalli\n* Lakshmi Nagara\n* Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) Model Housing Colony\n* Manjunatha Nagara\n* Saneguruvanahalli\n* Satyanarayana Layout\n* Shakti Ganapati Nagara\n* Sharada Colony\n* Shivanagar\n* Shivanahalli\n* Sri Venkateshwara Krupa (SVK) Layout\n* State Bank of India (SBI) Colony\n* SVNGSS Layout\n* Teachers Colony\n* Vinayaka Housing Board Cooperative Society (VHBCS) Layout\nCivic administration\nPolitics\nBasaveshwaranagar comes under three Vidhan Sabha constituencies: Rajajinagar, Mahalakshmi Layout and Govindarajanagar, which are led by former Minister S. Suresh Kumar (BJP), K. Gopalaiah (JD(S)) and former Minister V. Somanna (BJP) respectively. While most of Basaveshwaranagar falls under the Rajajinagar constituency, some sub-localities like LIC Model Housing Colony, Bhimajyothinagar, Kirloskar Colony, Shakthi Ganapathi Nagar, Sathyanarayana Layout, SBI Colony, Kamalanagar and Kurubarahalli come under the Mahalakshmi Layout constituency. Agrahara Dasarahalli comes under the Govindarajanagar constituency. Rajajinagar, Mahalakshmi Layout and Govindarajanagar assembly constituencies in turn fall under the Lok Sabha constituencies of Bangalore Central, Bangalore North and Bangalore South respectively. While Bangalore Central and North constituencies are represented by P. C. Mohan (BJP) and former Chief Minister of Karnataka D. V. Sadananda Gowda (BJP) respectively, Bangalore South is represented by Tejasvi Surya (BJP), who is the youngest Member of Parliament as of 2019.\nBBMP wards\nBasaveshwaranagar is spread across seven wards of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). One of these wards (Ward 100) goes by the name of Basaveshwaranagar itself. Barring this ward and also Ward 74 (Shakthi Ganapathi Nagar), none of the other BBMP wards fully lie within Basaveshwaranagar.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"  style=\"float:center; font-size:85%; margin:1em;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" |Basaveshwaranagar BBMP Ward information\n|-\n!
