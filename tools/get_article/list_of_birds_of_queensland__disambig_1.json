Their system has been developed over nearly two decades and has strong local support, but deviates in important ways from more generally accepted schemes. Supplemental updates follow The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2022 edition.\nThis list also uses British English throughout. Any bird names or other wording follows that convention.\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.\n* (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Queensland\n* (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Queensland\n* (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Queensland as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions\nOstriches\nOrder: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae\nThis order is not native to Australia, but feral populations of one species have become established.\n* Common ostrich, Struthio camelus (I)\nCassowaries and emu\nOrder: CasuariiformesFamily: Casuariidae\nThis family of flightless ratite birds is represented by two living species in Australia. Another two species are found in New Guinea. The extinct, geographically isolated King and Kangaroo Island emus were historically considered to be separate species to mainland emus. However, genetic evidence from 2011 suggests that all three are conspecific.\n*Southern cassowary, Casuarius casuarius\n*Emu, Dromaius novaehollandiae\nMagpie goose\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anseranatidae\nThe family contains a single species, the magpie goose. It was an early and distinctive offshoot of the anseriform family tree, diverging after the screamers and before all other ducks, geese and swans, sometime in the late Cretaceous. The single species is found across Australia.\n*Magpie goose, Anseranas semipalmata\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\nThe family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These are adapted for an aquatic existence, with webbed feet, bills that are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.\n*Spotted whistling-duck, Dendrocygna guttata\n*Plumed whistling-duck, Dendrocygna eytoni\n*Wandering whistling-duck, Dendrocygna arcuata\n*Cape Barren goose, Cereopsis novaehollandiae\n*Freckled duck, Stictonetta naevosa\n*Mute swan, Cygnus olor (I)\n*Black swan, Cygnus atratus\n*Radjah shelduck, Radjah radjah\n*Australian shelduck, Tadorna tadornoides\n*Green pygmy-goose, Nettapus pulchellus\n*Cotton pygmy-goose, Nettapus coromandelianus\n*Australian wood duck, Chenonetta jubata\n*Garganey, Spatula querquedula (A)\n*Australian shoveler, Spatula rhynchotis\n*Pacific black duck, Anas superciliosa\n*Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos (I)\n*Grey teal, Anas gracilis\n*Chestnut teal, Anas castanea\n*Pink-eared duck, Malacorhynchus membranaceus\n*Hardhead, Aythya australis\n*Blue-billed duck, Oxyura australis (A)\n*Musk duck, Biziura lobata\nMegapodes\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Megapodiidae\nMegapodiidae are represented by various species in the Australasian region.
