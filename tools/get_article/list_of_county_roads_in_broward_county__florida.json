All county roads are maintained by the county in which they reside, although not all routes are marked with standard county road shields.  County roads are maintained by Broward Public Works.\nCounty Road 5A\n|formed=\n}}\nCounty Road 5A is the unsigned designation along Dixie Highway in Hallandale Beach, Hollywood, and Dania Beach.\nRoute description\nCR 5A begins at NE 215th Street on the Broward/Miami-Dade County line in Hallandale Beach.  From here, CR 5A heads north with northbound lanes running along SE First Avenue and southbound lanes running along Dixie Highway. The northbound and southbound lanes run beside each other with the Florida East Coast Railway running between them for most of its route.  It continues north through Hallandale Beach and Hollywood.  In Dania Beach, northbound traffic crosses the Florida East Coast Railway at Sheridan Street (SR 822) and both north and soundbound lanes reconnect on Dixie Highway.  Dixie Highway then turns northeast away from the railroad corridor.  CR 5A then comes to its northern terminus at U.S. Highway 1 (US 1) in Dania Beach.\nHistory\nThe road was originally part of the historic Dixie Highway which came into existence in the early 1900s.  The Dixie Highway would be the main north-south road through the area until it was replaced by U.S. Route 1 (US 1) a few blocks to the east in the 1920s.  The road would also be designated as State Road 173 (SR 173) until the 1945 Florida State Road renumbering.  After that, it became SR 5A, an auxiliary route to US 1 (which carries the hidden designation SR 5).  The route was turned over to county control in the 1990s.\nMajor junctions\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of SR&nbsp;824\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n}}\n}}\nCounty Road 811\n}}\nCounty Road 811 is the 0.5-mile northern extension of State Road 811 in Deerfield Beach.\nCounty Road 811A\n}}\nCounty Road 811A is Andrews Avenue through Downtown Fort Lauderdale north to Pompano Beach.\nCounty Road 814\n}}\nCounty Road 814 is the westernmost 6 miles of Atlantic Boulevard in Coral Springs.\nCounty Road 816\n}}\nCounty Road 816 is the westernmost 4 miles of Oakland Park Boulevard in Sunrise.\nCounty Road 818\n}}\nCounty Road 818 is the westernmost 7.5 miles of Griffin Road near Pembroke Pines.\nCounty Road 822\n}}\nCounty Road 818 is a nearly 12 mile segment of Sheridan Street in Pembroke Pines and Hollywood.\nCounty Road 823\n}}\nCounty Road 823 is a nearly 4 mile northern segment of Flamingo Road north of Interstate 595 in Plantation and Sunrise.\nCounty Road 827\n}}\nCounty Road 827 is the former designation for Loxahatchee Road on the north side of Parkland.  Loxahatchee Road begins at US 441 in Parkland and runs northwest along the Hillsboro Canal before terminating at Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.  Previously a segment of State Road 827, it became CR 827 in 1990 when it was transferred to county control.  It has since come under control of the city of Parkland and is no longer classified on maps as CR 827.\nCounty Road 833\n}}\nCounty Road 833 is Snake Road in the Miccosukee Indian Reservation in western Broward County.\nCounty Road 834\n}}\nCounty Road 834 is the county-controlled segment of Sample Road in Coral Springs.\nCounty Road 838\n}}\nCounty Road 838 is the county-controlled segment of Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise and Plantation.\nCounty Road 840\n}}\nCounty Road 840 is the unsigned designation for West McNab Road, NW 62nd Street, and Cypress Creek Road, which runs from Tamarac to Oakland Park.\nRoute description\nCR 840 begins in Tamarac at an intersection with SR 817 (University Drive).  From here, it is known as West McNab Road and it heads east through North Lauderdale.  On the east side of North Lauderdale, West McNab Road turns southeast and crosses US 441 and Florida's Turnpike on separate overpasses.  Ramps between the two overpasses connect the road to US 441.  Once over the Turnpike, CR 840 enters Fort Lauderdale and becomes NW 62nd Street.  Less than a mile later, CR 840 intersects NW 31st Avenue and it becomes Cypress Creek Road. Cypress Creek Road continues east along the north side of Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport before coming to an intersection with SR 845 (Powerline Road).  It then crosses the South Florida Rail Corridor (Tri-Rail line) just north of Cypress Creek station before coming to an intersection with Andrews Avenue (CR 811A).  CR 840 then has an interchange with Interstate 95 before terminating at Dixie Highway (SR 811) between Oakland Park and Pompano Beach.\nAt the western terminus, West McNab Road continues west as a residential street.  At the eastern terminus, the road continues east as NE 62nd Street, a residential street.\nHistory\nPart of the route was previously SR 840.  The route of CR 840 was planned to be part Cypress Creek Expressway in the 1970s but it was never built due to funding and opposition.  In 1983, Cypress Creek Road was extended west over Florida's Turnpike and US 441 to West McNab Road.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Road continues westward without designation\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n|notes=Exit 33 on I-95}}\n|notes=Road continues eastward without designation\n}}\nCounty Road 848\n}}\nCounty Road 848 is the unsigned county-controlled segments of Stirling Road in Davie and Cooper City.

From here, it heads east through Coconut Creek.  Two miles later, Coconut Creek Parkway comes to an interchange with Florida's Turnpike.  At the intersection with SR 849 (NW 31st Avenue), which is across from the Turnpike interchange ramps, CR 912 briefly becomes Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.  CR 912 terminates just beyond the SR 849/Turnpike intersection at Blount Road, where county maintenance ends.  Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard continues east as a city street from here to SR 811 in Pompano Beach.\nHistory\nFrom 1945 until the early 1970s, Coconut Creek Parkway and Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard (both known then as Hammondville Road) were part of SR 814, which also continued eastward to State Road A1A on Atlantic Boulevard after a short zigzag involving North Dixie Highway (SR 811).  In the early 1970s, SR 814 between Florida's Turnpike and Dixie Highway was rerouted along NW 31st Avenue south to Atlantic Boulevard east.  In 1983, Atlantic Boulevard was extended west of NW 31st Avenue and SR 814 was rerouted onto the new segment of Atlantic Boulevard.  The north&ndash;south section along NW 31 Avenue was redesignated State Road 849 by Florida Department of Transportation, and Hammondville Road became Coconut Creek Parkway and was redesignated SR 912.  Around the year 2000, SR 912 was relinquished to Broward County control and converted to CR 912.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Western terminus of CR 912\n}}\n|notes=Located at same intersection as Turnpike Ramp\n}}\n|notes=Exit 67 on Turnpike\n}}\n}}\nReferences\n*[https://fdotwww.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/co-gis/countymaps/color/brow-c.pdf?sfvrsn=3dad75bf_4 FDOT Map of Broward County]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081211174129/http://www.dot.state.fl.us/planning/statistics/gis/road.shtm FDOT GIS data], accessed January 2014"
