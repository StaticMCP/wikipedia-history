The station is not accessible. It has two side platforms, located on the near sides of the Warren Street grade crossing, to serve the line's two tracks.\nHistory\nStreetcar service began when the section from Packards Corner to Chestnut Hill Avenue opened on May 26, 1900, connecting previously opened trackage to the east and west. The trackage was not in a center median (as were the earlier sections), but in a reservation between the southbound travel lane and southbound carriage lane. Between Warren Street and Wallingford Road to the southwest, the reservation was significantly wider than the tracks. In 1960, new southbound travel lanes were built along that section; southbound traffic now crosses the B branch tracks at Warren Street.\nUntil 1983, the inbound platform had only a curb to separate passengers from the southbound travel lanes. While the line was shut down for track replacement from July 30 to September 10, 1983, the station was rebuilt with a low wall on the inbound platform to separate passengers from traffic, as well as a small shelter.\nTrack work in 2018–19, which included replacement of platform edges at several stops (not including Warren Street), triggered requirements for accessibility modifications at those stops. Planning for modifications to five B Branch stops began in 2021. In 2024, Warren Street and the other remaining non-accessible B Branch stops were added to the project. The stops at Warren Street and nearby  are to be consolidated into a single station due to their proximity and the grade south of Warren Street, which is too steep for an accessible platform. , the MBTA expects to issue the $74 million design-build contract in late 2025, with construction lasting from spring 2026 to mid-2027.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://mbta.com/stops/place-wrnst MBTA - Warren Street]\n*[https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3486685,-71.1402233,3a,75y,60.97h,90.78t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLm5lqV7oUbdk-CaXfB94-w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 Station from Warren Street on Google Maps Street View]"
