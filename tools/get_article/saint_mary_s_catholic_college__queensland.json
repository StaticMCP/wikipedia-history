The school which was founded in 1986 holds annual \"Tours of the College\" where parents can view the facilities at the college, however an appointment can be made to have a tour at any time of the year.\nThis school is operated by the Catholic Diocese of Cairns.\nIn January 2014 the school opened a $450,000 fitness centre to help students pursue a career in fitness.\nSchool houses\nSt Mary's has four houses which are named after various bishops of Cairns and its surrounding dioceses. They are as follows:\n* Cahill\n* Heavey\n* Hutchinson\n* Murray\nThese four houses compete against each in many activities, including annual Athletics and Swimming Carnivals, Cross Country and Debating. These events build up to a House Cup which is awarded at the end of each year. A house is also awarded a Participation Cup, won by house points garnered a from voluntary participation in various activities throughout the year.\nThese houses also battle out every year for the \"Best House\" award, which is given to the house with the most awarded points throughout yearly carnivals, such as Athletics Day, Cross Country and Yearly Swimming Carnival, which is held at the Woree Pool Cairns.\nNotable alumni\n*Marita Cheng, Roboticist and Entrepreneur\n*Rhys Tolhurst, Australian singer/songwriter\nSee also\n}}\n* Catholic Education Cairns\n* Catholic education in Australia\n* List of schools in Far North Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.smcc.qld.edu.au/ St Mary's Catholic College Website]"
