They can be beneficial for physicians to judge the path of a patient's recovery, for researchers to compare different management protocols and for politicians in order to find the cost-effectiveness of their decisions.\nAs an outcome measure specifically designed for spinal cord injury, the Spinal Cord Independence Measure is a tool that evaluates how safely, cheaply, and independently a patient can do basic activities of daily living.\n__TOC__\nStructure\nThe measure consists of 19 items categorized in three subscales:self care, respiration and sphincter management, and mobility.\nPsychometric property\nIts last version, SCIM III has been validated in many multicenter trials and translated into Italian, Spanish, Greek, Portuguese, Thai, Turkish and Persian languages. It has been concluded that SCIM III has the most appropriate psychometric properties for measuring functional level of spinal cord injured individuals.\nReferences"
