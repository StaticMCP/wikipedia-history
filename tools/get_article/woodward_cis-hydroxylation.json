The iodinium ion is opened via SN2 reaction by acetic acid (or silver acetate) to give the first intermediate, the iodo-acetate (4).  Through anchimeric assistance, the iodine is displaced via another SN2 reaction to give an oxonium ion (5), which is subsequently hydrolyzed to the give the mono-ester (6).\nThe mechanism of the Woodward cis-hydroxylation\nReferences\nSee also\n* Prévost reaction"
