She received her undergraduate degree in business from Pace University. In 1998, after a career as an administrator for a major New York bank, Edwards was introduced to handmade book arts.

Following the successful reception of its 2003 exhibit, Edwards formally organized the group. The collective focused on creating unique books that highlighted aspects of African American history and achievement. \"We are not trying to write an encyclopedia. We write a few sentences to steer people in the right direction, and to say, this was one man and he made one heck of a contribution,\" Edwards told one reporter.\nProfessionally, members included art and music teachers, computer specialists, crafters, dollmakers, event planners, illustrators, librarians, photographers, and mixed media artists.

In 2008, the young people collected recipes and created a limited-edition cookbook titled “What’s Cookin? Recipes of the Elders.\"\nElectrified by the election of President Barack Obama, eight young people in the Scholarship Incentive Awards Program created an artists' book inspired by their hopes for the new leader. Each participant wrote a personal letter expressing their hopes to the president. Each focused on a specific topic and created the accompanied illustrations. The participants included Tara E. Davis (the economy), Samantha M. Medina (education), Matthew Salmon (health care), Anthony Purnell (war), Newton V. Salmon (domestic energy), Shaneice Silvera (global warming), Quinten Campbell (international relations) and Bryce Campbell (racial harmony). Edward instructed the participants and designed the 30-foot long accordion book.\nDeborah Willis, co-author of the book Obama: The Historic Campaign in Photographs, met with the group and helped raised funds for the project.  Over several months the teens handmade sixteen copies of the accordion-fold book.\nIn August 2009, during Co-op City's annual National Night Out, Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr. and Congressman Joseph Crowley joined Edwards and the teens to unfurl and display the 30-foot long book to festival attendees. Crowley's office was instrumental in delivering a copy of the book to the White House in 2010.\nIn 2014, ''President Obama's To Do List'', the artists' book Edwards and her eight young students created, was added to the Smithsonian Libraries permanent collection. Doug Litts, head of the American Art Museum/National Art Museum Library at the time, noted that “only 6 to 10 books from throughout the nation are added to the collection each year.”\nReferences\nExternal links"
