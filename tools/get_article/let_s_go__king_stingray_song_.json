The song and its music video won two National Indigenous Music Awards in 2023.\nRelease and music video\nThe song was released on 14 June 2022 by Cooking Vinyl Australia as the fifth single from their self-titled debut album. It came with a music video directed by Sam Brumby. The video consists of road trip footage on the Central Arnhem Highway, inspired by real life road trips the band took on the same road, as well as footage of the band playing in their jam space and at festivals. In a press release, the band's guitarist Roy Kellaway called the highway \"the backbone of good times\", saying that \"Whether it's packing up the Troopy Toyota Troopcarrier with dusty, half-broken band equipment and driving 12 hours to Darwin for a gig, or just going bush to enjoy the great outdoors with our loved ones and friends... the Central Arnhem Highway was the big road to fun times for us growing up, and still is to this day.\"\nPromotion\nThe band performed the song live, alongside a cover of Coldplay's \"Yellow\", for Triple J's Like a Version show.\nStyle\nThe song consists of an indie rock take on the band's usual \"loose and jammy style\", with the inclusion of didgeridoo and psychedelic rock influence. The song's chorus centers the lyric \"Central Arnhem highway on my mind\".\nReception\nIn an album review Ellie Robinson from NME said \"'Let's Go' pays tribute to the outback road that links it to the rest of Australia\" calling the song the \"album highlight\" saying \"where the sharp clack of the bilma and low rumbling of the yidaki make the twangy, wah-flourished bridge feel 10 times as intoxicating.\"\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Awards for \"Let's Go\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Organisation\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Status\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2023\n| rowspan=\"2\" | National Indigenous Music Awards\n| Song of the Year\n|\n|\n|-\n| Film Clip of the Year\n|\n|\n|}\nPersonnel\n* Yirrnga Gotjiringu Yunupingu – lead vocals, composer\n* Roy Kellaway – producer, composer\n* Stuart Kellaway – composer\n* Dimathaya Burarrwanga – backing vocals\nReferences"
