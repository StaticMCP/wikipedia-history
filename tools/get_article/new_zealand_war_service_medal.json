It was awarded in addition to, and worn immediately after, the standard Commonwealth campaign awards for World War II.\nThe NZWSM was awarded for 28 days' full-time aggregated service or six months' part-time aggregated service between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945.  Service brought to an end by death on duty, or due to wounds sustained on duty, or honourable discharge as a result of such wounds, automatically qualified for award of the medal.Some 238,000 medals were issued.\nDescription\nThe obverse shows the uncrowned effigy of King George VI, facing left, with the legend \"GEORGIVS VI D:G:BR:OMN:REX F:D:IND:IMP.\"\nThe reverse has the inscription \"FOR SERVICE TO NEW ZEALAND 1939-1945\" above a fern leaf. The reverse and mount were designed by the historian and typographer Dr John Beaglehole and the wood engraver E Mervyn Taylor. It was the first distinctively ‘New Zealand' campaign medal, which was emphasised by the use of the fern leaf motif on the reverse and suspension, and the national colours of black and white in the ribbon. The use of the fern leaf motif was made at the request of the Labour party cabinet who wanted 'a fern leaf like on the All Blacks' jersey'.\nThe NZWSM was issued unnamed.\nClasps\nNone were authorised.\nNotes\nBibliography\n* Joslin, Litherland and Simpkin (eds), British Battles and Medals, (1988), Spink\n* Mussel, J (ed) - Medals Yearbook - 2015, (2014), Token Publishing\n* [http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/warrants/c1warrant.html Royal Warrant, The New Zealand War Service Medal] (1948)\n* Taprell Dorling, Captain H.
