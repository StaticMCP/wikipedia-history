Eight prime ministers have been buried in Westminster Abbey, and several more have declined that honour; 14 prime ministers have been buried in London (and only one, the Duke of Wellington, in the City of London, in St Paul's Cathedral). The majority of prime ministers (40) have been buried in England, with six in Scotland, and one, David Lloyd George, in Wales. All prime ministers have been buried on the British mainland except two, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute and Harold Wilson. Eight prime ministers who held office in the 20th century were cremated before their ashes were buried or scattered elsewhere.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Place of burial or interment\n!Image\n|-\n|Sir Robert Walpole(1676–1745)\n|Church of St Martin, Houghton, Norfolk\n|\n|-\n|Spencer Compton,1st Earl of Wilmington(1673–1743)\n|The Estate Chapel, Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire\n|\n|-\n|Henry Pelham(1694–1754)\n|All Saints' Church, Laughton, East Sussex\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Thomas Pelham-Holles,1st Duke of Newcastle(1693–1768)\n|All Saints' Church, Laughton, East Sussex\n|-\n|William Cavendish,4th Duke of Devonshire(1720–1764)\n|Derby Cathedral, Derby, Derbyshire\n|\n|-\n|John Stuart,3rd Earl of Bute(1713–1792)\n|Bute Mausoleum, St Mary's Chapel, Rothesay, Isle of Bute, Argyll and Bute\n|\n|-\n|George Grenville(1712–1770)\n|Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire\n|\n|-\n|Charles Watson-Wentworth,2nd Marquess of Rockingham(1730–1782)\n|York Minster, York, Yorkshire\n|\n|-\n|William Pitt the Elder,1st Earl of Chatham(1708–1778)\n|Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London\n|\n|-\n|Augustus FitzRoy,3rd Duke of Grafton(1735–1811)\n| St. Genevieve's Church, Euston, Suffolk\n|\n|-\n|Frederick North,Lord North(1732–1792)\n|All Saints' Church, Wroxton, Oxfordshire\n|\n|-\n|William Petty-FitzMaurice,2nd Earl of Shelburne(1737–1805)\n|All Saints' Church, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire\n|\n|-\n|William Cavendish-Bentinck,3rd Duke of Portland(1738–1809)\n|St Marylebone Parish Church, Marylebone, London\n|\n|-\n|William Pitt the Younger(1759–1806)\n|Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London\n|\n|-\n|Henry Addington(1757–1844)\n|St Mary the Virgin, Mortlake, Richmond Upon Thames, London\n|\n|-\n|William Wyndham Grenville,1st Lord Grenville(1759–1834)\n|Burnham, Buckinghamshire\n|\n|-\n|Spencer Perceval(1762–1812)\n|St Luke's Church, Charlton, London\n|\n|-\n|Robert Banks Jenkinson,2nd Earl of Liverpool(1770–1828)\n|Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, Hawkesbury Upton, South Gloucestershire\n|\n|-\n|George Canning(1770–1827)\n|Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London\n|\n|-\n|Frederick John Robinson,1st Viscount Goderich(1782–1859)\n|All Saints' Church, Nocton, Lincolnshire\n|\n|-\n|Arthur Wellesley,1st Duke of Wellington(1769–1852)\n|St Paul's Cathedral, London\n|\n|-\n|Charles Grey,2nd Earl Grey(1764–1845)\n|St Michael and all Angels Church, Howick, Northumberland\n|\n|-\n|William Lamb,2nd Viscount Melbourne(1779–1848)\n|St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield, Hertfordshire\n|\n|-\n|Sir Robert Peel(1788–1850)\n|St Peter's Church, Drayton Bassett, Staffordshire\n|\n|-\n|Lord John Russell(1792–1878)\n|St Michael's Church, Chenies, Buckinghamshire\n|\n|-\n|Edward Smith-Stanley,14th Earl of Derby(1799–1869)\n|St Mary's Church, Knowsley, Merseyside\n|\n|-\n|George Hamilton-Gordon,4th Earl of Aberdeen(1784–1860)\n|St John's Church, Stanmore, Harrow, London\n|\n|-\n|Henry John Temple,3rd Viscount Palmerston(1784–1865)\n|Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London\n|\n|-\n|Benjamin Disraeli(1804–1881)\n|St Michael and All Angels Church, Hughenden, Nr High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire\n|\n|-\n|William Ewart Gladstone(1809–1898)\n|Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London\n|\n|-\n|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil,3rd Marquess of Salisbury(1830–1903)\n|St Etheldreda's churchyard, Hatfield, Hertfordshire\n|\n|-\n|Archibald Primrose,5th Earl of Rosebery(1847–1929)\n|Dalmeny churchyard, Dalmeny, City of Edinburgh\n|\n|-\n|Arthur Balfour(1848–1930)\n|Whittingehame Church, Whittingehame, East Lothian\n|\n|-\n|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman(1836–1908)\n|Meigle churchyard, Meigle, Perth and Kinross, Angus\n|\n|-\n|H.
