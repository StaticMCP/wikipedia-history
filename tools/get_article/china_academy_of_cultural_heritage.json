It operates under the direct leadership of the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China. The China Academy of Cultural Heritage is a scientific research organization in the People's Republic of China that focuses on cultural heritage protection. It is one of the leading professional forces in the country in this field.\nMain responsibilities\nThe main responsibilities of the China Academy of Cultural Heritage include cultural heritage research, conservation, restoration, and training.\nHistory\nIn 1935, under the Nationalist Government Executive Yuan in the Ping Political Organisation Committee, \"the old capital of the cultural relics finishing committee\" was formally established. In 1949, it was renamed the \"Beijing Cultural Relics Restoration Committee\" and was transferred to the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China. In 1973, it was renamed the \"Institute of Cultural Relics Protection Science and Technology.\" In 1990, it merged with the Ancient Documents Research Office of the Ministry of Culture to become the \"Institute of Cultural Relics of China.\" In August 2007, it was renamed \"China Academy of Cultural Heritage.”\nOrganisational setup\nThe China Academy of Cultural Heritage mainly consists of seven operational departments including the Institute of Cultural Relics, the Institute of Cultural Relics Conservation and Engineering, the China World Cultural Heritage Centre, the Institute of Cultural Relics Conservation and Restoration, the Institute of Education and Training, the Documentation and Research Office (Library), and the Editorial Office of the Chinese Cultural Heritage; three managerial departments and one safeguard department. There are three other affiliations, namely the Secretariat of the ICOMOS China National Committee, the Secretariat of the Committee for Standardization of Cultural Heritage Protection, and the Secretariat of the Steering Committee for Vocational Education and Teaching in the Cultural Heritage Protection Sector.\nResearch conditions\nScientific research directions include heritage protection science, technology, and other related disciplines. In the People's Republic of China, qualifications in archaeological excavation and other related cultural relics protection are required. The laboratory space is approximately 1,600 square meters and contains 211 instruments and pieces of equipment.\nAs of 2014, the hospital had 140 staff members, including 70 with senior professional and technical qualifications. Three of these staff members have been honored by foreign governments with the Prince Claus Award of the Netherlands.
