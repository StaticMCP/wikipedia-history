      "text": "# Central Vikings Rugby Union\n\nCentral Vikings Rugby Union was a New Zealand rugby union team that played in the second division of the NPC for two seasons in 1997 and 1998. The team, formed from the merger of the Hawke's Bay and Manawatu unions, featured current and future All Blacks and a former All Black in coach Frank Oliver. It came second in its division in 1997, and first in 1998, and would have progressed to the first division. However, following financial trouble it split back into the two separate unions.\nReviving the Central Vikings as a Super Rugby team was floated in 2016, but this did not occur.\nHistory\nThe Central Vikings Rugby Union was founded in December 1996 with the merger of the Hawke's Bay and Manawatu unions. The Vikings were formed with the hopes of lifting themselves out of the 2nd division and to be competitive in the 1st division. The Central Vikings had two All Blacks in the team which included Bull Allen and Christian Cullen as well as featuring various Super 12 players such as Chiefs star Mark Ranby who later became an All Black himself. The Central Vikings finished 2nd in 1997 when they were beaten 63–10 by Northland but even if they had won, they weren't allowed to progress into the 1st division. They finished 1st in 1998 when they beat Bay of Plenty. They were subsequently allowed to progress to the 1st division. The Vikings however got into financial trouble and they split back to Hawke's Bay and Manawatu for the 1999 season.\nThe Vikings were largely hindered in their second season after not only losing All Black legend Christian Cullen but also losing the then All Blacks Coach John Hart after Hart was advised he could not coach NPC, Super Rugby and All Black teams at the same time. Despite these disadvantages the Vikings went on to win the second division and were picked to be a major force in the first division before financial problems prevented them from advancing and ultimately caused the end of the Vikings.\nWith the announcement that New Zealand might receive a 6th Super Franchise in the SANZAR Super Rugby competition beginning 2016, the Hawke's Bay union announced its interest in forming this franchise together with Manawatu, effectively resurrecting the Central Vikings brand as a Super Rugby franchise. This never came to fruition and instead Super Rugby added the South African Southern Kings, the Argentinian Jaguares and the Japanese Sunwolves.\nControversy\nIn December 1997 a special meeting of the Hawke's Bay Rugby Football Union was held to decide the future of the Central Vikings Rugby Union. Eight of the Hawke's Bay Union's 21 clubs called the meeting to seek agreement for Hawke's Bay to withdraw from the Vikings. A vote on a resolution calling for Hawke's Bay to withdraw from the combined Hawke's Bay–Manawatu team was lost, 7–12, in a secret ballot. Once the resolution was lost, HBRFU president Tom Mulligan said there was no reason for the meeting to continue. The Vikings were then given the all-clear to continue as an NPC second division rugby team.\nFixtures and results\n1997 Season\nThe Central Vikings played their first match against Fiji in Palmerston North on June 2, 1997.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| Date\n| Comp\n| Home team\n| Score\n| Away team\n| Score\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 02-05-97\n| PS\n|  Central Vikings\n| 10\n|  Fiji\n| 19\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 06-08-97\n| PS\n|  Central Vikings\n| 38\n|  Wellington\n| 21\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 23-08-97\n| NPC\n|  Central Vikings\n| 72\n|  Thames Valley\n| 0\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 30-08-97\n| NPC\n|  Wanganui\n| 6\n|  Central Vikings\n| 42\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 06-09-97\n| NPC\n|  King Country\n| 35\n|  Central Vikings\n| 41\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 13-09-97\n| NPC\n|  Central Vikings\n| 90\n|  Nelson Bays\n| 21\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 20-09-97\n| NPC\n|  South Canterbury\n| 7\n|  Central Vikings\n| 87\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 26-09-97\n| NPC\n|  Northland\n| 42\n|  Central Vikings\n| 13\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 03-10-97\n| NPC\n|  Central Vikings\n| 10\n|  Bay of Plenty\n| 31\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 11-10-97\n| NPC\n|  Central Vikings\n| 95\n|  Wairarapa Bush\n| 12\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\n| 19-10-97\n| NPC\n|  Bay of Plenty\n| 6\n|  Central Vikings\n| 29\n!
