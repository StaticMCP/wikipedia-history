      "text": "# 2018 Dominican presidential election\n\nAn indirect presidential election was held on 1 October 2023 to elect the next President of Dominica. Incumbent President Charles Savarin was re-elected.\nHistory\nCharles Savarin was first elected president on 30 September 2013.\nThe Constitution of Dominica stipulates the presidential nomination process. Firstly, the prime minister and opposition leader are to come together in an attempt to produce a joint presidential nominee. If this fails, the two are to nominate their own candidates, with House of Assembly also being able to nominate candidates. The nomination period is to last 14 days after the Speaker informs the House of its beginning. Following this period, the House of Assembly is to vote for president.\nPrime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit claimed he had wrote to Opposition Leader Lennox Linton on 3 August 2018 about his intention to renominate president Savarin. Skerrit further claimed Linton responded that he was going to solicit names for nominations of his own, but that Linton did not respond further after this. After Lennox's failure to produce a candidate, by 28 September, Skerritt claimed the government was going to proceed with the presidential election on 1 October.\nThe opposition United Workers' Party (UWP) claimed the election was unconstitutional. The Speaker had informed the House of the beginning of the nomination period on 20 September. To comply with the constitution, the UWP argued the election would have to be held after 4 October, to allow for the 14 day nomination period. Skerrit argued that by doctrine of necessity, it was permissible to hold the presidential election before the expiration of the president's term.\nThe election was held on 1 October, despite opposition claims of unconstitutionality. All 20 House members of the government Dominican Labour Party (DLP) voted for President Savarin. The UWP members staged a walkout in protest of the election.\nSavarin was sworn in on 2 October.\nResults\nReferences"
