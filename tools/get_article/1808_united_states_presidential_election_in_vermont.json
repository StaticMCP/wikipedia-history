The state legislature chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDuring this election, Vermont cast its six electoral votes to Democratic Republican candidate and Secretary of State James Madison. As the other four New England states cast their electoral votes for Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Vermont became the only state in New England to vote for Madison.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Vermont\nReferences"
