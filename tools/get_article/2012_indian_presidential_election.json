On 15 June, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) announced Pranab Mukherjee as its presidential candidate.\nThere were signs of a split within the Janata Dal (United) with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar saying that \"like the other constituents, the JD (U) too will abide by the final decision on the presidential poll,\" though Shivanand Tiwari said that \"a senior and respected leader like Pranab Mukherjee, who is going into retire [from active politics] should be given a graceful send off.\" Tiwari added that \"[Mukherjee] is a very senior and a respected leader, and my personal opinion is that as he should be elected to the president's post with consensus.\" The Shiv Sena supported Mukherjee's candidates according to its spokesman Sanjay Raut.\nOn 18 June, Kalam said he would not run in the race following statement from JDU leader Nitish Kumar and SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav that they would prefer to support Mukherjee. Following Kalam's decision, the BJP-led NDA turned to supporting Sangma.\nUnofficial list\nThe final candidacy application had 45 names.

Ahmed and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's T. R. Baalu. The Hindustan Times suggested that he also had the support of the National Democratic Alliance's Janata Dal (United) and the Shiv Sena, as well as the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Mukherjee said after filing his nomination papers that \"I only wish at this time that we have the blessing of god and cooperation of all at this juncture.\" P. A. Sangma filed his nomination papers with the support of the Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, BJP party president Nitin Gadkari and party leaders Lal Krishna Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, as well as the INC's Arvind Netam, who is the head of the Tribal Forum of India which supported Sangma. Prior to filing his nomination with the Rajya Sabha Secretary General V. K. Agnihotri he said that \"today is a victory of tribal unity, that a tribal is filing his nomination for the post of president.\"\nElectoral votes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Party/Alliance\n!

I have received much more than I have given.\" He also said he would \"protect, defend and preserve [the Constitution of India. I will try to justify in a modest way as I can to be trustworthy.\" He was also congratulated by his former party colleagues Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, as well as Vice-President Hamid Ansari and BJP President Nitin Gadkari.\nWhile Sangma congratulated Mukherjee he also added: \"The process in this Presidential election has been exceptionally partisan and political. The public perception is certainly that in identification and projection of its candidate, the UPA did not genuinely build consensus and that it persuaded political parties commanding major sections of the presidential electoral college by economic and other packages...as well as inducements, threats and promises. For election to the Lok Sabha and Assembly, there is a code of conduct for free and fair elections. Such a code of conduct does not exist for presidential and vice-presidential elections...Rs. 57,000 crore were given to U.P., Rs 27,000 crore to Bihar and so many other things have happened. We are meeting a day after tomorrow to review the whole situation where this matter will come up for discussion.\" He also added that this was an opportunity lost to elect a tribal candidate as president. INC spokesman Manish Tewari responded in saying: \"Magnanimity should mark the conduct of people, who contest elections. Gritting after losing an election only endorses the proverb that grapes are sour [when you cannot reach them];\" its General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi added to criticism of Sangma's allegations that \"I think one should not talk with such a narrow vision.\"\nIn response to cross-voting against party lines as Mukherjee had support from 98 MLAs of the INC and JDS yet won with 19 extra votes and the Sangma got only 103 votes of BJP's 119 MLAs, Karnataka BJP General Secretary Dharmendra Pradhan said that \"the party is taking this matter very seriously. The Central leadership has asked the Karnataka BJP unit to form a committee to probe this cross-voting by our MLAs. Once we get the committee's report we will take appropriate action.\" The issue also follows infighting within the Karnataka BJP that culminated in the recent appointment of Jagadish Shettar as chief minister.\nAnti-corruption activist group Team Anna criticised Mukherjee in saying the country now had a \"corrupt president.\" Biocon CEO Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said of the election: \"We are making a mockery of the presidential post. This is considered the highest office in our country and should be apolitical. The president should be an apolitical appointee who has the stature and integrity that can hold the political system accountable. How can persons who are in office, holding key ministerial posts, be even eligible for such a post? This is becoming a political chess game which is devaluing this very lofty post.\"\nSee also\n* 2012 Indian vice presidential election\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/presi_elec2012.aspx Election Commission information on the presidential election]\n* [http://164.100.47.5/pres2012/ Official Website of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat for the Presidential Election]\n;Media\n* [http://www.indianexpress.com/fullcoverage/presidential-poll/444/ Presidential poll 2012: Full Coverage] collected news and commentary at The Indian Express\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120507060849/http://ibnlive.in.com/features/raceforpresident.html Next President: Race for President, 2012] collected news and commentary at CNN-IBN\n* [https://indiatoday.intoday.in/gallery/presidential-polls-2012/1/6832.html Coming up: Presidential Polls 2012]"
