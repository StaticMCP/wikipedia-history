The golden frame of the shield comes into stylized image of a fir tree on the left and a pine tree on the right. In the upper part of the shield there is an octagonal star (doubled cross) of gold. The arms were created by .\nThe current coat of arms of Karelia has much resemblance with the coat of arms of the independent Republic of Uhtua, the national symbol of East Karelia created by Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The main difference is that the bear was holding a billhook. The shield had the traditional Varangian colours and there were polar lights above of shield.\nHistory\nThe 11th Extraordinary Congress of the Soviets of Karelia on 16–17 June 1937 adopted the Constitution of the Karelian ASSR on 17 June 1937. The Chapter 10 of the Constitution contained the description of the symbols of the republic. The coat of arms of the Karelian ASSR was similar to the emblem of the Russian SFSR. The only difference is that the inscriptions were in Russian, Karelian, and Finnish.\nFirst revision\nAt a meeting of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Karelian ASSR on 29 December 1937, it was decided to remove the Finnish language inscription in the emblem. This happened due to the reprisals against the Finns in the Karelian ASSR in the second half of 1937.\nPromotion to SSR and re-demotion to ASSR\nOn 8 July 1940, the Karelian ASSR was re-organized as the Karelo-Finnish SSR. The SSR was given a new emblem.\nOn 16 July 1956, the Karelo-Finnish SSR was demoted into the Karelian ASSR.\nSecond revision\nThe coat of arms of the Karelian ASSR was described in the Article 111 of the Constitution of 1956, which was adopted on 20 August 1956, at the 4th session of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian ASSR. The emblem was similar with the emblem of the Russian SFSR, but was supplemented with the motto in Finnish : Kaikkien maiden proletaarit, liittykää yhteen!\nThe Finnish language was restored as the official language as the Karelian ASSR, replacing the Karelian language.\nThird revision\nThe 1978 Constitution of the Karelian ASSR confirmed the emblem and the flag of the republic on the article 157 and 158. Some changes were made to the inscriptions, with the name of the Karelian ASSR in Finnish was added.\nRegulations on the emblem were adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian ASSR in 1981.\nGallery\nGerb Karelskoy ASSR 1937.png|Emblem of the Karelian ASSR (1937–1940)\nEmblem of the Karelo-Finnish SSR.svg|Emblem of the Karelo-Finnish SSR (1940–1956)\nGerb Karelskoy ASSR 1956-1978.png|Emblem of the Karelian ASSR (1956–1978)\nCoat of arms of Karelian ASSR.svg|Emblem of the Karelian ASSR (1978–1991) and the Republic of Karelia (1991–1993)\nSources\n* Constitution of the Republic of Karelia, paragraph 13.\n* [http://gov.karelia.ru/gov/gerb_e.html The official site of the republic]\nReferences\nSee also\n* Coat of arms of the Province of Karelia in Finland\n* Emblem of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic\n* Coat of Arms of the Governorate of Finland\n* Republic of Uhtua\n* Kalevala, Russia"
