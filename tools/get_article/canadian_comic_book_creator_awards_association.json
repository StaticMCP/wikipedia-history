An additional award, the Outstanding Canadian retailer award is named after Harry Kremer the late owner of Now & Then Books in Kitchener, Ontario.\nOverview\nThe organization consists of an administrative (or executive) committee, a series of nominating committees and juries.\nThe only provision for active membership in any of the nominating committees or the administrative committee is that the member not be actively creating or publishing comic books, webcomics or graphic novels that could be eligible for consideration for any of the existing categories during the judging period. Eligible publishers and creators may participate in the special judging committee for the Harry Kremer comic book retailer award.\nThe Association is a not-for-profit organization. Funds for the Joe Shuster Awards are raised from donations, sponsorship and eBay auctions of prints and other specialty items.\nIn late 2007, the CCBCAA membership ratified an organizational charter, the position of Executive Director and Associate Director were created (supplanting Chairperson and Assistant). Directors of the CCBCAA are voted into their positions for two award seasons, unless they vacate the position prior to the end of term.\nIn 2008 a new fundraising initiative was launched entitled \"Visions of an Icon\". The Visions project involves the donation of original art interpretations of a single comic book character by Canadian artists and cartoonists. The pieces are displayed on a few occasions and then auctioned off on eBay to raise funds for the next year's awards. In 2008 the subject was Superman and in 2009 the subject was Wolverine. The Visions program was suspended in 2010.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.joeshusterawards.com Joe Shuster Awards website]"
