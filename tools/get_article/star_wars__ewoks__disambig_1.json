The series was co-produced by Canada-based Nelvana Limited on behalf of Lucasfilm and broadcast on ABC from September 7, 1985 to December 13, 1986, with its sister series Droids (as part of The Ewoks and Droids Adventure Hour), and then by itself, as The All-New Ewoks.\nPremise\nThe series centers on the adventures of Wicket W. Warrick and his friends on the forest moon of Endor before the events of the original Star Wars film and Caravan of Courage. The primary recurring villains are Morag the Tulgah Witch, who had a personal grudge against the tribe's shaman, Master Logray, and the Duloks, a rival species.}}\nThe penultimate episode, \"Battle for the Sunstar\", which was reaired as the series finale, shows the Ewok heroes leaving the forest moon's surface when they go aboard an Imperial Star Destroyer that has traveled to their system. An Imperial scientist attempts to destroy the Emperor, whose shuttle makes an appearance. The episode has been noted as forming a link with Return of the Jedi, which features the Empire using Endor as its base of operations for the second Death Star.\nCast and characters\nThe Ewok tribe\nWarrick family\n* Wicket Wystri Warrick (voiced by Jim Henshaw then Denny Delk) – The youngest brother of the Warrick Family.

The series ran for two seasons of 13 half-hour episodes between 1985 and 1986 and was later shown in reruns on Sci-Fi Channel's Cartoon Quest.\nAlmost all of the episodes (except for \"The Three Lessons\"  and \"Prow Beaten / Baga's Rival\") were released on VHS in the 1980s and 1990s, most notably the UK PAL releases over six cassettes (Ewoks 1–6), which had the opening sequences and credits edited out. On April 2, 2021, the entire series was released on Disney+.\nDuring the making of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, its producer, Rick McCallum, oversaw two direct-to-video compilation films, each compiled from four episodes of the series. The first, The Haunted Village, was released on VHS in 1997. The second, Tales from the Endor Woods, was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 2004 on a DVD titled Star Wars: Animated Adventures – Ewoks (which also features The Haunted Village). The newer film includes narration from \"Adult Wicket\" (voiced by Alex Lindsay).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! Title\n! Content\n!

SyFy Wire calls the series \"more a marketing ploy for Lucasfilm than a worthwhile extension of the franchise ... designed to sell toys, cereals, and action figures\", though mentions that it \"featured a few surprisingly entertaining installments that appealed to both parents and kids, particularly the penultimate episode, 'Battle for the Sunstar.'\"\nLegacy\nElements from the series are featured in Star Wars reference media, such as A Guide to the Star Wars Universe and the Star Wars Encyclopedia. A Dulok was shown on Coruscant in Chapter 21 of the 2D animated Clone Wars (2003). Ewoks was excluded from canon status in 2014, but some elements appear in the canon Ultimate Star Wars (2015) and later reference books, as well as the canon web series Star Wars Forces of Destiny (2018).\nThe series' opening titles are briefly featured in an episode of Stranger Things fourth season (2022).\nMerchandising and media\nAction figures\nIn 1985, Kenner Products produced a series of action figures based on the series. A second wave of figures were prototyped but ultimately cancelled due to poor sales of the initial wave. Several previously released Ewok themed vehicles, play sets, and accessories were advertised on the card backs of the figures but were curiously never offered in Ewoks Cartoon branded packaging.\nComics\nIn 1985, Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel, published a bi-monthly Ewoks comic based on the animated series. It ran for two years, with a total of 14 issues. Like the TV series, it was aimed towards a younger audience and produced parallel to a comic spun off from Droids. Issue #10 of Ewoks continued the \"Lost in Time\" crossover story from Droids #4. Additionally, Spanish comics publisher Editorial Gepsa produced two-page Ewoks comics as part of an anthology series.\nReferences\nFootnotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\nFurther reading\n* Star Wars Insider #27\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://www.rebelscum.com/droids-ewoks.asp A history of home video releases of Ewoks]\n*"
