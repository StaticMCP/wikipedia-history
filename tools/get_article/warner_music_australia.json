Records split and WEA was formed. It was first established in Canada and followed by Australia. The Australian operation began in July 1970, by Paul Turner with five staff members. The official launch was held at the Menzies Hotel in Sydney on 1 October 1970. The company was then based in Riley Street, Darlinghurst, and had three major labels: Warner Bros. Records, Elektra Records, and Atlantic Records\nA year later Warner Bros. Records worldwide (including Australia) changed its name to Kinney Music. The monopoly laws in America at the time did not allow the three labels to trade as one, so the umbrella name of Kinney Music was chosen. For the first two years, the Australian Record Company (ARC), now known as Sony Music, handled the Australian distribution.\nTurner's income for the first year was 1 million dollars. That was achieved in seven months, with the first years sales being just under $2 million. By 1 October 1972, U.S. monopoly laws had changed and WEA, using the first initial of each of the three main labels for its name, was born. From that time, WEA Australia had its own sales and distribution arm.\nWEA became a major player in the Australian recording industry, through international successes of artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin and The Doors.\nThe company was renamed Warner Music Australia in 1990 and split into two divisions – WEA and East-West Records. With more focus being placed on domestic signings, phenomenal success was achieved with acts such as INXS, Cold Chisel, 1927 and Jenny Morris.\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Warner Music also invested in Brisbane bands, Regurgitator and Pretty Violet Stain. Regurgitator became Warner Music's first direct signing and remained with the company until 2004. In 2005, Sire Records invested in Brisbane band The Veronicas, who went straight to number two with their debut single \"4 Ever\" and their album \"The Secret Life of the Veronicas\".  Later that year, Warner Music Australia bought out Festival-Mushroom Records for $12 million and closed the label, while retaining the use of the Mushroom label for a couple of acts such as Eskimo Joe and Gabriella Cilmi.\n, the company has continued with artists such as Kerser, Lisa Mitchell, Kylie Minogue, the New Zealand band, Evermore, as well as the newly signed Brisbane act, Dead Letter Circus. Warner Music also invested heavily in producers such as ShockOne and Matt Lange.\nArtists\n* A Boogie wit da Hoodie\n* A Day to Remember\n* Arizona\n* AB6IX\n* Alec Benjamin\n* Ali Gatie\n* All Time Low\n* Angel Dust\n* Anitta\n* Anne Marie\n* Aretha Franklin\n* Asher\n* Ashley McBryde\n* Ashnikko\n* Ava Max\n* BabyT\n* Bazzi\n* BBG Smokey\n* Bebe Rexha\n* Ben Abraham\n* Bhad Bhabie\n* Biffy Clyro\n* Billie Joe Armstrong\n* Billy Talent\n* Birdy\n* Blake Shelton\n* Breland\n* Briston Maroney\n* Bronson (Odesza and Golden Features)\n* Bruno Mars\n* Bryce Vine\n* Budjerah\n* Burna Boy\n* Busby Marou\n* Cardi B\n* Carlie Hanson\n* Cavetown\n* Cecily\n* Charli XCX\n* Charlie Puth\n* Chase Zera\n* Cher\n* Clean Bandit\n* Client Liaison\n* Code Orange\n* Coheed & Cambria\n* Coldplay\n* Corey Taylor\n* Creeper\n* Daine\n* Dan + Shay\n* David Bowie\n* David Guetta\n* Deftones\n* Diplo\n* Disturbed\n* Don Toliver\n* Dua Lipa\n* Dutchavelli\n* Eagles\n* East AV3\n* Eco$ystem\n* Ed Sheeran\n* Ekali\n* Elderbrook\n* Eskimo Joe\n* E^ST\n* Faith No More\n* Faouzia\n* Feki\n* Fever 333\n* Fitz and the Tantrums\n* Fleetwood Mac\n* Flowerkid\n* Foals\n* Galantis\n* Galxara\n* Glades\n* Gojira\n* Golden Features\n* Goo Goo Dolls\n* Gorillaz\n* Grandma\n* Greenday\n* Griff\n* Grouplove\n* Gucci Mane\n* Halestorm\n* Hamilton\n* Hamzaa\n* Harper Finn\n* Hartley\n* Hayley Kiyoko\n* Hayley Williams\n* Higher Power\n* Highly Suspect\n* Hobo Johnson\n* Hooligan Hefs\n* Honne\n* In This Moment\n* Illy\n* Iron Maiden\n* J Rick\n* Jack Gray\n* Jack Harlow\n* James Blunt\n* Janelle Monae\n* Jason Derulo\n* JC Stewart\n* Jess Glynne\n* John Williamson\n* JoJo\n* Josh Groban\n* Joyous Wolf\n* Jubël\n* Jxdn\n* JXN\n* k.d lang\n* Kaleo\n* Kehlani\n* Kelly Clarkson\n* Killboy\n* Kinder\n* Kita Alexander\n* Korn\n* Kranium\n* Kyle\n* Kylie Minogue\n* L Devine\n* Lara Andallo\n* Led Zeppelin\n* Liam Gallagher\n* Lianne La Havas\n* Lil Jaye\n* Lil Pump\n* Lil Skies\n* Lil Zay Osama\n* Linkin Park\n* Lizzo\n* Lukas Graham\n* Mac Miller\n* Mahalia\n* Maisie Peters\n* Major Lazer\n* Marina Diamandis\n* Master KG\n* Mastedon\n* Matoma\n* Matt Maeson\n* Meek Mill\n* Melanie Martinez\n* Michael Buble\n* Missy Elliot\n* Mist\n* MisterWives\n* Monique Lawz\n* Morgan Evans\n* Motionless in White\n* Muse\n* My Chemical Romance\n* Nasty Cherry\n* Nathan Dawe\n* Needtobreathe\n* Neil Young\n* Nickelback\n* NLE Choppa\n* No Comply\n* Nomad\n* Nothing, Nowhere.\n* Oliver Tree\n* One Ok Rock\n* Pa Salieu\n* Panic!
