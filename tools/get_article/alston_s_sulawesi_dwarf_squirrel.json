It is endemic to the island of Sulawesi and is thought to be restricted to the lowland forests found on the eastern side of the island. It is threatened by habitat destruction, as tree cover in forests where it is found has been removed throughout the 2000s and 2010s in mining and logging operations.\nReferences"
