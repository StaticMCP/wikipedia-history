Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia. The theater shows a 4D film during the general operating day of the theme park which is currently Tom & Jerry 4D Experience. A replica exists at Movie Park Germany in Bottrop, Germany.\nHistory\nThe first Roxy Theatre was installed at Warner Bros. Movie World ahead of the park's opening on 3 June 1991. A replica was later built at Movie Park Germany (which was known as Warner Bros. Movie World Germany at the time). In 2005, the theater underwent a major refurbishment which included the installation of 4D motion seats.\nTheatre\nThe Roxy Theatre is located in Main Street at Warner Bros. Movie World. Guests queue outside the theater and enter a preshow room before they see their film. The preshow room then leads into the main theatre which seats 320 people. The seats which have motion capabilities were designed by FX Illusions.\nFilms\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Film !! Provider !! Opened !! Closed !!
