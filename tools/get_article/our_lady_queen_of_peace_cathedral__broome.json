The tower and other modifications were completed in April 1904.\nIn early 1960, the old church of wood and iron needed repairs. The poor state of the church, combined with the fact that the building was too small for the growing community of faithful, led to the decision to build a new church for the town.\nStan Costello, originally from Perth, was commissioned to design the new church of Broome. Construction of the building, adjacent to the site of the old church, began in April 1963 and was completed in September of the same year.\nSee also\n*Roman Catholicism in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links"
