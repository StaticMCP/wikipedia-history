It is situated on Cosme Velho Street, near the Cosme Velho Station of the Corcovado Train.\nHistory\nThe fountain was constructed in the 19th century to channel water from a nearby spring. It was named \"Bica da Rainha\" (Queen's Fountain) in honor of the visits by Queen Maria I of Portugal. The monument was listed as a historical heritage site by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938.\nSince the 18th century, the site has been visited by people who believed that the water had healing properties, such as curing anemia. This belief attracted the attention of Carlota Joaquina of Spain, who began frequenting the fountain. Carlota Joaquina reportedly recommended the place to her mother-in-law, Queen Maria I, who also started visiting the area. As a result, the locals began calling the fountain \"Bica da Rainha\" (Queen's Fountain).\nIn 2014, the Queen's Fountain underwent a restoration of its original landscape architecture project. The initiative, led by Bem Verde & Horta e Jardim, reconstituted the original garden with plants from the flora of Brazil.\nSee also\n*Cosme Velho\n*Carlota Joaquina of Spain\n*Maria I of Portugal\n*National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://prefeitura.rio/ City of Rio de Janeiro - prefeitura.rio]\n*[http://www.rio.rj.gov.br/web/riotur Tourism Company of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro - RIOTUR]\n*[http://portal.iphan.gov.br/ Home - IPHAN - National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]"
