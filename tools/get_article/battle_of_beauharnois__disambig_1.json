Edward Ellice, private secretary to John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, had then been in residence for several months. He, and, separately, his wife, Lady Jane Ellice, and her sister, Eglantine \"Tina\" Balfour, later Ellice, were taken prisoner, along with a number of others. Ellice's watercolours, sketches and diary survived, and record that they were unharmed.\nThe town rose up, following a series of raids by rebel leaders who had escaped into the United States. François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier commanded the ranks of the Patriote rebels. The British were victorious, and 108 rebels were captured and tried in Montreal. 58 of the Patriote rebels were deported to Australia, while Lorimier was hanged.\nGovernment forces burned several buildings in the area in reprisal for the rebels’ actions.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Lower Canada Rebellion"
