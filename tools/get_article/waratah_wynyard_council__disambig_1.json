Waratah-Wynyard is classified as a rural local government area and has a population of 13,800, the major towns and localities of the region include Savage River, Sisters Beach, Somerset, Waratah and the principal town of Wynyard.\nHistory and attributes\nOn 2 April 1993, the municipalities of Waratah and Wynyard were amalgamated to form the Waratah–Wynyard Council. There had been suggestion of renaming the council to Table Cape, which was the former name of the Wynyard Council until 1945, but this move failed at the ballot box.\nWaratah-Wynyard is classified as rural, agricultural and very large under the Australian Classification of Local Governments.\nLogo\nWaratah-Wynyard Council logo (1987–2017)\nThe former logo of the council was selected from 124 competition entries in 1987. The enlarged \"W\" below Table Cape is indicative of ploughed paddocks representing the rural heritage – a lighthouse and a seagull were added to the final design. The word \"Waratah\" was added in 1993 following the amalgamation of the councils.\nGovernment\nThe current mayor is Mary Duniam and the current deputy mayor is Celisa Edwards. Other sitting councillors are Kevin Hyland, Michael Johnstone, Leanne Raw, Andrea Courtney, Gary Bramich and Dillon Roberts.
