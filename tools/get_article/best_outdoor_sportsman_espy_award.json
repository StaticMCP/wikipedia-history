It was first presented as part of the ESPY Awards at the 2002 edition after broadcaster ESPN purchased the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society in mid-2001. The Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY Award trophy, designed by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, was given to the outdoor sportsperson adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year. From the 2004 to 2008 ceremonies, the winner was chosen by online voting through choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee. Before that, determination of the winners was made by an panel of experts. Through the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in July and reflect performance from the June previous.\nThe inaugural winner of the Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY Award in 2002 was American bass angler Kevin VanDam. During 2001 and 2002, he won the Bassmaster Classic XXXI, the 2001 Wal-Mart FLW Championship, and attained the rank of the top-ranked angler worldwide during that period. VanDam became the first of two bass anglers to be nominated, and hence to win, an ESPY Award. Bass anglers have been the most successful sportspeople (with two victories and eight nominations) with the win of Jay Yelas at the 2003 iteration. It was presented to one woman in its history, logroller Tina Bosworth, in the 2004 edition. The winner of the Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY Award in 2005 was lumberjacker J. R. Salzman after winning 14 medals at the Great Outdoor Games and claimed five logrolling titles at the Lumberjack World Championship between 1998 and 2005. After that, the accolade was partially replaced by the Best Angler ESPY Award for the 2006 edition before returning the next year. It was permanently discontinued after the 2008 ceremony.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+ Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY Award winners and nominees\n! scope=col |Year\n! scope=col class=unsortable| Image\n! scope=col | Athlete\n! scope=col | Nationality\n! scope=col | Sport\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Nominees\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Refs\n|-\n| 2002\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Bass angling\n| align=left | Rick Clunn () – Bass anglingJerry \"the big air dog\" () – Dock jumpingMel Lentz () – Lumberjacking\n|\n|-\n| 2003\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Bass angling\n| align=left | Jerry Day/Super Sue () – Field trialJerry Miculek () – ShootingMike Jackson/Little Morgan () – Dock jumpingSheree Taylor () – Timber endurance\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Log rolling\n| align=left | Denny Brauer () – Bass anglingMichael Iaconelli () – Bass anglingGerald Swindle () – Bass angling\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Lumberjacking\n| align=left | Aaron Martens () – Bass anglingTakahiro Omori () – Bass anglingSheree Taylor () – Timber endurance\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n|\n! scope=row|\n|\n| Ultramarathon\n| align=left | Michael Iaconelli () – Bass anglingSamantha Larson () – MountaineeringLance Mackey () – MushingIan McKeever () – Mountaineering\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n| Mountaineering\n| align=left | Dave Hahn () – MountaineeringLance Mackey () – MushingSkeet Reese () – Bass anglingSkip Storch () – Swimming\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Bassmaster Classic\n* Great Outdoor Games\n* Lumberjack World Championships\n* Sport fishing\nNotes and references\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
