Born into a family of Scottish seafarers, Murdoch arrived in the Gilberts in the early 1880s and never returned to Scotland. Learning the Gilbertese language, Murdoch became a successful independent trader. He was a one-time commercial manager for Tem Binoka and served as an overseer for Gilbertese labourers in Guatemala. Murdoch married twice to Gilbertese women and had 10 children.\nEarly life\nAccounts of Murdoch's early life vary widely. According to John Horwood, George McGhie Murdoch was the only child of Charles Donaldson Murdoch (18291860), a Scottish sea captain, and Agnes Armstrong (18341864). Agnes, like most captains' wives at the time, often accompanied her husband on his voyages. Murdoch was born on 13 August 1860, during a stopover in Plymouth, England. While his father continued on with his crewand was ultimately lost at sea that Novemberhe and his mother stayed behind in Plymouth before returning to Scotland.\nAfter his mother died on 17 March 1864, Murdoch lived with his paternal grandmother, Jane Murdoch (), at their family cottage in Kippford. It was a small village with a shipyard on the Urr Water, near the busy ports of Dalbeattie. Family members, most of whom were in the seafaring trade, came and went. Murdoch likely received little formal education. When he was sixteen, he was apprenticed to a nearby painting firm. Sometime after his grandmother died in 1789, Murdoch signed on to a trading ship that crossed the Pacific.\nAccording to Arthur Grimble, George McGhee Murdoch was born in Greenock in 1857.\nAccounts differ on how Murdoch found himself marooned on Abemama in the early 1880s. Abemama is in the Gilbert Islands (now part of Kiribati), a remote archipelago in the Central Pacific. One story, purportedly from Murdoch himself, has him the only witness to a murder committed by the captain, who told him to stay silent, under pain of death, before abandoning him on the next remote island.\nMercantile career\nMurdoch survived by living alongside the Gilbertese people on Abemama and learning their language. He boarded a passing trade vessel which sailed north to Maiana. Robert Corrie, an older Englishman who traded on Maiana, recruited Murdoch as a bookkeeper and storekeeper. Corrie improved Murdoch's literacy and writing using a Bible as a textbook and developed his arithmetic. Murdoch became lifelong friends with his mentor.\nAfter saving up for a while, Murdoch became an independent trader and started frequenting other atolls on trading voyages. By 1884, Murdoch had moved to Tarawa and was trading on Betio. He married Takeiti, a Gilbertese woman from Tarawa, and their first child, Agnes, was born in 1885. Wary of Tarawa's constant indigenous warfare, Murdoch briefly returned to Maiana in June 1886 before relocating to Abemama with his family.\nAbemama was attractive to Europeans as the greatest copra producer in the Gilbert Islands. In contrast the volatile politics of islands such as Tarawa, traders only had to deal with one absolute monarch, Tem Binoka (), on Abemama, Kuria, and Aranuka. However, the dynasty of Abemama mistrusted Europeans. Borders were strictly controlled, any bartering with visiting ships were overseen by Binoka, and the rare trader allowed to stay onshore would eventually be evicted. European employees claimed that they had not been adequately paid by Binoka, who accused them of swindling him.\nMurdoch, however, managed\nThe Gilbert and Ellice Islands\nColonial officer\nRetirement\nBibliography\n* 75 |jstor=20701930}}\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nArticles\n* 130 |volume=40 |issue=12}}\n* 71 |volume=XXIII |issue=6}}\n* 9 |volume=41 |issue=1}}\n* 61, 81 |volume=XXI |issue=12}}\n* 8 |volume=XXVIII |issue=11}}\n* 81 |volume=39 |issue=8}}\n* 36 |volume=XII |issue=5}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/273913379/george_mcghie-murdoch George McGhie Murdoch (1860-1936)] at Find a Grave"
