The software modifies EnergyPlus Input Data Files (IDF) to change conventional static setpoint temperatures to dynamic adaptive setpoints, based on various thermal comfort standards and models. This allows for the assessment of building energy performance under adaptive thermal comfort principles, which can lead to more realistic energy consumption estimates and improved occupant comfort.\nThe tool is primarily aimed at researchers, building designers, and engineers who use EnergyPlus for building energy modeling and want to explore the impact of adaptive comfort strategies.\nFunctionality\naccim's core functionality revolves around the modification of EnergyPlus IDF files. It automates the process of applying complex adaptive comfort models, which would otherwise require manual and time-consuming modifications of simulation inputs.\nThe main functionalities include:\n* Implementation of adaptive setpoint temperatures: accim can modify existing IDF files to replace fixed heating and cooling setpoints with dynamic setpoints that respond to outdoor temperature changes, in accordance with established adaptive comfort models.\n* Support for multiple thermal comfort standards: The software incorporates a wide range of international and regional thermal comfort standards, including:\n** ASHRAE 55-2020\n** EN 16798-1:2019\n** Spanish CTE\n** Indian Model for Adaptive Comfort (IMAC)\n** Chinese standard GB/T 50785\n** Other models from Japan, Romania, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile.\n* HVAC system integration: accim provides different script types to handle various HVAC configurations:\n** vrf_ac and vrf_mm: These scripts add a standard VRF system to the model, suitable for both full air-conditioning and mixed-mode operation (with natural ventilation).\n** ex_ac and ex_mm: These scripts work with existing HVAC systems in the model, modifying their setpoint controls for either full air-conditioning or mixed-mode operation.\n* Customizable simulation parameters: Users can define numerous parameters for their simulations, such as comfort standard and category, HVAC operation mode, ventilation control strategies, and setpoint accuracy.\n* Batch processing: accim can process multiple IDF files and generate a large number of simulation cases by combining different adaptive comfort parameters, facilitating parametric studies.\nRequirements\nTo use accim, the following software needs to be installed:\n* Python 3.9\n* EnergyPlus (versions 9.1 to 25.1) installed in its default directory.\nJupyter Notebook is also recommended for using the example files provided with the library.\nUsage\nThe primary function in accim is addAccis(), which can be called with a simple script. The user can either follow a command-line interface to input the desired simulation parameters or specify them directly as arguments in the function.\nA basic usage example is:\nfrom accim.sim import accis\naccis.addAccis()\nThis will initiate a prompt asking the user to specify the script type, comfort standards, HVAC modes, and other settings to generate the corresponding IDF files for simulation.\nDependencies\nThe development of accim was made possible by leveraging other open-source Python packages, notably eppy and besos.\nReferences\n:Category:Free simulation software"
