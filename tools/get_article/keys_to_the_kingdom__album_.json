At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 68, based on six reviews.\nDoug Collette of All About Jazz found out that the album \"hearkens back to The North Mississippi Allstars earliest and rootsiest records, but nevertheless represents a marked advance in maturity\". AllMusic's Thom Jurek wrote that it \"may have been recorded in response to death and birth but it is, more than anything else, a celebration of all that Jim Dickinson held dear in life and music, which are, after all, the same thing\". Katie Chow of American Songwriter resumed: \"Keys to the Kingdom is both a tribute to and a continuation of the Dickinson musical tradition\". David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote: \"deep roots, improvising valor and live-Cream brawn come easily to this trio. Catching it all in the studio has been harder, like juggling snakes and feral cats. Singer-guitarist Luther Dickinson, his drumming brother, Cody, and bassist Chris Chew come close\".\nIn a mixed review, Jim Caligiuri of The Austin Chronicle wrote: \"more song-oriented than some past Allstars efforts and with an emphasis on country and gospel rather than the trio's gut-bucket blues, it wallops undeniable warmth even when the material itself veers from the Dickinsons' natural strengths\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Cody Dickinson – main performer\n* Luther Dickinson – main performer\n* Chris Crew – main performer\n* Mavis Staples – vocals (track 3)\n* Gregory Edward Hart – vocals, harmonica\n* Gordie Johnson – guitar (track 2), mixing (tracks: 2, 11)\n* Ryland \"Ry\" Cooder – guitar (track 8)\n* Dewey Lindon \"Spooner\" Oldham – piano\n* Jim Spake – saxophone, clarinet\n* Jack Ashford – tambourine\n* Kevin Houston – recording, mixing\n* Ben Tanner – recording\n* Jacob Sciba – mixing (tracks: 2, 11)\n* Manny A.
