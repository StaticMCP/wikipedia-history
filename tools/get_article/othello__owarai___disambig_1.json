According to the Japanese Othello page, their duo name comes not only from their contrasting complexions, but also their personality roles, with Nakajima having the darker, more scheming character, and Matsushima playing the innocent boke role in the manzai pattern.\nThe duo stopped activities in 2011 and officially disbanded in 2013.\nMembers\n; Tomoko Nakajima\n* Date of Birth: August 26, 1971\n* Birthplace: Yamashina-ku, Kyoto\n* Manzai Role: Tsukkomi\n; Nahomi Matsushima\n* Date of Birth: December 2, 1971\n* Birthplace: Higashiōsaka, Osaka\n* Manzai Role: Boke\nSee also\n* Owarai\n* Manzai\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121105080750/http://www.shochikugeino.co.jp/talents/01/post-2.html Othello official profile on Shochiku Geino website]"
