The singles chart was founded in 1952 by Percy Dickins of the NME, who wanted to imitate the hit parade that featured in the American magazine Billboard; before this, the popularity of a song had been measured by its sales of sheet music. Dickins sampled twenty shops, asking which their ten biggest-selling singles were. His aggregated list of sales was then published in the NME on 14 November 1952 as a Top 12 chart. The NME's chart is considered by the Official Charts Company (OCC) to be the canonical UK Singles Chart during the 1950s; it was expanded to a Top 20 on 1 October 1954.\nSales of records significantly increased in the mid-fifties, following the birth of rock and roll. As a result, the top ten biggest-selling singles of the 1950s were all released in the latter half of the decade. The biggest-selling single of this period was \"Rock Around the Clock\" by Bill Haley & His Comets, which became the first single ever to sell more than a million copies in the UK.\nSingles\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+Best-selling singles of the 1950s in the UK\n!scope=col|\n!scope=col|Single\n!scope=col|Artist\n!scope=col|Record label|group=lower-alpha|name=A}}\n!scope=col|Year\n!scope=col|Sales\n!scope=col|Chartpeak\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|\"Rock Around the Clock\"\n|\n|Brunswick\n|align=center|1955\n|align=center|1,390,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|\"Diana\"\n|\n|Columbia\n|align=center|1957\n|align=center|1,240,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|\"Mary's Boy Child\"\n|\n|RCA\n|align=center|1957\n|align=center|1,170,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|\"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\"\n|\n|Pye\n|align=center|1959\n|align=center|920,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|\"Jailhouse Rock\"\n|\n|RCA\n|align=center|1958\n|align=center|880,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|\"What Do You Want?\"\n|\n|Parlophone\n|align=center|1959\n|align=center|820,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|\"Living Doll\"\n|\n|Columbia\n|align=center|1959\n|align=center|770,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|\"All Shook Up\"\n|\n|His Master's Voice\n|align=center|1957\n|align=center|740,000\n|align=center|1\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|\"Love Letters in the Sand\"\n|\n|London\n|align=center|1957\n|align=center|710,000\n|align=center|2\n|-\n!scope=row style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\"\n|\n|Coral\n|align=center|1959\n|align=center|680,000\n|align=center|1\n|}\nReferences\n;General (chart positions)\n*\n;Specific"
