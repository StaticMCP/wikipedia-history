Fossilised animal remains and lithic tools indicate that seasonal hunter-gatherers were active on the island from around 12,000 BC.\n|-\n| || Extinction of the endemic to Cyprus pigmy hippos and pigmy elephants, likely due to human presence.\n|-\n| 9500–8800 BCE || || The first permanent settlements are formed in Asprokremnos, Klimonas and Roudias, founded by Pre-Pottery Neolithic populations who also introduced dog, sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, foxes, and deer to the island. Klimonas is to date the oldest known farming village in the world.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"vertical-align:top\" | 8700–7000 BCE || || A second phase of early migration is thought to have occurred between 8700 and 7000 BCE, with settlements at Akanthou, Mylouthkia, Shillourokambos, and Tenta. DNA data obtained from three individuals whose fragmentary remains were found in a Neolithic disused and filled-in water well at Kissonerga-Mylouthkia, revealed high Anatolian-related ancestry.\n|-\n| || Water wells discovered in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world, dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old.\n|-\n| || Remains of an 8-month-old cat buried with a human body were discovered at Shillourokambos. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, predating ancient Egyptian civilisation and pushing back the earliest known feline-human association.\n|-\n| 7000 BCE || || The Neolithic village of Khirokitia (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) is founded.\n|-\n| 6000 BCE || || The village of Khirokitia is suddenly abandoned for unknown reasons.
