The composition of the cabinet was announced by Anwar a day earlier on 2 December 2022, consisting of most of the political coalitions and parties represented in the 15th Parliament. It was the 23rd cabinet of Malaysia formed since independence. Although Perikatan Nasional (PN) was also invited to join the government, it decided to decline the invitation and instead formed the opposition. The government is often referred to as \"unity government\" (Malay: Kerajaan Perpaduan) or informally, Madani government (Malay: Kerajaan Madani).\nCabinet\nMinister composition\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
