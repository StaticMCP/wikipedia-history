In 1899, he helped draft anti-lynching legislation, and advocated for civil rights. He was a Republican.\nEarly life and education\nEdward Everett Brown was born on 1858 in Dover, New Hampshire, to parents Martha A. (née Runnels) and Charles J. Brown. Two of his sisters were singers, Nellie Brown Mitchell and Edna E. Brown. He graduated from Dover High School in 1878.\nBrown studied at Dartmouth College, where he studied French and Latin and was an orator. He gave a speech on genius that received plaudits. He then studied law under New Hampshire judge John H. White.

Freeman were denied entrance to a roller skating rink in Boston, called Highland Rink; Brown and lawyer James Harris Wolff took the rink owner David H. McKay to the Roxbury Municipal Court for racial discrimination and violating a 1865 state law from the Reconstruction-era. They won the case, and brought additional cases forward against the rink a year later.\nIn 1886, he became a partner at the law firm Walker, Wolff, and Brown, led by Brown, Edwin Garrison Walker, and James Harris Wolff, and it was Boston's first \"colored\" law firm.\nBrown was a member of the Wendell Phillips Club, and founding president of the Crispus Attucks Club in Boston. He was first vice president of the National League of Boston.\nBrown wrote the book, \"Sketch of the Life of Mr. Lewis Charlton, and Reminiscences of Slavery\" (c. 1870, Daily Press Print) about Lewis Charlton, a formerly enslaved person who became a school founder, and temperance advocate.\nHe worked as the Boston Deputy Health Commissioner, and at the time of his death the Boston Deputy Collector.\nDeath\nBrown died on January 14, 1919. His burial was at Pine Hill Cemetery in Dover, New Hampshire. A marker honoring Brown and his sister was unveiled in 2023 by the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/120412266/edward-everett-brown/photo Findagrave entry]"
