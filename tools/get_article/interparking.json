Founded in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium, the company designs, develops, and manages off-street and on-street parking facilities across several European countries and in Chile.\nHistory\nInterparking was founded in 1958 by Claude De Clercq in Brussels, Belgium. The company designed and built its first multi-level car park, Parking 58, for the 1958 Brussels World Expo. This project marked the beginning of its expansion in urban parking management.\nOver the following decades, Interparking expanded across Europe, operating in nine countries. In October 2024, the company signed a strategic agreement with Spanish parking operator Saba Infraestructuras. Following approval from European competition authorities, the integration was completed on 1 October 2025. With this merger, the combined group now operates in 16 countries, managing over 2,000 parking facilities and nearly 800,000 spaces, including its first operations in South America.\nHistory\nFormation\nInterparking began in 1958, emerging from the post-war economic boom in Brussels. The company's first parking facility, Parking 58, found success, accommodating stock market agents, theater-goers, and shoppers alike. This early demand led to the Belgian government's decision to rebuild the Mont des Arts district, including the Royal Library and a convention centre that needed a car park. Claude De Clercq, Interparking's founder, secured this contract, leading to the creation of the Albertine car park, which remains in operation today.\nDomestic and international growth\nBy 1962, Interparking's potential caught the eye of Brussels businessman , who acquired a 50% stake, sealed with a handshake. This partnership helped solidify Parking 58's growth. The company's first international move came in 1965 with a car park in Rotterdam, followed by a significant foothold in Berlin in 1967 with the takeover of the Europa-Center multi-storey car park. By 1969, Interparking's position was firmly established in Belgium, even partnering with BP Oil Group.\nInterparking extended its German presence by acquiring  and its Austrian subsidiary. Thirteen years after its founding, Interparking was active in Belgium, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. This decade also saw Yves De Clercq, Claude's son, join the company. He would become managing director in 2003, and, alongside his brother-in-law Baudouin Ruquois, would spearhead much of Interparking's international growth.\nIntegration of Saba\nOn 1 October 2025 Interparking integrated Saba Infraestructuras, following an agreement reached in October 2024 and approval from European competition authorities. Ageas and AG Insurance, through their real estate subsidiary AG Real Estate, remain the majority and controlling shareholder, alongside APG and CriteriaCaixa.\nSaba, founded in 1966, is a Spanish company specialised in the management of car parks and urban mobility infrastructures. Before the integration, the company operated more than 1,000 car parks and over 340,000 parking spaces across nine countries, including Spain, Italy, Portugal, Chile, and Andorra.\nWith this merger, Interparking strengthened its position as one of the largest European operators of parking facilities, managing over 2,000 car parks across 16 countries and nearly 800,000 parking spaces. The integration also expanded the group's capacity in sustainable mobility services, including the deployment of approximately 8,000 electric vehicle charging stations.\nInternational presence\nSince October 2025, the Interparking Group has been operating in fifteen European countries and in Chile, managing 2,098 sites across 595 cities and nearly 800,000 parking spaces (as of 31 December 2024).\nBreakdown by country\n* Andorra: 2 sites – 437 parking spaces\n* Austria: 42 sites – 12,784 parking spaces\n* Belgium: 108 sites – 46,388 parking spaces\n* Chile: 42 sites – 41,709 parking spaces\n* Czech Republic: 45 sites – 22,495 parking spaces\n* France: 76 sites – 29,592 parking spaces\n* Germany: 484 sites – 137,683 parking spaces\n* Italy: 93 sites – 146,867 parking spaces\n* Netherlands: 111 sites – 55,571 parking spaces\n* Poland: 47 sites – 21,907 parking spaces\n* Portugal: 103 sites – 35,307 parking spaces\n* Romania: 6 sites – 3,024 off-street spaces\n* Slovakia: 17 sites – 6,727 parking spaces\n* Spain: 252 sites – 102,023 parking spaces\n* United Kingdom: 503 sites – 113,002 parking spaces\nFinancial performance\nIn 2024, Interparking's revenues were €598.5 million with an economic EBITDA of €174.5 million.\nESG and sustainability\nInterparking achieved a 92% score in the GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) in 2024.\nKey figures:\n* 8,065 EV charging stations\n* 263 European Standard Parking Awards (ESPAs)\n* 135 lungs in the city, neutralising up to 70% of particles, 40% of fine particles and 20% of ultra-fine particles\n* Taking Climate Action certification maintained in all nine operating countries (previously known as \"CO2 neutral\")\nGovernance\nAs of 31 December 2024.\nExecutive management\n* Roland Cracco – chief executive officer\n* Édouard de Vaucleroy – chief financial officer\n* Élisabeth Roberti – general secretary\n* Arnaud Baijot – head of group mergers & acquisitions\nBoard of directors\nSource:\n* Serge Fautré – chairman\n* Roland Cracco – CEO\n* Marc Van Begin\n* Bart Saenen\n* Jan Jacob van Wulfften Palthe\n* Amand Benoît D'Hondt\n* Karel Tanghe\n* Piet Coelewij\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://downloads.ctfassets.net/52rzd94ogzb9/lof7rZxeQMTJ82yQuWyUk/0ce75ca8d6a236e0e5f320384b6385d0/Interparking_annual_report_2024.pdf Interparking 2024 Annual Report]\n* [https://www.interparking.com/en/news/interparking-et-saba-unissent-leurs-forces-pour-consolider-leur-position/ Interparking–Saba merger press release]\n* [https://www.agrealestate.eu/en/news/interparking-and-saba-join-forces-to-consolidate-their-position/ AG Real Estate press release]\n* [https://saba.eu/en/news/press-releases Saba Infraestructuras – Newsroom]\n* [https://www.lecho.be/entreprises/immobilier/interparking-rachete-l-espagnol-saba-pour-pres-d-1-3-milliard-d-euros/10533033.html Article in L'Echo on acquisition]\n* [https://www.expansion.com/empresas/inmobiliario/2024/10/16/652d111ce5fdea1b4c8b45b4.html Article in Expansión]\n* [https://www.dvo.be/artikel/interparking-en-saba-bundelen-krachten-in-pan-europese-alliantie?x-craft-preview=193eb4f97f06acd05ca4affd93c49213e50dfba886f19a3ff8bbb5b9fa2fad48rvjfgxtqkn&token=qBcrrqKDbXvZHPdntGu6haiAJpB8J0cK]"
