The award is presented since 1995 by the fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, to the recipients personally.\nThe prize consists of a humble Tibetan butter lamp that serves as a symbol of the extraordinary light that every recipient brought to Tibet. In 2005 the ICT received an award itself, the Geuzenpenning, a human rights award from the Netherlands.\nThe Light of Truth Award is granted to persons and organizations that have publicly contributed substantially to the rise of and battle for human rights and democratic freedoms of the Tibetan people. In 2001, the award was presented to the entire people of India, and accepted for them by president R. Venkataraman.\nRecipients\n* 1995: A. M.
