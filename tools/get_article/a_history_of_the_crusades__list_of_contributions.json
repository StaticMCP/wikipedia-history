The volumes, edited by Kenneth M. Setton, were published by the University of Wisconsin Press from 1969 to 1989 and consist of 89 chapters written by 64 prominent historians covering nearly 5000 pages.\n*Epigraph. Deus vult, deus vult.\n* Dedication. Dis manibus Johannis L. LaMonte et Danae C. Munro atque geniis adhus Florentibus Frederici Duncalf et Augusti C. Krey hoc opus dedicamus editores.\nSome key features of the work are:\n* The full range of subjects relevant to the Crusades is covered, from before 1095 until 1571.\n* Index. Each volume has its own comprehensive index. There is a search feature associated with each volume found on the outline page. Also, there is a search feature that covers all six volumes.\n* Bibliography. Each chapter includes a detailed bibliography in the notes beginning on its first page. In addition, there is a comprehensive bibliography at the end of Volume VI.\n* Maps. Each volume includes maps and gazetteers which are listed at the front of the outline. Volume VI also includes a set of overview maps showing the theaters of operation of all the Crusades.\n* Timelines. The first three volumes contain timelines relevant to their material. The timeline in Volume III covers all six volumes, 1049–1571.\nThe origins of the need for such a history was shown by American historian John L. La Monte in his Some Problems in Crusading Historiography. La Monte's leadership on the project ended with his death in 1949, and the lead was assumed by Setton at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950. The Routledge Companion to the Crusades ranks A History of the Crusades as one of the most comprehensive and monumental 20th-century works on the subject.\nVolume I. The First One Hundred Years\nThe first volume was edited by Marshall W. Baldwin and primarily covers the period from 1095–1187. Preliminary material discusses the situation in Western Europe, the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim world prior to that time. The material then includes the First Crusade, the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Crusader States, the Fall of Edessa, the Second Crusade, and the Fall of Jerusalem to Saladin.\n* Forward.\n* Table of Contents.\n* List of Illustrations.\n* List of Maps.\n* Frontispiece.
