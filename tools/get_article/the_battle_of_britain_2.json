The game uses a plotting map and a tote-board system, and the player keeps track of observer reports on potential threats from radar and the ground.\nReception\nAlan Emrich reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"Don't miss out on The Battle of Britain 2 if you want a gaming distraction that is, at once, enjoyable, pleasant, easily learned, historical and 'lite.'\"\nAndrew Miller from Macworld commented that \"even though the graphics and sound on The Battle of Britain [2] are not spectacular, I recommend the game. What it lacks in aesthetics it makes up for in strategy, historical insight, and entertainment.\"\nDon Crabb for the Chicago Sun-Times said that \"If you like war games and simulations, or even if you have never tried one before, The Battle of Britain 2 deserves your attention.
