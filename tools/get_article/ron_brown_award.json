      "text": "# Ron Brown Award\n\nThe Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership is a U.S. presidential honor to recognize companies \"for the exemplary quality of their relationships with employees and communities\".  It is presented to companies that \"have demonstrated a deep commitment to innovative initiatives that not only empower employees and communities but also advance strategic business interests\".\nEstablishment\nPresident Bill Clinton, along with prominent business leaders, established the award in 1997 following Ron Brown's death in a plane crash in 1996. The award was originally referred to as Ron Brown Corporate Citizenship Award. The Conference Board, a non-profit organization, was chosen to manage the award's administration. Ron Brown was the U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1993–1996; he was the first African-American to hold that position.  This award and the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award are the two presidential awards to corporations.\nCeremony\nThe award is presented in an annual White House ceremony, either by the President or by the Secretary of Commerce.\nRecipients\n2006–2007\n* Exelon\n* Northrop Grumman Corporation\n* Procter & Gamble\n2005–2006\n* Sallie Mae\n* Weyerhaeuser Company\n2004–2005\n* S.C.
