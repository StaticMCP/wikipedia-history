At the moment, unfortunately, these are important singles and consequently about nine dollars apiece. But I assure you, while you might find pretenders of the throne, there is only the one King of Snake.\"\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1999)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 82\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nNotes\n* There were several exclusive releases for this; Ricks Mixes on CD were promo only.\n* There were three exclusive mixes for Italy released on 12\", and CD.\nAppearances\n* \"Shudder / King of Snake\" appears on Beaucoup Fish.\n* \"King of Snake (Fatboy Slim Remix)\" appears in the 2000 film Kevin & Perry Go Large.\n* \"Shudder / King of Snake\" appears in the 2010 film Biutiful.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060617090347/http://www.dirty.org/underworld/disco-uw-single.php Underworld discography pages at dirty.org]"
