As the third series on the BBC historic farm series, following the original, Tales from the Green Valley, it depicts a group of historians recreating the running of a farm during the Edwardian era. It was made for the BBC by independent production company Lion Television and filmed at Morwellham Quay, an historic port in Devon. The farming team was historian Ruth Goodman and archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn. The series was devised and produced by David Upshal and directed by Stuart Elliott, Chris Michell and Naomi Benson.\nThe series is a development from two previous series, Victorian Farm and Victorian Pharmacy, which were among BBC Two's biggest hits of 2009 and 2010, receiving audiences of up to 3.8 million per episode. The series was followed by Wartime Farm in September 2012, featuring the same team but this time in Hampshire on Manor Farm, living a full calendar year as World War II-era farmers.\nAn associated book by Goodman, Langlands, and Ginn, also titled Edwardian Farm, was published in 2010 by BBC Books.  The series was also published on DVD.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #689CCF; color: #ffffff;\" width=6% | #\n! style=\"background-color: #689CCF; color: #ffffff;\" width=20% | Title\n! style=\"background-color: #689CCF; color: #ffffff;\" width=20% | Directed by\n! style=\"background-color: #689CCF; color: #ffffff;\" width=23% | Original air date\n|-\n|ShortSummary = The trio establish their domicile, scrubbing a flagstone floor and cleaning out a clogged chimney.  They build a hayrick to put up hay, hire a stonemason to make a trough, learn to thatch, make a rag rug and begin keeping chickens and sheep.  Ruth cooks a sheep's head stew.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = Alex and Peter milk goats and train the ploughhorses. They begin a market garden of strawberries. Ruth pickles apples, salts a ham, and smokes bacon.  Alex and Peter press apples to cider (scrumpy), freighting first the apples, then the barrel on the river.  They visit a cooper and make lime putty.  They read government agricultural leaflets, collect eggs, make chicken stew, and celebrate Halloween in Edwardian style.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = Ruth prepares for the arrival of the farm's pigs and works on the privy, while Alex and Peter compare ploughing with horses to ploughing with the world's oldest working tractor.  Peter begins a trout hatchery.  In order to repair the hedgerows, Alex takes a trip to a water-powered smithy for a billhook.  Ruth makes sloe gin for Christmas and entertains with a gramophone.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = As winter sets in, the three farm dwellers must look further afield to earn money. Peter and Alex fish for crabs while Ruth hires herself out for domestic work.  Ruth rides a bicycle and tries period cleaning techniques, including early vacuum cleaners.  They separate growing calves from their mothers.  Peter finds out how leather is made.  They celebrate Christmas modestly, as poor farmers might have, and listen to a Methodist Christmas message.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = The continuing winter forces Alex and Peter down a copper mine, while Ruth makes lace. The copper mine is the King Edward Mine, Camborne, Cornwall, and the lace-making is at Honiton.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = Six months into their year, Ruth, Alex and Peter explore the daily lives of Edwardian farmers. This episode has a slightly different format to the rest of the series; instead of covering a whole month's changes it uses a framing device of Ruth writing a letter describing the events of a single day on the farm.  Peter buys a Victorian/Edwardian Era Teasmade.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = Spring arrives with the lambs and the potato crop planted with manure. Daffodils are harvested and sent by train across the country. A Dartmoor pony is broken in and Easter eggs are decorated using natural dyes, and chicks are successfully hatched\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = April arrives and time is divided between the land and the sea.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = Summer brings the tourists, so the farm provides strawberries and clotted cream.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = June arrives so the sheep go up onto the moors of Dartmoor with Alex and Peter guiding (fortified with biscuits and Mahogany wine, courtesy of Ruth), leaving Ruth to run the farm, including spraying Bordeaux mixture on the potato crop.  Alex and Peter try their hands at sheep-shearing and dry stone walling, and observe sheepdogs at work.  Ruth makes her own cheese and visits an early wool mill.  Finally, they have an Edwardian picnic with a vintage car and then go rambling and letterboxing on the moor.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = July brings the harvest, cherries and potatoes. Ruth goes salmon fishing on the River Tamar with a seine net. Peter and Alex pick cherries from tall ladders and Ruth prepares cherry preserves.  They try out Edwardian potato digging devices and employ child labour.  The annual day holiday at Lynton and Lynmouth is a welcome distraction.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|ShortSummary = August brings to an end the year on the farm; weather dictates the harvest and the seaside brings much needed fertilizer.\n|LineColor = 689CCF\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/webarchive/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fblogs%2Ftv%2F2010%2F11%2Fedwardian-farm.shtml BBC2 Edwardian Farm blog by Ruth Goodman]\n*[http://www.ruthgoodman.me.uk/ Ruth Goodman website]\n*[http://www.alexlanglands.com/ Alex Langlands website]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/jan/20/edwardian-farm Appreciation in The Guardian]"
