It was reported that D Awards will have special two categories: 'D Awards Delights' which was given to the outstanding K-Pop artist throughout the year and 'D Awards Dreamers' which was given to the aspiring new K-Pop artist who will lead the industry in the future. D Awards offers three varieties of trophies featuring hexahedron design, each in a distinct color derived from the awards' symbolic color: 'black' for the grand prizes, 'blue' for the main prizes and best sub-award categories, and 'silver' for the emerging K-Pop artists.\nThe 1st D Awards was held on February 22, 2025 with Go Min-si and Lee Jong-won as the presenters.\nCeremonies\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+List of D Awards award ceremonies\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Edition\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1st\n| 2025\n| February 22, 2025\n| Korea University Hwajeong Gymnasium\n| Seoul, South Korea\n|\n|}\nAwards categories\n* Black Label (Grand prizes)\n** Artist of the Year\n** Song of the Year\n** Album of the Year\n** Record of the Year\n** Performance of the Year\n** Trend of the Year\n** Rookie of the Year\n** D Awards Iconic\n* Blue Label (Main prizes)\n** Delights Blue Label\n** D Awards Impact\n** Best Band\n** Best Choreography\n** Best Group\n** Best OST\n** Best Stage\n** Best Tour\n** Best Video\n** Best Solo Popularity Award (Boy / Girl)\n** Best Group Popularity Award (Boy / Girl)\n** UPICK Global Choice (Boy / Girl)\n* Silver Label (Emerging artists)\n** Dreams Silver Label\n** D Awards Discovery of the Year\n** D Awards Remark\nGrand Prizes (Daesang)\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+List of winners of the grand prizes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Edition\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"8\" | Winner\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist of the Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Song of the Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Album of the Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Record of the Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Performance of the Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Trend of the Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Rookie of the Year\n! scope=\"col\" | D Awards Iconic\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1st\n| 2025\n| Seventeen\n| Aespa – \"Supernova\"\n| Enhypen – Romance: Untold\n| Zerobaseone – Cinema Paradise\n| Riize\n| QWER\n| NCT Wish, TWS\n| SM Entertainment\n|\n|-\n|}\nMost awarded artists\nThe following artists (arranged in alphanumeric order) has received four or more awards.\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Awards\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 5\n| Enhypen\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 4\n| Riize\n|-\n| TWS\n|-\n| Zerobaseone\n|}\nReferences"
