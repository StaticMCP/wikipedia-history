The Spiegel had interchanged the bandphotos of 1984 and 1992, other newspapers and magazines would not believe that the Onkelz weren't and aren't Nazis.\nAlles F.a. M.\n:Full length title: \"Alles Fotzen außer Mutti\". A song that shows that a pervert man who hates women can't accept that he is the only one who thinks wrong.\nFür immer\n:As Weidner says, this is a very personally song about the end of a love story.\nDeutschland im Herbst\n: This song was written as a reaction of the attacks by neo-Nazis on asylum-seekers' houses in Mölln, Rostock-Lichtenhagen and Hoyerswerda. The press had seen some photos of the attackers, who wore Onkelz merchandise and wrote that the Onkelz were guilty for these attacks. The band wanted to make it understood that they condemn such attacks.\n:The song is introduced with a broadcast news message (translated):\n: Rostock. After yesterday's excesses before the central approach place for asylum seekers in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania around 1,000 mostly young right-wing extremists today also battled against the police on the road. By the—in parts—civil war similarly riots the attackers had thrown with stones, bottles and fireworks against the safety men. More than 110 officials were partly heavily injured. The right-wing extremists, who came from across the federal republic, broke into the floor of the asylum-seekers' homes, and ignited—with applause from around 2,000 onlookers—some apartments. The police arrested around 60 persons. The foreign countries reacted—in remembering to the national-socialistic Germany—to the continuous riots in the quarter of Lichtenhagen with concern about increasing hatred of strangers.\n:Lyrics from the song:\n: I see brown* shit killing ...\n: I hear stupid slogans from idiots and losers ...\n:  Brown was the colour of Hitler's Nazi Party (NSDAP).\nSie hat 'nen Motor\n:A fun-song about Weidners Harley Davidson and his Chevrolet.\nTribute to Stevie\n:Gonzo and Weidner were fans of Stevie Ray Vaughan, who died in 1990. This instrumental was composed by Gonzo and it's the only known track which wasn't composed by Weidner.\nSchöne neue Welt\n:\"Listen, folks and people: Hit yourself! Hate your neighbour for you want to be independent! Kill your brother! Rape your wife! You speak the same language, but you can't trust each other. 'Beautiful' new world - our enemies are we self. That's how dreams are dying\". The central message is to stop wars all over the world.\n:\"Schöne neue Welt\" rather means \"Brave new world\" (as the novel by Aldous Huxley). The translation \"Beautiful new world\" however is a kind of one-to-one translation, showing the exact meaning of the German words (for better understanding).\nSo geht's dir (deine Hölle) & Das Messer und die Wunde\n:Both are written for the murderer of Andreas \"Trimmi\" Trimborn, a good friend of the band, who was stabbed by a Bundeswehr soldier in June 1990.\nIch bin wie ich bin\n:A song about personal freedom, expressing the thought that no society should oppress one's own personality.\nWorte der Freiheit\n:Written to all former East German residents, who grumble and cry after the re-union of Germany didn't went as well as planned (economically).\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
