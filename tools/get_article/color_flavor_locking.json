The quarks form Cooper pairs, whose color properties are correlated with their flavor properties in a one-to-one correspondence between three color pairs and three flavor pairs. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the color-flavor-locked phase is the highest-density phase of three-flavor colored matter.\nColor-flavor-locked Cooper pairing\nIf each quark is represented as \\psi^\\alpha_i, with color index \\alpha taking values 1, 2, 3 corresponding to red, green, and blue, and flavor index i taking values 1, 2, 3 corresponding to up, down, and strange, then the color-flavor-locked pattern of Cooper pairing is\n:\\langle \\psi^\\alpha_i C \\gamma_5 \\psi^\\beta_j \\rangle\n\\propto \\delta^\\alpha_i\\delta^\\beta_j - \\delta^\\alpha_j\\delta^\\beta_i\n= \\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta A}\\epsilon_{ij A}\nThis means that a Cooper pair of an up quark and a down quark must have colors red and green, and so on. This pairing pattern is special because it leaves a large unbroken symmetry group.\nPhysical properties\nThe CFL phase has several remarkable properties.\n* It breaks chiral symmetry.\n* It is a superfluid.\n* It is an electromagnetic insulator, in which there is a \"rotated\" photon, containing a small admixture of one of the gluons.\n* It has the same symmetries as sufficiently dense hyperonic matter.\nThere are several variants of the CFL phase, representing distortions of the pairing structure in response to external stresses such as a difference between the mass of the strange quark and the mass of the up and down quarks.\nSee also\n* Color superconductivity\nReferences"
