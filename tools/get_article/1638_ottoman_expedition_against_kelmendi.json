The Sultan, freed from the war with Persia after the capture of Baghdad, ordered Vučo (or Doudgé) Pasha, Beylerbey (governor) of Bosnia to gather troops and march against the Kelmendi.\nThe Kelmendi, according to Bardhi, had 250 houses with a total population of 2,900. Mariano Bolizza (1614) considered the number of \"mountaineer rebels\" who were to be 5,380. It is likely that the number of armed men who fought against the Ottoman campaign in Kelmendi to have been also composed other tribes besides Kelmendi.\nCampaign\nFor the campaign the Pasha gathered a 15,000-strong army, composed of soldiers of various origins (Dalmatians, Croats, Serbs, Bulgarians, and Bosnians). After reaching Shkodër, the main city in northern Albania, the Pasha ordered the sanjabeys of Shkodra and Dukagjin to gather a thousand Albanians to join his own troops. The challenging terrain and heavy snowfall compelled the Ottomans to resort to pillaging and razing villages in search of supplies. Anticipating the Ottoman threat, local Kelmendi rebels concealed their families, cattle, and valuables in a grotto in the mountains.\nOutcome\nAccording to Ottoman historian Mustafa Naima (1655–1716), and to 19th-century French historians Ernest Lavisse and François Lenormant (using Ottoman and Western sources such as Austrian historian Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall) weakened by famine and lacking ammunition, the Kelmendi leaders Knez Vuk Doda and Vojvode Hotaš were caught and beheaded, their heads were sent to the Sultan in Constantinople. Surviving members of the tribe were mostly relocated to the mountains around Pristina, some were sent as far as Serres in Macedonia and to Slavonia. Austrian historian Spiridon Gopčević writes that starved to death, the main force of the Kelmendi surrendered after the death of their leaders Vuk Doda and Vojvode Hotaš, and that the majority of the tribe was relocated to Pristina.\nAccording to Albanian bishop Frang Bardhi (1606–1643), and to some modern Albanian scholars (using Bardhi's report as source) the Ottoman force found itself encircled and attacked after the Kelmendi under the leadership of Vuk Doda had blockaded the roads. During the confrontation a thousand Ottoman soldiers were killed, leading to the Ottoman force retreat to Bosnia.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nJournals\n*\nWebsites\n*  | access-date=2023-10-03}}\n* }}"
