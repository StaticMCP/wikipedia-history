She died in Highland Falls, New York and was buried near the Hudson River.\nIn 1926, remains believed to be hers were disinterred and reburied near the entrance to the West Point Cemetery by the Daughters of the American Revolution. However, a 2017 study revealed that these were instead the remains of an unknown man; the actual location of Corbin's remains is unknown.\nOther memorials\nThere is a memorial dedicated to Corbin on Margaret Corbin Drive in Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan, New York City, near the location of the Battle of Fort Washington. Margaret Corbin Circle also lies just outside the entrance to the park.\nGallery\nImage:Margaret_Corbin_Memorial_Base,_West_Point,_NY.JPG|Base of Corbin's memorial gravestone\nImage:Margaret_Corbin_Historical_Road_Marker.JPG|Roadside marker on Washington Road, West Point\nFile:2015 Fort Tryon Park Margaret Corbin memorial.jpg|The memorial to Corbin in Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan\nFile:Margaret Corbin plaque 20211113 194424318.jpg|Margaret Corbin plaque on Margaret Corbin Drive in Fort Tryon Park\nReferences"
