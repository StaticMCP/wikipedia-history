The organisation was originally set up to represent pro-independence members within the Liberal Democrats, but later the group decided to drop attempts to affiliate with the party and instead opened membership to anyone that agreed with their policies.\nHistory\nSLFI was founded on 29 August 2022 by Cameron Greer and Jake Stevenson who were members of the Liberal Democrats that originally backed Scotland remaining as part of the United Kingdom. After appealing to set up a pro-independence group within the Liberal Democrats, Greer and Stevenson decided to form the group independently of the party and become a campaign group for support Scottish independence.\nPolicies and views\nSLFI supports Scotland becoming an independent republic in the European Union and that it should adopt its own currency straight after independence and that a universal basic income (UBI) should also be introduced afterwards. Alongside their policies surrounding independence SLFI also advocate the safeguarding of transgender rights.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://scotlibs4indy.wixsite.com/scotlibs4indy Official website]"
