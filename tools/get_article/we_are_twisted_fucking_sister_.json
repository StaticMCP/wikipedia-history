Though he was not a fan, he found the band to be interesting and entertaining.\nRelease\nIn 2014, Dee Snider endorsed the documentary and its  Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for distribution.  We Are Twisted Fucking Sister! premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam on November 30, 2014.  Band member Jay Jay French attended the premiere.  A preview fundraiser was held at a club in Ferndale, Michigan, on January 9, 2015.\nReception\nNeil Young of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"a raucously riotous rags-to-riches record of rip-roaring rock renegades\".  Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent wrote that it is \"uproarious and poignant by turns\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
