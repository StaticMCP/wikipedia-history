However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nArmy Air Force Training CommandSoutheast Training Center/AAF Eastern Flying Training Command\n* Blytheville Army Air Field, 3 miles north of Blytheville\n: Army Air Forces Advanced Flying School (Two Engine) / Army Air Forces Pilot School (Advanced, Two Engine); 3 May 1942-31 May 1945\n: 326th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; 21 July 1942-30 April 1944\n: 2111th Army Air Forces Base Unit; 1 May 1944-16 June 1945\n: Became Blytheville Air Force Base / Eaker Air Force Base (1951-1992)\n: Now: Arkansas International Airport  (1992-Present)\n* Newport Army Air Field, 6 miles northeast of Newport\n: Army Air Forces Basic Flying School/Army Air Forces Pilot School (Basic); 1 November 1942-30 April 1944\n: 337th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; 24 November 1942-30 April 1944\n: Later: Marine Corps Air Facility Newport\n: Now: Newport Municipal Airport (M19)\n* Stuttgart Army Air Field, 5 miles north of Stuttgart\n: Army Air Forces Advanced Flying School (Two Engine)/Army Air Forces Pilot School (Advanced, Two Engine); 20 September 1942-7 February 1945\n: 426th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; 20 September 1942-30 April 1944\n: 2141st Army Air Forces Base Unit (AAFEFTC); 1 May 1944-7 February 1945\n: 314th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Third AF); 7 February 1945-8 December 1945\n: Now: Stuttgart Municipal Airport (SGT)\n* Walnut Ridge Army Air Field, 4 miles north of Walnut Ridge\n: Army Air Forces Basic Flying School/Army Air Forces Pilot School (Basic); 15 August 1942-1 September 1944\n: 323th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; 25 August 1942-30 April 1944\n: Later: Marine Corps Air Facility Walnut Ridge\n: Now: Walnut Ridge Regional Airport (ARG)\n* Adams Field, 4 miles east of Little Rock\n: (Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport)\n: 12th Ferrying Service Detachment/12th Ferrying Service Station; 1 December 1943-31 March 1944\n: 581st Army Air Forces Base Unit (12th Ferrying Service Station); 31 March 1944-20 September 1945\n: Now: Clinton National Airport\n* Grider Field, 5 miles east of Pine Bluff\n: Pine Bluff School of Aviation\n: 312th Flying Training Detachment\n: Now: Pine Bluff Regional Airport\nKnown Secondary Facilities\n*Carlisle (26&nbsp;mi.
