Chang Geng (Chen Zheyuan), who resides in a small town, was attacked by a pack of wolves during an outing but was saved by Shen Shiliu (Tan Jianci). To repay his kindness, Chang Geng acknowledges him as his foster-father. The enemy forces, the Heavenly Wolf tribe, waited for an opportunity to invade and set off a war. In a critical moment, Chang Geng discovers that he is the fourth prince of Northern Xuan, and Shen Shiliu is Gu Yun, the commander of Xuan Tie army. Gu Yun defeated the Heavenly Wolf tribe and escorted Chang Geng to the capital city.\nThe current Emperor of Northern Xuan passes away, and Li Feng ascended the throne as the new Emperor. However, his foundation is not yet stable. The ambitious Prince of Wei is eyeing his throne and saw this as an opportunity to create a crisis. Li Feng, wary of Gu Yun's military prowess, sends Gu Yun to guard the borders. Chang Geng also chose to join the Lin Yuan Pavilion and followed the experts of the pavilion around the world to travel and experience life. After several years, he grew up into a someone with lofty ambitions and a talent for governing. At this time, Northern Xuan faces both internal and external problems.
