      "text": "# Richlands Ward\n\nRichlands Ward was a Brisbane City Council ward covering Richlands and surrounding suburbs. The ward established for the 1994 election, partly replacing the former Inala Ward, and existed until the 2016 election where it was largely replaced by Forest Lake Ward.\nHistory\nLes Bryant won Richlands at the 1994 election, and was re-elected in 1997, 2000 and 2004.\nBryant nominated for Labor preselection for the 2008 election, but withdrew after then-Labor state secretary Milton Dick chose to contest the seat. Dick was not a resident of the ward at the time he announced his candidacy, but announced he would relocate from his home in Clayfield, and was endorsed by prime minister Kevin Rudd.\nDick was deputy leader of the opposition on council until 2012. At the election in March of that year, he substantially increased the Labor majority with a 13.7% swing in his favour, and he was subsequently made leader of the opposition, serving in that role until 2016.\nCouncillors for Richlands Ward\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Les Bryant\n| Labor\n| 26 March 1994 – 15 March 2008\n| Councillor for Inala Ward from 1991 to 1994.
