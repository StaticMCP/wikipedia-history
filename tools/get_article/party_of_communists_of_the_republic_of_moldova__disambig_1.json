It is the only communist party to have held a majority government in a post-Soviet state. It has been variously described as communist, Moldovenist, populist, Russophile, and pro-Soviet.\nAffiliated with the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it is also a member of the Party of the European Left and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties.\nIn contrast to most like-minded left-wing and communist parties, especially in the Western world, the party has a conservative outlook on social issues, reflecting Voronin's views, the country's strong social conservatism, and the influence of the Moldovan Orthodox Church.\nHistory\nThe PCRM was registered as a political party in 1994. The PCRM was part of the Popular Patriotic Forces Front at the time of the 1996 presidential election, in which Voronin stood as the coalition's candidate and won 10.3% of the vote, placing third. The party supported Petru Lucinschi in the second round of the election, and following Lucinschi's victory the PCRM was given two positions in the government. Romanian historian Dorin Cimpoeșu has described the party as Moldovenist.\n1998 parliamentary election\nIn the 1998 Moldovan parliamentary election, the PCRM won 30.1% of the vote and 40 seats, becoming the largest party in parliament; in its platform, it called for \"the rebirth of a socialist society\". Despite its strong showing, the PCRM was left in opposition due to the formation of a center-right coalition government, Alliance for Democracy and Reforms (ADR). Although Lucinschi later nominated Vladimir Voronin as Prime Minister of Moldova in late 1999, the nomination was unsuccessful because Voronin did not have enough support in parliament.\n2001 parliamentary election\nThe PCRM received 49.9% of the vote in the 2001 Moldovan parliamentary election, winning 71 out of the 101 seats in parliament. With a PCRM parliamentary majority, Voronin was elected as president by parliament in April 2001. The Constitutional Court ruled that the President could also lead a political party, and Voronin was re-elected as party leader.\n2005 parliamentary election\nAs the ruling political party in Moldova, it won the 2005 Moldovan parliamentary election, and provided the President, Vladimir Voronin, the Prime Minister, Zinaida Greceanîi, and the President of the Moldovan Parliament, Marian Lupu. Under Voronin, it privatized several state-owned industries and governed in a multi-party fashion. It also favors European integration and eventual EU membership.\n2009 parliamentary elections\nAfter April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election and the 2009 Moldova civil unrest, the political and civic climate in Moldova became very polarized. The parliament failed to elect a new president. For this reason, the parliament was dissolved and, consequently, snap elections were held. At the July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election, the party received 44.7% of the vote. That gave the former ruling party 48 MPs and the remaining 53 seats in the 101-member chamber went to four opposition parties which subsequently formed the governing Alliance for European Integration (AIE). For the first time since 2001, the Communists were pushed in opposition.\n2010 parliamentary election\nwas President of Moldova and the party's most prominent personality.]]\nAfter the Parliament failed to elect a new President of the Republic, 2010 Moldovan parliamentary election were called. In the election, PCRM obtained 39.34% of votes, winning 42 seats, going again into opposition to the Alliance of European Integration (AIE). In 2011, Igor Dodon and Zinaida Greceanîi left the party and joined the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PSRM).\n2014 parliamentary election\nThe 2014 Moldovan parliamentary election saw a great defeat for PCRM, which received only 17.48% of votes, losing more than half of its electors to PSRM and electing 21 seats. Following the elections, the party agreed to give confidence and supply to the new Gaburici Cabinet. The agreement collapsed in June 2015 and the PCRM went back into opposition.\nIn 2016, the party suffered a large split as 14 MPS left PCRM faction and established the Social Democratic Platform for Moldova, joining the majority of Filip Cabinet. On 10 March 2017, all 14 MPs joined the Democratic Party of Moldova (PDM). Since then, the party rapidly declined in polls, losing most of its votes to PSRM and PDM.\n2019 parliamentary election\nAt the 2019 Moldovan parliamentary election, the PCRM collapsed, receiving only 3.75% of votes and losing all representation in the parliament for the first time in independent Moldova.\n2021 parliamentary election\nAt the 2021 parliamentary election, the PCRM decided to join forces with the PSRM in order to re-enter the parliament as the Electoral Bloc of Communists and Socialists (BECS). The party won 10 out of 101 seats in the parliament as part of the aforementioned electoral bloc, thus regaining parliamentary presence after 2019.\n2025 parliamentary election\nIn the run up to the 2025 parliamentary election, the PCRM joined the Patriotic Electoral Bloc, composed of the Party of Socialists (PSRM), the Heart of Moldova Republican Party (PRIM), and the Future of Moldova Party (PVM) led by former communist prime minister Vasile Tarlev. Shortly after the elections, in which the bloc won 26 seats, of which 8 were taken by the PCRM, the party announced it would be leaving the bloc and forming its own parliamentary group.\nIdeology\nAccording to Art. 1 of its statute adopted in 2008, the PCRM is the \"lawful successor and heir of the Communist Party of Moldova both in terms of ideas and traditions.\" While officially espousing a Marxist-Leninist communist doctrine, there is debate over their policies. In 2009, The Economist considered it a centre-right party, communist-in-name only. Romanian political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu posits that the party is not communist in the classical sense because of the many changes since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but it is the clear successor to the Communist Party of Moldova, and not something foreign to it, for its Soviet nostalgia.\nFor its latest period of governance, the PCRM has outlined a new quality of life, economic modernisation, European integration, and consolidation of the society as goals for the country. During the party's time in government, the party has adopted pro-Russian policies, while remaining committed to European integration. Despite being known for gaining most of its support from pensioners, since 2009 it also started to attract more votes from young people and adopting a populist outlook, which was downplayed during the PCRM's time in government but has resurfaced at the opposition and extra-parliamentary level. In contrast to social populist parties, some of which combine left-wing policies on welfare with nationalist stances, while its main ideology continues to be Marxism–Leninism and European socialism.\nThe party is known for its Moldovenist position, supporting the existence of Moldovan language and ethnicity. The party considers 28 June 1940 as \"the day Moldova was liberated by the Soviet Union from the Romanian occupation\". For these reasons, part of the press (such as journalist Oleg Serebrian) described the party as anti-Romanian.\nMoldovan Komsomol\nThe Communist Youth Union of Moldova (; ) was registered in 1995, currently including 6,000 members. According to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Moldova, it is the largest youth organization in the country. The First Secretaries of the Central Committee of the UTCM were the following: Victor Verșîn (1995–1997), Eduard Babliuc (1997–2000), Tatiana Nicoară (2000–2004), Grigore Petrenco (2004–2007), Inna Șupac (2007–present).\nLeadership\n* President – Vladimir Voronin\n* Vice Presidents – Oleg Reidman and Veaceslav Nigai\n* Executive Secretary for Ideology – Constantin Starîș\nElectoral results\nParliament\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ Parliament of the Republic of Moldova\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Election\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Leader\n!colspan=\"5\" scope=\"col\"|Performance\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Rank\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Government\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!± pp\n!Seats\n!+/–\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|1998\n|rowspan=\"17\"|Vladimir Voronin\n|rowspan=\"3\"|487,002\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|rowspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|New\n|rowspan=\"3\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|New\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1st\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2001\n|rowspan=\"1\"|794,808\n|rowspan=\"1\"|\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 20.06\n|rowspan=\"1\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 31\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1st\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|2005\n|rowspan=\"2\"|716,336\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 4.09\n|rowspan=\"2\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 15\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1st\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2009(April)\n|rowspan=\"1\"|760,551\n|rowspan=\"1\"|\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 3.50\n|rowspan=\"1\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1st\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2009(July)\n|rowspan=\"1\"|706,732\n|rowspan=\"1\"|\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4.79\n|rowspan=\"1\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 12\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 1st\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|2010\n|rowspan=\"2\"|677,069\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 5.35\n|rowspan=\"2\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 6\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1st\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|2014\n|rowspan=\"3\"|279,366\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 21.86\n|rowspan=\"3\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 17\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 3rd\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|2019\n|rowspan=\"2\"|53,175\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 13.73\n|rowspan=\"2\"|}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 21\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 5th\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n!2021\n|398,675\n| (BECS)\n| 23.42\n|}}\n| 10\n| 3rd\n|\n|-\n!2025\n|381,505\n| (BEP)\n| 3.00\n|}}\n| 2\n| 3rd\n|\n|-\n|}\nPresidency\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ President of Moldova\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Election\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Candidate\n!colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|First round\n!colspan=\"2\"|Second round\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Result\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n!2001\n|\n|71\n|\n|bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=2|\n|Elected\n|-\n!2005\n|\n|75\n|\n|bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=2|\n|Elected\n|-\n!2009(May–June)\n|\n|60\n|\n|bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=2|\n|bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=1|No winner\n|-\n!2009(November–December)\n|colspan=5 rowspan=4|Boycotted the elections\n|bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=1|No winner\n|-\n!2011–2012\n|Lost\n|-\n!2016\n|Lost\n|-\n!2020\n|Lost\n|-\n!2024\n|\n|3.19\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Endorsed Alexandr Stoianoglo\n|Lost\n|-\n|}\nGallery\nFile:PCRM 2009.svg|Votes won by PCRM in the April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election by raion and municipality\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pcrm.md/ Official website]"
