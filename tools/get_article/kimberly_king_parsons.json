She is the author of the short story collection Black Light (2019), which was longlisted for the National Book Award and the Story Prize, and the novel We Were the Universe (2024), which won the Ken Kesey Award for Fiction at the Oregon Book Awards and was ranked number two on TIME Magazine's Best Books of 2024.\nEarly life and education\nParsons was born in Lubbock, Texas. She received her MFA from Columbia University, where she served as editor-in-chief of Columbia: A Journal of Literature and Art.\nCareer\nBlack Light\nParsons's debut collection, Black Light, was published by Vintage Books in August 2019. In 2019, Black Light was longlisted for the National Book Award and the Story Prize. In NPR, Michael Schaub called it \"a wild and compassionate debut collection,\" praising Parsons for writing \"with the unpredictable power of a firecracker\" and for proving herself \"a gutsy country-punk poet with a keen eye and a stubbornly unique sensibility.\" In the Los Angeles Times, Nathan Deuel wrote that the collection was \"a book for the lonely, for the losers poised for more—it's a celebration of and a deeply felt meditation on the injustice, cruelty and a million private horrors endured by the weak and the unloved.\"\nWe Were the Universe\nParsons's debut novel, We Were the Universe, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2024. The novel was selected as a Dakota Johnson Book Club pick and ranked number two on TIME Magazine's Best Books of 2024. In the New York Times Book Review, Alissa Nutting praised the novel's emotional depth and narrative structure, describing it as entertaining and singular in its approach. Nutting noted that \"Parsons has gifted us with a profound, gutsy tale of grief's dismantling power.\"\nIn 2025, We Were the Universe won the Ken Kesey Award for Fiction at the Oregon Book Awards. The novel was also a finalist for the 37th Annual Lambda Literary Award for Bisexual Fiction.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year !! Work !! Award !! Category !! Result !!
