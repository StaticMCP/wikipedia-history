The War Hawks competed as a provisional division II team, transitioning from Division III. The War Hawks were led by Mason Miller in his first and only season as head coach.\nOn January 31, 2014, the university's Board of Trustees voted to withdraw the school's provisional division II status and remain in division III for all of its athletic programs. Following the board's announcement, several coaches stepped down from their positions, including Miller, who announced his resignation on March 29, 2014. Defensive coordinator Kendall Roberson was named interim head coach.\nOffseason\nCoaching changes\nHead coach Hal Mumme stepped down in January 2013, later taking an offensive assistant position at SMU. On January 30, offensive coordinator Mason Miller was named the program's 21st head coach. Quarterbacks coach Chase Holbrook was promoted to offensive coordinator while defensive backs coach Kendall Roberson was promoted to defensive coordinator.\nSchedule\n|\n|\n| site_stadium = Javelina Stadium\n| site_cityst = Kingsville, TX\n| score = 32–52\n| attend = 10,500\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Wilford Moore Stadium\n| site_cityst = Abilene, TX\n| score = 53–27\n| attend = 1,639\n}}\n|\n| homecoming = y\n| site_stadium = Wilford Moore Stadium\n| site_cityst = Abilene, TX\n| score = 35–48\n| attend = 3,042\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Memorial Stadium\n| site_cityst = Wichita Falls, TX\n| score = 20–66\n| attend = 6,121\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| site_stadium = Bulldog Stadium\n| site_cityst = Plainview, TX\n| score = 56–29\n| attend = 800\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Wilford Moore Stadium\n| site_cityst = Abilene, TX\n| score = 55–20\n| attend = 2,038\n}}\n}}\nGame summaries\nAt Abilene Christian\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
