It is also the first city in the province of Laguna as established by Commonwealth Act no. 520.\nThe city is also home to the see of the Roman Catholic Bishop of San Pablo, a diocese which oversees catholic churches in the province of Laguna.\nAs expressed in City Ordinance (CO) 2018–53 by the local government of San Pablo, the San Pablo Heritage zone was established to preserve and enshrine the legacy and history of the city.\nBoundaries\nThe area covers:\n* The core zone\n** Bounded on the North by the San Pablo Cathedral at the corner of T.
