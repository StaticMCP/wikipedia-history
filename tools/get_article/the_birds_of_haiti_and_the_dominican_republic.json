It was authored by Alexander Wetmore, with the assistance of Bradshaw H. Swales, and was published by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC in 1931.  It is in octavo format (248 x 156&nbsp;mm) and contains iv + 484 pages bound in a grey paper cover.  It includes 26 black-and-white plates, both of paintings of the birds by Allan Brooks, and of photographs of the habitat.\nThe book is an ornithological treatise on the avifauna of the island of Hispaniola (divided between the nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic) in the Caribbean.  It is based on the fieldwork carried out, and collections made, by various expeditions there, especially those of William Louis Abbott, and of Wetmore himself.\nThe first 57 pages of the book are taken up by accounts of the physiography of the island, the history of ornithological exploration and of fieldwork for the Smithsonian Institution there, as well as a general discussion of the avifauna.  This section also contains notes on adjacent islands including Gonave, Tortue, Grande Cayemite, Saona, and Navassa.  The rest of the book comprises individual accounts of the bird species recorded from Hispaniola, ending with a comprehensive bibliography and index.\nReferences\n*"
