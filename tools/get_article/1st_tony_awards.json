Perry was a co-founder of the revived and revised version the American Theatre Wing (ATW) in 1940, and the award were established by the ATW  in her memory after her death in 1946. Fellow ATW co-founder Louise Heims Beck was responsible for overseeing the organization of the 1st Tony Awards.\nBackground and ceremony\nPresented by the ATW, the Awards celebrated \"outstanding contributions to the current American theatre season.\" According to The New York Times, these awards \"do not designate their recipients as 'best' or 'first' but the classifications in which they are given will be elastic from year to year.\"  The ceremony, hosted by Brock Pemberton, was broadcast on radio station WOR and the Mutual Network.\nThe awards got their nickname, \"Tonys\", during the ceremony itself when Pemberton handed out an award and called it a \"Toni\", referring to the nickname of Antoinette Perry, co-founder of the American Theatre Wing.\nMusicals represented at the ceremony were Street Scene, Brigadoon and ''Finian's Rainbow. Oklahoma! and Carousel could not be nominated because, while although still playing their original runs at the time of the awards, they had opened too soon to qualify for the awards (Oklahoma! had opened in 1943, and Carousel in 1945).\nThe award itself was a scroll, an initialed sterling silver compact case for the women, and an engraved gold bill clip or cigarette lighter for the men.\nWinners\nNote: nominees are not shown\nPerformance\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"150\"|Award\n!width=\"200\"|Winner (s)\n|-\n|Actors-Play\n|José Ferrer in Cyrano de BergeracFredric March in Years Ago\n|-\n|Actresses-Play\n|Ingrid Bergman in Joan of LorraineHelen Hayes in Happy Birthday\n|-\n|Tony Award for Outstanding Newcomer\n|Patricia Neal in Another Part of the Forest\n|-\n|Tony Award for Best Performance in a Musical\n|David Wayne in Finian's Rainbow\n|-\n|}\nCraft\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"150\"|Award\n!width=\"200\"|Winner\n|-\n|Director\n|Elia Kazan for All My Sons\n|-\n|Costume Designer\n|Lucinda Ballard for Happy Birthday, Another Part of the Forest, Street Scene, John Loves Mary, The Chocolate Soldier\n|-\n|Choreographers\n|Agnes de Mille for BrigadoonMichael Kidd for Finian's Rainbow\n|-\n|Composer\n|Kurt Weill, Street Scene\n|-\n|}\nSpecial awards\nSource: The New York Times''\n*Dora Chamberlain - \"unfailing courtesy as treasurer of the Martin Beck Theatre\"\n*Mr. and Mrs. Ira Katzenberg - \"for enthusiasm as inveterate first-nighters\"\n*Jules Leventhal -  \"the season's most prolific backer and producer\"\n*P.A.
