It was released for the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST.\nThe 8-bit versions of the game were budget-priced releases on Firebird's \"Silver 199\" sub-label.\nGameplay\nThe player must dodge and destroy obstacles along a vertically scrolling screen. The end of each level has a large number of ships flying at the player from many angles.[http://homepages.tesco.net/parsonsp/html/warhawk.html Commodore 64 - Warhawk Page]\nReception\nComputer and Video Games reviewed the Atari version which they compared to Uridium. They admired the asteroid graphics but thought those of the aliens were a little weak though \"they swoop around fast enough to keep you on your toes\". The game was awarded a 7/10 score.\nCommodore User praised the game's presentation, graphics and enemy AI which was considered to be superior to Uridiums. It was given an 8/10 overall score.\nLegacy\nThe following year, Proteus Developments developed Tanium, published by Players Software in 1988. The version for the Commodore 64 was declared to be Warhawk II on the title screen and the link was mentioned in reviews, but was not indicated in versions for other platforms.\nA re-envisioning of the game was written for the Nintendo DS. While not a complete remake of the original game, it retains the same graphical feel and gameplay mechanics as the original. This project also involved Michael Ware from the development team of the 1986 release. Warhawk was remade for the ZX Spectrum Next with a version coded by Michael Ware and Jim Bagley. It received a physical release in spring 2020.\nReferences"
