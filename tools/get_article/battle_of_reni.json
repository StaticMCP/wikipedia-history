The Crimean-Turkish army defeated the Christians, ending Kunicki's campaign.\nBackground\nOn August 24, 1683, the Polish king, John III Sobieski, appointed Stefan Kunicki with mission of recruiting Cossacks for a war against the Ottomans. The new Hetman had appointed Kazimyr Staneskyi and . Kunicki recruited 5,000 to 6,000 men, including 2,000 left-bank Cossacks, 400 Polish soldiers, 200 Zaporozhians, and 200–300 Don Cossacks. The campaign was partially financed by the Papacy, which helped the Cossacks buy several guns, gunpowder, and bullets. In November 1683, the Polish-Cossack army was joined by the pro-Polish Moldavian prince, Ștefan Petriceicu. On December 5, the Polish-Cossack-Moldavian army defeated the Crimean-Ottoman army in Chițcani. After this, the Cossack received intelligence about the approach of the remaining Ottoman army from Vienna.\nBattle\nAs they were marching, they met a large Crimean army of 10,000 to 12,000 men and 7 cannons, alongside Janissaries led by Haci II Giray. The Allies were overtaken on December 30. The battles lasted for five days, resisting the Crimeans while waiting for Polish reinforcements from Kraków. On December 31, the battle raged all day. On January 1, a council was held, and it is unknown what decision was made there. The next two days saw a fierce onslaught during which the allies were unable to push back the enemy. Kunicki decided to retreat with 300–500 cavalry, leaving Andri Mohyla with the remaining troops of 4,500. He fought with the Tatars the whole day, and both sides sustained heavy casualties before retreating at night. Many of the Cossacks perished while attempting to cross the Prut river. Andrii returned with only 3,000 men to Ukraine, ending the battle on January 4.\nAftermath\nKunicki attempted to explain his defeat to the Polish king by stating the dragoons fled from the field, allowing the Cossacks to flee as well. The Moldavians and the Cossacks who remained in the field blamed Kunicki for their defeat. Two months later, Kunicki was deposed and killed for his failures.\nReferences\nSources\n* Taras Vasilyevich Chukhlib (2007), The winter campaign of 1683–1684 of the Ukrainian Cossacks against the Ottomans to the Black Sea Steppe.[https://www.academia.edu/10297559/%D0%A7%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%B1_%D0%A2_%D0%92_%D0%97%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D1%96%D0%B4_1683_1684_%D1%80%D1%80_%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8_%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%96%D0%B2_%D0%B4%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83_%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%87%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8F_%D1%83_IX_%D1%81%D1%82_%D0%B4%D0%BE_%D0%BD_%D0%B5_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BA%D1%83_%D0%A5%D0%86%D0%A5_%D1%81%D1%82_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%96%D1%97_%D0%B7_%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D1%97_%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%85%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%96%D1%97_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%97%D0%B2_%D0%86%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82_%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D1%97_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%9D_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D0%B8_2007_1]\n* Rabbi David Lekhno (2021), Debar Śepatayim, An Ottoman Hebrew Chronicle from the Crimea (1683–1730).[https://books.google.com/books?id=elw3EAAAQBAJ&dq=%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8+1683&pg=PT298]\n* Joseph von Hammer (1838), Histoire de l'Empire Ottoman depuis son origine jusqu'à nos jours.[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5sBfSLTuc0C&dq=Kunicki+December+30+1683&pg=PA132]"
