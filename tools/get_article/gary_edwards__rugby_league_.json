He played for the Balmain and North Sydney in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) and ARL competitions.\nPlaying career\nEdwards made his first grade debut for North Sydney against Balmain in round 15 1993 at North Sydney Oval.  Edwards only made 4 appearances for Norths over 2 seasons and was released by the club after failing to break his way into the first team.\nIn 1995, Edwards signed for Balmain who had recently changed their name to the \"Sydney Tigers\" and moved their home games to Parramatta Stadium at the start of the Super League war.  The drastic move followed other clubs such as Canterbury who had changed their name to the \"Sydney Bulldogs\" and also relocated to Parramatta.\nEdwards scored 2 tries on debut for the club in round 1 1995 as they defeated Eastern Suburbs 24–18 at Parramatta Stadium.  In round 3 1995, Edwards scored his second double of the year as Balmain defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 38–16.  Edwards would finish the year with 6 tries from 12 matches.\nIn 1996, Edwards scored 4 tries in 15 games as the club finished 12th on the table.  Before the start of the 1997 season, Balmain relocated their home games back to Leichhardt Oval and reverted to their original name after the Sydney Tigers experiment was deemed a failure with the average attendance for home matches over the two seasons only reaching 6000 people.\nEdwards final game for Balmain came in round 8 1997 against the South Queensland Crushers which Balmain won 18–16 at Lang Park.\nReferences"
