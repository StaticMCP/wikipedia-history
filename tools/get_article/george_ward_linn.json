These included The Columbian in 1901, The Columbian Philatelist, from 1901 to 1907, Stamp News in 1909, and The Stamp Collector from 1909 to 1911.\nThe Stamp Collector's Journal had eight volumes beginning in 1910 and was first known as Linn's Way.\nLinn began publishing philatelic handbooks including works on Mexican and American philately beginning circa 1910.  These include The Making of United States Stamps [1913], Mexico: the White and Green Seal Issues of Sonora [1916], The War Stamps of Mexico [1917] and The Paid Markings on the 3 cent U.S. Stamp of 1861'' [1955].  Linn wrote the above works except for the 1913 work; author is Frank E. Goodwin.\nLinn's Linprint imprint published ''Linprint's Catalog of Philatelic Labels in 1940.\nLinn also published a stamp album Stamps of the World.\nPhilatelic activity\nLinn was, at times, a stamp dealer and conducted stamp auctions. However, he was most interested in promoting stamp collecting and in the creation of stamp clubs. He attended most of the American Philatelic Society stamp shows and conventions held during his lifetime and created philatelic souvenirs for them.\nLinn will be remembered by first day cover collectors for his creating the first pre-printed cacheted first day cover. This cover commemorated the passing of President Warren G. Harding, and featured the use of the black 2-cent \"mourning stamp\" (Scott No. 610) issued September 1, 1923.\nHonors and awards\nBecause of his dedication to advancing the hobby of stamp collecting, he was named to the American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame in 1967.\nThe ASDA or American Stamp Dealers Association placed Linn in its Hall of Fame in 2013.\nLegacy\nLinn's Weekly Stamp News'' continues to be printed to this day (as of 2017), and subscribers can read it online.\nSee also\n* Philately\n* Philatelic literature\nReferences\n* [https://classic.stamps.org/HOF-1965#Linn George Ward Linn]"
