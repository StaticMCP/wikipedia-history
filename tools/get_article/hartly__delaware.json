Town meetings are held once every two months at the Hartly Volunteer Fire Company.\nIn 2015, the town of Hartly had no functioning government after fatigue had hit the Town Council about three years earlier and many members did not return to their posts. As a result, the town government could not pay bills, collect taxes, enforce codes, or apply for state aid. The town had not collected taxes for two years and was in thousands of dollars of debt. As a result, the town needed to reform its government or unincorporate and be governed directly by Kent County. A meeting was held in January 2015 at the Hartly Volunteer Fire Company on reforming the town government. The meeting was attended by about 150 people, of which 16 lived in the town of Hartly and could run for office.\nInfrastructure\nTransportation\nHartly is located at the intersection of Delaware Route 11 and Delaware Route 44.
