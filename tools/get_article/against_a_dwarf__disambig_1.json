This is then followed by mixing grated celandine with ale and invoking the names of saints, including the Welsh Saint Macutus.\nRemedy XCIIIb\nRemedy XCIIIb is the most detailed of the  charms, consisting of writing the names of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus on Communion wafers before reciting a :\n|attr2=Hines Translation}}\nIt has been noted that several components of this charm suggest that it was already old at the time of its recording, such as the use of the word \"\", whose meaning is unknown now, would have had no clear meaning even at the time of writing, and deores sweostar which is not metrical, since the first word should begin with an alliterating vowel.\nInterpretation and discussion\nIt has been argued that the  charms form part of a wider North Sea Germanic tradition that links dwarfs to the onset of sickness, also attested in the 8th century CE Ribe skull fragment and a lead plaque found near Fakenham in Norfolk dating to the 8th–11th century CE. In this cultural context, it has been argued that attempting to discriminate between the dwarf and the disease it is causing is not necessarily helpful, given that the banishing or killing of the harmful dwarf also is believed to lead to recovery from the sickness.\nIt has been proposed that the sickness in question is related to sleeping because of the inclusion of the Seven Sleepers in the charm. According to one source, \"The names of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus occur in various charms of the Middle Ages. They are usually, as might be expected, to secure sleep, but in some cases are to be employed against fever\".\nThe conception of the dwarf in remedy XCIIIb has been proposed to link to the concept of a mare, a harmful being in Germanic folklore that is the root of the word \"nightmare\" and has been equated with the phenomenon of sleep paralysis. According to this theory, the dwarf in this charm is a manifestation of a night monster, as dwarfs were linked to the idea of harmful spirits and thought to be capable of causing physical harm. Similarity between the dwarf in XCIIIb and mares in medieval and later Germanic folklore is further seen in the conception of both beings riding their victims, causing symptoms such as injury, hallucinations and fevers.\nSee also\n* Apotropaic magic\n* Canterbury charm\n* Kvinneby amulet\n* Sigtuna amulet I\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nSecondary\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
