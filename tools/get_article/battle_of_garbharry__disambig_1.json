It was the last battle to be fought between the Clan Mackay and Clan Sutherland. It was fought \"beside the water of Garbharry\", at \"the foot of the hill called Beinn-mhor, in Berriedale\". This has been recognised as the area around Garvery Hill, including Big and Little Garvery Burn, just south of Morven (the Anglicised name from A' Mhòr Beinn / Beinn-Mhòr, meaning 'The Big Hill), where presumably some of the soldiers drowned.\nBackground\nIn 1555, John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland was commissioned by the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise to punish Iye MacKay, chief of the Clan Mackay for his failure to attend her in Inverness. The Earl destroyed the Mackay's main stronghold on the north coast, Borve Castle north of Farr, which the Clan Mackay had used to carry out raids on the Clan Sutherland. The Earl of Sutherland confronted Iye Mackay in Strathbrora, forcing him to surrender himself to imprisonment in Edinburgh. Iye Mackay's first cousin John-More Mackay then assumed power. He led a raid towards Helmsdale in Sutherland, and burnt the chapel of St. Ninian's at Navidale just north of Helmsdale before pulling back.\nThe Clan Sutherland then assembled a force under MacJames, the Terell of the Doil and James MacWilliam and set off in pursuit. They caught up with the Mackays in Berriedale, near Garbharry where the battle took place.\nBattle\nAccording to the account given in Conflicts of the Clans, the Sutherlands overtook the Mackay of Strathnaver men at the foot of the hill called Beinn-mhor, in Berriedale, and invaded them beside the water of Garbharry, where then ensued a cruel conflict, fought with great obstinacy. The Strathnaver men were overthrown and chased; about 120 of them were slain, and some drowned in Garbharry.\nAftermath\nThe Battle of Garbharry is cited as being the last battle fought between the Clan Mackay and Clan Sutherland. It would appear that this is the case as far as the chief of Mackays, who was designated as \"of Strathnaver\" is concerned, although 35 years later a half-brother of Mackay of Strathnaver fought against the Earl of Sutherland at the Battle of Clynetradwell.\nReferences"
