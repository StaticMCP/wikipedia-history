The militia of Liège suffered a heavy defeat.\nCause\nIn 1390, John of Bavaria, youngest son of Duke Albert I, Duke of Bavaria only aged 17, had become Prince-Bishop of Liège, with the support of Pope Boniface IX. His rule was a disaster. His authoritarian style clashed with the nobles and burghers of the Prince-Bishopric, who had acquired a certain degree of liberty over the years. He had already been expelled several times, when a new conflict in 1408 made him flee to Maastricht. Henry of Horne, Lord of Perwez was proclaimed Mambour and his son Prince-Bishop. John of Bavaria turned for help to his powerful family.\nJohn's brother was William VI of Hainaut and his brother-in-law John the Fearless of Burgundy. Together with William II, Marquis of Namur, they raised an army and marched against the citizens of Liège.\nHenri of Horne was aware that his troops were no match for the professional army heading his way, and therefore proposed to leave the city and start a guerilla war from the countryside. This was refused by the hait-droits, the most radical part of the rebels.\nThe battle\nThe rebels marched towards the enemy and took up position on a little hill in open field between the villages of Othée, Rutten, and Herstappe.  To face them Duke John decided upon a tactical plan that mimicked the winning English system during the Hundred Years' War. His main battle of men-at-arms stood dismounted in the center flanked by 2,000 archers, while 400 other men-at-arms and 1,000 light horsemen remained mounted in reserve. Despite the bravery of the rebels attack they were repulsed by the ferocious Burgundian archery and then surrounded by the Duke's reserve cavalry and cut to pieces. On the orders of the Duke, no mercy was given. Henri of Horne, his son, and most of the nobles were amongst the dead.\nAftermath\nJohn of Bavaria returned from Maastricht and started a brutal repression on the city. The ensuing executions of leading insurgents and their families, including the widow of Henry of Horne, led to John of Bavaria's nickname \"the Pitiless.\" Burgundian influence was extended over the city and over the bishopric of Liège.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* Jean-Louis Kupper, Philippe George, Charles le Téméraire, de la violence et du sacré, éditions du Perron, juin 2007, p.&nbsp;13.\n* [http://perso.infonie.be/liege06/09neufc.htm La bataille d'Othée]\n* [http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RHIS&ID_NUMPUBLIE=RHIS_013&ID_ARTICLE=RHIS_013_0639#re8no8 Si vera est fama]\n* [http://medieval2.heavengames.com/m2tw/history/historical_battles_folder/battle_of_othee_folder/index.shtml Medieval II]"
