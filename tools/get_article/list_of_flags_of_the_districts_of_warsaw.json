They are, from top to bottom, light green, yellow, and red. The flag colours are inspired by the district coat of arms. The green colour symbolizes hope, happiness, and honour, yellow (golden) colour, nobleness, kindness, and intelligence, and the red colour, the bravery, and valor. The aspect ratio of the flag proportions, of its height to width, is 5:8. Despite that, the district also uses the flag with proportions of around 15:28. The flag was adopted on 28 April 1995 as the symbol of Gmina Warsaw-Białołęka, which was replaced by the district of Białołęka on 27 October 2002. Białołęka continues to use the flag to the present day.\nUrsynów\nThe flag of Ursynów is a divided into three horizontal stripes, that were, from the top to bottom, navy blue, yellow, and red. The yellow and red stripes reference the flag of Warsaw, while meaning behind the blue stripe is unknown. The aspect ratio of flag proportions, of its height to its width, is described in the establishing resolution as 100:99, although in practice, such proportions are not used. Instead, the flag is usually given a shape of a wider rectangle, with the proportions of 5:8. The proportion of the stripes to each other are described as equal 26:7:7, however, those proportion also remain unused in practice. Instead, the flag is usually presented with the blue stripe two times bigger than the remaining two stripes, with the proportion equal 2:1:1. The flag was adopted on 14 February 1995, as the symbol of Gmina Warsaw-Ursynów, which on 27 October 2002, was replaced by the district of Ursynów, which continues to use the flag present day.\nFormer municipal flags (1994–2002)\nIn 1994, the city of Warsaw was divided into ten gminas (municipalities), which following their creation, begun establishing their symbols, including flags. Out of ten, six municipalities had adopted flag designs. They were: Warsaw-Bielany, Warsaw-Rembertów, Warsaw-Targówek, Warsaw-Ursus, Warsaw-Ursynów, and Warsaw-Wawer. The municipalities of Warsaw-Centre, and Warsaw-Wilanów did not adopt any flag design, while municipalities of Warsaw-Bemowo, and Warsaw-Włochy, stated in legal documents some bare descriptions of flag designs, which however were not intelligible, and such, not used. The municipalities existed until 27 October 2002, when they were replaced by the district. Most of them did not continue to use the flags of the predecessors, with the exception of a few of them.\nBemowo\ncoat of arms of Gmina Warsaw-Bemowo.]]\nThe Gmina Warsaw-Bemowo never had its own flag. However, the resolution from 11 January 1996 establishing the municipal coat of arms, stated that the \"gmina (municipality) coat of arms should be placed on the flags, and next to the official names of the gmina (municipilaty)\". It remains unknown how such statement was meant to be interpreted.

They were yellow on top, and red on bottom, which were the same colours, as those of the flag of Warsaw. According to the illustration attached to the establishing law resolution, the aspect ratio of the flag proportion of its height to its width, were 53:103 (1:1.94). Despite that, the flag flown at the municipal hall building had been noted to have its proportions more closer to 2:3. The flag of Warsaw, after which this flag had been based, did not have specified proportions. The flag of Gmina Warsaw-Bielany was adopted on 16 December 1995.

They were placed in two horizontal rows, with the fields on the left having the width of 1/3 of the flag width. The top left, and bottom right fields were yellow, while the top right, and bottom left fields, red. The colours were based on the yellow and red flag of Warsaw.

They were, from top to bottom, white, yellow, and red. The colours were the same, as those of the coat of arms, and it was stated by the municipality, that said colours were chosen for the flag, as white and red are used in the flag of Poland, and yellow, and red, in the flag of Warsaw.

The colours of the stripes, from top to bottom, were: green, yellow, red, and green. The flag was originally introduced in the resolution from 20 December 1996, which however was not approved, due to the opposition by the voivode of the Warsaw Voivodeship, how argued that legally, gminas (municipalities) were not permitted to have their own flags. Such decision was contested by the municipality, which eventually led to the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland siding with the voivode's decision, in the hearing on 31 January 1997. Despite that, using the legal loopholes, the municipality adopted the design on 29 April 1997, in the municipal by-law, in which, the design was referred to as the \"colours of the municipality\", instead of a \"flag\".\nIn the original 1996 resolution, there was also introduced the design of the flag of municipality mayor, which depicted a brown bear standing on its back feet, holding a yellow halberd, placed in the flag centre, on a green background. The flag was a banner of arms of the municipal coat of arms.

The letter W commemorates the Wawer massacre, during which, on the night of 26 to 27 December 1939, 107 Polish civilians were executed by Nazi Germany officers, in the occupied Wawer, and the inscriptions \"Wawer pomścimy\" (from Polish: we will revenge Wawer), that were written on the building walls by inhabitants of Warsaw, following the massacre.
