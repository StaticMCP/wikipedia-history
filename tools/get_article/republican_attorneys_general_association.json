Its Democratic counterpart is the Democratic Attorneys General Association.\nOperations\nRAGA operated as an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee until 2014, when RAGA was split off. In 2023, the largest donations came from the Concord Fund, with total donations from Concord since 2014 coming to $16.8 million. Since 2020 the group has received about $5.8 million in donations from the oil and gas industry.\nControversy\nRAGA operates The Rule of Law Defense Fund, which became the center of controversy following revelations that it had sponsored mass robocalls urging recipients to support President Donald Trump's rally in front of the Capitol on January 6; the rally resulted in the 2021 United States Capitol attack. The robocall did not advocate for violence or storming the Capitol complex.\nFollowing the January 6 attack, donations to RAGA dropped significantly. The executive director of RAGA resigned less than a week after the robocall and attack. Chairman Christopher M. Carr, Georgia's attorney general, resigned in April 2021 as a result of the split within the group over the January 6 attack.\nExternal links\n* [https://republicanags.com/ Official website]\nSee also\n* Democratic Attorneys General Association\n* State attorney general\nNotes\nReferences"
