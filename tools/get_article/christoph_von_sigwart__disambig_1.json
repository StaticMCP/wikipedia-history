He was the son of philosopher Heinrich Christoph Wilhelm Sigwart (31 August 1789&nbsp;– 16 November 1844).\nLife\nAfter a course of philosophy and theology, Sigwart became professor at the Blaubeuren (in 1859) and at Tübingen (in 1865).\nPhilosophical work\nThe first volume of Sigwart's principal work, Logik, was published in 1873 and took an important place among contributions to logical theory in the late nineteenth century. In the preface to the first edition, Sigwart explains that he makes no attempt to appreciate the logical theories of his predecessors; he intended to construct a theory of logic, complete in itself.\nThe Logik represents the results of a long and careful study not only of German but also of English logicians. In 1895 an English translation by Helen Dendy was published in London. Chapter 5 of the second volume is especially interesting to English thinkers as it contains a profound examination of the induction theories of Francis Bacon, John Stuart Mill and David Hume. His Kleine Schriften contains valuable criticisms on Paracelsus and Giordano Bruno.\nQuotations\nPublications\n* Ulrich Zwingli, der Charakter seiner Theologie (1855).
