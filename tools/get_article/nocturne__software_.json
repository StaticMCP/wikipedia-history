Spotify officially discontinued support for the Car Thing on December 9, 2024, effectively rendering the device non-functional.\nSoftware\nThe software is developed as an open-source initiative, allowing contributors to participate in the project. While Nocturne enables the device to regain functionality, it relies on additional hardware due to the Car Thing's limited specifications, which include 512&nbsp;MB of RAM and 4&nbsp;GB of internal storage powered by an Amlogic S905D2 SoC. Users must pair the Car Thing with a Raspberry Pi to overcome these limitations.\nNocturne functions either in vehicles, similar to the Car Thing's original use, or as a desktop music controller. The software offers features such as full playback controls, playlist management, real-time interface updates, and artist and album exploration, requiring a Spotify Premium account to function.\nSee also\n* Hacking of consumer electronics\nReferences"
