      "text": "# Mulliner Park Ward\n\nMulliner Park Ward was a coachbuilder formed as a subsidiary by Rolls-Royce in 1961 to supply it custom bodywork for its automobiles. Located in Hythe Road, Willesden, London, it was created by merging two existing Rolls-Royce properties, Park Ward of Willesden, London, a subsidiary since 1939 and H. J. Mulliner & Co. of Chiswick, a subsidiary since 1959. It principally built bodies and interiors for Rolls-Royce and Bentley motor cars, but also others such as Alvis. The coachbuilding business closed in 1991 but the Mulliner name is used for the personal commissioning department of the current Bentley manufacturer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rrab.com/mpw.htm Rolls-Royce Coachbuilder: Mulliner Park Ward]\n*[http://www.rolls-royce-wiki.de/index.php/Mulliner_Park_Ward Mulliner Park Ward, in the Rolls-Royce Wiki]"
