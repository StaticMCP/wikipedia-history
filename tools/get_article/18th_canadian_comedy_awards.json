Web series You Got Trumped was the big winner, receiving three Beavers from its four nominations.\nReorganization and awards\nThe Canadian Comedy Awards (CCA) award excellence in Canadian comedy at home and abroad.  Due to a delay in the previous awards season, these awards also covered an 18-month period, from 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2017, in order to return to annual eligibility.  This edition of the awards consolidated the number of categories to 22, largely by combining separate male and female performance categories.\nIndustry members chose the nominees in each category.  Each industry member could declare one category as their field of \"expertise\", giving their nomination and vote in that single category three times the normal weight.  After nominations closed, voting was opened for the top five nominees in each category.  13 categories were open to public voting and 9 were exclusively decided by industry members.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface:\nMultimedia\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Comedic Artist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Short\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Mike MacDonald\n* Samantha Bee\n* Mark Little\n* Barry Julien\n* Aurora Browne\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Day Players\n* Baby Shower\n* Fowl Play\n* Grocery Store Action Movie\n* Here's Video Game News\n* Jeremy and Margot Make a Baby\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Feature\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Performance in a Feature\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  '''Don't Talk to Irene'\n* Another WolfCop\n* Entanglement\n* Filth City\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Pat Thornton – Filth City\n* Amy Matysio – Another WolfCop\n* Michelle McLeod – ''Don't Talk to Irene\n* Thomas Middleditch – Entanglement\n* Yannick Bisson – Another WolfCop\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Direction in a Feature\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Writing in a Feature\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Peter Benson – Marrying The Family\n* Andy King – Filth City\n* Jason James – Entanglement\n* Lowell Dean – Another WolfCop\n* Pat Mills – Don't Talk to Irene\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Pat Mills – '''Don't Talk to Irene'\n* Andy King and Danny Polishchuck – Filth City\n* Jason Filiatrualt – Entanglement\n* Lowell Dean – Another WolfCop\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Audio Show or Series\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Comedy Album\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Taggart & Torrens Podcast\n* Alex Wood Quits Everything\n* Comic Jenius\n* Killed to Death\n* Vest of Friends Podcast\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Andrew Chapman – Oh Yeah This\n* Garrett Jamieson & Sprattacus – Superdrunkgnome\n* Marty Topps – Wetter Than Wet\n* Rob Pue – Puegilist\n* Shirley Gnome – Taking It Up The Notch\n* Spencer Streichert – Winning By Default\n|}\nLive\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Live Production\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Taped Live Performance\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  The Adventures of Tom Shadow\n* Yes, Android\n* Party Today Panic Tomorrow\n* Everything Is Great Again\n* 32 Short Sketches About Bees\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Crush Improv – 'Crush Ten: Crush Improv's Tenth Anniversary Special'\n* Todd Graham – Just for Laughs: All Access Gala\n* Ron James – The High Road\n* Laurie Elliott – Just For Laughs Gala\n* David Pryde – Just for Laughs 375\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Live Ensemble\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Standup Comic\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'Cast of The Adventures of Tom Shadow'\n* The Sunday Service Improv Troupe\n* Sex T-Rex\n* Cast of Party Today Panic Tomorrow\n* Cast of Everything Is Great Again\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Martha Chaves\n* Rob Pue\n* Kate Davis\n* Graham Clark\n* Gavin Stephens\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Variety Act\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Breakout Artist\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Bob Cates\nCanadian Comedy Awards\n|work=\n|publisher=Canadian Comedy Foundation for Excellence\n|location=\n|agency=\n|first=\n|last=\n|author=\n|author-link=\n|date=23 June 2018\n|access-date=23 June 2018\n|url-status=live\n|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180802165656/https://www.canadiancomedyawards.org/faq.php?year=2018\n|archive-date=2 August 2018\n}}\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://www.canadiancomedyawards.org/ Canadian Comedy Awards official website]"
