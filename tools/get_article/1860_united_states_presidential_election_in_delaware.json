State voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nDelaware was won by the Southern Democratic candidate 14th Vice President of the United States John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky and his running mate Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon. They defeated the Constitutional Union candidate Senator John Bell of Tennessee and his running mate Governor of Massachusetts Edward Everett, Republican candidate Illinois Representative Abraham Lincoln and his running mate Senator Hannibal Hamlin of Maine as well as Democratic candidate 15th Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and his running mate 41st Governor of Georgia Herschel V. Johnson. Breckinridge won the state by a margin of 21.41%.\nThe Republicans ran a slate of electors for Lincoln, but did not nominate any candidates for other federal and state offices. The party instead endorsed the candidates of the People's Party, an anti-Democratic coalition that supported the Republican presidential ticket.\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+1860 United States presidential election in Delaware\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" |John C.
