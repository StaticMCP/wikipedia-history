Lake Isabel is northeast of the peak.\nGeology\nLike other mountains in Glacier National Park, the peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was initially uplifted beginning 170&nbsp;million years ago when the Lewis Overthrust fault pushed an enormous slab of precambrian rocks  thick,  wide and  long over younger rock of the cretaceous period.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, the peak is located in an alpine subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool to warm summers. Temperatures can drop below −10&nbsp;°F with wind chill factors below −30&nbsp;°F.\nSee also\n* List of mountains and mountain ranges of Glacier National Park (U.S.)\nReferences"
