The word \"foss\" derives from the Latin fossa, meaning \"ditch\" or \"trench.\" According to Pausanias the outcome of the battle was determined by trickery. The Spartans bribed Aristocrates of Orchomenus, the king of the Arcadians, to withdraw his men just as the battle was beginning. This resulted in the slaughter of the Messenians. Aristocrates was later stoned to death by the Arcadians for this treachery.\nReferences and further reading\nSources\n* Montagu, John Drogo.
