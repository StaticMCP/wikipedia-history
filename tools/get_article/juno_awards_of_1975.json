Paul Anka was the host for the ceremonies, which were broadcast for the first time. Canadians were able to watch the event on CBC Television from 10pm Eastern Time.\nStompin' Tom Connors, Susan Jacks, Terry Jacks, Andy Kim, Anne Murray, and The Stampeders appeared at the ceremonies.\nWith the move to television, control over the Junos shifted from Walt Grealis' RPM Magazine to the new Canadian Music Awards Association.
