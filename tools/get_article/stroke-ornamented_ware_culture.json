STK or STbK), Stroked Pottery culture, Danubian Ib culture of V. Gordon Childe, or Middle Danubian culture is the successor of the Linear Pottery culture, a major archaeological horizon of the European Neolithic  in Central Europe.\nThe STK flourishes during approximately  4900-4400 BC.\nCentered on Silesia in Poland, eastern Germany, and the northern Czech Republic, it overlaps with the Lengyel horizon to the south and the Rössen culture to the west.\nDescription\nThe STbK and the Notenkopfkeramik (Musical Note pottery) are a development of the LBK. Much it features incised zig-zag bands going around the pot, with punctures at the line segment junctions. The STK abandons incision in favor bands of small punctures, also in zig-zag patterns, with a vertical band dividing each angle. The effect is a band pattern of contiguous A-frames.\nWhere the Musical Note pottery expanded east over the Bug River, the STK moved down the Vistula and Elbe. The spread of this style must have been basically the transmission of cultural objects.\nThe homes of the STK people show a slight modification that became a major feature of later cultures: one end of the long house was made shorter than the other to achieve a trapezoidal shape. The reason for this modification remains obscure. Also, the STK people developed a preference for cremation rather than burial. The preceding early LBK had used both methods.\nGoseck circle\n, c. 4900 BC]]\nAn unusual structure associated with STK has been found at Goseck, southwest of Berlin in Saxony-Anhalt : a large, double concentric ring of post holes pierced by gates and surrounded by a circular ditch. The placement of the gates and some of the posts lead some investigators to hypothesize an observatory similar to Stonehenge, but in wood rather than stone; i.e., the posts mark some positions of celestial bodies.\nGallery\nFile:Stroke-ornamented Ware, City of Prague Museum, PJ0000062, 175581.jpg|Stroke-ornamented Ware, City of Prague Museum\nFile:MUFT - Bad Frankenhausen Stichbandkeramik Kumpf.jpg|Museum for Prehistory, Thuringia\nFile:Smac Neolithikum 061.jpg|State Museum of Archaeology, Chemnitz\nFile:Schuchhardt Stichbandkeramik Benditz.jpg|State Museum of Prehistory, Berlin\nFile:Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart Neolithikum 023.jpg|State Museum of Württemberg, Stuttgart\nFile:Smac Neolithikum 013.jpg|Ceramic figurine\nFile:Necklace, river mussels, Stroke-ornamented Ware culture, City of Prague Museum, 200350.jpg|Shell necklace\nFile:Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart Neolithikum 027.jpg|Bracelets\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060304014919/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/STK.htm Stichbandkeramik (Baldia)]"
