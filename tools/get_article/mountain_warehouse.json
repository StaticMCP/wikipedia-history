Investment company 21 Invest (now Investindustrial) were Karrimor's lead investor.\n21 Invest sold Karrimor's core business to South African leisure group Cullinan Holdings in February 1999. The stores, which were initially branded Karrimor, were subsequently re-branded to Mountain Warehouse. Under the new name, Mountain Warehouse began selling multi-branded outdoor clothing and equipment as well as its recently launched own brand of clothing.\nIn August 2002, NBGI Private Equity acquired the business from 21 Invest and managing Director Mark Neale, buying a majority stake in the company. CEO Neale reinvested most of his proceeds into the new acquisition. In the years that NBGI worked with Mountain Warehouse, their own brand product offering increased from 5% to 80%.\nIn July 2007, Mountain Warehouse management around Neale bought out NBGI Private Equity for £15m, backed by Icelandic investment fund KCAJ.\nIn August 2010, the private-equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, LDC, took a 23% minority stake in the business as part of another £47m buyout by Mountain Warehouse management.\nIn November 2013, the management team led by founder and CEO Mark Neale bought out minority shareholder LDC to take full ownership of the retail chain. Mr Neale personally owns 85% of the business. The £85m deal was backed by the Royal Bank of Scotland and asset management firm Alcentra.\nIn 2015, Mountain Warehouse Holdings Limited, set up a new company ‘Zakti Activeware’ which was the new name for ‘Mountain Warehouse Active’ range, and transferred a lot of stock to the new stores. They were closed in 2018, and the website now redirects to their 'Active People' range.\nIn 2018, Mountain Warehouse Holdings Limited set up another new company ‘Neon Sheep’ to break into the gifts and accessories market, but these stores were closed in 2022.\nIn 2021 fashion retailer Animal was acquired for previous owner H Young Holdings launching it online in the same year. By 2024 Animal store were reopening.\nOn September 3, 2024, Mountain Warehouse acquired the US-based retailer Eastern Mountain Sports for $10 million.\nStores\n, Cumbria]]\nMountain Warehouse has over 400 stores in the UK, North America, Europe and New Zealand, including stores in Dublin, Ireland, Vienna, Austria, and stores in Poland including Warsaw.\nThe first Mountain Warehouse store opened in 1997.
