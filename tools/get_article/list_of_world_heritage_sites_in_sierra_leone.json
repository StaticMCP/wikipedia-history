Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Sierra Leone accepted the convention on January 7, 2005, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. Sierra Leone has one World Heritage Sites and a further four sites on the tentative list. The first site, the Gola-Tiwai Complex, was added to the list in 2025.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Gola-Tiwai Complex\n|\n| Eastern Province\n| 2025\n| 1746; ix, x (natural)\n|\n|}\nTentative List\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Sierra Leone maintains four properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Western Area Peninsula National Park\n|\n| Western Area\n| 2012\n| iii, vii, ix (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Old Fourah Bay College Building\n|\n| Western Area\n| 2012\n| iii, (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bunce Island\n|\n| North West Province\n| 2012\n| ii, iii, (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Gateway to the Old King’s Yards\n|\n| Western Area\n| 2012\n| iii, (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
