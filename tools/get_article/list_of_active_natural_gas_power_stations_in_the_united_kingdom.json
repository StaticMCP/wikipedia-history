Dropping to 72 TWh in 2024, generating 26% of GB power. This is expected to fall to 5% by 2030, with total generation from other low carbon sources expected to exceed demand enabling net exports.\nThe decline is largely due to the increase in renewable sources outweighing the decline of coal, and an overall reduction in demand.\nPhase-out of coal in the United Kingdom\nIn November 2015, the UK Government announced that all the remaining fourteen coal-fired power stations would be closed by 2025. In November 2017 the UK Government co-founded the Powering Past Coal Alliance. In June 2021, the government said it would end coal power by October 2024.\nThe United Kingdom had continuously burned coal for the generation of electricity since the opening of Holborn Viaduct power station in 1882. On 21 April 2017, for the first time since 1882, the GB grid had a 24-hour period without any generation from coal power. In May 2019 the GB grid went its first full week without any coal power. In May 2020 the GB grid beat the previous record and did not use coal generation for over a month.\nBy 2024, the use of coal power had decreased to historic lows not seen since before the Industrial Revolution. Coal supplied just 0.5% of GB electricity in 2024, down from 30% in 2014. UK electricity became entirely coal-free on 30 September 2024.\nList of active gas power stations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%;border:0px;text-align:center;line-height:150%;table-layout: fixed\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" |Location\n! scope=\"col\" |Owner\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Date commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Planned closure date\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Total capacity (GW)\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n|-\n|Ballylumford C\n|Northern Ireland\n|EPUKi\n|2003\n|\n|0.62\n|\n|\n|-\n|Carrington\n|North West\n|ESB\n|2016\n|\n|0.91\n|\n|\n|-\n|Connahs Quay\n|Wales\n|Uniper\n|1996\n|\n|1.38\n| Fuelled by sour gas\n|\n|-\n|Coolkeeragh\n|Northern Ireland\n|ESB\n|2004\n|\n|0.41\n|\n|\n|-\n|Corby\n|East Midlands\n|ESB\n|1994\n|\n|0.41\n|\n|\n|-\n|Coryton\n|East England\n|Intergen\n|2002\n|\n|0.80\n|\n|\n|-\n|Cottam Development Centre\n|East Midlands\n|Uniper\n|1998\n|\n|0.45\n|\n|\n|-\n|Damhead Creek\n|South East\n|Vitol\n|2000\n|\n|0.81\n|\n|\n|-\n|Didcot B\n|South East\n|RWE Generation UK\n|1998\n|\n|1.45\n|\n|\n|-\n|Enfield\n|London\n|Uniper\n|1999\n|\n|0.41\n|\n|\n|-\n|Grain CHP\n|South East\n|Uniper\n|2011\n|\n|1.52\n|\n|\n|-\n|Great Yarmouth\n|East England\n|RWE Generation UK\n|2001\n|\n|0.42\n|\n|\n|-\n|Keadby\n|Yorkshire and Humber\n|SSE plc\n|1994\n|\n|0.74\n|\n|\n|-\n|Langage\n|South West\n|EPUKi\n|2010\n|\n|0.91\n|\n|\n|-\n|Little Barford\n|East England\n|RWE Generation UK\n|1995\n|\n|0.72\n|\n|\n|-\n|Marchwood\n|South East\n|Marchwood Power (50% MEAG, 50% SSE plc)\n|2009\n|\n|0.90\n|\n|\n|-\n|Medway\n|South East\n|SSE plc\n|1995\n|\n|0.76\n|\n|\n|-\n|Pembroke B\n|Wales\n|RWE Generation UK\n|2012\n|\n|2.20\n|\n|\n|-\n|Peterhead\n|Scotland\n|SSE plc\n|2000\n|\n|1.18\n|\n|\n|-\n|Rocksavage\n|North West\n|Intergen\n|1998\n|\n|0.81\n|\n|\n|-\n|Rye House\n|East England\n|Vitol\n|1993\n|\n|0.72\n|\n|\n|-\n|Saltend\n|Yorkshire and Humber\n|Triton Power (50% Equinor, 50% SSE plc)\n|2000\n|\n|1.20\n|Triton Power sold by Energy Capital Partners to Equinor and SSE in 2022\n|\n|-\n|Seabank\n|South West\n|Seabank Power (50% CK Infrastructure Holdings, 50% SSE plc)\n|2000\n|\n|1.23\n|\n|\n|-\n|Shoreham\n|South East\n|Vitol\n|2000\n|\n|0.42\n|\n|\n|-\n|South Humber Bank\n|Yorkshire and Humber\n|EPUKi\n|1997\n|\n|1.37\n|\n|\n|-\n|Spalding\n|East Midlands\n|Intergen\n|2004\n|\n|0.95\n|\n|\n|-\n|Staythorpe C\n|East Midlands\n|RWE Generation UK\n|2010\n|\n|1.77\n|Built on the site of two former CEGB coal-fired power stations, the 360&nbsp;MW Staythorpe A and B\n|\n|-\n|VPI Immingham\n|Yorkshire and Humber\n|Vitol\n|2004\n|\n|1.25\n|\n|\n|-\n|West Burton B\n|East Midlands\n|TotalEnergies\n|2013\n|\n|1.33\n|Sold by EIG Global Energy Partners to TotalEnergies in 2024\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of power stations in England\n* List of power stations in Northern Ireland\n* List of power stations in Scotland\n* List of power stations in Wales\n* List of high-voltage transmission links in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
