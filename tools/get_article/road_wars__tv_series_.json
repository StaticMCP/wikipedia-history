From Series 1 the show was narrated by actor Lee Boardman. The 2nd half of series 7 was narrated by actress Claire Goose.\nAs of 2023, the show has repeats  on Sky Showcase, Sky Replay, Sky Mix, Sky Witness and Sky Crime.\nFormat\nRoad Wars followed the work of police officers, documenting the changing tactics of criminals and the response of the UK police forces. For six seasons the show followed officers in the Thames Valley, but moved to Devon and Cornwall for the last series in 2009. The programme also features some police videos both in the UK and US.\nLee Boardman narrated the show until the second half of series 7, employing a light-hearted and pun-intended approach. At the opening narration Boardman says \"In Road Wars, the unexpected is always just around the corner\".\nThe title music was composed by Nainita Desai and Malcolm Laws. Other music was made by the series' co-creator Bill Rudgard. In series 1 the title card consisted of 'ROAD WARS' in red dot-matrix form. A new title card was made for series 3, which was slightly edited with yellow accents for series 6. The first two series had six episodes, series 3 and 4 had eight episodes each, and series 5 and 6 had 20 episodes each.\nFor series 7 as the show moved to another police force, a new title card and new music was composed. Boardman left his position as narrator and the last 8 episodes were narrated by Claire Goose.\nThames Valley Police\nFor series 1–6, the programme followed the fourteen members of the Thames Valley Police's roads policing proactive unit (Road Crime Unit) – known as \"Tango Victor\". They are also said to be known to fellow officers as \"Tango Vulture\", taken from their callsign prefix TV (Tango Victor) and the joke that they swoop to steal arrests from other officers while they carried out their duties.\nThe footage from this team is combined with video footage from police forces around the world (though largely UK and US forces).\nOfficers\nOfficers involved in Road Wars are listed below. As a specialist unit, officers tended to appear in a couple of series, or just for one series.\n{|\n|valign=top|\n;Series 1 originals\n* PC Tony Sams (series 1, 2 and 3)\n* PC Robb Webb (series 1, 2 and 3)\n* PC Jamie Gilson (Grant's pre-Derek partner making a cameo in series 1)\n* PC Pete Lomas (series 1 and 2)\n* PC Carl Lewis (series 1, 2 and 3)\n* PC Jim Lovell (series 1, 2 and 3)\n* PC Pat Knight (series 1, 2 and 3)\n* PC Mark Carrington (series 1, 2 and 3)\n* PC Grant Thomas(series 1 and a quick appearance in series 3, and in series 4 as a desk sergeant)\n* PC Dave Morgan (series 1, 2 and 3)\n* PC Derek Ingram(series 1, 2, 3 and in two episodes in series 6)\n* PC Andy Samuels(series 1, 2 and 3 – quick appearance in an ep in series 4)\n* PC Chris Piggott (series 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)\n* PC Conrad Lee(series 1, 2, 3 and series 6, although he appeared in series 4 as a bike cop)\n|width=30|\n|valign=top|\n;Series 4 originals\n* PC Mark Thornley (Series 4)\n* PC Ian Hewitson 'Hewi' (Series 4)\n* PC Martin York 'Yorkie' (an ep in series 3, series 4 and 5)\n* PC Chris Ruff 'Ruffy' (series 4 and 5)\n* PC Simon Hills (series 4, 5 and 6)\n* PC James Dixon 'Dixie' (series 4, 5 and 6) (deceased - due to a motorcycle collision on 5 December 2017)\n* PC Charlie Etheridge (series 4, 5 and 6)\n* PC Ronnie Welsh (series 4 and 5)\n* PC Jim Mahoney (series 4 and 5)\n* PC Iestyn Llewellyn – with Boris the dog (series 4 and 5)\n* PC Rosie Vosser(series 4, 5, and a cameo in series 6)\n* PC Roma Bolsover(series 4, 5 and 6 although appeared in the early series in the background)\n* PC Pete Lloyd (series 4, 5 and 6)\n* PC Darren Staley 'Daz' (series 4, 5 and 6)\n* PC Chris Waller(Quick appearance in series 4, regular in series 6)\n* PC Helen Lacey – with Bonnie the dog (Series 5 and 6)\n|width=30|\n|valign=top|\n;Series 6 originals\n* PC Dan Ruffle\n* PC Kevin Murphy\n* PC Michelle Ryan 'Mish'\n* PC Andy Burden 'Flipper'\n* PC Jason Evans\n* PC Wayne Mills 'Millsy'\n* PC Anna McShane\n* PC Tony Griffiths 'Griff'\n* PC Tom French 'Frenchy'\n* PC Dave Black\n* PC Tristan Newsome – with Bella the dog\n* PC Brian Avery – with Jake the dog\n* PC Barry Logan – with Matt the dog\n|}\nRegular teams\n{|\n|valign=top|\n* Pete and Tony (Series 1)\n* Derek and Grant (Series 1)\n* Tony and Robb (Series 1)\n* Conrad and Dave (Series 1–3)\n* Rob and Abbo (Series 1–3)\n* Pat and Carl (Series 1–3)\n* Chris and Andy (Series 1–3)\n* Tony and Derek (series 2–3)\n* Simon and Chris (series 4–5)\n* Mark and Hewi (Series 4)\n* Yorkie and Dixie (Series 4–5)\n* Daz and Rosie (Series 4–5)\n* Ruffy and Charlie (Series 4–5)\n|width=30|\n|valign=top|\n* Matt and Dan (Series 4–5)\n* Ronnie and Roma (Series 4–5)\n* Frenchy and Roma (Series 6)\n* Lloydy and Millsy (Series 6)\n* Anna and Dave (Series 6)\n* Charlie and Mish (Series 6)\n* Kev and Dixie (Series 6)\n* Waller and Flipper (Series 6)\n* Griff and Anna (Series 6)\n* Simon and Conrad (Series 6)\n|}\nVehicles\nThe Thames Valley Police unit operates high-specification, unmarked 3.2L V6 Vauxhall Omegas (B2 model), replaced in later series by unmarked 2.8L Turbo V6 Police Special Vauxhall Vectras. The unit is tasked with taking a proactive role in fighting crime especially targeted towards street robbers and burglars, but also undertaking general traffic policing (the officers are drawn from normal Roads Policing teams).\nDevon & Cornwall Police\nIn October 2008 Thames Valley Police pulled out from the show after concerns on how its officers are depicted. From Series 7, the show moved on to follow the Road Crime Unit and the front line Dog Squad of Devon and Cornwall Police. The Road Crime Unit operates marked BMW 3 Series along with unmarked 2.5L Ford Focus STs.\nTransmissions\nThere have been eight series of Road Wars. Four special episodes have been shown including two American episodes (known as Road Wars USA), which aired in 2005, where British police from the series travel to the U.S. to see the difference in police and criminal behaviour and two Christmas specials shown in 2003 and 2004. Three compilation editions entitled \"Ultimate Road Wars\", featuring action from the first six series, first aired on Sky1 on 11 November, 13 November and 1 December 2008.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
