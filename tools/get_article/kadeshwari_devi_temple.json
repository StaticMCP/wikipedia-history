The temple is dedicated to mother goddess Kadeshwari situated on the top of hill behind Bandra Fort in Land's End, Bandstand, Mumbai.\nThe idol of Kadeshwari is in the form of Shakti. It is approximately 2 kilometers from Bandra railway station.\nDue to the sea water constantly eroding the foundation of the temple and of the peripheral walls of the Bandra Fort, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had plans to construct a bund in 2006.\nReferences"
