The team competes in the biennial European Baseball Championship, and debuted in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\nThe team will compete in the 2026 World Baseball Classic in March 2026.\nHistory\nCzech clubs began playing against teams of United States Army servicemen in the immediate aftermath of World War II, but the development of the sport was halted after the fall of the Iron Curtain and would not resume until Bill Arce's baseball clinics in Prague, starting in 1969. It would not be until the 1980s that an official national team (for what was then Czechoslovakia) was formed; the team took three out of four games from the Soviet national team in Tbilisi, Georgia in October 1987.\nThe country became a full member of the Confederation of European Baseball in 1989, around the time of the Velvet Revolution. At the point of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the national team was almost entirely composed of Czech players. The Czech national team first qualified for the European Baseball Championship in 1997, with a record of 4–4. The team narrowly missed out on qualifying for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, falling short of Italy and the Netherlands.\nIn 2009, Europe hosted the IBAF World Cup, the first time in history the Baseball World Cup was not hosted by a specific country. Prague hosted Group A of the pool round, and the Czech Republic team finished 20th, going 0–3 with losses to Australia, Mexico, and Chinese Taipei.\nBecause the Czech Republic finished in the top five in the 2019 European Baseball Championship, it moved on to the 2020 Olympics qualifiers in Italy in September 2019.[http://www.jewishbaseballnews.com/retired-shmired/ Retired, shmired | Jewish Baseball News][http://www.jewishbaseballnews.com/mlb-monday-august-26-september-1-2019/ MLB Monday (August 26-September 1, 2019) | Jewish Baseball News] There, it came in third, behind Israel and the Netherlands.\nRoster\n| Catchers=\n| Infielders=\n| Outfielders=\n| Manager=\n| Coaches=\n| BC1=#11457e\n| BC2=#d7141a\n| FC1=#FFFFFF\n| FC2=#FFFFFF\n| Date=\n| MLBAffiliation=Major League
