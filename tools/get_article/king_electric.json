The first single, \"Summerbreeze\", was reviewed in the music press in the UK, Germany, and Japan, described by one reviewer as the \"charming 1970s MFSB Phillysound\". The single reached #1 in the Belgium Radio Charts and was followed by further releases on the band's own label, Top10 Records.\nIn 2009, they released \"Da King\", their first single under the name King Electric. A video clip for the track featuring two clowns was presented as part of the Diagonale Festival of Austrian Film in 2010.\nBy the end of 2012, the duo had released their debut album King Electric and two further singles: \"Commit Yourself\" and \"Out of Reach\". In December 2013, they released the first part of the album Remixes Remixology Vol. 1.\nIsepp announced that the new King Electric album, Pluto, would be released in Spring 2021, as well as two singles: \"Satellite of Hate\", a Depeche Mode cover, and \"Oh So Quiet\", based on Greta Thunberg's address to the United Nations assembly.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n* 2012: King Electric\n* 2013: Remixology Vol 1\n* 2021: Pluto\nSingles\n* 2003: Summerbreeze (as Sultans of Swing)\n* 2004: (Make) A Little Love (as Sultans of Swing)\n* 2005: The Way You Feel Inside (as Sultans of Swing)\n* 2009: Da King\n* 2011: Commit Yourself\n* 2012: Out Of Reach\n* 2021: Satellite Of Hate\nSee also\n* List of Austrians in music\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.king-electric.org Official website]\n*[http://www.discogs.com/artist/King+Electric King Electric at Discogs]"
