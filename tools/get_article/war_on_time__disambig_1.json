It was recorded in 2007 at Malt and Mangrove studios with David Nicholas and Mark Needham.\nKill Your Stereo said \"It is an album you really have to spin a few times to learn the dips, riffs and lyrics to really enjoy and pick up on all the little things that you may not have in the beginning. In terms of technicality there is nothing strictly bad about this album although I can see where others have developed the notion that it is rather bland and heavy on the pop and commercial sensibilities.\" Concluding with \"This punchy pop record is only the beginning and a warm up for their amazing live shows.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Let You Go\" – 2:51\n# \"Soft November\" – 3:47\n# \"Seven Years\" – 3:14\n# \"When the End Comes\" – 4:03\n# \"Piano Song\" – 4:47\n# \"Yeah...
