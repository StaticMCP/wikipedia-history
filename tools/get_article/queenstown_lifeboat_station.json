Two RNLI Silver Medals were awarded.\nA third RNLI Silver Medal would be awarded in 1866, when 6 men in the coastguard galley saved the 13 crew of the Italian barque Lidia, when she was wrecked in a gale at Roberts Cove.\nA donation of £1878-1s-11d was reported at the meeting of the RNLI committee of management on 8 April 1866, to be known as the Quiver Lifeboat Fund, contributed by the subscribers to The Quiver magazine, via the publishers Cassell, Petter and Galpin, and the editor, the Rev. Thomas Teignmouth Shore. The donation initially funded three lifeboats, Quiver No.1 for Queenstown, Quiver No.2 for , and Quiver No.3 for . It would transpire that No.1 was actually placed at Margate, No.2 at Southwold, and No.3 went to Queenstown.\nA meeting on 3 May 1866 acknowledged the letter and grant by the Secretary of State for War, of the site for a lifeboat house at Queenstown, the building later reported as costing £218-7s-4d.\nIn view of the number of Trans-atlantic vessels using the port, and with several wrecks with loss of life having occurred in the vicinity of Cork Harbour, \"it was thought desirable to form a life-boat establishment at Queenstown in the harbour, where at all times and in all weathers the boat could be launched and manned by an efficient crew, and where steam-tugs would be always available to tow her to any part of the neighbouring coast where her services might be needed.\"\nA 34-foot self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with sails and (10) oars, was conveyed free of charge from the River Thames to Cork, by the Cork Steamship Company. On 22 October 1866, in front of \"an immense assemblage of spectators\", the lifeboat was named Quiver No.3 (ON 302), and then launched on demonstration.\nAn additional lifeboat was placed at Queenstown in 1890. The 'Queenstown No.2', at 42-feet-long, was at the time, one of the largest self-righting P&S lifeboats constructed, and would be moored afloat at the station. The boat was funded from the bequest of the late Miss Ann Ball of London, and in accordance with her wishes, named Endeavour (ON 272). Both boats would serve at Queenstown until 1899, when Quiver No. 3, at 33-years-old, was retired.\nEndeavour was only on station at Queenstown for a further 2 years, before she too was retired, at only 11-years-old. She was replaced by the James Stevens No. 20, a 43-foot Watson (P&S) lifeboat, the last of 20 lifeboats funded by a legacy of £50,000 of the late Mr James Stevens, a property developer from Birmingham. This donation provided more lifeboats than any other single donation ever received by the RNLI.\nAt 14:10 on the fine calm day of 7 May 1915, the ocean liner RMS Lusitania was torpedoed off the Old Head of Kinsale by German submarine U-20. She sank in just 18 minutes, with the loss of 1197 passengers and crew. The mayday call was received by Queenstown Coastguard at 14:15, and all available vessels were dispatched. The Queenstown lifeboat James Stevens No. 20 was towed to the scene by a tugboat, and was instrumental in picking up survivors, and transferring passengers from ship's lifeboats to larger vessels.\nAt a meeting of the RNLI committee of management on Friday 9 January 1920, it was decided to close the  and Queenstown Life-boat Stations.\nThe lifeboat station still remains, much modernised, and is now the Cobh Sea Scouts headquarters. The lifeboat on station at the time of closure, James Stevens No. 20 (ON 457), would later serve at  in 1923. She was sold from service in 1928, and was last reported as a yacht Eternal Wave in Dartmouth, Devon in the 1970s.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Queenstown.\n*RNLI Silver Medal\n::Lt.
