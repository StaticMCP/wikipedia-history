This arc explores the aftermath of StarClan's reformation in The Broken Code, focusing on growing tensions between the Clans as their ancestral spirits cease providing guidance. The story follows multiple protagonists including Sunbeam (ShadowClan), Frostpaw (RiverClan), and Nightheart (ThunderClan) as they navigate political unrest, forbidden relationships, and a mysterious sickness affecting medicine cats. The arc is notable for being the first to title books after Clan names rather than prophecies, reflecting its focus on inter-Clan conflict.\nDevelopment\nFollowing the spiritual upheaval in The Broken Code, author Kate Cary stated in a 2022 blog post that the team wanted to explore \"how the Clans function without StarClan's direct intervention.\" Editor Victoria Holmes described the arc as \"a return to ground-level Clan politics\" reminiscent of early series arcs, but with more sophisticated character dynamics.\nThe decision to name books after Clans came from fan feedback requesting clearer faction perspectives. Each novel alternates between three main POV characters:\nSunbeam: A ShadowClan warrior caught between loyalty and love\nFrostpaw: A RiverClan medicine cat apprentice experiencing visions\nNightheart: A ThunderClan rebel challenging Clan traditions\nNew illustrator Owen Richardson introduced a distinctive visual style for covers, using:\nMonochromatic color schemes (e.g., River features blue tones)\nClan symbols hidden in negative space\nBroken star imagery reflecting the arc's title\nPublication history\nRiver\nReleased on 5 April 2022, this novel debuted at #3 on the New York Times Young Adult Bestseller list.
