Incumbent Eduard Kokoity was seeking a second full five-year term. He was re-elected with more than 98% of the vote. According to the de facto authorities, the election was monitored by a team of 34 international observers from Germany, Austria, Poland, Sweden and other countries at 78 polling stations. The election process was criticised by local civic society and the results were deemed likely to be inflated.\nResults\nAlternative elections and referendum\nSouth Ossetian opposition politicians, some of whom had left Tskhinvali due to a conflict with the de facto president Eduard Kokoity, set up an alternative Central Election Commission and nominated their candidates for presidency: Gogi Chigoyev, Teimuraz Djeragoyev, Tamar Charayeva, and Dmitry Sanakoyev, who served as defense minister and then as prime minister for several months in 2001 under Kokoity's predecessor, Ludwig Chibirov. Voters were also to answer a question: \"do you agree with the renewal of talks with Georgia on a federal union.\" The alternative elections and referendum were held in the villages with mixed Georgian-Ossetian population not controlled by the secessionist government. The Salvation Union of South Ossetia which organised the election turned down a request from a Georgian NGO, “Multinational Georgia”, to monitor it and the released results were also very likely to be inflated.\nReferences\n* [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/11/DA873FC6-19F4-4A62-A156-A23EC91A2BC5.html Georgia: South Ossetia Seeks To Contain Opposition Challenge], Radio Free Europe, 2006-11-10\n*[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14030 Staging ‘Alternative Choice’ for S.Ossetia], Online Magazine - Civil Georgia, November 7, 2006.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190030/http://www.kommersant.com/p720847/South_Ossetia_Elections/ South Ossetia to Elect Two Presidents], Kommersant, November 11, 2006.\n*[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/11/DA873FC6-19F4-4A62-A156-A23EC91A2BC5.html Georgia: South Ossetia Seeks To Contain Opposition Challenge], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, November 10, 2006."
