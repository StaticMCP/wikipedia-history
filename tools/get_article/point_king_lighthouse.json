Construction commenced shortly afterward and the prefabricated lights arrived in June; the project was completed later in the year and the lighthouse commenced operating on New Years Day in 1858 with William Hill employed as the light keeper.\nThe original lighthouse consisted of the keeper's house situated  above the high water mark on the granite point. The building had a  high square wooden tower equipped with an oil-fired light visible from  away. The light was operated manually and the keeper lived in the dwelling where the tower was housed.\nThe lighthouse was made redundant in June 1911. The building remained unused for many years with the roof and tower lost many years ago. In 1995 a conservation plan was prepared but by 1999 no work had been carried out.\nIn 2011 the Albany City Council set aside 20,000 to stabilize the ruins.\nKeepers\n* Joseph Nelson 1857-1867\n* Samuel Mitchell 1867-1903\n* John Reddin 1903–1911\nSee also\n}}\n* List of lighthouses in Australia\n* List of places on the State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Albany\nGallery\nPointkingalbany.jpg|Lighthouse in 2008\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130121082940/https://ssl.panoramio.com/photo_explorer#view=photo&position=2971&with_photo_id=20416443&order=date_desc&user=2888642 Picture current Point King Lighthouse]"
