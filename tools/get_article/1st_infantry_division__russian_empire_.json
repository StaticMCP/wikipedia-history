From at least 1903 to the end of its existence the division was based in Smolensk.\nHistory\nIt was initially formed in 1811 as the 25th Infantry Division, and renumbered as the 1st in 1820. The division took part in the Russo-Japanese War and was located in Manchuria during that time. In August 1914 it was part of the 2nd Army of the Northwestern Front. It was completely destroyed during the Russian invasion of East Prussia by September of that year and was reformed in December 1914. In 1915–17 it was assigned to the 12th Army, 5th Army, and later the 1st Army. It was demobilized around the time of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent unrest.\nOrganization\nRussian infantry divisions consisted of a staff, two infantry brigades, and one artillery brigade. It was part of the 13th Army Corps as of 1914.\n*1st Brigade\n** 1st Neva Infantry Regiment\n** 2nd Sofia Infantry Regiment\n*2nd Brigade\n** 3rd Narva Infantry Regiment\n** 4th Koporye Infantry Regiment\n*1st Artillery Brigade\nKnown commanders\n{| class=wikitable\n!  || Name || From || To\n|-\n|1|| Lieutenant General Nikolai Bardovsky || 1883 || 1887\n|-\n|2|| Lieutenant General Mikhail Shulgin || 24.08.1892 || 9.01.1900\n|-\n|3|| Lieutenant General Vladimir Pensky || 1900 || 1904\n|-\n|4|| Lieutenant General Alexander Brilevich || 6.12.1904 || 26.10.1905\n|-\n|5|| General of Infantry Dmitry Zuyev || 21.06.1907 || 16.06.1910\n|-\n|6|| Lieutenant General Andrei Ugryumov || 2.07.1910 || after 1.03.1916\n|-\n|7|| Major General Luka Kondratovich || 5.03.1916 || after 3.01.1917\n|-\n|8|| Major General Silvestras Žukauskas || 18.05.1917 || ?\n|}\nKnown chiefs of staff\n{| class=wikitable\n!  || Name || From || To\n|-\n|1|| Colonel Mikhail Markov || 17.01.1878 || 27.05.1879\n|-\n|2|| Colonel Mikhail Ivanov || 10.05.1892 || 4.02.1898\n|-\n|3|| Colonel Baron Alexander von Taube || 25.10.1901 || 4.10.1904\n|-\n|4|| Colonel Alexander Davydov || 2.08.1910 || 19.06.1912\n|-\n|5|| Colonel Ivan Kashcheyev || 1913 || 1.07.1914\n|}\nReferences"
