      "text": "# The War (The New Power Generation song)\n\n\"The War\" is a song by The New Power Generation, headed by Prince (his alias at that time being an unpronounceable symbol) from 1998.  The song was initially given away to customers who pre-ordered Prince's Crystal Ball album and experienced delivery troubles.  The song is not from any album.  It was also available as a music download on Prince's now-defunct website, the NPG Music Club. A promo CD single of The War was also available for purchase through 1-800-New-Funk and online.\nThe original 45 minute jam was edited down to 26 minutes. The song mostly uses distorted guitars and synthesizers. Prince encourages the audience to chant throughout \"The Evolution will be colorized\", which makes reference to Gil Scott-Heron's poem/song \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\".  The lyrics are sermon-like, warning against harmful technology and the forecoming of the Apocalypse.\nReferences\n* Uptown: The Vault – The Definitive Guide to the Musical World of Prince: Nilsen Publishing 2004,"
