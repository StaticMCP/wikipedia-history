The channel is being programmed by musician/producer/DJ/remixer Diplo and named after his 2013 song \"Revolution.\" The channel made its debut at 9pm (EDT) on March 22, 2018.\nStation history\nAs \"Area\"/\"Electric Area\"\nThe station was available on Sirius, and at first was called Area 63 due to the channel's position. Later, it was renamed Area 33, again due to the channel's then-new position. Area features some of the world's most renowned DJs such as Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Dash Berlin, Carl Cox, Erik Morillo, Paul Van Dyk, Benny Benassi, Armand Van Helden, Roger Sanchez, Ferry Corsten, Thomas Gold, Serge Devant, Deep Dish, Annie Mac, Sasha and John Digweed. On June 24, 2008, Area 33 was moved to channel 38 to make room for the move of SIRIUS Disorder (occupying the position is now The Bridge). On November 12, 2008, Area dropped its \"38\" position on the logo because of the Sirius-XM merger, and replaced The Move on the XM channel lineup.  Most recently, Mediabase delisted the S038-FM channel's playlist, along with co-owned Pop2K; Mediabase would read the station to its Dance panel in January 2014.\nOn September 12, 2010, the channel was renamed Electric Area to expand its exclusive dance music format.\nAs \"Diplo's Revolution\"\nOn March 22, 2018 Electric Area was replaced with \"Diplo's Revolution\". It was announced at the launch that the channel would feature \"global, hip-hop, experimental and underground dance culture\" aside from the current dance/electronica direction, as well as live sets and live festival broadcasts. The transition also resulted in sister channel BPM incorporating most of the content into its playlist.\nAs of 2020, Diplo’s Revolution has begun to follow a more Top 40-like approach similar to sister channel BPM, as reflected in its playlists as reported in Billboard’s Dance/Mix Show Airplay and Mediabase’s Dance charts.\nProgramming\n*All Love From NY with DJ Theo\n*Area with Jonathan Peters\n*Automatic Static with DJ Icey\n*The Benny Benassi Show\n*Call of The Wild with Monstercat\n*DJ Times Shortlist with Emily Tan\n*Evolution\n*Global DJ Broadcast with Markus Schulz\n*The Flavor The Vibe with StoneBridge\n*Feel Up Radio with Kream\n*Groove Radio International with Swedish Egil\n*Identity with Sander Van Doorn\n*Jefr Tale presents Club Tales\n*Jacked with Afrojack\n*The Juicy Show with Robbie Rivera\n*LostWorld with George Acosta\n*Made In Miami with Oscar G\n*The Mothership with Skrillex\n*Nocturnal with Matt Darey\n*Paul Van Dyk's Vonyc Sessions\n*Steve Porter's Porterhouse\n*Subterranean with Zoltar\n*The Cookout\n*Group Therapy Radio with Above & Beyond\n*Claude VonStroke presents The Birdhouse\n*Transitions with John Digweed\n*IsEveryoneOK with Phantoms\n*UMF Radio\n*Wonderland Radio with Alison Wonderland\n*Playground Radio with Louis the Child\n*A State Of Trance with Armin van Buuren, also airs on digital channel 736 (\"A State of Armin\").\n*Night Service Only Radio with CID\nFormer Programming\n*\n*Major Behavior with The Fat Jewish: Internet star Josh Ostrovsky hosted this weekly show where he interviewed celebrities, invited co-hosts, and played guest mixes.
