He featured in four Test matches for Australia, making his debut as a second-rower against Great Britain at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1928. His other Test appearances came during the 1929–30 tour of Great Britain, where he was Australia's top try-scoring forward across all tour fixtures. In 1935, Kingston competed in first-grade with the Western Suburbs Magpies, but left four rounds into the season to be playing-coach of Werris Creek.\nPersonal life\nKingston managed the Victoria Hotel in Nambucca Heads in his later life. He died at the age of 49 in 1957, having collapsing at the wheel of his car while driving his children to school. The children were unharmed as his wife was able to take control of the vehicle.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/jack-kingston/summary.html Jack Kingston] at Rugby League Project"
