For inclusion, an individual must have received either historiographical or contemporary coverage about their status as a last survivor of a notable event in world history. Literature about last survivors of historical events has also included the last surviving people associated with historical organizations or phenomena. Examples of individuals who may qualify for inclusion are:\n* Participants in or witnesses to political revolutions, civilian conflicts, massacres and assassinations\n* Survivors of notable accidents and disasters with mass casualties\n* Participants in geographical explorations and scientific breakthroughs\n* Participants in or witnesses to historically significant events in culture\n* Participants in notable legal proceedings such as trials or the signing of international treaties\n* Participants in the activities of defunct governmental, political, cultural or religious organizations\n* Participants in or subjects of historical practices, such as people with obsolete occupations or legal statuses\nLast surviving veterans of wars and military operations are recorded on separate pages and do not feature in this list. This list also does not include last speakers of languages or last surviving members of families (such as scions of royal families).\nMultiple people associated with a singular event are eligible for inclusion if they were members of different historically notable groups within that event (e.g. last defendant and last prosecutor in the Nuremberg Trials).\nBefore 1801\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 225px;\" | Death\n!Distinction\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date ended\n|-\n|Mary Allerton\n|28 November 1699 (aged 83)\n|Last passenger of the Mayflower}}\n|11 November 1620\n|-\n|Edmund Ludlow\n|c.1692 (aged ~75)\n|Last regicide of Charles I of England\n|30 January 1649\n|-\n|Thomas Aikenhead\n|\n|Last Briton executed for blasphemy\n|8 January 1697\n|-\n|George Robert Twelves Hewes\n|\n|Last participant of the Boston Tea party\n|16 December 1773\n|-\n|Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet\n|\n|Last surviving royal governor of any of the British Thirteen Colonies (New Hampshire)\n|13 June 1775\n|-\n|Charles Carroll\n|\n|Last signer of the United States Declaration of Independence\n|4 July 1776\n|-\n|John Hatley\n|12 December 1832 (aged 70)\n|Last participant of James Cook's voyages (second voyage)\n|4 October 1780\n|-\n|James Madison\n|\n|Last founding father of the United States and signer of The United States Constitution\n|17 September 1787\n|-\n|Elizabeth Thackery\n|\n|Last known survivor of the First Fleet\n|20 January 1788\n|-\n|John Armstrong Jr.\n|\n|Last delegate to the Continental Congress\n|2 March 1789\n|-\n|John Adams\n|\n|Last mutineer of HMS Bounty\n|28 April 1789\n|-\n|Arthur Dardenne\n|\n|Last participant of the Storming of the Bastille\n|14 July 1789\n|-\n|Paine Wingate\n|\n|Last member of the first United States Congress\n|3 March 1791\n|-\n|Antoine Claire Thibaudeau\n|\n|Last member of the National Convention during the French Revolution to vote in the trial of Louis XVI\n|15 January 1793\n|-\n|Margaret Ann Neve\n|\n|Last verified person to live in the 18th century\n|30 December 1800\n|}\n1801–1850\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 225px;\" | Death\n!Distinction\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date ended\n|-\n|Patrick Gass\n|\n|Last member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition\n|23 September 1806\n|-\n|Nicolas François, Count Mollien\n|\n|Last surviving minister of the First French Empire\n|7 July 1815\n|-\n|Seth Weeks\n|\n|Last survivor of the sinking of the whaleship Essex\n|20 November 1820\n|-\n|Dmitry Zavalishin\n|\n|Last participant in the Decembrist revolt\n|14 December 1825\n|-\n|David Whitmer\n|\n|Last of the Three Witnesses\n|28 June 1829\n|-\n|Alijo Perez Jr.\n|19 October 1918 (aged 83)\n|Last known civilian survivor of the Battle of the Alamo\n|6 March 1836\n|-\n|Thomas Patrickson\n|\n|Last participant of the Second voyage of HMS Beagle\n|2 October 1836\n|-\n|Rebecca Tickaneesky Neugin\n|\n|Last Cherokee survivor of the Trail of Tears\n|1839\n|-\n|Joseph Dalton Hooker\n|\n|Last participant of the Ross expedition\n|4 September 1843\n|-\n|Margaret Isabella Breen McMahon\n|\n|Last survivor of the Donner Party\n|29 April 1847\n|-\n|James Stephens Brown\n|\n|Last witness to the discovery of Gold at Sutter's Mill\n|28 January 1848\n|-\n|Charlotte L.
