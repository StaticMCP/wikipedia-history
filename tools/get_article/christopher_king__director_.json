He wrote, directed and produced both documentaries alongside his wife and creative partner Maia Lekow. He also served as a cinematographer and editor on both projects.\nLife and career\nKing was born in Australia and studied at The School of Creative Arts at the University of Melbourne. In 2007, he relocated to Kenya and continued his work as a cinematographer, editor, animator, director, and producer.  In 2009, he co-founded Circle & Square Productions with his wife, Maia Lekow. In the same year, he won Best Achievement in Editing at the 5th Africa Movie Academy Awards for feature film From a Whisper.\nKing’s directorial debut documentary feature, titled The Letter, explored the lingering impact of British colonial rule in Kenya. The film was supported by the IDFA Bertha Fund, Hot Docs Blue Ice Group, and the Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program. It had its world premiere at IDFA, followed by its German premiere at DOK.fest München. It also screened at AFI Docs, Melbourne International Film Festival, Durban International Film Festival among others.\nKing followed his debut with How to Build a Library, a documentary film based on two Kenyan women’s mission to restore a public library in the country’s capital, Nairobi. The idea for the documentary was born when he and Lekow were approached to create social media videos for a launch, but realized the story felt bigger. He worked on the project as a director, writer, producer, cinematographer, editor and sound recordist between 2017 to 2025. The film had its world premiere at Sundance Film Festival and competed in the World Cinema Competition.\nHis next film is set in a highly Islamic, patriarchal community where a woman is running for government.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
