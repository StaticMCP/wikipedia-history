Each season, one poll evaluates the various National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) football teams and ranks them. Coaches from each of the football conferences are members of a selection panel, with conferences receiving one vote for every four member teams. Sometimes referred to as the football ratings or the '''NAIA Coaches' Poll''', the poll is generally conducted once during the preseason and after each week of play during the regular season.\nThe Top 25 was determined by compiling points for each vote. A team received 25 points for each first-place vote, 24 for second-place and so on through the list. The highest and lowest ranking for each team (counting zero for ballots with no votes for a team) were disregarded. To obtain the final tally, each team's ranking was recalculated with an additional point added to each team for every ballot (including discounted ballots) that includes the team.\nAs an example, if there were 17 voting panelists, and one team is a unanimous choice for the highest ranking, then that team would receive 25 points * 15 ballots (disregard 2 ballots) + 17 points (one for each ballot cast) = 392 points.\nTeams that received only one point in the ballot were not considered \"receiving votes.\"\nOnce the regular season was completed, the NAIA conducted a playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll was taken after completion of the series of playoff games, collectively referred to as the 2019 NAIA Football National Championship.\nPoll release dates\nThe NAIA released a preseason edition of the rankings on August 5, 2019. A complete schedule of poll release dates will be:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" \"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|2019 poll release

National Championship. Teams were selected to the field of participants through a two-tiered selection process.\nFirst, any conference champion ranked in the top 20 positions in the final regular-season Coaches' Poll received an automatic bid into the tourney field.\nAfter the automatic bids were granted, any open positions in the field were filled with at-large invitations. These at-large entries were granted to the highest ranked teams who were not conference champions.\nIn 2019, there were 12 NAIA conferences (or divisions within large conferences) who had champions that were part of the selection process for the automatic invitations. The 12 eligible conferences for the 2019 season were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Conference\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Division\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Frontier Conference                   ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Great Plains Athletic Conference      ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Heart of America Athletic Conference  || North\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Heart of America Athletic Conference  || South\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-South Conference                  || Appalachian\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-South Conference                  || Bluegrass\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-South Conference                  || Sun\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-States Football Association       || Mideast\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-States Football Association       || Midwest\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| North Star Athletic Association       ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Sooner Athletic Conference            ||\n|}\nSince all 12 conference champions finished in the top 20 positions in the final poll, they each received an automatic place in the tournament. Therefore, a total of four at-large invitations were granted to play in the 2019 tournament. Based on the Week 10 (final regular season) Coaches' Poll, the following teams (12 champions and four at-large teams) made up the 2019 playoff field:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Rank\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Conference/division\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Invitation type\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1 || Morningside (IA) || Great Plains || Automatic - 1\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 2 || Marian (IN) || Mid-States / Mideast || Automatic - 2\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 3 || Kansas Wesleyan || Kansas Collegiate || Automatic - 3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 4 || Grand View (IA) || Heart of America / North || Automatic - 4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 5 || College of Idaho || Frontier || Automatic - 5\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 6 || Lindsey Wilson (KY)|| Mid-South / Bluegrass || Automatic - 6\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 7 || Keiser (FL) || Mid-South / Sun || Automatic - 7\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 8 || Northwestern (IA) || Great Plains || At-large - 1\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 9 || Saint Xavier (IL) || Mid-States / Midwest || Automatic - 8\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 10 || Cumberlands (KY) || Mid-South / Bluegrass || At-large - 2\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 11 || Saint Francis (IN) || Mid-States / Mideast || At-large - 3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 12 || Concordia (MI) || Mid-States / Mideast || At-large - 4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 13 || Reinhardt (GA) || Mid-South / Appalachian || Automatic - 9\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 14 || Southeastern (FL) || Mid-South / Sun ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 15 || Baker (KS) || Heart of America / South || Automatic - 10\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 16 || Ottawa (AZ) || Sooner || Automatic - 11\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 17 || Dickinson State (ND) || North Star || Automatic - 12\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 18 || Benedictine (KS) || Heart of America / South ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 19 || Langston (OK) || Sooner ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 20 || Siena Heights (MI) || Mid-States / Mideast ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 21 || Evangel (MO) || Heart of America / South ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 22 || Montana Western || Frontier ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 23 || Waldorf (IA) || North Star ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 24 || Bethel (KS) || Kansas Collegiate ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 25 || Carroll (MT) || Frontier ||\n|}\nAfter the tournament participants were determined, the top eight seeds were granted first round home games. Opponents were generally determined based on the oft-used tournament protocol that pairs highest seeds with lowest seeds: #1 vs. the lowest seeded entry (usually #16), #2 vs. the second-lowest seeded entry (usually #15), #3 vs. the third-lowest seeded entry (usually #14), etc. This alignment was then tweaked, for geographic and travel considerations, by the tournament selection officials to determine the announced first-round pairings.\nThe first round tournament match-ups, finalized and announced on Sunday, November 17\n, were:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Rank\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Visitor\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Rank\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Home\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #17 || Dickinson State (ND) || at || #1 || Morningside (IA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #13 || Reinhardt (GA) || at || #2 || Marian (IN)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #15 || Baker (KS) || at || #3 || Kansas Wesleyan\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #12 || Concordia (MI) || at || #4 || Grand View (IA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #16 || Ottawa (AZ) || at || #5 || College of Idaho\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #11 || Saint Francis (IN) || at ||#6 || Lindsey Wilson (KY)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #10 || Cumberlands (KY) || at || #7 || Keiser (FL)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #9 || Saint Xavier (IL) || at || #8 || Northwestern (IA)\n|}\nLeading vote-getters\nSince the inception of the Coaches' Poll in 1999, the #1 ranking in the various weekly polls has been held by only a select group of teams. Through the final poll of the 2019 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nThere has been only one tie for the leading vote-getter in a weekly poll. In 2015, Southern Oregon was tied with Marian (IN) in the preseason poll.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||57 (6)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||55 (3)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Morningside (IA)||40 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||25 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||24 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Saint Francis (IN)||21 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||14 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||5 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||4 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||2\n|}\nReferences"
