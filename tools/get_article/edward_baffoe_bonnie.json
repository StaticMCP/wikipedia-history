He lost the seat in 2004 with the reconfiguration of the constituency. During his term, on 12 August 2003, he said that the government's decision to adopt the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative was a prudent one that should be lauded by all Ghanaians rather than condemned; he stated that if Ghana had not joined the HIPC, the country would have faced worse economic hardships than \"what we are experiencing presently.\" Flanked by Mr James Adusei-Sarkodie and Dr Edward Baffoe-Bonnie, Nana Asante Frempong, Former MP for Kwabre and Ashanti Regional Chairman of the Asante commended Nana Akufo-Addo for his efforts to re-mobilize members of Party who had served the Party but felt neglected due to the exigencies and certain circumstances.
