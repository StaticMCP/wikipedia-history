The primary was won by incumbent Vice President Al Gore, who swept all three of Delaware's counties, over former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.\nBackground\nCandidates\n*Bill Bradley, former Senator from New Jersey\n*Al Gore, incumbent Vice President of the United States from Tennessee\nCampaign\nDue to its minor status in the primaries and the fact that it and Washington came in between the New Hampshire and California primaries, both major candidates only spent a small amount of time in both states.\nResults\nGore won all of Delaware's 3 counties but would not receive its 22 delegates due to the states \"Advisory Primary\" system. (Gore would get fifteen with seven remaining unallocated) until the caucus that happened after Bill Bradley ended his campaign.\nAftermath\nBill Bradley lost the rest of the primaries by large margins and Al Gore would eventually lose the general election to Governor of Texas George W. Bush.\nReferences\n2000\nDelaware\nDemocratic primary"
