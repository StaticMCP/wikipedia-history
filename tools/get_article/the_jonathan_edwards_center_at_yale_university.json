Besides its primary location at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, the center maintains affiliated centers in Australia, Benelux, Brazil, Poland, Germany, and South Africa to assist in providing information about the works of Jonathan Edwards.  Edwards was a prolific writer and the center has published  twenty-six volumes (letter press) and seventy-three volumes (digital edition, online archive) of his works.  The center also makes Edwards' works available on the web through an online archive.\nSee also\n*Jonathan Edwards\n*Yale Divinity School\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://edwards.yale.edu/ Edwards Center Official Website]"
