They started a blog highlighting how students were contributing to civic tech, which grew to 800 members within two months. Two of the students took a course with the former Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States Nick Sinai where they had the opportunity to work on tech projects in government. That experience led to the idea of organizing tech-focused student internships in government.\nCivic Digital Fellowship\nThe primary program of Coding it Forward is their Civic Digital Fellowship, a competitive 10-week data science and technology internship program for undergraduate and graduate students in United States federal agencies. They have received more than 1,100 applications from students from more than 175 colleges and universities for 50 fellowship positions. Among six federal agencies, the 50 students learn by working on group projects to improve their departments and how they work. The fellows receive a paycheck, which is unlike many other internship programs in the government.\nGrowth\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Fellows !! Applications !! Agencies !!
