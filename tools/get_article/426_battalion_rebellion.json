These former Hizbullah members sympathized with the Darul Islam movement. They helped the DI/TII movement by supplying weapons when they were stationed in Demak and involved in the operation to eradicate the disruptive troops at the Merapi Merbabu Complex. Hurt by being merged into the Pragolo Brigade and receiving discriminatory treatment because of the Hizbullah origins, 426 Battalion decided to rebel with the support of DI/TII.\nHearing of 426 Battalion's support for the Darul Islam movement, Major Munawar and Captain Sofyan received orders to go to the Diponegoro Division headquarters for an inspection on December 7, 1951. Only Major Munawar came to the headquarters while Captain Sofyan refused. Captain Sofyan admitted that three of his companies had joined Darul Islam.\nRebellion\nDecember 1951\nThe rebellion erupted on December 8, 1951, marked by fighting between former 426 Battalion troops and the Indonesian soldiers in Kudus in response to Captain Sofyan's refusal to surrender. The fighting lasted until the afternoon due to the heavy rain. Taking advantage of this condition, the former 426 Battalion troops secretly fled from Kudus. One company fled to Mount Muria while the other two headed southeast of Kudus towards their base area, Surakarta. In response to the rebellion, the government arrested 75 people who were suspected of having close ties to the rebels.\nMeanwhile, two companies of 426 Battalion led by Captain Alif who were undergoing training in Magelang escaped from the Dodik dormitory to the south in the early hours of December 10 by disguising as ordinary residents. Then, each company was assigned to go to a different place. One company led by Muhyiddin fled to the south while the company led by Captain Alif went north. While fleeing, Muhyiddin's troops attacked the Muntilan police station and freed 11 prisoners who were then armed. As a result of this incident, access to Magelang was closed, causing the city to become deserted and a curfew was implemented. On the other hand, Major Munawar, who was wearing thug-like clothes, was captured in Klaten on December 10, 1951.\nTroops from the former 426 Battalion led by Captain Alif arrived in Klaten on December 15, 1951, after passing through various areas. Upon arrival in Klaten, they built defensive ditches in ,, and . From 16 to 20 December 1951, troops from former 426 Battalion attacked  and . The fighting lasted for four days and one of the police officers, Sudomo, died.

While stopping in Wonogiri, Sofyan succeeded in recruiting local youth by naming his troops the Tax Liberation Army. Captain Sofyan's troops arrived in Klaten four weeks after the outbreak of the rebellion.\nTo quell the rebellion of ex-426 Battalion troops, the Diponegoro Division launched Operation Sapta Marga Merdeka Timur V led by Mochammad Bachrun on 19 December 1951. Yon 421, Yon 422, Yon 424, Yon 425, Yon 408, Yon 417, Yon 413, Yon 414 and Yon 446 were included in this military operation.

They experienced logistical problems because the local population was reluctant to assist the rebel forces. As a result, they chose to rob to survive.
