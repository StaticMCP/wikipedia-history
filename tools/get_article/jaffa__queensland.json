The highest point in the locality is Basils Peak ().\nThe north and east of the locality are flatter land at around  above sea level and the land use is predominantly growing sugarcane.\nThe North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south-east (El Arish) and travels north forming the north-eastern boundary of the locality before exiting to the north-east (Silkwood). The locality was served by the now-abandoned Jaffa railway station ().\nThere is a cane tramway network through the north and east of the locality which transports the harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mill for processing.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the former Jaffa railway station, named on 24 March 1921 by the Queensland Railways Department after the Middle East city known to Australian troops from World War I, presumably reflecting the presence of a local soldier settlement.\nDemographics\nIn the , Jaffa had a population of 18 people.\nIn the , Jaffa had a population of 35 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Jaffa.
