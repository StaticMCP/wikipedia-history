The G9, along with other affiliated armed groups, controls over 80% of the capital Port-au-Prince.\nIn March 2024, the group was involved in a jailbreak that led to more than 4,700 prisoners escaping, resulting in the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry.\nHistory\nThe G9 Family was founded by Chérizier in June 2020, with his own armed group, the Delmas 95, being one of the founding members. The G9 originally had only nine armed groups as members, but it soon expanded to 12.\nThe G9 had a rivalry with the G-Pèp, an armed group supportive of the Haitian Government. In 2022, clashes between it and G-Pèp led to \"at least 50 dead and more than 50 wounded\" in just 4 days in Port-au-Prince.\nOn February 29 2024, the G9 family set aside its rivalry with the G-Pèp and formed a coalition: Viv Ansanm.\nActivities\nThe G9 had a relationship with assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, having received weapons, police uniforms, and other support even after Chérizier's dismissal from the police force. The G9 also has a rivalry with fellow Haitian gang G-Pèp, having fought with them. The gang is well-armed and capable of using unmanned aerial vehicles. They have access to a variety of illegal weapons, mostly from the United States, giving them more firepower than the police.\nReferences"
