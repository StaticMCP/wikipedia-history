Since most children's authors published with international publishers, there were few acceptable submissions in the early years. In 1977, it was decided to broaden the criteria to include books written by South Africans, or from a South African perspective.\nIn 1980, SALA became the South African Institute of Librarianship and Information Science (SAILIS), and its Committee for Children's Books became responsible for the awards until its disbandment in 1998. Since then, the awards have become the responsibility of the English Academy of South Africa.\nIn 2014 Kagiso Lesego Molope became the first Black author to win the award.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
