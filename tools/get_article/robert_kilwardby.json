Kilwardby was the first member of a mendicant order to attain a high ecclesiastical office in the English Church.\nLife\nKilwardby studied at the University of Paris, then was a teacher of grammar and logic there. He then joined the Dominican Order and studied theology, and became regent at Oxford University before 1261, probably by 1245. He was named provincial prior of the Dominicans for England in 1261, and in October 1272 Pope Gregory X appointed him as Archbishop of Canterbury to end a dispute over the election. Kilwardby was provided to the archbishopric on 11 October 1272, given the temporalities on 12 December 1272, and consecrated on 26 February 1273.\nKilwardby crowned Edward I and his wife Eleanor as king and queen of England in August 1274, but otherwise took little part in politics. He instead concentrated on his ecclesiastical duties, including charity to the poor and donating to the Dominicans.\nIn 1278 Pope Nicholas III named Kilwardby Cardinal Bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina. He then resigned Canterbury and left England, taking with him papers, registers and documents belonging to the see. He also left the see deep in debt again, after his predecessor had cleared the debt. While in theory this was a promotion, probably it was not, as the pope was unhappy with Kilwardby's support of efforts to resist the payment of papal revenues and with the lack of effort towards the reforms demanded at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274.\nHe died in Italy in 1279, and was buried in the Dominican convent in Viterbo.\nReputation\nKilwardby's theological and philosophical views were summed up by David Knowles who said that he was a \"conservative eclectic, holding the doctrine of seminal tendencies and opposing...the Aristotelian doctrine of the unity of form in beings, including man.\" Some sources state that he was the author of Summa Philosophiae, a history and description of the schools of philosophical thought then current, but the writing style is not similar to his other works, and Knowles, for one, does not believe it was authored by Kilwardby.\nIt has been alleged that Kilwardby was an opponent of Thomas Aquinas. In 1277 he prohibited the teaching of thirty theses, some of which have been thought to touch upon Thomas Aquinas' teaching. Recent scholars, however, such as Roland Hissette, have challenged this interpretation.\nWorks\nWritings on grammar\n* Commentaria Priscianus minor (A Commentary on the books 17 and 18 of Priscian's Institutiones grammaticae)\nWritings on logic\n* Notulae super librum Praedicamentorum\n* Notulae super librum Perihermeneias\n* Notule libri Priorum\n* Notule libri Posteriorum\n* Comentum super librum Topicorum\n* Notulae super librum Porphyrii\n* De natura relationis\n* Priorum Analyticorum expositio\n* Notuale super librum Sex Principiorum\nWritings on natural philosophy\n* De spiritu fantastico sive de receptione specierum\n* De tempore\nWritings on ethics\n* Quaestiones supra libros Ethicorum\n* Quaestiones in librum primum Sententiarum\n* Quaestiones in librum secundum Sententiarum\n* Quaestiones in librum tertium Sententiarum\n* Quaestiones in librum quartum Sententiarum\n* De ortu scientiarum\nDe tempore has been edited and translated by Alexander Broadie, and published as On Time and Imagination, Part 2: Introduction and Translation.
