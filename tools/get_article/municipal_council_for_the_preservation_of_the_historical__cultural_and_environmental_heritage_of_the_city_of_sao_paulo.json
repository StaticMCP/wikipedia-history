CONPRESP and DPH are interdependent and responsible for deliberating on the cultural and environmental preservation of the municipality.\nIt was created under Law No. 10.032, on September 27, 1985, as a collegiate cultural advisory agency linked to the Municipal Department of Culture. Its attributions, amended by Laws No. 10.236 on December 16, 1986, and No. 14.516 of October 11, 2007, stipulate that CONPRESP can grant approval for the listing of movable and immovable property, communicate the registration to similar bodies and claim benefits for the owners of these properties.\nMembers\nThe board is composed of one full member and one alternate member from the following representations:\n* CMSP - Municipal Chamber of São Paulo;\n* CREA - Regional Council of Engineering and Agronomy of São Paulo;\n* DPH - Department of Historical Heritage (Department Director);\n* IAB - Institute of Architects of Brazil - São Paulo Branch;\n* OAB - Order of Attorneys of Brazil - São Paulo Branch;\n* SMDU - Municipal Department of Urban Development;\n* SEL - Municipal Licensing Department;\n* SMC - Municipal Department of Culture;\n* SMJ - Municipal Department of Justice.\nOrganization\nAs established in the regiment, the council is composed of:\n* Presidency;\n* Chair's advisory body;\n* Plenary;\n* Executive secretary;\n* Advisory body.\nThe bodies must nominate a representative and an alternate who will be chosen by the mayor. The president and vice-president will be chosen by a vote of its members at a meeting held specifically for this purpose. The candidate with the majority of votes wins.\nOperation\nThe council must meet periodically twice a month, with the possibility of extra sessions whenever the situation demands it, as long as they are summoned by the president or a majority of its members. Among other duties, the executive secretary is responsible for writing up the records of each meeting in order to be signed by the president and the councillors present and then published in the city's official gazette.\nAll of the council's resolutions and deliberations are decided by a majority vote of the members present. The decisions regarding the designation of a landmark are based on studies conducted by the technical staff or by a private initiative. The document is formalized in the Livro do Tombamento, which contains the resolutions and definitions of the classification process and the area covered.\nCONPRESP's functions\n* Decide on the total or partial protection of movable and immovable property, whether publicly or privately owned;\n* Inform the state and federal registry offices about the registration of property;\n* Formulate the guidelines and strategies necessary to guarantee the preservation of cultural and natural assets;\n* Delimitation of the area surrounding a listed property in order for it to be properly controlled;\n* To promote the preservation and enhancement of the landscape, environments and ecological spaces that are important for maintaining environmental quality and guaranteeing physical and ecological memory;\n* Promote a strategy for monitoring the preservation and use of protected properties;\n* Adopt the measures provided for in Law No. 10.032, which are necessary for the effects of patrimony to be achieved;\n* In case of exceptional necessity, decide on proposals to revise the heritage process;\n* Maintain permanent contact with public and private, national and international organizations, in order to obtain resources, technical and cultural cooperation for planning the stages of preservation and revitalization of the municipality's cultural and natural assets;\n* When necessary and at a higher level of complexity, to express an opinion on projects, plans and proposals for construction, conservation, repair, restoration and demolition, as well as on applications for licenses to operate commercial activities or provide services in buildings located in areas defined as cultural and natural heritage preservation zones.\nSeal of Cultural Value of the City of São Paulo\nIn August 2016, seven sites in the city were awarded the seal of Cultural Value of the City of São Paulo, formalized in December 2015 by CONPRESP, with the purpose to honor venues that represent the place's social and cultural identity. Unlike a protected landmark, the seal does not require the owner to submit any project to intervene in the space to the council. However, the initiative does not guarantee preservation, only social mobilization for the preservation of the recognized asset.\nAmong the seven places that were awarded the seal of Cultural Value in the first half of 2016 are: the Carlino Restaurant, founded in 1881, and the Italianinha, Quatorze de Julho and Santa Tereza Bakeries, in operation since 1896, 1897 and 1872, respectively. Also awarded the seal are the Parque das Acácias (APRACS) and Parque das Hortênsias buildings, both from the 1950s, and the Casa da Bóia Metais e Hidráulica, the oldest rust store on Florêncio de Abreu Street, founded in 1898, which features a museum about trade and São Paulo's industrial era.\nThe seal of Cultural Value is effective for up to five years and can be renewed by CONPRESP and DPH, according to the preservation of the site. The first seven properties to receive the award were selected after a survey of the oldest establishments, based on the records of the São Paulo Trade Association and requests from the municipality's citizens. The council intends to select other places that are considered by the population to be part of their historical heritage.\nLegislation\nLaws\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Law\n!Date\n!Content\n|-\n|No. 8.204\n|January 13, 1975\n|Creation of the Municipal Department of Culture.\n|-\n|No. 8.252\n|May 20, 1975\n|Creation of the Department of Artistic Information and Documentation.\n|-\n|No. 14.223\n|September 26, 2006\n|Composition of the urban landscape of the city of São Paulo.\n|-\n|Organic Law of the City of São Paulo\n|1990\n|Includes articles on cultural and environmental preservation.\n|-\n|No. 10.032\n|December 27, 1985\n|Creation of a Municipal Council for the Preservation of the Historical, Cultural and Environmental Heritage of São Paulo.\n|-\n|No. 10.236\n|December 16, 1986\n|Amends provisions of Law No. 10.032, of December 27, 1985.\n|-\n|No. 14.405\n|May 21, 2007\n|Refers to the preservation of public property in municipal school activities.\n|-\n|No. 14.406\n|May 21, 2007\n|Establishment of the Permanent Program for the Protection and Conservation of the Intangible Heritage of São Paulo.\n|-\n|No. 14.424\n|June 1, 2007\n|Edition of the Municipal Atlas of the Historical, Archaeological, Architectural, Landscape and Cultural Heritage of the City of São Paulo and other measures.\n|-\n|No. 14.516\n|October 11, 2007\n|Changes and adds provisions to Law No. 10.032, of December 27, 1985, as amended by Law No. 10.236, of December 16, 1986, and provides other measures.\n|-\n|No. 14.517\n|October 16, 2007\n|Establishment of the Municipal Public-Private Partnerships Program;
