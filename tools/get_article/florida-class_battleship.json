Launched in 1910 and 1909 respectively and commissioned in 1911, they were slightly larger than the preceding  design but were otherwise very similar. This was the first US battleship class in which all ships received steam turbine engines. In the previous Delaware-class,  received steam turbine propulsion as an experiment while  retained triple-expansion engines.\nBoth ships were involved in the 1914 Second Battle of Vera Cruz, deploying their Marine contingents as part of the operation. Following the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917, both ships were deployed to Europe. Florida was assigned to the British Grand Fleet and based in Scapa Flow; in December 1918 she escorted President Woodrow Wilson to France for the peace negotiations. Utah was assigned to convoy escort duty; she was based in Ireland and was tasked with protecting convoys as they approached the European continent.\nRetained under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, both ships were modernized significantly, with torpedo bulges and oil-fired boilers installed and other improvements made, but were demilitarized under terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty. Florida was scrapped, Utah converted into first a radio-controlled target ship, then an anti-aircraft gunnery trainer. She served in the latter role until sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Her hull became deeply stuck in silt and mud as she sank, and thus was never raised. It remains on the bottom of the harbor as a war memorial.\nDesign\nThe Floridas were the third of 10 separate classes built between 1906 and 1919, a total of 22 battleships being commissioned. The new dreadnoughts of the American battle line were being designed from pre-dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs, as no US dreadnought had yet been commissioned at the time that the Floridas were designed; all were either at some stage of building or in design. American capital ship design was also heavily influenced by war games conducted at the US Navy's Naval War College. Captain William Sims led a reform movement that assigned warship design to the General Board.\nThese ships were an improvement over the preceding . Their engine rooms were larger to hold four Curtis or Parsons steam turbines. Their larger beam gave them greater metacentric height, in which the Delawares were notably deficient, which improved buoyancy and reduced hull stress. The ships mounted new /51-caliber guns as secondary batteries in casemates that boasted increased armor protection. The class retained the large and fully enclosed conning towers that were adopted for the preceding Delawares, as a result of American studies of the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. The design reduced the vulnerability of the command staff. Overall, these ships were much better protected than their British counterparts, although they were modified extensively during the interwar period.\nGeneral characteristics\nThe Florida-class ships were  long at the waterline and  overall. They had a beam of  and a draft of . They displaced  at standard displacement and  at full load. This was an increase of approximately  over the previous Delaware class. The ships also had some of their superstructure rearranged, including the lattice masts and the funnels. The Florida-class ships had a crew of 1,001 officers and men. The wider beam increased the vessels' metacentric height, which allowed the Floridas to accommodate their larger medium-caliber guns without any real penalty in topweight.\nFlorida was fitted experimentally with a larger bridge than was then standard, to house both ship and fire control personnel under armor, while Utah received a heavily armored fire-control tower atop a standard-sized bridge. The former proved especially successful, to the point that when a larger armored fire-control tower and standard bridge was proposed for the Nevada class, it was rejected in favor of a roomier bridge like that of Florida.\nThe two ships were modernized in 1925–27; among the improvements were the addition of torpedo bulges, which were designed to increase resistance to underwater damage—this widened the ships to . The ships also had their rear lattice masts removed and replaced with a pole mast. A catapult for launching aircraft was mounted on the number 3 gun turret.\nPropulsion\nThe ships were propelled by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines; steam was provided by 12 Babcock & Wilcox coal-fired boilers. The engines were rated at  to give a top speed of . On trials, Florida made  on ; Utahs turbines produced only  but still propelled the ship at . However, the engine and boiler room arrangements remained the same as in the Delawares, with the engine room situated between the rear main turrets and steam lines running beneath the superfiring rear turret. The ships had a range of  at a cruising speed of .\nThe engine rooms on these ships were lengthened to accommodate the larger Parsons steam turbines, which meant the after boiler room had to be eliminated. Funnel spacing was therefore closer than in the Delawares. The remaining boiler rooms were widened by ; to do this and maintain adequate underwater and coal bunker protection, the ships were made  beamier than the Delawares. During Florida and Utahs reconstruction in 1925–1927, their coal-fired boilers were replaced with four White-Forster oil-fired boilers. The reduction in the number of boilers allowed their twin funnels to be trunked into one single larger funnel.\nArmament\nmain guns arranged exactly the same as on the Delaware-class ships|alt=left side view of a large ship steaming through the water, with two boxy gun turrets in front and three in back, each with two guns.]]\nMain guns\nIt was intended originally to arm these ships with eight /45-caliber guns then in development in superfiring fore-and-aft mountings. As this gun did not go into service until 1914, the arrangement of ten /45-caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin gun turrets was retained from the Delaware class. The gun housings were the Mark 8 type, and they allowed for depression to −5&nbsp;degrees and elevation to 15&nbsp;degrees. The guns had a rate of fire of 2 to 3 rounds per minute. They fired  shells, of either armor-piercing (AP) or Common types, though the Common type was obsolete by 1915 and put out of production. The propellant charge was  in silk bags, and provided a muzzle velocity of . The guns were expected to fire 175 rounds before the barrels would require replacement. The two ships carried 100 shells per gun, or 1,000 rounds in total. At 15&nbsp;degrees elevation, the guns could hit targets out to approximately\nUnfortunately, the turret layout of the Delawares was also retained, with its respective challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, was placed on the main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.\nOther weapons\nC&R proposed  secondary guns for these ships, protected by  casemate armor. This would have been the only change from the protective scheme carried over from the Delaware class. However, a new 5-inch/51-caliber gun was adopted instead after concerns about inadequate splinter protection for secondary gun casemates and smoke uptakes led to an increase in armor. Sixteen of these weapons were fitted in individual casemates. These guns fired a  armor-piercing (AP) shell at a muzzle velocity of  and a rate of 8 to 9 rounds per minute. The guns could depress to −10&nbsp;degrees and elevate to 15&nbsp;degrees. The guns were manually operated, and had a range of train of about 150&nbsp;degrees in either direction.\nFlorida and Utah received two /23-caliber guns in 1917 for anti-aircraft (AA) defense. This was increased to eight guns between 1926 and 1928. These guns fired a  shell at a muzzle velocity of  to a maximum range of  and ceiling of  at an elevation of 75 degrees and a rate of between eight and nine rounds per minute.\nThe ships were also armed with two  submerged torpedo tubes. The tubes were mounted one on each broadside. The torpedoes were  long and carried a  warhead. They had a range of  and traveled at a speed of .\nArmor\nThe armor layout was largely the same as in the preceding Delaware-class battleships. The armored belt ranged in thickness from  in the more important areas of the ship. Casemated guns mounted in the hull had between  of armor plate. After modernization, some of the casemated guns were moved to the superstructure;\n}}\nReferences\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\nFurther reading\n*"
