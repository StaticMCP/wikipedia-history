Prospect School was formed in 1985 by combining Stoneham Boys School and Westwood Girls School. To this day the school has two entrances because the combined Stoneham and Westwood buildings were originally built close to each other and each had its own entrance.\nProspect School became an academy on 1 July 2011 and is now sponsored by the King's Group Academies.
