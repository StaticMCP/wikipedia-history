Beginning in 2003, they put out six games that did not use the d20 trademark but which used familiar d20 systems available via the OGL\", including the WARS Roleplaying Game in 2005. Applecline noted that some of these lines did well, while others \"did not fair as well due to the newfound weakness of d20\" and that its supplement WARS: Soul and Steel \"never saw print; it was instead run in Signs & Portents from issue #39 (December, 2006) to #51 (December, 2007).\nReferences"
