These include jailbreaks, riots, bomb explosions, and on rare occasions, severe weather events like blizzards. An authorized law enforcement agency may blockade roads, waterways, or facilities, evacuate or deny access to affected areas, and arrest violators or suspicious persons. The warning is usually issued by a law enforcement agency and is relayed by the National Weather Service.\nExamples\nBULLETIN – EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\nLAW ENFORCEMENT WARNING\nRELAYED BY NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TULSA OK\n627 AM CDT THU JUL 19 2012\nTHE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS TRANSMITTED AT THE REQUEST OF...\nTULSA POLICE DEPARTMENT\nRESIDENTS IN AN AREA BETWEEN 16TH AND 17TH STREETS...FROM 108TH EAST\nAVENUE TO 109TH EAST AVENUE NEED TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES...LOCK ALL\nDOORS...AND ARE NOT TO COME OUTSIDE AS POLICE ARE PURSUING AN ARMED\nSUSPECT.\n$$\nBULLETIN - EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\nLAW ENFORCEMENT WARNING\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\nRELAYED BY NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE GRAND RAPIDS MI\n1030 PM EDT SAT SEP 29 2012\nTHE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS TRANSMITTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT.\nCITY OF WHITE CLOUD RESIDENTS...PLEASE LOCK ALL YOUR DOORS\nIMMEDIATELY.
