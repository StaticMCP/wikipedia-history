Studio Tour Shanghai – The Making of Harry Potter () is an upcoming studio tour and visitor attraction located in the Minhang District of Shanghai, China, owned by Warner Bros., operated by their Studio Tour division. The attraction is the third permanent The Making of Harry Potter Studio Tour in the world, following the original in London and its second location in Tokyo.\nHistory\nThe project was officially announced by Warner Bros. Discovery and Jinjiang International in February 2025. The announcement followed a fast-tracked negotiation process, with construction expected to begin in the latter half of the same year. The attraction is part of a larger renovation and revitalization of the 1984-opened-old Jinjiang Action Park site, which closed in January 2025 to commence the transformation.\nThe Shanghai facility is planned to be the largest Harry Potter Studio Tour globally, covering an area of approximately 53,000 square meters. The attraction is distinct from theme park experiences like The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Beijing, offering a museum-style, behind-the-scenes look at the filmmaking process.\nTour\nThe attraction is designed to be predominantly indoors, with about 90% of the visitor experience taking place inside soundstages and exhibits.\nThe Studio Tour is expected to operate on a full reservation system, requiring visitors to book a specific date and entry time in advance to manage crowd flow. The facility is projected to attract approximately 2 million visitors annually.\nTransportation\nThe Studio Tour is being constructed at the site of Jinjiang Action Park in the Minhang District of Shanghai. The location is easily accessible, situated near the Shanghai Metro Line 1's Jinjiang Park station.\nSee also\n* Warner Bros. Studio Tour\n* Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood\n* Warner Bros.
