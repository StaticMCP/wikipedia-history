For long, the Boros have been farmers living in an Agrarian society with a strong tradition of fishery, poultry, piggery, with rice and jute cultivation, and betel nut plantation. They make their own clothing from scratch, such as traditional attires. In recent decades, the Boros are influenced by recent social reforms under Boro Brahma Dharma and the spread of Christianity.\nReligion\nBoros follow Bathouism, Boro Brahma Dharma and Shaivism. Some Boros practice Islam, Christianity, predominantly Baptists.\nMusic and dance\nBagurumba\nThe Boros traditionally dance Bagurumba. This dance is accompanied by the Bagurumba song.\nMoreover, there are about 15/18 kinds of Kherai Dance like Ranachandi, Gorai Dabrainai, Dao Thwi Lwngnai, Khwijema hannai, Mwsaglangnai.\nMusical instruments\nAmong the many different musical instruments, the Boros use: Kham, Siphung, Serja, Jotha, Jabsring, Khawang, Bingi, Rege.\n* Siphung: This is a long bamboo flute with only five holes rather than six as the north Indian Bansuri would have and is also much longer than it, producing a much lower tone.\n* Serja: This is a violin-like instrument. It has a round body and the scroll is bent forward.\n* Khawang: It is a block of bamboo split into two halves for clapping.\n* Kham: It is a long drum made of wood and skin of goat.\nFile:Playing chifung (flute).jpg|Chifung (flute) is an instrument of Boro community\nFile:Kham, a musical instrument of Bodo community.jpg|Kham, a musical instrument of Bodo community.\nCuisine\nFood\nRice is the main staple food but eaten with non-vegetarian dishes like fish or pork.\nTraditional dishes\n* Oma Bedor: Most of the Boro people like Oma (Pork) Bedor (meat).

The Boros also like to have Dau Bedor, Jinai, and Samo.\nAlcoholic beverage\nJou Gishi: Rice beer is produced by the Boros from different kinds of rice varieties using traditionally created starter cakes called angkur.  The angkur contains a traditional recipe of herbs (dhapat tita, dhan, senikuthi, agara) that provide Jou gishi with its distinctive flavour, colour, and ethno-medicinal properties and the consumption of Jou gishi is sometimes ritualistic on the occasions of festivals, marriages and communal gatherings.\nFestivals\nBwisagu\nBwisagu is the most cherished springtime festival celebrated by the Boro people at the advent of the new year.
