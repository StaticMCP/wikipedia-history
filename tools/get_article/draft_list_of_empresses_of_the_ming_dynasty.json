As members of the House of Zhu, these women held the highest female rank in the imperial court and were central figures in the management of the inner palace, dynastic rituals, and succession politics and the cultural ideals of Confucian womanhood. Following the fall of the Ming capital to rebel forces in 1644, members of the imperial family continued to claim legitimacy in the Southern Ming regimes until 1662 though fewer empresses were formally installed during this period.\nThe Ming dynasty was founded by the peasant rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang, known as the Hongwu Emperor, who also appointed the first Ming empress, Empress Ma. All Ming empresses were empress consorts of emperors from the House of Zhu, and they held the highest female rank in the imperial court. While their public roles were often ceremonial, many empresses wielded significant influence behind the scenes, especially as mothers of emperors or as empress dowagers during regencies.\nThe (continuous) longest-tenured empress consort of the Ming dynasty was likely Empress Zhang (1470–1541), consort of the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505). She was appointed empress in 1487 upon her husband’s ascension and remained empress until the Hongzhi Emperor’s death in 1505, serving for approximately 18 years.The shortest-tenured empress of the Ming dynasty was Empress Wang (née Wang, d. 1507), consort of the Chenghua Emperor, who was appointed empress in 1487 but deposed shortly after, serving less than a year.\nThe youngest woman to become empress during the Ming dynasty was likely Empress Sun (Empress Xiaogongzhang), who was born around 1399 and became empress in 1428 at approximately age 29. She was the consort of the Xuande Emperor and the mother of Emperor Yingzong. After her husband's death, she served as empress dowager during her son's reign and wielded considerable influence at court.\nThe oldest empress at death was Empress Ma (Empress Xiaocigao), the principal wife of the Hongwu Emperor. She was born in 1332 and died in 1382 at the age of 50. Empress Ma was highly respected for her wisdom, frugality, and Confucian virtue, and she played a key advisory role during the founding years of the Ming dynasty.\nThe majority of Ming dynasty empresses resided in the Forbidden City, a 72-hectare (180-acre) imperial complex in Beijing, which served as the ceremonial and domestic center of the court from 1420 onward. Within the Forbidden City, the empress traditionally lived in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility (坤宁宫, Kunning Gong), located in the Inner Court alongside the emperor’s quarters. Prior to the reign of the Yongle Emperor, who officially moved the capital to Beijing in 1420, empresses resided in the Ming Palace in Nanjing, a similarly grand complex often referred to as the “Forbidden City of Nanjing”.\nBackground\nThe Ming dynasty was founded in 1368 by Zhu Yuanzhang, later known as the Hongwu Emperor. His principal wife, Empress Ma (1332–1382), became the first empress of the dynasty. Born into a modest background and adopted by rebel leader Guo Zixing, she married Zhu during his early rise to power. As empress, she was known for her political insight, frugality, and support of Confucian values. Empress Ma played a stabilizing role in the early Ming court and was highly respected for her integrity and influence in palace affairs.\nIn the Ming dynasty, the imperial succession was governed by strict primogeniture, as outlined in the Huang-Ming Zuxun (皇明祖訓), the ancestral instructions issued by the Hongwu Emperor in 1395. According to these rules, the heir to the throne was to be the eldest son of the empress, or, if unavailable, the next eldest legitimate son. Sons of concubines were explicitly excluded from the line of succession.\nAlthough empresses were not permitted to participate directly in state affairs, their status as mothers of crown princes gave them significant influence over succession. The empress’s legitimacy and moral standing were critical in determining the heir’s acceptance by court officials and the broader bureaucracy. For example, during the reign of the Wanli Emperor, conservative officials insisted that his eldest son born to Empress Xiaoduanxian be named crown prince, despite the emperor’s preference for a younger son by a favored concubine.\nWhile empresses could not override succession laws, they often acted as guardians of dynastic order, especially as empress dowagers. Their presence helped legitimize heirs and stabilize transitions, particularly during regencies or succession disputes. However, the only major violation of the succession order came  from the Yongle Emperor, who usurped the throne from his nephew in a civil war (1399–1402).\nIn the Ming dynasty, the empress (皇后, huánghòu) held the highest female rank in the imperial hierarchy. While the emperor was the supreme head of state, the empress was regarded as the “mother of the nation” and the moral exemplar of Confucian womanhood. Her primary responsibilities were centered in the inner court, where she oversaw the imperial harem, managed palace rituals, and ensured the upbringing of imperial heirs.\nAccording to the Hongwu Emperor’s Ancestral Instructions, empresses were explicitly forbidden from participating in state affairs, a reaction to perceived political interference by women in earlier dynasties. The empress was expected to maintain order within the palace and serve as a model of virtue, but not to influence governance directly. This restriction was enforced through a codified system of palace regulations and ranks for women officials, including six service divisions and a supervisory office.\nUnlike emperors, who presided over court audiences and made decisions based on ministerial proposals, empresses had no formal role in policy-making. However, their proximity to the emperor, especially in private, allowed them to advocate for family members, mediate disputes, or protect allies within the bureaucracy.\nList of empresses\nThe empress (皇后; huánghòu) of the Ming dynasty held the highest female title in the imperial hierarchy. During her lifetime, she was addressed with formal honorifics such as “Her Majesty” (皇后陛下; huánghòu bìxià) or simply “The Empress”, though her personal name was rarely recorded or used publicly, in keeping with court etiquette and Confucian modesty.\nAfter death, empresses were granted posthumous names (謚號; shìhào), typically beginning with the character “Xiao” (孝) meaning “filial,” followed by a string of virtues such as “benevolent,” “serene,” or “dignified.” These names reflected the moral ideals of Confucian womanhood and were used in official records and ancestral rites. For example, Empress Ma, wife of the Hongwu Emperor, was posthumously titled Empress Xiaocigao (孝慈高皇后).\nIn addition to posthumous names, empresses were also honored with temple names (廟號; miàohào) if they were deified or venerated in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, though this was more commonly reserved for emperors. Some empresses, especially those who died before their husbands’ accession or were politically sidelined, were granted the title of empress posthumously.\nUnlike emperors, empresses did not receive era names (年號; niánhào), as these were sovereign designations used to mark the reign of an emperor. However, empresses were often referred to by the era name of their husband’s reign (e.g., “Empress of the Wanli era”) in historical texts and genealogies.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ming dynasty (1368–1644)\n!Emperor\n!Title/Name\n!Picture\n!Birth\n!Became empress consort\n!Ceased to be empress consort\n!Death\n|-\n!Hongwu Emperor\n|Empress Xiaocigao\n|\n|18 July 1332\n|23 January 1368 (aged 36)\n|23 September 1382 (aged 50)\n|23 September 1382 (aged 50)\n|-\n!Jianwen Emperor\n|Empress Xiaominrang\n|\n|1378\n|20 March 1399 (aged 20-21)\n|13 July 1402 (aged 23–24)\n|1402 (aged 23–24)\n|-\n!Yongle Emperor\n|Empress Renxiaowen\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Hongxi Emperor\n|Empress Chengxiaozhao\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Xuande Emperor\n|Empress Hu\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Empress Xiaogongzhang\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Zhengtong Emperor\n| Empress Qian\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Jingtai Emperor\n|Empress Wang\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Empress Hang\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Chenghua Emperor\n|Empress Wu\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Empress Wang\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!
