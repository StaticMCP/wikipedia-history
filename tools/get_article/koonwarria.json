      "text": "# Koonwarria\n\nKoonwarria manifrons is an extinct species of ray-finned fish that lived in a polar lake in what is now Koonwarra, Victoria, Australia during the Early Cretaceous epoch. Fossils have been retrieved from the Strzelecki Group.\nKoonwarria manifrons shares many anatomical similarities with the family Archaeomaenidae, and is assumed to be descended from the archaeomaenids, but, is regarded as distinct enough to be placed in its own monotypic family, Koonwarriidae.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
