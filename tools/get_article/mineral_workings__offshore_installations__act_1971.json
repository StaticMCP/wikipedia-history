The first gas was found in September 1965 by the self-elevating drilling rig Sea Gem. Tragically, on 27 December 1965 Sea Gem collapsed and sank 43 miles east of the Humber. Thirteen of the crew of 32 were killed. A tribunal was appointed in February 1967 to establish the circumstances of the accident. The hearing lasted 29 days, and the tribunal report was published on 26 July 1967. The report identified that statutory provisions for regulating the safety of offshore installations, together with credible sanctions, should be available for installations working on the United Kingdom continental shelf. The Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 enacted these measures which gave the Government the powers to regulate the safety, health and welfare on offshore installations.\nMineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971\nThe Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 received royal assent on 27 July 1971.

This states that \"All the provisions of the Act other than sections 4 and 5 shall come into force on 1 May 1972 and sections 4 and 5 of the Act shall come into force on 31st August 1972.\"\nConsequential legislation\nThe 1971 act empowered the Secretary of State to make a wide range of regulations, a sample of these include:\n* The Offshore Installations (Registration) Regulations 1972 (SI 1972/702)\n* The Offshore Installations (Managers) Regulations 1972 (SI 1972/703)\n* The Offshore Installations (Logbooks and Registration of Death) Regulations 1972 (SI 1972/1542)\n* The Offshore Installations (Public Inquiries) Regulations 1974 (SI 1974/338)\n* The Offshore Installations (Construction and Survey) Regulations 1974 (SI 1974/289)\n* The Offshore Installations (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/1542)\n* The Offshore Installations (Operational Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1976 Statutory Instrument (SI 1976/1019)\n* The Offshore Installations (Life-saving Appliances) Regulations 1977 Statutory Instrument  (SI 1977/486)\n* The Offshore Installations (Fire-fighting Equipment) Regulations 1978 Statutory Instrument (SI 1978/611)\nCertification\nThe Offshore Installations (Construction and Survey) Regulations 1974 (SI 1974/289) established a certification regime. Offshore duty holders (oil and gas companies) appointed a Certifying Authority to inspect the design, construction and operation of their installation(s) against published guidance. The Certifying Authorities were the major ship classification societies: Lloyd's Register of Shipping, Bureau Veritas, Germanisher Lloyd's, Det Norske Veritas, American  Bureau of Shipping. The Petroleum Engineering Division of the Department of Energy audited the Certifying Authorities, for compliance with their duties under the legislation and the against the guidance.\nSubsequent legislation\nAfter the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (c. 37) was enacted its provisions were applied offshore by The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (Application outside Great Britain) Order 1977 (SI 1977/1232).\nFollowing the Piper Alpha disaster and the Inquiry by Lord Cullen the Offshore Safety Act 1992 (c. 15) was enacted to better regulate offshore safety. The provisions of the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 were made relevant statutory provisions of the Offshore Safety Act 1992.\nAs of August 2020, sections 1 to 6, 8, 10, and the schedule of the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 have been repealed by subsequent legislation. Only sections 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are still in force.\nSee also\n* Sea Gem\n* Piper Alpha\n* Heath and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974\n* Health and Safety Executive\n* Oil platform\n* Offshore Installation Manager\n* List of oil and gas fields of the North Sea\n* North Sea Oil\nReferences"
