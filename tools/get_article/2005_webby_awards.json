It was hosted by comedian Rob Corddry, and judging took place covering 4,300 sites from more than 40 countries by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. Al Gore was awarded a lifetime achievement award and for his five-word acceptance speech he delivered the frequently-cited line, \"Please don't recount this vote\" – a reference to the 2000 Florida election recount.\nNominees and winners\n:([https://web.archive.org/web/20070311153208/http://webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=9])\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
