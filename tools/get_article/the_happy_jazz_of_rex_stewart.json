      "text": "# The Happy Jazz of Rex Stewart\n\nThe Happy Jazz of Rex Stewart, also reissued as The Rex Stewart Memorial Album, is an album by cornetist Rex Stewart which was recorded in 1960 and released on Prestige Records' subsidiary Swingville label.\nReception\n}}\nScott Yanow of AllMusic states, \"Stewart's technique and range had shrunk a bit by 1960, but his sense of humor and ability to make colorful tonal variations were still very much intact. This is a particularly fun set with Stewart doubling on kazoo and taking three good-time vocals ... The music is full of good spirits and memorable moments ... Highly recommended and well worth searching for.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Red Ribbon\" (Dorothy J. Odam) – 3:04\n# \"If I Could Be With You (One Hour Tonight)\" (James P.
