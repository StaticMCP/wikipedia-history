Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 14,377 people.\nThe area is a Conservative stronghold with the party holding half the seats at every election.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Troon was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained all of the former Troon East, Troon North, Troon South and Troon West wards as well as the western part of the former Dundonald and Loans ward. The ward includes the northwesternmost part of the council area up to its border with North Ayrshire and includes the town of Troon as well as Barassie and the uninhabited Lady Isle in the Firth of Clyde. The ward's boundaries were unchanged following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Peter Convery(Conservative)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Nan McFarlane(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Philip Saxton(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Bill McIntosh(Conservative)\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Craig Mackay(SNP)\n|rowspan=2|Bob Pollock(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Kenneth Bell(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
