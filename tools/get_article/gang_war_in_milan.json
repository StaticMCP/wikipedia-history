Lenzi stated in an interview that both the film's story and script were by Franco Enna, a giallo novelist who lived in Switzerland and that the credited writer Ombretta Lanza was a daughter of one of the producers who attributed to the story. Lenzi than later claimed that he completely re-wrote the script as it was closer to a 1930s crime film than a film noir.\nIt was filmed at Icet - De Paolis Studios in Milan and on location in Milan.\nRelease\nGang War in Milan was released theatrically in Italy on 23 February 1973 where it was distributed by Variety Film. The film grossed a total of 631.702 million Italian lira on its release.\nReception\nDirector Umberto Lenzi later felt that the film's story had \"a basic error on the behalf of the producers [...]. We shouldn't have made the protagonist a pimp. You can have a pickpocket, a drug dealer, or a killer, but not a pimp, because the viewer doesn't sympathize with him. He's a dirty soundrel with whom you can't identify\"\nSee also\n* List of Italian films of 1973\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*  [http://www.squadravolanteligera.com/milanorovente.htm Film locations in Milan]"
