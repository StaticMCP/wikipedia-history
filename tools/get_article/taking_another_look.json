Featuring a newly minted lineup of his '70s electric band, Taking Another Look features keyboardist Mike Logan, guitarist Henry Johnson, bassist Joshua Ramos, and drummer Charles Heath, all of whom reveal a knack for the funky, soulful jazz Lewis is reinvestigating here.\"\nCarl Schonbeck of PopMatters praised the album saying, \"No polite promenade down memory lane, Ramsey Taking Another Look packs up everything to love about Sun Goddess and forcefully plants it in the here and now...Ramsey Taking Another Look is a record that few thought Ramsey Lewis would ever make (perhaps least of all the man himself) and goes to show sometimes the best things can occur out of nowhere. After his initial reluctance to revisit electric jazz, Lewis now rates his latest among the five best records he’s ever made. Who are any of us to argue?\"\nTrack listing\nBonus tracks\nReferences"
