It is currently in alpha.\nIt is released under GNU General Public License version 3. It is written in C++ and uses Qt for its graphical user interface, FFmpeg for its multimedia functions, OpenImageIO library, OpenColorIO for color management and CMake build system for configuring.\nThe plan of the development team is to combine complete color management, a fast and high-fidelity half-float/float-based render pipeline, node-based compositing and audio mixing, and a highly efficient automated disk cache all together in the one program. According to the development team, this batch of features is one \"no other NLE - not even commercial - has tried to do\".\nFeatures\nOlive has the following features:\n* Intro/outro sequences\n* Cutting with Razor, Ripple, Slide, and Slip tools\n* Support for picture-in-picture or side-by-side clips\n* Hardware acceleration\n* Watermarking\nHistory\nOlive 0.1 was in development for a year before it was published. The original author said that the program itself was his first C++ and his first large-scale programming project. Due to being inexperienced the author says that a lot of programming and video handling mistakes were made. It is known to be unstable. Since the code base of 0.1 wouldn't allow planned features and because the development team saw that the \"codebase was full of problems that made it unsustainable\", the program had to be rewritten from the ground up.\nVersion 0.2, unofficially known as The Rewrite, is not officially released yet, nightly builds can be downloaded and tested. It is also planned to add support for OpenTimelineIO. It lacks support for files generated by version 0.1 but features several improvements.\nThe far future version 0.3 is planned to improve project management features allowing users to pre-cache only the parts of a video needed. It is also planned to improve the integration of multiple projects making collaborative work easier as well as improving the render pipeline for network rendering to allow multiple computers working together rendering the same project for preview caching and for export.\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"; width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!
