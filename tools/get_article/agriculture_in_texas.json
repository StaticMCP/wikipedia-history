Agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of Texas and is the primary land use in the state. It is the country's leading producer of livestock. Wine production in Texas is significant, although small by global standards. The state is a major producer of rice as well as the top producer of cotton in the US.\nHistory\nMaize agriculture began on the Great Plains by AD 900, initiating the Southern Plains villagers period of western Oklahoma and Texas. It probably came about as an extension westward and northward of the Caddoan cultures of eastern Texas. The Plains Village culture consisted of hamlets and semi-permanent villages along major rivers such as the Red, Washita, and Canadian. Subsistence was a combination of agriculture and hunting. A drying climatic trend beginning AD 1000 or 1100 may have tipped the subsistence scale more toward hunting and less toward a dependence upon agriculture. The Antelope Creek Phase of Plains villagers, dated from AD 1200 to 1450 in the Texas panhandle was influenced by the Southwestern Pueblo people of the Rio Grande valley in New Mexico. The historic descendants of the Southern Plains villagers are possibly the Wichita and Pawnee Indians.\nStaples of indigenous Texan agriculture which remain important in the 21st century are corn, beans, squash, pecans, and prickly pear.\nRanching was introduced to Texas by Spanish settlers with the first cattle being in the Rio Grande valley, it had become established by 1680. Early vaqueros, the predecessors to the cowboys, served as independent contractors to the powerful landowners. In 1778 the Spanish crown imposed a controversial Fondo de Mestenos, Mustang Tax, on all cattle and horses which was not revoked until 1795. Cattle drives out of Texas to market destinations became prominent around this time.\nThe Mexican War of Independence caused the collapse of much of the organized agriculture in Texas. American settlers began moving into Texas and setting up farms and ranches. This increased after the Texas Revolution and Mexican-American War.\nCultivation of mung bean here began during World War II when a Chinese native by the name of Henry Huie – who worked as a U.S. Army cook – planted the staple crop in the clay plains near Vernon.\nHistory of Texas A&M University\nLivestock\nTexas leads the nation in number of cattle, usually exceeding 16 million head. The sprawling  La Escalera Ranch, located  south of Fort Stockton, is one of the largest cattle ranches in the Southwestern United States.\nTexas leads nationally in production of sheep and goat products. Mills County bills itself as the \"Meat Goat Capital of America.\" Goat production has increased both as a result of more demand for goat meat and because of decreasing average property sizes. Angora goats are also raised for fiber.\nCereal\nTexas is a leader in cereal crop production. Three counties in the state&mdash;Colorado, Wharton, and Matagorda&mdash;take advantage of water from the Lower Colorado River Authority to grow rice and are responsible for about 5% of annual U.S. rice production. The water supply from the Colorado River has been limited cut off during severe drought.\nRice\nFruit\nThe Rio Grande valley is one of the best areas for the cultivation of grapefruit. Early varieties like the Duncan had many seeds and pale flesh, but in the 1880s citrus growers in Texas and Florida discovered pink-fleshed seedless grapefruit mutations like the Ruby Red, which along with red-fleshed varieties like the Rio Red and Star Ruby are preferred varieties for modern commercial production. Phomopsis stem-end rot is a common problem in grapefruit here. Burger and Davis found in 1982 that etaconazole and imazalil are effective against the post-harvest effects if Phomopsis has already occurred pre-harvest in Texas groves. Texas also produces a significant crop of Oranges. Orange production during the 2022–2023 season was 1.7 million 40-pound boxes. The Rio Grande valley's citrus industry is celebrated at the annual Citrus Fiesta.\nGrapes are a common crop in some parts of Texas. Pierce's Disease (PD) is a common problem in the East and South. From 1970 to 1996, PD was unknown outside of the southern part of the state. Though thought to be impossible, in 1996 suddenly many vineyards were heavily hit in north central Texas and some were wiped out completely. PD resistance is important here due to PD's prevalence. Some areas suffer from Cotton root rot of many crops, including grape. It is so associated with this state that it is also called Texas root rot.\nIn the 1990s strawberry acres greatly increased especially around Poteet, however by 2004 imported strawberries had competed almost all strawberry production out of the state.\nTexas is also a large producer of cantaloupes.\nOlive trees are considered an exotic crop in Texas. The Arbequina, Arbosana, Frantoio, Manzanilla, Mission, Pendolino, and Picual are grown but the Pendolino is a poor performer and planted to pollinate the Manzanilla. A severe freeze can kill olive trees, so the best area is north of Laredo, Texas and southwest of San Antonio, in an area known as the Winter Garden Region.\nWine\nVegetables\nTexas and Arkansas are among the higher producers of spinach in North America and form the eastern limit of large scale commercial production. Major spinach pests here include Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Pegomya spp., and Circulifer tenellus (Baker).\nTexas is the westernmost limit of commercial okra production. Pests include the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta (Buren)), the southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula (Linnaeus)), and leaffooted bugs (various Leptoglossus spp.).\nTexas is one of the largest producers of onions. Production here suffers from onion thrips (Thrips tabaci (Lindeman)) and onion maggots (Delia antiqua (Meigen)).\nTexas is one of the major growers of watermelons. Whiteflies and aphids commonly vector Cucurbit viruses here. Texas A&M AgriLife Extension provides commercial production guides for both seeded and seedless. For seeded varieties they recommend Allsweet, Black Diamond, Bush Sugar Baby, Calhoun Grey, Charleston Gray, Crimson Sweet, Crimson Tide, Dixielee, Golden Crown, Jubilee, Mickylee, Minilee, Mirage, OrangeGlo, Prince Charles, Royal Jubilee, Tendersweet, and Yellow Doll; while for seedless varieties, Gem Dandy, Matrix, Summersweet 5244, Tiffany, and Tri-X 313. In both, common diseases are Alternaria, Downy Mildew, Fusarium Wilt, Gummy Stem Blight, nematodes, Powdery Mildew, and various viruses. Common insect pests are aphids, armyworm (beet armyworm and fall armyworm), Cabbage Looper, cutworm, various leafminers, various mites, thrips, webworm, and various whiteflies. AgriLife also makes recommendations for fungicide, insecticide, and herbicide control of all these in this crop, and for common weeds.\nAgriLife provides many other commercial grower guides: asparagus, green/snap bean, pinto bean, table beet, broccoli, cabbage, cantaloupe/muskmelon, carrot, cauliflower, celery, Chinese cabbage, cilantro, collards/kale, pickling cucumber, slicing cucumber, eggplant, garlic, honeydew, melon, kohlrabi, leeks, lettuce, mustard greens, okra, onion, parsley, bell pepper, jalapeño, potato, pumpkin, radish, Southern pea/cowpea, spinach, squash, sweet corn, sweet potato, Swiss chard, tomato, and turnip.\nFiber\nTexas is 'king of cotton,' leading the nation in cotton production, its leading crop and second-most-valuable farm product.\nFlax was introduced to Texas as a commercial crop in the late 1930s and production peaked in 1949 at 330,000 acres, its production never recovered after being heavily impacted by drought in the 1950s.\nPests\nFire ants (Solenopsis invicta) are an invasive agricultural pest here.\nAlthough the Asian cockroach (Blattella asahinai (Mizukubo)) is a widespread invasive species here it inflicts only minor damage on horticulturals. It also serves as an egg predator of more pestiferous insects, including corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea (Boddie)) and beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua (Hübner)). In southern counties the roach is one of the most numerous egg predators, in row crops at ~. The Surinam cockroach (Pycnoscelus surinamensis) is not proven to be a major pest but data is lacking. It should not be confused with the Indian cockroach (P. indica) which does not occur here.\nFlea beetles, specifically the redheaded (Systena frontalis (Fabricius)) and Smartweed (S. hudsonias) are common in the east but rarely found to the west of there. They are voracious, polyphagous herbivores of both crops and weeds. Due to their affinity for weeds as well, crop protection must include weed management. The Southern tobacco flea beetle (Epitrix fasciata (Blatchley)) is found along the Gulf Coast.\nRegulation\nTexas Department of Agriculture\nEducation\nTexas A&M\nSee also\n* Agriculture in California\n* Agriculture in Florida\n* Texan cuisine\n* Prehistoric agriculture on the Great Plains\n* Cattle drives in the United States\n* King Ranch\n* 1934–35 North American drought\n* Texas Farm Bureau\n* Farm-to-market road\nReferences"
