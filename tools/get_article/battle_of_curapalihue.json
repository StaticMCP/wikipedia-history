The result was a defeat for the royalists.\nBackground\nAfter the defeat of Chacabuco and the capture of Santiago by the Army of the Andes, the royalist forces concentrated around Concepción under Colonel José Ordóñez. General José de San Martín ordered Colonel Juan Gregorio de Las Heras to take command of a division and move south. When Colonel Ordóñez heard of the approach of the patriot army, he decided to stage a surprise night attack against them.\nThe battle\nThe Spanish forces, under the command of  Lieutenant Colonel Juan José Campillo, were composed of 500 infantry and 100 cavalry. They attacked at 1:30 AM, but their surprise was foiled and they  had to retreat very soon leaving behind 10 soldiers dead and 7 prisoners, while the patriot forces suffered almost no casualties.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.icarito.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_152309031_147556090_1,00.html Historia de Chile]\n* [http://www.chillanviejo.cl/?modname=contenidos&id=40 Chillán Viejo, Chile]"
