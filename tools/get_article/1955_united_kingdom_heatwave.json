The drought was the seventh worst recorded in Yorkshire and worse than that of the 1976 United Kingdom heat wave. It followed a period of extreme rain, mitigating its effects by water table and reservoir reduction.\nJuly 1955 was a very dry month in the UK. Much of the south and east of England saw little rain; for instance, Bury St Edmunds saw no rain at all in the whole month. However, on 18 July, Martinstown, Dorset saw unusually heavy rain, with  recorded in the village over a nine-hour period.\nSee also\n* Drought in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
