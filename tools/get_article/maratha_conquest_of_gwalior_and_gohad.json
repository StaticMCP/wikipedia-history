Marathas led by Mahadaji Shinde besieges the fort of Gwalior which falls, after 5 months Gohad also falls to Marathas the Jat Raja is captured while his queens and other ladies commit Jauhar in the fort.\nSiege of Gwalior\nIn 1783, Gwalior Fort, an impenetrable fortress, was under the control of Maharana Chatra Singh Jat, the Rana of Gohad; hence Mahadaji Shinde was able to build upon an initial plan for the capture of the fort. Moving increasingly closer to Gwalior, he fortified his position with a division at Bawanburji and took over the township from the rulers of Gohad. On 18 February 1783, he laid siege to Gwalior Fort; this would last for a period of almost 5 months. With the siege going on for some years, Mahadji had captured it from Rana Chatra Singh on 21 July 1783, and thereafter put it into the hands of Khanderao Haribhalerao to administer.\nSiege of Gohad\nGohad was now in the spotlight of Mahadaji Scindia after securing victory in Gwalior. To counter the advances of Mahadaji, the Rana of Gohad applied to the British for help. But while he is doing that, the Anglo-Maratha Wars has just come to an end, and these currents have filed their opposition in the minds of the British against engaging in further warfare with the Marathas.\nMaharana Chhatra singh, the ruler of Gohad, had been besieged by Mahadaji Scindia, when he had the supply lines of the fortress cut off from the outside world. On 23 February 1784, he succeeded in capturing the Gohad fort. Maharana Chhatra Singh fought and fled but was apprehended by Mahadaji Scindia and imprisoned in Gwalior.\nAftermath\nEnglish people looked for Mahadaji's intervention on behalf of the Rana of Gohad, but with limited success. Seeing his defeat as unavoidable, Maharani performed Jauhar on 27 February 1783, leading to Maratha control of the fort. The place is still known as Jauhar Kund within Gwalior Fort.\nHe further consolidated his dominance by swiftly conquering Gwalior and Gohad. Once he had acquired these territories, he then turned his attention to political affairs in Delhi.\nReferences"
