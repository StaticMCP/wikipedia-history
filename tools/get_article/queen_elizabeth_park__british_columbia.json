It is located on top of Little Mountain approximately  above sea level and is the location of former basalt quarries dug in the beginning of the twentieth century to provide materials for roads in the city.\nHistory\nBefore European settlement, the park was an old-growth forest and a spawning ground for salmon. Grey wolves, elk and bears would frequent the area. The settler population which began in earnest in the 1870s exterminated the grey wolves, elk and bears, chopped down all the old growth forest and paved over the salmon creeks. The salmon creeks that extend from Queen Elizabeth to False Creek do still exist today, however, they have been paved over.\nIn 1936, the BC Tulip Association suggested the creation of sunken gardens within the old quarries to the city's park board. By the end of that decade, the site had been turned over to the Vancouver Park Board for park and recreation purposes. The park was dedicated by King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth (the mother of Queen Elizabeth II) during their visit to Vancouver in 1939, as King and Queen of Canada. From that time, Park staff incrementally transformed the overgrown hillsides into Canada's first civic arboretum, with a generous donation from the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. The popular quarry gardens were designed by Park Board Deputy Superintendent Bill Livingstone and were unveiled in the early 1960s.\nPrentice Bloedel's gift of $1.25 million funded the open reservoirs and built the country's first geodesic conservatory, which is surrounded by covered walkways, lighted fountains and a sculpture, Henry Moore's Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65. The Bloedel Floral Conservatory opened on December 6, 1969 amidst much jubilation. Its enclosed tropical garden houses 500 exotic plants and flowers and more than a hundred free-flying tropical birds.\nAttractions\nThere are several other attractions in the park including:\n* Arboretum\n* Celebration Pavilion\n* Bloedel Floral Conservatory\n* Fountains/Plaza\n* Quarry Gardens\n* Painters' Corner\n* Sculpture\nSeveral episodes of the long running TV show Stargate SG-1 were filmed there.\nActivities\nActivities at Queen Elizabeth Park include:\n* Pitch and putt golf course\n* Little Mountain disc golf course\n* Tennis courts\n* Lawn bowling club\n* Tai Chi\n* Jogging\nSee also\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqLFPcHUUwM 1939 film footage of the park]"
