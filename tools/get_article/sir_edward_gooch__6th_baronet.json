He first married Louisa Anna Maria Prescott, daughter of Sir George Beeston Prescott, 2nd Baronet, in 1828, and they had at least two children: Florence Jane Charlotte Giva Gooch (died 1918) and Louisa Catherine Gooch (died 1848).\nAfter Louisa's death in 1837, in 1839 he married Harriet Hope-Vere, daughter of James Joseph Hope-Vere and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Hay. They had nine children: Elizabeth Gooch; Diana Anne Gooch (died 1928); Harriet Sophia Gooch (died 1927); Charlotte Matilda Gooch; Isabel Edith Gooch (died 1931); Edward Sherlock Gooch (1843–1872); Francis Robert Sherlock Lambert Gooch (1850–1881); Alfred Sherlock Gooch (1851–1899); and another unknown son, born between 1844 and 1849.\nGooch was elected MP for East Suffolk at a by-election in 1846—caused by the resignation of John Henniker-Major—and held the seat until his death in 1856.\nHe succeeded to the Baronetcy of Benacre Hall upon the death of his father, Sir Thomas Gooch, 5th Baronet. Upon his own death in 1856, his son Sir Edward Sherlock Gooch, 7th Baronet succeeded to the peerage.}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
