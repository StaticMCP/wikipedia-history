The project was completed in December 2001. Annual electricity production is more than 750&nbsp;GW·h. The wind farm is owned by FPL Energy and the customers for the electricity generated are Reliant Energy (198.9&nbsp;MW), Austin Energy (76.7&nbsp;MW) and Texas-New Mexico Power Company (2.6&nbsp;MW).\nDust, sand and high temperatures place extraordinary demands on the wind turbines. Consequently, the design was modified for the desert-like conditions, providing additional cooling and protection against wind-blown sand.\nSee also\n}}\n*Wind power in the United States\n*Wind power in Texas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.res-group.com/en/portfolio/united-states/king-mountain-wind/ Renewable Energy Systems]{}"
