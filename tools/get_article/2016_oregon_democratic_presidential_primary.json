Massive grassroots support across the state helped the progressive and populist candidate achieve a double-digit win in a state with a closed primary. Sanders swept all counties in the state but one. He won a large victory in populous Portland in Multnomah County, where the bulk of the vote came from. He also was buoyed by support from the capital city of Salem in Marion County. Sanders swept all of the other major cities as well, including Eugene, Bend, and Medford, and likewise performed strongly in most of the rural and remote counties of the state, including those of Central Oregon and in the Oregon high desert bordering Idaho from the west. Sanders performed well in areas that were diverse in ethnicity as well as those which were less diverse. In fact, some of his largest margins of victory came from areas with a greater ethnic diversity in the state, such as Portland or Hillsboro, Oregon.\nClinton only won one county, Gilliam County, by one vote.\nSee also\n* 2016 Oregon Republican presidential primary\nReferences"
