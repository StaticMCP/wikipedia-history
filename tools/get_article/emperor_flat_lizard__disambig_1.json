The middle stripe is narrow and broken near the rear, and the tail is straw-colored. The throat is white, while the belly is mainly black.\nAdult males have a yellow head and a dark red body with several large, whitish spots anteriorly. These pale spots are yellowish near the tail. The limbs are black, while the throat is dark red with a thick black collar. The chest is reddish or yellowish while the tail is orange to light yellow below. Like the females and juveniles, the belly is black.\nThis Platysaurus is the largest of its kind, with males reaching 146&nbsp;mm. The common flat lizard, Platysaurus intermedius, is closely related, but the emperor flat lizard is easily distinguishable by its large size and striking colors.\nGeography\nThe emperor flat lizard's range is northeastern Zimbabwe and the adjacent part of Mozambique. Its habitat is mesic savanna. These lizards will often live on top of boulders on hills.\nHabits\nA large male emperor flat lizard and several attendant females command the tops of huge boulders on hills, where they feed on beetles, grubs, and ants. Emperor flat lizards have been documented living up to fourteen years.\nBreeding\nClutches of two eggs are laid in the summer. These eggs are large, with dimensions of 27&nbsp;mm long by 12&nbsp;mm wide.\nConservation\nEmperor flat lizards are threatened by over-collecting for the pet trade.\nSee also\n*Platysaurus\n*Cordylidae\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tallbo.com/platysaurus/p_imperator.htm More Information]"
