      "text": "# Newfoundland and Labrador Book Awards\n\nThe Newfoundland and Labrador Book Awards were established in 1997 by the Writer's Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador (WANL), Canada. The awards are administered in partnership with the Literary Arts Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador. The categories for the awards alternate on a bi-yearly basis, with fiction and children's/young adult literature being featured one year, and poetry and non-fiction being featured the next.  The winner of each category receives a $1,500 prize. Two runners-up in each category are also selected and receive a $500 prize.\nGuidelines\nThe awards are open to residents of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. For the administration of these awards, WANL defines residents as individuals who meet one of two conditions. The first condition is that they have lived in the province for 12 months immediately prior to the release of publication of their written piece. The second is that they have lived in the province for at least 36 out of the previous 60 months, with no requirement for those months to be consecutive. An award can also be won posthumously if one of the residency conditions were met. To be eligible, a book must be in English and authored by a single individual. Translated books, as well as those that are self-published, are eligible.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Winner (Poetry)\n!Winner (Non-Fiction)\n!Winner (Children's/YA)\n!Winner (Fiction)\n|-\n|1997\n|Arguments with Gravity by Michael Crummey\n|Bread and Roses by Dorothy Inglis\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|1998\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|Dream Carvers by Joan Clark\n|Gaff Topsails by Patrick Kavanagh\n|-\n|1999\n|That Night We Were Ravenous by John Steffler\n|They Let Down Baskets by Berni Stapleton\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|2000\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|Make or Break Spring by Janet McNaughton\n|Stranger Things Have Happened by Carmelita McGrath\n|-\n|2001\n|Thirty-for-Sixty by Al Pittman\n|A Personal Calligraphy by Mary Pratt and Old Newfoundland: A History to 1843 by Patrick O'Flaherty\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|2002\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|The Secret Under My Skin by Janet McNaughton\n|The Confessions of Nipper Mooney by Ed Kavanagh\n|-\n|2003\n|Helix: New and Selected Poems by John Steffler\n|From the Ashes of My Dream by Ed Smith\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|2004\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|An Earthly Knight by Janet McNaughton\n|In the Chambers of the Sea by Susan Rendell\n|-\n|2005\n|Merrybegot by Mary Dalton\n|Aprocrypha: Further Journeys by Stan Dragland\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|2006\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|Brave Jack and the Unicorn by Janet McNaughton\n|An Audience of Chairs by Joan Clark\n|-\n|2007\n|There, there by Patrick Warner\n|Vikings to U-Boats: The German Experience in Newfoundland and Labrador by Gerhard P.
