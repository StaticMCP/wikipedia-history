They were a major event in the UK athletics calendar. Unlike the AAA Championships, which were usually open to overseas athletes, the UK championships were only open to competitors from the United Kingdom. In 1980, the event incorporated the British trials for the Olympic Games.\nThe event was hosted at Scotstoun Stadium in Glasgow, Scotland.\nMedal summary\n{|\n|-\n|3000m steeplechase\n| Tara Krzywicki\n|9:55.01\n|Allison Higgins\n|10:55.70\n|Paula Gowing\n|11:26.15\n|}\nReferences"
