Born at Little Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, Daniell was educated at Christ Church, Oxford.\nDaniell's batting style is unknown. While studying at the University of Oxford, he made his debut in first-class cricket in 1835 for Oxford University against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at the Magdalen Ground, Oxford. He made a further first-class appearance in that season for the university in the return fixture between the sides at Lord's. In that same season he made a first-class appearance for England against Kent, before making a final appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against the MCC in 1837. In four first-class matches, Daniell scored 32 runs at an average of 6.40, with a high score of 15.\nHe died at the village of his birth on 6 July 1985.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/12342.html Edward Daniell] at ESPNcricinfo\n*[https://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/36/36643/36643.html Edward Daniell] at CricketArchive"
