Eight Cossack regiments and up to 2,000 Japanese soldiers took part in the operation. The partisans had not anticipated such an offensive and were encircled near Bogdat and Homyaki villages in a day and thereafter the blockade was tightened.\nBogdat was home to the headquarters of the Eastern Transbaikalian Front headed by Pavel Zhuravlev. From September 29 to October 19 the partisans made frantic attempts to break through the encirclement. Finally, two thirds of the units managed to avoid capture and escaped.\nReferences\nSources\n* Шишкин С. И. Гражданская война на Д. Вост. — М., 1957;\n* Шерешевский Б. М.
