It was a live music venue for a few years before 1929, when it became a cinema. Around 1940 it had a dual role and by 1950 it was hosting various kinds of stage shows, increasingly musicals, and was finally destroyed by fire in the early 1960s.\nHistory\n| zoom = 16\n| width = 215\n| height = 215\n| shape1=n-circle\n| shape-color1=red\n| shape-outline1=white\n| mark-coord1 =\n| mark-title1 = Empire Theatre\n| caption = Railway Square, Haymarket\n| auto-caption=1\n}}\n.

The site was a  block on the Bijou Lane corner of Quay Street (\"Saunders' Corner\"), Railway Square, near the side entrance to Central Station.\nIt opened on 1 May 1927 with the new Jerome Kern musical Sunny, followed by The Student Prince.\nBy this time stage musicals as public entertainment had been largely usurped by \"talkies\" and the theatre was reconfigured as a talking picture house around June 1929. It was one of the few Sydney cinemas independent of the General Theatres Corporation / Fullers' Theatres combination, so showing few \"first release\" films, until management signed up with RKO, and with Paramount Pictures, who already had an arrangement with Prince Edward Theatre.\nDuring World War II, the Empire again hosted live performances, mounted by the A.I.F. Entertainment Unit interspersed with regular movie programmes.\nFrom 1950 the Empire was used by \"The Firm\" of  J.&nbsp;C. Williamson's for minor attractions: \"The Great Franquin\" (a stage hypnotist), a season of Gilbert and Sullivan favorites, — and ballet performances, hosting a three-week season of the National Ballet Company of Melbourne, which included the world premiere of Corroboree, with its composer John Antill conducting the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Other ballet companies followed, culminating in the Borovansky Ballet in 1952.\nIn 1953 \"The Firm\" announced a major refit and facelift for the old theatre, leading to calls (around the time of the Coronation of Elizabeth II) for it to be renamed \"Her Majesty's Theatre\". The suggestion was taken up much later, when the musical My Fair Lady was being staged there.\nThe building was destroyed by fire in the early 1960s.\nReferences"
