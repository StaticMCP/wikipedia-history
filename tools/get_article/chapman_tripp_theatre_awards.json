The presentations also recognised important contributions to the arts and the community. The winners were selected by a panel of Wellington theatre critics. In 2014 Chapman Tripp ended their 22 year sponsorship due to a shift in their corporate social responsibility programme.\nThe main theatres in Wellington such as BATS Theatre, Circa Theatre, and Downstage Theatre each had an individual Production of the Year award for their best production during the year.\nNotable winners\nWinners at the Chapman Tripp Theatre Awards include the most acclaimed names in New Zealand theatre. Such names include directors such as multiple winner Colin McColl (Laureate Award, Arts Foundation of New Zealand 2007), Miranda Harcourt, Susan Wilson, Nathaniel Lees, Cathy Downes, Ross Jolly and Rachel Teaomarama House.\nBest Actress winners include Jennifer Ludlam, Katherine McRae, Carmel McGlone, Grace Hoet and Madeleine Sami.\nBest Actor winners include Ray Henwood, Tim Balme, Grant Tilly, Dave Fane and Peter Hambleton. In 2006, acclaimed Maori actor George Henare (NZ Laureate Award, Arts Foundation of New Zealand 2008) received a Chapman Tripp Best Actor Award for his portrayal of Willy Loman in Circa Theatre's Death of a Salesman.\nPlaywrights include David Geary, Briar Grace-Smith, Hone Kouka, Hori Ahipene and Kirk Torrance.\n1992 awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
