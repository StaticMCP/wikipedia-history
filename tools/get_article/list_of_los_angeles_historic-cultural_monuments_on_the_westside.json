In total, there are more than 85 Historic-Cultural Monuments (HCM) on the Westside, and a handful of additional sites that have been recognized by the Cultural Heritage Commission for having been designated as California Historical Landmarks or having been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are designated by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission.\nOverview of the Westside's Historic-Cultural Monuments\nAs a more recently developed section of the city, the Westside initially lagged behind other parts of the city in the designation of HCMs.  In the first 20 years of the Cultural Heritage Commission's existence (August 1962 - August 1982), only three buildings (and three trees or groups of trees) on the Westside were designated as Historic-Cultural Monuments.  The three buildings so designated are: (1) Rocha House -- (2) Hangar No. 1 -- the first building constructed at the airfield that later became LAX; and (3) the Ivy Park Substation, an electric generating station for the Pacific Electric Railway located on Venice Boulevard in Palms.  Although the city's Westside became a center of wealth and architectural innovation in the mid-20th century, it was not until the 1980s that large numbers of buildings on the Westside began to be recognized as Historic-Cultural Monuments.\nListing of the Historic-Cultural Monuments\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!  width=1% | HCM #\n!  width=\"18%\" |Landmark name\n! class=\"unsortable\"  width=\"11%\" |Image\n!  width=\"4%\"  |Date designated\n!  width=\"12%\" |Locality\n!  width=\"12%\" |Neighborhood\n!  width=\"41%\" |Description\n|-\n| |13\n| Rocha House\n|\n|\n| 2400 Shenandoah St.\n| South Robertson\n| Residence built in 1865 by Antonio Jose Rocha II on the Rancho Rincon de los Bueyes\n|-\n|  |19\n| Moreton Bay Fig Tree\n| 100x100px\n|\n| 11000 National Blvd.\n| Palms\n| Australian fig tree planted in 1875 (See also Santa Barbara's Moreton Bay Fig Tree)\n|-\n|  |38\n| Site of Founders Oak\n|\n|\n| Haverford Ave. between Sunset Blvd. and Antioch St.\n| Pacific Palisades\n| Coast live oak that played a significant role in founding of Pacific Palisades; cut down in 1975 due to termite infestation\n|-\n|  |44(2378)\n| Hangar No. 1 Building\n|\n|\n| 5701 W.
