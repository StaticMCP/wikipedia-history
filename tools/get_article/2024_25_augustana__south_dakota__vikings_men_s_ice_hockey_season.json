The Vikings represented Augustana University, played their home games at Midco Arena and were coached by Garrett Raboin in his 2nd season.\nSeason\nIn the off-season, the CCHA announced that the timeline for Augustana was being moved up. Rather than become a full conference member in 2025–26, the Vikings would be eligible for the conference tournament in 2024–25. As schedules had already been set before the announcement, the CCHA would use point percentage to determine Augustana's place in the standings. With that decided, Augustana entered its second season of varsity ice hockey.\nFrom the very beginning, the Vikings were exceeding expectations. Picked to finish 6th in the preseason poll, the team got a sizable boost from the vastly improved play of Josh Kotai. The Sophomore netminder recorded his first two career shutouts in the first two weeks of the season. At the same time, the team also earned its first ever weekend sweep of a ranked team when they shut down Omaha and climbed into the top 10 of the PairWise rankings, albeit temporarily. After a bit of a lull to end the month, Augustana's defense settled down and the team was able to post a winning record in the first half of the season.\nAt the beginning of January, the Vikings earned another surprising sweep when they took down Colorado College. The two wins over a top-10 opponent lifted the team up into the top 20 of the PairWise rankings and gave the club an outside chance to earn its way into the NCAA tournament. While Augustana didn't lose over the next three weeks, their weak opponents caused the Vikings' ranking to slip. However, when the team was set to face Minnesota State for a battle of conference supremacy, they had not only climbed back into the top 20 but they were also appearing in the national polls themselves. The series against the Mavericks could have propelled Augustana towards an at-large bid, however, the Vikings were unable to get their offense on track and scored just one goal in each match (both losses). Due primarily to their weak schedule, the team had very little chance for an appearance on merit afterwards. What little chance they had evaporated in the final weekend of the year when they were swept by Alaska and dropped into the bottom half of the PairWise.\nWith their last remaining chance at the postseason being a conference championship, Augustana was at least able to rely on their 2nd-place finish to get favorable seeding in the quarterfinals. The Vikings opened with a comfortable win over Bemidji State but the Beavers fought back to capture the second game. The deciding match saw both teams take a 1-goal lead, however, by the end of regulation the score remained tied and Augustana found itself it the program's first elimination game. It didn't take long as just over 4 minutes into overtime, Kotai was beat by a quick shot from the wall and the Vikings' season was suddenly over.\nDepartures\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=1100\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Chase Brand || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Reading Royals)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Shay Donovan || Forward ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Jack Jensen || Forward ||  || Signed professional contract (Idaho Steelheads)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Ryan Naumovski || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Kalamazoo Wings)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Ethan Perrault || Defenseman ||  || Transferred to Buffalo State\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Zack Rose || Goaltender ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Anthony Stark || Defenseman ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Arnaud Vachon || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Greenville Swamp Rabbits)\n|}\nRecruiting\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=1100\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Owen Baumgartner || Defenseman ||  || 22 || Owatonna, MN; transfer from Air Force\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Joey DelGreco || Forward ||  || 20 || Grand Rapids, MN\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Garett Drotts || Forward ||  || 20 || Grand Rapids, MN\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Tyler Hennen || Forward ||  || 20 || Hallock, MN\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Nace Langus || Forward ||  || 19 || Jesenice, SLO\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Christian Manz || Goaltender ||  || 20 || Blaine, MN\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Payton Matsui || Forward ||  || 24 || Lakeville, MN; transfer from Alaska\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Carter Theissen || Defenseman ||  || 21 || Plymouth, MN\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Easton Young || Defenseman ||  || 21 || Grand Rapids, MN\n|}\nRoster\nAs of July 30, 2024.\nStandings\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" |\n}}\nScoring statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width =\"50%\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n]]}}\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||35 ||10 ||13 ||23 ||14\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||35 ||7 ||16 ||23 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||34 ||8 ||13 ||21 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||34 ||13 ||7 ||20 ||14\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||32 ||7 ||10 ||17 ||6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || C ||29 ||6 ||10 ||16 ||8\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || RW ||32 ||5 ||11 ||16 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||35 ||7 ||8 ||15 ||20\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||34 ||3 ||12 ||15 ||29\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||28 ||6 ||7 ||13 ||21\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||33 ||3 ||10 ||13 ||25\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||23 ||6 ||6 ||12 ||8\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||21 ||2 ||9 ||11 ||21\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||35 ||1 ||10 ||11 ||24\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||32 ||6 ||3 ||9 ||27\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||24 ||2 ||6 ||8 ||12\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||33 ||1 ||7 ||8 ||8\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || LW ||20 ||1 ||6 ||7 ||8\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||35 ||0 ||4 ||4 ||16\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||18 ||1 ||2 ||3 ||6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||12 ||1 ||1 ||2 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||23 ||1 ||1 ||2 ||17\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || G ||31 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||6 ||0 ||0 ||0 ||0\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||22 ||0 ||0 ||0 ||6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || G ||5 ||0 ||0 ||0 ||0\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Bench ||– ||– ||– ||– ||– ||6\n|-\n!
