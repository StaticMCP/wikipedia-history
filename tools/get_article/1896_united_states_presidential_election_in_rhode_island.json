Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nRhode Island voted for the Republican nominee, former governor of Ohio William McKinley, over the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Representative from Nebraska William Jennings Bryan. McKinley won the state by a wide margin of 41.94%.\nBryan, running on a platform of free silver, appealed strongly to Western miners and farmers in the 1896 election, but had little appeal in Northeastern states like Rhode Island.\nWith 68.33% of the popular vote, Rhode Island would be McKinley's fourth strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after Vermont, neighboring Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nBryan would lose Rhode Island to McKinley again four years later and would later lose the state again in 1908 to William Howard Taft.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Rhode Island\nReferences"
