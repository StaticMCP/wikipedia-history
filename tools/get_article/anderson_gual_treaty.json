It is the first bilateral treaty that the United States concluded with another American country.\nThe treaty was concluded in Bogotá on 3 October 1824 and signed by U.S. diplomat Richard Clough Anderson and by Gran Colombian minister Pedro Gual Escandón. It was ratified by both countries and entered into force in May 1825.\nThe commercial provisions of the treaty granted reciprocal most-favored-nation status.\nThe treaty contained a clause that stated it would be in force for 12 years after ratification by both parties; the treaty therefore expired in 1837.\nSee also\n*United States–Central America Treaty\nReferences\n*Michael L.
