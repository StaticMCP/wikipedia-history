His son Shady Mousa is a keyboardist, and his daughter, Nagham Adwar Mousa, is also a singer. Mousa is famed for writing a dozen notable songs in the late 1980s and early 1990s for prolific and popular Assyrian singers such as Sargon Gabriel, Ashur Bet Sargis, Janan Sawa, Linda George and Juliana Jendo, among others.\nLegacy\nAdwar Mousa's dance songs \"Narineh\" and \"Wye Wye Minakh\", which were written for Sargon Gabriel, still remain widely covered and played in today's Assyrian weddings and jubilant parties. They are in the rhythm of bagiyeh and sheikhani, respectively, thus making them popular choices for dancing.\nHis other folk dance songs, such as \"Hoy Jano\", \"Hatkha O Atkha\", \"Kewat Ya Shimshi\" and \"Barowen\", are also immensely covered in Assyrian parties, which have gained popularity since the early 2010s, despite the fact that they were composed in the early 1990s. At over 2.1 million hits, \"Kha Yoma Kheshli Khlola\", written by Mousa and sung by Bassam Slivo, is one of the most-viewed Assyrian songs on YouTube.\nDiscography\n* Rwily (1998)\n* En Tali (1999)\n* Edward Mousa Live (2002)\nWriting credits\nAshur Bet Sargis\n* Loosh Ane Jooleh Sodaneh (1990)\nJanan Sawa\n* Min Poomakh, Min Poomy (1988)\n* Shooshan (1988)\nJuliana Jendo\n* Derdee (1990)\n* Khlola (1990)\n* Sogul (1990)\n* Tlibee (1990)\nLinda George\n* Aynet Nooneh (1992)\nSargon Gabriel\n* Wy Wy Minnakh (1987)\n* ''Siqly Al Resha d'Toora (1992)\n* Maney E Dzemra (1992)\n* Bessa Sapar (1992)\n* Nareeneh (1992)\n* Rikidla Mya Meeney (1992)\n* Matenee (1994)\n* Yasmin (1994)\nShabeh Lawando\n* Emin Dayer Azizi (1986)\n* Slalee Al Karmanee (1990)\n* Dashta (1990)\n* Komta O Khwara (1990)\n* Mbarkhula (1990)\n* Sogul (1990)\n* Saimon Moghdalee (1990)\n* Sayda (1991)\n* Sheshen Gulpani (1991)\n* Mkhee Pokha (1991)\n* Moomee (1992)\n* Matwate d-Ninweh (1992)\n* Hoy Jano (1993)\n* Dilan (1993)\n* Kma Bayinakh (1993)\n* Tre Warden (1993)\n* Sayraneh (1995)\n* Saparchiwin (1995)\n* Lo Athra'' (1995)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100012821923227&hc_ref=ARQU9p9n3KKr4sb6Ex_EG2zg1-e-l32kknLV5KjnBLo5EjoBB25qaT3F8x_K0w9zFRE Facebook]"
