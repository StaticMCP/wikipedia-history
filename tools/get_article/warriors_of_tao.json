Chosen to fight on behalf of the Earth in an interplanetary tournament, Toma realizes that the loser will end up as dead meat - literally. According to the universal plan, there will be \"Feeders\" and there will be \"Food\", with the beings of one world feeding on the blood and meat of the others. Only one planet can survive... who will be on the menu?\nCharacters\n*Toma Suguri - An average High School student. He's not one of the brightest students at his school, but he finds out that he's talented in other things like Kendo Training. He stumbles upon Itsuki Aizawa in an empty classroom one day (She is found nude under a desk), which starts a chain reaction, leading to Toma being thrown into a universe called \"Tao\".\n*Itsuki Aizawa -\nReception\nThe series received mostly negative reviews. Jason Thompson in the book Manga: The Complete Guide said it \"quickly becomes really disgusting\" and \"ends abruptly\". He concluded: \"Weepy subplots amid the gore drag the rating even lower, although like Arm of Kannon, it's a worthy read for anyone who likes a good gross-out\". Liann Cooper of Anime News Network wrote, \"I didn't think it was possible, but I think I may have found a manga bad enough to be the companion to ''Evil's Return''. Yes, folks... it's that bad.\" ''Evil's Return'' is a manhwa, whose Cooper's review stated: \"I'm desperately trying to find something... ANYTHING good to say about ''Evil's Return'', but I can't.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tokyopop.com/S-1241/ Official we page on Tokyopop's web site]"
