This year, the film with the most nominations was Batman & Robin with 11, followed by Speed 2: Cruise Control with eight nominations, Anaconda with six nominations, The Postman with five nominations and Fire Down Below with four nominations. The film winning the most awards was The Postman, with all five categories for which it was nominated.\nBrian Helgeland, co-screenwriter of the Razzie-winning The Postman, also received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for L.A. Confidential in 1998. Helgeland became the second person, after composer Alan Menken in 1993, to receive a Razzie and Oscar in the same year, a feat not repeated until actress Sandra Bullock in 2010.\nAwards and nominations\nFile:Kevin Costner 2016.jpg|Kevin Costner, Worst Picture, Worst Director and Worst Actor winner.\nFile:Demi Moore (cropped).jpg|Demi Moore, Worst Actress winner.\nFile:Dennis Rodman 02 (34649289162) (cropped).jpg|Dennis Rodman, Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star winner, Worst Screen Couple co-winner.\nFile:Alicia Silverstone 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|Alicia Silverstone, Worst Supporting Actress winner.\nFile:Jean-Claude Van Damme 2012.jpg|Jean-Claude Van Damme, Worst Screen Couple co-winner.\nFile:Brian Helgeland (P040213CK-0212) (cropped).jpg|Brian Helgeland, Worst Screenplay co-winner.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!
