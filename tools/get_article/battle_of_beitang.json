It was necessary to capture Beitang for organising railway connection between Tianjin and Manchuria.\nDuring the night, Russian troops captured a Chinese position near the destroyed Beitang railway station, and built several batteries. In the morning, Russian and German cannons began to bombard the fortress, and at 10 a.m. the Chinese garrison fled. At noon, the fortress was captured without fighting.\nNotes\nSources\n*Д.Г.Янчевецкий \"У стен недвижного Китая\".
