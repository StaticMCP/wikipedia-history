CNRD-UBWIYUNGE was formed on May 31, 2016, by members of the Rwandan refugee community in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with the objective to organize for the return in peace and dignity. A split in the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) resulted in the creation of the new movement, led by Col. Wilson IRATEGEKA.\nReferences"
