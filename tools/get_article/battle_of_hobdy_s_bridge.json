A detachment of Union soldiers led by Lt. Joseph Carroll left Montgomery, Alabama on May 11, 1865, and reached Eufaula, Alabama without difficulty.  Since some of the men in the detachment were natives of the area, Carroll granted them short leaves so that they could visit their families. The entire detachment was to reassemble at Hobdy's Bridge over the Pea River on May 19, 1865. Later, Carroll learned that pro-Confederate \"guerrillas\" had been seen in the area at about the same time General Alexander Asboth in Pensacola reported that several companies of cavalry made up of \"unrepentant rebels\" were still active in the Alabama and Florida borderlands. Upon learning this, Carroll decided that he needed to return to Montgomery as quickly as possible and crossed Hobdy's Bridge with the main body of his detachment on May 15, 1865, two days before the appointed rendezvous. The other men of Carroll's command, at home and visiting their families, had no way of knowing his decision to leave early.\nBattle\nAccording to military records, the men gathered at Hobdy's Bridge as ordered on the morning of May 19, 1865, only to learn that Carroll and the main part of the detachment were already gone. Turning their horses onto the long wooden bridge, the Florida cavalrymen of C and F companies of the 1st Florida Cavalry Regiment started off to follow their commander's route back to Montgomery, unknowingly riding straight into a trap. A Confederate detachment from the 53rd Alabama Cavalry Regiment ambushed the Union soldiers on the bridge.\nAftermath and Legacy\n\"Last battle of the Civil War\"\nAlthough some historians say that the Battle of Palmito Ranch was the last land action fought between the North and the South, others suggest that the Battle of Hobdy's Bridge was the last battle between Union and Confederate forces. Union records show that the last Northern soldier killed in combat during the war was Corporal John W. Skinner in this action. The Bureau of Pensions determined Corporal John Skinner had been killed in action. Three other Union soldier were also wounded. They were identified as William Smith and Nathan Mims of Company F and Daniel V. Melvin from Company C, all companies from the 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry.\nAmerican historian and Eufaula local Bob McLendon said about the battle, \"There was two fights over around Hobdy’s Bridge and one of them was the last fight of the war. The last fight of the entire Civil War was also right here in Pike County near Hobdy’s Bridge. So, really it ended two wars. If you want to end a war, go to Hobdy’s Bridge, I guess.\"\nReferences"
