Always local to Northampton, Packman followed in the footsteps of his father, Frank, who played for Saints 376 times between 1982 and 1996 and joined the Northampton club's academy.\nMaking his senior début for the club aged just 18-years old in 2013 against Gloucester Rugby, the winger has gone on to make seven first team appearances for the club.\nThe talented, young winger was soon noticed by the National selectors and progressed through the England age-group ranks and made his England U20 debut in 2014.\nSince then the winger has gone on to make 14 appearances in an England shirt at that level, including being a part of the victorious IRB Junior World Championship that beat Australia U20s in the final in New Zealand and helping the same side get to the final of the competition the following season where they fell to New Zealand Baby Blacks.\nThe U20s star also earned recognition in the England Sevens side when he was called into the squad to play in the 2014 Sevens World Series in both the Glasgow and London legs of the competition.\nPackman joined RFU Championship side Bedford Blues. In April 2018 he moved to\nEaling Trailfinders after scoring six tries for Bedford during the 2017–18 season.\nIn 2019 Packman travelled to the Southern Hemisphere to play for North Otago in New Zealand. He has started in sensational form, scoring four tries in five games to take the team to the top of the Heartland Championship.\nAfter a troubling couple of years slumming it with Tonbridge Juddians, Howard found himself back amongst the rugby elite as he signed a contract at Sevenoaks RFC to become their new Academy Head Coach. Exciting times lie ahead for this young man.\nReferences"
