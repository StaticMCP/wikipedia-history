The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns three councillors to Waltham Forest London Borough Council. The ward was subject to boundary revisions in 1978, 2002 and 2022. Miranda Grell was elected in 2006 and disqualified in 2007 for making false statements under the Representation of the People Act 1983, which triggered a by-election in 2008.\nLandmarks\nProminent landmarks are Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road ground and New Spitalfields Market.\nWaltham Forest council elections since 2022\nThere was a revision of ward boundaries in Waltham Forest in 2022.\n2022 election\nThe election took place on 5 May 2022.\n2002–2022 Waltham Forest council elections\n|frame=yes|text=Leyton ward boundaries from 2002 to 2022}}\nThere was a revision of ward boundaries in Waltham Forest in 2002.\n2018 election\nThe election took place on 3 May 2018.\n2014 election\nThe election took place on 22 May 2014.\n2010 election\nThe election on 6 May 2010 took place on the same day as the United Kingdom general election.\n2008 by-election\nThe by-election took place on 14 February 2008, following the disqualification of Miranda Grell.\n2006 election\nThe election took place on 4 May 2006.\n2002 election\nThe election took place on 2 May 2002.\n1978–2002 Waltham Forest council elections\n|frame=yes|text=Leyton ward boundaries from 1978 to 2002}}\nThere was a revision of ward boundaries in Waltham Forest in 1978.\n1998 election\nThe election took place on 7 May 1998.\n1994 election\nThe election took place on 5 May 1994.\n6.25}}\n2.72}}\n40}}\n1.60}}\n0.06}}\n1990 election\n1986 election\n1982 election\n1978 election\n1964–1978 Waltham Forest council elections\n1974 election\n1971 election\n1970 by-election\nThe by-election took place on 17 September 1970.\n1968 election\n1964 election\nNotes\nReferences"
