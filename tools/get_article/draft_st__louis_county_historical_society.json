Established in 1922, the society is one of the oldest and largest county historic preservation organizations in Minnesota. The society shares the Duluth Depot complex with other cultural organizations, including the Lake Superior Railroad Museum.\nHistory\nThe St. Louis County Historical Society was founded in 1922 by a group of local citizens interested in preserving the history of the county, which includes the iron mining industry, lumbering, shipping, and the diverse communities that settled the region. For many years, the society operated out of various locations.\nIn 1979, the society moved into its current home within the Duluth Depot, a former railroad station now known as the St. Louis County Heritage & Arts Center. This move provided the society with dedicated space for its collections, archives, and public programming.\nMission and Collections\nThe mission of the St. Louis County Historical Society is to collect, preserve, research, interpret, and disseminate the history of St. Louis County, Minnesota, and its people. The society also has six affiliate organizations in St. Louis County.\nThe society's many collections include artifacts representing various aspects of county history, from domestic life to industrial tools and civic memorabilia and a research library accessible to the public, containing books, periodicals, and genealogical resources relevant to St. Louis County. In early 2025, ownership of the St. Louis County Historical Society (SLCHS) archives was permanently transferred to Archives and Special Collections at the Kathryn A. Martin Library, University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD).\nExhibits and Programs\nThe SLCHS develops and maintains permanent and rotating exhibits within the Duluth Depot that explore various facets of St. Louis County's past, including Native American history, immigration, the growth of Duluth, the iron ranges, and the impact of the Great Lakes. It also operates the Veterans Memorial Hall.\nBeyond its exhibits, the society offers a variety of public programs, including:\n* Educational workshops and lectures\n* Traveling exhibits available for short or long-term loan\n* Exhibits featuring historical artifacts at each of the three St. Louis County Courthouses.\nThe society has also published historical materials related to the county.\nSee also\n* St. Louis County, Minnesota\n* Duluth Depot\n* List of museums in Minnesota\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.thehistorypeople.org Official Website]"
