It was formed in 2014 as a coalition between the Chicago Teachers Union, SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana, Grassroots Illinois Action, and Action Now. Although it is not a formal political party, the organization recruits and trains political candidates and organizers, endorses and provides support to political candidates, and engages in community organizing. Its stated goal is to \"create space for independent politics\" in Chicago and Illinois and to enact a \"vision for a city and a state that provides for the many, not just the wealthy few.\" The organization has been characterized as part of the progressive movement and the labor movement.\nElectoral politics\nMunicipal elections\n2015 Chicago municipal elections\nIn 2015, UWF backed the candidacy of Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia against incumbent mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Chuy García, who had received UWF's endorsement for Mayor in 2015, requested a delay in the endorsement process while he made his decision about whether to enter the race, but UWF proceeded with endorsing Johnson in September 2022, citing Garcia's unwillingness to provide a timeline for his decision.

The organization itself released a statement opposing the mayor's budget on the grounds that it lacked funding for affordable housing, failed to re-open closed mental health clinics, and did not contain sufficient progressive revenue measures. On November 26, eight of the nine UWF-endorsed aldermen voted against Lightfoot's budget proposal, which passed by a vote of 39–11.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, UWF worked with other community organizations and some local elected officials to create and endorse a \"Right to Recovery\" package at the city, county, and state levels. The package would include paid emergency leave, emergency housing for those unable to self-quarantine, a moratorium on Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins, and weekly payments of $750 to families with children and workers facing layoffs and furloughs.\nOn September 11, 2024, three City Council committee chairs and the president of the Fraternal Order of Police called for the firing of mayoral aide Kennedy Bartley, the former executive director of United Working Families, for using the term \"f---ing pigs\" to describe police and talking openly about defunding or abolishing the police.\nSee also\n* Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus\nNotes\nReferences"
