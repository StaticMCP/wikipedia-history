Carr Trophy in 1941 and 1942, becoming the first Packers player to win an MVP award.|alt=Black and white photo of Hutson catching a football]]\nThe Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers have competed in the National Football League (NFL) since 1921, two years after their original founding by Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun. They are members of the North Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) and play their home games at Lambeau Field in central Wisconsin. The Packers have won 13 championships (the most in NFL history), including nine NFL Championships prior to 1966 and four Super Bowls since then. They have captured 21 divisional titles, 9 conference championships, and been to the playoffs 36 times. In NFL history, the Packers  have recorded the most regular season victories (808) and the most overall victories (845) of any team, and are tied with the New England Patriots for the second most playoff wins (37).\nDating back to the early years of professional football, NFL players, coaches and executives have been given numerous awards recognizing their on-the-field and off-the-field accomplishments. These awards historically have been given out by the NFL itself, or by various news organizations, including the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), The Sporting News (SN), the Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA) and Pro Football Weekly (PFW), among others. They are typically given annually based on what happened during the preceding NFL season. In 1938, the NFL identified the most valuable player (MVP) of the preceding season by giving out the Joe F. Carr Trophy. Don Hutson became the first Packers player to receive this award, winning back-to-back in 1941 and 1942. Over the years, new awards have been created to recognize specific accomplishments. This includes player of the year (often identifying an offensive and defensive player of the year), rookie of the year and comeback player of the year. In addition to player awards, coaches, assistant coaches and executives have all had awards developed to identify their contributions to the success of a team. Although on-field performance awards are widely recognized, various organizations have also developed awards recognizing community service, outstanding character, sportsmanship and philanthropy. One such award, the Bart Starr Award, was named in honor of Packers' quarterback Bart Starr.\nTeam awards\nlocated at Lambeau Field|alt=Silver trophy in a rotunda]]\nThe Green Bay Packers won the NFL Championship in 1929, 1930 and 1931, although at the time no formal award or trophy was given out. Starting in 1936, the NFL gave the season's champion the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, which continued until 1967. The Packers received this award eight times: 1936, 1939, 1944, 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1967. They are the only team in NFL history to win the championship three straight seasons, having done so twice. After the AFL–NFL merger, the winner of the Super Bowl was given the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which was named after Green Bay's head coach Vince Lombardi. The Packers have won four Super Bowls, in 1966, 1967, 1996 and 2010. Since 1984, the winner of the NFC Championship game has been awarded the George Halas Trophy. The Packers have won this trophy three times: 1996, 1997 and 2010.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" |Award\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" |Accomplishment\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" |Seasons awarded\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|None\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|NFL champion (1920–32)\n|, ,\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|NFL champion (1933–67)\n|, , , , , , ,\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|George Halas Trophy\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|NFC champion (1984–present)\n|, ,\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|Vince Lombardi Trophy\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Super Bowl champion (1966–present)\n|, , ,\n|\n|-\n|}\nIndividual awards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n|+Awarding organizations\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| AP\n| Associated Press\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| KC 101\n| Kansas City Committee of 101 awards\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Maxwell\n| Maxwell Football Club\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| NEA\n| Newspaper Enterprise Association\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| NFL\n| National Football League\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| PFW\n| Pro Football Weekly\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| PFWA\n| Pro Football Writers of America\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| SN\n| The Sporting News\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| UPI\n| United Press International\n|}\nMost Valuable Player\nFrom 1938 to 1946, the NFL awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy to the most valuable player (MVP) in the NFL, as decided by a panel of sportswriters. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, various news organizations began handing out their own MVP awards, often based on the opinions or voting of their sportswriters. In 1948, UPI awarded their first MVP award: the UPI NFL MVP Award. In 1954, SN began awarding its NFL Player of the Year Award and the next year the NEA awarded their first MVP award, known as the Jim Thorpe Trophy. Three years later, the AP awarded their first NFL Most Valuable Player award, in 1957. Lastly, PFWA gave out their NFL MVP Award for the first time in 1966, although they did not name another MVP until 1975. The AP and PFWA have named MVPs each season since 1957 and 1975, respectively. SN named an MVP every year from 1954 to 1969, and then from 1980 to 2007. UPI stopped awarding their MVP award in 1969 and the last Jim Thorpe Trophy was awarded in 2008.\nSince 1941, six players for the Packers have won at least one of the aforementioned MVP awards, with 29 MVP awards going to these players. Don Hutson, who played wide receiver for the Packers in the 1930s and 1940s, won back-to-back Joe F. Carr Trophies during the 1941 and 1942 NFL seasons. Both seasons Hutson achieved the triple crown for receivers: he led the NFL in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. In addition to his role on offense, Hutson also recorded eight interceptions spanning both of his MVP seasons and was the team's placekicker. In 1961, Paul Hornung won his first and only MVP awards from the AP and the UPI after leading the NFL in points scored. In addition to his scoring record, Hornung rushed for 597 yards, had 145 receiving yards, completed three passes and kicked 15 field goals. The next season, Hornung's teammate Jim Taylor won four different MVP awards from the AP, SN, the NEA (the Jim Thorpe Trophy) and the PFWA. Taylor, similar to Hutson as a wide receiver, won the rushing triple crown; he led the league in rushing attempts, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in 1962. Four years later, Bart Starr, the Packers quarterback, won all five MVP awards that were awarded in the 1966 NFL season (AP, UPI, SN, the NEA and the PFWA). Starr led the NFL in a number of efficiency statistics, including completion percentage and quarterback rating. All three MVP awardees during the 1960s played under head coach Vince Lombardi; the Packers won the NFL Championship in all three seasons where they had an MVP awardee (1961, 1962 and 1966), which included the first Super Bowl.\nThe Packers during the 1970 and 1980s were unsuccessful on the playing field, with the team only going to the playoffs once each decade. However, in the 1990s the team traded for quarterback Brett Favre, who led the team back to perennial playoff contention. Starting in 1995, Favre won three consecutive AP MVP awards, becoming the first player to do so. He also won the MVP awards from PFWA and SN in 1995 and 1996, while also winning three straight Jim Thorpe Trophies from 1995 to 1997. During the 1996 season, Favre led the Packers to their first NFL Championship since 1967 with a victory in Super Bowl XXXI. From 1995 to 1997, Favre led the NFL in passing touchdowns and was near the top in most passing statistical categories. Favre and Barry Sanders shared the 1997 award from AP, only the second time this had occurred. Sanders had just completed the season with over 2,000 rushing yards, becoming only the third person to do so in one season, and had statistically one of the best seasons ever by a running back. Favre led the Packers to a second consecutive Super Bowl appearance that season, losing to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII. In 2007, Favre was traded to the New York Jets and his back-up quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, took over. Rodgers won his first AP and SN MVP awards in 2011, after guiding the Packers to a  regular season record while leading the NFL in most quarterback efficiency statistics, including setting the record for the highest quarterback rating in a season at 122.5. Rodgers went on to win the AP and SN MVP awards three more seasons, in 2014, 2020, and 2021.\n*Rodgers' passer rating in 2011 was 122.5 and in 2020 was 121.5; these are the first and second highest totals in NFL history.}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |Image\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=120px|Player\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=100px|Position\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=100px|Years with Packers\n!scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"6\"|MVP awards\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" |NFL\n!scope=\"col\" |AP\n!scope=\"col\" |UPI\n!scope=\"col\" |NEA\n!scope=\"col\" |SN\n!scope=\"col\" |PFWA\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Wide receiver\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Halfback\n|\n|—\n|\n|\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Fullback\n|\n|—\n|\n|—\n|\n|—\n|—\n|\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Quarterback\n|\n|—\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"rowspan=\"3\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"3\"|Quarterback\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|—\n|\n|—\n|\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|—\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"4\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"4\"|Quarterback\n|rowspan=\"4\"|\n|rowspan=\"4\"|—\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\"|—\n|rowspan=\"4\"|—\n|rowspan=\"4\"|—\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nPlayer of the Year\nNumerous organizations have awarded player of the year awards, including AP, UPI, SN, PFWA, NEA, Maxwell (called the Bert Bell Award) and the Kansas City Committee of 101 (KC 101). The award is typically given out to the top performer from the previous season. Each award is different, with some giving out two awards: one for an offensive player and one for a defensive player (this includes AP, UPI, SN, NEA and PFWA). Maxwell gives out the Bert Bell Award to just one player with no distinction. KC 101 gives out offensive and defensive awards to each conference, for a total of four winners each season. The UPI and NEA are now defunct, ending in 1996 and 1998, respectively. Starting in 2014, the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame also awards the Polynesian Football Player of the Year Award, although no Packers player has won that award.\nHornung won the first player of the year award for the Packers in 1961, from Maxwell. Hornung led the league in scoring and was a triple-threat man: he had almost 750 total yards, scored 10 total touchdowns, completed 3 passes and made 15 field goals. Hornung also won the MVP that year and was a first-team All-Pro. Tim Harris was the next winner of a player of the year award, doing so in 1989 from NEA. Harris, who was also first-team All-Pro that season, was second in the NFL with 19.5 sacks. 1995 saw two Packers win multiple player of the year awards: Brett Favre won awards from Maxwell, AP, PFWA and UPI, while Reggie White won awards from UPI and KC 101. Favre led the NFL in both passing yards and passing touchdowns, while also securing an MVP award and first-team All-Pro honors. White, who was also first-team All-Pro, was tied for 6th place in sacks in 1995. Favre continued his success into 1996, where he secured player of the year awards from Maxwell, PFWA and UPI. Favre again led the league in passing touchdowns while leading the Packers to their first Super Bowl victory since Super Bowl II. In 1998, White won player of the year awards with the Packers again, this time from NEA, AP, PFWA and KC 101. He was second in the NFL with 16 sacks that season. Charles Woodson and Clay Matthews III won back-to-back player of the year awards for the Packers in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Woodson, who won awards from AP, PFWA, UPI and KC 101, was tied for first place in the NFL with nine interceptions, including three returned for a touchdown. Matthews, who won awards from AP, UPI and KC 101, was fourth in the NFL in 2010 in sacks with 13.5, while also returning 1 interception for a touchdown. Aaron Rodgers won player of the year awards twice for the Packers, in 2011 (from Maxwell, PFWA and SN) and 2014 (SN). Both seasons Rodgers also won MVP awards and was first-team All-Pro. In 2011, Rodgers set an NFL record with a 122.5 quarterback rating, while also being in the top 5 of numerous passing statistics. In 2014, Rodgers had another season of being in the top 10 for most passing statistics, including passing yards, touchdowns and quarterback rating.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |Image\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=120px|Player\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=100px|Position\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=100px|Years with Packers\n!scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"7\"|Player of the year awards\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" |Maxwell\n!scope=\"col\" |NEA & )}}\n!scope=\"col\" |AP & )}}\n!scope=\"col\" |PFWA & )}}\n!scope=\"col\" |UPI( & )\n!scope=\"col\" |KC 101 & )}}\n!scope=\"col\" |SN( & )\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Halfback\n|\n|\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Linebacker\n|\n|—\n|\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Defensive end\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|—\n|—\n|—\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|—\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Quarterback\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|—\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Defensive back\n|\n|—\n|—\n|\n|\n|—\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Linebacker\n|\n|—\n|—\n|\n|—\n|—\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Quarterback\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|rowspan=\"2\"|—\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|—\n|—\n|\n|-\n|}\nRookie of the Year\nThe NFL Rookie of the Year award is given annually to the top performing rookies from the previous season. Rookie of the year awards have been given out by UPI (starting in 1955), AP (starting in 1967), SN (starting in 1955), the NEA (starting in 1964), the PFWA (starting in 1969) and by Pepsi (starting in 2002). UPI and NEA stopped handing out their awards in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Each organization awarded varying types of awards, with some giving out individual awards to rookies from each conference, while others awarded offensive and defensive awards. Boyd Dowler was the first Packers player to win a rookie of the year award, doing so in 1959 from UPI. He was in the top 20 of all receivers in receptions, yards and receiving touchdowns that season. John Brockington was second in the NFL in rushing yards with 1,105 in 1971, earning him rookie of the year awards from UPI, AP, SN and NEA. The next season, Willie Buchanon won the AP and NEA awards, while Chester Marcol won the SN award. Buchanon had four interceptions during his rookie year, while Marcol led the league in field goal attempts and field goals made. In 1984, Tom Flynn won the PFWA Rookie of the Year Award after recording nine interceptions, the second most in the NFL that season. Eddie Lacy won three rookie of the year awards in 2013, from the AP, SN and PFWA. Lacy rushed for 1,178 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns, both in the top 10 that season. No Packers player has won the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year.\n*2003: Domanick Davis\n*2004: Ben Roethlisberger\n*2005: Cadillac Williams\n*2006: Vince Young\n*2007: Adrian Peterson\n*2008: Joe Flacco\n*2009: Percy Harvin\n*2010: Ndamukong Suh\n*2011: Cam Newton\n*2012: Russell Wilson\n*2013: Keenan Allen\n*2014: Teddy Bridgewater\n*2015: Jameis Winston\n*2016: Dak Prescott\n*2017: Alvin Kamara\n*2018: Saquon Barkley\n*2019: Nick Bosa\n*2020: Justin Herbert\n*2021: Ja'Marr Chase\n*2022: Aidan Hutchinson\n*2023: C.

Since 1962, four organizations have given out comeback player of the year awards: the AP from 1963 to 1966, and then 1998 to the present; the PFWA from 1972 to the present; UPI in 1962, 1963 and 1969; and SN from 2008 to present. Since their inception, two Packers players have won comeback player of the year awards: Robert Brooks in 1997 and Jordy Nelson in 2016. Both Brooks and Nelson won their awards after injuries to their knees in 1996 and 2015, respectively. Brooks received his award from PFWA, while Nelson received awards from PFWA, AP and SN.\n*1963: Ed Brown\n*1969: Gale Sayers}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |Image\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=120px|Player\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=100px|Position\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=100px|Years with Packers\n!scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"3\" |Comeback player of the year awards\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" |PFW/PFWA\n!scope=\"col\" |AP\n!scope=\"col\" |SN\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" |Wide receiver\n|\n|\n|—\n|—\n|\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Wide receiver\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nSuper Bowl MVP\nThe Super Bowl MVP Award is given out by the NFL to the best player in each Super Bowl. Three Packers players have won the award: Starr twice in the first two Super Bowls (I and II), Desmond Howard in Super Bowl XXXI and Rodgers in Super Bowl XLV. Starting in 2001, the awardee is selected near the end of the game by electronic fan voting, which makes up 20% of the vote tally, while the remaining 80% is chosen by a panel of sportswriters selected by the NFL. Prior to 1990, the award was sponsored by Sport magazine, who gave away a new car to the winner. After the 1990 season with Super Bowl XXV, the NFL awarded the Super Bowl MVP with the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after the former commissioner of the NFL of the same name. Starr and Rodgers were given the award based on their exceptional passing during their respective Super Bowls. Howard became the first special teams player to win the Super Bowl MVP. Despite quarterback Brett Favre throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for another during Super Bowl XXXI, Howard was given the MVP after setting then-records for the longest kick-off return (a 99-yard kick-off return for a touchdown) and most total return yards (244) in a Super Bowl.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!scope=\"col\" width=120px|Player\n!scope=\"col\" width=100px|Position\n!scope=\"col\" width=100px|Years with Packers\n!scope=\"col\" |Super Bowl (season)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: left;\"|Quarterback\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|}}\n|-\n|\n!style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Returner\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n!style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Quarterback\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nCoach of the Year\nNumerous organizations have awarded coach of the year awards, including AP, UPI, SN, PFWA, KC 101, and Maxwell. UPI and PFW discontinued their awards in 1996 and 2012, respectively. PFW's award was given in conjunction with PFWA's award from 1992 to 2012. Six Packers head coaches have won coach of the year awards: Vince Lombardi in 1959 (AP and UPI), 1961 (SN) and 1967 (PFWA); Dan Devine in 1972 (UPI, PFWA/PFW and KC 101); Lindy Infante in 1989 (AP, UPI, PFWA, KC 101 and SN); Mike Holmgren (KC 101); Mike McCarthy in 2007 (KC 101) and 2011 (Maxwell); and Matt LaFleur in 2021 (KC 101). Almost all of the Packers coaches won their awards after helping lead the team to significant improvements in their record from the season before or from achieving postseason success. Lombardi won his first coach of the year award his first season with the Packers, after the Packers achieved a record of  a season after going . Lombardi's second coach of the year award in 1961 came after he won his first NFL championship with the Packers, while his third award in 1967 came after winning three straight championships. Devine won his awards in 1972 after leading the Packers to the playoffs for the first time since 1967, while Infante won his awards after the Packers improved their record to  after only winning 4 games the year prior. Holmgren's award came during his first season with the Packers after increasing the team's record from  the previous season to .
