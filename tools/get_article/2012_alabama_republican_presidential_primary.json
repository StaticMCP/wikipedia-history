Rick Santorum was declared the winner.\nSignificance\nThe Alabama and Mississippi primaries were seen as a last possible point for the Newt Gingrich campaign to stay afloat in a primary season where he had only won two states up to that point; South Carolina in January and Georgia during Super Tuesday. Alabama and Mississippi were the keystones of his \"Southern Strategy\". Gingrich ignored other upcoming primaries to focus on campaigning in the two neighboring Gulf states.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ 2012 Alabama Republican presidential primary\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Percentage\n! colspan=\"3\"| Projected delegate count\n|-\n!

Gingrich did the best in the southeast, winning its 2nd congressional district. Romney won in big cities such as Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile. He was able to only win the Mobile metropolitan based 1st congressional district.\nThe results in Alabama, alongside those of Mississippi, effectively ended any remaining momentum for Gingrich's struggling campaign. Despite the second-place finishes in \"must-win\" states, Gingrich chose to stay in the race in hopes of facilitating a brokered convention.\nSee also\n* 2012 Republican Party presidential debates and forums\n* 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* Results of the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* Alabama Republican Party\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P12/AL-R The Green Papers]: for Alabama\n*[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P12/events.phtml?s=c&f=m The Green Papers]: Major state elections in chronological order"
