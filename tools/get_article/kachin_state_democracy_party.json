It was founded in 2013 by the former Vice President of the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), Dr. Manam Tu Ja, who led the official KIO delegation that participated in the military sponsored National Convention; which resulted in the drafting of the 2008 constitution.\nThe party's original request to participate in the 2010 general election was denied by the electoral commission, due to D. Manam Tu Ja's ties to the KIO. One of the campaign goals of the KSDP was to amend parts of the 2008 constitution.\nDissolved\nKSDP merged with Unity and Democracy Party of Kachin State and Kachin Democratic Party to form  on 7 June 2019.\nReferences"
