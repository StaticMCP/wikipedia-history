Rhode Island voters chose four electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote.\nPrior to the election, Rhode Island was considered to be a state Clinton would win or a safe blue state. Rhode Island, like most of New England, is strongly Democratic. Its voters tend to be liberal on social issues, most of its population lives in urban cities, its voting age population skews younger, and the Democratic Party has been regarded as the state's dominant party since the 1930s.\nAlthough Clinton easily won Rhode Island, her 15.5% margin was significantly weaker than Obama's 27% margin 4 years earlier. Trump notably became the first Republican nominee for president to win a county since Reagan won the state in 1984.\nPrimaries\nDemocratic primary\nFour candidates appeared on the Democratic presidential primary ballot:\n*Bernie Sanders\n*Hillary Clinton\n*Rocky De La Fuente\n*Mark Stewart\nRepublican primary\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n}}\nThree candidates appeared on the Republican presidential primary ballot:\n*Ted Cruz\n*John Kasich\n*Donald Trump\nGeneral election\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Los Angeles Times\n|\n| November 6, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CNN\n|\n|November 4, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Cook Political Report\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Electoral-vote.com\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n| align=left | Rothenberg Political Report\n|\n| November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RealClearPolitics\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Fox News\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|}\nResults\n}}\nBy county\n{| width=\"60%\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| County\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Hillary ClintonDemocratic\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Donald TrumpRepublican\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Various candidatesOther parties\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Margin\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Total votes cast\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Bristol\n| | 14,609\n| | 57.35%\n| | 8,965\n| | 35.19%\n| | 1,901\n| | 7.46%\n| | 5,644\n| | 22.16%\n| | 25,475\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Kent\n| | 37,788\n| | 46.05%\n| | 38,336\n| | 46.72%\n| | 5,929\n| | 7.23%\n| | -548\n| | -0.67%\n| | 82,053\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Newport\n| | 22,851\n| | 55.67%\n| | 15,077\n| | 36.73%\n| | 3,117\n| | 7.60%\n| | 7,774\n| | 18.94%\n| | 41,045\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Providence\n| | 142,899\n| | 57.51%\n| | 90,882\n| | 36.58%\n| | 14,693\n| | 5.91%\n| | 52,017\n| | 20.93%\n| | 248,474\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Washington\n| | 33,741\n| | 50.84%\n| | 27,230\n| | 41.03%\n| | 5,398\n| | 8.13%\n| | 6,511\n| | 9.81%\n| | 66,369\n|-\n!Totals!!252,525!!54.41%!!180,543!!38.90%!!31,076!!6.69%!!71,982!!15.51%!!464,144\n|}\n;Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican\n* Kent (largest city: Warwick)\nBy congressional district\nClinton won both congressional districts.\n{|class=wikitable\n!

Only East Greenwich voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but flipped to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Dark blue and dark red municipalities did not flip from 2012 to 2016.]]\nAnalysis\nDonald Trump flipped several municipalities that had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since the 1980s including Burrillville, Coventry, Exeter, Foster, Glocester, Hopkinton, Johnston, Lincoln, North Smithfield, Richmond, Smithfield, and West Warwick. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton was able to flip East Greenwich which voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. This was the worst Democratic performance in Burrillville since 1920 and the worst Democratic performance in Johnston since 1924.\nAs of the 2024 presidential election, this is the solitary election since 1984 where any county in Rhode Island voted Republican (Kent County narrowly voted for Trump), and the most recent election where Lincoln voted Republican.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Rhode Island\n* 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates and forums\n* 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Republican Party presidential debates and forums\n* 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gop.com/the-official-guide-to-the-2016-republican-nominating-process/ RNC 2016 Republican Nominating Process]\n* [http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/ Green papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions]"
