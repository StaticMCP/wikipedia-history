It is administered by Suffolk City Public Schools. The school colors are maroon and Vegas gold, and the official mascot is the Bulldog.\nKing's Fork was founded in 2003, and was designed by the architectural firm of Ripley Rodriguez Maddox Motley. It was commissioned by Suffolk City Public Schools due to a widespread economic expansion in sprawl in the western Hampton Roads area.\nDue to rezoning, students at King's Fork High are drawn from the Northwestern quadrants of the city, including the King's Fork area, Crittenden, and Hobson. Students are also drawn from the southern Nansemond Parkway/Wilroy Road area, and shares Downtown neighborhoods with Lakeland High School.\nBuilding design\nAccording to Ripley Rodriguez Maddox Motley, \"Each house contains space for assistant principal, guidance counselor, teacher work areas, general classrooms, science labs, and resource spaces in addition to two to three specialized career/technical subjects. A guidance suite was also included near Administration for flexibility in future guidance arrangements. Science labs are designed as generically as possible with only Chemistry having a necessary uniqueness. Each pair of science lecture spaces shares a wet lab and preparation partitions. Specialty subjects such as Agriculture, Work/Family Studies, Health, JROTC, and Liberal Arts that are not suited for location within houses are properly placed according to need and required access. Instructional areas typically share a small computer lab. The small lab requires less building area but offers more computers per classroom when time-sharing is utilized.\"\nCurriculum\nKing's Fork High School offers an extensive range of courses at core, honors, and Advanced Placement levels, in addition to various dual enrollment classes offered through the Hobbs campus of Paul D. Camp Community College, also located in Suffolk, and through Tidewater Community College. In addition to academic courses, King's Fork High offers a range of agricultural and resource management courses.\nDue to the nature of student interests at the school, only certain core subjects are offered at the AP level at King's Fork, and the arts department often has too few students for courses in music theory or other such classes. However, beginning in the 2008–2009 school year, King's Fork began offering courses beginning at the freshman level through the IB (International Baccalaureate) program, in addition to its current curriculum.\nSports\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Fall Athletics\n!Boys & Girls Team\n|-\n|Girls\n|Cheerleading, Cross Country, JV & Varsity Field Hockey, Varsity Volleyball\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Boys\n|Golf, JV Football, Varsity Volleyball, Cross Country\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Winter Athletics\n!\n|-\n|Girls\n|Indoor Track, JV & Varsity Basketball\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Swimming\n|-\n|Boys\n|Indoor Track, JV & Varsity Basketball, JV & Varsity Wrestling\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Spring Athletics\n!\n|-\n|Girls\n|JV & Varsity Soccer, JV & Varsity Softball, Outdoor Track, Tennis\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Boys\n|JV & Varsity Baseball, JV & Varsity Soccer, Outdoor Track, Tennis\n|}\nNotable alumni\n*Chuck Clark – NFL safety\n*Davante Gardner – professional basketball player\n*Lataisia Jones – first black recipient of a Doctor of Philosophy degree at the Florida State University College of Medicine\n*Lex Luger – record producer\n*Sugar Rodgers – WNBA guard\nReferences"
