The majority of death tolls reported for each day comes from the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition activist group based in Syria, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group based in London.\nMay 2012\n1 May\nThe Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) reported 45 people were killed, including 18 in a reported massacre in the Idlib province.\nHervé Ladsous, the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, said that both sides had violated the 12 April ceasefire agreement.\n2 May\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that 15 Syrian troops, including two colonels, were killed in an ambush by rebels in the northern province of Aleppo. Two rebel fighters were also killed.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that government forces had killed at least 95 civilians and demolished hundreds of houses in a two-week offensive in Idlib during ceasefire negotiations. The report documented dozens of extrajudicial executions, killings of civilians, and destruction of civilian property that qualify as war crimes, as well as arbitrary detention and torture by the Syrian government.\n30 people were killed across Syria, the LCC reported.\n3 May\n25 people were reported killed by Syrian security forces, including at least 4 students from Aleppo University. Around 1,500 students had been protesting in student dormitories next to Aleppo university's main campus when security forces and Shabiha attacked them, firing tear gas and live ammunition to disperse the student protesters. 200 students were reportedly detained, and the university announced the suspension of all classes as a consequence of the attack on campus.\nThe White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said it may be time for the world to acknowledge the cease-fire in Syria is not holding and try a new approach to stopping the violence.\n4 May\nAnti-government protesters took to the streets after Friday prayers, with the largest demonstrations occurring in Aleppo, Damascus, the Idlib and Daara provinces, and Homs and Hama.

US officials say the plan is failing mainly because of Syrian government violations.\n5 May\nSOHR reported that at least 5 people were killed in a bomb explosion at a car wash in the Al Sukari neighborhood of Aleppo. A member of the Free Syrian Army claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the car wash was used by members of a pro-Assad militia.\nReuters reported that the Syrian army had not withdrawn tanks in Douma in line with 12 April truce agreement.\n25 people were killed across Syria, the LCC reported.\n6 May\nThe Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported that 9 civilians, including a woman and child, were killed by Syrian government forces.

Several Syrian soldiers were killed by an ambush from the FSA as well.\n10 May\nAt least 55 people were killed and some 372 people injured by two powerful car bomb blasts in Damascus. Opposition groups denied responsibility while Haitham Maleh, a leading opposition figure, blamed the government. Media attention focused on the Al-Nusra Front, a little known jihadi-type group that had previously claimed responsibility for bombings in Damascus and Aleppo. Earlier in the week Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, head of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), had expressed worries that Syria was rushing into an uncontrollable spiral of sectarian violence and following the latest bombings urged the perpetrators to refrain from violence and let the peace process move forward.\nThe United Nations Security Council (UNSC) condemned the attacks and urged all sides to \"immediately and comprehensively\" implement the six-point peace plan of UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the bombings the work of \"outsiders\", alleging that unspecified foreign states shared the blame. The LCC responded by asserting that the Syrian government had orchestrated and masterminded the bombings to bolster the Russian position. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said that it was too early to call the peace plan a failure. She confirmed that the US was providing logistical and communication support to the Syrian opposition, but had shied away from providing arms.\nElsewhere, the LCC reported that 37 people were killed, including 10 in Homs.\n11 May\nAnti-government protesters took to the streets after Friday prayers, with the largest demonstrations occurring in Aleppo, Damascus, the Idlib and Daara provinces, and Homs and Hama. Syrian forces killed at least 14 people by mid day when they fired on demonstrators in Damascus and Aleppo.\nThe Al-Nusra Front allegedly claimed responsibility for Thursday's twin bombings in Damascus in a video posted online.\nThe Al-Nusra Front however denied responsibility, saying the video was a fake and that any information regarding their operations would be announced through Jihadi forums. Al Nusra denied responsibility for the attack.\nTwo Turkish journalists arrested in March were released following Iranian mediation.\n12 May\nThe LCC reported 20 people killed by mid-day.\n13 May\nThe LCC reported 30 people killed.\n14 May\nThe LCC reported that at least 22 people were killed.\n23 soldiers were killed by the FSA when the Syrian army attempted to assault Rastan, Homs Province.

She was distressed at what she described as a campaign of misinformation and said \"Some of the men are just normal people who were arrested in anti-government demonstrations and others were thieves and criminals who were nearing the end of their sentence,\" said the producer, \"They were told they will be set free if they confess to the made-up crimes.\"\n17 May\n34 people were killed. The Syrian army barraged Rastan with artillery fire.\n18 May\nProtesters took to the streets for weekly Friday protests, this time with the biggest protests at any single time in Aleppo. The Salahadin and Shukour neighborhoods saw tens of thousands, and tens of thousands more protested in the other area of Aleppo. Damascus and its suburbs, the Idlib and Daraa provinces, the Homs and Hama provinces, and Latakia and Deir Ezzor also saw large protests. Protesters were shot and killed across the country, including in the Tandamoun area of central Damascus. At least 33 people were killed by security forces by mid-day.\n19 May\nA car bomb at an intelligence complex in the city of Deir al-Zour killed 9 members of the security forces and left 100 injured.\nThe LCC reported 26 people killed.\n20 May\nDuring the very early morning the Free Syrian Army (FSA) launched widespread attacks against the Syrian government in Central Damascus. The Kafer Souseh, Mezzeh, Malki, and Ruk al Adn neighborhoods erupted with intense gunfire. Security forces began closing off Umayyad square and absereen square, and blocked of Central Damascus' Al-Shami Hospital. The Free Syrian Army's Damascus council announced that one of their operatives from the FSA's Al Sahabeh battalion had successfully poisoned all eight members of Bashar Assad's Crisis Cell, a group of top military officials who currently run the Syrian army's daily operations. Members of the Crisis cell include the interior and defense ministers, as well as Assef Shawkat. The Free Syrian Army's Damascus council said they believed at least six out of the eight to have been killed. Mohammed Shaar, the interior minister, apparently denied the assassinations by telephone, calling it \"categorically baseless\". He also denied the gunfire in Damascus which was confirmed by all witnesses.\nAdib Habb al-Rumman, the head of Idlib's Jish Shugour's Baath party branch, was assassinated by the FSA, the SOHR reported. The SOHR also made note of increased political and military assassinations by the FSA in recent weeks.\nAt least 28 people were killed by mid-day in Syria, primarily in the Hama province. Soran, Hama, and Douma, Damascus, came under intense artillery shelling by the Syrian army. By the end of the day more than 60 people were killed nationwide, including 37 civilians in Soran.\n21 May\n5 civilians, 11 rebels, and 22 soldiers were killed by mid-day. Much of the soldier deaths occurred when the Syrian army attempted to storm Atarib, Aleppo. The LCC reported 33 people killed by the end of day. According to S.O.H.R, 31 soldiers were killed by the end of the day.\n22 May\nAn IED exploded in the Damascus neighborhood of Qaboun, killing at least five people.\nThe LCC reported that at least 25 people killed.\n23 May\n23 people were killed, including 6 in Homs.\n24 May\n40 people were killed. 203 soldiers reportedly defected to the opposition, including 3 officers. An FSA officer said that the FSA was now present in all governorates and regions of Syria. A Brigadier General in the Syrian army who had defected to the FSA gave a speech in which he said that a safe zone or international intervention like air strikes was needed to stop what he called the genocide the Syrian army was committing in Syria.\n25 May\nProtesters took to the streets for weekly Friday protests, amassing in Aleppo, Damascus and its suburbs, Homs, Hama, Qamishli, and the Daraa, Idlib, and Deir Ezzor provinces. Tens of thousands protested in central Aleppo, to which security forces responded with live fire, killing several.\nMaj. Gen. Robert Mood, head of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), confirmed opposition group claims that at least 90 civilians were killed, including 32 children in Houla, Homs province. General Mood declared the killings \"indiscriminate and unforgivable\" without explaining how they happened, but said the violence had begun Friday evening with the use of \"tanks, artillery, rocket-propelled grenades, and heavy machine guns\", implying an attack by government forces since the FSA do not possess heavy weaponry. The official news agency of the Syrian government alleged that \"Al-Qaeda terrorist groups\" were responsible for the killings, while opposition groups alleged that the Syrian military and government-linked militias known as Shabiha were the perpetrators. The Syrian National Council (SNC), Syria's main opposition bloc, put the death toll at more than 110 people, half of them children. State media claimed 17 had been killed. A further 43 people were killed according to the LCC.\nOn the same day, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed the Syrian government for the \"unacceptable levels of violence and abuses\" occurring every day in Syria. Ban cited the government's continued use of heavy weapons, reports of shelling and \"a stepped-up security crackdown by the authorities that has led to massive violations of human rights by government forces and pro-government militias\". He said there was only \"small progress\" in implementing the UN peace plan.\n26 May\nThe UK Foreign Secretary William Hague called for an urgent session of the UNSC following Friday's \"appalling crime\" at Houla. He urged the regime to grant full and immediate access to Houla for UN monitors and stop all military options, as demanded by special envoy Kofi Annan. However General Mustafa Ahmed al-Sheikh, head of the Turkey-based Free Syria Army (FSA) military council, said regime opponents had lost all faith in the UN Security Council, on which Damascus has Russia as a powerful backer (see also Russia–Syria relations).\n65 people were killed across the country, including 25 in Homs.\n27 May\nThe Syrian army engaged in heavy artillery shelling in Hama and the Damascus suburbs. The clashes in Hama started after the rebels attacked government military checkpoints. According to opposition claims, after the military reportedly suffered four dead, the government troops started to shell residential areas, killing 30-37 civilians.\n51 people were reported killed by the end of the day, according to the LCC.\n28 May\nThe Syrian army killed 28 people by the late afternoon, including 9 in Hama. At the same time, the conflict has started moving into the two largest cities (Damascus and Aleppo) that the government claimed was being dominated by the silent majority, which wanted stability, not government change. In both places there has been a revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension. Shopkeepers across the capital staged a general strike and in several Aleppo commercial districts mounted a similar but smaller protest. This has been interpreted by some as indicating that the historical alliance between the government and the business establishment in the large cities has become weak.\n29 May\nAnother mass execution was discovered near the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor. The unidentified corpses of 13 men had been discovered shot to death execution-style. This incident raised awareness that the violence in Syria was heading towards an inexorable vicious cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between the different parties involved. According to the opposition, the 13 people who were shot at point blank range and later found in a field were employees at the electricity company in Deir Ezzor, who went on strike in protest of the massacres committed by the Syrian regime. They all had their hands tied behind their backs and were shot in the head according to a UN report. The head of a UN observer mission in Syria was \"deeply disturbed\" by the killings in Deir Ezzor, calling it an \"appalling and inexcusable act\". Several days later, the dead were identified to be military and the opposition than claimed they were army defectors killed by government forces. However, on 5 June, the jihadist group the Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant claimed responsibility for the killings, stating that they had captured and interrogated the soldiers in Deir al-Zor and \"justly\" punished them with death, after they confessed to crimes.\n30 May\nEarly in the day 46 people were killed, including 10 in Douma, Damascus.\nThe Free Syrian Army announced that they were giving president Bashar al-Assad a 48-hour deadline to abide by an international peace plan to end violence. \"It ends on Friday at 1200 (0900 GMT) then we are free from any commitment and we will defend and protect the militants, their villages and their cities.\", the FSA spokesperson is quoted saying.\nSyria's Consul General Hazem Chehabi of the Syrian American Council defected in California. He said that the Houla Massacre had been a tipping point and he could no longer support the \"barbaric Syrian regime\".\nMeanwhile, Syrian Army forces attacked Tadlu, Houla, the site of the Houla massacre days before.\nMachinegun fire was followed by shelling, forcing villagers to flee heavy shelling in fear of more carnage.\n31 May\n61 people were killed, including 29 in Homs.\nAn army sniper killed a boy in Taldou, Houla, where the Houla massacre took place. \"Frightened residents of the area fled\" for nearby towns, according to SOHR.\nJune 2012\nThe first weekend of June witnessed the death of 80 security personnel throughout Syria.\n1 June\nProtesters took to the streets for weekly Friday protests with the largest protests occurring in Aleppo, Damascus, Hama, Homs, idlib, Daraa, and the Deir Ezzor province. 43 were killed, including 13 in the Damascus suburbs.\n13 people were killed in another mass execution by the Syrian army in Qusayr.

For the first time, the UN also verified repeated allegations by activists that government forces fired from helicopters in the military crackdown on dissent.
