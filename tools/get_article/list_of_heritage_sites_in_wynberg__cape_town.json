The Herschel monument stands in Grove Avenue on what was formerly the Feldhausen property.\nSir John F. W. Herschel (1792-1871) was a famous British astronomer, the only son of an equally famous astronomer, Sir William Herschel. He came to the Cape in January, 1834, to make astronomical observations. He went to live at Claremont and stayed there until March, 1838.\nType of site: School.\n| image = Herschel Memorial Obelisk 2024.jpg\n}}\nThe road to Constantia swings to the right in Wynberg to enter Constantia, one of the most picturesque valleys in South Africa. Here we find some of the best examples of Cape Dutch architecture, and the best known of them is Groot Constantia. On 31 July 1685, the High Commissioner, Hendrik Adriaan van Reede, granted a farm of 762 hectares, which was to become known as Constantia, to Simon van der Stel. The origin of the name is not known. Various additions were made to the original grant from time to time—Witteboomen, the Zeekoeijenvalleij that included Wynberg and extended eastwards as far as False Bay and, finally, the right \"to graze stock, plough, sow and fish\" in the Steenberg. The farm Constantia was subdivided after the death of Simon van der Stel in 1712. The farm Constantia with the Cape Dutch manor house thereon was acquired in 1885.\nType of site: Farmstead.\n| image = Groot Constantia - 2.jpg\n| commonscat = Groot Constantia\n}}\n| image =\n}}\n| image = Rhodes Recreation Ground enter.jpg\n}}\n| image =Rustenburg_House.JPG\n}}\nThis unique group of buildings in the Classical Revival style, together with the open spaces, constitute the original Campus Plan as designed by, the architect J.
