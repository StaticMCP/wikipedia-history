Queen Elizabeth II High School follows the Manx National Curriculum. Schools are not subject to Ofsted and Examination results are not published. The school population has grown to about 800 students and about 50 staff.\nGCSE Manx is offered from the age of 12. One of the feeder schools is Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, a Manx language primary school in St John's. Manx medium instruction is offered to a small number of students for a limited number of Key Stage 3 subjects.\nSite\nThe school was opened on 5 July 1979 by Queen Elizabeth II, during her visit to the island to celebrate the millennium of Tynwald. During the time the school has been opened it has gone under extensive changes and has dramatically increased in size and with this, one new building was opened in 2000, the Forster building, which is home to the sixth form. In 2008 the Deans building was added, with an expansion proposed in 2014. This is home to the English Department on the upper floor, and the Music and performance area on the ground floor. This extension also provided the school with a much needed second dining room.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
