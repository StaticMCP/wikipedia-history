It occurred between the First (1804–13) and Second (1815–17) uprisings of the Serbian Revolution.\nDespite the collapse of the First Uprising in 1813, tensions in the Sanjak of Smederevo (\"Belgrade Pashaluk\") nevertheless persisted. In mid–September 1814 a rebellion was launched by veteran Hadži-Prodan (1760–1825) in the Požega nahija''. He was initially a rebel who surrendered to the Ottomans and was rewarded with a pardon, becoming a collaborator of the müsellim of Čačak in the Požega nahija. Following the capture and robbing of some Ottomans by his cousin in the village of Trnava, the Ottomans ended up blaming him as local Serbs rallied around him. Miloš Obrenović, another veteran, felt the time was not right for an uprising and did not provide assistance, instead aiding in the capture of the rebels.\nThe rebellion soon failed and Hadži-Prodan fled to Austria. After the failure of the revolt, the Ottomans inflicted more persecution against the Serbs, including higher taxation and forced labor. In March 1815, Serbs had several meetings and decided upon a new rebellion, the Second Serbian Uprising.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* (Public domain)"
