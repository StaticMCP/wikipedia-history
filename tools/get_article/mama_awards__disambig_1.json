First held in South Korea, the majority of prizes have been won by K-pop artists, although there are other Asian artists winning in various award categories, such as for Best Asian Artist and other professional-related awards.\nThe awards ceremony was first held in Seoul in 1999, being aired on Mnet. MAMA has also been held in various Asian countries and cities outside of South Korea since 2010 and now airs internationally online beyond Asia.\nHistory\nThe event was launched in 1999 as a music video awards ceremony, modeled after the MTV Video Music Awards, called the Mnet Music Video Festival. It merged with the KMTV Korean Music Awards in 2004 and was renamed the Mnet KM Music Video Festival. By the mid-2000s, the awards ceremony had attracted some international interest due to the spread of Hallyu, and it aired in China and Japan in 2008.\nIn 2009, the event was renamed the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA) to reflect its expansion outside of South Korea. In 2010, MAMA was held in Macau, marking the first time it was held outside of South Korea. The following year, in 2011, MAMA was held in Singapore, and was then held in Hong Kong from 2012 to 2017. In 2017, the awards ceremony was expanded to four nights, and parts of the event were held in Vietnam and Japan, in addition to Hong Kong. In 2018, MAMA had three parts and was held in three countries; South Korea hosted the MAMA for the first time in nine years, together with Japan and Hong Kong. In 2020, MAMA was held online only and took place in South Korea only due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nhas hosted the show seven times, including the 2024 awards in the United States — the first ceremony held outside of Asia]]\nOn July 20, 2021, it was reported by Ilgan Sports that the 2021 Mnet Asian Music Awards was undergoing discussion for the event to be held in Hong Kong despite the ongoing pandemic and travel restrictions. On August 23, 2022, CJ E&M announced that the event would be rebranded as simply the \"MAMA Awards\" going forward.\nActor and singer Park Bo-gum first hosted the show in 2017 and has hosted in 2018 and 2019. He returned to host from 2022 to 2025 and has been with the MAMA Awards through its rebranding and first foray into the United States. He has also hosted in Japan's three major domes: Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo Dome.\nTimeline\n* Mnet Video Music Awards (1999)\n* Mnet Music Video Festival (2000–2003)\n* Mnet KM Music Video Festival (2004–2005)\n* Mnet KM Music Festival (2006–2008)\n* Mnet Asian Music Awards (2009–2021)\n* MAMA Awards (2022–present)\nList of ceremonies\nAs Mnet Video Music Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" text-align:center;\"\n!

Shin later said they left because they did not trust the event to fairly select winners.\nIn 2009, entertainment companies Inwoo Production and SM Entertainment boycotted the 2009 awards ceremony with none of their artists attending. Both companies said the reason for their boycott was that they questioned the fairness of the voting process. In particular, SM Entertainment said that Girls' Generation had held the #1 spot on a music chart for nine consecutive weeks, but the group never won first place on Mnet's weekly M Countdown music show. The company also criticized a mobile poll which required participants to pay money in order to vote. In 2010, SM Entertainment artists also did not attend the year's awards ceremony.\nVoter fraud\nPrior to the 2017 awards ceremony, Mnet found that some fans had cast fraudulent votes through the use of bots. As a result, Mnet temporarily halted voting, then nullified all fraudulent votes, blocked relevant IP addresses, and deleted relevant user accounts.\nBroadcasting\nThe ceremony broadcasts live worldwide via Mnet, TVING, tvN Asia, Mnet Japan, Mnet Smart+, other CJ ENM channels, and YouTube through Mnet K-POP, Mnet TV, M2, and KCON channels.\nOther broadcasters that also broadcast the event includes au Smart Pass, Far EasTone Mobile Circle app & friDay Video, MeWATCH, TonTon, FPT Play, JOOX, ViuTV, Smart Livestream, and Vidio.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
