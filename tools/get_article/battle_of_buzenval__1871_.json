On 19 January 1871, the day after Wilhelm I was proclaimed German Emperor, Louis Jules Trochu attacked the Germans west of Paris in Buzenval Park. The attackers seized the town of Saint-Cloud, coming close to the new Emperor's headquarters at Versailles. Trochu was able to maintain his position at St Cloud for most of the day, but the failure of other French forces to hold their positions left him isolated and the Crown Prince's army was able to force Trochu's salient back into Paris by the next day. This was the last effort to break out of Paris. Trochu turned over command of the Paris defenses to Joseph Vinoy who negotiated the surrender of the city ten days later.\nThe French painter and National Guard officer Ernest Meissonier was one of those who worked to recover the French wounded from the field.  Fellow painter Henri Regnault was among those killed in action, shot through the head by a bullet.\nSources\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051116013444/http://lbdb.com/TMDisplayBattle.cfm?Bid=506 Battles & Leaders]\nSee also\n* Battle of Buzenval (1870)\nExternal links\n*"
