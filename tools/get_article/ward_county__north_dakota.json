As of the 2020 census, the population was 69,919, and was estimated to be 68,427 in 2024. making it the fourth-most populous county in North Dakota. The county seat and the largest city is Minot.\nWard County is part of the Minot, North Dakota metropolitan area as comprising all of McHenry, Renville, and Ward Counties.\nHistory\nThe Dakota Territory legislature created the county on April 14, 1885, with areas partitioned from Renville, Stevens, and Wynn counties (Stevens and Wynn counties are now defunct). The county government was not organized at that date; the organization was effected on November 23 of that year. The county was named for Mark Ward, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Counties during the session. Burlington was the county seat; this was changed to Minot in 1888.\nThe boundaries of Ward County were altered two times in 1887, and in 1892, 1909 and 1910. The present county boundaries have been in place since 1910.\nUntil 1908, Ward County included what is now Burke, Mountrail, and Renville counties; this landmass often being referred to as 'Imperial Ward' County and which was the largest county in the state at the time. In 1908, voters took up measures to partition the county. The results for that portion forming Mountrail County were accepted but the results for the portions that would become Burke and Renville counties were disputed in court, which resulted in favorable rulings in 1910. When the proposed county lines for Burke and Renville counties were drawn, neither group wanted to include Kenmare and risk that city's becoming the county seat, so Kenmare was left in Ward County at the end of a narrow strip of land, commonly referred to as the 'gooseneck'. One of the options reportedly considered around this time was to create a fifth county, Lake, with Kenmare as its seat.\nGeography\nThe Des Lacs River flows southeasterly through the northeast part of the county before doubling to the northeast on its journey to Lake Winnipeg. The county terrain consists of low rolling hills, dotted with ponds and lakes in its southern part, and carved by drainage gullies. The area is largely devoted to agriculture. The terrain slopes to the east and north, with its highest point near the southwest corner, at  ASL.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (2.09%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in North Dakota by total area.\nMajor highways\n* 25px U.S. Highway 2\n* 25px U.S. Highway 52\n* 25px U.S. Highway 83\n* 25px North Dakota Highway 5\n* 25px North Dakota Highway 23\n* 25px North Dakota Highway 28\n* 25px North Dakota Highway 50\nTransit\n* Amtrak Empire Builder (Minot station)\n* Minot City Transit\n* Souris Basin Transportation\nAdjacent counties\n* Renville County – north\n* McHenry County – east\n* McLean County – south\n* Mountrail County – west\n* Burke County – northwest\nProtected areas\n* Des Lacs National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n* Hiddenwood National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n* National Wildfowl Production Areas\n* Upper Souris National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n===Lakes\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census1790–1960 1900–19901990–2000 2010–2020\n}}\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, the median home value in Ward County was $266,796.\nAs of the 2023 American Community Survey, there are 28,290 estimated households in Ward County with an average of 2.38 persons per household.
