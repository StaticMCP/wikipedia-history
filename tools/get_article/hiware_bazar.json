It is noted for its irrigation system and water conservation program, with which it has fought the drought and drinking water problems.\nHistory\nThe village experienced mass exodus during the severe drought in 1972. However the village experienced a turnaround after 1989, Popatrao Baguji Pawar, the only postgraduate in the village won the post of gram panchayat sarpanch unopposed. He managed to get the illicit 22 liquor retail outlets closed, secure bank loans for farmers and started  rainwater harvesting, water conservation and management programs, which involved building 52 earthen bunds, percolation tanks, 32 stone bunds and nine check dams. Its development plan was based on village Ralegan Siddhi, 35&nbsp;km away, also in the same district, turned around by Anna Hazare. By the 1990s, reverse migration started as families started returning home. In 2012, the village with its 235 families and an overall population of  1,250, had a monthly per capita income Rs 30,000, up from Rs. 830 in 1995, plus it had 60 families with an annual income of over 10 Lakh rupees.\nIn 2012, the joint state and central government plan was announced to establish a national-level centre for training in panchayati raj system for watershed development, sanitation and capacity building at the village, to be built at a cost of Rs 12-crore.\nConservation and social change program\nHiware Bazar lies in the drought-prone Ahmednagar district. Prior to 1989, the village was facing several problems such as migration of the villagers to the nearby urban areas, high crime and scarcity of water.\nIn 1990, after Popatrao Baguji Pawar was elected as the sarpanch (village chief), the village used funds from government schemes and launched a program to recover its past glory. The village is conceptualized and planned after Ralegan Siddhi, another village noted for its conservational initiatives.\nThe villagers implemented a drip-irrigation system  to conserve water and soil, and to increase the food production. They avoided crops  like sugarcane and bananas, which require a high use of water. The program included rainwater harvesting, digging trenches around the hill contours to trap water, afforestation and building of percolation tanks. These initiatives were complemented by a program for social change, which included a ban on liquor, adoption of family planning, mandating HIV/AIDS testing before marriages and shramdaan (voluntary labour for development of the village).\nThe initiatives greatly improved the socio-economic conditions in the village, and the village was declared an \"Ideal Village\" by the Government of Maharashtra. At the \"National Ground Water Congress\" in New Delhi on 11 September 2007, the village received the \"National Water Award\" by the Government of India.\nIn 1995, only a tenth of the village's land was arable and 168 of its 182 families were below the poverty line. By 2010, the average income of the village had increased twenty-fold: 50 of the villagers had become millionaires (in Indian rupees), and only three families were below the poverty line. The grass harvest increased from 100 tonnes in 2000 to 6,000 tonnes in 2004, and the milk production rose from 150 litres a day in the mid-1990s to 4,000 in 2010.\nThe government even provided them with four bandis\n1.Kurhad bandi\n2.Charai bandi\n3.Nasha bandi\n4.Nas bandi\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hmkgn0nBgk The Miracle Water Village], a short film on Hiware Bazar"
