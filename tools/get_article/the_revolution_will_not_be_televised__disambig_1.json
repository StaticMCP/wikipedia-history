Scott-Heron first recorded it for his 1970 album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, on which he recited the lyrics, accompanied by congas and bongo drums. A re-recorded version, with a three-piece band, was the B-side to Scott-Heron's first single, \"Home Is Where the Hatred Is\", from his album Pieces of a Man (1971). This recording was still sparsely instrumented, but now, in addition to drums, featured a driving bassline played by Ron Carter and, somewhat unconventionally, a jazz-infused flute line by Hubert Laws throughout, acting as a countermelody to Heron's passionately delivered spoken word vocal. This sparse and rhythm-driven backdrop to Heron's incisive vocal, held down by Bernard Purdie's tight and explosive funk drumming, and eschewing thick chordal accompaniment, foreshadowed musical developments in hip-hop in the decade to come.\nIt was also included on his compilation album, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (1974). All these releases were issued on the Flying Dutchman Productions record label.\nThe song's lyrics either mention or allude to several television series, advertising slogans and icons of entertainment and news coverage that serve as examples of what \"the revolution will not\" be or do. The song is a response to the spoken-word piece \"When the Revolution Comes\" by The Last Poets, from their eponymous debut album, which opens with the line \"When the revolution comes some of us will probably catch it on TV\".\nIt was inducted to the National Recording Registry in 2005.\nIn 2021, it was ranked at No. 258 on Rolling Stones \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". In 2025, the publication ranked the song at number 14 on its list of \"The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time.\"\nCultural references in the poem\nEach verse has several cultural references:\n* \"Plug in, turn on, and cop out\", a reference to Timothy Leary's pro-LSD phrase \"Turn on, tune in, drop out.\"\n* \"Skag\", term for heroin\n* \"Pigs\", term for police\n* \"Process\", term for using chemicals to straighten a Black person's hair\n* Xerox, best-known manufacturer (at the time of the poem's writing) of photocopying machines\n* Richard Nixon, 37th president of the United States\n* John N.
