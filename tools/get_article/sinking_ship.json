After the Seattle Hotel was demolished in 1961, the Sinking Ship was built as part of a neighborhood redesign.\nIt was designed by Gilbert H. Mandeville (engineer) and Gudmund B. Berge (architect) of the Seattle firm Mandeville and Berge, and built in 1965.  They also designed the Logan Building and an addition to the First Presbyterian Church downtown, the Ballard branch of Seattle Public Library, and two buildings at the Seattle World's Fair in 1962 (the Alaska Building and the Transportation 21 Building).\nA writer for HistoryLink described the Sinking Ship as \"that skid road parking garage whose nihilistic construction depresses the flatiron block where James Street and Yesler Way meet at Pioneer Square.\"\nIt is owned by the Kubota–Fujii family, who had acquired the Seattle Hotel in 1941. Doris Kubota, from the same family, called the garage the \"ugliest building in all of Seattle\". It was also used during the 2001 Mardi Gras riot as a staging area for police and city officials. The Seattle Monorail Project proposed a monorail station at the site of the Sinking Ship, which it hoped to acquire through condemnation. The Kubota family disputed the condemnation lawsuit, stating their intention to build housing and retail at the site.\nIn 2019, the parking lot was named the \"coolest parking lot\" in the United States by the design publication Architizer and London-based Looking4.com. , the garage is managed by Diamond Parking.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://viaducthistory.com/neighborhood/SinkingShip.htm Audio history of Sinking Ship] from Washington State Department of Transportation"
