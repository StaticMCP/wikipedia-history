The Ghurid ruler defeated Bahram-Shah, captured the city, and destroyed it as revenge for the execution of his brother Quṭb ud-Dīn in 1149.\nAla al-Din Husayn plundered and burnt Ghazni to ground. He slaughtered thousands of civilians and enslaved woman and children. All of Ghazni's buildings were dug out except the tomb of Mahmud of Ghazni.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*"
