Later they were modified for driver only operation receiving a larger windscreen. They were withdrawn in 2000. 1707 (without bogies) is privately owned and stored at the Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway. The cab of 1710 is at the Workshops Rail Museum, converted to a driving simulator.\nAs of September 2025, 1707D is now back on bogies and transferred to storage (possible restoration) at the Zig Zag Railway, Clarence NSW. This means that there are now no complete Class 1700 locomotives in Queensland.\nReferences"
