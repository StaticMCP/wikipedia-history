He has contributed to academic and technical advancement in Indian agriculture, and holds numerous patents for advancements in integrated crop management and post-harvest technologies.\nEarly life and education\nShivam Satyawan Madrewar was born in Jath, Sangli district, Maharashtra, India, and completed his schooling under the Maharashtra State Board with distinction at SSC and HSC levels. He earned a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Agriculture from R.C.S.M. College of Agriculture, Kolhapur (2020–2024), focusing on plant protection, agronomy, and agricultural economics. He completed a Diploma in Meteorology from Alison University, Canada, in 2024, augmenting competencies in climate and weather analytics for agriculture. He is pursuing a Post Graduate Diploma in Agribusiness Management at the Chaudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Agricultural Marketing (NIAM), Jaipur (class of 2025), integrating marketing, supply chains, and agri‑innovation management.\nCareer\nMadrewar serves as Technical Advisor at Farmerface Organic Technology Research Institute Pvt. Ltd., Bihar, where he guides product development, field validation, and farmer outreach for bio‑inputs and sustainable cultivation practices. Since 2020, he has been a co‑operating partner at Shri Sairam Krushi Kendra in Sangli district, supporting input advisory, on‑farm demonstrations, and retail operations for smallholder clients. He has undertaken ICAR‑mandated field programs and campus projects during his B.Sc. (Hons.) Agriculture, focusing on agronomy, plant protection, and market analysis. Alongside professional roles, he contributes to research dissemination and industry interactions through conference talks, poster presentations, and innovation showcases at national agriculture events.\nResearch and innovations\n* Madrewar’s research spans climate‑smart agriculture, organic and biological crop protection, post‑harvest management, and digital agriculture, with outputs across indexed international journals and conference venues.\n* His studies include evaluations of climate‑smart practices on productivity and resilience, economic analyses of input markets and exports, and technology adoption in agri‑supply chains.\n* He has authored work on biological control agents such as Zygogramma bicolorata for Parthenium hysterophorus and on integrated pest management solutions for horticulture.\n* His innovations include AI‑enabled diagnostic devices, smart applicators, herbicide drift shields, improved harvesting tools, and insect trapping systems tailored to Indian cropping systems.\n* Select themes of his published work encompass market transparency via IoT, climate risks to export‑oriented value chains (e.g., grapes), bio‑inputs for soil and plant health, and low‑cost post‑harvest devices.\nPatents and publications\n; Patents and designs (selected; grouped by status and year)\n* 2024 – Granted/Registered: Draftoide (packing technique), Enhanced Multi‑Purpose Harvester, RhizoGaurd (banana rhizome weevil IPM), RhinoSafe (rhinoceros beetle IPM), Pomo SHB Trap, Crop Shield Sprayer, Pomo Tri‑Shield Trap, White Grub IPM Trap, Phero Snell Defender, AccuSponge Nozzle, Sub‑Soil Smart Applicator, Milk Pouch Wastage‑Avoiding Package, Banana Bio‑Rhizo Guard, Light‑Attraction Insect Killing Device, among others.\n* 2025 – Granted/Registered: AI‑based Animal Belt;
