Initially its only award was \"Alaskan of the Year\", but the \"Governor's Award\", the \"Denali Award\", and the \"With Great Respect Award\" were in turn added to its repertoire. The corporation gave awards until 2002, when decreased membership made continuation impracticable.\nAlaskan of the Year awards have since become projects of the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce and of the Governor's Committee on Employment and Rehabilitation for People with Disabilities.\nAward winners\nAlaskan of the Year, Inc. awards\n* 1967 – Robert Bruce Atwood\n* 1969 – Walter Hickel\n* 1971 – William A.
