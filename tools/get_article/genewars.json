Its working title was \"Biosphere\".\nGameplay\nPlayers move through a series of worlds using a small number of sentient humanoids to build small bases and to stun, kill, research, and ultimately breed a variety of animals. Plants are also important, as different plants can be grown and harvested for different purposes. Players must use the various plant and animal species available to them (as well as hybrid animals) to deal with different environments, enemies, and tasks. For instance, a crab is a good armored defender, while a mule is a perfect detritus transporter. The two can be bred to form a creature that is well armored, but also suited to mule work. The more a particular species has been studied and created, the more effective future individuals will be.\nThe primary resource of the game is goop, which is derived from all kinds of biomass.\nDevelopment\nGenewars was developed by Bullfrog Productions.\nSean Cooper was brought in to help with the game's development, causing tension between him and Peter Molyneux.\nReception\n| GSpot = 5.8/10\n| PCZone = 9.1/10\n| rev1 = Computer Games Magazine\n| rev1Score =\n}}\nGenewars received average reviews from video game critics upon release.\nIt was given the dubious honor of \"Most Disappointing Game\" of 1996 by GameSpot.\nSimon Parkin, writing for IGN, considered the game to be Molyneux's least known creation, noting the game bearing \"unmistakable signs of his design influence.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
