It was fought after Khalid ibn al-Walid had conquered Tadmur in Syria. His army marched to al-Qaryatayn, the inhabitants of which resisted the Muslim army. They were fought, defeated and plundered. This resulted in the conquest of Al-Qaryatayn by the Muslim forces.\nReferences\n* A.I. Akram, The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns, Nat. Publishing.
