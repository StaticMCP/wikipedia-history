The kidney was successfully transplanted upon rewarming to a rabbit, the rabbit being euthanized on the 48th day for histological follow-up.\nOn February 9, 2016, 21st Century Medicine won the Small Mammal Brain Preservation Prize. On March 13, 2018, they won the Large Mammal Brain Preservation Prize.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.21cm.com Official website]"
