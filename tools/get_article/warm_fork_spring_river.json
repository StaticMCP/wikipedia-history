The stream begins in western Oregon County at the confluence of Howell Creek and Elk Creek and the stream becomes the Spring River at its confluence with the cold springwaters of Mammoth Spring in northern Fulton County.\nThe stream was named due to the temperature difference between its waters and the cold springwaters entering from Mammoth Spring.  This is the only stream of this name in the United States.\nVariant names\nAccording to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as:\n* Spring River\nTributaries\n*Orchard Creek\nSee also\n* List of rivers of Missouri\n* List of rivers of Arkansas\nReferences"
