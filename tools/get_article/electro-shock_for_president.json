The band decided to primarily use electronic equipment to demonstrate the band's ever-evolving sound. This EP was intended to be a teaser for Brainiac's fourth album, expected to be their major label debut on Interscope Records. However, vocalist and keyboard player Tim Taylor died in a car accident shortly after the EP's release.\nTrent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails noted in a BBC radio show (May 2005) that Brainiac was \"really inspiring to me from a sonic standpoint.\" He went on to say that while recording 2005's With Teeth, he would use Electro-Shock for President as a sound reference.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nBrainiac\n*Tim Taylor – vocals, keyboards\n*John Schmersal – keyboards, guitars\n*Tyler Trent – drums\n*Juan Monasterio – bass guitar\nProduction\n*Jim O'Rourke – production, mixing, sound engineer\nReferences"
