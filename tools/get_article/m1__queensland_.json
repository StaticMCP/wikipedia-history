It connects the Sunshine Coast hinterland to Tugun, near the New South Wales and Queensland border, via the following corridors:\n* Bruce Highway between Curra and Bald Hills\n* Gateway Motorway between Bald Hills and Eight Mile Plains\n* Pacific Motorway between Eight Mile Plains and Tugun\nThe Pacific Motorway continues on south from the M1 into New South Wales, while the Bruce Highway continues further north from the M1 up the Queensland coast. Both of these roads and the M1 itself are part of the line of route of National Highway 1, although M1 signage is used for that part of the corridor.\nDevelopment\nWith the completion of Section C of the Bruce Highway - Cooroy to Curra upgrade project (Traveston to Woondum) in February 2018 the M1 has now been extended to Kybong,  south of Gympie. The Bruce Highway from Kybong to Gympie remains signed as A1. Section D of the project (Woondum to Curra, including a bypass of Gympie) will, when completed, become the next stage of the M1.\nNote: While the references use Woondum as a designator for sections of the project the new intersection that marks the end of the M1 is wholly within the locality of Kybong, although bordered on two sides by Woondum.\nTravel Centres\nA number of travel/service centres exist on the M1. These include:\n*Bruce Highway\n** Caboolture (Both Directions)\n** Glasshouse Mountains (Both Directions)\n** Traveston (Northbound, Accessible for Southbound Traffic)\n*Gateway Motorway\n** Nudgee (Northbound)\n*Pacific Motorway\n** Stapylton (Southbound)\n** Coomera (Northbound)\nMajor interchanges\n;Bruce Highway\n: Bruce Highway (A1) – continues north to Cairns\n: Myall Street (State Route&nbsp;6)\n: Eumundi–Noosa Road (State Route&nbsp;12 east)\n: Yandina–Coolum Road (State Route&nbsp;11)\n: Nambour–Bli Bli Road (State Route&nbsp;10 east / Tourist Drive&nbsp;23 west), Sunshine Coast Airport\n: Maroochydore Road (State Route&nbsp;8) east / Nambour Connection Road west, Big Pineapple\n: Sunshine Motorway (State Route&nbsp;70)\n: Steve Irwin Way (State Route&nbsp;6 / Tourist Drive&nbsp;24) west / Caloundra Road (State Route&nbsp;6) east\n: D'Aguilar Highway (State Route&nbsp;85)\n: Uhlmann Road (State Route&nbsp;60 west)\n: Deception Bay Road (State Route&nbsp;26 east)\n: Anzac Avenue (State Route&nbsp;71)\n: Gateway Motorway (M1) east / Gympie Arterial Road (M3) south, Brisbane, Brisbane Airport\n;Gateway Motorway\n: Bruce Highway (M1)\n: Deagon Deviation (State Route&nbsp;26)\n: Depot Road (State Route&nbsp;27)\n: Sandgate Road (State Route&nbsp;26)&nbsp;– no exit\n: Southern Cross Way – to M7, Eagle Farm\n: Moreton Drive&nbsp;– Brisbane Airport\n: Kingsford Smith Drive\n: Southern Cross Way – to  M7, Eagle Farm\n:Route becomes  for Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges\n: Lytton Road (State Route&nbsp;24)\n: Port of Brisbane Motorway (M4)&nbsp;– Port of Brisbane,\n: Wynnum Road (State Route&nbsp;23)\n: Old Cleveland Road (State Route&nbsp;22) – Sleeman Sports Complex\n: Mount Gravatt–Capalaba Road (Metroad&nbsp;2 west / State Route&nbsp;21 east)\n: Miles Platting Road (State Route&nbsp;56), Eight Mile Plains busway station, Sunnybank\n: Pacific Motorway (M1 south-east / M3 north-west)\n;Pacific Motorway\n: Gateway Motorway (M1)\n: Rochedale Road (State Route 30)\n: Logan Road (State Route 30)\n: Paradise Road (State Route 50)\n: Chatswood Road (State Route 50)\n: Bryants Road (State Route 47)\n: Beenleigh&nbsp;— Redland Bay Road (State Route 47)\n: Logan Motorway (M6)\n: City Road  (State Route 92)\n: Main Street (State Route 94)\n: Hope Island Road (State Route 4) / Tamborine&nbsp;— Oxenford Road (State Route 95)\n: Gold Coast Highway (State Route 2)\n: Smith Street Motorway (State Route 10)\n: Southport–Nerang Road (State Route 20)\n: Nerang–Broadbeach Road (State Route 90)\n: Nielsons Road (State Route 40)\n: Gold Coast–Springbrook Road (Gooding Drive, State Route 50)\n: Robina Parkway (State Route 42)\n: The Link Way (State Route 99)\n:  Somerset Drive / Robina Parkway (State Route 7)\n: Reedy Creek Road (State Route 80)\n: Bermuda Street (State Route 3)\n: Stewart Road (State Route 98) – to Gold Coast Highway (State Route&nbsp;2)\n: Pacific Motorway (M1) – continues south into New South Wales\nMetroad 1\nMetroad 1 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, is the former designation of the M1 road corridor in Brisbane. It connected Bald Hills to the southern suburb of Beenleigh via Gateway Motorway, between Bald Hills and Eight Mile Plains, and Pacific Motorway, between Eight Mile Plains and Beenleigh.\nIncidents\n*On 4 August 2017, a tanker carrying hydrochloric acid caught fire and exploded on the M1 near Loganholme, resulting in a 1km exclusion perimeter. There were no injuries.\nSee also\n* Metroad\nReferences"
