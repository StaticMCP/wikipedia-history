Cluster into groups of related sequences.\n* Multiple sequence alignment: align sequences of DNA, RNA, or amino acids.\n* Genome alignment: find and align the syntenic regions of multiple genomes.\n* Oligonucleotide design: primer design for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), probe design for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or DNA microarrays.\n* Manipulate sequences: trim low quality regions, correct frameshifts, reorient nucleotides, determine consensus, or digest with restriction enzymes.\n* Analyze sequences: find chimeras, detect repeats, predict secondary structure, classify into a taxonomy of organisms or functions, create phylogenetic trees, and ancestral reconstruction.\n* Gene finding: predict coding and non-coding genes in a genome, extract them from the genome, and export them to a file.\nSee also\n* Sequence alignment software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
