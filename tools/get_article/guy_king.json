Guy King's playing style has been influenced by many jazz, soul and blues musicians which include B.B. King, and Albert King.\nEarly life\nKing was born and raised in Israel. He was exposed bossa nova and salsa as a child. At age 7 King played the clarinet, and at 10 years old, he was part of a conservatory orchestra. When he was 13, he began playing guitar.\nAt 16 he toured the United States with an Israeli singing group. King had to serve three years of compulsory military service in Israel. Just Twelve days after King was discharged from the military in 1999 (age 21), King moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After a short time in Memphis, King then moved to New Orleans before settling in Chicago.\nCareer\nWillie Kent and His Gents\nKing was in Chicago blues singer Willie Kent's band The Gents for six years, becoming Kent's bandleader. After Kent died, King for a time wanted to play less and declined an offer to lead the band. He subsequently began his solo career.\nSolo career\nKing began his solo career in 2006. In 2009, King released his first solo album, ''Livin' It, and two more albums, I Am Who I Am And It Is What It Is and By Myself.
