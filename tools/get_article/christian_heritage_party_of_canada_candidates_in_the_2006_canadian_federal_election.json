It fielded forty-five candidates in the 2006 federal election.  Information about some of these candidates may be found here. The leader of the party at the time of the election was Ron Gray.\nAlberta\nLarry R.

This result remains one of the best in CHP history.\nReimer has been the interim deputy leader of the CHP.  He spent over $10,000 in the 2004 campaign, a large sum for a minor-party candidate.  His wife, Katharine Reimer, has also campaigned for the party.\nAnthony Barendregt (Selkirk—Interlake)\nAnthony Barendregt (born 1961 in British Columbia) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada.

Campaigning as an independent, he received 178 votes in Selkirk-Interlake.\nThe CHP were re-established by the 2004 election, and Barendregt again ran in the Selkirk—Interlake riding.  He received 353 votes, or less than 1% of the total.  On one occasion in this campaign, he claimed that the CHP would not increase funding to Canadian universities because they only consider postmodern views to be relevant.\nJane MacDiarmid (St. Boniface)\nMacDiarmid was raised in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, and holds Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Education degrees from the University of Manitoba.  She began working professionally as an educator since 1984, and has trained English as a Second Language employees in both the private and the public sector.

He is a farmer and scientist, and has worked extensively in international development programs on food production and related issues.

From 1982 to 1990, he was director of the International Potato Center in Southeast Asia (Tulsa Tribune, 26 December 1991).\nIn the 2006 campaign, Vander Zaag has criticized the Canadian government for cutting back on aid to developing nations as well as for promoting liberal social values. Notwithstanding their divergent views on social issues, Vander Zaag has praised Stephen Lewis as the only \"bright light for Canada's image in Africa\".\nLocally, he was chair of the Alliston Community Christian School for six years and served on the executive of the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario for five years. He lives in Essa Township, and is a member of the Alliston Christian Reform Church. Vander Zaag developed a successful potato breeding operation in the 1990s and 2000s, creating chip potato varieties that can be stored for longer periods than standard potatoes.\nHe first contested Simcoe—Grey for the CHP in the 2004 federal election, and received one of the best results for the party anywhere in the country.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"800\"\n|+ Electoral record\n|-\n! align=\"left\" | Election\n! align=\"left\" | Division\n! align=\"left\" | Party\n! align=\"right\" | Votes\n! align=\"right\" | %\n! align=\"center\" | Place\n! align=\"center\" | Winner\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2004 federal\n| align=\"left\" | Simcoe—Grey\n| align=\"left\" | CHP\n| align=\"right\" | 2,285\n| align=\"right\" | 4.13\n| align=\"center\" | 5/5\n| align=\"left\" | Helena Guergis, Conservative\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2006 federal\n| align=\"left\" | Simcoe—Grey\n| align=\"left\" | CHP\n| align=\"right\" | 1,585\n| align=\"right\" | 2.62\n| align=\"center\" | 5/5\n| align=\"left\" | Helena Guergis, Conservative\n|}\nCarol Ann Krusky (Wellington—Halton Hills)\nKrusky (born in Guelph) holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wilfrid Laurier University, and has taken courses at Guelph Business College.

He received 307 votes (0.85%), finishing fifth against Conservative incumbent Maurice Vellacott.\nVellacott is a staunch social conservative, and holds many policy views similar to those of the CHP.  He held a telephone conversation with Sanders during the election and, according to Sanders, indicated that vote-splitting with the Conservatives would be \"on the conscience\" of the CHP candidate if it led to a Liberal victory.  Sanders described this as subtle intimidation, although Vellacott denied this was his intent.  Sanders also argued that he could not support the Conservative Party as he had in the past, as it was not presenting a coherent policy on social issues (Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 9 January 2006).\nOther candidates (detailed entry not prepared)\nMarcel Bourassa (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, Sask.)\nCarson Chisholm (Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry, Ontario)\nGary De Boer (Sarnia-Lambton, Ontario) (also ran 2004)\nIrma DeVries (Perth-Wellington, Ontario) (also ran 2004)\nKen De Vries (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Ontario) (also ran 2004, 2000, 1997, 1993)\nSteven Elgersma (Haldimand-Norfolk, Ontario) (also ran 2004)\nRon Gray, leader (Chilliwack-Fraser Canyon, B.C.)
