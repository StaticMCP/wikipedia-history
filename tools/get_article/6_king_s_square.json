Dating to 1587, and built for Richard Hutton, it is now Grade II listed. At the time of the building's listing by Historic England, in 1983, its address was 5 King's Square. It became number 6 in 1997.\nThe building is located on the western side of King's Square, and formerly faced Holy Trinity Church, up until the church's demolition in 1937. It is adjoined on the right by the 19th-century 12 and 12A Church Street.\nIn the first half the 20th century, the building was home to the Porter Vaults, a public house owned by the Leeds-based Tetley's Brewery.\nFile:Millies Cookies (geograph 2275705).jpg|Entrance detail\nFile:York0122.jpg|The building is on the left in this 1960s view to the north\nReferences"
