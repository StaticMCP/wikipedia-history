Malboch refused to pay taxes to the Transvaal after it was given back to the Boers in 1881 by the British, which resulted in a military drive against him by the South African Republic (ZAR).\nBackground\nThe Malaboch war broke out when Chief Malaboch refused to leave his kingdom in Blouberg after being asked to leave by the government of South African Republic in April 1894. Piet Joubert led the Transvaal forces to an overwhelming victory leading to the surrender of the Bahananwa.\nReferences"
