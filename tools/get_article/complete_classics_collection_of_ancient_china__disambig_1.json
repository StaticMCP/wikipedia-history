It was begun in 1700 and completed in 1725. The work was headed and compiled mainly by scholar Chen Menglei (). Later on the Chinese painter Jiang Tingxi helped work on it as well.\nThe encyclopaedia contained 10,000 volumes. Sixty-four imprints were made of the first edition, known as the Wu-ying Hall edition. The encyclopaedia consisted of 6 series, 32 divisions, and 6,117 sections. It contained 800,000 pages and over 100 million Chinese characters, making it the largest leishu ever printed. Topics covered included natural phenomena, geography, history, literature and government. The work was printed in 1726 using copper movable type printing. It spanned around 10 thousand rolls (). To illustrate the huge size of the Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China, it is estimated to have contained 3 to 4 times the amount of material in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition.\nIn 1908, the Guangxu Emperor of China presented a set of the encyclopaedia in 5,000 fascicles to the China Society of London, which has deposited it on loan to Cambridge University Library. Another one of the three extant copies of the encyclopedia outside of China is located at the C.V. Starr East Asian Library at Columbia University. A complete copy in Japan was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.\nOne of Yongzheng's brothers patronised the project for a while, although Yongzheng contrived to give exclusive credit to his father Kangxi instead.\nName\nThe Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China is known as the Gujin Tushu Jicheng () or Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng () in Chinese, also translated as the Imperial Encyclopaedia, the Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Illustrations and Texts, the Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Writings and Charts, or the Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times.\nCompilation\nThe Kangxi Emperor hired Chen Menglei of Fuzhou to compile the encyclopedia. From 1700 to 1705, Chen Menglei worked day and night, writing most of the book, including 10,000 volumes and around 160 million words. It was originally titled the Compendium or Tushu Huibian (图书汇编). By 1706 the book's first draft was completed, and the Kangxi emperor changed the title to Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China (Gujin Tushu Jicheng). When the Yongzheng emperor ascended the throne, he ordered Jiang Tingxi to help Chen Menglei finish the encyclopedia for publication by around 1725.\nOutline\nThe 6 series are as follows.\n# Heavens/Time/Calendrics (历象): Celestial objects, the seasons, calendar mathematics and astronomy, heavenly portents\n# Earth/Geography (方舆): Mineralogy, political geography, list of rivers and mountains, other nations (Korea, Japan, India, Kingdom of Khotan, Ryukyu Kingdom)\n# Man/Society (明论): Imperial attributes and annals, the imperial household, biographies of mandarins, kinship and relations, social intercourse, dictionary of surnames, human relations, biographies of women\n# Nature (博物): Procivilities (crafts, divination, games, medicine), spirits and unearthly beings, fauna, flora (all life forms on Earth)\n# Philosophy (理学): Classics of non-fiction, aspects of philosophy (numerology, filial piety, shame, etc.), forms of writing, philology and literary studies\n# Economy (经济): education and imperial examination, maintenance of the civil service, food and commerce, etiquette and ceremony, music, the military system, the judicial system, styles of craft and architecture\nThe six series in total are subdivided into 32 subdivisions.\nNote that a pre-modern sense is intended in both \"society\" (that is, high society) and \"economy\" (which could be called \"society\" today), and the other major divisions do not match precisely to English terms.\nGallery\nPart 1: Heavens/Astronomy\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Strange or Unusual Phenomena - pic01 - 紫微垣圖.png|alt=\nPart 2: Geography\nTerritories\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Prefectures and Other Territorial Divisions - pic001.png|alt=|Map of the Qing dynasty's east coast (Mongolia and Taiwan marked as 蒙古 and 臺灣, Ryukyu and Korea marked as 琉球 and 朝鮮)\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Prefectures and Other Territorial Divisions - pic002.png|alt=|Further inside China (Chengdu marked as 成都 and the northern desert marked as 沙漠)\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Prefectures and Other Territorial Divisions - pic008 - 保定府疆域圖.png|alt=|Map of Shanxi\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Prefectures and Other Territorial Divisions - pic277.png|alt=|Map of Guangdong\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Prefectures and Other Territorial Divisions - pic245.png|alt=|Map of Jiaozhi (Vietnam)\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Prefectures and Other Territorial Divisions - pic253.png|alt=|Map of Fujian\nBorders\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Borders - pic021 - 元股國.png|alt=|Yuanguguo / Xuanguguo (玄股國), one of the countries in Huainanzi\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Borders - pic097 - 斯伽里野.svg|alt=|Kingdom of Sicily (Southern Italy), transcribed as 斯伽里野\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Borders - pic090 - 麻阿塔國.svg|alt=|Ma'ata (麻阿塔國), possibly referring to Malta, located in the Mediterranean Sea\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Borders - pic102 - 大闍婆國.png|alt=|Image of person from Kalingga Kingdom in Java (大闍婆國)\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Borders - pic106 - 三佛齊國.png|alt=|Srivijaya (三佛齊國)\nFile:Imperial Encyclopaedia - Borders - pic028 - 女人國.png|alt=|Kingdom of women (女人國), recorded in travels during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, possibly referring to some part of Australia.
