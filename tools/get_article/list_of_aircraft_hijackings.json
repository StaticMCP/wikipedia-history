Franz, a former spy during the war, forged documents from the Ministry of War that convinced the military commander at the Mátyásföld Airfield on the outskirts of Budapest to provide Franz and his Albanian partner, Bajazid Elmaz Doda, with a small airplane and a pilot. Somewhere over Győr, approximately halfway between Budapest and their supposed destination of Sopron, Franz pulled out a revolver, held it to the pilot's head, and demanded to be flown to Vienna.\n1920s\n* May 14, 1928: The first hijacking of an airplane in the United States occurred on the afternoon of this day, when a 28-year-old pilot named Harry W. Anderson was brutally attacked with a ball-peen hammer by his sole passenger, 18-year-old Clarence René Frechette, in an apparent suicide attempt. Frechette had arranged for a short flight in Anderson's biplane from Roseville, Michigan to Frechette's hometown of nearby Pontiac. When they were nearing their destination, at an altitude of about 2,000 feet above ground level, Frechette suddenly and viciously attacked the pilot with a hammer he had brought onboard, severely injuring Anderson and rendering him unconscious. The plane entered a spin and a steep dive, drawing the attention of many people on the ground, who mistakenly thought they were watching a stunt pilot perform an aerobatic exhibition. Just before the plane impacted the ground, Anderson regained consciousness and attempted to pull out of the dive, which likely saved the lives of both men. The biplane was destroyed in the crash, which occurred on the grounds of the Pontiac State Hospital, an insane asylum. Anderson was rushed to the hospital with severe injuries, including multiple skull fractures. Police interviewed him as he was wheeled into the operating room because the doctors feared he might not survive. Although it was difficult for Anderson to provide a statement because he had lost most of his teeth, he was able to tell the authorities what had occurred before he passed out. Frechette initially claimed that he had been the one flying the plane, and Anderson was the attacker, but the first rescuers to reach the crash site reported that Anderson's hands were still clutching the controls, and Frechette was holding a broken hammer. Authorities found several strange notes and letters in Frechette's clothes, including a note to his girlfriend that read, \"Death is my postage, sweetheart.\" Frechette suffered only mild injuries in the crash, and after a brief stay in the hospital, he was transferred to the county jail and charged with attempted murder. Several months later, Frechette was found guilty by a jury of \"assault with intent to do great bodily harm\" and sentenced to six years in state prison, earning the nickname of America's first \"air bandit.\" By the end of 1928, Anderson had made a full recovery from his injuries and returned to providing flight instruction at Packard Field in Roseville.\n*1929–1930 (unconfirmed): In the Fort Worth Star-Telegram daily newspaper (morning edition) 19 September 1970, J. Howard \"Doc\" DeCelles stated that he was actually the victim of the first skyjacking in December 1929. He was flying a postal route for the Mexican company Transportes Aereos Transcontinentales, ferrying mail from San Luis Potosí to Torreon and then on to Guadalajara. He was approached by Gen. Saturnino Cedillo, governor of the state of San Luis Potosí and one of the last remaining lieutenants of Pancho Villa. Cedillo was accompanied by several other men. He was told through an interpreter that he had no choice in the matter; he had to fly the group to their chosen destination. He stalled long enough to convey the information to his boss, who told him to cooperate. He had no maps, but was guided by the men as he flew above Mexican mountains. He landed on a road as directed, and was held captive for several hours under armed guard. He eventually was released with a \"Buenos\" from Cedillo and his staff. DeCelles kept his flight log, according to the article, but he did not file a report with authorities. He went on to work for the FAA in Fort Worth after his flying career.\n1930s\n*  February 21, 1931: The first documented hijacking of a civilian airliner, for which detailed and reliable records exist, occurred on this date, when a Pan American-Grace Airways airmail flight landed in Arequipa, Peru and was surrounded by armed guerillas as the Ford Trimotor taxiied to the terminal. After seizing the plane, the hijackers demanded that the pilot, Captain Byron Dague Rickards, drop propaganda leaflets on Peruvian cities in order to rally support for their efforts to overthrow the provisional presidency of Lt. Col. Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro in Lima. When Rickards refused, the rebels took him hostage, along with the other two members of his crew: George Hillman, a mechanic, and Bill Grey, a pilot for the Faucett Aviation Company. The three men were held for several days, but news reports at the time indicate they were unharmed and \"free to go where they please within the city\" until British officials negotiated their release. Captain Rickards was later honored by the United States government for saving the mail aboard his plane. Thirty years later, Rickards would become the first pilot to be hijacked twice, when Continental Airlines Flight 54 was seized on August 3, 1961.\n* September 25, 1932: the Panair do Brasil Sikorsky S-38 registration P-BDAD, still bearing the titles of Nyrba do Brasil, was seized in the company's hangar by three men, who took a fourth as hostage. None was an aviator, but they managed to take off in the plane. However, the aircraft crashed in São João de Meriti, killing the four men. Apparently the hijacking was related to the events of the Constitutionalist Revolution in São Paulo, and it is considered to be the first Brazilian plane hijacking.\n1940s\n* July 25, 1947: A domestic Romanian flight from Bucharest to Craiova was hijacked by three army officers seeking political asylum from communist Romania. The airplane landed at Çanakkale in Turkey. During the hijacking, the flight mechanic, Mitrofan Bescioti, was shot by lieutenant Aurel Dobre.\n* April 9, 1948: [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/04/09/94644837.pdf Twenty Czechs seized] a Czech National Airlines commercial plane at gunpoint and flew it to the American occupation zone in Germany in a mid-air revolt to flee the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Five of the passengers and one of the flight crew chose to be repatriated.\n* June 30, 1948: A domestic flight from Varna to Sofia was hijacked by Anti-Communists. The plane landed in Istanbul. The pilot was killed in the struggle.\n* July 16, 1948: Miss Macao, a seaplane, was hijacked in an attempted robbery and then crashed into the Pearl River Delta. The crash killed 25 of the 26 passengers and crew. The lead hijacker, Huang Yu was the only survivor.\n* September 13, 1948: A T.A.E. commercial flight from Athens to Thessaloniki was hijacked by eight young communists who asked the pilots to fly to Yugoslavia. The airplane landed near Skopje and, after the hijackers departed, the airplane returned to Greece. The 1987 film The Noose is based on this story.\n1950s\n* March 24, 1950: Three Douglas DC-3s from Czechoslovakia were simultaneously hijacked by former Czech Royal Air Force pilots seeking asylum in the West. Most of the hijackers were the crew of all three aircraft. All three planes landed at the US Air Force Base at Erding, West Germany. 26 of 85 passengers stayed in West Germany to escape from the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia. This was the first incident of mass hijacking in aviation history.\n* June 5, 1954: A team of KNDO (Karen National Defence Organisation) led by Maj Saw Kyaw Aye hijacked a Dakota DC-3 of Union of Burma Airways flying from Rangoon (Yangon) to the Arakan (Rakhine) State capital, Sittwe. There were 14 passengers and four airline staff. A monk, a woman and military officers were among those on board. The hijackers' plan was to use the plane to smuggle weapons for the KNDO to fight against the government army. Due to insufficient fuel, the plane could not land at their intended location and the smuggling plan was unsuccessful. However, there was a government-owned box of 700,000 kyats (US$333 in May 2025), guarded by a military officer, which the hijackers had not known about when planning the hijacking. The hijackers decided to steal the money, hand over control of the plane, and flee.\n* July 13, 1956: Seven young Hungarian students, armed with nothing more than plastic wrenches, hijacked a Lisunov Li-2 of Malév Hungarian Airlines out of Budapest and landed it at a NATO Ingolstadt Manching Airbase in West Germany to escape from behind the Iron Curtain.\n* December 2, 1959: the Panair do Brasil Lockheed L-049/149 Constellation, registration PP-PCR, operating flight 246 en route from Rio de Janeiro – Santos Dumont to Belém, with 44 passengers and crew aboard, was seized and hijacked by officers of the Brazilian Air Force and made to land at Aragarças, Goiás. Their intention was to use the aircraft in a bombing of Government buildings in Rio de Janeiro, thereby starting a revolt against President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira. The revolt faded after 36 hours and the aircraft was commanded to fly to Buenos Aires where the hijackers requested asylum. There were no casualties.\n1960s\n* July 19, 1960: In Australia's first hijacking, a man threatened to blow up Trans Australia Airlines Flight 408, but he was disarmed by a member of the crew and a passenger.\n* 1961: Hijackers forced an aircraft to circle Lisbon to drop leaflets against the Estado Novo regime.

Among the passengers were world champion boxer Luis Manuel Rodriguez, along with his training staff.\n* July 31, 1961: The first attempted 'skyjacking' of an airline on American soil. Said to be 'inspired by numerous airliner hijackings from other countries to Cuba', pipeline worker Bruce Britt Sr. boarded and attempted to commandeer a Pacific Air Lines flight at the Chico Municipal Airport, in Chico, California, intending to return to his home in Smackover, Arkansas. The attempt failed, but Britt shot two airline employees, blinding one for life.\n* August 3, 1961: Leon and Cody Bearden hijacked Continental Airlines Flight 54 traveling from Los Angeles to Houston armed with pistols. The Boeing 707 was to be used as a bargaining chip to gain political asylum with Fidel Castro in Cuba. The ordeal ended in El Paso, Texas, during re-fueling when US Border Patrol Agent Leonard Gilman, who had volunteered to be a hostage, punched Bearden with such force it shattered Gilman's hand.\n* September 28, 1966: Argentine nationalists, styling themselves 'Condors', hijacked a plane and forced the pilot to fly to Stanley, Falkland Islands.\n* July 23, 1968: To date, the only successful El Al hijacking attempt, as three members of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked El Al Flight 426 from Rome to Tel Aviv.

The plane refueled in Bangor, Maine and Shannon, Ireland, before continuing to Rome, Italy. In Rome, Minichiello took the chief of the airport police as a hostage and departed in a car, from which he slipped away, but was caught shortly thereafter. Minichiello intended to visit his dying father in Italy. Italy did not extradite Minichiello and he served only 18 months in jail. Covering 6,900 miles, this was the longest (by distance) hijacking in history.  A provisional film deal about the escapade has been signed.\n* November 10, 1969: The youngest American on record to attempt to hijack a plane when a Delta Air Lines flight en route from Cincinnati to Chicago was hijacked by 14-year-old David Booth.

There were no casualties.\n* March 17, 1970: Eastern Air Lines Shuttle Flight 1320, carrying passengers from Newark to Boston was hijacked around 7:30 P.M. by John J. Divivo who was armed with a .38 caliber revolver. Captain Robert Wilbur Jr., 35, a former Air Force pilot who had been promoted to captain only six months prior, was shot in his arm by the suicidal hijacker. His co-pilot, First Officer James Hartley, 31, was shot without warning by Divivo and collapsed. Divivo then turned the gun on the captain, causing an arm injury. Despite being fatally wounded, Hartley recovered sufficiently to rip the gun from Divivo's hand, and shoot the would-be hijacker three times before lapsing into unconsciousness, and eventually death. Although wounded and slumped between the seats, Divivo arose and began clawing at Captain Wilbur, attempting to force a crash. Wilbur hit Divivo over the head with the gun he had retrieved from the center console. With a .38 slug in his arm and bleeding profusely, he flew his aircraft safely to a landing while talking to the tower, telling them his copilot was shot (but not himself) and needed an ambulance.

He was captured at Dulles International Airport when the flight engineer, acting on the advice of a psychiatrist in the control tower, talked the hijacker into giving up his pistol. The crew convinced him that the short‐haul, two‐engine 737 was incapable of such a long flight and landed their craft at Dulles—exactly one year after a gunfight ended another attempted hijacking.\n* January 23, 1971: 1971 Korean Air Lines F27 hijacking, Korean Air Fokker F27 on scheduled Sokcho&mdash;Seoul flight in South Korea was hijacked by a man with hand grenades demanding to be taken to North Korea.

The ordeal lasted 43 hours across Texas, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and ending in Argentina. After a refueling stop in Monterrey, the hijackers released flight attendants Jeanette Eatman Crepps, Iris Kay Williams and Anita Bankert Mayer and all of the passengers. The remaining crew of Captain Dale Bessant, Bill Wallace, Phillip Wray and flight attendants Ernestina Garcia and Margaret Susan Harris flew on to Lima. The hijackers, a U.S. Navy deserter named Robert Jackson and his Guatemalan girlfriend, demanded and got a ransom of $100,000 (about USD$742,000 in today's money) and wanted to go to Algeria. The Bessant crew was released, one by one, and replaced by a volunteer crew of Captain Al Schroeder, Bill Mizell, Bob Williams, and Navigator Ken McWhorter. Two Lima-based employees, Delia Arizola and Clorinda Ontaneda, volunteered to board the flight. Clorinda had been attending college classes, something she did regularly during her off days from flying. Delia had been retired for six months but still offered her services. The 707 left for Rio and planned to refuel, but the hijacker forced them on to Buenos Aires. The long flight and fatigue took its toll, and the hijackers gave up. It was a record for long-distance hijacking, over 7,500 miles.\n* August 20, 1971: A Pakistan Air Force T-33 trainer was hijacked during the Bangladesh Liberation War in Karachi when a Bengali instructor pilot, Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman, knocked out young Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas with the intention to join Mukti Bahini. On regaining consciousness in mid-flight, Rashid Minhas struggled for flight control as well as relaying the news of his hijack to the PAF base. At the end of the ensuing struggle he succeeded in crashing his aircraft into the ground near Thatta after seeing no way to prevent the hijack and the defection. He was posthumously awarded Pakistan's highest military award Nishan-e-Haider (Sign of the Lion) for his act of bravery. For his attempt to defect from the Pakistan Air Force to join the Bangladesh Liberation War, Matiur Rahman was decorated with the Bir Sreshtho award by Bangladesh which is their highest honor.\n* November 8, 1971: Charles Hill, Ralph Lawrence, and Albert Finney were driving a carload of weapons to Louisiana as part of the Republic of New Afrika militant group. They murdered New Mexico State Police officer Robert Rosenbloom during a traffic stop and escaped to Albuquerque where they hijacked a TWA 727 to Cuba.\n* November 12, 1971: Air Canada Flight 812, a commercial DC-8 aircraft en route from Vancouver to Montreal, was hijacked as it approached Regina, Saskatchewan. The hijacker, Paul Joseph Cini, was armed with a shotgun and two bundles of dynamite. He then held the plane hostage for a ransom of CAN $1 million and forced the crew to land in Great Falls, Montana. Flight attendant Mary Dohey, who had been attempting to reason with Cini for the duration of the flight, managed to persuade him to release the flight's 118 passengers and some crew members. Shortly after, the remaining crew on board managed to overpower the hijacker, ending the 8-hour ordeal. For her actions during the hijacking, Dohey was presented with the Cross of Valour, Canada's highest civilian decoration for bravery. She was the first living person to receive the honour.\n* November 24, 1971: A man who became known as D. B. Cooper hijacked Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727-100 aircraft flying from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, received US$200,000 in ransom, and parachuted from the plane. The actual name of the hijacker remains unknown. The hijacker revealed what appeared to be a bomb to a flight attendant and demanded the ransom and parachutes. The flight landed in Seattle, and FBI agents provided the ransom money and parachutes. Cooper then released all passengers and two flight attendants. After refueling, the aircraft took off again and flew toward Reno, Nevada. Cooper opened the aft stairs and jumped from the plane with a parachute during a heavy rainstorm. The aircraft was forced to land with the aft stairs deployed. The FBI believes Cooper most likely did not survive, but the case remains unsolved.\n* December 3, 1971: French activist Jean Kay commandeered a Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 720 with 28 passengers on board as it taxis at Orly Airport outside Paris, France, for a flight to Karachi, Pakistan, demanding emergency supplies for East Pakistan.

He was convicted in 2001.\n* January 12, 1972: Braniff Flight 38, a Boeing 727, was hijacked by a lone gunman, Billy Gene Hurst Jr., as it departed Houston, Texas bound for Dallas, Texas. Hurst allowed the other 94 passengers to deplane after landing at Dallas Love Field but continued to hold the 7 crewmembers hostage, demanding to fly to South America and asking for US$2 million, parachutes, and jungle survival gear, amongst other items. After a 6-hour standoff, a package containing some of the items was delivered by Dallas police, and the hostages escaped while Hurst was examining it. Police stormed the jetliner shortly afterwards and arrested Hurst without serious incident.\n* January 28, 1972: TWA Flight 2, Los Angeles to New York, was hijacked by con man and bank robber Garrett Trapnell while over Chicago. Trapnell demanded $306,800 in cash (to recoup the loss of a recent court case), the release of Angela Davis (as well as that of a friend of his who was also imprisoned), and clemency from President Richard Nixon. The FBI retook the aircraft during a crew switch at Kennedy Airport; Trapnell was shot and wounded, but no one else was hurt. Trapnell's hijacking came after a string of domestic incidents and resulted in an overhaul of flight procedures by the Nixon Administration, procedures that remained in place until the hijackings on September 11, 2001. Trapnell and unrelated hijacker Martin J. McNally (see June 23, 1972, below) attempted to escape Marion federal prison on May 24, 1978, after Trapnell's girlfriend Barbara Ann Oswald hijacked a helicopter and ordered it to Marion but that hijacking ended when the pilot grabbed Oswald's gun and killed her. On December 21, 1978, Oswald's 17-year-old daughter Robin Oswald hijacked TWA Flight 541 in another attempt to rescue Trapnell. She surrendered after 10 hours of negotiations at the airport in Marion.\n* February 22, 1972: Lufthansa Flight 649, a Boeing 747-200 from Tokyo to Frankfurt, was hijacked by a group commandeered by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) during the Delhi-Athens leg and forced to divert to Aden, where all 182 passengers and crew were released the next day in exchange for a $5 million ransom.\n* April 5, 1972 : Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 171, a PK-MVM Vickers Viscount aircraft which was serving the Manado-Makassar-Surabaya-Jakarta flight route, was hijacked by one of its passengers and forced to land at Yogyakarta's Adisucipto Airport.\n*April 7, 1972: United Airlines Flight 855, from Newark, New Jersey, to Los Angeles, California, carrying 85 passengers and a crew of six, was hijacked by Richard McCoy Jr. during a stopover in Denver, Colorado. This was a copycat hijacking, modelled on the D.B Cooper 1971 hijacking of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, less than 5 months prior. The aircraft was a Boeing 727 with aft stairs (the same equipment used in the D. B. Cooper incident), via which McCoy escaped in mid-flight by parachute after giving the crew similar instructions to what Cooper had done. McCoy obtained a $500,000 cash ransom, but following fingerprint and handwriting matches, he was arrested two days after the hijacking, convicted and sentenced to jail.\n* May 5, 1972: Frederick Hahneman hijacked Eastern Air Lines Flight 175 en route from Allentown, Pennsylvania, to Miami, Florida. After receiving $303,000, 6 parachutes and two cartons of cigarettes he ordered the pilot to fly to Honduras, his birth country, where he parachuted over the jungle and disappeared. A manhunt by the FBI and Honduran police, plus a $25,000 bounty from the airline eventually led to his surrender.\n* May 8, 1972: Sabena Flight 571\n* May 24, 1972: A South African Airways Boeing 727 was hijacked between Salisbury, Rhodesia and Johannesburg and flown to Blantyre in Malawi.

The hijackers surrendered.\n* June 3, 1972: Western Airlines Flight 701 from Los Angeles to Seattle was hijacked by Willie Roger Holder, a black Vietnam veteran, and Catherine Marie Kerkow, his white girlfriend. The hijackers claimed they had a bomb in an attaché case and demanded $500,000. After allowing all 97 passengers to get off in San Francisco, they flew to Algeria where they were granted political asylum. The Algerian government confiscated and returned $488,000 of the ransom money to US officials.\n* June 23, 1972: In the 9th copycat D.B. Cooper-style hijacking Martin J. McNally under the pseudonym of Robert W. Wilson hijacked American Airlines Flight 119, a Boeing 727 bound from St. Louis to Tulsa and demanded $502,500.
