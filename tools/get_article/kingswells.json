These include Kingswells Primary School, a doctor's surgery, two veterinary practices (Town & Country and Ardene), a community centre, a town hall, a Co-op convenience store, a garage, a beauty salon, and a church. Kingswells has many children’s play parks and nature pathways, making it a family-friendly residential area. For food and leisure, the village hosts two take-away outlets, a restaurant/café and a pub at the Four Mile.\nNext to the village lies the Prime Four Business Park, which features a hotel, gym and Starbucks coffee shop. There is also a dentist. It is home to many major oil and gas companies, contributing to the area’s economic activity and employment opportunities.\nAlthough Kingswells does not have a secondary school, buses operate regularly, providing transport to nearby secondary schools such as Bucksburn Academy.\nThe village is served by public transport, including the McGill's service 14, which runs between Kingswells and Aberdeen City Centre on weekdays.
