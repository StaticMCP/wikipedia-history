Purcell also drew the famous cover of Green Lantern #1 (Fall 1941).\nBiography\nGreen Lantern #1 (Fall 1941). Cover art by Purcell\nEarly life and career\nHoward Purcell, whose early influences included the adventure comic strip artists Hal Foster and Alex Raymond, as well as illustrators Harvey Dunn and Dean Cornwell, took art classes at the Art Students League of New York. He worked as an animator in New York City studios before entering the comics industry, where his earliest known credit is National's Adventure Comics #53 (Aug. 1940), for which he wrote and drew the six-page feature \"Mark Lansing\". The titular adventurer's exploits with subterranean races and other science fiction conceits ran through issue #62. By that time Purcell had drawn the cover of All-American Publications' All Star Comics #2 (Fall 1940) – reprinted as the cover of DC Comics' quirkily numbered, 2006 hardcover collection All Star Archives #0 – as well as the feature \"Lando, Man of Magic\" in ''World's Best Comics #1 (Spring 1941), and both the Green Lantern cover of, and the humorous adventure feature \"Red, White and Blue\" in, All-American Comics'' #25 (April 1941).\nPurcell and writer John Wentworth created Sargon the Sorcerer in the following month's issue. A minor character in what would become the DC Universe, Sargon was John Sargent, whose exposure to the \"Ruby of Life\" during infancy granted him magical powers that he used in adulthood to fight crime, keeping his supernatural abilities camouflaged in his guise as a stage magician. Purcell and Wentworth continued with the character through All-American Comics #50 (June 1943).\nWith writer Gardner Fox, Purcell created the Gay Ghost in All-American's Sensation Comics #1 (Jan. 1942). The character, renamed the Grim Ghost in the 1970s, was similar to National Comics' the Spectre in that he was a ghost (of Keith Everet, the fictional 18th-century Earl of Strethmere) who inhabited the body of a modern man, Charles Collins, to fight injustice – although unlike the genuinely grim Spectre, he did so with cheery (i.e., gay) swashbuckling.\nLater life and career\nPurcell drew the Mr. District Attorney series, a comics adaptation of the radio crime drama, from 1948 to 1957. His 1960s work included drawing the DC series Sea Devils and co-creating the supernatural character the Enchantress with writer Bob Haney in Strange Adventures #187 (April 1966). The Enchantress appears in the 2016 live-action movie Suicide Squad, portrayed by Cara Delevingne. Purcell did a smattering for Marvel Comics, including two \"Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" stories, over Jack Kirby layouts, in Strange Tales #143–144 (April–May 1966); a Black Knight solo feature in Marvel Super-Heroes #17 (Nov. 1968); and three 10-page, semi-anthological backup stories featuring the Watcher, in Silver Surfer #4–5 and #7 (Feb.–April 1969 and Aug. 1969). Purcell's last known work was a story each in the DC supernatural anthology Weird Mystery Tales #1–3 (Aug.–Dec. 1972), plus the cover of #2.\nBy at least 1968, Purcell was additionally a teacher at a high school in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and at the Luzerne County Community College in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, and was chairman of that college's commercial art department. Purcell died April 24, 1981, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.\nBibliography\nDC Comics\n* Adventure Comics #53–62 (1940–1941)\n* All-American Comics #25–48, 50, 89–94, 97, 99, 101 (1941–1948)\n* All-American Men of War #13, 17 (1954–1955)\n* All Star Comics #42–46, 48–49, 51, 55 (1948–1950)\n* The Brave and the Bold #51 (Aquaman and Hawkman) (1963)\n* Comic Cavalcade #4–6, 15–29 (1943–1948)\n* Doom Patrol #86 (1964)\n* Falling in Love #96 (1968)\n* Gang Busters #16, 29, 40, 47, 52, 54–57, 59, 64 (1950–1958)\n* ''Girls' Love Stories #131, 133 (1967–1968)\n* Girls' Romances #160 (1971)\n* Green Lantern #26–27 (1947)\n* Heart Throbs #112 (1968)\n* House of Mystery #2–5, 7–8, 25–26, 29–30, 32, 35, 38–39, 43, 47, 68–69, 73, 77–78, 80–81, 87, 92–94, 97–98, 100, 103, 106, 112, 119–120, 122–123, 125–126, 128–129, 140 (1952–1964)\n* House of Secrets #6, 11, 14, 17, 20–21, 27, 31–32, 35, 37–39, 41, 44–45, 49, 52–53, 55–57, 59 (1957–1963)\n* Mr. District Attorney #6–59 (1948–1957)\n* My Greatest Adventure #29, 33, 35–36, 38, 40, 44, 53–54, 58–59, 62–63, 66, 68, 70–71, 75, 78–79, 84 (1959–1963)\n* Mystery in Space #1, 96–101, 103 (1951–1965)\n* Our Army at War #27, 29 (1954)\n* Sea Devils #16–33 (1964–1967)\n* Sensation Comics #1–13, 15–33 (Gay Ghost) (1942–1944)\n* Strange Adventures #10, 164, 166, 171, 184, 187, 191, 197, 200 (1951–1967)\n* Tales of the Unexpected #1, 3, 22, 25–26, 28–29, 31, 33–34, 38, 40, 43, 45, 47, 51, 54–56, 59–63, 65, 67–68, 72, 81, 83–85, 92, 98 (1956–1966)\n* The Unexpected #106 (1968)\n* Weird Mystery Tales #1–3 (1972)\n* World's Best Comics #1 (1941)\n* World's Finest Comics #2–3 (1941)\n* Young Romance #153 (1968)\nEC Comics\n* International Comics #1, 3 (1947)\nFawcett Comics\n* Master Comics #22 (1942)\nMarvel Comics\n* Marvel Super-Heroes #17 (Black Knight) (1968)\n* Silver Surfer #4–5, 7 (Watcher backup stories) (1969)\n* Strange Tales'' #143–144 (Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. feature) (1966)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.mikesamazingworld.com/main/features/creator.php?creatorid=234 Howard Purcell] at Mike's Amazing World of Comics\n* [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/namp44.htm#N1565 Howard Purcell] at the Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators"
