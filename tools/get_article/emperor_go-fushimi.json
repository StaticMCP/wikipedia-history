This agreement did not last long, as it was broken by Emperor Go-Daigo.\nGo-Fushimi was the author of a famous plea to the god of the Kamo Shrine for help in gaining the throne for his son.  This plea was ultimately successful, but it was not until thirty-three years after his abdication that Go-Fushimi's son, Emperor Kōgon became emperor.  Kōgon was the first of the northern court emperors backed by the Ashikaga shogunate.\nEmperor Go-Fushimi is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called Fukakusa no kita no misasagi () in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.
