It forms a  arc extending from the tripoint with Austria at the south to the tripoint with Poland at the north.\nRivers\nSeveral rivers cross this border, or form portions of it. These include:\n*Chamb ()\n*Pfreimd ()\n*Wondreb ()\n*Ohře ()\n*Mže ()\n*White Elster ()\n*Natzschung ()\n*Flöha ()\n*Wild Weißeritz ()\n*Müglitz ()\n*Biela ()\n*Elbe ()\n*Spree ()\n*Mandau ()\n*Lusatian Neisse (, )\nHistory\nThe border comes from the border of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, which later became the border between the German Empire and the Austrian Empire.\nIn the period 1945–1990, the West German–Czechoslovak border formed part of the Iron Curtain and was heavily fenced and strictly guarded.\nThe Czech Republic joined the Schengen Area in 2007. This meant that all passport checks were removed along the border in December 2007. The limitations on Czechs working in Germany expired in April 2011.\nSee also\n*Czechoslovakian border fortifications during the Cold War\n*Czech Republic–Germany relations\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/lines_germany-czechia.php Border lines Germany – Czech Republic] (railways)"
