It is part of the Star Wars franchise and a spin-off from Star Wars: The Clone Wars, continuing from the end of that series to depict the aftermath of Order 66 and the end of the Clone Wars. The Bad Batch follows a unique squad of clone troopers with genetic mutations who resist Order 66 and go on the run in the early days of the Galactic Empire. They are joined by Omega, a young female clone.\nDee Bradley Baker voices the Bad Batch, as well as most of the other clones in the series, as he did in The Clone Wars. Michelle Ang voices Omega. The series was announced in July 2020, after the final season of The Clone Wars introduced the Bad Batch based on an idea from Star Wars creator George Lucas. The Bad Batch was produced by Lucasfilm Animation, with Jennifer Corbett as head writer and Brad Rau as supervising director; Filoni, Corbett, and Rau served as executive producers with Athena Yvette Portillo.\nThe first season premiered on May 4, 2021, and ran for 16 episodes until August 13. A 16-episode second season was released from January 4 to March 29, 2023, and a 15-episode third and final season was released from February 21 to May 1, 2024. The series has received positive reviews from critics, particularly for its animation and voice acting.\nPremise\nIn the Star Wars universe, the Clone Wars is a series of conflicts between the Galactic Republic and a Separatist movement; the name comes from the Republic's army, which consists of clone troopers created from the genetic material of bounty hunter Jango Fett. Clone Force 99, also known as \"The Bad Batch\", is a unique squad of clones with genetic mutations that were introduced in the series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. These mutations allow most of the Bad Batch to resist Order 66, which brings the Clone Wars to an end by triggering secret programming in the clones that forces them to execute the Jedi and become obedient to Emperor Palpatine and the new Galactic Empire. Star Wars: The Bad Batch follows the titular team as they become mercenaries on the run in the early days of the Empire. They are joined by Omega, a young female clone of Jango Fett.\nThe series also tells the stories of other clones following the end of the Clone Wars, including how some begin to question Order 66, how the Empire phases out the clone army in favor of conscripted Stormtroopers, and how Imperial cloning resources are re-directed to \"Project Necromancer\"—a secret project to clone Palpatine that helps explain his return from death in the film Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nEpisodes\n| end1         =\n| color2       = #ECB368\n| link2        = #Season 2 (2023)\n| episodes2    = 16\n| start2       =\n| end2         =\n| color3       = #435973\n| link3        = #Season 3 (2024)\n| episodes3    = 15\n| start3       =\n| end3         =\n}}\nSeason 1 (2021)\n|ShortSummary    = Clone Force 99, also known as \"The Bad Batch\", includes defective clone troopers Hunter, Tech, Crosshair, and Wrecker plus cyborg clone Echo. During the Clone Wars, the Bad Batch assists Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan learner Caleb Dume on Kaller. Order 66 is issued, triggering programming in the regular clones that makes them kill Billaba. The Bad Batch receives the order too, but only Crosshair feels compelled to obey it, and Hunter lets Dume escape. Returning to the clone facilities on Kamino, the Bad Batch learns that the war is over and an Empire has replaced the Galactic Republic. They meet a young girl, Omega, who is another defective clone. Admiral Tarkin arrives to evaluate the clones and sends the Bad Batch to eliminate insurgents on Onderon. When they discover that these \"insurgents\" are refugees under Saw Gerrera who refuse to submit to the new Empire, the Bad Batch abandons the mission and returns for Omega. They are arrested for treason, and Tarkin enhances Crosshair's programming, turning him against his squad. The rest of the Bad Batch flee with Omega.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The Bad Batch and Omega seek refuge on Saleucami with clone deserter Cut Lawquane, who tells them about the inhibitor chips that programmed the regular clones and Crosshair to be loyal to the Empire after Order 66. With increased military presence from the Empire, Cut plans to escape with his family, but they need newly introduced chain codes to book public transport. Cut would be arrested if he tried to obtain chain codes, so Tech and Echo steal some, and Omega helps deliver them to Cut and his family in time for them to board the transport. Hunter wants Omega to go with Cut so she can have a family, but she decides to stay with the Bad Batch.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The Bad Batch's ship, the Marauder, is damaged on Saleucami. They are stranded on a moon and an Ordo Moon Dragon steals the part they need to repair the ship. Hunter and Omega set out to retrieve it. When Hunter is incapacitated, Omega continues alone and retrieves the part without a fight. On Kamino, Tarkin and Vice Admiral Rampart put Crosshair in command of a new unit of conscripted soldiers. They are sent to Onderon to wipe out Gerrera's camp, but Gerrera is already gone. Crosshair kills a disloyal recruit, but the rest comply and are otherwise successful. Tarkin sees potential for conscripted soldiers, concerning Kaminoan prime minister Lama Su.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = On their way to a proposed hiding-place on Idaflor, the Bad Batch is forced to stop on the nearest planet, Pantora, so they can gather supplies and Tech can modify their ship's signature since it now appears on the Empire's wanted list. A landing bay attendant on Pantora identifies the Bad Batch and informs Fennec Shand, a mercenary who has been hired to retrieve Omega. Hunter, Echo, and Omega search for supplies while Tech and Wrecker work on the ship. Omega is approached by Shand, which leads to Hunter chasing Shand through the city. Hunter and Omega lose Shand, and after the modifications are completed the Bad Batch departs from Pantora.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Hoping to discover who hired Shand, the Bad Batch goes to Ord Mantell where Echo knows of an informant named Cid. She offers to find out about Shand in exchange for their help: slavers have kidnapped a child named Muchi, and Cid will receive a reward from Jabba the Hutt if the Bad Batch helps her rescue the child. The Bad Batch finds and fights off the slavers, rescuing Muchi, who is a young rancor. Taking her to Cid, Muchi is then given to Jabba's right-hand man Bib Fortuna in exchange for the reward. Cid gives some of the reward to Hunter but is unable to learn who hired Shand. She offers to give the Bad Batch more mercenary work in the future.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Cid hires the Bad Batch to retrieve a Separatist tactical droid with battle intel before it is destroyed at a Corellian decommissioning site. They run into smuggler sisters Trace and Rafa Martez, who are also after the droid. Wrecker's inhibitor chip begins to activate after he accidentally hits his head. Tech copies the tactical droid's data before it is destroyed when he and the sisters program it to turn on the police droids that are guarding the facility, allowing them to escape. The sisters explain that they were retrieving the droid for a client who is fighting the Empire, and Hunter decides to give them the data. Later, the sisters tell their client how to find the Bad Batch.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = After they fail to retrieve the tactical droid's data, Cid tells the Bad Batch that they will need to do a big job to pay off their debt to her. They are interrupted by the Martez sisters' client, former clone captain Rex, who is alarmed to learn that the Bad Batch have yet to remove their inhibitor chips as he has. They go to Bracca, a starship graveyard planet controlled by the Scrapper Guild, and sneak onto an old Jedi cruiser to use its medical bay. Wrecker's chip forces him to attack his squad mates, but he is subdued and the chip is removed. Rex takes his leave once the extractions are completed; as they say goodbye, Hunter is seen by members of the Scrapper Guild.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The Scrapper Guild informs the Empire of the Bad Batch's location, and Crosshair is sent to kill them. Concerned that Omega will not be returned safely, Lama Su hires a second bounty hunter to retrieve the girl. The Bad Batch attempts to reach the Marauder through the Jedi cruiser's ion engine. Crosshair pins them inside and has the engine turned on, but they use explosives salvaged from the cruiser's armory to escape and Crosshair is injured by the engine's ignition. Hunter and Omega are confronted by bounty hunter Cad Bane, who shoots Hunter and kidnaps Omega. The rest of the squad catch up, carry the injured Hunter to the Marauder, and escape.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = While chasing after Bane, the Bad Batch learns from Tech that Omega is an unmodified clone of Jango Fett and so is the only available source of fresh cloning material for the Kaminoans. En route to an old Kaminoan cloning facility on Bora Vio for her delivery, Omega tricks Bane's droid aide Todo into releasing her and is able to signal the Bad Batch. Lama Su sends Taun We to retrieve Omega and orders Nala Se to eliminate the girl after extracting genetic samples from her. Nala Se cares for Omega and wants to keep her safe, so she sends Shand to rescue her. Shand kills Taun We and duels Bane, allowing Omega to escape and be retrieved by the Bad Batch.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = On Raxus, which was the seat of the Separatist government during the Clone Wars, the Empire institutes new curfew laws with the support of local senator Avi Singh. However, Singh speaks out against the Empire while addressing the public and is arrested. His protocol droid GS-8 hires Cid to help rescue Singh, and she sends the Bad Batch; they are reluctant to help after fighting against the Separatists in the Clone Wars. Omega is left behind due to the bounty hunters that are targeting her, and she wins Cid enough money playing dejarik to pay off the Bad Batch's debt. With the help of GS-8, the Bad Batch rescues Singh and take him to Cid for payment.\n|LineColor       = 575654\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = When Senator Orn Free Taa announces a new Imperial refinery on Ryloth and encourages Twi'lek freedom fighters to disarm, resistance leader Cham Syndulla publicly supports the Empire.

During their final test at sea, Ventress inadvertently summons a sea monster which attacks them. She pacifies the creature and rescues Omega, gaining the Bad Batch's trust.

Star Wars creator George Lucas wanted them to each have special abilities that made them different from other clones, but he did not want them to be superheroes. The Bad Batch includes: Hunter, the leader of the team who has enhanced senses and is described as a \"master tracker\"; Wrecker, who has enhanced muscles and a reinforced skeleton making him very strong; Crosshair, a skilled sniper; Tech, a genius who specializes in technology; and Echo, a former regular clone or \"reg\" who was turned into a cyborg through horrific experimentation and can now interface with computer systems. Despite being clones, Baker made sure the team had noticeable differences in each voice, such as Tech's precision and Crosshair sounding like a \"coiled snake\".\n** As he did for Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Baker also voices most of the other clones in the series, including: Grey, the captain under Jedi Master Depa Billaba during Order 66; Cut Lawquane, a Clone Wars deserter who goes into hiding with his family; Rex, a former captain who was believed killed at the end of the Clone Wars and now works in secret to help other clones and resist the Empire; Howzer, a captain on Ryloth who supports local freedom fighters over the Empire; Gregor, a commando working with Rex; Wilco, a captain stationed on Serenno who is murdered by Vice Admiral Rampart for refusing to falsify a report; Cody, a commander who deserts after starting to question the Empire during a mission with Crosshair; Cade and Slip, clones who are killed by Rampart as part of a conspiracy to cover-up the destruction of Tipoca City; Scorch, a commando who leads the Advanced Science Division's forces; Mayday, the commander of a desolate outpost on Barton IV whose death is a catalyst for Crosshair turning on the Empire; Fireball and Nemec, members of Rex's group of rogue clones; the Clone X assassins; and Wolffe, a commander sent to capture Omega who is talked down by Rex. Baker added subtle differences to the voice of each clone.\n** Baker reprised the role of Barton Coburn, an Imperial admiral who attends Tarkin's summit, from The Clone Wars. He also provided the sounds for Batcher, a lurca hound that Omega befriends.\n* Michelle Ang as Omega:A young female clone who joins the Bad Batch. She is an unmodified replication of Jango Fett, so she ages normally unlike the Bad Batch and other clones who age at twice the normal speed. This means Omega is technically older than most of the other clones, despite appearing to be much younger. Her name is a reference to the first unmodified clone of Jango Fett, \"Alpha\", who is better known as Jango's son Boba. To create Omega's voice, Ang used her own New Zealand accent but altered her pitch and state of mind to give the character a \"youthfulness\". Ang also took inspiration from watching her young son have new experiences.\nRecurring\nIntroduced in other Star Wars media\n* Ben Diskin as AZI-3: A medical droid from Kamino who helps the Bad Batch\n* Bob Bergen as Lama Su: The prime minister of Kamino\n* Gwendoline Yeo as Nala Se: The Kaminoan scientist in charge of the cloning process\n* Stephen Stanton as\n** Wilhuff Tarkin: A high-ranking Imperial officer\n** Mas Amedda: The Grand Vizier of the Empire\n* Jennifer Hale as Riyo Chuchi: A Pantoran senator who advocates for the clones\nIntroduced in season one\n* Noshir Dalal as Rampart: An Imperial vice admiral who is responsible for the new conscripted Stormtrooper program\n* Liam O'Brien as Bolo: An Ithorian regular at Cid's parlor\n* Sam Riegel as Ketch: A Weequay regular at Cid's parlor\n* Rhea Perlman as Cid Scaleback: A Trandoshan and former Jedi informant who provides mercenary work to the Bad Batch\n* Shelby Young as\n** Bragg: An Imperial captain stationed on Raxus Secundus\n** Yanna: A Wookiee elder\n** Bayrn: A Tarlafar who is a young Project Necromancer test subject with a high M-count\n* Helen Sadler as Scalder: A doctor in the Empire's Advanced Science Division\nIntroduced in season two\n* Wanda Sykes as Phee Genoa: A pirate contact of Cid's who befriends the Bad Batch\n* Jimmi Simpson as Royce Hemlock: The director of the Empire's Advanced Science Division (ASD)\n* Keisha Castle-Hughes as Emerie Karr: An adult female clone of Jango Fett who works for the ASD\nIntroduced in season three\n* Ivan Sinitsin as Jax: A Mirialan who is a young Project Necromancer test subject with a high M-count, designated SP-32\n* Olwyn M.

The character's last appearance in the Star Wars timeline was the 2015 novel Dark Disciple, which was adapted from unproduced The Clone Wars scripts and story reels. In the book, Ventress falls in love with rogue Jedi Quinlan Vos and sacrifices herself to save him. When executive producer Dave Filoni suggested the character be brought back for the third season of The Bad Batch, the producers worked out a way for Ventress to survive those events which they planned to reveal in a future Star Wars story. Her appearance in The Bad Batch is based on design work done for the unproduced The Clone Wars episodes, including longer hair and a new yellow lightsaber. Futterman was excited to portray a lighter version of the character.\n* Kath Soucie as Jek Lawquane: The stepson of clone deserter Cut Lawquane\n* Cara Pifko as Suu Lawquane: The wife of clone deserter Cut Lawquane\n* Ming-Na Wen as Fennec Shand: An elite mercenary and sniper\n* Brigitte Kali as Trace Martez: An ex-smuggler turned freedom fighter and Rafa's younger sister\n* Elizabeth Rodriguez as Rafa Martez: An ex-smuggler turned freedom fighter and Trace's older sister\n* Corey Burton as\n** Cad Bane: An infamous bounty hunter\n** Gobi Glie: One of Cham Syndulla's freedom fighters and an uncle-figure for Hera Syndulla\n* Seth Green as Todo 360: Cad Bane's service droid\n* Rena Owen as Taun We: A Kaminoan aide to Lama Su\n* Robin Atkin Downes as Cham Syndulla: A famous Twi'lek freedom fighter and the father of Hera Syndulla\n* Vanessa Marshall as Hera Syndulla:The daughter of Cham Syndulla who is an aspiring pilot and freedom fighter. Marshall previously starred as an older version of Hera in the series Star Wars Rebels, in which she generally used an American accent for the character. However, that series revealed in a key scene that Hera originally had a French accent—representing the native accent of the planet Ryloth—like Cham and other Twi'lek characters do, but she lost this after going off on her own path. Marshall, who is fluent in French, was able to use Hera's native accent for the younger version of the character in The Bad Batch, and also adjusted her voice performance to portray a teenager.\n* Phil LaMarr as\n** Orn Free Taa: The corrupt Imperial senator of Ryloth\n** Bail Organa: The Imperial senator from Alderaan who secretly resists the Empire\n* Dave Filoni as Chopper: Hera's irritable astromech droid.

A new animated series, Star Wars Rebels, was prioritized. Lucasfilm said some unfinished episodes of The Clone Wars would still be released as \"bonus content\", including a four episode arc that introduces a squad of clone troopers with genetic mutations known as the Bad Batch. The idea for this story came directly from Star Wars creator George Lucas. The four episodes were shown as unfinished story reels at Star Wars Celebration Anaheim in April 2015. By September 2016, The Clone Wars and Rebels supervising director Dave Filoni had stepped back from that position on Rebels so he could focus on writing that series and on developing future Star Wars series with Lucasfilm Animation.\nIn July 2018, Filoni announced that a final season of The Clone Wars was being produced for the new streaming service Disney+. The unfinished Bad Batch episodes were completed for the season, with some changes, while development on a spin-off series focused on the Bad Batch began at the same time. Disney+ announced the spin-off series, titled Star Wars: The Bad Batch, in July 2020. The announcement described the series as being Filoni's vision, and he was executive producing alongside Lucasfilm's Athena Portillo, supervising director Brad Rau, and head writer Jennifer Corbett, with Lucasfilm's Carrie Beck and Josh Rimes as co-executive producer and producer, respectively. Filoni described the series as being \"very much in the vein\" of The Clone Wars and said it would stay true to Lucas's vision for that series of telling epic, exciting adventure stories.\nA second season was announced in August 2021, before the first-season finale was released. At Star Wars Celebration London in April 2023, a third and final season was announced. The producers intended to tell a three-season story from the beginning and were glad to be able to complete their plans as intended. Rau said the series would end the Bad Batch's story, but would not be the end of the \"Clone Wars universe\".\nCasting and voice recording\nvoices the Bad Batch and other clones in the series.]]\nThe first trailer for the series, which was released in December 2020, confirmed that Dee Bradley Baker would return from The Clone Wars as the voice of all the clone troopers, including the members of the Bad Batch, Captain Rex, and many others. Baker replaced New Zealand actor Temuera Morrison, who portrayed the clones—as well as the bounty hunter Jango Fett whose genetic material the clones are created from—in the Star Wars prequel films. Also starring in The Bad Batch is Michelle Ang as Omega, a young female clone of Jango Fett. Ang was cast in-part because her New Zealand accent aligns with Morrison's, and she was grateful for the opportunity to embrace that side of her identity considering she does not look like \"what the world thinks of when they think New Zealander\" as a person of Chinese and Malaysian descent. Baker and Ang recorded the first episode of the series together, but other work commitments forced Ang to travel home to New Zealand soon after and the COVID-19 pandemic prevented her from returning to record with Baker for many subsequent episodes. Ang instead recorded much of her dialogue for the series remotely over video calls. Ang and Baker were able to record the series finale together in-person, which they said was an emotional experience for them and the crew.\nEmerie Karr, an adult female clone, is introduced in the second season. Voice actor Keisha Castle-Hughes was not told that Emerie is a clone at first, but she suspected that the character was related to Omega after the producers asked her to use her natural New Zealand accent for the role. Castle-Hughes previously had a brief non-speaking role as Queen Apailana in the film Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). Daniel Logan, who portrayed Boba Fett and other young male clones in the prequel films and The Clone Wars, returned to voice a younger clone named Mox in the third season of The Bad Batch. Mox is accompanied by two even younger clones, Deke and Stak, who are voiced by Logan's fellow New Zealand actor Julian Dennison.\nA younger version of the character Fennec Shand from The Mandalorian was revealed to be appearing in the series with the first trailer's release, and actress Ming-Na Wen soon confirmed that she would reprise her role as Shand. The trailer also revealed that Stephen Stanton and Andrew Kishino were reprising their respective The Clone Wars roles as Tarkin and Saw Gerrera. Other actors who reprised roles from The Clone Wars in the first season include Ben Diskin as AZI-3; Matthew Wood as the battle droids; Bob Bergen as Lama Su; Gwendoline Yeo as Nala Se; Nika Futterman, Kath Soucie, and Cara Pifko as the family of clone deserter Cut Lawquane; Brigitte Kali and Elizabeth Rodriguez as the Martez sisters; Corey Burton as Cad Bane and Seth Green as Bane's droid Todo 360; and Tom Kane, who narrated the opening of each The Clone Wars episode, provided similar narration for The Bad Batch premiere episode.\nReprising roles from the Star Wars films in the first season are Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine, Wood as Bib Fortuna, and Rena Owen as Taun We. The producers knew early in development that the first episode would begin with a retelling of Order 66 from the perspective of the Bad Batch, and decided to include the Jedi Depa Billaba and Caleb Dume since many viewers would already be familiar with the latter from Rebels, where he is known as Kanan Jarrus. The two characters had brief non-speaking appearances in the final season of The Clone Wars before appearing in The Bad Batch, with Archie Panjabi cast as Billaba. The producers considered casting a new young voice actor as Caleb before Filoni reached out to Kanan actor Freddie Prinze Jr. about reprising his role. Rau felt Prinze was able to bring the right energy for the younger version of the character, as well as added emotion due to his connection to Kanan. Later in the season, a young version of the Rebels character Hera Syndulla is introduced with Vanessa Marshall reprising her role. This storyline includes some related characters returning from The Clone Wars or Rebels: Robin Atkin Downes as Hera's father Cham, Burton as Gobi Glie, Phil LaMarr as Orn Free Taa, and Filoni as Hera's droid Chopper who is credited as playing \"Himself\". Hera's mother Eleni, who was only mentioned in Rebels, is introduced in The Bad Batch voiced by Ferelith Young. Also introduced in the season are Noshir Dalal as Vice Admiral Rampart and Rhea Perlman as Cid.\nIn December 2022, Wanda Sykes was revealed to have been cast in the guest role of Phee Genoa for the second season. The season also introduces Jimmi Simpson as Dr. Hemlock, who replaces Rampart as the primary antagonist of the series. Reprising roles from The Clone Wars in the second season are Stanton as Mas Amedda, Jennifer Hale as Riyo Chuchi, LaMarr as Bail Organa, and Jameelah McMillan as Halle Burtoni. The season also features several actors reprising their roles from the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016): Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Tynnra Pamlo, Andy de la Tour as Hurst Romodi, and Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic. For the third season, Futterman reprises her The Clone Wars role as Asajj Ventress. The producers wanted to cast child actors for the young Project Necromancer test subjects that are introduced in the season. Ivan Sinitsin was cast as Jax, Olwyn M. Whelan as Eva, and Naiya Singh Padilla as Sami. Shelby Young, who had several guest roles in the series, provided vocals for the baby test subject Bayrn.\nMusic\nKevin Kiner was confirmed to be composing the score for the series in January 2021, after previously doing so for The Clone Wars and Rebels. As with the other animated Star Wars series, Kevin collaborated with his children Sean and Deana. David Glen Russell and Peter Lam also provided additional music. Sean and Deana Kiner are credited as co-composers with Kevin Kiner for the third season.\nKevin described the score for The Bad Batch as a continuation of his work on The Clone Wars, using a mix of electronic and orchestral music, and said it would continue to evolve just as the music of The Clone Wars evolved over its run. He took influence from the scores for The Guns of Navarone (1961) and The Dirty Dozen (1967) which both feature a similar band of heroes to the Bad Batch.\nWalt Disney Records released the first track from the series' score, titled \"Enter the Bad Batch\", as a digital single on May 13, 2021. The label then released Kiner's score for the series in two-volume soundtrack albums for each season: music from the first eight episodes of the first season was released on June 25; from the final eight episodes of the first season on August 20; from the first eight episodes of the second season on February 17, 2023; from the final eight episodes of the second season on April 7; from the first eight episodes of the third season on March 29, 2024; and from the final seven episodes of the third season on May 3.\nMarketing\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy promoted the series at Disney's Investor Day event on December 10, 2020, revealing the first trailer for the series. Jacob Oller of Syfy Wire felt the trailer made the series look like a more action-heavy version of The Clone Wars, and compared it to the 1980s television series The A-Team. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were also added to the mobile role-playing game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes as unlockable, playable characters.\nRelease\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2021, which is Star Wars Day, with a special 70-minute episode. The rest of the 16-episode first season was released until August 13. The 16-episode second season was released from January 4 to March 29, 2023; it was originally expected to premiere on September 28, 2022. The final 15-episode season was released from February 21 to May 1, 2024.\nReception\nViewership\nWhip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 1 million daily users of its TV Time app, calculated that Star Wars: The Bad Batch was the most anticipated new television series in May 2021. It later ranked as the fourth most anticipated returning series in September 2022. Nielsen Media Research, which records streaming viewership on U.S. television screens, estimated that Star Wars: The Bad Batch was watched for 251 million minutes, making it the seventh most streamed original series, from May 3—9, 2021. According to Whip Media's TV Time viewership tracking app, the series ranked as the third most streamed original series across all platforms for five consecutive weeks, from January 8 to February 5, 2023. It subsequently remained within the top ten rankings from February 12 to March 19. Nielsen Media Research announced in 2022 that Star Wars: The Bad Batch and What If...? each appeared on its streaming charts for a combined total of seven weeks from May to October, collectively accumulating approximately 2 billion minutes of viewing time. Luminate, which measures streaming performance by analyzing viewership data, audience engagement metrics, and content reach across various platforms, calculated that Star Wars: The Bad Batch was watched for 923 million minutes in 2024.\nCritical response\n| metacritic1      = 67 (9 reviews)\n| rotten_tomatoes2 = 90% (21 reviews)\n| metacritic2      =\n| rotten_tomatoes3 = 88% (17 reviews)\n| metacritic3      = 68 (4 reviews)\n}}\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating with an average rating of 7.3/10, based on 92 reviews for the first season. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Bad Batch beautifully animated adventure may be too lore heavy for casual viewers, but fans will enjoy diving deeper into this dastardly cast of characters.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 67 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The second season has an 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.2/10, based on 21 reviews. The website's critic consensus reads: \"The second bundle of The Bad Batch retains all the same virtues and vices as the first: a slick Star Wars adventure geared toward diehard fans at the expense of more casual viewers.\" The third season holds an 87% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.0/10, based on 15 reviews. The website's critic consensus reads: \"Mobilizing for one last hurrah with plenty of easter eggs and rousing action still left in its arsenal, The Bad Batch ends on a good note.\" On Metacritic, the third season has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 4 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nJoel Keller of Decider called the series a \"worthy\" spinoff of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and praised the introduction of Omega as a female main character, writing, \"Star Wars: The Bad Batch should satisfy Clone Wars fans and give completist fans of the franchise a chance to see what happened at the very beginning of the Empire.\" Joshua Rivera of Polygon gave the show a positive review and stated, \"The prequels are just as full of rich potential as the original Star Wars trilogy, and The Bad Batch, like The Clone Wars before it, is set to do a lot of slow, careful work to tease out that potential.\" Wenlei Ma of News.com.au gave the show a positive review and stated, \"The Bad Batch is catnip for the dedicated Star Wars fans. It's an animated action-adventure series with thrills, relatable characters on the right side of the war, blaster guns and enough lore and easter eggs to invoke a few excited squeals.\"\nVincent Schilling of Indian Country Today gave the show 8.5 out of 10 stars and stated, \"I'm not a superfan of Star Wars animated series, but I am impressed with this one, a team of certifiable rejects, each with their own skillset, is a winning formula for me – excellent actually.\" Jesse Schdeen of IGN gave the premiere episode an 8 out of 10 rating, stating that the series is \"a worthy successor to The Clone Wars, so much so that it could easily be rebranded as an eighth season\" and that \"it uses a loose end from that show to build a brand new story about the plight of clones after the war's end, and it's one that immediately resonates\". He also added that the show \"captures a lot of what made The Clone Wars so great (including the slick animation style and the vocal talents of Baker), but it doesn't entirely escape that show's flaws, either\". Julian Lytle of idobi.com gave the show 8 out of 10 stars and stated, \"The Bad Batch feels familiar but also starts a new journey with new characters in a cool setting. I can't wait to see what happens with this group in the Empire.\" Marty Brown of Common Sense Media gave the show 4 out of 5 stars and a '10+' age rating, stating, \"This series delivers on precisely what fans would expect from a Star Wars story: world building, unique new characters, and big action sequences with a moral allegory at the center.\"\nJonathan Roberts of The New Paper gave the show 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \"The Bad Batch is good to dip into, but it can make for a bad binge.\" Niv M. Sultan of Slant Magazine rated the series 1.5 out of 4 stars and stated, \"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes.\"\nKimberly Terasaki of The Mary Sue expressed concerns over the series \"whitewashing\" the clone troopers, writing that \"the designs of some characters seemed to make many of them lighter-skinned and/or with more European features... Long story short: clones of a character played by a Māori man had been white-washed.\" This concern was also noticed by fans, spawning a Twitter page, an Instagram page, and a Change.org petition. In response to these concerns, supervising director Brad Rau said the animation team had gone back through the produced episode and adjusted the skin tones of the clones to be closer to that of film actor Temuera Morrison.\nThe show has also received praise for its representation of people with disabilities. Emily Smith of Radio Times noted that prior to The Bad Batch, most disabilities in the Star Wars universe were associated with negativity, such as with antagonists Darth Vader and Darth Maul, who became amputees after combat. Other characters, like Luke Skywalker and Kanan Jarrus, were negatively affected after being injured by antagonists. In contrast, the original four Bad Batch characters were born with disabilities, which Smith said frees their disability from any connotation. Joshua Patton of CBR complimented the show for portraying a kid-friendly conversation about neurodivergency, highlighting a quote from Tech in season two, episode nine: \"I may process moments and thoughts differently, but that does not mean that I feel any less than you\".\nAccolades\nThe first season is one of 200 television series that received the ReFrame Stamp for the years 2021 to 2022.
