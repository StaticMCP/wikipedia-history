However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only the United Soccer Coaches poll was released.  No pre-season poll was released and a five team poll was released on September 22, 2020 as the first poll of the season.  The United Soccer Coaches resumed releasing a poll for the Spring Season on March 2, 2021.\nTop Drawer Soccer released a national ranking on February 1 for the Spring Season.  The ranking took into account records of teams that played in the fall.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in
