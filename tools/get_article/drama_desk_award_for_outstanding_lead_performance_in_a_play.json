From 1975 to 2022, acting awards were presented in eight categories: separate categories by gender; further divided by lead or featured performer; producing four acting awards each for plays and musicals.\nIn 2023, the Drama Desk organization announced that, starting with that year's awards, the eight acting categories had been retired and replaced with four gender neutral categories with twice the winners and nominees: separate categories by lead or featured performer; producing two acting categories each for plays and musicals. The former awards for Outstanding Actor in a Play and Outstanding Actress in a Play were merged to create this Outstanding Lead Performance in a Play category.\nWinners and nominees\n;Key\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Year\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Actor\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Title\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Character\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Ref.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"13\" |2023\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Sean Hayes\n|Good Night, Oscar\n|Oscar Levant\n|rowspan=12|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Jessica Chastain\n|'A Doll's House\n|Nora Helmer'\n|-\n|Hiran Abeysekera\n|Life of Pi\n|Pi\n|-\n|Kyle Beltran\n|A Case for the Existence of God\n|Keith\n|-\n|Will Brill\n|A Case for the Existence of God\n|Ryan\n|-\n|Brittany Bradford\n|Wedding Band\n|Julia Augustine\n|-\n|Sharon D.
