Included are details about Zevon's abusive behavior toward his ex-wife and children in the 1970s, his many sexual dalliances and his return to drinking and drug use after his diagnosis of incurable cancer. Extensive use is made of excerpts from Zevon's private journals, which are concerned largely with his sexual partners, music industry worries and his relationships with his children, Jordan and Ariel.\nThe book is interspersed with interviews conducted with 87 friends, lovers and collaborators, including Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Stephen King, Billy Bob Thornton and Bonnie Raitt. It is reputed that before his death Zevon gave the project his blessing and requested that the book be uncompromising in its honesty about even the most unflattering details.\nReferences"
