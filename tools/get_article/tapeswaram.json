The Uma Agastheswara Temple in Tapeswaram has a great importance and is believed to be constructed by Agasthya.\nCuisine\nTapeswaram is best known for its sweet delicacy called Kaja. The place is also famous for making the largest individual laddu. The place is also famous for various other sweets like Pootharekulu, Bobbatlu etc.\nTapeswaram Kaja\nThis variant, originating from Tapeshwaram, is also known as Madatha Kaja. It features a perfectly layered structure, made by rolling the maida-and-ghee dough into thin sheets, folding them into diamond shapes, and cutting them into smaller pieces before frying and soaking them in sugar syrup. Unlike the Gottam Kaja, this version retains sugar syrup within its layers. Although Madatha Kaja is slightly different from Tapeswaram Kaja—with the former being drier—it is often conflated with the latter.\nTransport\nSH 102 that runs between Dwarapudi and Yanam passes through Tapeswaram. This road also connects Tapeswaram to Mandapeta.\nThe nearest railway station is at Dwarapudi which is 4.57&nbsp;km away.\nReferences"
