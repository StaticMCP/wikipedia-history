Matt Pana from Vents Magazine stated: \"What I love most about 'Talking In Your Sleep' is the hypnotic electronic bass line, alongside piano with a simple touch. As the song continues, you can feel a sense of desperation in chorus which captures the overall mood of the song. All in all, The Cinema is at it again with catchy hook evoking that reckless youth previously mentioned.\"\nRyan Gardner of AbsolutePunk awarded the album 7/10 stars and stated: \"The fun thing about The Cinema is how evident it is that Antelman and Malpass have so much fun doing it. As mentioned are songs in all areas of the spectrum here – the more mellow “Turn It On,” the hook driven “Ghost,” and the most flamboyant pop song with “Weekend.” Even the three part vocal melody on “Punchline” is something I haven’t really heard before. The album feels similar to My Blood Is Full of Airplane but also throws some unexpected segments – the guitar part near the end of “Talking In Your Sleep” – that break from the norm. The experimentation does have some missteps, but there’s still a little something here for everyone – fans of The Cinema’s previous record, Lydia’s Devil, synth-heavy music, and pop music.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Leighton Antelman – vocals\n* Matt Malpass – programming, production\nReferences"
