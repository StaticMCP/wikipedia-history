Also, it is relatively easy to implement. However, there are a couple of shortcomings of historical simulation. Traditional historical simulation applies equal weight to all returns of the whole period; this is inconsistent with the diminishing predictability of data that are further away from the present.\nWeighted historical simulation\nWeighted historical simulation applies decreasing weights to returns that are further away from the present, which overcomes the inconsistency of historical simulation with diminishing predictability of data that are further away from the present. However, weighted historical simulation still assumes independent and identically distributed random variables (IID) asset returns.\nFiltered historical simulation\nFiltered historical simulation tries to capture volatility which is one of the causes for violation of IID.\nSee also\n*Monte Carlo methods in finance\n*Quasi-Monte Carlo methods in finance\n*Financial modeling\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.filteredhistoricalsimulation.com/ Filtered Historical Simulation]\n* Giovanni Barone-Adesi, Frederick Bourgoin, Kostas Giannopoulos (1998) [http://filteredhistoricalsimulation.com/downloads/Do_Not_Look_Back_Risk_1998_final.pdf Do Not Look Back]"
