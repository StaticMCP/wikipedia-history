      "text": "# Rethinking Mathematics\n\nRethinking Mathematics: Teaching Social Justice by the Numbers is a 2005 book (2nd edition 2013) edited by Eric Gutstein and Bob Peterson, advocating a mathematics education curriculum that intertwines mathematics with social justice. The various essays in the book, including \"Home Buying While Brown or Black\" and \"Sweatshop Accounting\", advocate using social-justice issues to motivate the teaching of rigorous mathematical concepts, and the use of mathematics education as a way of promoting ideas of social justice.\nCritics derided the work as an attempt to subvert mathematics education for partisan political purposes, while the authors defended it as a useful way to motivate a wide range of students in mathematics.\nSee also\n* Critical mathematics pedagogy\n* Mathematics for social justice\n* Mathematics education\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rethinkingschools.org/math/ Book website]"
