During an attack by Aboriginals near the creek, Blythe was thrown from his horse and speared in the leg. He managed to escape and recovered from his wounds, but the attack caused him to give up the pastoral run. It was then taken up by W.P. Gordon and incorporated into his Wallumbilla pastoral run. Some years later John Christian (of the Hunter River District) purchased Tingun Station and installed his nephew Henry Cardell as his manager and partner. Cardell renamed the pastoral run Blythdale and the creek Blyth Creek in honour of Blythe.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Blythdale had a population of 39 people.\nIn the , the locality of Blythdale had a population of 47 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Blythdale.
