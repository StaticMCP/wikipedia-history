It was released on 21 July 1972; that year it became a UK number-one album (for two weeks) and reached number two on the US Album chart. The track \"You Wear It Well\", co-written by Stewart and classical guitarist Martin Quittenton, was a smash hit (another UK No. 1; in US No. 13), as well as \"Twisting the Night Away\", a song originally recorded (and written) by Sam Cooke.\nRecording\nThe album was recorded at  Morgan and Olympic, London between March and May 1972.\nLike many of Stewart's albums from the era, Never a Dull Moment features significant musical contributions from the members of the band Faces. Other guest musicians included Ray Jackson of the band Lindisfarne on mandolin, Spike Heatley on upright bass, Gordon Huntley on steel guitar, Dick Powell on violin and Pete Sears on piano and bass.\n\"Mama You Been on My Mind\" is a cover version of a Bob Dylan song. Stewart's version is one of the songs featured in Nick Hornby's book 31 Songs.\n\"Angel\" was written by Jimi Hendrix as a tribute to his mother. Hendrix and Ronnie Wood had shared a flat in the late 1960s, and were both at a Soho club on the night she died.\nRelease\nNever a Dull Moment was released on vinyl by Mercury Records on 21 July 1972.\nOn the 8-track tape and Cassette releases of the album the song \"What Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\" was on program 2 following \"Twistin' the Night Away\", but it was not mentioned in the song listing.\nReception\n|rev2 = ''Christgau's Record Guide\n|rev2Score = A−\n|rev3 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide''\n|rev3score =\n}}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Rod Stewart – vocals, acoustic guitar\n* Ronnie Wood – electric guitar, acoustic guitar, slide guitar, pedal steel guitar, bass guitar\n* Ronnie Lane – bass guitar on \"True Blue\", and \"Angel\"\n* Micky Waller – drums all songs except \"True Blue\"\n* Kenney Jones – drums on \"True Blue\"\n* Ian McLagan – Hammond organ, piano\n* Neemoi \"Speedy\" Aquaye – congas\n* Pete Sears – piano on “Italian Girls”, “What Made Milwaukee Famous” (single), bass guitar on “I’d Rather Go Blind”.\n* Brian – piano\n* Spike Heatley – upright bass\n* Dick Powell – violin\n* Martin Quittenton – acoustic guitar\n* Gordon Huntley – steel guitar\n* Ray Jackson – mandolin\n* Arrangeables on \"Twistin' the Night Away\" by Jimmy Horowitz\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1972-73)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n| align=\"center\"| 3\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Finnish Albums (The Official Finnish Charts)\n| align=\"center\"| 8\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Italian Albums (Musica e Dischi)\n|22\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon)\n| align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan)\n|4\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1972)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n|18\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (Album Top 100)\n|15\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC)\n|4\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
