It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\nCameraman Tom Stobart participated in the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition (as did George Lowe). After the successful second assault, Stobart told the descending party to provide no indication to the men waiting at the base that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had succeeded until they were close enough for Stobart to catch the emotion of the moment on film.\nReception\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"As one expected, this film is good. It has been most skilfully edited and is often intensely moving.\"\nHome media\nThe Conquest of Everest was released on Region 0 DVD-R by Alpha Video on 28 January 2014.\nSee also\n*List of media related to Mount Everest\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
