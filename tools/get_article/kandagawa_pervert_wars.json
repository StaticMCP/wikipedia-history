When she discovers what seems to be an incestuous relationship between a mother and son, she decides, with  her friend Masami, to rescue the son from this predicament and introduce him to a \"healthy sex life\".\nCast\n* Usagi Asō () as Akiko\n* Makoto Yoshino / Makoto Mino () as Masami\n* Houen Kishino () as the Son\n* Miiko Sawaki / Mimi Sawaki () as the Mother\n* Tatsuya Mori as Ryō (Akiko's Boyfriend)\n* Masayuki Suo as the Apartment Manager\nBackground\nKiyoshi Kurosawa was one of a number of young Japanese filmmakers, several associated with Nikkatsu, who belonged to a production organization called the Director's Company which had been founded in 1982. Through the influence of fellow Director's Company member Banmei Takahashi, Kiyoshi was offered a chance to direct a pink film for Million Film. This film became Kandagawa Pervert Wars with its references to Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, inventive directorial devices, playful mannerisms and in-joke allusions to Kurosawa's favorite western films. Jasper Sharp suggests that the studio was less than delighted with the result and Million shelved his second pink film effort College Girl: Shameful Seminar as not sexy enough. Kurosawa was able to buy the footage and reworked it into the 1985 non-pink film The Excitement of the Do-Re-Mi-Fa Girl.\nThe cast and staff of Kandagawa Pervert Wars present a kaleidoscope of figures who would become an important part of filmmaking in Japan in the 1990s and later. These include Assistant Director Toshiyuki Mizutani, Second Assistant Director Masayuki Suo who also had a minor role in the film, Third Assistant Director Akihiko Shiota, and actor Tatsuya Mori.\nRelease\nKandagawa Pervert Wars was released theatrically in Japan in August 1983 by Million Film and published as a DVD on April 26, 2004, by AceDeuce ().\nReception\nThomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser praised the \"witty dialogue and very likable characters\" and gave the film a 3 star rating (out of four).\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
