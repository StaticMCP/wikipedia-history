Most of the hired vessels were \"country ships\", British merchantmen which were registered in British Indian ports such as Bombay and Calcutta and traded in the East Indies but did not sail to Europe without special authorisation from the East India Company (EIC). The rest consisted of a mixture of EIC East Indiamen and \"extra ships\"; East Indiamen were on a long-term contract with the EIC, and extra ships were vessels the EIC had chartered for one or more voyages.\nThe data in the table below comes primarily from an 1814 report from a Select Committee of the House of Commons of the British Parliament, which provided the data only on country ships, giving the names of a large number of vessels, and their burthen (bm). Also, transliteration of non-English names shows no consistency across sources, making it extremely difficult to try to find more information about the vessels in question. The British government chartered some nine of these vessels as cartels to carry back to France the French troops that they had captured in these campaigns. An asterisk after the name in the table below designates the vessels.\nCountry ships\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Burthen\n! Where built\n!

It had intended to use East Indiamen about to sail from England to India and China. One suspects that the logistics of such an operation proved too daunting.\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*Reports and Papers on the Impolicy of Employing Indian Built Ships in the Trade of the East-India Company, and of Admitting Them to British Registry: With Observation on Its Injurious Consequences to the Landed and Shipping Interests, and to the Numerous Branches of Trade Dependent on the Building and Equipment of British-built Ships''.
