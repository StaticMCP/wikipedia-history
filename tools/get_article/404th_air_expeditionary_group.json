The 404 Group added, in provisional status, the 459th Expeditionary Air Medical Squadron.\nThe group forward-deploys when needed to facilitate air and support operations for varied missions, ranging from humanitarian airlift to presidential support. It deployed to Rwanda in January 2009 to airlift for United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur peacekeeping equipment. In July 2009, the 404th Group deployed to Ghana to provide aerial port and aircraft maintenance teams, along with forward communications, early warning, and air domain safety and security elements for U.S. President Barack Obama's visit.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nEstablished as the 100th Fighter Wing and organized in England in late 1943.  Assigned to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), IX Fighter Command, Ninth Air Force.  Began operational missions in April 1944, mission of the Wing was to receive operational orders from Headquarters, IX Fighter Command and direct subordinate groups in attacking enemy targets in Occupied France and the Low Countries in preparation for the Normandy Invasion in June 1944.    Targets included bridges, roads, railroads and enemy interceptor aircraft both on the ground as well as in air-to-air combat.\nAfter the D-Day invasion, was reassigned to IX Tactical Air Command and directed to provide ground support for advancing United States First Army forces in France, attacking enemy targets initially in the Cotentin Peninsula, then supported Operation Cobra, the breakout of Normandy and attacked enemy forces in the Falaise-Argentan Gap. Wing headquarters and subordinate units operated primarily from liberated airfields and newly built temporary Advanced Landing Grounds in France, moved into north-central France, its groups attacking enemy targets near Paris then north-west into Belgium and the southern Netherlands.   In December 1944/January 1945, engaged enemy targets on the north side of the Battle of the Bulge, then moved eastward into the Northern Rhineland as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany.\nSupported First Army as it crossed the Rhine River at Remagen then moved north to attack ground targets in the Ruhr, providing air support as Allied ground forces encircled enemy forces in the Ruhr Pocket, essentially ending organized enemy resistance in Western Germany.   First Army halted its advance at the Elbe River in late April 1945, the wing engaging targets of opportunity in enemy-controlled areas until combat was ended on 5 May 1945.\nIt remained in Europe for four months after VE Day, as part of United States Air Forces in Europe. It performed occupation duty and the destruction or shipment to the United States of captured enemy combat equipment - Operation Lusty. It was inactivated in Germany in August 1945.\nFrom 1957\nThe 704th Strategic Missile Wing activated on 1 July 1957 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, but was not operational until mid-November 1957. While it had two operational squadrons, its task was training on the SM-65 Atlas, PGM-19 Jupiter, and the PGM-17 Thor from November 1957 – April 1959. Not operational 6 April – 1 July 1959. The wing then was redesignated as the 404th Tactical Missile Wing on 31 July 1985.\nAs an air expeditionary unit, it has been activated and inactivated on several occasions by USAFE from 2003 to 2008. In June–July 2003 it was activated at RAF Mildenhall, UK. It was part of the 323d Air Expeditionary Wing from 14 March – 30 April 2008 at Balotești, Romania, when the 323th Wing served briefly as the USAF headquarters for the 2008 Bucharest summit. During the deployment to Romania, the 404th Group with the 404th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron prepared the airfield of Câmpia Turzii for the F-15 fighters which were to be stationed there.\nThe wing was attached to Seventeenth Air Force (Air Forces Africa) until 17th AF was disestablished.\nThe wing was listed in the AF Almanac for 2013.[https://www.airandspaceforces.com/PDF/MagazineArchive/Magazine/2013/0513fullissue.pdf]\nOperations and decorations\n* Combat Operations: Combat in European Theater of Operations (ETO), 15 April 1944-May 1945.\n* Campaigns: Air Offensive, Europe;
