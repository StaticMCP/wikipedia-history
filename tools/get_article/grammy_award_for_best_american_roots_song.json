Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nThe award was first approved by the board of trustees of the Grammy Awards in Spring 2013.\nAs with all other songwriting awards at the Grammy's, the award for Best American Roots Song goes to the songwriters of the winning song, not to the artist(s) (except if the artist is also the songwriter).\nThe award was first presented at the 2014 Grammy Awards ceremony to Edie Brickell and Steve Martin, the songwriters of the awarded song. Jason Isbell is the only person who has won this award more than once, with three wins (as of 2024).\nRecipients\nreceived the inaugural award alongside collaborator Steve Martin.]]\n(right) has received the award twice.]]\nwon the award in 2017.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"15%\" | Recipient(s)\n! width=\"15%\" | Work\n! width=\"15%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"30%\" class=unsortable|Nominees(Performer(s) in parentheses)\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! 2014\n| Edie Brickell and Steve Martin\n| \"Love Has Come for You\"\n| Steve Martin & Edie Brickell\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2015\n| Rosanne Cash & John Leventhal\n| \"A Feather's Not a Bird\"\n| Rosanne Cash\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2016\n| Jason Isbell\n| \"24 Frames\"\n| Jason Isbell\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2017\n| Vince Gill\n| \"Kid Sister\"\n| The Time Jumpers\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2018\n| Jason Isbell\n| \"If We Were Vampires\"\n| Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2019\n| Brandi Carlile, Dave Cobb, Phil and Tim Hanseroth\n| \"The Joke\"\n| Brandi Carlile\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2020\n| Sarah Jarosz, Aoife O'Donovan & Sara Watkins\n| \"Call My Name\"\n| I'm with Her\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2021\n| Pat McLaughlin & John Prine\n| \"I Remember Everything\"\n| John Prine (posthumous)\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2022\n|Jon Batiste & Steve McEwan\n|\"Cry\"\n|Jon Batiste\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2023\n| Bonnie Raitt\n| \"Just Like That\"\n| Bonnie Raitt\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! 2024\n|Jason Isbell\n|\"Cast Iron Skillet\"\n| Jason Isbell & the 400 Unit\n|\n* Michael Trotter Jr. & Tanya Trotter for \"Blank Page\" (The War and Treaty)\n* Aaron Allen, William Apostol & Jon Weisberger for \"California Sober\" (Billy Strings ft.
