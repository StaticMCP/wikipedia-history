It was first minted in aluminium, and then from 1942 to 1947 in zinc. The aluminium 2 øre is identical to the zinc variety, although the latter is a little heavier in weight.\nMintage\n;1941 aluminium\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Mintage\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n|1941\n|26,205,000\n|\n|}\n;1942-1947 zinc\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Mintage\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n|1942\n|12,934,000\n|\n|-\n|1943\n|9,603,000\n|\n|-\n|1944\n|60,60,000\n|\n|-\n|1945\n|329,000\n|Rare\n|-\n|1947\n|589,000\n|Rare\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Denmark 2 ore 1943 obverse.jpg|A zinc Danish 2 øre coin from 1943.
