Protests were held in dozens of cities throughout the United States. Demonstrations were also held outside London's Houses of Parliament.\nThe marches were mostly coordinated through Facebook. Organizers of the protest stated that although Trump was the president, they wanted to show that he did not represent their values. Los Angeles was the first city to plan a \"Not My Presidents Day\" rally, which was attended by more than a thousand protesters. New York City saw the largest demonstration, with an estimated 10,000 to 13,000 people attending a rally outside Trump International Hotel and Tower. The events were mostly peaceful, although thirteen people were arrested in Portland, Oregon.\nPreparation and planning\nThe \"Not My Presidents Day\" protests were mostly coordinated through Facebook, like the original event in Los Angeles, whose details were spread through social media, inspiring other rallies. Before some rallies, there was a poster-making session.\nThe artist's collective, Bad and Nasty, helped coordinate events for \"Not My Presidents Day\". Holly Hughes helped create Bad and Nasty via social media. Hughes told MTV News, \"I made an idle threat on Facebook [...] I would gather the Bad Hombres and Nasty Women of Ann Arbor together at a dive bar for performance on NOT My President's Day. And overnight more than a thousand people wanted in!\" Other women involved in planning Bad and Nasty events were Lois Weaver and Mary Jo Watts. In Minneapolis, Bad and Nasty was involved with a performance called \"This Machine\", planning well in advance of February 20, 2017. The University of California, Riverside, also planned a Bad and Nasty event for President's Day.\nThe Women's March committee of New York city also aided in planning for Not My Presidents Day.\nLocations and activities\n}}\nThere were about 400 protesters in Atlanta, where a peaceful demonstration called \"ImPEACH Now!

A 66-year-old woman was also tackled and hurt by the police when she attempted to shield her 72-year-old friend from being pushed.

The adults were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct in the second degree, with one man also being charged with resisting arrest and giving false information to the police.\nThe next day, there was a small demonstration in front of Portland mayor Ted Wheeler's house to protest the arrests. The group protesting outside Wheeler's home had obtained a permit for the demonstration, however, the organizer, Gregory McKelvey, also said that the mayor is \"perpetuating this idea we only get hurt or sprayed or physically beat because we don't have a permit\". Wheeler later issued a statement in which he said that mistakes were made by the police during the event. He also said, \"Yesterday we saw images of a woman in her sixties injured during an arrest. That isn't good for democracy either.\" The ACLU condemned the actions of Portland police and asked that the force \"end the violence against protesters.

A Trump supporter in Port Richey told protesters, \"He's our president. He was elected,\" and told WTSP News, \"I feel like if they don't like what's going on, go ahead and move.\" Another in San Diego said he went to the rally to support the president: \"[Trump] needs support where other people go against him, even if it's just one person at that moment.\"\nIn Atlanta, two women involved in the protest were struck by eggs thrown by three men in a pickup truck. In Pueblo, motorists shouted obscenities at protesters, with one person telling demonstrators to \"get a job\". In Washington, D.C., two bikers for Trump surrounded the demonstration and attempted to drown out speakers by revving their motorcycle engines. A man standing in front of the White House with a megaphone yelled at the marchers to \"Leave Trump alone!\" The ACLU tweeted that the arrests of peaceful protesters in Portland was \"shameful\". The organization also advised Mayor Wheeler to \"revise crowd-control strategies\".\nOverall, participants of \"Not My Presidents Day\" said that it was important to express themselves. Jenna Karvunidis, an organizer in Pasadena, said, \"I'd like to show my children that you do have a right to speak out against something that's unfair.\" Will Allen in Washington, D.C., chose to protest the \"incompetence of the Trump Administration\". Mercedes Vizcaino of New York said, \"I think it's important to take a stand and not be complicit about what's going on in the country.\" According to the Christian Science Monitor, most protesters felt that Trump did not represent them.\nImpact\nOrganizers of the \"Not My Presidents Day\" events wanted to keep up the momentum of the resistance against Trump. Many of the newer organizers for events gained experience in working with a large number of people.\nThe event allowed individuals to \"channel\" their negative feelings about the Trump administration into something creative and positive. Susan Thames, in Williamsburg, told WAVY-TV that \"the rally gave her the sense of being a part of a larger movement\".\nParticipants of the rally in Austin wanted to use \"Not My Presidents Day\" to educate others and hoped that more people would get involved with expressing their political opinions. Amanda Barta, who organized the rally, said, \"if you're loud enough, if we vocalize something enough, if you come together enough, things can change\".\nSee also\n*50501 movement  movement which held protests on President's Day in 2025, during Trump's second term\n** 50501 protests in February 2025\nReferences\nExternal links\n* , AP Archive (February 25, 2017)"
