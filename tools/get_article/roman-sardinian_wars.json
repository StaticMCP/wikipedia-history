These wars pitted the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire against the major Sardinian tribes: the Ilienses (later Ioles or Diagesbes), the Balares and the Corsi (located in today's Gallura), in a struggle for control of the coastal cities.\nThe island, especially the mountainous interior (also known as Barbaria, \"land of the Barbarians\"), was never completely pacified by the Romans. In contrast, the coasts and the plains, known as Romania (\"land of the Romans\"), were significantly influenced by the Romans during their centuries of dominion. The Roman presence was eventually eroded by the arrival of the Vandals; however, these new invaders were likewise unable to take control of the interior and consequently settled in the coastal cities for at least 80 years. The Byzantines then arrived in Sardinia, struggling with the peoples of Barbaria for a period, before finally signing a peace treaty with Hospiton, chief of the Ilienses.\nReferences\nCitations\nSee also\n*Sardinia and Corsica"
