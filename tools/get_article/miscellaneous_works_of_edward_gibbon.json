Various elements of the MW, as well as other Gibbon writings not contained therein, are listed below along with their pertinent bibliographical detail and descriptive text where available. Notes and letters from Sheffield were also included in the MW, but only Gibbon's writings follow here.  Listed contents are exactly those from each volume's table as they appear in the Google Books  digitized copies.  Links to those copies are provided below. Where publisher and year follows a work the reference is to the year of its first publication apart from the MW. A year following alone (with or without a scholar's name) refers to the year of Gibbon's composition. An asterisk [*] denotes that the work can be found in Craddock, EEEG (see References).\nThe Miscellaneous Works\n* FIRST edition: 2 vols. quarto (London: A. Strahan, T. Cadell, Jr. & W. Davies, March 31, 1796).\n** Volume I:\n*** Memoirs of my Life and Writings. independently, and likely pirated as, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Edward Gibbon, Esq., 2 vols. duodecimo (London: Hunt & Clarke, 1827). [https://books.google.com/books?id=VWcNAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22edward+gibbon%22&pg=PR3 online: 1898 edition, O.F. Emerson, ed.] incomplete portions of six \"drafts\" lettered A–F. Sheffield aggressively edited both the Memoirs and the MW in order to reflect Gibbon's anti-French Revolutionary sentiment while also downplaying his connection with Edmund Burke's eschatological interpretation; to prevent any further enlargement of Gibbon's reputation for harboring \"irreligion\" or atheism; and for other purposes of a more personal nature. In 1966, Georges Bonnard published a composite collection chronologically arranged, \"built on the same general lines\" as Sheffield's, along with a thoroughly informative account of the historical background. The drafts were not printed in their unedited entireties until 1896.\n*** Letters from Gibbon to Sheffield et al.;\n*** Letters to and from Edward Gibbon.  Letter No. IX is Gibbon's \"Lettre sur le gouvernement de Berne.\"  see SECOND edition, Vol. II below.\n** Volume II:\n*** Abstract of the Books Mr. Gibbon read – with Reflections,\n*** Extracts from his Journal,\n*** A Collection of his Remarks, and detached Pieces, on different Subjects,\n*** Outlines of the History of the World (1771 Craddock; 1784 Ghosh)*;\n*** ''Essai sur l'Étude de la Littérature'' (à Londres: T. Becket & P.A. De Hondt, 1761; Paris: Chez Duchesne, 1762); first English translation (London: T. Becket & P.A. De Hondt, 1764). Gibbon's first published work, an invaluable introduction to the Decline and Fall, defends the érudits (antiquarian scholars) against French philosophes (especially D'Alembert in his ''Discours préliminaire à l'Encyclopédie [1751]) who had \"contemptuously\" assailed the érudits'' work as inferior, parochial, and effete. Gibbon recoiled at the charges, and strove to reconcile the two groups by \"proving...that all the faculties of the mind may be exercised and displayed by [the] study of ancient litterature [sic].\" The Essai was reviewed with \"cold indifference\" in England, but on the continent, it was met enthusiastically. In Paris, Gibbon was recognized as a man of letters. Sheffield opted not to provide an English translation because the Becket & De Hondt (1764) already existed.Womersley, ODNB, p. 11; Norton, Biblio, p. 3. additional background in: Peter Ghosh, \"Gibbon's First Thoughts: Rome, Christianity and the ''Essai sur l'Étude de la Littérature 1758–61,\" Journal of Roman Studies 85(1995), 148–64; Pocock, EEG'', chapter 9, \"The ''Essai sur l'Étude de la Littérature'': imagination, irony and history,\" 208–39; Brian Norman, chapter 4 in \"The Influence of Switzerland on the Life and Writings of Edward Gibbon,\" Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century [SVEC] v.2002:03, (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 2002), 44–61.\n*** ''Critical Observations on the Design of the Sixth Book of [Virgil's] 'The Aenid (London: P.

[recommending Mr. John Pinkerton [to publish] the 'Scriptores Rerum Anglicarum', our Latin Memorials of the Middle Ages] (1793)* as An Address &c.'' a well-conceived, persuasive plan to publish what Gibbon saw as a glaring deficiency in the English archives, i.e., the collected works of all English historians from 500 to 1500 A.D., including \"the most ancient of our national writers\" through the onset of David Hume's \"true and perfect Æra of modern history.\" The deficiency grew all the more conspicuous when contrasted with similar projects already successfully carried out in Germany, Italy, France, and Denmark. The brief work strongly recommends Scot historian and poet John Pinkerton to head the project; an editor, Gibbon writes, \"replete with a variety of knowledge,\" and \"well qualified for this study, by a spirit of Criticism, acute discerning and suspicious.\" For his part, Gibbon was prepared to contribute a general introduction and author-specific prefaces.\nThe first edition was \"pirated\" and reprinted twice in 1796, in Ireland and Switzerland:\n* 3 vols. octavo (Dublin: P. Wogan, L. White et al.), adds  only a \"long note in French on Mme de Sévery\" in vol. 1 at pp.&nbsp;277–78. vol. 1: [https://books.google.com/books?id=21ouoSPNw40C&pg=PR1 online]. includes Memoirs of my Life and Writings; Appendix (Letters to and from Gibbon). vol. 2: [https://books.google.com/books?id=JPw3-gLvWcMC&dq=%22edward+gibbon%22&pg=PR3 online].

Employing language undeniably influenced by Montesquieu, Gibbon observes that Bern in adopting an oligarchic form similar to the Venetian, has omitted any incorporation of the separation of powers, in doing so has ignored the \"principles of liberty,\" and therefore stands on the brink of despotism. Pocock identifies the Lettre as Gibbon's \"first essay on empire in the context of European history.\" By this time, Gibbon has clearly adopted erudition as \"the dominant interest of his young and his mature life.\" Sheffield's preface intones, \"The excellence of this curious paper will apologize for its great length.\" (31 octavo pages including translation).\n** Volume III, Historical and Critical:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=VKPh3XzkVL0C&dq=%22miscellaneous+works+of+edward+gibbon%22&pg=PA1 online]\n*** Outlines of the History of the World;\n*** Mémoire sur la Monarchie de Mèdes (1768);\n*** ''Les Principales Epoques de l'Histoire de la Grèce et de l'Egypte, suivant Sir Isaac Newton (1758);\n*** Extrait de trois Mémoires de M.
