The Frankish armies advanced into the area of the Slavic tribal union in three groups - Alamanni, Lombards, and Austrasian Franks. The first two were quite successful, but the main fighting force was defeated in a three-day siege near a place referred to as Wogastisburg.\nThe location of the siege has not been determined because the primary source, Fredegar's chronicle, gives no geographical specifications. Several places claim to be connected with the battle (usually based on linguistic parallels and some excavations), for example Rubín hill near Podbořany (Bohemia), Úhošť hill near Kadaň (Bohemia), Bratislava (Slovakia), Trenčín (Slovakia), Beckov (Slovakia), Váh river near Voga (Slovakia), Staffelberg near Bad Staffelstein (Upper Franconia), and Burk near Forchheim (Upper Franconia), Vienna, Augustianis.\nIn fact, there is no conclusive evidence for any of these locations and it is even possible that the term Wogastisburg referred only to a kind of temporary encampment rather than a permanent settlement, in which case establishing a definite location would be impossible.\nNotes\nReferences"
