From 2002 to 2011, the presidency and the positions of the two vice-presidents were rotated between the three Comoro Islands – Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mohéli. From 2011 to 2019, there were three vice-presidents, one from each of the islands in the Union of the Comoros. The positions of vice-presidents were abolished as part of the implementation of constitutional referendum held in 2018 in May 2019, instead designating a \"main minister\" and the governors of the islands as successors to become acting president.\nList of officeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!
