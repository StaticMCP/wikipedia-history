It considers itself to be the continuation of the historical Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI), established in 1947.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn November 2011 a group of splinters from the 2004 re-foundation of the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) launched \"The Social Democrats – Federalists for the Euromediterranean\", simply known as \"The Social Democrats\" (iSD). Its leader was Mimmo Magistro, who had been the secretary of the PSDI from 2007 to July 2011, when a tribunal in Rome declared Renato D'Andria, who had been elected secretary in 2006 only to see his election invalidated by the party, legitimate secretary of the party. Magistro proposed a reconciliation between the two factions, but D'Andria refused. Thus, Magistro as well as 28 members out of 31 of the outgoing national council left the PSDI and formed the new party. Members of iSD came mostly from the PSDI but also from the Italian Socialist Party and the libertarian factions of the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity.\nIn January 2012, on the 65th anniversary of the split of Palazzo Barberini, the PSDI and iSD organized a joint event remembering Giuseppe Saragat, founder and long-standing leader of the original PSDI. A recomposition of the two groups looked possible, but was made difficult by the fact that D'Andria was keen on an alliance with the centre-right (three MPs of The People of Freedom – Massimo Baldini, Giancarlo Lehner and Paolo Russo – were quite close to the new PSDI), while Magistro had aligned iSD with the centre-left.\nFoundation and early years\nIn the July 2022 \"Social Democracy\" (SD), a new party in the tradition of the old PSDI, was established. In the same month the party held its first national conference during which Umberto Costi was appointed secretary, Dino Madaudo president and Magistro honorary president. In addition to several former activists from the PSDI, the new party was joined by Antonio Matasso, leader of the Sicilian Socialist Party, which became the regional secretary of the party in Sicily. Magistro would return to the PSDI by 2023.\nSD, which initially wanted to contest the 2022 Italian general election as part of the centre-left, enlarged to include centrist individuals, favoured the autonomy of its regional sections and aimed to promote a new socialist constituent assembly. Finally, in the run-up of the general election, the party joined forces with Italia Viva and Action, aiming to represent the left-wing of the Action – Italia Viva electoral list. In the 2024 European Parliament election the party supported the United States of Europe electoral list.\nDuring the 2025 national congress, Crosti was confirmed secretary and Antonio Esposito was elected president.\nIdeology\nThe party adheres to the ideas of social democracy and democratic socialism. As a supporter of internationalism and pro-Europeanism, the party is committed to maintaining Italy in the geopolitical cadre of advanced liberal democracies.\nLeadership\n*Secretary: Umberto Costi (2022–present)\n*President: Dino Madaudo (2022–2025), Antonio Esposito (2025–present)\n*Honorary President: Mimmo Magistro (2022)\nElection results\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
