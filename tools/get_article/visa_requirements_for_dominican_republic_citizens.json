Along with Cuba and Haiti the Dominican republic passport is considered the weakest passport in Latin America for traveling. Despite several promises by the Government the Dominican Republic still doesn't have the biometric passport. In June 2024 the Government again promised the beginning of introduction of the biometric passports for February 2025. In January 2025 the president of the Dominican Republic Luis Abinader announced that the first biometric passports are expected to be introduced in August 2025. In May 2025 the Passport's General Directory announced that the biometric passports  will be introduced by the end of 2025. On 3 September 2025 the president of the Dominican republic Luis Abinader again announced that the biometric passports might be introduced by October 2025. As of November 2025 despite multiple promises by the government and the president of the Dominican republic the biometric passports are not available and any date of their introduction is unknown.\nDominican Republic citizens are among only a few Latin American nations, such as Bolivia and Ecuador, that still do not enjoy a visa-free regime with the European Union.\nAs of 01 November 2025, holders of a Dominican Republic passport could travel to only 72 countries and territories without a travel visa or with a visa on arrival, ranking the Dominican Republic passport 71th (tied with Malawi) in terms of travel freedom, according to the Henley Passport Index.\nVisa requirements map\nVisa requirements\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\" style=\"background:#f8f9faff;\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Visa requirement\n!
