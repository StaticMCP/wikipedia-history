The referendum asked two questions: whether the monarchy should be retained after independence the following year, and whether the incumbent, Kigeli V, should remain King.\nThe result was a \"no\" to both questions from 80% of voters, with a 95% turnout. King Kigeli claimed the vote had been rigged.\nResults\nQuestion one\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||253,963||20.15\n|-\n|align=left|Against||1,006,339||79.85\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||14,329||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||1,274,631||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||1,337,342||95.31\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: [http://africanelections.tripod.com/rw.html African Elections Database]\n|}\nQuestion two\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||257,510||20.40\n|-\n|align=left|Against||1,004,655||79.60\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||11,526||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||1,273,691||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||1,337,342||95.24\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: [http://africanelections.tripod.com/rw.html African Elections Database]\n|}\nReferences"
