Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1936–1946, it is the headquarters for field operations in the national forest and is typical of projects carried out by the CCC on behalf of the Forest Service. It represents that era's shift in the Forest Service's architectural vision toward comprehensive site planning, as well as its policy evolution from custodial superintendence of the national forests toward active natural resource management.\nThe complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Grant County, Oregon\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
