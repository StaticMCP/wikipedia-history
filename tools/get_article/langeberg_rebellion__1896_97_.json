The Rebellion was triggered when the baTswana groups became suspicious about the intentions of the Cape Colonial government as they feared, justifiably, that they stood to lose land and were being marginalised in the growing market economy of the Cape.  The Langeberg Rebellion consisted of a series of revolts between December 1896 and August 1897 against British land annexations in the Griqualand area. The Rebellion was led by chiefs Kgosi Luka Jantjie and Kgosi Galeshewe of the Batlhaping and chief Toto Makgolokwe of the Batlharo.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mahala.co.za/culture/the-last-stand-of-a-south-african-hero/ The last stand of South African hero]\n* [http://www.thethinker.co.za/resources/thinker%2056.pdf/ Luka Jantjie, Galeshewe and Toto – their little known story of courage and bravery in defence of their people, land and livelihoods]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=5rZCDQAAQBAJ&q=luka+jantjie+chief+of%2F&pg=PA415 African Military History]\nReferences"
