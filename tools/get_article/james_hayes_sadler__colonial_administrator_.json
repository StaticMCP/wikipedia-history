In 1875, he married Rita Annie Smith (1856–1918), and had three sons.\nCareer\nHe rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Indian Army, with which he saw active service.\nIn 1893 and again from 1893–94, he was Chief political resident of the Persian Gulf (for Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the Trucial States). In 1898 he was appointed Consul-General of the British Protectorate on the Somali Coast. In 1902 he left what is now Somaliland to become Commissioner in Uganda, a position he held until 1907.\nOn 12 December 1905, Sadler was appointed the first governor of the British East African Protectorate, succeeding commissioner Donald William Stewart who died in office on 1 October 1905. In 1909 he was transferred to be Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Windward Islands and their Dependencies, a post he filled until 1914.\nHonours and awards\nAfter nomination by his father, he became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in December 1901, eventually resigning in 1921. He was appointed Companion, Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours, and appointed Knight Commander, Order of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) in 1907.\nReferences"
