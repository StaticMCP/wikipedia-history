It resulted in the death of President Machel and several Mozambican ministers. It was declared a National Heritage Site in 2006.\nThe monument was inaugurated by Joaquim Chissano and Nelson Mandela on 19 January 1999. It was constructed at a cost of $240,000 and incorporates some of the wreckage of the plane. Its central feature is 35 tubes of steel, symbolising the number of lives lost in the air crash, that create a wailing sound in the wind.\nA planned R11.2&nbsp;million upgrade was to add access roads, an amphitheater, a helipad and buildings.\nIn 2006 a nearby library with a collection of books in English and Portuguese was opened. A statue of Machel, donated by Norwegian anti-apartheid artists, was also erected at the site.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2861 Speech at the Unveiling of the Samora Machel Memorial by Nelson Mandela]"
