She was launched on 13 July 1770 at Chatham Dockyard, and completed there on 21 November 1770. She took part in the American Revolutionary War, enforcing the blockade of the Delaware Bay, and served in the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet, near Cape May, New Jersey. While under the temporary command of Lieutenant Hugh Christian, she was burnt by her own crew to avoid capture on 7 August 1778 in Narragansett Bay during the Battle of Rhode Island.\nService history\nKingfisher was commissioned in September 1770 under Commander Thomas Jordan, and sailed for North America on 1 August 1771. In September 1772 command passed to Commander Jacob Lobb, then on 9 April 1773 Commander George Montagu, (Her Captain on 1 January 1775 is listed as Cpt. Jas Montagu.)  and in November 1775 under Commander Alexander Graeme.\nNorfolk\nKingfisher under Commander Montagu arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 September 1775, along with  under Commander Graeme and  under Commander Matthew Squire. On 30 September 1775, the mayor and council of Norfolk wrote to Lord Dunmore about the \"illegal and riotous\" behaviour of the crews of Kingfisher and Otter.\nOn 1 January 1776, she began a heavy bombardment of Norfolk along with Liverpool and Otter, setting the town on fire.\nDelaware Bay\nIn early June 1776, while enforcing the blockade of the Delaware Bay, Commander Henry Bellew of  and Commander Graeme reported to Vice Admiral Molyneux Shuldham about their encounter with the American ships , , and .\nLater in the month, on the afternoon of 28 June 1776, Kingfisher spotted the American privateer  sailing toward Cape May and began chase, followed by  with Commander Charles Hudson.\nEarly on the morning of 29 June 1776, Kingfisher and Orpheus resumed chase.\nNancy, to evade capture of her supplies of gunpowder and arms, ran aground at Turtle Gut Inlet. She was assisted by the American ships Lexington, Reprisal, and .\nIn the ensuing battle, Nancy was set on fire and exploded, killing the master's mate and six men on longboats from Kingfisher. Also during 1776, Orpheus and Kingfisher captured the Adrian, which was sailing from Philadelphia to France with a cargo of tobacco, flour, bread and staves.\nNarragansett Bay\nOn 27 August 1777, Kingfisher under Commander Graeme engaged the newly built 14-gun Oliver Cromwell under Captain Samuel Chace, Jr., ran her ashore, and  burnt her. During the fight, the brigantine  escaped.\nOn 7 February 1778, Kingfisher under Lieutenant Hugh Christian was stationed in the Sakonnet Passage to Narragansett Bay. On 30 May, Christian led the boats of the squadron, which were carrying a detachment of troops, in an attack on the saw mills on a creek near Taunton River. The attack was successful.\nOn 18 March, 1778 she captured a sloop that was aground in Seaconnett Passage, Rhode Island. Unable to refloat her she was burned.\nBetween 29 May and 18 July, the British captured a number of vessels: the sloops Sally and Fancy, snow ''Baron D'Ozell, Olive Branch, sloop Betsey, and schooner Sally. Kingfisher'' shared the prize money with , , , and the galley  .\nFrench Admiral d'Estaing's squadron arrived in Narragansett Bay on 29 July 1778 to support the American army under General George Washington during the battle of Rhode Island. As Kingfisher lay in Sakonnet Passage, Christian moved her into Foglands Bay. There she landed all her guns and stores. On 30 July he and her crew abandoned her and set her on fire to prevent the French from capturing her. The Royal Navy ended up having to destroy ten of their own vessels in all.\nLieutenant Christian went on to command the armed ship Vigilant, of 20 guns and 150 men.\nSee also\n* Burning of Norfolk\n* Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet\n* Battle of Rhode Island\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Winfield, Rif, British Warships in the Age of Sail 1714–1792: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates.
