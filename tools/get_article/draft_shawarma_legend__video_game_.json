It was released on Microsoft Windows, Android and iOS on 19 July 2024. The game went viral in mainland China in late September and early October 2024, driven by short-video platforms and creator coverage.\nIn mid-October 2024 the game topped China’s iOS App Store free-games chart for multiple consecutive days, and briefly entered the global weekly Steam Top Sellers list (SteamDB), peaking around #20 in early October 2024.\nGameplay\nPlayers run a virtual shawarma shop: preparing and wrapping orders to satisfy customers, earning coins, and reinvesting in equipment, décor and capacity upgrades to scale the restaurant. The presentation uses humorous, hand-drawn cartoon art with a lighthearted tone, upbeat music and comedic voice lines. Progression unlocks new stations and ingredients, and late-game upgrades allow the shop to operate with a high degree of automation.\nDevelopment and release\nShawarma Legend was built with GameMaker Studio. Coverage notes that the art is hand-drawn by the developer; AI tools were used mainly for portions of the backgrounds and for music generation, and the release shipped with 14 languages (text and voice/localization).\nReception and impact\nIn China, the game trended across Douyin/Bilibili and other platforms and held the No. 1 position on the mainland App Store’s free-games chart for multiple days in mid-October 2024, as reported by local press and industry notes. Analytics outlets also highlighted its surge: AppMagic estimated about 3.56 million mobile downloads in September 2024 (≈2.93M on iOS; ≈637K on Google Play). The game also gained traction beyond China, with reports of sizeable audiences in the Middle East and Turkey. On PC, business media reported that the game entered SteamDB’s weekly Global Top Sellers list (Top 20) in early October 2024.\nCommercial performance and ratings\nAs of August 2025, the Android version’s Google Play listing displays 10,000,000+ installs and around 900,000 reviews at approximately 4.7/5 (figures may vary by country/locale).\nOn iOS, the global App Store listing shows an average rating of 4.8/5 from 98.1K ratings, while Apple’s mainland China App Store shows 4.8/5 from approximately 1.13 million ratings（113万 个评分）。\nSound and languages\nThe release includes multiple songs and voice/localization across 14 languages (including Arabic, English, Chinese, Turkish and German), which coverage credits as a factor in its cross-regional spread.\nSee also\n* Shawarma – a popular Middle Eastern street food of seasoned meat roasted on a vertical spit and served in flatbread; the dish has become globally popular with regional variations.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.patates-games.com/ Official website (Patates Games)]\nReferences"
