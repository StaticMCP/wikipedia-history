Based on the series, the game allows its players to portray original characters within the Red Dwarf universe. Player characters can be human survivors, holograms, \"evolved\" house pets (cats, dogs, iguanas, rabbits, rats and mice), various types of mechanoid (Series 4000, Hudzen 10 and Waxdroids in the corebook, Series 3000 in the Extra Bits Book) or GELFs (Kinatawowi and Pleasure GELF in the corebook, \"Vindaloovians\" in the Extra Bits Book).\nA total of three products were released for the game: the core 176-page rulebook, the AI Screen (analogous to the ''Game Master's Screen used in other RP games, also featuring the \"Extra Bits Book\" booklet) and the Series Sourcebook. The Series Sourcebook contains plot summaries of each episode from series I to VIII as well as game rules for all major and minor characters from each series.\nReception\nThe game has been praised for staying true to the comedic nature of the TV show, for its entertaining writing and for the detail to which the background material is explained. However, some reviewers found the game mechanics to be simplistic and uninspiring compared to other science-fiction RP games on the market.\nReviews\n*Pyramid''\nSee also\n*Card game\n*Board game\nReferences"
