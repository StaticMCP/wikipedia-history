Solutions to the equivalent problem of maximizing the minimum distance between  points in an isosceles right triangle, were known to be optimal for  and were extended up to .\nIn 2011 a heuristic algorithm found 18 improvements on previously known optima, the smallest of which was for .\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
