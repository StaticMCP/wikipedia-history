Following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, almost all airlines flying over the Baltics have experienced navigation problems. Aside from signal jamming, other forms of Russian hybrid aggression against countries like Finland, Poland, and Sweden described are violations of territorial waters and air space, and encouraging or permitting migrants from third countries to arrive at borders in large numbers through Russia and Belarus.\nIn October 2024, the head of MI5 Ken McCallum warned that Russian military intelligence were active in a campaign to \"generate mayhem\" on European and British streets using proxies that \"further reduces the professionalism of their operations\".\nIn November 2024, amidst intensifying Russian hybrid warfare efforts in Europe, two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged in another instance of suspected Russian sabotage. The Chinese-flagged ship Yi Peng 3 was allegedly captained by a Russian as it passed the two cables at approximately the same time as each was cut. The deputy head of NATO's Allied Maritime Command had earlier in the year said that Russia and other malicious actors were targeting the vulnerable and extensive piped and underwater cables connecting Europe's energy and communications networks.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has been described as one strand in Russian covert operational activity against European states that support Ukraine. In 2024, the Swedish Security Service concluded that a recently consecrated Russian Orthodox church built in Västerås was linked to Russian intelligence operations, adding that the Kremlin uses the Russian Orthodox Church in Sweden as a platform for such operations. The church was located near an airport used for Swedish military exercises and other critical national infrastructure.\nIn December 2024, an underwater power cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged on Christmas Day in Finnish waters, Finnish authorities placed a tanker ship named Eagle S at the center of its investigation into the incident being sabotage. The Finnish Customs Service said that the ship is part of the Russian shadow fleet. According to MarineTraffic, the ship was on its way to Egypt from Saint Petersburg, but slowed in the vicinity of the underwater cables. The Finnish Border Guard inspected the ship and said that the ship's anchors were missing, the suspicion being that the ship cut the cables by dragging its anchors over them.\nIn October 2025, French intelligence services said that an instance of Holocaust Memorial vandalism committed in May 2024 by four Bulgarian nationals was linked to a long-term strategy by Russia to use paid proxies to sow division, spread false information and stoke social tensions.\nInternational reactions\nOn 2 May 2024, the North Atlantic Council of NATO said that members of the alliance were \"deeply concerned\" by activities attributed to Russia on NATO territory, citing investigations resulting in the charging of multiple individuals connected to \"hostile state activity\". NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that actions such as sabotage, disinformation, acts of violence, and cyber and electronic interference would not \"deter us from supporting Ukraine\".\nGerman intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in November 2024 that Russia's extensive use of hybrid warfare \"increases the risk that NATO will eventually consider invoking its Article 5 mutual defence clause\".\nThe Baltic States have been among the biggest advocates in NATO for the alliance taking steps to counter the Russian threat, with many believing that with the increased Russian hybrid attacks, NATO's eastern flank will be the next to be targeted if Russia wins in Ukraine. Following damage to underwater cables between Estonia and Finland in December 2024 suspected to have been caused by a ship part of the Russian shadow fleet, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that the incident must be regarded as an attack against \"vital infrastructure\", adding that the shadow fleet is a threat to security in the Baltic.\nOn 22 October 2024, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Radosław Sikorski, withdrew consent to the functioning of the Russian consulate in Poznań, citing Russian hybrid warfare targeting Poland and its allies, including cyberattacks and assaults at Poland's eastern border, which is also the border of the Schengen Area.\nIn March 2025, UK officials at a Defence Committee evidence session urged for stronger deterrence against hybrid threats, with the Director General of Security Policy at the Ministry of Defence, Paul Wyatt, noting adversaries seeking to do harm in a \"manner they judge is below the Article 5 threshold\".\nRussia's view on hybrid warfare\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia defines the concept of hybrid wars precisely as a type of war, rather than a set of means to conduct state policy. The Russian Armed Forces openly discuss ongoing conflicts as hybrid wars, and Russia sees hybrid wars as the future of military development.\nReferences"
