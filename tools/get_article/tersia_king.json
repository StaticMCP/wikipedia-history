She represented the National Party (NP) in Parliament from 1987 to 1999. She also founded two private schools in Gauteng.\nPolitical career\nBorn on 20 October 1940, King entered frontline politics in 1977 when she became a local councillor in Kempton Park in the former Transvaal. She later joined the House of Assembly, where she represented the NP as MP for Kempton Park; she was elected to the seat in the 1987 general election.\nIn South Africa's first post-apartheid elections in 1994, King was elected to remain in Parliament, now in the multi-racial National Assembly. She served a single term in the seat; although she stood for re-election in the 1999 general election, she was ranked too low on the party list to gain re-election.\nCareer in education\nKing has several degree's, including a bachelor's from the University of Pretoria, a doctor of education from the University of South Africa, and an MBA from Potchefstroom University. She founded two private schools: the Tersia King Learning Academy in Tembisa, initially launched as the Self Help School in 1991, and the Oos-Rand Academy (named for the East Rand) in Pomona, Kempton Park, launched in 1996. She was principal of the Oos-Rand Academy during its early years, and after leaving Parliament she was principal of the Tersia King Learning Academy.\nShe died on 4 December 2016.\nSee also\n* Education in South Africa\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.netwerk24.com/netwerk24/tersia-king-onthou-vir-haar-bydrae-tot-die-onderwys-20161210 \"Tersia King onthou vir haar bydrae tot die onderwys\"] at Netwerk24\n* [https://www.netwerk24.com/netwerk24/grafskrif-tersia-king-tot-die-dood-was-sy-getrou-20161216 \"Tersia King: Tot die dood was sy getrou\"] at Netwerk24"
