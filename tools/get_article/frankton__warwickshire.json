In the 2021 Census, it had a population of 382,\nEtymology\nAccording to W. H. Duignan, the town's earliest name, Franchtone, was derived from the Anglo-Saxon Franca or Franco (the personal name of the original settler, which is probably derived from the national name of the Franks) and -tun, making it either \"Franca's town\" or \"the town of the Franks\".\nLocation and history\nFrankton is located about six miles south-west of Rugby, adjacent to the B4453 road linking Rugby and Princethorpe.  The village stands on a hill approximately 360 feet above sea level.  There are houses ranging from the 18th century to modern buildings, and a public house. Saint Nicholas’s Church lies at the western end of the village, the earliest parts of which date from the 13th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nReferences\nExternal links"
