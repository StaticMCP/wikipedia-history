It also includes Czerniakowskie, and Wilanowskie oxbow lakes near the Vistula river, which is part of an area known as Siekierki Arc.\nThe areas around the Augustówka Street and the Siekierki Way consists of heavy industry buildings, including the Siekierki Cogeneration Plant.\nHistory\nin Augustówka in 2010, in form of distorted land formations.]]\nBetween 1883 and 1890, the Fort X had been built within modern boundaries of Augustówka, as part of the series of fortifications of the Warsaw Fortress, build around Warsaw by the Russian Empire. In 1909, it was decided to decommission and demolish the fortifications of the Warsaw Fortress, due to the high costs of their maintenance, and as such the Fort V had been partially demolished in 1913.\nBy 1900, Augustówka was a small village located in the gmina (municipality) of Wilanów, within the Warsaw County. Since 20 October 1933, it functioned as one of its 13 gromadas (village assemblies). In 1943, the village had 482 inhabitants.\nIn 1939, during the Second World War, the Polish Armed Forces used the ruins of Fort X as defensive position against advancing Wehrmacht  forces of the Nazi Germany. In 1944, Wehrmacht  forces had used the ruins to defend themself from the Red Army of the Soviet Union. After the war, the area had been used as the military shooting range.\nOn 15 May 1951, the municipality of Wilanów, including Augustówka, were incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nIn 1961, in Augustówka had been opened the Siekierki Cogeneration Plant.\nCitations\nNotes\nReferences"
