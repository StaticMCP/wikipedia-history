Elections are held on the electoral system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote (PR-STV).\nAt the 2024 European Parliament election for the Tenth European Parliament, MEPs were elected from the following constituencies:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Constituency\n!Area\n!Seats\n|-\n|Dublin\n|The counties of: Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin;\nand the city of Dublin.\n|4\n|-\n|Midlands–North-West\n|The counties of: Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath;\nand the city of Galway.\n|5\n|-\n|South\n|The counties of: Carlow, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow;\nthe cities and counties of Limerick and Waterford;\nand the city of Cork.\n|5\n|}\nIn June 2023, the European Parliament adopted a resolution to add 11 MEPs.  This was adopted by the European Council in September 2023. Ireland gained one MEP under this arrangement, increasing from 13 to 14.\nThe Electoral Commission sought submissions on a review of European Parliament Constituencies. In a report in November 2023, it recommended that the additional seat be given to the constituency of Midlands–North-West, with the transfer of County Laois and County Offaly from South. This change was implemented by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023.\nChanges\nThis lists the number of MEPs elected at each European Parliament election by constituency.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Election\n!colspan=\"4\" |Constituencies\n!Total seats\n|-\n|(1973)\n|colspan=\"4\" align =\"center\" |(MEPs nominated by Oireachtas)\n|10\n|-\n!\n!Dublin\n!Leinster\n!Munster\n!Connacht–Ulster\n!\n|-\n|1979\n|4\n|3\n|5\n|3\n|15\n|-\n|1984\n|4\n|3\n|5\n|3\n|15\n|-\n|1989\n|4\n|3\n|5\n|3\n|15\n|-\n|1994\n|4\n|4\n|4\n|3\n|15\n|-\n|1999\n|4\n|4\n|4\n|3\n|15\n|-\n!\n!Dublin\n!East\n!South\n!North-West\n!\n|-\n|2004\n|4\n|3\n|3\n|3\n|13\n|-\n|2009\n|3\n|3\n|3\n|3\n|12\n|-\n!\n!Dublin\n! colspan=2|South\n!Midlands–North-West\n!\n|-\n|2014\n|3\n|colspan=2|4\n|4\n|11\n|-\n|2019\n|4}}\n|colspan=2|5\n|4\n|13\n|-\n|2024\n|4\n|colspan=2|5\n|5\n|14\n|}\nEuropean Parliament constituencies since 1979\nIreland-European-Parliament-Constituencies-1979-2004.svg|1979–2004\nIreland-European-Parliament-Constituencies-2004-2009.svg|2004–2009\nEire-European-Parliament-Constits-2009-Labeled-en.svg|2009–2014\nIreland-European-Parliament-Constituencies-2014-2019.svg|2014–2019\nIreland-European-Parliament-Constituencies-2019.svg|2019–2024\nIreland-European-Parliament-Constituencies-2014-2019.svg|2024–present\nSee also\n*Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)\nReferences"
