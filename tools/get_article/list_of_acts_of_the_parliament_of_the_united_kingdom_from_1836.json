For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n6 & 7 Will. 4\nThe second session of the 12th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 4 February 1836 until 20 August 1836.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 6 & 7 Gul. 4, 6 & 7 Wm. 4 or 6 & 7 W. 4.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for abolishing Capital Punishments in Cases of Letter Stealing and Sacrilege.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for that Purpose.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  in order to enable certain Seamen belonging to Shetland or Orkney to pay certain Sums of Money, payable under that Act to the Seamen's Fund, at Lerwick in Shetland or Kirkwall in Orkney.}}\n|  for the Abolition of Slavery in that Island, and in aid of the same.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  as directs the Period of the Execution and the Prison Discipline of Persons convicted of the Crime of Murder.|note4= }}\n|  for the Encouragement of building of Chapels of Ease in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for the better Administration of Justice at the holding of Petty Sessions by Justices of the Peace in Ireland.}}\n| or the London and Holyhead Road Act 1836|public|35|14-07-1836|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for further improving the Road between London and Holyhead, by Coventry, Birmingham, and Shrewsbury.|note4= }}\n| or the Constabulary (Ireland) (No. 2) Act 1836|public|36|28-07-1836|archived=n|An Act to amend an Act passed in the present Session of Parliament, for consolidating the Laws relating to the Constabulary Force in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for the Administration of Justice in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for imposing certain Restrictions on the Renewal of Leases by Ecclesiastical Persons.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  for providing for the Government of His Majesty's Settlements in Western Australia, on the Western Coast of New Australia.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n| or the Tithe Commutation Act 1836|public|71|13-08-1836|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act for the commutation of tithes in England and Wales.}}\n|  }}\n|  relating to the Dispatch of Business done by the Court of Exchequer in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for compensating Owners of Slaves upon the Abolition of Slavery, and for completing the full Payment of such Compensation.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Act for Marriages in England 1836or the Broomstick Marriage Act|public|85|17-08-1836|archived=n|An Act for Marriages in England.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Coroners Act 1836|public|89|17-08-1836|archived=n|An Act to provide for the Attendance and Remuneration of Medical Witnesses at Coroners Inquests.}}\n|  for rendering the Payment of Creditors more equal and expeditious in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  for enabling His Majesty to carry into effect a Convention made between His Majesty the King of the French, the Emperor of all the Russias, and the King of Bavaria.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Church Temporalities Act 1836|public|99|20-08-1836|archived=n|An Act to amend Two Acts passed respectively in the Third and Fourth and in the Fourth and Fifth Years of His present Majesty, for altering and amending the Laws relating to the Temporalities of the Church of Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for the Amendment and better Administration of the Laws relating to the Poor in England and Wales.}}\n|  for the Extension and Promotion of Public Works in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|  respecting Copyrights as requires the Delivery of a Copy of every published Book to the Libraries of Sian College, the Four Universities of Scotland, and of the King's Inns in Dublin.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Common Field Inclosure Act 1836|public|115|20-08-1836|archived=n|An Act for facilitating the Inclosure of Open and Arable Fields in England and Wales.}}\n|\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\n}}\n|  for repairing the Road from Farnborough to Riverhill, in the Parish of Sevenoaks in the County of Kent;
