In the context of the Mato Grosso Campaign, the Paraguayan invading army reached the Military Colony of Dourados, in the south of the then Province of Mato Grosso. There was a small garrison defending it, under the command of Lieutenant Antônio João Ribeiro.\nThe Paraguayans supposedly offered the garrison the opportunity to surrender, however, the Brazilian commander refused the proposal. In the combat that then ensued, the lieutenant and all his 15 men were killed, with the Paraguayans occupying the military colony.\nReferences"
