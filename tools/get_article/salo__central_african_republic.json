In January 2014, Seleka withdrew from the village, and Anti-balaka seized it. Due to the presence of Anti-balaka, the Muslim residents fled to Cameroon while the Christians remained in the bush, although they occasionally visited Salo.\nThe villagers waged an uprising against Anti-balaka in November 2014, and they fled from the town. As of 2015, Salo was under the control of the government forces.\nEconomy\nSalo is heavily dependent on the logging, diamond, and gold mining sector. Coffee was a primary source of income for the residents before it stopped operating in 1967.\nEducation\nThere are two schools in Salo.\nInfrastructure\nThe village has an oil port with depots that have capacity of 3500 m3. The depots were abandoned in 2000 and reoperated in 2008 after rehabilitation. However, Seleka looted and destroyed the oil depots on 7 May 2013. Nevertheless, the government planned to rehabilitate the oil depot in 2020, together with the Nola-Salo road, which was in poor condition.\nHealthcare\nSalo has one health center.\nReferences\nBibliographies\n*"
