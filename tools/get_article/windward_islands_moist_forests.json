The forested areas are mostly at higher elevations in the interior of the islands, surrounded by dry forests, dry shrubland, or mangroves on the flat coastal lowlands.  Closed forest of this ecoregion cover the majority of the islands.  Species diversity is very high.\nLocation and description\nThe Windward Islands are a volcanic island arc, with mountainous interiors in which steep slopes and difficulty converting the land to agriculture has provided some protection from human settlement and development.  Moist forests are found on the islands of Dominica, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, and Grenada.\nClimate\nThe climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification (Af)).  This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60&nbsp;mm of precipitation every month.  The rainy season occurs in the summer and fall, with precipitation ranging from 10,000&nbsp;mm/year in the high elevations of Dominica to 3,750&nbsp;mm/year in the lower elevations of Grenada.\nFlora and fauna\n70% of the ecoregion is closed, broadleaf evergreen forest.  Another 20% is open forest.  The characteristics tree species of the mature forests are gommier (Dacryodes excelsa), (Amanoa caribaea), and trees of genus (Sloanea).  The mature forests feature widespread epiphytes and lianas, with an understory of Licania ternatensis and Tapura antilliana. Forests that have been cleared for agriculture or timber are typically reforested by Miconia mirabilis and Cecropia schreberiana.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
