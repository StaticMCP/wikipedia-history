The aim of the project is to encourage the cultural activity of inhabitants of Lithuanian towns and cities and to develop culture and art in the regions.\nRegional Capitals of Culture\nThe initiative began in 2008, with Zarasai being chosen as the first Capital of Culture. In 2014 the project was expanded to include smaller Regional Capitals of Culture (). This initiative aims to strengthen cultural traditions, promote professional art, develop cultural tourism, and encourage new creative initiatives in different regions. Naisiai was the first town to be declared the country's Regional Capital of Culture in 2015, and since then, 10 towns and cities have been selected each year. The Ministry of Culture supports and promotes this initiative, with the Lithuanian Council for Culture allocating 50,000 euros annually to the most important projects since 2018. The Lithuanian Union of Rural Communities initiates the competition, with partners including the Association of Lithuanian Municipalities, the Ministry of Culture, and the Association of Lithuanian Elders. Many of these regional capitals utilise the efforts of local enthusiasts, cultural workers, and volunteers to create memorable cultural events for the local community, and to develop new cultural tourism initiatives, especially activities that focus on unique local aspects of culture.\nRegional Capitals of Culture proposals have included such activities as a reconstructed cultural centre, and a new organ music hall (Kėdainiai, 2026), and thematic areas based on 'waves' alongside a proposal to become a cultural resort (Zarasai). In 2024 Kaišiadorys's proposal was themed around its identity as a crossroads between four other towns, and Druskininkai's proposal was based on celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of painter, composer and writer M. K. Čiurlionis, and sought to commemorate him, as well as writers Vytautas Bložė and his wife Nijolė Miliauskaitė, Ričardas Gavelis, and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz.\nCities\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Year !! rowspan=2 | National Capital of Culture !! colspan=10 | Regional Capital of Culture (by county)\n|-\n!
