Its role was primarily to facilitate club and representative matches primarily in Australian rules football but also in Rugby union and occasionally soccer.\nIt primarily provided governance for Australian rules football in Queensland (the code was first introduced to the colony in 1866 by the Brisbane Football Club), however did not govern outright and as per its affiliation to the Victorian Football Association (which had begun with its member clubs in 1877). All decisions on the game's rules were referred to this body as a result, the clubs were known as Victorian Association clubs, and would play under Victorian Association or \"Association Football\" rules. 900 Queensland Victorian association footballers were members in 1884. The QFA was the second club competition formed in Queensland (after the Toowoomba Association which formed in 1876) and fifth in Australia (after the South Australian Football Association, Victorian Football Association and the Tasmanian Football Association with the New South Wales Football Association formed in August of the same year).\nThe QFA governed representative matches against New South Wales, the premier Australian Rules and Rugby Union competitions, and the Brisbane school's competition. However, a growing number of clubs outside of Brisbane became increasingly resentful at the Brisbane-centric organisation (representative sides were selected from member clubs and not the whole colony and rules were governed from Melbourne) and the lack of any colony-wide governing body which led to clubs increasingly switching to rugby (which was introduced to the colony in 1876).\nRugby at the time of the QFA's founding was in disarray, with Rangers Football Club (1876–1878) and Bonnet Rouge Football Club (1876–1878) folding two seasons earlier, however many of Brisbane and Wallaroos best players preferred to play both codes so rugby matches were facilitated during the season on a Saturday every 4 weeks. 80 rugby footballers broke away in 1883 to form the Northern Rugby Union (NRU) to facilitate regular representative matches against New South Wales.\nWhile some clubs occasionally played association football, the QFA did not recognise Anglo/British football matches, which were becoming increasingly popular, generally speaking these players refused to play either Victorian Association or Rugby rules, leading to the formation of the Anglo-Queensland Football Association in Brisbane, in 1884.\nThe Queensland Football Association folded after just a decade of operation, primarily due to the growing schism between the football clubs.\nHistory\nA meeting was held on 30 April 1880 at the Queen's Hotel for the purpose of forming the Queensland Football Association (QFA) to affiliate with the Victorian Football Association. The formation was opposed by the premier Queensland club, the Brisbane Football Club, through its representative E.C. Binge, believing that it had the right to govern itself and use its position of influence to lead the other clubs. However, his motion lapsed and the formation proceeded.\nIn an effort to uphold Victorian Rules, and frustrated with a lack of governance from Melbourne, a motion was passed by the Association secretary that effectively barred players found to be playing rugby from playing at a Victorian Rules club. The move was to backfire as the breakaway Northern Rugby Union (NRU) formed, taking disgruntled clubs and players with it. These clubs in response, instituted the barring of rugby players from playing Victorian rules and Rugby players and officials began derogatively reverting to the term \"Melbourne Association\" and \"Melbourne Rules\" in reference to the QFA and rules fuelling a sentiment of it being increasingly anti-rugby and anti-Queensland.\nThe QFA was criticised for its lack of a player transfer system. The situation in 1886 became farcical, in which players had begun to freely change to winning clubs week to week, and would even switch codes without accountability from the governing body.\nThe QFA was under heavy fire for its neglect in Australian Football in 1890 with clubs increasingly folding it had prepared no formal fixture for the season. It disbanded at the end of the season as the majority of its member clubs all folded and joined the ranks of rugby and soccer.\nLegacy\nThe QFA's demise led to the widespread adoption of rugby across the colony, and it became the dominant sport for more than a century. However, following a decade long hiatus, Australian rules saw renewed interest during the Federation of Australia and fans in Queensland at the turn of the century regrouped floating the idea of a new competition that would endure in the state. The Queensland Football League (QFL) was formed in July 1903.\nIn 2014, AFL Queensland created a new competition called Queensland Football Association (QFA) which as its lowest non-amateur division. While it shares the same name, the current competition has no connection to the historic competition.\nAdministration\nwas the first elected president of the Queensland Football Association]]\n* J.
