Operation Iraqi Freedom force organization changed frequently.\nIn the listings below \"BN\" refers to a battalion, a military unit. In the United States and United Kingdom, a combat battalion is usually approximately 600-800 personnel strong.\nCoalition Forces Land Component Command\nduring the Iraq War]]\nLieutenant General David D.

Archive.org link to appendix to U.S. Army, \"On Point.\" \"A snapshot compiled from unit records based on a CFLCC task organization briefing dated 010300Z May 03 (1 May 2003, 0300 hours Greenwich Mean Time). OIF [Operation Iraqi Freedom] task organization changed frequently, and this order of battle reflects the end of major combat operations on 1 May 2003. This is an order of battle (identification and command structure of a unit), not a task organization (temporary modification of the size and composition of a unit to meet mission requirements); therefore, organic subunits of a headquarters or the cross attachment of organic subunits within battalion-level formations may not be reflected. The intent was inclusion. Late-arriving units were cross-checked against force closure reports from 15-31 April on the CENTCOM JOPES Ops 2 newsgroup. Army unit designations are based on US Army Force Management Support Agency descriptions.\""
