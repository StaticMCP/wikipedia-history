Montchanin is located at the intersection of Delaware Route 100 and Kirk Road to the northwest of Wilmington.\nThe community received a post office and permanent railroad station in 1889, at which time it acquired the name Montchanin in honor of Anne Alexandrine de Montchanin, mother of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours. Prior to that time, the village rail stop was named DuPont Station in honor of the nearby duPont powder works.\nThe Jacob Broom House, a National Historic Landmark, is located there.  The Jacob Broom House, Montchanin Historic District, and Strand Millas and Rock Spring are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
