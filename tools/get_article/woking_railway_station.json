It lies  down the line from . The station is managed by South Western Railway, which operates all trains serving it. It is the busiest railway station in the county and, as of 2024, the fifth busiest in South East England.\nHistory\n]]\nThe London and Southampton Railway (L&SR) was authorised on 25 July 1834|group=note}} and construction began in October of that year. The line was built in stages, and the first section, between the London terminus at  and \"Woking Common\", was opened to passengers on 21 May 1838. return trip took around 1 hour and 28 minutes.|group=note}} Woking Common station was built with two platforms linked by a footbridge and a small freight yard was also provided. When it opened, it was surrounded by open heath and was  from what is now the village of Old Woking. Nevertheless, it quickly became the railhead for west Surrey and the main entrance was positioned on the south side of the tracks for the convenience of those travelling by stagecoach from Guildford. Construction of Woking town centre, to the north of the station, did not begin until the mid-1860s.\nWoking Common became a through station on 24 September 1838, with the opening of the next section of the line as far as . The station was given its current name of \"Woking\" in around 1843. The Guildford Junction Railway (GJR) opened on 5 May 1845, having been authorised less than a year earlier, on 10 May 1844. The GJR was always operated by the LSWR, and was absorbed by that company on 4 August 1845.\nThe track through Woking station was quadrupled in 1904 and electrified in 1937. The station was rebuilt by the Southern Railway in the Art Deco \"Odeon\" style in 1936–37. The signal box, which was constructed as part of the rebuilding programme, is a Grade II listed building.\nAccidents and incidents\nThree trains were involved in a collision just east of the station on 23 December 1955. A Portsmouth line electric train came to a stand at signals near the Maybury Hill Road bridge. The following steam-hauled Waterloo-Basingstoke train overran the Maybury distant signal and collided with the rear of the electric train, demolishing the guards compartment and deflecting the rear bogie so that it was foul of the up-line. An up Bournemouth steam-hauled train had just left the station and came into sidelong collision with the bogie and came to a stand. Out of around 1000 passengers and crew on the three trains only 21 were injured, including the guard of the electric train, and there were no fatalities.\nThe Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation report concluded that the crash was due to human error on the part of the driver of the Basingstoke train. The Basingstoke train locomotive, SR N15X class 32327 Trevithick, was damaged beyond economic repair and scrapped at Eastleigh Works.\nLayout\nWoking station has six platforms, two of which are bay platforms:\n* Platform 1 – Semi-fast London-bound services.\n* Platform 2 – Fast London-bound services.
