In 1736 he built the town house of the Disney family, Disney Place in Eastgate Street, Lincoln and in 1744 the Lincoln Assembly Rooms in the Bail, Lincoln. He also built a house for himself on the east side of St Peter at Arches‘ graveyard on the site of the Lincoln Taylor's Hall. Abraham Hayward's younger brother John Hayward (1708–78), a mason by trade, also accompanied him to Lincoln. After Abraham's death, he presumably continued the business and in 1753 rebuilt St Mary's bridge in Lincoln. John Hayward's grandson, William Hayward became surveyor to Lincoln Cathedral.\nInterior of the County Assembly Rooms, Bailgate by Hayward, 1744\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"4\" style=\"border: 2px solid #9d9d9d;background-color:#eeeeee\" valign=\"midlle\"\n|-\n|\nFile:Assembly Rooms, Bailgate, Lincoln 01.JPG|Interior of the Assembly Rooms, Bailgate, Lincoln\nFile:Assembly Rooms, Bailgate, Lincoln 03.jpg|Interior of the Assembly Rooms, Bailgate, Lincoln.
