Located in Montauk on Long Island, New York, it was started by its namesake, playwright Edward Albee, in 1967, after revenue from his play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? proved abundant.\nThe Edward F. Albee Foundation maintains the William Flanagan Memorial Creative Persons Center, also called The Barn, as a residence for writers, painters and sculptors. The Barn is located approximately two miles from the center of Montauk and the Atlantic Ocean. The residency program is in a secluded knoll offering privacy and a peaceful atmosphere.\nEdward Albee created the foundation to provide an alternative to residencies that often served more established or successful applicants. \"We thought that maybe we should do two things here - get people at the cusp, young people, before they necessarily had made it, or occasionally people who were older who had been forgotten and whose careers hadn't gone so well, but were still doing interesting work, because they could teach the younger people.\"\nSome notable writers and artists who have attended in past years include:\nChristopher Durang,\nSpalding Gray,\nA.M. Homes,\nTom Holmes,\nWill Eno,\nKeith Milow,\nHonor Molloy,\nSean Scully,\nand\nMia Westerlund Roosen.\nRenovations\nThe Barn was renovated and completed in 2024. The 3,300-square-foot structure houses the residents' rooms and studio space for writers and artists to live and work. It was a former horse stable in Montauk dating back to the 1920s and used for the residencies 50 years prior to the renovations. The rehabilitated barn has new dormers, windows, doors and an outdoor terrace. The new interior has accessible 21st century workspaces, an accessible elevator, a kitchen and a shared library that houses many of Albee’s own books and records. The updated and modernized facilities expanded the residency from a seasonal operation to year-round. The work minimized impact on existing wetlands, which were protected and restored with native plantings. A 1,400-square-foot cottage was also renovated as a residence for the property's caretaker. TenBerke was the architectural firm and John Hummel and Associates the general contractor.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.albeefoundation.org Official website]"
