He was told they could work out an extension during the year and he'd be paid fairly. With a great relationship with Dan Rooney, he conceded and eventually showed up on August 15, 2005, on the sidelines for Pittsburgh's first preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

In the 2010 home opener against the Falcons, Ward had six receptions for 108 receiving yards as the Steelers won 15–9. In the game against the Atlanta Falcons, Ward became the first player in Steelers history to surpass 11,000 receiving yards. He caught 108 yards worth of passes in that game to pass Hall of Fame Steelers receiver John Stallworth for the most 100-yard receiving games all-time for the Steelers with his 26th.

On October 9, 2011, he had 7 catches for 54 receiving yards and 2 touchdown receptions. In this game, he caught the last touchdown of his career on an 8-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger in the second quarter. On December 4, 2011, in a 35–7 home victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, Ward became the 19th player in NFL history to reach 12,000 receiving yards. On January 1, 2012, in a game against the Cleveland Browns, Ward caught his 1,000th reception, becoming the eighth player in NFL history to do so. He also caught his last career reception during the game. He appeared in his last game with the Steelers on January 8, 2012, as the Steelers lost 23–29 to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Wild Card Round. He finished his last season with a total of 46 receptions, 381 receiving yards, and two touchdowns in 15 games and nine starts.\nOn March 7, 2012, the Steelers announced their intention to cut and release Ward, which they did two days later.\nOn March 20, 2012, Ward announced his retirement from professional football stating, \"Without the support over the past 14 years this game wouldn't be the same to me. It wouldn't be as fun for me. You guys meant the world to me. The city and this organization means the world to me. So today as sadly as it feels for me right now, I hope it will be a good day for everyone here.\"\nWard accumulated 76 receptions, 1,064 yards, and eight receiving touchdowns in 14 post-season appearances.\nAlthough the Steelers have not officially retired Ward's #86, they have not reissued it since his retirement and it is understood that no Steeler will ever wear it again.\nLegacy\nWard's versatility, hands, and willingness to block served him well as a professional wide receiver. Since being drafted by the Steelers in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft, he earned three team Most Valuable Player (MVP) selections. He was also a four-time NFL Pro Bowl selection (2001–2004). Ward also had a streak of 4 consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. The streak was broken in the 2005 NFL season during which he missed a game due to injury. In 2002, he set a Steelers franchise record for receptions (112) and touchdowns (12) (both since broken by Antonio Brown) and was named to his first of two consecutive All-NFL teams.\nAlthough he was considered one of the best blocking receivers in the NFL, Ward often faced criticism for his style of blocking, particularly for his propensity to hit defenders on their blind side. During a game on October 19, 2008, Ward put a vicious downfield blindside block on rookie Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Keith Rivers. The impact of the block left Rivers with a broken jaw, and caused him to miss the remainder of the 2008 season. Ward was not penalized for this block, nor was he fined by the league as the hit was deemed legal. The league, however, later passed a new rule banning such hits. The so-called \"Hines Ward Rule\" made a blindside block illegal if the block came from the blocker's helmet, forearm or shoulder and lands to the head or neck area of a defender.

He also worked alongside wide receivers coach Joey Thomas. He was later promoted to the position of wide receivers coach.\nSan Antonio Brahmas\nIn June 2021, Ward was announced as one of the eight XFL head coaches. He was announced as head coach of the San Antonio Brahmas in July 2022 when team locations were revealed. On December 28, 2023, Ward resigned from the Brahmas after finishing with a 3–7 record in 2023, in response to a change in contract structure.\nArizona State Sun Devils\nIn April 2024, Ward was announced to be the next wide receivers coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils.\nHead coaching record\nXFL\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"4\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason\n|-\n!Won!!Lost!!Win %!!Finish!!

They have one daughter. Ward also has a son from a previous relationship.  On his upper right arm he has a tattoo of Mickey Mouse in the Heisman pose, just below a tattoo of his name in Korean.\nBusiness and media enterprises\nWard co-owned a bar in Pittsburgh's South Side called The Locker Room. The bar sustained serious water damage in February 2007, due to flooding from a malfunctioning boiler, and it was closed for repairs until June of that year. The bar received an insurance settlement of $500,000, which subsequently became an issue during a legal dispute between the bar's owners.\nOn September 11, 2007, co-owner Nicholas Lettieri withdrew the entirety of the bar's funds, approximately $19,000, from a corporate account, causing it to miss a large number of scheduled payments. The company filed suit for the return of the money, and Lettieri subsequently justified his actions by claiming that the money was owed to him, also voicing the belief that the other co-owners, Ward and Kimberly Pitts, as well as Pitts' husband, Korry Pitts, had falsified invoices and diverted company funds to their own bank accounts. Company attorney Thomas Castello dismissed Lettieri's allegations as \"baseless, ridiculous and unfounded\", and the matter currently is before the court. The Locker Room reopened under the name South Side 86 (because of Ward's jersey number), and is owned entirely by Ward, who bought out his co-owners.\nWard hosted the Hines Ward Show on Pittsburgh CBS O&O KDKA-TV from 2006 to 2012. In 2012, shortly after announcing his retirement, it was announced that Ward had signed on with NBC Sports to be a football analyst, highlighted by his role on the Sunday Night Football pregame show Football Night in America.\nHe opened a restaurant called Table 86 and a wine bar named Vines in Seven Fields with Howard A Shiller from Fort Lauderdale in August 2015. The restaurant closed in March 2019 due to a lawsuit surrounding the partnership dispute for the businesses.\nWard joined CNN and HLN in May 2016. He is a current CNN studio analyst.\nIn 2018, he joined the Alliance of American Football as the Player Relations Executive.\nAs a figure for social change\nIn 2006, Ward became the first Korean American to win the Super Bowl MVP award. This achievement threw him into the spotlight of media in South Korea.\nFrom April 3 through May 30, 2006, Ward returned to his birthplace of Seoul for the first time since his parents moved to the United States when he was one year old. Ward used his celebrity status to arrange \"hope-sharing\" meetings with multiracial Korean children and to encourage social and political reform. At one hope-sharing meeting, he told a group of children, \"If the country can accept me for who I am and accept me for being a Korean, I'm pretty sure that this country can change and accept you for who you are.\" On his final day in Korea, he donated US$1 million to create the Hines Ward Helping Hands Foundation, which the AP called \"a foundation to help mixed-race children like himself in South Korea, where they have suffered discrimination.\" He was awarded honorary citizenship by the Seoul Metropolitan Government for his efforts to minimize discrimination in Korea against half-Koreans.\nIn September 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Ward as a member of the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\nDUI arrest\nOn July 9, 2011, Ward was arrested for driving under the influence in DeKalb County, Georgia, after being witnessed by a MARTA police officer failing to maintain his lane and subsequently hitting a curb. An officer of the DeKalb County Police Department responded which led to the investigation and Ward's arrest. On February 22, 2012, the DUI charge was dropped as part of a plea agreement. Ward agreed to plead guilty to reckless driving and received a sentence of one year of probation, 80 hours of community service and a $2,000 fine.\nFilm and TV appearances\nWard made an appearance as a member of the fictional Gotham Rogues football team in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises, and was one of the members of \"Team Rachael\" in the second season of Food Network's Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. He appeared in the ninth episode of the third season of The Walking Dead, appearing as a walker. He also appeared on Celebrity Wife Swap.\nOther sporting appearances\nDancing with the Stars performance\nOn May 24, 2011, Ward and his partner Kym Johnson won season 12 of the American TV dance competition Dancing with the Stars.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align: center; background:#ccc;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Week #\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Dance/Song\n| colspan=\"3\"|'''Judges' score\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Result'''\n|-  style=\"text-align: center; background:#ccc;\"\n|  style=\"width:10%; \"|Inaba\n|  style=\"width:10%; \"|Goodman\n|  style=\"width:10%; \"|Tonioli\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|1\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Cha-Cha-Cha/ \"Club Can't Handle Me\"\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|7\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|7\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|7\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|No Elimination\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"\n||2\n||Quickstep/ \"Part-Time Lover\"\n||8\n||7\n||8\n||Safe\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|3\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Samba/ \"Fantasy\"\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|9\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|8\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|8\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Safe\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|4\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Paso Doble/ \"Explosive / Adagio for Strings\"\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|9\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|8\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|8\n|  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Safe\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"\n||5\n||Rumba/ \"God Bless The USA\"\n||9\n||9\n||9\n||Safe\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"\n||6\n||Viennese Waltz/ \"End of the Road\"\n||9\n||9\n||9\n||Safe\n|-  style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|7\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|Team Cha-Cha-Cha/ \"We R Who We R\"Tango/ \"La lección de Tango\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|7*/79*/9\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|88\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|810\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|Safe\n|- style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|8\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|Foxtrot/\"This Will Be\"Jive/ \"Chantilly Lace\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|99\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|99\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|108\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|Safe\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|9Semi-finals\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|Argentine Tango/ \"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\"Salsa/\"Hello\"Winner Take All Cha-Cha-Cha/ \"Just Dance\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|1010Awarded\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|10100\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|1010Points\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|Safe\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|10Finals\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|Quickstep/\"Puttin' On The Ritz\"Freestyle/\"Dancing Machine\" and \"I Want You Back\"Samba/\"Fantasy\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|101010\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|91010\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f\"|101010\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:gold| WON\n|}\nIn week 7, Donnie Burns was the guest judge and scored the dances as well (first score listed is Burns').\nTriathlon\nIn 2012, Ward began training for the 2013 Ironman World Championships, enlisting the help of triathlon legend Paula Newby-Fraser.
