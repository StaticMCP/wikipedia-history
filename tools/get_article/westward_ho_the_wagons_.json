Based on Mary Jane Carr's novel Children of the Covered Wagon, the film was produced by Bill Walsh, directed by William Beaudine, and released to theatres on December 20, 1956 by Buena Vista Distribution Company. The supporting cast features Mouseketeer Cubby O'Brien, Jeff York, Sebastian Cabot (in his first film role for Disney), David Stollery, and George Reeves (his final feature film appearance).\nPlot\nA small group of families join together to travel to Oregon in 1846. Their leader is ostensibly James Stephen (George Reeves), who has made the trip before, and is now bringing his family along. John Grayson (Fess Parker), known as Doc for his ambition to study medicine, proves to be the real leader of the wagon train.\nThe pioneers deal with the elements and occasional raids, but after hostile Pawnees drive off their spare horses, they realize they may not make it to the Oregon Territory. While stopping at Fort Laramie, the pioneer children make friends with Sioux children. After the Sioux chief's son is injured in an accident, Doc Grayson helps heal him, earning the trust of the Sioux. As the story ends, the Sioux warriors escort the wagon train safely through Pawnee territory.\nCast\n* Fess Parker as John 'Doc' Grayson\n* Kathleen Crowley as Laura Thompson\n* Jeff York as Hank Breckenridge\n* David Stollery as Dan Thompson\n* Sebastian Cabot as Bissonette\n* George Reeves as James Stephen\n* Doreen Tracey as Bobo Stephen\n* Morgan Woodward as Obie Foster\n* Barbara Woodell as Mrs. Stephen\n* Iron Eyes Cody as Many Stars\n* John War Eagle as Wolf's Brother\n* Anthony Numkena as Little Thunder\n* Cubby O'Brien as Jerry Stephen\n* Karen Pendleton as Myra Thompson\n* Tommy Cole as Jim Stephen\n* Jane Liddell as Ruth Benjamin\n* Leslie Bradley as Spencer Armitage\n* Jon Locke as Ed Benjamin\nAdditionally, several actors appear in the film uncredited.

There is a sense of strain; the humour hangs heavy; the action and its outcome is always predictable. The undaunted Fess Parker, however, remains as resolute as ever, and sings with the same charm and style.\"\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1956\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
