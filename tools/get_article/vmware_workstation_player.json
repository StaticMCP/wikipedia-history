VMware Player could run existing virtual appliances and create its own virtual machines (which require that an operating system be installed to be functional). It used the same virtualization core as VMware Workstation, a similar program with more features, which became available free of charge for personal, but not commercial, use in 2024. VMware Player was available for personal non-commercial use, or for distribution or other use by written agreement. VMware, Inc. did not formally support Player, but there was an active community website for discussing and resolving issues, and a knowledge base.\nThe free VMware Player was distinct from VMware Workstation until Player v7, Workstation v11. In 2015 the two packages were combined as VMware Workstation 12, with a free for non-commercial use restricted Player version which, on purchase of a license code, either became the higher-specification VMware Workstation Pro, or allowed commercial use of Player.\nVMware Workstation Player was discontinued in May 2024 when VMware Workstation Pro became free for personal use. Commercial users of Player could continue to use it until the end of the active support term.\nFeatures\nVMware claimed in 2011 that the Player offered better graphics, faster performance, and tighter integration for running Windows XP under Windows Vista or Windows 7 than Microsoft's Windows XP Mode running on Windows Virtual PC, which is free of charge for all purposes.\nVersions earlier than 3 of VMware Player were unable to create virtual machines (VMs), which had to be created by an application with the capability, or created manually by statements stored in a text file with extension \".vmx\"; later versions can create VMs. The features of Workstation not available in Player are \"developer-centric features such as Teams, multiple Snapshots and Clones, and Virtual Rights Management features for end-point security\", and support by VMware. Player allows a complete virtual machine to be copied at any time by copying a directory; while not a fully featured snapshot facility, this allows a copy of a machine in a particular state to be stored, and reverted to later if desired. By default, changes (including proxy settings, passwords, bookmarks, installed software and malware) made in a VM were saved when it was shut down, but the .vmx configuration file could easily be edited to autorevert on shutdown, so that all changes are discarded.\nVMware Player was also supplied with the VMware Workstation distribution, for use in installations where not all client users are licensed to use the full VMware Workstation. In an environment where some machines without VMware Workstation licences run VMware Player, a virtual machine created by Workstation could be distributed to computers running Player without paying for additional Workstation licenses if not used commercially.\nVersion history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, a free Linux-based “browser appliance” with the Firefox browser installed was available that can be used for safe Web browsing; if infected or damaged, it could be discarded and replaced by a clean copy. VMs could be configured to reset after each use without the need to recreate from the original file. Suppliers of operating systems with commercial licences usually required installations to be licensed; VMs with such operating systems installed could not be distributed without restriction. Ready-to-use VMs with Microsoft or Apple operating systems installed, in particular, were not distributed, except for evaluation versions.\nVMware Player supported free-of-charge VMware Tools, which added significant functionality. Versions of Player for different platforms had their own Tools, not necessarily compatible with other versions. Sometimes Tools were updated belatedly; for example, Player 4.0.2 was released on 24 January 2012, but the corresponding version of Tools was not available for some time after that, restricting functionality of updated Player installations.\nVirtual machines created by one VMware software product could be used by any other. It was often possible to use VMs created by one manufacturer's virtual machine software with software from another manufacturer, either directly or via a conversion procedure. VMs that ran on Microsoft Virtual Server and Virtual PC could be converted for use by VMware software by the VMware vCenter Converter. This software could also create a virtual machine from a physical PC.\nSee also\n* Comparison of platform virtualization software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.htofe.com/file-extension/vmx File Extension VMX]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090504014104/http://www.v3.co.uk/vnunet/downloads/2158957/vmware-player V3.co.uk Review of VMware Player 3.1.2]"
