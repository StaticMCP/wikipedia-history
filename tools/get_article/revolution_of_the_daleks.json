It was written by Chris Chibnall, and directed by Lee Haven Jones. The episode follows the twelfth series as a New Year’s Day special, continuing on from \"The Timeless Children\" (2020).\nThe episode stars Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor, with Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole and Mandip Gill as companions Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan respectively. Walsh and Cole depart the series in this episode. It also stars John Barrowman as Jack Harkness, following his return to the series in \"Fugitive of the Judoon\" (2020).\nThe episode was watched by 6.35 million viewers overall.\nPlot\nIt is revealed that in 2019, shortly after the destruction of the Reconnaissance Scout Dalek, the damaged casing from it was transported to a government facility but intercepted en route. Using the Dalek parts, businessman Jack Robertson funded a defence drone resembling a Dalek to suppress public riots and gave some to politician Jo Patterson to use in her constituency.\nIn the present day, 10 months have passed since Graham, Ryan and Yaz returned to Earth. Graham and Ryan meet Yaz at the TARDIS they returned in, which is disguised as a house in a neighbourhood, where she is investigating the whereabouts of the Doctor. Graham shows her a leaked video of the defence drone demonstration and they unsuccessfully confront Robertson about the drones.\nPatterson, projected to be elected the Prime Minister, requests that Robertson increase the drone production so they can be implemented nationally. Scientist Leo Rugazzi discovers organic cells in the Dalek remnants and clones the cells into a living creature. Leo shows the new creature to Robertson, with the latter immediately ordering its destruction. Before he can incinerate the creature, it escapes and takes control of Leo's mind and body. Dalek-controlled Leo travels to Osaka, Japan, where Dalek clones are already being grown in a facility.\nThe Doctor has been imprisoned in a distant asteroid for a number of decades. She eventually encounters Jack Harkness, who learned of her arrest and committed a series of crimes in order to rescue her. He uses a temporal freezing gateway disinhibitor bubble to take them both to his vortex manipulator which he had previously hid in another cell, which transports them back to the Doctor's TARDIS. The Doctor rejoins her companions and learns about the new Dalek threat. Jack and Yaz investigate the facility in Japan while the Doctor, Graham, and Ryan confront Robertson. They all meet back up in Japan where the Dalek reveals its plan to take over Earth. Using ultraviolet light, the Dalek clones transport themselves into the defence drones which begin exterminating humans, as well as assassinating Patterson.\nThe Doctor sends out a Dalek reconnaissance signal, which reaches a death squad of Daleks. The death squad Daleks eliminate the reconnaissance Daleks because they do not consider them pure Dalek due to them having traces of human DNA. Impressed by their intelligence, Robertson decides to make an alliance with the Daleks and reveals that the Doctor actually summoned them. Jack, Graham, and Ryan infiltrate the Dalek ship to rig it with explosives. The Doctor tricks the Daleks into the other TARDIS where it is set to collapse on itself and be transported to the Void to be destroyed. Robertson weakly claims he was acting as a \"decoy\" by betraying the Doctor, before using his encounter with the Daleks to restore his public reputation.\nAfter Jack leaves to catch up with Gwen Cooper, the Doctor prepares to resume travelling with her companions. However, Ryan announces his decision to stay on Earth and Graham elects to remain with his grandson. They sadly part ways with the Doctor, who gifts them with psychic paper. The Doctor and Yaz continue their adventures together, while Ryan and Graham decide to use their new psychic paper to investigate strange phenomena on Earth. Ryan and Graham first attempt to help Ryan ride a bicycle as they did before meeting the Doctor and see a vision of Grace O'Brien watching over them.\nOutside references\nThe Doctor refers to the imprisoned Ood and Sycorax as Bonnie and Clyde.\nDuring her captivity, the Doctor quotes the first sentence of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to herself as a bedtime story.\nRobertson appears on Newsnight'' to explain his encounter with the Daleks at the end of the episode, with its host Emily Maitlis making an uncredited cameo as herself.\nProduction\nDevelopment\n\"Revolution of the Daleks\" was written by showrunner Chris Chibnall.
