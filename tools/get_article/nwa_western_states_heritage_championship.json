The belt was created as a tribute to the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship, a retired territorial championship based in Amarillo, Texas; despite this, the NWA Western States Heritage Championship was never actually defended in Amarillo and most title defenses occurred on the East Coast or in the Midwest.\nThe NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship was revived in 2015 by NWA Vendetta Pro Wrestling, using a belt design identical to that of the NWA Western States Heritage Championship. NWA Vendetta Pro Wrestling recognized all former Western States Champions — including the Western States Heritage titleholders. The NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship was retired and replaced with the Vendetta Pro Western States Championship on September 8, 2017.\nReigns\n|reign = 1\n|date =\n|days =\n|location =Houston, TX\n|event = Live event\n|notes = Defeated Black Bart in a tournament to fill the title.\n|ref =\n}}\n|reign = 1\n|date =\n|days =\n|location = Uniondale, NY\n|event = Bunkhouse Stampede\n|notes =\n|ref =\n}}\n|days =\n|location =\n|event = —\n|notes =The championship retired when Larry Zbyszko left to work for the American Wrestling Association (AWA).
