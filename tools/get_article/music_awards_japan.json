The awards are organized by the Japan Culture and Entertainment Industry Promotion Association (CEIPA) in collaboration with the Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). The inaugural award show was held on May 21 and 22, 2025, at the Rohm Theater, Kyoto.\nHistory\nOn October 22, 2024, the Music Awards Japan were officially announced. The awards were introduced to promote Japanese and Asian music on a global stage. The five major music organizations of the Japanese music industry, the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), the Japan Association of Music Enterprises, the Federation of Music Producers Japan, the Music Publishers Association of Japan, and the All Japan Concert & Live Entertainment Promoter's Conference, founded the Japan Culture and Entertainment Industry Promotion Association, which is responsible for the organization, marketing and hosting of the Music Awards Japan. One of the backgrounds for the establishment of this award is to strengthen, to change and to open the Japanese music market for a global audience.\nIn December 2024, the six main categories were introduced, and more categories were announced in January 2025. The inaugural award show is set to be held on May 21 and 22, 2025, at Rohm Theater in Kyoto. On January 15, 2025, NHK was announced to broadcast the second day of the award show, while both days are to be livestreamed globally on YouTube. A showcase titled Matsuri '25: Japanese Music Experience was announced to be held on March 16, 2025, at Peacock Theater, Los Angeles with Ado, Atarashii Gakko! and Yoasobi performing. This is first global showcase to be held prior to the awards to raise awareness of Japanese music artists and the music prize itself.\nIn the week of the award show the MAJ Music Week is set to be held including concerts, seminars and conferences.\nOn September 15, 2025, they announced that 2026 Music Awards Japan will be held at Toyota Arena Tokyo in Ariake, Tokyo.\nBackground\nDuring a press conference held at Live Entertainment Expo in Tokyo, Tatsuya Nomura, the CEO of the Federation of Music Producers Japan stated that consumer behavior has changed drastically in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting from physical purchases to digital media. Nomura added that the establishment of an award show similar to the Grammy Awards in the United States, BRIT Awards in the United Kingdom and ARIA Music Awards in Australia might be able to increase the international interest in Japanese music and support the expansion of the domestic music market.\nShunsuke Muramatsu, CEO of the Recording Industry Association of Japan and founding member of CEIPA, further explained that the music industry is on the verge of change, which can be observed since 2019. Muramatsu stated that the declining domestic music market is a result of the shrinking population. He noted that opening of the domestic music market for a global audience is necessary.\nNominations and awarding process\nBased on metrics from Billboard Japan, Oricon, GfK Japan, Luminate, Usen, the Daiichi Kosho Company, the JASRAC and more, an automated system selects artists, songs and albums that are eligible to be nominated for an award.\nFrom this pool, a panel consisting of people from the Japanese music industry select five nominations for each category. The winners of most categories are selected by an international jury consisting of 5,000 people from the international music industry. At the inaugural award ceremony, there are two categories where the nominations and winners are select by a public vote on Spotify.\nIn an interview with Real Sound, Nomura explained the details of the voting process, which is held in two rounds. Eligible voting members of the first round of voting are given up to five votes each. It is possible to vote at least once for their own work or a work that the voting member was part of in another function, depending on if the work has been selected by the automated system. Only voting members who participated in the first voting round are eligible for voting in the second voting round.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
