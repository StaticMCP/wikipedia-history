The commission is independent of government and the Civil Service.\nThe Civil Service Commission was established by Gladstone through an order in council on 21 May 1855 following the publication of the Northcote–Trevelyan Report by Charles Trevelyan and Stafford Northcote that advocated the decoupling of appointments of senior civil servants from ministers to ensure the impartiality of the Civil Service.\nFollowing a report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, \"Defining the Boundaries within the Executive: Ministers, special advisers and the permanent Civil Service\" in 2003, the appointment of the First Civil Service Commissioner is made by Government after consultation with the leaders of the main opposition parties. They are then appointed by the King under royal prerogative. The First Civil Service Commissioner is appointed for a fixed term of five years, although another commissioner may act as an interim First Commissioner when necessary.\nCivil Service Code\nThe Civil Service Code is a set of regulations that govern the conduct of civil servants in the UK. The regulations are broadly based on the Seven Principles of Public Life. First introduced in 2006 and later updated in 2015, the code has four main principles that public sector workers must be held accountable to: integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality.\nList of First Civil Service Commissioners\n*Sir Edward Ryan (1855–75)\n*John Pakington, 1st Baron Hampton (1875–1880)\n*George Byng, Viscount Enfield (later 3rd Earl of Strafford) (1880–88)\n*...\n*William Courthope (1892–1907)\n*Lord Francis Hervey (1907-1909)\n*Sir Stanley Leathes (1910–1927)\n*Sir Roderick Meiklejohn, KBE CB (1927–1939)\n*Sir Percival Waterfield (1939–1951)\n*Sir Paul Sinker (1951–1954)\n*Laurence Helsby, Baron Helsby (1954–1959)\n*Sir George Mallaby (1959–1964)\n*Sir George Abell (1964-1967)\n*John Hunt (1967–1971)\n*K.
