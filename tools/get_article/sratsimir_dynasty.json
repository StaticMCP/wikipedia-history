The Stratsimir dynasty was matrilineally descended from the previous Bulgarian royal houses of Asen and Shishman. After its deposition following the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria, princes of the Sratsimir dynasty survived in exile in the neighbouring Kingdom of Hungary until at least the second half of the 16th century.\nFamily tree\n* Sratsimir, despot, married to Keratsa Petritsa (sister of Michael Asen III)\n** Ivan Alexander, Bulgarian emperor (1331–1371)\n*** Michael Asen IV, Bulgarian junior co-emperor\n*** Ivan Asen IV, Bulgarian junior co-emperor\n*** Ivan Sratsimir, Bulgarian emperor in Vidin (1356–c. 1397)\n**** Constantine II, Bulgarian emperor in Vidin (c. 1397–1422)\n**** Dorothea, Queen of Bosnia, married Tvrtko I of Bosnia\n***** (→ Kotromanić dynasty)\n*** Ivan Shishman, Bulgarian emperor in Tarnovo (1371–1395)\n**** Alexander\n**** Joseph II, Patriarch of Constantinople (1416–1439)\n**** Fruzhin, claimant Bulgarian emperor (1422–1460), Count of Temes\n***** Shishman\n****** Mihul (Michael) Bozyasi ( 1463)\n****** Istvan (Stephen) Bosyazi ( 1463–1464)\n****** Sandrin (Alexander) Shishman ( 1464–1467), commander of Severin\n******* Philip Shishman\n******** Istvan Shishman (16th century)\n******** Radoslav Shishman (16th century;  1515)\n******** Vladislav Shishman (16th century)\n******** Ferenc Shishman (died 1550)\n********* Durma Shishman de Gattaya (second half of the 16th century)\n***** Stoyan ( 1454)\n***** Stoyko ( 1454)\n***** Stanislav ( 1454)\n***** Daughters\n****\n*** Ivan Asen V, Bulgarian junior co-emperor\n*** Kera Tamara, married a \"despot Constantine\"; later part of the harem of Ottoman sultan Murad I\n*** Desislava\n***\n** Helena, Empress of Serbia, married Stefan Dušan of Serbia\n*** (→ Nemanjić dynasty)\n** John Komnenos Asen, Despot of Valona (c. 1345–1363)\n*** Alexander Komnenos Asen, Despot of Valona (c. 1363–1371)\n*** Daughter, married Balša II\n**** (→ Balšić noble family)\n** Michael\n**\nLater claims\nTwo later Bulgarian rebels during the Ottoman period, Ivan Shishman II (1598) and Rostislav Stratimirovic (1686) claimed descent from the Sratsimir dynasty, though their genealogies are unverified.\nSources"
