The Borough was abolished altogether by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and it was transformed into a large county division, formally named the North or Buckingham Division of Buckinghamshire. It was one of three divisions formed from the undivided three-member Parliamentary County of Buckinghamshire, the other two being the Mid or Aylesbury Division and the Southern or Wycombe Division.\nIn the twentieth century, the constituency was held by the Conservative Party for most of the time. However, Aidan Crawley, a Labour Party MP, served Buckingham from 1945 until 1951, and from 1964 until 1970, its Labour MP was the controversial publisher Robert Maxwell.\nBefore the periodic review effected in 1983, the new town of Milton Keynes, including its older parts such as Bletchley and Fenny Stratford, was in the constituency.  The 1983 review followed the previous national review in 1974 and recognised the large increase in voters in the constituency. The sitting Buckingham MP, William Benyon, stood for the newly created Milton Keynes constituency, where he was elected.  The residual seat was won in 1983 by Conservative George Walden. Walden retired in 1997, and John Bercow won the following general elections in 2001, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017. At the 2005 general election, this constituency had the Conservatives' highest numerical majority, although a higher share of the vote was achieved in Kensington and Chelsea in London, the constituency of Malcolm Rifkind, and Richmond in North Yorkshire, the constituency of William Hague.\nIn 2009, Bercow was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons following the resignation of Michael Martin. There is an inconsistently followed convention, which is mostly kept by the major parties, not to oppose a Speaker at election. Nonetheless, UKIP's leader, Nigel Farage, stood against Bercow in the 2010 election but finished third behind the Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy founder, who previously founded the Pro-Euro Conservative Party.\nIn both the 2015 and 2017 general elections, Bercow was challenged by only UKIP and the Green Party, with the addition of the independent candidate Scott Raven in the latter election. In September 2019 the Conservative Party announced their intention to stand a candidate against Bercow in the next election, breaking the convention of major parties not opposing a Speaker, seemingly in response to Bercow's opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's handling of Brexit. However, Bercow announced in September 2019 that he would stand down as Speaker on either October 31 or at the next election, whichever occurred first.\nBoundaries and boundary changes\n1885–1918\n* The Municipal Borough of Buckingham;\n* The Sessional Divisions of Ashendon, Buckingham, Newport, and Stony Stratford; and\n* Part of the Sessional Division of Winslow.\n1918–1950\n* The Municipal Borough of Buckingham;\n* The Urban Districts of Bletchley, Linslade, and Newport Pagnell;\n* The Rural Districts of Buckingham, Newport Pagnell, Stratford and Wolverton, Wing, and Winslow; and\n* Parts of the Rural Districts of Aylesbury and Long Crendon.\nGained Linslade and the Rural District of Wing from Aylesbury.\n1950–1974\n* The Municipal Borough of Buckingham;\n* The Urban Districts of Bletchley, Linslade, Newport Pagnell, and Wolverton; and\n* The Rural Districts of Buckingham, Newport Pagnell, Wing, and Winslow.\nThe Urban District of Wolverton had succeeded the Rural District of Stratford and Wolverton.

Accordingly, the current contents of the constituency are:\n* The Buckinghamshire Council wards of Aston Clinton and Bierton (part), Bernwood, Buckingham East, Buckingham West, Great Brickhill, Grendon Underwood, Ivinghoe, Ridgeway East (part), Stone and Waddesdon (part), The Risboroughs, Wing (part), and Winslow.\nThe constituency covered a large part of central Buckinghamshire, covering much of the Aylesbury Vale including the town of Buckingham, and some areas south of it, including Chequers, the official country residence of the Prime Minister since 1921. To the north, the remaining part of ceremonial Buckinghamshire forms two Borough of Milton Keynes constituencies (Milton Keynes South and Milton Keynes North).\nAbolition\nFurther to the completion of the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished for the 2024 general election, with its contents distributed three ways:\n* Buckingham, Winslow, Great Brickhill and surrounding rural areas form part of the newly created constituency of Buckingham and Bletchley, with the Bletchley area of the City of Milton Keynes\n* Western areas, extending southwards to Haddenham and Princes Risborough, form part of the new constituency of Mid Buckinghamshire.\n* Wing and Ivinghoe wards were transferred to Aylesbury.\nMembers of Parliament\n*Constituency created (1542)\nMPs to
