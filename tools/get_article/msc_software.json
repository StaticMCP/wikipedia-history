It operates as an independent subsidiary. In September 2025, Cadence Design Systems announced it would acquire the design and engineering business of Hexagon, including MSC Software, for approximately $3.16 billion.\nHistory\nMSC Software Corporation was formed in 1963 under the name MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation (MSC), by Dr. Richard H. MacNeal and Robert Schwendler.  The company developed its first structural analysis software called SADSAM (Structural Analysis by Digital Simulation of Analog Methods) at that time and was deeply involved in the early efforts of the aerospace industry to improve early finite element analysis technology.\nA key milestone was responding to a 1965 request for proposal (RFP) from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for a general-purpose structural analysis program that would eventually become Nastran (NASA Structural Analysis).  The company subsequently pioneered many of the technologies that are now relied upon by industry to analyse and predict stress and strain, vibration and dynamics, acoustics, and thermal analysis.  In 1971, the company released a commercial version of Nastran, named MSC/Nastran.\nTwo years after MSC began marketing MSC/Nastran, the company established its first overseas office in Munich, Germany. Three years after entering Europe, MSC moved eastward and opened an office in Tokyo, Japan. In 1983, MSC made its debut as a public company, and a year later the stock migrated to the American Stock Exchange. The company expanded in 1992 by adding a subsidiary in Moscow, Russia. In 1995, it further expanded its growth by adding an office in Brazil.  In June 1999, MSC's stockholders voted to change the company's name to MSC.Software Corporation.\nIn July 2009, MSC Software was acquired by the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. The \"dot\" was dropped from the company's name in 2011 and the company's name is currently MSC Software Corporation.\nThe company is headquartered in Newport Beach, California and employs approximately 1,400 people in 20 countries.  2016 revenue was US$230 million.  In February 2017, the company was acquired by Swedish engineering services conglomerate Hexagon.\nAcquisitions\nSeptember 1994 — PDA Engineering\nDecember 1998 — Knowledge Revolution\nMay 1999 — MSC Software acquired MARC Analysis Research Corporation to add software that tests complex designs and materials.\nJune 1999 — Universal Analytics Incorporation (UAI)\nNovember 1999 — Computerized Structural Analysis Research Corporation (CSAR)\nMay 2001 — Advanced Enterprise Solutions Inc.
