The award, along with the Best Female Soccer Player ESPY Award, evolved from the Best Soccer Player ESPY Award, which was awarded in 2000 and 2001, and the latter once more absorbed the gender-specific awards in 2005.\nDuring the award's three years, the voting panel comprised variously fans, who participated through Internet balloting; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities.  The ESPY Awards ceremony was conducted in June and awards conferred reflected performance and achievement over the twelve months previous to presentation.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Player\n!National teamrepresented\n!Club team represented\n!Position played primarily\n|-\n|2002\n|Landon Donovan\n|\n|San Jose Earthquakes( Major League Soccer)\n|Forward\n|-\n|2003\n|Ronaldo\n|\n|Real Madrid( La Liga)\n|Forward\n|-\n|2004\n|David Beckham\n|\n|Real Madrid( La Liga)\n|Midfielder\n|}\nSee also\n*FIFA World Player of the Year\n*FIFA World Cup awards\n*African Footballer of the Year\n*Asian Footballer of the Year\n*European Footballer of the Year\n*Oceania Footballer of the Year\n*South American Footballer of the Year\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
