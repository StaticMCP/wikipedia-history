This was also the first presidential election in the state of North Carolina.\nBackground\nNorth Carolina did not participate in the 1788–89 United States presidential election, as it did not ratify the Constitution of the United States until months after the end of that election and after George Washington had assumed office as President of the United States to become the 12th state.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |1792 United States presidential election in North Carolina\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n!Candidate\n!Electoral votes\n|-\n!\n|Independent\n|George Washington\n| align=\"right\" |12\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Totals\n| align=\"right\" |12\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in North Carolina\nReferences"
