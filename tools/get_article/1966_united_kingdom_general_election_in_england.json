On the other hand, the Conservative Party led by Edward Heath won only 216 seats, its lowest share of seats since the 1945 election. It was also only the second time that the Labour Party had won more seats than the Conservatives in England.\nIt was the only election between 1945 and 1997 in which the Labour Party won a majority of seats in England. Concurrently, this was the only election between 1945 and 1997 in which the Labour Party got a working majority in the House of Commons sufficient to last a full term in office. (In 1950, 1964 and October 1974, the Labour majority was 5, 4 and 3 seats respectively.)\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total votes\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Labour\n|285\n|39\n|10,886,408\n|48.0%\n|4.5%\n|-\n|Conservative\n|219\n|43\n|9,692,356\n|42.7%\n|1.4%\n|-\n|Liberal\n|6\n|3\n|2,036,793\n|9.0%\n|3.1%\n|}\n|55.77}}\n|42.85}}\n|1.17}}}}\nReferences\n# Pilling, Sam; Cracknell, Richard (18 August 2021). \"UK Election Statistics: 1918-2021: A Century of Elections\" (PDF).
