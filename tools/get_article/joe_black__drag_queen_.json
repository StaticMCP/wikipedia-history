He is best known for competing on the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK'' and getting eliminated first and fifth, after being voted back on to the show in episode five.\nCareer\nBlack has fulfilled his career as a cabaret performer since 2007, and has become one of the leading figures in the dark cabaret genre. He regularly performs in Brighton (in which he resides) and often performs at the annual Brighton Fringe festival. Black has cited his love for music as one of the main reasons he's kept on pursuing his career; he often plays the piano, accordion, musical saw, ukulele and theremin at his performances. Black has toured extensively across the UK, Europe, Australia and America for more than a decade. This included a UK tour with the season 9 contestant of ''RuPaul's Drag Race, Sasha Velour.\nIn December 2020, Black was announced as one of twelve contestants competing on the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK''. Black was the first contestant eliminated in a lip sync challenge against contestant Bimini Bon-Boulash to the song \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. However, Black returned in episode five when the previously eliminated queens returned from a forced COVID-19 production break (excluding Ginny Lemon) and won his spot back in the competition after the contestants voted to bring him back. Black was again eliminated following a lip sync challenge against contestant Tia Kofi to the song \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" by The Communards. He is the first contestant to return after being eliminated from ''RuPaul's Drag Race UK. Since his elimination, Black announced a UK Tour titled Decopunk, which began touring in September 2021, as well as the release of a 40% ABV limited edition gin of the same name.
