In census data, Powari is included among the varieties of Hindi.\nGeographical distribution\nPowari is spoken in the Balaghat district and  Seoni district of Madhya Pradesh and Bhandara district and  Gondia district of Maharashtra. by Powar Community migrated from Western Malwa. This language is noted in the first Linguistic Survey of India done by George Abraham Grierson.\nPowari seems to be mixture of Bundeli, Bagheli, Marathi,  Malvi, Gondi and Nimadi. A large impact of Bagheli and Bundeli can be seen on Powari dialect as the Powars of Malwa migrated to this area through Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand. As the  Powars  are residing since 300 years in Central province after their migration, impact of local language and marathi is there. This Dialect became unique as it was developed through addition & mixing of other dialects.\nReferences"
