The Annals of Wales are undated but Phillimore placed the following entry in the year 722:\n}}\nAlthough the Annals of Wales does not specifically identify the Anglo-Saxons as the enemy, it is considered that the failure to specify an enemy was simply because it would have been obvious. While other theories suggest the battle could have been between the Welsh and Cornish themselves.\nThe Chronicle of Princes seems to refute this logic, specifically excluding Pencoed from Rhodri Molwynog's conflict with the Saxons that year:\n}}\nLocation\nCastell Pen-y-Coed, an earthwork in Carmarthenshire, Wales has been suggested as the possible site of the battle of Pencon.\nAnother site is next to Coed y Mwstwr (lit. Field of the Muster) and Ogof y Pebyll (caves next the Encampments) at Pencoed, near Bridgend in Glamorgan\nReferences"
