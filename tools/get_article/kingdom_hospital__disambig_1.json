While initially conceived as a miniseries, it was later changed into a regular television series (albeit one that lasted one season). It was first aired on ABC on March 3 and concluded on July 15, 2004 after being put on hold during NBA playoffs.\nKingdom Hospital has been compared to the paranormal hospital drama series All Souls, another production which had been inspired by Von Trier's The Kingdom.\nPlot\nThe story tells of the fictional Kingdom Hospital located in Lewiston, Maine, built on the site of a mill that manufactured military uniforms during the American Civil War. Previously, a hospital known as the \"Old Kingdom\" had been built on the site, but it burned down. The current hospital is known as the \"New Kingdom\". The hospital's \"turbulent\" nature seems to reflect its ominous logo, a crimson stylized dagger, predicting what will come.\nA psychic named Mrs. Druse has checked into the hospital numerous times and is taken by the staff to be a hypochondriac. She asks for the assistance of the cynical yet compassionate Dr. Hook to uncover the truth about the hospital and the mysterious spirits who haunt it – including a sinister teenage boy, a young girl who had died in the fire that burned the mill down, and a strange animal that follows and protects the young girl, who calls it Antubis (it is similar to a giant anteater, but whose long snout opens up to a set of jagged teeth).\nElsewhere, Peter Rickman, a painter who is admitted to the hospital following a road accident (with severe injuries to his skull and spine) begins to discover the ghastly goings-on while he lies comatose in room 426.\nOther subplots included the initiation of arrogant chief of surgery Dr. Stegman into the secret society known as the 'Keepers', and the challenged-at-every-turn flirtation between young Dr. Elmer Traff and sleep doctor Dr. Lona Massingale.\nCast\nThe hospital staff\n* Andrew McCarthy as Dr. Hook, a surgeon and a member of the Keepers.\n* Bruce Davison as Dr. Stegman, a neurosurgeon who is on the verge of being initiated into the Keepers, and is facing a malpractice suit.\n* Meagen Fay as Dr. Brenda Abelson, Dr. Stegman friend and love interest.\n* Ed Begley Jr. as Dr. Jesse James, Kingdom Hospital's Chief of Staff and member of the Keepers, who spends his time initiating \"Operation: Morning Air\".\n* Jamie Harrold as Dr. Elmer Traff, a young surgeon and son of Dr. Louis Traff.

Otto often accompanied by Blondi, an intelligent German Shepherd Dog.

Blondi's name is a reference to Adolf Hitler's favorite German Shepherd Dog, also named Blondi.\n* Del Pentecost as Bobby Druse, Mrs. Druse's son, and an orderly at the hospital.\nPatients, past and present\n* Diane Ladd as Sally Druse, a professed psychic, who regularly checks into Kingdom Hospital for all sorts of complaints, and who is determined to discover the truth lurking in the hospital's depths.\n* Jack Coleman as Peter Rickman, a comatose painter who is discovering the past and future of Kingdom Hospital.

Davis (The X-Files), and Stephen King (\"writer\") all have guest appearances.\nProduction\nKing and producer Mark Carliner discovered the source material, the five-hour Danish television movie called Riget (Kingdom in English), while searching through a video store during the making of the 1997 TV miniseries adaptation of King's novel The Shining. They tried to buy the rights to the Danish original, only to learn that Columbia Pictures had acquired them and intended to make a theatrical movie. After five years, Columbia concluded the work could not be adapted in two-hour form and sold the rights in exchange for the rights to King's novella \"Secret Window, Secret Garden\" from the 1990 book Four Past Midnight.\nThis was the first time he had adapted someone else's work rather than his own from scratch. King kept most of the characters and dark humor in place, but added a new central character named Peter Rickman who was based on his own personal experience after being hit by a minivan. King described the finished product as \"the thing I like best out of all the things I've done.\" The series is known for its tangential plots and characters who recur throughout, as King called it a \"novelization for television\". King committed to write the story line for the following year, should ABC decide to continue the series.\nWhile written as a miniseries, many fans wanted it to be renewed for a second season, and Stephen King had a storyboard written out for one. After incredibly successful ratings for the first episode, the highest rating drama debut of the year on ABC, ratings plummeted thereafter. Despite being cancelled, the series did receive Emmy Award nominations for Special Visual Effects for a Series and Main Title Design.\nEpisodes\n|Viewers = 14.04.\n|ShortSummary = Date: October 22, 2003Peter Rickman is admitted to hospital and, while in surgery, begins to discover Kingdom Hospital is more than it seems; Dr. Stegman asks vacuous Chief of Staff Dr. James to help him rid the hospital of hypochondriac Mrs. Druse; and earthquakes hit Kingdom.\n|LineColor = A4937B\n}}\n|Viewers = 8.5\n|ShortSummary = Date: October 22, 2003Peter's hit-and-run driver arrives at Kingdom, becoming one of the first to witness the strange events building there; Elmer attempts to attract Lona during a dinner in the morgue; and Hook schemes to keep Mrs. Druse on for observational purposes.\n|LineColor = A4937B\n}}\n|Viewers = 7.1\n|ShortSummary = Date: October 22, 2003Dr. Hook becomes drawn into Mrs. Druse's plight after seeing the ghost of Mary; a prisoner and his girlfriend plan a suicide pact gone wrong when the prisoner is saved by the staff; Dr. Stegman is accused of malpractice again; and Peter is visited by the spirits of Kingdom in the form of Mary and Paul.\n|LineColor = A4937B\n}}\n|Viewers = 5.4\n|ShortSummary = Date: October 23, 2003Dr. Traff's ex-wife dies on the operating table; Elmer dreams of Antubis; the deceased Lenny helps Mrs. Druse in her quest; Stegman goes crazy after finding his car defaced and decides to find the culprits; Paul uses Pedersen to get rid of Mrs. Druse.

The New York Times review argued that the \"plot unfolds disjointedly and without enough suspense.\" CNN felt the premiere was promising and the \"jittery pacing and oddball sensibility\" were reminiscent of Twin Peaks. The USA Today review stated that the show \"does have a few frightening moments, but they don't compensate for the lackluster performances, the absence of character development, humor or pacing, or the wild fluctuations in tone.\"\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the series a 46% approval rating based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.90/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Stephen King may bring autobiographical flourishes to this remake of a Danish series, but the self-indulgent Kingdom Hospital lacks the horror maestro's penchant for good scares.\"\nMusic\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Song\n!style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Performer\n!style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Episode\n!style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Context\n|-\n| \"Worry About You\"\n| Ivy\n| All episodes\n| Theme music, and heard throughout episodes.\n|-\n| \"Red Dragon Tattoo\"\n| Fountains of Wayne\n| \"Thy Kingdom Come\" (and others)\n| First heard while Peter is jogging.\n|-\n| \"I'll Be Seeing You\"\n| Frank Sinatra\n| \"Thy Kingdom Come\"\n| Heard when the wife receives the news of the accident.\n|-\n| \"Wee Wee Hours\"\n| Chuck Berry\n| \"The West Side of Midnight\"\n| Heard at the start of the episode.\n|-\n| \"Where's Your Head At\"\n| Basement Jaxx\n| \"The Young and the Headless\"\n| Played as the headless body searches for his head.\n|-\n| \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\"\n| Unknown Artist **\n| \"Butterfingers\"\n| Sung by many characters, including Paul.
