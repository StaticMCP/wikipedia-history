Once the regular season was complete, the NAIA sponsored a 16-team playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll was then taken after completion of the 2011 NAIA Football National Championship.\nPoll release dates\nThe poll release dates were:\n* April 18, 2011 (Spring)\n* August 8, 2011 (Preseason)\n* September 12, 2011\n* September 19, 2011\n* September 26, 2011\n* October 3, 2011\n* October 10, 2011\n* October 17, 2011\n* October 24, 2011\n* October 31, 2011\n* November 7, 2011\n*

has been held by only a select group of teams. Through the end of 2011, the team and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll was presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 Rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Carroll (MT)||56 (6)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||55 (3)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||23 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Northwestern Oklahoma State||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||9 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Saint Francis (IN)||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Marian (IN)||2\n|}\nReferences"
