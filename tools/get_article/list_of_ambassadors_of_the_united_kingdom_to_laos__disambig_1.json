After autonomy from France in 1949, the post was initially carried out on a non-resident basis in conjunction with British ambassador to Vietnam. From 1955 until 1985 there was a full ambassador to the Republic, then until 2012 the post was combined with that of British ambassador to Thailand. The official title is 'His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the Lao People's Democratic Republic or HMA Vientiane'. From October 2012, the United Kingdom once again has a resident ambassador in Vientiane.\nNon-resident ambassadors to Laos (and ambassador to Vietnam)\n* 1951&ndash;(1955): Sir Hubert Graves\nAmbassadors to Laos\n* 1954&ndash;1956: The Lord Talbot de Malahide\n* 1956&ndash;1958: Leonard Holliday\n* 1958&ndash;1960: Sir Anthony Lincoln\n* 1960&ndash;1962: Sir John Addis\n* 1962&ndash;1965: Sir Donald Hopson\n* 1965&ndash;1967: Sir Frederick Warner\n* 1967&ndash;1970: Sir Harold Smedley\n* 1970&ndash;1973: John Lloyd\n* 1973&ndash;1975: Alan Davidson\n* 1976&ndash;1978: Donald Cape\n* 1978&ndash;1980: John Stewart\n* 1982&ndash;1985: Bernard Dobbs\nNon-resident ambassadors to Laos (and ambassador to Thailand)\n* (1981)&ndash;1986: Justin Staples\n* 1986&ndash;1989: Derek Tonkin\n* 1989&ndash;1992: Sir Ramsay Melhuish\n* 1992&ndash;1996: Christian Adams\n* 1996&ndash;2000: Sir James Hodge\n* 2000&ndash;2003: Barney Smith\n* 2003&ndash;2007: David Fall\n* 2007&ndash;2010: Quinton Quayle\n* 2010&ndash;2012: Asif Ahmad\nAmbassadors to Laos\n* 2012&ndash;2015: Philip Malone\n* 2015&ndash;2019: Hugh Evans\n* 2019&ndash;: John Pearson\n* 2023&ndash;present: [https://www.gov.uk/government/people/mel-barlow Melanie Barlow]\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gov.uk/government/world/laos UK and Laos], gov.uk"
