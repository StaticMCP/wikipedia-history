Narsi Reddy was killed, on 17 August 2005 a ban was re-imposed in Andhra Pradesh on the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and its frontal organisations including the AIRSF and the Radical Youth League.\nBans were repeatedly reimposed, one year at a time.  In August 2006 the ban was extended for a year.\nIn August 2009 the Andhra Pradesh government extended the ban for another year.\nIn August 2011 the ban was again extended for another year.\nReferences\n}}"
