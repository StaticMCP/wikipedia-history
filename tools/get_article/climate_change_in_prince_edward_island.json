Prince Edward Island's greenhouse gas targets would require less than 1.2 million tonnes of emissions per year in 2030.\nImpacts of climate change\nFish and farming\nIn 2020, there was an increase in the number of \"chub\" mackerel being caught by PEI fishermen and the number of lobster landings in PEI waters, compared to previous years. Potato yields would be expected to decrease by between 5% to 10% over the 50 years from 2024.\nInfrastructure and built environment\nThere are expected to be 500 buildings in downtown Charlottestown which would become \"at risk\" over the 75 years from 2025 to 2100.\nResponse\nPolicies\nShoreline management plans\nThe Prince Edward Island government has developed plans to manage coastal areas, but they lack a land-use component.\nLegislation\nClimate Leadership Act\nThe Climate Leadership Act was implemented the province's carbon tax of 4.4 cents per litre on gasoline and 4.4 cents per litre on diesel. This was introduced at the same time as a separate bill which reduced the carbon tax, which was criticised as being more about politics rather than reducing emissions.\nThe Green Party of Prince Edward Island proposed changing the emissions target in the legislation from 1.4 million tonnes of greenhouse gases to 1.2 million tonnes.\nNet-zero Carbon Act\nFollowing the proposal from the Green Party, the Climate Leadership Act was amended, with the amendment bill receiving support from all three parties in the Legislative Assembly. The Act requires Prince Edward Island to reach net zero emissions by 2040.  The Act has been described very positively: \"foundations of a good climate plan\". The Act requires the implementation of a multistakeholder advisory panel.\nIn the one year after the passage of the Act, emissions rose by 2.8%.\nSee also\n* Climate change in Canada\nReferences"
