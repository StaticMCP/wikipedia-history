The stadium has fallen in a state of disrepair and is now used as a parking. The stadium was used mostly for football matches and was the home training pitch of Floriana. The stadium held 3,000 people.\nBackground and description\nHistory\nWhen Malta was a crown colony of the United Kingdom, the Arena was mainly used for training purposes by the British Military in preparation of important ceremonies. The grandstand, which is still present to this say, was erected in anticipation of Malta's Independence celebrations. Indeed, on 21 September 1964 the Maltese flag was hosted for the first time at the stadium. This also explains why the stadium was named the Independence Arena and why it is held in fond regard by the Maltese public in general.\nFuture\nOver the years, Floriana expressed their willingness to develop the stadium on more than one occasion. During a supporters rally held on 22 August 2024, Floriana unveiled plans for a new 4,000 all-seater football stadium.\nSee also\n*List of football stadiums in Malta\nReferences"
