In the , Lotus Creek had a population of 113 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is loosely bounded to the south-west by the Isaac River and to the west by its tributary Connors River and to the north-west by its tributary Funnel Creek.\nThe Marlborough-Sarina Road enters the locality from the south (Clarkes Creek) and exits to the north (Oxford).\nThe Tierawoomba State Forest is in the north-east of the locality extending into neighbouring Oxford. Apart from this protected area, the predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nBaradha (also known as Barada, Toolginburra, Baradaybahrad, Thararraburra, Toolginburra, and Baradha) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Baradha people. The Baradha language region includes the locality of Lotus Creek and extends along the inland ranges towards Nebo and extends along the Connors River catchment.\nThe Marlborough-Sarina Road was formerly part of the Bruce Highway. However, it developed a reputation as a \"horror road\" as it was narrow and winding with creekbed crossings and many vehicles sustained damage. A number of murders of travellers using the road (e.g. the 1975 murders of Noel and Sophia Weckert) caused fear. In 1974, it was decided that a coastal route via Carmila would be developed to eliminate the Malborough-Sarina Road from the Bruce Highway.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lotus Creek had a population of 75 people.\nIn the , Lotus Creek had a population of 113 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Lotus Creek. The nearest government primary schools are:\n* Nebo State School in Nebo to the north-west\n* St Lawrence State School in neighbouring St Lawrence to the south-west\n* Clarke Creek State School in neighbouring Clarke Creek to the south\nHowever, some parts of Lotus Creek are too distant from these schools for a daily commute and there is no nearby secondary school. The alternatives are distance education and boarding schools.\nReferences"
