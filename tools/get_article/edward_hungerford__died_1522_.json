He served in the English army in France in 1513, when he was knighted at the siege of Tournai. He was Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1517, and Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset in 1518.\nIn 1520, he attended Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He died on 24 January 1522, survived by his second wife Agnes who was sole executrix of his will.\nFamily\nSir Edward married twice. His first wife was Jane de la Zouche daughter of John, 7th Lord Zouche. She was appointed to wait on Catherine of Aragon in October 1501. They had one child Walter (1503–1540) who was created 1st Baron Hungerford of Heytesbury in 1536.\nSir Edward's second wife was Agnes Cotell. Agnes had strangled her first husband just before she married again to Sir Edward. Not until Sir Edward's death were proceedings taken against her and her accomplices for the murder. She and Mathewe were then convicted and were hanged at Tyburn on 20 February 1524; Sir Edward's involvement in the murder or cover-up is unclear.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nAttribution:\n* Endnotes\n**Dugdale's Baronage;\n**Burke's Extinct Peerage;\n**Hoare's Hungerfordiana, 1823;\n**Jackson's Guide to Farleigh-Hungerford, 1853, and Sheriffs of Wiltshire; Burnet's Hist. of Reformation, i. 566–7;\n**Hall's Society in the Elizabethan Age;\n**Hoare's Modern Wiltshire, Heytesbury Hundred, pp.&nbsp;110 sq.;\n**Brewer and Gairdner's Letters and Papers of Henry VIII; Antiquary, ii. 233.\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
