In it Hayek condemns the positivist view of the social sciences for what he sees as scientism, arguing that attempts to apply the methods of natural science to the study of social institutions necessarily overlook the dispersed knowledge of the individuals which compose those institutions.\nSynopsis\nThis book is divided into three parts. The first is a reworking of Hayek's essay \"Scientism and the Study of Society\". The second part is an intellectual history of French positivism. Hayek lifts the title of the book from a name given to the movement by Louis de Bonald, a French counter-revolutionary and contemporary of Saint-Simon. The last segment examines Comte and Hegel, and their similar takes on the philosophy of history. The first two sections were both originally published in the peer-reviewed magazine Economica, in the early 1940s.\nIn Hayek's view the task of the natural sciences is to replace the qualitative description of nature provided by the senses with a quantitative description which is arrived at through experiment:\nHayek then goes on to argue that, in this view, the methods of the natural sciences are inadequate in the social sciences because subjective knowledge, the knowledge that other people classify the world as we do, is relevant to the study of human activity:\nPublishing history\nParts of the book were published in Economica magazine in the early 1940s. The book itself was compiled and printed in 1952. It eventually fell out of print, but was re-published in the US in 1980, and has remained available since.\nReception\nCzech Neo-Marxist Karel Kosík in his book Dialectics of the Concrete (1976) criticizes the following passage of the book: \"The object of scientific inquiry is never the totality of all observable phenomena in a given time and space, but always only certain aspects of it ... The human spirit can never encompass the 'whole' in the sense of all different aspects of the real situation\". Kosík, who believes Hayek wrote it in a polemic against Marxist concept of totality, clarifies that, \"Totality indeed does not signify all facts. Totality signifies reality as structured dialectical whole, within which any particular fact (or any group or set of facts) can be rationally comprehended\" as \"the cognition of a fact or of a set of facts is the cognition of their place in the totality of reality.\" He considers Hayek's theory to be part of the atomist–rationalist philosophical thinking of reality, declaring \"Opinions as to whether cognition of all facts is knowable or not are based on the rationalist–empiricist idea that cognition proceeds by the analytic–summative method. This idea is in turn based on the atomist idea of reality as a sum of things, processes and facts\". Kosík claims that Hayek and those philosophers (including Karl Popper on The Poverty of Historicism and Ferdinand Gonseth of Dialectica) lack the understanding of the dialectical process of forming the totality.\nAmerican philosopher Susan Haack references Hayek's book several times in her 2009 essay \"Six Signs of Scientism\".\nReferences\nNotes\nArticles\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
