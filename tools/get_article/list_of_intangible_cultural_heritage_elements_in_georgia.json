As part of a country's cultural heritage, they include celebrations, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music, and the making of handicrafts. The term \"intangible cultural heritage\" is formally established by the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which was drafted in 2003 and took effect in 2006. Inscription of new heritage elements on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists for their protection and safeguarding is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, an organization established by the convention. Georgia ratified the Convention on 18 March 2008.\nStarting from 2011, 50 items were inscribed on the national registry of Georgia's Intangible Cultural Heritage () as of March 2020. Four of them have been placed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\nIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\nUNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity consists of three lists.\nRepresentative List\nThis list aims to represent the intangible cultural heritage of Georgia worldwide and bring awareness to its significance.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders sticky-header\" caption=\"Tabulated list of elements on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 180px;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Media\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Georgian polyphonic singing\n|\n| 2008\n| [https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/georgian-polyphonic-singing-00008 00008]\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Ancient Georgian traditional Qvevri wine-making method\n|\n| 2013\n| [https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/ancient-georgian-traditional-qvevri-wine-making-method-00870 00870]\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Living culture of three writing systems of the Georgian alphabet\n|\n| 2016\n| [https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/living-culture-of-three-writing-systems-of-the-georgian-alphabet-01205 01205]\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Chidaoba, wrestling in Georgia\n|\n| 2018\n| [https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/chidaoba-wrestling-in-georgia-01371 01371]\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://ich.unesco.org/en/home UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage]: Official site\n* [https://ich.unesco.org/en/state/georgia-GE  UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in Georgia]: Official site"
