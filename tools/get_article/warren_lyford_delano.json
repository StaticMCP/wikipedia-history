Since then, PyMOL has been widely adopted for molecular structure visualization within the pharmaceutical industry and at public sector research institutions.\nIn 2003, DeLano founded DeLano Scientific LLC to commercialize PyMOL and conduct an experiment in the \"laboratory of the market\" regarding the commercial viability of an open source software company. His hypothesis was that open source software is intrinsically optimal for science, and that scientific software companies which provide open source solutions will, through free market competition, eventually displace companies that favor proprietary solutions.\nDelano was married to Beth Pehrson.\nHe died by suicide on 3 November 2009 at his home in Palo Alto, California.\nIn 2009 the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology created the DeLano Award for Computational Biosciences in DeLano's honor. The award acknowledges a scientist for the most accessible and innovative development or application of computer technology to enhance research in the life sciences at the molecular level.\nPublic quotes\nReferences"
