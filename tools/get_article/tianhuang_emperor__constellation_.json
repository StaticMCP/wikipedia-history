The name is found in \"Kaiyuan Zyutsukyou\" (The Divination Sutra), \"Volume 69: Gan Ji Zhong Guan Zui\".

This \"mouth\" refers to the quadrilateral of the constellation , which guards the Emperor's palace, the Purple Palace where the Emperor resides, and is depicted by its second star (Ursa Major, 4th magnitude), first star (Alpha Polaris, 2nd magnitude), fifth star (Cepheus [http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?protocol=html&Ident=HD5848 HD5848], 4th magnitude), and sixth star ([http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?protocol=html&Ident=HD217382 HD217382], 5th magnitude). The Emperor is the 5th magnitude star ([http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?protocol=html&Ident=HD212710 HD212710]) in the quadrilateral.
