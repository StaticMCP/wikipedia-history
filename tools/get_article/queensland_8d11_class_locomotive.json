After being rebuilt as works number 850, it was trialled by the Queensland Railways on the Ipswich to Toowoomba line and later purchased.\nNumbered 41, it was named Governor Cairns. Per Queensland Railway's classification system it was designated the 8D11 class, 8 representing that it had eight driving wheels, D that it was a tank locomotive and the 11 the cylinder diameter in inches. It was scrapped in 1902.\nReferences"
