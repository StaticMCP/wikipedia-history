It is divided into three categories: those ancient structures that can be seen today as ruins or reconstructions, ancient structures that have vanished or exist only as fragments, and churches of the later, Christian, era.\nMany of the Forum's monuments were originally built in the periods of the Roman Kingdom (753 BC–509 BC) and the Roman Republic (509 BC–27 BC), although most were destroyed and rebuilt several times. The existing ruins generally date from the Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD).\nExisting (or reconstructed) ruins\nTemples\n*Temple of Castor and Pollux (494 BC)\n*Temple of Saturn (501 BC)\n*Temple of Vesta (7th century BC)\n*Temple of Venus and Roma (135)\n*Temple of Antoninus and Faustina (141)\n*Temple of Caesar (29 BC)\n*Temple of Vespasian and Titus (79)\n*Temple of Romulus (309)\nBasilicas\n* Basilica Aemilia\n* Basilica Julia\n* Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine\n**Colossus of Constantine, colossal statue formerly in the west apse of the Basilica of Maxentius\nArches\n* Arch of Septimius Severus\n* Arch of Titus\n* Arch of Constantine\nGovernment buildings or official residences\n* Regia, originally the residence of the kings of Rome or at least their main headquarters, and later the office of the Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Roman religion.\n* Curia Julia, official meeting place of the Roman Senate (built by Julius Caesar, 44 BC; later reconstruction by Diocletian, 305 AD)\n* Tabularium, the records office of Rome; inside is the Tabularium Museum\n* Portico Dii Consentes (\"Portico of the Harmonious Gods\")\n* Atrium Vestae, the house of the Vestal Virgins.\n* Tullianum, the prison used to hold various foreign leaders and generals.\nSmaller monuments\n* Rostra (New Rostra, Rostra Augusti), platform from which politicians made their speeches to the Roman citizens\n* Umbilicus urbis Romae, the designated centre (\"navel\") of the city from which, and to which, all distances in Rome and the Roman Empire were measured (probably identical with the Mundus Cereris)\n* Milliarium Aureum After Augustus erected this monument, all roads were considered to begin here and all distances in the Roman Empire were measured relative to that point.\n* Column of Phocas, the last monument built within the Forum.\n* Lapis Niger (\"Black Stone\"), a very ancient shrine which was obscure even to the Romans.\n* Plutei of Trajan (Plutei Traiani), now in the Curia Julia\nPools, springs\n* The Lacus Curtius, the site of a mysterious pool venerated by Romans even after they had forgotten what it signified.\n* The Lacus Iuturnae (\"Spring of Juturna\"), a healing pool where Castor and Pollux were said to have watered their horses\nRoads, streets, staircases\n* Gemonian stairssteps situated in the central part of Rome, leading from the Arx of the Capitoline Hill down to the Roman Forum.\n* Clivus Capitolinus was the street that started at the Arch of Tiberius, wound around the Temple of Saturn, and ended at Capitoline Hill.\n* Via Sacra, the famous processional street of Roman Triumphs; linked the Atrium Vestae with the Colosseum.\n* Vicus Jugarius (\"Street of the Yoke-Makers\")\nVanished (or almost vanished) structures\nAssociated with the old Comitium\n*Curia Hostilia (c. 560 BC-c. 80 BC), original meeting place of the Senate (replaced by the Curia Cornelia)\n*Basilica Porcia (184 BC), first basilica in the Forum area; built by Marcus Portius Cato (Cato the Elder)\n*Curia Cornelia (c. 80 BC-c. 50 BC), subsequent meeting place of the Senate (replaced by the Curia Julia)\n*Rostra Vetera (Old Rostra), main speaker's platform until it was replaced by the nearby Rostra Augusta (New Rostra)\n*Graecostasis, platform or \"grandstand\" for Greek and other foreign ambassadors\n*Statue of Attus Navius and the Ficus Navia (Navian fig tree), in front of the Curia Hostilia (the well-being of Rome was supposed to be dependent upon the health of this sacred fig-tree)\n*Columna Maenia (\"Column of Maenius\"), a commemorative column celebrating the (second) Battle of Antium (338 BC)\n*Columna Rostrata C.
