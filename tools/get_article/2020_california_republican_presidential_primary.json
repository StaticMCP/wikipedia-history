In August 2019, Trump sued the State of California, seeking to block implementation of the law SB 27, asserting that the law is unconstitutional. On September 19, 2019, U.S. District Judge Morrison C. England issued a temporary injunction blocking the law from taking effect. California is appealing; California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said: \"Our elected leaders have a legal and moral obligation to be transparent with voters about potential conflicts of interest. This law is fundamental to preserving and protecting American democracy.\"\nCalifornia's Supreme Court ruled that Senate Bill 27 could not come into effect. According to The Sacramento Bee, this means that \"President Donald Trump won't have to release his tax returns to get on California's 2020 primary ballot\".\nAlternative convention\nAfter Governor Newsom signed the bill, the Republican state committee met in emergency session to set up an alternative convention in order to give him all their delegates should the secretary of the state bar him because of his refusal to submit his taxes.\nAfter the supreme court's action in November 2019, plans for an alternative convention were shelved.\nCandidates\nTo qualify for ballot access, a candidate must be determined by the Secretary of State to be a generally-recognized candidate, or by circulating nomination papers.\n\"Generally advocated for or recognized candidate\" or \"recognized candidate\" means an individual who has an authorized campaign committee registered with the Federal Election Commission for the office of President of the United States and submits proof of at least one of the following criteria:\n*a. qualified for funding under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 (52 U.S.C.

A \"political party qualified to participate in a primary election\" means any political party qualified in California, a major or minor-ballot qualified political party in another state, or a national committee of a political party recognized by the Federal Election Commission.\n*c. placed or qualified for placement on a presidential primary ballot or a caucus ballot of a major or minor ballot-qualified political party in at least one other state in the current presidential election cycle.\n*d. candidate or qualified to be a candidate in a caucus of a major or minor ballot-qualified political party in at least one other state in the current presidential election cycle.\n*e. has the following: current presidential campaign internet website or webpage hosted by the candidate or a qualified political party, and a written request submitted on the candidate's behalf by a party qualified to participate in the primary election to the Secretary of State requesting the candidate be placed on the presidential primary ballot. §§ 6000.11, 6000.2\nAmong the challengers to incumbent President Donald Trump who had submitted their applications with enough qualifications were New York advertising executive Robert Ardini and Manhattan Beach attorney Matthew Matern.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em\" | 2020 California Republican presidential primary\n|-\n!
