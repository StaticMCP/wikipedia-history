The later members including fellow Australian, John Farnham, and US-based musicians, were not included in this induction. Due to a 2002 legal ruling on their right to use the band's name—two US-based members held the trademark—they performed as Classic Lineup of the Little River Band or Little River Band – Classic Lineup (sources vary). Shorrock had already been inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1991 and Farnham was inducted, for his solo work, in 2003.\nPerformers\nThe following artists performed on stage during the 2004 ARIA Awards:\n*Delta Goodrem\n*Eskimo Joe\n*Guy Sebastian\n*Kasey Chambers\n*Jet\n*John Butler Trio\n*Missy Higgins\n*Pete Murray\n*Shannon Noll\n*Spiderbait\nChannel V Oz Artist of the Year award\n*Guy Sebastian\n**Jet\n**Delta Goodrem\n**Grinspoon\n**John Butler Trio\nSee also\n*Music of Australia\n*Rock music in Australia\nReferences"
