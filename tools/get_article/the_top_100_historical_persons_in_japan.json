The program featured the results of a survey that asked Japanese people to choose their favorite great person from history. The show featured several re-enactments of scenes from the lives of the people on the list.\nThe survey asked Japanese people to name their most-liked historical figures, not the most influential. The selection was not restricted to Japanese people, and only about two thirds of the names are Japanese, mostly important Japanese historical figures, such as samurai, prime ministers, war leaders, authors, poets, and popular Meiji Restoration figures.\nThe program was followed up with a women-only Top-100 list (ニッポン人が好きな100人の美人) which aired September 23, 2006, and ''History's 100 Most Influential People: Hero Edition '' which aired in March 2007.\nList\nThe final list was as follows:\n#  Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582) daimyō in the 16th century\n#  Sakamoto Ryōma (1836–1867) The samurai who overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate in bakumatsu Japan.\n#  Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–1598) politician, samurai who is regarded as Japan's second \"great unifier\"\n#  Matsushita Kōnosuke (1894–1989) industrialist, founder of Panasonic\n#  Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616) The founder and first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate\n#  Minamoto Yoshitsune (1159–1189) A military commander of the Minamoto clan of Japan in the late Heian and early Kamakura periods\n#  Mother Teresa (1910–1997) Roman Catholic nun and missionary\n#  Helen Keller (1880–1968) author and lecturer who was a deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree\n#  Hijikata Toshizō (1835–1869) Fukucho of Shinsengumi, a great swordsman and a talented military leader who resisted the Meiji Restoration\n#  Noguchi Hideyo (1876–1928) bacteriologist who in 1911 discovered the agent of syphilis as the cause of progressive paralytic disease.\n#  Saigō Takamori (1828–1877) One of the three great nobles who led the Meiji Restoration.\n#  Princess Diana (1961–1997) Member of British royal family, philanthropist and known for her charity work\n#  Albert Einstein (1879–1955) physicist, known for theory of relativity\n#  Misora Hibari (1937–1989) singer and actress\n#  Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835–1901) Japanese author, writer, teacher, translator, entrepreneur and journalist who founded Keio University\n#   Anne Frank (1929–1945) diarist, known for \"Het Achterhuis\"\n#  Florence Nightingale (1820–1910) English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing.\n#  Yoshida Shigeru (1878–1967) Prime Minister of Japan\n#  Walt Disney (1901–1966) Entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.\n#  Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) German composer and pianist\n#  Ayrton Senna (1960–1994) One of the greatest formula one drivers of all time\n#  Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) polymath, universal genius\n#  Tezuka Osamu (1928–1989)  Manga artist who created Astro Boy, cartoonist, animator, film producer, medical doctor\n#  Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) Emperor of French\n#  Prince Shōtoku (574–622) Semi-legendary regent and a politician of the Asuka period in Japan who served under Empress Suiko.\n#  John Lennon (1940–1980) Member of The Beatles\n#  Zhuge Liang (181–234) Imperial Chancellor and regent of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period\n#  Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) Japanese swordsman, philosopher, writer and rōnin.\n#  Ozaki Yutaka (1965–1992) Musician\n#  Audrey Hepburn (1929–1993) British actress during Hollywood's Golden Age, dancer and humanitarian.\n#  Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) activist, that led to Indian independence movement against British rule.\n#  Soseki Natsume (1867–1916) novelist\n#  Takasugi Shinsaku (1839–1867) Samurai from the Chōshū Domain of Japan who contributed significantly to the Meiji Restoration.\n#  Murasaki Shikibu novelist and poet\n#  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) Austria's greatest composer\n#  Yamamoto Isoroku (1884–1943) Marshal Admiral of the Navy and the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet during World War II\n#  Miyazawa Kenji (1896–1933) author for children's literature\n#  John F.
