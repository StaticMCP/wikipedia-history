As a branch of the military, the force is under the executive administration of the Vietnam Ministry of National Defence.\nDue to the mausoleum's large size, high number of visitors, the technical specifications for the preservation of Ho Chi Minh's body, need for security and need for propaganda work, on 28 December 1975, the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission issued Decision No. 279/VP-QU approving the establishment of the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum Protection Command. On 14 May 1976, the Ministry of National Defense issued Decision No. 109/QD-QP restructuring the command, placing it directly under the Ministry of National Defense.\nReferences"
