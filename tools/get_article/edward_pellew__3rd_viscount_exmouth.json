He was the grandson of Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth.\nEdward Pellew was born on 14 February 1811, the eldest son of Pownoll Pellew, 2nd Viscount Exmouth, and Eliza Harriet Barlow. His father died less than 11 months after inheriting the viscountcy and barony, and Edward acceded to the titles in December 1833.  During his lifetime he continued to receive the £2,000 annual pension that had been awarded to the holder of the title of Viscount Exmouth that was first awarded to his grandfather (approximately equal to $228,000 in 2016).\nHe married Madeline Honorine Dobrowolska of Paris, France (died 22 January 1870), on 8 July 1858 at St. Marylebone Parish Church, Middlesex, England.  Her father was Louis Stanislas Dobrowolski.\nEdward Pellew died 11 February 1876 in Kensington, London, England.  Because he had no children, he was succeeded in his titles by his nephew Edward Fleetwood John Pellew, 4th Viscount Exmouth, the son of Hon. Fleetwood John Pellew, fourth son of the second Viscount Exmouth.\nArms\n}}\nReferences"
