It models protein-ligand docking using the CHARMM program. Volunteer computing allows an extensive search of protein-ligand docking conformations and selection of near-native ligand conformations are achieved by using ligand based hierarchical clustering. The ultimate aim was the development of new pharmaceutical drugs.\nThe project was retired on May 23, 2014.\nSee also\n*List of volunteer computing projects\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n\n---\n\n## Docking@home\n\n#REDIRECT Docking@Home"
