Don't You?'' from 1986 and 1989's Lift Me Up both went top 40 on the rival Network Chart.\nIn the United States, it was the third single from the album, and reached #76 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.  As was the case in the UK, it was the lowest charting US hit of Jones' career to that time.\nThe track was more successful in some European territories, reaching top twenty in Ireland and top five in Sweden.\nCritical reception\nWilliam Shaw of Smash Hits welcomed Jones return. He priced \"slightly electro-ish\" and \"harder\" new sound and called the song as a best \"he's ever written.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Jones.\n*UK release\n;7\"\n*\"All I Want\" – 4:38\n*\"Roll Right Up\" – 4:49\n;12\"\n*\"All I Want (Extended Version)\" – 6:15\n*\"Roll Right Up\" – 4:48\n*\"Don’t Want To Fight Anymore\" – 4:32\n*US release\n;7\"\n*\"All I Want\" – 4:38\n*\"Dig This Well Deep\" – 4:34\n;12\"\n*\"All I Want (Extended Version)\" – 6:23\n*\"You Know I Love You...
