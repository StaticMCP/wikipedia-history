It was recorded in New York City during January 1966, and was released later that year by ESP-Disk. On the album, Howard is joined by trumpeter Ric Colbeck, bassist Scotty Holt, and percussionist Dave Grant.\nReception\n| rev2 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev3Score =\n}}\nIn a review for AllMusic, Michael G. Nastos called the album a \"pivotal recording in the development of early avant garde jazz,\" and wrote: \"Howard proves himself as an innovator who boldly goes where Ornette Coleman, Marion Brown, or Frank Wright did not fear to tread. His alto saxophone sound and ideas clearly mirror Coleman, reaching for upper atmospheric, warp signatures, and also playing warm lyrical phrases... This is... a stark reminder of how he was in on the ground floor of this progressive movement.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings stated that Howard's sound at this point in his career was \"different and idiosyncratic, but not yet fully realized,\" but praised the gentle \"And About Love\".\nThe Guardian's John Fordham noted that the album \"was explicitly connected to the Coltrane/Coleman lineage, but also exhibited the mixture of Ayler's anguished soulfulness and an unexpectedly tender folksiness that would be Howard's signature sound.\"\nA writer for Stereogum described the album as \"a major statement, an oft-overlooked gem in the ESP-Disk catalog,\" and commented: \"His music... has a compelling energy that never erupts into the kind of screaming frenzy that was rapidly becoming the cliché of free jazz. Instead, it makes a far subtler statement.\"\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Noah Howard.\n# \"Henry's Street\" – 7:20\n# \"Apotheosis\" – 6:51\n# \"Apotheosis Extension I\" – 8:17\n# \"And About Love\" – 7:07\nPersonnel\n* Noah Howard – alto saxophone\n* Ric Colbeck – trumpet\n* Scotty Holt – bass\n* Dave Grant – percussion\nReferences"
