When her sister Elizabeth married Edward IV of England, the King elevated and promoted many members of the Woodville family. Elizabeth Woodville's household records for 1466/67 indicate that Katherine was being raised in the queen's household.\nFirst marriage\nSometime before the coronation of Elizabeth in May 1465, Katherine was married to Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham; both were still children. A contemporary description of Elizabeth Woodville's coronation relates that Katherine and her husband were carried on squires' shoulders due to their youth. According to Dominic Mancini, Buckingham resented his marriage to a woman of inferior birth; though Katherine's sister Elizabeth had married the King of England. However, the couple had four children:\n* Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (3 February 1478 – 17 May 1521)\n* Elizabeth Stafford, Countess of Sussex ( – 11 May 1532)\n* Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire ( – 6 April 1523)\n* Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon ( – 1544)\nIn 1483, Buckingham first allied himself to the Duke of Gloucester, helping him succeed to the throne as King Richard III, and then to Henry Tudor, leading an unsuccessful rebellion in his name. Buckingham was executed for treason on 2 November 1483.\nSecond marriage\nAfter Richard III was defeated by Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, Katherine married the new king's uncle Jasper Tudor on 7 November 1485 who was about 25 years older than her.\nThird marriage\nAfter Jasper's death on 21 December 1495 at Thornbury Castle where they were living, Katherine married – not later than 24 February 1496 – Sir Richard Wingfield, who was twelve years younger than Katherine and who outlived her. After Katherine's first two marriages having been arranged, it's thought her final marriage was one for love, especially as it took place about eight weeks after the death of her second husband. Her third marriage took place without licence and the couple were fined £20. It is thought her elder son, Edward Stafford, paid his mother's fine.\nDepiction in fiction\nKatherine is the main protagonist in Susan Higginbotham's 2010 historical novel The Stolen Crown. She is briefly mentioned in Philippa Gregory's historical novels The White Queen (2009), The Red Queen (2010), and The White Princess (2013).\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* (chart 806)\n*\n*\n*\n*"
