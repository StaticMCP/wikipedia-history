It was first published in hardcover and trade paperback by Harcourt Brace in April 1994. The book has also been translated into Polish.\nSummary\nThe book collects pieces that won or were nominated for the Nebula Awards for novella, novelette and short story for the year 1993, various nonfiction pieces related to the awards, and tributes to recently deceased author Fritz Leiber, together with one of the two Rhysling Award-winning poems for 1992 and an introduction by the editor.

So should everyone who wants to keep up with the field.\" After briefly listing the fiction and verse content, he notes that Lowe and Clute in their overviews of the year's genre films and novels in the genre \"[b]oth seem impatient for SF to get about the task of reinventing itself. He also notes the three memorials to Fritz Leiber and Pohl's \"glimpse of fandom's early days,\" excerpted from his 1979 autobiography The Way the Future Was.\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Russell Letson in Locus no. 401, June 1994, Don D'Ammassa in Science Fiction Chronicle no. 175, August 1994, and no. 177, October 1994, and Kevin G. Helfenbein in The New York Review of Science Fiction, September 1994.\nAwards\nThe book placed eleventh in the 1995 Locus Poll Award for Best Anthology.\nNotes"
