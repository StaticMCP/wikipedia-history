He graduated from Cass Technical High School.\nCareer\nAfter graduating from Cass Tech, Davis opened a car wash but would eventually find success in sales at a local Dodge dealership.   In 1938, he opened a used car lot and two years later became a Studebaker dealer.   Studebaker Corporation faced financial difficulties in the 1950s which led to Davis closing his dealership in 1956.  In 1963, he opened a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership which he ran until 1971.\nFollowing his retirement from the car business, Davis accepted an appointment as general manager of the Detroit mass transit system from mayor Roman Gribbs.  During this time he also wrote his autobiography, ''One Man's Way'', which was published in 1979.\nIn 1996, Davis became the first black inductee in the Automotive Hall of Fame.\nReferences"
