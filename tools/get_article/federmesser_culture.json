      "text": "# Federmesser culture\n\n'Federmesser group' is an archaeological umbrella term\nincluding the late Upper Paleolithic to Mesolithic cultures of the  Northern European Plain, dating to between 14,000  and 12,800 years ago (the late Magdalenian). It is closely related to the Tjongerian culture, as both have been suggested.\nIt includes the Tjongerian sites at Lochtenrek in the Frisian part of the Netherland, spanning the area of  Belgium, the Netherlands, northern France, northern Germany, southern Denmark, and Poland (Tarnowian and Witowian cultures). It is also closely related to the Creswellian culture to the west and the Azilian to the south. The name is derived from the characteristic small backed flint blades, in German termed  Federmesser (\"quill knife\"). It is succeeded by the Ahrensburg culture after 12,800 BP.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Federmesser Culture\n\n#REDIRECT Federmesser culture\n}}"
