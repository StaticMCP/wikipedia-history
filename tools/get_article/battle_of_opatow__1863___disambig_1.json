A party of 210 Polish rebels, commanded by Józef Hauke-Bosak, managed to temporarily capture the town, which was defended by a 180-strong garrison of the Imperial Russian Army.\nPolish rebels took advantage of the fact that main Russian forces had left Opatów, to chase rebel units operating near the town of Ilza. Hauke-Bossak ordered an attack from three sides. Weak Russian garrison was unable to defend the town, and was pushed out of Opatów. Poles captured the town and withdrew with seized Russian guns and ammunition towards Suchedniów.\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe. Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1983. ."
