In 1764, a survey of possible water routes across the Delmarva Peninsula was made, but little action followed. The idea was raised again in 1788 by regional business leaders, including famed Philadelphians Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush.\nDespite the beginnings of a commercial venture in 1802 coincident with Canal Mania in England and Wales, it was not until 1829 until the C&D Canal Company could, at last, announce the waterway \"open for business\". Its construction cost of $3.5 million (equivalent to $&nbsp;million in ) made it one of the most expensive canal projects of its time.\nIn the present era, the C&D Canal is owned and operated by the U.S.&nbsp;Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The project office in Chesapeake City, Maryland, is also the site of the C&D&nbsp;Canal Museum and Bethel Bridge Lighthouse. The canal saves approximately 300 miles on the route between Wilmington or Philadelphia on the Delaware River and Baltimore on Chesapeake Bay, avoiding a course around the Delmarva Peninsula.\nThe canal is a landmark and cultural boundary for the state of Delaware, considered a divide between the urbanized northern portion of the state and the rural southern portion, known locally as \"Lower Delaware\", and demarcates an unofficial northern limit to the Delmarva Peninsula.\nEarly years\nIn the mid‑17th century, Augustine Herman, a mapmaker and Prague native who had served as an envoy for the Dutch, observed that two great bodies of water, the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay, were separated only by a narrow strip of land. Herman proposed that a waterway be built to connect the two.\nMore than a century passed before any action was taken. In 1764, a survey of possible water routes across the Delmarva Peninsula was made.  One was proposed by Thomas Gilpin,&nbsp;Sr., a Quaker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who, along with other members of the American Philosophical Society, sought a waterway to shorten the shipping distance from the Chesapeake Bay to Philadelphia.  He proposed a canal across the Delmarva Peninsula to connect the Chester River at present-day Millington, Maryland, to the Delaware River. He even bought  of land, largely in and around Millington, but the canal would not become a reality for decades.\nThe idea was raised again in 1788 by regional business leaders, including noted Philadelphians Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush. The canal would reduce, by nearly 300&nbsp;miles (500&nbsp;km), the water routes between Philadelphia and Baltimore.\nIn 1802, following actions by the legislatures of Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company was incorporated, with merchant and banker Joseph Tatnall as president. More surveys followed, and in 1804, construction of the canal began under Benjamin Latrobe. The work included 14&nbsp;locks to connect the Christina River in Delaware with the Elk River at Welch Point, Maryland, but the project was halted two years later for lack of funds.\nConstruction\nThe canal company was reorganized in 1822, and new surveys determined that more than $2 million in capital was needed to resume construction. Eventually, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased $100,000 in stock, the State of Maryland, $50,000; and Delaware, $25,000. The federal government invested $450,000, with the remainder subscribed by the public.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers played a vital yet unofficial role for the canal company in 1823 and 1824, providing two senior officers to help determine a canal route. The engineer officers and two civilian engineers recommended a new route with four locks, extending from Newbold's Landing Harbor (now Delaware City), westward to the Back Creek branch of the Elk River in Maryland.\nCanal construction resumed in April 1824, and within several years some 2,600&nbsp;men were digging and hauling dirt from the ditch. Laborers toiled with pick and shovel at the immense construction task, working for an average daily wage of 75&nbsp;cents. The swampy marshlands along the canal's planned route proved a great impediment to progress; workers continuously battled slides along the \"ditch's\" soft slopes. It was 1829 before the C&D&nbsp;Canal Company could, at last, announce the waterway \"open for business\". Its construction cost of $3.5&nbsp;million made it one of the most expensive canal projects of its time.\nIn 1825, due to the efforts of Benjamin Wright, the company fired the canal's chief engineer, John Randel Jr.,  who had surveyed its route and built the difficult eastern section. Randel sued the company for breach of contract, and in 1834 a jury returned an award to Randel of $226,885.84 (), a tremendous amount for the time.  The canal company's appeals went as high as the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed the award. The company attempted to avoid paying the judgment, but the state legislatures of both Maryland and Delaware passed bills requiring the canal company to pay off its debts within five years.  The huge award almost bankrupted the company.\n1829 to 1919\n| built       =\n| added       = April 21, 1975\n| refnum      = 75000543\n}}\nThe Chesapeake Bay and Delaware River were now connected by a navigation channel measuring nearly  long,  deep,  wide at the waterline and  wide along the channel bottom. A covered wooden bridge at Summit, Delaware, spanned the canal across the \"Deep Cut\", measuring  between abutments. The bridge floor was  above the channel bottom. Three wooden swing bridges also crossed the canal. Locks to pass vessels through the waterway's various levels were constructed at Delaware City, Delaware and St.&nbsp;Georges, Delaware, and two at Chesapeake City. Each measured  long and  wide and was eventually enlarged to  in length and  in width.\nTeams of mules and horses towed freight and passenger barges, schooners and sloops through the canal. Cargoes included practically every useful item of daily life: lumber, grain, farm products, fish, cotton, coal, iron, and whiskey. Packet ships were eventually established to move freight through the waterway. The Ericsson Line operated between Baltimore and Philadelphia, and continued to carry passengers and freight through the canal into the 1940s. The cargo tonnage peaked in 1872 with more than 1.3&nbsp;million tons transiting the canal.\nAlong the route across the top of the Delmarva Peninsula, at least six lighthouses warned barges and other vessels passing through the canal when they were approaching bridges and locks.  These small wooden lighthouses had had red lanterns mounted atop them.\nThe Ericsson Line of steamboats originated as steamers built for freight only; however, the line converted to passenger boats during 1876 at the time of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia as the demand for travel increased. The Baltimore and Philadelphia Steamship Companies, which operated the Ericsson line, built and furnished ships with seventy to eighty staterooms in addition to the freight facilities. In turn, these ships grew from less than one hundred to more than six hundred tons and greatly increased travel from Baltimore to Philadelphia. The Ericsson Line was named after its first ship, Ericsson, which was named after John Ericsson who developed the screw propeller that was installed on the vessel specifically designed for the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal. Ericsson was built at Reanie & Neafie's shipyard in Philadelphia by Anthony Groves,&nbsp;Jr. The ship, finished in 1843, was  in length and weighed eighty tons. It began operations in 1844 under the direction of Captain Noah F. Ireland. The Ericsson Line operated out of Baltimore's No.&nbsp;1 Light Street Pier for 75&nbsp;years, serving passenger and freight demands throughout the waterway with thirty registered steamers. The Ericsson Line's success brought utility and prosperity to the canal and promoted an expansion of trade by means of its growth and connection to the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal.\nLoss of water in the locks was a problem from early on. As boats passed through at Chesapeake City, the equivalent of a full lock of water was lost to the lower-lying portion of the canal. This loss, compounded by leakage through the canal banks and normal evaporation, made it necessary to devise a means of lifting water into the project's upper part.\nA steam operated pump was purchased in 1837 to raise water from Back Creek, and in 1852 a steam engine and large waterwheel were installed at the pumphouse in Chesapeake City. Measuring  in diameter and  wide, the iron and wood waterwheel had 12 troughs which filled with water as it turned; the water then spilled over the hub into the raceway and into the uppermost canal level. By 1854 a second steam engine was in use. The two  engines consumed eight tons of coal daily while lifting 170&nbsp;tons of water per minute into the canal. The waterwheel and steam engines remained in continuous use through the mid‑1920s.\nThroughout the 19th&nbsp;century, the canal's use continued to change with the New Castle and Frenchtown Turnpike and Rail Road being its only major competitor. Steam power brought larger and deeper-draft vessels that could not pass through the restricting locks. By the turn of the 20th&nbsp;century the decline in canal traffic and cost of operation and repairs reduced canal profits. Clearly a larger, wider, and deeper waterway was needed.\nAt the time, however, little thought was given to improving the existing canal. New companies were formed instead, considering at least six new canal routes, but committees and commissions appointed to study the issue failed to agree on a plan. In 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt appointed a new commission to report on the feasibility of converting the canal to a \"free and open waterway.\"\n1920s to 1970s\nIn 1919 the federal government bought the canal for $2.5&nbsp;million and designated it the \"Intra-coastal Waterway Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, Delaware and Maryland.\" The purchase included six bridges and a railroad span owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. These were replaced during the 1920s by four vertical lift spans and a new railroad bridge.\nResponsibility for operating, maintaining, and improving the waterway was assigned to the U.S.&nbsp;Army Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District. In the mid-1920s, work began to move the eastern entrance at Delaware City several miles south to Reedy Point, Delaware. All locks (except the one at Delaware City) were removed, and the waterway was converted to a sea-level operation at  deep and  wide. These improvements cost $10&nbsp;million. Two stone jetties at the new eastern entrance were completed in 1926. The sole remaining lock at Delaware City &mdash; a stone structure, resting on wooden underpinnings, with a wooden floor &mdash; would eventually be preserved and, in 1975, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe \"new\" canal opened in May 1927 with great celebration, even as plans were underway for further expansion to accommodate ever larger ships. The Philadelphia District assumed operation of the canal in 1933. Between 1935 and 1938, the channel was again improved, deepened to  and widened to  at a cost of nearly $13&nbsp;million. The project was also expanded to include a federal navigation channel  deep and  wide for some  in the Upper Chesapeake Bay, from the Elk River to Pooles Island.\nThrough the years, as the sizes and tonnages of ships using the canal continued to grow, accidents and one‑way traffic restrictions strained the canal's capacity. Between 1938 and 1950 alone, eight ships collided with bridges. In 1954, the United States Congress authorized further expansion of the channel to  wide and  deep. These improvements, begun in the 1960s, were completed in the mid‑1970s.\nNew bridges to accommodate highway traffic crossing the canal also became necessary as deepening and widening progressed. Two mechanical lift bridges at St.&nbsp;Georges and Chesapeake City were toppled by ship collisions and replaced in the 1940s with high-level highway spans (the former, the St.&nbsp;Georges Bridge, has largely been bypassed by the new Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge, opened in 1995). Two other high-level vehicular traffic bridges, Summit Bridge in 1960 and Reedy Point Bridge in 1968, were constructed as part of the 1954 improvement authorization.\nIn 1966, a new railroad lift bridge (the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Lift Bridge) was also completed by the Corps and turned over to the Pennsylvania Railroad to carry freight across the canal. The railroad and Summit spans were recognized by the American Institute of Steel Construction as the most beautiful bridges of their types in the years they were completed.\nAfter the modern sea-level canal opened in 1927, pilot boats operated by the Army Corps of Engineers worked at each end of the waterway, one assigned to Reedy Point on the Delaware River and the other stationed at Town Point on the Elk River in Maryland.  These patrol boats met incoming ships, checked traffic, did patrols, and sometimes made rescues.  But modernization had arrived on Canal as closed circuit televisions, radar, and advanced in radio communications made the work of meeting incoming boats and other tasks obsolete.  On Nov. 19, 1968, the work of the patrol boats was retired, and modern, centralized technology took over the tasks.\nPost-1970s\nToday's canal is a modern sea-level, electronically controlled commercial waterway, serving as the northern maritime gateway to the Port of Baltimore.\nSince 1933 the Corps' Philadelphia District has managed canal and highway bridge operations from a two-story white frame building on the canal's southern bank at Chesapeake City, Maryland. Cargo ships, tankers, container-carrying vessels (all up to Seawaymax-classification), barges accompanied by tugboats, and countless recreational boats create a steady flow of traffic. Through state-of-the-art fiber optic and microwave links, dispatchers use closed-circuit television and radio systems to monitor and safely move commercial traffic through the waterway.\nNavigating oceangoing vessels requires extensive maritime skills, with strong currents or bad weather conditions adding to the risks. A United States Coast Guard certified pilot is required for vessels engaged in foreign trade transiting the canal, the Delaware River and Bay, and Chesapeake Bay. Many shipping firms use pilots from the Delaware River and Bay or Maryland pilots' associations.\nTypically a Delaware River and Bay pilot boards a ship as it passes Lewes, Delaware, entering the Delaware Bay, and guides the vessel up the bay and into the canal to Chesapeake City. A Maryland pilot then takes over and continues the ship's transit into the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore or Annapolis, Maryland. The procedure is reversed for eastbound ships. At Chesapeake City a \"changing of the pilots\" takes place, while the pilot launch maneuvers alongside a vessel as it continues its journey without stopping. The pilots use the ship's gangway, pilot ladder, or port entrance to climb aboard or leave the vessel.\nC&D Canal Museum\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates the C&D Canal Museum at Chesapeake City, Maryland, housed in the original canal pumphouse with a waterwheel and pumping engines. The museum illustrates the canal's history and operations.  Current operations can be viewed through a television monitor affording visitors up-to-the minute locations on ships traveling through the canal.  Admission is free, and the museum is open Monday-Friday year round except for government holidays.\nA full-sized replica of the  Bethel Bridge Lighthouse is located on Corps property, a short walk from the museum. The original lighthouse was used to warn vessels of locks and bridges in the days before the 1927 canal changes made it sea level.\nCrossings\nThe following are crossings of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal north to south and vice versa:\n{| class=wikitable\n!
