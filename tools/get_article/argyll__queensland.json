In the , Argyll had a population of 25 people.\nGeography\nThe Clermont Rubyvale Road enters the locality from the north-east (Theresa Creek) and exits to the south-east (Rubyvale).\nTomahawk Creek rises in Peak Vale to the south-west which follows into the south-west of the locality and then north through the locality, exiting to the north (the locality of Theresa Creek).\nArgyll has a number of  mountains (from north to south):\n* Mount Observatory ()\n* Bald Hills ()\n* Chinaman Peak ()\n* Double Point ()\n* Black Mountain ()\n* Mount Mica ()\n* Pigeon Peak ()\n* Mount Dumb Bell ()\n* Mount Zig Zag ()\n* Mount Ball ()\n* Mount Newsome ()\n* Mount Hoy ()\n* Mount Point ()\n* Mount Tabletop ()\nThe land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nOn 17 May 2019, the Queensland Government decided to discontinue the locality of Mistake Creek and absorb its land into the neighbouring localities of Clermont, Laglan, Frankfield and Peak Vale and to extend Peak Vale into the Central Highlands Region by altering the boundaries of Argyll.\nOn 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government re-drew the boundaries of localities within the Central Highlands Region by replacing the locality of The Gemfields with three new localities of Rubyvale, Sapphire Central and Anakie Siding (around the towns of Rubyvale, Sapphire, and Anakie respectively). This included adjusting the boundaries of other existing localities in the Region to accommodate these changes; Argyll lost its south-eastern corner to become the northern part of the new Rubyvale and the north-eastern part of the new Sapphire Central.\nDemographics\nAt the , Argyll had a population of 31 people.\nAt the , Argyll had a population of 25 people.\nHeritage listings\nTomahawk Creek Huts is a heritage-listed site in Argyll ().\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Argyll. The nearest government primary schools are Clermont State School in Clermont and Anakie State School in Anakie Siding to the south. The nearest government secondary schools are Clermont State High School in Clermont and Capella State High School in Capella to the north-east. However, students in some parts of Argyll would be too distant to attend these schools; the alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences\nExternal links"
