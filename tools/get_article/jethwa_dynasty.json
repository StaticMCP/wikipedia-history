It was a Rajput dynasty ruled by Jethwa clan of Rajputs.\nOrigin\nmentions Jaitwa, Jethwa also as Camari]]\nJethwa (or Jethva, Jatava, Jaitwa or Camari,.\nThe Jethwa claim their descent from Makardhwaja, son of Hanuman. As per folk tales of their clan, Makardhwaja had a son named Mod-dhwaja and he had a son named Jethi-dhwaja. Jethwas claim descent and name from Jethi-dhwaja and worship Hanuman as their Iṣṭa-devatā.\nadopted by Jethwa rulers of the Kingdom, showing image of Hanuman, from whom the Jethwas claim their descant.]]\nJethwa dynasty of Porbandar, therefore, had image of Hanuman on the Merchant Navy Flag adapted in 1923. Also the Coat of Arms had the image of Hanuman in the centre.\nFurther, it is said that Muslim governors of Sindh in 7th century repeatedly sent naval armed ships to conquer the western and southern coast of Gujarat, which were again and again repulsed by the \"Saindhavas\" who called themselves \"masters of the Western sea\" Apara Samudradhipati (apara-samudr-ddhipati) . It has been suggested that the Saindhava ruling family also known as  Jayadrathas is now represented by the Jethwa Rajputs.\nCaptain Wilberforce Bell opines that their ancestors were probably Scythians from the north . However, Gaurishankar Ojha opines Jethwas were probably a branch of Pratihars of Kannauj.\nFurther, many historians are of a view that Jethwa Rajputs have deep association with Mer people since time immemorial, who are only the Senior (Jethwa) or rajakula (royal clan) of the Mers. The Mer have always been confidential and supported Jethwas in times of war and peace. It was the custom that when a Rana of Porbandar ascended the throne or Gaddi, the leader of the Mer people would cut the tip of his little finger and make a tilak with his blood on the forehead of the Rana.\nHistory\nGhumali, which was earlier capital of Saindhvas has been Jethwa's bastion and capital since the time dynasty was founded in early 7th Century around 620 by Shil Kumar Jethwa, who later helped Angagapala ruler of Delhi win a war. In return of the help Anagapal married her daughter with him. The area ruled by Jethwa's was traditionally today known as Barda Hills was historically known as  Jyeshthukadesh, meaning land of Jethwa's.  The other towns founded by them are where they shifted their capital temporarily after dislodged from  Morvi in 900&nbsp;AD, were with times shifting to Shrinagar, Dhank, Chhaya, Ghumli, Ranapur and lastly to Porbandar (from 1685 till 1947). They were the first rulers of the Saurashtra area of Western Gujarat.\nJethwas seem to have entered from North West, that is, Sindh and Kutch to Saurashtra in the 9th century AD and are oldest ruling clan of Peninsula. It is accepted by almost all historians that Jethwas established their rule in Saurashtra in around 900&nbsp;AD and founded the city of Morvi as their Capital. Morvi was earlier known by name of Mayurpuri, named after its founder the Jethwa ruler Mayur-dhwaja. They spread further westward and captured Dwarka from Chawdas moved further and established the towns of Nagnah, Ghumli, Bhanvad, Chhaya, Dhank, Laodhva, Ranpur with colonies at Miani and Shrinagar on the coast. During the time of Mahmud of Ghazni, the Jethwas controlled all the west and north of the Kathiawar.\nColonial ethnographer James Tod in his 1832 The annals and antiquities of Rajastʾhan:or the central and western Rajpoot states of India includes Jethwa among the 36 royal races of ancient India and also names Jethwa or Jatava as Camari. Further, Colon James Todd opines that Jethwas come from old marital races of Indian Peninsula and were called Kanwar till the 8th century. Some Jethwa rulers suffixed Kanwar after their name and hence were also known as Kanwars or Kumars.\nSangaji was a Jethwa ruler from 1120 to 1150, who defeated the army of Virdhaval Vaghela, (the founder of Vaghela dynasty) near Morvi in 1125. Virdhaval, defeated, married his daughter and surrendered his title of Rana to Sangaji Jethwa. The title of Rana has been held by Jethwas rulers ever-since till last Rana died in 1979 without an heir.\nJethwas lost Morvi, when they were defeated by invading army of Qutb-ud-din Aibak in year 1193. Jethwas shifted to Nagnah and they later established their rule and founded Ghumli, under Sal Kumar. The rulers of Ghumli were also called Kumarants.\nIn later years Vajesinh Jethwa alias Wajosinh, who ruled from years 1220–1245, was a brave warrior, who was truly known as Sinh and held considerable influence on Vishaldeo Vaghela.\nGhumli was declared as second Capital by Jethwa dynasty, in 1220 by Rana Shiyaji, who took the title of Rana of Ghumli and shifted capital from Shrinagar Ghumli remained their Capital till 1313, when Rana Bhanji Jethwa, was defeated at a war, he fled Ghumli & shifted to Ranpur. It is said that Ghumli was destroyed due to curse of a Sati named Sone with whom Rana Bhanji Jethwa fell in love. Jadeja Jam Unaji (Jam Unad) of Jadeja clan came from Sindh and attacked Ghumli in 1309 but was defeated later in 1313 his son Jam Barmaniyaji Jadeja (Jam Bamanioji) attacked to avenge the defeat. He defeated Rana Bhanji Jethwa, who fled and Ghumli was completely destroyed and turned it into ruins. On the same night Goddess Ambaji came in dream of Bamanioji and told him that, as she has granted the wish (\"Asha\") of his father to conquer Ghumli, he should make a temple in her name. So Barmaniyaji built the Temple of Ambaji on the hill in the middle of Ghumli and named it as Ashapura Mata Temple, who is Kuldevi of Jedejas.\nIn around 1525–35 Jam Raval conquered greater part of Halar from Jethwas and other Rajput rulers like Chawdas, Dedas (A sub-branch of Jadejas) and Vadhels. This led to further decimating the Jethwa territories in which Nagnah was lost, which Jams renamed as Nawanagar. Jam Ravalji's son, however, gave his daughter to Jethwa ruler Khimooji. But in later years, Jam Ravaljis's son Jam Sataji killed his own nephew Jethwa Ramdevji IV by a conspiracy and annexed further territory of Jethwas by force. This led to a fierce enmity between Jethwa and Jams, which continued for 300 years and there was apiya between them. During this turbulent times in history of Jethwa dynasty, the Mers again came in help of in protection of Jethwas and helped them recover their lost territories. After the defeat at hands of Jams in 1525 the ruling Jethwa had to run from here to there till they found shelter at Chhaya. Later, the late Rana Bhanji's widow Rani Kalabai, a lady of out-standing courage and foresight raised an army of the Mers and Rabaris and regained her lost territory as far as Ranpur from Jams.\nLater in 1671 Rana Vikmatji Khimoji Jethwa  took possession of Porbandar from Mughals and built a fort there. He also took fort of Madhavpur. Though, he died at Porbandar, the capital remained Chhaya. It was his son Rana Saratanji II, who permanently shifted the Capital to Porbandar in 1685. The Jethwas of Porbandar entered into alliance with British in 1807 and agreement was entered into year 1809 with East India Company.\nThe princely state of Porbandar was a 13-Gun Salute State of British India. The reigns of Rana Bhavsinhji Madhavsinhji (1900–1908) and Rana Natwarsinhji (1908–1979) both Maharaja of Porbandar gave the state of Porbandar first class status after many battles for the throne within the royal family in 1811, 1869 and 1886. The Porbandar remained the Capital of Jethwa dynasty till the State of Porbandar was merged into Union of India, when the last ruler of the kingdom, Rana Natwarsinhji Bhavsinhji signed the Instrument of Accession on 15 August 1947.\nThe last Rana and ruler of Jethwa dynasty of Porbandar, Shri Natwarsinhji died in 1979. Before him in 1977, the successor to his throne the crown-prince Udaybhansinhji Natwarsinhji Jethwa died, leaving the throne  vacant.\nThe grandfather of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Uttamchand Gandhi and later his father – Karamchand Gandhi and uncle – Tulsidas Gandhi, served as Dewan to Rana of Porbandar.\nJethwa inscriptions\nVisavada inscription\nThe inscription dated VS 1262 (1206 CE) was found in a niche of Siddhanatha Mahadeva Temple in Visavada near Porbandar. Written by Nagar Brahmin named Vaijaka and engraved by mason Jhalhana, it says about installation of a statue of Vikramaditya in the reign of Rana Simha. This Rana Simha probably belonged to Jethwa family as according to the bards the region was held by the Jethwas during that period.\nArchitectural heritage\n.]]\n*Navlakha Temple at Ghumli built by Jethwa rulers in 12th century dedicated to Sun god is oldest sun temple of Gujarat.
