The series was inspired by the Final Fantasy series and contain many pop-culture references. Originally developed as a browser game using Adobe Flash, the games have since been ported to desktop platforms, and later, mobile platforms. In 2022, Epic Battle Fantasy 5 marks the first game in the series to be released on iOS and Android.\nCharacters\nThere are five playable main characters in Epic Battle Fantasy.\n* Matt - the warrior sword of the team, present since the first game.\n* Natalie - the red mage of the team and has been present since the first game. She is the most responsible member of the team, and a frequent source of \"fan service\".\n* Lance - a human soldier that has appeared in each game since Epic Battle Fantasy 2. While he initially serves as the villain, a fascist attempting to conquer the world, in Epic Battle Fantasy 2, he joins the party in all games afterwards. He appears as a regular character in 3 and 4, before becoming a villain and fascist once more in 5 and again rejoining the party.\n* Anna - a ranger from Greenwood Village. Though she debuts in the side game called Bullet Heaven, her first appearance in a main series game occurs in Epic Battle Fantasy 4, in which she seeks out Matt, Natalie, and Lance, the prime suspects in the theft of the village's sacred jewel, and leads them into battle with the world's creator, Godcat.\n* NoLegs - a blue limbless cat that accompanies the party. He fights with a sword and shield, though like the other characters, he can wield other weapons and random objects in a similar manner.
