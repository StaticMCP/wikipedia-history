The origins of Warrington are as a mediaeval market town and crossing point of the River Mersey, it grew rapidly during Industrial Revolution on the back of industries such as brewing, tanning and especially wire manufacturing. Further expansion followed the Second World War when it was selected as a New Town. The population is now over 200,000. Since 1971 several Conservation Areas have been designated in Warrington in recognition of their special architectural and historical interest.\nConservation areas\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
