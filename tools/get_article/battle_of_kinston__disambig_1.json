Gen. John G. Foster left New Bern in December to disrupt the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad at Goldsborough. The advance was stubbornly contested by Brig. Gen. Nathan Evans's brigade near Kinston Bridge on December 14, but the Confederates were outnumbered and withdrew north of the Neuse River in the direction of Goldsborough. Foster continued his movement the next day, taking the River Road, south of the Neuse River.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ncpedia.org/kinston-battle Battle of Kinston] NCpedia\n* [http://www.historicalpreservationgroup.org/wil_park.htm Kinston Battlefield Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108204744/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/NorthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles/Albemarle%20Sound%20to%20Kinston.pdf CWSAC Report Update]\nGallery\nKinston_Battlefield_North_Carolina.jpg|Map of Kinston Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program.\nKinston_Battlefield.JPG|Kinston Battlefield Park\nKinston Swamp.jpg|Drawing of Kinston Swamp by a member of the 45th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry"
