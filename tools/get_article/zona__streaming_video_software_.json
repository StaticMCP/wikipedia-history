Described as a \"Popcorn Time beater\", the application provides a free alternative to subscription-based video streaming services (such as Netflix). In addition to on-demand movies and television series, Zona offers streaming music, live television channels, news, live sports, and games. Zona has been criticized for being closed-source as well as having an installer that has been implicated as malware.\nSee also\n* Popcorn Time\n* Porn Time\n* Comparison of BitTorrent clients\nReferences"
