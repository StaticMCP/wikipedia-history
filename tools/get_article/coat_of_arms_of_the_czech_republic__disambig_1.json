Greater coat of arms displays the three historical regions—the Czech lands—which make up the nation. Lesser coat of arms displays lone silver double-tailed lion in red shield. The current coats of arms, which was adopted in 1992, was designed by Czech heraldist Jiří Louda.\nBackground\nFile:Small coat of arms of the Czech Republic.svg|Bohemia and whole Czech lands\nFile:Znak Moravy.svg|Moravia\nFile:Znak Slezska.svg|Silesia\nThe arms of Bohemia show a silver double-tailed lion on a red background. This Bohemian Lion makes up the first and the fourth quarters of the greater coat of arms, so it is repeated in the shield. The Moravian red-and-silver chequered eagle is shown on a blue background. Between 1915 and 1918 the Moravian Eagle was chequered in the red-and-gold colors. The arms of Silesia is a black eagle with the clover stalk (lat. perisonium) in its breast on a golden background, although only a small south-eastern part of the historical region (Czech Silesia) belongs to the Czech Republic (the main part is now in Poland).\nThe rulers of Bohemia originally identified with a St. Wenceslas flaming eagle. In the 12th century, Emperor Frederick granted new arms to King Vladislaus II consisting of a silver lion on a red field, to symbolise his valor. The lion was at first represented with one tail. Later a second tail was added, for the help provided by the King Přemysl Otakar I fighting the Saxons (A legend from Dalimil's chronicle). During the first half of the 13th century the kings of Bohemia used a coat of arms bearing a black eagle in a silver shield. Red gonfanons had appeared earlier. From 1253 a two-tailed silver lion in a red field had been the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia. This lion was originally a sign of the Moravian margraves.\nThe oldest surviving full color depiction of the arms of Bohemia appears in the Passional of Abbes Cunegund from the 1310s. The Moravian Eagle was first documented on the seal of Ottokar's uncle, Margrave Přemysl (d. 1239). The Silesian Eagle stems from the ruling dynasty of the Piasts and was first applied by Duke Henry II the Pious (1238–1241). The shields also appeared on the emblems of the Crown of Bohemia established by Emperor Charles IV.\nThe greater shield was also used as the badge for the Czech national ice hockey team until 2018. The Czech national football team also featured it in their shirts, until being replaced with a newer, more streamlined badge featuring only the Bohemian lion, since the UEFA Euro 2012.\nVariants\nGreater version\nThe greater coat of arms is blazoned in Czech law as follows:\nA shield quartered: first and fourth gules, a lion rampant queue forchée argent armed, langued and crowned Or; second azure, an eagle displayed chequé gules and argent armed, langued and crowned Or; third Or, an eagle displayed sable armed and langued gules crowned of the field and charged on the breast with a crescent terminating in trefoils at each end with issuing from the centrepoint a cross patée argent.\nLesser version\nThe lesser coat of arms is blazoned in Czech law:\nThe lesser national coat of arms is a red shield, in it a silver double-tailed lion rampant with golden crown and golden armament.\nHistory\nCzech lands\nPlamenna orlice kunhuta.jpg|Přemyslid dynasty (Duchy of Bohemia)Right: The earliest known colored coat of arms of Přemyslids depicted in the Passional of Abbes Kunigunde (1310s)\nNejstarší dochované barevné vyobrazení znaku Čech, hrad Gozzoburg v Kremži.jpeg|Kingdom of Bohemia (Royal Arms of Bohemia)Right: The oldest depiction of coat of arms of Bohemia, castle Gozzoburg in Krems, fresco painting from the beginning of 1270s\nNejstarší dochované barevné vyobrazení znaku markraběcí Moravy, hrad Gozzoburg v Kremži.jpeg|Right: The oldest depiction of coat of arms of Moravia, castle Gozzoburg in Krems, fresco painting from the beginning of 1270s\nLev erb kunhuta.jpg|Lesser Royal Arms of BohemiaRight: Colored coat of arms of Bohemia depicted in the Passional of Abbes Kunigunde (1310s)\nWappen Königreich Böhmen.jpg|Royal Arms of Bohemia by Austrian heraldist Hugo Gerard Ströhl (1851–1919)\nKing-of-Bohemia.jpg|Kingdom of Bohemia(Royal Arms of Bohemia)\nPřemyslovci erb.svg|\nCoat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia (Wenceslaus II of Bohemia).svg|\nCoat of arms of the Margraviate of Moravia (Wenceslaus II).svg|\nLesser coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia (Wenceslaus II of Bohemia).svg|\nCoat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia.svg|\nMoravská orlice s klenotem.jpg|later form\nBohemian Crown lands\nSilesia_arms_Blaeu.png|Duchies of Silesia\nCoat of arms of Bohemian Crown.svg|Lands of the Bohemian Crown(simplified)\nCoat of arms of the House of Luxembourg-Bohemia.svg|Lesser Royal Arms of Bohemia\nBlason Boheme couronne.svg|Royal Arms of Bohemia with crown of Saint Wenceslas\nLands of the Bohemian Crown\nCoat of arms of the lands of the Bohemian Crown.svg |Coat of arms of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown\nZnak českého království.png |Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia\nCzechoslovakia\nLesser arms of Bohemia and Moravia (1939-1945).svg|Provisional coat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1919–1920)\nGreater coat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1918-1938 and 1945-1961).svg|Greater coat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1920–1960)\nMiddle coat of arms of Czechoslovakia.svg|Middle coat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1920–1960)\nLesser coat of arms of Czechoslovakia.svg|Lesser coat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1920–1960)\nCoat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1960–1990).svg|Czechoslovakia (1960–1990)\nHerb Czechosłowacji (1990-1992).svg|Czechoslovakia (1990–1992)\nProtectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\nGreater arms of Bohemia and Moravia (1939-1945).svg|Greater coat of arms of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939–1945)\nLesser arms of Bohemia and Moravia (1939-1945).svg|Lesser coat of arms of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939–1945)\nCzech Republic\nHerb wielki Czech (1990-1992).svg|Greater coat of arms of the Czech Republic (1990–1992)\nHerb mały Czech (1990-1992).svg|Lesser coat of arms of the Czech Republic (1990–1992)\nSee also\n* Coat of arms of Silesia\n*Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia\n*Coat of arms of Moravia\n* Armorial of sovereign states\nReferences and external links"
