By rotating the antenna one can determine the direction the signal lies in and of course whatever it may be attached to.  The EPIRB is an example of a similar device.\nIt is commonly used in model rocketry and remote control aircraft to locate lost equipment.\nSee also\n* Homing beacon\n* Emergency locator beacon\nExternal links\n*[http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/circ/tx15trak.htm 1.5 volt example transmitter]"
