It is the second single from her 1982 album Walk On'', and it was written by Randy Sharp.\nHistory\nKaren Brooks recorded \"If That's What You're Thinking\" on her 1982 album Walk On. The song features two verses, a refrain, a bridge sung in Spanish, followed by a repeat of the chorus and first verse. Erin E. Bauer, in the book ''Flaco's Legacy: The Globalization of Conjunto describes the song as being about \"fear on the part of the vocalist to express vulnerability in the face of a loving relationship.\" John Lomax III of United Feature Syndicate described the song as having a \"Spanish touch\". Brian Ahern produced the track, which was written by Randy Sharp.\nTexas Tornados covered the song on their 1990 Reprise Records album Texas Tornados''. Their rendition adds a verse not present in the original by Brooks, while also altering the words of the Spanish-language bridge. Bauer thought this rendition combined elements of country and conjunto.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"If That's What You're Thinking\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1983)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|\n|}\nReferences"
