The Treaty of Friendship and protected state status ended in 1970 under arrangements established prior to her death by the third monarch, Queen Sālote.\nWhile never directly ruled by the British, Tonga's foreign affairs were conducted through the British consul, giving the United Kingdom veto power over foreign policies and finances of the Kingdom of Tonga. An unspoken agreement of the treaty that was common in British protected states was a new monopoly on Tonga's thriving vanilla industry, and their small deposits of minerals.\nTonga was affected by the 1918 flu pandemic, with 1,800 Tongans killed, around eight per cent of the residents.\nFor most of the 20th century Tonga was quiet, inward-looking, and somewhat isolated from developments elsewhere in the world. Tonga's complex social structure is essentially broken into three tiers: the King, the nobles, and the commoners. Between the nobles and commoners are Matapule, sometimes called \"talking chiefs,\" who are associated with the King or a noble and who may or may not hold estates. Obligations and responsibilities are reciprocal, and although the nobility are able to extract favours from people living on their estates, they likewise must extend favours to their people. Status and rank play a powerful role in personal relationships, even within families.\nTonga gained independence within the Commonwealth of Nations on 4 June 1970.\nGallery\nFile:Tomb of King George Tubou I, 1900.jpg|Tomb of King George Tupou I, 1900\nFile:Tomb of King George Tubou I, 1900 (close-up).jpg|Tomb of King George Tupou I, 1900\nFile:George Tupou II going to the Opening of Tongan Parliament in 1900.jpg|King George Tupou II going to the opening of the Tongan Parliament in 1900\nFile:Richard Seddon and wife at the openinig of the Tongan parliament.jpg|Richard Seddon and his wife at the opening of the Tongan parliament, 1900\nFile:Royal Throne of Tonga, 1900.jpg| The royal throne of Tonga, 1900.\nFile:Tongawar.jpg|World War I memorial in Nukuʻalofa\nFile:Tonga-Italian Capitulation Parade.jpg|Members of the Tonga Defence Force of the 2nd NZEF on parade in Tonga celebrating the capitulation of Italy in 1945\nFile:Officials watching dancing, Kolofo'ou, 1967.jpg|Bishop John Rodgers, Pīsila (wife of Lord Fusitu'a(Tevita Tu'iniua),full name Pisila Fotofili Fusitu’a) and Suli Seuli (matāpule of Fusitu'a) watching dancing.
