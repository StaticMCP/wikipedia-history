      "text": "# BSFA Award for Best Artwork\n\nThe BSFA Awards are given every year by the British Science Fiction Association. The BSFA Award for Best Artwork is open to any artwork with speculative themes that first appeared in the previous year. Provided the artwork hasn't been published before it doesn't matter where it appears. The ceremonies are named after the year that the eligible works were published, despite the awards being given out in the next year.\nPrior to 1986 the award was presented for best artist, rather than artwork. Jim Burns won three of the seven Best Artist awards. He went on to win eleven Best Artwork awards.\nWinners\n*1979: Jim Burns\n*1980: Peter Jones\n*1981: Bruce Pennington\n*1982: Tim White\n*1983: Bruce Pennington\n*1984: Jim Burns\n*1985: Jim Burns\n*1986: Keith Roberts - cover of The Clocktower Girl\n*1987: Jim Burns - cover of Worldcon Programme Book\n*1988: Alan Lee - cover of Lavondyss by Robert Holdstock\n*1989: Jim Burns - cover of Other Edens III\n*1990: Ian Miller - covers of The Difference Engine and Interzone 40\n*1991: Mark Harrison - cover of Interzone 45\n*1992: Jim Burns - cover of Hearts, Hands and Voices\n*1993: Jim Burns - cover of Red Dust by Paul J.
