For two periods there has been no resident ambassador: from 1975 to 1979 the high commissioner to Tanzania was also non-resident ambassador to Madagascar, and from 2005 to 2012 the high commissioner to Mauritius was non-resident ambassador.\nMadagascar has applied to join the Commonwealth of Nations. If and when it is admitted, the ambassador will become a high commissioner and the embassy will become a high commission.\nAmbassadors\n*1960–1961: Andrew Ronalds\n*1961–1962: John Street\n*1963–1967: Alan Horn\n*1967–1970: Mervyn Brown\n*1970–1975: Timothy Crosthwait\n*1975–1978: Mervyn Brown (non-resident)\n*1978–1979: Peter Moon (non-resident)\n*1980–1984: Richard Langridge\n*1984–1987: Malcolm McBain\n*1987–1990: Anthony Hayday\n*1990–1992: Dennis Amy\n*1993–1996: Peter Smith\n*1996–1999: Robert Dewar\n*1999–2002: Charles Mochan\n*2002–2005: Brian Donaldson\n*2005–2005: Anthony Godson (non-resident)\n*2007–2010: John Murton (non-resident)\n*2010–2012: Nicholas Leake (non-resident)\n*2012–2017: Timothy Smart\n*2017-2020: Phil Boyle\n*2020–2025:David Ashley\n*2025–present: Patrick Lynch\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://ukinmadagascar.fco.gov.uk/en/ UK in Madagascar] – British Embassy Madagascar"
