She started her acting career with HK ATV during the mid 80s and left around 1995 to join rival station TVB. In between her TV career, Yuen has been featured in many HK movies, including several with Stephen Chow's earlier films (Forbidden City Cop, God of Cookery, and Hail the Judge). Yuen has a long history with comedy and she has heavily played comedic roles in most of her career. However, she doesn't wish to be typecast into comedic roles and strives to diversify herself in other roles. On July 11, 2004, she married her boyfriend, Huang Naiyang. After nearly 17 years with TVB, Yuen decided to leave the station in 2012 and started filming dramas in mainland China. No longer tied to TVB, Yuen was able to express her disapproval of TVB's rough treatment of their actors. While she continues filming new dramas in mainland China, she still comes back to Hong Kong to film movies.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n!
