Toselli attacked with 1,500 men, hitting the surprised rebels in their undefended rear.\nThe surprise attack was just at the right time since the rebels had almost taken the fort.\nAt first, Bahta Hagos tried to negotiate with the Italians, however the negotiations lasted only up to 4:00pm, when another 1,000 Italian reinforcements arrived. Bahta was killed in the ensuing fight and his army quickly fell apart soon after.\nAftermath\nIn total, eleven Italians were killed and twenty-two were wounded in the action.\nReferences"
