It is located on the western shore of Lake Bathurst, New South Wales.\nHistory\nThe area was traditional lands of the Ngunnawal people, but was also traversed by other tribes going to the coast or the Monaro during the Bogong moth season. Stone artefacts dating back 20,000 years have been found at nearby Lake George.\nThe Lake Bathurst was discovered in April 1818 by an exploration commissioned by Governor Lachlan Macquarie to find a route from the inland to the settlement on the south coast at Jervis Bay that was headed by Surveyor General James Meehan. A village of Mulwaree was gazetted in the 19th century on the southern shore of Lake Bathurst, but failed to grow, moving 1½km to the west at the site of Tarago, on the main trainline.\nGeography\nSignificant features in the parish include:\n*The Mulwaree River, a perennial river that is part of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment.\n*Lake Bathurst (New South Wales) on the northern boundary\n* Townships of Tarago and Lake Bathurst\nEcology\ns.]]The area has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it regularly supports significant numbers of\n*near threatened blue-billed ducks\n*Australasian shovellers.\n*freckled ducks,\n*black swans, chestnut teals and\n*sharp-tailed sandpipers.\nSee also\n*Lake Bathurst (New South Wales)\nEconomy\nThe Parish is predominantly Agricultureal in its economic base, however, the economic base has diversified in recent years with:\n*An Intermodal transfer station on the main Sydney to Canberra railwayline.\n*the former Woodlawn Mine now a major waste facility for Sydney.\n*Woodlawn Wind Farm.\n*Woodlawn Bioreactor.\nThe parish has begun to be used as commuter zone for the nearby city of Canberra.\nFile:CanberraWindFarm.jpg|The Woodlawn Wind Farm\nFile:Tarago intermodal 1.jpg|Intermodal transfer station\nFile:Field in Winter, Tarago, New South Wales, Australia.jpg|Agriculture in Tarago.\nFile:Tarago AU war memorial.jpg|Tarago, war memorial.\nReferences"
