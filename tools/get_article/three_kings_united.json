They previously competed in the Lotto Sport Italia NRFL Division 1, with their last appearance coming in 2019.\nIn 2020, Three Kings United merged with Onehunga Sports to form Auckland United, which assumed Onehunga's position in the 2020 NRFL Premier season; the club's youth and social sectors remain in operation.\nThree Kings' home ground is Keith Hay Park, with a number of other parks used around central Auckland.\nClub history\nThe club was founded in 1997 through the amalgamation of Eden AFC (founded 1947) and Mount Roskill AFC (founded 1954). In 1994, Eden had merged with YMCA Grafton, a club with an illustrious history. YMCA Grafton was founded in 1985 as a merger between Grafton Rovers and Auckland YMCA, the latter of these teams having been a major team in the early days of organised football in Auckland. Auckland YMCA reached the semi-finals of the national knockout Chatham Cup in 1928, and are also known to have reached the later stages of the competition in 1932.\nThree Kings United are one of 31 member clubs of the Auckland Football Federation.\nSenior men's team\nTKU's men's team were finalists in the 2009 Chatham Cup, New Zealand's principal knockout cup competition, and currently play in the Northern Region Premier League. Both Eden and Mount Roskill were former winners of both competitions. Eden won the Chatham Cup in 1950 and the Northern League in 1974; Mount Roskill won the 1964 Chatham Cup, and the 1989 Northern League.\nWomen's senior team\nTKU's women's team is particularly strong, providing many players for the New Zealand national team at age-grade and full international level. Eight of the 21 New Zealand women's national under-20 football team squad members for the 2010 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup were Three Kings United players.\nHonours\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
