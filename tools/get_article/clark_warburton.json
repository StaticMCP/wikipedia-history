He was described as the \"first monetarist of the post-World War II period,\"  the most uncompromising upholder of a strictly monetary theory of business fluctuations,  and reviver of classic monetary-disequilibrium theory and the quantity theory of money.\nLife and works\nWarburton  received bachelor's and master's degrees from Cornell University after military service overseas during World War I.  From the 1920s to the early 1930s, he held teaching positions in India and the United States.  He received a Ph.D. degree at Columbia University in 1932. There his interest had shifted from history to economics while attending lectures of Wesley C. Mitchell. His dissertation was published as The Economic Results of Prohibition. From 1932 to 1934, he worked at the Brookings Institution. In 1934 he joined the newly formed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  He subsequently became chief economist there, retiring from that position in 1965. He continued to publish research on substantive and historical monetary economics thereafter.\nIn the period from 1945, Warburton was a critic of Keynesian theory when the latter was \"crowding out interest in money.\" He made his case in a series of papers, most of them empirically oriented.  He compiled and constructed quarterly data for the U.S. in the 1918–47 period, which showed that deviations in the money supply and bank reserves from trend  preceded in the same direction business-cycle turning points  of successively final output sold, output, prices, and the velocity of money.• Clark Warburton, 1946. \"The Misplaced Emphasis in Contemporary Business-Fluctuation Theory,\" Journal of Business, 19(4)  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2349740 pp. 199–220].&nbsp;&nbsp; • _____, 1948b. \"Bank Reserves and Business Fluctuations,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association, 43(244),  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2280705 pp. 547–58].&nbsp;&nbsp; • _____, 1950d. \"The Theory of Turning Points in Business Fluctuations,\"  Quarterly Journal of Economics, 64(4), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1884386 pp. 525–49]. He extended such results to 1965 some 20 years later.\nIn examining longer periods of time (decades) for 1799–1939 and annual data from 1909 to 1947, he found that velocity adjusted for trend and production capacity was relatively stable in peace time, despite extreme monetary volatility  and that changes in the quantity of money were the \"overwhelmingly dominant factor\"  responsible for changes in the price level, consistent with the quantity theory of money.• Clark Warburton, 1945c. \"The Volume of Money and the Price Level between the World Wars,\" Journal of Political Economy, 53(2),  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1825051 pp. 150–63].&nbsp;&nbsp; • _____, 1949a. \"The Secular Trend in Monetary Velocity,\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 63(1),  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1882734 pp. 68–91].\nThese findings supported Warburton's contentions that:\n*  instability of the money supply was a major source of business fluctuations, including the Great Depression,  not merely an intensifying factor\n* stability of monetary policy was key to macroeconomic stability.• Clark Warburton, 1962. \"Monetary Disturbances and Business Fluctuations in Two Centuries of American History,\" in L.

At that time Warburton sharply criticized Friedman's then-existing monetary framework. In this connection, Warburton convinced Friedman that the Federal Reserve had caused the Great Depression and that a money supply growth rate rule would have averted the Depression had the Federal Reserve followed such a rule. During the next decade Friedman became the leading advocate of the view that the Federal Reserve caused the Great Depression and he adopted a money supply growth rate rule as his main monetary policy platform.\nNotes\nSelected publications\n* 1932a, 1968.
