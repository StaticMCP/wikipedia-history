However, because the constitution left all of the details of the operation of the office up to future legislation, it was not until Act 166/1993 came into effect on 1 July 1993 that the office could in practice be formed.\nEnglish name\nThe presence of two English names for the office is the result of varying translations of its name in the Constitution and its authorizing legislation. In the official translation of the Constitution, the name follows the Czech literally. Hence, it confers the name, \"Supreme Control Office\", indicating that the office performed the duties of a controller. In the official translation of Act 166/1993, however, a more precise English word is used, resulting in \"Supreme Audit Office\", conveying the sense that the principal duties of the office are those of an external auditor. It is this latter translation which has perhaps gained dominance, given its singular use on the agency's official website.\nSome generally similar positions in governments worldwide include:\n* Auditor General of Pakistan\n* Comptroller General of the United States\n* Supreme Chamber of Control of the Republic of Poland\n* State Auditor of Mississippi\n* Japanese Board of Audit\n* Comptroller and Auditor General\n* State Comptroller of Israel\nReferences\nExternal links\nInternational Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions – Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic is a member"
