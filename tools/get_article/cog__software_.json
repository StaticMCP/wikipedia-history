      "text": "# Cog (software)\n\nCog is an open source audio player for macOS. The basic layout is a single-paned playlist interface with two retractable drawers, one for navigating the user's music folders and another for viewing audio file properties, like bitrate. Along with supporting most audio formats compatible with macOS's Core Audio API, Cog supports a wide array of other audio formats, along with their metadata, which are otherwise unsupported on macOS.\nIn April 2006, Cog joined other Mac OS X audio software Tag and Max in an effort by the respective authors to consolidate Mac OS X open source audio software on the internet. Subsequently, the Cog website was redesigned to Tag and Max's website design, and its forums were also moved to the Tag and Max Forums. In July 2007, Cog moved to its own separate forums shortly before the release of version 0.06. Last build been created in 2013.\nAs the original project appears to be abandoned, with the website last updated in 2008, there are now several forks of the project maintained by others. In 2013, Christopher Snowhill started a fork and continues to maintain and develop it as of 2020. In 2015, MacRumors user Vivo made a new audio player Phonix, which is based on original Cog code.\nFeatures\nGeneral\n* Growl support\n* Global hotkeys\n* File drawer\n* Info drawer\n* Smart shuffle\n* Seeking\n* Feedback form\n* Automatic Updates (choice of Stable, Nightly, or Unstable)\nAudio formats\n* AIFF\n* Apple Lossless\n* Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\n* Monkey's Audio\n* MP3\n* Musepack\n* Ogg Vorbis\n* Shorten\n* WavPack\n* WAV\n* Video game music formats (NSF, GBS, GYM, SPC, VGM, HES, etc.)\n* tracker formats (IT, S3M, XM, MOD, etc.)\n* Cue sheet\nPlaylist formats\n* M3U\n* PLS\nMetadata formats\n* Vorbis comments\n* ID3 v1.0, 1.1, 2.3+\n* FLAC tags\n* APEv1 and APEv2 tags\nLanguages/Localizations\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Greek\n* Hebrew\n* Swedish\n* Catalan\n* Dutch\n* Russian\n* Spanish\n* Chinese\nKnown Issues for Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard\n* Playlist issues including \"invisible playlist\"\n* Unattended cross-fade at random times\nSee also\n* Comparison of audio player software\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://cog.losno.co/ Cog home page]\n* [https://forum.cog.losno.co/ Cog forums]"
