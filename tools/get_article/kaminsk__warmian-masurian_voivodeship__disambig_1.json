It lies approximately  north of Górowo Iławeckie,  west of Bartoszyce, and  north of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nDuring World War II, it was the location of the southern section of the German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag I-A. The camp was established on 6 September 1939, during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II. It initially held Polish POWs, and then also French and Belgian POWs from 1940, Soviet POWs from 1941, Italian POWs from 1943, plus also smaller numbers of British and Serbian POWs. In 1950 Kamińsk prison was established in its place. Segments of it were burned down during a prison strike in 1981, which was part of a greater wave of unrest in Poland.\nReferences"
