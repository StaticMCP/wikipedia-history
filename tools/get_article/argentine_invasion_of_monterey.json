This operation was part of Bouchard's broader Pacific naval campaign during the Argentine War of Independence, aiming to disrupt Spanish colonial control along the Pacific coast of the Americas.\nBouchard's forces temporarily captured and sacked the town of Monterey, California, then the capital of Alta California, a province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. After destroying military and government buildings, his forces withdrew a few days later without establishing a permanent presence.\nBackground\nDuring Argentina's struggle for independence from Spain, naval raids were launched to challenge Spanish authority across the Pacific. Hipólito Bouchard, commissioned as a privateer by the revolutionary government, was given the mission of attacking Spanish holdings as far north as California.\nIn 1815 Bouchard started a naval campaign under the command of Admiral William Brown, wherein he attacked the fortress of El Callao and the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil. On 12 September 1815 he was granted a corsair license to fight the Spanish aboard the French-built corvette Halcón, which had been bought for the Argentine State by Vicente Anastacio Echeverría.\nAfter Bouchard's return to Buenos Aires, he decided to stay with the frigate Consecuencia for his next campaign. In concert with Vicente Echevarría the ship's name was changed to La Argentina.\nOn 27 June Bouchard obtained the Argentine corsair patent (a \"letter of marque\") that authorized him to prey on Spanish commerce, the countries of Spain and Argentina being in a state of war at the time.\nInvasion\nBouchard arrived with two ships, La Argentina and Santa Rosa, and approached Monterey in late November 1818. After issuing an ultimatum and receiving no response, his men launched an assault on November 24. The Spanish defenders, under José Bandini, were stationed at the Presidio Real de San Carlos de Monterrey, the main military fortification in Alta California.\nOccupation\nThe fortifications were outdated and poorly defended and were quickly overwhelmed, with the town and fort becoming occupied by Argentine forces.\nThe Spanish garrison offered minimal resistance, and after roughly an hour of combat, Bouchard’s forces succeeded in capturing the fort. The Argentine flag was then raised over Monterey, marking a symbolic assertion of Argentine presence on the Pacific coast of North America. Although the Spanish flag had long flown there as part of colonial rule, this event marked the first time an independent foreign nation had occupied and hoisted its flag in California preceding both the Mexican and United States flags.\nBouchard’s forces occupied Monterey for six days. During the occupation, they seized livestock and supplies, and set fire to several strategic buildings, including the Presidio of Monterey fort, the artillery headquarters, the governor’s residence, and various Spanish colonial homes. Despite the destruction of infrastructure, the civilian population was not harmed. After achieving their objectives, the Argentines withdrew on November 29 and continued their privateering campaign along the Pacific coast.\nAftermath\nAlthough the occupation was brief, the raid demonstrated the reach of the Argentine Navy and exposed the vulnerability of distant Spanish colonies. It also contributed to Bouchard’s reputation as a significant figure in the South American independence wars.\nSee also\n* Hipólito Bouchard\n* William Brown\n* United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata\n* Alta California\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* List of wars involving Argentina\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* Alconada Mon, Hugo (27 November 2005). \"[https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/bouchard-el-corsario-argentino-que-ocupo-seis-dias-california-nid759913/ Bouchard, el corsario argentino que ocupó seis días California]\" (in Spanish).
