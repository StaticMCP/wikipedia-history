Prompted by a perceived lack in ship numbers when compared with the British Royal Navy, the O class' design was born with the suggestion of modifying the  design with  guns instead of .\nThe ships were incorporated into the 1939 Plan Z for the re-equipment and expansion of the ; while an aircraft carrier, H-class battleships and smaller ships engaged convoy escorts, one or more O-class ships would attack the merchant ships.\nThe O class' design reflected their intended role; a heavy main armament (six 380&nbsp;mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor to defend against the same and nothing more, and a high top speed so that they could get away from slower but much better armored capital ships.\nAlthough planned and ordered, construction did not progress due to lack of materials and higher priorities for ship construction.\nDevelopment\nGenesis: P-class cruisers\nEven with the completion of the two s and the construction of two s, the German Navy had fewer ships than other European navies. This led to a decision in 1937 to build ships to an improved  design. After more than twenty designs were considered to meet the navy's specifications, one was chosen; it was designated as cruiser \"P\" (the \"P\" for &nbsp;— German: \"armor\"). Under the original plan, twelve P-class ships were to be built. The ships were designed as cruiser killers that would have heavy enough armament and armor to take on light and heavy cruisers but enough speed to outrun battleships and battlecruisers.\nMany problems were encountered with designing the ships, the most prevalent being armor. The required maximum speed of  meant that the minimum length had to grow from the original . It also meant that the beam could be a minimum of —unless diesel engines, like those used in the s, were desired; they would increase the beam by . Unfortunately for the designers, the widened beam meant that an even longer hull was needed to maintain hydrodynamic efficiency. All of this complicated the armor arrangements, as more armor was needed to cover the longer length and widened beam. Eventually it was deemed that it was impossible to include diesel power on a  displacement.\nThe switch to battlecruisers was the result of a proposal to up the main armament from  55 caliber-long guns to /47-caliber guns. Various reasons were behind this. Among other reasons, experiments showed that the smaller gun was \"far less effective\" than the larger gun, a class of twelve ships would have overtaxed the shipyards already heavily burdened with other ships, and the smallest guns on any foreign capital ship in service or under construction were more than  larger in caliber than the 283&nbsp;mm guns. The most persuasive argument for increasing the armament came in 1939, when Adolf Hitler denounced the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement.\nBattlecruisers\nAlthough interest in the P-class ships and the battlecruiser proposal waned for a time in late 1937 and early 1938, it was quickly revived on 28 April 1938 with Hitler's public airing of his views on the 1935 Anglo-German Treaty and the consequent increased possibility of war with the United Kingdom. Calling the Naval Staff and Admiral Erich Raeder to him, Hitler laid out his thoughts of a strong navy that could pose enough danger to the British such that they would enter into an alliance with Germany rather than go to war. As decided here, Plan Z entailed two task forces each centered on three H-class battleships and one aircraft carrier, with cruisers and destroyers as escorts. In war, these forces would collaborate with the three battlecruisers by occupying convoy screens while U-boats and one or more of the O class destroyed the cargo-carrying merchant ships. The presence of the battlecruisers operating at large would have the secondary effect of forcing the Royal Navy to deploy battleships as convoy escorts, thus weakening any fleet that could engage the Plan Z task forces.\nAs part of the plan, design work on the P class was halted in mid-1939 in favor of the O class. Displacement was limited to  in the new designs so that the length of construction would be shortened from the normal four or more years that a battleship required, to an estimated three to three and a half years. Required characteristics for the battlecruisers was a displacement of , a main battery of six  guns, a secondary battery of dual purpose guns, a top speed of , a range of  at , and enough armor to counter the  guns of heavy cruisers.\nLike the P class, there were problems with fitting an all-diesel drive into the hull of the ships. It was enough that the design team decided that it would not be prudent to use an all-diesel arrangement; instead, a hybrid diesel-steam turbine propulsion plant was to be used. The change allowed the central armored citadel to be reduced by  and the aft beam to be lowered by .\nAlthough plans were not finalized, the third battlecruiser, \"Q\", was ordered from  in Kiel on 8 August 1939. One month after, the contract design was refined. The displacement was increased to  (design) and  (full-load), while the draft at those two figures was , respectively. At the waterline, the length was set at  and beam at . The main battery was the same as previously (six /47-caliber guns in dual turrets), while the secondary battery was split between six paired /48-caliber anti-surface guns and paired /65-caliber anti-aircraft guns because German designers had not been able to develop a satisfactory dual-purpose gun. Light anti-aircraft guns were eight 37&nbsp;mm in four dual mounts and twenty 20&nbsp;mm autocannon in single mounts. Twelve  torpedo tubes finished out the armament aboard the ships. Four floatplanes for scouting were planned. At the design displacement, the maximum speed was reduced by half a knot, to ; this required a top shaft horsepower of 173,600.\nBy 1940, project drawings for the three battlecruisers were complete. They were reviewed by both Hitler and Raeder, both of whom approved. However, outside \"initial procurement of materials and the issuance of some procurement orders\", the ships' keels were never laid down. In large part, this was due to severe material shortages, especially of high-grade steel, since there were more pressing needs for these materials for the war effort. In addition, the dockyard personnel necessary for the ships' construction were by now occupied with more important work, primarily on new U-boats.\nSpecifications\nGeneral characteristics\nThe final design, which was completed by 1940, called for a ship that was  long at the waterline and  long overall. The planned ships had a beam of  and a designed draft of . The ships' designed displacement was , but displaced  standard and  at full displacement. The ships were to be of welded steel construction, with twenty watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 78% of the length of the hull. The ships were to have had a crew of 65 officers and 1,900 men.\nThey were intended to carry a number of boats aboard, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, two pinnaces, two yawls, and two dinghies. The ships were also to be equipped with a double catapult mounted between the two funnels, and four Arado Ar 196 seaplanes for maritime reconnaissance. The aircraft were stored in a main hangar just aft of the forward funnel, along with two smaller hangars, one on each side of the rear funnel.\nPropulsion\nThe O-class ships were to be driven by three screws, two diesel powered and one steam. Eight MAN 24-cylinder V-configuration two-stroke diesel engines powered two Vulcan gearboxes, both of which drove the outer pair of  diameter three-bladed screws. Aft of the diesel engines was a single boiler room with four Wagner high-pressure boilers that provided up to 55&nbsp;atmospheres of pressure. These supplied steam for one set of Brown, Boveri & Cie turbines, which provided power for the center  three-bladed screw. The O-class ships were designed to store 1,000&nbsp;tons of fuel oil for the high pressure boilers, and up to 4,610&nbsp;tons of diesel oil for the diesel engines. This enabled a maximum range of 14,000&nbsp;nautical miles at a cruising speed of 19&nbsp;knots. They were designed to steam at a maximum of 33.5&nbsp;knots, but were capable of up to 35&nbsp;knots. The ships had two rudders each. Eight 920&nbsp;kW diesel generators supplied electrical power for the ships, for a total of 7360&nbsp;kW, at 220&nbsp;V.\nArmament\nanti-aircraft gun]]\nThe ships' main armament batteries were to have consisted of six  L/47 SK C/34 quick-firing guns mounted in three twin turrets, the same Drh LC/38 gun turrets as were used on the Bismarck-class battleships. Two of the turrets were mounted in a superfiring pair forward, with the third turret placed aft of the main superstructure. The guns could depress to −8 degrees and elevate to 35 degrees. At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets  away. The guns had a designed supply of 630 shells, for a total of 105 rounds per gun. There were three types of shells: capped armor-penetrating, and two different high-explosive shells; all three shells weighed . The guns used a  fore charge and a  main charge in a brass case. This provided a muzzle velocity of 820&nbsp;meters per second (2,690&nbsp;feet per second).\nThe secondary battery consisted of six  L/48 quick-firing guns, also mounted in three twin turrets; two were placed on either side of the forward superstructure, the third was placed aft of the main superstructure, superfiring over the rear main battery turret. These guns were supplied with 900 rounds, for 150 shells per gun, and had a maximum range of . The ships were also armed with six  above-water torpedo tubes, with a total of 18 torpedoes.\nThe ships had an anti-aircraft battery consisting of eight  L/65 SK C/33 heavy anti-aircraft guns, eight  L/83 SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns, and twenty . The 10.5&nbsp;cm guns were emplaced in twin mounts, two on either side of the superstructure, as were the 3.7&nbsp;cm guns. The 2&nbsp;cm SK C/30 guns were placed in single mounts, dispersed on the superstructure amidships.\nArmor\nThe O-class ships were to be protected by Krupp  steel armor. The main armored belt was  thick in the most critical areas of the ship, including the machinery spaces and ammunition magazines, and  in other less important areas; the armor tapered to zero at the stern and bow of the ship. A torpedo bulkhead ran the length of the hull; the bulkhead was  thick for the majority of its length. A second bulkhead was placed in the central portion of the ship. The bulkhead was  thick but increased to  in the more important portions of the ship. Critical areas were further protected by 80&nbsp;mm-thick shields set back from the torpedo bulkhead. All of the lateral armor protection was  steel, with the exception of the torpedo bulkhead, which was . is hardened  armor, while  is more flexible soft steel. The hardened  had a breaking strength of 85–96&nbsp;kg/mm2 and 20% expansion, while the soft steel  had a breaking strength of 65–75&nbsp;kg/mm2 and 25% expansion. }}\nThe ships had several layers of horizontal deck armor. The upper deck was  thick, and the armored deck ranged in thickness from ; important areas were also protected by  thick overhead shields. The armored belt connected to 110&nbsp;mm-thick sloping armor. The forward conning tower had a roof 60&nbsp;mm thick and  armored sides; the aft conning tower was significantly less well protected. The roof was decreased to  and the sides were 50&nbsp;mm thick. The rangefinders were protected against shell splinters by  roofs and 30&nbsp;mm sides. All of this armor was .\nThe main battery turrets had 50&nbsp;mm thick roofs and sides that were  thick. The inner shields were  thick. The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets had  thick protection against shell fragments. All of the anti-aircraft weaponry were also protected with 14&nbsp;mm-thick gun shields. The aircraft hangars also had 14&nbsp;mm-thick splinter protection. The relatively thin armor protection given to the ships of the O class led to their derisive nickname \"\" (Without armor nonsense), a play on their provisional names.\nShips of the class\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Construction data\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" | Builder\n! scope=\"col\" | Ordered\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n| Projected\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|  Wilhelmshaven\n| Projected\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n| 8 August 1939\n|-\n|}\nFootnotes\nNotes\ndisplacement, six , four , eight , a maximum speed of 34–35 knot, a  range at 19&nbsp;knots,  side belt with a  belt to the bow and a  sloping towards the stern.\n}}\nguns on the American First World War-era s.
