The Waterfront North ward was created as a single-member ward from the western side of the former Kirkdale ward.\nThe ward boundaries follow the city boundary at the northern edge of the Canada Dock, Dacre Street and Bedford Place, thereafter St John's Road, the Merseyrail Northern Line, Leeds Street, Paisley Street, the southern edge of the Prince's Half-Tide Dock, and the River Mersey. The ward covers the Port of Liverpool from Canada Dock to the Prince's Half-Tide Dock, the Ten Streets area, Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse and Everton Stadium.\nThe ward has a significantly smaller number of residents than other wards of the city, with a -85% variance from average at the 2019 figures used in the review, at 567. This had increased by the 2023 elections to 864. However, due to the expected significant redevelopment of the docklands it was projected that by 2027 the electorate would be 4,035, representing a -6% variance.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
