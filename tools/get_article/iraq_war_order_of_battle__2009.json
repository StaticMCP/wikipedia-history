      "text": "# Iraq War order of battle, 2009\n\nBelow is an estimated list of the major units deployed within the Multi-National Force – Iraq and other United States military units that were operating in Iraq under the U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) in 2009, during the Iraq War.\nIn military science terminology, the description of the units involved in an operation is known as the order of battle (ORBAT). NATO and the U.S. Department of Defense define the order of battle as the identification, strength, command structure, and disposition of the personnel, units, and equipment of any military force.\nFrom September 2008 to 31 December 2009, the overall military commander in Iraq was General Raymond T. Odierno, Commander, Multi-National Force - Iraq (MNF-I) who reported to United States Central Command. MNF-I replaced Combined Joint Task Force 7 in May 2004. MNF-I consisted of Multi-National Corps - Iraq, Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq (MNSTC-I), and the Joint Contracting Command, Iraq/Afghanistan (JCCIA).\nOn January 1, 2010, Multi-National Force Iraq became United States Forces - Iraq.\nSpecial Operations Task Forces\nThere is a distinction in U.S. military terms between the troops of Multinational Force-Iraq and forces which fall directly under CENTCOM's control but are in Iraq also. There are two special operations task forces operating in Iraq, Task Force 77 and CJSOTF-AP. Though TF 77, a 'black' force, does not answer to MNF-Iraq, it is included here for the sake of completeness of the U.S. forces operating within Iraq. TF 77 was under the command of the Joint Special Operations Command and its principal mission was to hunt down the leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).\n*Task Force 77—LSA Anaconda, Balad\n**TF North/unidentified battalion 75th Ranger Regiment—unknown location, northern Iraq\n**TF West/unidentified element, DEVGRU—unknown location, western Iraq\n**TF Center/unidentified squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment - Delta—LSA Anaconda\n**TF Black/unidentified squadron, 22nd Special Air Service, Baghdad and Basra area\nThe second force, which appears to be separate from TF 77, is the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula (CJSOTF-AP). CJSOTF-AP is a \"white\", or unclassified, special operations task force that as of 2008 was always organized around the headquarters of either 5th Special Forces Group or 10th Special Forces Group. Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula (CJSOTF-AP), itself answers to Special Operations Command Central.\nOrder of battle as of 2009\nUnless otherwise noted, all units were U.S. in origin. This order of battle extends to battalion level and lists maneuver units only; artillery, support, special operations, and advisory units are not listed. Many brigade combat teams (BCTs) lent battalions to other BCTs during the course of their deployments, giving them \"operational control\" of those units. In such cases, the battalion's name is followed by \"OPCON.\" Many higher-echelon units have two or more designations, often the formal unit around which the formation is based and then the name of the provisional task force; in these cases, both names are included, separated by a slash. Units were stationed at a variety of bases, including Forward Operating Bases (FOB), Contingency Operating Bases (COB) and Joint Security Stations (JSS).\nMulti-National Corps - Iraq\n(General Raymond Odierno)—Camp Victory, Baghdad\n*Multi-National Corps Iraq/I Corps (Lieutenant General Charles H.

However, the UK turned over command to the United States on March 31, 2009, and were in the process of withdrawing the 4,100 UK personnel based in and around Basra, leaving behind just 400 by the end of July 2009. 20th Armoured Brigade commanded the British forces in Iraq, which were then attached the U.S.-led Multi-National Division South.\nAustralia\nThe Australian Defence Force had about 100 personnel providing security for the Australian Embassy in Baghdad.

It was supported and funded by all 28 NATO nations, and 14 nations had staff in theater as of January 2009, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Ukraine participated alongside these nations, though it is not a member of NATO.\nSee also\n*Reconstruction of Iraq : the transitional period following the multinational forces invaded Iraq in March 2003.\n*2003 invasion of Iraq - the multinational force's entry into Iraq by force and the combat between the old Iraqi army and the Coalition forces.\n**Invasion of Iraq order of battle, 2003\n*2003 - 2004 occupation of Iraq timeline : Timeline of events during Multinational force's occupation of Iraq, following 2003 invasion of Iraq\n*2005 in Iraq: Events in Iraq during the year 2005.\n*Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003\n*Iraqi insurgency : the armed campaign being waged by various irregular forces, both Iraqi and external in origin, against the multinational force and the new Iraqi government.\n*Iraq Survey Group: A fact-finding mission sent by the coalition after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs developed by Iraq under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.\n*Sectarian violence in Iraq : Events that could lead to an Iraqi civil war.\n*2008 Mosul offensive\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Bibliography\n*[http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=41512 1st Cavalry Division to take over Baghdad command]\n*[http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=10006 DoD announces Iraq force adjustments]\n*[http://www.defence.gov.au/opcatalyst/ Australian Defence Force: Operation Catalyst]\n*[http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=9770 DoD announces units for next Operation Iraqi Freedom rotation]\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072701537.html 3,700 troops' stay in Iraq is extended]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222154/http://www.fayettevillenc.com/article?id=238580 3rd Brigade to deploy to Iraq]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100502045131/http://www.drum.army.mil/sites/installation/pao/news/newsRelease.asp?id=2006/0607-21 Fort Drum anticipates final redeployments of 1st Brigade Combat Team]\n*[https://archive.today/20070801165529/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=9073 1,500 1st AD soldiers move from Kuwait to Iraq]\n*[http://www.kam.lt/index.php/en/34419/ Lithuanian military personnel in international operations]\n*[https://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/templatereleaseview1/B0A390AAD1B1D59C852570E00056F437?opendocument I MEF units deploying to Iraq]\n*[http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2006/nr20060620-13303.html DoD announces units for next Operation Iraqi Freedom rotation]\n*[http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2005/nr20051107-5075.html DoD announces units for next Operation Iraqi Freedom rotation (2005)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060624030006/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=7980 'Screaming Eagles' mark second Iraq deployment with ceremony]\n*[http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=8435 ‘Ironhorse’ Division assumes responsibility for Baghdad]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060725142121/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=8355 Two 1st Cavalry brigades going back to Iraq]"
