The ceremony was hosted by Brent Butt.  This was the first year that the ceremony was not televised, and the first year that no special awards were given.\nCanadian Comedy Awards, also known as Beavers, were awarded in 19 categories. Winners were picked by members of ACTRA (Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists), the Writers Guild of Canada, the Directors Guild of Canada, and the Comedy Association.\nThe TV series Made in Canada led with eight nominations followed by the film Last Wedding with five.  Made in Canada won four Beavers, two of which went to director Henry Sarwer-Foner.  Also winning two Beavers were Janet van de Graaf for best female improviser and best female TV performance in History Bites, Bob Martin for best male improviser and best writing for an episode of Made in Canada, and Rick Mercer for best male TV performance in Made in Canada and writing for This Hour has 22 Minutes.\nCeremony\nThe 3rd Canadian Comedy Awards ceremony was held on 4 April 2002 at The Docks in Toronto, Ontario. It was hosted by Brent Butt, the previous year's winner for best male stand-up.  This was the first year the ceremony was not broadcast, due to a lack of sponsorship.  As a result, the ceremony was scaled back in what journalist Leatrice Spevack described as a night of \"gags over glamour\".\nWhile giving his acceptance speech for best comedic play, the base of Doug Morency's Beaver fell off.  He quickly remarked, \"Obviously, they're not made in Canada\".\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface:\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://www.canadiancomedyawards.org/ Canadian Comedy Awards official website]"
