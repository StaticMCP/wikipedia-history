Croatian sculptor Ivo Kerdić created the medal, which has three grades: silver, bronze, and iron. It is named after King Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia, who ruled during the 11th century and was known for being loyal to the Pope.\nThe medal has two issues: Civil and Military. The Civil Issue has a white ribbon with red edges, while the Military Issue has a red ribbon with white edges. Decorations with oak leaves on the obverse signify acts of gallantry in action.\nThe medal was awarded until May 1945, and was given to several Germans as well as Croatian nationals fighting on the Eastern Front and in the Balkans campaign.\nSources\n* Hrvatska odlikovanja (mr. sc.
