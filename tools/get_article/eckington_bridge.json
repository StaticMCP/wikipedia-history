      "text": "# Eckington Bridge\n\n}}\nEckington Bridge is a stone bridge over the River Avon in Eckington in the English county of Worcestershire. It is a Grade II* listed building and has been scheduled as an ancient monument.\nThe first bridge at the site was built in 1440, replacing an earlier ferry, but this fell into disrepair and was replaced by the current stone bridge in the 1720s. It consists of six arches built of red sandstone with the piers being protected by cutwaters.\nOn the northern side of the bridge, slightly downstream, is a World War II pillbox.\nDuring 2011 and 2012 repairs were undertaken by Worcestershire County Council at a cost of £240,000.\nNext to the bridge is Eckington Wharf, which is no longer used commercially but provides public moorings, a canoe launching slipway and picnic area.\nThe bridge is the subject of a poem by Arthur Quiller-Couch, and a picture from 1929 by Walter J. Phillips.\nIn 2022 a collision between two cars on the bridge caused damage and a car entered the river.  The driver of that car died.\nReferences"
