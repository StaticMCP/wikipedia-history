Records on January 19, 1987, as a double album on two vinyl LPs.\nBackground\nThe band dissolved following the tour in support of its release, in part due to disagreements between songwriters Bob Mould and Grant Hart over the latter's drug use and the loss of their manager David Savoy from suicide in February 1987. This album, along with Candy Apple Grey, showcases the increasing maturity of Mould and Hart's writing—a change which alienated some long-time fans. This album is also known for its battle between the two songwriters, with Mould famously telling Hart that he would never have more than half of the songs on a Hüsker Dü album.\nMould later said that this time period was a \"rough stretch\", but that Warehouse was still a \"good record.\" \"Had it been pared back to a single record it might have had more impact, but we were already loggerheads at that point.\"\nThe album's title comes from the fact that the group had rented some warehouse space in which to write and rehearse; a change from their former practice of writing new material and testing it out on live audiences.\nDuring the recording sessions, Hart and Mould replaced a few of Greg Norton's bass tracks for their respective songs when Norton's own contributions were not to their liking. In his autobiography, Mould identified Hart's \"Charity, Chastity, Prudence and Hope\" as one of the songs whose bass lines were rerecorded, uncredited, by their composers.\nRelease\n\"Could You Be the One?\" was released as a single and video; the only other single released from the album was \"Ice Cold Ice\". Warehouse: Songs and Stories peaked at No. 117 on the Billboard Top 200 and also charted for a week on the UK Albums Chart at No. 72. Hüsker Dü was interviewed and performed \"Could You Be the One?\" and \"She's a Woman (And Now He is a Man)\" live on The Late Show With Joan Rivers on April 27, 1987.\nA cover version of \"Up in the Air\" was included on Heidi Berry's album Love.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Chicago Sun-Times\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = Chicago Tribune\n| rev3Score =\n| rev4 = The Philadelphia Inquirer\n| rev4Score =\n| rev5 = Q\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = Select\n| rev7score = 4/5\n| rev8 = Spin Alternative Record Guide\n| rev8Score = 7/10\n| rev9 = The Village Voice\n| rev9score = A−\n}}\nThe album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\nTrack listing\nCD releases of Warehouse: Songs and Stories combine all the songs onto a single disc.\nPersonnel\n*Bob Mould – guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, vocals\n*Grant Hart – drums, bass guitar, keyboards, percussion, vocals\n*Greg Norton – bass guitar, vocals\nProduction\n*Producers: Bob Mould, Grant Hart\n*Engineer: Steven Fjelstad\n*Mastering: Howie Weinberg\n*Photography: Daniel Corrigan, Hüsker Dü\nReferences"
