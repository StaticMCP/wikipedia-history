It was replaced with a second mural on 1 November 1993, also by Kershaw, featuring updated images. The mural had to be temporarily dismantled in 2006 over health and safety concerns. The mural was subsequently renovated and restored, before being removed again in 2014.\nThe site was purchased by developers in 2009 and the buildings reconstructed with modern facilities.
