He faced 16 rejections joining the US Air Force (Massachusetts Air National Guard) and US Army (Massachusetts Army National Guard) due to his religious articles of faith, ultimately becoming lead plaintiff in Singh v. McConville. Singh's legal action in a historic civil rights and religious freedom litigation against the US military contributed to broader reforms allowing Sikh religious accommodation for US service-members.\nBoston Marathon Achievements\nand Lt Governor at Massachusetts State House, 2025]]\nSingh won first place in the Boston Marathon Military Marches in 2022, 2023, and 2024. As of 2025, he has successfully completed seven Boston Marathons. He is recognized for honoring veterans and motivating fellow service members to seek help for mental health issues.\nEntrepreneurial Career\nAs CEO of Skyline Nav AI, Singh introduced Pathfinder Edge, a new solution to counteract GPS vulnerabilities for drones, aircraft and ground vehicles, at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. Under his leadership, Skyline Nav AI won NASA's Entrepreneurs Challenge in 2023. It also won Move America in 2024  and Vanguard Innovation Award at XPONENTIAL 2025.\nAdvocacy and Thought Leadership\nSingh wrote the book \"Recalculating: Life When GPS Goes Dark\" in 2025, which examines the widespread reliance on GPS technology. In the book, he discusses the use of GPS in sectors such as emergency services, transportation, and agriculture, and notes that disruptions to GPS can have broad effects. He refers to examples like Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, GPS jamming during the Ukraine conflict, and other documented outages that have caused operational failures. Singh argues that measures to strengthen infrastructure and preparedness could reduce the impact of such disruptions.\nReferences"
