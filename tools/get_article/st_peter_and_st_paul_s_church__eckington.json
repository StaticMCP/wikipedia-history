The south aisle porch was added in 1763 by John Platt of Rotherham. Some repair works were undertaken in 1833.\nThe church was restored between 1877 and 1878 by the architects Flockton of Sheffield. The plaster was removed from the pillars and interior walls. The galleries in the north, west and south were removed. The box pews were replaced with open benches. New stained glass windows were inserted and a new pulpit, reading desk, lectern and communion table were set up. The lectern was manufactured by Jones and Willis. The Dowager Lady Sitwell provided a brass cross for the reredos. The church reopened on 19 June 1878.\nThe church was remodelled and refurnished by Percy Heylyn Currey in 1907.\nOrgan\nThe organ was by Brindley & Foster. Following the restoration of the church in 1878, the organ was enlarged by Brindley & Foster with three new stops and an opening recital was given by Dr Haydn Keeton, organist of Peterborough Cathedral.
