The championships features six individual races: senior men's and women's 20 kilometres race walks, men's and women's under-20 10 kilometres race walks, an under-18 boys' 10&nbsp;km walk, and an under-18 girls' 5 kilometres race walk. Each individual race also has a national team component with points awarded based on finishing time, which are then totalled to form an overall team score for the championships.\nBalkan racewalking competitions originated in the main Balkan Athletics Championships. A men's 20&nbsp;km walk was first held in 1961 and a women's 10&nbsp;km walk was introduced in 1988 (later increased to a 20&nbsp;km race in 2001). One-off indoor walks were also held at the Balkan Indoor Athletics Championships in 1994. The Balkan championships for racewalking were first held separately from the main championships in 2000, though Balkan Athletics starting their official numbering of a discrete Balkan Race Walking Championships from 2002 onwards.\nList of winners (20 km)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!class=unsortable|Edition\n!Year\n!Venue\n!Country\n!Date\n!Senior men's winner\n!Time\n!Senior women's winner\n!Time\n!Team winner\n|-\n| 1st || 2002 || Vlasotince || Yugoslavia ||\n| align=left| || 1:22:06 || align=left| || 1:32:16 ||\n|-\n| 2nd || 2003 || Ruse || Bulgaria ||\n| align=left| || 1:22:40 || align=left| || 1:35:12 ||\n|-\n| 3rd || 2004 || Reșița || Romania ||\n| align=left| || 1:21:51 || align=left| || 1:28:58 ||\n|-\n| 4th || 2005 || Preveza || Greece ||\n| align=left| || 1:25:48 || align=left| || 1:35:35 ||\n|-\n| 5th || 2006 || Istanbul || Turkey ||\n| align=left| || 1:22:31 || align=left| || 1:30:46 ||\n|-\n| 6th || 2007 || Galați || Romania ||\n| align=left| || 1:23:10 || align=left| || 1:33:14 ||\n|-\n| 7th || 2008 || Bucharest || Romania || 12 April\n| align=left| || 1:26:59 || align=left| || 1:34:37 ||\n|-\n| 8th || 2009 || Bucharest || Romania ||\n| align=left| || 1:23:21.20 || align=left| || 1:29:56.30 ||\n|-\n| 9th || 2010 || Bucharest || Romania ||\n| align=left| || 1:23:29.30 || align=left| || 1:37.26 ||\n|-\n| 10th || 2011 || Bucharest || Romania ||\n| align=left| || 1:22:31 || align=left| || 1:33:38 ||\n|-\n| 11th || 2012 || Bucharest || Romania ||\n| align=left| || 1:28:50 || align=left| || 1:35:17 ||\n|-\n| 12th || 2013 || Ayvalık || Turkey ||\n| align=left| || 1:28:42 || align=left| || 1:39:17 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 13th || 2014 || Balchik || Bulgaria ||\n| align=left| || 1:26.31 || align=left| || 1:34.56 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 14th || 2015 || Ayvalık || Turkey ||\n| align=left| || 1:27:30 || align=left| || 1:39:36 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 15th || 2016 || Florina || Greece ||\n| align=left| || 1:31:32 || align=left| || 1:38:29 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 16th || 2017 || Florina || Greece ||\n| align=left| || 1:26:40 || align=left| || 1:34:00 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 17th || 2018 || Zrenjanin || Serbia ||\n| align=left| || 1:26:27 || align=left| || 1:39:01 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 18th || 2019 || Alexandroupoli || Greece ||\n| align=left| || 1:24:40 || align=left| || 1:34:55 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 19th || 2020 || Ivano-Frankivsk || Ukraine || 14 March\n| align=left| || 1:20:46 || align=left| || 1:30:22 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 20th || 2021 || Antalya || Turkey || 27 March\n| align=left| || 1:24:20 || align=left| || 1:30:12 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 21st || 2022 || Athens || Greece || 3 April\n| align=left| || 1:30:24 || align=left| || 1:38:01 ||align=left|\n|-\n| 22nd || 2023 || Antalya || Turkey || 9 April\n| align=left| || 1:25:38 || align=left| || 1:29:56 ||align=left|\n|}\nReferences\n;Winners list\n*[http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/results.php Results] .
