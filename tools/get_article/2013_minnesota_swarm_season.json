      "text": "# 2013 Minnesota Swarm season\n\nThe 2013 Minnesota Swarm season was the ninth season of the Minnesota Swarm, a lacrosse team based in Saint Paul, Minnesota playing in the National Lacrosse League.\nThe season did not start the way the Swarm might have hoped. Five of their first six games were decided by a single goal, but the Swarm only won two of them. They fell to 3-7 before dominating three straight home games, winning by 7, 9, and 14 goals. They finished at 7-9, good for fifth in the West but thanks to the Buffalo Bandits' 6-10 record, the Swarm crossed over to the Eastern division and made the playoffs.\nIn the first round, they had another dominating game, defeating the regular season champion Toronto Rock 20-11 in Toronto. But their visit to the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester was less successful, and the eventual champion Knighthawks ended the Swarm's season with a 12-10 win.\nRegular season\nFinal standings\nGame log\nReference:\nPlayoffs\nGame log\nRoster\n|Defenseman=\n|Forwards=\n|Transition=\n|Practice=\n|Injured=\n|Holdout=\n|Unable=\n|Restricted=\n|Head coach=\n* Joe Sullivan\n|Assistant coaches=\n* Aime Caines\n* Bobby Keast\n|}}\nTransactions\nTrades\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" bordercolor=\"#DFDFDF\"  cellpadding=\"5\"\n| July 26, 2012\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota Swarm1st round selection, 2015 entry draft\n| valign=\"top\"| To Philadelphia WingsKevin Ross\n|-\n| July 27, 2012\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota SwarmShawn Williams\n| valign=\"top\"| To Edmonton RushTwo 2nd round selections, 2013 entry draft\n|-\n| July 27, 2012\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota Swarm3rd overall selection, 2012 entry draft\n| valign=\"top\"| To Buffalo BanditsShawn WilliamsBrendan Doran5th, 14th, and 18th overall selections, 2012 entry draft\n|-\n|}\nEntry Draft\nThe 2012 NLL Entry Draft took place on October 1, 2012.
