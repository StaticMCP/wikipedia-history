It is located  from the district headquarters of Kapurthala, and  from the state capital, Chandigarh. Phagwara is known for its production of sugar, glucose, starch, fine fabric, preet's paints, and auto parts. It is locally known for the Shri Hanuman Garhi Temple.\nHistory\nPhagwara was initially a market town in the region of Punjab, founded by Chaudhary Phaggu Mal Basra, a Jatt Jagirdar landlord of the area. In 1635, the Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib, visited the city.\nBhai Phaggu, a Gurmukh, Masand, and Sri Guru Amardas Ji devotee, played a pivotal role in the development of Phagwara. Guru Amardas sent Bhai Phaggu to preach Sikhism to the city of Sasaram in Bihar, where Phaggu spent the rest of his life. Guru Teg Bahadur once visited Bhai Phaggu in Bihar and called him Chacha ji, leading to Bhai Phaggu Ji, also known as Chacha Phaggu.\nWhen Guru Hargobind Sahib (the sixth Sikh Guru) visited Phagwara in 1635 to see Bhai Phaggu's home, he was not respected by the townspeople, who opposed Bhai Phaggu. According to local legend, Guru Hargobind Ji exclaimed, “Phagu Da Warra, Bahron Mitha Andra Khara!” Over time, the term “Phagu Da Warra” evolved into “Phagwara,” becoming an enduring part of the region’s identity.\nFrom Akbar's time to till 1803 Basra Jats remained Jagirdars of the Phagwara area, Bhai Phaggus family was the most powerful family of the Punjabi region of Doaba, controlling approximately 240 villages in Phagwara and Banga Tehsils. His descendant, Chaudhary Trilok Chand Basra, was married to Princess Rajinder Kanwar, daughter of Maharaja Ala Singh of Patiala. He was later succeeded by Chaudhary Chuhar Mal Basra, the last chief of the family. Chuhar Mal Basra was defeated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1803.\nHere is an example of a local historical Vaar for Phaggu Mal:\n\"ਬੋਲੇ ਤੀਜੇ ਪਾਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਗੁਰ ਪਰਉਪਕਾਰੀ\nਕਹਿੰਦੇ ਫੱਗੂ ਮੱਲ ਜੀ ਕਰ ਲਵੋ ਤਿਆਰੀ\nਸੇਵਾ ਲੈਣੀ ਤੁਸੀ ਤੋਂ ਦਿੱਲ ਅਸਾਂ ਨੇ ਧਾਰੀ\nਜਾਵੋ ਸਾਸਾ ਰਾਮ ਨੂੰ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰੀ\nਸਿੱਖੀ ਦਾ ਧੰਨ ਤੁਸਾਂ ਕੋਲ ਹੈ ਬਰਕਤ ਭਾਰੀ\nਸਫਲ ਕਰੇਗਾ ਗਰੇਵਾਲ਼ ਸੇਵਾ ਬਨਵਾਰੀ\"\nGeography\nPhagwara is located in Kapurthala district, in the state of Punjab.
