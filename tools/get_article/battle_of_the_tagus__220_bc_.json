      "text": "# Battle of the Tagus (220 BC)\n\nThe battle of the Tagus was a confrontation that took place in the framework of the Carthaginian campaigns against the peoples of the Central Plateau of the Iberian Peninsula. It took place in 220 B.C. along the river Tagus, pitting an army commanded by Hannibal Barca against a large Carpetani army, which had been joined by contingents of Vaccaei and Olcades. According to the numbers shown by the classic sources, it had to be the battle that involved a greater number of combatants in the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman presence.\nThis confrontation is the first pitch battle led by Hannibal Barca - who was then 27 years old - after the sieges of Althia, Helmantiké (Salamanca) and Arbucala (Toro). It is also the first historical account of the Carpetani.\nThe battle took place in one of the fords that allowed crossing the upper stretch of the Tagus. Traditionally, the place known as Valdeguerra, in Colmenar de Oreja, has been considered as the site where this war event took place. Due to the dates of the beginning of Hannibal's campaign (spring); the journey made from Qart Hadasht (Cartagena) to the place of the battle (more than 1200 kilometers) and the time spent in the sieges of Helmantiké and Arbucala, it is estimated that the battle took place during the autumn.\nReferences"
