Both systems selected the undefeated Michigan Wolverines as the national champion.\nThe AP sportswriters' poll would not begin being published continuously until 1936. (although, the first time was a one instance publishing in 1934)\nChampions (by ranking)\nMost major rankings (both contemporary and retroactive) have identified Michigan as the season's champion. The three exceptions were the contemporary ranking Dunkel System (which found Ohio State the champion), the contemporary Williamson System ranking (which found USC to be the champion), and ranking by Parke H. Davis for ''Spalding's Official Foot Ball Guide (which found Princeton to have been co-champion alongside Michigan).\n*Berryman QPRS: Michigan\n*Billingsley Report: Michigan\n*Boand System: Michigan\n*College Football Researchers Association: Michigan\n*Parke H.

Parke Davis' rankings were also published soon after season. All other methods were given retroactively''\nBoand System\nThe Boand System was a mathematical ranking system developed by William F. Boand and sometimes billed as the \"Azzi Ratem\" (as I rate 'em) system.\n1. Michigan\n2. Princeton\n3. USC\nDickinson System\nFrank G. Dickinson, an economics professor at the University of Illinois, had invented the Dickinson System to rank colleges based upon their records and the strength of their opposition.  The system was originally designed to rank teams in the Big Nine (later the Big Ten) conference.  Chicago clothing manufacturer Jack Rissman then persuaded Dickinson to rank the nation's teams under the system, and the Rockne Memorial Trophy was awarded to the winning university.\nIn an AP story, the system was explained:\nMichigan (7–0–1), Minnesota (4–0–4) and Princeton (9–0) were all unbeaten, and Princeton was untied as well.  Based on its schedule, Michigan was ranked highest by Professor Dickinson.  As in 1932, Dickinson, an economics professor at the University of Illinois, included four Big Ten Conference teams among the best in the US.  In 1933, they were Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio State, and Purdue.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Rank\n! Team\n! Record\n!
