It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nJoe Smith-Engelhardt of Exclaim! rated this album a 7 out of 10, telling readers, \"If you thought of Microwave as just another emocore band until now, Death Is a Warm Blanket should change your mind. The record feels like a big shift in their direction that they hopefully continue to explore on future releases.\" A review in The Music ended, \"although I have a few minor issues with what is still a robust final product, 'Death is a Warm Blanket' serves as a steadfast pillar in the ever-growing catalog of Microwave; one that'll certainly satiate and blow the ears off of every fan come September&nbsp;13th\" and characterized the release as a \"gut-wrenching\" \"droning and sludgy mesh of genres, and a colourful display of the emotions that come with a flurry of human stresses\". At PunkNews, Death Is a Warm Blanket was scored 3.5 out of 5 stars by Renaldo69 who compared this sound to Manchester Orchestra and Taking Back Sunday, with this album displaying the band's versatility.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
