Shortly after his birth in 1865, his family relocated to Yellow Springs, Ohio, when his father became principal of the preparatory school of Antioch College.  In 1873, he began attending public school in Columbus after his father relocated the family after being appointed first President of The Ohio State Agricultural and Mechanical College.\nCareer\nOrton Jr. graduated from Ohio State University with an Engineer of Mines degree in 1884. From 1884 to 1888, he was chemist and superintendent of blast furnaces. The regular manufacture of high silicon alloy of iron, \"ferro-silicon,\" in the United States was introduced first by him, at the Bessie Furnace, New Straitsville, Ohio, 1887–88. In the latter year, he entered the ceramic industries of Ohio, managing several plants until 1893.\nIn 1894, Orton was appointed the first chairman of a school of ceramic engineering at Ohio State University, the first ceramic engineering school in the United States. This school for instruction in the technology of clay, glass and cement industries was established largely through his efforts. Following in his father's footsteps, Orton was the State Geologist of Ohio from 1899 until 1906. Orton also served as the Dean of the Ohio State College of Engineering from 1902 to 1906 and again from 1910 to 1915.\nOrton served as the secretary of the American Ceramic Society from 1899 to 1917 and later as president from 1930 to 1931. From this role he led the organization from its inception and played an important role in its early growth and establishment as a scientific organization.\nOrton honored his father with the Orton Memorial Library of Geology, inside Orton Hall at Ohio State University, for perusing the theories and records of earthly change. Orton Hall would later house the Orton Geological Museum.[http://ortongeologicalmuseum.osu.edu/ Orton Geological Museum], School of Earth Sciences, Ohio State University, USA.\nWorld War I\nIn 1916, Orton aided in the drafting of the US National Defense Act.  Later that year, during World War I, Orton entered the United States military service.  In 1917, he was commissioned a Major in the Officer's Reserve Corps.  By 1919, he became a Brigadier General in the Quartermaster's Officers Reserve Corp.  On June 2, 1919, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal by the United States Congress.\nHe purchased, created and donated Camp Mary Orton (named after his first wife) to the Godman Guild of Columbus which operated it as a summer camp and retreat for young mothers and their babies.\nLater career\nHe was elected President of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce in 1921 and re-elected for a second term in 1922 (only the second citizen to succeed himself). In 1922, he received a Doctor of Science from Rutgers College. In 1931, he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Alfred University. Later in 1931, he received the professional degree of Ceramic Engineer from The Ohio State University.\nOrton developed a series of pyrometric cones and established the Standard Pyrometric Cone Company to manufacture the cones, which continue to be used. He died in 1932, and in accordance with his will the Edward Orton Jr. Ceramic Foundation was formed as a charitable trust to operate of the Standard Pyrometric Cone Company.\nPersonal life\nOrton married twice, first to Mary Princess Anderson (1888 until her death in 1927) and later to Mina Althea Orton (1928 until his death in 1932).\nPublications\n* [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435053731972;view=1up;seq=677 Clays of Ohio and the Industries Established Upon Them], in Ohio Geological Survey, v.
