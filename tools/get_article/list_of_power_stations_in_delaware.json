In 2023, Delaware had a total summer capacity of 3,296&nbsp;MW through all of its power plants, and a net generation of 4,772&nbsp;GWh. In 2024, the electrical energy generation mix was 87.3% natural gas, 4.7% other gases, 3.6% solar, 3.1% coal, 1.3% biomass, and less than 0.1% wind. Distributed small-scale solar, including customer-owned photovoltaic panels, delivered an additional net 205&nbsp;GWh to the state's electricity grid in 2024. This is about 20 percent more than the amount generated by Delaware's utility-scale solar facilities.\nFossil-fuel power stations\nData from the U.S. Energy Information Administration serves as a general reference.\nPetroleum\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
