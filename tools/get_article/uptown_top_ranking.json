Released in 1977, the song comprises the girls ad-libbing to deejay track \"Three Piece Suit\" by Trinity. The lyrics were written by the duo and Errol Thompson. It was produced by Joe Gibbs, using a re-recording of the riddim of the 1967 Alton Ellis song \"I'm Still in Love\", which had already been re-popularised in the 1970s by Marcia Aitken's cover \"I'm Still in Love With You Boy\", and \"Three Piece Suit\" by Trinity, to which \"Uptown\" was an \"answer record\".\nThe record was initially recorded as a joke.  It was accidentally played by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel resulting in numerous requests for additional plays. With early championing by Peel and a performance on Top of the Pops, it soon became a surprise hit, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart in February 1978. The track spent a total of 11 weeks in the chart. Althea & Donna became the youngest female duo to reach the number-one spot on the UK chart.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1977–1978)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1978)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|44\n|}\nCertifications\nSampling\nThe song was sampled in Abs Breen's 2002 UK top 10 hit single, \"What You Got\".\nSee also\n*List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1970s\n*List of one-hit wonders on the UK Singles Chart\nReferences"
