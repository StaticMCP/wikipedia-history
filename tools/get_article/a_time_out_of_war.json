In 1955, it won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) at the 27th Academy Awards, first prize at the Venice Film Festival Live Action Short Film category, and a BAFTA Special Award, among others.\nSummary\nThe film depicts a one-hour truce agreed to by Union and Confederate soldiers who are on opposite sides of a river.\nProduction\nDenis Sanders was in UCLA film school whilst his brother was a UCLA undergraduate.  For Denis's thesis, he searched for an American Civil War short story that was in the public domain to adapt into a film.  He chose Pickets, an 1897 story by Robert W. Chambers. Folksinger and songwriter Frank Hamilton composed the original music for the film.\nReception and legacy\nCritic Bosley Crowther called it \"a keen and eloquent little picture\".\nThe prestige of the film led Terry to be hired by Charles Laughton as the second unit director of The Night of the Hunter (1955). Both brothers were then hired to write the screenplay for The Naked and the Dead, which led to film careers for both men.\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved A Time Out of War in 2007 and it was added to the National Film Registry.\nCast\n* Corey Allen as Connor\n* Barry Atwater as Craig\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.americanfilmfoundation.com/order/time_out_of_war.shtml A Time Out of War] at the American Film Foundation"
