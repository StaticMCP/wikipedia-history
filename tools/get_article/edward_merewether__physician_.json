He was an expert in industrial medicine and the laws linked to this, working especially with asbestosis. In 1944 he was appointed Honorary Physician to King George VI. Close colleagues called him \"Uncle M\". In authorship he is known as E. R. A. Merewether.\nLife\nHe was born in Durham on 2 March 1892 the son of Alworth Edward Merewether, a naval surgeon.\nHe studied medicine at Durham University graduating MB BS in 1914. In the First World War, he served in the Royal Navy, having been appointed a temporary surgeon on 24 October 1914.

After the war he started specialising in chest diseases.\nIn 1927, he joined the staff of the Factory Department of the Home Office as a medical inspector. Here he was one of the first to identify the dangers of breathing asbestos fibre and also identified silicosis in sandblast operators. In 1928 he joined Dr H. E. Seiler, Medical Officer of Health in Glasgow looking at cases of pulmonary fibrosis in asbestos workers. Merewether conclusively proved a link between asbestos and the disease.\nIn 1940 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
