Completed in 1828, the obelisk is the oldest monument in Quebec City and the second-oldest war monument in Canada, the oldest being Nelson's Column in Montreal, which was completed in 1809.  The monument commemorates the gallantry of two generals, James Wolfe from Great Britain and Louis-Joseph de Montcalm of France, who led armies which fought against each other in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham outside of  Quebec City, and who both died during the battle. It is one of very few monuments to honor both the victorious and the defeated general of the same battle.\nThe architect who designed the monument was Captain John Crawford Young (1788–), and the mason who built it was John Phillips of the 79th (Cameron) Highlanders.\nThe monument was unveiled in 1828 by Governor Dalhousie. The translation of the Latin on the monument, written by John Charlton Fisher reads \"Their courage gave them a common death, history a common fame, posterity a common memorial.\"\nThe monument was whitewashed sometime after 1987.\nJohn Crawford Young\nThe monument's architect, John Crawford Young, was a captain in the 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot in 1817. By 1833, he was a major.\nGallery\nFile:Wolfe and Montcalm Monument on Des Carrières Street, Quebec City, Quebec.jpg|An 1828 view from Rue des Carrières\nFile:Jardin des Gouverneurs, Québec vue générale vers le sud-ouest depuis la rue des Carrières 11-d.na.civile-87-3308.jpg|A view from the northeastern corner of the park in 1987, prior to the whitewashing of the monument\nReferences"
