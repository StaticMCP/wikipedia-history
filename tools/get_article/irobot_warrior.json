Able to climb steps and slopes at up to 45°, the next generation of remote control robotic vehicles is bigger, faster, and more capable than their smaller counterparts.  Initial intended uses are Explosive Ordnance Disposal, route-clearance, surveillance, enhanced security measures, scouting, reconnaissance, casualty extraction, firefighting, manipulating and welding.\niRobot has teamed up with Metal Storm to mount an electronically controlled firing system on a Warrior capable of firing up to 16 rounds per second.\nIn c. 2008, iRobot announced that it received a $3.75 million contract from Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center for research and development.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130612094001/http://www.irobot.com/us/Company/About.aspx?pageid=150 iRobot Corporation: Warrior]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612110109/http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/gi/robots/iRobot_Warrior.pdf Warrior Specifications]\n* [http://engineeringtv.com/blogs/etv/archive/2008/01/07/the-irobot-warrior.aspx The iRobot Warrior - Engineering TV]"
