It's full of obscenely fat guitar licks à la Frehley, Blackmore, Iommi (and the most perfect AC/DC break you've ever heard in the middle of 'Over the Edge'); treble-free tones; and more songs about driving and vans. It'd be stupid if it weren't so thoroughly convincing and didn't rock so unrelentingly.\" The Morning Call wrote that \"like the Ramones (and most great rock 'n' roll in general), the [monolithic] concept is based on visceral rather than cerebral response.\" The Riverfront Times deemed the album \"a happy hunting ground of beefy, bong-rattling RAWK AND ROLLLLL.\" The Chicago Tribune called it \"one bad, bone-jarring tour of the Great Riff Valley in all its arid, inhospitable majesty.\" The Windsor Star noted that \"Fu Manchu even flesh the primeval metal groove out of a new wave tune, Devo's 'Freedom of Choice', giving the song a beefy bottom end.\"\nThe Washington Post opined that \"true believers might call Fu Manchu's approach to headbanging odes of the road conceptually pure; skeptics could deem it moronic.\" The Boston Globe thought that \"guitarists [Scott] Hill and Bob Balch's aptitude for the big guitar sound popularized by Kiss and AC/DC locks into a monster rhythm section, ensuring that listeners are laughing with Fu Manchu, never at them.\" In a review of Fu Manchu's next album, California Crossing, USA Today deemed King of the Road a \"creative peak\" and \"a stoner milestone of turbo-revved guitars and West Coast slackerdom.\" The New York Times advised: \"Think Tommy Lee riffing with Jerry Garcia.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Scott Hill – vocals, guitar\n*Brant Bjork – drums\n*Bob Balch – guitar\n*Brad Davis – bass\nProduction\n*Joe Barresi – producer\nAll songs written by Bob Balch, Brant Bjork, Brad Davis and Scott Hill, except \"Freedom of Choice\": written by Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale\nAll tracks recorded, mixed and engineered at Monkey Studios, Palm Desert, CA, except \"Hell on Wheels\" mixed at Sound City Studios, Van Nuys, CA\nAssistant engineer: Steve Feldman\nMastered by Dave Collins A&M Studios, Los Angeles, CA\nLive photo: C.
