      "text": "# Persecution of Christians in the post–Cold War era\n\nThe persecution of Christians from 1989 to the present is part of a global pattern of religious persecution. In this era, the persecution of Christians takes place in Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\nThe number of anti-Christian persecutions has increased on a global scale, leading the United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to release a report which highlights this trend in 2019 stated that the number of countries where Christians face persecution for their faith rose to 144 in 2016. Data collected by the PEW organization between 2007 and 2017 showed that Christians experienced harassment in 144 countries, either by government forces or social groups. The United States compiles an annual report on religious freedom, detailing instances of persecution gathered from U.S. embassies worldwide, in collaboration with various governmental and non-governmental organizations.\nInstances of persecution occur across Africa, with countries like Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, and others experiencing varying degrees of religious intolerance and violence against Christians. The Americas, Asia, and the Middle East reported significant instances of persecution, from the destruction of Christian churches in Canada to severe restrictions and violence against Christians in countries like China, North Korea, and Pakistan.  The situation in the Middle East is difficult, with former Lebanese President Amine Gemayel stating in 2011 that Christians had become the target of genocide following deadly attacks in Egypt and Iraq.  Overall, there has been a global increase in anti-Christian persecutions, with governments and extremist groups imposing restrictions and committing acts of violence against Christians, often under the guise of law enforcement or religious purity.\nPrevalence\nA July 2019 report, in support of persecuted Christians, released by the UK's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, states that the number of countries where Christians suffer because of their faith, rose from 125 in 2015 to 144 in 2016. The review prepared by the Bishop of Truro, states that in some regions the level and nature of persecution, is arguably coming close to meeting the International definition of genocide, according to the Genocide Convention, adopted by the United Nations.\nBetween 2007 and 2017, the PEW organization found that \"Christians experienced harassment by governments or social groups in 144 countries\". The United States submits an annual report on religious freedom to Congress, also containing data on religious persecution, that it has collected from U.S. embassies around the world in collaboration with the Office of International Religious Freedom and other relevant U.S. government and non-governmental institutions. The data is listed by country and is available online.\nAmericas\nBolivia\nThe Bolivian government has been criticized for not adequately protecting the rights of religious minorities, including Christians, and for failing to prosecute those responsible for attacks. There have been incidents of property damage and theft directed towards Christian organizations and individuals. The country also has a history of religious tolerance and diversity, and many Christians live and worship freely without incident.\nCanada\nIn 2021, Christian churches in Canada were subject to numerous acts of arson and vandalism that resulted in the damage and destruction of 68 churches across the country.\nHarsha Walia, the executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, responded to reports of fires at indigenous Catholic parishes with a tweet on June30 that read \"burn it all down\". The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs expressed support for her without mentioning the controversial tweet.\nChile\nSince 2015, twelve churches have been burned in southern Chile, 10 Catholic ones and two Protestant ones. Attacks were supposedly from the Mapuche indigenous people, who are campaigning to reclaim ancestral lands, according to authorities.\nA note declaring \"We are going to burn all churches\" was found at the ruins of the Christian Union Evangelical church in Ercilla, Chile, after an arson attack on 31 March 2016.\nCuba\nIn Cuba, government regulations are aimed at curbing the growth of Christian house churches.\nMexico\nMexico is 83% Catholic, 5% Protestant, with some indigenous persons adhering to indigenous beliefs, 0.5% Jewish and an even smaller number of Muslims and others. In March, authorities in San Miguel Chiptic, Chiapas State, threatened three indigenous families for converting from Catholicism to the Seventh-day Adventist Church and did significant damage to their properties.  On 23 May, local police in San Miguel Chiptic arrested two Seventh-day Adventist men for preaching beliefs other than Catholicism. Evangelical Protestant leaders in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca said local indigenous leaders pressured them to financially support and/or participate in Catholic events, convert or return to Catholicism.  In September Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported representatives from Rancheria Yocnajab, located in the Comitan de Dominguez municipality of Chiapas, did not allow the burial of an evangelical Protestant in the community public cemetery because she had not done so. The Catholic Multimedia Center reported that unidentified individuals killed seven priests and kidnapped another.\nIn most cases, attacks on and killings of Catholic priests generally reflect criminal activity rather than religious persecution. In August, the CMC asserted that Mexico was the most violent country for priests in Latin America for the 10th year in a row. In March unidentified individuals detonated two homemade bombs in two Catholic churches in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported unidentified individuals killed four non-Catholic clergy.\nUnited States\nAfrica\nThere are 54 countries in Africa, with many, but not all, experiencing some type of religious persecution.\nAlgeria\nIn Algeria, the official religion is Sunni Islam, and \"those engaged in religious practice other than Sunni Islam, including Ahmadi Muslims, reported that they had experienced threats and intolerance. The police charged five Christians from Bouira Province with 'inciting a Muslim to change his religion' and 'performing religious worship in an unauthorized place.' In March 2018 a court in Tiaret convicted and fined two Christian brothers for carrying more than 50 Bibles in their car. In May another court convicted a church leader and another Christian of proselytizing, sentenced them to three months in prison, and fined them 100,000 dinars. Authorities closed eight churches and a nursery associated with the Protestant Church of Algeria (EPA). Media outlets reported vandalism of two Christian cemeteries\".\nAngola\nIn Angola, about two-fifths of the population is Roman Catholic, two-fifths is Protestant, and some one-tenth adheres to traditional beliefs or other religions. All religious groups are required to register with the government in order to operate legally. In October 2018, the government required all unregistered religious groups to submit registration documents, 94 submitted their files. On 6 November, the government launched a nationwide law enforcement campaign against which included closing down unlicensed associations. The operation closed more than 900 houses of worship, including eight mosques.\nBurkina Faso\nIn Burkina Faso society is religiously diverse with a 60.5% Muslim majority. A number of terrorist groups operated in the country throughout the year of 2018. In April they kidnapped a public schoolteacher in the Sahel Region, because \"French is the language of infidels and all education should be conducted in Arabic.\" In September they burned and vandalized several schools and teachers' houses in the East Region, warning against secular teaching. They kidnapped a Catholic catechist and a Christian pastor in the Sahel Region in May and June. In September unidentified individuals vandalized a Catholic church, removing the heads of religious statues in the southwest area of the country.\nBurundi\nBurundi 2018 \"laws regulating nonprofit organizations and religious denominations require them to register with the Ministry of the Interior. Religious groups that do not seek or receive registration may face scrutiny, and at times harassment or prosecution, by government officials and ruling party members\".\nCameroon\nIn Cameroon, Islam, Christianity, and Traditionalist are the three main religions. Religious groups must register with the government but the government has not allowed registrations for eight years. In 2018, religious leaders said security forces killed three clerics, interrupted church services, and prevented people from getting to their places of worship. On 18 January, soldiers reportedly burned down the presbytery of St. Paul's Catholic Church, Kwa-Kwa, Southwest Region. During the year, the government suspended church executives who had been elected by their churches and closed places of worship. Boko Haram attacked civilians, invaded churches, burned churches, killed and kidnapped both Muslims and Christians, and stole and destroyed property including private homes. Unidentified gunmen in the Southwest Region killed a local chief in a church and assassinated a priest. Separatists threatened pastors, kidnapped priests, and sometimes limited Christians' ability to attend services. There were reports that more than 90 students were kidnapped from Presbyterian schools in two incidents in October and November.\nCentral African Republic\nIn 2018, the Central African Republic is a majority Christian country that is also religiously diverse. In 2018, the government has limited control as the country is mostly controlled by the Christian anti-Balaka and the Muslim ex-Séléka militia forces who occupy territories in the western and northern parts of the country. The police and the gendarmerie (military police) failed to stop or punish killings, physical abuse, religion-based and gender-based violence committed by these militias. Sectarian clashes between the militias and the rest of the population included attacks on churches and mosques and the deaths at those places of worship.\nIn April and May, a joint government and UN operation to disarm a militia group in Bangui's predominantly Muslim PK5 neighborhood sparked violence. On 1 May, militia gunmen attacked and killed one priest, 26 worshipers, and injured more than 100 civilians. The following day, anti-Balaka elements burned two mosques in Bangui. On 15 November, a suspected ex-Seleka militia group set fire to the Catholic cathedral and an adjoining internally displaced person (IDP) camp in the city of Alindao, killing Bishop Blaise Mada and Reverend Delestin Ngouambango and more than 40 civilians.\nChad\nChad in 2018 is 51–58% Muslim, 40–45% Christian, with small populations of animists and unaffiliated individuals. During the inauguration of the new government, two Christian ministers refused to swear the required oath of office in the name of Allah; one minister who refused to take any oath in the name of Allah was immediately fired by President Idriss Déby.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is approximately 45 percent Roman Catholic, 40 percent Protestant (including evangelicals), 5 percent Church of Jesus Christ on Earth through the Prophet Simon Kimbangu (Kimbanguist), and 5 percent Muslim. International NGOs, media, and religious organizations have reported that the government subjected religious organizations and leaders, most prominently Catholic, to intimidation, arbitrary arrest, and in some cases violence. Due to the political nature of many of the Catholic Lay Association's activities and practices; however, it is difficult to establish the government's response as being solely based on religious identity.\nEgypt\nAbout 90% of Egypt's population is Muslim, predominantly Sunni, while approximately 10% are Christian, predominantly Coptic Orthodox. Although Islam is the state religion, the government officially recognizes Christianity and Judaism, permitting their followers to practice publicly. Nevertheless, religious freedom in Egypt faces significant challenges. The Egyptian government does not legally recognize conversions from Islam to Christianity, and missionary activities by foreigners are limited to social services rather than proselytizing. Historically, the community experienced significant tension during the presidency of Anwar Sadat, who internally exiled Coptic Pope Shenouda III in 1981 over accusations of stirring sectarian tensions. Shenouda was restored in 1985 by President Hosni Mubarak. Extremist Islamist groups, notably Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya, heightened violence against Christians during the 1980s and 1990s, often with accusations of police complicity.\nFollowing the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, anti-Christian sentiment increased notably amid the unrest. Incidents included church burnings, violence over the appointment of a Christian governor, and inflammatory anti-Christian rhetoric by Islamist groups. The European Parliament criticized Egypt in 2011 for persecuting Christians, and by mid-2012, around 10,000 Christians had emigrated. Violence escalated again in July 2012, when Dahshur's entire Christian community fled following sectarian clashes after a minor dispute spiraled into riots, resulting in destruction of property and violence against Christians.\nKidnappings for ransom of Christians became widespread after the revolution, particularly in Minya, with over 150 cases reported between 2011 and 2013. Tensions have persisted over church construction, despite legal permissions being available; attempts to build or renovate churches frequently provoke hostility and sometimes violent attacks from local Muslim communities.\nEgypt's laws on contempt of religion have also been controversial. In 2016, poet Fatima Naoot received a three-year sentence for a Facebook post criticizing animal slaughter during Eid. In the same year, four Christian teenagers were convicted under the same laws for reportedly mocking Islam, with three sentenced to five years imprisonment.\nNonetheless, recent years have shown signs of progress in certain areas. Christians have reported greater freedom to construct and renovate churches, and new initiatives, such as interreligious reconciliation efforts and protective fatwas, have emerged. Egypt's position on Open Doors' World Watch List, which ranks the 50 countries where Christians face the most persecution, fell from 25th in 2013 to 40th by 2025, indicating a measurable decline in reported persecution. However, social discrimination and underrepresentation in public institutions continue to affect the community.\nEritrea\nThe population of Eritrea is equally divided between the predominantly Christian high plateau (Asmara), and the Muslim lowlands and coast. The government recognizes four officially registered religious groups: the Eritrean Orthodox Church, Sunni Islam, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea. Unregistered groups can be subjected to additional security service scrutiny. The government appoints the heads of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and the Sunni Islamic community. International NGOs and media reported that members of all religious groups were subjected to government abuses and restrictions. Members of unrecognized religious groups reported instances of imprisonment and deaths in custody, and detention without explanation. NGOs reported the government continued to detain 345 church leaders and officials without charge or trial, while estimates of detained laity ranged from 800 to more than 1,000. Authorities detained 53 Jehovah's Witnesses for conscientious objection.\nEthiopia\nEthiopia has 43.5% Ethiopian Orthodox Christians, 33.9% Muslim, 18.6%, Protestants, and 2.6% traditional beliefs population. There is also a small Jewish community and some adherents of the Baháʼí Faith. In January 2018, security forces fired tear-gas on a group of youth singing politically charged messages in Woldia town during Epiphany celebrations. The local Human Rights Council (HRCO) reported that security forces shot and killed eight Orthodox Church members; this was followed by further protests and more killings. On 4 August, in the Somali region, an organized group of Muslim youth reportedly killed six priests and burned down at least eight Ethiopian Orthodox churches during widespread civil unrest in Jijiga. On 25 August, in Bure town, followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church stoned a man to death after accusing him of attempting to set a church on fire.\nKenya\nKenya in 2018 is religiously diverse: 47.4% of the total population are varieties of Protestant, 20.6% are Roman Catholic, 11.1 percent are Islamic, and 16% are Baháʼí, Buddhist, Hindu and traditional religionists. Kenya also has the highest number of Quakers of any country in the world, with around 119,285 members. The Eastern Orthodox Church has over 650,000 members making it the third largest Orthodox Church in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Somalia-based terrorist group Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (al-Shabaab) carried out attacks in Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, and Lamu Counties saying they had targeted non-Muslims. In September, al-Shabaab reportedly stopped a bus in Lamu County and killed two Christian travelers. In October a group of residents in Bungale, Magarini Sub County, burned and demolished a Good News International Ministries church. There were reports of religiously motivated threats, such as members of Muslim communities threatening individuals who converted from Islam to Christianity. According to religious leaders, some Muslim youths vandalized properties of local Christians.\nLibya\nSunni Islam is the state religion and sharia is the principal source of legislation. Non-Muslim activity remains curtailed by legal prohibitions. Circulation of non-Islamic religious materials, missionary activity, or speech considered \"offensive to Muslims\" is prohibited. Multiple international human rights organizations said Christians faced a heightened risk of physical assault, including sexual assault and rape than other migrants and refugees at government detention centers. Some detainees reported they were tortured and abused. Domestic human rights activists continued to report a restrictive environment, especially toward women, imposing restrictions on women's dress and movement and punishing men for behavior they deemed un-Islamic. The East operated under a separate, unrecognized governmental administration, with security provided by the Libyan National Army (LNA) and LNA-aligned Salafist armed groups. Militias continued to operate and control territory throughout the country, including in Benghazi, parts of Tripoli, and Derna, where there were numerous reports of armed groups restricting religious practices, enforcing compliance with sharia, and targeting those viewed as violating their standards. According to Open Doors USA, Islamic militant groups and organized crime groups targeted religious minorities, including Christian migrants, converts to Christianity, and foreign residents for physical attacks, sexual assaults, detentions, kidnappings, and killings. Foreign terrorist organizations that included Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM), and ISIS continued to operate within the country. In December the Reuters news service reported local authorities said they had exhumed from a mass grave near Sirte the bodies of 34 Ethiopian Christians executed by ISIS in 2015. According to international media, former Muslims faced intense social and economic pressure to renounce their Christian faith and return to Islam.\nSouth Africa\nIn April 2025, American missionary Josh Sullivan was abducted at gunpoint during a church service in Motherwell, a township near Gqeberha in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. Sullivan, who had been working in the region since 2018 as a church-planting missionary to Xhosa-speaking communities, was taken by at least four armed men, prompting a ransom demand. Following a coordinated response by South Africa's elite police unit, the Hawks, he was rescued unharmed on 15 April during a shoot-out in KwaMagxaki that resulted in the deaths of three suspects. The incident highlighted a broader trend of increased kidnappings for ransom in South Africa in the 2010s and 2020s. Sullivan's case drew international attention and sparked widespread calls for prayer and support from faith communities in both South Africa and the United States.\nSomalia\nChristians in Somalia face persecution associated with the ongoing civil war in that country.\nIn September 2011 militants sworn to eradicate Christianity from Somalia beheaded two Christian converts. A third Christian convert was beheaded in Mogadishu in early 2012.\nSudan\nSome interpretations of Muslim law in Sudan refuse to recognize conversions out of Islam, considering apostasy a crime, and refuse to recognize marriages to non-Muslims. Sudan is one of the nations where being a Christian is hardest in the world. Freedom of religion and belief are systematically violated.\nAsia\nAfghanistan\nIn Afghanistan in 2006, Abdul Rahman, a 41-year-old citizen, was charged with rejecting Islam because he converted to Catholicism, a crime which is punishable by death under Sharia law. Under intense pressure from Western governments, he was allowed to leave Afghanistan at the end of March 2006 and since then, he has been living in exile in Italy.\nIn 2008, the Taliban killed a British charity worker, Gayle Williams, \"because she was working for an organization which was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan\" even though she was extremely careful and she did not try to convert Afghans to Christianity.\nChina\nIn the Xi Jinping era, some estimates put the number of Christians in China at 100 million, but it has been claimed in 2019 that 20 million of them faced persecution, including crackdowns, raids and church closures. Claims of persecution of Chinese Christians occurred in both official and unsanctioned churches.\nIndia\nThere have been instances of religious intolerance and persecution of Christians in India, particularly in certain areas of the country. In recent years, there have been reports of violence and discrimination against Christians, as well as forced conversions, mainly by Hindu nationalist groups. The Indian government has been criticized by some international human rights organizations and religious groups for not doing enough to protect the rights of religious minorities, including Christians.\nIndonesia\nIndonesia is the world's largest Muslim-majority country, and while the constitution guarantees freedom of religion, there have been instances of religious intolerance and persecution of religious minorities, including Christians. In some areas of the country, particularly in more conservative regions, local laws and regulations have been used to restrict the religious freedom of minority groups. Additionally, there have been incidents of violence and intimidation directed at religious minorities, including Christians, by extremist groups. However, the overall situation varies widely across the country, with some areas being relatively peaceful while others experience significant religious tension.\nMalaysia\nIn Malaysia, although Islam is the official religion, Christianity is tolerated under Article 3 and Article 11 of the Malaysian constitution. But at some point, the spread of Christianity is a particular sore point for the Muslim majority, the Malaysian government has also persecuted Christian groups who were perceived to be attempting to proselytize Muslim audiences. Those showing interest in the Christian faith or other faith practices not considered orthodox by state religious authorities are usually sent either by the police or their family members to state funded Faith Rehabilitation Centres () where they are counseled to remain faithful to Islam and some states have provisions for penalties under their respective Shariah legislations for apostasy from Islam.\nIt has been the practice of the church in Malaysia to not actively proselytize to the Muslim community. Christian literature is required by law to carry a caption \"for non-Muslims only\". Article 11(4) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia allows the states to prohibit the propagation of other religions to Muslims, and most (with the exception of Penang, Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territories) have done so. There is no well-researched agreement on the actual number of Malaysian Muslim converts to Christianity in Malaysia. According to the latest population census released by the Malaysian Statistics Department, there are none, according to Ustaz Ridhuan Tee, they are 135 and according to Tan Sri Dr Harussani Zakaria, they are 260,000. See also Status of religious freedom in Malaysia.\nThere are, however, cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith without declaring apostasy openly. In effect, they are practicing Christians, but legally Muslims.\nNorth Korea\nThe government of North Korea is officially atheist, and any religious practices are strictly controlled and heavily monitored by the state. Those who are found to be practicing Christianity or any other religion can face severe punishment, including imprisonment, torture, and execution. The government also actively seeks to root out and punish individuals who are suspected of being involved in underground Christian activities. The country is considered as one of the worst places in the world for religious freedom by several human rights and Christian organizations.\nPakistan\nChristians in Pakistan are a minority, making up 1.6% of the population, and religious minorities are frequently discriminated against. The Pakistan blasphemy law mandates that blasphemy of the Qur'an is to be punished. Critics of the laws say that Christians like Asia Bibi are sentenced to death with only hearsay for evidence of alleged blasphemy. At least a dozen Christians have been given death sentences, and half a dozen of them have been murdered after being accused of violating blasphemy laws. In 2005, 80 Christians were behind bars due to these laws.\nChristians in Pakistan have been murdered in outbreaks of communal violence, such as the 2009 Gojra riots, and they have been targeted by militant groups, with the Peshawar church attack killing 75 Christians in Peshawar in 2013, and the Lahore church bombings killing 15 Christians in 2015. The campaign of violence by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan has been described as a genocide.\nSri Lanka\nChristians in Sri Lanka are a minority, making up around 7.4% of the population as of the 2011 census. The Christian population faces sporadic outbreaks of violence and hostility by extremists. Churches have been vandalized by mobs organized by supporters of religious nationalist groups, such as Hindu supporters of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Buddhist supporters of Bodu Bala Sena and Islamist supporters of National Thowheeth Jama'ath.\nMiddle East\nIraq and Syria\nThe consolidation of power in the hands of Shia Islamists in Iraq since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime has been detrimental to Iraq's Assyrian and Armenian Christian communities. Friction between rival sects in Iraq has frequently resulted in acts of violence against Christians in the country. Consequently, Christians have fled from some areas of Iraq and emigrated to Europe and the United States. Since 2003, hundreds of thousands of Christians have fled from Iraq, and as a result, the Christian population, which may have numbered as high as 1.4&nbsp;million prior to the Iraq War, has dropped to 500,000, and the number of Christians who are currently living in Iraq is continuing to decline. Between 2003 and 2012, more than 70 churches were bombed. In 2007, Al Qaeda militants killed a young priest in Mosul, and in 2010, gunmen massacred 53 Assyrian Christians in a Baghdad church.\nDuring the Syrian Civil War and its spillover into Iraq, the persecution of Christians by ISIL and other militant groups has been ongoing. The Fall of Mosul and the fall of the Assyrian town of Qaraqosh during the 2014 ISIL advance in Iraq caused the displacement of an estimated 100,000 Assyrian Christian civilians. After the fall of Mosul, ISIL decreed that if the Assyrian Christians who lived in the city did not convert to Islam or pay tribute, they would be executed. ISIL begun marking homes of Christian residents with the letter nūn for  ('Christian'). Thousands of Christians, Yazidis (the latter were only given the choice of conversion or death) and other, mostly Shi'a Muslims (who ISIL considers apostates) have abandoned their homes and land. One of the cultural heritage sites which was destroyed by ISIL was Mosque of the Prophet Jonah, a site which is considered holy by adherents of all Abrahamic faiths.\nIsrael and Palestine\nGreen Line Israel\nIn Tel Aviv in 2008, three teenagers burned hundreds of Christian Bibles. In a 2008 Tel Aviv incident, hundreds of copies of the New Testament, which had been handed out in the city (allegedly by Messianic Jews in order to convert Ethiopian Jews), were burned by three teenage Orthodox students of Judaism. Uzi Aharon, the town's deputy mayor, told CNN he had collected the New Testaments but that he did not plan for them to be burned. The youths had done so while he was not present. Once he found out that the fire was going, he put it out.\nIn Jerusalem, there have been instances of Christian churches and monasteries being vandalized with spray-painted offensive remarks against Christianity, including death threats. These are believed to be price tag attacks by extremist settlers.\nA number of Ultra-Orthodox/Haredi youth have reportedly spat at Christian clergymen. Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, of Jerusalem's Armenian Patriarchate, says he personally has been spat at about 50 times in the past 12 years. The Anti-Defamation League has called on the chief Rabbis to speak out against the interfaith assaults. Father Goosan, Chief Dragoman of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, stated that, \"I know there are fanatical Haredi groups that don't represent the general public but it's still enraging. It all begins with education. It's the responsibility of these men's yeshiva heads to teach them not to behave this way\".\nIn July 2012, a former member of the Knesset, Michael Ben-Ari, who supports Kahanism, videotaped himself tearing up a copy of the New Testament and throwing it in the trash. Ben-Ari referred to it as a \"despicable book\" that should be \"in the dustbin of history\". In response, the American Jewish Committee urged the Knesset to censure Ben-Ari, while a spokesman for Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned Ben-Ari's actions.\nIn June 2015, an auxiliary building of the Church of the Multiplication was significantly damaged by an arson attack and its walls defaced by Hebrew graffiti, bearing the words \"the false gods will be eliminated\" (quoted from the Aleinu prayer).\nFrom 2018 to 2023, a total of 157 attacks on Christian sanctities in Israel by extremist Jews were documented.\nIn March 2023, Member of the Knesset Moshe Gafni submitted a bill that would have banned proselytizing of Christianity in Israel.\nIn June and July 2023, Jewish extremists repeatedly stormed a Catholic church and monastery in Haifa, leading to protests by the local Christians and clashes at the site between them and the extremists.\nJerusalem\nArmenians in Jerusalem, identified as Palestinian Christians or Israeli-Armenians, have also been attacked and received threats from Jewish extremists; Christians and clergy have been spat at, and one Armenian Archbishop was beaten and his centuries-old cross broken. In September 2009, two Armenian Christian clergy were expelled after a brawl erupted with a Jewish extremist for spitting on holy Christian objects.\nIn January 2010, Christian leaders, Israeli Foreign ministry staff, representatives of the Jerusalem municipality and the Haredi community met to discuss inter-faith tolerance. The Haredi Community Tribunal of Justice published a statement condemning harassment of Christians, stating that it was a \"desecration of God's name\". Several events were planned in 2010 by the Orthodox Yedidya congregation to show solidarity with Christians and improve relations between the Haredi and Christian communities of Jerusalem.\nWest Bank\n. The text says \"Death to Arabs\" in Hebrew.]]\nIn May 2023, a few months before the Gaza genocide, a report titled \"Palestinian Christians - The Forcible Displacement and Dispossession Continues\" was released by Kairos Palestine, a Palestinian Christian advocacy group, based in the West Bank.\nIn 2002, a mob of Palestinian Muslims burned Christian property in Ramallah. A dossier submitted in 2005 to Church leaders in Jerusalem listed 93 incidents of abuse alleged to have been committed against Palestinian Christians by Muslim extremists and 140 cases of gangs allegedly stealing Christian land in the West Bank.\nIn September 2005, hundreds of Muslim men from Deir Jarir torched homes in Taybeh in response to an affair between a 30-year-old Muslim woman from Deir Jarir said to have been romantically involved with a Christian man from Taybeh. Taybeh residents called the authorities to intervene, the Israelis arrived first but they watched and did not intervene. Palestinian policemen arriving from Ramallah were held at an Israeli checkpoint for three hours, and were only allowed to pass after constant calls from the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem. Despite the incident, the neighboring towns continue to have healthy relations; residents say \"the people of Taybeh and the people of Deir Jarir are one family\".\nIn May 2012 a group of 100 Muslims attacked Taybeh, a Christian village in the West Bank.\nOn 19 April 2013, Israeli settlers attempted to take over Taybeh's monastery and its adjacent chapel. Both before and during the 2023 Gaza war, Israeli settlers conducted violent attacks and arson in Taybeh.\nOn Christmas Day in 2023, Israel raided Bethlehem, where many Palestinian Christians live. In 2006, a Zogby poll that interviewed more than 1,000 Palestinian Christians from Bethlehem found that 79% of the respondents cited the Israeli occupation as source of difficulties leading the emigration of their community.\nGaza Strip\nThe Hamas overthrow of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza in 2007 was accompanied by violent attacks against Christians and Christian holy sites by Islamic militants. A Catholic convent and Rosary Sisters school were ransacked, with some Christians blaming Hamas for the attack. In September 2007 Christian anxiety grew after an 80-year-old Christian woman was attacked in her Gaza home by a masked man who robbed her and called her an kafir. The library of YMCA was bombed in 2008 by gunmen who, according to guards at the site, asked why the guards worked for \"infidels\".\nGazan Salafi jihadist militant groups are opposed to Christianity and have attacked Christian targets. In 2007, Jaish al Mu'minun carried out the murder of Rami Ayyad, an affiliate of the Gaza Baptist Church who managed the only Christian bookstore in the Gaza Strip. Other Salafi jihadist groups that have attacked Gazan Christians include Jaysh al-Islam and Tawhid al-Jihad.\nIn 2011, some Gazan Christians interviewed by The Guardian reported an anti-Christian atmosphere in Gaza. Reportedly, people were not celebrating Christmas out of fear; young Christian men were emigrating en masse; a Hamas official had detained and threatened a Christian wearing a cross necklace; and many Christians wanted the Palestinian Authority to retake Gaza.\nIn 2012, tensions arose between Gazan Christians and Hamas after it was alleged that five Christians had been kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam. The Muslim Scholars’ Association in Palestine, Hamas, and the converts themselves stated they had not been kidnapped or forcibly converted to Islam, but Gazan Christians remained skeptical, and began organizing near-daily protest rallies in Gaza City. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights met with and interviewed the converts, and concluded that they had converted out of their own free will.\nAll three churches in Gaza have been subjected to attacks by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the Gaza war, and around 3% of Gazan Christians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes or shootings. The Gaza Baptist Church was heavily damaged sometime in 2023. In December 2023, two Gazan Christians, Naheda Anton and her daughter Samar Anton were shot and killed at the Holy Family Church by an Israeli sniper, and the church itself was targeted by tank fire in July 2025. The Rosary Sisters' school was bombed in November 2023, and the Holy Family Catholic school was bombed in July 2024.
