Co-founded by Chinedu Okeke and Oriteme Banigo, it was created in response to a demand from the local youth culture for live, affordable, and accessible entertainment in Africa. The festival provides a venue for live bands, DJs, and musical acts to perform. It also features outdoor activities, local vendors, and artisans. The main show features a line-up of African acts from numerous countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Congo, Kenya, and the United Kingdom. The goal of the festival is to encourage the development of African talent and promote artists both within the continent and into overseas markets.\nHistory\nThe Gidi Culture Festival is produced by Eclipse Live Production. It was inspired by the now defunct Lekki Sound Splash, a festival once headlined by Fela Kuti. Co-founded by Chinedu Okeke and  Oriteme Banigo, the festival's main aim is to create a safe space for the youth that would enable and empower them. The festival has been noted for its novel ideas about giving back to the community. Its Beach Sweeps and Dreams Project are exchange programs that create opportunities for young people to work in a variety of different creative industries. In addition to the Gidi Culture Festival, Eclipse Live Production produces Nigeria's Palmwine Music Fest and Nativeland. In an interview with IQ magazine in 2018, Okeke said the Gidi Culture Festival is yet to break even, although he is optimistic that it will do so in a couple of years.\n2014: Inaugural edition\nThe inaugural edition of the festival featured performances from Ice Prince, Phyno, Naeto C, Chidinma, Dammy Krane, Blink, Poe, Boj, Teezee, Ayo Jay, Emma Nyra, Patoranking, Lynxx, Jesse Jagz, Oritse Femi, Orezi, Reminisce, Efya, DJ Obi, DJ Caise, DJ Hazan, DJ Cuppy, DJ Kaywise, Falz, Pucado, Yung L, and Endia.\n2015: Second edition\nThe second edition of the festival was held on April 4, 2015, at Eko Atlantic in Lagos.
