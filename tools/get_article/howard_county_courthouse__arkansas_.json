It is a two-story brick building in the shape of an H, built in 1939 with funding from the Public Works Administration.  It is Moderne in style, designed by the Little Rock firm Erhart & Eichenbaum.  The front facade, facing east, has a central entrance framed in black marble, an element repeated on the secondary entrances on the north and south facades.  The interior hallways are covered in expanses of tile in earth tones, and the Art Deco woodwork in the courtrooms is original to the period.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Howard County, Arkansas\nReferences"
