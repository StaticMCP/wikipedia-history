The station is beneath King George Square and serves the Brisbane central business district. The station has six stops on two platforms; access to these platforms is via an underground concourse which can be accessed from Ann Street or Adelaide Street. Passengers wait behind automatic doors on the stop that is assigned to their bus. The station opened on 19 May 2008.\nHistory\nConstruction of the King George Square busway station was announced in March 2005. Construction commenced in early 2006 and the station opened on 19 May 2008 when the Northern Busway was extended from Normanby. The lower two levels of the King George Square Car Park were demolished to make way for the station. The heritage-listed Wheat Creek Culvert (built in 1861) which ran from under King George Square out into Adelaide Street was also demolished. A short segment of the culvert has been preserved as a display in the bus station.\nA bus tunnel had been constructed under Albert Street to link the station with Queen Street bus station. The bus tunnel replaced one of the tunnel exit ramps to the Queen Street bus station on Albert Street (see photo below). As part of construction, the space in Albert Street above the new tunnel has been converted into a pedestrian mall, extending the Queen Street Mall.\nIn conjunction with the building of the station, there was a national design competition for the redevelopment of King George Square. The winning entry was entitled A Space in Transition by UrbisJHD. Construction of the Square was completed in October 2009. The re-design of the square and its busway entrances attracted criticism from professional urban designers and the public.\nWhen the station originally opened, it included a Transport Information Centre at the Ann Street entrance, this however was closed on 29 September 2012.\nThe station was renamed \"City Hall / King George Square\" on 28 January 2025, ahead of an eventual renaming to \"City Hall\". This renaming better reflects the neighbouring City Hall, and aligns with other major Australian cities' naming conventions.\nBetween 2021 and 2025, a new tunnel was dug between the busway station and Victoria Bridge for the Brisbane Metro project. The new tunnel opened on 29 September 2025.\nServices\nThe station is served by seven routes, operated by Transport for Brisbane as part of the Translink network. Brisbane Metro routes M1 and M2, some BUZ routes and a CityGilder route pass through the station, providing convenient transfer to and from other services.\nPlatform 1\n| notes = BUZ service\n}}\n| notes = BUZ service\n}}\n| notes = BUZ service\n}}\n| notes = BUZ service\n}}\n| notes = Brisbane Metro service\n}}\n| notes = Brisbane Metro service\n}}\nPlatform 2\n| notes = BUZ service\n}}\nFacilities\nKing George Square busway station has 12 stops on two platforms (6 stops each labelled 1A-1C and 2A-2C).
