It currently elects four councillors.\nIt was created in 2007 as Abronhill, Kildrum and the Village, covering those neighbourhoods within the town of Cumbernauld: Abronhill, Kildrum and The Village, returning three members. A 2017 boundary change led to the name being altered to a more general geographic description due to the town centre commercial area and the Seafar neighbourhood (excepting the McGregor Road area) being added, the electorate increasing sufficiently to return an additional councillor. In 2019, the ward had a population of 16,570.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Elizabeth Irvine(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Stevie Grant(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Tom Johnston(SNP)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Claire Barclay(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Gillian Fannan(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Partick Hogg(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Barry McCulloch(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Adam Smith(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2017 Election\n|numcounts= 8\n}}\n*On 19 June 2018, SNP Councillor Paddy Hogg of resigned from the party, describing the SNP group as 'toxic'; he thereafter sat as an Independent.\n2012 Election\n2007 Election\nReferences"
