This branch of physics focuses on understanding and studying the physical properties and transitions between phases of matter. Condensed matter refers to materials where particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are closely packed together or under interaction, such as solids and liquids. This field explores a wide range of phenomena, including the electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties of matter.\nThis timeline includes developments in subfields of condensed matter physics such as theoretical crystallography, solid-state physics, soft matter physics, mesoscopic physics, material physics, low-temperature physics, microscopic theories of magnetism in matter and optical properties of matter and metamaterials.\nEven if material properties were modeled before 1900, condensed matter topics were considered as part of physics since the development of quantum mechanics and microscopic theories of matter. According to Philip W. Anderson, the term \"condensed matter\" appeared about 1965.\nFor history of fluid mechanics, see timeline of fluid and continuum mechanics.\nBefore quantum mechanics\nPrehistory\n* 28,000–12,000 BP – Upper Paleolithic: earliest evidence of ceramic objects made for ritual purposes.\n* 10,000–3300 BC – Neolithic: development of pottery, as well as early evidence of glass production and metalworking.\n* 3300–1200 BC – Bronze Age: development of metallurgy, with copper and tin being combined to create bronze.\n* 1200–300 BC – Iron Age: development of ferrous metallurgy, allowing iron and steel to largely replace bronze.\nAntiquity\nwith permanent magnetic properties were noticed already in Ancient Greece]]\n* 8th century BC: first writings on the magnetic properties of lodestone in Ancient Greece.\n* 6th century BC – Thales of Miletus observes that rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber, would cause an attraction between the two, which is now known to be caused by static electricity.\n* 5th century BC – Leucippus and Democritus postulate the philosophy of atomism.\n* 4th century BC – Aristotle describes the composition of matter in terms of the four classical elements, founding Aristotelian physics.\n* 1st century AD – Pliny the Elder in his Natural History records the story of Magnes the shepherd who discovered the magnetic properties of some iron stones.\n* 160 AD – Claudius Ptolemy writes his book Optics on reflection and refraction of light, and tabulated angles of refraction for several media.
