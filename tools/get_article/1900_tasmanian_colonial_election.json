Following this term, the system largely returned to its pre–1897 state (all members elected through first past the post), but at the 1909 election, the entire State was redivided into five electorates using the Hare-Clark system.\nResults\n1\n|party2=Protectionist\n|votes2=2218\n|sw2=\n|seats2=9\n|sc2= 3\n|party3=Others\n|votes3=7319\n|sw3=\n|seats3=0\n|sc3= 1\n|party4=Independents\n|votes4=4201\n|sw4=\n|seats4=11\n|sc4= 6\n}}\n|22.26}}\n}}\n|28.95}}\n}}\nSee also\n*Members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, 1900–1903\nReferences"
