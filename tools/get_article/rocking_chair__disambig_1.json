The rockers contact the floor at only two points, giving the occupant the ability to rock back and forth by shifting their weight or pushing lightly with their feet. Rocking chairs are most commonly made of wood. Some rocking chairs can fold.\nEtymology\nThe word rocking chair comes from the verb to rock. The first known use of the term rocking chair was in 1766.\nPurpose\npainter and furniture designer, Karin Larsson]]\nRocking chairs are often seen as evocative of parenting — as the gentle rocking motion soothes infants and sends them off to sleep.\nMany adults find rocking chairs soothing because of the gentle motion. Gentle rocking motion has been shown to provide faster onset of sleep than remaining stationary, mimicking the process of a parent rocking a child to sleep.\nRocking chairs are also comfortable because, when a user sits in one without rocking, the chair automatically rocks backward until the sitter's center of gravity is met, thus granting an ergonomic benefit with the occupant kept at an un-stressed position and angle. Rockers are also good to use during pregnancy as it reduces back pain and promotes relaxation and stress reduction.\nVarieties of rockers include those mounted on a spring base (or platform) called \"platform rockers\" and those with swinging braces commonly known as gliders.\nHistory\nlounging in a rocking chair while reading]]\n: Aunt Karen in the Rocking Chair, 1883]]\nRocking cradles long predate rocking chairs and an example exists from antiquity, found in the ruins of Herculaneum.\nOriginally used in gardens, rocking chairs were simply ordinary chairs with rockers attached. In 1725, early rocking chairs first appeared in England. Though American inventor Benjamin Franklin is sometimes credited with inventing the rocking chair, historians actually trace the rocking chair's origins to North America during the early 18th century, when Franklin was a child. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century. These wicker rockers, as they were popularly known, were famous for their craftsmanship and creative designs.\nDuring the 1830s, Peter Cooper designed the first steel chair in America which was a rocking chair, and was displayed at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851.\nMichael Thonet, a German craftsman, created the first bentwood rocking chair in 1860. This design is distinguished by its graceful shape and its light weight. These rocking chairs were influenced by Greek and Roman designs as well as Renaissance and colonial era artistry.\nDuring the 1920s, however, folding rocking chairs became more popular in the United States and in Europe. They were handy for outdoor activities and travel purposes. By the 1950s, rocking chairs built by Sam Maloof, an American craftsman, became famous for their durability and deluxe appearance. Maloof's rocking chairs are distinguished by their ski-shaped rockers.\nTypes of rocking chair\nPeter Cooper\nPeter Cooper, an American industrialist and inventor, designed an iron-frame chair with a functional, minimalist design radically different from Victorian heavily decorated, ostentatious designs. At that time most rocking chairs had separate rockers fixed to regular chair legs, Cooper's chair used the curve of its frame to ensure the rocking motion. Coopers chair was made of steel or wrought iron with upholstery slung across the frame. Cooper's model was manufactured at R.W. Winfield & Co. in Britain. The firm exhibited examples of the chair at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations (Crystal Palace Exhibition) in 1851 and the Great London Exposition of 1862.\nBentwood\nMichael Thonet received a patent in 1856 for the process of bentwood manufacturing, when he and his five sons began to produce innovative ‘bentwood’ furniture.\nBoston\nActually made in Connecticut, Boston rockers were traditionally made of oak and pine, painted black, and embellished with fruit and flower designs.\nFolding\nFolding rocking chairs were popular starting in the 1870s. They come in a variety of styles, but are recognized by backs designed to fold down to the seat.\nWicker\nWicker rocking chairs were machine-manufactured rocker armchairs from the early 20th century. These were usually part of a sun parlor set, which included a sofa, side chairs, a table, a planter, and a floor lamp.\nPressed back\nThe pressed back rocking chair was part of the American colony revival style that lasted from about 1870-1920. It has a raised design of the wood on the back.\nLadder back\nThe ladder back rocking chair has a tall back with horizontal slats.\nSee also\n*Bassinet, another rocking piece of furniture\n*Glider (furniture), a chair that rocks via suspension from a four-bar linkage\n*\"Rockin' Chair\" (song) by Hoagy Carmichael\n*Swing (seat), the rocking movement comes from suspension\nReferences\nExternal links"
