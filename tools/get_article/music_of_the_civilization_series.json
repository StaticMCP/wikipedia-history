Most of original tunes were composed by Jeff Briggs, while others were taken from traditional or classic compositions, referring to each national culture (civilization) represented in the game. The same music used for the Aztecs was also applied to the Barbarians whenever they invaded a city.\n*Romans – \"Augustus Rises\" (original)\n*Babylonians – \"''Hammurabi's Code\" (original)\n*Germans – DOS version: \"Variatio 4: Lo stesso movimento\" from Goldberg Variations (Johann Sebastian Bach); Amiga version: \"Rondo alla Turca\" (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)\n*Egyptians – \"Harvest Of the Nile\" (original)\n*Americans – \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\"\n*Greek – \"Aristotle's Pupil\" (original)\n*Mongols – \"Mongol Horde\" (original)\n*Russians – \"Song of the Volga Boatmen\" (traditional)\n*Zulus – (original)\n*French – \"La Marseillaise\"\n*Aztecs – \"Tenochtitlan Revealed\" (original)\n*Chinese – \"The Shining Path\" (traditional)\n*English – \"Rondeau\" from Symphonies and Fanfares for the King's Supper (Jean-Joseph Mouret)\n*Indians – \"Gautama Ponders\" (original)\nBesides the main theme, sometimes known as \"Civilization Opening Theme\", other tunes used in the game were Ode to Joy'' from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in the \"leader's day\" celebration in cities, as well as the Funeral March from Beethoven's Third Symphony.\nCivilization Jukebox\nMicroprose created a DOS application called '[https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/the-civilization-jukebox.684866/ Civilization Jukebox]' as a way to listen to Civilization MIDI files directly outside of game play.  It is compatible with Adlib, Tandy or Roland MT32 sound cards, along with PC Speaker.  It includes a menu system to select tracks.\nCivilization II\nCivilization IIs music is in the Red Book CD-audio format, the same as that found on normal music CDs. The songs are quite varied; some are from the 19th century classical era, such as the Blue Danube Waltz, while others have a tribal, tropical sound to them. The music can be played back through any CD-ROM drive. Over 200 MB of space on the Civilization II CD is taken up by the music, 280 MB is occupied by the videos (many of them are historical footages), whereas the actual program data takes up less than 30 MB.\nThe five different releases of Civilization II have added and subtracted tracks from the mix, with Fantastic Worlds containing the largest number of tracks of all releases.\nWonders of the World Music\nWhenever a player builds a Wonder of the World, a short video with music is played. The music is often taken from other sources:\n* King Richard's Crusade – Dance of the Furies, Christoph Willibald Gluck\n* Leonardo's Workshop – Cantaloupe Island, Herbie Hancock\n* Michelangelo's Chapel – Credo from Missa Papae Marcelli, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina\n* J.S. Bach's Cathedral – Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Johann Sebastian Bach\n* Shakespeare's Theatre – taken from the prologue to Henry V\n* Statue of Liberty – El Capitan March, John Philip Sousa\n* Isaac Newton's College – Concerto For 4 Violins & Strings in B minor, Antonio Vivaldi\n* Adam Smith's Trading Company – The Entrance of the Queen of Sheba from the oratorio Solomon, George Frideric Handel\nMost videos, however, feature original compositions with often discernible inspiration,[http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=512 Wonder Music Revealed - Civilization Fanatics' Forums] either from Peter Gabriel's soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ:\n* Pyramids – \"The Feeling Begins\"\n* Great Wall of China – \"Gethsemane\"\n* Sun Tzu's War Academy – \"Gethsemane\"\nTrevor Jones' and Randy Edelman's soundtrack to The Last of the Mohicans (1992):\n* Colossus – main title\n* Great Lighthouse – \"Elk Hunt\"\n* Marco Polo's Embassy – \"Promontory\"\n* Magellan's Expedition – \"Fort Battle\"\n* United Nations – \"The Glade\"\nOr various other sources:\n* Oracle – ''Theme from Harry's Game'' by Clannad\n* Women's Suffrage – Swinging at the Daisy Chain by the Count Basie Orchestra\n* Hoover Dam – a remix version of \"Arkham Bridge\" from the soundtrack of the PC game Mechwarrior 2 Ghost Bears Legacy by Gregory Alper & Jeehun Hwang.\n* Manhattan Project – I Had My Chance by Morphine\n* Apollo Program – Telegraph Road by Dire Straits\nCivilization III\nCivilization III is a 2001 strategy game from Firaxis Games. As the game progresses, the music changes to reflect the era. There are five different mixes that represent the five major cultural groupings of the Civs in the game (European, North American, Middle Eastern, Greco-Roman, and Asian).\nDuring diplomatic negotiations with leaders of other civilizations, there are both aggressive and passive tracks for each culture grouping that play depending on the mood of the civilization the player negotiates with. All the music in the game is stored in MP3 format.\nRoger Briggs and Mark Cromer are credited with the game's music.\nAmbient Music\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!Era\n!Culture grouping\n!Track\n!Other Information\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Ancient\n|European/Celtic\n|AncECFull\n|\n|-\n|Greco-Roman\n|AncGRFull\n|Based on First Delphic Hymn\n|-\n|Middle Eastern/African\n|AncMEFull\n|\n|-\n|North American\n|AncNAFull\n|\n|-\n|Asian/Oriental\n|AncORFull\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Middle Ages\n|European/Celtic\n|MidECFull\n|\n|-\n|Greco-Roman\n|MidGRFull\n|\n|-\n|Middle Eastern/African\n|MidMEFull\n|\n|-\n|North American\n|MidNAFull\n|\n|-\n|Asian/Oriental\n|MidORFull\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Industrial\n|European/Celtic\n|IndECFull\n|\n|-\n|Greco-Roman\n|IndGRFull\n|Joseph Haydn's Piano Sonata No. 49, Finale\n|-\n|Middle Eastern/African\n|IndMEFull\n|\n|-\n|North American\n|N/A\n|\n|-\n|Asian/Oriental\n|IndORFull\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Modern\n| rowspan=\"4\" |All\n|SmashFull\n|\n|-\n|StarsFull\n|\n|-\n|Techno MixFull\n|\n|-\n|ModernFull\n|Added in Conquests expansion\n|}\nDiplomacy Music\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!Era\n!Culture grouping\n!Track\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Ancient/Middle Ages\n| rowspan=\"2\" |European\n|DipECEarlyPeace\n|-\n|DipECEarlyWar\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Greco-Roman\n|DipGREarlyPeace\n|-\n|DipGREarlyWar\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Middle Eastern/African\n|DipMEEarlyPeace\n|-\n|DipMEEarlyWar\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |North American\n|DipNAEarlyPeace\n|-\n|DipNAEarlyWar\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Asian/Oriental\n|DipASEarlyPeace\n|-\n|DipASEarlyWar\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" |Industrial/Modern\n| rowspan=\"2\" |European\n|DipEuLatePeace\n|-\n|DipEuLateWar\n|-\n|Greco-Roman\n|N/A\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Middle Eastern/African\n|DipMELatePeace\n|-\n|DipMELateWar\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |North American\n|DipNALatePeace\n|-\n|DipNALateWar\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Asian/Oriental\n|DipASLatePeace\n|-\n|DipASLateWar\n|}\nCivilization IV\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        =\n| length       =\n| label        =\n| producer     =\n}}\nThe music of the computer game Civilization IV features a large variety of tracks both original and historical, from Gregorian chants to modern minimalism, and makes extensive use of classical music as well as both world music and folk music. Such a focus on the soundtrack and the inclusion of classical, world and folk music are rare among games, though relatively common for strategy games.\nOriginal music was composed by Jeff Briggs, Mark Cromer, Michael Curran, and Christopher Tin. Additional original music was created for the expansions, Civilization IV: Warlords and Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword, including music for each of the several scenarios. Civilization IV: Warlords also adds music from Civilization III to fill out the background music for the Classical Era. All tracks are stored on the hard drive in MP3 format, making them perfectly usable outside the game.\nChristopher Tin composed both the opening movie theme and the game's main theme \"Baba Yetu\",  which went on to win the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s).\nVocals for all pieces by Christopher Tin were performed by Stanford Talisman. The other tracks (especially the polyphony from the Medieval section) are performed by a variety of groups, who are not credited on the original soundtrack.\nLeader themes\nEach leader has his or her own theme music, reflecting the country or culture of that leader. Each leitmotif has three variants, corresponding to different time periods in the game. These original arrangements are shorter and simpler pieces, from just under 40 seconds to three minutes. Some are renditions of famous pieces of classical music, such as Frederick's piece, which is a paraphrase of the fourth of the Goldberg Variations, or Bismarck's, which is the opening theme of the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3. Other themes have been modified from earlier Civilization games.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Civilization\n!Leader\n!Artist/Composer\n!Title/Information\n|-\n|America\n|Washington\n|Michael Curran, Mark Cromer, Jeff Briggs\n|Washington's Artillery Retreat\n|-\n|America\n|Roosevelt\n|\n|Marines' Hymn\n|-\n|America\n|Lincoln\n|\n|Original Melody\n|-\n|Arabia\n|Saladin\n|Mark Cromer\n|Original Melody\n|-\n|Aztecs\n|Montezuma\n|\n|Tenochtitlan Revealed (adapted from previous Civ games)\n|-\n|Babylon\n|Hammurabi\n|\n|Original Melody\n|-\n|Byzantium\n|Justinian I\n| ?\n|En Iordáni\n|-\n|Carthage\n|Hannibal\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Celts\n|Brennus and Boudica\n| ?\n|Fear an Dùin Mhòir\n|-\n|China\n|Mao Zedong\n|Jeff Briggs, Mark Cromer\n|The Shining Path (adapted from previous Civ games)\n|-\n|China\n|Qin Shi Huang\n|Jeff Briggs, Mark Cromer\n|Huang Shi Ti, based on ancient folk tune\n|-\n|Egypt\n|Hatshepsut and Ramesses\n|\n|Harvest of the Nile (adapted from previous Civ games)\n|-\n|England\n|Elizabeth\n|Jean-Joseph Mouret\n|Fanfare-Rondeau\n|-\n|England\n|Victoria and Churchill\n|Thomas Arne\n|Rule Britannia\n|-\n|Ethiopia\n|Zara Yaqob\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|France\n|Louis XIV\n|Domenico Scarlatti\n|Harpsichord Sonata K.380 \"The Hunt\"\n|-\n|France\n|Napoleon and De Gaulle\n|Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle\n|La Marseillaise\n|-\n|Germany\n|Frederick\n|Johann Sebastian Bach\n|The fourth of the Goldberg Variations\n|-\n|Germany\n|Bismarck\n|Ludwig van Beethoven\n|The second movement of Symphony No. 3\n|-\n|Greece\n|Alexander and Pericles\n|Jeff Briggs, Roger Briggs, Mark Cromer\n|\n|-\n|Holy Roman Empire\n|Charlemagne\n| ?\n|Similar to Domine, Ad Adjuvandum and Hurrian Hymn 6\n|-\n|Inca\n|Huayna Capac\n|Jeff Briggs, Michael Curran\n|\n|-\n|India\n|Asoka\n|Jeff Briggs, Mark Cromer\n|\n|-\n|India\n|Gandhi\n|\n|Gautama Ponders (adapted from previous Civ games)\n|-\n|Japan\n|Tokugawa\n|Jeff Briggs, Mark Cromer\n|Sakura Sakura Traditional Japanese (Edo period)\n|-\n|Khmer\n|Suryavarman II\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Korea\n|Wang Kon\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Mali\n|Mansa Musa\n|Michael Curran\n|\n|-\n|Maya\n|Pacal II\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Mongolia\n|Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan\n|Magsarshawyn Durgarshaw, Jeff Briggs\n|Mongol Internationale (Mongol National Anthem)\n|-\n|Native America\n|Sitting Bull\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Netherlands\n|Willem van Oranje\n| ?\n|Kent Gij Het Land\n|-\n|Ottomans\n|Mehmed II and Suleiman\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Persia\n|Cyrus and Darius I\n|\n|Hammurabi's Code (adapted from previous Civ games)\n|-\n|Portugal\n|Joao II\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Rome\n|Julius Caesar and\nAugustus Caesar\n|\n|Augustus Rises (adapted from previous Civ games)\n|-\n|Russia\n|Catherine\n|\n|\n|-\n|Russia\n|Peter the Great and Stalin\n|Mily Balakirev, Jeff Briggs\n|The Song of the Volga Boatmen\n|-\n|Spain\n|Isabella\n|Ernesto Lecuona, Mark Cromer\n|Malagueña\n|-\n|Sumeria\n|Gilgamesh\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Vikings\n|Ragnar Lodbrok\n| ?\n|\n|-\n|Zulu\n|Shaka Zulu\n| ?\n|\n|}\nBackground music\nEach of the game's time periods has its own set of background music appropriate for the era. The Ancient and Classical eras are limited to four original tracks that mostly focus on ambience and primitive instruments such as drums and the flute. The Medieval era features medieval and Renaissance music, both instrumental and chants, such as Kyrie by Ockeghem. The Renaissance era uses baroque and classical music by Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. The soundtrack to the Industrial era focuses on romantic music mostly by Brahms, Dvořák, and Beethoven. The Modern era music consists exclusively of music by American minimalist composer John Adams.\nFor the classical music in the game's renaissance and industrial eras, game designer Soren Johnson selected pieces with a focus on dance music and middle movements of symphonies, as pieces with more dynamic range were not suitable for ambient game music. Johnson's choice of background music was praised for its modern-era focus on works by John Adams, as well as its inclusion of both well-known and relatively obscure classical composers.\nOrchestral samples in the game are from the Vienna Symphonic Library, which features recordings of classical music by members of the Vienna Philharmonic.\n{| border=1 class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Music in Civilization IV\n!Title!!Artist/Composer!!Other Information\n|-\n| Coronation || Christopher Tin || Intro video theme song\n|-\n| Baba Yetu || Christopher Tin || Menu theme (lyrics based on a Swahili adaptation of the Lord's Prayer)\n|-\n| Al Nadda || Rahbani brothers || Warlords menu theme (Lebanese, sung in Arabic)\n|-\n| ? || Michael Curran, Geoff Knorr || Beyond the Sword menu theme (sung in English; lyrics based on Walt Whitman's Passage to India and Alfred Noyes' A Prayer in Time of War)\n|-\n|Original Civilization Theme Music\n|Jeff Briggs\n|Based on the theme music from the 1991 Civilization.

The theme was written to capture the spirit of exploration not only in \"seeking new lands, but also the mental exploration of expanding the frontiers of science and philosophy\". Tin premiered the song at a London concert in July 2016.\nThe game's original score was written and orchestrated primarily by Geoff Knorr, who was assisted by Roland Rizzo and Phill Boucher.  It was performed by the Prague FILMharmonic Orchestra. The score was widely acclaimed and was nominated for 2016 Music of the Year by the Game Audio Network Guild. Knorr, Rizzo, and Boucher returned to score the game's DLCs and expansion packs, which also received award nominations.\nEach civilization has a main theme which evolves as the player progresses throughout the game's eras. Each theme has four versions, corresponding to the Ancient, Medieval, Industrial, and Atomic eras (the other eras each feature the most recent theme; for example, the Classical era features the theme of the Ancient era). Simple single instrument melodies in the Ancient era turn into orchestral versions of the same melodies in later eras, symbolizing the evolution and growth of one's civilization throughout the ages.\nEvery civilization, excluding Sumeria, also features \"ambient\" themes that play during the Ancient, Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance eras.\nDuring a game session, the themes (main and ambient) of each participating civilization (including eliminated ones) will be featured in the in-game music.\nBase game and minor DLCs\nThe main theme of each civilization is written in bold.
