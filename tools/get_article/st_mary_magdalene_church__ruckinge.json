The 14th-century chancel has medieval choir stalls with poppyhead bench ends. The south chapel projects outward with offset corner buttresses and contains a blocked 18th-century brick doorway. On the south wall of the tower is a reredos painted to look like marble.\nFurnishings include an ogee-headed piscina in the east wall of the chancel, a 17th-century altar table, a mid-18th-century altar rail, a piscina in the south chapel, a plain octagonal font with base, and a 19th-century Gothic style pulpit.
