It is a protocol, implemented in a computer program, used for weak-signal radio communication between amateur radio operators. The protocol was designed, and a program written initially, by Joe Taylor, K1JT. The software code is now open source and is developed by a small team. The program is designed for sending and receiving low-power transmissions to test propagation paths on the MF and HF bands.\nWSPR implements a protocol designed for probing potential propagation paths with low-power transmissions. Transmissions carry a station's callsign, Maidenhead grid locator, and transmitter power in dBm. The program can decode signals with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as &minus;28&nbsp;dB in a 2.5&nbsp;kHz bandwidth. Stations with internet access can automatically upload their reception reports to a central database called WSPRnet, which includes a mapping facility.\nThe WSPR Protocol\nThe type of radio emission is “F1D”, frequency-shift keying. A message contains a station's callsign, Maidenhead grid locator, and transmitter power in dBm. The WSPR protocol compresses the information in the message into 50&nbsp;bits (binary digits). These are encoded using a convolutional code with constraint length K&nbsp;=&nbsp;32 and a rate of r&nbsp;=&nbsp;. The long constraint length makes undetected decoding errors less probable, at the cost that the highly efficient Viterbi algorithm must be replaced by a simple sequential algorithm for the decoding process.\nProtocol specification\nThe standard message is  +  + ; for example “K1ABC&nbsp;FN20&nbsp;37” is a signal from station K1ABC in Maidenhead grid cell “FN20”, sending 37&nbsp;dBm, or about 5.0&nbsp;W (legal limit for 630&nbsp;m).\nMessages with a compound callsign and/or 6&nbsp;digit locator use a two-transmission sequence. The first transmission carries compound callsign and power level, or standard callsign, 4&nbsp;digit locator, and power level; the second transmission carries a hashed callsign, 6&nbsp;digit locator, and power level. Add-on prefixes can be up to three alphanumeric characters; add-on suffixes can be a single letter or one or two digits.\n* Fields of a standard message:\n:28&nbsp;bits for callsign,\n:15&nbsp;bits for locator,\n: 5&nbsp;bits for power level,\n: 2&nbsp;bits for message type,\n:total: 50&nbsp;bits.\n* Forward error correction (FEC):\n:non-recursive convolutional code with constraint length K&nbsp;=&nbsp;32, rate r&nbsp;=&nbsp;.\n* Number of binary channel symbols:\n:nsym = (50&nbsp;+&nbsp;K&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 = 162.\n* Keying rate is  = 1.4648&nbsp;baud.\n* Modulation is continuous phase 4&nbsp;FSK, with 1.4648&nbsp;Hz tone separation.\n* Occupied bandwidth is about 6&nbsp;Hz\n* Synchronization is via a 162&nbsp;bit pseudo-random sync vector.\n* Each channel symbol conveys one sync bit (LSB) and one data bit (MSB).\n* Duration of transmission is 162&nbsp;×&nbsp; = 110.6&nbsp;s.\n* Transmissions nominally start one second into an even UTC minute: e.g., at hh:00:01, hh:02:01, etc.\n* Minimum S/N for reception is around –34&nbsp;dB on the WSJT scale (2500&nbsp;Hz reference bandwidth).\nApplications\nThe protocol was designed to test propagation paths on the LF, MF and HF bands.\nAlso used experimentally at VHF and higher frequencies.\nOther applications include antenna testing, frequency stability and frequency accuracy checking.\nUsually a WSPR station contains a computer and a transceiver, but it is also possible to build very simple beacon transmitters with little effort.\nFor example a simple WSPR beacon can be built using the Si&nbsp;570, or Si&nbsp;5351.  The Raspberry Pi can also be used as WSPR beacon.\nAn accurate clock is essential both for transmission and decoding of received signals.\nMH370 hypothesis\nIn May 2021, aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey suggested examining historical WSPR data as a way to define the flight path of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on 8 March 2014. In November 2021, Godfrey stated his belief that his analysis indicates the aircraft flew in circles for around 22 minutes in an area  from the coast of Sumatra before vanishing, later proposing a search area centered around .\n, the validity of Godfrey's claim was yet to be established.\nOn 6 March 2024 the BBC documentary Why Planes Vanish: The Hunt for MH370 examined Godfrey's claim and reported that Simon Maskell, a statistician at the University of Liverpool, was undertaking an analytical study of the possibility of using WSPR technology to locate the missing aircraft. At the time of the BBC documentary, Maskell stated he would be releasing results from this study within six months. However, by July 2025 Maskell had not yet published such results.\nHistory\nWSPR was originally released in 2008.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://wsprnet.org Central database of reception reports]\n* [https://wspr.live/ Live WSPR propagation analysis]\nFurther reading\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4fn8eec4z9np0z/GDTAAA%20WSPRnet%20MH370%20Analysis%20Flight%20Path%20Report.pdf GDTAAA WSPRnet MH370 Analysis Flight Path Report] (Self-published, Dropbox)"
