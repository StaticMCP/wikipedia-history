At the beginning of the 15th century, Bohemia was already divided into 12 regions, but their borders were not fixed due to the frequent changes in the borders of the estates. During the reign of George of Poděbrady (1458–1471), Bohemia was divided into 14 regions, which remained so until 1714, when their number was reduced to 12 again. From 1751 to 1850, after the four largest regions were divided, the kingdom consisted of 16 regions. Between 1850 and 1862, there were several reforms and the number of regions fluctuated between 7 and 13. Due to the parallel establishment of political districts in 1848, however, their importance declined. In 1862, the regions were abolished, although the regional authorities had some powers until 1868.\nMoravia was divided into four regions in 1529. In 1569–1735, their number was five, then the number increased to six. After the introduction of the political districts in 1850, Moravia consisted of two regions. In 1855–1860, there were six regions, but in 1860 they were abolished.\nCzech Silesia was not divided into regions until 1783, when it was divided into two regions. From 1850, Czech Silesia formed one region.\nFrom the 1860s to 1948, the Czech lands were divided into counties and districts. Regions were reintroduced in 1949 in Czechoslovakia. From 1949 to 1960, the Czech part of Czechoslovakia was divided into the Capital City of Prague and 13 regions. In 1960–1999, the Czech part of Czechoslovakia was divided into the Capital City of Prague and following 7 regions:\n*Central Bohemian Region () with the capital in Prague\n*South Bohemian Region () with the capital in České Budějovice\n*West Bohemian Region () with the capital in Plzeň\n*North Bohemian Region () with the capital in Ústí nad Labem\n*East Bohemian Region () with the capital in Hradec Králové\n*South Moravian Region () with the capital in Brno\n*North Moravian Region () with the capital in Ostrava\nAccording to the Act no. 129/2000 Coll. (\"Law on Regions\"), which implements Chapter VII of the Czech Constitution, the Czech Republic is divided into thirteen regions and one capital city with regional status as of 1 January 2000. The capital city of Prague, which has simultaneously the status of a region and a municipality, is treated by Act no. 131/2000 Coll. (\"Law on Capital City of Prague\").\nCompetences\nRights and obligations of the regions include:\n*Establishment of secondary schools;\n*Responsibility for hospitals and social facilities;\n*Construction and repair of second and third class roads;\n*Organization of integrated transport systems;\n*Ordering of public intermunicipal transport;\n*Protection of the nature;\n*Cooperation in the distribution of EU funds within the NUTS-2 regions;\n*Tasks within the integrated rescue system;\n*Right to propose laws to the Chamber of Deputies and submit complaints to the Constitutional Court.\nGovernment\nEvery region is governed by a regional council, headed by a governor (hejtman). Elections to regional councils take place every four years. The number of council members varies according to the population in the region and consists of 45 (population under 600,000), 55 (population 600,000–900,000) or 65 people (population over 900,000).\nList of regions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:100%;\"\n!Licenceplate\n!Region\n!Capital\n!Population(2025)\n!Area(km2)\n!Pop. density(per km2)\n!GDP(million CZK, 2022)\n!GDP percapita (2022)\n|-\n!A\n|align=\"left\" colspan=2|\n|1,397,880\n|496\n|2,818\n|1,926,323\n|1,453,579\n|-\n!S\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Prague\n|1,466,215\n|10,929\n|134\n|775,682\n|557,641\n|-\n!C\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|České Budějovice\n|653,227\n|10,058\n|65\n|309,007\n|480,506\n|-\n!P\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Plzeň\n|614,640\n|7,649\n|80\n|326,669\n|553,512\n|-\n!K\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Karlovy Vary\n|293,195\n|3,310\n|89\n|111,015\n|377,886\n|-\n!U\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Ústí nad Labem\n|808,356\n|5,339\n|151\n|360,731\n|440,737\n|-\n!L\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Liberec\n|449,494\n|3,163\n|142\n|202,639\n|457,749\n|-\n!H\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Hradec Králové\n|555,923\n|4,759\n|117\n|299,250\n|543,106\n|-\n!E\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Pardubice\n|530,469\n|4,519\n|117\n|268,290\n|513,222\n|-\n!J\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Jihlava\n|517,647\n|6,796\n|76\n|241,562\n|474,282\n|-\n!B\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Brno\n|1,229,343\n|7,188\n|171\n|745,193\n|624,757\n|-\n!M\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Olomouc\n|631,500\n|5,272\n|120\n|317,890\n|503,709\n|-\n!Z\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Zlín\n|578,998\n|3,963\n|146\n|304,826\n|524,888\n|-\n!T\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Ostrava\n|1,182,613\n|5,427\n|218\n|597,665\n|499,813\n|-class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"background:#cccccc; align:left\"\n!CZ\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Prague\n|10,909,500\n|78,871\n|138\n|6,786,742\n|634,993\n|}\nCoats of arms\nCentral Bohemian Region CoA CZ.svg|Central Bohemian Region\nCoat of arms of South Bohemian Region.png|South Bohemian Region\nPlzen Region CoA CZ.svg|Plzeň Region\nKarlovy Vary Region CoA CZ.svg|Karlovy Vary Region\nUsti nad Labem Region CoA CZ.svg|Ústí nad Labem Region\nLiberec Region CoA CZ.svg|Liberec Region\nHradec Kralove Region CoA CZ.svg| Hradec Králové Region\nPardubice Region CoA CZ.svg|Pardubice Region\nCZE Kraj Wysoczyzna COA.svg|Vysočina Region\nSouth Moravian Region CoA CZ.svg|South Moravian Region\nOlomouc Region CoA CZ.svg|Olomouc Region\nZlin Region CoA CZ.svg|Zlín Region\nMoravian-Silesian Region CoA CZ.svg|Moravian-Silesian Region\nSee also\n*List of Czech regions by Human Development Index\n*ISO 3166-2:CZ\n*Královec Region\nNotes\nReferences"
