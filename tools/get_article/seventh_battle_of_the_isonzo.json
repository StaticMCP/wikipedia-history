It followed the Italian successes during the Trentino Offensive and the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo in the spring of 1916.\nBattle\nA short, sharp encounter fought from 14 to 17 September 1916, the Seventh Battle of the Isonzo saw Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna shift his focus from broad-based diversionary attacks to tightly focused initiatives directed at single targets. This latest Isonzo battle saw the Italian Third Army, with a large amount of artillery, attack on the Carso toward Nova Vas. Following a successful first day, Nova Vas was assaulted on the second day with substantial artillery bombardments on German bunkers. Within minutes of the Italians ceasing fire, the Austro-Hungarian forces surrendered.\nNevertheless, Cadorna's continued offensives along the Soča (Isonzo) did succeed in wearing away at Austro-Hungarian resources, both in terms of manpower and in crucial artillery availability. As each battle proceeded the Italians' war of attrition seemed ever more likely to wear the Austro-Hungarians into defeat, short of assistance from their German allies.\nThe Eighth Battle of the Isonzo followed on 10 October 1916.\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/isonzo.htm FirstWorldWar.Com: The Battles of the Isonzo, 1915-17]\n*[http://www.firstworldwar.com/maps/italianfront.htm Battlefield Maps: Italian Front]\n*[http://www.worldwar1.com/itafront/isonzo11.htm 11 battles at the Isonzo]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160636/http://www.potimiruvposocju.si/ The Walks of Peace in the Soča Region Foundation].
