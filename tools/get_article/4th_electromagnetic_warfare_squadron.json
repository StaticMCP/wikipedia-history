The unit was named the 4th Surveillance Squadron. One year later, it was redesignated as the 4th Space Surveillance Squadron. During this time, the unit continued to perform a research and development mission and a mission to train newly assigned LASS operators until April 1993. The 4th SPSS also performed mobile space surveillance communications and space data relay.\nThe squadron was assigned to the 73d Space Surveillance Group and in April 1995 merged with the 21st Space Wing. In April 1996, the unit moved operations from its home at Lackland AFB, Texas, to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, before relocating to Peterson AFB, Colorado in 2011. The unit was redesignated as the 4th Space Control Squadron in February 2003. The 4th transitioned to a counterspace mission in July 2005, and activated its first Counter Communications System on 11 April 2006.\nFrom late 2002 until May 2003 the squadron deployed 56 members to support Operation Iraqi Freedom to provide data relay and other space communications for theater commanders.\nSquadron members deployed to the 379th Expeditionary Operations Support Squadron along with other 21st Space Wing units to support Operation Silent Sentry and the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) in Southwest Asia.  Formerly known as the SATCOM Interference Response System (SIRS), Silent Sentry began simply as a proof of concept but grew into a fully operational system that supported the Combined Air and Space Operations Center's ability to command and control its forces.  The system was Air Force Space Command's first deployable defensive counterspace weapon system.  Their efforts earned them the 2006 Air Force Association Citation of Honor for \"outstanding contribution of an organization to the development of aerospace power for the betterment of mankind.\"\nOn 15 April 2022, the 4th Space Control Squadron was redesignated the 4th Electromagnetic Warfare Squadron.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 4th Surveillance Squadron on 26 September 1990\n* Activated on 1 October 1990\n* Redesignated 4th Space Surveillance Squadron on 15 May 1992\n* Redesignated 4th Space Control Squadron on 1 March 2003\n* Redesignated 4th Electromagnetic Warfare Squadron on 15 April 2022\nAssignments\n* 73d Space Surveillance Group (later 73 Space Group), 1 October 1990\n* 21st Operations Group, 26 April 1995 – October 2019\n* 721 Operations Group, October 2019- 23 July 2020\n* Space Delta 3, 24 July 2020 – present\nStations\n* Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, 1 October 1990\n* Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, 16 April 1996\n* Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado, July 2014 – present\nSystems Operated\n* Counter Communications System (2006 – present)\n* Low Altitude Space Surveillance System (1986–2006)\nDecorations\n*Air Force Outstanding Unit Award\n: 1 January 1999 – 31 December 1999\n: 1 January 2000 – 31 August 2001\n: 1 October 2005 – 30 September 2007\nList of commanders\n*Lt Col James G.
