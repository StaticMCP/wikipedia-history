Otherwise, you can get the Advanced Collision System in the Summer 2033 Autoduel Quarterly, and skip paying [...] for this screen. I just can't recommend it for the price.\"\nIn the December 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 48), Marcus L. Rowland thought that the collision system on the screen was good, \"but most of the rest seems unnecessary.\" He gave the screen a below-average rating of 6 out of 10.\nJerry Epperson reviewed Car Wars Reference Screen in Ares Magazine #17 and commented that \"It gets the mission accomplished, but with a little more foresight and expense, it could have been invaluable. Should you hop into your Porsche 911, buzz down to ol' hobby shop, and pick up a copy? Only if you use screens a lot in your gaming sessions. Otherwise there are plenty of cheaper methods to obtain the same result.\"\nReferences"
