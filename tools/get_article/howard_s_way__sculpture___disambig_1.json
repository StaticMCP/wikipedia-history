The \"suite\" of sculptures were installed at the Civic Apartments (635 Southwest 19th Avenue) at West Burnside Street and Northwest 19th Avenue. ''Howard's Way'' shares its name with the plaza between two buildings in which it was installed; both are named for Howard Shapiro, the Housing Authority's former chair. The work's four pieces are  tall and 1,300&nbsp;lbs., ,  tall and 1,250&nbsp;lbs.,  tall and 640&nbsp;lbs., and  tall and 1,050&nbsp;lbs., respectively. It was dedicated in October 2007.\nSee also\n* 2007 in art\n* List of works by Lee Kelly\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.homeforward.org/development/property-developments/morrison The Morrison], Home Forward\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101127182122/http://racc.org/newsletters/artnotes/nov2007.html Art Notes] (November 2007), Regional Arts & Culture Council"
