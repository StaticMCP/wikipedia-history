Incumbent Federalist Governor Samuel Paynter was barred from seeking re-election to a second consecutive term. State Senator Charles Polk Jr. ran as the Federalist nominee to succeed Paynter, while 1823 Democratic-Republican nominee David Hazzard once again ran as his party's nominee. Polk defeated Hazzard by a narrow margin, barely holding onto the governorship for the Federalists.\nGeneral election\nResults\n}}\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n*\n*"
