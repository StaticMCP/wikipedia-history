Transaction banking allows banks to maintain close relationships with their corporate clients, so banks don’t want to be disintermediated by other players.\nThe transaction banking division of a bank typically provides commercial banking products and services for both corporations and financial institutions, including domestic and cross-border payments, risk mitigation, international trade finance as well as trust, agency, depositary, custody and related services. It comprises the Cash Management, Trade Finance and Trust & Securities Services businesses. Although some business banking depends on a third party for 3-5 working days, others take over 10 working days.\nA number of global trends are leading to a renewed focus on the transaction banking sector. These trends include the globalization of trade, the increasing importance of liquidity management and a heightened emphasis on securing relationships in a world where both competition and clients are becoming more global and sophisticated. Transaction banking is also particularly attractive in the current economic context because it often has relatively low regulatory capital requirements.\nMarket size and key players\nAccording to a source report in 2023, the global market for transaction banking was estimated to be worth US$215.228 billion.\nMajor players in the global transaction banking sector includes global banks such as Citibank, Bank of America, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, and ICBC.
