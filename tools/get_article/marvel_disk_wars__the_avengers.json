The series began airing in Japan from April 2, 2014, on TX Network stations. The series was aimed at boys 6–12 and tied in with merchandising produced by Bandai.\nPremise\nWith help from Japan's Dr. Nozomu Akatsuki, Iron Man develops a new device called the Digital Identity Securement Kit, known as DISKs for short, designed to help the cause of stopping and detaining villains. However, whilst presenting the DISK project on the Raft, the villainous Loki appears and uses the very same DISKs to launch a breakout of all the captured villains, trapping Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Wasp inside DISKs as well. Nozomu's sons, Akira and Hikaru, along with three other children, Edward, Chris, and Jessica, come to possess these DISKs and obtain biocodes, allowing them to bring out these superheroes for a short period of time. Teaming up with the Avengers, the group travel across the world to search for DISKs before they fall into the wrong hands.\nCharacters\nThe Heroes\nThese five children have what is known as a Bio-Code graphed into them, due to their proximity to the Bio-Code Installer when it was destroyed by Loki. Because of this and the security programs installed in the DISKs, the kids are the only ones who can release the heroes in question via a process referred to as \"D-Smash\". However, because the encoding was corrupted, each hero can only be released for five and a half minutes before being forcibly sent back.\nThe DISKs are divided into five categories based on the imprisoned hero or villain's abilities: Tech (red), Fight (blue), Energy (purple}, Power (green), and Animal (yellow).\nChildren\n;\n:\n: A cheerful, carefree young boy and the main protagonist.
