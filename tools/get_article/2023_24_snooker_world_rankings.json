Certain tournaments were given \"ranking\" status, with the results at those events  contributing to a player's world ranking. The events that made up the 1976–77 snooker season were the first to award players with ranking points. Originally, the world rankings were decided based only on results in the World Snooker Championship, but other events were later added. The system used for the 2023–24 snooker season was first used in the 2010–11 season, where players won ranking points based entirely on prize money won from these events. The rankings are based on the prior two seasons, with eight revisions after specific tournaments throughout the season. These revisions are used as official rankings, with points awarded in the current season overwriting those from two years prior.\nRonnie O'Sullivan began the season as the highest ranked player; however, Mark Allen became world number one after the 2024 World Snooker Championship. Allen finished the season with a lead of 54,000 points over Judd Trump.\nRevision dates and seeding cut-offs\nThe world rankings are updated at specific revision dates following each ranking tournament. On these dates, the ranking points from the latest 2023–24 season ranking event are added, while those from two years ago in the 2021–22 snooker season are removed from a player's total. The revision dates are also used for seeding of following ranking events.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n! scope=column| Revision point\n! scope=column| Date\n! scope=column| 2023/24 points added\n! scope=column| 2021/22 points dropped\n! scope=column| Seeding cut-off for 2023/24 event\n|-\n!scope=row|1\n| 22 July 2023\n| Championship League\n| Championship League\n| British Open, Shanghai Masters\n|-\n!scope=row|2\n| 28 August 2023\n| European Masters\n| British Open\n| English Open, Wuhan Open,International Championship\n|-\n!scope=row|3\n| 2 October 2023\n| British Open\n| –\n| –\n|-\n!scope=row|4\n| 9 October 2023\n| English Open\n| –\n| Northern Ireland Open\n|-\n!scope=row|5\n| 16 October 2023\n| Wuhan Open\n| Northern Ireland Open\n| Scottish Open\n|-\n!scope=row|6\n| 30 October 2023\n| Northern Ireland Open\n| English Open\n| –\n|-\n!scope=row|7\n| 13 November 2023\n| International Championship\n| –\n| UK Championship, Shoot Out\n|-\n!scope=row|8\n| 4 December 2023\n| UK Championship\n| UK Championship\n| Masters\n|-\n!scope=row|9\n| 10 December 2023\n| Shoot Out\n| Scottish Open\n| German Masters\n|-\n!scope=row|10\n| 18 December 2023\n| Scottish Open\n| World Grand Prix\n| World Grand Prix,Welsh Open, World Open\n|-\n!scope=row|11\n| 22 January 2024\n| World Grand Prix\n| Shoot Out\n| –\n|-\n!scope=row|12\n| 5 February 2024\n| German Masters\n| German Masters\n| –\n|-\n!scope=row|13\n| 19 February 2024\n| Welsh Open\n| Players Championship\n| Players Championship,World Mixed Doubles\n|-\n!scope=row|14\n| 26 February 2024\n| Players Championship\n| European Masters, Welsh Open\n| World Masters of Snooker\n|-\n!scope=row|15\n| 25 March 2024\n| World Open\n| Turkish Masters, Gibraltar Open\n| Tour Championship\n|-\n!scope=row|16\n| 8 Apr 2024\n| Tour Championship\n| Tour Championship\n| World Championship\n|-\n!scope=row|17\n| 7 May 2024\n| World Championship\n| World Championship\n| –\n|}\nRanking list\nThis table contains the rankings after each revision points, which were used to determine the seedings for subsequent tournaments.
