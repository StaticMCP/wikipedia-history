Descended from Yi Yong-bu, she would become the first cousin fifth removed to Yi Seonggye and only royal wife in Korean history who was born and came from the Jeonju Yi clan.\nBiography\nEarly life\nThe future Queen Sapyeong was born into the Jeonju Yi clan as the only daughter of Yi Ŭi-bang, son of Yi Yong-bu and Lady Cho in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province.\nMarriage and later life\nIn 1174, she married Crown Prince Wang Suk as his primary and first wife since her father had a big influence in the court. However, after 5 months reign, her father was assassinated in the coup led by Chŏng Kyun (), son of Chŏng Chung-bu (), which she later expelled from her position and out the palace according to the opinion that,\n:\"You cannot have the rebel's daughter as a spouse and companion for you.\"\"반역자의 딸을 동궁의 배필로 둘 수 없다.\"\nAfter her husband's ascension to the throne, she then received her title back and posthumously honoured as a Queen Consort. The couple had a daughter who later married Wang Ch'un, Duke Hawon ().\nAfter that, her whereabouts has not appeared in both of Goryeosa or Goryeosajeolyo.\nFamily\n*Father: Yi Ŭi-bang (1121 – 12 January 1174)\n**Grandfather: Yi Yong-bu (; 1102 – ?)\n** Grandmother: Lady Yi of the Gyeongwon Yi clan (; 1102 – ?); youngest daughter of Yi Ho (이호, 李顥; 1040-?)\n*Mother: Lady Cho () (1134 – ?); Yi Ŭi-bang's second wife\n*Husband: Crown Prince Wang Suk (10 May 1152 – 26 October 1213); son of King Myeongjong and Queen Uijeong.\n**Daughter: Princess Suryeong (1178 – ?)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Park Eun-bin in the 2003–2004 KBS TV series Age of Warriors.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0026077 Queen Sapyeong] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture ."
