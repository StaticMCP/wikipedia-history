His works are studied at Master-level at the University of Peshawar. He is considered a bridge between classic Pashto literature and modern forms.\nEarly life\nHamza was born in Landi Kotal, Khyber District in present-day Pakistan, as the fourth of five sons in the house of Malik Bazmir Khan. The family was known for upholding Pashtunwali tradition. Orphaned early in life, he was raised by an elder brother, Bawar Khan. His early experience of formal education set the pattern for the remainder of his schooling. His primary-school teacher set the six-year-old to writing out the alphabet; Hamza received rather severe punishment when he instead followed his artistic inclinations and drew human figures. The incident deterred him from attending school; from this young age he would roam the local area, returning home at the same time as his school fellows. When his long-term absence from school was noted, his brother enrolled him in the Islamia Collegiate School in Peshawar. To attend, Hamza had to board in a hostel in the city. He endured what was for him a miserable experience for as long as he could, leaving school permanently during the tenth grade.\nCareer\nAs early as the fifth grade Hamza began writing poetry in Urdu; at this time there was little verse published in Pashto. When his  (spiritual guide), Khawaja Syed Abdul Sattar Shah, advised him to write in his mother tongue Pashto, he followed that guidance. One reviewer commented in 2011:When Shinwari worked on the railways, he had very little money. He received a low-income certificate and quit. He travelled to Mumbai to work in the film industry but failed to establish himself.\nHamza's literary influences included Mirza Khan Ansari and Khushal Khan Khattak.\nHamza was also a critic and a playwright, producing 200 plays for Radio Pakistan, features, critical essays, and research papers for different literary newspapers of Pakistan.\nInfluence\nHe belonged to the Shinwari tribe of the ethnic Pashtuns. His work is considered a fusion between classic and modern poetry. He wrote classical poetry, blended it with recent innovations, and introduced new ideas in Pashto ghazal. He is also known as the father of Pashto Ghazal.\nPersonal life\nHamza lived in Landi Kotal;  He died in February 1994 and is buried in Khyber District.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* Hamza Shinwari poem  at [http://www.chakdara.com/pushto-poetry/ameer-hamza-shinwari.php Chakdara.com]"
