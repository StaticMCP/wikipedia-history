From an early age, his artistic ability was recognised. In 1846, he entered the Royal Academy schools and a year later was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Society of Arts for a chalk drawing. Between 1847 and 1884, Hughes exhibited 36 paintings at the Royal Academy. He also worked as an illustrator, collaborating with George du Maurier in producing the images for the Wilkie Collins book Poor Miss Finch. About 1878 he moved more or less exclusively into portrait painting, drawing praise from John Everett Millais for his representation of women.\nRoyal Commissions\nHughes received his first royal commission in 1895 which resulted in a full-length portrait of Queen Mary. This painting is exhibited in the vestibule of Buckingham Palace. He painted at least three portraits of Queen Alexandra and produced images of Louise, Princess Royal, Princess Victoria, the Queen of Norway, the Duchess of Teck, the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII), his brother Prince Albert, and his sister Princess Mary. A number of his paintings remain in the Royal Collection.\n]]\nPersonal life\nHughes, who married twice, died from bronchitis at his home in London on 14 May 1908, aged 75, and is buried on the outside of the Circle of Lebanon in Highgate Cemetery.\nHis eldest daughter and biographer Alice Hughes became a portrait photographer.\nGallery\nEdward Hughes - Juliette Gordon Low - Google Art Project.jpg|Juliette Gordon Low (1887)\nVere Monckton-Arundell by Edward Hughes (1832-1908).jpg|Vere Monckton-Arundell, Viscountess Galway (1889)\nQueen Mary (1867-1953) when Victoria Mary, Duchess of York.jpg|Queen Mary, when Duchess of York (1895)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp91895 Portraits associated with Edward Hughes at the National Portrait Gallery]"
