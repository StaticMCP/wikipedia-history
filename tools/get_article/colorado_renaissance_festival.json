The Renaissance Festival typically runs between the months of June and August. It is based on a 16th-century Tudor village.\nIt is located at 650 Perry Park Avenue, Larkspur CO 80118.\nHistory\nThe renaissance festival was begun in 1975 as a tear-down event in Morrison, Colorado, with 60 artisan booths. After two years, the grounds moved to Castle Rock before settling in its current location of Larkspur. It was founded by a man named Jim Paradise. His son, Jim Paradise Jr. is the current director of the fair.\nPart or all of the Festival's current property in Larkspur was purchased from the historic American Federation of Human Rights Headquarters, which remains adjacent, in 1975.\nThe 2020 season of the festival was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 46th edition of the festival deferred to 2021.\nFeatures\nThe festival features over 200 artisan shops and hundreds of costumed performers. The festival also hosts weddings in accordance to the themed weekends.\nThemed Weekends\nEach of the eight weekends of the festival take on a different theme, influencing the performances, costumes, food, drink, art, shops, contests, and games throughout the festival grounds.\n*''Opening Weekend!
