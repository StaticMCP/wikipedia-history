A sequel, Library Wars: The Last Mission, premiered in 2015.\nPlot\nIn 1988, the Media Betterment Act becomes a law which limits freedom of speech, particularly in media publications, because Japan sees it as a bad influence on their people. The Media Betterment Committee gets armed to enforce the law. In 2004, the Library Defense Force is established by Iwao Nishina, a survivor of the Hino Library incident in 1999, as its commander to combat the censorship.\nIn a bookstore, high school student Iku Kasahara witnesses the Media Betterment Committee confiscating the books, including her favorite fairy tale book. When she resists to give up her book, Kasahara is saved by a mysterious member of the Library Defense Force who orders the Media Betterment agents that the books are now under their protection. This incident inspires Kasahara to join the Library Defense Force in 2019 to find her so-called \"prince\", where she is placed under the supervision of instructor Atsushi Dojo, whom she has trouble getting along. Later, she and Hikaru Tezuka are transferred to the elite unit Library Task Force led by its squad leader Ryusuke Genda. As they return to base following their training camp, the task force passes by a bookstore, where Kasahara witnesses another censorship operation. She immediately intervenes in the operation and declares the books to be under the Library Defense Force's protection, but her rank is low to collect the books. Kasahara is saved by Dojo but later gets reprimanded for her reckless actions.\nLater, the Media Betterment Committee demands the Library Defense Force to surrender the graphic novels being kept in their headquarters, the Musashino Library, as part of an ongoing murder investigation in which those novels are found in the murderer's possession and might have inspired him to commit the crime. The Library Defense Force refuses, causing the Media Betterment Committee to use force to access the library. While fighting is taking place outside, library staffer and Kasahara's friend Asako Shibasaki finds two Media Betterment agents entering the premise. Kasahara and Tezuka engage with the intruders and manage to retrieve the confiscated books. The assault, which only lasts for an hour as per the agreement, ends. Afterward, Tezuka wants Kasahara to be his girlfriend, but she is not giving him an answer for now.\nSometime later, industrialist Sohachi Nobeyama, who owns a museum in Odawara where the documents regarding illegalities on the passing of the Act can be found, passes away. As per Nobeyama's last will, all of the materials in the museum will be transferred to Musashino Library. The Library Defense Force prepares to defend the museum from the Media Betterment Committee's assault. Genda dismisses Kasahara from the task force and assigns her to guard Nishina during his visit to the funeral. Later, Kasahara and Nishina get kidnapped by supporters of the law, who demand the Library Defense Force to burn the museum materials. Kasahara is allowed to talk to confirm their safety and gives the Library Defense Force a hint that they are somewhere in Tachikawa. Dojo and Mikihisa Komaki manage to rescue Kasahara and Nishina. The hostage taking and the assault at the museum gets published on newspapers by journalist and Nishina's friend Maki Orikuchi. Meanwhile, Kasahara rejects Tezuka and later realizes that her prince is Dojo.\nCast\n* Junichi Okada as Atsushi Dojo\n* Nana Eikura as Iku Kasahara\n* Kei Tanaka as Mikihisa Komaki\n* Sota Fukushi as Hikaru Tezuka\n* Naomi Nishida as Maki Orikuchi\n* Jun Hashimoto as Ryusuke Genda\n* Kazuma Suzuki as Kenji Takeyama\n* Kazuyuki Aijima as Captain Hajime Biitani\n* Kyusaku Shimada as Detective Hiraga\n* Kiyoshi Kodama as Kazuichi Inamine\n* Chiaki Kuriyama as Asako Shibasaki\n* Kōji Ishizaka as Iwao Nishina\nProduction\nwas used to depict the outside view of Musashino Library, the Library Defense Force headquarters.]]\nA live-action film adaptation of the light novel series Library War by Hiro Arikawa was announced in August 2012, with Shinsuke Sato serving as the director.

It earned an additional million in the second weekend and surpassed the one-billion-yen box-office milestone in the third weekend after earning million.\nCritical response\nMark Adams of Screen Daily stated that Library Wars was a \"sci-fi film that makes the most of the most incongruous of action concepts.\" Adams lauded Sato for his direction, particularly his handling of action sequences while layering humor and romance into the storyline. He also felt that Kuriyama's casting would help boost the film's international profile due to her role in Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003). Andrew Mack of Screen Anarchy felt the film was \"thoroughly entertaining and funny\" and praised its action sequences and romance plot. Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter felt the film was \"more like an inflated tele-serial skipping from one thread to another, sometimes with its dystopian settings largely forgotten as the main protagonists' light-as-air emotional struggles taking over.\" Tsui noted that the ''raison d'être'' for Japan's tolerance on Library Defense Force despite being an authoritarian state was never made clear. Despite that, she found that the conflict between the authorities and armed librarians was used as \"devices through which Kasahara builds her character and she and Dojo establishes a rapport-turns-romance.\"\nLibrary \"Mini\" Wars\nSato directed a short silent film, titled , under his video production label Angle Pictures. It follows the daily lives of two library staffers away from the main storyline of Library Wars.
