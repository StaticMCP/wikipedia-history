He gained his sole Springboks cap playing on the left wing in the opening Test match against the 1955 British Lions at Ellis Park. His late try helped spark a Springboks comeback, but they were to lose by a single point, with Jack van der Schyff missing a shot a goal in the final moments.\nSee also\n*List of South Africa national rugby union players\nReferences"
