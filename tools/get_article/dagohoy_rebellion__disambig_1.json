Led by Francisco Dagohoy, or Francisco Sendrijas, the rebellion took place on the island of Bohol from 1744 to 1800, lasting for roughly 56 years.\nIt was one of two significant revolts that occurred in Bohol during the Spanish era. The other one was the Tamblot uprising in 1621 led by Tamblot, a babaylan or native priest from Bohol which was basically a religious conflict.\nRebellion\nThe Dagohoy Rebellion was one of two significant revolts that occurred in Bohol during the Spanish Era. The other was the Tamblot Uprising in 1621 led by Tamblot, a babaylan or native priest from Bohol which was basically a religious conflict.\nUnlike the Tamblot revolt, the Dagohoy rebellion was not a religious conflict. Rather, it was like most of the early revolts which were ignited by forced labor (polo y servicios), bandala, excessive tax collection and payment of tributes. On top of these injustices of the Jesuit priests, what triggered Dagohoy most was the refusal of the Jesuit priest to give a Christian burial to his brother who died in a duel. This caused Dagohoy to call upon his fellow Boholanos to raise arms against the colonial government. The rebellion outlasted several Spanish governors-general and several missions.\nIn 1744, Gaspar Morales, the Jesuit curate of Inabanga, ordered Francisco's brother, Sagarino, who was a constable, to capture an apostate fugitive. Sagarino pursued the fugitive, but the latter resisted and killed him. Morales refused to give Sagarino a Christian burial because he had died in a duel, a practice banned by the Church.}}\nInfuriated, Francisco instigated the people to rise in arms. The signal of the uprising was the killing of Giuseppe Lamberti, Italian Jesuit curate of Jagna, on 24 January 1744. The rebellion rolled over the whole island like a typhoon; Morales was killed by Dagohoy afterward. Bishop of Cebu, Miguel Lino de Espeleta, who exercised ecclesiastical authority over Bohol, tried in vain to mollify the rebellious Boholanos.\nBohol revolutionary government\nDagohoy defeated the Spanish forces sent against him. He established an independent government in the mountains of Bohol on 20 December 1745, and had 3,000 followers, which subsequently increased to 20,000. His followers remained unsubdued in their mountains stronghold and, even after Dagohoy's death, continued to defy Spanish power.\nOne reason for his success is his reliance on collective farming practices. After the death of Spanish landlords, the farmers wanted to begin farming again. Many farmers wanted to institute land reform but the Revolutionary Cabinet decided that they should work in umahang communal or communal farms. Farmers would be the owners of the farms they would work in & have a say in its affairs. More than 15 dozen farms were collectivized in Bohol. This helped the revolution to have the least amount of food shortages no matter the turbulent weather & made the Bohol of today an agricultural superpower.\nA cave in Danao was the headquarters of Dagohoy. Many passages within Dagohoy's cave led underwater to dry land, and it is said that every time Spaniards searched the cave, Dagohoy could swim underwater through this passage to hide in the breathing space.\nTwenty Spanish governors-general, from Gasper de la Torre (1739–45) to Juan Antonio Martínez (1822–25), tried to quell the rebellion and failed. In 1825, Mariano Ricafort Palacin (1825–30) became governor-general of the Philippines. Upon his order, alcalde-mayor Jose Lazaro Cairo, at the head of 2,200 Filipino-Spanish troops and several batteries, invaded Bohol on 7 May 1827. The Boholanos resisted fiercely. Cairo won several engagements but failed to crush the rebellion. Dagohoy's death eventually caused the rebellion to fizzle out. No major repercussions followed and most of the rebels were pardoned\nLegacy\nThe Dagohoy rebellion features in the Bohol provincial flag as one of the two Sundang or native swords with handle and hand-guards on top. These two sundang, which are reclining respectively towards the left and right, depict the Dagohoy and Tamblot revolts, symbolizing  that \"a true Boholano  will rise and fight if supervening factors embroil them into something beyond reason or tolerance.\"\nThe town of Dagohoy, Bohol is named in his honor. It was Vice President Carlos P. Garcia who proposed the name \"Dagohoy\" in honor of Francisco Sendrijas alias Dagohoy. The name Dagohoy is a concatenation of the Visayan phrase Dagon sa huyuhoy or \"talisman of the breeze\" in English.\nThe Dagohoy Memorial National High School in Dagohoy, Bohol is also named in his honor and memory.\nNotes\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003629/http://www.theboholchronicle.com/opinion.php?issue=126&s1=1703&s2=1707&s3=1715&s4=&s5=1713&s6=482&s7=1714&s9=&s10= Dagohoy Revolution]\n* Tirol, Jes [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003446/http://www.theboholchronicle.com/opinion.php?issue=184&s1=2427&s2=2430&s3=2440&s4=&s5=2438&s6=693&s7=2439&s9=&s10= End of Dagohoy Revolution Part 1]\n* Tirol, Jes.
