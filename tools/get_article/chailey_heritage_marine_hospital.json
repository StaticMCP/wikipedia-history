The hospital formed part of the Chailey Heritage School founded by Dame Grace Kimmins to provide education for disabled boys. Muriel Powell was matron of the hospital from its opening until her resignation in 1933.\nThe War Office regarded the area as a potential invasion site and considered that the buildings might provide cover for invading German forces; the hospital was therefore demolished in 1940 during the Second World War.\nSee also\n* Healthcare in Sussex\n* List of hospitals in England\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060930031243/http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/tidemills Friends of The Tidemills and Newhaven Eastside Conservation Group]\n*[http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/nnmuseum/LocalSub.htm Newhaven Museum]"
