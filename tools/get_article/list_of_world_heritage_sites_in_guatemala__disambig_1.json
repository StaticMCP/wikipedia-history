Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage.\nThe Republic of Guatemala accepted the convention on January 16, 1979, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Guatemala has  four World Heritage Sites, Takalik Abaj, the most recent was inscribed in 2023. Guatemala has served as a member of the World Heritage Committee once, 2017-2021.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (department)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tikal National Park\n|\n|Petén\n|1979\n|64; i, iii, iv, ix, x (mixed)\n|In the heart of the jungle, surrounded by lush vegetation, lies one of the major sites of Mayan civilization, inhabited from the 6th century B.C. to the 10th century A.D. The ceremonial centre contains superb temples and palaces, and public squares accessed by means of ramps. Remains of dwellings are scattered throughout the surrounding countryside.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Antigua Guatemala\n|\n|Sacatepéquez\n|1979\n|65; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n|Antigua, the capital of the Captaincy-General of Guatemala, was founded in the early 16th century. Built 1,500 m above sea-level, in an earthquake-prone region, it was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1773 but its principal monuments are still preserved as ruins. In the space of under three centuries the city, which was built on a grid pattern inspired by the Italian Renaissance, acquired a number of superb monuments.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Archaeological Park and Ruins of Quirigua\n|\n|Izabal\n|1981\n|149; i, ii, iv (cultural)\n|Inhabited since the 2nd century A.D., Quirigua had become during the reign of Cauac Sky (723–84) the capital of an autonomous and prosperous state. The ruins of Quirigua contain some outstanding 8th-century monuments and an impressive series of carved stelae and sculpted calendars that constitute an essential source for the study of Mayan civilization.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|National Archaeological Park Tak’alik Ab’aj\n|\n|Retalhuleu\n|2023\n|1663; ii, iii (cultural)\n|Tak’alik Ab’aj is an archaeological site located on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala. Its 1,700-year history spans a period that saw the transition from the Olmec civilization to the emergence of Early Mayan culture. Tak’alik Ab’aj had a primary role in this transition, in part because it was vital to the long-distance trade route that connected the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in today's Mexico to present-day El Salvador. Ideas and customs were shared extensively along this route. Sacred spaces and buildings were laid out according to cosmological principles, and innovative water management systems, ceramics, and lapidary art can be found. Today, Indigenous groups of different affiliations still consider the site a sacred place and visit it to perform rituals.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Guatemala has twenty-two properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (department)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Cultural Triangle\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Cuenca Mirador\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Core of the Mayan Area\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Route of The Rivers\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Naj Tunich Cave\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Mayan-Olmecan Encounter\n|\n|Retalhuleu\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Route of the Franciscan Evangelisation\n|\n|Central and Western region of Guatemala\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|i, iv, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Route of the Dominican Evangelisation\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|i, iv, v, vi\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Route of the Peace and National Identity\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|iv, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Castle of San Felipe de Lara\n|\n|Izabal\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Route of the Agroindustry and the Architecture Victoriana\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Town of Chichicastenango\n|\n|El Quiché\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Green Route of Verapaz, Guatemala\n|\n|Alta Verapaz\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|vii (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Sierra De Las Minas Biosphere Reservation\n|\n|Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, El Progreso, Izabal and Zacapa\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|vii, viii, ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |National Park Sierra del Lacandón\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Manglares Route of Pacific Coast of Guatemala\n|\n|Escuintla, Jutiapa,  Retalhuleu, San Marcos, Santa Rosa and Suchitepéquez\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|vii (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Protected area of Lake Atitlán: multiple use\n|\n|Sololá\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|vii, viii, ix (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Visis Cabá National park and Triangulo Ixil Vernacular Architecture\n|\n|El Quiché\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Painted Murals of San Bartolo\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2012\n|i, ii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Caves of Naj Tunich\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2012\n|i, iii, v, vi, vii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Archeological Site Naranjo Sa’aal\n|\n|Petén\n| align=\"center\" |2022\n|ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |National Theater of Guatemala\n|\n|Guatemala\n| align=\"center\" |2022\n|i, iv (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
