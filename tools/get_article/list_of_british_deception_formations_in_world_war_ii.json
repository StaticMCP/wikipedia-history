The use of such formations was pioneered by Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke, based within the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre, and later joined by colleagues located in the UK. The initial efforts were small and created a fictional brigade with no long-term goal. As the war progressed, the deception efforts escalated into elaborate plans that included entire notional armies. In total, 36 notional divisions were created although they were not all employed at the same time. Some of these were based on real units that had previously been disbanded.\nClarke's initial order-of-battle deception created the 1st Special Air Service Brigade. This notional formation was aimed to take advantage of Axis fears of British paratrooper forces being based in Egypt, from where they could potentially land behind the front line. It was followed by two separate efforts that created fictitious divisions to hide various weakness of the British forces in the theatre. In 1942, these efforts grew into Operation Cascade, which again sought to hide the weakness of British forces and deter potential Axis aggression.\nIn 1943, planning began for the Allied reconquest of German-occupied Western Europe. A major deception effort, Operation Bodyguard, was implemented and included forces based within the UK and the Mediterranean. Allied staff based in the UK worked on Operation Fortitude, which aimed to create new fake formations and an entire notional order of battle. The goal of these efforts was to lead the German military into believing substantial forces could attack Norway, and that Normandy landings were a ruse to hide the real attack that would be launched elsewhere by notional forces based in the UK. Within the Mediterranean theatre, Operation Zeppelin was Fortitude's counterpart. It aimed to elaborate on the work undertaken by Operation Cascade and use the notional formations to feign the threat of attacks throughout the Mediterranean area. The fake order of battle was also used to conceal troop movements from the Mediterranean to the UK. While fake divisions were created to supplement Allied forces in British India and Burma, there was no theatre-wide deception effort.\nThese various deception operations undertook administrative and physical efforts to fool Axis forces into believing these formations existed. This included fake insignia and documents, inflatable tanks, wireless communications, and the deliberate leaking of information, especially via double agents. Within Europe, these efforts convinced the German military that the Allied powers had more divisions than they did. However, similar efforts in Asia were met with mixed success.\nBackground\nInitial efforts\nLieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had previously been engaged in various intelligence work and had helped form the Commandos, was assigned to Middle East Command on 19&nbsp;December 1940. His role was the Personal Intelligence Officer (Special Duties) to Middle East Command's commander-in-chief, General Archibald Wavell. After assisting with Operation Camilla, the deception plan for the reoccupation of British Somaliland, Clarke undertook his first effort to create an entirely fictitious formation.\nOperation Abeam was the codename given for the creation of the fictional 1st Special Air Service Brigade. This brigade was placed to notionally support Wavell's attack against Italian forces in the Western Desert campaign, by playing on the Italian concern of potential British airborne forces being in the theatre and that they could be used to land behind the frontline. This was followed by a scaled-up version, in efforts to fool Italian intelligence into believing that a notional 10th Armoured Division was arriving piecemeal in Egypt, where British forces were based. The plan aimed to cover the lack of British armoured forces actually located there.\nThe first use of deception formations within combat plans came shortly thereafter, in March&nbsp;1941, when Wavell planned to seize the island of Rhodes. A deception plan was formed to suggest the real target was Scarpanto and that the 1st Special Air Service Brigade would raid Rhodes to distract Axis forces. Due to German reinforcements arriving in Africa, to bolster the Italians, the attack did not occur. On 28 March, Clarke's team became known as Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force, with the 'A' purposely left ambiguous.\nAbeam and the 10th Armoured Division had been intended only for short-term use, the first long-term plan was formed in June. Cyprus was potentially at risk of invasion, following the German occupation of Crete. The Cyprus Defense Plan aimed to deter any attack and to buy time to allow actual reinforcements to arrive to bolster the 4,000-man garrison. The deception plan claimed that the garrison was at least 20,000 strong, based around the fictitious 7th Infantry Division (Cyprus). The plan evolved to include additional units, a changing order of battle for the 7th Division, and a notional corps headquarters. These successes prompted the creation of the London Controlling Section, a similar unit to 'A' Force but based in the UK.\nExpansion\nThe lessons learnt during these early order-of-battle deceptions, along with other deception operations undertaken by A Force, resulted in Operation Cascade. The initial objective, outlined in March&nbsp;1942, was to deter a potential German assault via the Caucasus&nbsp;– if the Germans succeeded in their southern spring offensive inside the Soviet Union&nbsp;– by inflating the British order of battle within the Middle East. The plan called for eight new notional divisions as well as two notional armoured brigades, in addition to the existing notional 1st Special Service Brigade (the actual British strength during this period was 15 divisions). The plan officially began in July and carried on through to 1944, evolving as the situation required and with additional formations added. For example, in March&nbsp;1943, six further notional British divisions were added.\nDuring 1943, the Allies began planning for a major offensive that aimed to liberate German-occupied France. The planning of this included a deception element that was codenamed Operation Bodyguard. Bodyguard, in turn, consisted of various elements. For the Mediterranean area, the overall deception plan was Operation Zeppelin that aimed to create an Allied threat to various Axis-held territories. To support this, the Allied order of battle needed to be inflated to provide these operations with the necessary forces to create such threats. As a result, Cascade was superseded by Operation Wantage on 6&nbsp;February 1944. Specifically, Wantage aimed to increase the forces in the Mediterranean by 33 per cent, and double the number of forces based within the Middle East (the latter included the creation of eighteen new notional divisions, six corps, and one army). The efforts conducted by Cascade and Wantage allowed for Operation Foynes, which aimed to conceal the withdrawal of Allied formations from Italy. Eight divisions were withdrawn to the UK, to provide the forming Allied armies with a core of veteran forces for the assault on France. These formations were replaced by three real and four fake divisions. The northern Europe counterpart to Zeppelin was initially codenamed Operation Torrent and then referred to as Appendix Y, based on the section name of the planning documents. This plan then evolved into Operation Mespot and subsequently Operation Fortitude. It was planned by a department called Ops (B) and split into two: Fortitude North, which sought to create a threat towards Scandinavia; and Fortitude South that aimed to make the Germans believe that the invasion of France would take place in the Pas-de-Calais region. These plans aimed to expand the Allied order of battle within the UK in order to provide the forces required to maintain these threats.\nMethod\nDeception formations was not limited to British forces. Notional American, British Indian, Canadian, French, Greek, New Zealand, and South African formations were also fabricated.}} To create and maintain the illusion of these notional formations, various methods were undertaken. At a basic level, British intelligence purposely leaked information and started rumors that would eventually reach Axis intelligence services. This included planting information to be found by foreign diplomats. The notional formations were given insignia and efforts were made to include them on official documents that contained real formations. It was reasoned that the documentation would help to create a general belief that these fake formations existed, and if captured they would further aid the deception. Insignia was worn by soldiers and painted on vehicles. These were then publicly displayed for willing or unwitting Axis informants. Passes and identity cards were manufactured and then \"lost\" where they could find their way into Axis hands. Dummy tanks covered in tarpaulins were routed through populated areas, and dummy parachutists were dropped near Cairo to simulate parachute training. Wireless traffic was created for the fictional formations. For the benefit of Axis aerial reconnaissance, dummy tanks, fake tank tracks, and fake camps were constructed and moved around to create the fictitious presence of additional armoured formations. Furthermore, MI5, the British security service, had eliminated the German spy ring within the UK. Thereafter, they operated a series of double agents known as the Double-Cross System. These double agents were used to feed German military intelligence information about real and fake formations, their insignia, movements, and provided entire fictitious orders of battle. Due to Ultra, the breaking of German encrypted communications, the British were able to read German coded messages and verify the success of their efforts.\nThe notional arrival of Canadian troops in Egypt, as part of the deception effort to increase the British-led presence in the area, provides a case example. Canadian insignias were displayed in various locations in Egypt and within the Mandate of Palestine. In Palestine, British intelligence created an influx of Canadian dollars at various money exchanges, and also requested that Vichy French (pro-Axis) forces in the Middle East remain on the look-out and return (notional) French-Canadian deserters. The success of the Cyprus deception effort was verified via intercepted German communications about the level of British forces on the island. By May&nbsp;1942, the deception methods had resulted in Axis intelligence overestimating British forces in Africa and the Middle East by 30 per cent. This included three of the notional divisions being verified on the German order of battle of British forces. In November&nbsp;1942, following the Second Battle of El Alamein, the British military captured numerous German intelligence documents. A Force reviewed these documents and were able to verify an initial success to Operation Cascade, with reference being made to many of their notional units. This had resulted in the Germans overestimating the British armoured strength by 45 per cent and their infantry strength by 40 per cent. Dummy tank formations were repeatedly bombed by the Axis air forces. By 1944, there were 44 real Allied divisions in the Mediterranean area. Due to Cascade and Wantage, German intelligence believed there was in fact around 70.\nImpact\nRoger Fleetwood-Hesketh, who played a major role in the planning of Fortitude, wrote that captured German maps verified the success of the north and south portions of the deception plan. These maps depicted the location of Allied formations within the UK, the fake order of battles, and notional formations. Mary Barbier, a historian who wrote about the Fortitude deception plan, has questioned its success. She wrote \"it is time to consider that the importance of the deception has been overrated\", and argued that the plan worked as the Germans held \"preconceived ideas about the importance of the Pas De Calais\", and that the Allied staff had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception as they held a \"preconceived notion of what Fortitude would accomplish\". Alfred Jodl, a German general, told interrogators after the end of the war, that major landings were expected in southern France due to the large concentration of forces that the Germans believed had been built-up in Africa. Thaddeus Holt, who wrote about the Allied deception methods, wrote that it was \"particularly gratifying ... the puzzlement expressed by one German general\" who asked why the notional 5th Airborne Division (United Kingdom) had not been used in the Allied Spring 1945 offensive in Italy.\nSimilar deceptions were conducted in Asia. However, efforts to operate Bodyguard-like deception were thwarted by the lack of a defined Allied strategy as the British, Americans, and Chinese all held different agendas and goals. Changing objectives also hindered the development of any strategic deception plan to dupe the Empire of Japan. In June&nbsp;1944, the British captured Japanese documents dated from November&nbsp;1943, which indicated that the Japanese believed that there were  Allied divisions in Southeast Asia and British India, when the actual strength was around 13. Despite the belief in the deception efforts that had created the inflated order of battle, the attempt to use these formations to influence Japanese planning and actions had little impact.\nArmies\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left; border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n|+List of armies\n!width=\"5%\" scope=\"col\"|Formation name\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Date created\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Date ceased to exist\n!class=unsortable width=5% scope=\"col\"|Insignia\n!class=unsortable width=10% scope=\"col\"|Deception plan\n!class=unsortable width=65% scope=\"col\"|Notes\n!class=unsortable width=5% scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Third Army\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"left\"|German intelligence were aware of the British Army's regional commands from before the war.

The army threaten an Allied invasion of German-occupied Norway in 1943 as part of Operation Tindall, and again in 1944 as part of Fortitude North. For this second effort, the army comprised real formations and the notional II and VII Corps. In July&nbsp;1944, the formation joined the deceptive First United States Army Group (FUSAG) for Fortitude South&nbsp;II. In September&nbsp;1944, the army was used to threaten the Kiel–Bremen area, to divert German attention away from Operation Market Garden. By November, the army included the notional XIX Airborne Corps. By the end of the year, it was notionally based in Yorkshire, to threaten a landing along the Dutch coast (Trolleycar). In early 1945, German intelligence was informed that the army had been used as a source of reinforcements and was then merged with Northern Command.\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Fifth Army\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"left\"|As with the Third Army, there was no specific deception effort to create the Fifth Army, but German intelligence believed that one had been formed from Eastern Command.\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Sixth Army\n|align=\"center\"|1943\n|align=\"center\"|1945\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|Cockade\n|align=\"left\"|Formed by Eastern Command to pose a threat to any coast of northeastern Europe, it was not actively employed after 1943.

By early 1944, the army had notionally been reinforced by a division of Greek soldiers and maintained the threat towards Greece. Exploiting the mutinies within exiled Greek forces, the army was reassigned around May&nbsp;1944 to threaten the Italian Province of Pola. The army was then notionally transferred to British India, where it was composed of the imaginary XX and XXXVIII Indian Corps, and was used to threaten an Allied invasion of Sumatra during 1945. This deception was dropped when an actual Twelfth Army was activated.\n|align=\"center\"|\n|}\nCorps\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left; border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n|+List of corps\n!width=\"5%\" scope=\"col\"|Formation name\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Date created\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Date ceased to exist\n!class=unsortable width=5% scope=\"col\"|Insignia\n!class=unsortable width=10% scope=\"col\"|Deception plan\n!class=unsortable width=65% scope=\"col\"|Notes\n!class=unsortable width=5% scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|II Corps\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|Fortitude North, Skye, Tweezer, Fortitude South II, Imperil, Trolleycar II\n|align=\"left\"|While the actual II&nbsp;Corps was disbanded, it was maintained on the order of battle and comprised a number of notional and actual divisions and brigades.

In June&nbsp;1944, the corps moved to England (Tweezer) and was reinforced by the notional 2nd Airborne Division to threaten a landing in the Pas de Calais (Fortitude South II). In October, the corps was notionally transferred to Belgium to reinforce the real 21st Army Group (Imperil).

While based in Scotland, the corps was used to threaten an invasion of Norway (Fortitude North and Skye). It was later reformed in England with command of the real 61st Infantry Division and the notional 80th Infantry and the 5th Armoured Divisions, and was used to threaten an invasion of the Pas de Calais region (Fortitude South II). By September 1944, the 61st had been replaced by the notional 58th Division. German intelligence were informed that the corps and its formations were drained of manpower to replace casualties suffered by the 21st Army Group in Belgium, and it was disbanded in January 1945.\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|XIV Corps\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|End of the war\n|align=\"center\"|A black wolf's head on a white field\n|align=\"center\"|Cascade, Oakfield, Zeppelin, Snowshoe II, Playmate, Compass, Wantage\n|align=\"left\"| Various legitimate administration units across Algeria and Tunisia posed as this corps, which was composed completely of notional formations. The deception included Christmas party invitations for the corps' officers being leaked to Axis agents in Spain and Turkey. Over winter 1943–44, the corps was used to threaten the Tuscany area of Italy (Oakfield), in an attempt to protect and support the Anzio landing. In early 1944, the corps was notionally reinforced with paratroopers and moved to Sicily, then to the western end of the Mediterranean by May. During winter 1944–45, the corps notionally moved to Terni, Italy. Its insignia was adopted by a mountain warfare training facility in the area, and the corps took on the role of the 15th Army Group's reserve that was being trained in mountain warfare so as to appear ready to fight in the Alps.\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|XVI Corps\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|Unknown\n|align=\"center\"|Phoenix bearing a torch, emerging from red flames on a white field\n|align=\"center\"|Fairlands\n|align=\"left\"|The notional corps was activated in Egypt, composed entirely of fictional divisions (the 8th Armoured, the 15th Motorised, and the 34th Infantry Divisions), and was assigned to the imaginary Twelfth Army.

The corps was then used to threaten a landing near Moulmein, Burma, which would cut off any Japanese retreat from Rangoon and isolate the port (Claw). In June 1945, the corps reinforced the real Twelfth Army, and was then used to project a threat towards Thailand.

While the formation's existence was leaked to the Germans in June as being stationed in England, German intelligence already believed the formation existed and had been located in the western Mediterranean area. As part of Fortitude South II, the division would notionally land on the right flank of an invasion conducted by the First United States Army Group (FUSAG) in the Pas-de-Calais area of France. In September, as the final efforts of Operation Bodyguard and to support Operation Market Garden, FUSAG and the division were used to present a threat to the Kiel–Bremen area.

Using the genuine 2nd Parachute Brigade for a physical presence, the notional division covered the withdrawal of the 1st Airborne Division from Italy and its redeployment back to the United Kingdom (Foynes). By May 1944, the division was notionally based in the western Mediterranean, and was used to project the threat of an invasion of an undetermined target in the Adriatic and Balkan region (Ferdinand). Later in the year, it was notionally based in Sicily with the intent of a landing in Greece (Second Undercut). By December 1944, the division was notionally a theatre-wide reserve formation, which could be used to strike any target of opportunity that was within range. During 1945, German intelligence efforts attempted to pinpoint the exact location of the division. Feigning security reasons, the division was notionally dispersed. The 9th Airlanding Brigade was sent to Malta to train and await reinforcements, while the 8th Parachute Brigade and the divisional headquarters were relocated to Rome.

In August, this prompted questions from German intelligence, who were informed that the terrain in Suffolk was conductive to armoured warfare training and that it was not unusual for formations to be separated from their corps headquarters for this purpose. By November, the division had notionally moved to Yorkshire. Over the coming months, the Germans were informed that due to the high casualties suffered by the 21st Army Group in Belgium and the Netherlands, that the division had been used as a source of reinforcements, resulting in it being disbanded.\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|7th Division (Cyprus)\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|Unknown}}\n|align=\"center\"|Black cat on a white field\n|align=\"center\"|Cyprus Defense Plan, Cascade\n|align=\"left\"|A divisional headquarters was formed on 14 June 1941, to deter any German attack on Cyprus, and was given command of all existing forces on the island.
