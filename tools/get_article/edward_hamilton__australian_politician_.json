In April 1852 he began Government service at the Assay Office, where remained until June 1853. Hamilton was then appointed Assistant to the Colonial Architect of South Australia, William Bennett Hays. By January 1854 he had been appointed Assistant Architect in the Colonial Architect's Office. When Hays left for England towards the end of 1854, Hamilton was placed in charge. On 10 July 1856 Hamilton was appointed Colonial Architect and Supervisor of Works with a salary of £450 per annum and a £112 gratuity.\nHamilton married Ellen Seymour in 1856. He resigned as Colonial Architect around August 1860.\nHamilton and his father were involved in constructing the Kadina to Wallaroo railway, completed in 1866. Their partnership was dissolved later in 1866 when George was appointed to the Strathalbyn and Middleton Railway.\nIn 1866 Hamilton joined the architectural firm of Wright & Woods (with Edmund Wright and E. J. Woods), which he left in 1868 to become second-in-charge of the Colonial Architect's Department.\nHamilton was elected a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for the District of Light on 5 April 1870, served as Treasurer of South Australia from 12 May 1870 to 30 May 1870 and resigned a year later, unmourned, on 28 July 1871, and reportedly left the colony for South America.\nWorks\nHamilton designed the present (Anglican) St George's Church in Gawler in Early English style. The foundation stone was laid on 6 January 1858 but the building was not consecrated until 23 April 1895 (by Bishop Kennion), initially due to the church trustees not accepting the Model Trust Deed.\nHe collaborated with Edmund Wright on the design of two prominent Adelaide buildings:\n*Brougham Place Congregational Church, North Adelaide (competition 1859; built 1861; now Brougham Place Uniting Church)\n*Adelaide GPO (General Post Office) building, King William Street, Adelaide (competition, March 1866; built 1867–1872)\nReferences"
