It involved 28 major natural history museums, botanical gardens, libraries and other European institutions. BHL-Europe was founded in Berlin in May 2009 and regarded itself as a European partner project of the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) project, which was founded in 2005 and initially formed by ten (since 2009, twelve) United States and British libraries.\nBHL-Europe was a best practice network. Important components were the coordination of digitization and the creation of appropriate infrastructure, as well as the consolidation of various European digitization projects under a common centralized and multilingual BHL portal. The scope was to make available the digitized literature under Open Access and Creative Commons licenses, and to improve its searchability (using OCR).\nBHL-Europe was also responsible for the creation of structures for long-term storage of digital information (durability of digital data).\nComposition of BHL-Europe\nThe following 28 institutions functioned in May 2009 in Berlin as the founding members of the consortium of BHL-Europe:\n* Museum für Naturkunde (Berlin) (project leadership)\n* Natural History Museum (London)\n* National Museum (Prague)\n* European Digital Library Foundation (Europeana)\n* Angewandte Informationstechnik Forschungsgesellschaft AIT (Graz)\n* Atos Origin Integration France (Paris)\n* Freie Universität Berlin\n* Georg-August-Universität Göttingen (AnimalBase)\n* Naturhistorisches Museum Wien\n* Oberösterreichische Landesmuseen (Linz)\n* Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences (Warszawa)\n* Hungarian Natural History Museum (Budapest)\n* University of Copenhagen\n* Naturalis (Leiden)\n* National Botanic Garden of Belgium - Meise\n* Royal Museum for Central Africa (Tervuren)\n* Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences\n* Bibliothèque nationale de France (Paris) (Gallica)\n* Museum national d'histoire naturelle (Paris)\n* Spanish National Research Council (Madrid)\n* Università degli Studi di Firenze\n* Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh\n* Species 2000\n* John Wiley & Sons\n* Smithsonian Institution (Washington)\n* Missouri Botanical Garden (St. Louis)\n* University of Helsinki\n* Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bhl-europe.eu/ http://www.bhl-europe.eu]\n* [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/ https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120523205045/http://www.bhl-china.org/cms/ http://www.bhl-china.org]\nReferences"
