Overcome by emotion, he cried out words of grief and amazement. He considered the series his life's work, a 'War and Peace' of his time, which had taken him 30 years to start, and 20 years to complete, at times writing for 14 hours a day. Totaling over 3 million words, the series is considered one of the longest single works written in the English language.\nThe fifteen books span the time period 1893 to 1947, much of which contain autobiographical elements from Henry Williamson's own life translated into the fictional account of his character, Phillip Maddison.\nBooks 1-3 cover the courtship of Phillip's parents and his childhood in the London suburb of Lewisham and the nearby Hilly Fields (a plaque is located on Eastern Road, Lewisham to mark where Henry Williamson grew up). Books 4-8 cover Phillip's time served in The Great War, some experiences are drawn from Williamson's own War diaries and experiences, other battles from extensive research.\nBooks 9-11 and part of Book 12 cover Phillip's life in North Devon. Mirroring a version of Henry Williamson's life and writing career, as Phillip writes short nature stories (based on those Williamson wrote and published in ''The Peregrine's Saga (Collins 1923), and The Old Stag'' (Putnam 1926)), as well as finding literary success with a novel about an otter and a trout (versions of Williamson's own Tarka the Otter (Putnam 1927) and Salar the Salmon (Faber 1936)).\nThe second part of Book 12, and Books 13 and 14 follow Phillip's attempts to farm in Norfolk, also based on Williamson's own experiences, some of which were published in his non-fiction work, The Story of a Norfolk Farm (Faber 1941). Many pieces of the series were in fact recycled from parts of books Williamson had previously published, including segments used from Goodbye West Country (Putnam 1937), The Sun in the Sands (Faber 1945) and events/characters directly link with his earlier novel series The Flax of Dream (Collins 1921-1928).\nBook 15 sets the climax of the series back in North Devon, where Phillip dreams to start writing his major novel series (a version of A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), and ends with a terrible storm and flood in Lynmouth based on the real-life 1952 event (though moved to 1947).\nIn parts of Books 12 to 15 Henry Williamson's own political beliefs are reflected in Phillip's, as he is a German sympathizer during World War II and joins a version of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. In an interview with Clive Gordon for the BBC Radio show Profile, Williamson agrees with Gordon that his great work had been neglected due to his politics.\nSeries title\nInterviewed on Desert Island Discs in 1969, Henry Williamson stated that the original working title for the series was A Chronicle of a Waste of Time, based on one of Shakespeare's sonnets. But that his publishers advised against it, as too many critics would take advantage of such a title.\nThe title of the series, A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight is a reference to the works of naturalist writer, Richard Jefferies, in particular his 1883 book The Story of My Heart which had a profound effect on Williamson when he returned from the trenches. In A Story of My Heart Jefferies writes how the power of sunlight linked his soul with the past; \"Gradually entering into the intense life of the summer days—a life which burned around as if every grass blade and leaf were a torch—I came to feel the long-drawn life of the earth back into the dimmest past, while the sun of the moment was warm on me. Sesostris on the most ancient sands of the south, in ancient, ancient days, was conscious of himself and of the sun. This sunlight linked me through the ages to that past consciousness. From all the ages my soul desired to take that soul-life which had flowed through them as the sunbeams had continually poured on earth\".\nBooks\nThe Dark Lantern\nFirst published in 1951, the first book in the series covers the period 1893-1895.

Burgess states that ''\"in general, the sequence has failed to engage the critical and public attention it merits. This has something to do, undoubtedly, with Williamson's political stance\"''. Burgess describes Williamson's writing as \"at times almost unbearably poignant\" and that ''\"Williamson's style is romantic, though rarely sentimental\". He describes the volumes covering World War I as \"one of the most encyclopedic fictional accounts we have\", but that the later pro-Fascist tone is \"highly disturbing, and (there is) an almost manic bitterness which is far from acceptable\".\n\"This, remember, is “chronicle”, its effect is achieved by narration supported by fact, without attempt to concoct dramatic moments, and it is all the more powerful for that. [This book] puts Mr. Williamson, as a writer on the First World War, where his “Tarka the Otter” put him as a nature-writer – in the first rank\".\n'Phyllis Young (The Bookseller, Yorkshire Post - November 1958)'\n\"Mr. Williamson paints in loving, meticulous detail all the rich and varied Victorian scene...Equally detailed are the many exquisite descriptions of birds and butterflies, the streets of London and the beauty of the outer suburbs. The nature writing betrays fine poetic sensitivity and all the many characters are vitally alive...Mr. Williamson reveals the perplexities and intimacies of their domestic life with candour, tenderness, and a deep insight into the complex emotions that sway the human heart. Infused throughout by a passionate sincerity this novel has all the quality of greatness in it, and as an interpretation of life rings true in every line\".\n'Oxford Mail (S. P. B. Mais), 29 November 1951'\n\"Henry Williamson's \"A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight\" at last draws to its close. Both the social and the literary historian of the past 50 years can dredge from this vast serpentine roman fleuve innumerable treasures. Its flawed hero, Phillip Maddison, so arrogant, so vain, so domineering, is vet endowed with a surprising gift of tenderness towards anyone elevated to the privileged rank of comrade. In him Mr. Williamson has produced one of those fictional characters who have far more solidity than most of the people one encounters in real life. A masterpiece then? Alas, no. In this volume there are, as in all its predecessors, stagnant reaches of triviality beside those areas where the tide of narrative sweeps along deep, swift and clear. Uncomfortably one never ceases to be aware that the author is always working close to the diaries from which he even makes intermittent quotations; and one wonders, as the insignificant is piled on the inconsequential, whether he would not have done better merely to trust to the selectivity of memory. Yet, given some dramatic convulsion of nature – in this volume a flood in the West Country – or some no less dramatic convulsion in the life of his love-battered hero, Mr. Williamson is incomparable among modern novelists.\"\n'Sunday Telegraph (Francis King), 8 June 1969'''\nReferences\n}}"
