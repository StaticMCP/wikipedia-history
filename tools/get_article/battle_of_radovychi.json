It took place near the village of  in Volyn Oblast, Ukraine. Around 1,000 Ukrainian partisans defeated\n1,570 Germans.\nBackground\nIn the village of Zasmyki there was a large Polish self-defence base, where the population who survived the UPA massacres against Poles, carried out mainly in July and August 1943, took shelter. UPA partisans from the \"\" group intended to destroy this Polish resistance point. To this end, they first carried out a purge of Poles in the village of Radovychi (Radowicze) on 5 September 1943, located a few kilometres south-west of Zasmyki.\nBattle\nHowever, while preparing the attack on 7 September, the UPA encountered German soldiers, who were taken by surprise and suffered a severe defeat, losing five dead and eleven captives. The next day, the Germans sent an infantry battalion against the UPA, supported by an armoured train, three armoured cars and artillery, which the Ukrainian partisans also had at their disposal. As a result of the bloody clash, the UPA units were apparently forced to withdraw, losing 16 dead and three wounded. However, the UPA avoided being broken up and inflicted heavy losses on the Germans, which was considered a success. According to Ukrainian sources, the Germans lost 208 killed and wounded. This figure is believed to be an overestimate. Wincenty Romanowski reported only 26 killed Germans, who were buried in the cemetery in Kovel.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
