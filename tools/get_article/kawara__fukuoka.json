Many of the place names in the town are said to be derived from ancient Korean, and copper from mines in Kawara was used in the construction of the Nara Daibutsu.   During the Edo Period, the area was part of the holdings of Kokura Domain. In 1866, during the Bakumatsu period, the forces of Chōshū Domain attacked and burned down Kokura Castle, forcing the domain to relocated its seat to a ''jin'ya'' constructed in Kawara. The village of Kawara was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system.  It was raised to town status on July 22, 1898. On September 30, 1956 Kawara annexed the neighboring villages of Kagane and Nidosho.\nGovernment\nKawara has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 13 members. Kawara, collectively with the other municipalities of Tagawa District contributes two members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Fukuoka 11th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.\nEconomy\nDuring the Meiji period, Kawara, along with the other municipalities of the Chikuho area, developed with the Kitakyushu industrial zone through coal mining, and is still considered part of to the Greater Kitakyushu Metropolitan Area. However, as the demand for coal decreased due to the energy revolution, the coal mines that had sponsored prosperity have closed, as have the cement plants and other industries, leading to depopulation. Kawara still has active limestone quarries.\nEducation\nKawara has one public combined elementary & junior high school, operated by the town government, and one public high school, operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education.\nTransportation\nRailways\nJR Kyushu –  Hitahikosan Line\n*  –  –\nHeisei Chikuhō Railway –  Tagawa Line\n*  –\nHighways\n*  Kyushu Expressway\n*  Higashikyushu Expressway\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.town.kawara.fukuoka.jp/ Kawara official website]"
