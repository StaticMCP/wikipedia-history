Unknown to David, she was discovered by an African tribe and became their queen.\nCast\n* Reed Howes as David Worth\n* Mary Kornman as Joan Lawrence\n* Marilyn Spinner as Joan Lawrence (as a child)\n* Dickie Jones as David Worth (as a child)\n* William J.

Selig Productions and Warner Bros., for financial reasons, and the same script was used, with the principal actors in the new scenes made up and costumed on indoor jungle mockups to match the old outdoor footage. Naturally, considering the changes in filming and dramatic technique that had taken place over 13 years, plus the fact that silent films were projected at a different speed than sound films, this resulted in several continuity errors.\nRelease\nTheatrical\nScreen Attractions released Queen of the Jungle in 1935 as both a 12-chapter serial and a 65-min feature film.\nThe film was given an international release, being released in Brazil under the title A Rainha do Sertão (\"Queen of the Sertão\").\nChapter titles\n# Lost in the Clouds\n# Radium Rays\n# The Hand of Death\n# The Natives' Revenge\n# Black Magic\n# The Death Vine\n# The Leopard Leaps\n# The Doom Ship\n# Death Rides the Wave\n# The Temple of Mu\n# Fangs in the Dark\n# The Pit of the Lions\nSource:\nSee also\n* List of film serials by year\n* List of film serials by studio\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
