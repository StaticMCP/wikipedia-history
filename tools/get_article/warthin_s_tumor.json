It is named for pathologist Aldred Scott Warthin, who described two cases in 1929.\nSigns and symptoms\nWarthin's tumor primarily affects older individuals (age 60&ndash;70 years). There is a slight male predilection according to recent studies. The tumor is slow growing, painless, and usually appears in the tail of the parotid gland near the angle of the mandible. In 5&ndash;14% of cases, Warthin's tumor is bilateral, but the two masses usually are at different times. Warthin's tumor is highly unlikely to become malignant.\nLocations\nThe gland most likely affected is the parotid gland. In fact, it is the only tumor virtually restricted to the parotid gland. Warthin's tumor is the second most common benign parotid tumor after pleomorphic adenoma, but its prevalence is steadily increasing.\nCause\nIts cause is unknown, but there is a strong association with cigarette smoking.  Smokers are at 8 times greater risk of developing Warthin's tumor than the general population.\nDiagnosis\nThe appearance of this tumor under the microscope is unique. There are cystic spaces surrounded by two uniform rows of oncocytes, which are epithelial cells with abundant, granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cystic spaces have epithelium referred to as papillary infoldings that protrude into them.  Additionally, the epithelium has lymphoid stroma with germinal center formation.\nThe differential diagnosis includes sebaceous lymphadenoma and oncocytoma.\nImage:Warthin's tumor.jpg|This Warthin's tumor presented as a parotid mass in a middle-aged male, who underwent superficial parotidectomy.

Contrary to pleomorphic adenoma, it is non recurrent.\nSee also\n* Pleomorphic adenoma\nReferences\nAdditional sources\n*Kahn, Michael A. Basic Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.
