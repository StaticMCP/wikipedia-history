The style of title \"Apostolic King of Hungary\" (Magyarország apostoli királya) was endorsed by Pope Clement XIII in 1758 and used afterwards by all monarchs of Hungary.\nEstablishment of the title\nBefore 1000 AD, Hungary was not yet  recognized as a kingdom by the Pope and the ruler of Hungary was styled Grand Prince of the Hungarians. The first King of Hungary, Stephen I. was crowned on 25 December 1000 (or 1 January 1001 in the proleptic calendar) with the crown Pope Sylvester II had sent him and with the consent of Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor.\nFollowing King Stephen I's coronation, all the monarchs of Hungary and the Árpád dynasty used the title \"King\". However, not all rulers of Hungary were kings—for example, Stephen Bocskai and Francis II Rákóczi were proclaimed rulers as \"High Princes of Hungary\", and there were also three Governors of Hungary who were sometimes styled \"regents\", János Hunyadi, Lajos Kossuth and Miklós Horthy.\nLegal requirements for a coronation to be legitimate\nFrom the 13th century on, a process was established to confirm the legitimacy of the King. No person could become the legitimate King of Hungary without fulfilling the following criteria:\n* Coronation by the Archbishop of Esztergom\n* Coronation with the Holy Crown of Hungary\n* Coronation at Székesfehérvár Basilica\nThis meant a certain level of protection to the integrity of the Kingdom. For example, stealing the Holy Crown of Hungary was no longer enough to become legitimate King.\nThe first requirement (coronation by the Archbishop of Esztergom) was confirmed by Béla III, who had been crowned by Archbishop Berthold of Kalocsa, based on the special authorisation of Pope Alexander III. After his coronation he declared that this coronation would not affect the customary claim of the Archbishop of Esztergom to crown the king. In 1211, Pope Innocent III refused to confirm the agreement of Archbishop John of Esztergom and Archbishop Berthold of Kalocsa on the transfer of the claim, and he declared that only the Archbishop of Esztergom was entitled to crown the King of Hungary.\nKing Charles I of Hungary was crowned in May 1301 with a provisional crown in Esztergom by the Archbishop of that city; this led to his second coronation in June 1309. At that time the Holy Crown was not used, and he was crowned in Buda by the Archbishop of Esztergom. However, his final third coronation was in 1310, in Székesfehérvár, with the Holy Crown and by the Archbishop of Esztergom. Then the King's coronation was considered absolutely legitimate.\nOn the other hand, in 1439, the dowager queen Elizabeth of Luxemburg ordered one of her handmaidens to steal the Holy Crown from the palace of Visegrád, and then promoted the coronation of her newborn son Ladislaus V, which was carried out legitimately in Székesfehérvár by the Archbishop of Esztergom.\nA similar situation occurred with Matthias Corvinus, when he negotiated for return of the Holy Crown, which was in the possession of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. After it was returned, Matthias was legitimately crowned.\nInheriting the throne\nat St. Martin's Cathedral in 1790, in Pozsony, site of Hungarian coronations between 1563 and 1830.

In accordance with Hungarian tradition, this right usually passed to younger brothers, before passing to the son of the previous King, which caused family disputes on many occasions. The founder of the first Hungarian royal house was Árpád, who led his people into the Carpathian Basin in 895. His descendants, who ruled for more than 400 years, included Saint Stephen I, Saint Ladislaus I, Andrew II, and Béla IV. In 1301 the last member of the House of Árpád died, and Charles I was crowned, claiming the throne in the name of his paternal grandmother Mary, the daughter of Stephen V. With the death of Mary, the granddaughter of Charles I, in 1395, the direct line was interrupted again, and Mary's husband Sigismund continued reigning, after being elected by the nobility of the Kingdom in the name of the Holy Crown.\nLater, Matthias Corvinus was elected by the nobles of the Kingdom, being the first Hungarian monarch who descended from an aristocratic family, and not from a royal family that inherited the title. The same happened decades later with John Zápolya, who was elected in 1526 after the death of Louis II in the battle of Mohács.\nAfter this, the House of Habsburg inherited the throne, and ruled Hungary from Austria for almost 400 years until 1918. Admiral Horthy was appointed regent in 1920, but Charles IV of Hungary's attempts to retake the throne were unsuccessful. The monarchy of Hungary was formally abolished on 1 February 1946 on the establishment of the Second Hungarian Republic.\nOther titles used by the King of Hungary\nOver the centuries, the Kings of Hungary acquired or claimed the crowns of several neighboring countries, and they began to use the royal titles connected to those countries. By the time of the last kings, their precise style was: \"By the Grace of God, Apostolic King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Rama, Serbia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Cumania and Bulgaria, Grand Prince of Transylvania, Count of the Székelys\".\nThe title \"Apostolic King\" was confirmed by Pope Clement XIII in 1758 and used thereafter by all the Kings of Hungary.\nThe title of \"King of Slavonia\" referred to the territories between the Drava and the Sava Rivers. That title was first used by Ladislaus I. It was also Ladislaus I who adopted the title \"King of Croatia\" in 1091. Coloman added the phrase \"King of Dalmatia\" to the royal style in 1105.\nThe title \"King of Rama\", referring to the claim to Bosnia, was first used by Béla II in 1136. It was Emeric who adopted the title \"King of Serbia\". The phrase \"King of Galicia\" was used to indicate the supremacy over Halych, while the title  \"King of Lodomeria\" referred to Volhynia; both titles were adopted by Andrew II in 1205. In 1233, Béla IV began to use the title \"King of Cumania\" which expressed the rule over the territories settled by the Cumans (i.e., Wallachia and Moldavia) at that time. The phrase \"King of Bulgaria\" was added to the royal style by Stephen V.\nTransylvania was originally a part of the Kingdom of Hungary ruled by a voivode, but after 1526 became a semi-independent principality vassal to the Ottoman Empire, and later to the Habsburg monarchy. In 1696, after dethroning Prince Michael II Apafi, Leopold I took the title \"Prince of Transylvania\". In 1765, Maria Theresa elevated Transylvania to the status of Grand Principality.\nThe \"Count of the Székelys\" was originally a dignitary of the Kingdom of Hungary, but the title was later used by the Princes of Transylvania. The title was revived during the reign of Maria Theresa who adopted it at the request of the Székelys.\nLength of reign\n{| width=100% |\n| width=55% valign=top |\nLongest-reigning Hungarian monarchs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! rowspan=2 | # || rowspan=2 | Name !! colspan=2 | Reign !! colspan=2 | Duration\n|-\n! from !! to !! days !! years/days\n|-\n| 1 || align=\"left\" | Francis Joseph I || 2 December 1848 || 21 November 1916 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 2 || align=\"left\" | Sigismund || 31 March 1387 || 9 December 1437 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 3 || align=\"left\" | Leopold I || 2 April 1657 || 5 May 1705 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 4 || align=\"left\" | Francis || 1 March 1792 || 2 March 1835 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 5 || align=\"left\" | Louis I || 21 July 1342 || 10 September 1382 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 6 || align=\"left\" | Maria Theresa || 20 October 1740 || 29 November 1780 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 7 || align=\"left\" | Stephen I || 25 December 1000 || 15 August 1038 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 8 || align=\"left\" | Ferdinand I || 17 December 1526 || 25 July 1564 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 9 || align=\"left\" | Béla IV || 14 October 1235 || 3 May 1270 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| 10 || align=\"left\" | Charles I || 17 November 1308 || 16 July 1342 || align=\"right\" | }} || align=\"left\" |\n|}\n| width=50% valign=top |\nShortest-reigning Hungarian monarchs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! rowspan=2 | # || rowspan=2 | Name !! colspan=2 | Reign !! colspan=2 | Duration\n|-\n! from !! to !! colspan=2 | days\n|-\n| 1 || align=\"left\" | Charles II || 31 December 1385 || 24 February 1386 || align=\"left\" | }}\n|-\n| 2 || align=\"left\" | Ladislaus III || 30 November 1204 || 7 May 1205 || align=\"left\" | }}\n|-\n| 3 || align=\"left\" | Otto || 9 October 1305 || May 1307 || align=\"left\" |  }}\n|-\n| 4 || align=\"left\" | Albert || 18 December 1437 || 27 October 1439 || align=\"left\" | }}\n|-\n| 5 || align=\"left\" | Charles IV || 21 November 1916 || 16 November 1918 || align=\"left\" | }}\n|-\n| 6 || align=\"left\" | Leopold II || 20 February 1790 || 1 March 1792 || align=\"left\" | }}\n|-\n| 7 || align=\"left\" | Stephen V || May 1270 || 6 August 1272 || align=\"left\" |  }}\n|-\n| 8 || align=\"left\" | Béla I || 6 December 1060 || 11 September 1063 || align=\"left\" | }}\n|-\n| 9 || align=\"left\" | Samuel Aba || September 1041 || 5 July 1044 || align=\"left\" |  }}\n|-\n| 10 || align=\"left\" | Géza I || 14 March 1074 || 25 April 1077 || align=\"left\" | }}\n|}\n|}\nSee also\n* Apostolic Majesty\n* Grand Prince of the Hungarians\n* Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen\n* Regent of Hungary\nNotes\nReferences\n* Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9–14. század), főszerkesztő: Kristó, Gyula, szerkesztők: Engel, Pál és Makk, Ferenc (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1994).\n* Magyarország Történeti Kronológiája I-III. – A kezdetektől 1526-ig; 1526–1848, 1848–1944, főszerkesztő: Benda, Kálmán (Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1981, 1982, 1993).\n* Magyar Történelmi Fogalomtár I-II. – A-K; L-ZS, főszerkesztő: Bán, Péter (Gondolat, Budapest, 1989).\nExternal links\n* [http://nobhist.narod.ru/hungary.html Titles of European hereditary rulers – Hungary: Bibliography.]"
