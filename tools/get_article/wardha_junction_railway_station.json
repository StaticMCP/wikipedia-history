The station is under the Nagpur railway division of the Central Railway zone of Indian Railways. Wardha Junction is an important station on the Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line and Wardha–Chitoda line.\nIt is located at 246&nbsp;m above sea level and has 4 platforms. As of 2016, 90 trains stopped at the station, of which two trains (Wardha–Balharshah passenger and Wardha–Bhusaval passenger) start/end there.\nHistory\nThe first passenger train in India traveled from Mumbai to Thane on 16 April 1853. By May 1854, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) Bombay–Thane line had been extended to Kalyan. Bhusawal Railway station was built in 1860, and in 1867 the GIPR branch line was extended to Nagpur.\nBefore the establishment of Sevagram railway station, north–south-bound trains needed to have their engines reversed to travel in the opposite direction, which was a time-consuming process. To avoid this problem, a new station for halting north–south-bound trains was established in 1985; this became Sevagram railway station. Since 1985, trains running on New Delhi–Chennai main line halt at Sevagram and bypass Wardha entirely.\nThe railways in the Badnera–Wardha sector were electrified in 1990–1991.\nThe Wardha station is equipped with new Route Relay Interlocking (RRI) for faster train operation.\nAmenities\nAmenities at Wardha railway station include: computerized reservation office, waiting room, retiring room, vegetarian and non-vegetarian refreshments, and a book stall. In recent years, the station has been modernised and renovated under the station redevelopment programme of Indian Railways. The waiting area has been developed on one side of the station and the foundation laid for a monumental flag at the station premises.\nA new fully air-conditioned waiting hall has been built for travellers in the station. As of 2021, development is in progress for upgrading the VIP room. New stainless steel benches will be provided on the station platforms with funding from the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme. New LED coach guidance boards will be installed along with additional lifts.\nGallery\nWardha Junction.jpg| Wardha Junction\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://indiarailinfo.com/arrivals/wardha-junction-wr/197  Trains at Wardha]\n*"
