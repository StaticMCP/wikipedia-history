It is conferred by the Horror Writers Association, and most winners have been horror fiction writers, but other creative occupations are eligible.\nThe Bram Stoker Awards, including the lifetime honor in particular, were established along with the Association itself in 1987. They are presented in the year following the award eligibility year, which is the publication year for most of the awards program.\nThe winners are selected by the annual Lifetime Achievement Award Committee, which comprises five HWA members appointed by the President. Unlike the literary awards, which are determined by vote of all members, there are no official runners-up.\nDavid Cronenberg and Del & Sue Howison are the most recent winners, having received the award at the 2025 StokerCon awards banquet.\nRecipients\nThe annual committee may bestow up to three awards, by unanimous agreement, and it need not bestow any. In fact, though, there has been at least a single winner every year, and there were three winners for 1987, and more recently 2020 and 2021. There were 40 Lifetime Achievement Awards in the first 25 years, through the 2011/2012 cycle.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |1987\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1988\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n!1989\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1990\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n!1991\n|\n|\n|-\n!1992\n|\n|\n|-\n!1993\n|\n|\n|-\n!1994\n|\n|\n|-\n!1995\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1996\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1997\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1998\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1999\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n!2000\n|\n|\n|-\n!2001\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2002\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2003\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n!2004\n|\n|\n|-\n!2005\n|\n|\n|-\n!2006\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2007\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2008\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2009\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2010\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2011\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2012\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2013\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2014\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2015\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n!2017\n|\n|\n|-\n!2018\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2019\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2020\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2021\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2022\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2023\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2024\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|}\nMultiple awards\nSix of the Bram Stoker Award winners have also been named SFWA Grand Masters by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association: Leiber, Simak, Bradbury, Ellison, Jack Williamson, and Moorcock.\nSee also\nReferences\n.
