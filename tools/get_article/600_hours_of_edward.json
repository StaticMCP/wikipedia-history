As the title implies, the novel is about six hundred separate hours in Edward's life, as recorded in his journal.\nStory\nEdward Stanton is a man diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. He lives a rigidly ordered life in Billings, Montana, which usually culminates in watching an episode of the police procedural drama Dragnet on old VHS tapes every night. Any deviation from this routine upsets him. Edward has no employment, and all of his expenses are paid for by his father, Ted Stanton.\nSoon, events occur that cause deviation from Edward's typical solitary life. He begins to interact with his new neighbors, Donna Middleton, and her 9-year-old son, Kyle. Edward slowly forms a connection with his neighbors. While this occurs, Edward deals with various events, including a date with a woman named Joy whom he met online, which goes poorly due to Edward abruptly asking her if she would like to have sex after their date, and the death of his father, whom he had a superficial and poor relationship with.\nOccasionally he meets with a counselor; he is unemployed.\nThe sequel Edward Adrift follows on where the story leaves off.\nAwards\n*2009 Montana Honor Book\n*2010 High Plains Book Award recipient, “Best First Book”\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045207/http://llbookreview.com/2009/11/review-121-600-hours-of-edward-by-craig-lancaster/ Review 121: 600 Hours of Edward by Craig Lancaster]\n* [https://mediashift.org/2013/09/two-novelists-love-hate-relationship-with-social-media/ Two Novelists’ Love/Hate Relationship with Social Media] (discusses 600 Hours of Edward)"
