Before announcing his reelection campaign, he was facing historically low approval ratings, and several polls showed a majority of Democratic voters did not want him to run.\nOn April 25, 2023, Biden announced his 2024 candidacy to mixed reactions, though most Democratic voters said they would support his campaign. In October, dissent from other Democrats grew following his response to the Hamas-led attack on Israel and the subsequent U.S. support for Israel in the Gaza war.\nAs the 2024 Democratic primaries began, Muslim leaders and anti-war activists led Gaza war protest vote movements, urging Democrats to write-in or vote uncommitted. On March 12, despite challenges from U.S. representative Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, among others, Biden won enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee and finished the primaries with almost all the delegates.\nAfter his poorly received performance in the first presidential debate on June 27, there was speculation that Biden might end his campaign. Concerns about Biden's age existed before the debate, but they increased after the debate. With less than two months before the Democratic National Convention, elected officials, donors, and celebrities began to call for Biden to drop out of the race. On July 21, Biden announced that he would no longer be seeking re-election.\nFederal executive officials\n]]\nPolitical activity by executive branch officials (other than the president and vice president) face some restrictions under the Hatch Act.\nFormer Cabinet-level officials\n* Julian Castro, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (2014–2017), Mayor of San Antonio (2009–2014) and
