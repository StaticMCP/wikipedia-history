The attack had already been planned in May 1995 and was carried out in three phases. The first phase was called \"Crveni lav\" (Red Lion), the main goal of which was to cut off the communication with the VRS in Vozuća. This succeeded and pushed back the Serb forces. The second phase was called \"Battle for pride”, the goal of which was to prepare refugees from Srebrenica and Žepa to move into the area after it had been liberated. In fact, after the attack, only a small number of people arrived at the destroyed Vozuća area.\nFinal phase\nThe final attack, which was code named \"Uragan\", () started on 10 September and ended the same day with the total victory of the Bosnian forces. The Army and the Mujahideen were aided by the Black Swans, a special forces unit. The Bosnian forces continued advancing through the Ozren area.\nAftermath\nAfter the takeover of the village, the Mujahideen captured and killed some 50 Serbs, abusing, torturing, stabbing and ritually beheading some of the prisoners. Bosnian general Rasim Delić was indicted on war crimes charges by the ICTY for crimes committed by the Mujahideen unit under his control, part of which dealt with the Vozuća case, though he was acquitted for those counts. In 2016, former Bosnian Army Third Corps commander Sakib Mahmuljin was put on trial for having failed to prevent the murders and torture of Bosnian Serbs by members of his Mujahideen unit in the Vozuća and Zavidovići areas. He was sentenced to 10 years in first instance in January 2021.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
