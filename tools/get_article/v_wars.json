The outbreak is caused by an ancient biological infectious agent, a prion, that turns humans into vampires, released from ice by climate change.\nIn the conflict, the vampire faction, called Blood, is opposed by the elements of the government, such as Calix Niklos (Peter Outerbridge) who plots with anti Blood senator Smythe (Ted Atherton).\nCast and characters\nMain\n*Ian Somerhalder as Dr. Luther Swann\n*Adrian Holmes as Michael Fayne\n*Laura Vandervoort as Mila Dubov\n*Kimberly-Sue Murray as Danika Dubov\n*Sydney Meyer as Ava O'Malley\n*Michael Greyeyes as Jimmy Saint\n*Jacky Lai as Kaylee Vo\n*Kyle Breitkopf as Desmond \"Dez\" Swann\n*Peter Outerbridge as Calix Niklos\n*Kandyse McClure as Claire O'Hagan\nRecurring\n*Emmanuel Kabongo as Jack Fields\n*Jessica Harmon as Jess Swann\n*Greg Bryk as Bobby\n*Teddy Moynihan as Jergen Weber\n*Ted Atherton as Elegabulus\n*Jonathan Higgins as General Aldous May\n*Samantha Liana Cole as Theresa\n*Laura de Carteret as Senator Sasha Giroux\n*Bo Martyn as Detective Elysse Chambers\n*Nikki Reed as Rachel Swann\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       = 000\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nDevelopment\nOn April 16, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a critic approval rating of 56%, with an average rating of 6.73/10, based on nine reviews. Isaac Feldberg at The Boston Globe enjoyed it, calling it \"unabashedly silly...a fun, freaky B-movie stretched out to series’ length\". The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer, Brad Newsome, was less kind in calling it a \"a frustrating thing\" that doesn't deliver on its promises. Andrew Dex at Starburst criticized the weak character development and mix of seemingly-unrelated side characters while also praising the growing strength of the series by the end of the season.\nIn her review for Film Inquiry, Stephanie Archer stated \"the series left much to be desired\" and that there was \"an immediate disconnect with Dr. Swann, played by Somerhalder\". Vincent Schilling of Indian Country Today, on the other hand, praised the casting of Somerhalder and Michael Greyeyes, stating he was \"hooked from the beginning\". He goes on to say that the \"show is a blast\". Dustin Rowles at Pajiba described the series as \"very low-rent\", \"poorly written\", and \"humorless\".\nMikel Zorilla of the Spanish-language web magazine Espinof criticized the series' lack of focus, saying it had potential but failed to do anything to stand out. WhatCulture described the series \"a thrilling well-paced ride...[and] damn good fun that compels you to keep watching\" despite \"moments that temporarily draw focus from the plot and leave you scratching your head\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
