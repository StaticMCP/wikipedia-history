Set after the seventh episode of Girls und Panzer (2012), the OVA follows the full tank match between Ōarai Girls' Academy and Anzio High School led by Anchovy (Yoshioka).\nThe production of the OVA was announced in April 2013. The OVA's full title was revealed in November 2013, and was set to be released in theaters aside from its home media release. Misuzhima and Suzuki were revealed as the director and scriptwriter of the OVA in February 2014, respectively.\nGirls und Panzer: This Is the Real Anzio Battle was released in Japan on July 5, 2014, simultaneously in theaters and several paid online distribution services. The OVA grossed million at the box office and was nominated for an award at Newtype Anime Awards.\nPlot\nAfter their victory against Maginot Girls' Academy at the 63rd National High School Sensha-dō Tournament, Commander Anchovy of Anzio High School's Sensha-dō club announces a secret weapon that they will be using against Ōarai Girls' Academy. After Yukari Akiyama infiltrated their school, Ōarai learns the weapon is a P 40 heavy tank. Miho Nishizumi visits the Hippo Team to learn more about the tank and learns that Caesar has a childhood friend at Anzio.\nOn the day of the quarter-final match, Ōarai's Duck Team goes into reconnaissance and finds Anzio's Semovente and Carro Veloce tanks already positioned ahead of them at the crossroad. Following the Rabbit Team's report on the number of same tanks they found, Ōarai finds a discrepancy with Anzio's number of tanks allowed during the match, learning the tanks their two teams encountered earlier are made out of cardboard and Anzio is trying to encircle them at the crossroad with their mobility.\nWith Anzio's plan being discovered, Duck Team pursuits the Carro Veloces led by Pepperoni and Rabbit Team flees from Semoventes. Anglerfish, Turtle, and Hippo teams encounter Anchovy's P 40, Anzio's flag tank, and engage in a fight, with Hippo Team fighting a Semovente led by Caesar's friend Carpaccio. Duck Team manages to disable several Carro Veloces, forcing Anchovy to order her remaining tanks to regroup with her. Ōarai corners Anzio, with Anglerfish Team's Panzer IV disabling the P 40 to win the match. After the match, Anzio treats Ōarai with their Italian foods.\nIn a post-credits scene, Anzio arrives earlier to watch the tournament's final match between Ōarai and Kuromorimine Girls' Academy, but they end up sleeping during the match after holding a huge party.\nVoice cast\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
