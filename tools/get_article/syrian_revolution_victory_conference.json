It was attended by the commanders of various armed revolutionary factions that fought for the Syrian opposition coalition against the deposed regime of Bashar al-Assad, with the exception of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Southern Operations Room, and groups from Suwayda. It was organized by the Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham-led Syrian caretaker government under de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.\nThe meeting praised the successful Syrian Revolution which resulted in the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024. In the conference, Military Operations Command spokesman Hassan Abdul Ghani announced that al-Sharaa had been appointed the president of Syria for the transitional period and laid out the new government's priorities, most of which involved eliminating traces of the deposed Ba'athist regime and rebuilding Syrian institutions.\nBackground\nOn 8 December 2024, the Assad regime collapsed during a major offensive by opposition forces. The offensive was led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and supported mainly by the Syrian National Army as part of the ongoing Syrian civil war that began with the Syrian Revolution in 2011. The capture of Damascus marked the end of the Assad family's rule, which had governed Syria as a hereditary sectarian totalitarian regime since Hafez al-Assad assumed power in 1971 following a coup d'état.\nDecember 2024 conference\nAl-Sharaa held a similar conference in Damascus in late December 2024, where various groups agreed to merge under the Defense Ministry.\nThose who were present at the December conference included: Fadlallah al-Haji, the head of the National Front for Liberation, Azzam al-Gharib, the head of the Levant Front, Essam al-Buwaydhani, the head of Jaysh al-Islam, Al-Mutasim Abbas, the head of the Mu'tasim Division, Muhammad al-Dairi, the head of the Third Legion of the Syrian National Army, Saleh Amouri, a leader in the Northern Storm Brigade, Amer al-Sheikh, the head of Ahrar al-Sham, Abu Saleh Tahan, the head of Jaysh al-Ahrar, Mondher Saras, the head of the Sham Legion, and Abu Hatem Shaqra, the head of the Liberation and Construction Movement. Imad Abu Zureiq, Mohammad Mahameed, Abu Munther al Duhni and Abu Shareef al Mahameed, all of whom who had reconciled with the regime in 2018, were also present. Al-Sharaa spoke with Essam al-Buwaydhani, the head of Jaysh al-Islam, and shook his hand, signaling a thaw in relations between the groups. Various rebel leaders from southern governorate Daraa were present, including Ali Bash, Abu Ali Mustafa, Abu Murshed and Abu Hayan Hit. Some of the rebel figures who attended that meeting, including al-Gharib and Murhaf Abu Qasra, have been appointed to either political or military positions in the new administration.\nThe head of the Southern Operations Room, Ahmad al-Awda, did not attend.\nObjectives\nDuring the conference, al-Sharaa gave a brief speech, outlining the transitional government's immediate priorities which included: \"filling the power vacuum, maintaining civil peace, building state institutions, building and developing the economy and restoring Syria's international and regional standing.\"\nAbdul Ghani announced that 8 December, the date of the fall of the Assad regime, would be declared a national day.
