Judges are treated as having concurred in another's judgment when they either formally attach themselves to the judgment of another or speak only to acknowledge their concurrence with one or more judges. Any judgment which reaches a conclusion which differs from the majority on one or more major points of the appeal has been treated as dissent.\nAll dates are for 2025 unless expressly stated otherwise.\n2025 case summaries\nUnless otherwise noted, cases were heard by a panel of 5 judges.\nCases involving Scots law are highlighted in orange.
