It was published in 1990 by Little, Brown & Company. It was published by Secker & Warburg in the United Kingdom. Kodansha America published later editions of the book.\nThe book covers the Chinese diaspora worldwide from 1500 to the time of publication of the book. Andrew J. Nathan stated that the book describes anti-Chinese discrimination \"without preaching\". Much of the primary sourcing comes from Western people.\nEdgar Wickberg of the University of British Columbia wrote that it is \"the first serious and sustained narrative treatment of [its topic] as an historical phenomenon.\" According to Wickberg, much of the content focuses on Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with some other portions related to Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.\nContents\nOne chapter is \"Jews of the East,\" which describes how ethnic Chinese became economically powerful in various countries, \"Trojan Horse\" describes perceptions of ethnic Chinese devotion to the countries they are in and/or to their mother country. Restrictions against ethnic Chinese participating in the economies and how ethnic Chinese dealt with the issue are in \"Crooks or Capitalists\". There is also a chapter on \"Cultural and National Identities\" which explores how strongly ethnic Chinese feel connections to China and/or to other countries. The chapter \"Hybrids\" describes intermarriages between ethnic Chinese and other ethnic groups.\nReception\nBetty Lee Sung of City College of New York wrote that \"The book is valuable for its overview\".\nWickberg concluded that \"I wish I had written this book.\" Wickberg argued that the book should have had more focus on Canada, which has a major Chinese diaspora.\nSee also\n* The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas - An encyclopedia edited by Pan\nReferences\n*\n*\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* Internet Archive copies:\n** [https://archive.org/details/sonsofyellowempe00panl_1 Secker and Warburg UK printing, 1990]\n** [https://archive.org/details/sonsofyellowempe00panl Mandarin Paperbacks UK printing, 1991 publication, 1992 reprint (ISBN 7493 0860 5)]\n** [https://archive.org/details/mixedsignals00dime Little, Brown & Company US printing, 1990]\n** [https://archive.org/details/sonsofyellowempe0000panl Kodansha America US printing, 1994 (ISBN-13 979-1-56836-032-4, ISBN-10: 1-56836-032-0)]"
