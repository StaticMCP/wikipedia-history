Thick black smoke pours from their funnels as they steam through choppy seas.]]\nThe , the navy of the German Empire, built a series of battlecruisers in the first half of the 20th century. The battlecruiser type was an outgrowth of older armored cruiser designs; they were intended to scout for the main battle fleet and attack the reconnaissance forces of opposing fleets. Kaiser Wilhelm II insisted that the new battlecruisers be able to fight in the line of battle with battleships to counter Germany's numerical inferiority compared to the British Royal Navy.\nwas the first German battlecruiser, built in 1908–1910. The  eventually built four more battlecruisers before the start of the First World War to serve with the High Seas Fleet, and another two were completed during the conflict. A further seven were planned, including four of the  and three of the  ships. Two of the s—the name ship and —were launched but never completed, and the other two were in earlier stages of work when they were canceled towards the end of the war. Serious work never began on the three -class ships.\nSix of the seven battlecruisers completed before or during World War I saw relatively heavy combat, primarily in the North Sea. All of the ships, with the exception of , which had been assigned to the German Mediterranean Division, were assigned to the I Scouting Group under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper. The unit conducted several raids of the English coast between 1914 and 1916, which culminated in the Battle of Jutland during 31 May&nbsp;– 1 June 1916, in which they were expected to draw parts of the British fleet onto the German battleship line. The German flagship  was scuttled by her crew, on the way back to port, and the other ships were heavily damaged. For their own part, during the battle  sank her counterpart , sank , and  and  together destroyed . The four remaining battlecruisers—, , , and  saw little further activity in 1917 and 1918, during which time they were reinforced by . The ships were interned with the bulk of the German fleet at the British naval base at Scapa Flow following the end of the war in November 1918. There, they were scuttled by their crews in 1919 to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Allied Powers.  was transferred to the Ottoman Navy at the outbreak of hostilities, and operated against the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the majority of the war. She was heavily damaged by British naval mines near the end of the war, but was repaired and went on to serve the Turkish Navy until the 1950s; she was eventually broken up for scrap in the 1970s.\nThe eventual successor to the , the  of Nazi Germany, considered building three s before World War II as part of the Plan Z buildup of the navy. The outbreak of war in 1939 caused the plans to be shelved, and none of these ships were built. warships have been referred to as battlecruisers, especially in British works.

She was designed in response to the British s, construction on which had begun the previous year. As the first of a new type, the design process for  was highly controversial. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary for the Imperial German Navy, wanted the ship to follow the British example, incorporating large guns, relatively light armor, and high speed. Kaiser Wilhelm II, along with other senior navy officers instead argued that, owing to Germany's numerical inferiority, the new ships should have armor strong enough to permit their use in the battle line. The ships would therefore sacrifice the caliber of their main batteries to offset the greater weight of heavier armor protection. A significant increase in speed compared to earlier armored cruisers was obtained by replacing old triple-expansion steam engines with more powerful steam turbines;  was the first large German warship to be fitted with turbine propulsion.\nUpon entering service,  joined the fleet's main reconnaissance unit, I Scouting Group. The ship was present for most of the German fleet operations during World War I, including several raids of the English coast between 1914 and 1916. At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916,  was the last ship in the German battlecruiser squadron. She engaged  and, after 15 minutes of firing,  scored a hit with one of her 28&nbsp;cm shells that caused a magazine explosion, destroying Indefatigable.  was herself badly damaged in the course of the action, and had at one point had all four of her turrets disabled, but was repaired after the battle and returned to service. She saw no further action, however, as the Germans turned to the U-boat campaign against British merchant shipping after Jutland. At the end of the war,  was interned in Scapa Flow and eventually scuttled with the rest of the fleet. She was raised in 1930 and broken up for scrap between 1931 and 1934.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Summary of the  class\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 8 ×  SK L/45 guns\n|\n| 4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,\n| 21 March 1908\n| 1 September 1910\n| Scuttled at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919, wreck raised 1930s and scrapped, 1931–1934\n|}\nMoltke class\nand , improvements over the preceding , were ordered in 1908 and 1909, respectively. While their design was not as contentious as with the , there were still disagreements between Tirpitz and elements of the German naval administration over whether the main battery guns should be increased in number or caliber. Tirpitz and the Construction Office favored the increase to ten guns, while the General Office preferred repeating  but with eight  guns, to mirror the development from the contemporary  and es of dreadnought battleships. It was eventually decided that ten 28&nbsp;cm guns would be mounted, though new, longer-barreled versions were adopted. The longer barrels increased muzzle velocity, which in turn offered improved armor penetration. In addition to the increased main battery, the two -class ships were slightly larger and better armored than .\njoined  in the battlecruiser squadron upon her commissioning, and saw action against the British in the North Sea, including the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, in addition to the coastal raids carried out in the first two years of the war. The ship also saw significant duty in the Baltic Sea against the Russian navy; in 1915 she was present at the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, where she was torpedoed by a British submarine, and in 1917, she returned to the Baltic as the flagship of the invasion force that conducted Operation Albion.  was also interned in Scapa Flow at the end of the war and scuttled in 1919. , on the other hand, was assigned to the Mediterranean in 1912 to serve as the flagship of the Mediterranean Division. At the outbreak of war in 1914,  and the light cruiser  evaded the British fleet and escaped to Constantinople, where they were transferred to the Ottoman Navy, though they remained under German command and with their original crews. The ship primarily operated in the Black Sea against the Russians, seeing combat at the Battle of Cape Sarych and the actions of 10 May 1915 and 8 January 1916. She attacked British forces outside the Dardanelles in 1918 and struck three mines. The ship continued in Turkish service until 1973 when she was sold for scrapping.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Summary of the  class\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10 × 28&nbsp;cm SK L/50 guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| 4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,\n| 7 December 1908\n| 30 August 1911\n| Scuttled at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919, wreck raised 1927 and scrapped\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,\n| 28 August 1909\n| 2 July 1912\n| Transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 16 August 1914, scrapped in 1973\n|}\nSMS Seydlitz\nrepresented an incremental improvement over the  class; the limited nature of the improvements was in large part dictated by the  (Imperial Diet), which rejected the possibility of any increase in cost for the next battlecruiser. Improvements to the  design were secured only through pressure Tirpitz was able to place on steel suppliers and the ship's builder for discounts, which provided the necessary budgetary room to alter the design. Tirpitz still pressed for a British-style battlecruiser with light armor and larger guns, but his views were again rejected.  was slightly larger than the two previous ships, carried slightly thicker belt armor, and had a taller forecastle to improve seakeeping in bad weather.  mounted the same ten 28&nbsp;cm guns as in the  class in the same arrangement.\nUpon commissioning into the fleet,  became the flagship of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, the commander of I Scouting Group. The ship took part in most of the major fleet operations during the war. At the Battle of Dogger Bank,  was hit in her after turrets by two or three 34.4&nbsp;cm (13.5&nbsp;in) shells from ; the shells burned out the turrets and nearly destroyed the ship. By April 1916, she had been replaced as Hipper's flagship by the new battlecruiser . At Jutland,  and  inflicted fatal damage on the British battlecruiser  early in the action.  was badly mauled in later parts of the battle, receiving 21 large-caliber hits, suffering more than 150 casualties, and taking in over  of water. Despite the immense damage,  was able to make the trip back to Wilhelmshaven, where she was repaired.

The ships' primary armament was radically modified compared to the older ships. The number of guns was reduced to eight, but their diameter was increased to 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in). They were also placed in two superfiring pairs, fore and aft of the main superstructure. The first unit, the name ship, was completed shortly after the outbreak of World War I.  followed in August 1915, and  joined the fleet in May 1917.  was involved in most of the fleet actions during the war. At Jutland she fired on Queen Mary and contributed to her destruction, along with .  and  later concentrated their fire on  and destroyed her. However, during the battle,  was severely damaged by at least 24 heavy-caliber shells and was unable to make it back to Germany. She was scuttled early the following morning. s career was much less eventful; she was completed so late in the war that she saw no significant action against the British fleet.

The ships were improved versions of the  class; the primary alterations being the adoption of the 35&nbsp;cm (13.8&nbsp;in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them,  and , were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Summary of the  class\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | SMS\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 8 ×  SK L/45 guns\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 4 screws, Parsons steam turbines,\n| 30 January 1915\n| rowspan=\"4\" | —\n| Broken up, 1922\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | SMS\n| 30 November 1915\n| Broken up, 1921–1922\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | SMS\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1915\n| Broken up, 1921\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | SMS\n| Broken up, 1922\n|}\nErsatz Yorck class\nThe three ships of the  class were originally ordered as -class ships, but the design was modified in January 1917 to increase the armament to eight 38&nbsp;cm (15&nbsp;in) guns. The s were otherwise similar to the s, with the exception of the funnels. The -class ships were modified to trunk the two smoke uptakes of the previous design into one large funnel. Only the lead ship was laid down, and work did not proceed far; only about 1,000&nbsp;metric tons of steel had been assembled by the time work ceased. Work on the ship was only carried out to keep shipyard workers occupied.
