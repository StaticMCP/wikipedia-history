After a chase of half-an-hour and some firing, the lugger struck. She was Rancune, Captain Foliot, of Cherbourg and 12 hours out of there, having taken nothing. She was pierced for 12 guns but had only four mounted; she also carried swivel guns and small arms. Two of her crew had been wounded, one dangerously.\nOn 17 April 1807, forward, Lieutenant Shiels, captured the Danish ship Sylt.}}\nIn 1807, Lieutenant Richard Welsh replaced Shiels, but then in 1808, Shiels returned to command.\nOn 23 April 1808, during the Gunboat War, Forward towed three boats from  and two from  in an attack on ten laden vessels moored at Fladstrand in Denmark. Despite coming under artillery and musket fire from a fortification, the British successfully spirited away the vessels, with five men wounded in the action.\nOn 2 July 1809, Forward, Lieutenant Shiels, captured the Danish fishing vessel De Hoop.\nOn 26 September 1809, Forward captured Jomfrue Sinneve Christiene, L.F. Grave, master.\nOn 1 October, Forward captured Elizabeth, Hans Olsen, master.\nOn 5 October, Forward captured Stadt Odense, S. Pederson, master.\nCirca May 1810, Lieutenant Richard Bankes transferred from the hired armed cutter Duke of York to Forward, on the Leith station.\nOn 19 November 1811, Forward, commanded by Bankes, captured the merchant vessel Fortuna.\nForward departed Spithead anchorage on 2 December 1814 and arrived at Port Royal on 11 February 1815, having been part of a larger convoy with   as its flagship.}} On 14 February, Forward, set sail from Port Royal, as it escorted the Boadicea and Dowson troop transports to the Mississippi.}}\nForward and a transport were the last remaining vessels in the vicinity of the British post at Prospect Bluff. On 16 May, they evacuated the last of the garrison there.}} Edward Nicolls, Woodbine, and the Redstick Creek leader Josiah Francis, arrived at Amelia Island, in East Florida on 7 June 1815,}} where rumours circulated that the officers were seeking either to obtain British possession of Florida from Spain, or at least to arm and supply the Florida factions resisting American territorial expansion. (In fact, Nicolls had been heading to the Bahamas, and had unintentionally ended up in East Florida.}}) Forward arrived in Bermuda, and disembarked her passengers on 28 June. Edward Nicolls embarked on the Forward'' on 29 June 'for passage to England', and disembarked at Portsmouth on 13 August 1815. }}\nFate\nThe \"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\" offered the \"Gun-brig Forward, of 179 tons\", \"lying at Woolwich\" for sale on 14 December 1815. Forward was sold on that day for £600 for breaking up.\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n* William James (naval historian) (1826). The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume V, 1808 – 1811.\n*"
