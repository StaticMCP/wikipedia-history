Created by Franz Aliquo and Liao Yutai, the tournament was based on the college and high school game Assassin.\nThe June 2007 issue of Maxim magazine had an article written by one of the participants of the 2006 London StreetWar.\nIn August 2014, board game review show Shut Up & Sit Down released a podcast episode reviewing their experiences of the 2014 London StreetWar.\nHistory and background of the tournament\nThe tournament is loosely based on the game Assassin, popular among some high school and college students. Aliquo and Liao took the game citywide and opened it to anyone above the age of 18, and changed it to a 3 week long, 24/7 format. Featured in the book \"Spray,\" by Harry Edge, as a tournament known as Water Wars, with different directors than the actual game.\nThe first StreetWars took place in the summer of 2004 in New York City; subsequent tournaments took place in Vancouver (2004), Vienna (2004), New York City (2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2014), San Francisco (2005, 2007, 2010, 2015), Los Angeles (2006), London (2006, 2007, 2010), Chicago (2007), and Paris (2007).\nStreetWars' last event was in 2015 in San Francisco and now seems to be defunct, with the last update made to its Facebook page in August 2016 and its website no longer live.\nControversy\nMayor Bloomberg blasts StreetWars\nIn July 2005, when asked of his opinion on StreetWars, Mayor Mike Bloomberg of New York City said that the creators of StreetWars could probably 'use some psychiatric help'.\nPolice concerns in London\nBefore the start of the game in London in July 2006, police voiced concerns that the associated suspicious activities might lead to deployment of officers and waste of resources.\nThe Shadow Government\nWhile StreetWars was created by Aliquo and Liao, the tournament itself is operated by an organization that calls itself \"The Shadow Government\", led by two mysterious figures known only as \"Supreme Commander\" and \"Mustache Commander\". His signature is a fedora, mandarin gown, pipe, bottle of Jack Daniels, and mustache. The \"Mustache Commander\" is the fictional alter ego of Yutai Liao, and the \"Supreme Commander\" – of Franz Aliquo.\nAlter ego of StreetWars co-creator, Yutai Liao, Mustache Commander made his first appearance in StreetWars during the San Francisco 2005 game. Previous to the SF 2005 game, there has only been the Supreme Commander and the mysterious \"Assigner\".\nThe now famous giant bottle of Jack Daniel's that greets each and every player at the beginning of every tournament, started with the second appearance of the Mustache Commander (the first was with his signature fedora), in a tunnel in Golden Gate Park in the SF 2005 tournament. The Mustache Commander is now often portrayed with a bottle of Jack Daniel's in hand.\nPast winners\nChampions\nThe 'Champion' is the last assassin standing at the end of the three-week regulation period, or the winner of the sudden death tournament.\nAll games have ended in Sudden Death unless noted.\n* NYC 2011 – Handsome Brandon – killed Supreme while hiding under a thimble ([https://www.facebook.com/brandonlaner Brandon Sherman's Facebook page])\n* London 2010 – Rob Gribbin (FFF).
