AllMusic's Jeffries found the album \"keeps this capo's reputation intact. Recommended for aspiring dons and more open-minded thugs\". David Drake of Pitchfork stated: \"Chemical Warfare is a rap version of Speilberg's Minority Report; it draws upon a gritty underground past while embracing more modern craftsmanship, where new smooth edges are balanced by the felt-authenticity of its caliginous vision\".\nTrack listing\n| length2       = 3:49\n| title3        = Lose Your Life\n| note3         = with Snoop Dogg, Jadakiss and Pusha T\n| writer3       =\n| length3       = 4:28\n| title4        = Chemical Warfare\n| note4         = with Eminem\n| writer4       =\n| length4       = 1:33\n| title5        = Grand Concourse Benches\n| note5         = with KRS-One\n| writer5       =\n| length5       = 5:22\n| title6        = Therapy\n| note6         = with Evidence, Blu, Talib Kweli and KiD CuDi\n| writer6       =\n| length6       = 5:22\n| title7        = That'll Work\n| note7         = with Three 6 Mafia and Juvenile\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 5:00\n| title8        = Smile\n| note8         = with Maxwell and Twista\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 4:43\n| title9        = Keep the Heels On\n| note9         = with Prodigy\n| writer9       =\n| length9       = 3:45\n| title10       = Acts of Violence\n| note10        = Gangrene with Roc 'C' and Crooked I\n| writer10      =\n| length10      = 5:22\n| title11       = Lights, Cameras, Action\n| note11        = with Lil' Fame\n| writer11      =\n| length11      = 1:39\n| title12       = Some Gangster Shit\n| note12        = with Fabolous\n| writer12      =\n| length12      = 2:00\n| title13       = On Sight\n| note13        = with Tha Dogg Pound and The Lady of Rage\n| writer13      =\n| length13      = 3:46\n| title14       = Take a Look Back\n| note14        =\n| writer14      = Maman\n| length14      = 5:29\n| total_length  =\n}}\n| extra15       = Oh No\n| length15      = 2:13\n| total_length  = 55:29\n}}\nPersonnel\n*Daniel Alan \"The Alchemist\" Maman – vocals, producer (tracks: 1-14), recording (tracks: 1-3, 5-15), mixing (track 6), sleeve notes\n*Nathaniel \"Kool G Rap\" Wilson – vocals (track 2)\n*Calvin \"Snoop Dogg\" Broadus – vocals (track 3)\n*Jason \"Jadakiss\" Phillips – vocals (track 3)\n*Terrence \"Pusha T\" Thornton – vocals (track 3)\n*Marshall \"Eminem\" Mathers – vocals (track 4)\n*Lawrence \"KRS-One\" Parker – vocals (track 5)\n*Michael \"Evidence\" Perretta – vocals (track 6)\n*Johnson \"Blu\" Barnes III – vocals (track 6)\n*Talib Kweli – vocals (track 6)\n*Scott \"KiD CuDi\" Mescudi – vocals (track 6)\n*Paul \"DJ Paul\" Beauregard – vocals (track 7)\n*Jordan \"Juicy J\" Houston – vocals (track 7)\n*Terius \"Juvenile\" Gray – vocals (track 7)\n*Gerald Maxwell Rivera – vocals (track 8)\n*Carl \"Twista\" Mitchell – vocals (track 8)\n*Eric Johnson – bass (track 8)\n*Albert \"Prodigy\" Johnson – vocals (track 9)\n*Michael \"Oh No\" Jackson – vocals (tracks: 10, 15), producer (track 15)\n*Damien \"Roc C\" Smith – vocals (track 10)\n*Dominic \"Crooked I\" Wickliffe – vocals (track 10)\n*Jamal \"Lil' Fame\" Grinnage – vocals (track 11)\n*John \"Fabolous\" Jackson – vocals (track 12)\n*Delmar \"Daz Dillinger\" Arnaud – vocals (track 13)\n*Ricardo \"Kurupt\" Brown – vocals (track 13)\n*Robin \"The Lady of Rage\" Allen – vocals (track 13)\n*Ming – additional vocals (track 13)\n*Mike Strange – recording (track 4)\n*Eddie Sancho – mixing (tracks: 2, 13)\n*Kevin Crouse – mixing (tracks: 3-5, 7-12, 14)\n*Romeo \"DJ Romes\" Jimenez – scratches & mixing (track 15)\n*Arnold Mischkulnig – mastering\n*Neil Maman – executive producer, management\n*Paul Grosso – design, creative director\n*Chad Griffith – photography\n*Michael Greene – A&R\n*Stephen Hacker – A&R\n*Tiffany R.
