      "text": "# List of People's Heroes of Yugoslavia monuments in Croatia\n\nThere were 1,322 individuals who were decorated by the Order of the People's hero of Yugoslavia between 1942 and 1973. Many busts and memorials were built in honor of each People's hero. Each of them usually had a bust in his birthplace or at the place of his death. Most of these monuments are built in figurative style, but some of them were completely abstract, for example, monument of Ivo Lola Ribar, built at Glamoč field in 1962.\nLarge number of People's heroes' busts and monuments in Dalmatia, Slavonia and central Croatia were removed from public places or destroyed during the 1990s as a part of revisionism process. However, monuments of People's heroes are mostly intact in Istria, Hrvatsko Primorje and Hrvatsko Zagorje.\nMonument list\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Name\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Slobodan Bajić Paja\n|Banovci\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Bogoljub Vukajlović Lala\n|Bobota\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Josip Skočilić\n|Bribir\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Tomo Strizić\n|Bribir\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Nikola Car - Crni\n|Crikvenica\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Ivan Marinković Slavko\n|Crikvenica\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Božidar Maslarić\n|Dalj\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Ivan Lenac\n|Delnice\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Viktor Bubanj\n|Delnice\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Vjekoslav Klobučar\n|Delnice\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Zdenko Petranović\n|Delnice\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Nikola Rački\n|Delnice\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Ivanka Trohar\n|Delnice\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Milan Rustanbeg\n|Delnice\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Ivo Lola Ribar\n|Đakovo\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Vilim Galjer\n|Đurđevac\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Ivo Lola Ribar\n|Ilok\n|Dedicated to Ivo Lola Ribar, main secretary of Alliance of the communist youth of Yugoslavia and member of Central Committee of Communist party of Yugoslavia.\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Većeslav Holjevac\n|Karlovac\n|\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Josip Broz Tito\n|Kumrovec\n|Designed by Antun Augustinčić, built in 1947.\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Olga Ban\n|Pazin\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Giuseppe Budicin - Pino\n|Pazin\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Joakim Rakovac\n|Pazin\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Jože Šuran\n|Pazin\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Savo Vukelić\n|Pazin\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Monument of Joakim Rakovac\n|Poreč\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Josip Broz Tito\n|Pula\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Juraj Kalc\n|Pula\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Olga Ban\n|Pula\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Viktor Bubanj\n|Rijeka\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Vitomir Širola\n|Rijeka\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Giuseppe Budicin - Pino\n|Rovinj\n|\n|-\n|]]\n|Bust of Matteo Benussi - Cio\n|Rovinj\n|\n|-\n|\n|Memorial tomb with bust of Jozo Lozovina Mosor\n|Seget Donji\n|Designed by Ivan and Tonči Martinić, built in 1956.
