He has six siblings, including an older half-brother, Quincy. Combs has described himself as having a close relationship with his father, having shown support during his sexual assault trial, and having issued a joint statement of support along with five of his siblings in October 2024. In November of that year, Combs announced he would be taking control of his father's Instagram account in order to highlight his accomplishments. Following the verdict of his father's criminal trial, where he was acquitted of racketeering and sex trafficking, Combs expressed relief, commenting that he would \"hug [his] pops\".\nCareer\nCombs told People in 2022 that he always wanted to be a rapper like his father, Sean Combs. Combs said in 2019 that his mother, Kim Porter, encouraged him to pursue music. Combs signed with his father's record label Bad Boy Records in 2016. In 2018, Combs released his debut mixtape, ''90's Baby, on SoundCloud. Combs released his 9-track EP Cyncerely, C3'' on March 29, 2019.\nIn 2022, Combs achieved his first number 1 single on Mediabase's Urban Radio chart with his song \"Can't Stop Won't Stop\", featuring Kodak Black. At the BET Awards 2023, Combs was nominated for \"Best Collaboration\" for the song. On July 14, 2023, Combs released his second EP, C3. On June 27, 2025, Combs released a surprise extended play called Never Stop, which included the song \"Lonely Roads\", a song Kanye West previewed in March 2025. The album includes a song called \"Diddy Free\", referencing Combs's father. In September 2025, Combs released the music video for \"Lonely Roads\".\nIn addition to rapping, Combs is also a fashion model. Combs is signed to IMG Models, first signing in 2018 for worldwide representation, and re-signing in 2023. Combs represented fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana, becoming the face of the brand's 2018 Spring campaign. In 2020, Combs collaborated with Rihanna for a Savage X Fenty men's wear collection.\nLegal issues\nIn April 2024, Combs was accused of sexual assault in a lawsuit that also named his father. The lawsuit alleged that in December 2022, whilst on vacation, Combs pressured a woman working as a steward on his father's yacht to drink tequila and later assaulted her by attempting to force her to give him oral sex. The woman also claimed that his father paid off the ship's crew to remain silent about the incident. An attorney for Combs, Aaron Dyer, claimed the lawsuit contained \"manufactured lies and irrelevant facts\".\nDiscography\nExtended plays\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+List of extended plays, with selected details\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Details\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Cyncerely, C3\n|\n* Released: March 29, 2019\n* Label: Bad Boy, Empire Distribution\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| C3\n|\n* Released: July 14, 2023\n* Label: Bad Boy\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Never Stop\n|\n* Released: June 27, 2025\n* Label: Goodfellas Entertainment\n|\n|-\n|}\nMixtapes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+List of mixtapes, with selected details\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Details\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''90's Baby\n|\n* Released: April 11, 2018\n* Label: Self-released\n|\n|-\n|}\nSingles\nAs lead artist\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Album/EP\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Type Different\" (feat.
