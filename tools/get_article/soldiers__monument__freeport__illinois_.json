Atkins designed the monument, which was erected in 1871. The limestone obelisk monument is  tall; a statue of Victory originally topped the monument, but it was destroyed by a lightning strike in 1960. Marble tablets at the base of the memorial listed the names of Stephenson County's Civil War casualties; these were reversed and covered by bronze plaques in 1924 to allow space to list all of the county's Civil War veterans. Four  statues were located at the corners of the base, which were replaced by identical replicas in 1924. The statues represent soldiers from each major branch of the Union military: the Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and Navy.\nThe monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 1, 1998.\nReplacement of the Victory statue\nAfter several years of fundraising by the Civil War Monument Fund, over $120,000 was raised to replace the destroyed victory statue. The efforts of the group and many local donors culminated in the repair of the monument and the replacement of the statue on December 4, 2015. Vincent Tolpo, a local artist, was contracted to recreate the Victory statue.\nReferences"
