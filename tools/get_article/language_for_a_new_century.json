W. Norton & Company.\nFrom the foreword, Carolyn Forché wrote, \"Where else would we find poetry from a two-thousand-year-old Seal script, poetry written in the graphemic style of Sanskrit, as well as English versions of experimental poetry from the Marathi language.\" The poet Yusef Komunyakaa called the anthology \"marvelous,\" and historian Howard Zinn noted that \"this rich collection of poetry...fills a huge gap in our cultural heritage.\"\nContributors\nIn order of table of contents:\nReferences"
