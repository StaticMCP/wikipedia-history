The awards recognise full bodies of work and community connections.\nThe awards were first made in 2014. In 2020 the awards event was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nominations are invited from the public, and a panel selects finalists in each category. The finalists are invited to an awards dinner where the recipients are announced. The award trophy is designed and made by Ainsley O'Connell.\nCategories\nThe awards are presented in three categories.\nWirihana Leadership Award\nThe award is open to all Architecture + Women NZ members who are in their second decade after graduation. The award is named after Moana Wirihana (Te Kawerau ā Maki) whose leadership saw the design and construction of many wharenui (meeting houses) in New Zealand.\nMunro Diversity Award\nThis award is \"open to all genders, and looks specifically for evidence of continued support strategies for diversity in the workplace, including but not necessarily restricted to gender\". The award is named because of the structural problems in early New Zealand architecture where affluence was a requirement for education, and bias meant women often were not named architect even though this is what they were doing. It is named after Christchurch architect Margaret Munro.\nChrystall Excellence Award\nThis award is open to women with three or more decades of architecture practice. It is named for Lillian Chrystall who in 1967 was the first woman to win a New Zealand Institute of Architects national award.\nJudges\nThe jury for the 2023 awards had four members: Justine Clark, Craig Moller, Sarah Treadwell and Carinnya Feaunati. The jury for the 2020 awards was Lori Brown, Julia Gatley, Raukura Turei and Andrew Tu’inukuafe. The jury for the 2017 awards was Brit Andresen, Sharon Jansen, Anna Tong  and Dave Strachan.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award\n!Recipient\n!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2023\n|Wirihana Leadership Award\n|Raukura Turei, Monk Mackenzie\n|\n|-\n|Munro Diversity Award\n|Kathy Waghorn, HOOPLA\n|\n|-\n|Chrystall Excellence Award\n|Sharon Jansen\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award\n!Recipient\n!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2020\n|Wirihana Leadership Award\n|Louise Wright, Assembly Architects\n|\n|-\n|Munro Diversity Award\n|Jade Kake, Matakohe Architecture and Urbanism Ltd\n|\n|-\n|Chrystall Excellence Award\n|Christina van Bohemen, Sills van Bohemen\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award\n!Recipient\n!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2017\n|Wirihana Leadership Award\n|Bureaux Ltd (Jessica Barter and Maggie Carroll)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Munro Diversity Award\n|Lindley Naismith, Scarlet Architects\n|-\n|Chrystall Excellence Award\n|Sarah Treadwell\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award\n!Recipient\n!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2014\n|Wirihana Leadership Award\n|Cecile Bonnifait, Bonnifait + Giesen Atelier Workshop\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Munro Diversity Award\n|Justine Clark & Gill Matthewson, Parlour\n|-\n|Chrystall Excellence Award\n|Julie Stout, Mitchell & Stout Architects\n|}\nSee also\n* List of awards honoring women\nReferences"
