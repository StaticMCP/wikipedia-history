Sir Henry also provided an annual dinner for the elderly of Weymouth (known as the Edwards Dinner Gift). The properties are all today operated under the name Edwards Homes and run by Weymouth Town Charities who run the Sir Henry Edwards and the Sir Samuel Mico Charities.\nDeath\nEdwards died at his home at 53 Berkeley Square, London, after several months of illness. At the time of his death, he was lauded as the most generous benefactor in the history of Weymouth.\nCommemoration\nEdwards generosity in Weymouth is celebrated by a statue in Alexandra Gardens on the esplanade, facing north east across Weymouth Bay and the beach.\nThe book The Rival Queens, written in 1880 by prominent Weymouth resident Joseph Drew, was dedicated to him.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.weymouth-town-charities.org.uk/edwards.htm Weymouth Town Charities:] Sir Henry Edwards, with sketches and photographs"
