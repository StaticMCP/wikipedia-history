This was the nation's ninth appearance at the Olympics since its debut in 1968, although four of its appearances were under the name \"Zaire\", and the first appearance was under the name \"Congo Kinshasa\".\nFour athletes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo were selected to the team, 3 men and 1 woman, to compete only in athletics, boxing, and judo. Marathon runner Ilunga Mande Zatara was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Democratic Republic of Congo, however, has yet to win its first Olympic medal.\nOn the day after the closing ceremonies, four members from the national delegation were reported missing in London: judoka Cédric Mandembo and his coach Ibula Masengo, boxing coach Blaise Bekwa, and athletics coach Guy Nkita.\nAthletics\n;Men\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Ilunga Mande Zatara\n|align=left|Marathon\n|colspan=2|\n|}\n;Women\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Chancel Ilunga Sankuru\n|align=left|1500 m\n|5:05.25\n|14\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\nBoxing\nDR Congo qualified one boxer for the Games; Meji Mwamba competed in the men's super heavyweight division.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!Round of 16\n!Quarterfinals\n!Semifinals\n!colspan=2|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!width=50|Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Meji Mwamba\n|align=left|Men's super heavyweight\n|L\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\nJudo\nDR Congo qualified a single judoka.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!Round of 32\n!Round of 16\n!Quarterfinals\n!Semifinals\n!Repechage\n!colspan=2|Final /\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Cédric Mandembo\n|align=left|Men's +100 kg\n|L 0000–0100\n|colspan=6|Did not advance\n|}\nSee also\n* DR Congo at the 2012 Summer Paralympics\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
