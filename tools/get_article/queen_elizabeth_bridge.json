The bridge was completed in 1966, and has formed the principal road route between Windsor and Slough since 1970, when structural cracks in the nearby Windsor Bridge forced that bridge's closure to all motorised traffic.\nSee also\n*Crossings of the River Thames\nReferences\nExternal links\n* The Royal Windsor website.
