He later studied at Jesus College at the University of Cambridge, and prior to his matriculation he had been commissioned into the Wiltshire Regiment Militia as a lieutenant in May 1871. He later served in the Rifle Brigade, in which he was promoted to captain in April 1882. As a cricketer, Crofton made his debut in first-class cricket for Hampshire against Sussex at Southampton in 1881. He made two further appearances for Hampshire in 1881, both against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's and Southampton.\nCrofton died in Dublin on 15 May 1882, from typhoid fever. He was survived by his wife, who he had married at Christ Church in Folkestone in October 1877. His brother, Morgan, succeeded their uncle as the 4th Baronet of the Crofton Baronets of Mohill in 1867. He later died without issue, with the baronetcy being succeeded in 1900 by Crofton's son, Hugh.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
