It was formed in September 1914 as part of the new army also known as Kitchener's Army and was assigned to the 20th (Light) Division, serving in the trenches of the Western Front. It was reformed as a motorised infantry brigade in Italy during the Second World War.\nWorld War I\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The new Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six infantry divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. Recruits continued to arrive in large numbers, and Army Order No 382 of 11 September authorised a further six divisions (15th – 20th), which became the Second New Army (K2). 20th (Light) Division began forming at Aldershot with the 59th, 60th and 61st Brigades, initially composed entirely of service battalions from light infantry and rifle regiments.\nOrder of battle\n61st Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:\n* 7th (Service) Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry\n* 7th (Service) Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry\n* 7th (Service) Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (disbanded 20 February 1918)\n* 11th (Service) Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (left to become divisional pioneers 6 January 1915)\n* 12th (Service) Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (joined from attached Army Troops 6 January 1915)\n* 61st Company, Machine Gun Corps (joined 3 March 1916, moved to 20th Divisional Machine Gun Battalion 15 March 1918)\n* 61st Trench Mortar Battery (formed as 61/1 and 61/2 by 4 May 1916, became single battery by 12 June 1916)\nService\nThe 20th (Light) Division crossed to France in July 1915 and completed its concentration in the area west of Saint-Omer by 26 July.
