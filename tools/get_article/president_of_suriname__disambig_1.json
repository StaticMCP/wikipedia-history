The president also appoints a cabinet.\nThe current president is Jennifer Geerlings-Simons, a former chairwoman of the National Assembly. She is affiliated with the National Democratic Party (NDP). Simons was elected on 6 July 2025 as president by acclamation, and inaugurated on 16 July on the Onafhankelijkheidsplein in Paramaribo in a ceremony.\nHistory\nThe office of president was created upon independence from the Netherlands in 1975. Until 1987, the presidency was mostly a ceremonial post, discharging most of the functions previously vested in the monarchy of the Netherlands. For all intents and purposes, real power was vested in the prime minister.\nThe first officeholder was Johan Ferrier, a schoolteacher and veteran politician who had served as governor since 1968. He resigned as president in August 1980, several months after a coup d'état. From then until 1988, the presidents were essentially army-installed puppets of army commander Dési Bouterse, who ruled as a de facto military dictator with few practical checks on his power.\nBouterse allowed multiparty elections in 1987, shortly after the current constitution was approved in a referendum. The presidency became an executive post, with duties and responsibilities similar to those of presidents in semi-presidential republics. On 24 December 1990, two days after Bouterse's resignation as army commander, the army called president Ramsewak Shankar to inform him that he and his cabinet were removed from office, in another coup d'état; police chief and acting army commander Ivan Graanoogst was appointed acting president. On 27 December 1990, Johannes Kraag became the president. The army returned power to civilians in 1991, and the president has been freely elected ever since.\nElection\nThe president and a vice president are elected by no less than a two-thirds supermajority of members in the National Assembly to a five-year mandate and are accountable to the Assembly. During their time in office, the president must forfeit any additional posts in politics or business.\nQualification\nA candidate must be a Surinamese national (resident in the country for at least six years) who is at least 30 years of age.  A candidate must win at least two-thirds of the votes in the Assembly to be elected.  If no candidate wins two-thirds after three rounds, the vote then goes to the United People's Congress, composed of the Assembly and local government officials. In this case, a simple majority is required.\nPowers and duties\nThe president is vested with extensive functional powers. The president names and dismisses ministers, signs bills, and names and dismisses diplomatic staff. She declares war and states of emergency with the ratification of the National Assembly. She concludes foreign treaties and agreements, again with the assent of the Assembly. She also exercises ceremonial duties such as conferring awards, receiving foreign diplomats, and granting pardons.\nList of presidents\n;Political parties\n|National Party of Suriname (NPS)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Nationalist Republican Party (PNR)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Progressive Reform Party (VHP)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|National Democratic Party (NDP)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Independent|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3|President\n! colspan=3|Term of office\n! rowspan=2|Political party\n! rowspan=2|Vice president(s)\n|-\n!\n!
