The Queensland government blocked the public release of a report, which recommended that gas wells in floodplains in the western Queensland channel country should be excluded and that unconventional  petroleum should be designated as an unacceptable use in the area.\nLegislation\nClean Economy Jobs Act 2024\nThe Act requires Queensland to cut emissions by 30% on 2005 levels by 2030, 75% by 2035 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. The Act also entrenches public ownership of energy assets.\nThe bill had been supported by the Liberal National Party opposition. There had been speculation that the LNP would not support the bill, and they had wanted to consider modelling on the impacts of the policy before they made their final decision.\nSee also\n* Climate change in Australia\nReferences"
