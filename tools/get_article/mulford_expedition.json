It was organized by Henry Hurd Rusby, who at age 64, was a well known explorer, a professor at Columbia University, and a staff member at the New York Botanical Garden. He hired Orland Emile White, a staff member at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, to assist with collection and handling of plant specimens. The expedition was financed by the H. K. Mulford Company, a pharmaceutical company.\nIts mission was to explore the Amazon valley from the headwaters of the Quime River in Bolivia to the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil. The expedition left La Paz, Bolivia, in July 1921. Rusby was forced to leave the expedition due to neuritis, an infected tooth, and his age; however, White and Martín Cárdenas continued to collect. The expedition lasted eight months, and never reached the Amazon.\nExpedition\nNews from 1921:\n}}\nThe expedition leaves the field in March 1922:\nstopping for weeks at a time to collect in Huachi and Rurrenabaque. In December, Rusby was forced to leave the expedition due to ill health, traveling alone down the river until he was rescued by a government patrol boat. Before he left, he hired Martín Cárdenas, then a student, to assist with collecting. White and Cárdenas continued collecting in the lowlands of Eastern Bolivia, making extensive collections near Tumupasa, Ixiamas, Lago Rogagua, Ivon, and Cachuela Esperanza. The botanists never reached the Amazon, but headed home from Cachuela Esperanza, Bolivia, in mid-March, 1922, after eight months in the field.}}\nResults\nThe botanists returned with over 2,400 collections representing more than 1,500 species of plant life.  Their collections included a large amount of orchids, termites, economic plants and seeds.  Rusby worked through most of the samples himself identifying six new genera and 257 new species.  The main collection from the expedition are located at the New York Botanical Garden and at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nDuring the expedition, Gordon MacCreagh wrote a book about its trials and tribulations. White Waters and Black was published in 1923.\nMembers\n* Henry Hurd Rusby, director\n* William M.
