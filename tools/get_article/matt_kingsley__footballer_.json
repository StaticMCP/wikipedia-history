Kingsley departed West Ham after kicking former West Ham player Herbert Lyon in a game against Brighton & Hove Albion in March 1905, causing a crowd invasion and a near riot.\nInternational career\nIn 1901 he became the first player to receive a call-up to the England national team whilst at Newcastle. Kingsley played the full 90 minutes in a 6–0 victory for England against Wales in a British Home Championship at St James' Park on 18 March 1901.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.spartacus-educational.com/WHkingsleyM.htm Spartacus article]\n*"
