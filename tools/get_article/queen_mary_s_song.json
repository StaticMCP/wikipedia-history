      "text": "# Queen Mary's Song\n\n\"'''Queen Mary's Song'\" is a song written by the English composer Edward Elgar in 1889. The words are by Tennyson, sung by Queen Mary I of England as she plays a lute in scene 2, act 5 of his 1875 play Queen Mary: A Drama.\nIt was composed between 14 June and 1 July 1889, and dedicated to J. H. Meredith, an honorary member of the Worcester Amateur Instrumental Society.\nThe song was first published by Osborn & Tuckwood in 1889, then by Ascherberg in 1892. It was re-published in 1907 as one of the Seven Lieder'', with English and German words. The German translator, one unidentified Ed. Sachs, named the song \"\", confusing the Stuart Mary, Queen of Scots with the Tudor Mary I of England.\nLyrics\nWords used by Tennyson\nHapless doom of woman happy in betrothing!\nBeauty passes like a breath and love is lost in loathing:\nLow, my lute; speak low, my lute, but say the world is nothing -\nLow, lute, low!\nLove will hover round the flowers when they first awaken;\nLove will fly the fallen leaf, and not be overtaken;\nLow, my lute! oh low, my lute! we fade and are forsaken -\nLow, dear lute, low!\nWords used by Elgar and German translation by Ed.
