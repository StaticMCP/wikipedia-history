Similar to Latifah's 1994 song \"Weekend Love\" and subsequently, her 1998 song, \"Paper\", this was one of Latifah's singles to feature only her singing, with no rap vocals. The song is anchored by a sample of Alicia Myers' 1981 proto-disco hit \"I Want To Thank You.\" The song originally appeared on the soundtrack to the film Nothing to Lose. The song was included on Latifah's 1998 album Order in the Court with slight changes.\nThe original version of \"It's Alright\" on the Nothing to Lose soundtrack features background vocals from Faith Evans, who co-wrote the song. However, the version of Latifah's album, Order in the Court, contains background vocals from the hip-hop artist Lil' Mo.\nTrack listing\n;US Vinyl Release\n:A1. \"It's Alright\" (Album Version) (3:31)\n:A2. \"It's Alright\" (Instrumental) (3:43)\n:B1. \"It's Alright\" (Remix) (4:23)\n:B2. \"It's Alright\" (A Capella) (3:21)\nReferences"
