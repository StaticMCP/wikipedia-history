With a strong focus on aesthetics, presentation, and a grassroots approach to marketing & advertising, FMG have carved out a niche for themselves in the Canadian musical landscape and maintained a close relationship to their fan base.\nForward regularly work with festivals and conferences such as Shivering Songs, the Halifax Jazz Festival, Nova Scotia Music Week and East Coast Music Week to program interesting and intimate events with a variety of musicians both from inside and outside their community. At the 2007 Evolve Festival, one stage, dubbed the \"Forward Music Group Stage,\" featured acts on the label alongside Do Make Say Think and Holy Fuck. At the 2012 festival, Forward programmed music for the yurt stage and staged theatrical performances during the day with fake security guards at the yurt entrance that provoked the public by shooting them with water guns.\nThey also operate a sister label called Backward Music for experimental music and work with NYC-based Bing & Ruth, Toronto producer/percussionist Joshua Van Tassel, and more.\nCurrent roster\n* Michael Feuerstack\n* Gianna Lauren\n* Joshua Van Tassel\n* JOYFULTALK\n* Paper Beat Scissors\n* Alan Jeffries\n* The Olympic Symphonium\n* Motherhood\n* Cedric Noel\n* Century Egg\n* Wolf Castle\n* Jennah Barry\n* Sarah Pagé\n* Nick Schofield\n* Charbonneau/Amato\n* Nico Paulo\nDiscography\n* Nico Paulo - Nico Paulo (2023)\n* Cedric Noel - Hang Time (2021)\n* Michael Feuerstack - Natural Weather (2018)\n* The Olympic Symphonium - Beauty in the Tension (2018)\n* Sleepless Nights - Crystal Mountains (2017)\n* Paper Beat Scissors - All We Know (2017)\n* Gianna Lauren - M o v i n g P a r t s (2017)\n* Dan Misha Goldman - Champion of the Afterworld (2017)\n* Michael Feuerstack - Adult Lullabies (2016)\n* Gianna Lauren - Windows - Single (2015)\n* Paper Beat Scissors - Go On (2015)\n* Paper Beat Scissors - Go On (2015)\n* Gianna Lauren - Mistakes - Single (2015)\n* Gypsophilia - Night Swimming (2015)\n* Forward Music Group 2015 Sampler (2015)\n* Find The Others - Empire of Time (2015)\n* Michael Feuerstack - The Forgettable Truth (2015)\n* Michael Feuerstack & Associates - Singer Songer (2014)\n* The Olympic Symphonium - Chance To Fate (2014)\n* The Olympic Symphonium - The City Won't Have Time To Remix (2014)\n* Gypsophilia - Horska (2013)\n* Michael Feuerstack - Tambourine Death Bed (2013)\n* Michael Feuerstack - Shadow / Wolves (2013)\n* Paper Beat Scissors - Tendrils / Live at St. Matthew's Church (2013)\n* Gianna Lauren - On Personhood (2013)\n* Alan Jeffries - Coffee 'Til Midnight (2013)\n* Forward Music Group 2013 Sampler (2013)\n* Grand Theft Bus - Say it With Me (2012)\n* Snailhouse - Lies On The Prize (2012)\n* The Olympic Symphonium - Southern Souls Sessions (2012)\n* Paper Beat Scissors - Paper Beat Scissors (2012)\n* Forward Music Group - Forward Xmas Remix 2011 (2011)\n* Forward Music Group - Forward Music Fall 2011 Sampler (2011)\n* Gypsophilia - Constellation (2011)\n* Snailhouse - Sentimental Gentleman (2011)\n* The Olympic Symphonium- The City Won't Have Time To Fight (2011)\n* The Olympic Symphonium - Live At The Cohn (2010)\n* Gianna Lauren - Some Move Closer, Some Move On (2010)\n* The Slate Pacific - Eccentrics and Young Professionals (2010)\n* Sleepless Nights - The Communications Barrier (2010)\n* The Olympic Symphonium - Chapter 1 (special revised edition) (2010)\n* The Slate Pacific - The Safe Passage Remix EP (2010)\n* Share - Coco et Co.
