After the war, he served as the naval aide to the President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and commanded the first submerged circumnavigation.\nBeach's best-selling novel, Run Silent, Run Deep, was made into the 1958 film of the same name. The son of Captain Edward L. Beach Sr. and Alice Fouché Beach, Beach Jr. was born in New York City and raised in Palo Alto, California.\nNaval career\nBeach was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1935 by Senator Hiram Johnson of California. Beach served as a regimental commander in his first class year. Beach was named as the midshipman who had done the most to promote naval spirit and loyalty in his regiment when he graduated second out of 576 in his class in 1939.\nBeach was initially assigned to the heavy cruiser , before joining the newly recommissioned destroyer , which participated in the neutrality patrol in the Atlantic, the escort of the German passenger liner , the initial American occupation of Iceland, and convoy duty in the North Atlantic.\nBeach was detached from Lea in September 1941 to undergo accelerated training at the Submarine Training School at the New London Submarine Base in Connecticut. He completed training, graduating first in his class, in December 1941 shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, Beach served aboard the submarines  and , and took command of  just as the Pacific War was ending.\nAfter graduating from Submarine School, Beach was assigned to USS Trigger (SS-237), which was commissioned on January 30, 1942.   Aboard Trigger Beach held several shipboard positions, including communications officer, engineering officer, navigator, co-approach officer, and executive officer.  While aboard Trigger, he participated in the Battle of Midway and served on 10 war patrols.  Trigger was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Navy Unit Citation during Beach's time aboard her.\nBeach was assigned to the new commissioned USS Tirante (SS-420) late in 1944.  He served as executive officer under Lieutenant Commander George L. Street, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for a making a daring attack in a heavily defended Japanese harbor during Tirantes first war patrol from March 3 to April 26, 1945.  Beach received the Navy Cross for heroism during the same patrol and Tirante received the Presidential Unit Citation. The patrol was featured in season 1, episode 11 of the TV series, \"The Silent Service\", and host and executive producer Thomas M. Dykers interviewed Beach and Street at the end of the episode.\nBeach assumed command of USS Piper (SS-409) at Pearl Harbor on June 25, 1945.  Piper departed on her third war patrol on July 19 and entered the Sea of Japan on August 13.  The war ended on August 14 and Piper was in Japanese waters when the formal surrender was signed on September 2 and started her return to Pearl Harbor the next day.\nDuring World War II, Beach earned 10 decorations for gallantry, including the Navy Cross and three unit citations, and participated in 12 war patrols that damaged or sank 45 enemy vessels.\nCold War\nIn December 1945, Beach reported to the Department of the Navy to serve as the personal aide to Vice Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, the chief of the Bureau of Naval Personnel.  In March 1947, he was attached to the Atomic Defense Section (OPNAV 36) under Rear Admiral William S. Parsons.\nUSS Amberjack\nIn May 1948, he was given command of , a GUPPY II modified submarine. Amberjack gained the nickname \"Anglejack\" because of its pioneering use of steep diving and surfacing angles, which was covered in the January 1950 edition of the National Geographic magazine.  During war games, Amberjack photographed the opposing task force's flagship through its periscope and sent the admiral a copy inscribed with \"Regards from Ned Beach and the Amberjack.\"\nJoint Chiefs of Staff\nBeach's tour as skipper of Amberjack was abbreviated as he was called to Washington to serve as naval aide to General Omar Bradley, the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in August 1949. In that post, Beach witnessed first hand the events surrounding the Revolt of the Admirals.\nUSS Trigger\nUpon completing his tour of duty as Bradley's aide in March 1951, Beach was named prospective commanding officer of the new , then under construction. Upon commissioning of Trigger II, which was named for  lost during World War II, he became commanding officer of the second submarine to be completed in the new  after World War II.\nThe White House\nFrom 1953 to 1957, Beach was naval aide to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  As naval aide Beach was responsible for the management of Camp David, the White House Mess, and for the presidential yacht . Because Eisenhower had made a campaign promise to get rid of the presidential yacht, neither the efforts of Beach nor those of Mrs. Eisenhower were successful in dissuading him from that course of action. The elimination of Williamsburg proved to be a bureaucratic hassle for Beach and the Navy Department since Williamsburg was the funnel for all budgets and personnel for Camp David and the White House Mess. While working the White House, Beach volunteered to be the coordinator on the White House staff for all plans to protect the president in case of nuclear attack. Since the Secret Service in 1953 did not deem helicopter travel as safe, evacuating the president on short notice was planned by Beach via the Potomac River, several PT (patrol torpedo) boats and a high speed race down river to meet up with a waiting Navy ship.  It was Beach who spearheaded the effort to get First Lady Mamie Eisenhower to christen , the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, in 1954.\nBeach was advanced to the rank of captain on October 1, 1956.\nUSS Salamonie\nBeach left the White House in January 1957, and assumed command of , a  fleet replenishment oiler, on March 15.  He completed a deployment to the U.S. Sixth Fleet, operating in the Mediterranean Sea, in December 1957.\nUSS Triton\nIn January 1958, he attended the Navy's training program for atomic reactors in order to qualify for his next command, , the nation's fifth nuclear-powered submarine.\nIn November 1959, Beach took command of USS Triton, the only American nuclear-powered submarine to be equipped with two nuclear reactors. Departing New London on what was supposed to have been a \"shake-down\" cruise in February 1960, Triton began a 1960 circumnavigation of the Earth in 84 days without surfacing, covering over , an unprecedented feat. The route of Triton followed roughly that of Ferdinand Magellan in 1519–1522. The scientific and military significance of the Triton voyage was overshadowed by the U-2 Incident which broke just as USS Triton was returning.\nFor successfully completing its mission, Triton was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.  At a special White House ceremony, Captain Beach was presented the Legion of Merit by President Eisenhower.  Beach wrote about Tritons voyage in his book Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton, published in 1962.\nFollowing her post-shakedown availability, Triton deployed to European waters with the Second Fleet to participate in NATO exercises against British naval forces led by the aircraft carriers  and  under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Charles Madden.  This deployment was culminated with a port visit to Bremerhaven, West Germany, the first visit by a nuclear-powered ship to a European port.\nSubron 8, National War College and OpNav\nAfter his tour in command of Triton, Beach commanded Submarine Squadron Eight from July 1961 to August 1962. He was next a student at the National War College, where he completed a course of study in July 1963.  At the same time he earned a Master of Arts degree in international relations from George Washington University.\nIn May 1963, Eugene Parks Wilkinson and Beach were in competition for selection to rear admiral, and the board selected Wilkinson with Beach's sincere congratulations.\nFrom July 1963 to December 1966, Beach served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav) preparing annual budget reports for Congress and preparing the Secretary of the Navy (Fred Korth, Paul B. Fay, and Paul H. Nitze) and the Chief of Naval Operations (George W. Anderson Jr. and David L. McDonald) for hearings before Congressional committees.\nBeach retired from active duty with the rank of captain in 1966, after 27 years of service.\nNaval War College and Capitol Hill\nBeach retired from active duty in the Navy in 1966, and was appointed as the Stephen B. Luce Chair of Naval Science at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island&nbsp;– the first person to hold that position. During his tenure he was the editor of the Naval War College Review.\nSubsequently, Beach served for seven years as staff director of the United States Senate Republican Policy Committee, and for one year as chief of staff for Senator Jeremiah Denton (R-Alabama).\nAuthor\nAfter World War II, Beach wrote extensively in his spare time, following his father, who was also a career naval officer and author. His first book, Submarine! (1952), was a compilation of accounts of several wartime patrols made by his own as well as other submarines, which Time magazine called \"the liveliest and most authentic account of underseas combat to come out of World War II.\"\nIn all, Beach published thirteen books, but is best known for his first novel, Run Silent, Run Deep (1955), which appeared on The New York Times Book Review bestseller list for several months.  A movie of the same name, based loosely on the novel and starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster, was released by United Artists in 1958 (Beach was unhappy with the adaptation). Beach penned two sequels to Run Silent, Run Deep: Dust on the Sea (1972), relating in detail a war patrol by Eel leading a wolfpack, and Cold is the Sea (1978), set in 1961 aboard a nuclear submarine.\nIn addition to Submarine!, Beach wrote several more books on naval history, including The Wreck of the Memphis (1966); United States Navy: 200 Years (1986), a general history of the Navy; Scapegoats: A Defense of Kimmel and Short at Pearl Harbor (1995); and Salt and Steel: Reflections of a Submariner (1999). Keepers of the Sea (1983) is a pictorial record of the modern navy with photography by Fred J. Maroon. For a number of years Beach was co-editor of Naval Terms Dictionary as that standard reference work passed through several editions. His last work, completed shortly before his death, was to prepare for publication his father's manuscript of his own naval career, From Annapolis to Scapa Flow: The Autobiography of Edward L. Beach Sr (2003).\nIn addition to his books, Beach was a prolific author of articles and book reviews for periodicals ranging from Blue Book to National Geographic, and Naval History to American Heritage.\nBibliography\nFiction:\n*Run Silent, Run Deep (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1955)\n*Dust on the Sea (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1972)\n*Cold is the Sea (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1978)\nMemoirs:\n*From Annapolis to Scapa Flow: The Autobiography of Edward L.
