It was established in 1981–82 in memory of Verity Bargate, the co-founder of Soho Poly, precursor to Soho Theatre.\nIt is open to writers based in the United Kingdom and Ireland and it is recognised as one of the oldest and most prestigious playwriting prizes of its kind. Since its formation it has been an important springboard for the careers of some of Britain's most established playwrights and screenwriters.\nAs of 2024, the winning playwright receives £8,000 for an exclusive option for Soho Theatre to produce the prize-winning play.
