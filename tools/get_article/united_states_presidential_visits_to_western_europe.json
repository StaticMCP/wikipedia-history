      "text": "# United States presidential visits to Western Europe\n\nThirteen United States presidents have made presidential visits to Western Europe.}} The first visits by an incumbent president to countries in Western Europe were made in 1918 and 1919 by Woodrow Wilson in the aftermath of World War I. He was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for his peacemaking efforts.  Visits occurring during the 1940s through 1980s were offshoots of American diplomatic interactions following World War II and during the Cold War. To date, 41 visits have been made to France, 32 to Germany (including 10 specifically to West Germany or West Berlin), 21 to Belgium, 11 to Switzerland, six to Austria, and five to the Netherlands. No president has yet visited Liechtenstein, Luxembourg or Monaco.\nTable of visits\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Dates\n!Countries\n!Locations\n!Key details\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Woodrow Wilson\n|\n|rowspan=4|\n|Paris,Chaumont\n|Attended preliminary discussions prior to the Paris Peace Conference; promoted his Fourteen Points principles for world peace.
