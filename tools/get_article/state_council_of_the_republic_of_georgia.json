On January 5, Eduard Shevardnadze offered to help the country. He arrived in Georgia on March 7, 1992. It was at this time that the temporary structure of governing the country began to be developed. It was this structure that was to lead the country until the next parliamentary elections. The working version of the name of the structure was \"Civil Salvation Committee\". After consultations and analysis, the final name of the structure was chosen as the \"State Council\".\nOn March 10, the Military Council handed over power to the State Council of the Republic of Georgia and self-liquidated. At the first meeting of the initial composition of the State Council, the full composition of the members  was determined on the basis of a broad coalition consensus (through consultations with political parties).  On March 10, Eduard Shevardnadze was approved as the Chairman of the State Council. Jaba Ioseliani was approved as his deputy. The Presidium of the State Council of the Republic of Georgia was established. The first meeting of the State Council of the Republic of Georgia was held on March 11.\nThe State Council reorganized and reunited the army. The Ministry of Security was replaced by an intelligence service that had limited interception of citizens. The council demanded the registration of all weapons and the nationalization of Soviet military property, although the Russian army ignored the council's request and sold or destroyed equipment that could not be delivered in Russia. On August 2, the Council of State issued a \"Manifesto of Reconciliation\" and pardoned all political prisoners detained from January to June 1992, although Gamsakhurdia was not pardoned. The council lifted the state of emergency in Tbilisi in August.\nOn October 16, before self-liquidation, the State Council passed an election law requiring parliamentary elections and the formation of a three-year transitional parliament.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
