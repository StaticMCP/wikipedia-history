Home Forward maintains properties in Portland, Gresham, and Fairview.\nHistory\nThe Housing Authority of Portland (HAP) was created by the Portland City Council on December 11, 1941. The city council created the agency in response to a massive influx of people who came to work at shipyards in the Portland area during World War II. HAP developed several housing projects over the course of the war, including Guild's Lake Courts and Columbia Villa. Vanport, the largest wartime housing development, was constructed independently by the Kaiser Company, although management of the development was later taken over by HAP. By 1942, HAP developments housed approximately 72,000 people, making it the largest housing authority in the United States.\nHAP began using the name \"Home Forward\" in May 2011.\nGovernance\nHome Forward is led by a nine-member board of commissioners. All board members are volunteers who serve staggered four-year terms. Four commissioners are recommended by the City of Portland, two are recommended by the City of Gresham, two are recommended by Multnomah County, and one is recommended by the residents of Home Forward developments. The recommended board members are appointed by the Mayor of Portland and confirmed by the Portland City Council.\nSee also\n* Louisa Flowers, the namesake of a housing development by Home Forward\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
