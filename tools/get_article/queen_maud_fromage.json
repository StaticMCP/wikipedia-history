Named after Queen Maud of Norway, daughter of King Edward VII, the dessert was developed and introduced in Haugesund municipality, and presented to Queen Maud and King Haakon during their coronation expedition in 1906, and was eventually named in honour of their visit. The dessert is commonly consumed in the western region of Norway.\nSee also\n* List of Norwegian desserts\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Tine.no: [http://www.tine.no/oppskrifter/desserter/fromasj-og-mousse/dronning-maud-fromasj-haugesunddessert Dronning Maud fromasj (Haugesunddessert)]"
