Central purchasing bodies are also known as \"Public Buying Organisations\" (PBOs). In May 2010 the National Audit Office estimated that there were just under 50 public buying organisations in the UK.\nBackground\nA \"central purchasing body” is defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 as \"a contracting authority which provides centralised purchasing activities and which may also provide ancillary purchasing activities\". The role of a central purchasing body, as defined in Regulation 37 of the regulations, is to support \"the acquisition of supplies or services, or both, intended for contracting authorities\", and \"the award of public contracts or the conclusion of framework agreements [or dynamic purchasing systems] for works, supplies or services intended for contracting authorities\". The definitions are derived from Articles 2(1)(14) and 37 of the European Union's Directive on Public Procurement, Directive 2014/24/EU, transposed into UK legislation in 2015. Similar organisations can be found in other EU Member States, for instance Hansel Ltd. in Finland and Consip in Italy.\nThe EU rules provide that a contracting authority may use the services of a central purchasing body located in another Member State, and should do so in accordance with the national procurement rules which apply where the central purchasing body is located.\nIn the UK, central government organisations are required by HM Treasury guidance to use the Government Procurement Service (Crown Commercial Service) in its capacity as a central purchasing body.\nOrganisations\n*Advanced Procurement for Universities and Colleges (APUC), established in 2007, provides central procurement services and expertise for the universities and colleges of Scotland.

ESPO is one of four organisations which serve the local authorities of England and Wales, along with the Yorkshire Purchasing Organisation, North Eastern Purchasing Organisation and the Central Buying Consortium. A fifth consortium, West Mercia Supplies (WMS), now called Consortium Education, was based in the West Midlands but after being purchased by a private sector company it lost its status as a public sector consortium. The five consortia collectively operated under the name Pro5, until WMS ceased to be part of the public sector. \"ESPO\" is the trading name of a joint committee of these six local authorities established under the Local Government Act 1972 (section 101 (5) and section 102) and section 9EB of the Local Government Act 2000.
