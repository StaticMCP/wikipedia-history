      "text": "# The Battle Hymn of the Republic, Updated\n\n\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic, Updated\" (otherwise known as \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic (Brought Down to Date)\") was written in 1900 by Mark Twain, as a parody of American imperialism, in the wake of the Philippine–American War.  It is written in the same tune and cadence as the original \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" by Julia Ward Howe. The poem remained unpublished in Twain's lifetime and did not appear in print until 1958.\nA recording was made by the Chad Mitchell Trio as \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic Brought Down to Date\". The lyrics were slightly modified and the verse about prostitution excised, and the first four lines from the Marines' Hymn sung over one of the choruses.\nLyrics\nFootnote\nThe footnote in the lyrics contained the following text:\n\"* NOTE: In Manila the Government has placed a certain industry under the protection of our flag. (M.T.)\"\nSee also\n*List of anti-war songs\n*Battle Hymn of the Republic\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/twain/notkill.htm Sacred Texts website]\n*[http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/BattleHymnoftheRepublic.htm Origins of a Civil War Song]"
