The group name originated from the word , which the members had intended as a hyperbole of having their audience \"pee themselves\" from the shock of seeing their performance; however, as the word is considered profanity in Japanese, they opted to use a word from a different language that would express a similar meaning. In 2010, several members performed as back-up dancers in BoA's Christmas concert. From 2010 to 2011, they were winners of the American dance contest, Body Rock, for two years in a row. Over the course of their career, they have choreographed for Japanese and South Korean artists including AAA, Winds, Daichi Miura, various groups from Johnny & Associates, TVXQ, Shinee, and Exo.\nIn 2016, Shit Kingz performed in their self-produced stage play Wonderful Clunker, to which Daichi Miura performed on the soundtrack. In 2018, they performed their stage play, The Library, with 30 shows in seven locations. They released their first album of the same name independently on December 7, 2018, with music produced by them. In 2019, they choreographed the dance in the ending sequence of the anime Business Fish.\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n!
