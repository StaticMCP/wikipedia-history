(1988), for which she was nominated for a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award and Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen.\nIn the 1990s, Kanwar took a long break from television and films before returning to play the character of Inspector KC, Chief of Homicide in the 1998 Star Plus crime series Saboot. In spite of garnering critical acclaim for her performances, she did not get roles of substance in films and was a victim of typecasting. \"Such a tender, sensitive actress with the potential of Nargis! She finally ran away to Shimla,\" noted singer and actress Ila Arun said about Kanwar.\nKanwar lives in Gurgaon, near Delhi.\nFilmography\nFilms\n* Dostana (1980)\n*Aadharshila (1982)\n*Spandan (1982)\n*Mandi (1983)\n*Janam (1985)\n*Trikaal (1985) - Sylvia (Anna's mother)\n*Mati Manas (1986)\n*Sheela (1986)\n*Amrit (1986)\n*Kabhi Door Kabhi Paas Segment:Do Behna (Two Sisters) (1986–87)\n*Susman (1987)\n*Dacait (1987)\n*Razia (1988)\n*Om Dar-Ba-Dar (1988)\n*Tumare Sahare (1988)\n*Salaam Bombay!
