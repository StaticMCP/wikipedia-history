Unlike the aforementioned formats, Renaissance can generate interfaces that can be run without modification on either GNUstep or Mac OS X. It also uses a feature called AutoLayout, which means that localized strings do not have to be manually resized.\nAs of January 2006, GNUstep Renaissance is beta software. A graphical frontend to Renaissance does not yet exist. A stable release has not been made since 2008, though the downloadable binary has not been rebuilt and is still the previous version.\nExample\nA simple example of an interface specification:\nHello, World\nAssuming this file is in the application bundle and named , it can be loaded with the following Objective-C code:\n[NSBundle loadGSMarkupNamed:@\"Sample\" owner:self];\nSoftware using Renaissance\n* Zipper\nSee also\n* Gorm - GNUstep Graphical Object Relationship Manager (also UI builder)\n* Interface Builder - Mac OS X and former NextStep Graphical Object Relationship Manager and UI builder\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030305144731/http://www.gnustep.it/Renaissance/ GNUstep Renaissance] home web site"
