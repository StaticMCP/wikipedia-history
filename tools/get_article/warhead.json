This energy can be released quickly by a trigger, such as an electric spark. Thermobaric weapons enhance the blast effect by utilizing the surrounding atmosphere in their explosive reactions.\n***Blast: A strong shock wave is provided by the detonation of the explosive.\n***Fragmentation: Metal fragments are projected at high velocity to cause damage or injury.\n***Continuous rod: Metal bars welded on their ends form a compact cylinder of interconnected rods, which is violently expanded into a contiguous zig-zag-shaped ring by an explosive detonation. The rapidly expanding ring produces a planar cutting effect that is devastating against military aircraft, which may be designed to be resistant to shrapnel.\n***Shaped charge: The effect of the explosive charge is focused onto a specially shaped metal liner to project a hypervelocity jet of metal, to perforate heavy armour.\n****Explosively formed penetrator: Instead of turning a thin metal liner into a focused jet, the detonation wave is directed against a concave metal plate at the front of the warhead, propelling it at high velocity while simultaneously deforming it into a projectile.\n**Nuclear: A runaway nuclear fission (fission bomb) or nuclear fusion (Thermonuclear weapon) reaction causes immense energy release.\n*Chemical: A toxic chemical, such as poison gas or nerve gas, is dispersed, which is designed to injure or kill human beings.\n*Biological: An infectious agent, such as anthrax spores, is dispersed, which is designed to sicken or kill humans.\nOften, a biological or chemical warhead will use an explosive charge for rapid dispersal and enhanced damage.\nDetonators\nExplosive warheads contain detonators to trigger the explosion.\nTypes of detonators include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Type\n!Definition\n|-\n|Contact\n|When the warhead makes physical contact with the target, the explosive is detonated. Sometimes combined with a delay, to detonate a specific amount of time after contact.\n|-\n|Proximity\n|Using radar, sonar, a magnetic sensor, or a laser, the warhead is detonated when the target is within a specified distance. It is often coupled with directional explosion control system that ensures that the explosion sends the fragmentation primarily towards the target that triggered it.\n|-\n|Timed\n|Warhead is detonated after a specific amount of time.\n|-\n|Altitude\n|Warhead is detonated once it falls to a specified altitude, usually in an air burst.\n|-\n|Remote\n|Remotely detonated via signal from operator. (Not normally used for warheads except for self-destruction)\n|-\n|Combined\n|Any combination of the above.\n|}\nSee also\n*Guidance system\n*List of aircraft weapons\n*List of missiles\n*Nuclear weapon yield\n*Missile\nReferences\n#\n#\n#\n#Stephen I.
