It also promoted and collaborated with the elaboration of a global survey of physicists that was carried on by the  Statistical Research Center of the American Institute of Physics. The IUPAP Working Group is currently involved in the elaboration of a new survey that will include other natural sciences and mathematics within the framework of the Gender Gap in Science Project funded by the International Council for Science, ICSU.\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://iupap.org/working-groups/wg5-women-in-physics/ IUPAP Working Group website]\n*[http://wgwip.df.uba.ar/ Working Group website]"
