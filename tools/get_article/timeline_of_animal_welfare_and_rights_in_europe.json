Period !! Description\n|-\n|600 BCE – 200||In ancient Greece and Rome, a number of philosophers advocate for vegetarianism and kindness towards animals, while the use of vivisection – operations on live animals – as a scientific tool spreads.\n|-\n|1600–1800||Philosophers take up the question of animals and their treatment, with some arguing that they are sentient beings who deserve protection. The first known modern animal protection law is passed in Ireland.\n|-\n|1800–1870||The first national animal welfare law is enacted in the United Kingdom, followed by laws in Germany, Switzerland, France, and Sweden.  These laws are largely concerned with public mistreatment of animals as a violation of decency, rather than the suffering of the animals themselves.  The first animal protection society is founded in the UK, followed by organizations in Germany and Switzerland.\n|-\n|1870–1914||The anti-vivisection movement takes hold in the UK, where the first legislation to regulate animal experimentation is passed.  European anti-vivisectionists and moderate animal protectionists clash, with little significant legislation on animal experimentation appearing outside England, and interest in anti-vivisection waning by World War I.  Animal protection societies in Scandinavia and Germany push for humane slaughter regulations.  European animal protection societies begin to shift  from opposing animal cruelty as a harm to property and public morals, to opposing animal cruelty as a harm to the animal itself.\n|-\n|1914–1970||The number of European countries with national animal welfare laws grows.  The number of animals raised and killed for food increases dramatically with the advent of intensive animal agriculture  The number of animal used in research also increases significantly with the growth of scientific and medical research.\n|-\n|1970–2016||Meat consumption continues to rise.  Countries continue to enact legislation regulating the use and treatment of animals in agriculture and science, with several recognizing animals as sentient beings deserving of basic protections.  A number of international agreements are adopted, culminating in measures by the European Union (EU) to recognize animals as sentient beings whose basic needs should be provided for; ban battery cages, veal crates, and gestation crates; and to regulate and monitor animal agriculture and experimentation in various other ways.\n|}\nFull timeline\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! Year !! Event !! Location\n|-\n|c. 530 BCE|| Greek philosopher Pythagoras is the first in a line of several Greek and Roman philosophers to teach that animals have souls and advocate for vegetarianism. ||Ancient Greece\n|-\n|100s||Greek medical researcher and philosopher Galen's experiments on live animals help establish vivisection as a widely used scientific tool. ||Rome\n|-\n|Early 1600s|| Philosopher and scientist René Descartes argues that animals are machines without feeling, and performs biological experiments on living animals. ||Netherlands\n|-\n|1635|| The Parliament of Ireland passes An Act against Plowing by the Tayle, and pulling the Wooll off living Sheep, one of the first known pieces of animal protection legislation. ||Ireland\n|-\n|1751||William Hogarth paints The Four Stages of Cruelty, which depicts children committing cruelty against animals progressing into adults who commit cruelty against other humans. ||England\n|-\n|1754||Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argues against the mistreatment of animals on the grounds that they are \"sensitive beings\" and advocates for vegetarianism. ||Geneva\n|-\n|1764||Philosopher Voltaire writes Beasts, a short essay denouncing the mechanistic view of animals. ||France\n|-\n|1780||In An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation  philosopher Jeremy Bentham argues for better treatment of animals on the basis of their ability to feel pleasure and pain, famously writing, \"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\". ||England\n|-\n|1785||Philosopher Immanuel Kant argues that animals are not ends-in-themselves, but that in abusing animals we fail in our duties to other people by damaging our humanity. ||Prussia\n|-\n|1822|| Led by Richard Martin, the British Parliament passes the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822. ||United Kingdom\n|-\n|1824|| Richard Martin, along with Reverend Arthur Broome and abolitionist Member of Parliament William Wilberforce, founds the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (now the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), the world's first animal protection organization. ||United Kingdom\n|-\n|1830s||Early vegan and anti-vivisectionist Lewis Gompertz leaves the SPCA to found the Animals' Friend Society, opposing all uses of animals which are not for their benefit. ||England\n|-\n|1835|| After many similar bills had failed over the previous three decades, the British Parliament passes its first Cruelty to Animal Act, outlawing blood sports. ||United Kingdom\n|-\n|1837||The first German animal protection society is founded. ||Stuttgart\n|-\n|1838||The Kingdom of Saxony enacts the first law against animal cruelty in Germany. ||Saxony\n|-\n|1842||The Swiss Canton of Schaffhausen introduces the first law against animal cruelty in Switzerland.||Schaffhausen\n|-\n|1844||The first Swiss animal protection society is founded. ||Bern\n|-\n|1847||The term \"vegetarian\" is coined and the British Vegetarian Society is founded. ||England\n|-\n|1850||France passes law criminalizing the public mistreatment of animals.  ||France\n|-\n|1857||Sweden enacts its Criminal Law, which includes statutes against animal cruelty.  Unlike most contemporary European penal statutes, the Swedish law penalizes cruelty towards an animal regardless of its property aspects. ||Sweden\n|-\n|1859||Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species is published, demonstrating that humans are the evolutionary descendants of non-human animals. ||England\n|-\n|1870s onward|| European animal protection advocates begin to focus less on animal cruelty as a harm to property and public morals, and more on animal cruelty as a harm to the animal itself.  For instance, Germany's Animal Protection Society calls for the expansion of laws so that \"the animal itself be protected and not only out of regard for the public\". ||\n|-\n|By 1871||All German states except Lübeck have regulations against animal cruelty. ||Germany\n|-\n|1875||Frances Power Cobbe founds the British National Anti-Vivisection Society, the world's first anti-vivisection organization. ||England\n|-\n|1876||After lobbying from anti-vivisectionists, the UK passes the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876, the first piece of national legislation to regulate animal experimentation. ||United Kingdom\n|-\n|1877||Anna Sewell's Black Beauty, the first English novel to be written from the perspective of a non-human animal, spurs concern for the welfare of horses. Although the book is now considered a children's classic, Sewell originally wrote it for those who worked with horses. She said \"a special aim was to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses\". In many respects the book can be read as a guide to horse husbandry, stable management and humane training practices for colts. It is considered to have had an effect on reducing cruelty to horses; for example, the use of bearing reins, which are particularly painful for a horse, was one of the practices highlighted in the novel, and in the years after the book's release the reins became less popular and fell out of favor.||England\n|-\n|1877||Spain passes its first anti-cruelty provision, which prohibits the maltreatment of dogs. ||Spain\n|-\n|1878–1879||Responding to the moderate positions taken by the German animal protection organizations on animal experimentation,  Marie Espérance von Schwartz, Ernst Georg Friedrich Grysanowski, and Ernst von Weber begin to form a dedicated anti-vivisection movement in Germany. Von Weber distributes a highly successful pamphlet, winning the support of Richard Wagner. ||Germany\n|-\n|1879||Anti-vivisectionists clash with moderate animal protectionists at the German Animal Protection Congress, leading von Weber and von Schwartz to found the International Society for Combat Against Scientific Torture of Animals, which receives financial support from Wagner.||Germany\n|-\n|Early 1880s||Political debates on the regulation of animal experimentation take place in Germany, resulting in a government inquiry into the need for regulation.  A significant majority of German animal protection societies oppose the abolition of vivisection.||Germany\n|-\n|1882||The Swedish Nordic Association (now Djurens Rätt, or Animal Rights) is founded to oppose cruelty to animals in science. ||Sweden\n|-\n|1886||The Germany Society for the Protection of Animals petitions the Reichstag to regulate slaughterhouses, initiating a national debate over slaughter regulation in Germany.  By this time there are already nearly 100 public slaughterhouses controlled by local ordinances, including those against unnecessary cruelty. ||Germany\n|-\n|Late 1880s-early 1890s||German anti-vivisectionists fail to achieve national regulations on animal experimentation, and interest in anti-vivisection wanes. ||Germany\n|-\n|1891|| Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish animal protection societies publish an appeal for humane slaughter. ||Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\n|-\n|1892||Social reformer Henry Salt publishes ''Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress'', an early exposition of the philosophy of animal rights. ||England\n|-\n|1903–1910||The Brown Dog affair brings anti-vivisection to the forefront of public debate in the UK. ||England\n|-\n|1928||The Criminal Code of 1928 is the first Spanish law to incriminate abuse of domestic animals in general. ||Spain\n|-\n|1944||Donald Watson coins the word \"vegan\" and founds The Vegan Society in the UK. ||England\n|-\n|1950||Denmark passes its Animal Protection Law. ||Denmark\n|-\n|Early 1950s||Willem van Eelen recognizes the possibility of generating meat from tissue culture. ||Netherlands\n|-\n|1950s||Intensive animal farming begins in the UK, driving a massive increase in the number of animals raised and slaughtered for food.\n|-\n|1959||France issues decree incriminating the maltreatment of domestic or captive animals. ||France\n|-\n|1961||Netherlands passes its Animal Protection Act. ||Netherlands\n|-\n|1964||The Hunt Saboteurs Association is founded to sabotage hunts and oppose bloodsports. ||England\n|-\n|1964||Ruth Harrison's Animal Machines, which documents the conditions of animals on industrial farms, helps to galvanize the animal movement. ||United Kingdom\n|-\n|1964||Largely due to the outcry following Animal Machines, British Parliament forms the Brambell Committee to investigate animal welfare. The Committee concludes that animals should be afforded the Five Freedoms, which consist of the animal's freedom to \"have sufficient freedom of movement to be able without difficulty to turn around, groom itself, get up, lie down, [and] stretch its limbs.\" ||United Kingdom\n|-\n|1969||The Council of Europe adopts the Convention on Animals in Transport. ||\n|-\n|1970||Animal rights activist Richard Ryder coins the term \"speciesism\" to describe the devaluing of nonhuman animals on the basis of species alone. ||England\n|-\n|1972||Germany passes its Animal Protection Act. ||Germany\n|-\n|1974||Ronnie Lee and Cliff Goodman of the Band of Mercy, a militant group founded by former members of the Hunt Saboteurs Association, are jailed for firebombing a British animal research center. ||England\n|-\n|1974||The Council of Europe passes a directive requiring that animals be rendered unconscious before slaughter. ||\n|-\n|1975||Spain's first animal welfare organization, the Association for the Defense of Animal Rights, is founded. ||Spain\n|-\n|1976||The European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes, which mandates that animals be kept in conditions meeting their \"physiological and ethological needs\", is passed. ||\n|-\n|1976||Released from prison, Ronnie Lee founds the Animal Liberation Front, which soon spreads to the US and Europe. ||England\n|-\n|1976||France passes animal welfare law which recognizes that (domestic) animals are sentient beings, and requires that alternatives to animal experimentation be used where possible. ||France\n|-\n|1977||The Dutch Experiments on Animals Act is passed. ||\n|-\n|1977||The Lega Antivivisezione Italiana (Italian Antivivisection League) – \"arguably the most successful animal rights group in Italy\" – is founded. ||Italy\n|-\n|1978||The Swiss Animal Welfare Act is passed. ||Switzerland\n|-\n|1979||The first European Conference on Farm Animal Welfare is held. ||Netherlands\n|-\n|1986||The Council of Europe issues the European Directive Regarding the Protection of Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. ||\n|-\n|1988||The Swedish Animal Welfare Act is passed. ||Sweden\n|-\n|1992||Switzerland becomes the first country to include protections for animals in its constitution. ||Switzerland\n|-\n|1997||The EU's Protocol on Animal Protection is annexed to the treaty establishing the European Community.
