The winner receives a cash prize of $20,000. This is the biggest prize available specifically to a dancer in Australia.\nNominees are selected by The Australian Ballet and previous award winners. A judging panel composed of representatives from The Australian Ballet, Telstra and the media selects the winner based on \"the artistic quality of their work, the strength of a written submission, their personal development, and future potential.\"\nHistory of the awards\nThe awards are announced in early December, usually in the Joan Sutherland Theatre, Sydney Opera House (venue for Sydney seasons by The Australian Ballet).\nIn 2019, the awards were announced on the Sydney opening night of Peter Wright's The Nutcracker on 30 November 2019.\nThe 2018 awards were announced on the opening night of Alexei Ratmansky's Cinderella on 30 November 2018.\nIn 2017, as the Joan Sutherland Theatre was unavailable, the company's Sydney November–December season took place at the Capitol Theatre.
