Operating primarily out of Southern California, it serves as an attempted governing body for the wasteland, including some portions of Oregon and Nevada, along with further colonization efforts in Arizona and the Baja California area of Mexico.\nThe NCR first made a minor appearance in Fallout (1997) in one of the ending slides, and then reappeared in Fallout 2 (1998) as an advanced nation expanding into Northern California, eighty years later. It served as a key element to the plot of Fallout: New Vegas (2010) and further appeared in the 2024 Fallout TV series.\nStructure\nThe New California Republic is a republic; it has a professional military and system of elected government, collects taxes from trade routes, and has laws prohibiting gambling and prostitution. The faction's primary goal is to reestablish a formal governing body for the wasteland. A democracy, one of the major policies of the NCR is upholding the rights of posthuman beings such as ghouls.\nAppearances\nThe New California Republic was first mentioned in an ending to the original Fallout. With the Khan raider tribe wiped out and the Master's army destroyed by the Vault Dweller, Tandi and Aradesh of Shady Sands use the breathing room to establish trade with other towns and eventually form the New California Republic in 2189. The NCR then appeared as a major faction in Fallout 2. Lead by President Tandi, the NCR has become a powerful force in Southern California, allied with the Brotherhood of Steel, and is expanding into the lawless Northern California wastes in 2241, eighty years after the events of Fallout. Seeking to annex the technologically advanced Vault City and the rich gold mining town of Redding, the NCR strikes a deal with the Bishop crime family of New Reno to bully Vault City into joining the NCR by covertly stealing technology and sending mercenaries to attack Vault City, with the goal being to force Vault City into desperation and accept NCR governance. Redding is lusted after by the NCR, Vault City, and New Reno for its gold mining, all the while engulfed in a cold war between the various resident mining companies and local medic Doc Johnson, who each want to choose which faction Redding will join, with Marge LeBarge of Kokoweef Mine voting to join the NCR. Elsewhere, the New California Rangers, an unofficial branch of the NCR with limited government support, is on a crusade to destroy slavery in Northern California, particularly opposed to the Slaver's Guild. The Chosen One, the main protagonist and grandchild of the Vault Dweller, can either aid the NCR's expansion northward or hamper it, fighting the NCR's enemies in the region or destabilizing the NCR's efforts. Though the player can achieve multiple different endings, the NCR canonically annexes the vast majority of Northern California, and the New California Rangers reorganize into the New California Republic Rangers, an elite branch of the army. As the xenophobic and genocidal Enclave collapses in the region after being crippled by the Chosen One, the NCR attacks and overruns its mainland base at Camp Navarro in 2246, working together with the Brotherhood of Steel to destroy survivors of the attack. Its most prominent appearance was in Fallout: New Vegas, where the NCR featured as a major element to the game's plot. The faction engages in war against its former ally the Brotherhood of Steel, and actively fights against Caesar's Legion for control over the Hoover Dam, which the NCR uses to provide themselves and civilians with power and water. The NCR also fights over post-war Las Vegas and the Mojave Desert region. Additionally, the cover art for the game depicts an NCR Ranger. The NCR is additionally referenced in Fallout 4.\nIn the 2024 television adaptation Fallout, the character Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury) is depicted as an NCR leader seeking cold fusion in order to power the surrounding area. By 2296, the NCR's influence in the Los Angeles area has been crippled following the capital of Shady Sands being completely destroyed by a nuclear bomb dropped by Vault-Tec Corporation employee and Vault 33 Overseer Hank MacLean (Kyle MacLachlan) and the Brotherhood of Steel attacking the scattered and disorganized remnants of the local NCR forces. During the beginning of the show, Moldaver leads a raid upon Vault 33 and kidnaps MacLean, prompting his daughter, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), to leave the vault to search for him.\nPromotion and merchandise\nOn June 17, 2021, Bethesda released limited-edition, wearable NCR Desert Ranger helmets. The helmets, listed with a limited quantity of 500, were sold out right after they had been put up for sale.\nBethesda released flags based on major factions in the Fallout series, including the New California Republic's two-headed bear flag.\nReception\nKristine Steimer of IGN Gaming Network labelled the NCR as \"bloated and ineffective at protecting its people\" during her review of Fallout: New Vegas, while Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer granted that the NCR had brought \"semblance of order\" to the Wasteland. In 2017, a man cosplaying as a New California Republic veteran ranger in Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada, was arrested after members of the public mistook him for an individual carrying a bomb. Following the release of the 2024 television adaptation, the New California Republic's lore came into question by Fallout fans who discovered apparent contradictions between the timeline of events surrounding the show's sixth episode and events from Fallout: New Vegas.\nWith the destruction of NCR's base of operations in Shady Sands in the television series, Fallout fans questioned the faction's future. In an interview with IGN, Bethesda executive producer Todd Howard  responded by teasingly remarking, \"I don't think you've heard the last of the New California Republic.\" Howard additionally noted that the NCR after all had operations beyond California, implying that the destruction of Shady Sands will not be the end for the republic.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_California_Republic New California Republic] at Nukapedia, the Fallout Fandom wiki\n* [https://fallout.wiki/wiki/New_California_Republic New California Republic] at the independent Fallout wiki"
