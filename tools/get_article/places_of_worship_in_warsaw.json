It includes Catholic, Uniate, Protestant and Orthodox churches, as well as synagogues and shrines of other denominations. Note that the list includes also places of worship that were destroyed some time in the past and are currently non-existent. Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city. According to a census of 1901, out of 711,988 inhabitants there were 56.2% Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants. Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. After the war the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number of them were rebuilt.\nThe cathedrals and other main places of worship are bolded, non-existent churches are listed in italics''.\nChristian\nCatholic\n* St. Alexander's Church on Plac Trzech Krzyży\n* All Saints Church\n* St. Ann's Church at Krakowskie Przedmieście, serving the academic community\n* St. Anne's Church in Wilanów\n* Church of St. Anthony of Padua in Czerniaków\n* Church of St. Anthony of Padua in downtown Warsaw\n* St. Augustine's Church\n* Capuchins Church at Miodowa Street\n* Carmelite Church\n* St. Casimir's Church\n* St. Catherine's Church\n* Field Cathedral of the Polish Army\n* '''St. Florian's Cathedral''' in the eastern borough of Praga\n* St. Francis' Church\n* Church of the Holiest Saviour at the square of the same name\n* Holy Cross Church on Krakowskie Przedmieście\n* Church of the Holy Spirit\n* '''St. John's Cathedral'''\n* Church of John of God\n* St. Martin's Church\n* National Temple of Divine Providence (under construction)\n* Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n* Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n* Visitationist Church and  convent\nOrthodox\n* Alexander Nevsky Cathedral at the Saxon Square (demolished between 1924 and 1926)\n* Chapel of the Holy Mary Mother of God at Paryska street\n* St. John Climacus's Orthodox Church at the Orthodox Cemetery in Wola\n* '''St. Mary Magdalene's Cathedral' in Praga\n* Church of the Archangel Michael in Warsaw'' (demolished in 1923)\n* St. Peter and Paul's Church in Wołomin\n* St. Olga's Church (demolished before 1935)\nProtestant\n* [http://www.anglicanchurch.pl/ Anglican Church of Warsaw in Krakowskie Przedmieście]\n* Baptist Church\n* Calvinist Parochial Church\n* Evangelical Reformed Parish\n* [http://icfwarsaw.org/ International Christian Fellowship, Warsaw]\n* Lutheran Holy Trinity Church (so-called ''Zug's Church)\n* Methodist Chapel at Plac Zbawiciela\n* Pentecostal Church (Zbór Stołeczny)\n* Seventh Day Adventist Church\n* Warsaw International Church\n* [https://www.homeworship.org/ Warsaw Home Worship Group]\nEastern Catholic\n* Church of the Ascension of the Holy Mary of the Basilian monks at Miodowa street\nJewish\n* Great Synagogue'' (demolished in 1943)\n* Nożyk Family Synagogue, the only synagogue to be rebuilt after the war\n* Beit Warszawa Synagogue\n* Chabad Lubavitch Synagogue\nMuslim\n* Islamic Cultural Centre in Ochota\n* Mosque in Wilanów\nHindu\n* Hindu Bhawan Temple\n* Red Sues Temple in Sulejowek\nSee also\n* Tourist attractions in Warsaw\n* Eastern Catholic Churches\nReferences"
