The Emperor's forces won the battle.\nThe Battle of Wuchale marked a pivotal turning point in the anti-colonial struggles between Ethiopia and Italy at the end of the 19th century. The roots of the conflict trace back to the Treaty of Wuchale, signed in 1889 between Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia and Italy. A significant discrepancy existed between the Amharic and Italian versions of the treaty: while the Amharic text stated that Ethiopia could seek Italy's assistance in foreign affairs, the Italian version asserted that Ethiopia was obligated to conduct its foreign relations through Italy, effectively making it an Italian protectorate. Interpreting the treaty according to its own version, Italy began treating Ethiopia as a protectorate. In response, Emperor Menelik II rejected this interpretation and launched a national resistance.\nThe climax of the conflict came on March 1, 1896, in a major battle widely known in Western literature as the Battle of Adwa (or Adowa). Italy had advanced from Eritrea into Ethiopian territory, launching an offensive with approximately 17,000 troops under the command of General Oreste Baratieri. However, they were met by a vastly larger and well-organized Ethiopian force of around 100,000 soldiers equipped with modern weaponry. The Ethiopians capitalized on the country’s challenging terrain, while the Italian army suffered from communication breakdowns and flawed logistical planning, leading to severe disarray. Empress Taitu played an active role in the resistance, highlighting the significant contributions of women to the war effort and the unity displayed in Ethiopia’s national defense.\nBy the end of the battle, Ethiopian forces had encircled and decisively defeated the Italian army. The Italians suffered heavy losses: approximately 7,000 soldiers were killed, around 3,000 were taken prisoner, and the remainder were forced to retreat. This resounding victory not only secured Ethiopia’s independence but also served as a powerful inspiration for other anti-colonial movements across Africa. The Battle of Adwa (or Wuchale) stands as one of the rare instances in history where a non-European nation triumphed over a colonial power, making it a landmark moment in the global resistance against imperialism.\nReferences"
