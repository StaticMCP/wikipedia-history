Although České Dráhy owns and operates multiple rolling stock capable of speeds of  since 2004, there is, as of 2023, no infrastructure capable of velocity over . The only exception is the 13.3-kilometre long track at Velim railway test circuit with a maximum allowed speed of  for tilting trains and up to  for conventional trains. Czech rolling stock manufacturer Škoda Transportation has produced high-speed rolling stock since the 1970s.\nInfrastructure\non the large Velim circuit]]\nThe basis for Czech high-speed rail was laid down in 2017 when the Government approved the High-Speed Rail Development Program. According to this program, the following routes, referred to as \"RS\", (standing for rychlá spojení, fast connections) will be developed:\n* RS1: Prague – Brno – Ostrava – (Katowice)\n* RS2: Brno – Břeclav – (Vienna / Bratislava)\n* RS3: Prague – Plzeň – (Nuremberg / Munich)\n* RS4: Prague – Ústí nad Labem – (Dresden)\n*RS5: Prague – Hradec Králové – (Wrocław)\nThe development will include the construction of new lines as well as upgrade existing lines to . New high-speed routes will consist of the following shorter sections:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!label\n!section\n!route\n!length\n!maximum speed\n!service\n!start of construction\n!expected completion\n|-\n|VRT-01\n|VRT Polabí\n|RS1, RS5\n|29 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2027\n|2032\n|-\n|VRT-02\n|VRT Střední Čechy\n|RS1\n|70 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2028\n|2032\n|-\n|\n|VRT Vysočina II. fáze\n|RS1\n|79 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2029\n|2034\n|-\n|VRT-04\n|VRT Vysočina I. fáze\n|RS1\n|33 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2028\n|2032\n|-\n|\n|VRT Haná\n|RS1\n|N/A\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|after 2040\n|after 2045\n|-\n|VRT-05\n|VRT Jižní Morava\n|RS2\n|34 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2027\n|2030\n|-\n|VRT-06\n|VRT Moravská brána I\n|RS1\n|20 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2027\n|2030\n|-\n|VRT-07\n|VRT Moravská brána II\n|RS1\n|45 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2026\n|2032\n|-\n|VRT-08\n|VRT Podřipsko\n|RS4\n|58 km\n|320 km/h\n|passengers\n|2027\n|2030\n|-\n|\n|VRT Středohorský tunel\n|RS4\n|21.5&nbsp;km\n|250 km/h\n|passengers, freight\n|2038\n|2045\n|-\n|VRT-09\n|VRT Krušnohorský tunel\n|RS4\n|23 km\n|200 km/h\n|passengers, freight\n|2028\n|2038\n|-\n|\n|VRT Poohří\n|RS4\n|65 km\n|250 km/h\n|passengers, freight\n|after 2030\n|2035\n|-\n|\n|VRT Východní Čechy\n|RS5\n|60 km\n|250–320 km/h\n|passengers\n|after 2040\n|after 2040\n|-\n|\n|VRT Podkrkonoší\n|RS5\n|50–60 km\n|250–320 km/h\n|N/A\n|after 2040\n|after 2040\n|}\nPilot projects\nIn 2018 SŽDC identified following three shorter sections as pilot projects:\n* VRT Polabí (HST Polabí) – Prague – Poříčany (30 km) – part of future RS1 and RS5\n* VRT Jižní Morava (HST South Moravia) – Brno – Vranovice – part of future RS2\n* VRT Moravská brána (HST Moravian Gate) – Přerov – Ostrava – part of future RS1\nTrain stations planning\nAlong the high-speed route RS1 (Prague-Brno-Ostrava), several new train stations are planned. Just south to the D11 motorway in the town of Nehvizdy in the Prague-East District, the new Prague East Terminal (Terminál Praha východ) is being planned. This station will be a transport hub as a part of the RS1 and RS5 (Prague-Liberec/Hradec Králové) routes and will mainly serve residents of the northeastern part of the Central Bohemian Region. Along RS1, the high-speed line will be connected via a branch line to the train station of Světlá nad Sázavou, which will be reconstructed.\nClose to highway exit 112 on the D1 motorway in the Jihlava District, a new Jihlava train station (terminál Jihlava VRT) is planned as part of RS1. This station will also be connected to the regional railway between Jihlava and Havlíčkův Brod and serve as a transport hub for the Vysočina Region. Another new station to the west of Velká Bíteš is planned on a branch line from the RS1 towards the regional railway between Havlíčkův Brod and Brno.\nIn the south of Brno, the new train station Brno-Vídeňská is planned to serve the region around Brno and to prevent unnecessary traffic to Brno main railway station in the city centre.\nOne new train station is planned along the high-speed route RS4 (Prague – Ústí nad Labem). This new train station (Terminál Roudnice nad Labem VRT) will be constructed to the west of Roudnice nad Labem and will serve as a transfer hub in the Litoměřice District.\nSŽ is also considering upgrading of some ETCS-equipped  tracks to  and also upgrading some current  projects to . In 2020 SŽ called for bids to upgrade ongoing  Soběslav – Doubí project and  Sudoměřice – Votice project to , both projects are on Prague – České Budějovice route.\nRolling stock operated in the Czech Republic\ntrainset in Brno]]\nSince 2004 České dráhy have been operating seven ČD Class 680 sets. These Pendolino-based trains are capable of operating at  and were intended for operation on the Berlin – Prague – Vienna route. While testing from Břeclav to Brno on 18 November 2004, the ČD Class 680 reached a speed of  and created a new Czech railway speed record. In reality ČD Class 680 were never operated in Germany and appeared only in Austria and Slovakia; since 2012 they have only operated on domestic routes and in Slovakia.\nFrom 2010 České dráhy are receiving delivery of 20 new ČD Class 380 locomotives capable of a speed of , they operate also tens of passenger cars capable of that speed (classes 10–91, 21–91, 72–91 and 88–91). In 2013 České dráhy also ordered 7 Railjet trains capable of a speed of .\nRolling stock manufactured in the Czech Republic\nlocomotive on the Velim circuit]]\nIn 1974 and 1979 Škoda produced 12 Škoda 66Е locomotives capable of a speed of  for the Soviet Union. These were designated as Chs200 (ЧС200) and were used mainly on the Nevsky Express train on the Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway. The locomotives were refurbished in the 1990s and during testing in 2007 one locomotive reached a speed of .\nSince 2008 Škoda has been producing Skoda 109E locomotives capable of a speed over . The ČD Class 380 batch is certified for , however the Slovak ZSSK Class 381 batch only for a speed of .\nFuture rolling stock\nČeské dráhy aimed to make their fleet ready for speeds over 200 km/h by issuing a tender of procuring new rolling stock. In 2021 the consortium of Siemens Mobility and Škoda Transportation has won the tender for 20 Viaggio Comfort non-traction units with eight passenger cars and a passenger control car, enabling push-pull operation. With designed operating speed of , the delivery is expected to start from 2024 to 2026 and the order is valued at around half a billion EUR.\nThe cars will be approved for operation in the Czech Republic and neighbouring European countries such as Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. The non-traction units will be used with Siemens Vectron MS locomotives ordered separately in 2022, with deliveries starting in 2025 and an initial amount of 50 locomotives with designated speed of .\nFurther reading\n* [https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/tema/vysokorychlostni-trat-5466 Collection] of information about so called VRT maintained by Czech Television from 2021\n* Direct [https://www.vrtaci.cz/docs/SZ%20-%20(VRT%20+%20RSx)/vrt/co-je-vrt/vrt-v-cr.html link] to web about High–Speed Lines Construction maintained by Správa železnic (Rail Systems,  owner and provider of Czech national and regional railway infrastructure)\nReferences"
