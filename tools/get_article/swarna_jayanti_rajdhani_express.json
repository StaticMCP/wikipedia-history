The train was one of the Rajdhani Express trains to be introduced in the 20th century, making its inaugural run on 1 January 1998 after the erstwhile metre-gauge lines between Ahmedabad and Delhi through Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana were converted to broad gauge. Since it was introduced in the 50th year of India's independence, it was named 'Swarna Jayanti' (golden jubilee) Rajdhani Express.\nSchedule\nAs of 21 March 2023, the Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani Express runs daily using the Jaipur–Ahmedabad line on Ahmedabad–Delhi main line.  12957 departs SBIB at 19:10 and arrives at NDLS at 07:30 the next day. 12958 departs NDLS at 19:55 and arrives at SBIB at 08:05 the next day, averaging approximately 77&nbsp;km/h on both runs. In this sector, it is the fastest train between Ahmedabad and New Delhi. During its journey, the train passes through the Indian states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi. The entire train route is electrified and only the section between Jagudan and Palanpur Junction is on double line as of February 2025.\nRoute and halts\n• Sabarmati Junction\n• Mahesana Junction\n• Palanpur Junction\n• Abu road\n• Falna\n• Ajmer Junction\n• Jaipur Junction\n• Gurgaon\n• Delhi Cantonment\n• New Delhi\nTime table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:gold;\"| Station Code\n!! style=\"background:gold;\"| Station name\n!! style=\"background:yellow;\"| Arrival\n!! style=\"background:red;\"| Departure\n|-\n| SBIB || Sabarmati Junction || --- || 18:45\n|-\n| MSH || Mahesana Junction || 19:36 || 19:38\n|-\n| PNU || Palanpur Junction || 20:40 || 20:42\n|-\n| ABR || Abu Road || 21:20 || 21:25\n|-\n| FA || Falna || 22:34 || 22:36\n|-\n| AII || Ajmer Junction || 01:00 || 01:05\n|-\n| JP || Jaipur Junction || 02:45 || 02:55\n|-\n| GGN || Gurgaon || 06:24 || 06:26\n|-\n| DEC || Delhi Cantt || 06:40 || 06:42\n|-\n| NDLS || New Delhi || 07:30 || ---\n|}\nTraction\nIt is hauled by a Vadodara Loco Shed based WAP-7 electric locomotive on its entire journey.\nGallery\nFile:12958 Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani Express - AC 1st Class coach.jpg |12958 Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani Express – AC 1st Class coach\nFile:12958 Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani Express - AC 2 tier coach.jpg |12958 Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani Express – AC 2 tier coach\nFile:12958 Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani Express - Pantry Car.jpg |12958 Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani Express – Pantry car\nCoach composition\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders unsortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| Loco\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 1\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 2\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 3\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 4\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 5\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 6\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 7\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 8\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 9\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 10\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 11\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 12\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 13\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 14\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 15\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 16\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 17\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 18\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 19\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 20\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 21\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:RED;\"| 22\n|-\n|||EOG||A1|||A2||A3||A4||A5||H1||PC||BE1||B1||B2||B3||B4||B5||B6||B7||B8||B9||B10||B11||B12||EOG\n|}\nOther details\nThe train's rake is split into three classes of travel, AC 1st class (code: H/1A), AC 2 Tier (code: A/2A) and AC 3 Tier (code:B/3A).
