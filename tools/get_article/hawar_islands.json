The archipelago is situated off the west coast of Qatar in the Gulf of Bahrain of the Persian Gulf.\nDescription\nThe islands used to be one of the settlements of the Bahraini branch of the Dawasir who settled there in the early 19th century. The islands were first surveyed in 1820, when they were called the Warden's Islands, and two villages were recorded. They are now uninhabited, other than a police garrison and a hotel on the main island; access to all but Hawar island itself is severely restricted. Local fishermen are allowed to fish in adjacent waters and there is some recreational fishing and tourism on and around the islands. Fresh water has always been scarce; historically it was obtained by surface collection and even today, with the desalination plant, additional supplies have to be brought in.\nGeography\nDespite their proximity to Qatar (they are only about  from the Qatari mainland whilst being about  from the main islands of Bahrain), most of the islands belong to Bahrain, having been a part of a dispute between Bahrain and Qatar which was resolved in 2001. The islands were formerly coincident with the district or Minṭaqat Juzur Ḥawār (مِنْطَقَة جُزُر حَوَار) and are now administered as part of the Southern Governorate of Bahrain. The land area of the islands is approximately .\nAlthough there are 36 islands in the group, many of the smaller islands are little more than sand or shingle accumulations on areas of exposed bedrock molded by the ongoing processes of sedimentation and accretion. The World Heritage Site application named 8 major islands, which conforms to the description of the islands when first surveyed as consisting of 8 or 9 islands. It has often been described as an archipelago of 16 islands. Janan Island, to the south of Hawar island, is not legally considered to be a part of the group and is owned by Qatar.\nFlora and fauna\nThere are small herds of Arabian oryx and sand gazelle on Hawar island, and the seas around support sea turtles and a large population of dugongs.\nThe islands are home to many bird species. The archipelago has been designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of western reef egrets, Socotra cormorants (with some 200,000–300,000 adults recorded in 1992, making it the largest known breeding concentration in the world), Saunders's and white-cheeked terns, and sooty falcons. Other breeding birds include Caspian and bridled terns, and ospreys. Wintering birds include great crested grebes and greater flamingos.\nConservation\nThe islands were listed as a Ramsar site in 1997. In 2002, the Bahraini government applied to have the islands recognised as a World Heritage Site due to their unique environment and habitat for endangered species; the application was ultimately unsuccessful.\nAdministration\nThe islands were formerly coincident with the region or Minṭaqat of Juzur Ḥawār (مِنْطَقَة جُزُر حَوَار) and are now administered as part of the Southern Governorate of Bahrain.\nJinan Island is administered as part of Al-Shahaniya Municipality of Qatar.\nAccess\nThe islands are connected through a  ferry ride from Manama and are reported to have a potential to be developed as a beach tourism destination.\nList of islands\nHawar archipelago\nBy far the largest island is Hawar, which accounts for more than  of the  land area. Following in size are Suwād al Janūbīyah, Suwād ash Shamālīyah, Rubud Al Sharqiyah, Rubud Al Gharbiyah, and Muhazwarah (Umm Hazwarah).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"200px\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"70px\" | Arabic\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" | Coordinates\n! align=center scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" | Max height\n!

Based on a previous agreement when both Qatar and Bahrain were under British occupation, it was judged to be separate from the Hawar islands and so considered by the court separately. It was awarded to Qatar.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"200px\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"70px\" | Arabic\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" | Coordinates\n! align=center scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" | Max height (meters)\n!
