The Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 and certain steps taken thereafter saw the addition of peripheral areas in the eastern and southern parts of the  city to the corporation area. In 1888, there were 75 commissioners, 50 of whom were elected, 15 appointed by the government and 10 nominated from bodies like Chambers of Commerce, Trades Associations and the Port Commissioners.  The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. The adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpore, Manicktola and Garden Reach, as well as the New Dock Extension area, were amalgamated with Kolkata. Garden Reach was later taken out.\nPost-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata. With the addition of Joka to Kolkata, the number of wards rose to 144.\nGeography\nWard No. 100 is bordered on the north by Raipur Mondal Para Road; on the east by Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick Road; on the south by Tolly's Nullah; and on the west by Naktala Road and Khanpur Road.\nThe ward is served by Netaji Nagar police station of Kolkata Police.\nPatuli Women police station has jurisdiction over all police districts under the jurisdiction of South Suburban Division, i.e. Netaji Nagar, Jadavpur, Kasba, Regent Park, Bansdroni, Garfa and Patuli.\nDemographics\nAs per the 2011 Census of India, Ward No. 100, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, had a total population of 25,507, of which 12,386 (49%) were males and 13,121 (51%) were females.
