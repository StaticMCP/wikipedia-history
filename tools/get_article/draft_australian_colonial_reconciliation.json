These diverse, and semi-nomadic societies maintained complex cultural traditions, histories, and languages across the continent. The indigenous Australians, also known as the Aboriginals or the First Nation Peoples, lived in small family groups in defined territories, and would move systematically across defined areas depending on seasons. Family groups often came together for trade, social, and ceremonial purposes.\nThe first recorded European contact with the continent occurred in 1606, when Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon and his crew aboard a ship called the Duyfken, landed on the Australian coast. However, it was not until 1788 that British colonisation began, with the arrival of the First Fleet led by Governor Arthur Phillip at Port Jackson (now known as Sydney). The First Fleet consisted of 11 ships, carrying British convicts, marines, and colonial officials. The original location of the Fleet landing was in Botany Bay, however Arthur Philip Rejected Botany Bay as a base and instead chose Port Jackson, located in the northern part of the continent as a base site for the new colony of the British, thus marking the continent of Australia as a new British penal colony.\nPrior to British settlement, Australia was home to an estimated 1.5 million Indigenous people, yet the British claimed sovereignty under the principle of terra nullius, which is the notion that the land inherently belonged to no one. This term disregarded Indigenous land ownership and led to widespread displacement, marginalization, and conflict with the First Nation Peoples. Despite Captain James Cook charting the east coast in 1770 and witnessing its inhabitants, early British explorers made little effort to engage with Indigenous Australians in a cohesive manner.The colonisation by the British introduced profound social, political, and cultural upheaval, with long-term consequences that shaped the nation's history.\nThe British colonists experienced active resistance from the Aboriginals from very early on in their colonisation. The Frontier Wars were referred to as violent conflicts between the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, against the British settlers, and resulted in massacres and widespread death for the indigenous Australians. These Frontier Wars were recorded to have started from the beginning of the colonial period in Australia (1788) up until 1930. The death toll of the British colonisers is estimated to be about 2000-5000 people, however, the death toll for the aboriginal population is estimated to be around 60,000 in the region of Queensland alone. The number of deaths of the Aboriginal population across the continent is unknown due to deaths being covered up or simply not reported. It is estimated that about 90% percent of the aboriginal population during the colonial period was wiped out, due to a combination of colonial violence during the Frontier Wars, but also due to diseases such as smallpox and the flu that the colonisers had brought with them during the invasion.\nReconciliation Efforts\nSince the First Fleet's arrival at Botany Bay in 1788, Australia was seen as an extension of the British Empire, not an independent entity, and its (settler) history was only a part of larger British and European histories. However, the Great Depression and the Second World War deteriorated Australian relationship with the United Kingdom, created a stronger sense of the Australian national identity, seen as \"a protest against oppression and exploitation, a struggle to realise popular aspirations and progress towards a free, democratic, and independent nation-state.\" This, in turn, produced a strong national historiography known as the 'Three Cheers' which was eventually met with a more critical perspective on Australian history, pejoratively nicknamed the 'Black Armband' view. These critical historians made way for first forms of colonial reconciliation by basing Indigenous research in humanities, not zoology, and by raising the Indigenous to the subject of research, and not only the object.\nOutside academia, there was also a rise in Aboriginal rights movements across Australia during the 1970s and 1980s when Aboriginal land councils, Indigenous media, and other institutions were founded.\nIn 1991, Reconciliation Australia, a non-profit NGO, was formed to \"inspire and enable all Australians to contribute to [national] reconciliation.\" Its three program areas act within businesses, community groups, educational, and governmental institutions, and are based on five interrelated dimensions: race relations, equality and equity, institutional integrity, unity and historical acceptance.\nThe government has also tried to come to term with its past by erecting monuments and memorials for countless Aboriginals killed by the settlers, like the Coniston massacre monument, however they tend to present a European form of memorialisation, marked by Western-style monuments and by not directly addressing those killed and those who killed, unlike memorials mainly built by Indigenous volunteer organisations and the locals themselves.\nMoreover, schools also became a contested place of reconciliation. In 1982, Aboriginal perspectives in education became mandatory in New South Wales as teachers and creators of curricula began accentuating the experiences of those who resisted power instead of those who held it. On the other side, however, critics were apt to react to these changes, labelling them as 'neo-Marxist versions of social justice' endangering children, and therefore, endangering our future. The heated debate reached its peak during the Bicentenary in 1988 with some teacher unions refusing to participate in the bicentennial 'Celebration of a Nation' if it were to exclude Aboriginal perspectives, with others claiming that present-day white Australians weren't responsible for historical wrong-doings and accusing the government of dismissing the importance of the anniversary.\nReactionary Movements\nAnti-reconciliation movements have also come in other forms and from actors across the political spectrum. The 2016 State of Reconciliation in Australia report highlights that Australians hold widely differing views on forgiveness and addressing historical injustices.\nIn particular, there has been a strong settler backlash against Indigenous demands for sovereignty and self-determination. This opposition was evident in the decisive ‘No’ vote in the 2023 referendum on incorporating an Indigenous Voice to Parliament into the Constitution. The rejection was accompanied by anti-Indigenous racism, a denial of Indigenous sovereignty, and assertions of settler control over the nation-state. Conservative nationalists framed the indigenous demand for sovereignty, self-determination and rights to land as a threat to national unity, as exemplified by the campaign´ slogan \"Vote No to Division\". Figures like Gary Johns further fueled these sentiments with openly racist ideas, such as defending the forced removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, demanding blood tests from Aboriginal people in order to receive social welfare and inflating statistics on Indigenous incarceration rates.\nLiberal perspectives on reconciliation have been characterized by what scholars term ‘indigenising settler nationalism’. This approach embraces Indigenous culture as part of the Australian identity but does not acknowledge Indigenous sovereignty. Instead, it seeks to incorporate Indigenous peoples into the settler state while maintaining a “colonial ceiling” on their demands. By framing Indigenous heritage as a “gift” to the nation, progressive settler nationalists expand national identity without fundamentally shifting power structures.\nThere has also been strong Indigenous critique of reconciliation, highlighting its limits as a mode of postcolonial justice. While the general population largely supports forgiveness and moving on, Indigenous perspectives are more divided. Many view reconciliation as an assimilationist agenda, granting Indigenous people the right to be incorporated into the nation and to engage in settler reconciliation programs but not the right to refuse. Another point of critique is that reconciliation has largely been conducted on white terms. This was evident in John Howard’s 1999 Motion of Reconciliation, which expressed “regret” rather than an apology. The language of “mistreatment” significantly understated the violence inflicted on Indigenous peoples, failing to acknowledge genocide. While Howard consulted with the only Indigenous parliamentarian at the time, many Indigenous voices found the motion insufficient. More broadly, reconciliation has been used as a nation-building exercise, further denying indigenous sovereignty. The 2023 referendum further exposed these tensions, with Indigenous critics arguing that the vote was essentially about their \"right to exist on their own land\".\nUltimately, reconciliation in Australia has often been more performative than substantive. Critics argue that it has been used by proxy to reinforce the legitimacy of the Australian settler state while not truly acknowledging past and present injustices. Symbolic recognition of Indigenous culture has not translated into meaningful policy or structural change, failing to address the deep-seated oppression, racism, and socio-economic disadvantage Indigenous communities continue to face.\nIn the words of Irene Watson: “What does reconciliation really mean? Will it provide homes for the homeless, food for the hungry, land for the dispossessed, language and culture for those hungry to revive from stolen and dispossessed spaces? How can you become reconciled with a state and its citizens who have not yet acknowledged your humanity, let alone your status as the first peoples of this conquered land?”.\nOngoing Discourse\nLooking at the current debate around the welfare of Indigenous peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the programs supporting their lands shows a prime example of their welfare as a whole. Australian government launched the [https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/land/indigenous-protected-areas#toc_1 Indigenous Protected Areas (IPA) program] supporting First Nations peoples to care for their country in 1997. Indigenous Protected Areas are areas of land and sea that traditional owners – referring to aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples – have agreed to manage for biodiversity conservation. It represents about 50% of Australia’s National Reserve System (NRS). The IPA is a voluntary agreement with the government and includes 89 IPAs managed by First Nations people which is 90 million hectares of land and 6 million hectares of sea.\nThough the Australian government advertises its program to be ensuring environmental, cultural, social and economic benefits through management such as cultural side management; biodiversity surveys; habitat restoration; education and so forth, federal funding only offers indigenous rangers 6% of the national conservation estate budget. The Australian government is providing A$231.5 million over 5 years from 2023 on to protect Indigenous Protected Areas (IPA).\nWhen it comes to the welfare of the indigenous peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples statistical examination of their condition reveals a great difference regarding their welfare before white settlement and after. Centuries of oppression has left many aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples second-class citizens in Australia. The social, economic, educational and health conditions of these indigenous minorities are poor and there is little hope of breaking free of this status. Research shows that suicides and violent deaths occur far more frequently; infant mortality rates are higher; life spans are lower; available housing is inadequate to meet real needs; unemployment is fantastically high; school completion rates are very low; indigenous people are overrepresented in custody and the litany of tragic indices goes on and on.\nReferences"
