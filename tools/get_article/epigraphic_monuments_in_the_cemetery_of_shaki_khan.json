Currently, there are only 10 inscribed headstones and one inscribed tombstone.\nMashadikhanim Nemat reported about the inscriptions of 9 headstones in the cemetery in his article published in a scientific publication in 1961, and about several headstones in his books published in 1984 and 2001. In 2009, Aydın Mammadov read the inscription on a part of a headstone and determined for the first time that the headstone belonged to Ismail Khan's daughter Saadat Bey. At the end of 2018, ANAS Sheki Regional Scientific Center started a complex study of epigraphic monuments in the cemetery.\nThere is a headstone on the grave of only one of the Shaki Khans, Fatali Khan, in the cemetery. Although it is known that his brother Muhammadhasan Khan, who died in Astrakhan in 1831, was buried in this cemetery, and his father Muhammadhusein Khan was buried in the mihrab of the Khan Mosque, his headstones have not been discovered.\nThere is no doubt that the grave of the young Javad Khan's wife is also here; the source shows that after Javad Khan was killed in a battle with the Russians, his wife returned to Nukha (she was the sister of Mohammadhasan Khan) and died there in 1830.\nAs a result of the scientific research conducted by the \"Yukhari Bash\" National Historical-Architecture Reserve conducted in 2022, it was found that some of the decorative-applied art examples of headstones collected by the Sheki Museum of History and Local History and kept in its fund and taken under state protection were found in the Sheki Khan cemetery over time. are existing grave monuments. As a result of the scientific research carried out by the reserve, it was found that one of these headstones belonged to the son of Muhammad Huseyn Khan, who died at a young age, named Khanlar. This fact is unknown to the experts of the previous period who studied the cemetery of Shaki Khan.\nAccording to some authors, at the beginning of 2010, one intact headstone and several headstone parts were taken from the cemetery and taken to the museum. The whole headstone taken from the Khan's cemetery belonged to Seltanat Beym, the half-sister of Fatali Khan Khoyski, the prominent statesman of Azerbaijan, and one of the headstone fragments belonged to Saadat Beym, the mother of Seltanet Beym (daughter of Ismail Khan Khoyski).\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 750px\"\n|- style=\"background:#808000\"\n| colspan=\"5\" class=\"imageMapHighlighter\" |\nFile:Sheki_khan_gebiristanligi,_umumi.jpg|750px|Şəki Xan qəbiristanlığının ümumi görünüşü\npoly 667 498 895 498 916 899 667 899 Telli bəyimin başdaşı\npoly 928 603 1114 595 1114 823 928 827 Əbdülhəmid ağanın başdaşı\npoly 1131 553 1131 743 1266 747 1262 561 Tutu ağanın başdaşı\npoly 1507 650 1583 641 1587 717 1511 717 Hacı Ağa Nigarın/Zeynəbin başdaşı\npoly 1583 646 1587 713 1642 709 1642 646 Bulaq kitabəsi\npoly 2165 464 2156 722 2355 722 2351 464 Cəmilə xanımın başdaşı\npoly 2355 456 2359 717 2490 705 2486 460 Kərim ağa Şəkixanovun başdaşı\npoly 2490 435 2616 426 2625 671 2490 692 Fətəli xanın başdaşı\npoly 2625 422 2621 692 2806 679 2802 392 Güllü xanımın başdaşı\npoly 2882 418 2886 650 3051 641 3055 409 Göyçək xanımın başdaşı\npoly 3152 367 3140 684 3330 679 3330 350 Mustafa ağanın başdaşı\npoly 3152 367 3140 684 3330 679 3330 350 Bulaq kitabəsi\ndesc bottom-left\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background: #808000; color:white\" |Image\n! style=\"background: #808000; color:white\" |Name, father's name and surname\n! style=\"background: #808000; color:white\" |Date of birth\n! style=\"background: #808000; color:white\" |Date of\ndeath\n! style=\"background: #808000; color:white\" |Note\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#A1C54B\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#CFFF9F\"\n|200px\n|Mustafa Agha\nKarim Agha Oghlu Shakikhanov\n|≈1831\n|November 5, 1895\n(1313, 17th of Jamadiyal-Awwal month)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#98CF99\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"\n|200px\n|Goycek Khanum\nDaughter of Mahammadhuseyn Khan\n|\n|June-May, 1849\n(Rajab month of 1265)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#A1C54B\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#CFFF9F\"\n|200px\n|Gullu khanim\nDaughter of Karim Agha\nShakikhanova\n|\n|19.11.1858\n(12.04.1275 Hijri)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#98CF99\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"\n|200px\n|Fatali Khan\nSon of Mahammadhuseyn Khan\n|\n|11.05.1815\n(02.05.1230 Hijri)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#A1C54B\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#CFFF9F\"\n|200px\n|Karim Agha\nSon of Fatali Khan Shakikhanov\n|≈1788\n|10.12.1858\n(14.05.1275 Hijri)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#98CF99\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"\n|200px\n|Jamila Khanum\nDaughter of Mahammadhuseyn Khan\n|\n|26.07.1835\n(02.01.1251 Hijri)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#A1C54B\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#CFFF9F\"\n|200px\n|Telli Bayim\nDaughter of Abdulhamid Agha\n|\n|1899/1900\n(1317 Hijri)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#98CF99\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"\n|200px\n|Abdulhamid Agha\nSon of Abdulhashim Agha\n|\n|1854/55\n(1271 Hijri)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#A1C54B\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#CFFF9F\"\n|200px\n|Tuti Agha\nDaughter of Mahammadhasan Khan\n|\n|23.11.1859\n(23.04. 1276 Hijri)\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#98CF99\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"\n|200px\n|Haji Aga Nigar's/Zeynab's headstone\n|\n|1817/1818\n(Hijri 1233)\n|Although Meshadikhanim Neymat in her book published in 2001 shows the name on the headstone as \"Zeynab, the daughter of Haji Agha Bey\" In her book, he presented this name as \"Haji Aga Nigar Haji gizi\".\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#A1C54B\" align=\"center\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|- style=\"background:#CFFF9F\"\n|200px\n|Saltanat Bayim\nDaughter of Iskandar Khan\n|\n|05.01.1869\n(22.09.1285 Hijri)\n|At the beginning of 2010, this intact headstone was taken from the cemetery together with several parts of it and taken to the Shaki Museum of History and Geography named after R.b.
