Held from 2002 to 2008, the show gave recognition and awards to Asian and international artists in achievement, cinema, fashion, humanitarian, and music. Just like the EMAs, most of the awards were voted by viewers from the Asian region.\nThe trophy design was a gold toblerone-like bar. The twin prism shape represents the letter M and double A, the acronyms for MTV Asia Awards.\nThe show was absent in 2007 and was discontinued after 2008.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
