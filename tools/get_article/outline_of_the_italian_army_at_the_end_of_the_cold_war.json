It is intended to convey the connections and relationships between units and formations.\nThis article is based on the 1984 publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in Rome (a think tank of the Radical Party). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link]. Specifically the Order of Battle after the 1986 reform was used, which was then corrected and expanded with the Italian Army's website information.\nGraphic of the Italian Army in 1989\nArmy General Staff\nThe Army General Staff in Rome oversaw all Italian Army units. However, in the event of war the three Corps' in Northern Italy would have come under command of NATO's Allied Land Forces Southern Europe (LANDSOUTH) Command in Verona.\n3rd Army Corps\n* 3rd Army Corps, in Milan:\n** 3rd Army Corps Command Unit, in Milan\n** Artillery Command, in Vercelli\n***  Horse Artillery Regiment, in Milan\n**** Command Battery, in Milan\n**** 1st Self-propelled Field Artillery Group \"Gioacchino Bellezza\", (M109 155&nbsp;mm self-propelled howitzers), in Milan\n**** 2nd Self-propelled Field Artillery Group \"Sergio Bresciani\", (M109 155&nbsp;mm self-propelled howitzers), in Cremona\n**** 3rd Heavy Field Artillery Group (Reserve), (M59 155/45 towed howitzers), in Cremona\n**** 3rd Battery, 30th Artillery Specialists Group \"Brianza\", in Milan\n***  131st Heavy Field Artillery Group \"Vercelli\", in Vercelli, (FH70 155&nbsp;mm towed howitzers)\n***  205th Heavy Field Artillery Group \"Lomellina\", in Vercelli, (FH70 155&nbsp;mm towed howitzers)\n*** 11th Light Anti-aircraft Artillery Group \"Falco\" (Reserve), in Vercelli\n***  12th Artillery Specialists Group \"Biella\", in Vercelli\n*** 30th Artillery Specialist Group \"Brianza\" (Reserve), in Milan\n** Engineer Command, in Novara\n***  3rd Engineer Battalion \"Lario\", in Pavia\n***  131st Engineer Battalion \"Ticino\", in Bellinzago Novarese\n** Signal Command, in Milan\n***  3rd Signal Battalion \"Spluga\", in Milan\n***  231st Signal Battalion \"Sempione\", in Novara\n** Light Aviation Command, at Bresso Air Base\n*** 23rd Recon Helicopters Squadrons Group \"Eridano\", at Bresso Air Base\n**** 423rd Recon Helicopter Squadron (AB-206)\n**** 461st Recon Helicopter Squadron (AB-206)\n**** 462nd Recon Helicopter Squadron (AB-206)\n*** 53rd Multirole Helicopters Squadrons Group \"Cassiopea\", at Bresso Air Base\n**** 531st Multirole Helicopter Squadron (AB-205)\n**** 532nd Multirole Helicopter Squadron (AB-205)\n**  33rd Maneuver Logistic Battalion \"Ambrosiano\", in Novara\nArmored Brigade \"Centauro\"\n*  31st Armored Brigade \"Centauro\", in Novara\n** Command and Signal Unit \"Centauro\", in Novara\n**  1st Tank Battalion \"M.O.
