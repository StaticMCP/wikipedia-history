They decided to purchase the machinery needed for a newly invented process to produce sugar from sugar beets. A mill was built in downtown Sugar House to house the machinery. The process was a failure and in the summer of 1855, Brigham Young ordered the mill to shut down. The old sugar mill building was then converted to a paper factory in 1860, then a bucket factory and finally a machine shop for the Utah Central Railroad until 1928. Despite the failed sugar mill, Sugar House prospered as Salt Lake's second downtown thanks to local merchants and a bustling streetcar system.\nIn the 1920s, sculptor Millard F. Malin pitched the idea of erecting a monument in honor of early manufacturing to the Sugar House Business Men's League. The league and the city of Salt Lake jointly funded the $2,000 monument sculpted by Malin and his two fellow artists; Edward Anderson and Lorenzo Young. The monument was completed and dedicated on November 11, 1934. The obelisk stands approximately 200 feet east of the original site of a Mormon Pioneer sugar mill.\nMalin describes the monument as: }}\nThe plaque reads \"May the spirit of this courageous venture continue to characterize this community\".\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Salt Lake City\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.slc.gov/district7/sugarhouse-monument/ Sugar House SLC]\n* [http://saltlakepublicart.org/art/sugarhouse-pioneer-monument-61/ Salt Lake Public Art]"
