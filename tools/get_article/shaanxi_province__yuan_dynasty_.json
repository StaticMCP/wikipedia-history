It was established in 1260. In 1294, Sichuan was split off from Shaanxi.\nYuan-era Shaanxi included the majority of present-day Shaanxi, the southwestern part of Inner Mongolia, southeastern Gansu (around Qingyuan), north-western Sichuan, and a small part of Qinghai.\nDuring the Northern Song dynasty, it was mostly part of the Yongxing Jun, capital also at Xi'an. Following the Jin-Song Wars, the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty established rule over the northern part of the area, establishing Jingzhao Fu, Qingyuan, and Xiqin.\nIn 2015, a Yuan-era tomb fresco was excavated in Luogetai village, Gao town, Hengshan district, Yulin city in Shaanxi province.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://drr.ikcest.org/map/m0578 The Historical Map of Shaanxi Province in the Yuan Dynasty]\n\n---\n\n## Shaanxi province (Yuan dynasty)\n\n#REDIRECT Shaanxi Province (Yuan dynasty)\n}}"
