Released on September 25, 2007 under Babygrande Records, the album features group members Vinnie Paz, Jus Allah, OuterSpace, Chief Kamachi, Reef the Lost Cauze, Esoteric, Celph Titled, King Syze, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Demoz, and King Magnetic. Although he was prominently featured on the group's debut album The Torture Papers, Apathy does not appear on Ritual of Battle. While still a member of the group, he explains on a MySpace blog that he was recording with Styles of Beyond in Los Angeles during the Army's album recording sessions. The rapper recorded for one song, titled \"A.O.T.P.\", produced by Snowgoons, but it was not included on the album. This song was included on the Apathy compilation ''Hell's Lost & Found: It's The Bootleg, Muthafu@kas! Volume 2''.\nThe album's first single is \"Bloody Tears\", featuring Planetary, Doap Nixon, Demoz and Vinnie Paz and based on the Castlevania tune of the same name.\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!
