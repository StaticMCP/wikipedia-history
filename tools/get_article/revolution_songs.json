The album was released on 21 March 2016, the day for Donghak Peasant Revolution by Jeon Bong-jun. The track of the album ''Revolution (아래로부터의 혁명') won the Best Rock Song at the 2017 Korean Music Awards.\nBackground\nThe album was made when Jun Bum Sun lived in the UK to attend University of Oxford, and he said he was inspired by it around the time he studied the American Revolution and the French Revolution. The album is a concept album with a revolution and love theme influenced by Jeon Bong-jun, and there is a picture of  Jun Bum Sun with a sangtu on the album cover. The album received great attention due to the 2016 South Korean political scandal and 2016–2017 South Korean protests that took place a few months later. In an interview, Jun Bum Sun said that the revolution and lyrics of his album are \"perfect coincidences.\"\nCritical reception\n}}\nKo Jongseok of Music Y described the album as a valuable work and a great prop that was prepared and completed for this very moment and armed the public with music for the next time. Na Wonyoung of Weiv said \"Their second album Revolution Songs, which is an extension of the Love Songs'', tells the unique concept of \"Joseon Rock-Kn Roll\" of a revolution from below caused by the people of the late Joseon Dynasty.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
