Hicks, who served as interpreter.\nCherokee leaders present included Bloody Fellow, Little Turkey, Taken Out of Water, Doublehead, and Tahlonteskee.\nTerms\nPreamble The treaty begins with a long preamble, stating the reasons why it was necessary to make another treaty.

The \"Kentucky road, running between the Cumberland mountain and the Cumberland river\" across a small corner of Cherokee country, \"shall be an open and free road for the use of the citizens of the United States\"; and in consideration of this grant, \"until settlements shall make such hunting improper\", the Cherokees are to be permitted \"to hunt and take game upon the lands relinquished and ceded by this treaty.\"\nArticle 8.
