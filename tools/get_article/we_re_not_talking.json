Band member James Harrison explained the single \"I hope it makes people energetic and excited to listen to, it’s a song about losing hope, stubbornness and heartache. I’m not sure if it’s our saddest song, but maybe if you lock yourself in your room for a couple of days and only listen to it you might not feel so happy\". The music video was released on 30 May 2018, and directed by Tia Wolf.\nThe music video for the opening track on the album, \"Make Time 4 Love\" was released on 17 July 2018.

Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 79 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 14 reviews.\nTim Sendra of AllMusic explained how the band spent time touring the world, whilst gaining experience to making a \"more mature second record\". He also noted: \"The songs are bright and bold, the strings swoop in occasionally to lift the songs into the skies, and there's a refreshing lightness to everything that makes the still-somewhat-difficult nature of the subject matter go down more easily. They managed to build up and expand up their sound without losing the core of what made them special.\" Clash gave the album a seven out of ten, saying \"Something that immediately grabs you about this record is the production, which easily elevates it above its more naive sounding predecessor; the sound of new label Wichita making good on their investment. Stephen Ackroyd of Dork gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, explaining: \"Sweeping and swooning with the spirit of indie past, but never descending into generic laziness, The Goon Sax are the next wonders from Down Under. Anna Alger of Exclaim! gave the album a seven out of date noted how the band have had a \"graceful ascent into adulthood\", while explaining \"It is jangly and playful, while offering sobering portraits of reflections on navigating relationships in all their complexity.\"}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Under the Radar\n| Under the Radar''s Top 100 Albums of 2018\n| }}\n|}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nBand members\n* Louis Forster – bass, guitar, vocals\n* Riley Jones – percussion, vocals\n* James Harrison – bass, vocals\nAdditional musicians\n* Biddy Connor – viola\n* Madison Foley – trumpet\n* Lizzie Welsh – violin\nProduction\n* Cameron Bird – producer\n* James Cecil – engineer, mixing, producer\n* Tex Houston – mastering\n* Connor Beazley – photography\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
