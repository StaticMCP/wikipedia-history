It takes its name from the comune of Bonnanaro in the province of Sassari where in 1889 the eponymous site was discovered.\nChronology\n, Decimoputzu]]\nThe Bonnanaro culture is divided chronologically into two main phases:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Phase\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates\n|-\n| Bonnanaro A1 Corona Moltana\n| 1800–1650 BC\n|-\n| Bonnanaro A2 ''Sant'Iroxi\n| 1650–1600 BC\n|}\nOrigin\nAccording to Giovanni Lilliu the people who produced this culture probably originated in Central Europe and the Polada culture/Rhône culture area. From a material culture point of view, the Bonnanaro culture shows influences of the preceding pan-European Bell Beaker culture, the post-Beaker (epicampaniforme) Polada culture from northern Italy, the Remedello culture, Rinaldone culture and El Argar culture.\nM.Perra (1997) theorizes a season of conflict between the Chalcolithic natives and the groups of Beaker heritage which caused a general involution, typical of this historical phase.\nDescription\nBonnanaro sites, mostly burials, are scattered throughout Sardinian territory, with a higher concentration in the mining regions of Nurra and Sulcis-Iglesiente and in the Campidano. Ceramics were smooth and linear without decorations and characterized by handles. Numbers of metal objects increased and the first swords of arsenical bronze appeared.\nOnly four settlements of this culture are known: Su Campu Lontanu Florinas, Sa Turricula  Muros, Costa Tana Bonarcado and Abiti Teti. The houses had a base of masonry while the roof was made of wood and branches.\nIt is still uncertain whether the first \"protonuraghi\" or \"pseudonuraghi\" were built at this time, or in the successive Sub-Bonnanaro culture (or Bonnanaro B) of the Middle Bronze Age (1600–1330 BC), although C14 on organic finds from the Protonuraghe Bruncu Madugui (Gesturi) suggest that it was built sometime around 1820 BC. The Proto-Nuraghi were megalithic edifices which are considered the precursors of the classic Nuraghi. They are horizontal buildings characterized by a long corridor with rooms and cells.\nThe Bonnanaro grave typologies include the domus de janas'', caves, cists and allée couvertes.\nPhysical anthropology\nAbout 200 human skeletons of the period show that the Bonnanaro population (phase A1) was composed mainly of dolicochepalic individuals (67%) with a minority of brachycephalics (33%), the latter concentrated in the north-western portion of the island. The average height was 1.62 m for men and 1.59 m for women. The Bonnanaro population suffered from osteoporosis, hyperostosis, anemia, caries and tumors. Cranial trepannation was practiced.\nA study by G. D'Amore, S. Di Marco, G. Floris, E. Pacciani, and E. Sanna from 2010, which analyzed craniofacial morphometric variations in Sardinia from the Late Neolithic to the present, found a lower morphological differentiation between the populations of the Bonnanaro culture and the contemporary samples from the Italian Peninsula compared to earlier and later Sardinian populations.\nPaleogenetics\nand necklace from Cuccuru Nuraxi, Settimo San Pietro]]\nA 2022 study by Marjusha Chintalapati et al. found evidences of moderate steppe-related ancestry (although minoritarian compared to  Western Hunter-Gatherer and Early European Farmer ancestries) in some of the Early Bronze Age Sardinians from the North-West (e.g. necropolis of Su Crucifissu Mannu) and Central part of the Island.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: centro\"\n|- style=\"background:#e8e8e8;\"\n!
