This expedition was led by George Thompson, sent by the London Company of Adventurers, with the objective of opening trade with Timbuktu.\nExpedition\nLeaving his ship, the Catherine, at Gassan (Kassang), Thompson proceeded with a small party in boats up the Neriko river. During his absence, the crew of the Catherine was massacred by Portuguese slave traders under Hector Nunez. All Englishmen present at Gassan were killed in the surprise assault.\nSome of Thompson's party managed to return overland to Cape Verde and subsequently to England. Meanwhile, Thompson remained in the Gambia with seven companions but was killed by one of them after a sudden quarrel or supposedly by natives.\nAftermath\nAnother expedition under Richard Jobson was later dispatched, which seized Portuguese shipping in retaliation for the massacre. Jobson also traveled to Neriko, reporting the commercial potential of the river. However, both his and previous expeditions resulted in significant losses, leading patentees to abandon their attempts in the Gambia and refocus on the Gold Coast.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
