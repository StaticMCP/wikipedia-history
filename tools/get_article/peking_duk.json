The pair first garnered attention in 2012 with the release of a Passion Pit bootleg remix. Their biggest hit, \"High\", reached 5 on the ARIA Singles Chart, achieved a triple platinum certification, and won the ARIA Award for Best Dance Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 2014. Notable festivals Peking Duk have performed include Falls Festival, Spilt Milk, Splendour in the Grass, and Big Day Out.\nHistory\nPeking Duk was formed in 2010 in Canberra, Australia, by Adam Hyde and Reuben Styles. The pair had started off in their local city of Canberra. Styles had been the bass guitarist for local indie rock group, Rubycon, from 2007 to 2010. They released their debut single \"Bingo Trippin'\" in May 2011. Upon the release of their Passion Pit bootleg remix in May 2012, the pair gained attention from music blogs.\nIn February 2013 Peking Duk released \"The Way You Are\", their first international single. Peking Duk placed 4th in the Australia wide InTheMix Top 50 competition in 2013. This was their second year in a row in the top 10 of the competition (6th in 2012). 2013 also saw Peking Duk receive strong support from national youth broadcaster Triple J. Along with having their tracks added to rotation, Triple J also gave Peking Duk the opportunity to be a Triple J Mix Up resident which saw them present and host a weekly DJ Mix on Saturday nights for a month. In August 2013, Peking Duk released \"Feels Like\".\nIn February 2014, they had their first Top 40 hit on the ARIA Singles Chart with their track \"High\" featuring Australian vocalist Nicole Millar. In August 2014, Peking Duk signed a worldwide record deal with Sony Music Entertainment in conjunction with RCA Records. In July 2015, Peking Duk released the single called \"Say My Name\" featuring Benjamin Joseph. Peking Duk released an international EP titled Songs to Sweat To.\nAt 12:48pm UTC on 2 December 2015, at a show in Melbourne, a fan named David Spargo accessed the backstage area by anonymously editing the band's Wikipedia page and inserting the text \"Family David Spargo\" at the end of the lead section. Upon showing the article and his ID to the security guards, he was granted access to the band with whom he shared a beer. The band reacted positively to this scheme, stating: \"He explained to us his amazing tactic to get past security to hang with us and we immediately cracked him a beer. This dude is the definition of a legend.\" However, Hyde did add: \"It goes to show, never trust Wikipedia\".\nIn March 2019, the pair embarked on their biggest national tour to date bringing along Kwame and Kira Puru as supports. In April 2020, Australian radio station Triple J premiered a new song by the duo in collaboration with Ben O'Connor called \"Stay The F*ck Home\", as part of a COVID-19 self-isolation musical challenge nicknamed Quarantune.\nThe duo collaborated with Australian artists Julia Stone and Dean Brady in March 2023 for their Like a Version of Crowded House's single \"Fall at Your Feet\". The song was voted in as number 64 on the Triple J Hottest 100 2023, the highest Like of a Version of the year.\nDiscography\nExtended plays\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of extended plays, with selected chart positions\n!
