It was written by Bob Hilliard and Carl Sigman, published in 1947 and later included in the 1947 Broadway musical Angel in the Wings, sung by Elaine Stritch. The song is sometimes also known as \"'''Bongo, Bongo, Bongo (I Don't Want to Leave the Congo)'''\", from the first line of its chorus. The sheet music gives the title as \"Civilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo)\".\nContent\nThe song is a satire of modern society sung from the perspective of an African tribesman. The tribesman has heard from missionaries that \"civilization is fine\", but he remains unconvinced: civilized people spend their lives working in cramped and noisy cities and have to deal with such annoyances as landlords, doorbells, and automobile accidents. Whenever they get time off, they rush to vacation spots to swim and fish, but the tribesman's lifestyle allows him to do this all year. Bringing up the atom bomb, he refuses to argue any further and concludes that it would be better to stay in the jungles of the Congo, where no modern \"conveniences\" will bother him.\nRecordings\nAt least five recorded versions made the Billboard charts: by The Andrews Sisters and Danny Kaye, by Louis Prima, by \"Smilin'\" Jack Smith, by Ray McKinley, and by Woody Herman.\nThe Andrews Sisters and Danny Kaye recording was made September 27, 1947, and released by Decca Records as catalog number 23940.

It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label BD&nbsp;6007. Dyan Cannon performed the song on The Muppet Show along with several Muppet jungle animals.\nAlthough Elaine Stritch sang it on Broadway, she did not record it until the 1977 album Make Mine Manhattan: Great Revues Revisited. It was included in her 2002 one woman stage show Elaine Stritch at Liberty. In 1967, a version of the song was included on Disneyland Records \"Songs From 'The Jungle Book' And Other Jungle Favorites\" (STER1304).\nThe song was translated into Finnish titled as \"Bingo bango bongo\" by Tapio Lahtinen. It was recorded by both Henry Theel and Olavi Virta in 1948. Lasse Mårtenson (1963), Hullujussi (1974), How Many Sisters (1983), and Lissun Baari (1997) have also released their versions in Finnish.\nAn Italian version translated by Alberto Curci was made popular in Italy, sung by Nilla Pizzi and Luciano Benevene in 1947, and also sung by Sophia Loren in the 1954 movie ''Too Bad She's Bad. It was again brought to popularity in 1985 when Renzo Arbore used it in a popular TV show (Quelli della notte), and as a single release by comedy actor Christian De Sica in 1994.\nThe song was translated into German by Carl-Ulrich Blecher and set to music by Bully Buhlan in 1949 under the title \"Bongo Bongo Bongo\". In the 1950s, the band Die 3 Travellers and jazz musician Horst Winter each adapted the song. A version by the boy band Ulrich Tukur & Die Rhythmus Boys followed in 2001.\nOther appearances\n* The 1950 Screen Songs animated short Jingle Jangle Jungle'' features a lion inviting the audience to sing along to the song to explain why he doesn't want to join a circus.\n* \"Civilization\", performed by Danny Kaye and the Andrews Sisters, is featured on the in-game Galaxy News Radio in the 2008 video game Fallout 3, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futurist United States in the year 2277 in the ruins of Washington D.C. The song is also included on Diamond City Radio in Fallout 4, the fifth major installment of the Fallout series, which takes place in the post-apocalyptic ruins of Boston in the year 2287, as well as in Fallout 76 on Appalachia Radio. Several characters note the irony of the song as most civilization has collapsed after nuclear war.\n* Louis Prima's recording of \"Civilization\" is heard playing on the radio in Adrian Lyne's 1997 film Lolita.\n* Sofia Loren lilts the song several times in Alessandro Blasetti's 1955 film ''Too Bad She's Bad''\n* In Terence Davies's 1992 film The Long Day Closes, a man sings the song\nReferences"
