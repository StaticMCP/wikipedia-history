It was directed by Dan Attias and written by Scott M. Gimple, and originally aired on AMC in the United States on November 18, 2012.\nThis episode marks the final appearance for Emma Bell (Amy), Andrew Rothenberg (Jim) and Jeryl Prescott Sales (Jacqui).\nPlot\nWoodbury\nAndrea volunteers for sentry duty and is trained to use a bow and arrow by one of the town guards, Haley (Alexa Nikolas). When a walker approaches and their arrows fail to fell it, Andrea jumps over the wall and kills the walker with a knife. She is chastised by Haley for breaking the rules and called to The Governor. Andrea says that seeing the fight between Merle and Martinez the night before had invigorated her. Andrea spends the night with The Governor and they have sex.\nMeanwhile, Merle and three others from Woodbury have been tasked by The Governor to locate Michonne, who had left the town. She ambushes them, killing two of Merle's men. Merle shoots Michonne in the leg, she then runs off. Merle is left with the inexperienced Gargulio (Dave Davis) to track her. Merle continues the pursuit, and eventually the two of them engage in a fight. The fight draws walkers which pin them down. Michonne escapes by slicing open one, spilling its entrails on her and allowing her to flee unnoticed, while Gargulio helps Merle to break free. Recognizing Michonne is heading for the dangerous Red Zone, Merle calls off the hunt and returns to Woodbury, with the intent to say that he killed Michonne. Gargulio refuses to lie to The Governor, and Merle decides to kill him. Merle and Michonne both separately converge on a shopping mall where Glenn and Maggie are gathering supplies for the newborn. Michonne stays hidden as Merle approaches the two having recognized Glenn as part of Rick's group that had left him to die in Atlanta. He forces the two to drive him back to Woodbury. Michonne, overhearing the conversation, gathers the supplies Glenn and Maggie obtained and makes her way to the prison. In Woodbury, as Glenn and Maggie are locked into separate rooms for later interrogation, Merle explains how he had killed Michonne.\nPrison\nRick, still trying to cope with the death of his wife, Lori, after childbirth, is alone in the prison boiler room where she had died when the phone rings. He answers it to hear the voice of Amy telling him she is in a safe place and will call back later. Later, a second call from Jim asks him to explain his justification for killing other people and berates him for refusing to talk about Lori's death before dropping the call. A third call from Jacqui draws Rick to try to explain his refusal to talk about Lori's death. Finally, the last call is from Lori; realization dawns on him that these calls have come from those that have died, and all imagined as part of his grief. He leaves the boiler room, cleans himself up, and goes to join the rest of the group, seeing his daughter for the first time since he saw Maggie carry her into the yard after she was born.\nRick spots Michonne waiting patiently outside with supplies for the newborn, the walker guts she was covered in masking her presence from the walkers that surround the prison. Inside, Daryl, Oscar, and Carl, are clearing out walkers when Daryl spots one with Carol's knife in it, who they thought had died in the previous walker infestation. Seeing a secured door nearby, Daryl psyches himself up to confront Carol as a walker, only to open it and discover Carol inside, exhausted but alive. He carries her back to the cells.\nReception\nCritical response\nZack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the episode an A&minus; on an A to F scale. Of the multiple storylines weaved in this episode, he felt that Rick's was the strongest and Andrea's the weakest, but also noted that Andrea has become \"more interesting\" with her confession about enjoying the fights from the previous episode.\nRatings\nUpon its initial broadcast on November 18, 2012, \"Hounded\" was watched by an estimated 9.21 million viewers, decreasing in roughly a million viewers from the previous episode.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.amc.com/twdu/the-walking-dead/season-3/episode-6 \"Hounded\"] at AMC\n*"
