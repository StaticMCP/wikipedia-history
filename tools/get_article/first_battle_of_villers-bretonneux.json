The offensive began against the British Fifth Army and the Third Army on the Somme and pushed back the British and French reinforcements on the north side of the Somme. The capture of Villers-Bretonneux, close to Amiens, a strategically important road- and rail-junction, would have brought the Germans within artillery-range. In late March, Australian troops were brought south from Belgium as reinforcements to help shore up the line and in early April the Germans launched an attack to capture Villers-Bretonneux. After a determined defence by British and Australian troops, the attackers were close to success until a counter-attack by the 9th Australian Infantry Brigade and by British troops, late in the afternoon of 4 April, restored the line and halted the German advance on Amiens.\nBackground\nIn early 1918, following the capitulation of the Russian Empire, the end of the fighting on the Eastern Front allowed the Germans to transfer a significant amount of manpower and equipment to the Western Front. With the general position for the Germans looking weak, the German commander, Erich Ludendorff, decided to go on the offensive. On 21 March 1918, Operation Michael was launched and the attack was aimed at the weakest part of the British lines, along the Somme River. By 5 April, the Germans had gained  of British held territory. Two other operations were launched, one near Armentières, one near Reims. All three operations were eventually halted by the Allies.\nBattle\nIn late March 1918, the German army advanced towards the vital rail-head at Amiens, pushing the British line back towards the town of Villers-Bretonneux. On 29 March, Lieutenant-General John Monash, then commander of the Australian 3rd Division, in Belgium, detached the 9th Australian Infantry Brigade (consisting of four battalions), and sent it south to Villers-Bretonneux, to  prevent a breach of the line between the British Fifth Army (General Hubert Gough) and the French First Army (General Marie-Eugène Debeney) that was positioned to the south. On 30 March, the Germans attacked around Le Hamel and although this was turned back, they succeeded in making gains around Hangard Wood.\nOn its left flank, the French First Army fell back, although a counter-attack regained much of the ground.\nFive days later, the Germans renewed their drive towards Villers-Bretonneux, now held by the Australian 9th Brigade, under its acting commander, Colonel Henry Goddard (also commander of the 35th Battalion). From north-west to south-east the line was held by the British 14th (Light) Division, the Australian 9th Brigade and the British 18th (Eastern) Division. The Australians held off the 9th Bavarian Reserve Division and the 18th (Eastern) Division repulsed elements of the Imperial Guards Ersatz Division and Prussian 19th Division.\nOn 4 April, the British 14th (Light) Division fell back, under pressure from the German 228th Division, around Le Hamel. The 41st Brigade had been pushed back for  \"in some disorder\" and then retired to a ridge another  back, which left the right flank of the 42nd Brigade uncovered. That same day, however, the line north-west of Le Hamel was reinforced by the arrival of the 15th Australian Brigade. In the afternoon, the Germans resumed their efforts and forced back the 18th (Eastern) Division in the south, at which point Villers-Bretonneux appeared about to fall. The Germans came within  of the town but Goddard, in command of the sector, ordered a surprise counter-attack in the late afternoon, by the 36th Australian Battalion, supported by a company from the 35th Battalion and elements of a British unit serving temporarily as the 9th Brigade's reserve: 6th Battalion, London Regiment (detached from the 58th Division). Flanking movements by the Australian 33rd and 34th Battalions, as well as British cavalry , helped consolidate the Australian gains. Advancing in a staggered series of short rushes, across separate sectors, the Australians and British pushed two German divisions back towards Monument Wood, then north of Lancer Wood and then to retreat from Villers-Bretonneux itself.\nAftermath\nAnalysis\nFurther fighting around the village took place later in the month during the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. The attack on Villers-Bretonneux was the last significant German attack of Operation Michael (known to the British as the First Battle of the Somme, 1918). After the failure of the German forces to achieve their objectives, Ludendorff ended the offensive to avoid a battle of attrition.\nCasualties\nThe 9th Australian Brigade had  from  engaged. German casualties were not known but there were  in two of the regiments engaged. The 9th Australian Brigade recorded  German soldiers on their front and the 18th (Eastern) Division had \"severe\" losses and took  from the 9th Bavarian Reserve Division, Guard Ersatz Division and 19th Division.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\nBooks\n*\n*\nWebsites\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.awm.gov.au/units/event_105.asp Australian War Memorial – Australian Military Units – Battle of Villers-Bretonneux]\n* [http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-battles/ww1/france/villers-bret.htm Diggerhistory.com – Battle of Villers-Bretonneux]\n* [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_villers_bretonneuxI.html First battle of Villers-Bretonneux]"
