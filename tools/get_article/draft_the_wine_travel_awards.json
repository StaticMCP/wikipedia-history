      "text": "# Draft:The Wine Travel Awards\n\nThe Wine Travel Awards (WTA) is an international wine tourism initiative established by Communication Media Group Drinks+. Drawing on more than 35 years of industry expertise, the WTA was created to promote excellence and foster innovation in global wine tourism.\nThe WTA is structured as more than a traditional award or rating system. Its primary aim is to foster a global community of wine professionals, brands, and enthusiasts. Nominees benefit from a 1.5-year integrated marketing campaign through Drinks+ media channels and partner events, offering long-term visibility and networking opportunities. The initiative is designed to highlight the achievements of all participants, regardless of final placement, emphasizing collaboration and recognition across the wine and tourism sectors.\nStructure and Global Reach\nAs of 2025, the WTA network includes participants from over 44 countries, ranging from internationally renowned producers such as Château Smith Haut Lafitte (France) and Cloudy Bay (New Zealand) to small artisanal wineries.\nThe awards comprise six categories:\n•\tVisiting Card of the Country\n•\tEnogastronomic Events\n•\tEducation in Enotourism\n•\tWine and Food Influencer\n•\tWine Ambassador\n•\tWine Guide\nThe first three categories recognize achievements in tourism and business, while the latter three focus on influential individuals contributing to wine culture and communication. In 2023, the WTA was selected for the Bernard Magrez Start-Up Win Incubator, highlighting its potential for further innovation and growth.\nJudging and Selection Process\nThe WTA employs a two-stage selection process: public voting takes place in March, followed by evaluation by an international professional jury in April. Past jury members have included prominent industry figures such as Robert Joseph, Felicity Carter, Dr. Gergely Szolnoki, Nina Basset, Per Karlsson, Fiona Morrison MW, Tim Hanni MW, Richard Bampfield MW, and others. The process annually results in 16 category winners, alongside Judges’ Choice recognitions and Grand Prix awards, contributing to increased visibility for wine tourism operators worldwide."
