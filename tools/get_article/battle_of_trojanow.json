The Lithuanians, under the command of Duke Vytenis, on Pentecost, June 4, invaded the city of Łęczyca and captured the fortified collegiate church at Tuma. They plundered everything of any value, the priests and people were taken captive and the collegiate church itself was set on fire. During their retreat, they were caught up by the troops of Duke Casimir II at Trojanów. Then Duke Bolesław II of Masovia (married to the daughter of the Lithuanian Duke Traidenis) led to a truce between Casimir II and the Lithuanians, but at the least expected moment the Vytenis broke it and attacked Casimir II, as a result of which the Duke of Łęczyca was killed, and Bolesław II's life was saved by Lawrence, Castellan of Biała. This was the greatest victory of the Lithuanians in their battles against the Poles (in fact against the Łęczyca knights).\nBattle according Jan Długosz\nThis is how polish chronicler Jan Długosz described the battle:In the year of our Lord 1294, Lithuanian Duke Vytenis invades the Łęczyca region with a mounted army of 1,800 men: Lithuanians, Prussians and Samogitians. When, on the Thursday after Pentecost, they forced their way into it through forests and groves with the permission and support of Duke Boleslaw of Mazovia in such silent and unknown array that they misled all who passed them, attacking first the collegiate church in Łęczyca and murdering there or taking captive a great number of the people of men and women who had gathered there to celebrate the feast. They take the prelates, canons and priests of the Lord captive without mercy, and plunder the liturgical vestments, vessels and jewels. The others, who had taken refuge in the church and defended themselves there valiantly, are suffocated and executed by setting fire to the neighbouring houses surrounding the church and transferring the fire to the collegiate church. The enemies then scattered to the villages and settlements and, having taken a great booty in the form of men and cattle, hastened back. Casimir, the Duke of Łęczyca, could not bear the defeat of himself and his army, but with all the knights of the Łęczyca land began to pursue the barbarians. When he caught up with them in the village of Żuków, situated near the town of Sochaczew on the river Bzura (according to others, near the village of Trojanów), disregarding the small number of his army and the cloud of enemies, he threw himself at the barbarians. And after a bloody battle, when many captives escaped in the fervour of the battle, defeated by the barbarian cloud, fighting very bravely in the first ranks, he falls in the largest crowd of enemies and suffers a glorious death. When this (prince) died, the Poles began to flee in all directions. Many of the Poles, avoiding an honourable death, expose themselves to a shameful one. They drowned in the Bzura river beyond which the battle was fought, as the waters then swelled due to rain. The Lithuanians took both the spoils and the victory. And the booty they gathered in the form of Polish prisoners of war was supposedly so great that twenty Christians, Poles, fell to each barbarian in the division. Casimir, the Duke of Łęczyce, left no one behind.  —  Długosz Jan, Roczniki czyli kroniki sławnego Królestwa Polskiego, ks. VII, p. 355 – 356.\nNotes\nReferences"
