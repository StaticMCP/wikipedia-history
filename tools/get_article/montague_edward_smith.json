As an adult he reversed the order of his Christian and middle names, and was known as Montague. Following an education at Bideford Grammar School, Smith was articled to his father in 1823, practising on his own after his father died five years later.\nCareer\nOn 1 November 1830 he joined Gray's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 18 November 1835. Practising on the Western circuit, which had recently seen its best barristers appointed to judicial posts, Smith quickly built up a large practice. On 11 May 1839 he transferred to the Middle Temple, where he became a Bencher on 22 November 1853 and Treasurer in 1863. On 28 June 1853 he was made a Queen's Counsel (QC).\nAt the 1859 general election, Smith was returned as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Truro. He spoke little within Parliament, but did succeed in passing an Act to limit crown suits in 1861. On 7 February 1865 he was made a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, hearing cases such as Readhead v Midland Railway Company, and Rylands v Fletcher. A physical defect made travelling difficult, limiting his effectiveness as a judge of the normal Westminster courts. On 3 November 1871, he moved from the Court of Common Pleas to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and was temporarily replaced by Robert Collier, allowing Collier to also qualify to join the Committee. He retired on 12 December 1881 and died at his home in Park Lane, London, on 3 May 1891. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.\nArms\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
