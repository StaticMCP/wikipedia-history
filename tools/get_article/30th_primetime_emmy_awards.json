The ceremony was broadcast on CBS, from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, Pasadena, California.\nThe top shows of the night were All in the Family, which won its then record fourth Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, and The Rockford Files. CBS continued its streak of dominance by winning its eighth straight Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, this record still stands. Actor Will Geer received three posthumous acting nominations for three different performances, but lost in each category.\nFor the first time in Emmy history, two shows won six major awards, All in the Family became the first show to win six major awards twice, and the miniseries Holocaust tied the record for most wins by a miniseries set the previous year by Roots.\nThis ceremony was interrupted for thirty minutes by a nationally televised address by then-President Jimmy Carter, joined by then-Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and then-Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in which President Carter announced the signing of the Camp David Accords.\nRita Moreno's win made her the third person to become an EGOT.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*All in the Family (CBS)\n** Barney Miller (ABC)\n** M*A*S*H (CBS)\n** Soap (ABC)\n** ''Three's Company (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* The Rockford Files (NBC)\n** Columbo (NBC)\n** Family (ABC)\n** Lou Grant (CBS)\n** Quincy, M.E.
