During his visit to Portugal, from 22 October 1949 to 27 October 1949 several individuals acted as a collegial regency.  Otherwise Franco himself held the role until he died on 20 November 1975. It then passed, for two days, to Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel, to allow for the formalities surrounding the restoration of the House of Bourbon, in the person of King Juan Carlos.\nPresidents of Regency Council (1947–1975)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel\n| align=\"center\" |20 November 1975\n| align=\"center\" |22 November 1975\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Spanish Regents\nReferences"
