Organised by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS), it was named in memory of the awards founder and patron, Andrew Doolan. Established in 2002, the Doolan Award  celebrates the best building in Scotland with eligibility including all types of architectural projects across the country. The architects of the winning building receive the RIAS' Gold Medal. This also included a cash prize through support from the Doolan family and the Scottish Government, with initial winnings of £25,000 making it the ‘richest’ architectural award in the UK. However, as of 2024, the award no longer offers prize money to winners.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Winning work\n!Nominees and works\n|-\n|2002\n|Malcolm Fraser Architects\n|Dance Base, Edinburgh\n|\n*Richard Murphy -
