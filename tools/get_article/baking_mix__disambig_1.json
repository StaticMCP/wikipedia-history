Baking mixes may be commercially manufactured or homemade. Baking mixes that cater to particular dietary needs, such as vegan, gluten-free, or kosher baking mixes, can be bought in many places.\nThe global market for baking mixes, both for home and professional use, has been estimated at over US$1 billion in 2023.\nTypes\nBaking mixes are produced for the preparation of specific foods such as breads, quick breads, pancakes, waffles, cakes, muffins, cookies, brownies pizza dough, biscuits and various desserts, among other foods. Some all-purpose baking mixes, including commercial and homemade varieties, can be used to prepare several types of baked goods, such as biscuits, pizza dough, muffins, cookies and pancakes, among others. Some bread baking mixes are formulated for use in a bread machine.\nIngredients in baking mixes may include flour, bread flour, baking powder, baking soda, yeast, sugar and salt, as well as others depending upon the food type. Gluten-free baking mixes may be prepared using rice flour in place of wheat flour. Dry baking mixes typically require the addition of water or milk, and may also require additional ingredients such as eggs, butter and cooking oil.\nCommercially, the market is divided into dough mixes, complete mixes, and concentrates. A complete mix may be a powdered mixture that needs only water (or water and yeast) added. A concentrate contains flavorful ingredients such as spices and cocoa, but needs additional flour or other bulky ingredients added. Dough mixes are the most common.\nSize\nSome baking mixes are sold in bulk volumes, and the baker measures out the amount needed. In other cases, the mix is sold pre-measured in a commonly desired size, such as enough baking mix to make a particular size of cake. Around 2012, most large American manufacturers of cake mixes reduced the size of their standard cake mixes by about 15% by weight, as a result of rising prices for ingredients. This resulted in complaints from some customers about the mix making smaller cakes or fewer cupcakes. Betty Crocker and Pillsbury mixes shrank from . After the COVID-19 pandemic, another round of shrinkflation resulted in some mixes being reduced to as low as 13 ounces (another 15%). However, not all manufacturers followed this trend of reducing the amount to maintain the price; the King Arthur Baking Company, which makes premium-quality cake mixes, continued to produce  cake mixes.\nThe accumulated changes, which reduced the weight by about a quarter and added additional leavening agents, meant that some recipes based on combining standard-sized cake mixes with other ingredients, such as those in the Cake Mix Doctor cookbook by Anne Byrn, no longer worked. Some home bakers have attempted to compensate for this by adding flour, sugar, and other ingredients to the store-bought mix.\nHistory\nAunt Jemima pancake mix, manufactured by the Pearl Milling Company in 1896, claims to be the first baking mix in the United States.\nBrands and companies\nAsia\nThe sale of baking mixes in Asia is due in part to urbanization and the adoption of Western baked goods as a hobby or social activity.\nUnited States\nAbout a quarter of all baking mixes are sold in North America.

According to General Mills, Bisquick was invented in 1930 after one of their top sales executives met an innovative train dining car chef on a business trip. After the sales executive complimented the chef on his deliciously fresh biscuits, the dining car chef shared that he used a pre-mixed biscuit batter he created consisting of lard, flour, baking powder and salt.
