The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a general aviation facility.\nThe airport is named for Senator Tom Stewart and Congressman Robert A. \"Fats\" Everett.\nFacilities\nThe airport covers 857 acres (347 ha) at an elevation of 346 feet (105 m). Its single runway, 1/19, is 6,503 by 100 feet (1,982 x 30 m).\nFor its services, the airport offers self-serve and full-service fueling, aircraft tie-downs, public and private hangar space, three crew cars, and an A&P mechanic shop based on the northern end of the field, along with bathroom facilities, vending machines, ice bags, multiple grades of piston aircraft oil, and a pilot's lounge. The airport also owns three tugs for the towing of aircraft, a 12/28-volt Start-Cart, and a larger 28/120/208-volt DC/AC diesel ground power unit.\nFor refueling operations, the airport has two above-ground tanks and 1 3,000 gallon fueling truck. Each above ground tank has a capacity of 12,000 gallons: one for 100-octane low-lead Avgas and one for Jet A-1. The Jet A-1 fuel sold there is mixed with Prist, an icing inhibitor. The 3,000 gallon fuel truck carries JET A-1, and has nozzles to facilitate fueling via over-wing and by single-point, along with variable pump speed.\nFor aircraft storage, the airport still retains the two main World War II hangars it had; it maintains them for use as public space, to either be leased or temporarily rented nightly. For private hangar space, the airport has 14 modern T-hangars, which are leased to clients.\nFor the year ending on March 26, 2020 the airport had 41 aircraft based on-field, 32 of which were single-engine piston powered, 5 multi-engine, 2 helicopters, and 2 gliders. The airport averaged 78 aircraft operations per day over the 12-month period: 53% local general aviation, 42% transient general aviation, 5% air taxi, and\n*\n* Manning, Thomas A.
