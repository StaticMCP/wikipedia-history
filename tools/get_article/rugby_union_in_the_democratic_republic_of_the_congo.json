The DRC is a particularly large country, at 2,344,858 km2 (the 12th largest in the world), but without the necessary economy to maintain it.\nThe sport is centred on the national capital, Kinshasa.\nLike many African countries, the historical connection with France is a mixed blessing. For a number of years, Congolese rugby players would leave to play in France, which deprived the sport of any real competition in the DRC.\nSee also\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo national rugby union team\n* Confederation of African Rugby\n* Africa Cup\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071026032351/http://carugby.com/ CAR]\nReferences"
