Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew Hampshire was won by the Democratic nominees, incumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. They defeated Republican nominee, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes of New York, and his running mate Senator Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana.\nWilson won New Hampshire by a very narrow margin of just 0.06283% (one vote in 1,592) and 56 popular votes. In terms of popular vote margin, this is the third-closest state presidential election race on record, behind two in Maryland from 1832 and 1904. In terms of percentage, it stands as the ninth-closest behind the two Maryland elections above, two from California in 1892 and 1912, Kentucky in 1896, Hawaii’s inaugural 1960 election, and the 2000 Florida and New Mexico elections. This is the only presidential election in which New Hampshire voted Democratic while a number of modern-day Democratic-leaning states voted Republican. These states include the fellow New England states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, as well as New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Minnesota, Illinois, and Oregon. It was also the only election in which New Hampshire voted Democratic while Pennsylvania voted Republican until 2016.\nThe giant Rexall drugstore chain made an early opinion poll that predicted Wilson’s narrow victory in New Hampshire and in California almost perfectly, leading to a reputation for accuracy that was to be lost twenty years subsequently.\nThis was the first time since 1852 that Sullivan County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{|width=\"70%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Thomas Woodrow WilsonDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |Charles Evans HughesRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |Allan Louis BensonSocialist\n! colspan=\"2\" |James Franklin HanlyProhibition\n! colspan=\"2\" |Margin\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total votes cast\n|- bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"\n! #\n! %\n! #\n! %\n! #\n! %\n! #\n! %\n! #\n! %\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Belknap\n|  | 2,310\n|  | 46.19%\n|  | 2,579\n|  | 51.57%\n|  | 62\n|  | 1.24%\n|  | 50\n|  | 1.00%\n|  |  -269\n|  |  -5.38%\n|  | 5,001\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Carroll\n|  | 2,003\n|  | 46.65%\n|  | 2,259\n|  | 52.61%\n|  | 22\n|  | 0.51%\n|  | 10\n|  | 0.23%\n|  |  -256\n|  |  -5.96%\n|  | 4,294\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Cheshire\n|  | 2,779\n|  | 44.51%\n|  | 3,337\n|  | 53.44%\n|  | 121\n|  | 1.94%\n|  | 7\n|  | 0.11%\n|  |  -558\n|  |  -8.93%\n|  | 6,244\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Coös\n|  | 3,247\n|  | 51.99%\n|  | 2,762\n|  | 44.22%\n|  | 210\n|  | 3.36%\n|  | 27\n|  | 0.43%\n|  | 485\n|  | 7.77%\n|  | 6,246\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Grafton\n|  | 4,644\n|  | 48.80%\n|  | 4,795\n|  | 50.38%\n|  | 49\n|  | 0.51%\n|  | 29\n|  | 0.30%\n|  |  -151\n|  |  -1.58%\n|  | 9,517\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Hillsborough\n|  | 10,939\n|  | 51.05%\n|  | 9,927\n|  | 46.33%\n|  | 502\n|  | 2.34%\n|  | 60\n|  | 0.28%\n|  | 1,012\n|  | 4.72%\n|  | 21,428\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Merrimack\n|  | 5,967\n|  | 49.14%\n|  | 5,970\n|  | 49.16%\n|  | 160\n|  | 1.32%\n|  | 47\n|  | 0.39%\n|  |  -3\n|  |  -0.02%\n|  | 12,144\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Rockingham\n|  | 5,637\n|  | 48.32%\n|  | 5,866\n|  | 50.29%\n|  | 114\n|  | 0.98%\n|  | 48\n|  | 0.41%\n|  |  -229\n|  |  -1.97%\n|  | 11,665\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  | Strafford\n|  | 4,040\n|  | 49.62%\n|  | 4,037\n|  | 49.58%\n|  | 49\n|  | 0.60%\n|  | 16\n|  | 0.20%\n|  | 3\n|  | 0.04%\n|  | 8,142\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Sullivan\n|  | 2,215\n|  | 49.82%\n|  | 2,193\n|  | 49.33%\n|  | 29\n|  | 0.65%\n|  | 9\n|  | 0.20%\n|  | 22\n|  | 0.49%\n|  | 4,446\n|-\n!Totals!!43,781!!49.12%!!43,725!!49.06%!!1,621!!1.82%!!303!!0.34%!!56!!0.06%!!89,127\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nReferences"
