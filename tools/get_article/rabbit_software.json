Rabbit's later software packaging was slightly different from that of the other software houses of the time, as the cassettes were encased within an outer red box which made them more distinctive on the shop shelves.\nRabbit went into liquidation around the same time Imagine Software had problems.\nGames\nCommodore 64\n*Annihilator\n*Centropods\n*Cyclons\n*Death Star\n*Escape-MCP\n*Galleons\n*Graphics Editor\n*Lancer Lords\n*Monopole\n*Murder\n*Navarone\n*Pakacuda\n*Paratroopers\n*Potty Painter in the Jungle\n*Protector\n*Skramble\n*Stalag 1\n*Supercuda\n*''The Colonel's House\n*Trooper Truck\nVIC-20\n*Alien Soccer\n*Annihilator\n*Anti-Matter Splatter\n*Carrier Attack\n*The Catch\n*Centropods\n*The Colonel's House\n*Cosmic Battle\n*Critters\n*Cyclons\n*Dam Busta\n*Dune Buggy\n*English Invaders\n*Escape MCP\n*Frogger\n*Galactic Crossfire\n*Grave robbers\n*Hopper\n*Jungle\n*Krell\n*Lunar Rescue\n*Myriad\n*Night Crawler\n*Night-Flight\n*Orbis\n*Pakakuda\n*Paratroopers\n*Quackers\n*Rabbit Chase\n*Rabbit Writer\n*Race Fun\n*Ski-Run\n*Skramble\n*Space Phreeks\n*Space Storm\n*Superworm\n*Tank-War\nZX Spectrum\n*The Birds\n*Centropods\n*Death Star\n*The Great Fire of London\n*Lancer Lords\n*Joust\n*Murder\n*Pakacuda\n*Paratroopers\n*Phantasia\n*Potty Painter''\nReferences"
