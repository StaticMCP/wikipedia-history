King was a United States Navy cryptanalyst.\nHe is notable for first falling under suspicion of spying on the United States in 1999;\nthen for confessing following a long and grueling interrogation that he says drove him to consider suicide;\nthen for recanting his confession.\nMichael Gelles, who was then the Naval Criminal Investigative Service's chief forensic psychologist has been criticized for the role he played in King's interrogation.\nKing, who had served in the Navy for 20 years, first fell under suspicion when the report on a routine polygraph classed its results as \"inconclusive\".\nKing was held for 520 days.\nOn March 9, 2001 Commander James P. Winthrop, the investigating officer, recommended dropping all charges against King.\nWinthrop described his recommendation as an \"extraordinary step\":\nThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a hearing to review King's case.\nIn his testimony before the committee Jonathan Turley, one of King's lawyers, said that Navy investigators had seriously violated procedure for holding him for 29 days, and conducting extensive interrogation, before leveling a \"preferred charge\".\nIn his testimony Turley explained that a \"preferred charge\" in the military justice system was not the equivalent of a formal charge in the civilian justice system – those were the charges leveled following an article 32 hearing.\nTurley criticized Navy officials for issuing press releases following King's release that unfairly blackened King's name by implying he was a spy who had to be released due to legal technicalities that were not supported by any evidence.\nReferences"
