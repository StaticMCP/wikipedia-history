It was operated by an agricultural colony within the borders of the Kayalıoğlu neighborhood in Akhisar, with the support of the Alliance Israélite Universelle (AIU) and the Jewish Colonization Association (JCA). The language of instruction at the school was French, with the regular education duration set at 3 years and specialization training durations set at 4 and 5 years. The school, operated by the agricultural colony from its establishment in 1905 until 1924, was converted into a primary school by the Ministry of National Education starting from 1945. The building was actively used until 1994 and is currently in a state of disuse.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
