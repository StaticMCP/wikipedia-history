Opened in 1933 and electrified in 1936, it initially had two tracks, with an additional two added in 1967.  The central part of the line is in a tunnel, which is  long. It then crosses the Vistula by the Średnicowy railway bridge  long located between Poniatowski Bridge and Świętokrzyski Bridge.\nThe line provides a direct link between Warszawa Wschodnia and Warszawa Zachodnia stations.  The pre-1945 Warszawa Główna was located approximately halfway down the line. The station has been replaced by Warszawa Śródmieście and later supplemented by Warszawa Centralna, which is located to the west of the old station.\nSince the 1970s, the older (southern) pair of tracks is used by regional and commuter trains run (until 2005) by PKP/Polregio, and since then by Koleje Mazowieckie and Szybka Kolej Miejska. The regional trains use Warszawa Stadion, Warszawa Powiśle, Warszawa Śródmieście PKP and Warszawa Ochota stations (listed east-to-west), the long-distance trains use Warszawa Centralna. A third set of tracks, which extend as far as the Warszawa Śródmieście WKD railway station, is used by the Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa (WKD) suburban light rail line.\nThe suburban tracks are designated by national railway infrastructure manager PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe as PKP rail line 448 from Warszawa Zachodnia to Warszawa Rembertów through Warszawa Wschodnia, the long distance tracks are a part of PKP rail line 2 (Warszawa Zachodnia - Terespol), while the light rail tracks are PKP rail line  47 (Warszawa Śródmieście WKD - Grodzisk Mazowiecki Radońska).\nGallery\nfile:Wawa srodmiescie poludniowe.jpg|Western part of the Cross-City line running in a cutting\nfile:PL Warszawa Ochota.jpg|Cross-City line at Warszawa Ochota station\nfile:Tunel Średnicowy - Warszawa (6).jpg|Cross city tunnel seen at Warszawa Śródmieście station\nfile:PKP Warszawa Powisle Lipiec 2010.jpg|Mouth of the cross city tunnel at Warszawa Powiśle station\nfile:PL Warsaw linia srednicowa Kruczkowskiego.jpg|Viaduct over Kruczkowskiego street in Powiśle\nfile:Most średnicowy w Warszawie 2021.jpg|Średnicowy Bridge crossing the Vistula River\nReferences"
