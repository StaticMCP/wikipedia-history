Jim Hinson, the superintendent of the Independence district, believed that the KCMO district fought the annexation was because it was a \"pride issue\" and because the KCMO district feared that other parts of the district could secede.\nThe transfer did not include the C. R. Anderson School, which was originally called the Pitcher School. KCMSD annexed the school in 1957, and it became an alternative school for troubled students in the 1980s. It closed in 2000.\nTransfer to Independence School District\n* Van Horn High School (Independence)\n* Nowlin Middle School (Independence)\n* Fairmount Elementary (Independence)\n* Mount Washington Elementary  (Independence) (no longer part of the district, was sold)\n* North Rock Creek / Korte Elementary (Independence)\n* Sugar Creek Elementary (Sugar Creek)\n* Three Trails Elementary (Independence)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://isdschools.org District website]"
