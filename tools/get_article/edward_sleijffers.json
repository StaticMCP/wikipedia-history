He played as a left-arm orthodox bowler.\nSleijffers was born in The Hague, and played his club cricket for HCC. He made his senior debut for the Netherlands in March 1995, age of 17, on a tour of India that included matches against various Indian domestic teams. In June 1996, Sleijffers represented the Netherlands in two one-day fixtures against Pakistan, prior to that team's 1996 tour of England. He took 2/40 in the first match and 3/63 in the second. Sleijffers' last matches for the national team came in the 1999 NatWest Trophy – an English domestic competition where matches held List A status. He took 1/19 in the first match, against Cambridgeshire, but was not called upon to bowl in the second, against the Lancashire Cricket Board, and was not selected in his team's two other games.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/4/4152/4152.html Player profile and statistics] at [https://cricketarchive.com Cricket Archive]\n*[http://www.espncricinfo.com/netherlands/content/player/24950.html Player profile and statistics] at [http://www.espncricinfo.com ESPNcricinfo]"
