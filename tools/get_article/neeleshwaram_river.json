It is the second longest river in the Kasargod district after the Chandragiri River. The 56&nbsp;km long Thejaswini River flows through the Kasargod district eventually emptying into the Kavvayi Backwaters.\nCourse\nThe Thejaswini River originates from the western slopes of the Greater Talacauvery National Park in the Brahmagiri hill ranges of the Western Ghats in Karnataka. Initially the river flows through several eastern hilly towns of the Kasargod district namely, Kozhichal, Odakolly, Palavayal, Pulingome, Theyyeni, Nallompuzha, Cherupuzha, Kadumeni, Kamballur, Vayakkara, Peralam, Bedhur, Perumbatta and Cheemeni. The river then enters the Malabar plains where it passes the towns of Karinthalam, Choyamkode, Kayyoor, Kilayikode and Nileshwaram. At reaching Nileshwaram, its tributary Kariangode River merges with it. Thejaswini then flows through Kariyil, Thuruthy and Thaikkadappuram. At Thuruthy, it bends south emptying into the Kavvayi estuary.\nTributaries\nEdathod river and Mayanganam river are the two tributaries of Neeleshwaram river.\nAccidents\nDuring the course of the river accidents have taken place. In March 2016, two children who went fishing drowned on the Neeleshwaram downstream near Chalakadav river. In March 2015, a girl died and six others were injured when a car fell into the river near Neeleshwaram.\nReferences"
