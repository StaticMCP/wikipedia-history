Since Pluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), space exploration has increasingly focused on these celestial bodies.\nIn 2015 significant milestones in dwarf planet exploration were reached with the flybys of Pluto and Ceres by the New Horizons and Dawn spacecraft.\nTechnical requirements\nExploring dwarf planets demands significant fuel resources, which vary depending on the targeted celestial bodies. However, various methods have been developed to conserve fuel in probes traveling long distances.\ns to ensure communication with Earth over vast distances.]]\nMissions to dwarf planets in the outer Solar System necessitate careful planning and execution, with spacecraft hibernation employed specifically to conserve energy for the prolonged interplanetary journeys. This allows the spacecraft to endure the extended travel time while maintaining essential functions for navigation and communication.\nSuccessful missions to distant dwarf planets also require substantial fuel reserves on board. These reserves are crucial for trajectory adjustments, course corrections, and orbital insertions upon arrival at the target dwarf planet. The spacecraft's propulsion systems must deliver the necessary thrust over long distances to counter the gravitational influences of celestial bodies encountered during the journey.\nGravity assists are critical for optimizing spacecraft trajectories and accelerating them toward their target dwarf planets. During a gravity assist, the spacecraft uses the gravitational pull of celestial bodies, such as planets or moons, to gain momentum and alter its trajectory without expending extra fuel. Careful planning of these maneuvers can significantly reduce travel time and fuel requirements for reaching distant dwarf planets.\nHigh-gain antennas are pivotal in space exploration, especially in missions to distant celestial bodies like dwarf planets. Unlike conventional antennas, high-gain antennas concentrate their radiation pattern into a narrow beam, enhancing signal strength and data transmission rates. This feature is vital for maintaining uninterrupted contact with spacecraft operating in the remote reaches of the Solar System, where radio signals undergo significant attenuation. By leveraging high-gain antennas, mission controllers can receive crucial scientific data and telemetry from spacecraft exploring dwarf planets, enabling real-time monitoring and operational control. Furthermore, these antennas facilitate the exchange of commands and instructions, empowering spacecraft to execute intricate maneuvers and scientific observations autonomously.\nFlyby missions\n2010s\nDawn program (2015)\n, revealing the rugged terrain of Ceres, including one of its prominent features, Ahuna Mons.]]\nIn September 2007, the Dawn spacecraft launched on a mission from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 17 on a mission to explore two of the three largest bodies in the asteroid belt, 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres. After nearly four years, Dawn entered orbit around Vesta on July 16, 2011. Subsequently, on September 5, 2012, it concluded its Vesta mission and commenced its journey to Ceres.\nOn December 1, 2014, Dawn captured images revealing an extended disc around Ceres. In January 2015, it compiled a series of images of Ceres into a stop-motion animation, depicting its rotation in low resolution. Following January 26, 2015, Dawn obtained higher-quality images than those captured by ground telescopes. It entered orbit around Ceres on March 6, 2015.\nOn October 31, 2018, Dawn exhausted its fuel reserves and lost communication with Earth. The spacecraft will remain in orbit around Ceres until at least 2038.\nNew Horizons program (2015)\nprobe from a distance of 35,445 kilometers (22,025 miles), showcasing its intricate nitrogen geology.]]\nIn 2006, the New Horizons probe launched on its mission to explore the Plutonian system.\nIn 2007, New Horizons performed a gravity assist using Jupiter. This maneuver increased the probe's velocity by , cutting its travel time to Pluto by three years.\nOn February 4, 2015, New Horizons entered the Plutonian system, capturing images of Pluto and its moon Charon from about  away. From April to June 2015, New Horizons delivered higher-quality images than those from ground telescopes.\nOn July 14, 2015, the New Horizons probe took close-up photos of Pluto from 18,000 kilometers away. The data collected was transmitted to Earth and received on September 13, 2015.\nProposed probes\n2040s\nIHP-1 (2040)\nIHP-1 is a proposed spacecraft in the Shensuo program (), designed to fly by Jupiter, the dwarf planet Quaoar, and its moon Weywot, before heading into interstellar space.\nIHP-1 is set to launch with IHP-2 and the proposed IHP-3. IHP-1 will use a gravity assist from Earth in December 2027. It will then fly by Jupiter in March 2029, traveling towards the heliosphere. On its way to interstellar space, it will encounter Quaoar and its moon Weywot in 2040.\nProposed probes list\n\"Status\" column legend\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Spacecraft !! Organization !!
