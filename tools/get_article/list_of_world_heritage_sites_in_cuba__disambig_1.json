At that session, \"Old Havana and its Fortifications\", a site including the central, historic portion of the Cuban capital of Havana, as well as Spanish colonial fortifications, was inscribed on the list.\nA variety of Cuban sites are included on the register. Two sites were selected for their natural significance: Alejandro de Humboldt National Park in the eastern provinces of Holguín and Guantánamo, and Desembarco del Granma National Park, named for the yacht which carried the members of the 26th of July Movement who started the Cuban Revolution. City landscapes include Old Havana, Trinidad, and Camagüey, all founded by early Spanish colonists in the 16th century. The sites also include historical agricultural regions, including the coffee plantations of southeastern Cuba, and the tobacco region of Viñales Valley.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.

In 1518, Hernán Cortés began his expedition to conquer Mexico from the port at Trinidad. The city prospered throughout the colonial period in large part due to the success of the local sugar industry. The adjacent Valley de los Ingenios was the origin of the Cuban sugar industry, which emerged in the 18th century. It is home to numerous cane sugar mills, as well as cattle ranches and tobacco plantations.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| San Pedro de la Roca Castle, Santiago de Cuba\n|\n|Santiago de Cuba\n| 1997\n| 841; iv; v (cultural)\n|The large fort was built to defend the important port of Santiago de Cuba.
