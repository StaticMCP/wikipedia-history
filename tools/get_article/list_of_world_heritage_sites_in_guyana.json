Cultural heritage comprises monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological ones). Natural heritage comprises natural features (such as physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened flora and fauna), and natural sites which are important for scientific research, conservation or natural aesthetic. Guyana accepted the convention on 20 June 1977, making its cultural and natural heritage sites eligible for inclusion on the list. There are no World Heritage Sites in the country, but there are five on the tentative list.\nTentative list\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites for nomination consideration. Nominations for the list are only accepted if the site had been on the tentative list. Guyana has five properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" |\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| St. Georges Anglican Cathedral\n|\n|Demerara-Mahaica\n|i (cultural)\n|1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Fort Zeelandia (including Court of Policy Building)\n|\n|Essequibo Islands-West Demerara\n|iii (cultural)\n|1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| City Hall, Georgetown\n|\n|Demerara-Mahaica\n|i (cultural)\n|1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Shell Beach (Almond Beach) Essequibo Coast\n|\n|Barima-Waini\n|x (natural)\n|1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Georgetown's Plantation Structure and Historic Buildings\n|\n|Demerara-Mahaica\n|ii, iv, v (cultural)\n|2005\n|\n|}\nReferences\nSee also\n*List of World Heritage Sites in South America\n**List of World Heritage Sites in Venezuela\n**List of World Heritage Sites in Brazil\n**List of World Heritage Sites in Suriname"
