The red carpet arrivals was hosted by Sonia Kruger and Jules Lund.\nPublic voting for the Most Popular categories were conducted through an online survey from 3 February 2014 to 2 March 2014. Nominations were announced on 31 March 2014. Offspring received the most nominations with eight, followed by Home and Away with six. The Block, ''Hamish & Andy's Gap Year Asia, Paper Giants: Magazine Wars and Redfern Now each received four nominations.\nBackground\nChanges to categories\nIn January 2014, it was revealed that TV Week had eliminated some categories in a bid to shorten the ceremony. The categories for Most Popular New Male Talent and Most Popular New Female Talent were merged into the Most Popular New Talent category to become gender non-specific. The Most Popular Factual Program category was also eliminated and the Most Outstanding New Talent category was renamed Most Outstanding Newcomer.\nNominations announcements\nNominations were announced in two stages on 31 March 2014; the peer-voted Most Outstanding categories were published in the issue of TV Week that hit newsstands in the morning, while the Most Popular categories were announced in the afternoon at the nominations event in Melbourne, which was hosted by Julia Morris and Chris Brown and attended by network stars.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the tables below, winners are listed first and highlighted in bold.\nGold Logie\n{| class=wikitable width=\"50%\"\n|-\n!
