      "text": "# Hardware compatibility list\n\nA hardware compatibility list (HCL) is a list of computer hardware (typically including many types of peripheral devices) that is compatible with a particular operating system or device management software. The list contains both whole computer systems and specific hardware elements including motherboards, sound cards, and video cards. In today's world, there is a vast amount of computer hardware in circulation, and many operating systems too. A hardware compatibility list is a database of hardware models and their compatibility with a certain operating system.\nHCLs can be centrally controlled (one person or team keeps the list of hardware maintained) or user-driven (users submit reviews on hardware they have used).\nThere are many HCLs. Usually, each operating system will have an official HCL on its website.\nSee also\n* System requirements\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Hardware Compatibility List\n\n#REDIRECT Hardware compatibility list"
