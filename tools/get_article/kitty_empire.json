Empire describes herself as a feminist.\nCareer\nEmpire began writing about music at the NME in 1995, continuing for seven years. In 2002, she became pop critic for The Observer. She has also contributed to a variety of publications and broadcasts such as Elle (US), GQ, Radio 4's ''Woman's Hour, Newsnight Review, Uncut and The Scotsman.

Educator Mary Hogarth praises Empire's \"show, don't tell\" approach to writing, her pacing, and her balance of description, perspective, and first-hand experience.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kittyempire Profile] at The Guardian"
