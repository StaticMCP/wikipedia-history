He is currently employed by Heart London on Weekday drivetime from 4pm to 7pm, presenting alongside Kelly Brook (and acting as her personal assistant on the side). He also provides holiday cover for weekday breakfast on Heart FM.\nCareer\nEarly radio career\nJason King (Short King), has formerly presented for Sunshine 855 in Ludlow, Galaxy 101 in Bristol and 96.9 Viking FM in Hull, where he met, and was first paired on-air with, Joel Ross.\nJK and Joel\nKing had become breakfast show host in 1998 after two years on the lunchtime slot, while also hosting a weekend dance music programme called \"Club 969\". After a year of presenting the breakfast slot alone, he was paired up with Ross (a long-time colleague and socialising partner).\nInitially, the arrangement was just for Ross to earn some overtime from his afternoon shift by reading JK's travel reports; but instantly it became clear that the pair had a natural broadcasting rapport as well as great ability to communicate with the audience, and so Ross was relieved of his afternoon duties and elevated to the role of breakfast co-host. Together, they won two Gold Sony Radio Academy Awards for 'Breakfast Show Of The Year' and a Silver for 'Entertainment Show'.\nIn 2011, JK and Joel were guests on the CBBC show Hacker Time.\nThis success led to the pair working together on many other projects in radio and television, until going their separate ways in 2013.\nOther work\nJK took part in the Channel 4 series \"The Games\" where he finished third. He recently appeared on \"Celebrity Poker\", but has since said that he \"''won't be appearing on any more reality shows as [he has] been on too many\". For more information on his career visit the page dedicated to JK and Joel.\nJK also took part in Celebrity Total Wipeout and was the eventual winner\nFrom 23 January 2012 he co-presented Heart Breakfast alongside Lucy Horobin on Heart Solent. On 4 August 2012 he began co-presenting Saturday breakfast alongside Horobin across the Heart Network. From 13 until 29 August 2012 he and Horobin presented Heart Breakfast'' on Heart London, in the absence of Harriet Scott and Jamie Theakston, meaning they were absent from their usual show on Heart Solent. In 2013 JK along with his co-host Lucy moved to Heart London to present weekday drivetime. Since 2019, JK is presenting his radio shows with model & actress Kelly Brook following Horobin's move to Heart Dance.\nPersonal life\nKing attended Tenbury High School.\nAway from the media spotlight, King is a football fan and an animal lover. A farmer's son, he initially wanted to work for the RSPCA. As a young child he lived on a dairy farm with his family.\nKing started dating former ''Hear'Say singer Suzanne Shaw in December 2005, after appearing together on Britain's Worst Celebrity Driver.'' The couple had been friends since Shaw's ''Hear'Say'' days, and lived together with Shaw's son in Yorkshire. They announced their engagement in August 2008, and the couple married on 14 June 2009. On 13 February 2012 it was announced the couple had separated. He is now married to radio DJ Charlie O'Brien who co-presented the weekday breakfast show for Heart Kent with James Hemming.  The couple have a son born February 2015 and a daughter born August 2017.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
