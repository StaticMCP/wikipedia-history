A manga adaptation illustrated by Kai Nadashima began serialization on Overlap's Comic Gardo manga website in May 2021. An anime television series adaptation produced by Quad aired from April to June 2025.\nPremise\nA man has a horrible life due to his righteous and kind nature. He is also unfairly fired and blamed for things he did not do. A being known as the Guide offers to reincarnate him in a new world, so he may live as selfishly as he wishes. After the deal is made, the Guide is revealed to be evil, having amped up and manipulated everyone around him to make the man's life a living hell; even ruining his cheating wife's life as a coup de grace.\nThings begin going haywire for the Guide, as the newly reborn Liam Banfield is living an incredibly good life as the Lord of his planet. His definition of evil is backwards to the new world and all his attempts to build his power to become a tyrant keep backfiring.\nCharacters\n;\n: Toshiya Miyata (previous life)}}\n:Having lived a miserable life being virtuous, Liam decides to be evil in this next life. However, a combination of his long-term plans to strengthen and develop his fiefdom, comparison against the often corrupt and indolent nobility of the Empire, and comedic happenstance, he ends up looking like a benevolent and just ruler. Even his desire for gold looks odd as it has relatively low monetary value in the new world compared to metals like mithril and adamantium.\n;\n:\n:An AI maid robot gifted to Liam on his fifth birthday by his mother, before she and her husband abandoned the Banfield domain for the Imperial Capital Planet.\n;\n:\n:An engineer from the Seventh Imperial Weapons Factory.\n;\n:\n:Former \"Princess Knight\" of the Holy Kingdom of Rosebreyer, captured by Goaz's pirate gang and subjected to inhumane torture after the destruction of her home. She and other victims are rescued by Liam after defeating Goaz's fleet.\n;\n:\n:A malevolent emotion eater, who feeds on misery, despair, and other negative emotions. He made Liam's life hell by helping his cheating wife frame him for tons of things. Because Liam keeps on succeeding in the new world despite the Guide's best efforts to bring misery, Liam continues to hold the misapprehesion that the Guide is his benevolent guardian, with his feelings of gratitude hurting and starving the Guide.\n;\n:\n:A master swordsman hired to teach Liam while claiming expertise in the Way of the Flash style. He is later revealed to be a fraud who taught nonsensical techniques, intending only to collect a payment. After Liam miraculously develops incredible swordsmanship skills from the erroneous instruction, the master flees, fearing execution for his deception.\n;\n:\n:A butler in service to House Banfield since the days of Liam's great-grandfather.\n;\n:\n:Leader of the pirate fleet.\n;Liam's ex-wife\n:A redhead who cheated on him and birthed her lover's daughter. To make matters worse, she used him to pay for everything and accumulated debt that she pushed on him; even getting him fired for embezzlement that someone else did. After the Guide decides to give her horrible luck, she spends the rest of her life in regret; the husband who was always there for her dead, she had nothing to live for.\nMedia\nLight novel\nWritten by Yomu Mishima, ''I'm the Evil Lord of an Intergalactic Empire!'' began serialization on the user-generated novel publishing site Shōsetsuka ni Narō on August 15, 2018.

It is revealed in a past life he was a salaryman with a wife and daughter he loved dearly. However, his company forced him to work long hours for low pay. He also discovered his wife was having an affair, and that his daughter called the other man \"papa\". Things became worse when Liam discovered she was not his biological daughter. The truth exposed, his wife left with their daughter, who admitted she loved her real father more than Liam. Money went missing from his company so Liam was fired, forced to get a job as a construction worker and made to pay child support to his ex-wife and repay the money he was accused of stealing. Soon after he realised he had a terminal illness. Dying in his bed. an entity called the Guide shows Liam his boss stole the money and was his daughter's real father, having schemed with his ex-wife to exploit Liam. Liam wishes desperately for a second chance at life where he will be the one to exploit others for once. The amused Guide offers to reincarnate him and Liam chooses a science fiction/fantasy setting with advanced technology and magic. Liam is allowed to be reborn as the son of a noble who rules an entire planet and wastes no time in spreading misery and evil across the galaxy.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Liam awakens on his family's planet Hydra on his fifth birthday. His mother gifts him an AI robot maid while his father announces they are retiring to the Imperial Home Planet. Liam automatically replaces him as Count, to his surprise. Meanwhile the entity, whom Liam knows as Guide, has Liam's boss exposed as the true criminal and arrested, leaving Liam's ex-wife penniless. Guide gloats that now he gets to watch Liam bring new misery on himself in his next life, revealing he will feed on his suffering and despair once again, but after disappearing into a portal a glowing puppy appears and touches Liam before he dies and is reincarnated. Princess Christiana Rosebreia of Liebe Kingdom defends her planet from an armada of space pirates. Liam's AI maid Amagi is delivered. Liam learns in this universe humans easily reach 600 years of age. His butler Brian warns Liam there is prejudice against AI since AI almost wiped out humanity centuries ago. As such, if Liam is seen spending too much time with Amagi people might think he is suspicious or untrustworthy. Liam learns his parents have actually run away, leaving Liam with their considerable family debts. Liam comes up with a plan. First he programmes Amagi with three Rules of Robot Maids; she must never allow Liam to be harmed, must obey every order he gives her and must not allow herself to come to harm. He then arranges to spend 6 months in an Education Capsule, which will implant at least 10 years of education into his brain.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Liam exits the Education Capsule after two entire years. In his absence Amagi has been managing Hydra's finances, which have improved slightly. However, without a larger budget, Liam's ships and robotic suits are suffering from a lack of maintenance. Liam begins learning to pilot one, and how to fight from master swordsman Yasushi. In secret, Yasushi is a fraud who knows nothing about combat. Christiana responds to an offer of peace from pirate Captain Goaz, but realises too late she was lured away from her planet Mysteria so Goaz' ships could invade. For three years Yasushi trains Liam without actually teaching him anything. Liam asks to learn Yasushi's secret art, the Way of the Flash. Since he made this up Yasushi pretends to quit and Liam is so apologetic he offers him even more money to stay. Liam identifies an official who embezzled funds and had his subordinate executed for the crime. Liam executes the official and swears to purge corruption from his government. Amagi advises this would be possible by replacing the majority of his officials with 30 AI maids who could easily handle the workload. His citizens are unhappy about the execution, until they learn Liam has improved education for their children and boosted the construction industry by building more schools. Liam returns to training to pilot a robot. Afraid of his secret being exposed Yasushi claims Liam should not rely on a mass produced robot with an automatic pilot programme, but with an older robot with much more difficult manual controls. Liam's commander suggests the robot that belonged to Liam's great-grandfather.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Liam decides to repair his great grandfather Alistair's robot, the Avid. Amagi starts to suspect Yasushi is a fraud. Liam summons Imperial Engineer Lieutenant Nias Carlin to repair Avid. Yasushi becomes obsessed with Nias but she ignores him completely. Yasushi vents his frustration by making Liam's fake training even more difficult. Goaz adds Christiana to his collection; beautiful girls he takes pleasure in slowly mutilating to death. Nias finishes restoring Avid as a fully manual robot with no AI. As its movement requires mental focus Avid ends up performing lewd movements when Liam is distracted by Nias' breasts. Yasushi is so jealous he makes Liam's training even harder. Liam becomes depressed when he makes no progress in the Way of the Flash, so Amagi tries to suggest Yasushi is untrustworthy. Liam misinterprets this as his needing to train even harder and after several more years he succeeds in using magic to, in fact, create the Way of the Flash which Yasushi had only faked with trickery. Despite his terror at Liam's impossible skill Yasushi once again convinces Liam he needs even more training, ensuring his employment for a while longer. Pirates target one of Liam's mining planets, so he decides to test his skills in battle by piloting Avid against them. Using the Way of the Flash Liam destroys 30% of their fleet, captures 10% and allows 60% to escape.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Goaz decides to execute his cowardly invasion fleet. Amagi reports that of Liam's 10,000 ships only 3000 are operational, so Liam decides to purchase new ones. Elsewhere, Nias struggles to sell her new combat ships, since the Empire's generals insist on buying ships from her rival Lieutenant Eulisia Moriselle, whose ships are built for luxury. She suddenly realises her ships might appeal to Liam. Guide decides to visit Liam, certain his negative emotions would have built up from his parent's debt and a fraudulent sword master. However, he discovers Liam has restored Hydra's economy and become a master swordsman. Liam decides to buy the second hand ships the Empire is replacing with the luxury ships, so Guide ensures the crews are made up of honourable officers that will not tolerate evil men like Liam and rebel against him. Nias visits Yasushi to ask his advice on approaching Liam. Yasushi believes she is seducing him and shares his clothing fetish with her. Believing he is referring to Liam, Nias attends their meeting wearing sexy panties, a skirt and stockings. Liam, who recalls his ex-wife dressing like that, is unimpressed. Despite having agreed to buy the Empire's ships he also agrees to buy Nias' ships so she will stop exposing herself. Brian worries Liam might never marry a real woman, but becomes convinced there is hope with Nias.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Liam takes delivery of his new ships. Yasushi is certain Liam is seducing Nias and swears revenge. Nias buys some of Liam's captured pirate ships which she is interested in studying. Liam spots a dog on a pirate ship that leads him to the navigation room. There Amagi discovers the pirate ships routinely travel between the Domus and Palmonia warp gates. Liam is certain it is where they hide their headquarters filled with stolen wealth, so he dubs it Treasure Island and decides to capture it. Goaz swears revenge on Liam and takes his fleet to the Palmonia gate. Liam arrives at the Domus gate but is rejected by the Domus Commander as he cannot afford the warp fees. Goaz easily bribes the Palmonia Commander to let his ships through. Liam spots the dog again outside the Domus Commander's office. The Domus Commander sees Goaz ships approaching and bribes his men to leave so they can all claim to have seen nothing. The dog leads Liam to the now empty control room. Liam believes the Domus Commander took pity on him and activated the gate, albeit in the wrong direction, so Liam quickly reverses the direction and returns to his ship. The abrupt change of direction inside the gate accidentally sends Goaz to the warp gate of an Imperial Training Facility filled with 70,000 ships. Liam takes his fleet through the gate and attacks Treasure Island.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = In the past Goaz had his doctor remove Christiana’s eyes and implant them into her hands, so she can watch herself being mutilated. In the present Liam captures Treasure Island and the dog leads him to the torture chamber. The doctor proudly shows off his victims, expecting Liam to be impressed. Liam executes the doctor. Christiana begs Liam to end their suffering. Instead, Liam orders Goaz’ immense fortune spent on medical procedures to completely regenerate their bodies. Hearing of his new wealth Nias uses the same skirt method trying to convince Liam to buy even more ships. Amagi calculates they could afford 5000, and before Liam can stop her Nias flees to place the order for 5000 new ships. Seeing Nias fleeing with her underwear exposed Yasushi sets Liam another fake training exercise to defend against 1000 drones while blindfolded. Yasushi gloats at finally giving Liam the beating he deserves, until Liam suddenly invents a shield of magical energy that destroys the drones. Terrified Liam might soon figure out he is a fake Yasushi declares Liam a Master of the Way of the Flash then quickly retires as Liam’s instructor. Liam sends prayers of gratitude to Guide for giving him an excellent second life. Repulsed by his gratitude Guide swears to somehow plunge Liam into despair.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Liam decides to increase his evil reputation by amassing more money and forming a harem. Sir Thomas of Henfry Trading Company sells Liam the gold he desires as a sign of his wealth. Privately, Thomas cannot understand why Liam believes gold is valuable when it is often discarded as trash. Liam is somewhat disappointed forming a harem is not seen as very evil and is actually expected of him as a Count, plus Brian is eager for Liam to produce an heir. Believing an evil lord should be hated Liam insists on only selecting women that do not like him, confusing Brian. Liam goes out to find such women but finds fashionable women's clothing on Hydra is very different from Japanese clothing and not sexy at all. Amagi points out his female servants were all hired knowing they might be asked to sleep with him one day and would happily wear whatever clothing he wanted. Liam is disappointed as it is impossible to feel like an evil lord forcing his lust on poor women when every woman on Hydra desires him. Christiana awakens in hospital and finds her body restored to that of a teenager, so she decides to spend her life repaying Liam for saving her.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Guide is furious the honourable officers failed to betray Liam as they are actually happy working for him. Yasushi finds his name permanently associated with Liam, no matter how far he tries to run. Goaz manages to escape the Imperial fleet with 30,000 of his ships and with Guide manipulating him decides to target Liam again. Liam laments even mealtimes are boring as they feel too civilised for a gluttonous evil lord. Amagi offers to invite potential harem candidates for dinner, but this merely upsets him that Amagi, being an AI, does not get jealous of other women. Meanwhile, his mass produced AI maids grow restless as just cleaning his mansion leaves them bored most of the time. They are also confused Amagi forbids them from being too close to Liam in case it affects his reputation, even deleting their memories of social interactions despite being sexually intimate with Liam herself. Goaz invades Liam's territory, demanding money and beautiful female hostages. Amagi calculates if they fight Liam only has a 4% chance of victory. Time suddenly freezes and Guide speaks directly to Liam, claiming he wants to help Liam clear his debts even faster, and points out as well as the bounty for Goaz head his 30,000 ships contain even more wealth than Treasure Island. Liam declares immediate war on Goaz.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Liam grows restless after three days without combat, as it turns out war in space between thousands of ships hundreds of miles apart requires considerable strategy before the fighting can even begin. Goaz suddenly sacrifices 500 ships to disrupt Liam's formation then loses even more ships to bombs Liam concealed with magic, but he forces his way through with sheer numbers while hiding his flagship behind force-fields. Brian urges Liam to do the same with his flagship, sacrificing his front line ships in the hope the delay will allow Imperial reinforcements to arrive. In a rousing speech Liam refuses to let Goaz take a single ship from him and flies out on Avid. With Liam no longer aboard the flagship Amagi is able to move it to the front lines and use its more powerful cannons and armour. Liam's knights follow him into battle despite being heavily outnumbered. Avid's right arm starts to break down due to Liam's repeated use of the Way of the Flash and Amagi calculates their chances have dropped from 4% to 1.2%. Liam's sword shatters but he is saved from certain death by Christiana in her new robot Nevan, provided by Eulisia. Liam summons a new sword and unleashes a massive strike that wipes out over half of Goaz' remaining fleet, increasing their chances to 83%. With victory in sight Liam approaches Goaz' flagship.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Seeing the glee with which Christiana cuts down the pirates, her knights fear years of torture have warped her sanity. Liam's officers believe he might just be the most worthy Lord in the Empire. Amagi has all ships fire on Goaz' force-field, punching a hole for Liam to get through. Despite knowing running from battle like a coward will end his piracy career Goaz decides to flee and leave his fleet to die. Before he can escape Liam destroys the engines and the escape ships. Leaving Avid outside, Liam enters the flagship with his men looking for Goaz. Liam's feelings of happiness make Guide physically ill so in desperation he grants Goaz superhuman strength and impenetrable skin. In response the glowing dog appears and leads Liam to a golden cube Goaz dropped and then to a treasure room full of antiques where Liam takes an ornate katana as a trophy. Goaz appears and Liam breaks his sword against his skin, forcing him to use the ornate katana instead. Somehow, the katana severs Goaz' limbs, and though he offers all his secret treasures to let him live, Liam severs his head to collect the Imperial bounty. Despite his victory and the vast wealth it brings Liam is disappointed his epic and long awaited duel with Goaz was rather anticlimactic.\n}}\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Christiana completes her last treatment and shows off her restored body, causing an argument with Nias. Eulishia tries to sell Liam a new Super-Dreadnought but realises such ships are restricted by the Empire. For defeating Goaz Liam is invited to the Imperial home planet. There, Liam is confronted by his parents and two grandparents who ask Liam to increase their allowance, since they have accrued more debts recently. Furious, Liam offers a tiny increase as long as they never speak to him again. Sensing an opportunity Guide manipulates the negative feelings of Liam's family. His parents decide to have Liam legally removed as family head, steal his wealth, then have Liam assassinated. The glowing dog leads Amagi to overhear their plot. Later, the Imperial Chancellor refuses their request to change the family head, pointing out Liam has an excellent reputation, pays his taxes and the Empire even has plans for his future. This means should Liam die mysteriously the Empire would naturally blame his family. Amagi, having convinced the Chancellor to support Liam, is also able to purchase a Super-Dreadnought. As Liam is now almost 50 and about to become a legal adult Amagi announces her intention to leave, since an adult with an AI robot would be vulnerable to attacks on his reputation by his enemies. Liam refutes her logic and appeals to her emotions until she admits leaving him would be painful. Liam also claims if she leaves he will become a dishonourable alcoholic. Amagi agrees to stay to protect Liam from himself. Liam returns home to resume his role as an Evil Lord and feels such overwhelming gratitude for his new life Guide passes out from sheer nausea.\n}}\n}}\nSee also\n* Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games Is Tough for Mobs, another light novel series by the same author\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Shōsetsuka ni Narō\n*\n*\n*\n*"
