Springborg had served as leader of the LNP since the party was formed in 2008 following the merger of the Queensland Liberal Party and the Queensland National Party; the latter he had previously led.\nThree MPs − John-Paul Langbroek, Tim Nicholls and Fiona Simpson − contested the leadership, with Langbroek emerging victorious by a narrow margin on the second ballot. Springborg was elected deputy leader, defeating Jeff Seeney and Rob Messenger, after Mark McArdle did not recontest the position.\nLangbroek would ultimately not lead the LNP to the next state election in 2012, as Brisbane lord mayor Campbell Newman entered state politics and became LNP leader in 2011. Springborg later returned as leader in 2015, but lost a spill to Nicholls in 2016.\nCandidates\nLeader\nDeclared\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=3 |Candidate\n!
