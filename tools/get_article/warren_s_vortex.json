The series is in the same vein as the 2018 television series Wellington Paranormal, which itself is a spin-off of the 2014 film What We Do in the Shadows.  Unlike either of those productions, this series is a single camera narrative comedy.\nThe actor Maaka Pohatu, who has the title role of Warren, previously appeared as Police Sergeant Ruawai Maaka in Wellington Paranormal.\nPremise\nWarren Harrison is a husband and father, living in suburban Lower Hutt, New Zealand, who happens to have an interdimensional vortex in his shed. For the past twenty years, Warren has used it mainly to get rid of his garden rubbish.\nLucy, his 18-year-old daughter, is sucked into the vortex and Warren follows her. The pair travel to a series of different future realities. Several of the supporting cast play variations of their same character in different timelines.\nProduction history\nThe series was created by Nick Ward and Paul Yates, both of whom were involved with Wellington Paranormal as directors and writers. In July 2024, NZ On Air was announced that the production would receive $1,227,000 of funding, though the New Zealand Listener later gave the amount as $1,465.000. Filming took place over the 2024–25 Christmas and New Year period across Lower Hutt. The main characters' house was filmed on location in Fairfield, with other locations including Kelson, Naenae, Taitā, and the Avalon studios.\nCast\nMain\n* Maaka Pohatu as Warren Harrison\n* Louise Jiang as Lucy Harrison (Warren's daughter)\n* Kali Kopae as Hine Harrison (Warren's wife)\n* Ginette McDonald as Mrs Schrödinger (the Harrisons' neighbour)\n* Sophie Hambleton as Laurel, a family friend\n* Cohen Holloway as Muzz, Laurel's estranged husband\n* Tinorawe Hawkins as Bo, Laurel and Muzz's teenage son\n* Millen Baird as Inspector Phil\n* Milo Cawthorne as Darren\n* Mayen Mehta as Ian\n* John Bach as the Narrator\nGuest\n* Hilary Barry as Empress Gold (voice role)\n* Peter Hambleton as Stanky Steve\n* Tanea Heke as Aunty Marama\n* Liz Wyatt as Mombie\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary    = Everyman Warren and his daughter Lucy are hurled through time to a world where intelligent refrigerators have taken over.\n|LineColor       = FFDE00\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Warren and Lucy land in a world where every Kiwi backyard has been turned into a reality TV competition and the stakes are high: you lose, you die!\n|LineColor       = FFDE00\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Warren and Lucy arrive in a world where all the houses are unaffordable and empty, and the real estate agents are laser-eyed robots with familiar faces.\n|LineColor       = FFDE00\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Warren and Lucy return to their street to find everyone zombified by a mobile game.
