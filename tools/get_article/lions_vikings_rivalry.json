Following the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, both teams transitioned to the NFC Central, which was later renamed the NFC North after the NFL's realignment in 2002.  While the two teams initially maintained a closely contested rivalry, the Vikings dominated in the 1970s, taking a big lead over the Lions.\nThe Vikings have outperformed the Lions since the inception of their rivalry and the most one-sided decades occurred during the 1970s and 2000s, where the Vikings went 35–5 against the Lions. Based on winning percentage, it is one of the most lopsided divisional rivalries in the NFL.\nThe Vikings lead the overall series, 81–45–2. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.\nBackground\nDetroit Lions (1930–1960)\nThe Lions were founded in 1930 as the Portsmouth Spartans, located in Portsmouth, Ohio. Due to financial troubles, the team was purchased by George A. Richards, who relocated them to Detroit for the 1934 season and renamed them as the Detroit Lions. The team won its first championship in 1935, but it would subsequently endure decades of mediocrity, failing to qualify for the playoffs since then. By the 1952 season, the Lions experienced a turnaround in their fortunes, being led by Hall-of-Fame quarterback Bobby Layne and head coaches Buddy Parker and George Wilson. During the 1950s, the Lions appeared in four NFL championship games, winning in three of them. During that same timeframe, the Lions were placed in the NFL National Conference following the AAFC–NFL merger, which would be renamed to the Western Conference in the 1953 season. The early 1960s saw the Lions win three consecutive Playoff Bowl, a post-season exhibition game to determine third place.\nMinnesota Vikings\nThe Minnesota Vikings were founded in 1960 by a group of investors led by Max Winter, Bill Boyer, H. P. Skoglund, Ole Haugsrud and Bernard H. Ridder Jr and began playing in the 1961 season. They were placed in the Western Conference, becoming divisional rivals with the Detroit Lions and resulting in two meetings annually.\n1961–1967: Beginning of annual meetings\nThe Lions and Vikings inaugural meeting between one another occurred on November 19, 1961 in Minnesota, which saw the Vikings score the first 10 points in the first quarter before being shut out by the Lions on route to a 37–10 Lions blowout win. On December 10, they would meet again in Detroit for the first time, where the Lions won 13–7, completing a sweep of the inaugural season series against the Vikings.\nThe Lions won their next three games against the Vikings, increasing their winning streak to five, one of their longest. It wasn't until the 1963 season that the Vikings defeated the Lions for the first time, winning 34–31 on November 24 in Minnesota.\nIn the 1964 season on October 11 in Minnesota, a miscommunication led to both the Lions and Vikings starting the game in identical white jerseys, marking the first and only time of two teams wearing the same color in an NFL game. At the start of the second quarter, the Vikings changed into their purple jerseys. The Lions would win the game 24–20.\nLater that season on November 22 in Detroit, Lions' K Wayne Walker kicked a 37-yard field goal under less than a minute left to lead to the first tie result between the two teams.\nIn the 1965 season on December 12 in Detroit, Vikings beat the Lions 29–7 to record their first victory in Detroit.\nIn the 1966 season on November 13 in Minnesota, Lions K Garo Yepremian kicked 6 field goals, setting a then-NFL record, as he helped the Lions beat the Vikings 32–31. The record would be broken by K Jim Bakken in the 1967 season.\nIn the 1967 season, the NFL divided its teams into two eight-team conferences split into two divisions each. Consequently, the Lions and Vikings were placed in the Western Conference and the NFC Central, alongside the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers, thereby continuing their divisional rivalry.\nLater that season on November 12 in Minnesota, the Lions fumbled 11 times in a 10–10 tie against the Vikings, setting an NFL record.\n1968–1985: Bud Grant era, Vikings dominate\nwas dominant against the Lions, compiling a 26–8–1 record in their matchups. This record included a thirteen-game winning streak and a home record of 15–2–1.]]\nIn the 1968 season, the Vikings recorded their first season series sweep against the Lions. This would help the Vikings to clinch their first playoff appearance and division title in franchise history.\nFollowing their loss to the Vikings in Minnesota in the 1969 season, Lions players were forced to bathe in cold water, prompting Lions HC Joe Schmidt to remark that they would give the Vikings \"an ice bath\" in their next game. However, the Lions would be shut out 27–0 in their first Thanksgiving matchup against the Vikings.\nAs a result of the AFL–NFL merger in the 1970 NFL season, the Lions and Vikings were placed in the newly created National Football Conference (NFC) and the NFC Central (later renamed to the NFC North in the 2002 season) alongside the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, continuing their divisional rivalry.\nThat season also saw both teams finishing with double-digit wins and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in the same year. Despite that, the Vikings swept the Lions, a result that would ultimately lead to them clinching the NFC Central title.\nFrom 1968 to 1974, the Vikings went on a 13-game winning streak against the Lions, the longest win streak in the rivalry. The streak included blowout victories, overcoming a 13–0 deficit, and a game-winning block by DB Bobby Bryant on Errol Mann's 33-yard field goal attempt in the game's final play. The Vikings also took the overall series lead with their win in the 1971 season, a lead that they have yet to relinquish.\nIt was not until October 20, 1974, in Minnesota that the Lions defeated the Vikings 20–16 to snap their 13-game losing streak. Additionally, the Lions would also snap their 7-game losing streak at home against the Vikings in 1975.\nIn the Detroit meeting in the 1976 season, the Vikings arrived 5 minutes prior to the scheduled kickoff time, resulting in a half-hour delay for the game to start. The Vikings would be fined 5,000 dollars. Despite the setback, the Vikings held on to a 10–9 victory after Lions Holder Joe Reed mishandled a snap, and Errol Mann's attempt for an extra point was missed following a late touchdown by the Lions.\nLater that season in their meeting at Minnesota, Vikings rookie WR Sammy Write set a Minnesota single-game receiving record with 210 receiving yards, contributing to the Vikings' victory over the Lions. The record would be surpassed by WR Justin Jefferson in a 2022 season game, coincidentally against the Lions.\nIn the 1978 season on December 9 in Detroit, the Lions put together one of their most dominating wins against the Vikings. They beat the Vikings 45–14, their most points scored in a game against the Vikings. Lions QB Gary Danielson finished with 5 passing touchdowns, becoming the first Lions quarterback to throw for five touchdowns in a game.\nIn the 1980 season, the Lions beat the Vikings in Detroit and improved to a 4–0 record, one of their best starts in franchise history. However, the Vikings got their revenge in Minnesota, where they shutout the Lions 34–0 to record the first shutout in the series. The Vikings defense sacked Gary Danielson seven times and forced eight Lions turnovers. The final score, 34–0, is also the Vikings' largest victory against the Lions with a 34–point differential. Despite a strong start from the Lions and a poor start for the Vikings, both teams finished the season with 9–7 records. However, the Vikings had the better conference record than the Lions, allowing them to clinch the NFC Central, their 11th in 13 years, while also eliminating the Lions from playoff contention.\nIn the 1981 season, the Vikings won the first meeting in Minnesota, when K Rick Danmeier kicked the game-winning 20-yard field goal with four seconds left. However, in the meeting in Detroit, the Lions exacted revenge where they recorded one of their most dominating victories against the Vikings, winning 45–7. They recorded their largest victory over the Vikings with a 38–point differential and tied their most points scored in a game against the Vikings since the 1978 game.\nDue to the 1982 NFL Players strike, the game scheduled in Minnesota was canceled, making this the only season in which the Lions and Vikings did not face each other at least twice in the regular season.\nDespite losing the first meeting in 1983, the Lions won the second matchup against the Vikings, a victory that helped them clinch the NFC Central Division title, their first division championship since the 1957 season. Meanwhile, the Vikings, who started the season 6–2, missed the playoffs after finishing 2–6 in their final eight games.\nIn the 1984 season on October 21 at Minnesota, Lions RB Billy Sims suffered a catastrophic injury to his right knee. During the game, he became the franchise's all-time leading rusher with 5,106 yards, a record later surpassed by Barry Sanders. The injury ultimately ended Sims' career, as he never played again and officially retired in 1986.\nThe 1985 season marked Bud Grant’s final year as head coach of the Vikings. He finished his career with a 26–8–1 record against the Lions, which included a thirteen-game winning streak, the longest in the rivalry, and a 15–2–1 record at home.\n1986–1990: Vikings continue their dominance\nEven after Bud Grant's departure, the Vikings continued to make playoff appearances and maintained a strong record against the Lions. This was particularly evident during the 1988 season. In their November 6 matchup in Minnesota, the Vikings defeated the Lions 44–17, their most points scored in a game against the Lions. Later that season, during their Thanksgiving Day game in Detroit, the Vikings shut out the Lions 23–0. The Lions managed only 60 total yards in the game, setting a franchise record for the fewest total yards in a single game. They also finished with 3 first downs, tying a franchise record. Meanwhile, the Vikings tied a franchise record for the fewest yards allowed in a game and set a franchise record for fewest first downs allowed with 3. By the end of the decade, the Vikings had a 7-game winning streak over the Lions.\n1991–1999: Lions and Vikings compete for playoffs\n, Lions running back Barry Sanders (pictured) rushed for a touchdown with 43 seconds remaining, completing a comeback from a 20–3 fourth-quarter deficit to secure the win. In their second meeting, Sanders rushed for 220 yards and four touchdowns, both franchise records, as he led the Lions to their first season sweep of the Vikings since the 1962 season.|alt=A picture of Sanders in a black shirt and looking at the camera.]]\nBoth teams were strong contenders in the 1990s, regularly vying for playoff spots and the NFC Central division title.\nDuring the 1991 NFL season, the Lions hosted the Vikings in a memorable matchup in which the Lions overcame a 20–3 fourth quarter deficit. After a Vikings field goal extended their lead to 20–3 with 8:38 remaining, the Lions mounted a dramatic comeback. RB Barry Sanders scored the game-winning touchdown on a 15-yard run, securing a 24–20 victory for Detroit. Sanders finished the game with 116 rushing yards on 25 carries, his fourth consecutive 100-yard performance, and added 9 receptions for 76 receiving yards.\nIn their next meeting that season, held in Minnesota, the Lions delivered one of their strongest performances against the Vikings. The Lions' defense intercepted QB Rich Gannon three times and recorded six sacks. On offense, Barry Sanders had one of the most outstanding games of his career, rushing for 220 yards and four touchdowns as he led the Lions to a 34–14 victory. The 220 rushing yards set a franchise record for the most in a single game by a player, a mark Sanders would later surpass himself in 1994. His four rushing touchdowns also set a franchise record for the most in a single game by a player, a record that still stands. The victory completed a season sweep of the Vikings for the first time since the 1962 season, ending a 29-year drought.\nThe Vikings would get their revenge in 1994, holding Sanders to just 16 yards on 12 carries, one of the worst performances of his career, in a 10–3 Minnesota victory.\nIn their next meeting, the Lions dominated the Vikings with a 41–19 victory, securing consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1972–1973. One bright spot for Minnesota came when wide receiver Cris Carter set a new NFL record for most receptions in a single season, a record that would be broken the following year by Herman Moore, a Lions player.\nIn the 1995 season matchup in Minnesota, Vikings kicker Fuad Reveiz set an NFL record by making his 30th consecutive field goal, surpassing the previous mark of 29 set by San Diego Chargers's John Carney in the 1992–93 seasons. The Vikings also successfully limited Sanders once again, holding him to just 35 yards on 13 carries.\nIn their Thanksgiving matchup in Detroit, the two teams played the highest-scoring game in the history of the rivalry. The Lions defeated the Vikings 44–38 in a game that featured ten touchdowns and a combined 919 yards of total offense. Lions quarterback Scott Mitchell threw for 410 yards, setting a franchise record for most passing yards in a single game, a record that would later be broken in 2001.\nIn the 1997 season, the Lions defeated the Vikings 38–15 in Detroit, ending the Vikings’ six-game winning streak. In their rematch in Minnesota, Lions wide receiver Herman Moore caught a 1-yard alley-oop touchdown pass with three seconds remaining on the game's final play to secure a 14–13 victory and a season sweep of the Vikings. The loss marked the beginning of a late-season collapse for Minnesota, who had started the year 8–2 but went on to lose five straight games, beginning with the defeat in Detroit.\nIn the 1999 season, Lions kicker Jason Hanson made six field goals, including a 48-yarder with seven seconds remaining, to give the Lions a 25–23 victory over the Vikings. Hanson tied the franchise record for most field goals made in a single game, originally set by Garo Yepremian in a 1966 game, also against Minnesota. The Vikings, who had trailed 19–0 at halftime, rallied to take a 23–22 lead on Gary Anderson’s 26-yard field goal with 1:40 remaining, but it ultimately wasn’t enough.\nIn the 2000 season in Minnesota, the Vikings clinched a playoff berth with their victory over the Lions. In the same game, wide receiver Cris Carter became the second player in NFL history to record 1,000 career receptions.\n2001-2009: Vikings dominate the decade\nIn the 2001 season, the Lions earned their first win of the year by defeating the Vikings at home. In their earlier meeting in Minnesota, the Lions nearly overcame a 31–6 deficit but ultimately lost 31–26. A similar situation nearly occurred in the rematch, as Detroit led 20–7 at halftime before the Vikings scored 17 unanswered points to take a 24–20 lead early in the fourth quarter. The Lions regained the lead on their next drive and held off Minnesota to secure a 27–24 victory, marking their first win of the season after starting 0–12.\nThe Vikings earned revenge in their 2002 season meeting in Minnesota, rallying in the fourth quarter and intercepting a Lions pass in the red zone on Detroit’s final drive to secure a 31–24 victory.\nThis win began a ten-game winning streak for the Vikings against the Lions, during which Minnesota did not lose to Detroit until the 2007 season. In that 2007 matchup at Ford Field, the Lions built a 17–7 lead before the Vikings rallied. A scoreless fourth quarter, in which both teams missed potential game-winning field goals, sent the game into overtime. The Vikings received the ball first, but a fumble by quarterback Brooks Bollinger led to a Lions game-winning 37-yard field goal, snapping their ten-game losing streak against Minnesota.\nThe Vikings’ 2008 home meeting with the Lions was marked by several controversial moments. In the first quarter, Lions quarterback Dan Orlovsky committed a widely remembered mistake when he inadvertently stepped out of the back of the end zone for a safety. In the fourth quarter, Orlovsky connected with wide receiver Calvin Johnson on a 32-yard pass down the middle that appeared to place Detroit at the Minnesota 30-yard line. However, officials ruled that Johnson had fumbled after being hit by Vikings safety Darren Sharper, despite replays suggesting Johnson may have been down by contact. Later, with the Lions trailing 10–9 in the final three minutes, the Vikings faced a 2nd-and-20 from their own 32-yard line. Quarterback Gus Frerotte threw deep toward wide receiver Aundrae Allison, and although the pass fell incomplete, field judge Mike Weir called Lions cornerback Leigh Bodden for pass interference despite what appeared to be minimal contact. The penalty placed Minnesota in field-goal range, setting up a 26-yard kick by Ryan Longwell with nine seconds remaining, giving the Vikings a 12–10 victory. The loss was particularly painful for Detroit, which went on to become the first team in NFL history to finish the season 0–16.\nThe Lions’ struggles continued into the 2009 season in their home meeting with the Vikings. In their matchup in Detroit, during which Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre set the NFL record for consecutive starts at 271, the Lions were defeated once again, extending their losing streak to 19 games, tying the second-longest skid in league history.\nBy the end of the 2000s decade, the Vikings had dominated the Lions, compiling an 18–2 record against Detroit.\n2020s: Lions and Vikings compete for playoffs\nIn the 2021 offseason, the Lions decided to trade QB Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for QB Jared Goff, a 2021 third-round pick and two first-round picks in 2022 and 2023.\nIn the 2021 season, the Lions and Vikings experienced slow starts before their encounter in Minneapolis on October 10. Going into the 4th quarter, the Vikings held a 13–6 lead. K Greg Joseph added to the Vikings' score by making another field goal, increasing their lead to 16–6. A failed 4th down attempt by the Lions allowed the Vikings to gain possession on Detroit's 34-yard line. Despite having successfully converted 3 field goals earlier, Joseph missed the 49-yard field goal. The Lions quickly responded by converting a field goal, making it 16–9. The Vikings encountered misfortune as RB Alexander Mattison fumbled the ball, allowing LB Jalen Reeves-Maybin to recover it at Minnesota's 20-yard line with less than 2 minutes remaining. RB D'Andre Swift capitalized on the turnover by scoring a touchdown. Instead of playing it safe and aiming for overtime, HC Dan Campbell decided to go for a two-point conversion. Goff's pass to WR KhaDarel Hodge successfully put the Lions ahead at 17–16. The Vikings got the ball back with 33 seconds left. QB Kirk Cousins completed two deep passes to WR Adam Thielen for 40 yards and one pass to WR Dede Westbrook for 6 yards to set up a 54-yard game-winning field goal try with 3 seconds left. Joseph redeemed himself by successfully making the kick, securing a thrilling 19–17 victory for the Vikings. This win also marked the eighth consecutive victory for the Vikings over the Lions. After suffering consecutive defeats on game-winning field goals (the first one against the Baltimore Ravens),  Dan Campbell was visibly emotional during the post-game press conference. He expressed, \"When you see your players give all that they have and you lose that way, it's tough. You know, you don't want that for them.\"\nThe Lions were still on the hunt for their first win of the season when they clashed again in Detroit on December 5. With a standing of 0–10–1, their most recent victory dated back to December 6, 2020, against the Chicago Bears, slightly over a year ago. The Vikings took a 6–0 lead in the 1st quarter, but the Lions swiftly turned the tables by scoring 20 consecutive points, resulting in a 20–6 lead for them at halftime. The Vikings trimmed the lead to 23–21 by the start of the 4th quarter. With hopes of closing out the game, the Lions took a risk by going for it on 4th-and-one from their own 28-yard line. However, Goff was sacked by LB Blake Lynch and fumbled the ball, which Lynch promptly recovered. The Vikings took advantage of this turnover, with Cousins connecting with WR Justin Jefferson for a touchdown, giving them a 27–23 lead with only 1:50 left on the clock. Without any timeouts, Goff engineered a 75-yard drive into Minnesota territory. In the final play with just 4 seconds left, Goff connected with WR Amon-Ra St. Brown for an 11-yard touchdown pass, securing a 29–27 Lions victory. The Lions not only ended an eight-game losing streak against the Vikings but also celebrated their first win in 364 days.\nSeason-by-season results\n;|title= Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings Season-by-Season Results}}\n;|title=1960s (Lions, 9–7–2)|Season||at Detroit Lions |at Minnesota Vikings||Notes}}\n|-\n|\n| style=\"|\n| style=\"| Lions13–7\n| style=\"| Lions37–10\n| Lions2–0\n| Vikings join the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team.
