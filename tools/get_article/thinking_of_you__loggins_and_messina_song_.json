      "text": "# Thinking of You (Loggins and Messina song)\n\n}}\n\"Thinking of You\" is a song by American duo Loggins and Messina. It was released in 1973 as the second single from their second album, Loggins and Messina.  The uptempo rendition released on the single is different from the somewhat more mellow LP mix.\n\"Thinking of You\" reached number 18 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 11 on the Cash Box Top 100. It reached number 20 in Canada.\nThe song was a bigger Adult Contemporary hit, reaching number seven in the U.S. and number 16 in Canada.  The track speaks of the essence of partnership, and of the joy found while spending time in each other's company.\nPersonnel\n* Jim Messina – lead vocals, electric guitars\n* Kenny Loggins – harmony vocals, classical acoustic guitar, harmonica\n* Al Garth – fiddle, recorder(?)\n* Jon Clarke – oboe, recorder(?)\n* Larry Sims – bass, backing vocals\n* Merel Bregante – brushed drums, possible backing vocals\n* Michael Omartian – clavinet, Wurlitzer electric piano\n* Milt Holland – castanets, temple blocks\nIt is unclear if it is Garth or Clarke who overdubbed the recorder.\nChart performance\nWeekly singles charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1973)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n| Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|65\n|-\n| Canadian Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n| Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|-\n| U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n| U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n| U.S. Cash Box Top 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1973)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|141\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
