The battle ended with a partial Norwegian defeat as they were unable to hold their lines against German advance. Norwegians managed to withdraw in order destroying the strategic bridge so Germans would not be able to use it. Germans soon built an improvised bridge in the same place they named \"Brandenburg\".\nSee also\n* List of Norwegian military equipment of World War II\n* List of German military equipment of World War II\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170816112236/http://www.etnedal.kommune.no/Handlers/fh.ashx?MId1=628&FilId=2056 Valdres, 1940]\n*[https://www.etnedal.kommune.no/tjenester/kultur-idrett-og-fritd/kultur/om-kulturminne/viktige-kulturminner-og-krigsminnesmerker-i-kommunen/5c-tonsasen-hovedtavle-3/]"
