The site is 32-km drive from Ludhiana City and the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) has acquired 161.27 acres of land in Halwara for the building of a Ludhiana international civil terminal. The airport is being built to accommodate Boeing 737-700 and Airbus A320 aircraft. The upcoming airport is likely to accelerate the growth of businesses in Ludhiana.
