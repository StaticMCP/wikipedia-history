The Swedes occupied the island until the Second Treaty of Brömesbro the same year, where it was handed back to Denmark.\nBackground\nby Jonas Haas depicting Hammershus in1730]]\nWhen the Torstenson War broke out between Denmark and Sweden in 1643, Holger Rosenkrans held the position of commander over Bornholm. He had previously urged the Danish government to send experienced troops to reinforce the island's garrison, as he did not trust the militia on the island. However, these requests went unanswered. When Rosenkrans arrived to Bornholm, the fortress Hammershus was in terrible condition.\nAlong the shore of Bornholm, there were several artillery batteries and redoubts that had performed well under the previous command of Schweder Kettingk, and there was plenty of gunpowder, cannon balls, and guns available. Additionally, there was no shortage of soldiers to man the aformentioned redoubts. Estimates for how many men Bornholm's militia could muster is contested, with an indictment against the commander and officers on Bornholm claiming that 4,000 could be mustered. However, according to Marius Kofoed Zahrtmann, Bornholm had a population of some 12,700 people in 1645 and the militia consisted of around 3,000 men, with 2,400 being capable for combat.\nWhen the war broke out, Rosenkrans ordered that the shore be defended day and night, and that the guards be properly supervised, which was carried out. Furthermore, the officers agreed that in the event of an emegency, each parish on the island would send a detachment of mounted farmers to the shore.\nConquest\nOn the night between 8 and 9 June, a Swedish fleet of 29 ships under the command of Carl Gustaf Wrangel arrived off the coast of Bornholm. On 9 June, the fleet was spotted by a shore guard near Rønne and gradually more guards saw it as it continued towards Dueodde. The town captain of Rønne, Peder Hansen Kofoed, sent a watchmaster to see what type of fleet it was. However, what happened before the watchmaster's return is unknown and no distress message was sent to Nexø and eastern Bornholm regarding the fleet.\nIn Nexø, nobody suspected any danger. However, areound seven and eight o'clock, the Swedish fleet was spotted rounding the headland called \"Broders Ref\". The fleet sailed closer to Nexø as it prepared for a landing. Boats were quickly filled with soldiers, and it appeared as if the Swedes would land south of the town, where a redoubt was located. Many residents of Nexø gathered there, armed, and the mayor of Aakirkeby Christen Gregersen arrived with as many men as he could gather.  Additionally, Sivert Gagge came from Aaker, bringing ten men with him, and a portion of the Paulsker Parish militia had shown up. though the number of men already gathered was probably not very large.\nJost Nicolai, from Ibsker Parish, also rushed to Nexø and 10 or 20 men from the same parish arrived aswell, but remained at the northside of the town and did not go to the redoubt. The people manning the redoubt began firing at the boats that appeared to be landing troops, though this turned out to be a bluff, the boats were instead sailing past the town entirely northwards. As the Swedes sailed northwards, the men from Aakirkeby thought a landing might take place in a bay in the north, and suggested it would be best to move the troops there. However, this plan was rejected by Sivert Gagge. Nevertheless, Gregersen set off to gather intelligence along with the residents of Nexø who also disagreed with Gagge.\nAftermath\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*"
