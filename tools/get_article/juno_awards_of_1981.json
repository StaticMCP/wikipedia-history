The first co-hosts were Andrea Martin and John Candy of SCTV fame, then Frank Mills and Ginette Reno, and finally Ronnie Hawkins and Carroll Baker.\nCeremonies were broadcast nationally on CBC Television from 7pm Eastern Time. More capacity was now available at the O'Keefe Centre and tickets were made available to the public at $15 each.  The television show was seen by an estimated 1,880,000 viewers .\nJuno awards organiser CARAS announced the major nominees 6 January 1981, with additional nominees in classical, jazz and album graphics announced 20 January 1981.\nThe Emeralds, previously nominated four times for the Country Group award, were not nominated this year. Controversy ensued when a committee declared to CARAS that the band was a polka band that should not be nominated in a country category. A reported attempt to file their nomination in a folk category was rejected due to a relative lack of sales. The Emeralds then looked to the courts to stop CARAS from issuing ballots that omitted their group. The group's legal challenge was unsuccessful, but the settlement required the Juno awards to mention the band and its previous nominations during the broadcast.\nPerformers during the broadcast included Frank Mills on piano with Ginette Reno singing \"The Poet and I\", Ronnie Hawkins and Carrol Baker singing \"Hey, Bo Diddley\", Graham Shaw singing his hit \"Can I Come Near\", and single songs each from Diane Tell, Shari Ulrich and the Powder Blues Band.\nAlthough she received four awards, Anne Murray was once again absent from this year's show. Joni Mitchell's entry into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame was introduced by then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. During her acceptance speech, Mitchell quipped that she felt like hockey star Bernie \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion for receiving this honour.\nThe \"Single of the Year\" award was a tie between Anne Murray and Martha and the Muffins, and is the only time a tie for this award has occurred in the history of the Juno's.\nNominees and winners\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n* Carroll Baker\n* Claudja Barry\n* Susan Jacks\n* Joni Mitchell\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Bruce Cockburn\nOther nominees:\n* Burton Cummings\n* Gordon Lightfoot\n* Gino Vannelli\n* Neil Young\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Carole Pope\nOther nominees:\n* Dianne Heatherington\n* Michaele Jordana\n* Shari Ulrich\n* Laura Vinson\nMost Promising Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Graham Shaw\nOther nominees:\n*Bryan Adams\n*Long John Baldry\n*B.
