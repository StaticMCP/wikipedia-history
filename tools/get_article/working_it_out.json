The series was created and executive produced by Bill Persky.\nSynopsis\nWorking It Out is the story of two single parents, Sarah Marshall (Jane Curtin) and David Stuart (Stephen Collins), who had never seriously contemplated remarriage until they met each other.  Given their past histories, both had considerable trepidation, and this was reinforced by their friends' attitudes.\nWorking It Out did not fare well in the Nielsen ratings and was cancelled in December 1990.\nCast\n* Jane Curtin as Sarah Marshall\n* Stephen Collins as David Stuart\n* David Garrison as Stan\n* Mary Beth Hurt as Andy\n* Kyndra Joy Casper as Molly Marshall\n* Chevi Colton as Sophie\nEpisodes\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       =\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
