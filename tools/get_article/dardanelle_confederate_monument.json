      "text": "# Dardanelle Confederate Monument\n\nThe Dardanelle Confederate Monument is located near the Yell County Courthouse on Union Street in Dardanelle, Arkansas, United States. Erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in 1921, the monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as part of the Civil War Commemorative Sculpture Multiple Property Submission.\nThe UDC raised $1,760 ($}} today) to construct the monument between two banks in downtown Dardanelle. Following the completion of a new bridge over the Arkansas River in 1930, the UDC suggested it be moved so that \"all who\ncrossed the bridge would find themselves face to face with the image in marble of the greatest soldier in the world - the Confederate soldier.\" The monument was moved to the southeast corner of the courthouse grounds, where it has remained ever since. The monument formerly contained plumbing allowing it to operate as a fountain which has since been removed.\nAn inscription reads: \"To the Confederate soldiers of Yell County, in appreciation of their splendid valor and loyalty, this monument is erected\".\nSee also\n* 1921 in art\n* List of Confederate monuments and memorials\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Yell County, Arkansas\nReferences"
