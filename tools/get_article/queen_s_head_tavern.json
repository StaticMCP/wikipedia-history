It was already established in 1682 when it is mentioned in the diary of Narcissus Luttrell: \"The 2nd, in the morning early, a fire broke out in the back part of the Queen's Head Tavern, by Temple Bar\".\nPerhaps its most notable clientele were the members of a masonic music club that met there between 1725 and 1727, known as Philo-musicae et  societas Apollini; their musical director was the Italian composer and violinist Francesco Geminiani.\nThe club's minute-book, now in the British Library, reveals that during its residency at the tavern, the landlord Thomas Oliverson (d.1731) agreed to change the name of the tavern to Apollo, and a new tavern sign was painted by James Parmentier, a member of the club.\nThe area of the tavern can be seen on John Rocque's Map of London, 1746, however the name of the tavern seems to have disappeared from the record by the end of the eighteenth century.\nThe site of the tavern and the southern end of Apollo Court was cleared in the nineteenth century to make way for a branch of the Bank of England to serve the newly built Law Courts. The bank building later became a pub, The Old Bank of England. Present-day maps show that the northern end of Apollo Court is still evident on the ground and still accessible from Bell Yard.\nReferences"
