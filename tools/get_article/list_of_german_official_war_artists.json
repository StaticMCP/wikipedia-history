Meanwhile, military service and wartime experiences can significantly influence an artist's body of work. Artists like Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Dix and Max Beckmann, who served in World War I, saw their art profoundly affected by their frontline experiences, reflecting the harsh realities and emotional impacts of conflict in their subsequent works.\nFirst World War\nThe German military supported soldier-artists during this conflict.\n*Luitpold Adam\n*Albert Reich\nSecond World War\nAfter 1939, Luitpold Adam was the head of the German military's Division of Visual Arts, which would expand  to include 80 soldier-artists.\n* Luitpold Adam\n* Herbert Agricola\n* Heinrich Amersdorffer\n* Elk Eber\n* Fritz Erler\n* Franz Eichhorst\n* Rudolf Hergstenberg\n* Conrad Hommel\n* Alfred Hierl\n* Ernst Krause\n* Emile Scheibe\nSee also\n* War artist\n* Military art\n* War photography\nNotes\nReferences\n* McCloskey, Barbara.
