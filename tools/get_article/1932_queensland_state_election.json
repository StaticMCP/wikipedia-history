Labor had previously held office from 1915 until 1929.\nThe election resulted in the defeat of the one-term Moore government by the Labor Party, led by William Forgan Smith.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The election took place on modified boundaries — the Assembly had been reduced by the Electoral Districts Act 1931 from 72 to 62 seats, mainly accomplished by the abolition of sitting Labor members' seats. Despite this, Labor went from a deficit of 16 seats to a surplus of 5 seats.\n| house        = Legislative Assembly\n| series       = Queensland state election\n| back         = 1929\n| forward      = 1935\n| enrolled     = 492,036\n| total_votes  = 456,706\n| turnout %    = 92.82%\n| turnout chg  = +3.67%\n| informal     = 5,144\n| informal %   = 1.13%\n| informal chg = –0.43%\n}}\n|}\n|49.89}}\n|2.86}}\n}}\n|53.22}}\n|1.61}}\n}}\n: 525,944 electors were enrolled to vote at the election, but 5 seats (8.1% of the total) were uncontested—4 Labor seats (two more than in 1929) representing 27,083 enrolled voters and one Independent seat (held by Arnold Wienholt) representing 6,825 enrolled voters.\nSeats changing party representation\nThere was an extensive redistribution across Queensland prior to this election, decreasing the amount of seats from 72 to 62.
