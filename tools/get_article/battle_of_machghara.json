In it, an army led by a Hungarian nobleman was ambushed and defeated in Machghara.\nBackground\nShortly after the failed siege of Mount Tabor, a handful of adventurous crusaders, mainly Hungarians, decided to launch a raid against the castle of Beaufort. The Hungarian leader, a certain rich nobleman named Dionysus, led a force of 500 cavalry. Arab sources claim that they were led by the Nephew of the Hungarian king, Andrew.\nBattle\nThe Balian of Sidon tried to warn the Hungarians of the difficulties in the mountainous region, inhabited by mountaineers who harassed the Crusader territory of Sidon but paid no attention to it. The Hungarians set out and arrived in Machghara, located between the mountains, whose seat is approximately halfway between Sidon and Damascus. The inhabitants learned of the upcoming raid and evacuated the town. The Hungarians rested there for three days. On December 15, the Muslims attacked the Hungarians, who were taken by surprise, killing and capturing a large number of men and horses. Their leader fell prisoner.\nThose who escaped the massacre retreated towards Sidon. During the battle, the Hungarians captured a Muslim prisoner called al-Jamus, and he guided them to a safe route in exchange for his freedom, to which they agreed. However, the Crusaders entered a deep ravine, where they were chased by Muslims and slaughtered. The Hungarians executed the Muslim prisoner for his treachery. Few of the Crusaders survived the massacre. According to Abu Shama, only 3 out of 500 Crusaders survived and reached Sidon. The prisoners were then taken to Damascus.\nThe battle marked the end of the Hungarian Crusade. King Andrew began preparations to return home.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
