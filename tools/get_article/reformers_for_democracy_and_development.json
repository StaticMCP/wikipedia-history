The movement became independent from the party on 19 September 2014.\nThe foundation of the movement was announced on 21 October 2014 at an event held at the Benaki Museum. On 29 November 2014, the first nationwide congregation of the movement was held in the auditorium of the radio station \"Athens 9.84\" in Technopolis of Athens and welcomed, among others, Greek personages such as John Ragkousis, Pantelis Kapsis, Vassilis Oikonomou and Nikos Mouzelis. A Panhellenic Council was also elected on the day.\nReferences"
