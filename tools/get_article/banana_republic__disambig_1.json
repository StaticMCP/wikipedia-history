It was founded in 1978 by Mel and Patricia Ziegler, who originally called the company \"Banana Republic Travel & Safari Clothing Company\". In 1983, Gap purchased the company, changed the name to \"Banana Republic\", and rebranded the stores to achieve a more upscale image. In the 2020s, VP of design Nicole Wiesmann has re-envisioned the brand with ad editorial campaigns that evoke luxury brands, and higher-end garments that have been compared favorably with names such as Ralph Lauren and The Row.\nHistory\nThe original Banana Republic was founded by Mel and Patricia Ziegler in 1978. The couple worked for the San Francisco Chronicle; Mel was a reporter and Patricia  an illustrator. They lived in an apartment on Russian Hill. In 1978, they quit their jobs and moved to Tamalpais Valley. Soon after, Mel received a magazine assignment to explore Australia for a few weeks with other journalists. In Australia, Mel bought a war surplus British Burma jacket. Then they bought 500 Spanish Civil War Army paratrooper shirts for $1.50 each, selling them at a Sunday flea market in Marin City, California.\nThe couple was known for acquiring interesting clothing items that their travel-related jobs brought them in contact with, and they eventually opened a store in Mill Valley. They were known for a hand-drawn catalogue of items with traveler/explorer stories printed alongside, and their safari-themed retail locations. The Zieglers recount their adventures in the first ten years in their memoir, Wild Company, published in 2012 by Simon and Schuster.\nGap Inc. acquired Banana Republic in 1983. By 1988 the founders, Mel and Patricia Ziegler, lost creative control, eventually rebranding it as masstige, an accessible mass luxury clothing retailer. The literate articles, hand-drawn catalog, and eccentric tourist-oriented items were phased out and were replaced with more luxurious, but not unique, items for which the brand would eventually become known, currently replacing higher quality materials for mass quality lower cost fabric standards.\nRetail history\n]]\nIn 2015 Banana Republic opened a new flagship in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street.\nBanana Republic opened its first store outside North America in 2005 in Tokyo's Ginza shopping district.
