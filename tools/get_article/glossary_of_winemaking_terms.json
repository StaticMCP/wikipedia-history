A proper balance of acidity must be struck with the other elements of a wine, or else the wine may be said to be too sharp – having disproportionately high levels of acidity – or too flat – having disproportionately low levels of acidity. The three main acids found in wine are tartaric acid, malic acid and lactic acid. The first two come from the grapes and the third from Malolactic fermentation which often occurs in the winemaking process.\n;Active acidity\n:The concentration of acids in the wine. Used to gauge the \"total acidity\" in the wine. Measured using the pH scale.\n; Actual alcohol\n:The amount of ethanol present in wine, usually measured as a percent of total volume (ABV) taken at 20°C\n;Aerobic conditions\n:Winemaking conditions that promote exposure to oxygen, such wine barrels kept partially full in order to oxidatively age the wine\n;Aging barrel\n: A barrel, often made of oak, used to age wine or distilled spirits.\n;Alcohol\n: Generally refers to ethanol, a chemical compound found in alcoholic beverages. It is also commonly used to refer to alcoholic beverages in general.\n; Alcoholic fermentation\n: The conversion by yeast of sugar into alcohol compounds\n;Aldehyde\n: A component of wine that is formed during the oxidation of alcohol.

While a small amount stays presence in the wine as carbonic acid, most of the gas will rise to the surface of the fermentation vessel and attempt to escape into the air. If the fermentation vessel is closed (such as a sealed wine bottle used to make sparkling wine), the gas will dissolve into the wine and when released will make the wine sparkling.\n;Carbonic maceration: A winemaking practice of fermenting whole grapes that have not been crushed.

In viticultural terms, \"Crush\" is used as a synonym for harvest time.\n;Cryoextraction: A mechanical means of concentrating the grape must (and such increasing sugar concentration) by chilling the must until its water content freezes into ice crystals that are then removed. This production method is used to make so called \"ice box wines\" in a style similar to ice wines which are produced by the grapes naturally freezing on the vine before harvest\n;Cut: A blending term used to refer to either blending a wine with one distinct characteristic (such as high acidity) into a wine that currently dominated by the opposite characteristic (such as low acidity). It can also mean blending a red wine with a white wine in order to make a rosé. Cutting may also refer to the illegal practice of diluting a wine with water.

This technique may enhance some of the varietal characteristics of the wine and leech important phenolic compounds out from the skin. This process can be done either cold (also known as a \"cold soak\") or at warmer temperatures.\n;Proof\n: Refers to the alcohol content of a beverage. In the United States, proof represents twice the alcohol content as a percentage of volume. Thus, a 100 proof beverage is 50% alcohol by volume and a 150 proof beverage is 75% alcohol. In the Imperial system, proof, (or 100% proof), equals 57.06% ethanol by volume, or 48.24% by weight. Absolute or pure ethanol is 75.25 over proof, or 175.25 proof.\n;Protein haze\n: A condition in wines with an excessive amount of protein particles. These particles react with tannins to create a cloudy, hazy appearance in the wine.

It also refers to the practice of topping off a barrel with extra wine to prevent oxidation.\nV\n;Vacuum distillation\n:A means of removing water from grape must at a lower temperature than standard distillation/boiling which could also burn off the delicate flavors and aromas of wine. Within a vacuum, the pressure on the liquid is reduced allowing the must to boil at between  which can cause much less damage to the wine. In winemaking, this technique is sometimes used in vintages where late harvest rains has caused the grapes to swell with water, diluting the flavor and potential alcohol level of the wines.\n;VA lift\n: Winemaking technique where the volatile acidity of a wine is deliberately elevated in order to enhance the fruitiness of wines that are meant to be consumed young.\n;Vanillin\n: An aldehyde found naturally in oak that imparts a vanilla aroma in wine.\n;Varietal\n: A wine made from a single grape variety\n;Véraison\n: French term (now English also) for the onset of ripening of the grape cluster.\n;Viertelstück\n: A German wine barrel with the capacity of\n;Vin de goutte\n: French term for free run juice\n;Vin de liqueur\n:Fortified wine boltered with alcohol prior to fermentation.\n;Vin de paille\n: French for \"straw wine\", a dried grape wine.\n;Vin de rebèche\n:The juice that is still remaining the wine grapes during Champagne wine production after the second pressing has retrieved the taille fraction.
