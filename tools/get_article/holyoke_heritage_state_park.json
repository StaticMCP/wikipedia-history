The park opened in 1986 on the site of the William Skinner Silk Mill which was lost to fire in 1980. The park is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.\nActivities and amenities\nA visitors center has exhibits about paper manufacturing and Holyoke's industrial and cultural past. The landscaped grounds offer picnicking and views of the city's canals and mill buildings. The Holyoke Merry-Go-Round (PTC #80), the Children's Museum at Holyoke, and the Volleyball Hall of Fame are also located in the park.\nThe park also features its own rail line, a remnant of the former Holyoke & Westfield Railroad, and one of four tourist railroads in the Commonwealth. From 1988 to 1996 the railroad featured regular scenic tours to points outside of the city,\nhowever in 2005 the three Pullman cars were sold to the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum, which continues to operate them with the state park's livery. Today the Pioneer Valley Railroad provides annual fall foliage passenger rides from the Holyoke Heritage State Park to Westfield, as well as an annual Santa Train.\nSee also\n* Holyoke Testing Flume\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://www.mass.gov/locations/holyoke-heritage-state-park Holyoke Heritage State Park] Department of Conservation and Recreation\n*[https://www.mass.gov/doc/dcr-holyoke-hsp-visitors-map/download Holyoke Heritage State Park Map] Department of Conservation and Recreation"
