W. Bush, who had alienated a portion of conservatives by breaking his promise in 1988 for \"No New Taxes\" during his administration, defeated insurgent paleoconservative candidate Pat Buchanan. However, his 15.6% margin of victory was unusually narrow for an incumbent president, and foreshadowed his weaknesses amongst the conservative GOP base.\nBush would go on to receive the Republican nomination, winning every state, but lost in the general election to Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton.\nReferences"
