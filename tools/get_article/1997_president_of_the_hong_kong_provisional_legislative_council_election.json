Rita Fan from the pro-Beijing camp defeated President of the colonial Legislative Council Andrew Wong and was elected.\nElection\nThe election of the President through secret ballot was held during the first-ever meeting of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).\nThe PLC was forced to meet in Shenzhen to remain outside the reach of Hong Kong law, as democracy groups called it illegal and threatened to take the PLC to court if its members try to gather in Hong Kong. The meeting was closed to the public, and journalists watched the proceedings on closed-circuit television.\nRita Fan, a key player in committees overseeing the handover with solid connections with women's groups and Beijing, beat the current Legislative Council president, Andrew Wong.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! style=\"width: 50px\" | Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\" | %\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" |Rita Fan\n| align=\"center\" |33\n| align=\"center\" |55\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | Andrew Wong\n| align=\"center\" | 27\n| align=\"center\" | 45\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\"|Turnout\n| align=\"center\" | 60\n| align=\"center\" | 100\n|}\nReaction\nChris Patten, Governor of Hong Kong, blasted the gathering as \"a bad day for Hong Kong\", and criticised the PLC for having \"no legitimacy, no credibility and no authority in Hong Kong.\" Earlier calling the shadow legislature \"a rather exotic debating society that meets on occasional Saturday mornings\", Patten said he hopes \"it will not embarrass Hong Kong too much\".\nCNN described Hong Kong's democratic future \"may have suffered a blow\" following this election. Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong also disapproved the election, with Emily Lau from the Frontier believing Fan might politicise the presidency and \"change the role of the president from speaker to a super leader of the body\" for her strident stance.\nZhou Nan, China's de facto ambassador to Hong Kong, hailed Fan's election and suggested it would be a bad idea for the PLC to hold off until June before starting work on law-making. Zhou also claimed \"now Hong Kong has a chance to create for itself a truly representative form of government.\"\nReferences"
