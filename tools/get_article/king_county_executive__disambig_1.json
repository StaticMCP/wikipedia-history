The office was established with the implementation of the Home Rule Charter for King County on November 5, 1968.[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=1992 HistoryLink Essay: King County voters approve first Home Rule Charter on November 5, 1968] Previously the powers of the county executive were vested in a three-member county commission, which with the implementation of the Home Rule Charter in 1969 ceased to exist. The county executive is elected every four years and the office is nonpartisan.\nThe first county executive was John Spellman, from 1969 to 1981. The current executive is Shannon Braddock, who was appointed as interim executive on April 1, 2025, following the resignation of Dow Constantine to become CEO of Sound Transit.\nElections\nElections for the County Executive have historically taken place in odd-numbered years. However, in 2022, an amendment to the County Charter was passed which would move elections for several county elected offices to even-numbered years. To do so, the 2025 election will be for a three-year term, instead of the normal four years.\nList of executives\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background:#cccccc\"\n!
