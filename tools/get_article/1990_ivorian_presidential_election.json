They were the first multi-candidate presidential election in Ivorian history. Opposition parties were legalized by authoritarian leader Félix Houphouët-Boigny, on 3 May 1990. For the first time, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, president since independence in 1960, faced an opponent in longtime dissident Laurent Gbagbo, who had just returned from exile two years earlier. In an election married by violence and allegations of cheating and ballot stuffing, Houphouët-Boigny was elected to a seventh five-year term, receiving 82% of the vote. Voter turnout was 69%.\nHouphouët-Boigny died on 7 December 1993, three years into his term. In line with the constitution, National Assembly president Henri Konan Bédié served as acting president for the remainder of Houphouët-Boigny's term. Bédié was elected president in his own right in 1995.\nResults\nReferences"
