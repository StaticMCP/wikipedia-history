This battle was narrated and written down by the accredited Yoruba historian, Samuel Johnson in the book The History of the Yorubas.\nBackground\nFollowing the death of the Kakanfo Afonja, the Yorubas united to expel the Fulas from Ilorin. Afonja had been unable to control the Jamaa, and they revolted in early 1824. A massive mob besieged Afonja's compound, and although he fought valiantly, he was eventually killed by arrows and spears. Shehu Alimi then took over as head of Ilorin. The Alaafin of the Oyo Empire, Majotu, made a coalition with the Nupe to expel the Muslims from Ilorin.\nBattle\nToyeje, the Baale of Ogbomoso, became Kankanfo and led the coalition to drive out the foreigners. They encamped at a place called Ogele, where they were met by the Fula forces aided by the Yoruba Muslim chief Solagberu of Oke Suna. A battle was fought in which the Fulas were victorious due to their larger cavalry force. They routed Toyeje's forces and followed up their victory, sacking many towns as they pursued the survivors.\nAftermath\nThe only important towns left in that part were Ofa, Igbomina, Ilemona, Erin and a few others. Refugees fled to walled towns, where they found temporary refuge. Many aged people who could not flee were left behind, and the distress caused by the calamity was severe. Thousands of refugees were forced to move south. The defeat seriously weakened Oyo's prestige, and pushed many provincial governors to start looking more to their personal interests than the interests of the empire as a whole.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
