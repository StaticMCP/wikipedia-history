It was their fourth consecutive single to top the German Singles Chart, after \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", \"You Can Win If You Want\" and \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\".\nBackground\n\"Brother Louie\" was released on 27 January 1986 and it reached  1 on 3 March 1986 in Germany. The single spent four weeks at the top and total of 17 weeks on the German chart. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at No. 4 in the charts and went silver for shipments in excess of 250,000 units. \"Brother Louie\" was also certified silver in France for selling over 250,000 units.\nIt is believed that the song was written by Dieter Bohlen about producer Luis Rodríguez, as he was a close associate of Bohlen and worked on many of the Modern Talking songs.\nIn 1998, not long after the duo's reunion, a remixed version of the single was released, titled \"Brother Louie '98\". The single, released in a new sleeve, was also successful. It went gold in France for selling over 250,000 units.\nMusic video\nThe music video of \"Brother Louie\" was directed by Pit Weyrich and contains footage from the 1984 film Once Upon a Time in America, interspersed with the band members playing on a stage surrounded by dancing fans.\nTrack listing\n* German 12\" maxi single\n# \"Brother Louie\" (Special Long Version) – 5:20\n# \"Brother Louie\" (Instrumental) – 4:06\n*German 7\" single\n# \"Brother Louie\" – 3:41\n# \"Brother Louie\" (Instrumental) – 4:06\n* UK 12\" maxi single\n# \"Brother Louie\" (Special Long Version) – 5:15\n# \"Doctor for My Heart\" – 3:16\n# \"Brother Louie\" (Instrumental) – 4:06\n* UK 7\" single\n# \"Brother Louie\" – 3:41\n# \"Brother Louie\" (Instrumental) – 4:06\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 1986 weekly chart performance for \"Brother Louie\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1986)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (IFPI)\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe (European Hot 100 Singles)\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Finland (Suomen virallinen lista)\n| 1\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece (IFPI)\n| 1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Quebec (ADISQ)\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Spain (AFYVE)\n| 1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ 2022 weekly chart performance for \"Brother Louie\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for \"Brother Louie\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1986)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40)\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n| 28\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe (European Hot 100 Singles)\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)\n| 25\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (OCC)\n| 56\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| West Germany (Media Control)\n| 14\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 1985-1989 chart performance for \"Brother Louie\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1985–1989)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe (European Hot 100 Singles)\n|92\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\n\"Brother Louie '98\"\n}}\n}}\n\"'''Brother Louie '98'''\" is the re-packaged version of the original 1986 version of \"Brother Louie\", released as the second single from Modern Talking's seventh studio album, Back for Good (1998), and also the second single following the duo's reunion. \"Brother Louie '98\".
