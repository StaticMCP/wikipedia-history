China has deployed forces in more than a dozen UN peacekeeping missions, and has committed over 3,000 personnel to UN peacekeeping operations.\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) established specialized forces for military operations other than war. Current planning anticipates five specialized groups, including (a) flood and disaster relief forces, (b) post-earthquake emergency rescue forces, (c) emergency rescue forces for nuclear, chemical and biological disasters, (d) emergency relief force for transportation facilities and (e) international peacekeeping force.\nMOOTW have been a subject of study at the National Defense University (NDU), which became a venue for examining the practical experience of equipment utilization and support. The characteristics, rules, contents and methods of equipment utilization and support in MOOTW were evaluated.\nSelect Chinese deployments\n* UNFIL\n* Mali war\n* Somali pirates, 2009: Naval escort missions in waters off Somalia.\nSee also\n* Pax Sinica''\n* Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\n* China and the United Nations\n* Chinese foreign aid\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n* Hellström, Jerker.
