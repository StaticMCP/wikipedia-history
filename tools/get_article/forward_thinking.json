Forward Thinking works to engage with those who are perceived as political \"hardliners\", in the belief that if these communities are not engaged, they will have little incentive to see peace succeed and may become spoilers to the process.\nWomen for a Sustainable Future (WSF)\nThe Women for a Sustainable Future network provides an independent space for women parliamentarians, experts, and diplomats across the Gulf-MENA region to meet with their European counterparts. This space enables the network to address the human, environmental, economic, and social challenges that pose a threat to a global sustainable future.\nThe UK Programme\nIn the UK, Forward Thinking works to promote a greater understanding of the diverse Muslim communities and organisations, and the positive contribution they make to British society at a political and social level.\nStaff\nForward Thinking's co-founder and director is Oliver McTernan.
