It is about 115&nbsp;km by road south-west of Melbourne and 40&nbsp;km east of Geelong.\nThe township of St Leonards lies at its northern end.  With Duck Island and Swan Island it forms the part-barrier that separates Swan Bay from Port Phillip.\nEdwards Point Wildlife Reserve\nThe spit is entirely included within the Edwards Point Wildlife Reserve, established in March 1971 to protect the vegetation communities and fauna of the area. These communities include the last remaining stand of coastal woodland on the Bellarine Peninsula, saltmarsh and beach.  The adjacent Swan Bay contains extensive areas of intertidal mudflats that are important for waterbirds and migratory waders.  The end of the spit is a high tide roost for waders.\nThe spit is part of the Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International.  Birds of conservation significance for which the area is known include the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot as well as the little tern, fairy tern, eastern curlew, Lewin's rail and white-bellied sea-eagle. It has also supported over 1% of the Australian population of four wader species: grey plover, Pacific golden plover, double-banded plover and eastern curlew.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061124162558/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~sbea/ Swan Bay Environment Association]"
