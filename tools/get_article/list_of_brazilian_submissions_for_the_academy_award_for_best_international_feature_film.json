      "text": "# List of Brazilian submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film\n\nBrazil has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film}} since 1960. The award is handed out annually by the United States–based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature length motion picture produced outside the U.S. that contains primarily non-English language dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, Brazil has been nominated five times, winning once for ''I'm Still Here (2024) by Walter Salles.\nAt the 1959 ceremony, Black Orpheus'', a Portuguese language film shot in Rio de Janeiro with a large Brazilian cast and crew, won the award representing France. Since the film was directed by French filmmaker Marcel Camus and produced by French companies, the film was able to be nominated as France's official submission.\nIn 1986, Kiss of the Spider Woman by Héctor Babenco became the first Brazilian co-production to get nominated for Best Picture. However, it was ineligible to be selected as the official submission because it was mostly in English.\nStatistics\nSeven films directed by Carlos Diegues (also known as Cacá Diegues) have been chosen to represent Brazil at the Oscars, more than any other filmmaker. Followed by Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Walter Salles, with four each.\nThree films by Bruno Barreto were submitted, although his biggest success, Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands, was not chosen. His 1997 drama film Four Days in September was nominated at the 70th Academy Awards.\nThree films by Kleber Mendonça Filho were submitted, even though his biggest success to date were famously snubbed (Aquarius and Bacurau).\nSuzana Amaral's Hour of the Star (1987) was the first film directed by a woman to be submitted. Only twenty-nine years later another film directed by a female filmmaker was selected as the Brazilian's entry: Anna Muylaert'''s The Second Mother (2015). Four years later, Babenco: Tell Me When I Die (2019), by Bárbara Paz became the third and last, as of 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px #555 solid; text-align:center\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"1\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!

It marked the first time that a Brazilian actor was nominated for an acting category.\nAt the 75th Academy Awards, even though City of God was selected as the Brazilian submission, the film was famously snubbed and the decision was met with heavy criticism, since it was considered the category's front-runner. In the subsequent year, at the 76th Academy Awards, the film was nominated in four categories: Best Director for Fernando Meirelles, Best Adapted Screenplay for Bráulio Mantovani, Best Cinematography for César Charlone, and Best Film Editing for Daniel Rezende.\nAt the 97th Academy Awards, Brazil won the award for the first time with ''I'm Still Here,  while the film was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress (for Fernanda Torres), marking the first time that a Brazilian film, shot in Portuguese, was nominated for Best Picture.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by the Brazilian government for Academy Award consideration. The Brazilian nominee is selected annually by a committee assembled by the Brazilian Academy of Cinema.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n!
