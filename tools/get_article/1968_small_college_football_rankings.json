Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nNorth Dakota State (10–0) and San Diego State were ranked as the top two teams: North Dakota State No. 1 by the AP and No. 2 by the UPI; and San Diego State No. 1 by the UPI and No. 2 by the AP. Chattanooga (9–1) and New Mexico Highlands (9–0) were ranked third and fourth, respectively, in both polls.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px;
