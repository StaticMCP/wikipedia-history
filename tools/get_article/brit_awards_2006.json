It was organised by the British Phonographic Industry and took place on February 14, 2006 in Earls Court in London.\nThe ceremony was hosted by Chris Evans, who also hosted Brit Awards 2005. It lasted about three hours, and the alcohol ban of the previous year had been relaxed. The biggest surprise performance was that from Prince, who reunited with Wendy and Lisa from The Revolution, together with Sheila E. for the performance.\n2006's biggest winners were the Kaiser Chiefs, who came away with three awards. Coldplay, James Blunt and Green Day all came away with two awards, Coldplay collecting their sixth overall. Other winners included the Arctic Monkeys for their only nomination, and acts such as KT Tunstall and Kanye West. Arcade Fire were the most unsuccessful act, being nominated for three awards but winning none of them.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n|Coldplay\n|\"Square One\"\n|-\n|KT Tunstall\n|\"Suddenly I See\"\n|-\n|Kaiser Chiefs\n|\"I Predict a Riot\"\n|-\n|James Blunt\n|\"You're Beautiful\"\n|-\n|Kanye West\n|\"Diamonds From Sierra Leone\"\"Gold Digger\"\"Touch the Sky\"\n|-\n|Kelly Clarkson\n|\"Since U Been Gone\"\n|-\n|Gorillaz\n|\"Dirty Harry\"\n|-\n|Jack Johnson\n|\"Better Together\"\n|-\n|Paul Weller\n|\"Come On/Let's Go\"\"The Changingman\"\"From the Floorboards Up\"\"Town Called Malice\"\n|-\n|Prince\n|\"Te Amo Corazón\"\"Fury\"\"Purple Rain\"\"Let's Go Crazy\"\n|-\n|}\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"50%\" | British Album of the Year(presented by Madonna)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Single of the Year(presented by Morten Harket)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Coldplay – X&Y'\n**Gorillaz – Demon Days\n**James Blunt – Back to Bedlam\n**Kaiser Chiefs – Employment\n**Kate Bush – Aerial\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Coldplay – \"Speed of Sound\"\n**James Blunt – \"You're Beautiful\"\n**Shayne Ward – \"That's My Goal\"\n**Sugababes – \"Push the Button\"\n**Tony Christie (featuring Peter Kay) –\"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo\"\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Male Solo Artist(presented by Wayne Coyne)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Female Solo Artist(presented by Jo Whiley)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*James Blunt\n**Antony and the Johnsons\n**Ian Brown\n**Robbie Williams\n**Will Young\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*KT Tunstall\n**Charlotte Church\n**Kate Bush\n**Katie Melua\n**Natasha Bedingfield\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Group(presented by Debbie Harry)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Breakthrough Act(presented by Chris O'Dowd)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Kaiser Chiefs\n**Coldplay\n**Franz Ferdinand\n**Gorillaz\n**Hard-Fi\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Arctic Monkeys\n**James Blunt\n**Kaiser Chiefs\n**KT Tunstall\n**The Magic Numbers\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Pop Act(presented by Harry Hill)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Urban Act(presented by Jamelia)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*James Blunt\n**Katie Melua\n**Kelly Clarkson (United States)\n**Madonna (United States)\n**Westlife (Ireland)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Lemar\n**Craig David\n**Dizzee Rascal\n**Ms. Dynamite\n**Kano\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Rock Act(presented by Tamsin Greig)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Live Act(presented by Thandie Newton)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Kaiser Chiefs\n**Franz Ferdinand\n**Hard-Fi\n**Kasabian\n**Oasis\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Kaiser Chiefs\n**Coldplay\n**Franz Ferdinand\n**KT Tunstall\n**Oasis\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | Outstanding Contribution to Music(presented by Ray Winstone)\n! width=\"50%\" | International Album(presented by Paris Hilton)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Paul Weller\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Green Day – American Idiot'\n**Arcade Fire – Funeral\n**Kanye West – Late Registration\n**Madonna – Confessions on a Dance Floor\n**U2 – How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | International Male Solo Artist(presented by Boy George)\n! width=\"50%\" | International Female Solo Artist(presented by Neil Tennant)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Kanye West\n**Beck\n**Bruce Springsteen\n**Jack Johnson\n**John Legend\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Madonna\n**Björk\n**Kelly Clarkson\n**Mariah Carey\n**Missy Elliott\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | International Group(presented by Kelly Osbourne)\n! width=\"50%\" | International Breakthrough Act(presented by Beth Orton)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Green Day\n**Arcade Fire\n**The Black Eyed Peas\n**U2\n**The White Stripes\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Jack Johnson\n**Arcade Fire\n**Daniel Powter\n**John Legend\n**The Pussycat Dolls\n|}\nMultiple nominations and awards\nas most nominations and awards]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Artists that received multiple nominations\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" |Nominations\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Artist\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|5(2)\n|James Blunt\n|-\n|Kaiser Chiefs\n|-\n|4\n|Coldplay\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|3(4)\n|Arcade Fire\n|-\n|Franz Ferdinand\n|-\n|KT Tunstall\n|-\n|Madonna\n|-\n|rowspan=\"11\"|2(11)\n|Gorillaz\n|-\n|Green Day\n|-\n|Hard-Fi\n|-\n|Jack Johnson\n|-\n|John Legend\n|-\n|Kanye West\n|-\n|Kate Bush\n|-\n|Katie Melua\n|-\n|Kelly Clarkson\n|-\n|Oasis\n|-\n|U2\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Artists that received multiple awards\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" |Awards\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Artist\n|-\n|3\n|Kaiser Chiefs\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2(3)\n|Coldplay\n|-\n|Green Day\n|-\n|James Blunt\n|}\nControversy\n*Some of the more famous British pop acts failed to get a nomination. Bands like Girls Aloud and McFly both had top 10 hits in both the single and album charts but neither were nominated, and Oasis who were eligible, but were snubbed in the category of Best Album, only had 2 nominations.\nSee also\n*Naomi Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121021165604/http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2006 Brit Awards 2006 at Brits.co.uk]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130520182700/http://www.nme.com/news/kaiser-chiefs/21923 NME report on Brits nominations]"
