It was fought from January &ndash; February 1940, as part of the Chinese 1939 Winter Offensive.\nThe Japanese had tanks, armoured cars, tear gas and air supremacy with fighter bombers while the Chinese warlord armies involved had no airforce or equivalent armour.\nBattle\nIn 1937 the Chinese government picked up intelligence that the Japanese planned a puppet Hui Muslim country around Suiyuan and Ningxia, and had sent agents to the region.\nThe Middlesboro Daily News'' ran an article by Owen Lattimore which reported on Japan's planned offensive into the Muslim region in 1938, which predicted that the Japanese would suffer a massive crushing defeat at the hands of the Muslims.\nThe Japanese  planned to invade Ningxia from Suiyuan in 1939 and create a Hui Muslim puppet state. The following year in 1940, the Japanese were defeated militarily by the Kuomintang Muslim General Ma Hongbin, who caused the plan to collapse. Ma Hongbin's Hui Muslim troops launched further attacks against Japan in the Battle of West Suiyuan.\nIn Suiyuan 300 Mongol collaborators serving the Japanese were fought off by a single Muslim who held the rank of Major at the Battle of Wulan Obo in 1939 April.\nMuslim Generals Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin defended west Suiyuan, particularly Wuyuan in 1940 against the Japanese. Ma Hongbin commanded the 81st corps and sustained heavy casualties, but eventually repulsed the Japanese and defeated them.\nJapan used poison gas against Chinese Muslim armies at the Battle of Wuyuan and Battle of West Suiyuan.\nReferences"
