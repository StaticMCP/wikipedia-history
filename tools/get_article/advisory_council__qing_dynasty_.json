It was part of the New Policies in the late Qing dynasty, of which the Qing court was moving toward the implementation of a constitution. In September 1907, the Guangxu Emperor promulgated a decree on the setting up of the Advisory Council, following by the provincial Consultative Bureaus in October.\nThe Advisory Council was established on 6 November 1906, and formally opened on 10 October 1910, after the first parliamentary election in last October. The council was dissolved on 12 February 1912 along with the end of the Qing dynasty, and was replaced by the Provisional Senate of the Republic of China.\nHistory\nAfter the Boxer Protocol was signed in 1901, the Qing court returned to its capital of Beijing eager to reform the realm's governance. In around August 1906, the Guangxu Emperor declared the start of preparative constitutionalism after the study by the Constitutionalism Commission on foreign politics. Two months later, Yikuang, Prince Qing, recommended forming an Advisory Council to prepare for the institution of a parliament. On 6 November 1906, the Emperor issued an edict to revamp the governmental institutions, including the establishment of Advisory Council.\nOn 20 September 1907, the Emperor appointed Pulun and Sun Jialun as joint Presidents of the council, and delegated to them the writing of its charter. In August 1908, the electoral system of the Council and the Provincial Assemblies were approved and governors of provinces were asked to hold relevant elections within a year. Half of the Council members were elected by members of the Assemblies, while the other half were appointed by the imperial court.\nThe Council and the Commission further jointly agreed to a nine-year plan for installing constitutionalism. Provincial Assemblies were formed in 1908, with elections of the Assemblies and the Council to be held a year later. The council was to be convened and formally opened in 1910. The constitution of the state, Parliamentary Law, Parliamentary Election Law, and election of the bicameral members were expected in 1916. By then constitutional monarchy would have formally replaced absolute monarchy.\nThe elections of the Council and Provincial Assemblies held as laid down in the plan. The bicameral parliament, however, did not come into existence as Qing dynasty was overthrown and Emperor Puyi forced to abdicate in 1912.\nSession\nThe Council convened for the first time on 3 October 1910, with the President declaring it as \"the unprecedented grand ceremony\" in the Chinese history. All 196 members of the council were divided evenly in 6 divisions, followed by election of division head (股長) and director (理事).\nThe second meeting marked the state opening of the council, attending by the regent and virtually all ministers of the court. Attendants first kowtowed to the throne. The regent then announced the edict and addressed the council. The Council agreed the President and the Vice President to present a humble address to thank His Majesty on behalf of the members. The meeting subsequently ended.\nA total of 42 meetings were held, 9 of which was after the extension of the council's session.\nOn 18 December, the Council presented humble address (palace memorial) to the court over forming cabinet as responsibilities of Grand Council were unclear, which the court denounced as \"interference by councillors\" and insisted the court shall decide on matters of such. On 30 December, the Council presented another address to urge ending the policy of Manchu hairstyle and clothing.\nAccording to the records of proceedings, the council was closed on 11 January 1911 without the attendance of the regent. The edict was announced and the President kowtowed to the throne, marking the end of the first session of the council.\nHowever, the Council continued deliberation. On 25 January 1911, part of the new criminal code was promulgated after adoption by the council. Two days later, the standardised treasury regulation was adopted by the council, along with the 1911 (Xuantong Year 2) budget on the next day. During the Railway Protection protest, the Council passed resolution against government's nationalisation plan, which was in turn rejected.\nThe second session of the Council started on 22 October 1911, days after outbreak of 1911 revolution. The Council recommended sacking of Sheng Xuanhuai as Minister of Mail for \"violating rights, breaking laws, deceiving the Emperor\", and calling him as the one \"damaging the empire the most\", which was agreed by the Emperor. Eight days later, the Council called for replacing the cabinet of Princes and to be completely responsible with non-royals as ministers of state, which was agreed by the court. On 3 November, Nineteen Articles were announced by the court after the Council voiced support for constitutional monarchy. The Charter of the council was amended on 20 November. On 27 October, upon recommendation from the council, the court finally repealed ban on Han hairstyle and costume and replaced lunar calendar with solar calendar.\nOne of the last acts of the council was the election of Yuan Shikai as the Prime Minister. The council was dissolved upon the end of the Qing dynasty.\nPower\nAccording to the Charter of the Council amended on 3 July 1911 –Article 14\nAdvisory Council shall decide on matters of –\n# Financial budgets on income and expenditure of the state;\n# Final accounts on income and expenditure of the state;\n# Taxation and public debt;\n# Legislations and amendments thereof, except constitution; and\n# Other issues upon directives by extraordinary edicts.\nArticle 15\nMotions under subsection 1 to 4 of the aforesaid article shall be drafted and presented by cabinet ministers, and submit to the Council at meetings. Advisory Council, however, can draft and present motions at its initiative for matters under subsection 3 and subsection 4.\nArticle 16\nResolutions on matters particularised in Article 14 by the Advisory Council shall be presented by President or Vice President upon consultation with cabinet ministers for decisions by the Emperor.\nMembers\nSome members resigned during the session and the vacancies were filled according to the precedence list.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of senior officials of the Advisory Council\n!Position\n!Member\n!Portrait\n!Term start\n!Term end\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |President\n|\n|\n|20 September 1907\n|22 March 1911\n|-\n|Sun Jianai\n|\n|20 September 1907\n|30 November 1909\n|-\n|\n|\n|22 March 1911\n|30 October 1911\n|-\n|\n|\n|30 October 1911\n|26 January 1912\n|-\n|\n|\n|26 January 1912\n|12 February 1912\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Vice President\n|Shen Jiaben\n|\n|15 September 1910\n|28 January 1911\n|-\n|\n|\n|22 March 1911\n|30 October 1911\n|-\n|\n|\n|30 October 1911\n|2 February 1912\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Assistant Vice President(協理)\n|\n|\n|20 January 1907\n|December 1909\n|-\n|\n|\n|20 January 1907\n|6 July 1908\n|-\n|\n|\n|20 January 1907\n|1911\n|-\n|\n|\n|20 January 1907\n|1911\n|-\n|\n|\n|23 September 1909\n|14 April 1910\n|-\n|\n|\n|?\n|?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Manager(幫辦)\n|\n|\n|1908\n|1911\n|-\n|\n|\n|1908\n|1911\n|-\n|\n|\n|1908\n|1911\n|-\n|Secretary General\n|\n|\n|?\n|2 February 1912\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+List of members of the Advisory Council\n!\n!MemberPeerage\n!Portrait\n!Constituency\n!Party; ; .
