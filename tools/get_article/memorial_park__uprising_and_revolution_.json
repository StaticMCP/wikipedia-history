The complex was built from 1977 to 1978.\nDescription\nThe central building inside the memorial park is a figural sculptural composition in the form of a moving column, headed by a figure of Sava Kovačević. The composition is made of bronze and is 7 meters high. Its author is the sculptor Miodrag Živković. People's hero Sava Kovačević was born in the nearby village of Nudo, and on July 13, 1941, he led the Grahovo partisans in this attack on the occupying forces and disarmed the enemy column.\nThe broader spatial concept contains sculptural elements, i.e. 272 cubes on which the names of fallen Partisan fighters from that area are inscribed, approaches, plateaus, and staircases made of stone.\nReferences"
