Early crops included oats, maize, potatoes and turnips. Horses and cattle were grazed and timber was cut. The Swedish settlement included O.Trulson, M.Trulson, M.Stjernqvist, M.Swensen, P.Swensen, N.Stjernqvist and P.Abrahamsen. Other early settlers were John and George Hubner who took up farms in 1893. Although the district acquired the unofficial name of Hubner from the Hubner family, when the (then) local government Shire of Beaudesert tried to formalise it in 1987, it was instead decided to name the area Crestmead after a local housing estate.\nThe Crestmead Industrial Estate was opened in May 1983 by Queensland Minister for Commerce, Bill Gunn.\nCrestmead State School opened on 23 January 1984. It was recognised in 2017 with new status as an Independent Public School (IPS).  In 2019 Crestmead State School celebrated its 35th (Coral) Jubilee in September, which attracted a large crowd of past students, staff, supporters and dignitaries. The event was notable for the tribute of naming the school hall in honour of the foundation principal, Gavin Bird.  A history of the school and local area was published to commemorate the event, edited by long-term teacher Jean Murdoch, entitled \"We are Crestmead State School\".\nSt Francis' College opened on 8 February 1988.\nOn 24 December 2012, 80 workers at the Dairy Farmers factory in the Crestmead Industrial Estate staged a protest at the factory to protest pay rates; the protest included blocking access to milk tankers.
