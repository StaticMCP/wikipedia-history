      "text": "# List of erotica by George Morland, William Ward and John Raphael Smith\n\nThe art of erotic illustration in 18th century England was less developed than in France and the Italian states. However, some work of varying quality was produced in England, notably by Thomas Rowlandson. The following is a list of erotic illustrations of scenes from popular novels, designed probably by George Morland, and engraved by his brother-in-law, William Ward, or by John Raphael Smith, which are described by Henry Spencer Ashbee ('Pisanus Fraxi') in Catena Librorum Tacendorum (1885), the third and final volume of his bibliography of curious and uncommon books.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!Image\n!Title\n!Description\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|\n|Fanny Hill and Phœbe.\n|The two girls are on the bed together, their shifts turned up to their waists.

There are very slight differences in the hair of both figures, in the drapery of the woman, in the panels of the room, &c. One plate, however, must have been copied from the other.
