The family moved to Alameda County near Vallejo's Mills, California in 1856. Vallejo's Mills became the town of Niles in 1869 (now a District in Fremont). Much of Charles Shinn's childhood was spent at the ranch and nursery of his family in Niles. His sister, Milicent Shinn, was an American child psychologist. His first cousin Edmund Clark Sanford was a prominent psychologist.\nEducation\nShinn attended the state university for two years, now the University of California, Berkeley. He attended Johns Hopkins University from 1882 to 1884. He received a bachelor's degree conferred \"extra ordinary.\"  While at Johns Hopkins University, his roommate was Woodrow Wilson.\nCareer\nCharles Shinn was a teacher in four counties in California from 1870 to 1876  and at Washington Corners in 1876.\nHe was also a writer. In 1878, while teaching in Shasta County, he began the study of the mining district codes or laws of the 49ers and after.  His most famous book, Mining Camps (1885), was a result of field work there and in the Sierras. The emphasis of the German folk moot tradition espoused while he was at Johns Hopkins influenced his often romanticized writings about the early mining camps. Between 1879 and 1889 he wrote for newspapers and magazines in San Francisco, Baltimore, and New York. In 1879 he worked for the San Francisco Bulletin. From 1878 to 1880 he edited the California Horticulturalist and Floral Magazine. which was published by John H. Carmany. He published the Pacific Rural Handbook in 1879.\nHe was elected to be a director of the State Horticultural Society in 1879. During the late 1880s, he served as managing editor of Overland Monthly while continuing to publish articles on nature, mining, and rustic California.  Charles Howard Shinn was inspector of California Experiment Stations from 1890 to 1902 In the May 8, Nation, 1893, Shinn wrote about the Geary Act and the affect on the Chinese workers and orchard owners in California.\nIn 1892 he was a Charter member of the Sierra Club. In 1900, he and his wife, Julia, were trustees of the Niles Library.\nHe was head forest ranger the Sierra (North) Forest in 1902 for the Department of the Interior. In 1914 he worked for the San Joaquin Valley Counties Association  He retired from his Forest Service position in July 1924.\nMarriage\nCharles Shinn married Julia Charlotte Tyler on July 31, 1888, at the home of her father, Asher Tyler, in Oakland. She shared his interests in nature, worked at his side, and became one of the first women employed by the new U. S. Forest Service.\nDeath\nCharles Shinn spent the last 22 years of his life in North Fork, California. Julia Shinn named their home the \"Peace Cabin\". He retired as supervising forest ranger a year before he passed. He is buried in Ukiah, California.\nMemorial\nCharles Shinn is remembered in the Sierra Club bulletin and in the Journal of Forestry. Coincidentally \"Ranger Shinn; The Story of a Man Who Shaped His Life to Get the Greatest Happiness\" was published in Sunset Magazine in the month that he died.\nMt. Shinn in the Sierra Nevada is named after Charles Howard Shinn. The name became official in1934 Mt. Shinn is 11,013 feet tall, two miles south of the south fork of San Joaquin River, near latitude 37°13' longitude 118° 55'.
