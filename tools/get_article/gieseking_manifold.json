It is non-orientable and has the smallest volume among non-compact hyperbolic manifolds, having volume approximately V \\approx 1.0149416.  It was discovered by .\nThe Gieseking manifold can be constructed by removing the vertices from a tetrahedron, then gluing the faces together in pairs using affine-linear maps.  Label the vertices 0, 1, 2, 3.  Glue the face with vertices 0, 1, 2 to the face with vertices 3, 1, 0 in that order.  Glue the face 0, 2, 3 to the face 3, 2, 1 in that order. In the hyperbolic structure of the Gieseking manifold, this ideal tetrahedron is the canonical polyhedral decomposition of David B. A. Epstein and Robert C. Penner.  Moreover, the angle made by the faces is \\pi/3.  The triangulation has one tetrahedron, two faces, one edge and no vertices, so all the edges of the original tetrahedron are glued together.\nThe Gieseking manifold has a double cover homeomorphic to the figure-eight knot complement.  The underlying compact manifold has a Klein bottle boundary, and the first homology group of the Gieseking manifold is the integers.\nThe Gieseking manifold is a fiber bundle over the circle with fiber the once-punctured torus and monodromy given by (x,y) \\to (x+y,x).\nThe square of this map is Arnold's cat map and this gives another way to see that the Gieseking manifold is double covered by the complement of the figure-eight knot.\nGieseking constant\nThe volume of the Gieseking manifold is called the Gieseking constant and has a numeral value of approximately:\n: V = 1.01494 \\ 16064 \\ 09653 \\ 62502 \\ 12025 \\dots\nIt can be given as in a closed form with the Clausen function \\operatorname{Cl}_2\\left(\\varphi\\right) as:\nV = \\operatorname{Cl}_2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\nThis is similar to Catalan's constant G, which also manifests as a volume and can be expressed in terms of the Clausen function:\nG=\\operatorname{Cl}_2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0.91596559\\dots\nThere is a related expression in terms of a special value of a Dirichlet L-function given by the identity\nV = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot L(2,\\chi_{-3}) = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3k+1)^2} - \\frac{1}{(3k+2)^2}\\right)\nwhereas Catalan's constant is equal to L(2,\\chi_{-4})\nAnother closed form expression may be given in terms of the trigamma function:\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\psi_1(1/3)}{2}-\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}\\right)\nIntegrals for the Gieseking constant are given by\nV =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi/3}\\ln\\left(2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac12x\\right)\\right)\\mathrm dx\nV =2\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1+x)}{\\sqrt{(1-x)(3+x)}}\\mathrm dx\nwhich follow from its definition through the Clausen function and\nV =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}2 \\int_0^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x \\ \\mathrm{d}y \\ \\mathrm dz}{xyz (x+y+z+\\tfrac1x+\\tfrac1y+\\tfrac1z)^2}\nA further expression is:\nV =\\frac{3\\sqrt3}{4}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3k+1)^2}-\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3k+2)^2}\\right)\nThis gives:\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3k+1)^2}=\\frac{2\\pi^2}{27}+\\frac{2\\sqrt3}{9}V\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(3k+2)^2}=\\frac{2\\pi^2}{27}-\\frac{2\\sqrt3}{9}V\nwhich is similar to:\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(4k+1)^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{16}+\\frac{1}{2}G\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(4k+3)^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{16}-\\frac{1}{2}G\nfor Catalan's constant G.\nIn 2024, Frank Calegari, Vesselin Dimitrov, and Yunqing Tang proved that 1, \\pi^2, L(2,\\chi_{-3})  are linearly independent over the rationals. This proves that \\sqrt{3} \\cdot V is irrational as well as the special values \\psi_1(1/6), \\psi_1(1/3), \\psi_1(2/3), \\psi_1(5/6) of the trigamma function. The irrationality of V itself is still open.{{cite arXiv |eprint=2408.15403 |last1=Calegari |first1=Frank |last2=Dimitrov |first2=Vesselin |last3=Tang |first3=Yunqing |title=The linear independence of 1, ζ(2), and L(2,χ{-3}) |date=2024 |class=math.NT }}\nSee also\n* List of mathematical constants\n* Catalan's constant\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
