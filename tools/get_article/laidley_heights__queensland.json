In the , Laidley Heights had a population of 1,429 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the east by Laidley Creek.\nLake Dyer is in the east of the locality (). Although it is a natural lake, its capacity to store water was increased by the construction of the Bill Gunn Dam (), a   earth embankment with a central clay core. As well as the natural inflows to the lake, additional water from Laidley Creek is redirected into Lake Dyer for storage. It is an ungated dam so it commences spilling whenever it is full.\nThe land use is a mix of rural residential housing in the central areas of the locality, irrigated horticulture in the east along the creek, and grazing on native vegetation in the remainder of the locality.\nHistory\nThe locality was named after the town of Laidley, which, in turn, was derived from the naming of Laidleys Plain by Allan Cunningham after James Laidley New South Wales Deputy Commissary General.\nLaidley Golf Club opened on 9 December 1928 with a few holes on the Laidley Showgrounds. Due to the popularity of the golf club, in 1931, the club decided to establish a new golf course on the Laidley Recreational Reserve (now Anzac Park), which opened in April 1932. In 1941, the club suspended activities due to World War II. In 1948, the club decided to restart operations by merging with Forest Hill Golf Club and establish a new golf course.  A  dairy farm overlooking Dyer’s Lagoon (now Lake Dyer) was purchased. Professional golf player Tom Southcombe was engaged to plan the golf course. Although play had already commenced on the nine-hole course, it was not officially opened until Sunday 15 April 1951.\nThe construction of Bill Gunn Dam was completed in 1987. It was named after Bill Gunn, the local member in the Queensland Legislative Assembly and also a former member of the Laidley Shire Council.\nDemographics\nIn the , Laidley Heights had a population of 1,263 people.\nIn the , Laidley Heights had a population of 1,429 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Laidley Heights.

There are facilities for camping, boating, fishing, swimming, and picnics. There is a boat ramp on Whites Road into Lake Dyer (). It is managed by the Lockyer Valley Regional Council.\nLaidley Golf Club is to the north of Lake Dyer (). It has a 12-hole golf course with clubhouse facilities.\nReferences"
