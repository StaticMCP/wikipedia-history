Cone\n\nEdward Toner Cone (May 4, 1917 &ndash; October 23, 2004) was an American composer, music theorist, pianist, and philanthropist.\nLife and career\nCone was born in Greensboro, North Carolina.  He studied composition under Roger Sessions at Princeton University, receiving his bachelor's in 1939 (Latin salutatorian and the first Princeton student to submit a musical composition as his senior thesis). Cone and Milton Babbitt were the first to earn graduate degrees in musical composition from Princeton (MFA, 1942). He studied piano with Karl Ulrich Schnabel and Edward Steuermann.  During the Second World War, Cone served first in the army (as a pianist) and later in the Office of Strategic Services. Beginning in 1946, he taught at Princeton. He was the co-editor of the journal Perspectives of New Music between 1965 and 1969.\nCone, known for his contributions to music criticism and analysis, also composed a significant body of music. His scholarly work addressed musical form and aesthetics, particularly questions of rhythm and musical phrasing. He died in Princeton, New Jersey, aged 87. Cone was the companion of Princeton philosophy professor George Pitcher for nearly 48 years.\nCone's students include Michael Dellaira, Hobart Earle, Alan Fletcher, Robert Greenberg, John Heiss, David Lewin, Gilbert Levine, Mathilde McKinney, Robert P. Morgan, Mario Pelusi, Malcolm Peyton, Harold Powers, Victor Rosenbaum, John Solum, Richard Aaker Trythall, Beth Wiemann, and Edgar Warren Williams.\nCone was a member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nComposition\nInstrumental works\nOrchestra\n*Elegy (1953)\n*Music for Strings (1964)\n*An Overture for the War (Prelude to Victory) (1942)\n*Symphony (1953)\n*Variations for Orchestra (1968)\nSolo instrument and orchestra\n*Cadenzas (1979) for violin, oboe, and string orchestra\n*Concerto for Violin and Small Orchestra (1959) for violin and orchestra\n*Nocturne and Rondo for Orchestra and Piano (1957) for piano and orchestra\nSmall ensemble (3–14 players)\n*Capriccio for String Quartet (1981) for 2 violins, viola, and cello\n*Clarinet Quintet (1941) for clarinet, 2 violins, viola, and cello\n*Divertimento for Woodwinds (1940–46) for flute, oboe, English horn, 2 clarinets, and bassoon\n*Fanfare (1948) for 6 trumpets, 3 horns, 3 trombones, and 2 tubas\n*Funeral Stanzas (1965) for flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon\n*Music for a Film (1951) for clarinet, 2 violins, viola, and cello\n*Ostinato, Cadenza and Finale (1990) for viola, cello, and piano\n*Quartet for Strings and Piano (1983) for violin, viola, cello, and piano\n*Quintet for Piano and Strings (1960) for 2 violins, viola, cello, and piano\n*Serenade (1975) for flute, violin, viola, and cello\n*String Quartet (#1) (1939) for 2 violins, viola, and cello\n*String Quartet (#2) (1949) for 2 violins, viola, and cello\n*String Sextet (1966) for 2 violins, 2 violas, and 2 cellos\n*String Trio (1973) for violin, viola, and cello\n*Trio (1951) for violin, cello, and piano\n*Variations on a Fan-Fair (1965) for 2 trumpets, horn, and trombone\nDuos\n*Cavatina (1976) for treble viol and harpsichord\n*Duo for Violin & Clarinet (1969) for clarinet and violin\n*Duo for Violin & Harp (1959) for violin and harp\n*''Duo for Violin and 'Cello (1963) for violin and cello\n*Elegy (1946) for violin and piano\n*Fantasy for Two Pianos (1965) for 2 pianos\n*Nocturne for 'Cello and Piano (1946) for cello and piano\n*Pastoral Variations for Flute and Harp (1996) for flute and harp\n*Prelude and Variations for Piano Four-Hands (1946) for piano four-hands\n*Rhapsody (1947) for viola and piano\n*Sonata for Violin and Piano (#1) (1940) for violin and piano\n*Sonata for Violin and Piano (#2) (1948) for violin and piano\n*Wedding Music (1977) for 2 trumpets\nSolo strings\n*Sonata for Unaccompanied Violin (1961) for violin solo\n*Sonata for Violoncello Solo (1955) for cello solo\n*Variations for Solo Viola (after 1996) for viola solo\nSolo keyboard\n*Another Page from a Diary (1985) for piano\n*Etude for Either Hand, or Both (1963) for piano\n*Fantasy (1950) for piano\n*Fantasy on a Hebrew Theme (1947) for organ\n*Fantasy on an Advent Hymn (1948) for organ with optional TBB chorus\n*In Memoriam – R.
