In 2002, the council moved out and the building left vacant until 2008. In 2010, the heritage center was relocated from the basement of Sibu Civic Centre to the council building. It then underwent renovation with a cost of more than MYR1.3 million. It was finally opened as Sibu Heritage Council in 2011.\nArchitecture\nThe center is housed in the former building of Sibu Municipal Council.\nExhibitions\nThe center displays the cultural heritage and history of various ethnic groups in central Sarawak.
