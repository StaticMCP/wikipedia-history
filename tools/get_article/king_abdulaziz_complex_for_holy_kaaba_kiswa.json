The complex oversees the design, manufacturing, and annual replacement of the Kiswah, a significant religious and cultural tradition in Islam.\nHistory\nThe tradition of covering the Kaaba dates back to the pre-Islamic era. During the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mun, the Kiswah was replaced three times a year. The practice of inscribing on the Kiswah began during the Abbasid era, with caliphs recording their names and the place and date of manufacture.\nIn 1927, King Abdulaziz Al Saud established the first Kiswah workshop in Mecca, marking the beginning of domestic production. This initiative aimed to reduce reliance on imports and ensure the quality and authenticity of the covering.\nThe facility, formerly known as the Kiswa Factory of the Holy Kaaba, was renamed in 2018 by royal decree issued by King Salman to the King Abdulaziz Complex for the Holy Kaaba Kiswa in honour of the founding king.\nLocation and Organisation\nSituated in Mecca, the complex operates under the General Presidency of Haramain. It encompasses various departments, including dyeing, weaving (both manual and machine), printing, embroidery, gilding, sewing, and quality control.\nIn addition to manufacturing the Kiswah of Kaaba and its components such as the hizam (belt) and sitara (door curtain), the complex also produces the inner green coloured Kiswa of the Kaaba and the covering for the Prophet's burial chamber.\nMaterials and Manufacture\nverses embroidered on Kiswah with gold-plated silver threads]]\nThe Kiswah is crafted from black-dyed natural silk and embroidered with gold and silver-plated threads. The process involves several stages:\n# Dyeing: Silk threads are dyed using desalinated water to prevent damage to the fabric.\n# Weaving: The dyed silk is woven into large panels.\n# Printing: Quran verses are printed onto the fabric.\n# Embroidery: Skilled artisans embroider the printed verses using gold and silver-plated threads.\n# Assembly: The embroidered panels are sewn together to form the complete Kiswah.\nEach year, approximately 825 kilograms of silk, 410 kilograms of raw cotton, 120 kilograms of gold-plated silver thread, and 60 kilograms of pure silver are used in the production.\nAnnual Replacement Ceremony\nThe Kiswah is currently replaced annually on the 1st of Muharram, the first day of the Islamic lunar calendar. Historically, the replacement was performed on the Day of Arafah, before the shift to the current schedule. The ceremony involves the removal of the old Kiswah and the installation of the new covering, a process carried out by a team of trained craftsmen.\nParticipation of Women\nIn 2024, for the first time in recorded history, women participated in the ceremonial replacement of the Kiswah. Female employees of the General Presidency for the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques assisted in manufacturing and also by carrying sections of the new Kiswah and handing them to male colleagues, who then transported the pieces to the Kaaba in Mecca.\nSee also\n* Dar al-Kiswa\n* Zamzam Well\nReferences"
