It will be the 39th annual Survivor Series and will take place on Saturday, November 29, 2025, at Petco Park in San Diego, California, and will be held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. This will be the fourth annual Survivor Series based around the WarGames match, a team-based steel cage match where the roofless cage surrounds two rings placed side by side.\nThis will be the first Survivor Series to take place in an outdoor venue, the first to take place in a stadium, the first to be held in a Major League Baseball venue, and the second event to be held in the U.S. state of California, after the 2018 event in Los Angeles. It will also feature the first WarGames match to take place inside a stadium since July 1988, which was held by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). This will also be the first Survivor Series to broadcast on Netflix internationally and on ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service in the United States. The event will also feature John Cena's last appearance at both Survivor Series and on PPV as an in-ring performer due to his retirement from professional wrestling at the end of 2025.\nProduction\nBackground\nin San Diego, California.]]\nSurvivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by WWE since 1987, generally held the week of Thanksgiving. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". From 1987 to 2021, the event was characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which were tag team elimination matches that typically featured teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In 2022, the event was rebranded as \"Survivor Series: WarGames\" and instead of Survivor Series matches, the annual event became based around the WarGames match, a type of steel cage match where two teams face each other in a roofless cage that surrounds two rings placed side by side and the teams typically feature four to five wrestlers each but is decided by one fall instead of eliminating all opponents. WWE's developmental brand NXT previously held an annual WarGames event from 2017 to 2021 before the match became a part of Survivor Series.\nAnnounced on April 21, 2025, the 39th Survivor Series was scheduled for Saturday, November 29, 2025, at Petco Park in San Diego, California. It will be the first Survivor Series event to be held in an outside venue and the first to be held in a stadium. It will be held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. On June 30, it was revealed that it would once again feature the WarGames matches.\nIn addition to airing on traditional PPV worldwide, the event will also be available to livestream on ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service in the United States, Netflix in most international markets, and the WWE Network in any remaining countries that have not yet transferred to Netflix due to pre-existing contracts. This marks the first Survivor Series to livestream on Netflix following the WWE Network's merger under the service in January 2025 in those areas, and to livestream on ESPN in the United States, as WWE's contract with Peacock to air main roster PPV and livestreaming events expired at the conclusion of Clash in Paris in August.\nStorylines\nThe event will include matches that result from scripted storylines. Results are predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines are produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\nFor most of 2025, CM Punk, Roman Reigns, and Jey Uso were involved in a rivalry against The Vision (Seth Rollins, Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed, and Paul Heyman).
