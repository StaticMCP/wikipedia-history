Limmer (born January 24, 1955) is a Minnesota politician and member of the Minnesota Senate. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, he represents the 37th District, which includes portions of Hennepin County in the northwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area. Limmer previously served in the Minnesota House of Representatives, and in 1998 he sought the Republican endorsement for Minnesota Secretary of State, losing to Mary Kiffmeyer. He was the author of the 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.\nEarly life, education, and career\nLimmer attended North Hennepin Community College, where he received an A.A., and St. Cloud State University, where he received a B.A. in criminal justice studies. He worked as a corrections officer before serving in the legislature. Limmer is a former member of the Hennepin County Corrections Advisory Commission and the Crystal Human Rights Commission. He now works as a real estate agent.\nMinnesota Legislature\nBefore being elected to the Minnesota Senate, Limmer was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, first elected in 1988 in the old House District 48A, and reelected in 1990, 1992 and 1994. After the 1992 redistricting, the area became House District 33B.\nLimmer was first elected to the Senate in a February 1995 special election held after Senator Patrick McGowan resigned upon being elected Hennepin County Sheriff. He has been continuously reelected ever since. Limmer has held multiple leadership positions, including assistant minority leader, assistant majority leader, and chair of the Judiciary and Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee. His special legislative concerns include criminal justice, public education, safe school legislation, economic development, and tax reform.\nOn April 27, 2011, Limmer introduced a bill to propose a referendum on an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution banning same-sex marriage. The bill passed, but voters rejected the amendment in the 2012 election by six percentage points.\nIn the next legislative session, Senator Scott Dibble and Representative Karen Clark introduced bills to legalize same-sex marriage in Minnesota. The Minnesota House of Representatives voted 75–59 in favor of legalization. A few days later, after debate on the Senate floor, the body also voted for legalization, 37–30. On May 14, 2013, in front of a crowd of 7,000 on the Capitol Mall in St. Paul, Governor Mark Dayton signed Dibble's and Clark's marriage equality bill into law, making Minnesota the 12th state to legalize gay marriage.\nLimmer opposes universal background checks for gun purchases. As chair of the Senate Judiciary's public safety committee, he has refused to allow any hearings on gun safety.\nPersonal life\nLimmer and his wife Lori live in Maple Grove and have three children.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.limmerforsenate.com/ Minnesota State Senator Warren Limmer Campaign] website\n*[http://www.senate.mn/members/member_bio.php?mem_id=1032 Minnesota State Senator Warren Limmer Legislative] website\n*[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/projects/ongoing/votetracker/legislator_view.php?id=43 Minnesota Public Radio Votetracker: Senator Warren Limmer]\n*[http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=3908 Project Vote Smart - Senator Warren Limmer Profile]\n|-"
