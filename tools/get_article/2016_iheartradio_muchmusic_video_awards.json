The co-branding was meant to \"further elevate the MMVAs internationally\" as part of efforts to bring Bell-owned content into the U.S. via iHeartRadio.\nDuring the broadcast several artists paused to acknowledge the Orlando nightclub shooting that had taken place a week earlier, including singer Nick Jonas who dedicated his award to those involved.\nPerformances\n{|
