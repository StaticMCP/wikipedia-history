The book presents Western history from the collapse of the Roman Empire and the pivotal role played by members of the clergy at the time. A particular focus is placed upon Saint Patrick. The book details his early struggles through slavery, mirroring much of the content in The Confession of Saint Patrick. Initial portions of the book examine Ireland before the arrivals of Patrick and Saint Augustine of Canterbury. Particular focus is placed upon Saint Columba, the monks he trained, and the monasteries he set up in the Hiberno-Scottish mission. These holy men, according to Cahill, \"single-handedly refounded European civilization throughout the continent.\" (p.&nbsp;4)\nPublication and reception\nHow the Irish Saved Civilization was first published in March 1995 and appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List for almost two years.\nIt was favourably reviewed in many general-interest, quality newspapers and magazines. However, it also provoked criticism from other reviewers, some of whom offered qualified praise or outright rejections of the main thesis, and some of whom perceived bias.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.catholicity.com/mccloskey/cahillreview.html How the Irish Saved Civilization] book review by Father John McCloskey @CatholiCity"
