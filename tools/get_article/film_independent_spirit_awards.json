The ceremony is produced by Film Independent, a not-for-profit arts organization that used to produce the LA Film Festival. Film Independent members vote to determine the winners of the Spirit Awards.\nThe awards show has been held in a tent on a beach in Santa Monica, California, historically on the Saturday before the Academy Awards. In 2023, the ceremony was moved to the week before the Oscars, with the expectation that its winners could influence the final days of Oscar voting. The show was previously broadcast live on the IFC network in the US until 2023, when it was moved to YouTube, as well as Hollywood Suite in Canada and A&E Latin America. Winners were previously presented with acrylic glass pyramids containing suspended shoestrings representing the bare budgets of independent films.\nIn 2020, new categories were announced for the 36th Independent Spirit Awards, which would honor the best in television productions and performances. These categories included Best New Scripted Series, Best New Non-Scripted or Documentary Series, Best Male Performance, Best Female Performance, and Best Ensemble Cast. In 2022, it was announced that gender neutral acting categories would be implemented and that the previous gendered film categories — Male Lead, Female Lead, Male Supporting and Female Supporting — would be retired in favor of a Best Lead Performance and a Best Supporting Performance categories, which would feature 10 nominees each. Other new categories added included Best Breakthrough Performance and Best Lead and Supporting Performance in the TV section.\n, films competing for Independent Spirit Awards must have budgets lower than $28 million, but no budget cap exists for television shows.\nIn 2026, the show will take place on February 15, 2026, at the Palladium in Hollywood.\nCategories\nFilm categories\nTelevision categories\nEmerging filmmakers awards\nRetired categories\nHistory\nFounded in 1979, the New York-based organization Independent Feature Project is now known as The Gotham Film & Media Institute, with Gotham TV Awards and Gotham Independent Film Awards.\nBy 1981, Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas and a small semi-informal group of directors–filmmakers, writers and producers began  to regularly meet, share knowledge and support each other's projects, eventually calling themselves  was soon known as Independent Feature Project/West''. Robert \"Bob\" Rosen, former Dean of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, was one of the founding board members.\nIn 1984 the FINDIE Awards (Friends of Independents) were conceived by Independent Features Project/West board member Jeanne Lucas and Independent Features Project/West President Anne Kimmel and director/writer Sam O'Brien was an event producer. The awards are voted on by a nominating committee.\nIn 1985, Peter Coyote and Jamie Lee Curtis presented winners with a Plexiglas pyramid designed by Carol Bosselman, which contain a suspended shoestring, printed with sprocket holes, representing the shoestring budgets of independent films. The Reel Gold Award, also designed by Bosselman,  was given to Steve Wachtel for allowing Independent Features Project/West continuing free use of his screening room. It was associated with Filmex.  In 1986, Bosselman designed and sculpted the Independent Spirit Award statue that is still given out today, using a lost wax bronze casting method.\n1985 Awards\n:Source:\n*Best Feature, After Hours\n*Best Director, Joel Coen\n*Best Female Lead, Geraldine Page\n*Best Male Lead, M.

Welsh, who had served as president since 2012, was remembered for his immense contributions to the organization and the film community.\nCeremonies\nFormerly held at a restaurant, and a hotel, and a ballroom, it is most recently held the day before the Academy Awards as a luncheon event in a tented parking lot next to the ocean in Santa Monica.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!#\n!Date\n!Year Honored\n!Best Film\n!Best First Feature\n!Host(s)\n|-\n|1st\n|March 22, 1986\n|1985\n|After Hours\n|—\n|Peter Coyote\n|-\n|2nd\n|March 28, 1987\n|1986\n|Platoon\n|''She's Gotta Have It''\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Buck Henry\n|-\n|3rd\n|February 11, 1988\n|1987\n|''River's Edge\n|Dirty Dancing\n|-\n|4th\n|March 25, 1989\n|1988\n|Stand and Deliver\n|Mystic Pizza\n|-\n|5th\n|March 24, 1990\n|1989\n|Sex, Lies, and Videotape\n|Heathers\n|-\n|6th\n|March 23, 1991\n|1990\n|The Grifters\n|Metropolitan\n|-\n|7th\n|March 28, 1992\n|1991\n|Rambling Rose\n|Straight Out of Brooklyn\n|-\n|8th\n|March 27, 1993\n|1992\n|The Player\n|The Waterdance\n|-\n|9th\n|March 19, 1994\n|1993\n|Short Cuts\n|El Mariachi\n|Robert Townsend\n|-\n|10th\n|March 25, 1995\n|1994\n|Pulp Fiction\n|Spanking the Monkey\n|Kevin Pollak\n|-\n|11th\n|March 23, 1996\n|1995\n|Leaving Las Vegas\n|The Brothers McMullen\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Samuel L.
