The song was supported by a live video and a lyric video.  \"The First Hymn\" covers the song P.Oxy 1786, which, written in the 3rd century AD, is credited as being the earliest known Christian Greek hymn to contain both lyrics and musical notation.  The single's tracklist featured both a studio recording, as well as a live recording, from the Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas.  \"The First Hymn\" was featured in a documentary of the same name, directed by Dr. John Dickson, which studied the origins of P.Oxy 1786.  It premiered at Biola University on April 14, 2025, and was made available digitally in August 2025.

The following day, \"How Good It Is\" was officially released and the album was made available for preorder.

On July 27, the song appeared on Fox & Friends, premiering to Television audiences.\n\"Doesn't He\" was released as a promotional single on August 8, 2025, supported by a lyric video.
