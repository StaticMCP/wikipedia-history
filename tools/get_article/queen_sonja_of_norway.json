They had kept their relationship a secret due to the controversy of Sonja's status as a commoner. Harald had told his father, King Olav V, that he would remain unmarried if his father did not grant consent to marry Sonja. Upon their marriage, Sonja became crown princess and later the queen of Norway upon her husband's accession to the throne in 1991, becoming Norway's first queen consort in 52 years. The couple has two children together: Princess Märtha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon.\nAs queen, Sonja holds patronage of up to fifteen organisations. Sonja has also served as Vice President of the Norwegian Red Cross from 1987 to 1990. In 2005, she became the first queen to visit Antarctica. In 2017, she was awarded the Trysil-Knut Prize, making her the first woman to receive the award. She is also known for her interest in music, art and culture, having founded the Queen Sonja International Music Competition and the Queen Sonja Print Award. She is also a graphic artist and ceramicist, with many of her works being featured in exhibitions across Norway and other countries.\nEarly life\nSonja Haraldsen was born on 4 July 1937 in Oslo, the daughter of clothing merchant Karl August Haraldsen and Dagny Ulrichsen. She had three siblings, Haakon Haraldsen, Gry Henriksen and Karl Herman Haraldsen, who died in a boating accident. She grew up at Tuengen Allé 1B in the district of Vinderen in Oslo and completed her lower secondary schooling in 1954. She received a diploma in dressmaking and tailoring at the Oslo Vocational School, and a diploma from École Professionnelle des Jeunes Filles (a finishing school) in Lausanne, Switzerland. There, she studied accounting, fashion design, and social science. She returned to Norway for further studies and received an undergraduate degree (French, English and Art History) from the University of Oslo.\nMarriage\nIn June 1959 she first met Crown Prince Harald (the future King Harald V) at a party hosted by Johan H. Stenersen. Later in August the Crown Prince invited her to his graduation ball, where they were photographed together for the first time. They dated for nine years, although their relationship had been kept secret because she was a commoner. The Crown Prince made it clear to his father, King Olav V, that he would remain unmarried for life unless he could marry her. This would in effect have put an end to the rule of his family, and likely to the monarchy in Norway, as Harald was the sole heir to the throne. Faced with having to choose one of his relatives from the Danish royal family, the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein or even the Grand Dukes of Oldenburg as his new heir in place of his son, Olav V consulted the government for advice; as a result, Sonja became engaged to Crown Prince Harald on 19 March 1968. The couple married on 29 August 1968, at Oslo Cathedral. She thus acquired the style of Royal Highness and the title of Crown Princess of Norway.\nPublic life\nfor Prince Carl Philip's wedding, 2015]]\nFollowing the death of King Olav V on 17 January 1991, Sonja became Norway's first queen consort in 52 years. Queen Sonja accompanied King Harald V when he swore his oath to uphold the Constitution in the Storting on 21 January 1991. During Haakon VII of Norway's reign, his wife Queen Maud died in 1938 and his son Olav V was then crown prince when his wife Princess Märtha of Sweden died in 1954 before he became king three years later. It was also the first time in 69 years that a Norwegian queen had been present in the Storting. Since his accession, Queen Sonja has accompanied the King to the formal opening of the autumn session of the Storting and the reading of the Speech from the Throne.\nIn accordance with their own wishes, the King and Queen were consecrated in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 23 June 1991. Following the consecration, the King and Queen conducted a 10-day tour of Southern Norway. In 1992, the entire royal family conducted a 22-day tour of Norway's four northernmost counties.\nThe Queen accompanies the King on official state visits abroad. She acts as the hostess when foreign heads of state officially visit Norway.\nIn 2005, Queen Sonja became the first queen ever to visit Antarctica. The Queen was there to open the Norwegian Troll research station in the country's Antarctic dependency, Queen Maud Land. The Queen flew in on one of the Royal Norwegian Air Force's C-130H Hercules transport aircraft, landing at Troll Airfield.\nIn 2017 Queen Sonja was awarded the Trysil-Knut Prize. She is the first woman to ever receive the award.\nThe Queen was appointed a Rear Admiral in the Royal Norwegian Navy and a Brigadier in the Norwegian Army. She has undergone a basic officer training course and has participated in exercises.\nOn 17 January 2021, Queen Sonja celebrated 30 years as Norway's queen consort.\nActivities\nIn 1972, Sonja was involved in establishing Princess Märtha Louise's Fund, which provides assistance to disabled children in Norway. She has taken active part in large-scale initiatives to raise funds for international refugees and spent time in the 1970s visiting Vietnamese boat refugees in Malaysia.\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Crown Princess Sonja served as Vice President of the Norwegian Red Cross. She was responsible for the organisation's international activities. She took part in a Red Cross delegation to Botswana and Zimbabwe in 1989.\nQueen Sonja's School Award was established in 2006 and is awarded to schools who have \"demonstrated excellence in its efforts to promote inclusion and equality\".\nIn 2021, Frank Rossavik said that now she is starting an [art] gallery, to sell works by artists that she has given her prestigious prizes to.\nPersonal interests\nSonja established the Queen Sonja International Music Competition in 1988. It was originally for pianists, but in 1995 the competition became only for singers. The jury consists of diverse authoritative figures in opera and the winners receive a cash amount and prestigious engagements at Norwegian music institutions.\nShe is a longtime avid photographer and has a keen interest in art. She is a printmaker, and held exhibitions with artists Kjell Nupen and Ørnulf Opdahl in 2011 and 2013. The Queen Sonja Nordic Art Award was established in 2011 with Tiina Kivinen from Finland being the first recipient in 2012. The prize will be awarded every other year.\nIn 2017, The Queen Sonja Art Stable was opened, a venue which will function as a scene for arts and culture. Together with King Harald, the queen has for decades attempted to establish a palace museum in Oslo.\nThe Queen is a keen hiker, and this was marked by a sculpture unveiled for her 80th birthday as a gift from the Norwegian Trekking Association.\nHealth\nIn January 2025, Sonja was admitted to Lillehammer Hospital for observation following atrial fibrillation while on a skiing trip. She underwent surgery at the Oslo University Hospital on 16 January to receive a pacemaker implant. In April 2025, she was hospitalised at the National Hospital due to shortness of breath.\nIn popular culture\nIn 2025 Amazon Prime Video released the period drama The Commoner, which tells the story of the fight of then Crown Prince Harald and Sonja Haraldsen for their right to marry. Queen Sonja of Norway is portrayed by Gina Bernhoft Gørvell.\nIssue\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Birth\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Marriage\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Children\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Spouse\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Princess Märtha Louise\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| Divorced 2017\n| Ari Behn\n|\n|-\n|-\n|\n| Durek Verrett\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby\n|\n|}\nArms\nFile:Coat of arms of Queen Sonja of Norway.png|Coat of arms\nFile:Royal Monogram of Queen Sonja of Norway.svg|Monogram\nHonours\nIn 1982 she was awarded the Nansen Refugee Award.
