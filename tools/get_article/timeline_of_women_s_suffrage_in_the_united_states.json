Anthony, 1870\nportrait by Mathew Brady, c. 1870]]\nintroduced the first federal amendment to grant women the right to vote.]]\n1789:  The Constitution of the United States grants the states the power to set voting requirements. Generally, states limited this right to property-owning or tax-paying white males (about 6% of the population). However, New Jersey also gave the vote to unmarried and widowed women who met the property qualifications, regardless of color. Married women were not allowed to own property and hence could not vote.\n1800s\n1807: Voting rights are taken away from women in New Jersey.\n1830s\n1838: Kentucky passes the first statewide woman suffrage law allowing female heads of household in rural areas to vote in elections deciding on taxes and local boards for the new county \"common school\" system.\n1840s\n1848:  New York. Women's suffrage was proposed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and agreed to after an impassioned argument from Frederick Douglass.\n1850s\n1850: The first National Woman's Rights Convention, in Worcester, Massachusetts, attracted more  than 1,000 participants from 11 states.\n1853: On the occasion of the World's Fair in New York City, suffragists hold a meeting in the Broadway Tabernacle.\n1860s\n1861–1865: The American Civil War.

This periodical carries the motto “Men, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less!” Caroline Seymour Severance establishes the New England Woman’s Club.  The “Mother of Clubs” sparked the club movement which became popular by the late nineteenth century. In Vineland, New Jersey, 172 women cast ballots in a separate box during the presidential election. Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas introduces the federal woman’s suffrage amendment in Congress. Many early suffrage supporters, including Susan B. Anthony, remained single because, in the mid-1800s, married women could not own property in their rights and could not make legal contracts on their own behalf. The Fourteenth Amendment is ratified. \"Citizens\" and \"voters\" are defined exclusively as male.\n1869: The territory of Wyoming is the first to grant unrestricted suffrage to women.\n1869: The suffrage movement splits into the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association.

The amendment holds that neither the United States nor any State can deny the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" leaving open the right of States to deny the right to vote on account of sex.  Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton oppose the amendment. Many of their former allies in the abolitionist movement, including Lucy Stone, support the amendment.\n1871: Victoria Woodhull speaks to the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, arguing that women have the right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but the committee does not agree.\n1871: The Anti-Suffrage Society is formed.\n1872: A suffrage proposal before the Dakota Territory legislature loses by one vote.\n1872: Susan B.
