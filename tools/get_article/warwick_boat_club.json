Unusually it includes separate \"sections\" and good grounds for tennis, squash and bowls, and is affiliated to British Rowing. It has social events with catering, live bands, and barbeques on the banks of the river.\nThe club operates according to its values: progressive; positive; inclusive; safe; sustainable and always acting with integrity, and so attracts members from Warwick, Leamington, Stratford-upon-Avon, Solihull, Banbury, Coventry and surrounding areas.\nHistory\nThe club was founded in 1861 by a few young gentlemen with the first president being R. C. Heath. The club purchased its first boat, a four-oar racing gig, from Salters in Oxford.\nIts club/boat houses were upgraded by rebuilding in 2013.\nReferences"
