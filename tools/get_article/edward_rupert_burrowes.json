After his father's death, the family had little money to live on. When Burrowes left primary school he became a tailor's apprentice.\nHe continued to study from books, and passed examinations in English Language and Literature, English History, and Scripture. He passed the City and Guilds examinations at an unusually young age, and was able to open his own tailoring shop.\nArtist and teacher\nBurrowes was interested in art from an early age, and had natural talent.\nUnable to afford to buy paints, he worked out how to make them using tailor's chalk.\nHe was a frequent visitor to the Georgetown Museum, and was fascinated by the Indian artefacts and displays of Guyanese geology that he saw there.\nThe British Guiana Arts and Crafts Society (BGACS) was formed in 1932, and Burrowes became a member.\nThe established BGACS members were impressed by the talent he displayed in his landscape and genre paintings.\nThe latter depicted working-class people in everyday scenes.\nBurrowes began teaching Working Peoples' Free Art Class, which influenced artists such as Dr Denis Williams.\nHis goal was to give ordinary working people an opportunity to develop their artistic talents.\nBurrowes founded the WPAC in 1948.\nIn 1949 he received a British Council scholarship which let him attend the Brighton College of Art, where he specialised in block printing.\nWhen he returned after a year, he was appointed Art teacher at the Government Teachers' Training College. In the 1954 New Year Honours, Burrowes was appointed a Member of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire for services to art in British Guiana.\nIn 1956 he was teaching Art and Art History at Queen's College.\nHe died aged 63 in 1966.\nAchievements\nIn 1947, Donald Locke attended a class taught in Georgetown by Burrowes, which inspired him to take up painting.\nWriting about Burrowes in the 1966 Guyana Independence Issue of New World, Locke describes how Burrowes was constantly engaged in \"technical exploration\", including making his own paints from unlikely ingredients and conducting experiments \"with balata, buckram, tailor's canvas, rice bags, bitumen, concrete and ... clay mixed with molasses.\"\nDenis Williams called him \"the Barbadian who fathered the plastic arts in Guyana in terms of a European ancestry.\"\nThe WPAC helped a number of Guyanese artists at the start of their career.\nStanley Greaves attended the WPAC with Locke as a teenager and later became well known.\nEmerson Samuels was another artist who studied at the WPAC.\nThe painter Aubrey Williams studied with E. R. Burrowes in the Working People's Art Class after returning from a two-year term with the Agriculture department in which he had lived with indigenous people in the jungle. In 1987, Williams described Burrowes as \"a genius\" who \"opened the Guyanese eyes to art, in its aesthetic sense\".\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n|url=http://roger.ugnotesonline.com/mcys/burrowes_school_of_art.html\n|title=Brief on the Burrowe's School of Art\n|publisher=Burrowes School of Art\n|access-date=12 August 2012\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127220526/http://roger.ugnotesonline.com/mcys/burrowes_school_of_art.html\n|archive-date=27 January 2012\n|url-status=dead\n}}\n*\n* |url=http://mcys.gov.gy/er_burrowes.html\n|publisher=Ministry of Culture\n|title=E.R Burrowes School of Art\n|access-date=8 August 2012}}\n*\n* |url=http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2010/12/07/renowned-artist-sculptor-donald-locke-passes-away/\n|title=Renowned Artist/Sculptor Donald Locke passes away\n|journal=Kaieteur News\n|date=7 December 2010 |access-date=5 August 2012}}\n*\n* |url=http://www.landofsixpeoples.com/news303/ns308177.htm\n|title=Samuels made a distinguished contribution to Guyanese art —Castellani House\n|journal=Stabroek News\n|date=17 August 2003\n|access-date=8 August 2012}}\n*\n*\n*\n*"
