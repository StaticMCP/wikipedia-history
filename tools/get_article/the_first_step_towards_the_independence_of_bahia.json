The commission also specified that \"...the scene will be painted on site and recreated with the utmost fidelity, and the characters who distinguished themselves in such a glorious moment will be portrayed when there is a portrait or documents that serve as guidance for this purpose.\"\nParreiras conceived the work to allow for the integration, on the same plane of the scene, of buildings that are arranged differently in reality. The most poignant scene in the painting, in the foreground in the lower right corner, depicts the agony of Tambor Soledade, an episode considered mythical, rescued by an officer.\nThe main painting, commissioned by the Bahia state government, is in the Rio Branco Palace; the other, smaller one, is in the Cachoeira City Council. The two paintings have slight differences, and some subsequent adjustments were made.\nAntônio Diogo da Silva Parreiras\nAntônio Diogo da Silva Parreiras was a painter, designer, illustrator, writer and teacher who was born and died in the city of Niterói. His landscape paintings can be considered as representations of landscapes and moments, events considered sublime. Parreiras approached nature with the eyes of an artist, feeling it with the emotion that it causes in those who personally witness what he portrays. He had the desire to interpret nature when it still seemed to have been untouched.\nReferences"
