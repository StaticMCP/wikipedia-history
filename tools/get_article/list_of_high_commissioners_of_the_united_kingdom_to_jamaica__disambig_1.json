Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors.\nBetween 2005 and 2019, the British high commissioner to Jamaica was also non-resident high commissioner to The Bahamas.\nHigh commissioners to Jamaica\n* 1962–1965: Sir Alexander Morley\n* 1965–1970: Dalton Murray\n* 1970–1973: Sir Nick Larmour\n* 1973–1976: John Hennings\n* 1976–1981: John Drinkall\n* 1982–1984: Barry Smallman\n* 1984–1987: Sir Martin Reid\n* 1987–1989: Alan Payne\n* 1989–1995: Derek Milton\n* 1995–1999: Richard Thomas\n* 1999–2002: Antony Smith CMG\n* 2002–2005: Peter Mathers\n* 2005–2009: Jeremy Cresswell\n* 2009–2013: Howard Drake\n* 2013–2017: David Fitton\n* 2017–2021: Asif Ahmad\n* 2021–2025: Judith Slater\n* 2021–: Alicia Herbert\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-jamaica British High Commission Kingston]"
