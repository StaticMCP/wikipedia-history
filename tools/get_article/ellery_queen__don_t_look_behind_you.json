It aired on NBC.\nProduction\nThe film was intended to spawn a new television series like the earlier versions of the character (The Adventures of Ellery Queen). Richard Levinson and William Link authored the script but were so dismayed with the changes made during production that they took their names off and instead used a pseudonym, \"Ted Leighton\".\nNotably, the character of Inspector Richard Queen is here portrayed as Ellery's uncle instead of his father, as in the original stories. Critics speculated that this change was made because Harry Morgan was only eight years older than Peter Lawford and because the two had different accents (American and British).\nCast\n* Peter Lawford – Ellery Queen\n* Harry Morgan – Inspector Richard Queen\n* E.G.

The show lasted one season, but has remained a cult classic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
