Music videos were released for the tracks \"Light Bearer\" on 29 May, and for \"Holy War\" on 29 June. Holy War had a successful first week of sales, charting at No. 7 in Australia and No. 82 in the U.S. as well as several other U.S. Charts.\nLyrical content\nAs opposed to previous albums, Holy War focuses on the subjects of child abuse, animal rights, religion, politics, and war.\n}}\nCritical reception\n| rev2       = Exclaim!\n| rev2Score  = 7/10\n| rev3       = Metal Hammer\n| rev3Score  = 4/5\n| rev4       = Rolling Stone Australia\n| rev4Score  =\n| rev5       = Ultimate Guitar\n| rev5Score  = 7.2/10\n}}\nHoly War received mostly positive reviews from critics. Writing for Rolling Stone Australia, Sally McNullen gave the album four of five stars and described the album as \"their darkest and most technically complex release yet,\" while noting that the band \"don't stray too far from their sonic roots.\" Writing for Metal Hammer, Jason Hicks gave the album the same score. He wrote that in comparison to previous releases the band are \"noticeably more focused and ferocious in their attack,\" concluding that \"The end result is unquestionably Thy Art Is Murder's best release to date – one that undoubtedly cements their name among the best death metal bands out there today.\"\nBradly Zorgdrager's review for Exclaim! was similarly positive, awarding the album 7/10. He wrote that \"Holy War carves finds a happy medium between the soul-sucking breakdowns of their last release and the eccentric pyrotechnics of their first. There are more emotions than merely the titular Hate of their last, and the soaring solos sound positively triumphant.\" However he criticised some aspects of the band's sound, finishing his review by noting that \"Though the album could do without the all-too-clichéd ominous riffs over chugs – let's call them chugly passages – it's a small price to pay for this victory.\"\nThe album was included at number 18 on Rock Sounds top 50 releases of 2015 list.\nTrack listing\n| total_length    = 41:01\n| title11         = Vengeance\n| length11        = 2:23\n}}\nCredits\nWriting, performance and production credits are adapted from the album liner notes.\nPersonnel\nThy Art Is Murder\n* Chris \"CJ\" McMahon – vocals\n* Andy Marsh – lead guitar\n* Sean Delander – bass, rhythm guitar\n* Lee Stanton – drums\nGuest musicians\n* Winston McCall of Parkway Drive – vocals on \"Coffin Dragger\"\nProduction\n* Will Putney – production, engineering, mixing\n* Randy Leboeuf – additional engineering\n* Steve Seid – editing\n* Tom Smith Jr. – editing\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\nDesign and artwork\n* Andy Marsh – art direction\n* Thomas Savage – photography\n* Sebastian Lux – design, layout\n* Musician known as R%\nStudios\n* Graphic Nature Audio, Belleville, NJ, U.S. – recording, mixing\n* Sterling Sound, New York City, NY, U.S. – mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
