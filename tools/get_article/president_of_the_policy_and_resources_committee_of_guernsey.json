The head of government is not directly elected by the people but rather by the legislature, the States of Guernsey.\nThe current P&RC president is Lindsay de Sausmarez.\nHistory\nFollowing a reform of the institutions of Guernsey adopted in July 2015, a five-member senior committee, Policy and Resources Committee, headed by a president was created on 1 May 2016 to replace the Policy Council. The position of Chief Minister, who chaired the Policy Council, was abolished, along with the ministerial government system.\nSelection\nThe 40 members of the States of Guernsey  hold a secret ballot election to determine the president, with successive rounds of voting continuing until an outright winner is elected. All candidates must be proposed and seconded. The president of the committee is the de facto head of government of Guernsey and may be given the title \"Chief Minister\".\nThe President can be removed through a motion of \"no confidence\" by the members of the States of Guernsey. In the event that the vote is lost, it results in the immediate resignation of the President and Members of the Policy & Resources Committee, the States of Deliberation having no confidence in the said Committee and will result in an immediate election of first a new President and then the new committee members.\nList of titleholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:70%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | #\n! scope=\"col\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Took office\n! scope=\"col\" | Left office\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Political party\n! scope=\"col\" | Election\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Vice President\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Gavin St Pier\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4 May 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 16 October 2020\n| style=\"width:1%; background-color:;\" | &nbsp;\n| Independent\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | (vacant)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#0A7836;\" | &nbsp;\n| Guernsey Partnership of Independents\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Peter Ferbrache\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 16 October 2020\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 13 December 2023\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:;\" | &nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Independent\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2020\n| style=\"background-color:#0A7836;\" | &nbsp;\n| Heidi Soulsby\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"background:#548235\" | &nbsp;\n| Mark Helyer\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n|\n| Lyndon Trott\n| 13 December 2023\n| 1 July 2025\n| style=\"background-color:#0A7836;\" | &nbsp;\n| Future Guernsey\n|\n| style=\"background-color:#0A7836;\" | &nbsp;\n| Heidi Soulsby\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n|\n| Lindsay de Sausmarez\n| 1 July 2025\n| incumbent\n|  | &nbsp;\n|\n| 2025\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Gavin St Pier\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|}\nReferences"
