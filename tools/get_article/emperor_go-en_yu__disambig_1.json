According to pre-Meiji scholars, his reign spanned the years from 1371 through 1382.\nThis Nanboku-chō \"sovereign\" was named after the 10th century Emperor En'yū and go- (後), translates literally as \"later;\" and thus, he may be called the \"Later Emperor En'yū\", or, in some older sources, may be identified as \"Emperor En'yū, the second\", or as \"Emperor En'yū II.\"\nGenealogy\nHis personal name was Ohito (緒仁).\nHe was the second son of the fourth Northern Pretender Emperor Go-Kōgon.  His mother was Fujiwara no Nakako (藤原仲子), Hirohashi Kanetsuna's daughter.\n*Consort: Sanjō Itsuko (三条 厳子) (also known as Fujiwara no Izuko). Sanjō Kintada's daughter.\n**First son: Imperial Prince Motohito (幹仁親王) later Emperor Go-Komatsu\n**First daughter: Imperial Princess Keiko (1381–1399; 珪子内親王)\n*Lady-in-waiting Fujiwara no Imako (藤原今子), Shijō Takasato's daughter\n**Second son: Imperial Prince Priest Dōchō (1378–1446; 道朝法親王)\n*Naishi: Ogimachi Sanjo Sanetoshi's daughter\n*Naishi: Azechi-no-tsubone, Tachibana Tomoshige's daughter\n*unknown\n** daughter: (d.1391)\n** daughter: ???\n** son: ???\nEvents of Go-En'yū's life\nIn his own lifetime, Go-En'yū and those around him believed that he occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 9 April 1371 to 24 May 1382.\nIn 1371, by Imperial Proclamation, he received the rank of shinnō (親王), or Imperial Prince (and potential heir).  Immediately afterwards, he became emperor upon the abdication of his father, Emperor Go-Kōgon.  There was said to be a disagreement between Go-Kōgon and the retired Northern Emperor Emperor Sukō over the Crown Prince.  With the support of Hosokawa Yoriyuki, who controlled the Bakufu, Go-Kōgon's son became the Northern Emperor.\nUntil 1374, Go-Kōgon ruled as cloistered emperor.  In 1368, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was named shōgun, and with his guardianship, the Imperial Court was stabilized.  In 1382, upon abdicating to Emperor Go-Komatsu, his cloistered rule began.  Having no actual power, he rebelled, attempting suicide and accusing Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and his consort Itsuko of adultery.\nIn 1392, peace with the Southern Court being concluded, the Period of the Northern and Southern Courts came to an end.  On 6 June 1393, Go-En'yū died. He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called Fukakusa no kita no misasagi (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.\nEras of Go-En'yū's reign\nThe years of Go-En'yū's Nanboku-chō reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n:'Nanboku-chō Southern court'\n*Eras as reckoned by legitimate Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)\n** Kentoku        (1370–1372)\n** Benchū  (1372–1375)\n** Tenju          (1375–1381)\n** Kōwa      (1381–1384)\n:'Nanboku-chō Northern court'\n*Eras as reckoned by pretender Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)\n** Ōan         (1368–1375)\n** Eiwa            (1375–1379)\n** Kōryaku (1379–1381)\n** Eitoku          (1381–1384)\nSouthern Court rivals\n*Emperor Chōkei\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
