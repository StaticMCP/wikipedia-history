Marching along the river Boarn the Frankish army reached the mouth of the river where it used to flow into the Bordine estuary or Middelsee. This estuary has since silted up and was claimed for agriculture during the 10th to 14th century.\nThe Frisians commanded by King Poppo used boats to land their army in Jirnsum and surprise the Franks. However, the Frisian army was beaten and Poppo killed. The Franks gained control of the Frisian lands west of the Lauwers estuary and the Frisians became vassals of the Franks apart from the tribes living in East Frisia in present-day Germany.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Fredegarius, Liber Historiae Francorum"
