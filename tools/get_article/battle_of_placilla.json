The Congressist victory in the battle effectively determined the outcome of the war. Congressist troops entered Santiago on August 30. President José Manuel Balmaceda committed suicide inside the Argentine embassy in Santiago on 19 September.\nGallery\nAfter the Battle of Placilla illustration AE149N518 0004.jpg|After the Battle of Placilla illustration\nReferences"
