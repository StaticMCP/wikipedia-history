CashPoints are identical to bonus points, 1 CashPoint is equal to 1 Norwegian Krone. Points can be used to pay for tickets or related products such as seat reservations or baggage. Norwegian Reward does not work with traditional status levels, but frequent flyers can get extra benefits called 'Rewards'.\nBank Norwegian is linked to the benefits programme and with the credit card, Norwegian Card customers earn CashPoints on all their purchases. They can also earn CashPoints on purchases made in other areas such as insurance, groceries and mobile phones.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.norwegianreward.com/ Norwegian Reward]"
