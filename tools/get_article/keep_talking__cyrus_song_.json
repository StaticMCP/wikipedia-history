It was released digitally and on CD single on 12 February 2016. The song debuted at number 44 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The music video was released on 11 February 2016.\nCyrus explains the song is about the breaking down of a relationship, saying \"This song is about that helpless point in a relationship where nothing you seem to do can make it better. You might change what you do and take the blame – even when you think you shouldn't, hoping that will fix it. It's at that moment when you realise that walking away is the only thing you can do, but also is the thing that was meant to happen.\"\nCyrus performed \"Keep Talking\" live on The Morning Show and The Daily Edition  on 2 March 2016.\nTrack listing\n*Digital download\n# \"Keep Talking\" – 3:32\n*CD single\n# \"Keep Talking\" – 3:24\n# \"Keep Talking\" (Acoustic)  – 3:24\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
