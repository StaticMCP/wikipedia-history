The whites were conservative and supporters of Federalism, while the red-colored supported liberalism and were close to the Unitarians.\nThe battle meant a success for the government. This is considered the birth of the National Party (\"blancos\", white) and the Colorado Party (\"colorados\", red-colored).\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of Carpinteria\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Carpintería"
