The two candidates were incumbent president Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat and Lodongiin Tüdev, a renowned writer, editor and prominent political figure. Ochirbat had been elected president of the Mongolian People's Republic by the People's Grand Khural in the aftermath of the 1990 revolution and was nominated as a candidate by a coalition between the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP) and the Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP). Tüdev was nominated as candidate by the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP).\nThe result was a victory for Ochirbat, who received 60% of the vote. Voter turnout was 93%, which remains the highest turnout for a presidential election and the only time the turnout for a presidential election was over 90%. It was the first loss in an election by the MPRP since the adoption of the 1990 constitution.\nBackground\nFall of communism\nFollowing mass demonstrations calling for democracy and reform, the General Secretary of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Jambyn Batmönkh, and other politburo leaders announced their resignation on March 1990, paving the way for democratic change in Mongolia.\nOn 21 March 1990, during the 8th Extraordinary People's Grand Khural session, the following constitutional provision: \"The guiding force of the Mongolian People's Republic is the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which uses the all-conquering Marxist-Leninist theory in its operations.\" was removed from the Constitution of the MPR, officially ending 70 years of one-party rule.\nTransition to democracy\nThe first multi-party parliamentary elections were held on July 1990 for the People's Grand Khural and the State Little Khural with a high turnout of 98%. The MPRP won both elections to both houses, while opposition parties made modest gains. Ochirbat was re-elected as a deputy to the People's Grand Khural in the 1990 elections and was appointed to the newly created position of President of the Mongolian People's Republic in September.\n(leftmost) and PM Dashiin Byambasüren (rightmost)]]\nIn January 1992 a new constitution was ratified, renaming the country Mongolia and changing Ochirbat's title to \"President of Mongolia and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces\". After the ratification, parliamentary elections were held on 28 June 1992. The MPRP once again won a supermajority, securing 70 seats out of the total 76 seats in the reformed State Great Khural with 57% of the vote. This was largely attributed to the party's adoption of new ideas like multiparty governance and support for a free market economy. The MNDP, a coalition compromising of the Mongolian National Progress Party (MNPP) and the Mongolian Democratic Party (MDP), was led by Tsaikhiagiin Elbegdorj and won four seats with 17% of the vote. The Mongolian Social Democratic Party, supported by the German SPD, won one seat with 10% of the vote.\nLocal elections were held in October, the same year. The ruling MPRP won all 18 governorships of the country's provinces and almost 90% of all sum legislature seats.\nNominations\nBoth Ochirbat and Tüdev were members of the MPRP, but belonged to different factions within the party. During a party meeting in the spring of 1993 Ochirbat was rejected as the MPRP's pick for the presidential candidate, with the party instead selecting Tüdev, a well-known writer, editor and intellectual figure.\nIn response, the MNDP and MSDP united as a coalition and nominated Ochirbat as their coalition candidate for the 1993 presidential election.\nResults\nVoting began at 7:00 and ended at 22:00. Ochirbat received 60% of the vote and was re-elected as president at the age of 51, becoming the first democratic president to be elected.\n|party2=Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party|votes2=397061\n|invalid=36073\n|electorate=1106403\n|source=Nohlen et al.\n}}\nReferences"
