Continuity announcers can also be found on digital and satellite channels and are live at all times.\nBBC\nThe BBC mainly uses live announcers on its flagship television channels BBC One and BBC Two, and on its digital channels (apart from BBC News and BBC Parliament, which do not use announcers at all). Separate continuity for BBC One and BBC Two in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is provided by local announcers who also double as transmission directors.\nPresently, the only UK national radio station to use continuity announcers is BBC Radio 4, where many of the announcing staff also act as newsreaders and also introduce the station's Shipping Forecast. The BBC World Service still uses announcers as radio newsreaders but live continuity was discontinued in the early 2010s. Until about 1990, BBC Radio 2 used continuity announcers (separate from newsreaders) for its weekend and evening output, but these have since disappeared. Similarly, BBC Radio 3 has downgraded the former role of its announcers in favour of a new style of presenter. Continuity announcers played a much heavier role on the pre-1967 BBC Home Service, BBC Light Programme and BBC Third Programme (and other services on the last-named's frequency). BBC Radio Scotland discontinued the role of dedicated announcers around 2008. Promotional content is included within programmes, while news bulletins are read by Broadcast Journalists. Announcing staff for BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Wales double as newsreaders and technical operators.\nContinuity announcements for BBC television channels are broadcast from Red Bee Media at the White City Media Village in West London, with separate continuity teams for the nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland based in the broadcasting centres in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow, providing links for the local variations of BBC One and BBC Two, as well as the BBC Scotland channel.\nCBBC and CBeebies continuity now airs from studios at MediaCityUK in Salford Quays&nbsp;– up until September 2011, CBBC presentation was broadcast from a small studio in the East Tower of BBC Television Centre while CBeebies presentation was also live at Teddington Studios. The announcing team for BBC Radio 4 work from a suite of studios on the 7th floor of Broadcasting House in London.\nHistorically, BBC announcers mostly spoke with Received Pronunciation, but the range of accents heard has widened considerably in recent years, and the general tone has become more informal.\nIn-vision continuity\nEarly continuity\nAndrew Martin, an expert from the BBC archives, described continuity announcements as \"an essential part of television,\" which \"actually tell us quite a lot about the style, the kind of attitudes of television in their particular era.\"\nIn-vision continuity announcers, who appeared on screen between programmes, were a staple part of television broadcasts from the very earliest days of television, because \"there was a need for linking material between programmes just to kind of announce them.\" In the early days of television, it was almost like a variety bill in the theatre... [and when] an item would come on, somebody had to say what it was often listing an entire evening's up-coming programming in one link.\nThe early announcers became \"celebrities in their own right,\" often receiving considerable amounts of fan mail, as they were among the most recognisable on-screen individuals, appearing every day, at the start of an era when television celebrity began. Early in-vision announcers included Elizabeth Cowell, Leslie Mitchell, formerly a newsreel announcer, and Jasmine Bligh, who re-opened the television service in 1946. The early continuity announcers were auditioned, as \"they had to look good but they also had to speak well\", as clear speaking was crucial to their role.\nLater continuity\nIt is believed that in-vision continuity was last used during the peak viewing hours on BBC TV in the early 1960s, with a link into the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 the last-known example of the corporation's use of in-vision continuity (as well as existing out-of-vision continuity) across the national network.\nBetween the late 1960s and circa 1980, many of the BBC's English regions provided their own continuity on weekday evenings, including in-vision presentation&nbsp;– particularly at closedown. Regional in-vision continuity was still used by BBC South in Southampton, BBC Midlands in Birmingham and BBC North West in Manchester by the time English regional continuity was phased out. From 1998 to 2001, the Northern Ireland regional service on BBC Choice used in-vision continuity links.\nChildren's continuity\nThe presentation of children's programmes had in-vision continuity from its instigation until 1965. The best-known children's in-vision continuity face was that of schoolgirl Jennifer Gay, one of the Children's Hour announcers, who introduced such favourites as Muffin the Mule between 1949 and 1953.\nIn-vision continuity was re-introduced as part of Children's BBC/CBBC) on 9 September 1985. From then until 1994, this came from the main BBC1 continuity suite itself, referred to as \"the broom cupboard\" and introduced by various presenters including Andy Crane, Andi Peters and Phillip Schofield; Since then, it has come from larger, specialised studios. Children's BBC Scotland used in-vision continuity from 1992–1996, but this was omitted in favour of out-of-vision continuity from 1997–2000. As of September 2011, presentation for both CBBC and CBeebies originates from the BBC's MediaCityUK studios in Salford Quays, following the BBC Children's department move from London.\nModern continuity\nIn February 2008, BBC Three introduced in-vision continuity links, in the form of live links with presenter Jose Vanders and recorded links with BBC Three viewers. For a time, the BBC Three website offered viewers the opportunity to record links for programmes. The live in-vision links were dropped after only a few months although live out-of-vision continuity during peak time returned in September 2011.\nOn 19 September 2008, the Scottish Gaelic-language digital channel BBC Alba launched with in-vision continuity from the channel's sole announcer, Fiona MacKenzie. A second in-vision announcer, Moira MacDonald, was appointed in July 2009. All continuity links are live in Stornoway and transmitted from BBC Scotland's headquarters in Glasgow.\nITV\nAll announcements for ITV plc-owned stations on ITV1, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4  and ITVBe originate from the company's main transmission facilities at Technicolor in Chiswick, Greater London. CITV was the only ITV channel not to use continuity announcers until its closure in August/September 2023.\nA separate team of announcers for the separately-owned STV is based at the company's headquarters in Pacific Quay, Glasgow.\nMost announcements broadcast on ITV1 are conducted live, as well as overnight announcements, regional opt-out continuity and links for ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4. All of ITV plc's announcers work on a freelance basis.\nSTV uses live continuity during the evening (between around 5pm and midnight) with daytime announcements pre-recorded by the duty prime time announcer during their shift. STV-branded presentation is used throughout the station's broadcast hours with transmission operated and overseen by technical staff in Glasgow 24 hours a day.\nThe consolidation of ITV companies during the 1990s and 2000s led to the closure of transmission and continuity facilities at some ITV company studios:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!ITV region\n!ITV company at time of last known announcement\n!Date of last known announcement\n|-\n| The Borders\n| Border Television\n| Late 1999/early 2000 (regional continuity moved to Yorkshire Television in Leeds)\n|-\n| Central Scotland\n| Scottish Television\n| Still has regional continuity (also heard in Northern Scotland)\n|-\n| Channel Islands\n| Channel Television\n| 28 October 2002 (switched to network continuity from The London Studios)\n|-\n| East of England\n| Anglia Television\n| Circa 2000 (regional continuity moved to Meridian Broadcasting in Southampton)\n|-\n| London\n| ITV London (Carlton/London Weekend Television)\n| Still has regional continuity (now networked on ITV)\n|-\n| Midlands\n| Central Independent Television\n| 28 October 2002 (regional continuity moved to The London Studios).Transmission moved to Yorkshire Television in Leeds in 2004.\n|-\n| North Scotland\n| Grampian Television\n| July 1998 (regional continuity moved to STV in Glasgow)\n|-\n| North East England\n| Tyne Tees Television\n| 16 March 1996 (regional continuity moved to Yorkshire Television in Leeds).Transmission moved to Leeds in early September 1993 (probably 4 September);All non-live presentation fed from Leeds starting 1 January 1993.\n|-\n| North West England\n| Granada Television\n| 1998 (regional continuity moved to Yorkshire Television in Leeds)\n|-\n| Northern Ireland\n| UTV\n| 2 April 2020 (playout moved to Chiswick on 17 October 2016)\n|-\n| South and South East\n| Meridian Broadcasting\n| 28 October 2002 (regional continuity moved to The London Studios).\n|-\n| Wales and West\n| HTV Wales/HTV West\n| 15 January 2006 in Wales (regional continuity moved to The London Studios),2000 in the West (regional continuity moved to Meridian Broadcasting in Southampton)\n|-\n| South West England\n| Westcountry Television\n| 28 October 2002 (playout controlled from HTV in Cardiff - presentation moved to The London Studios in November 2002)\n|-\n| Yorkshire and Lincolnshire\n| Yorkshire Television\n| 28 October 2002 (regional continuity moved to The London Studios)\n|}\nIn-vision continuity\nThe use of on screen continuity announcers was common on ITV when each region was run by an independent company with their own transmission and continuity facilities. During the 1980s and 1990s, many regional companies abandoned the use of in-vision continuity announcers:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! ITV region\n!

This decision was reversed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, following Sidney Bernstein's retirement.\nChannel 4\nChannel 4 employs continuity announcers on its network of stations; 4seven, Channel 4, E4, Film4 and More4.
