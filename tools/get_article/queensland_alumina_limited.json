In 1981 the output was at a quarterly basis over 600,000 tonnes per quarter.\nAt times of lower demand, operations have been altered. Subsequent rises in demand have seen expansion in output and employment.\nQAL has been operated by a range of consortium partners of international aluminium producers over time. Comalco brought in to the consortium in 1969. In 1982 it was owned Comalco (30.3%), Kaiser Aluminum (28.3%), Alcan (21.4%), and Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann (20%).\nSince April 2005, it has been owned by Rio Tinto Alcan (80%) and Rusal (20%). In September 2017 the QAL celebrated 50 years of operation.\nSee also\n*List of alumina refineries\nReferences\nExternal links"
