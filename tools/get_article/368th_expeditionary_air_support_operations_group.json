The group trained and equipped tactical air support squadrons and tactical air control parties to control aircraft and communications systems in support of surface forces including tactical air strikes, reconnaissance and airlift. It was inactivated in 1974 and its mission transferred to the 507th Tactical Air Control Wing, which combined tactical control and tactical air support units for Ninth Air Force.\nExpeditionary unit\nDuring Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn it was located at an undisclosed location in Iraq (possibly Joint Base Balad). It supported Multi-National Corps - Iraq.
