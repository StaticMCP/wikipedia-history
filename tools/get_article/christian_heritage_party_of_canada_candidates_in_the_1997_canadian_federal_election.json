He first campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1993 federal election, and finished fifth against Reform candidate Jake Hoeppner with 399 votes in Lisgar—Marquette.\nHe received 517 votes (1.53%) in the 1997 election, again placing fifth against Hoeppner.\nA Martin Dewit has been credited by the Carman Fire Department for playing the character \"Sparks the Clown\" in instructional lessons for children.[http://www.firecomm.gov.mb.ca/docs/burning_issues_winter2003.pdf]  This is presumably the same person.  As of 2005, there is a Martin Dewit Auctioneering Company in Carman.\nPaul Kalyniuk (Selkirk—Interlake)\nKalyniuk was a bus driver for Winnipeg Transit.  He wrote a letter to the Winnipeg Free Press during the 1993 federal election, supporting the Christian Heritage Party and suggesting that party leader Heather Stilwell be including in the federal party leaders' debate.  In 1997, he received 363 votes (0.94%) to finish fifth against Reform Party candidate Howard Hilstrom.\nIn 1999, Kalyniuk complained that his tax dollars went toward services he disapproved of, including abortion, gender-affirming surgery, and NATO's military actions in Kosovo.  Two years later, he criticized efforts to promote judicial lenience for Robert Latimer, a Saskatchewan man who was found guilty of murdering his severely handicapped daughter in what some described as a mercy killing.\nOther candidates (detailed entry not prepared)\n* Colin George Atkins (Brandon-Souris, Manitoba) (multiple elections)\n* Angela M.
