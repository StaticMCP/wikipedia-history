As growth and development in Los Angeles threatened the city's historic landmarks, the committee sought to implement a formal preservation program in cooperation with local civic, cultural and business organizations and municipal leaders. On April 30, 1962, a historic preservation ordinance proposed by the AIA committee was passed.\nThe original Cultural Heritage Board (later renamed a commission) was formed in the summer of 1962, consisting of William Woollett, FAIA, Bonnie H. Riedel, Carl S. Dentzel, Senaida Sullivan and Edith Gibbs Vaughan.\nThe board met for the first time in August 1962, at a time when the owner of the historic Leonis Adobe was attempting to demolish the structure and replace it with a supermarket.  In its first day of official business, the board designated the Leonis Adobe and four other sites as Historic-Cultural Monuments.\nIn the commission's first decade of operation (August 1962–August 1972), it designated 101 properties as Historic-Cultural Monuments. By April 2018, there were over 1150 designated properties.\nProcess\nThe designation of a property as a Historic-Cultural Monument does not prevent demolition or alteration. However, the designation requires permits for demolition or substantial alteration to be presented to the commission. The commission has the power to delay the demolition of a designated property for up to one year.\nNotable monuments\nFile:Leonis Adobe, Calabasas (2008).JPG|Leonis Adobe (HCM #1)\nFile:BoltonHall Tujunga April2008.JPG|Bolton Hall (HCM #2)\nFile:Eastern Columbia Tower - Los Angeles.jpg|Eastern Columbia Building (HCM #294)\nFile:Westminster Presbyterian Church Los Angeles.jpg|Westminster Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles) (HCM #299)\nFile:CBS ColumbiaSquare01.jpg|CBS Columbia Square Studios (HCM #947)\nDesignated LAHCM outside the City of Los Angeles\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!  width=1% | HCM #\n!  width=\"18%\" |Landmark name\n!  width=\"11%\" |Image\n!  width=\"4%\"  |Date designated\n!  width=\"12%\" |Locality\n!  width=\"12%\" |Area\n!  width=\"41%\" |Description\n|-\n| |160\n| Manzanar\n| 100x100px\n|\n| Highway 395\n| Inyo County, California\n| Japanese American internment site, World War II.
