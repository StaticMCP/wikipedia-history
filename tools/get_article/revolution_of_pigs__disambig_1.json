Fueled by a great soundtrack of classic ‘80s pop, the revolution is brewing. Set in the summer of 1986, hundreds of teenagers have gathered in the woods for Estonian student summer camp—three days full of adventures, falling in love and partying. But, when the teens are forced to comply with rules of proper behavior, camp in a totalitarian system is not all it is cracked up to be. The political metaphor of the counselors’ control leads to an uprising of the students. The main character is 16-year-old Tanel, who initially is as focused on losing his virginity and getting drunk as overthrowing the system. But taking part in the revolt, he discovers himself.\nCast\n*Jass Seljamaa - Tanel\n*Evelin Kuusik - Diana\n*Lilian Alto - Päike\n*Uku Uusberg - Urmas\n*Vadim Albrant - Futu\n*Mikk Tammepõld- Erki\n*Merle Liivak - Mariann\n*Merli Rosar - Juta\n*Tarvo Kaspar Toome - Punk rocker Timo\n*Martin Mill - Ats\n*Anu Saagim - Meierei\n*Peeter Tammearu - Erki's father\n*Tõnu Tepandi - Komandör\n*Tõnu Oja - Operator\n*Anne Paluver - Staabi mutt\n*Arvo Kukumägi - Vuntsidega Komandör\n*Üllar Saaremäe - Commander of Hundissaare\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n(For film that could show the past but represent the future)}}"
