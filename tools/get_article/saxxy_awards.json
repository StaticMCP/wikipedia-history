The first competition was held in 2011 and included 20 competition categories. In 2012, the number of categories was limited to five, and the contestants are required to use Valve's Source Filmmaker software to create their animations.\nEach year, winners receive an in-game melee weapon for Team Fortress 2 named a [https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Saxxy Saxxy]; designed and named after the character [https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Saxton_Hale Saxton Hale], who was the namesake for the awards. The item resembles an Academy Award. The winner of the 2012 'Best Overall' category was flown to Valve in Bellevue, Washington for a filmmaking session with the company's very own filmmakers, which became a tradition for each of the following years' Saxxy Awards. There have been 26 Saxxy Awards given out to winners since 2012. After 2017, Valve has not held another Saxxy Awards competition, and currently have not said anything about the competition. This has led fans and SFM artists to create the Community Saxxy Awards in 2021 as a response to Valve's inaction.\nCompetition\nOriginally, the Saxxy Awards encouraged fans of Team Fortress 2 to create machinima (video game-based films) based around the video game; the competition has since expanded to include other video games. Valve released the Source Filmmaker software before the second competition, which allowed users to animate their own videos using Valve's video game assets, including models, dialogue, sound effects, and particle systems. Winners are decided by public polling and a Valve jury, allowing voters to thumbs-up or thumbs-down entrants through the Steam online platform during voting periods.\n2012 Awards\nThe 2012 Saxxy Awards were announced by Valve in August 2012. Voting opened on November 16, 2012, and ran until November 27. The short voting period was because Valve planned to show the video that won in the Best Overall category at the Spike Video Game Awards on December 7. The 20 competition categories from the 2011 awards were reduced to five for 2012; Best Action, Best Replay, Best Comedy, Best Drama, and Best Overall. The 2011 competition required that all video content be based exclusively on replays from Team Fortress 2; however, the 2012 competition allowed content to be based on any of Valve's properties. The 2012 finalists received an item which was simply a video camera that is used as a melee weapon, while the winners each received the aforementioned Saxxy.\nThe winners were announced on November 30, but the winner of the Best Overall category was not revealed until the Spike Video Game Awards ceremony. Winners received a golden statue of the game's character Saxton Hale, and the Best Overall winner was given a trip to Valve Headquarters to meet the team that created the Source Filmmaker tool.\n2012 winners:\n* Best Overall: Story of a Sentry\n* Best Action: Meet the Dumpster Diver\n* Best Comedy: The Wishmaker\n* Best Drama: Bad Medicine\n* Best Replay: EPIC High Five Fail\n2013 Awards\nThe 2013 Saxxy Awards were announced on October 2, 2013, with entries being accepted from November 11 through November 18.
