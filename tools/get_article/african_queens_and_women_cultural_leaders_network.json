The Network was established in response to the 2012 \"Harare Call to Action\" at a meeting hosted by the GlobalPower Women Network Africa, which sought to establish meaningful networks with religious, traditional and cultural leaders in the implementation of programs to protect and promote the rights of women and girls in the African Union. The launch was hosted by Queen Sylvia Nagindda of Buganda Kingdom and Queen Best Kemigisa, the Queenmother of Tooro Kingdom.\nThe network has chapters in various African countries including Ghana, Uganda, and Malawi.\nCommitments\nThe AQWCLN has resolved to eradicate negative cultural practices, especially female genital mutilation and early marriages. They have issued calls for the release of the victims of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping as well as other girls kidnapped by Boko Haram.\nNotable members\n* Queen Sylvia of Buganda\n* Queen Best Kemigisa\n* Nana Adwoa Awindor\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  (Facebook)"
