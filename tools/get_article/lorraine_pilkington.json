She trained at the Gaiety School of Acting.\nCareer\nPilkington began her acting career at the age of 15 when she appeared in The Miracle directed by Neil Jordan. She appeared onstage in the plays The Plough and the Stars and The Iceman Cometh. At age 18 she moved to London where she was given a part in a Miramax film which eventually fell through after a meeting with Harvey Weinstein. She later returned to Dublin, living in Ballsbridge for a time.\nAfter a period involving substantial voiceover work, she moved back to London in the late 1990s, with the self-described aim of relaunching her career. Pilkington subsequently appeared in films including Human Traffic and My Kingdom, a retelling of King Lear. In 1999, she was cast as Katrina Finlay, a schoolteacher in a Scottish village, a major role in the BBC television series Monarch of the Glen, which was broadcast from 2000. After leaving the show at the beginning of the third season, she appeared in various other television productions such as Rough Diamond and Outnumbered.\nIn 2008, she appeared in a short film by Luke Massey Within the Woods, with James Chalmers.
