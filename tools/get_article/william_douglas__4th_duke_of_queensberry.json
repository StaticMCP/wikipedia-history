He was popularly known as Old Q (because that letter was painted on his carriage's door) and was reputed as a high-stakes gambler. In 1799 he was estimated the eighth-wealthiest man (or small family unit) in Britain, owning £1M (). He is one of ten known British millionaires that year, the royal family excluded.\nFamily and royal appointee\nBorn in Peebles, Queensberry was the only son of William Douglas, 2nd Earl of March, and his wife, Lady Anne Hamilton. He was great-grandson of the 1st Duke.\nA friend of the Prince of Wales, the future George III, Douglas was appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to him when he became king in 1760. He was appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1761 and was one of the 16 Scottish representative peers for an elected term or possibly more from 1761, and was Vice Admiral of Scotland from 1767 to 1776. However, due to behavior during the king's unusual, long-lasting, mental health latter-life illness he was deprived of his office as Gentleman of the Bedchamber in 1789, and for a while took refuge abroad. Later, he was Lord Lieutenant of Dumfries from 1794 until 1810.\nHe succeeded his father in the Earldom of March in 1731 and his mother in the Earldom of Ruglen in 1748. He succeeded his cousin Charles as Duke of Queensberry in 1778, and was created Lord Douglas, Baron Douglas, of Amesbury in the County of Wiltshire in the Peerage of Great Britain on 8 August 1786.\nIn 1799 he was estimated the eighth-wealthiest man (or small family unit) in Britain, owning £1M (). He was one of ten known British millionaires in 1799.\nHe developed a strong passion for Miss Frances Pelham at the age of 28, so much so that he deliberately bought a house next door to her and had a bow window built so that he could sit and spy on her as she came and went. In his 60s he proposed to the teenage daughter of his next-door neighbour in Piccadilly on three occasions, but was turned down despite his immense wealth.\nQueensberry never married. He had a daughter, Maria \"Mie-Mie\" Fagnani, by a mistress, the Marchesa Fagnani. In 1798, she became the wife of the 3rd Marquess of Hertford; Queensberry left much of his wealth to Maria, and left £10,000 to Lady Anne Hamilton who was a Lady in Waiting to Caroline of Brunswick. He was interred at St James's Church, Piccadilly on 31 December 1810.\nOn his death, the dukedom and Drumlanrig Castle passed to his second cousin once removed, the third Duke of Buccleuch. The Marquessate of Queensberry passed to his fourth cousin once removed (and also third once removed) Sir Charles Douglas, 5th Bt, whose descendant is the current titleholder. His second cousin twice removed Francis Douglas, 8th Earl of Wemyss became Earl of Wemyss and March. The Earldom of Ruglen became extinct.\nHorseracing\nHe was a racehorse owner and event attendee. His jockeys' racing silks were deep red with a black cap. He had some society repute as a high-stakes gambler.\nSemi-fictional portrayal\nAs \"Lord March\", he is briefly portrayed or described in William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Virginians as a dissolute gambler.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.jjfox.co.uk/static/19%20St%20James/queensbury.htm Queensberry in St James's, London]\n*[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp03685&rNo=0&role=sit Portrait by Opie in National Portrait Gallery]\n*[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp03685&rNo=3&role=sit Caricature by James Gillray in National Portrait Gallery]\n*[http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/DouglasWilliamthirdEarlofMarchandfourthDukeofQueensberry151OldQ15117241511810.296.shtml Article in the Burns Encyclopedia]"
