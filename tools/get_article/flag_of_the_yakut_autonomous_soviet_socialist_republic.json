The flag is identical to the flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.\nDuring the Korenizatsiya period, most of the autonomous republics of the USSR, including Yakut ASSR, were encouraged to create a flag to suit their national tradition. Yakutia itself adopted a flag which depicted Aurora on its canton during this period.\nAfter 1937, the korenizatsiya policies were reversed. A new flag of the Yakut ASSR, which is similar to the flag of the Russian SFSR was adopted. The flag of Yakut ASSR is now a red flag with the inscriptions of the name of the republic.\nHistory\nThe first constitution of the Yakut ASSR was adopted by the 2nd session of the Central Executive Committee of the Yakut ASSR, on the third convocation, on 23 March 1925.

The flag is described in Article 109 of the constitution :\n}}\nThird version\nOn March 23, 1939, a new alphabet for the Yakut language was approved by a decree of the People's Commissar of Education of the Soviet Union. The inscription on the flag was changed into the new Cyrillic alphabet, and the inscription \"АССР\" was written once, due to both language having the same abbreviation.\nFourth version\nOn June 12, 1954, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Yakut ASSR \"On the State Flag of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\", a new state flag of the Yakut ASSR was adopted, which was approved by the Law of the Yakut ASSR of June 23, 1954.

The regulation established the exact proportions and design of the flag.\nOn February 28, 1956, the Council of Ministers of the Yakut ASSR issued an instruction for the application of the Regulations on the State Flag of the Yakut ASSR.\nFifth version\nA new constitution of the Yakut ASSR was adopted by the 8th extraordinary session of the Supreme Council of the Yakut ASSR on May 31, 1978.
