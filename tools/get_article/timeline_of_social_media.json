Major launches, milestones, and other major events are included.\nOverview\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Decade\n!Description\n|-\n|1970s–1980s\n|The PLATO system (developed at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation) offers early forms of social media with Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowd-sourced online newspaper, and blog; and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a notes file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea of Usenet in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, and it was established in 1980.\n|-\n|1980s–1990s\n|As operating systems with a graphical user interface, such as Windows and Mac OS, begin to emerge and gain popularity, this creates an environment that allows for early social media platforms to thrive and exist.\nBulletin board systems (BBS) and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) were popular during this time period, and IRC is still widely used today. The WELL, established in 1985, is one of the oldest still-operating online communities. Its name is an acronym for \"The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link\", coined by Stewart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog.\n|-\n|1990s–2000s\n|Various notable social media platforms such as Myspace and Facebook are developed and released, and blogging begins to gain popularity. Instant messaging platforms such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and Windows Live Messenger also become increasingly popular.\n|-\n|2010s\n|Many social media platforms that have remained are now thriving, and new ones are appearing sporadically. This includes popular blogs, instant messaging servers, and various social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Twitter.\nWith advances in smartphone technology, almost all social media services now have their own mobile apps.\n|-\n|2020s\n|The majority of users of social media services now prefer using mobile apps, with apps such as TikTok, Instagram, Threads (launched in 2023), and X (formerly known as Twitter) garnering and maintaining hundreds of millions of active users daily. Most well-established platforms (and influencers) focus on optimizing for engagement, algorithmic personalization, and maximizing revenue through targeted advertising.\n|}\nTimeline\nAn asterisk (*) indicates relaunches.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Event type\n!Description\n|-\n|1973\n|Invention\n|Talkomatic is created by Dave Woolley and Douglas Brown at the University of Illinois, as a multi-user chat room application. It is an instant sensation among users in the PLATO System's online community.\n|-\n|1973\n|Invention\n|TERM-Talk is created by the staff at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois, as an instant-messaging application enabling any two users on the PLATO system to conduct a live, character-by-character typed conversation on the bottom of the screen of their PLTO terminals. Soon many features would be added to it including \"Monitor Mode,\" enabling one user in the TERM-talk to share their own screen with the other user, to ask questions or point out something that they're seeing. Years later this concept would be introduced as \"Screen Sharing\" or Remote Desktop Software.\n|-\n|1973\n|Invention\n|PLATO Notes is created by 17-year-old student Dave Woolley at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois, as a conferencing and bulletin board forum system for communicating with the user community. In 1976, Notes expanded to enable any user to create a \"notesfile\" on any subject. PLATO Notes would serve as the inspiration for Lotus Notes developed by former PLATO users Ray Ozzie, Len Kawell, and Tim Halvorsen.\n|-\n|1974\n|Invention\n|ARPANET evolved into the Internet following the publication of the first Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification,  (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine.\n|-\n|circa 1980\n|Milestone\n| Bulletin Board System (BBS) emerges as one of the earliest known forms of social media, and remains popular and under development until the late 1990s.\n|-\n|1984\n|Invention\n|FidoNet forms as BBSs start to exchange email in North America and later internationally.\n|-\n|1988\n|Invention\n|IRC rises from the roots of BBS (and was initially intended to extend it), offering a similar service and experience.
