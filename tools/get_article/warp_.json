The three parts were My Battlefield My Body, Unleashed! Unchained! and To Die Alive!.\nThe play of Part I (My Battlefield My Body) moved to Broadway under the name Warp! for an unsuccessful short run in February 1973.\nIn 1979, the Organic Theatre Company mounted productions of all three plays, each part requiring separate admission, and each with its own Playbill program.\nThese plays were then performed in 1980 at the Mixed Blood Theater in Minneapolis, MN, where, on closing night all three parts were performed in succession, and props and other items from the play were offered for sale, including a few signed copies of the script.\nThe plays and their  backstories became the basis for spinoff comic books and other media.\nSynopsis\nDavid Carson, an everyday bank teller, learns that he is Lord Cumulus, \"avenger of the universe\". Suddenly transported from an annual employee-awards dinner to the mystical realm Fen-Ra, he finds himself battling for the destiny of the universe against antagonist Prince Chaos. In this world, he encounters the sage Lugulbanda, who sends him on his quest aided by the leather-clad Amazon warrior Sargon. They battle Valaria the insect sorceress and Chaos' henchman, the purple ape Symax.\nProduction history\nOriginal production\nChicago's Organic Theater Company opened the original play Warp! in 1971. Co-author Stuart Gordon in 2002 recalled its original inspiration: \"It was three full-length plays that were inspired by Marvel Comics. ... Well, we weren't able to get the rights to any of the characters from Marvel, so we created our own. But I would say that Warp was very influenced by comic books like Dr. Strange and Thor\". Billed by the company as \"the world's first science fiction epic-adventure play in serial form\", it was performed for over a year before moving to Broadway.\nThe Chicago cast included John Heard, André De Shields, Cecil O'Neal, J. Pat Miller, and Bruce A. Young. The costume designer was first-timer Cookie Gluck, a former art major at the University of Wisconsin who was married to actor O'Neal. The lighting designer was David K. H. Elliott.\nThe Chicago non-profit organization Videopolis videotaped the original production.\nMove to Broadway\nThe production moved to New York City's Ambassador Theatre on Broadway, where part one of the trilogy, My Battlefield, My Body, ran seven previews beginning January 31, 1973, and eight performances from February 14–18, 1973. It marked the Broadway debut of John Heard, who played David Carson/Lord Cumulus. Other cast-members included Tom Towles as Prince Chaos, and Keith Szarabajka as the young David.\nThe Broadway production was produced by Anthony D'Amato in association with the Organic Theatre Company, and directed by co-writer Stuart Gordon. Comic-book and commercial artist Neal Adams was art director, with scenic design by Robert Guerra, costume design by Laura Crow and Cookie Gluck; lighting design by Jane Reisman and Neil Peter Jampolis; and visuals by Khamphalous Lightshow. William J. Norris and Richard Fire provided incidental music, with the latter also providing vocal sound effects. Frank Marino and Lynne Guerra were stage managers.\nBroadway cast\nThe opening-night cast:\n*André De Shields ... Desi Arnez\n*Cordis Fejer ... Penny Smart; Sargon\n*Jane Fire ... Sheila Fantastik\n*Richard Fire ... Mrs. O'Grady; psychiatric director; bank teller; Lugulbanda; Yggthion\n*Carolyn Gordon ... Mary Louise; Valaria\n*John Heard ... David Carson; Lord Cumulus\n*William J. Norris ... Bank president; Dr. Victor Vivian; Symax\n*Keith Szarabajka ... Attendant; young David Carson\n*Tom Towles ... Janitor; Prince Chaos\nCritical reception\nClive Barnes of The New York Times said in terms of fidelity comics: \"The look of the show is extremely accurate. The costumes &mdash; minimal and exotic &mdash; the outlandish props and the serviceably suggestive permanent setting are all perfectly in accord. The language is heightened melodrama having the same fleeting relationship to literature that bubble gum has to food\". Although he criticized the show having no story but only action, he admired the acting. He allowed that \"for comic-book addicts ... Warp might well be a lot of fun. Others are warned that, while it is undeniably cleverly done, it is at heart a one-joke evening\".\nAwards\n.]]\n* Laura Crow, Cookie Gluck: 1973 Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Costume Design\n* David K.H.
