In 1858/59 he became a partner in the family glassworks.\nIn 1863 he married Louisa Sinclair and in 1885 he bought the Rainford Hall estate, commissioning James Medland Taylor to build a new house. The building is in the Jacobethan style, of red brick with sandstone dressings.\nHe became a member of St Helens Borough Council, holding the office of mayor in 1881, 1896, 1897 and 1898. By this time he held the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in the Volunteer Force and commanded a battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment.\nIn December 1898 he was selected as the Conservative candidate for a by-election in the Newton constituency. He had previously been considered a Liberal Unionist. As the only candidate nominated he was elected unopposed on 16 January 1899.\nPilkington held his seat at the subsequent general election in 1900, but was defeated in 1906 by a Labour candidate.\nRichard Pilkington died on 12 March 1908, aged 67. A condition in his will forbade the inheritors of his estate from permitting the construction or use of any building for the sale of intoxicating liquor.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
