He previously successfully ran for president in 2000, 2004, 2012 and 2018.\nAccording to Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov, \"Putin's campaign will not differ from his usual work. Putin's work schedule is full of events, so he does not have much time to hold election events.\"\nBackground\nPutin was initially elected president of Russia in 2000 and re-elected in 2004. In 2008, due to the two-term limit provided for by the constitution, Putin could no longer run for president and did not participate in the elections. President Dmitry Medvedev, who was elected in the 2008 election, appointed Vladimir Putin as his prime minister.\nIn 2012, President Dmitry Medvedev refused to run for a second term and supported Vladimir Putin. Putin was elected president again in 2012 and re-elected in 2018.\nInitially, Putin could not run for president in 2024 due to the current term limit, but constitutional reform took place in 2020. The constitutional reform established a hard limit of two terms overall. However, terms served before the constitutional revision were not counted, which gives Vladimir Putin eligibility for two more presidential terms.\nAnnouncement\n, during which he announced his intention to run for president again]]\nIn the second half of 2023, there were rumors about the date of Vladimir Putin's announcement of his participation in the election.\nInitially, it was assumed that Putin could announce his candidacy at the \"Russia\" international exhibition, which opened on 4 November 2023, on National Unity Day. However, Putin did not announce his presidential candidacy during a visit to the exhibition.\nVladimir Putin announced his intention to be re-elected president on 8 December 2023, after the completion of the award ceremony for the Russian military on the occasion of Heroes of the Fatherland Day. Putin announced his candidacy not during a public speech, but during a conversation with some guests. Putin announced his participation in the election in response to a question from the speaker of the Donetsk People's Republic parliament, Artyom Zhoga.\nNomination\ncongress]]\nOn 9 December 2023, a meeting of the All-Russian People's Front was held on the issue of Vladimir Putin's nomination as a presidential candidate. During the meeting, an initiative group was formed to nominate Putin as a presidential candidate.\nOn 16 December 2023, a meeting of the initiator group officially nominated Vladimir Putin as a presidential candidate took place in Zaryadye Park, Moscow. Since Putin is running as an independent candidate this means that in order to be included in the ballot, Putin will need to collect at least 300,000 signatures of Russian citizens in his support.\nDespite Vladimir Putin's participation in the elections as an independent candidate, his nomination was supported by a number of political parties. In particular, the United Russia and A Just Russia - For Truth parties officially endorsed Putin's candidacy at their congresses held on December 17 and 23, respectively. In addition, the leadership of a number of political parties also decided to approve Putin's candidacy, without holding congresses. In particular, this decision was made by the Presidium of the Central Council of the Russian Party of Pensioners for Social Justice and by the Federal Council of the Party of Business.\nCampaign\nCollecting signatures\nSince Vladimir Putin was running as an independent candidate, in order to be included in the ballot, laws required him to needed to collect 300,000 signatures of Russian citizens in his support. On 23 December 2023, the collection of signatures in support of Putin's presidential nomination started.\nSignatures were collected by volunteers of the All-Russian People's Front at the headquarters of the movement. In addition, the United Russia and A Just Russia - For Truth parties that endorsed Putin's candidacy are involved in collecting signatures.\nOn 30 December 2023, the press service of the headquarters announced that more than 500,000 signatures had been collected across the country in support of Vladimir Putin. Thus, Putin managed to collect the necessary number of signatures for inclusion in the ballot in one week. At the same time, despite reaching the required number, the collection of signatures was not stopped. On 4 January 2024, United Russia Secretary General Andrey Turchak announced an increase in the number of signature collectors. According to him, this decision is connected with a large number of Russian citizens who want to sign in support of Putin.\nOn 16 January 2024, the United Russia party held their so-called single day of collecting signatures in support of Vladimir Putin. As part of a single day of collecting signatures, the party organized the work of about 20 thousand volunteers at the headquarters of public support for Putin, public reception rooms of the party chairman, regional and local executive committees of the party, at the headquarters of the Young Guard of United Russia.\nOn 17 January 2024, Putin's headquarters announced that more than 2.5 million signatures had been collected.\nOn 22 January 2024, Putin's headquarters submitted 315 thousand signatures of voters to the Central Election Commission. Of the 315,000 voter signatures submitted, 91 were declared invalid, which is 0.03%, with a maximum allowable 5%. On January 29, the CEC registered Putin as a presidential candidate.\nTrips\nVladimir Putin has not officially announced plans to make campaign trips, unlike other candidates. In January 2024, Putin began making trips to the regions, which at the same time were of a presidential working nature and were not positioned as campaign. As part of his trips, Putin held working meetings with regional governors.\nOn January 10, Putin visited Anadyr, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Far East. This trip was Putin's first visit to Chukotka, during his entire tenure. During the trip, Putin met with local residents and visited a greenhouse complex. The next day, Putin visited another Far Eastern region, the Khabarovsk Krai, where he met with local entrepreneurs and discussed issues of the Russian economy.\nSubsequently, in January and February 2024, Putin made working trips to Kaliningrad Oblast, St. Petersburg and Tula Oblast.\nCampaign organizations\nOn 21 December 2023, Vladimir Putin's federal election headquarter opened in the Moscow Gostiny Dvor. As during the 2018 presidential campaign, Putin's campaign headquarters is led by three co-chairs, namely actor Vladimir Mashkov, speaker of the Parliament of the Donetsk People's Republic Artyom Zhoga and doctor Maryana Lysenko.\nAt the same time, according to media reports published before Putin's nomination, the co-chairs of the headquarters perform media functions. In fact, the company is headed by the Head of the Internal Policy Department of the Presidential Administration, Andrey Yarin, who holds the position of chief of staff at the headquarters.\nAt the same time as the federal headquarters, regional headquarters began to open throughout the country. Each regional headquarters is also headed by several co-chairs. Public figures and activists have been appointed to the positions of co-chairs in many regions.\nEndorsements\nA number of Russian officials at federal, regional and local levels and other notable
