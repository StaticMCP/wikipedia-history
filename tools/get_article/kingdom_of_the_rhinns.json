      "text": "# Kingdom of the Rhinns\n\n]]\n.The text refers to an event dated 1094, and reads in Irish , which translates into English as \"Congal's son, king of Na Renna, was slain\".]]\nNa Renna, or the Kingdom of the Rhinns, was a Norse-Gaelic lordship which appears in 11th century records. The Rhinns () was a province in Medieval Scotland, and comprised, along with Farines, the later Wigtownshire. The Martyrology of Óengus gives some idea of the kingdom's domain in the 11th century, as  (Dunragit) and  (Whithorn) are said to lie in the kingdom, implying that it embraced the whole of later Wigtownshire.\nList of known rulers\nThree rulers are explicitly stated in the sources to have ruled this kingdom:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"10%\" | Dates\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Styles\n! width=\"15%\" | Notes\n|-valign=top\n| d. 1034\n| (Óláf Sigtryggsson)\n| This was not Óláf's only kingdom; he was said by the Life of Gruffudd ap Cynan to have ruled \"Dublin, Mann, Galloway, the Rhinns, Anglesey and Gwynedd\".\n| Son of Sigtrygg Silkbeard.
