Diana is an American educator, politician and former County Executive of Orange County, New York. Prior to being elected County Executive, he served for twelve years as County Legislator. He resides in Wallkill, New York.\nPolitical career and background\nDiana was born in Middletown, New York and attended the local schools. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree from Southern Connecticut State University and a Masters of Education from Ithaca College.\nDiana was employed for 30 years as an educator and athletic instructor in the Minisink Valley School District. He was first elected in 1979 to the Wallkill Town Board and served there as a councilman and deputy supervisor until 1985. He was elected as a county legislator for the 18th district (parts of Middletown, Wallkill and Goshen) from 1986 to 1993 and 1998 to 2001. Diana held the position of majority leader for six years. Diana also owned and operated the downtown Middletown restaurant \"Diana’s\" which was started by grandparents in 1936.\nDiana was elected in 2001 by a wide margin to become the fifth County Executive of Orange County, replacing Joseph Rampe of Warwick who was retiring. He was reelected in landslides in 2005 and again in 2009. Due to health issues, Diana announced he would not seek re-election in 2013. He was succeeded by Steve Neuhaus.\nOn November 7, 2017, he was elected Supervisor of the Town of Wallkill. On November 4, 2019, Diana was defeated by Democratic challenger Frank DenDanto.\nHigher office aspirations\nThere had been speculation that Diana was being recruited by the National Republican Congressional Committee for a run against freshman incumbent John Hall in New York's 19th congressional district. Representing the second largest county in the district, Diana would have strong name recognition in the area which gave Hall his narrow victory in 2006. In January 2008, Diana officially ruled out a run against Hall, stating he would prefer to seek a third term as County Executive.\nFor the 2010 election season, Diana expressed interest in pursuing the post of Lieutenant Governor of New York on Rick Lazio's ticket. He has also expressed interest in running in the United States Senate special election in New York, 2010 against incumbent Kirsten Gillibrand.\nElectoral history\n}}\nPlea deal in corruption probe\nOn June 21, 2021, Diana pled guilty to charges related to an investigation of corruption on the Orange County Industrial Development Agency Board. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli and local officials announced the charges against Diana and two others, who were ordered to pay $1.2 million in restitution, in a scheme to defraud the Orange County IDA.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070903094058/http://www.co.orange.ny.us/orgMain.asp?storyID=424&sid= Orange County Executive's Office]"
