While the medal is known to have been instituted and awarded, no warrant has yet been traced.\nOrder of wear\nSince the Independence Medal was authorised for wear by one of the statutory forces which came to be part of the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994, it was accorded a position in the official South African order of precedence on that date.\n;Bophuthatswana Defence Force until 26 April 1994:\n*Official BDF order of precedence:\n** Preceded by the General Service Medal.\n** Succeeded by the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct, Gold.\n*Bophuthatswana official national order of precedence:\n** Preceded by the General Service Medal.\n** Succeeded by the Independence Police Medal.\n;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994:\n*Official SANDF order of precedence:\n** Preceded by the Independence Medal of the Republic of Transkei.\n** Succeeded by the Independence Medal of the Republic of Venda.\n*Official national order of precedence:\n** Preceded by the Independence Medal of the Republic of Transkei.\n** Succeeded by the Independence Police Medal of the Republic of Bophuthatswana.\nThe position of the Independence Medal in the order of precedence remained unchanged, as it was on 27 April 1994, when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted in April 1996 for the two former non-statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and again when a new series of military orders, decorations and medals was instituted in South Africa on 27 April 2003.\nDescription\n;Obverse\nThe Independence Medal is a gilt disk, 38 millimetres in diameter and 3 millimetres thick at the rim, displaying the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Bophuthatswana in colour on a white enameled background.\n;Reverse\nThe reverse shows the face of a leopard over the inscription \"6-12-77\", the date of Bophuthatswana's independence.\n;Ribbon\nThe ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with a 3 millimetres wide red band, an 8 millimetres wide cobalt blue band, a 4 millimetres wide dark yellow (cadmium) band, repeated in reverse order and separated by a 2 millimetres wide green band.
