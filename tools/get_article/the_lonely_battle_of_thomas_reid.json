Reid disputed this in court, saying that CPOs were not intended to be made with the intention of selling property to a specific private company. The case goes to the High Court and Supreme Court, with Reid winning in the end.\nInterspersed with reconstructions of the court cases are interviews with Reid, who lives alone in Hedsor, an 18th-century farmhouse that has been in the family for over 100 years, and depictions of his life on the farm.\nRelease\nThe Lonely Battle of Thomas Reid received its world premiere at the 2017 International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam.\nIt went on release in Ireland on 18 October 2018, and aired on Irish television on 1 July 2019.\nReception\nThe Lonely Battle of Thomas Reid has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 7 reviews.\nIrish Independent film reviewer Paul Whitington included the documentary among his 20 best films of 2018, while in The Herald, Chris Wasser described it as \"one of the most unique and, perhaps, indefinable pieces of cinema this year\" and \"occasionally, quite wonderful\".\nThe film won the George Morrison Feature Documentary Award at the 2018/19 Irish Film and Television Awards, and also won Best Documentary at the 2018 Irish Film Festival London. It was voted Best Irish Film at the 2018 Dublin International Film Festival.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
