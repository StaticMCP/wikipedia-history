Shirvan's former ally the Karabakh ruler Yar Ahmed Qaramanli sided with Qara Yusuf, while Ibrahim joined his forces with the ruler of Shaki, Syed Ahmed Orlat and King Constantine I of Georgia, who marched in the head of 2,000 Georgian cavalry to support the Shirvanese allies.\nA major battle was fought at the village Chalagan in December 1412 and ended in a decisive defeat of the allies. Ibrahim and Constantine fell at the hands of the fierce enemy. The Georgian king, his brother, and 300 Georgian officers were beheaded by the orders of Abu Nasr Qara Yusuf.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.karabakh.org/?id=3034&item=5: Kara Koyunlu]"
