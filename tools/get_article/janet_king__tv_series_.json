It was created as a spin-off from the 2011 legal drama Crownies. It follows the story of Senior Crown Prosecutor Janet King (Marta Dusseldorp), tracking her journey in Series 1 in the Department of Public Prosecutions to a Royal Commission into Serious Firearm Crime in Series 2 to the National Crime Commission in Series 3.\nVarious cast members who appeared alongside Dusseldorp in Crownies also appeared in Janet King. A number of new characters were also created. The show was commissioned for an eight part series and filming began in 2013. A second series aired from March 2016, and a third began in May 2017.\nProduction\nConception\nShortly before the final episode of the ABC1 legal drama Crownies was broadcast in November 2011, David Knox from TV Tonight reported that the series could continue in the form of a spin-off. The drama had suffered from modest ratings and mixed critical reviews during its 22-part run. ABC1 controller, Brendan Dahill explained \"Crownies won't be coming back as Crownies. But we are talking to (producers) Screentime about a spin-off. There are lots of things I love about Crownies and lots of things that were done brilliantly, and I'm really proud of Crownies. I'm genuinely surprised it didn't engage a bigger audience than it did. Genuinely surprised. But I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are plenty of brilliant things in it and we're talking to Screentime at the moment.\"\nDahill stated that the spin-off would not be season two of Crownies and that it would take the characters in different directions. He told Knox that there were certain elements of Crownies that worked well and he did not want to lose them because of poor ratings. He continued \"So what Screentime have come up with is a really great compromise that allows us to keep the best bits, and learn and move on.\" Knox added that a spin-off is rare in Australian television drama, but not unprecedented. On 20 August 2012, ABC TV confirmed that it had commissioned the Crownies spin-off, Janet King. The series was billed as an 8-part legal and political thriller. Janet King was produced by Karl Zwicky, Jane Allen and Lisa Scott, with Hilary Bonney acting as story consultant. Greg Haddrick, Jane Allen, Kris Mrksa and Shaun Grant wrote the series.\nDahill said he was excited about Janet King and the fresh new direction it would take. Carole Sklan, ABC's Head of Fiction, commented \"Screentime has developed an exciting drama series about the fabulous character, Janet King. The series looks at the dilemmas of a contemporary woman who returns to work after a year's maternity leave and is flung into a shocking prosecution that involves layers of intrigue played out at the highest levels of power. Janet King's case leads her through some astounding twists and revelations that impact on her life on every level.\" Screentime's Des Monaghan said that it had become clear to Screentime and the ABC that viewers had developed \"a great deal\" of affection for the character of Janet King and the cast of Crownies, so he was \"delighted\" that there would be a chance to build on that.\nOn 30 June 2015, it was announced that ABC had renewed Janet King for a second eight-part series. At the ASTRA Conference in September 2016, Dusseldorp confirmed four scripts for the third series had been written. The third series began airing from 25 May 2017, replacing Seven Types of Ambiguity. It focuses on organised crime in the sporting world, with Janet heading up a National Crime Commission investigation. Her former colleague Richard Stirling (Hamish Michael) is now a barrister for some of the athletes involved, while Owen Mitchell (Damian Walshe-Howling) has become the head of the DPP.\nCasting\nplays the titular character.]]\nAnthony Soegito from If Magazine revealed that Marta Dusseldorp would return as Janet King, while many of the characters that became established on Crownies would also make appearances.

Knox revealed that Vince Colosimo had been cast as Chief Superintendent Jack Rizzoli, while Damian Walshe-Howling was cast as Owen Mitchell, a rising star prosecutor. John Howard, Sonia Todd, Jessica Napier, Deborah Kennedy and Tiriel Mora also have roles in the series. Todd Lasance and Daniel Lissing did not reprise their respective roles as Ben McMahon and Conrad De Groot.\nJoining Dusseldorp as title character Janet King for series 2 include former Crownies originals; Hamish Michael (Richard Stirling), Andrea Demetriades (Lina Badir), Christopher Morris (Andy Campbell) and Peter Kowitz (Tony Gillies), as well as, Janet King season one cast members, Damian Walshe-Howling (Owen Mitchell) and Terry Serio (Terry Renner).

Foster attacks someone implied to be Richard in a public toilet.\n|LineColor       = B30E1C\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|ShortSummary    =  The body in the toilet turns out to be Flynn, his death made to look like an overdose. Foster is arrested after his DNA is found at the scene. Richard learns Darren's next target is Glen Farmer, a young tennis player who will be bribed to throw a set. Janet convinces him to talk Glen into it when Shannon fails and the police arrest the drug dealers Darren is working with, forcing him to rely on his laundered money to make bets so the NCC can track it. Janet gets Pearl into a sports scholarship but Bianca breaks up with her, realising she'll never be her priority. Darren and Shannon are arrested after an attempt to abduct Richard but Owen has ASIO agents shut down the NCC interrogation; Darren is needed to monitor international terrorist organisations radicalising Australian youths, with NCC only allowed to confiscate the profits from the betting scams and money laundering. Zoe dies of heart failure, probably caused by damage from taking performance-enhancing drugs. Janet has Foster make a statement about all the crimes Darren was involved in, predicting that one day his usefulness to ASIO will be over and he can be charged.\n|LineColor       = B30E1C\n}}\n|}\nReception\nBen Neutze from Crikey said that Janet was an \"audience favourite\" from Crownies. He also noted that Dusseldorp's acting profile had been raised following her appearance in A Place to Call Home. He predicted that the combination would secure success for the show and ABC. Ben Pobjie, writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, praised the series for trying \"to keep things varied and interesting. Most likely aware of the pitfalls of such a familiar genre, the show moves at a neat pace.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Recipients and nominees\n! scope=\"col\" |Result\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\"| AACTA Awards\n| Best Lead Actress in a Television Drama\n| Marta Dusseldorp\n|\n|-\n| Best Television Drama Series\n| Janet King\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Logie Awards\n| Most Outstanding Actress\n| Marta Dusseldorp\n|\n|-\n| Most Outstanding Drama Series\n| Janet King\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\"| AACTA Awards\n| Best Editing in Television\n| Nicole La Macchia\n|\n|-\n| Best Guest or Supporting Actor in a Television Drama\n| Hamish Michael\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2017\n| Logie Awards\n| Most Outstanding Actress\n| Marta Dusseldorp\n|\n|-\n| AWGIE Awards\n| Best Script for a Television Series or Miniseries\n| Greg Haddrick for \"Playing Advantage\"\n|\n|-\n|}\nHome media\nSeries 1 was released by ABC and Roadshow Entertainment on a three disc DVD (Region 4, PAL) on 18 April 2014, and released in the U.S. on 21 June 2016.
