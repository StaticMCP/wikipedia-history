A French Foreign Legion garrison at Phu Tong Hoa on Route Coloniale 3 bis (RC3 bis), north of Bắc Kạn, repelled a major night assault by Việt Minh forces of Regiment 141. The post held after several hours of fighting and was relieved on 28 July. The Việt Minh leadership considered the battle to be the first coordinated assault against a fortified French position. The lessons learned at Phu Tong Hoa informed Viet Minh doctrine and training, and contributed to the major Viet Minh victory on Route Coloniale 4 in September-October 1950.\nBackground\nFollowing Operation LEA (a three axis assault into the Việt Bắc sanctuary zone), in October 1947, the French maintained a chain of posts along RC4 and RC3 bis to secure the Cao Bằng–Bắc Kạn axis. Phu Tong Hoa, overlooking the village of the same name, was garrisoned by the 2nd Company, I/3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment (3e REI - Régiment Étranger d’Infanterie), reinforced by gunners from the 69th African Artillery Regiment (69e RAA– Régiment d’Artillerie d’Afrique). The fort was constructed of earth-and-timber walls with four concrete blockhouses, wire and bamboo obstacles, and defensive mine belts.\nBattle\nAt approximately 19:30 on 25 July 1948, Việt Minh artillery (including Japanese 75 mm mountain guns and a 37 mm gun) opened fire on the post from high ground to the north and west of the fort. Under cover of the artillery barrage, Viet Minh infantry companies infiltrated to within 50 metres of the post. At about 21:00 hours, the Viet Minh assaulted the fort from multiple directions. The Viet Minh breached the perimeter on the western side and the northeast corner, and seized several bunkers.  Company officers Captain Hervé Cardinal and Lieutenant Charlotton were mortally wounded during the bombardment and ensuing fighting; command devolved to Sous-lieutenant Jacques Bévalot. After heavy close-quarters combat around the blockhouses and perimeter, the defenders counter-attacked and by around midnight reported the post back in French hands.\nAftermath\nOn 26–27 July the depleted garrison restored communications and prepared for renewed attacks while French relief efforts were impeded by Việt Minh interdiction along RC3 bis. A relief column under Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Simon, commanding 3e REI, reached Phu Tong Hoa on the evening of 28 July. French losses are recorded as 24 killed and 33 wounded; Việt Minh casualties are uncertain, with memorial plaques at the site recording 42 fallen from Battalion 11, Regiment 141. The engagement demonstrated the Việt Minh’s evolving tactics for assaults on fortified posts and foreshadowed later operations on RC4.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://battlefieldtravels.com/battle-of-phu-tong-hoa/ Battle of Phu Tong Hoa – Battlefield Study], Battlefield Travels (terrain analysis, primary-source synthesis).\n* Dr. Tran Huu Huy, Journal article, Our first large scale offensive, Vietnam Military History Institute\nSee also\n* Battle of Route Coloniale 4\nReferences"
