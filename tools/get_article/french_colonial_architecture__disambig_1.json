French colonial architecture has a long history, beginning in North America in 1604 and being most active in the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, Guiana, Canada, Louisiana) until the 19th century, when the French turned their attention more to Africa, Asia, and Oceania.\nMany former French colonies, especially those in Southeast Asia, have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat \"embraced\" the architecture and has begun to advertise it.\nIn Africa\nFrench Equatorial Africa\nIn the former French Equatorial Africa, Brazzaville, the capital of Congo, and Douala, the largest city of Cameroon have many French colonial buildings.\nFile:Hôtel du Commissaire Général du Gouvernement à Brazzaville (Congo et Dépendances).jpg| The headquarters for the French Commissioner General in Brazzaville (circa 1896–1910)\nFile:Batiment colonial d'époque abritant les services de La Chambre de Commerce d'Industrie de des Mines du Cameroun;.JPG|The Chambre of Commerce in Douala, Cameroon\nFile:Palais de justice a Douala.JPG|The Palace of Justice in Douala\nFile:Ancienne résidence du chef de circonscription.jpg|The former residence of the French regional governor in Douala\nFrench North Africa\n19th and early 20th-century French colonial architecture is typical of the European districts in former French North African countries including most Algerian and Tunisian cities, as well as Casablanca, Morocco. In the mid-20th-century, Algiers became an important center for Modernist architecture.\nFile:Notre Dame d'Afrique2.jpg|Notre-Dame d'Afrique basilica, Algiers, Algeria\nFile:P1020151 (9728164447).jpg|Apartment building in Casablanca, Morocco\nFile:Algeri04.jpg|Apartment building in Algiers, Algeria\nFile:Alger Immeuble rue didouche PB280026.JPG|Apartment building on Rue Didouche-Mourad, Algiers, Algeria (formerly Rue Michelet)\nFile:Algiers The Rue d'Isly (GRI).jpg|Rue d'Isly in Algiers (early 20th century)\nFile:Alger Lycée Bugeaud.jpg|Lycée Bugeaud in Algiers (early 20th century)\nFrench West Africa\nFrench colonial architecture is found in many large and mid-sized former French West African cities, with a particularly significant concentration in the former capital city, Saint-Louis, Senegal.\nFile:Colonial Saint Louis.jpg|Rue Lebon in Saint Louis (circa 1900)\nFile:Saint-Louis maisons coloniales.jpg|Colonial houses in Saint Louis\nIn Asia\nwith Art Nouveau and colonial designs]]\nFrench colonisation of three countries in mainland Southeast Asia—Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, known as Indochina in the 19th and 20th centuries, left a lasting architectural legacy. Most French colonial buildings, now mostly transformed for public use, are located in large urban areas, namely Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), and Phnom Penh (Cambodia).\nThere are also some colonial buildings were built in China due to French concessions and other interests in the country during 19th and 20th centuries.\nCambodia\n* In Phnom Penh:\n**Central Market\n**Phnom Penh\n**Hotel Le Royal\n**National Library of Cambodia\n**Villa Picturesque\n**[http://www.canbypublications.com/phnompenh/phnom-penh-architecture.htm Unesco Sino-Khmer Villa]\nFile:Central.Post.Office.Poste.Phnom.Penh.1.Cambodge.jpg|Phnom Penh Post Office\nFile:2009-09-07 09-09 Phnom Penh 034 Train Station-edit.jpg|Phnom Penh Royal Railway Station\nFile:LeRoyal PP.jpg|Raffles Hotel Le Royal\nFile:2016 Phnom Penh, Biuro UNESCO (03).jpg|Phnom Penh UNESCO office\nFile:Disused, but still fairly pristine (14265405650).jpg|Railway station in Battambang\nFile:2016 Kampot, Muzeum Prowincji Kampot (06).jpg|Building in Kampot\nChina\n* In Beijing:\n**\n* In Tianjin:\n**\n**\n** Zizhulin Church\n* In Shanghai:\n**\n** Banque de l'Indochine Building, Shanghai\n** St. Joseph's Church, Shanghai\n* In Wuhan:\n**\n* In Guangzhou\n** Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel, Shamian Island\n* In Zhanjiang:\n**\n**\n**\nFile:原北京东方汇理银行.JPG|Banque de l'Indochine Building, Beijing\nFile:20150223-法国公议局旧址.jpg|French Municipal Administration Council Building in Tianjin\nFile:天津东方汇理银行大楼1.jpg|Banque de l'Indochine Building, Tianjin\nFile:东方汇理银行大楼正立面2021 (1).jpg|Banque de l'Indochine Building, Shanghai\nFile:Saint-Joseph's church, Shanghai 1.jpg|Saint Joseph's church in Shanghai\nFile:French Concession building - Shanghai.JPG|An apartment at No.142 West Jianguo Road, Shanghai\nFile:Shamian Church of Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel 20221223-A.jpg|Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel, Shamian Island, Guangzhou\nFile:Guangzhou Shamian 2012.11.15 10-05-31.jpg|Banque de l'Indochine Building in Shamian Island, Guangzhou\nFile:Zhanjiang Guangzhouwan Faguo Gongshishu Jiuzhi he Fajun Zhihuibu Jiuzhi 2014.02.27 09-05-29.jpg|Former French Commissioner Residence in Zhanjiang\nFile:Zhanjiang Guangzhouwan Faguo Gongshishu Jiuzhi he Fajun Zhihuibu Jiuzhi 2014.02.27 09-09-19.jpg|Former French Army Commandantura in Zhanjiang\nFile:Cathedral of St. Victor.jpg|Our Lady of Victory Cathedral in Zhanjiang\nLaos\nFile:French Colonial House in Luangprabang (1490843210).jpg|A typical colonial house in Luang Prabang\nFile:VillaColVientiane.jpg| A French-style Arts and Crafts house in Vientiane\nVietnam\nVarious colonial buildings and constructions have become popular tourist destinations.

The settlements in the regions were extensive, hence the abundant architectural legacy from that period shows itself particularly in Quebec City but also in the city of Montreal, which has a significant Canadien population. Most buildings constructed during the French colonial period utilized a heavy timber frame of logs installed vertically on a sill, poteaux-sur-sol, or into the earth, poteaux-en-terre.  An infill of lime mortar or clay mixed with small stones (pierrotage) or a mixture of mud, moss, and animal hair (bousillage) was used to pack between the logs.  Many times the infill would later be replaced with brick.  This method of construction was used in the Illinois Country as well as Louisiana. General characteristics of a French Colonial dwelling included a raised basement which would support the floor of the home's primary living quarters.  Exterior stairs were another common element; the stairs would often climb up to a distinctive, full-length veranda or \"gallery\", on a home's façade. The roof over the veranda was normally part of the overall roof. French Colonial roofs were either a steep hipped roof, with a dormer or dormers, or a side-gabled roof.  The veranda or gallery was often accessed via French doors.  French Colonial homes in the American South commonly had stuccoed exterior walls.\nFile:Old Quebec (8145449190).jpg|Quebec City presents probably the finest example of urban colonial architecture in North America\nFile:Quebec City, Old City, Tourist.jpg|Old Quebec (City) was listed as a UNESCO Heritage Site in 1985\nFile:Le Manoir de Niverville.jpg|The manoir Boucher-De Niverville, located in Trois-Rivières, in Quebec province was built in the mid-17th century\nFile:Château Ramezay - Montreal, Canada - DSC07372.jpg|The Château Ramezay, is one of the best preserved mansion in Montreal, built in 1705.\nFile:07175 Maison François-Jacquet-Dit-Langevin - 001.JPG|The Maison François-Jacquet-Dit-Langevin, located in the heart of Old Quebec, was built in 1675.\nFile:WTMTL T29 DSC00061.JPG|LeBer-LeMoyne House, was an important trading post when it was built in the late 17th century.

The other styles were Colonial Georgian, Dutch Colonial, and Spanish Colonial.  French Colonial developed in the settlements of the Illinois Country and French Louisiana.  It is believed to have been primarily influenced by the building styles of French Canada and the Caribbean. It had its beginnings in 1699 with the establishment of French Louisiana but continued to be built after Spain assumed control of the colonial territory in 1763. Styles of building that evolved during the French colonial period include the Creole cottage, Creole townhouse, and French Creole plantation house.\nFile:UConvent2003Mbtrama.jpg|Ursuline Convent in New Orleans, built c. 1752.
