It is therefore a very early example of a Darwin Industry book, along with The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin which was edited by Charles's son (and Etty's brother) Sir Francis Darwin, and More Letters of Charles Darwin edited by Frank and Albert Seward.\nThe book was dedicated by Etty to her niece, Emma's granddaughter, Frances Cornford.\nThe Times described it as \"an admirable piece of work, in which the editor, while largely effacing herself, yet gave a notable picture of an interesting family life\".\nThe book was reviewed in The Eugenics Review by Albert Seward who concluded that the book \"bring[s] to us into the closest touch with wise and attractive personalities and at the same time they record facts of great scientific interest\".\nIn R. B. Freeman's Charles Darwin bibliography, he noted that the publication \"contains a large number of letters from Charles and is an important source of information about his day to day and family life\".\nThe 1915 edition also contains a brief biography of Erasmus Darwin IV, Emma's grandson who had been recently killed in the First World War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_EmmaDarwin.html"
