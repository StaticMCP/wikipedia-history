Virgin Islands Republicans could select six pledged delegates for the 2008 Republican National Convention; three party leaders also attended the convention as unpledged delegates.  However, the delegates chosen in the meeting did not support any presidential candidate, so all nine Virgin Islands delegates attended the convention as unpledged delegates.\nThe turnout, around 150 people, did not match the comparatively staggering number of voters in the Democratic Territorial Meeting, but it was still a record turnout for the Virgin Islands Republican Party.  Caucus-goers voted for delegates rather than candidates.  Of 25 people who sought delegate spots, the majority, 16, were not committed to any presidential candidate.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+100% of precincts reporting\n|-\n!
