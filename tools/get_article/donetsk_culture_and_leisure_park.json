The park was laid out only in 1956 due to numerous modifications of design; the same year the 20th anniversary of Maxim Gorky's death was commemorated, so the park was first named after him. In 1958 the 40th Anniversary of Leninist Komsomol alley was established, and the park was subsequently renamed to Leninist Komsomol Park (officially renaming in 1972). The park was renamed to its current name on the 11th of September 2006 during its refurbishment.\nFormer names\n* Maxim Gorkin Park (1956 — 1972)\n* Leninist Komsomol Park of Culture and Leisure|}}}} (25 October 1972 — 10 September 2006)\nAfter the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic took control of the city, the Soviet-era name was restored, but the Ukrainian authorities do not recognize it.\nPlaces of interest\n* The .
