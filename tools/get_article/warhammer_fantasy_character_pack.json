      "text": "# Warhammer Fantasy Character Pack\n\nWarhammer Fantasy Character Pack is a 1987 role-playing game supplement published by Games Workshop for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.\nContents\nWarhammer Fantasy Character Pack is a supplement in which character record sheets were accompanied by rules for fleshing out a character's background, including details like origin, family ties, physical appearance, and naming conventions. The second edition did not include those rules, offering instead a setting description of a bustling city inn.\nPublication history\nCharacter Pack was written by Paul Cockburn, with a cover by Bob Naismith and published by Games Workshop in 1987 as a pad of 50 character sheets, a 16-page booklet, and an outer folder. The second edition features a cover by Graeme Davis and was published by Flame Publications in 1990.\nReception\nLawrence Schick described the second edition as \"less cool\".\nReviews\n*Computer and Video Games\n*The Games Machine\nReferences"
