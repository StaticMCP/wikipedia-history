In the , Home Creek had a population of 24 people.\nOn 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Home Creek was incorporated into Barcaldine.\nGeography\nThe Landsborough Highway passes through the locality from north (Patrick) to south (Blackall).\nThe watercourse Home Creek (from which the locality presumably takes its name) rises in Evora to the south-east and then flows through the locality of Home Creek from the south-east to the west (Barcaldine Downs) where it becomes a tributary to the Alice River.\nThe principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Home Creek. The nearest primary and secondary schools are in Barcaldine and Blackall.\nReferences"
