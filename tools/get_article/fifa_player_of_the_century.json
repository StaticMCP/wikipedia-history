Diego Maradona and Pelé were joint winners of the award.\nBackground\nSince 1991, FIFA has had awards for FIFA World Player of the Year and they decided to bring in the year 2000 by conducting a public vote to decide the FIFA Player of the Century. This was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine, and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet-based poll by wide margins, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pelé. Many observers complained that the Internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play, but not Pelé.\nAs a result, FIFA decided to add a second poll and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists, officials, and coaches (50%), and also a voting from the FIFA Magazine subscribers (50%) who voted Pelé the best player of the century with an overall 72.75% of the vote. Thus both were joint winners of the award.\nResults\nFIFA Internet vote\nThe results of FIFA's internet Poll were as follows: 27 players were voted.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=col| Rank\n!scope=col| Player\n!scope=col| Nationality\n!scope=col| Percentage\n|-\n| 1\n!scope=row|Diego Maradona\n| ||  53.60%\n|-\n| 2\n!scope=row| Pelé\n| ||  18.53%\n|-\n| 3\n!scope=row| Eusébio\n|  || 6.21%\n|-\n| 4\n!scope=row| Roberto Baggio\n|  || 5.42%\n|-\n| 5\n!scope=row| Romário\n|  || 1.69%\n|-\n| 6\n!scope=row| Marco van Basten\n| ||1.57%\n|-\n| 7\n!scope=row| Ronaldo\n|  ||  1.55%\n|-\n| 8\n!scope=row| Franz Beckenbauer\n| || 1.50%\n|-\n| 9\n!scope=row| Zinedine Zidane\n| || 1.34%\n|-\n| 10\n!scope=row| Rivaldo\n|  || 1.19%\n|-\n| 11\n!scope=row| Zico\n|  || 1.15%\n|-\n| 12\n!scope=row| Garrincha\n|   || 1.08%\n|-\n| 13\n!scope=row| Johan Cruyff\n|  || 0.87%\n|-\n| 14\n!scope=row| Alfredo Di Stéfano\n|  || 0.68%\n|-\n| 15\n!scope=row| Michel Platini\n|  || 0.58%\n|-\n| 16\n!scope=row| Bobby Charlton\n| || 0.39%\n|-\n| 17\n!scope=row| Ferenc Puskás\n|  || 0.37%\n|-\n| 18\n!scope=row| Lothar Matthäus\n|  || 0.37%\n|-\n| 19\n!scope=row| Lev Yashin\n|  || 0.36%\n|-\n| 20\n!scope=row| George Best\n| || 0.32%\n|-\n| 21\n!scope=row| Dino Zoff\n| || 0.24%\n|-\n| 22\n!scope=row| Didi\n| || 0.22%\n|-\n| 23\n!scope=row| Stanley Matthews\n| || 0.18%\n|-\n| 24\n!scope=row| George Weah\n| || 0.18%\n|-\n| 25\n!scope=row| Bobby Moore\n| || 0.17%\n|-\n| 26\n!scope=row| Just Fontaine\n| || 0.13%\n|-\n| 27\n!scope=row| Gerd Muller\n| || 0.11%\n|-\n|}\nFIFA Magazine and Grand Jury vote\nThis part of the award was decided by the FIFA Magazine readers vote and the FIFA Grand Jury.
