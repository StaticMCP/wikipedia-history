It was later expanded and modified to a one-room-deep center passage plan dwelling with a two-story ell.\nThe house was expanded and remodeled to Colonial Revival style during 1921–22, \"according to a design apparently conceived by the Staunton architectural firm T. J. Collins and Sons.\" A two-story kitchen and service wing was added.  Also on the property are a contributing laundry and wood house and a garage, both built in 1922; a 19th-century log cabin that may originally have served as a slave cabin; a Long Barn and a machinery shed (ca. 1905); two stables of Colonial Revival\ndesign dating to the 1920s or early 1930s; and a fieldstone wall. It includes Federal and Greek Revival architecture.  Oakley Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.  The listing included ten contributing buildings and five other contributing structures on .\nReferences"
