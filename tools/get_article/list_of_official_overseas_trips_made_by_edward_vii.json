Before his accession, he made extensive tours of territories of the British Empire or under British control as the Prince of Wales. His visit to Canada was regarded as the first modern official visit to overseas territories by a member of the royal family, and his visit to India was the first to the country by a future British monarch. As King, he revived state visit to foreign countries as an important tool of diplomatic maneuver and royal influence, playing a significant role in establishing the modern form of state visit of the British monarchs. Among his many visits to European countries were the first state visit by a reigning British monarch to a republic (France) and the first to Russia as well as some less formal ones that were not counted as full state visits (e.g. his visit to Austria in August – September 1903). He did not make official tours of British territories outside Europe as King.\nOfficial tours of territories of the British Empire or under British control as Prince of Wales\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n!colspan=4|Tour of North America from July to October 1860: The voyages were on board HMS Hero.}}\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Date !!
