Children, persons in poverty, and migrants are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Victims are deceived, threatened, or forced into prostitution, and their passports and other documents are often taken. They suffer from physical and psychological abuse and trauma and are typically guarded and or locked up in poor conditions. Prior to 2022, Taiwan had maintained a tier 1 status of protection against human trafficking for 13 years straight in a series of reports released by the U.S. Department of State.\nMale and female traffickers come from all social and economic classes of Taiwan. Traffickers are often members of or facilitated by crime syndicates and gangs. The extent of sex trafficking in Taiwan is difficult to know because of the lack of data, secretive nature of sex trafficking crimes, and other factors.\nNon-governmental organizations\nThe Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation rescues victims of sex trafficking in Taiwan.\nSee also\n* Rape in Taiwan\n* Organized crime in Taiwan\nReferences"
