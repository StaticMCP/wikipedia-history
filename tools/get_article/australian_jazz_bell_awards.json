They were named in honour of Australian jazz pianist, composer and band leader, Graeme Bell (1914–2012), at their inception in 2003 at the Melbourne International Jazz Festival.\nThe awards were announced by Bell and Victoria's Minister for the Arts, Mary Delahunty, on 5 June 2003 to recognise the talent and achievements of Australian jazz artists locally and internationally. They were the inspiration of festival chairman, Albert Dadon, and its artistic director, Adrian Jackson. The latter explained, \"The Bells will put the spotlight on the Australian jazz industry that it has never enjoyed before. These new industry gongs will recognise the achievement of excellence by many artists, record companies and venues, and will encourage others to match those achievements.\"\nIn 2008, the Australian Jazz Awards Limited, a not-for-profit organisation with its own independent board, was established to present the awards, which thereby became separate from the Melbourne International Jazz Festival committee. The number of awards have varied with six to nine&nbsp;categories being provided each year. The awards were not presented in 2005 or 2020.\nAwards\n2003 Bell Awards\nThe inaugural Australian Jazz Awards were presented at Melbourne's Grand Hyatt Hotel during the Melbourne International Jazz Festival on 28 August 2003, honouring artists in nine&nbsp;categories.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"| 2003 || Sandy Evans || Australian Jazz Artist of the Year ||\n|-\n| Australian Art Orchestra || Australian Jazz Ensemble of the Year ||\n|-\n| Bennetts Lane Big Band || Australian Jazz Venue of the Year ||\n|-\n| Collected Works &ndash; Allan Browne || Best Australian Classic Jazz Album ||\n|-\n| Mikrokosmos &ndash; Andrea Keller || Best Australian Contemporary Jazz Album ||\n|-\n| Making Wings &ndash; Judy Jacques || Best Australian Jazz Vocal Album ||\n|-\n| The Soul of Things &ndash; Tomasz Stanko || International Jazz Album of the Year ||\n|-\n| Aron Ottignon || Young Australian Jazz Artist of the Year ||\n|-\n| Ade Monsbourgh || Graeme Bell Hall of Fame ||\n|-\n2004 Bell Awards\nOn 10 August 2004 a new artistic director of the Melbourne International Jazz festival, Carlo Pagnotta, formerly director of Italy's Umbria Jazz Festival, announced the 27&nbsp;nominees of the second&nbsp;Bell Awards, honouring artists in nine&nbsp;categories.
