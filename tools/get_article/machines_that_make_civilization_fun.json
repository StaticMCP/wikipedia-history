Sundstrom of PopMatters gave the album 7 stars out of 10, stating, \"It's hard to gauge now how dated it will sound in five or ten years, but at this moment, it's the neurotic and deafening sound of a civilization whose machines are beginning to break down, and it sounds terrifyingly familiar.\" Bram E. Gieben of The Skinny gave the album 4 stars out of 5, commenting that \"Far from instant gratification, what this album offers is a puzzle-box of rhymes and beats to decode; at times cryptic, at others feral and intense.\"\nFact placed it at number 50 on the \"50 Best Albums of 2012\" list.\nTrack listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
