The average age of the 16 projects recognised to 2024 is 36.6 years from completion of construction to year of award. The award was issued every second year from 2005 until 2013, and has been awarded annually since 2014 (see table below).\nDescription\nThe award recognises significant, long lasting and innovative architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction. The Enduring Architecture Award recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which have remained important as high quality works of architecture when considered in contemporary cultural, social, economic and environmental contexts in South Australia. Nominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non–members and non–architects, but must provide adequate material and information supporting the nomination for consideration of the jury.\nNational Awards\nRecipients of the state–based award are eligible for consideration for the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards. As of 2023 no South Australian projects had received a National Award for Enduring Architecture.\nBy year\n2007 award\nWhen awarding the second award to Newell Platten for Dr Kent's Paddock in 2007, the jury citation read; ''\"The 25 Year Award is not given lightly and it has been two years since it was last awarded — but the Jury's views were unanimous. Dr Kent’s Paddock, more that any other project of its time embodies the virtues of this award — a project of considerable influence for its time and place, and one that has stood the test of time. All the more potent is that it was carried out by the most venerable of South Australia’s institutions, the South Australian Housing Trust, its role now incorporated within Housing SA\".''\n2022 award\nThe Jury for the 2022 award was composed of Honours Committee members Anthony Coupe, David Hassell, Rob Cheesman, Lolita Mohyla, Tony Giannone, Elaine Davies and Lu Balsamo. The award was given to Robin Boyd's Walkley House built in North Adelaide in 1956.\n2023 award\nThe Jury for the 2023 award was Anthony Coupe, Chris Morley, Elaine Davies, Lolita Mohyla, Lu Balsamo and Rob Cheesman. The award was given to the Adelaide Festival Centre by Hassell, opened in 1973. The jury citation described the project saying \"The Adelaide Festival Centre is not only instantly recognisable, it also represents an important period in South Australian history and is integral to our identity as the Festival State. Buildings that achieve all these things at once are rare, and for the Festival Centre to have done so for 50 years is truly worthy of celebration.\"\n2024 award\nThe jury for the 2024 award was Anthony Coupe (Mulloway) and Lolita Mohyla (Mohyla Architects) and retired architects Rob Cheesman (Cheesman), Elaine Davies (DaSH), Lu Balsamo (Hassell) and Adrian Evans (JPE). The  jury citation described the awarded project, the Science Technology and Art Centre at St Peters College (SPCS) by Geof Nairn stating \"the project realises the SPCS ethos to ‘cherish history while embracing the ever-evolving landscape of education’. The new building is clearly of its time, with saw tooth roofs and glazed facades providing ample natural light. The siting, roof pitch and rendered walls defer to adjacent sandstone buildings.\"\nAward recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Jack Cheesman Award for Enduring Architecture (reverse order)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Year !!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Architect !!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Project  !!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Location !!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Year built !!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Years since !!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other AIA/RAIA awards\n|-style=\"background: white;\"\n| 2025|| colspan=6 align=center|No Award\n|-\n| 2024 ||Geof Nairn Architects ||St Peter’s Collegiate School (SPCS) Science, Technology and Art Centre||12 Pembroke Street, St Peters, Adelaide||1999 ||25 years||\n|-\n| 2023 ||Hassell & Partners ||Adelaide Festival Centre|| King William Road, Adelaide||1973 ||50 years  ||\n|-\n| 2022 ||Robin Boyd ||Walkley House|| 26-27 Palmer Place, North Adelaide||1956  ||66 years  ||\n|-\n| 2021 || SA Public Buildings Department (Architect Adrian Evans) & SACON (Architect Denis Harrison) || Juvenile Court (now Youth Court of South Australia) || 75 Wright Street, Adelaide ||1975 || 46 years ||\n|-\n| 2020 || Cheesman Doley Brabham & Neighbour || Nunyara Chapel || 8 Culley Avenue, Belair  ||1963 || 57 years ||\n* Award of Merit, 1966\n|-\n| 2019 || Hassell & Partners || Colonel Light Centre || 25 Pirie Street, Adelaide ||1978 || 41 years ||\n|-\n| 2018 || Max Pritchard || Pritchard House ||  ||1990 || 28 years ||\n|-\n| 2017 || SACON (Architect Carlo Gnezda) || Adelaide Velodrome ||  State Sports Park, Main North Road, Gepps Cross ||1993 || 24 years ||\n* National Commendation for Public Architecture, 1993 (National Awards)\n|-\n| 2016 || SA Public Buildings Department (Architect Kevin Hocking) || South Australian Forensic Science Centre || 21 Divett Place, Adelaide  ||1978 || 38 years ||\n|-\n| 2015|| Geof Nairn Architects || Centennial Park Chapel Complex (Heysen and Florey Chapels) || 760 Goodwood Road, Pasadena SA 5042  ||1986 || 29 years ||\n|-\n| 2014 || Guy Maron Architect || Bicentennial Conservatory || Plane Tree Drive, Adelaide Botanic Gardens  ||1988 || 26 years ||\n*Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, 1991 (National)\n|-\n| 2013 || Rod Roach || Roach House Belair || 21 Fourth Road, Belair, South Australia ||1971 ||42 years  ||\n*Derrick Kendrick Award for Sustainable Architecture, 2013\n|-style=\"background: white;\"\n| 2012 || colspan=6 align=center|No Award†\n|-\n| 2011 ||  Guy Maron Architect || Regency Park College of TAFE || Regency Park ||1980? ||31 years ||\n|-style=\"background: white;\"\n| 2010|| colspan=6 align=center|No Award†\n|-\n| 2009 || Rod Roach with Woodhead || Adelaide Fire Station || 81–129 Wakefield Street, Adelaide ||1985 || 24 years ||\n|-style=\"background: white;\"\n| 2008 || colspan=6 align=center|No Award†\n|-\n| 2007 || Newell Platten, Chief Design Architect, South Australian Housing Trust|| Dr Kent's Paddock and Open Space || 3—57 Capper Street & 28—48 Rundle Street, Kent Town ||1979 || 28 years ||\n|-style=\"background: white;\"\n| 2006 || colspan=6 align=center|No Award†\n|-\n| 2005 || Robert Dickson || Adelaide University Union, Union House || Victoria Drive, University of Adelaide, Adelaide ||1975 || 30 years ||\n* Award of Merit, 1974\n* Civic Trust Award, 1975\n|}\n† Award was presented biennially from 2005—2013\nGallery\nSee also\n*Australian Institute of Architects\n*Australian Institute of Architects Awards and Prizes\n*National Award for Enduring Architecture\n*Sir Roy Grounds Award for Enduring Architecture\nReferences"
