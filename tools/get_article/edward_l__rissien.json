When the war was over and Rissien returned to Des Moines, he quickly realized he wanted to be closer to theater and in a telephone conversation with Cloris, she suggested that he come to New York.

From there he went to ABC, where he was program supervisor on shows such as Combat and The Donna Reed Show. In the early 1960s, he was hired as VP of production for Bing Crosby Productions, producer of such shows as ''Hogan's Heroes, Ben Casey, The Bing Crosby Show and others. After that he went to Filmways as VP of Production for film and television. Projects produced during this time included The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres and the film Castle Keep directed by legendary director Sydney Pollack.\nRissien produced independent films, including Snow Job for Warner Bros. before joining Playboy Productions in 1972 as an executive VP of production.
