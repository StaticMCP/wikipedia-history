His size and agility at  and  had allowed him many roles as a thug or villain for film and television.\nEarly life\nSchwartz was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 16, 1959. He was of Israeli descent and was a devout Jew. Schwartz was born and raised in Philadelphia, where he played football, baseball and ice hockey at Washington High School before attending Temple University. After college, he became a professional wrestler, wrestling under the ring-names of \"Joshua Ben-Gurion—The Israeli Commando\" and \"Giant David\". Schwartz toured as a wrestler and held many titles, before turning his career toward performance in film and television.\nApart from his acting, and after completing training, Schwartz became a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy.\nProfessional wrestling career\nAfter college, Schwartz became a professional wrestler, trained in the late 1970s by wrestling's Walter \"Killer\" Kowalski. Schwartz's original ring-name was Giant David, but by the 1980s he was known as Joshua Ben-Gurion—The Israeli Commando and Igor the Giant. As a professional wrestler, he performed in Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, Western Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Guam, Canada and 40 of the 50 United States. He was promoted by Verne Gagne, Vince McMahon, Herb Abrams, Antone \"Ripper\" Leone, and Bruno Sammartino.\nFilm and television career\nSchwartz was wrestling on tour in Bakersfield, California, when he was approached by a Hollywood agent. After seeing Schwartz's wrestling on television, the agent had traveled to Bakerfield to meet him, feeling Schwartz should take his skills into performing arts. At first, Schwartz was reluctant to change careers, wanting to retire as a wrestler.\nIn his early stunt work, and because of his background in pro wrestling, Schwartz was able to handle the staged combat, which required protecting opponents from harm. Due to his look, size, agility, and ability to handle dialogue, he was able to obtain roles as the \"bad guy\" in many films and television projects. He was known for his work in such films and television shows as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Star Trek: Enterprise, The Scorpion King, Charmed, The Tick, and Black Scorpion among others, but he is probably most recognized for his role as 'Bruiser' in the films ''Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen. He appeared in such big budget films as Spider-Man, Fire Down Below, Starsky & Hutch, and Fun with Dick and Jane.\nDeath\nSchwartz died from congestive heart failure on November 26, 2024, at the age of 65.\nChampionships and accomplishments\n*Universal Wrestling Federation\n**UWF Israeli Championship (1 time)\nFilmography\n;As actor\n* UWF Fury Hour (1990, TV Series)\n* Shock 'Em Dead (1991) as Guard\n* For Parents Only (1991) as \"The Wrench\"\n* Terminal USA (1993) as Tony \"Big Tony\"\n* Back in Action'' (1993) as Kasajian's Thug (uncredited)\n* Dangerous Waters (1994) as Carlito\n* Silent Fury (1994) as \"Crusher\"\n* Savate (1995) as Bruno \"The Horrible\"\n* The Set-Up (1995) as Maniac (uncredited)\n* Tiger Mask (1996) as \"Sonic Boom\"\n* Meet Wally Sparks (1997) as American Wrestler #2\n* Fire Down Below (1997) as \"Pimple\"\n* Dilemma (1997) as Guard #1\n* High Voltage (1997) as Biker\n* The Misadventures of James Spawn (1998) as Drill Sergeant\n* Centurion Force (1998) as Nicky\n* P.U.N.K.S.
