It stars Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as two estranged brothers whose entrance into a mixed martial arts tournament makes them come to terms with their lives and each other. Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison, Frank Grillo, and Bryan Callen appear in supporting roles. Real-life MMA and combat sports figures like Kurt Angle, Nate Marquardt, Anthony Johnson, Roan Carneiro, Yves Edwards, Amir Perets, and Dan Caldwell make appearances.\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on September 9, 2011, by Lionsgate. Although not commercially successful, the film received positive reviews from critics, with Nolte receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\nPlot\nA melancholic U.S. Marine Thomas \"Tommy\" Riordan visits his father, Paddy Conlon, a recovering alcoholic who has returned to his Orthodox faith in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a child, Tommy had to run away from Paddy with his dying mother due to Paddy being an abusive alcoholic and has never forgiven him. Paddy tries to convince him that he has changed, but to no avail. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where he quickly knocks out Pete \"Mad Dog\" Grimes, one of the world's best middleweight fighters; a video of the fight goes viral on the Internet. Learning about a winner-takes-all mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta, whose winner will receive $5 million, Tommy asks Paddy to help him train for the tournament, but only under the condition that Paddy does not try to repair their relationship. Tommy pledges to win and then donate the entire $5 million purse to Pilar, the widow of Manny, one of his friends in the corps.\nTommy's older brother Brendan, a high school physics teacher and former MMA fighter, is struggling to provide for his wife, Tess, and their two daughters. He had to mortgage his house in Philadelphia to pay for his younger daughter's open heart surgery and is now in danger of losing it. To increase his income, Brendan starts battling amateur fighters for money. He is suspended without pay after details of his secret life spread around the school. Paddy meets Brendan in his driveway to try to reconcile with him, albeit unsuccessfully, and to tell him that Tommy is back in town. Brendan seeks the training of old friend Frank Campana and begins competing in smaller venue fights. After the fighter Frank planned to enter into the Sparta tournament is injured, Brendan convinces Frank to enter him as a replacement.\nWhen the brothers separately enter the tournament, it is revealed that Tommy is angry at Brendan for bailing out on him and instead staying behind for Tess when Tommy and their mother left Paddy; Tommy was left to care for their mother when she became terminally ill. Brendan claims that he was helplessly in love with Tess and that he has forgiven his father for the wrong he has done, but Tommy is unconvinced and walks away.\nMeanwhile, the video of Tommy beating Grimes attracts the attention of a Marine, who tells the press that Tommy saved his life in Iraq, by ripping off the back hatch of a drowning tank. Although Tommy becomes a national hero, his military records reveal that he deserted after everyone else in his unit was killed in a friendly fire bombing. He reveals his plan for his winnings. The military police will take him into custody but will wait until after the tournament is over.\nOver two fights, Brendan and Tommy have contrasting fortunes: Tommy quickly and brutally knocks out opponents, all while barely speaking, while Brendan is outmatched physically but uses Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to force grappling submissions.\nThe night before the final day, Paddy attempts to talk to Tommy about his actions in Iraq. Tommy angrily dismisses his father, letting out all his pent-up emotions. As a result, Paddy relapses and starts drinking again. Seeing his father in pain, Tommy calms and comforts him, thus resurrecting their relationship.\nIn the semifinals, Tommy is matched up with Mad Dog Grimes, knocking him unconscious almost immediately, and the commentators claim this is one of the fastest knockouts in MMA history. Brendan is matched up with undefeated Russian wrestler Koba, who dominates him in two rounds. In round three, Brendan swings for the fences, making the bout a back-and-forth battle. In the closing moments of the final round, Koba takes Brendan's back from the clinch, and Brendan goes for a rolling kneebar. As Koba attempts to escape the position, Brendan quickly reverses and readjusts the kneebar, narrowly winning by submission.\nTommy and Brendan's relationship is revealed to the world when they are the tournament's last remaining fighters. Brendan shows desire to reconcile, but Tommy, still in pain, shows no interest in doing so. Tommy wins the first two rounds, but Brendan eventually dislocates Tommy's shoulder with an omoplata arm-lock. Brendan wants to tell the referee about Tommy's dislocated shoulder and end the fight, but his coach suggests otherwise. As the fourth round starts, Brendan insists Tommy give up as Tommy only has use of one arm. Tommy continues to fight. Brendan unloads a barrage of strikes trying to win. Tommy asks Brendan to continue hitting him as the fourth round ends. At the start of Round 5, Brendan realizes he has to force Tommy to submit, and he traps him in a rear-naked choke. As they struggle on the canvas, Brendan apologizes to Tommy and tells him that he loves him. Tommy submits after hearing the words. Brendan and Campana tactfully avoid the referees and the doctors checking in on Tommy. The reconciled brothers exit the ring as their father walks away into the background smiling.\nCast\nThemes\nDescribed by critics as \"heartbreaking and emotionally satisfying\", \"really gripping\", \"an unapologetic powerhouse of emotional conflict\" and self-described as a \"rousing ode to redemption, reconciliation and the power of the human spirit\", Warrior has received the most praise for the emotional approach it takes to the themes of forgiveness and \"the enduring bonds of family\" that it explores. In their review, Common Sense Media cites unconditional love as a major theme, further explaining that \"some weighty issues\" such as estrangement and alcoholism are also dealt with.\nProduction\nwon San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as a recovering alcoholic father.]]\nMogul Minds Studios, (now 31st Street Studios), located in Pittsburgh, was used during the filming, as well as the University of Pittsburgh's Petersen Events Center and the Twin Hi-Way Drive-In.

The family drama resonates strongly with a resolution that, in retrospect, seems like the only way the brothers could have rediscovered blood ties.\"\nSome critics, including Philip French from the UK newspaper The Observer, have noted similarities to other sports drama films such as Rocky (1976), The Wrestler (2008), and The Fighter (2010).\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n|IGN Summer Movie Awards\n|September 20, 2011\n|Best Drama Movie\n|Warrior\n|\n|\n|-\n|San Diego Film Critics Society\n|December 12, 2011\n|Best Supporting Actor\n|Nick Nolte\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Satellite Awards\n| rowspan=\"3\" | December 18, 2011\n| Best Actor in a Motion Picture\n| Tom Hardy\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture\n| Nick Nolte\n|\n|-\n| Best Editing\n| Sean Albertson, Matt Chessé, John Gilroy,  Aaron Marshall\n|\n|-\n|Chicago Film Critics Association\n|December 19, 2011\n|Best Supporting Actor\n|Nick Nolte\n|\n|\n|-\n|Las Vegas Film Critics Society\n|December 19, 2011\n|Top 10 List\n|Warrior\n|\n|\n|-\n|Dublin Film Critics' Circle\n|December 23, 2011\n|Top 10 Actors\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Nick Nolte\n|\n|\n|-\n|Online Film Critics Society\n|January 2, 2012\n|Best Supporting Actor\n|\n|\n|-\n|Denver Film Critics Society\n|January 9, 2012\n|Best Supporting Actor\n|\n|\n|-\n| Critics' Choice Movie Awards\n| January 12, 2012\n| Best Supporting Actor\n|\n|\n|-\n| Screen Actors Guild Awards\n| January 29, 2012\n| Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role\n|\n|\n|-\n| Academy Awards\n| February 26, 2012\n| Best Supporting Actor\n|\n|\n|-\n|MTV Movie & TV Awards\n|June 3, 2012\n|Best Fight\n|Joel Edgerton vs. Tom Hardy\n|\n|\n|-\n|Teen Choice Awards\n|July 22, 2012\n|Choice Movie Actor: Action\n|Tom Hardy\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Prism Awards\n| rowspan=\"2\" |November 7, 2012\n|Feature Film – Substance Use\n|Warrior\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Performance in a Feature Film\n|Nick Nolte\n|\n|-\n|}\nSoundtrack\nWarrior: Original Score is the soundtrack album for the film, composed and produced by Mark Isham.
