The memorial depicts cranes in flight, a reference to a popular Russian-language song by Rasul Gamzatov. A refrain from the song is shown in both English and Russian. A granite slab bares the inscription \"dedicated in honor of and in tribute to the World War II veterans from the former Soviet Union\" in English. West Hollywood is the center of a large Russian-speaking community from the former Soviet Union.\nReferences"
