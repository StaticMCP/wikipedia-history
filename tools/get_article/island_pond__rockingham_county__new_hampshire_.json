The pond was formed from the merger of Perch Pond in Hampstead and Lake Wentworth in Derry in 1878, when a new dam raised the water level by .\nThe pond is named for Governor's Island, a  island that lies within it. The island in turn is named for Benning Wentworth, colonial governor of New Hampshire, who built a summer residence on the north end of the island called Birch Farm. A smaller island is named after the Native American chief Escumbuit.\nThe lake is classified as a cold and warmwater fishery and contains largemouth and smallmouth bass, brook trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, chain pickerel, horned pout, white perch, black crappie, and bluegill.\nSee also\n*List of lakes in New Hampshire\nReferences"
