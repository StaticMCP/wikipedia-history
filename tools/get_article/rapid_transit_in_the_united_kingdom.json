      "text": "# Rapid transit in the United Kingdom\n\n}}\nRapid transit in the United Kingdom consists of four systems: the London Underground and the Docklands Light Railway in London; the Tyne and Wear Metro in Tyne and Wear; and the Glasgow Subway. The term may also include commuter rail systems with aspects of rapid transit such as the London Overground and Elizabeth line in London, and Merseyrail in the Liverpool City Region. Rapid transit has also been proposed in other UK cities including Sheffield,  Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Cardiff, Bristol, and Cambridge.\nHistory\nThe United Kingdom is the birthplace of rapid transit, with London and Liverpool hosting the world's first and second urban rail transits and Glasgow the fourth. From 1893 to 1956, the Liverpool Overhead Railway was the only elevated rapid transit in the country; however it fell into disuse and was demolished in 1957. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the United Kingdom has chosen not to prioritise investment in rapid transit schemes; instead cities like Manchester, Sheffield, and Edinburgh have opted for trams.\nList of systems\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sort-under-center\"\n! width=90|City\n! width=150|System\n! width=120|Start of operations\n!
