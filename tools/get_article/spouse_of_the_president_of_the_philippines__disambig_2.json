Hence the titles are also erroneously used to refer to the president's spouse.\nThree spouses, that of Elpidio Quirino, Diosdado Macapagal and Corazon Aquino, were already deceased at the start of their respective partner's presidencies although Macapagal was married to his second wife at the start of his presidency.\nBenigno Aquino III is the only unmarried president.\nList\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2 style=\"width:100px;\"| Portrait\n!rowspan=2| Spouse\n! colspan=2|Marriage\n!rowspan=2| President\n|-\n!
