He attended the local schools and graduated from Mount Pleasant's Howe's Academy.  He graduated from the University of Iowa College of Law with an LL.B. degree in 1885, and was admitted to the bar.  Smith relocated to Seward, Nebraska, in the summer of 1885, and established a law practice that specialized in interstate commerce.  He moved to Omaha in 1890 and continued to practice law.\nIn addition to his law practice, Smith was active in several businesses.  He was the attorney for the Omaha Grain Exchange, of which he was also a board of directors member.  In addition, Smith was vice president of the Omaha Cooperage Company, and served on its board of directors.\nMayor of Omaha\nA Democrat, Smith ran for mayor in 1918 and beat incumbent Mayor \"Cowboy\" Jim Dahlman on a reform ticket aiming to defeat Tom Dennison's political machine, which at that point had run Omaha for at least 15 years. Dennison's displeasure with Smith's morality stance was frequently voiced, and took shape in the Omaha Race Riot of 1919. During that riot, Smith was strung up and almost lynched by a mob. After being rescued by Omaha Police detectives, he was taken to Omaha's Ford Hospital. Smith's political interest never returned.\nDeath and burial\nHe died in Omaha on May 21, 1930, and was buried in Section 23, Lot 186 of Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Omaha.\nFamily\nIn November 1883, Smith married Margaret Wertman of Greenfield, Iowa.  They were the parents of Ida B. Smith, Lisle W. Smith, and Edward Esher Smith.\nSee also\n* History of Omaha\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/smith3.html#RIN0RMLJL Edward Parsons Smith] at The Political Graveyard\n*"
