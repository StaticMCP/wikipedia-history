Its purpose is to consolidate all federally funded agricultural research, and it is subordinate to the Department of Agriculture.  It replaced the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service in 2009. Dr. Jaye L. Hamby was appointed NIFA Director on March 20, 2025.\nNIFA supports more than 70 statutory grant programs. These programs fulfill statutory requirements and provide research, education, Extension services and hands-on applications to farmers, ranchers, foresters, communities, and 4-H members. This cooperative partnership between NIFA, state, and local governments leverages university expertise for research and education and provides local Extension offices in U.S. counties/county equivalents that directly serve the people.\nThe transformation from CSREES to NIFA began with a task force chaired by William Henry Danforth and appointed by then Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman. The Danforth Task Force recommended that Congress authorize the creation of NIFA as a way to strengthen agriculture research and to attract additional highly competitive research scientists to this field of endeavor. A growing program in competitive research grants will be a hallmark of the new agency. The creation of NIFA strengthened USDA's competitive research portfolio by replacing the National Research Initiative with the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. NIFA awards research funding through a combination of competitive grants and funds allocated to states under statutory formulas.\nRelocation\nIn 2019, NIFA relocated 294 out of 315 staff members from Washington DC to Kansas City. The move was part of a larger uprooting including the Economic Research Service. The USDA cited the move was an effort to attract talent and lower costs by establishing an operational headquarters. The Government Accountability Office reported the agency violated the Antideficiency Act. Between 40-60% of employees left the agency after receiving the ultimatum to move or leave the agency. Black employees previously holding 47% of roles dropped to 19% post relocation. After the move NIFA employees voted to unionize under the American Federation of Government Employees. Due to Congressional concern, the Conducting Oversight to Secure Transparency (COST) of Relocations Act was proposed, but did not become law.\nDuring the Biden administration, NIFA headquarters moved back to Washington, DC, while the Kansas City office was retained.\nSee also\n* Agriculture Innovation Center\n* Electrical energy efficiency on United States farms\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-institute-of-food-and-agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture] in the Federal Register\n* [https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/012-1500 Research and Education Activities] account on USAspending.gov\n* [https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/012-0502 Extension Activities] account on USAspending.gov\n* [https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/012-1502 Integrated Activities] account on USAspending.gov"
