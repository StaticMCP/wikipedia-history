It was presented in the 2019 Spanish general election and was led by Albano Dante Fachin, Maribel Rodríguez, Guillem Fuster, Mireia Caldés and Roger Español.\nThe coalition fielded candidates in all four Catalan constituencies in the election. It won 113,807 votes, 2.8% of the total vote in Catalonia, placing eighth overall. However, the coalition fell below the 3% electoral threshold in all but one constituency (Girona), and failed to elect any deputies.\nOn May 15, 2019 the three constituent parties of the Republican Front decided to dissolve the coalition. Poble Lliure and the Pirates have both endorsed the candidacy of Popular Unity Candidacy (Catalan: ''Candidatura d'Unitat Popular, CUP) for the November 2019 election.\nComposition\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n|-\n| width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"\"|\n| Free People (PL–PPCC)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|\n| We Are Alternative (Som Alternativa)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|\n| Pirates of Catalonia (Pirata.cat)\n|}\nElectoral results\nCortes Generales\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"11\"| Cortes Generales\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Election\n! colspan=\"7\"| Congress\n! colspan=\"2\"| Senate\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Status\n|-\n!
