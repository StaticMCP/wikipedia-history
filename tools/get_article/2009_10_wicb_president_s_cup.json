The competition was played as a standalone tournament, with all matches held in Guyana.\nEight teams contested the competition – the six regular teams of West Indian domestic cricket (Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands), and two development teams (Combined Campuses and Colleges and the West Indies under-19 side). The group stages were heavily impacted by rain – out of twelve matches in total, four were shortened, two ended in no result, and five were abandoned entirely. The final was played at Guyana National Stadium in Providence, with Trinidad and Tobago defeating Guyana by 81 runs to claim their tenth domestic one-day title (and second in a row). Guyana's Narsingh Deonarine led the tournament in runs, while his teammate Royston Crandon and Trinidad's Dwayne Bravo were the equal leading wicket-takers.\nSquads\n{| class=\"wikitable\"
