The growing demand was a result of excess usage of sister venue Western Park and the proposed closure of the football facilities at Logan Park (due to redevelopment of the existing harness racing track).\nEastern Park incorporates a junior sized football oval, adventure playground, multi purpose pavilion, The Green Shed Theatre and numerous walking tracks.\nEastern Park was recently included in the Baw Baw Shires 'Warragul Outdoor Recreational Plan' which involves upgrades of the sporting surface, playground and parking.\nHome of the Colts Junior Football Club, Eastern Park provides Australian Rules Football for children aged 7 to 18 in 4 age groups including Under 10's, Under 12's, Under 14.5's and Youth Girls in the Gippsland Youth Girls League.\nEastern Park is the home of the Warragul Cricket Club, the Warragul Cricket Club hosted the GCL senior grand final for 2010/11 season, as well as the T/20 grand final for the WDCA in 2010/11.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bawbawshire.vic.gov.au/ Baw Baw Shire]\n*[https://archive.today/20140508130555/http://www.coltsjfc.com.au/ Colts Junior Football Club]"
