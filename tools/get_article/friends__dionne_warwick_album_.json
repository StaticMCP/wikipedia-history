It was released by Arista Records on November 25, 1985 in the United States. Her seventh album with the label, it was executive produced by Clive Davis, who consulted frequent collaborators Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, Albhy Galuten, Barry Manilow, and Stevie Wonder as well as Narada Michael Walden and David Foster to work with Warwick.\nFollowing a series of lukewarm commercial successes, Friends marked a return to form for Warwick. Her highest-charting album since Dionne (1979), it peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard 200 and went gold in Canada and the US. At the 1987 Grammy Awards, the album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female. Friends yielded the worldwide top ten single \"That's What Friends Are For\", which became Warwick's biggest US hit, spending four weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. A second single, \"Whisper in the Dark\", was released in 1986.\nTrack listing\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 4:15\n| title2          = Whisper in the Dark\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          = Albhy Galuten\n| length2         = 4:35\n| title3          = Remember Your Heart\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          = Galuten\n| length3         = 3:43\n| title4          = Love at Second Sight\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Foster\n| length4         = 4:40\n| title5          = Moments Aren't Moments\n| writer5         = Stevie Wonder\n| extra5          = Wonder\n| length5         = 4:36\n}}\n| extra6          =\n| length6         = 3:22\n| title7          = Stay Devoted\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          =\n| length7         = 3:36\n| title8          = No One There (To Sing Me a Love Song)\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          =\n| length8         = 4:28\n| title9          = How Long?\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          =\n| length9         = 4:12\n| title10         = Extravagant Gestures\n| writer10        =\n| extra10         =\n| length10        = 4:59\n}}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for Friends\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1985–1986)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n| 29\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Top 100 Albums (RPM)\n| 16\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Pop Albums (Billboard)\n| 12\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Black Albums (Billboard)\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top 100 Albums (Cash Box)\n| 14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top 75 Black Contemporary Albums (Cash Box)\n| 4\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for Friends\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1986)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Top 100 Albums (RPM)\n| 82\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Pop Albums (Billboard)\n| 89\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Black Albums (Billboard)\n| 38\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top 75 Black Contemporary Albums (Cash Box)\n| 30\n|}\nCertifications and sales\nReferences\nExternal links"
