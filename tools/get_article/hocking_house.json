It is a -story, three-bay, hip-roofed dwelling, built about 1855 in the transitional Greek Revival-Italianate architecture style. The land on which the home stands was part of the estate of Robert Clarke Sr., one of the original settlers of the area that is now Frostburg. It was converted into a clubhouse in 1942.\nHocking House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*, including undated photo, at Maryland Historical Trust"
