It is one of two separate ABA-accredited law schools of Widener University. Widener University Law School was founded in 1971 as the Delaware Law School and became affiliated with Widener in 1975. In 1989, it was known as Widener University School of Law when it was combined with the campus in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In 2015, the two campuses separated, with the Harrisburg one renamed to Widener University Commonwealth Law School.\nHistory\nFounded in 1971 as The Delaware Law School, the institution became affiliated with then Widener College, later becoming Widener University in 1975 and graduated its first class of 267 in August of that year. The school's name was officially changed to Widener University School of Law in 1989 when the Harrisburg campus was added. On July 1, 2015, the two campuses were separated into two distinct law schools, called respectively, Widener University Delaware Law School, and Widener University Commonwealth Law School, which operate independently of each other, but remain part of the university. Each law school has its own dean, faculty, students, and curriculum.\nCampus\nLocated in Wilmington, Delaware Law School's 40-acre campus is home to 686 students.\nAcademics\nWidener's legal education program included legal clinics that specialize in environmental law, criminal defense, and civil law, which includes family law, and legal assistance on veteran benefits cases.
