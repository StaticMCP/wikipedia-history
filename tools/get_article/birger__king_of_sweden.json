In order to secure the succession, King Magnus had Birger hailed king of Sweden when he was four years old. In 1275, Magnus had led a rebellion against his elder brother, King Valdemar, and ousted him from the throne. Before his death, Magnus ordered his kinsman, Torkel Knutsson, the Constable of the Realm, to be Birger's guardian. In 1302, Birger was crowned at Söderköping after marrying Martha of Denmark, the daughter of King Eric V of Denmark.\nReign\nBirger was only ten years old when his father died, at which time Torkel Knutsson was the most influential statesman in Sweden. In 1293, Torkel Knutsson led the Swedes to a victory which won a part of western Karelia. This expedition has traditionally been dubbed as the Third Swedish Crusade. When Torkel Knutsson returned from leading the crusade in Finland, a feud had developed between the brothers. Torkel Knutsson supported King Birger.\nBirger came of age when there was a conflict within the Church of Sweden over interpretation of the Privileges of 1280, which had been the cost of the support of the Church for his father's usurpation. The king's brothers, dukes Erik and Valdemar, took advantage of this conflict. Duke Erik tried to establish an independent kingdom around Bohuslän, which he had received as part of his marriage to the Norwegian princess Ingeborg, and Halland at the boundary between Sweden, Norway and Denmark. A civil war broke out, but by 1306 emotions had cooled to the point where the dukes acknowledged Birger's son, Magnus, as the successor to the throne. Torkel Knutsson, who was Duke Valdemar's father-in-law, was executed in 1306 as a token of reconciliation between King Birger and his brothers. The same year, in an event known as the Håtuna games (Håtunaleken), Birger was taken captive by his brothers on the Håtuna royal estate in Uppland and taken as prisoner to Nyköping Castle (Nyköpingshus).\nIn 1308, Erik and Valdemar were forced by the Danish king to release King Birger, but they did so under humiliating conditions. When King Birger was free, he sought aid in Denmark, and the strife began anew.  Birger remained king in name, but had to give up the Royal Domain, exchanging it for eastern Uppland, Närke, his brother Erik's former Duchy Södermanland, Östergötland, Gotland and the Castle of Viborg.\nIn 1312,  Duke Erik married Ingeborg of Norway, daughter of King Haakon V of Norway  in a double wedding in Oslo.  At the same time, Duke Valdemar married Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway, the daughter of King Eric II of Norway.\nDuke Erik also held Bohuslän from Norway as well as northern Halland and was creating a separate kingdom centered on Göta älv. In 1317 however, Birger captured his brothers during the Nyköping Banquet (Nyköpings gästabud), which led to their death. According to Erik's Chronicle (Erikskrönikan), the dukes were starved to death in a cellar of Nyköping Castle.\nBirger was ousted by his brothers' supporters in 1318 and eventually went into exile under his brother-in-law King Eric VI of Denmark, taking the Royal Archives with him. His 18-year-old son Magnus had arrived that year with Danish troops to save Birger but an army under Canute Porse defeated them at Söderköping, practically putting an end to the conflict. Birger first fled to Gotland and left Magnus to defend the important Stegeborg Castle. Magnus was captured there only to be executed in Stockholm in 1320, with a younger brother Erik having died the year before and ex-king Birger dying in Denmark the year after. In 1319, the three-year-old son of Duke Erik, also called Magnus, had then already been hailed King of Sweden after the short regency of his mother Duchess Ingeborg.\nChildren\nBirger had the following children with Martha:\n* Magnus (c. 1300  1320), executed in Sweden\n* Erik (d. 1319), archdeacon in Uppsala; died in exile\n* Third son of unknown name\n* Agnes (d. after 1344), a nun in Slangerup Abbey\n* Katarina (d. after 1320); she accompanied Birger and Martha in exile\nModern depiction\nIn 2003, the band Falconer released The Sceptre of Deception, a concept album based on this period of Swedish history. The album  covers events during the reign of King Birger of Sweden and lengthy strife with his brothers, and the Danish and Norwegian crowns.\nReferences\nOther sources\n* Barck, Sven Eric;  Persson, Åke Kungligt skvaller genom tusen år : En annorlunda bok om svensk historia  (Sundbyberg:  Semic, 2000)\n* Lindqvist, Herman  Historien om Sverige.
