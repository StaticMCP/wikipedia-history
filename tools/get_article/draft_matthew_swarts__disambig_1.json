His work explores themes of intimacy, distance, and the fragmentation of personal connections in the digital age.\nEarly life and education\nSwarts was born in 1970 and attended Princeton University, where he studied Ethics and the Philosophy of Value, graduating with an A.B. with honors in Philosophy in 1992. His philosophical background in ethics and value theory significantly influences his artistic practice and approach to questioning the nature of photographic truth and representation.\nFollowing his undergraduate studies, Swarts pursued graduate work at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where he earned an MFA in Photography and Digital Imaging in 1997. During his graduate studies, he developed his foundational understanding of both traditional photographic techniques and emerging digital technologies, which would become central to his artistic practice.\nArtistic practice\nSwarts's technical process involves complex digital layering and manipulation that transforms personal photographs into what has been described as \"psychoactive masterpieces\". Swarts begins with original photographs, typically portraits, and then overlays them with diverse digital abstractions including optical illusions, elements sourced from mathematics and physics, children's illustrations, architectural drawings, maps, and other abstract information. He creates what he terms \"screens\" that cover and modulate the original photographic content, complicating the politics of looking and bending the narrative of the photograph.\nThe artist's process involves compositing portraits with various digital tools, surfaces, and forms, often repeating patterns, sharpening, bending, and virtually destroying the source images to create layered visual experiences. Swarts also employs unconventional techniques, including using broken printers, fax machines, and copy machines to create and complicate the possibilities for how each image looks and feels. His work often incorporates appropriated web artifacts, woven patterns rendered at extremely high resolution, and other pieces of digitized information.\nNotable projects\nChildren with Cancer (1996–2000)\nSwarts's significant early work, Children with Cancer, was created between 1996 and 2000 during his graduate studies. This series represents a collaboration with over thirty-five young people and their families from the Boston area, ranging in age from ten months to twenty-seven years, all of whom were undergoing treatment for various cancers at the time. The project aimed to create a body of work that would contrast with much of the existing photographic record of disease by focusing on the young people themselves and their uniqueness rather than concentrating on medical procedures, doctors, and technology. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston first collected Swarts's work in 1997, purchasing several prints from this graduate thesis project.\nBeth and The Alternatives\nSwarts's artistic breakthrough came with his series Beth and The Alternatives, which originated from reworking personal photographs after the end of a long-term relationship. The Beth series began as intimate portraits of his partner, created during a time when both were experiencing family disruptions. When the relationship ended, Swarts found himself with an archive of personal photographs depicting someone he felt he no longer knew or understood.\nUsing digital tools, he began creating new images where his former partner's recognizable photographic identity was either removed, concealed, or partially obfuscated. The process involved layering the original portraits with scanned patterns from graph paper, architectural drawings, optical test patterns, and children's illustrations for visual illusions. This technique transformed the photographs into what Swarts describes as portraits where the physical structure of some previous moment has been preserved and rebuilt in such a way as to reclaim his full authorship of an experience that was once highly collaborative.\nThe Alternatives evolved as Swarts entered a new relationship, using blurred and obscured images as a metaphor for the uncertainty and complexity of forging new relationships. The resulting images are both enticing and disorienting, creating what has been described as an \"aesthetic acid-trip\" that makes viewers' heads hurt yet somehow can't avert their eyes.\nBranches (2021–2024)\nSwarts's project BRANCHES, conducted from 2021 to 2024 in Cambridge and Somerville, Massachusetts, represents his inquiry into urban tree life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living in Somerville, one of the most densely populated urban areas in New England, Swarts found solace during the pandemic in daily walks where he would look upward toward the trees. The project is inspired by a quote from Aesop: \"When the woodcutter enters the forest, the trees all murmur, the handle of the axe is one of us\".\nBRANCHES is an ongoing composite of tree data collected with various camera devices during Swarts's morning walks. Each file is meticulously built inside Photoshop from composite parts, with dimensions variable to 40-inch widths. The project reflects Swarts's method of reweaving an imaginary canopy within the urban environment, where it is sometimes difficult to feel the expanse of the forest.\nAwards and recognition\nSwarts is the recipient of several prestigious awards, including the J. William Fulbright Scholar Grant and the Ruttenberg Arts Foundation Award for the best new work nationally in photographic portraiture.\nTeaching career\nSwarts has maintained an extensive teaching career, serving on the faculty at numerous prestigious institutions including Amherst College, Bowdoin College, Ramapo College of New Jersey, the University of Connecticut, the University of Massachusetts Boston, Middlesex College, the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, and the Community College of Rhode Island.\nCollections and exhibitions\nSwarts's work is held in numerous prestigious public collections, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; the George Eastman Museum, Rochester, New York; the Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; Transformer Station, Cleveland, Ohio; the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park, Lincoln, Massachusetts; Light Work, Syracuse, New York; Princeton University; the FLAK Photo Collection; the Polaroid Collection; and the Museum of New Art.\nHis work has been featured in significant exhibitions, including solo shows at Kopeikin Gallery in Los Angeles, notably \"Processing: Beth and the Alternatives\" in 2015. He has participated in important group exhibitions such as \"A Matter of Memory: Photography as Object in the Digital Age\" at the George Eastman Museum (2016-2017).\nPublications and media coverage\nSwarts's work has been featured extensively in major publications including The New York Times Magazine, WIRED, Slate, DEAR DAVE, GUP Magazine, FLAK Photo, Conscientious Photography Magazine, Doubletake Magazine, Contact Sheet, Afterimage, Fotophile, and In the Loupe.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://matthewswarts.org/ Official website]"
