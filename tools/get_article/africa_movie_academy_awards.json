The award was founded by Peace Anyiam-Osigwe currently run by the Africa Film Academy. It is regarded as one of Africa's most notable film events, and have been sometimes referenced as the \"African Oscars\".\nHistory\nThe first Africa Movie Academy Awards was held in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State,  Nigeria, on 30 May 2005. All other subsequent African Academy Awards before 2012 were held at the same venue, except for the 2008 AMAA Awards, which was moved to Abuja, FCT, for security reasons. In 2012, the awards ceremony was held at Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, in Lagos State. The 9th and 10th edition saw AMAA returning to Yenagoa, while the 2015 ceremony was held outside Nigeria for the first time.\nThey have been hosted in various Nigerian cities, usually in Lagos, and once internationally in Kigali, Rwanda, in the year 2018. The ceremonies have been held at different venues within these locations, including the Jewel Aeida Hall, Eko Hotels and Suites, Balmoral Center, and the Landmark Event Centre in Lagos. Over time, the AMAA has expanded its reach beyond Nigeria. Though detailed archival venue data is limited, ceremonies have drawn global attention, through strategic host cities and online formats particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach reflects AMAA's evolving commitment to inclusion and accessibility across the African continent and beyond.\nJury members\n* Berni Goldblat 2007–present\n* John Akomfrah\n* Steve Ayorinde 2005–2015\n* Keith Shiri\n* June Givanni\n* Hyginus Ekwuazi\n* Shaibu Husseini\n* Ayoku Babu\n* Asantewa Olatunji\n* Dorothee Wenner 2005–present\n* Charles Burnett 2014–present\n* Filippe Savadogo 2014–present\n* Amaka Igwe 2005\nCategories\nholding,the 2021 Michael Anyiam Osigwe Award for Best Film by an African Living Abroad]]\nAs of 2017, the Africa Movie Academy Awards had 28 merit categories.
