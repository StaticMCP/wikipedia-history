A manga adaptation with art by Harutsugu Nadaka has been serialized in ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Maoh since July 2020. Both the light novel and manga are licensed in North America by Yen Press. An anime television series adaptation produced by Diomedéa aired from January to March 2023.\nPlot\nPrincess Anisphia, regaining the memories of a previous life she lived in a modern world while retaining the memories of her current life at a young age, has a love of magic, despite being unable to use it herself.  She sets off to live out her dreams in the fantasy world she finds herself growing up in. During a magical mishap, she stumbled upon a scene where her brother Algard has broken off his engagement to his fiancée, Lady Euphyllia. With Euphyllia stripped of her title as the kingdom's next Queen, Anisphia offers for Euphyllia to come live and research magic with her as an assistant.  Fulfilling her dream of learning to use magic to fly and as a way to restore Euphyllia's good name.\nCharacters\nMain\n;\n:\n: The main protagonist and the first princess of the Kingdom of Palettia. She has always loved magic yet, being reincarnated from Earth, cannot use it herself. So to compensate, she turned to science and used her previous life's knowledge to invent all sorts of magical gadgets. She is also an out lesbian. While her eccentricities cause others to see her as a problem child who forced her responsibilities onto her younger brother, Algard, she actually thinks of her country and people more than anyone, ceding the throne out of a genuine belief that she would not be a good ruler. Following a fight with a dragon, she gets afflicted with a curse that is now slowly turning her into a dragon herself.\n;  /\n:\n: A high-ranking noble and the ex-fiancé of Anisphia's younger brother, after he broke off their engagement for allegedly bullying his genuine love interest. While talented in magic and politics, she initially kept others away with her perfectionist attitude but slowly opened up after being taken in by Anisphia and even began to develop romantic feelings toward her. She is later adopted into the royal family after completing a Spirit Covenant and becomes eligible for the throne, so it would not be forced onto Anisphia after Algard is disowned. However, the Covenant has also turned her into a spirit reliant on magical energy to survive, which she takes from Anisphia through kisses.\nMain supporting\n;\n:\n: Anisphia's maid. She has a deep loyalty to her, having been helped by her in the past, and shares a sisterly bond with her instead of master and servant. Since Anis treats her with respect and as an equal, Ilia cut off ties to her family, who only saw her as a pawn.\n;\n:\n: A commoner-turned-noble and Algard's love interest whom Euphie allegedly bullied, though it was really just a misunderstanding. It is eventually revealed she is actually a vampire who constantly gives off a charm which makes people infatuated with her, which she herself was unaware of. Following this, she is taken in by Anisphia so she may learn to control her abilities, which she repays by working for her as a maid. However, awakening to her true nature caused her blood cravings to manifest which Ilia helps alleviate by letting her suck hers, causing her to develop romantic feelings for the latter.\n;\n:\n:A noblewoman who was disowned by her family and Anisphia's best friend. Though born with powerful magic, her body cannot handle it, causing her pain whenever she uses it. This, along with noble society's focus on magic, eventually caused her to snap and lash out against her family, becoming an infamous sadist, until Anisphia stopped her rampage. At present, she has taken to developing drugs and often supports Anisphia in her research. Her past has led her to become obsessed with incurable conditions, which she calls \"curses\".\nSecondary supporting\n;\n:\n:Anisphia's father and the king of the Kingdom of Palettia. While he truly cares for his children, his royal responsibilities force him to put his country first. The stress of ruling has also negatively impacted his health, looking older than he actually is and taking pills for regular stomach aches, which is not helped by his daughter's antics.\n;\n:\n:Anisphia's mother and the queen of the Kingdom of Palettia. Though youthful in appearance, when she was actually young she was a fearsome warrior who raised her children in her spartan ways, making her the only person Anisphia fears. However, she cares greatly for her children and later mellows out considerably following Algard's failed coup, believing she had failed as a mother.\n;\n:\n:Euphyllia's father and the prime minister of the Kingdom of Palettia. While he initially had a somewhat strained relationship with his daughter, after her engagement is canceled he realizes that he had impossible expectations of her and apologizes, causing their bond to improve considerably. However, he is later forced to cut her off after she is adopted into the royal family for political reasons.\n;\n:\n:The ancestor of the royal family of the Kingdom of Palettia. While seemingly around the same age as Anisphia, having completed a Spirit Covenant, she is actually a human-turned-spirit who is close to a thousand years old.\nAntagonists\n;\n:\n:Anisphia's younger brother and the crown prince of the Kingdom of Palettia, as his sister gave up her right to the throne. He is also Euphyllia's ex-fiancé, after he broke off their engagement for allegedly bullying Lainie, his apparent love interest. It is eventually revealed that he has always admired his sister, which drove him to plot a revolution to purge the country's corrupt nobles who treated her as second-class due to their culture and religion of magical elitism. He steals Lainie's vampiric abilities to enact his plan to brainwash nobles and rule with power completely centralised to the Crown. In the end, while reconciling with Anisphia, he is disinherited and exiled for his attempted coup d'etat.\n;\n:\n:Count Chartreuse's son and Algard's friend who supported him in breaking off his engagement with Euphyllia. It is later revealed that he was the only one in Algard's inner circle who was not under Lainie's charm and played an active role in the prince's attempted revolution, causing him to be arrested after the plot is exposed.\n;\n:\n:The minister of magic who opposes any changes that might endanger the nobles' authority, like Anisphia's inventions. He had been secretly manipulating Algard for years to turn him into a puppet ruler under his control and played an active role in the prince's attempted revolution, unaware that the latter was planning on eventually double-crossing him. In the end, he is executed for treason after the plot is exposed.\nMinor\n;\n:\n:A blacksmith and an acquaintance of Anisphia who helps forge her magical tools from materials she brings him.\n;\n:Lainie's father and an adventurer-turned-noble. He met Laine's mother before his ascension, unaware she was a vampire, and later took his illegitimate daughter in after she died. He is also an overprotective father, having reservations about his daughter staying with Anisphia after her vampiric nature is revealed but ultimately letting her go.\n;\n:The head of the Kingdom of Palettia's knight order and an acquaintance of Anisphia. He grew estranged from his son, Navre, after the boy supported Algard in breaking off his engagement to Euphyllia. However, the two began to repair their familial bond after Anisphia discovered that Lainie had accidentally charmed Navre and snapped him out of it.\n;\n:Matthew's son and Algard's friend who supported him in breaking off his engagement with Euphyllia. It is later revealed, however, that Lainie had accidentally charmed him and he snapped out of it after Anisphia called him out for his actions.\n;\n:The son of an influential merchant and Algard's friend who supported him in breaking off his engagement with Euphyllia. It is later revealed, however, that Lainie had accidentally charmed him.\nMedia\nLight novels\nThe series written by Piero Karasu was originally serialized online between February 2019 and August 2021 on the user-generated novel publishing website Shōsetsuka ni Narō.

So to compensate, she used her memories of her previous life on Earth to invent all sorts of magical gadgets in hopes of one day achieving her dream of flying through the sky on a magic broom. Unfortunately, this also led her to become a troublemaker who pushed her responsibilities onto her younger brother, Algard. As part of his duties, the crown prince has an arranged marriage with Euphyllia, the daughter of his father's adviser. However, despite the young lady's attempts to get their relationship to work, there is no love between them, and Algard recently developed an interest in a commoner-turned-noble named Lainie. In the end, the situation escalates after Euphyllia's request to Lainie to sever her relationship with Algard for the greater good of the Kingdom is interpreted as bullying and the crown prince publicly cancels their engagement. Just then, though, Anisphia crash lands onto the scene following a failed flight test. Quickly realizing what is going on, the princess \"kidnaps\" Euphyllia and flees the scene before the young lady's reputation is damaged further.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Taking Euphyllia to their parents, king Orfans and prime minister Grantz, Anisphia informs them about Algard breaking off the engagement, much to their shock. As they wonder what is to become of Euphyllia, Anisphia offers to take her in as a research assistant and split the profits between them, doing a pretty bad job at hiding that she has a crush on her. Nonetheless, Grantz agrees to it as it would help repair her reputation and apologizes to his daughter for placing unreachable expectations upon her. Afterward, Euphyllia moves into Anisphia's residence, the Separate Palace. While impressed by the results of the princess' research, seeing how it could be helpful to commoners, she is also concerned about how the nobles would react to such a threat to their authority. Later, whilst sharing a bed, Euphyllia asks Anisphia why she would go so far to help her, to which the princess replies that she just could not stand how sad she looked when her engagement got canceled and tells her to just rest for now.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Sometime after moving in with Anisphia, Euphyllia still has trouble getting used to her new life and laments how she lacks a purpose now that her engagement has been canceled. The princess tries bonding with her whilst testing out some magic tools, but she remains distant. Meanwhile, Orfans and Grantz launch an investigation into the engagement cancellation incident and summon Euphyllia to give testimony, during which she also returns the privileges previously granted to her by her engagement. Later, Anisphia tries to cheer Euphyllia up with a present, a magical sword named Arc-en-Ciel crafted specifically for her. Euphyllia thanks Anisphia for her gift just as the princess collapses from sleep deprivation, having not rested the whole time she was forging the sword. As she lets Anisphia sleep on her lap, Euphyllia expresses that she wishes she could be free like her.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Upon waking up, Anisphia finds that Euphyllia has not been sleeping properly either and carries her off to bed. Whilst laying there, Euphyllia expresses how empty she feels without a direction in life and begs Anisphia to give one, but the princess just calmly tells her that they will find it together. The next day, Euphyllia confides in Anisphia's maid, Ilia, about her struggles to find meaning in things unrelated to her given role, prompting the latter to tell her about her own past struggles with finding one's purpose. Just then, however, Anisphia receives notice from the Adventurers' Guild, of which she is a high-ranking member, that a dragon has appeared. Wishing to claim the creature's body for her research, the princess intends to confront it and Euphyllia insists on going along as well. Meanwhile, the country's leadership holds an emergency meeting regarding the dragon where Algard, who has been under house arrest ever since the engagement cancellation, proposes to personally face it. Realizing that his son just wishes to prove himself, Orfans is about to give permission when he is informed that Anisphia and Euphyllia have already set out.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Arriving on the battlefield, Anisphia and Euphyllia aid the adventurers and knights in fighting off a stampede caused by monsters fleeing the dragon. Increasing her strength with a magical medicine she developed, the princess fights her way through the horde to the dragon and faces it in mid-air with her magic broom. However, the creature protects itself from her gadgets with a magical barrier and shoots her down with a breath attack. Fortunately, Euphyllia saves her. While Euphyllia begs her to flee, Anisphia believes that she has to defeat the dragon to be a \"magician\", causing the young lady to change her mind and help the princess. Taking on the dragon together, they pierce its barrier and defeat it by cutting right through its breath attack using a magic sword. Following its defeat, the dragon telepathically congratulates Anisphia before \"cursing\" her by seemingly transferring its own soul into her. Afterward, Anisphia and Euphyllia attend a victory party but the princess struggles to fit in while the young lady finds herself uncomfortable around men following the engagement cancellation incident, prompting them to instead dance with each other outside on the balcony.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Anisphia visits her research partner, Tilty, to discuss her plans for the materials she got from the dragon. To stop the creature's \"curse\" from encroaching on her, Anisphia has Tilty tattoo the materials onto her back, allowing her to use its magic whilst retaining her humanity. At the same time, she is called in by her mother, Sylphine, to aid in the investigation into the engagement cancellation incident. Questioning one of Algard's friends who sided with him, Anisphia discovers that he does not remember anything from the incident. The next day, Lainie and her father, baron Drax, are called in for interrogation. While Lainie claims to not have had any romantic interest in Algard and Orfans believes her, Anisphia realizes something is off and takes her to speak in private. Examining her, the princess realizes what is going on: Lainie constantly gives off a charm and makes others infatuated with her. Informing her parents, it is decided that Lainie will move in with Anisphia to learn to control her ability. Elsewhere, Algard converses with the minister of magic, Count Chartreuse, about how they will need to step up their plans now that Lainie has been discovered.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Upon moving into the Separate Palace, Lainie quickly reconciles with Euphyllia regarding her part in the engagement cancellation. Bringing in Tilty to examine Lainie, she and Anisphia quickly realize the origin of her charm ability: she is a vampire; a race born from a mad magician's attempts to become immortal. While they manage to teach her to control her ability, this also causes her blood cravings to manifest, which Ilia helps alleviate by letting her suck hers. Meanwhile, Euphyllia becomes envious of Tilty upon seeing how well she and Anisphia work together. In response, Tilty tells her that, with her reputation having been restored following the dragon fight, she must make up her mind to either fully support Anisphia or not at all. Later, Anisphia is requested to do a lecture on her inventions. However, the audience, composed of nobles opposed to her research, constantly ridicules her. Fortunately, Euphyllia then takes over as spokesperson and convinces everyone of the advantages that the princess' gadgets could bring before revealing a design for a mass-produced version of her flying broom, leaving Anisphia feeling grateful to her for standing up for her.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = At the Separate Palace, an alarm suddenly goes off, meaning someone infiltrated the residence. Ilia and Lainie try to flee but are intercepted by the assailant, who is revealed to be Algard. Meanwhile, at the post-lecture party, one of Algard's friends who attended the presentation, Moritz Chartreuse, constantly tries to start a conversation with Anisphia, much to her annoyance. However, upon hearing the alarm going off, the princess realizes that the lecture was a distraction and rushes back with Euphyllia while Tilty restrains the guards using her magic. Upon arriving, Anisphia and Euphyllia find Ilia and Lainie mortally wounded at Algard's hand, who ripped out the magic crystal that is the source of Lainie's powers from her body and put it in himself to become a vampire as well. While Euphyllia heals Ilia and Lainie with her magic, Anisphia questions Algard's motives, to which he reveals that the kingdom was grown corrupt so he intends to start a \"revolution\" to overturn the current order. Realizing her brother is just suffering from an inferiority complex toward her, Anisphia rejects his vision and prepares to fight him to stop him.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Anisphia faces off against Algard but is slowly being pressured. Meanwhile, Euphyllia continues healing Ilia and Lainie but finds the latter's wounds to be too severe. Fortunately, Ilia force-feeds the vampire her blood, causing her to regenerate. Back with Anisphia, using her newly acquired dragon magic, the princess turns the tide and is about to deliver the finishing blow but is stopped by Euphyllia. With Algard yielding, the siblings then have a heart-to-heart during which the prince reveals that he always knew Anisphia would make a better ruler than him and hated his magic-obsessed country for rejecting her. In the aftermath, Algard takes full responsibility for his crimes and Orfans disinherits him. The truth of the engagement cancellation incident is also finally revealed: it was part of a plot orchestrated by Count Chartreuse to brainwash high-ranking nobles using Lainie's charm. On the day of Algard's exile from the palace, Euphyllia and Lainie confront him. In the end, Lainie forgives him while he and Euphyllia both admit to their own part in their relationship falling apart. Algard requests Euphyllia take care of Anisphia before departing, after which the young lady returns to the recovering princess' bedside.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Following Algard's disinheritance, Anisphia is now the de facto heir to the throne, a position which she reluctantly accepts. Euphyllia offers the princess her assistance but she is adamant that it is not her concern. Tilty, however, is angered by Anisphia putting up a happy facade whilst resigning herself to her royal obligations. Euphyllia soon begins to understand Tilty's perspective following an excursion into town with Anisphia and witnessing the princess' laboratory cleared out: if Anisphia becomes queen her freedom will be restricted and she would be unable to pursue her research. Euphyllia then confronts her father, Grantz, with her wish for Anisphia not to have the throne pushed upon her and he reveals that there is a way. However, he is interrupted by the sudden arrival of a mysterious girl named Lumielle. The girl reveals that the kingdom's first king entered into a covenant with a great spirit and that Euphyllia has the qualifications to do so as well, making her eligible for the throne provided she succeeds.

Euphyllia reveals that she has the qualifications for a Spirit Covenant and intends to do so under the provision that the King adopt her so she might inherit the throne. Despite Anisphia objecting upon learning from Lumielle that Spirit Covenanters are immortal, condemning them to solitude, the young lady remains undeterred, set on \"protecting the princess' smile\". However, Anisphia grows angered at her for trying to \"steal her identity\" and runs off in tears before being found by Tilty. At Tilty's place, the princess opens up to her about always having felt like an outcast, to which the latter simply proposes they run away but the former turns her down since \"she is a princess\". Euphyllia then arrives and has a heart-to-heart with Anisphia during which the latter reveals that she has always been jealous of the magic prodigy whilst lamenting being a failure as a royal. In the end, the princess remains unwilling to give up her birthright or sacrifice Euphyllia's humanity. So, with neither of them backing down, Anisphia proposes they settle their argument through a duel.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The two duel furiously with swords and spells, saying they want to spare the other the burden of being Queen. During the duel, Euphyllia completes her Spirit Covenant, eliminating Anisphia's reason to fight her. Euphyllia defeats Anisphia with a rainbow beam, then says Anisphia was the reason she became strong. Anisphia apologizes to her parents, but they express pride in her. Later, Anisphia visits Euphyllia's bedroom, tells her about her previous life on Earth, then expresses her fears that she might be a \"fake\" who erased the real Anisphia's soul. Euphyllia assures her that is not true, then confesses her love and kisses her. The next day, the King and Queen step down and make Euphyllia the Queen, charging Anisphia to take care of her. They reveal their plans to make magic available to everyone and slowly dissolve the lines between commoners and nobles. Working together, they commission the invention of flying machines. Euphyllia gifts Anisphia a magic sword called \"Celestial\". At the flying machines' demonstration, the two reveal clothes that allow the wearer to fly and demonstrate them along with spectacular displays of magic.

Anime UK News gave the first volume an 8 out of 10 rating, commenting that \"Piero Karasu manages to capture the delicate balance of keeping things light-hearted and also emotional when it needs to be.\" In Anime News Network's 2022 Spring Light Novel Guide gave it a 3 out of 5 rating, Silverman notes that \"Piero Karasu has a nice touch with the girls' attraction to each other that makes the romance really slow and sweet.\" however she criticises that this is \"buried under too many pages of world building and explanation.\"\nFor Anime News Network's 2022 Spring Manga Guide, the manga adaption was given a 3 and half out of 5 rating. Silverman notes that while the light novel struggles to find a balance between world-building and plots, as well as having too many narrative voices that all sound alike, these issues \"are largely absent from Harustugu Nadaka's manga version. In part this is simply because the manga format, with its use of speech and thought bubbles, negates the need for the confusing narration found in the book\" Erica Friedman, the founder of Yuricon, notes that while the first volume of light novel left her feeling uninspired, the manga was well done enough for her to continue reading the series, \"You want to know what the grand experiment is and how Euphyllia can help Anisphia and you cheer for them both as they launch themselves into a grand adventure. [...] now I’m kind of interested in reading more of the manga to see what happens.\"\nWriting for Anime Feminist, Vrai Kaiser praised the anime adaptation for its comedy, characters, and lack of sexualization of its characters, and expressed interest in the series as a new contribution to \"genre yuri\" such as The Executioner and Her Way of Life and Otherside Picnic.\nSee also\n* Yūsha Party o Oidasareta Kiyōbinbō, another light novel series with the same illustrator\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Shōsetsuka ni Narō\n*\n*\n*\n*"
