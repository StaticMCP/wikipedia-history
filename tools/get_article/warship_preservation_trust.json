This was as a result of a decision to redevelop the adjacent Grade II listed former flour milling warehouses. Without a replacement berthing agreement, the Trust subsequently went into voluntary liquidation.\nBy default, ownership of the collection transferred to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC) following the demise of the Trust.\nFate of collection\nHMS Plymouth\nPlymouth City Council had expressed an interest in HMS Plymouth, and the HMS Plymouth Preservation Trust undertook to raise the £250,000 needed to bring the warship back to her home city.\nIt had been hoped that the frigate could be berthed at Millbay Docks, but the offer of a berth was withdrawn in January 2007 by Associated British Ports.\nHMS Onyx\nIn May 2006 HMS Onyx was sold to the Barrow-in-Furness businessman Joe Mullen, for a reported £100,000 as a 'gift to the people of Barrow'.  It left Birkenhead on 13 June 2006 to form the centrepiece of a new heritage museum in Cumbria. However, with this new museum also running into difficulty, as of July 2014, the Onyx has since been scrapped.\nU-534\nOn 27 June 2007, the Merseytravel transit authority announced that it had acquired U-534 to display at the Woodside Ferry Terminal.\nFor technical reasons and to facilitate economical transportation to its new site, the vessel was cut into four sections. It will be displayed in this form to allow visitors better access and visibility.\nBeginning on 10 March 2008, the sections, each weighing up to 240 tonnes, were transported to Woodside by floating crane over a number of days.\nLCT 7074\nIn October 2014, LCT 7074 was re-floated and moved to Portsmouth for restoration.\nHMS Bronington\nRemained moored in Birkenhead until, on 17 March 2016, she sank at her moorings.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.historicwarships.org/ Main web site of the Trust]\n*[http://homepages.enterprise.net/hyland/maps/interest/historic.html#mine WPT at enterprise.net]"
