It lies approximately  north-east of Barciany,  north of Kętrzyn, and  north-east of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nHistory\nAt the end of the 19th century, a manor house was constructed in the village by Max Siegfried, a member of the Siegfried family, who were prominent landowners in the region and owned several estates in the area. The original design featured a two-story central projection on the front façade, topped with a decorative pediment. After World War II, the building was repurposed to serve as apartments and a community hall. It later suffered a fire that caused significant damage, but the structure was subsequently rebuilt. Today, the manor functions as a privately owned residence.\nReferences"
