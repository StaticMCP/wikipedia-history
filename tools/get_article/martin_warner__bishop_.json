He suffered a cardiac arrest on 23 August 2010 while on holiday in Florence, but returned to work. From 2008 to 2011, Warner wrote the weekly \"Sunday's Readings\" column for the Church Times.\nOn 3 May 2012, Warner's appointment as the next diocesan Bishop of Chichester was announced, his election was confirmed on 2 July and his enthronement took place in Chichester Cathedral on 25 November.\nIn a compromise by John Sentamu, Archbishop of York, to whom the candidate professed canonical obedience, Warner officiated as principal celebrant in the laying-on of hands and Eucharist for the episcopal consecration of Philip North as suffragan Bishop of Burnley at York Minster on 2 February 2015 (Feast of Candlemas).\nHe was introduced to the House of Lords as a Lord Spiritual on 15 January 2018.\nViews\nOn 20 November 2012, Warner was one of three bishops (and one of the two diocesans) in the General Synod who voted against a motion to allow the ordination of women as bishops in the Church of England.
