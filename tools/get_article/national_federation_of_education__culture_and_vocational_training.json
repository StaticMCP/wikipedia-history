The Federation for National Education (FEN), formerly affiliated to the CGT, voted to leave, but did not join FO.  However, it permitted its members to also be affiliated to any national union federation.  As a result, in April, supporters of FO formed the FO Federation for National Education.  Membership remained low, only 5,000 in 1950, and in 1954, FO decided to ban dual membership with the FEN, effectively ending the union's presence outside teaching colleges and technical education.\nThe union became the National Federation for Education and Culture (FNEC) in 1970, and grew significantly in the early 1980s, when a group of former FEN members joined, arguing that the FEN was not supporting secularism nor opposing parents interfering in state education.  The union adopted its current name in 1989.  By 1995, it claimed 28,000 members.\nGeneral Secretaries\n:1948: Francis Perrin, Gilbert Walusinski and Gaston Pollet\n:1950: Pierre Giraud\n:1953: Pierre Galoni\n:1968: Maurice Mascrier\n:1983:\n:1986: François Chaintron\n:2008: Hubert Raguin\n:2019: Clément Poullet\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
