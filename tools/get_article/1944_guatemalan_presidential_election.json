The October Revolution had overthrown Jorge Ubico, the American-backed dictator, after which a junta composed of Francisco Javier Arana, Jacobo Árbenz and Jorge Toriello took power, and quickly announced presidential elections, as well as elections for a constitutional assembly. The subsequent elections were broadly considered free and fair, although only literate men were given the vote. Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. The front-runner was the university professor Juan José Arévalo, nominated by the National Renovation Party. His closest challenger was Adrián Recinos, whose campaign included a number of individuals identified with the Ubico regime. The ballots were tallied on 19 December and Arévalo won in a landslide with 86.25% of the vote, receiving more than four times as many votes as the other candidates combined. The Constitutional Assembly elections took place on 28–30 December, with the United Front of Arevalist Parties winning 50 of the 65 seats.\nResults\n|party13=|votes13=2\n|cand14=Jorge Toriello Garrido|party14=Civic Union|votes14=2\n|cand15=Julio Bianchi|party15=Central-American party|votes15=1\n|cand16=Manuel Galich|party16=Popular Liberation Front|votes16=1\n|cand17=Eugenio Silva Peña|party17=Social Democratic Party|votes17=1\n|invalid=6042\n|electorate=310000\n|source=Prensa Libre, Nohlen\n}}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Villagrán Kramer, Francisco.
