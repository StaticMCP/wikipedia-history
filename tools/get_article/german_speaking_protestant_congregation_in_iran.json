It is affiliated with the Protestant Church in Germany.\nThe congregation acquired a plot of land and built Christ Church in Teheran (Christuskirche Teheran) in 1961. The church is a brick structure without a tower, seating up to 120 people. The building is located at Shahid Sheydayi Street 123/1 in the Gholhak area of northern Tehran, a center of German-speaking residents up to the 1979 Iranian revolution, near the then-German School and other community institutions.\nProtestant Christians founded it in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria in Iran. Since the Iranian revolution, this has been the only expatriate Protestant church in Tehran. It also serves English speakers. Services are conducted in German on Fridays, and there is an English language service on the first Friday of the month.\nSee also\n*List of religious centers in Tehran\n*German Embassy School Tehran\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kirche.ir/ Evangelische Gemeinde Deutscher Sprache im Iran]"
