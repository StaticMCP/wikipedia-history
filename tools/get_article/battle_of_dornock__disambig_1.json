In exchange for ceding the region of Lothian to England, Balliol was given assistance and replenished forces.[http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/balliol_2.htm Edward Balliol] He returned to Scotland and attacked the Scots at Berwick-upon-Tweed. After several retaliatory and counterattacks from both sides, the attempt failed and no tactical advantage was gained.[http://www.douglashistory.co.uk/history/Battles/dornock.htm Battle of Dornock, 1333]\nBuild Up\nIn response, William of Lochmaben, Sir Ralph Dacre and Sir Anthony Lucy led an English force of 800 men into Dumfriesshire. William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale[http://www.douglashistory.co.uk/history/Battles/Battles.htm Battles involving the Douglases] and 50 Scottish defenders along with Sir Humphrey Boys and Sir Humphrey Jardine moved to intercept them.\nThe battle\nOn 25 March 1333, the small Scottish force intercepted the English at the village of Dornock. Little is known about the battle itself, as it was reportedly over very quickly, but 24 Scots (along with the two Humphreys) were killed and Douglas was taken prisoner. England reported only two losses.\nAftermath\nThe rest of the Scots fled, and Douglas was imprisoned for two years under special instructions from King Edward.[http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst1627.html Overview of Sir William Douglas] The Scottish poet Andrew Wyntoun noted the battle in his verse:\nA well in the area was known as the sword well by the late 18th century, probably because artefacts of the battle were discovered near to there.\nReferences\nSources\nPrimary\n* Knighton, Henry, Chronicon, ed.
