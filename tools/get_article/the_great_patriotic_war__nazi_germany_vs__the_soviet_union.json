It was a success, and at the Origins Awards in 1987, it was a finalist for the Charles S. Roberts Award for \"Best World War II Board Game of 1986.\"\nUsing the same rules system with the addition of more advanced options, Chadwick expanded the game to cover the entire German-Soviet conflict, and released it as The Great Patriotic War in 1988.\nReception\nIn Issue 2 of Games International, Norman Smith liked the components, and found the turn sequence \"beautifully models warfare at the Corps and Army level of this period.\" He concluded by giving it an above average rating of 4 out of 5, saying, \"Overall, the game is good value for money, an excellent choice for beginners and a solid game for the collections of regular gamers.\"\nIn Fire & Movement #68, John K. Setear noted that The Great Patriotic War lacks a fog of war mechanism in its design, making any simulation of battle inaccurate, since both players can clearly see the disposition of their opponent's forces.\nSee also\n* ''Moscow '41''\nReferences"
