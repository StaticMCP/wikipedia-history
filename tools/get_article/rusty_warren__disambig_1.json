She graduated from Milton High School around 1948, studied piano at the New England Conservatory of Music, graduating around 1954, and later taught there briefly after obtaining her degree. She spent her first free summer entertaining in small lounges. Her musical mentor at the time was Arthur Fiedler, the conductor of the Boston Pops.\n\"Late at night, there’d be nobody in these places (cocktail lounges in the Boston area), to cut the boredom, I got some repartee going with the regulars.\"\nCareer\nIn 1955, Warren began at The Pomp Room, at 16th Street and Camelback Road, Phoenix, AZ.
