Singles and music videos were released for the title track, \"Nine Lives\", and \"Untouched\". The album reached number 24 on the Official Finnish Charts, and reached number 4 in the physical charts.\nFounding keyboarist Janne Wirman explained the inspiration for the lyrics and album title, \"Many of our lyrics were inspired by the sad fact that a war is raging in Europe. This situation has changed things in our lives that we never imagined possible. I'm over 40, and suddenly there's war in my immediate vicinity. But the title \"Band of Brothers\" also refers to us as a band. We all grew up with the TV series of the same name.\"\nTrack listing\n;Bonus track\nPersonnel\n*Janne Wirman – keyboards\n*Petri Lindroos – vocals\n*Antti Wirman – guitar\n*Jyri Helko – bass guitar\n*Seppo Tarvainen – drums\nReferences"
