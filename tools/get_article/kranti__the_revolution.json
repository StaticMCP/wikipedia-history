Produced by Shrikant Mohta under the banner of Shree Venkatesh Films, the film is an adaptation of Ram Gopal Varma's Telugu film Siva (1989). It stars Jeet, Ashish Vidyarthi and Swastika Mukherjee in the lead roles. The film was a big success in the career of Jeet. It is the 15th film as lead actor of Jeet.The film also was a commercial success. Ashish Vidyarthi was Vishnu (the mafia leader) in this film.\nPlot\nJeetendra Ghosh or Jeet (Jeet) is a student whose family, consisting of his parents and elder sister Devashree Ghosh (Locket Chatterjee), migrated to the city Kolkata. Since their arrival, they have struggled amongst the crowd to exist. People of Kolkata fear Vishnu (Ashish Vidyarthi), the local don. His younger brother Deva (Rishi Kaushik) studies in the same college as Jeet. Deva's gang in the college are the biggest troublemakers, who tease girls and pass bad comments at them. Jeet, who tries to handle the situation, clashes with Deva's gang for a number of times and beats his gang members. In retaliation, Vishnu's goons start attacking his family members and friends. One day they spot Debashree on the road and assaults her. They rape her one by one in public. Police started investigating, and an Inspector named Ronojoy (Rajesh Sharma) was assigned, and he sought to punish the wrongdoers, but he wasn't able to punish them as Vishnu and his gang were too much powerful and had many politicians support. They also kill his college friend Iqbal (Biswanath Basu) for standing against Vishnu in elections. Jeet, in a fit of rage, killed Vishnu's younger brother Deva inside a car, strangulating his neck with a copper wire to avenge his friend Iqbal's death. Vishnu couldn't bear the loss of his so loving brother, infuriated and disturbingly killed Jeet's father Sridhar Ghosh (Bodhisatwa Majumdar). A helpless and heartbroken Jeet is left with nothing, but only a strong desire to punish the wrongdoers. He becomes determined to kill Vishnu. In the end, Jeet is successful in killing Vishnu, thus fulfilling his revenge.\nCast\n* Jeet as Jeetendra Ghosh or Jeet\n** Aritra Dutta Banik as Young Jeet\n* Swastika Mukherjee as Arpita\n* Alokananda Roy as Sohini Ghosh, Jeet's mother\n* Ashish Vidyarthi as Vishnu, a dreaded gangster supported by politicians\n* Bodhisattwa Majumdar as Shridhar Ghosh, Jeet's father\n* Locket Chatterjee as Debashree Ghosh, Jeet's elder sister\n* Biswanath Basu as Iqbal\n* Raja Chattopadhyay\n* Rishi Kaushik as Deva, Vishnu's younger brother\n* Rajesh Sharma as Inspector Ranajoy\n* Bhola Tamang\nSoundtrack\n}}\n| title1          = Prithibi Bodle Geche\n| extra1          = Shreya Ghoshal, Babul Supriyo\n| music1          = Jeet Gannguli\n| length1         = 5:26\n| title2          = Kranti Theme\n| extra2          = Som-Rishi-Samidh\n| music2          = Riingo Banerjee\n| length2         = 5:28\n| title3          = Banglay Gaan Gayi\n| extra3          = Pratul Mukherjee\n| lyrics3         = Pratul Mukherjee\n| music3          = Som, Rishi, Samidh\n| length3         = 4:51\n}}\nReferences"
