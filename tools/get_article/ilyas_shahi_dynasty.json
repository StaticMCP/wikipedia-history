Their rule extended from 1342 to 1487, though interrupted with interregna by their slaves as well as the House of Ganesha.\nInitial dynasty\n, once the largest mosque in the subcontinent, built by Sikandar Shah in Hazrat Pandua.]]\nThe ancestors of Ilyas Shah originated from Sistan, and according to Syed A M R Haque, arrived in the subcontinent as Muslim missionaries and the family were granted jagirs in Bengal in the year 1227. Bengal was under the Delhi Sultanate at the time.\nDuring the governorship of Izz al-Din Yahya in Satgaon, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah took service under him. Following Yahya's death in 1338, Ilyas Shah took control of Satgaon and declared himself as a Sultan, independent of Delhi. He then waged a campaign, defeating both the Sultans Alauddin Ali Shah and Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah of Lakhnauti and Sonargaon respectively by 1342. This led to the foundation of Bengal as a single political entity and the start of the Bengal Sultanate and its first dynasty, the Ilyas Shahi.\nAfter Shamsuddin's death, his son Sikandar Shah ascended the throne. Sikandar ruled for the next 30 years and built the Adina Masjid in Pandua in 1368 and Kotwali Darwaza in Gauḍa. Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, son of Sikandar Shah succeeded the throne and established friendly relationships with the Ming Empire of China and encouraged trade. During his reign, Ma Huan, a Chinese traveller visited Bengal.\nInstability\nIn 1415, political confusion and weakness of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty led to Saifuddin Hamza Shah's rule being overthrown by slave Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah's family and the House of Ganesha shortly after. Ganesha's son Jadu embraced Islam and assumed the title of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Shah. He was succeeded by his son, Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah. Ahmad was killed by his nobles in 1436 in an attempt to restore the Ilyas Shahi dynasty.\nRestored dynasty\nAfter the death of Shamsuddin Ahmad, Two ephemeral rulers: Qutbuddin Azam Shah and Ghiyasuddin Nusrat Shah ruled Eastern Bengal for a brief period and struck coins in AH 837 (1434 CE). Another ruler, Siraj-al Din Sikandar Shah is only known from his undated coins. It is not known if any of them were related to Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah. In any case, the rule of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty was restored by Mahmud Shah, a descendant of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, who ascended the throne in 1436 as Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah. In 1487, the last ruler of this dynasty Jalal ad-Din Fatih Shah was killed by his Habshi commander of the palace guards, Shahzada Barbak, who ascended the throne under the title, Sultan Barbak Shah. With this, the Ilyas Shahi dynasty's rule over Bengal came to an end.\nList of rulers\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC88\" width=20% | Titular Name(s)\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC88\" width=17% | Personal Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC88\" width=7% | Reign\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Shams ad-Din\n|align=\"center\"| Ilyas Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1342–1358\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Abu al-Mujahid\n|align=\"center\"| Sikandar Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1358–1390\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Ghiyath ad-Din\n|align=\"center\"| Azam Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1390–1411\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Sayf ad-Din\n|align=\"center\"| Hamzah Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1411–1413\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Abu al-Muzaffar\n|align=\"center\"| Muhammad Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1413\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Nasir ad-Din Abu al-Muzaffar\n|align=\"center\"| Mahmud Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1435–1459\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Rukun ad-Din\n|align=\"center\"| Barbak Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1459–1474\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Shams ad-Din Abu al-Muzaffar\n|align=\"center\"| Yusuf Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1474–1481\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Nur ad-Din\n|align=\"center\"| Sikandar Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1481\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Sultan Jalal ad-Din\n|align=\"center\"| Fateh Shah\n|align=\"center\"|1481–1487\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=\"middle\"| Habshi rule takes over Sultanate of Bengal under Shahzada Barbak in 1487 C.E.\n|}\n* Silver shaded row signifies the start of the Restored Ilyas Shahi dynasty.\n}}\nFamily tree: Ilyas Shahi Dynasty (1342–1414)\nFamily tree: Restored Ilyas Shahi Dynasty (1436–1487)\nSee also\n* History of Bangladesh\n* History of Bengal\n* History of India\n* List of Sunni Muslim dynasties\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://tanmoy.tripod.com/bengal/iliyas.html The Iliyas Shahi Dynasty]"
