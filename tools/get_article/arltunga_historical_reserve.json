It is on the lands of the Eastern Arrernte people, who are the traditional owners.\nThe name Arltunga comes from the Eastern Arrernte name for the nearby waterhole Arnerre-ntyenge (a-na-ra n-tunga-a) which translates roughly as 'stinking water' as animals were known to get stuck in there and die. Alternatively there is speculation that the name comes from a corruption of the Kukatja dialect (Luritja language) word aldolanga which means 'easterners'. The European name for this waterhole is Paddy's Rockhole.\nIt is of major historical significance as the first major European settlement in Central Australia.\nIt is nearby to the Winnecke Goldfield which followed a similar history.\nThe Eastern Arrernte owners\nThe Eastern Arrernte people are the traditional owners of what is now known as the Arltunga Historical Reserve; their name for this place is Arnerre-ntyenge. This site sits within the estate known as Inerentye and this has been their Country for thousands of years.\nOnce European settlers arrived the Eastern Arrernte people were important to their success and survival and many Aboriginal people believed that, in helping the prospectors, they would retain some form of independence. The Eastern Arrernte people acted at guides, trackers, labourers, miners, messengers and as domestic help within the community. The Eastern Arrernte also taught the new arrivals knowledge of their Country, particularly in regard to water and bush food resources.\nMany Eastern Arrernte people also took work on nearby pastoral stations including Atnarpa, Loves Creek, Ambalindum and The Gardens.\nMining\nGold was first observed here by South Australian explorer, David Lindsay in 1887 as he trekked from Port Darwin to the coast of South Australia and it was found in the creek sands below Paddy's Rockhole (Arnerre-ntyenge). The discovery of gold came after his 1886 discoveries of 'rubies' at Ruby Gap (now Ruby Gap Nature Park); these were later discovered to be high quality garnets.\nSubsequently, miners flocked to the area and Arltunga became the first substantial European settlement in Central Australia and, in order to support Arltunga, Lindsay was commissioned to survey the town of Stuart (now Alice Springs) in so that it could supply it with the required goods.\nIn 1898 the South Australian Government built the Government Battery and Cyanide Works and construction of these was supervised by James Gilbert Woolcock, who had to overcome significant logistical problems. The following year, in 1899, the police station and associated outbuildings were built by contractors William Hurle Liddle and Gerhardt Johannsen.\nDespite high investment the growth of Arltunga was slowed by a significant period of drought in the 1890s where wells dried up and the horses were too starving to cart ore. There was also a period of several months in 1901 when the battery burst and no ore could be crushed for several months. Conditions, however, improved in 1903 when a rush at the nearby Winnecke Goldfield renewed interest in the region and in 1905 a new well, store and hotel were built there. At the turn of the century the population on the field was between 350 and 400 people.\nDiscoveries of gold in The Granites and Tennant Creek in the late 1920s and early 1930s meant that many of the miners left Arltunga, who still faced regular issues accessing water. The population had declined to 25 by 1933.\nMission\nThe Little Flower Mission, run by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart order, moved to Arltunga (by then largely abandoned) in 1944 and was renamed Arltunga Mission. The mission, which had previously been operating in Alice Springs, was moved due to the growing Army presence in the region. Much of the work to complete this move was done by lay missionary Francis McGarry who had also chosen the site; soon after the move was completed McGarry resigned or was asked to leave.\nIt was moved to again to Phillipson's Block in 1953 where it was renamed Santa Teresa Mission (this is now known the community of Ltyentye Apurte).\nRecent history\nArltunga Historical Reserve was established in 1975 and comprises 5,000 ha. Owing to the harshness of the climate and the fact that local stone was used in the construction of buildings, the town is well preserved.\nThe reserve was nominated for heritage listing in 2008. While the Government Battery and Cyanide Works site at Arltunga was successfully listed in 1995, the nomination for the rest of the reserve was unresolved due to a native title claim in the area until 2014, when a second nomination was successful.\nThe reserve was listed on the former Register of the National Estate.\nGallery\nFile:Camel Teams, Arltunga, c. 1898.jpg|Camel Teams, Arltunga, c. 1898\nFile:A tent dwelling, Arltunga, c. 1898.jpg|A tent dwelling, Arltunga, c. 1898\nFile:Cyanide Works, Arltunga, c. 1890.jpg|Cyanide Works, Arltunga, c. 1890\nFile:The Government Battery, Arltunga, NT, 1900.jpg|The Government Battery, Arltunga, 1900\nFile:Winnecke Hotel, Arltunga, 1905.jpg|Winnecke Hotel, Arltunga, 1905\nFile:Police Station, Arltunga, 1920.jpg|Police Station, Arltunga, 1920\nFile:Jessie May Gunn 043.tif|The road into Arltunga, with a Bond's Tour bus, 1946\nFurther images are available within the [https://collections.slsa.sa.gov.au/collection/Arltunga+Collection Arltunga Collection] at the State Library of South Australia.\nNotable people\n* Chinese market gardener Ah Hong made many trips to Arltunga with vegetables and fresh food for the miners.\n* Bushman, Ben Nicker, was born just north of the Arltunga goldfields.\n* Gwoya Tjungurrayi and his family escaped to the Arltunga region following the Coniston massacre and he later worked as a gold miner there.\n* Hetty Perkins, who worked at The Bungalow for many years, was born at Arltunga.\n* Topsy Smith, alongside her husband William \"Bill\" Smith, spent many years at the Arltunga Goldfields; her son Walter Smith also spent much of his early life there.\n* Policeman William George Murray was transferred to Arltunga in 1931 following the events of the Coniston massacre. Here he was appointed as the Mining Warden and later, in 1936, the health inspector. In 1937 he was investigated for the illegal selling of government property and was later acquitted in court; following this incident he was transferred to Roper River in 1938.\nCemeteries\nThere are two cemeteries that sit within the Arltunga Historical Reserve:\n* Crossroads Cemetery\n* White Range Cemetery\nClimate\n, (2000–2020 normals, extremes 2000–present)\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|width= auto\n|collapsed = Y\n|Jan record high C =\t43.9\n|Feb record high C =\t43.7\n|Mar record high C =\t41.6\n|Apr record high C =\t39.0\n|May record high C =\t33.4\n|Jun record high C =\t30.2\n|Jul record high C =\t30.4\n|Aug record high C =\t35.0\n|Sep record high C =\t39.0\n|Oct record high C =\t41.0\n|Nov record high C =\t42.5\n|Dec record high C =\t44.5\n|Jan record low C = \t10.0\n|Feb record low C = \t8.6\n|Mar record low C = \t6.9\n|Apr record low C = \t1.5\n|May record low C = \t-4.2\n|Jun record low C = \t-5.0\n|Jul record low C = \t-6.5\n|Aug record low C = \t-5.0\n|Sep record low C = \t-0.9\n|Oct record low C = \t0.0\n|Nov record low C = \t6.6\n|Dec record low C = \t7.5\n|Jan high C =\t36.2\n|Feb high C = \t34.7\n|Mar high C = \t32.4\n|Apr high C = \t29.1\n|May high C = \t23.2\n|Jun high C = \t19.5\n|Jul high C = \t20.2\n|Aug high C = \t23.0\n|Sep high C = \t27.8\n|Oct high C = \t31.3\n|Nov high C = \t33.8\n|Dec high C = \t34.7\n|Jan low C = \t22.3\n|Feb low C = \t21.1\n|Mar low C = \t18.6\n|Apr low C = \t13.4\n|May low C = \t8.1\n|Jun low C = \t4.3\n|Jul low C = \t3.1\n|Aug low C = \t4.7\n|Sep low C = \t10.2\n|Oct low C = \t14.3\n|Nov low C = \t18.1\n|Dec low C = \t20.4\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = \t65.0\n|Feb rain mm = \t57.8\n|Mar rain mm = \t33.6\n|Apr rain mm = \t18.6\n|May rain mm = \t18.5\n|Jun rain mm = \t14.0\n|Jul rain mm = \t9.2\n|Aug rain mm = \t4.4\n|Sep rain mm = \t10.5\n|Oct rain mm = \t23.4\n|Nov rain mm = \t32.9\n|Dec rain mm = \t52.6\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan rain days = \t4.3\n|Feb rain days = \t3.7\n|Mar rain days = \t2.1\n|Apr rain days = \t1.2\n|May rain days = \t1.9\n|Jun rain days = \t1.5\n|Jul rain days = \t1.2\n|Aug rain days = \t0.8\n|Sep rain days = \t1.5\n|Oct rain days = \t2.8\n|Nov rain days = \t4.0\n|Dec rain days = \t5.3\n|year precipitation days =\n|source 1 = Australian Bureau of Meteorology\n}}\nReferences"
