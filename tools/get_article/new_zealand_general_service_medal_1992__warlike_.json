The medal was never issued without a clasp.\nThe NZGSM 1992 was issued in two varieties - one for warlike service, and another for non-warlike service.  Warlike operations were commemorated by this medal, humanitarian and peacekeeping operations were commemorated by the NZGSM 1992 (Non-Warlike) in bronze.\nThe design and colours of the ribbon were based upon the New Zealand Medal of 1869, thus are directly linked with the beginnings of New Zealand’s military history.  As the first occasion upon which New Zealand had issued a war or warlike service medal outside of the two World Wars or the Vietnam War it was considered that the link with the first military campaigns in New Zealand best reflected New Zealand’s military heritage.\nThis medal was replaced in 2002 by the New Zealand General Service Medal 2002.\nClasps\n* Near East\n:31 October - 22 December 1956.  Awarded to members of the Royal New Zealand Navy who served for 1 day or more in ships engaged in operations off the Egyptian coast between these dates and who did not qualify for the award of the Naval General Service Medal (1915) with the clasp Near East.\n* Malaya 1960-64\n:1 August 1960 - 16 August 1964.
