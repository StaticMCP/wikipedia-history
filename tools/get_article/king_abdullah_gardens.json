The project is designed to focus on mankind's understanding of the process, consequence, and study of climate change.\nProject details\nThe KAIG project began in Riyadh and is poised to become one of the primary educational resources in understanding climate and sustainable development. The gardens will be built within two interconnected, crescent-shaped biomes, reflecting the site's passage through time. The Garden of Choices will reflect what could happen in the future if climate change continues or is arrested. The project is planned to be one of the largest temperature-controlled gardens in the world.\nSo far, more than 40% of KAIG operations have been completed. The project is reportedly slated to be completed by the autumn of 2025.\nContractor\nThe contract for the implementation of the 210-ha King Abdullah International Gardens project was awarded to Zaid Alhussain & Brothers Group. The contract, worth $427.4 million (1.6bn SAR), was awarded by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing (MOMRAH).\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
