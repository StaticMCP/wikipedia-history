The film stars Dima Bilan (in his first film role), Svetlana Ivanova, Aleksandr Adabashyan, Aleksandr Baluev, and Marat Basharov.\nPlot\nThe film is set in 2016. Andrey Kulikov is a young machinist who is going to Paris to visit an old lady, and to buy the oldest Russian-made car, the Russo-Balt. While walking through Paris, Andrey sees a woman, Vera, and so starts the tale of two love stories, separated by three generations and one hundred years.\nLater, when Andrey visits a cemetery he finds the grave of a young lady similar to the one he just met in Paris.\nDuring his search to the past it becomes clear that Vera's and Andrey's fates are connected. His great-grandfather, Andrey Dolmatov, had been an officer in the White Army during the Russian Revolution and fell in love with Duchess Vera Chernisheva in the last days of the Russian Empire and in the Russian Civil War.\nCast\n*Dima Bilan as Officer and Nobleman Andrey Dolmatov / Andrey Kulikov\n*Svetlana Ivanova as Duchess Vera Chernisheva / Vera Yezerskaya\n*Aleksandr Adabashyan as Lev Chij\n*Aleksandr Baluev as Tereshchenko\n*Marat Basharov as Baron Ivan Karlovich von Liven\n*Aleksandr Golovin as Repnin\n*Jurgita Jurkute as Irina Chernisheva\n*Tatyana Lyutaeva as Duchess Chernisheva\n*Viktor Nemets as Yefim\n*Lilita Ozolina\tas Yelizaveta Yezerskaya von liven\n*Yulia Peresild as Masha Kulikova\n*Aleksandr Vasilev\n*Vladislav Vetrov as The Ducks\n*Petar Zekavica as Mikhailenko\n*Mikolas Vildjunas as General Kornilov\n*Yuri Vasilev as The priest\nProduction\nMusic\nThe musical score was composed by Eduard Artemyev, who has previously collaborated with Russian director Nikita Mikhalkov on numerous movies (At Home Among Strangers, An Unfinished Piece for a Player Piano, Burnt by the Sun, The Barber of Siberia, Sunstroke).\nSee also\n* The Admiral\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.theheritageoflove.org Official website]\n*[http://culturalsolidaritymedia.com/portfolio/heritage-of-love/ The Heritage of Love at culturalsolidaritymedia.com]"
