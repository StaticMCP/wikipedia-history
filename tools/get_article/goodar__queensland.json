In the , Goodar had a population of 101 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded  by the Barwon Highway to the south.\nThe Umbercollie State Forest is in the west of the locality.\nThe South Western railway line enters the locality from the south-east (Goondiwindi) and exits to the south-west (Toobeah).\nThe land use is a mixture of dry and irrigated crop growing along with grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from a pastoral run held from 1847 by James Mark, transferred to Edward Gostwyk Cory in August 1849.\nThe James Mark killings\nJames Mark was infamous due to a campaign of slaughter he perpetrated on the local Aboriginal population in the late 1840s. He first occupied the  Yallaroi run to the south of the Macintyre River but was forced to abandon it due to Aboriginal resistance. In 1847 he took up the Goodar run, where he was described by neighbouring colonists as a hater of all Aboriginals and would shoot any he saw.\nIn 1847, Mark killed an Aboriginal boy and in revenge the local Aborigines killed Mark's nine year old son. Mark then went on a killing spree, travelling through the district recruiting stockmen and landholders at other stations, forming a vigilante death squad to avenge his son. Police officers from Warialda also joined the group or participated in follow-up attacks.\nAround 50 Aboriginal people were killed by Mark's gang, most of whom were peaceful people who were employed on the local pastoral stations such as Umbercollie, Broomfield, Callandoon and Carbucky. The killings were mostly done at night when the victims were sleeping and a significant proportion were women and children.\nEventually several members of his group were arrested but Marks himself evaded capture and left the district. None of those arrested were found guilty of any offence. Mark's actions were important in the New South Wales Government's decision to form a Native Police force in 1848 to operate in the northern districts of the colony.\nRailways\nThe Goondiwindi-to-Talwood section of the  South Western railway opened on 4 May 1910 with the locality being served by two railway stations:\n* Callandoon North railway station (now abandoned, )\n* Carbuckey railway station (now abandoned, )\nDemographics\nIn the , Goodar had a population of 65 people.\nIn the , Goodar had a population of 101 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Goodar.
