      "text": "# Revolution Girl Style Now\n\n}}\nRevolution Girl Style Now is a demo album by the punk rock band Bikini Kill.  It was self-released in cassette form in 1991 and recorded at Yoyo Studios.\nThe 1991 cassette was released for the first time on vinyl, CD and digital formats in 2015 via the band's own label, Bikini Kill Records. The reissue includes three previously unreleased tracks: \"Ocean Song\", \"Just Once\", and \"Playground\". The album has most recently been reissued on red vinyl in a \"Limited edition 30th anniversary pressing on red vinyl\" via Bikini Kill Records.\nThe name of the album was a slogan that Bikini Kill used along with \"Stop the J-Word Jealousy from Killing Girl Love\". It dates back to at least the summer of 1991 when Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, originally from Olympia, Washington, traveled to Washington DC for an extended visit. Author Dave Thompson, in his book Alternative Rock (2000), noted its rough sound, \"[but that] doesn't change the fact that the only truly essential BK album is the one they created while building their own crowd themselves – not having one thrust upon them by everyone else.\" Daniel Sinker, founder of Punk Planet magazine has written:\nTrack listing\n2015 reissue bonus tracks\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_neZNVewWfSRMq7QRb_gIbSrhUNYF4Q8jY Revolution Girl Style Now] at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed)"
