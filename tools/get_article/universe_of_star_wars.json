Chott el-Jerid, Tunisia (pictured in 2010) was filmed for the setting of the planet Tatooine. ]]\nThe Star Wars multimedia and film franchise is set in a fictional universe, most events of which occur in a single galaxy in that universe. Originally established by George Lucas as a \"galaxy far, far away\", it comprises numerous planets, moons, star systems, and species. The galaxy is divided into four broad sub-regions: the Core Worlds, Mid Rim, Outer Rim, and Unknown Regions. Notable planets include Coruscant, an ecumenopolis in the Core that functions as a political and cultural center, and Tatooine, a desert planet located in the Outer Rim. The universe initially encompassed a collection of works recognized as canon by Lucasfilm as part of the official Star Wars storyline. Subsequent expanded material in other media was later rebranded as the Legends universe by Disney, declaring it non-canonical to the official universe.\nWithin this fictional body exists a variety of intelligent species, including Humans, Twi’leks, Wookiees, Rodians, and Hutts, as well as several major governing bodies throughout galactic history, such as the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, New Republic, and First Order. Each of these entities operates under differing political structures, ranging from democratic institutions to totalitarian regimes. Interstellar travel is facilitated by hyperspace, allowing rapid movement between distant star systems. A central metaphysical concept in the Star Wars universe is the Force, an omnipresent energy field that connects all living things. The Force is divided into two principal aspects: the Light Side, traditionally followed by the Jedi Order, and the Dark Side, embraced by the Sith. The universe also features a high level of technological advancement, including starships, droids, and energy-based weapons such as blasters and lightsabers. The timeline of in-universe events is often measured in reference to the Battle of Yavin, a pivotal conflict depicted in the original 1977 film, serving as a chronological anchor for subsequent developments in the franchise.\nConception and design\nGeorge Lucas began developing the Star Wars universe in the early 1970s, intending to create an epic narrative, inspired by real world history and influenced by classical mythology, set within a large and intricate fictional galaxy, as to create a type of \"modern myth\". To establish much of the foundation for the universe, Lucas largely drew from the works of Joseph Campbell; his projects on comparative mythology and philosophical systems, such as Taoism and Buddhism, were among the most significant influences on hero archetypes and metaphysical concepts such as the Force and its dichotomy between light and dark sides. To visualize the setting, Lucas collaborated with concept artists Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston, who produced design work featuring alien environments, archaic starships, and deteriorated urban landscapes. The visual approach of a \"used future\" aesthetic presents technology and locations as worn, utilitarian, and consistently inhabited. The early development incorporated cultural layering and technological inconsistency, elements used to support the depiction of a complex fictional universe.\nThe expansion of the Star Wars universe beyond the original films began largely in the 1980s and 1990s through licensed novels, comics, sourcebooks, and games, collectively referred to as the 'Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU'). These works added new characters, planets, events, and timelines, and were produced under a continuity framework managed by Lucas Licensing. While Lucas acknowledged aspects of the EU, he did not regard it as part of the central canon. Following Disney’s 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm, the narrative structure of the franchise was reorganized. In 2014, Lucasfilm rebranded the Expanded Universe as Star Wars Legends, designating those works as non-canonical. A new unified canon was introduced, beginning with the six original films, the 2008 television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and all subsequent material produced under the direction of the Lucasfilm Story Group. The new canon was intended to maintain consistency across media formats, including film, television, publishing, and interactive platforms. Concepts and characters from the Legends continuity have been selectively reintroduced in updated forms within the current canon.\nAstrography\nThe Galaxy\nStar Wars Galaxy}}The Galaxy in Star Wars is depicted as a barred spiral galaxy estimated to span over 120,000 light-years in diameter, comprising millions of habitable star systems. Its structure is divided into several concentric regions that determine levels of technological development, political control, and cultural influence. These regions, from the innermost to outermost, include the Deep Core, Core Worlds, Colonies, Inner Rim, Expansion Region, Mid Rim, Outer Rim Territories, Wild Space, and the Unknown Regions. Each region plays a distinct role in the political and economic dynamics of the galaxy, with the Core Worlds—such as Coruscant and Corellia—serving as major hubs of commerce and government. In addition to regional delineations, the galaxy is subdivided into sectors, subsectors, and systems for administrative and navigational purposes. Sectors—such as the Seswenna Sector or the Kanz Sector—are composed of multiple star systems and often governed by a moff or senator, depending on the galactic government in power. This multi-tiered hierarchy supports localized governance and military deployment, particularly in the vast expanses of the Mid Rim and Outer Rim. In Star Wars: The Essentials Atlas, Daniel Wallace and Jason Fry described the structure of the galaxy when writing:|author=|title=|source=}}\nIn another passage, Fry and Wallace explain the function of galactic coordinates in the Star Wars galaxy:\n}}The galactic capital, Coruscant, located in the Core Worlds near the galactic center, historically functions as the governing seat for major galactic governments including the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, and Galactic Federation of Free Alliances throughout much of the Star Wars timeline. The Core is connected to the rest of the galaxy through established hyperspace routes—navigable corridors through the galaxy’s gravitational wells and stellar hazards. These routes, such as the Corellian Run, Hydian Way, and Perlemian Trade Route, enable safe and efficient travel and have historically dictated the rise of trade centers and political alliances. Beyond the Outer Rim lies Wild Space, a partially charted frontier, and the Unknown Regions, a vast and largely unexplored expanse marked by navigational anomalies, gravitational distortions, and the absence of established hyperlanes. These areas serve as narrative frontiers for new threats and civilizations, such as the Chiss Ascendancy and remnants of the Sith Empire.\nNotable planets and moons\nThe Star Wars film saga features a wide range of fictional planets and moons that function as primary locations for key events across the galaxy and  franchise storylines. Each celestial body is defined by distinct environmental and geopolitical characteristics.\nTatooine is a desert planet located in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy, orbiting a binary star system. It is depicted as a remote, arid world with harsh climatic conditions, limited water resources, and minimal political influence on galactic affairs. The planet serves as the birthplace of Anakin Skywalker and the childhood home of Luke Skywalker, thereby occupying a significant position within the overarching narrative of the saga. Tatooine's surface is characterized by expansive dune seas, rocky canyons, and isolated moisture farming communities that utilize atmospheric condensers to extract water. Major settlements include Mos Eisley, a spaceport known for its criminal underworld activity, and Mos Espa, a trade hub noted for hosting podracing events. Indigenous species include the nomadic Tusken Raiders and the scavenging Jawas, both of whom have adapted to the planet's extreme environment. The landscape George Lucas chose to depict in Tatooine scenes was largely based on real-world geographical features. Southern Tunisia’s semi-arid and desert climate provided a suitable environment for filming, representing the planet’s harsh conditions. Several key scenes involving Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader’s early lives were shot in this region, and the film sets have since become notable cultural landmarks in Tunisia. Tunisia is also the namesake of the planet Tatooine. Although George Lucas initially intended to name the planet Utapau, he changed it during the filming of Episode IV upon realizing the name was similar to that of a female character in Star Trek. The planet was subsequently named after the Tunisian city of Tataouine, which served as a base for Lucas and his crew during production. George Lucas used three Tunisian ksour—fortified Berber granaries—in and around the city of Tataouine to represent the slave quarters featured in the Star Wars prequel films. These included Ksar Hadada, Ksar Ouled Soltane, and the ksar of Medenine.\nAlderaan is situated in the Core Worlds region of the galaxy, characterized by temperate climate zones and developed urban infrastructure. The planet holds political significance within the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Senate during a large portion of the fictional timeline, and is the homeworld of Princess Leia Organa. In 0 BBY, Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star’s superlaser during the events of Episode IV - A New Hope, resulting in complete planetary annihilation. Yavin 4, a terrestrial moon of the gas giant Yavin located in the Outer Rim Territories, is covered by dense tropical rainforests and ancient Massassi ruins. It functioned as the primary Rebel Alliance military base during the Galactic Civil War. The Battle of Yavin, which occurred in 0 BBY, was launched from this location and concluded with the destruction of the first Death Star.\nHoth is an ice-covered planet situated in the Outer Rim Territories, featuring extensive glaciation and subzero temperatures. The planet hosted Echo Base, a concealed Rebel Alliance outpost that was assaulted by Imperial forces during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, leading to a Rebel tactical withdrawal. Endor, a forested moon orbiting a gas giant in the Outer Rim Territories and located in the binary Endor system, is characterized by dense temperate forests and inhabited by the indigenous Ewok species. It contained a shield generator installation protecting the second Death Star. The Battle of Endor in 4 ABY involved a Rebel assault on this installation, facilitating the destruction of the Death Star. Dagobah is a remote swamp planet with dense forests and wetlands, used as the exile location of Jedi Master Yoda during the Galactic Civil War. Naboo is a terrestrial planet situated in the Chommell sector of the Mid Rim, characterized by its vast grassland plains, dense swamps, and underwater oceanic systems. It features a dual-ecology, supporting both surface-dwelling humans and the aquatic Gungan species. The planet's capital, Theed, is known for its classical architecture and  governmental functions. Naboo is notable in the Star Wars prequel trilogy as the site of the Invasion of Naboo in Episode I: The Phantom Menace and as the homeworld of Padmé Amidala and Emperor Palpatine. The planet holds strategic political relevance within the Galactic Republic during the early stages of the Clone Wars.\nDuring the production of the original Star Wars film, George Lucas created early notes outlining potential settings for future installments. Among the listed concepts were a \"gaseous planet with a floating city,\" a \"Wookie planet,\" and an \"ice planet.\" The gaseous planet concept was later developed into Bespin, featuring Cloud City located in its upper atmosphere. The ice planet concept evolved into Hoth, which served as a primary setting in The Empire Strikes Back. The depiction of Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back presented significant production challenges. George Lucas envisioned the planet as a \"very hostile\" environment with strong winds and cold temperatures, and proposed an underground Rebel base concealed beneath snow-covered terrain. To achieve the desired visual aesthetic, the production team searched for a suitable filming location and ultimately selected Finse, a mountain village in Norway, in the spring of 1978. The area featured expansive glacial landscapes and provided necessary logistical accommodations, including a railway connection and hotel facilities for cast and crew. Although the initial shoot was scheduled for three weeks, production in Finse extended to over eight weeks due to adverse weather conditions and other complications.\nAstronomical features\nAstrophysical phenomena in the Star Wars galaxy impose significant constraints on space travel in various franchise storylines. The Maw Cluster, a region near the Core Worlds characterized by multiple black holes, presents extreme gravitational forces that distort space and pose severe risks to starships. This location is prominently featured in Solo: A Star Wars Story as a notable navigational obstacle that surrounds the Kessel Run, a hyperspace route connecting the planet Kessel to the Core Worlds. Ion storms, noted in systems like Hoth and Ryloth, emit electrical discharges capable of disabling spacecraft systems. Other hazards include gravitational rifts and subspace distortions that affect hyperspace route stability. These environmental conditions necessitate frequent astrographic updates and have influenced starship design in both canon and expanded universe materials.\nFictional chronology\nThe Star Wars canonical timeline is structured around the Battle of Yavin, a military engagement between Rebel and Imperial forces depicted in A New Hope (1977), which serves as the central temporal reference point. Dates are expressed as BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) and ABY (After the Battle of Yavin). The earliest era, occurring over 25,000 years BBY, includes the origins of the Jedi Order, the establishment of the Galactic Republic, and early galactic civilization. This expansive period is only partially detailed in canonical sources. Between 22 BBY and 19 BBY, the Clone Wars transpire, marking a large-scale conflict between the Galactic Republic and the separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems. This conflict concludes with the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire under Emperor Palpatine. The Imperial Era encompasses the reign of the Empire until its decline, with key events including the destruction of the first Death Star at the Battle of Yavin (0 BBY), the Battle of Hoth (3 ABY), and the Battle of Endor (4 ABY), the latter resulting in the death of Emperor Palpatine and the effective dissolution of Imperial central authority. Following the Empire’s collapse, the New Republic is founded with the objective of reestablishing democratic governance and stability in the galaxy. However, Imperial loyalists survive as scattered remnants, eventually regrouping as the First Order. Beginning around 34 ABY, the sequel trilogy era portrays renewed conflict initiated by the First Order’s expansion, as well as the rise of new Force-sensitive individuals and continuing legacies of prior generations. This era includes the Resistance movement opposing the First Order and culminates with confrontations that reshape galactic power structures.\nOrganizations\nConfederacy of Independent Systems (CIS)\nThe separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) is a central faction in the Star Wars universe, initially introduced in George Lucas’ prequel trilogy. In the events of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, the separatist movement, organized by former Jedi Master Count Dooku, is formed by several planetary systems seceding from the Galactic Republic due to dissatisfaction with several problems in the Republic: ineffectual government, heavy taxes, and perceived favoritism of the Core Worlds over the Outer Rim planets. As numerous corporate interests in the galaxy pledge their allegiance to the Confederacy, war soon develops between Republican Clone forces and Separatist Battle droid armies. Alongside military strategist General Grievous and business executive and politician Nute Gunray, the CIS and the Clone Wars were covertly orchestrated by secret Sith Lord and Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (also known by his Sith name Darth Sidious), in order to facilitate the Sith's ultimate plot to purge the Jedi and regain control of the galaxy. The Confederacy and its three-year engagement in the Clone Wars is featured in numerous Star Wars books, comics and games, predominantly in two eponymous animated television shows and a 2008 film.\nFirst Order\nThe First Order was implemented as the main antagonistic faction of the Star Wars sequel trilogy and introduced in the trilogy’s first installment, Star Wars: the Force Awakens. A military dictatorship and rump state, the First Order originated from the remnants of the Galactic Empire following its defeat at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, as depicted in the events of Return of the Jedi.  As various surviving Imperial factions began to reorganize, the emergent New Republic experienced an internal power struggle between two ideologically divergent parties within its senate. As described in Star Wars: Bloodline, a Centrist coalition (largely consisting of former Imperials) in the New Republic Senate opposes the anti-centralist policies of the Populists, led by Leia Organa, and succeeds to combine with a developing government called “the First Order”, considered to be the successor of the Empire. In the following years, the First Order builds its forces under the autocratic guidance of Supreme Leader Snoke, a proxy for the resurrected Emperor Palpatine. Exploiting the New Republic’s political complacency, it launches a devastating surprise attack on the Republic’s capital and fleet using the Death Star-like superweapon, Starkiller Base. Throughout the sequel films, the First Order demonstrates a high level of military and technological capacity, utilizing Resurgent-class Star Destroyers, advanced TIE fighter variants, and elite ground forces including specialized stormtroopers and heavy assault walkers such as the AT-M6. Central to the plot of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the First Order develops the ability for “hyperspace tracking,” enabling them to pursue Resistance ships through lightspeed. The ultimate loss of leadership through the deaths of Emperor Palpatine alongside Supreme Leader Kylo Ren enables a decisive Resistance-coordinated and civilian-led assault on the Sith Eternal fleet, known as the Final Order, which results in the complete collapse of the First Order during the Battle of Exogol in 35 BBY.\nGalactic Empire\nThe Galactic Empire, simply referred to as the Empire, rose during the waning authority of the Galactic Republic after the Clone Wars. Under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Republic was reorganized into an empire, with Palpatine declaring himself Emperor, as seen in the final acts of Revenge of the Sith. The new imperial regime quickly centralized power, dissolved the Senate’s authority, and imposed strict control over much of the galaxy with little opposition from institutions such as the Jedi Order, which had largely been eradicated through Order 66. The Empire’s conflict with the insurgent Rebel Alliance is the main focus of the original trilogy,  portraying a galaxy-wide civil war between an authoritarian state and a revolutionary movement aiming to restore democratic rule. Central to this conflict is the Empire’s construction of the Death Star, an orbital space station, equipped with a superlaser capable of destroying entire planets. The first Death Star was destroyed by the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Yavin, while the incomplete second Death Star was also destroyed at the Battle of Endor, where the Rebel victory led to the death of Emperor Palpatine and the eventual collapse of the Empire.\nGalactic Republic\nThe Galactic Republic, commonly known as The Republic, is the central protagonistic faction appearing prominently in the Star Wars prequel films. Serving as the primary governing body in the galaxy prior to the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Republic is depicted as a representative democracy with a central legislature known as the Galactic Senate, which includes representatives from numerous star systems and sectors. Executive functions are managed by a Supreme Chancellor, elected by the Senate. It is characterized by a long-standing alliance with the Jedi Order, which serves in roles such as diplomacy and military leadership during times of crisis. The Republic’s three-years involvement in the Clone Wars marked the final phase of its decline, as emergency powers were granted to Palpatine, who centralized authority and limited democratic representation.\nJedi Order\nThe Jedi Order is a monastic, spiritual, and paramilitary organization featured prominently in the Star Wars franchise. Established thousands of years prior to the events of the films, the Order is based on the study and use of the Force, particularly its light side. Its affiliation with the Galactic Republic throughout the prequel films is characterized by its role as peacekeepers. The Order maintains a hierarchical structure headed by the Jedi High Council and operates from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where it oversees the training of Force-sensitive initiates and administers its affairs. Adhering to a strict moral and philosophical code, the Jedi frequently intervene in conflicts across the galaxy at the request of the Republic. Their diminishing influence and growing entanglement in galactic politics ultimately contribute to their downfall during the rise of the Galactic Empire.\nMandalorian\nThe Mandalorians are a group of warrior clans originating from the planet Mandalore and its surrounding systems in the Star Wars universe. Known for their distinctive armor and combat skills, they have a complex culture centered on honor, combat prowess, and clan loyalty. Historically, the Mandalorians have been both mercenaries and conquerors, often involved in conflicts across the galaxy. Their society is marked by a strong martial tradition and a code that values strength and resilience. Mandalorians have appeared throughout Star Wars media, including the animated series The Clone Wars and Rebels, as well as the live-action series The Mandalorian. The character of Boba Fett, a notable bounty hunter who made his debut wearing Mandalorian armor, further popularized the culture. Over time, the Mandalorians have undergone significant changes, from their origins as fierce warriors to becoming more diverse in roles and affiliations.\nRebel Alliance\nThe Rebel Alliance, formally known as the Alliance to Restore the Republic, is a resistance movement in the Star Wars universe that emerges in opposition to the Galactic Empire. Formed from a coalition of dissident systems, former senators, and underground cells, the Alliance seeks to overthrow Imperial rule and restore democratic governance. In the original trilogy, it plays a central role in the Galactic Civil War, beginning with the theft of the Death Star plans and the station’s destruction in A New Hope. The Alliance faces major setbacks in The Empire Strikes Back but ultimately defeats the Empire in the events of Return of the Jedi through a coordinated assault that leads to the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of Emperor Palpatine. Its early activities and formation are further depicted in Rogue One and other expanded media.\nResistance\nThe Resistance is a fictional paramilitary organization in the Star Wars franchise, introduced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) as a response to the rise of the First Order. Formed by General Leia Organa, it operates separately from the New Republic, which maintains a policy of non-intervention toward the First Order. The Resistance engages in reconnaissance, limited military actions, and intelligence gathering, including the destruction of Starkiller Base. In Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), it is reduced to a small remnant following heavy losses. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) depicts its final mobilization alongside civilian and former military forces to confront the First Order and the Sith Eternal on Exegol. The group’s structure and operations draw parallels to the earlier Rebel Alliance, with an emphasis on decentralized command and independent cells.\nSith\nThe Sith are a fictional order of Force-sensitive individuals in the Star Wars franchise who utilize the dark side of the Force. Originating thousands of years before the events of the films, the Sith follow a philosophy centered on the use of passion and power to achieve their objectives. The order is structured around a master-apprentice hierarchy, with teachings emphasizing the acquisition and exercise of personal strength through the dark side. Sith Lords often operate in secrecy and employ manipulation and conflict as tools to consolidate power. Notable Sith figures include Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, who play significant roles in the political and military developments within the galaxy. The Sith serve as primary antagonists in the prequel and original film trilogies, as well as in various expanded universe media.\nTrade Federation\nThe Trade Federation is a large commercial and political organization in the Star Wars franchise, primarily featured in the prequel trilogy. It operates as a powerful trade consortium controlling significant portions of interstellar commerce and shipping. The Federation maintains its own droid army and starship fleet, which it employs to enforce trade blockades and protect its interests. It plays a central role in the events leading up to the Clone Wars, notably initiating a blockade and invasion of the planet Naboo in The Phantom Menace (1999). The Trade Federation’s actions are later revealed to be influenced and manipulated by Sith Lords seeking to destabilize the Galactic Republic.\nSpecies and languages\nHumans\nHumans are a widespread and highly adaptable sentient species in the Star Wars universe, characterized by a bilateral, bipedal physiology and a wide range of phenotypic variation. As the most numerous and politically influential species in the galaxy, humans have played a central role in the development of galactic civilization throughout all major eras of canonical history. Humans are believed to have originated on the Core World of Coruscant, although alternative theories—especially in expanded universe and non-canon sources—suggest other potential ancestral homeworlds such as Corellia or even multiple locations due to early interstellar migration. By the era of the Galactic Republic, humans had colonized thousands of planets, resulting in significant cultural and linguistic diversification across regions. Despite this, the species maintained genetic consistency sufficient to interbreed with certain near-human species. The standard spoken language among humans is Galactic Basic Standard, often abbreviated as Basic. This language functions as the lingua franca of the galaxy and is used for interspecies communication, government proceedings, military operations, and trade. While many species understand Basic, humans are typically monolingual unless trained otherwise, relying on droids or protocol specialists for translation. Humans have constituted the majority of political, military, and administrative leadership across various regimes, including the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, the New Republic, and the Resistance. Their dominance in political structures—particularly under the Galactic Empire—was associated with policies of speciesism and human-centric governance, though subsequent governments took varied approaches to species inclusion. Notable human individuals include Jedi Knights such as Anakin Skywalker and Rey, political leaders such as Padmé Amidala and Leia Organa, and military figures like Han Solo and Cassian Andor.\nWookies\nWookiees are a sentient species native to the forested planet Kashyyyk, located in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy. Characterized by their tall, muscular build and dense fur covering their bodies, Wookiees possess notable physical strength and agility, which they combine with advanced technical skills and a cultural emphasis on loyalty. Their language, Shyriiwook, or Wookieespeak, consists primarily of growls and roars, which are generally unintelligible to non-Wookiees but can be understood by some species, including Chewbacca, among the most notable Wookiee. Wookiees live in large, tree-based communities built high in the dense forests of Kashyyyk, utilizing the natural environment to create intricate villages and defensive structures. Historically, Wookiees have been known for their resistance to slavery and oppression, most notably during their uprising against the Galactic Empire’s enslavement programs. They also played significant roles in various galactic conflicts, including the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War, often allying with the Galactic Republic, the Rebel Alliance, and later the Resistance.\nHutts\nThe Hutts are a sentient slug-like species native to the planet Nal Hutta, located in the Outer Rim Territories. Known for their immense size, longevity, and hedonistic lifestyles, Hutts are among the most influential non-human power brokers in the Star Wars galaxy. They operate through a decentralized criminal syndicate known as the Hutt Cartel, exerting economic and political control over vast regions, particularly Hutt Space and neighboring systems. Although not officially aligned with galactic governments, the Hutts have maintained de facto authority over several Outer Rim sectors, often through corruption, coercion, and organized crime. The dominant language of the species is Huttese, a widespread trade tongue that has evolved into one of the galaxy’s most commonly spoken languages, especially in regions under Hutt influence. While native to the Hutts, Huttese is spoken fluently by many non-Hutt species such as Twi’leks, Rodians, Jawas, and Humans, particularly those involved in smuggling, bounty hunting, or black-market economies. The language features a simple phonetic structure and is typically transcribed using the Latin alphabet, though it also has distinct written scripts. Huttese's extensive use in interstellar commerce, diplomacy, and criminal dealings reflects both the cultural imprint and the socio-economic dominance of the Hutt species. Notable Hutt individuals, such as Jabba Desilijic Tiure, frequently converse in Huttese.\nJawas\nJawas are a rodent-like sentient species native to Tatooine, recognizable by their diminutive stature, glowing yellow eyes, and hooded brown robes. They are scavengers and traders by nature, known primarily for their practice of collecting, repairing, and reselling discarded technology, especially droids and mechanical components. Jawas travel in large, sand-crawling vehicles called sandcrawlers, which serve as both mobile homes and salvage depots. Their society is clan-based, with strong communal ties, and they maintain a barter economy rooted in opportunistic commerce and rapid negotiation tactics. Jawas speak a rapid, high-pitched language known as Jawaese, which is characterized by its tonal modulation and squeaky vocalizations. The language is largely unintelligible to most other species without translation devices or familiarity through trade interactions. Jawaese is distinct from the Basic language, and its structure reflects the secretive and insular nature of Jawa society. While Jawas are most prominently associated with Tatooine, canonical sources suggest the possibility of related subspecies or cultural analogs on other desert worlds.\nWriting Systems\nAurebesh is the primary written script used to represent Galactic Basic Standard, the most widely spoken language in the Star Wars galaxy. It functions as an alphabetic system composed of 26 characters, each corresponding to a letter in the Latin alphabet, along with various ligatures for common letter combinations. Aurebesh is ubiquitous throughout the galaxy and appears on signage, displays, and interfaces across diverse planets and technological systems. While the spoken form of Galactic Basic is commonly rendered in English for media representation, Aurebesh visually differentiates the Star Wars universe by encoding the language in a stylized typographic system. The script was formalized in-universe by the Galactic Republic and continued to be used during the reign of the Galactic Empire, the New Republic, and later political regimes. Aurebesh is not unique to any species and is instead a cross-species, standardized writing system, enabling communication across galactic cultures. In-universe, it serves the same function as a universal script for trade, governance, and technology. Its name derives from the first two letters of its alphabet: \"Aurek\" and \"Besh.\"\nTechnology\nSpace travel\nSpace travel in the Star Wars universe is primarily facilitated by hyperdrive technology, which enables starships to traverse vast interstellar distances by entering hyperspace, an alternate dimension allowing faster-than-light travel. Ships equipped with hyperdrives rely on complex systems including 'hypermatter' reactors and navigational computers to calculate safe routes that avoid gravitational hazards such as stars and black holes. In realspace, ion engines provide sublight propulsion for maneuvering and planetary operations. Comprehensive life support systems maintain habitable environments during extended missions, while advanced communication arrays enable near-instantaneous data exchange across the galaxy. Starships vary widely in design and function—from small fighters to massive capital ships—each optimized for their specific operational requirements, incorporating extensive redundancy and safety measures to ensure mission success in the challenging conditions of space.\nDroids and weapons\nDroids in the Star Wars universe are autonomous or semi-autonomous robotic entities designed to perform a wide range of tasks, from basic labor and maintenance to complex tactical and diplomatic functions. They operate using sophisticated artificial intelligence and programming protocols that enable learning, decision-making, and interaction with organic beings. Droids are constructed from durable materials capable of withstanding diverse environmental conditions, including combat scenarios and space travel. Common classifications include protocol droids, which specialize in communication and translation; astromech droids, which assist with starship navigation and repair; and battle droids, designed for combat operations. Weaponry and defense systems in the Star Wars universe encompass a wide array of advanced technologies designed for offensive and protective purposes across multiple scales, from personal armaments to planetary fortifications. Personal energy weapons, such as blasters, operate by projecting concentrated beams of high-energy plasma or particle bolts capable of inflicting significant damage to organic and inorganic targets. The iconic lightsaber functions through a plasma blade contained within a magnetic field, enabling precise cutting and deflection of energy projectiles. On a larger scale, starships and space stations employ turbolasers and ion cannons, which deliver powerful directed energy or electromagnetic pulses to disable or destroy enemy vessels and infrastructure. Planetary defense systems often include shield generators capable of producing large-scale energy barriers to protect strategic locations from orbital bombardment or invasion. These technologies integrate principles of energy generation, magnetic containment, and directed energy weaponry, reflecting a complex understanding of physics adapted for military applications.\nSpacecraft\nStar Wars features several spacecraft types, each designed for specific operational roles. Starfighters, such as the notable X-wing and TIE fighter, serve as fast, maneuverable combat vessels primarily used in dogfights and small-scale skirmishes. Larger vessels like cruisers and frigates perform multipurpose functions including fleet command, escort, and heavy firepower support; examples include the Mon Calamari cruisers and Imperial Star Destroyers. Transport ships, such as the Corellian freighters, are engineered for cargo hauling and personnel movement, balancing capacity with speed and defensive capabilities. Specialized ships include reconnaissance craft equipped with advanced sensor arrays for intelligence gathering, and troop transports designed for rapid deployment of ground forces. Additionally, capital ships like the Executor-class Super Star Destroyers function as mobile command centers and heavily armed warships capable of projecting power across star systems. Each spacecraft category integrates design features suited to its mission, ranging from agility and speed to firepower and defensive resilience.\nAnalysis\nGeorge Lucas has repeatedly stated in interviews that Joseph Campbell’s work served as a model for the Star Wars universe, which incorporates elements from various philosophies, mythological narratives, academic concepts, theatrical traditions, and religious beliefs. In an interview with Bill Moyers, Lucas revealed that initially he believed mythology played no role in his films, but after researching fairy tales, folklore, and reading Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces, he recognized that his first draft of Star Wars (1977) followed Campbell's classic motifs, thus shaping the film’s narrative. George Lucas intentionally applied Joseph Campbell's monomyth theory in creating Star Wars and later developed a friendship with Campbell after publicly acknowledging his influence on the films. Campbell’s work posits that all cultures have produced fundamentally similar myths throughout history. Recognizing this, Lucas developed a mythic framework designed to resonate widely by incorporating common archetypal elements found in these myths.  Lucas has acknowledged that the Star Wars saga was, in part, conceived as an homage to the film serials popular during the 1930s and 1940s, which he watched growing up. Among the most influential of these was the Flash Gordon series, which featured a space-faring protagonist combating villains across the galaxy—a narrative framework that strongly parallels the premise of Star Wars.\n| alt1              = George Lucas\n| alt2              = Joseph Campbell\n| align             = right\n}}\n|author=George Lucas}}\nIn addition to influences from comic books, science fiction, and film serials, Lucas drew inspiration from historical narratives and American cultural mythology. Much of the popular imagery associated with the American \"Old West\" originated from 19th-century dime novels that dramatized the exploits of historical figures. These stories helped shape archetypes such as the \"lone gunman\"—a figure who often embodied themes of individualism and frontier justice. The Star Wars universe incorporates similar narrative elements, particularly through characters who resemble solitary heroes confronting injustice in a large, untamed setting. These Western-style narratives were often loosely based on real historical figures, including Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and Bat Masterson.\nNazi Germany is one of the most notable historical influences on the depiction of the Galactic Empire in Star Wars. The Empire’s aesthetic and ideological traits—including its emphasis on uniformity and suppression of diversity—mirror those of the Nazi regime. George Lucas explicitly named the Empire's foot soldiers “stormtroopers,” a direct reference to the Nazi Sturmabteilung, or SA, which served as Adolf Hitler’s paramilitary wing. Visual symbolism further reinforces this connection. The Empire is associated with a palette of white (stormtroopers), black (Darth Vader), and red (the Emperor’s Royal Guard)—colors that correspond to the flag of Nazi Germany. The Galactic Empire also functions as a metaphor for authoritarian control in a broader cultural sense, representing a faceless and oppressive regime reminiscent of \"Big Brother\" or \"the man\" in modern discourse. Lucas’s depiction of the Empire draws upon familiar historical and fictional archetypes of tyranny, making its narrative role both accessible and resonant with audiences.\nThe transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire in Star Wars has also been compared to the historical transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. In both cases, a central leader rises to power by exploiting political unrest and military conflict, wherein Roman general Julius Caesar played a key role in dismantling republican governance, paving the way for autocratic rule. Similarly, in the Star Wars narrative, Chancellor Palpatine uses the Clone Wars to justify emergency powers and ultimately establish an authoritarian regime. Further influences on Lucas’s narrative framework include the Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, known for his period dramas set in feudal Japan. Kurosawa’s film The Hidden Fortress (1958), which centers on two peasants escorting a princess and a samurai general, directly inspired several elements of A New Hope (1977), notably the introduction of R2-D2 and C-3PO. In addition to his admiration for Kurosawa, Lucas drew heavily from samurai culture in conceptualizing the Jedi Order.\nAdaptations\nCanonicity\nWhile developing a Star Wars roleplaying game in collaboration with Lucasfilm, Wizards of the Coast game designers felt that an internal database was needed to track new content being developed for the Star Wars franchise. Lucas Licensing initially compiled official Star Wars universe material in reference books called Bibles, containing all canon story synopses and glossaries. This led to the divergence of two majors continuities of the universe: Canon and the Expanded Universe (EU), the latter of which originally served as an extension of the in-universe cannon which appeared in the first six films as well as the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series developed and produced by Lucas. To distinguish these continuities, various levels of canon were established; G-Canon (for “George Lucas canon”) served as the in-universe contents included in Episodes I–VI, while T-Canon (\"Television canon\") and C-Canon (\"Continuity canon\") consisted of the continuities of Lucas’ co-created The Clone Wars and most of the material from the Expanded Universe’s books, comics, and video games. While the expanded material continued to maintain consistency with film and television content, most of the EU was rebranded as Legends in 2014 after Disney’s acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, demarcating it as non-canonical to the universe. A new reconstructed canon was later established under the direction of \"Lucasfilm Story Group\".\nLiterature\nA ghostwritten novelization of the Star Wars (1977) by Alan Dean Foster was one of the earliest depictions of Star Wars in-universe material. Published in 1976, six months prior to the theatrical release of the first film, its contents were largely based on Lucas's original screenplay for the first film, but also elaborated on in-universe lore such as languages, species, planetary systems, and chronology. However, there were several differences and inconsistencies between the film and its novelization. The portrayal of Emperor Palpatine is notably conflicting with Lucas's subsequent films and prequel trilogy, as the novelization presents him less as an all-powerful Sith Lord and more as a politically isolated figure manipulated by his advisors. Following the release of the first film, Alan Dean Fostered was commissioned to write a sequel novel, ''Splinter of the Mind's Eye, published in 1978 as a fallback plan in the event that Star Wars did not perform well in theaters. The novel is considered to be the first installment of the Expanded Universe. Subsequent novelizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were written by Donald F. Glut and  James Kahn, respectively. Several other derivative works would later be added to the EU in the ensuing decades; novelizations depicting alternate plots and variations of canon universe material were included as part of Legends, such as The Han Solo Adventures (1979–80), The Lando Calrissian Adventures (1983), and Thrawn'' (1991–98).\nSee also\n* List of Star Wars planets and moons\n* List of Star Wars creatures\n* Star Wars in other media\nReferences\nPrimary\nSecondary\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
