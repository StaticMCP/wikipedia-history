Historically, the area had been a Talysh khanate. The flag of the Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic and the modern Talysh flag is a vertical tricolour of red, white, and green with a centred rising sun over the blue sea.\nPolitical turmoil\nThe autonomous republic was proclaimed amid political turmoil in Azerbaijan. In June 1993 a military rebellion against president Abulfaz Elchibey broke out under the leadership of Colonel Surat Huseynov. Colonel Alikram Hummatov, a close associate of Huseynov, and the leader of the Talysh nationalists, seized power in the southern part of Azerbaijan and proclaimed the new republic in Lankaran, escalating violence. However, as the situation settled and Heydar Aliyev rose to power in Azerbaijan, the Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic, which failed to gain any significant public support, was swiftly suppressed.\nAlikram Hummatov had to flee Lankaran, when an estimated 10,000 protesters gathered outside his headquarters in the city to demand his ouster.\nAccording to Professor Bruce Parrott,\n, }}\nSome observers believe that this revolt was part of a larger conspiracy to bring back to power the former president Ayaz Mütallibov.\nHummatov was arrested and initially received a death sentence which was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. In 2004, he was pardoned and released from custody under pressure from the Council of Europe. He was allowed to immigrate to Europe after making a public promise not to engage in politics. However, those who were involved in the proclamation of the autonomy say they always envisaged the autonomous republic as a constituent part of Azerbaijan.\nEthnic status\nAccording to some, the Azerbaijani government has also implemented a policy of forceful integration of some minorities, including Talysh, Tat, Kurds and Lezgins. However, according to a 2004 resolution of Council of Europe:\nThe above quote by the Council of Europe was only about the improvements done by the government of Azerbaijan since 2003. The Communique, however, goes on to say:\nIFPRERLOM appealed to the Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution, which urges Azerbaijan to guarantee the preservation of the cultural, religious and national identity of the Talysh people in light of repeated claims of repression.\nSee also\n* Talysh National Movement\n* Talish–Mughan culture\n* Ispahbads of Gilan\n* Talysh Khanate\n* Mughan Soviet Republic\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/az_taly.html Flags of the World]"
