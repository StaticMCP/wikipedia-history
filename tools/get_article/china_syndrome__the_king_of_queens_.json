The episode has the length of two regular episodes, being counted as the twelfth and thirteenth episodes of the ninth season, and the 206th and the 207th episodes overall, running about 45 minutes without commercials. It was filmed March 15, 2007, and originally aired on CBS on May 14, 2007. The episode was written by series co-creator Michael J. Weithorn and directed by Rob Schiller.\nPlot\nDoug is furious when he learns Carrie has not given up the apartment in Manhattan as she promised, despite quitting his job as an IPS driver in favor of a new job as a salesperson at her request. Doug does not want to attend her father Arthur's wedding to Ava St. Clair, which takes place in Poughkeepsie; instead, he stays at home watching The Price is Right, and several references to the game show are made, including contestants bidding on a prize, and Doug yelling to the TV that \"the Rice-a-Roni is much cheaper than the Turtle Wax\" and ranting about how \"Ensign Curtis just cost himself a trip to the Showcase Showdown\". However, his best friend Deacon Palmer takes him to Poughkeepsie anyway.\nAva St. Clair reveals to Carrie that after a few failed marriages, she now only marries gay men. Ava later learns that Arthur is not gay and promptly leaves the ceremony without informing Arthur. Carrie attempts to comfort Arthur by telling him, \"She had wanted a companion.\" Arthur refuses to announce that the wedding is off, and proposes to Veronica Olchin, Spence's mother in the men's room. She at first declines, but later accepts. Carrie and Spence are both surprised and against the decision. The ceremony is performed by Rabbi Feldman, because the original bride Ava was Jewish, although neither Arthur nor Veronica is Jewish. The wedding ends with Arthur smashing a glass with his foot, while everyone cheers, \"Mazel tov!\".\nImmediately afterward, Carrie is notified that the baby she and Doug wanted to adopt, Ming-Mei, is waiting for them in Beijing. However, Doug does not want to go through with the adoption process because of her betrayal regarding the apartment. A very pregnant Holly also shows up at the wedding, as does the Heffernans’ neighbor, Lou Ferrigno. When Lou tries to cheer everyone up by proclaiming it's \"such a happy day,\" he is met with unhappy expressions.\nSpence apologizes to Danny for the way he left things when moving out. Danny forgives him, but when Spence alludes to moving back in, Danny reveals he has a girlfriend (and roommate), Sandy, thereby declining.\nDoug then makes an offer to Spence to become his new roommate, since he is divorcing Carrie, but later retracts the offer when Holly tells him her story. At this point, it is also revealed that Holly's husband left her. Very drunk, Doug challenges each of them to a wrestling match, but falls asleep while fighting with Holly. When Arthur learns that Doug is unable to toast him as his best man due to him being intoxicated, he pitches the role to Spence, who turns it down. Ultimately, Deacon is forced to make the toast despite not knowing Arthur very well.\nHolly and Spence talk and realize that they both do not have a place to stay, so they decide to get an apartment together. Danny returns without Sandy, and suggests that Spence and he move back in together. Spence happily accepts, leaving Holly without a place to stay once again.\nMeanwhile, Kelly points out to Carrie that she should not feel so guilty about keeping the apartment because Doug has let Carrie down many times in the past. Carrie is convinced and tells Doug off. Both decide that they want to get Ming-Mei for themselves and race to beat each other to China. While Carrie leaves the house first, Doug has to find his passport, which Deacon locates in the vegetable crisper. Back at the wedding, Holly meets Rabbi Feldman and they hit it off; Holly decides to move in with him and convert to Judaism.\nDoug later surprises Carrie aboard the plane, and they use the long flight to sort out their problems and remain together. After getting Ming-Mei from the adoption agency, Carrie discovers she is pregnant. She is scared about the changes to come, but Doug is optimistic that they will be able to handle it together.\nThe episode fast-forwards one year and shows Doug and Carrie each carrying one of their crying infant children attempting to calm them down. Arthur suddenly barges in through the front door with a suitcase, announcing that he and Veronica's marriage \"didn't work out.\" Suitcase in hand, he goes straight to the basement, leaving Doug and Carrie speechless.\nThe episode ends with a three-minute montage of scenes from the show's nine seasons to A Million Billion's song \"Milk & Honey\".  As the song concludes, the series ends with a final screen shot: \"thanks for the ride...\". This montage is not included in the version released on Blu-ray or in syndication; in those versions, the episode ends immediately after the living room scene.\nCast\n* Kevin James&nbsp;as Doug Heffernan\n* Leah Remini&nbsp;as Carrie Heffernan\n* Jerry Stiller&nbsp;as Arthur Spooner\n* Victor Williams&nbsp;as Deacon Palmer\n* Patton Oswalt&nbsp;as Spence Olchin\n* Gary Valentine&nbsp;as Danny Heffernan\n* Merrin Dungey&nbsp;as Kelly Palmer\n* Nicole Sullivan&nbsp;as Holly Shumpert\n* Anne Meara&nbsp;as Veronica\n* Lou Ferrigno&nbsp;as Himself\n* Lainie Kazan&nbsp;as Ava St. Clair\n* Josh Cooke&nbsp;as Rabbi Feldman\n* Jillian Bach&nbsp;as Sandy\n* Jackie Flynn&nbsp;as Band Leader\n* Adam Ferrara&nbsp;as Waiter\n* Carla Ferrigno&nbsp;as Carla\n* Shelby Adamowsky&nbsp;as Eloise\n* Shannon Farrara&nbsp;as Shannon\nOriginal airings by country\n* USA – The episode originally aired on CBS on May 14, 2007.
