The opposing forces were the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by General Khalifa Haftar, and the Government of National Accord (GNA), headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.\nInitial Offensives\nThe offensive commenced on April 4, 2019, with the LNA  capturing Gharyan on the first day. Subsequently, on April 8, 2019, reports from Libya al-Ahrar TV, as cited by The Libya Observer, indicated the arrival of a team of French \"military experts\" in Gharyan. These experts reportedly established a control room to monitor the attack on Tripoli, suggesting international involvement in the conflict.\nOn April 10, the GNA reported launching airstrikes on LNA targets within Gharyan. By April 15, the LNA military information division announced the arrival of \"large reinforcements\" in LNA-controlled Gharyan, signaling preparations for an intensified assault on the capital, Tripoli.\nHaftar's advances and GNA counterattacks\nOn May 13, the GNA declared that Haftar's forces had gained control over Tripoli airport and secured full control over Gharyan. However, the GNA air force continued to target these areas. On June 26, the GNA claimed the recapture of Gharyan, citing the deaths of numerous LNA soldiers in the town and the capture of at least 18 others. GNA's air force further targeted LNA convoys withdrawing from the area.\nBetween 20 and 29 August 2019, the LNA made several unsuccessful attempts to recapture Gharyan. The GNA, on the other hand, claimed on October 7 that UAE's drones had carried out attacks in Gharyan, south of the capital Tripoli.\nReferences"
