It had no recorded population as of the 2010 Census.\nHistory\nPromyshlenny was established in 1956 as a mining community in relation to the \"Tsentralnoy\" and \"Promyshlennoy\" coal mines. The housing was built by convicts who worked at the mines. A major underground explosion in 1998 killed 23 miners and closed the mines. This led to a rapid economic decline and as a consequence the authorities decided to resettle the population elsewhere. The population prior to the explosion was a little over 1,000 people.\nAdministrative and municipal status\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, the urban-type settlement of Promyshlenny is subordinated to Vorgashor Urban-Type Settlement Administrative Territory, which is itself subordinated to the town of republic significance of Vorkuta. Within the framework of municipal divisions, Promyshlenny is a part of Vorkuta Urban Okrug.\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n__NOTOC__"
