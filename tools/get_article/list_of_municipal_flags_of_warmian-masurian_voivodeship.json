It may also include the coat of arms or emblem of the administrative unit concerned. In Poland, territorial units (municipal, city and county councils) may establish flags in accordance with the Act of 21 December 1978 on badges and uniforms. In its original version, it only allowed territorial units to establish coats of arms. Despite that, many cities and municipalities, including those in the Warmińsko-Mazurskie Voivodeship, adopted resolutions and used the flag as their symbol. It was not until the ‘Act of 29 December 1998 amending certain acts in connection with the implementation of the state system reform’ that the right of Voivodeships, powiats and municipalities to establish this symbol of a territorial unit was officially confirmed.\nIn 2024, 63 out of 116 municipalities in Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship had their own flag. This symbol, since 2002, has been established by the voivodeship itself.\nList of valid municipal flags\nBartoszycki County\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Municipality\n!Flag\n!Description\n|-\n|City of Bartoszyce\n|\n|The town's flag is a rectangular flag with proportions ranging from 2:3 to 5:8 in black, with a white stripe in the upper part and a white axe in the central part.
