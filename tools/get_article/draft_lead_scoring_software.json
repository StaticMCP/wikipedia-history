It appears as native functionality in many customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing automation platforms and also exists as stand-alone products that integrate with those systems.  In practice, scores are derived from explicit “fit” attributes (e.g., firmographic or demographic data) and observed engagement (e.g., email, web, and content interactions).  Organizations use these scores to route and time outreach, align marketing with sales, and improve pipeline efficiency.\nWhat is lead scoring\nLead scoring is a method of ranking leads by assigning numeric values that approximate purchase propensity or sales readiness. Scores typically combine “fit” data (such as industry, company size, or role) with behavioral signals (such as page views, content downloads, or email engagement).  Many teams operationalize lead scoring inside CRMs or marketing automation platforms to trigger routing, alerts, and campaign steps.  Models can be rules-based (point systems maintained by practitioners) or predictive (statistical/ML models trained on historical conversions).  Predictive approaches apply machine learning to past outcomes to prioritize current leads at scale.  The business objective is to focus sales effort on high-potential prospects, reduce response latency, and increase conversion efficiency.\nA brief history of lead scoring\nContemporary lead scoring emerged alongside enterprise marketing automation in the mid-to-late 2000s, when vendors such as Eloqua popularized configurable scoring models within campaign platforms. By the early 2010s, a wave of start-ups advanced “predictive lead scoring,” raising venture funding to apply data science to qualification.  Enterprise buyers subsequently saw predictive models integrated into major CRMs.  Industry consolidation followed, including the 2017 acquisition of Infer by IgniteTech.\nThe business goal behind lead scoring\nThe principal aim is to prioritize scarce sales resources toward leads with higher probability of conversion and appropriate fit, improving win rates and reducing cycle times. Well-governed scoring programs are also used to align marketing and sales around a shared definition of qualification and handoff thresholds.  Peer-reviewed research in B2B contexts associates lead prioritization with improved revenue outcomes when models are trained on historical conversions and updated with current engagement.  In practice, organizations deploy scoring to automate routing, sequence outreach, and time offers, often within broader sales-automation initiatives.\nDifferent types of lead scoring\n;Rule-driven point scoring\nPractitioners assign positive and negative points to defined attributes and behaviors (for example, job role or pricing-page visits) and set thresholds for “marketing qualified lead” (MQL) handoff.\n;Predictive scoring\nStatistical models estimate conversion likelihood from historical outcomes and current activity data, producing scores without manually maintained rules.\n;Scoring with machine learning\nSupervised learning methods (e.g., tree-based, ensemble, or neural models) learn patterns in past won/lost outcomes and rank current leads accordingly.\n;Lead grading\n“Grading” evaluates fit (e.g., firmographics or role) separately from engagement, often expressed as letter grades that complement behavioral scores.\n;Lead vs. account scoring\nIn account-based marketing, scoring can be applied to entire buying centers by aggregating contact signals and firmographic data at the account level. Industry reporting has described account-level predictive scoring as distinct from lead-level models.\nNative lead scoring features vs. stand-alone add-on lead scoring solutions examples\nMajor platforms embed lead scoring as native functionality Separately, specialized vendors offer stand-alone or add-on scoring that connects to CRMs and marketing tools via integrations.  Stand-alone products may focus on predictive modeling, additional behavioral data, or cross-system synchronization beyond the core platform’s native features.\nLead scoring vendors in the market\n;Stand-alone lead scoring platforms\n* Infer: A predictive scoring vendor backed by venture funding in the 2010s that offered lead and account scoring; Infer was acquired by IgniteTech in 2017.\n* SalesWings: A stand-alone scoring and behavioral tracking tool listed by third-party software directories as providing lead and account scoring integrated with Salesforce ecosystems.\n* Outfunnel: An integration-focused marketing tool that includes web-tracking and lead-scoring features, covered by independent reviews and directories.\n;Native lead scoring features\n* Salesforce Einstein: Einstein Lead Scoring is integrated into Salesforce and uses machine learning on a customer’s historical conversion data to prioritize current leads.\n* HubSpot (native lead scoring): Independent reviews note that HubSpot provides lead-scoring capabilities within its platform tiers.\n* Marketo (Adobe Marketo Engage): Marketo supports configurable person/lead scoring programs as part of its marketing automation suite.\nSee also\n* Marketing automation\n* Customer relationship management\nReferences"
