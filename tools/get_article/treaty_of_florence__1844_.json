These areas featured complex boundaries and numerous enclaves.\nBackground\nThe Congress of Vienna and the related  assigned the Duchy of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla to Marie Louise of Austria, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife, for her lifetime. She was a distant cousin of the other sovereigns involved, who were all interrelated.\nUpon Marie Louise’s death, the Duchy of Parma was to revert to the legitimate rulers, the Bourbon-Parma, who had been temporarily appointed Dukes of Lucca, taking possession of the territories of the former Republic of Lucca, dissolved by Napoleon in .\nThe Congress of Vienna granted the Grand Duke of Tuscany the right of reversion over Lucca when the Bourbons moved to Parma, with territorial compensations for the Duchy of Modena. Modena was also set to incorporate the neighboring Duchy of Massa and Carrara, which occurred in 1829, upon the death of the last Duchess Maria Beatrice d'Este, who was succeeded by her son and heir apparent Francis IV, Duke of Modena.\nSigning and changes from Vienna and Paris\nAfter prolonged secret negotiations in Florence, on , representatives of Tuscany, Modena, and Lucca, in the presence of ambassadors from the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Habsburgs, agreed to modify the decisions made in Vienna and Paris nearly 30 years earlier.\nUpon the death of Marie Louise (who was deliberately kept unaware of the treaty), Parma would revert to the Bourbon-Parma, and Lucca would simultaneously pass to Tuscany, as planned. Many territorial cessions from Tuscany to Modena were confirmed, including the Tuscan vicariate of Fivizzano in Lunigiana and Lucca’s enclaves of Gallicano, Minucciano, Castiglione, and Montignoso (the latter including the entire Lake Porta, previously shared with Tuscany’s Pietrasanta enclave).\nIn return, Modena relinquished claims to the vicariates of Pietrasanta (excluding part of Lake Porta) and Barga (except territories on the northern Apennines slope), which the Congress of Vienna had slated for annexation. Grand Duke Leopold II fiercely defended these territories, viewed as quintessentially Tuscan, historically tied to Florence, and set to become contiguous with other Tuscan lands upon Lucca’s reversion.\nIn exchange for Modena’s renunciation of Pietrasanta and Barga, Tuscany agreed to transfer all its Lunigiana enclaves except Fivizzano (Pontremoli, Bagnone, Groppoli, Lusuolo, Terrarossa, Calice, Albiano, etc.) to Parma. Parma, in turn, ceded the former Duchy of Guastalla to Modena, and would henceforth be known only as the “Duchy of Parma and Piacenza.” Critics, dissatisfied with trading Guastalla’s fertile lands for underdeveloped mountainous regions, mockingly referred to it as “Parma, Piacenza, and annexed stones.”\nAdditionally, the treaty stipulated that the two Emilian duchies would rationalize their borders by mutually exchanging territories along the Enza River and in Lunigiana. Modena received parts of Brescello (Coenzo a Mane, Sorbolo a Mane), Poviglio, Gattatico, portions of Canossa (Ciano, Canossa and Rossena castles, Borzano d’Enza, Compiano, Gombio, Roncaglio), and parts of the “Valley of the Knights” (Succiso, Miscoso, Cecciola, Lugolo, Castagneto, Poviglio, Storlo, Pieve S. Vincenzo, Temporia, Cereggio). Parma gained Scurano and Bazzano. In Lunigiana, to eliminate mutual enclaves, the states agreed to amicably exchange the former Tuscan territories of Albiano, Calice, Riccò, and Terrarossa (ceded to Parma under another treaty clause) for Modena’s former imperial fiefs of Treschietto, Villafranca, Castevoli, and Mulazzo, held since 1815.\nLucca crisis and Modena-Tuscany dispute\nIn , Lucca faced demands for liberal reforms, already granted in Tuscany, directed at Duke Charles Louis. After initially resisting and making minor concessions, he fled to Modena under pressure, transforming the Council of State into a Regency Council.\nOn , Charles Louis abdicated in favor of Leopold II of Tuscany, who granted him a substantial annual pension until he assumed the Duchy of Parma, which occurred soon after on , following Marie Louise’s sudden death.\nThe treaty’s implementation and public reactions were anticipated by the three sovereigns (Leopold II, Charles II, and Francis V):\n* In Lucca, fears of being pawns in territorial deals were eased by Leopold II’s conciliatory approach, including abolishing the death penalty for new subjects (formally in force in Tuscany but unused since 1830).\n* In Pontremoli and Fivizzano (Lunigiana), populations resisted transitioning from Tuscany’s lenient rule to the stricter governance of the Bourbon-Parma and Habsburg-Este.\n* Pontremoli protested its cession to Parma by sending a delegation to Leopold II, with locals threatening to burn the city, following the Moscow fire of 1812 example.\n* In Fivizzano, Modena’s troops faced and harshly suppressed a local uprising.\nIn Tuscany, calls emerged for Leopold II to declare war on Modena and Parma. To avoid conflict and retain territory, Leopold offered substantial financial compensation to both sovereigns to forgo annexations. Charles II, burdened by debt, accepted, but Francis V of Modena refused.\nUltimately, Austrian pressure ensured the treaty’s clauses were enforced, allowing Parma and Modena to occupy the ceded territories.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Vienna (1815)\n* Italian unification\n* House of Habsburg-Lorraine\n* Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\n* Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
