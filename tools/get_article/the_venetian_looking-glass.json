Shakespeare-on-film scholar Judith Buchanan concludes that the film was \"probably only mildly Shakespearean.\"\nThe film was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 699–701 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as une mésaventure de Schylock (\"a misadventure of Shylock\"). It is currently presumed lost.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
