The album was released via BNA Records in 1994. It contains the singles \"My Night to Howl,\" \"If You Came Back from Heaven,\" and \"Heart Over Mind.\" Also included are covers of George Jones' \"A Good Year for the Roses\", recorded here as a duet with Sammy Kershaw, and Jeannie Seely's \"Don't Touch Me.\" The cassette version of the album omits the track \"Exit 99.\"\nThom Owens of Allmusic rated the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that \"Morgan still sings beautifully, but her clean contemporary country arrangements are as predictable as her material. The three hit singles[…]hold up really well.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAs listed in liner notes.\n*Michael Black – background vocals\n*Larry Byrom – acoustic guitar, electric guitar\n*Glen Duncan – fiddle, mandolin\n*Paul Franklin – steel guitar, Dobro\n*Vicki Hampton – background vocals\n*Dann Huff – electric guitar\n*Mitch Humphries – keyboards\n*Jana King – background vocals\n*Alison Krauss – background vocals\n*Paul Leim – drums\n*Carl Marsh – keyboards\n*Brent Mason – electric guitar\n*Terry McMillan – harmonica, percussion\n*Lorrie Morgan – vocals\n*Steve Nathan – organ\n*Cindy Richardson-Walker – background vocals\n*Brent Rowan – acoustic guitar, electric guitar\n*Lisa Silver – background vocals\n*Pam Tillis – background vocals\n*Billy Joe Walker Jr. – acoustic guitar\n*Dennis Wilson – background vocals\n*Glenn Worf – bass guitar, upright bass\n*Curtis \"Mr. Harmony\" Young – background vocals\nStrings performed by the Asa Drori Orchestra, arranged by Charles Calello.
