In the , Milman had a population of 122 people.\nGeography\nAlligator Creek, a tributary of the Fitzroy River, forms the western boundary of the locality. The Bruce Highway and North Coast railway line pass through the south-west corner of the locality, which was served by the Milman railway station () which opened in 1913 but has since been abandoned.\nThe land use is farming, predominantly cattle grazing.\nHistory\nThe locality is named after its railway station, which was named Milman on 20 October 1918 having previously been known as Jardine. It is thought that the Milman name refers to public servant Hugh Miles Milman who married Katherine Maule Jardine in 1871.\nJardine Provisional School opened on 11 August 1913, becoming Jardine State School on 1 December 1914. It was renamed Milman State School about 1934.\nSettlement by the German immigrants\nMilman was established as a settlement by German immigrants, known as \"The Alligator Creek Group\" in 1910. The district was known as Jardine because this was name given to the Parish of land. (This discussion deals only with the German settlers who arrived in 1910 and not with the portions 1 to 20 of the Jardine Parish located along The Caves–Rossmoya Road, and the main road heading north, that were accessible and many had been settled prior to 1910.) The parish had not been surveyed beyond those accessible blocks and was virgin bushland when the German Immigrants came in 1910.\nThe migration of Germans came out of the initiative of Queensland Premier William Kidson of Queensland (19 January 1906 to 19 November 1907 and 18 February 1908 to 7 February 1911) who established a program to bring immigrants to Queensland to open the rural land. Kidson established a program calling for immigrants including Nominated Immigrants who were sponsored by residents of Queensland and the Queensland Government provided passage assistance. For example, a family had to pay £4 instead of £12/10/- for a ship passage from London. A Reverend Michael Bernoth of the Seven Day Adventist Church and resided in Gatton Queensland established a relationship and understanding with the State Government to bring a large of Queensland of Immigrants (just under 100) to Jardine. (Bernoth also undertook the migration of another group of Germans to Ambrose Siding on the Gladstone-Rockhampton Railway, between Raglan and Mount Larcombe, also in 1910 - after the Jardine/Alligator Creek Group. A Pastor Niemeyer undertook the immigration of Germans commencing about 1909 under a similar arrangement with the State Government but to the Bundaberg area. Immigration was undertaken by a State government; following Federation (of Australia) in 1901; immigration responsibility had not yet transferred to the Federal Government by 1910.)\nThere was much adversity for the immigrants to get to Australia. The immigrants for Jardine came principally from the impoverished working class residents of eastern Berlin. With the diplomatic conflict between Germany and England tensions high in the mid-1910s, owing to Germany's military expansionism, and the German Kaiser had forbidden any immigrants leaving Germany to other than German colonies. This meant immigrants had to first get to a foreign port to immigrate. The Jardine immigrants had to secretly leave Berlin and travel to London, through Amsterdam Holland, to board a ship for Queensland with the assistance of The Queensland Agent General. All communication prior to departure from Berlin was necessary by word of mouth to select the immigrants and secretly. No one could tell anyone they were leaving otherwise the police would have jailed the intending immigrants; school children could not tell their friends they would not be at school the next day.\nEconomic factors in Germany were a motivation for immigration. Germany has been a booming industrial power from the formation of Germany in 1871 up to 1900. From the beginning of 1908 something of a revival occurred to the German migration to Queensland, with a total of 778 settlers landing in Brisbane between February 1908 and the middle of 1910. This phenomenon was not unconnected with the downturn of the business cycle in Germany that commenced in 1907. While Niemeyer's emigrants were poor, they were positively well-off in comparison to most of those brought out by Bernoth. The latter included, according to Berlin police, persons who had been on poor relief; number of the Jardine immigrants would have been unemployed.\nThe first ship load of immigrants (brought to Australia from London aboard the S.S. Omrah) arrived on the banks of Alligator Creek on 11 January 1910. The second ship load of immigrants departed London on Friday 28 January 1910 and arrived on the banks of the Alligator Creek in late April 1910 having berthed in Brisbane aboard the S.S. Oswestry Grange on 23 March 1910. These immigrants had travelled by train from Berlin to Amsterdam to get to London undetected by the German authorities. The first ship's immigrants were affected by dengue fever upon arrival in Brisbane. When the second ship arrived the immigrants complained to the Imperial German Consul about the poor and contaminated food, and the poor hygiene of catering staff, on the vessel – this resulted in a Government inquiry and the complaint was upheld. Both ships were freighters rather than passenger ships and the immigrants were accommodated under canvas on-deck. Some German's, believed to be those who abandoned Alligator Creek in January, met the second ship and emphasised to their countrymen the unsatisfactory conditions. Five men travelled to Alligator Creek to assess the conditions and report to the immigrants. A number of families did not proceed as planned to settle in Jardine.\nWhile in most other districts land would be surveyed and buyers would purchase surveyed blocks, the land in Jardine had not been surveyed before immigrants arrived and therefore the portions were unknown. On 18 November 1909 Mr. Staff Surveyor Ellis was instructed to ‘at once design the area’ - about 22,000 acres for Agricultural Farm selection; the scrub land into 160 acres; superior forest into 320 acres, and inferior forest into 640 to 1280 acre blocks. On 29 November 1909 Mr Ellis was additionally requested to make out one or more of the principal roads so that the Germans may be employed in clearing and forming the roads immediately on their arrival; permanent survey of the farms would follow. As early as mid November 1909 there was agreement by the Government, in response to Rev. M. Bernoth's request, that the immigrant men be employed clearing roads and ‘otherwise improving the area reserved for them’ but the Government directed that the cost of such improvement is added to the price of the land. If this had not been done the immigrants would have needed to find paid employment elsewhere. Mr. Ellis commenced the survey work on 29 November.\nInspector Turner of the Department of Works oversaw the settling-in of the immigrants and the road building works; his tenure was almost 12 months. He worked closely with the Lands Department, the surveyor and the Government in Brisbane. He was highly critical of the immigrant's manual skills both initially and even in his final report. These men were not skilled in using hand tools for the purposes of road building and had to be taught those skills; their professions were (in decreasing order of numbers) Labourers, Locksmiths, Blacksmiths, Cabinet Makers, Stonemasons, Carpenters, Painters, Engineers, Joiners, Dairyman, Tailor, Gardener, Butcher, Tinsmith, Furniture Polisher, Iron Worker, Spinner, Cigar Maker, Mechanic, Gunsmith and Miner.\nInspector Turner can be credited with an enormous effort on his part to help them establish and even helping them during periods of extremely heavy rain and flooding of Alligator Creek (at one time swimming two flooded creeks to report their safety and arrange safety checking by the Yaamba Police ). The first ship load of immigrants arrived amid torrential rain on 11 January 1910 and already local flooding of streams feeding the Alligator Creek required that the settlers had to be taken by dray an additional distance of about 1½ Miles through the bush (expected to be along ridge lines to avoid flooded creeks). It was so boggy (‘4½ miles of sludge’) on the dirt tracks that the Inspector had to abandon the transfer from the landing point (forde – probably what is now Plentiful Creek Rd) on the Alligator Creek to the German Camp No 1 on the first day. The rain was so persistent that the balance of their goods, were not be delivered to their camp until 22 January.\nOn 18 January 1910 he reported finding ‘their camp in such an insanitary condition’. The immigrants had no bush skills, and the excessive rain would have inundated the site even though it was on a rise. He spent the day helping to reorganise the camp rather than starting work on the roads. This camp, which Turner had personally selected, was located on what was to become Portion 52 when the parish of Jardine was surveyed; close to the boundary of Portion 51 and less than 200 meters from Alligator Creek. The settlers on the S.S. Oswestry arrived mid-late April and were located closer to the railway station (opened 1913), on the left of Milman Road and also bounded by Canal Creek Rd (later to become Alligator Creek Rd – never to become trafficable, because of the deep ‘Black Gully’, which the authorities never made into a road. The site of the second camp was known on the maps variably as ‘Reserve’, Water Reserve (W.R.) and later was established as Portion 101 when no longer needed as public land.\nCamp 1 was an area 184’ [60 metres] by 99’ [32 metres] with a \"bough shed 40’ (12m) by 13’ (4m) [presumably a common gathering place] in the middle, and eight fireplaces behind two rows of tents on each long side; a total of 30 tents for 25 families . These settlers had come from the poor areas of eastern Berlin (principally but not entirely) to canvas tents in the middle of heavy summer rains in virgin scrub. The conditions must have been unbearable as the rain was torrential; six families abandoned the camp by 20 January and a scathing letter was published in the Truth newspaper Brisbane about the conditions.\nThe first survey map was not published until about 11 April 1910; only then could the immigrants consider what blocks they may wish to acquire but the second ship immigrants had not yet arrived.  By the time the immigrants on board the Oswestry Grange arrived at Alligator Creek the roads were almost complete so the Government extended the paid employment of men to fell 10 acres of land on 30 portions in the initial survey of 42 portions. This survey only included Jardine proper and did not include North Jardine – it comprised portions 23 to 64. By unknown negotiations Portions 70 and 71 were added and these portions had 10 acres cleared as well; part of the 30. The unusual circumstances resulted in the settlers being allowed to occupy their land before they had signed a Lease with the Government. The settlers had to compete: an ‘Application by Alien For Certificate’, an ‘Application to Select an Agricultural Farm’ and they needed obtain a ‘Certificate that Alien is able to Read and Write from Dictation’ before being granted a ‘Licence to Occupy an Agricultural Farm’ and then sign the Lease.\nThe Parish was initially reserved for those known as \"The Alligator Creek Group\" and when the Government advertised the land for sale it was publicly listed for purchase exclusively by that group. There is no documentation to substantiate this but there are suggestions that the first group of immigrants believed they should have been given priority for the selection of the land because they had been working hard for almost four months building the roads before the second group arrived. There was in fact a ‘ballot’ conducted within The Alligator Creek Group, presumably overseen by Reverend Bernoth, who must have negotiated an equitable outcome; held sometime after the second boat load of settlers arrived but before August. The ballot was in fact only for the 160-acre lots because the one 512 acre lot (Portion 45), five surveyed 320 acre blocks (Portions 42, 43, 44, 46 and 47), and two unsurveyed blocks (Portions 71 and 72  - also 320 acres) were ‘agreed’ (as to who would get them), under some controversy, before the ballot. Also, there must have been an agreement with the Government that the outcome of this ballot within the Group would be accepted as applicants for the land once it came to be released by the Rockhampton Land Court. Most settlers moved from their Camps progressively and by mid September only three families remained in camps . The first release of the land in the Land Court was not until 7 December 1911 in the Government Gazette.\nThe Gazette did not identify the full conditions of sale but it clearly stated they were for selection by \"The Alligator Creek Group\". There was no specific reference to them being German. There were strict conditions to be fulfilled:\n* To occupy within six months and occupy continuously thereafter - for the first five years by personal residence and then by \"continuous and bona-fide residence by yourself or your register bailiff\"; Forfeiture would occur if the leasor failed to occupy as required (exemptions could be applied for so they could be employed off farm).\n* To clear 10-acres within six months (this was overtaken by the fact the Government paid the immigrants wages to clear these 10 acres but this recovered through the Survey Fee)\n* An annual payment equal to one-fortieth of the purchase price to be made annually by 31 March; a survey fee must be paid in equal annual installments for four years. Failure to pay may result in forfeiture but can be paid within 21 days with a 10 percent per centum penalty.\n* Within five years the land must be enclosed with a \"good and substantial fence\" and permanent improvements undertaken equal to the value of such fence; the leasor was required to \"apply to the Commissioner for a certificate.\" (a condition to cultivate an area was removed from the Notice of Approval they were given. Again, forfeiture was stated should they not comply.\n* After five years and the required improvements had been affected they could apply for a Deed of Grant (freehold) provided they paid off the balance of the purchase price (40 years rent). They were required to apply for Deed of Grant within 12 months of the expiration of the lease or again forfeiture was stated.\nThe gap between the settlers moving to their blocks (late 1910) and the first release of land (7 Dec 1911), was caused by the need of the Government to determine how the settlers were going to be indebted for the additional costs the Government had incurred. The Government wanted to be repaid for the wages it had paid the settlers and also for a provision of Galvanised Iron roofing material/sheets that had been arranged by Inspector Turner and Reverend Bernoth (a Government controlled item at the time). The establishment of Jardine was rather unique. In the end the Government established a price for the Land and the settlers would be mortgagees to the government's Agricultural Bank but the settlers would pay rent to Government at a rate per acre per year. In addition, the Government introduced an additional fee upon the settlers that was titled a \"Survey Fee\" at a rate per year per portion of land, for four years, to recover the cost borne by the Government for the additional assistance they determined had been given the settlers.\nTo demonstrate what the settlers paid, Portion 44 is used as an example. Portion 44 was a 320-acre portion (exactly). This portion had a rent of 5 pence per acre per year (a total of £6/13/4 per year) and a purchase price of 16/8 per acre (£266/13/8). The Survey Fee  of  £2/5/10 per year, for four years, was added. This Survey Fee did not appear in the Government Gazette releasing the land for sale and therefore was a non-transparent cost.\nThe financial structure required the selector signing a lease with the Government to pay the Rent and Survey Fee and also a mortgage to the Agricultural Bank of Queensland. While the bank did not receive payments they had the power to foreclose if the selector fell behind in payments; this occurred, for example, to Friedrich Herrmann Richard Lamain (Portion 54) when the bank disposed of the property to James Stafford Heaslip on 18 September 1929. Mr. Heaslip then continued the payments until freehold title was granted on 3 January 1936.\nThe original settlers who set out from Germany, with all the unknowns and risks, who stuck it out through all the challenges that were placed before them and moved on to land, were: from the S. S. Omrah - Herman August Ebelt (Portion 71), Gustaf W. Ebelt (son)(40), Gustav Karl Priebst (55), Friedrich Herrmann Richard Lamain (54), Max Scheibe (51), Max Kossendey (36), Willy Bernhard Ernst Kossendey (39)(brothers), Ernst Lewandowsky (senior), Friedrich Ernst Lewandowsky (son)(settled together on Portion 35), Paul Lewandowsky(son)(37), Max Menzel (33) and Anton Nawrath (27); and from the S. S. Oswestry Grange; Otto Reinhold Paul Hanschen (72), Karl Friedrich Loose (45), George Lennig (42), Fredrich Wilhelm Curt  Henke (38), Otto Haase (28) and Heinrich Gottlieb Albert Detjen (44). All the men had families except Bernhard Kossendey and Otto Hanschen; unfortunately, Anton Nawrath fell ill and about August 1914 had to surrender his portion of land.\nWhile some of the immigrants who came on the two ships abandoned the settlement before  the immigrants even obtained their blocks (5 families left within 9 days), some additional Germans joined The Alligator Creek Group; informal communication within the German community was strong and there was plenty of press – Mr. Bernoth kept a high profile in support of his activity. Those who had not come on the two ships and were given portions of land in the early settlement of the Parish when  priority was still being given to immigrants being proposed by the Reverend Bernoth included: Louis Heinrich Wilhelm Meyer (Portion 57 – Mr Meyer an older man and unfortunately he died in 1916; portion taken over by F. Hermann Kunze), Gustav Schulz (53), Franz Joseph Vogel (58), Oswald Reinhard Neubert (56), Johann Gardey (25), Ferdinand Arthur Bahlinger (26), Ernest Bauer (30), A. Radeno (41), Franz Sommerfeld (46), Franz Maleszka (48), Paul Grillmeier (47), Fritz Eske (29), Alfred Yung (75), Willi Yung (son)(74), Franz Grahl (43), Otto Raders (23);  , Gustav Schulz is known to have been single. The last to be granted land as a member of the Alligator Creek Group in the Rockhampton Land Court on the 5 September 1914 was Gustaf Adolf Kerk. However, some of these did not seem to be Nominated Immigrants.\nThe Kerk family were Nominated Immigrants by Max Scheibe. Mr Scheibe's wife, Martha Scheibe, drowned in Alligator Creek on Friday 19 August 1910, while drawing water from the creek, leaving a child only one year old. Martha Scheibe was the first death in the settlement. The second recorded death was that of Max Kossendey on Monday 13 July 1914 shortly between 11am and noon at 28 or 29 years of age. His spring cart overturned and killed him instantaneously while he was transporting pumpkins to the Jardine (later Milman) Railway Station, through a steep gully just west of the school, on what is now Milman Rd. He left a widow (Elizabeth) and two children, one eight years of age and the other ten months old. His body was buried on their farm (Portion 36), on the bank of a small creek that became known as Kunze's Gully. Elizabeth Kossendey remained on the property and married Mr. Kunze.\nThe original settlers who set out from Germany specifically recruited for Jardine and travelled on the S.S. Omrah and the S.S. Oswestry Grange were: from the S. S. Omrah – Herman August Ebelt (Portion 71), Gustaf W. Ebelt (son)(40), Gustav Karl Priebst (55), Friedrich Herrmann Richard Lamain (54), Max Scheibe (51), Max Kossendey (36), Willy Bernhard Ernst Kossendey (39)(brothers), Ernst Lewandowsky (senior), Friedrich Ernst Lewandowsky (son)(settled together on Portion 35), Paul Lewandowsky(son)(37), C. Max Menzel (33) and Anton Nawrath (27); and from the S. S. Oswestry Grange; Otto Reinhold Paul Hanschen (72), Karl Friedrich Loose (45), George Lennig (42), Fredrich Wilhelm Curt  Henke (38), Otto Haase (28) and Heinrich Gottlieb Albert Detjen (44).\nFrom the S.S. Omrah, 14 men obtained licences of which four were single (three having departed London as teenagers) from a total male count, including the three teenagers) of 30 (Bernhard Kossendey arrived single but had a partner by the time of the land ballot).\nOf the 19 men on the Oswestry Grange, six obtained land licences of which only one (Otto Hanschen) was single.\nFor the combined two ships, of a total of 49 (men) over the age of 16 years at licence application time, 20 (\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
