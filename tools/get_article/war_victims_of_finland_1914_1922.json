The database was opened in 2002 and it is published by the National Archives of Finland.\nThe registry contains victims of World War I (1914–1918), the Finnish Civil War (1918) and the so-called Kinship Wars (1918–1922). About 97 per cent of the names are casualties of the civil war or its aftermath. Persons in the registry can be searched by surname, first name, date of birth, occupation, place of census registration, place of residence, place of death, and by the cause of death. The research version of the database has more information than the simplified internet version.\nExternal links\n*[http://vesta.narc.fi/cgi-bin/db2www/sotasurmaetusivu/main?lang=en War Victims of Finland 1914–1922 Internet Database]  (Finnish, Swedish, English)"
