The Russian award takes its name from Nike, the goddess of victory. Accordingly, the prize is modelled after the sculpture of the Winged Victory of Samothrace.\nThe oldest professional film award in Russia, the Nika Award was established during the final years of USSR by the influential Russian Union of Filmmakers.[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/16860.html Рейтинг телепрессы — Общество — Новая Газета]\nAt first the awards were judged by all the members of the Union of Filmmakers. In the early 1990s, a special academy, consisting of over 500 academicians, was elected for distributing the awards, which recognise outstanding achievements in cinema (not television) produced in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nIn 2002 Nikita Mikhalkov established the competing Golden Eagle Award, modelled on the Golden Globe Awards as it honours both film and television production of Russia.\nDescription\nThe award name is sometimes styled NIKA Awards.\nThe Nika Awards ceremony is broadcast annually and attracts huge publicity across Russia  and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nAward categories\nCurrent categories\n# Nika Award for Best Picture: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Nonfiction Film: since 1996\n#  Nika Award for Best Animation Film: since 1988\n#  Nika Award for Best Film of the CIS and Baltic States: since 2003\n# Nika Award for Best Director: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Screenplay: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Cinematography: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Film Editing\n# Nika Award for Best Music: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Production Design: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Costume Design: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Sound: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Actor: since 1988\n# Nika Awards for Best Actress: since 1988\n# Nika Award for Best Supporting Actor: since 2002\n# Nika Award for Best Supporting Actress: since 2002\n# Nika Award for the Lifetime Achievement Award: since 1988\n# Nika Award \"Honor and Dignity\": since 1988\n# Nika Award for Discovery of the Year: since 2002\n# Nika Award for Best Contribution to the Cinematic Science, Criticism and Education: since 2002\n# Special Nika Award for Contribution to the National Cinema Award: since 2007\n# Special Nika Award for Creative Achievements in the Art of Television Film: since 2005\nRetired awards\n# Nika Award for Best Supporting Performance (awarded 1988–2001)\n# Nika Award for Best Documentary (awarded 1988–1995)\n# Nika Award for Best Popular Science Film (awarded 1988–1995)\n# Nika Award for Best Producer (awarded 1994–1995)\n# Nika Award for Best Cinematography in Documentary (awarded 1989)\n# Special Nika Award \"For Humanism\" (awarded once at 2012)\nFilms with multiple wins\n;7 wins\n* Taurus (2002)\n* The Horde (2013)\n* Hard to Be a God (2015)\n* The Master and Margarita (2025)\n;6 wins\n* Repentance (1988)\n*Promised Heaven (1992)\n* Prisoner of the Mountains (1997)\n* Khrustalyov, My Car!
