They were built by Walkers Limited in Maryborough under licence from GE Transportation.\nThey were originally known as the 1500 class and renumbered as the 1270 class (not to be confused with the later 1270 class) before finally being renumbered as the 1170 class.\nThe class were popularly known as 'Paw Paws' after a racehorse, which in turn was named after a character in a contemporary cartoon strip.\nThey spent most of their working lives based at Townsville but in later years were used around Brisbane and the southern region of the state as shunters. The first unit was withdrawn in 1984 with the final two withdrawn in 1989.\nFive units have been preserved, including class leader 1170 retained by the Queensland Rail Heritage Division at North Ipswich.\nStatus table\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! 1500classnumber !! 1270classnumber !! 1170classnumber !!
