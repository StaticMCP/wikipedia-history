It is part of Mesa County Valley School District 51.\nHistory\nThe first purpose-built high school building in Fruita was completed in 1905 under the name Fruita Union High School. After that structure burned down in 1934, classes were held in a local armory. A new building was finished in 1936 and lasted until 1969, when a third location was built under the name Fruita Monument High School.\nA 2017 referendum resulted in a $12 million construction project to improve the safety of the school.\nAthletics\nWildcat athletic teams are classified as 5A by the Colorado High School Activities Association.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+State Championships\n!Sport\n!Year(s)\n|-\n|Baseball\n|1970, 1993\n|-\n|Basketball (boys)\n|1983, 1982\n|-\n|Basketball (girls)\n|1982, 1983, 1989\n|-\n|Golf\n|1983\n|-\n|Softball\n|1989\n|-\n|Spirit\n|2000\n|-\n|Wrestling\n|1964, 1982, 1983\n|-\n|Volleyball\n|1983\n|}\nNotable people\n;Alumni\n*Jim Brenneman, baseball player\n*James Niehues, artist and cartographer\n*Maggie Baird, actress\n;Faculty\n*James Van Pelt, author (taught English)\nSee also\n* List of high schools in Colorado\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.d51schools.org/ Mesa County Valley School District official website]"
