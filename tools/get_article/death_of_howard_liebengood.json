He was the first of what were reported as two police suicides in the immediate aftermath of the attack, though Metropolitan Police (MPD) officer Jeffrey L. Smith's widow disputes the manner of death. In the months after the civil disturbance at the Capitol, it was generally reported that the deaths of five people who were present have, to varying degrees, been related to the event. Some members of Congress and press reports included these two in the number of fatalities, for a total of seven.\nLiebengood had been a Capitol Police Officer for 15 years when he told his family about his decision to retire from the force after the Inauguration of Joe Biden. The long shifts were exhausting, and the Capitol attack left him drained. His family was supportive of his decision.\nPrior to his death by suicide, Liebengood, aged 51, had worked \"practically around the clock\" for three days, according to his wife, and was \"severely sleep deprived\". Liebengood's father Howard Scholer Liebengood was well known to many US senators due to his service as the Senate's sergeant at arms. The elder Liebengood was in business in the 1980s with Paul Manafort and Roger Stoneeven founding the event company that put on the Ellipse rally on January 6.\nOn August 5, 2021, Howard Liebengood, along with Capitol Police officers Brian Sicknick, Metropolitan Police officer Jeffrey L. Smith, as well as an officer who died as a result of a separate 2021 incident, Billy Evans, was posthumously honored in a signing ceremony for a bill to award Congressional Gold Medals to Capitol Police and other January 6 responders. His name is noted in the text of the bill, and President Joe Biden remarked on his death. On May 14, 2021, the US Capitol Police named their new counseling center after Liebengood.\nIn November of 2022, the United States Department of Justice classified Liebengood's suicide as a line-of-duty death, enabling his family to receive benefits through the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. This was the first designation for an officer who died in connection with the Capitol riot since Congress expanded eligibility to include those suffering from the traumatic effects of what they experienced on duty.\nOn January 6, 2023, \"for his deep dedication and selfless service,\" Liebengood was posthumously awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by Biden.\nSee also\n*Police officer safety and health\nReferences"
