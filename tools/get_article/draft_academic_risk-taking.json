The  risk stems from the possibility of making an incorrect or sub optimal contribution rather than providing a correct answer and appearing less competent in comparison to others. Examples include contributing novel ideas to class discussions, submitting creative work for feedback, or expressing dissenting viewpoints in academic debates.\nCorrelates\nStudies in educational research have identified various variables that\ninfluence academic risk-taking:\n#Individual characteristics: Student's beliefs about errors, goal orientations, and a preference for effortful thinking can affect their willingness to take academic risks. Learners with mastery-oriented goals or a positive view of mistakes are more likely to engage in challenging tasks, while those with performance-avoidant orientations tend to avoid them.\n#Didactic design: Teaching methods emphasizing, memorization  and rote reproduction of content, are generally associated with lower levels of academic risk-taking.\nAcademic outcomes\nAcademic risk-taking involves engaging with complex and challenging learning material. Based on the concept of desirable difficulties , challenging learning tasks promote long-term learning success. Recognizing and correcting errors  supports deeper knowledge integration, self-regulation, and improves learning outcomes. Empirical findings have shown positive associations between academic risk-taking and academic achievement among both secondary school students  and university students.\nReferences"
