They were inaugurated in 2000 for books published in 1999 and 2000. The awards were managed by reading charity, BookTrust, from 2006 until the final award in 2022. From 2013 until the final award, there were two award categories: Best Story and Best Book with Facts.\nThe awards were discontinued in 2022, one month after the end of the Costa Book Awards, which included a category for children's book, leaving only three widely recognized awards for children's literature (the Kate Greenaway Medal, the Carnegie Medal, and the Waterstones Children's Book Prize).\nCategories\nThe Book of the Year dated from 2000 when there were also some \"Voters' Awards\" (2000 to 2002). Previously there were award categories for:\n* Most Fun Story with Pictures, from 2007\n* Best Illustrated Book to Read Aloud, 2004 to 2006\n* Best Book with Facts, from 2003\n* Best New Information Book, 2002\n* Favourite Story, 2011\n* Book I Couldn't Put Down, 2000 to 2010\nThree books in each category were announced 4 December 2014 and considered by the panel of 200 children from 10 schools. The two winners for the 2015 awards were announced on 5 March 2015, or World Book Day (UK and Ireland).\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Blue Peter Book Award winners\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Author\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"7\" |2000\n!Book of the Year\n|, illus. by Jason Cockcroft\n|, retelling of The Pilgrim's Progress\n|\n|-\n!Best Book to Read Aloud\n|, illus. by Axel Scheffler\n|\n|\n|-\n!Book I Couldn't Put Down\n|\n|Shadow of the Minotaur\n|\n|-\n!Special Book to Keep Forever\n|, illus. by Jason Cockcroft\n|\n|\n|-\n!Voters' Awards: Best Book With Facts in It\n|\n|Guinness Book of World Records\n|\n|-\n!Voters' Awards: Best Book to Share\n|\n|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n|\n|-\n!Voters' Awards: Book that Made Me Laugh the Loudest\n|, illus. by Quentin Blake\n|Matilda\n|\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2001\n!Book of the Year\n|\n|'\n|\n|-\n!Best Book to Keep Forever\n|\n|'\n|\n|-\n!Best Book to Read Aloud\n| and Paul Howard\n|\n|\n|-\n!Book I Couldn't Put Down\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Voters' Awards: Best Book of Knowledge\n|\n|Rotten Romans\n|\n|-\n!Voters' Awards: Best Storybook\n|\n|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\n|\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2002\n!Book of the Year\n|\n|Feather Boy\n|\n|-\n!Best Book to Read Aloud\n|\n|Crispin, the Pig Who Had It All\n|\n|-\n!Best New Information Book\n|\n|Ada Lovelace: The Computer Wizard of Victorian England''\n|\n|-\n!Book I Couldn't Put Down\n|\n|Feather Boy\n|\n|-\n!Voter's Awards:  Best Book With Facts In\n|, illus. by Martin Brown\n|Terrible Tudors\n|\n|-\n!Voter's Awards: Best Storybook\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" |2003\n!Book of the Year\n|\n|Mortal Engines\n|\n|-\n!Best Book to Read Aloud\n|, illus. by Axel Scheffler\n|Room on the Broom\n|\n|-\n!Best Book with Facts\n|, illus. by Chris Riddell\n|Pirate Diary\n|\n|-\n!Book I Couldn't Put Down\n|\n|Mortal Engines\n|\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" |2004\n!Book of the Year\n|\n|Man on the Moon\n|\n|-\n!Best Book with Facts\n|, Leonie Flynn, and Susan Reuben (eds.)\n|\n|\n|-\n!Best Illustrated Book to Read Aloud\n|\n|Man on the Moon\n|\n|-\n!Book I Couldn't Put Down\n|\n|Montmorency\n|\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" |2005\n!Book of the Year\n|\n|Private Peaceful\n|\n|-\n!Best Book with Facts\n|\n|Explorers Wanted!
