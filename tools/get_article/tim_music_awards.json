The awards are organized by Milan-based agency Friends & Partners, and held since 2007 as a replacement of the canceled Italian Music Awards (2001–2003).\nTheir previous name was dependent on the sponsorship of Italian phone company Wind. In 2014 they were officially known as just Music Awards while between 2019 and 2021 they have been sponsored by SEAT.\nFrom 2022 it is sponsored by TIM.\nHistory\nFrom 2007 to 2009, the awards were held in Rome, first in the Auditorium Conciliazione and then in the Valle Giulia. Since 2009, the event has been held in the Arena di Verona, previously home to the Festivalbar, for which the Wind Music Awards has been seen as a replacement. The first five years of the awards were broadcast on television network Italia 1; they have been broadcast on Rai 1 since 2012. The event has also been broadcast on radio station RTL 102.5.\nThe awards have been criticized in the past by Italian indie label Produttori Musicali Indipendenti for excluding independent artists.\nAwards\nBased on:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ align=\"right\" |\n!\n!
