The result was a victory for incumbent President Ange-Félix Patassé of the Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, who received 51% of the vote in the first round, meaning that a second round was not required. Voter turnout was 59%.\nPrior to Constitutional Court head Édouard Frank announcing the results, all nine opposition candidates rejected the outcome, claiming the elections were rigged. However, international observers stated that any malpractice was not enough to have changed the results.\nThe elections were delayed by three weeks.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
