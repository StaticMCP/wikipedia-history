This list includes officers of the Royal Marines who were at the time seconded to the British Army, and foreign officers serving in the British Army who received honorary awards.\nIntroduction\nInitially during the Napoleonic Wars, awards were rare for those who had distinguished themselves in service, leaving many without tangible symbols of their success. These awards were overwhelmingly presented to senior officers rather than to other ranks and subalterns, for whom the prevailing opinion was that doing their duty was a reward of itself. Decorations for other ranks were only introduced in 1854 with the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\nThe lack of official awards caused great resentment among the British, as in comparison the French liberally awarded the Legion of Honour. Some regiments created their own awards to fill this gap, such as embroidered colours for personal deeds and badges for the survivors of forlorn hopes. In 1815 the Order of the Bath was reorganised to combat this lack of appropriate rewards, adding several new classes to it and allowing more officers, including those of field rank, to receive rewards for their services. Over 500 soldiers would go on to receive awards as part of this expanded system. The highest honour, a peerage, was awarded sixteen times to twelve individuals, of which Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, received four increasing from a viscountcy to a dukedom.\nNot covered in this list are campaign medals awarded during the Napoleonic Wars, which often did include the lower ranks in awards. These included the Waterloo Medal and later the Military General Service Medal, as well as officer-specific medals such as the Army Gold Cross and Army Gold Medal. Also not covered is the Royal Guelphic Order which, while presented to British Army officers by the Prince Regent, was a Hanoverian order rather than a British one.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#F2CEE0\"|\n| Posthumous award\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#CEE6F2\"|\n| Royal Marines officer\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#CEF2CE\"|\n| Honorary award\n|}\nPeerages\nA peerage was traditionally the most prestigious award an officer might receive, providing them with a hereditary title of nobility. British Army officers received peerages for both outstanding military and political services in this period; those who already held a peerage would be elevated in it. The most peerages were awarded in 1814 to general officers who had served in the Peninsular War as commanders of independent units or formations larger than a division.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"width=100%\n|-\n!style=|Rank\n!style=|Name\n!style=|Peerage\n!style=|Date\n!style=|Ref.\n|-\n|\n|Gerard Lake, 1st Baron Lake\n|\n|31 October 1807\n|rowspan=100|\n|-\n|\n|William Cathcart, 10th Baron Cathcart\n|\n|3 November 1807\n|-\n|\n|Sir Arthur Wellesley\n|\n|4 September 1809\n|-\n|\n|Arthur Wellesley, 1st Viscount Wellington\n|\n|28 February 1812\n|-\n|\n|Arthur Wellesley, 1st Earl of Wellington\n|\n|18 August 1812\n|-\n|\n|Henry Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave\n|\n|7 September 1812\n|-\n|\n|Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington\n|\n|3 May 1814\n|-\n|\n|Sir John Hope\n|\n|3 May 1814\n|-\n|\n|Sir Thomas Graham\n|\n|3 May 1814\n|-\n|\n|Sir Stapleton Cotton\n|\n|3 May 1814\n|-\n|\n|Sir Rowland Hill\n|\n|3 May 1814\n|-\n|\n|Sir William Beresford\n|\n|3 May 1814\n|-\n|\n|Sir Charles Stewart\n|\n|1 July 1814\n|-\n|\n|William Cathcart, 1st Viscount Cathcart\n|\n|16 July 1814\n|-\n|\n|Henry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge\n|\n|23 June 1815\n|-\n|\n|George Harris\n|\n|11 August 1815\n|}\nBaronetcies\nA baronetcy is a hereditary knighthood; it is not a title of nobility and as such officers awarded baronetcies remained commoners. In precedence these titles ranked immediately below baronies, the lowest rank of the peerage. Many more officers who had served in the Napoleonic Wars were created baronets later in their careers, years after the wars had ended.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"width=100%\n|-\n!style=|Rank\n!style=|Name\n!style=|Date\n!style=|Reason\n!style=|Ref.\n|-\n|\n|John Doyle\n|29 October 1805\n|For services\n|rowspan=100|\n|-\n|\n|Sir Charles Green\n|5 December 1805\n|For services and capture of Suriname\n|-\n|\n|George Prevost\n|6 December 1805\n|Defence of Dominica\n|-\n|\n|Charles Hastings\n|25 February 1806\n|\n|-\n|\n|George Nugent\n|11 November 1806\n|For services\n|-\n|\n|Harry Burrard\n|3 November 1807\n|For services Copenhagen Expedition\n|-\n|\n|Thomas Blomefield\n|14 November 1807\n|For services Copenhagen Expedition and Royal Artillery\n|-\n|\n|George Pigott\n|3 October 1808\n|\n|-\n|\n|Sir David Baird\n|13 April 1809\n|For services India, Egypt, Cape Colony, Peninsula\n|-\n|\n|William Payne\n|8 December 1812\n|Commander of Cavalry in Peninsula\n|-\n|\n|Sir Richard Fletcher\n|14 December 1812\n|Commander of Royal Engineers in Peninsula\n|-\n|\n|Roger Sheaffe\n|16 January 1813\n|Commander Upper Canada\n|-\n|\n|Hildebrand Oakes\n|2 November 1813\n|For services\n|-\n|\n|Thomas Hislop\n|2 November 1813\n|For services\n|-\n|\n|George Hewett\n|6 November 1813\n|For services and Commander-in-Chief, India\n|-\n|\n|Sir John Hamilton\n|21 December 1814\n|Division commander in Peninsula\n|-\n|\n|Howard Elphinstone\n|3 April 1815\n|Commander of Royal Engineers in Peninsula\n|-\n|\n|Sir Hew Dalrymple\n|6 May 1815\n|For services in Peninsula and Gibraltar\n|-\n|\n|Sir Alexander Campbell\n|6 May 1815\n|Division commander in Peninsula\n|}\nOrder of the Bath\nThe Order of the Bath was an order of chivalry available to British Army officers. Prior to 1815 the order only had one grade, Knight of the Bath, which was presented in the post-nominals KB, and was awarded not for meritorious achievement but for men of high social and economic status. This antiquated order was expanded into  military and civil divisions with three classes, so that more people could be included in the order and rewarded for their services. Those officers who already held a KB received the highest class of the new order, becoming a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. This class and the next, Knight Commander, styled the awardee as a knight, while the lowest class, Knight Companion, did not.\nAwards for the new Order of the Bath took into account both distinguished service and bravery, and were less constrained to ranks as previous awards had been. The first class was limited to those officers of major-general or above, with soldiers as low as lieutenant-colonel being made Knights Commander. Colonels were more likely to be made Knights Companion, which award became the standard for service in the field. Membership of the first two classes of the order was limited, with seventy-two men being allowed the first, and 180 the second. Ten extra spaces were added to the second class for the addition of foreign officers who nonetheless held British commissions, notably those of the King's German Legion.\nAwards of the Order of the Bath had not been finalised when the Hundred Days campaign was fought, and so officers who had distinguished themselves at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo were also included when the lists were eventually released. Those officers rewarded for their services in earlier campaigns, such as the Peninsular War, had their awards dated 2 January, while those for the latter campaign were dated 22 June.\nKnight Grand

Seventy-three of these were colonels, with 215 lieutenant-colonels receiving awards alongside 32 majors. Three of the majors were Royal Marines.\nKnights bachelor\nKnight bachelor was the lowest rank of knighthood available, not being hereditary or part of any order. Most commonly, British Army officers who were made knights bachelor had already received foreign knighthoods for their services, such as the Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword, which by itself would not allow awardees to style themselves as knights. Officers were also made knights bachelor if they stood as proxy in the installation ceremony for another officer's knighthood, most commonly for the Order of the Bath.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"width=100%\n|-\n!style=|Rank\n!style=|Name\n!style=|Date\n!style=|Reason\n!style=|Ref.\n|-\n|\n|George Smith\n|9 December 1807\n|Aide de camp to George III\n|rowspan=15|\n|-\n|\n|Charles Imhoff\n|1807\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Charles Shipley\n|11 March 1808\n|Royal Engineers\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=\"#CEE6F2\"|Mark Gerard\n|30 March 1809\n|Royal Marines\n|-\n|\n|William Wynn\n|2 March 1810\n|Governor of Sandown Fort\n|-\n|\n|Richard Fletcher\n|18 April 1812\n|Royal Engineers\n|-\n|\n|George Adam Wood\n|22 May 1812\n|Proxy for Sir John Sherbrooke\n|-\n|\n|John Tylden\n|22 May 1812\n|Proxy for Sir Samuel Auchmuty\n|-\n|\n|Charles Gordon\n|29 May 1812\n|Proxy for Sir John Hope\n|-\n|\n|Thomas Sydney Beckwith\n|29 May 1812\n|Proxy for Sir George Beckwith\n|-\n|\n|Robert Chambre Hill\n|29 May 1812\n|Proxy for Sir Rowland Hill\n|-\n|\n|Alexander Campbell\n|29 May 1812\n|Proxy for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Earl of Wellington\n|-\n|\n|John Hamilton\n|15 July 1813\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|George Elder\n|11 November 1813\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|John Wilson\n|16 April 1814\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|John Browne\n|16 April 1814\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|rowspan=26|\n|-\n|\n|Hudson Lowe\n|26 April 1814\n|Royal Corsican Rangers\n|-\n|\n|Archibald Campbell\n|7 May 1814\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|Albert Gledstanes\n|May 1814\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Freeman Barton\n|25 June 1814\n|2nd Regiment of Foot\n|-\n|\n|Charles Sutton\n|13 July 1814\n|Portuguese Army service\n|-\n|\n|Tomkyns Hilgrove Turner\n|28 July 1814\n|Lieutenant Governor of Jersey\n|-\n|\n|Gregory Way\n|28 July 1814\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|Thomas Noel Hill\n|28 July 1814\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|John Milley Doyle\n|28 July 1814\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|Neil Campbell\n|7 October 1814\n|54th Regiment of Foot\n|-\n|\n|Charles Felix Smith\n|10 November 1814\n|Award of Spanish Order of Charles III\n|-\n|\n|Edward Kerrison\n|5 January 1815\n|7th Light Dragoons\n|-\n|\n|Loftus William Otway\n|15 January 1815\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Henry Pynn\n|23 February 1815\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|John Campbell\n|9 March 1815\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|Sir Charles Greville\n|20 April 1815\n|38th Regiment of Foot\n|-\n|\n|Victor von Arentsschildt\n|20 April 1815\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|-\n|\n|Samuel Ford Whittingham\n|3 May 1815\n|Aide de camp to the Prince Regent\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=\"#CEE6F2\"|Sir Richard Williams\n|25 May 1815\n|Royal Marines\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=\"#CEE6F2\"|Sir James Malcolm\n|25 May 1815\n|Royal Marines\n|-\n|\n|Sir James Archibald Hope\n|25 May 1815\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Sir Hew Dalrymple Ross\n|25 May 1815\n|Royal Artillery\n|-\n|\n|William Osborne Hamilton\n|25 May 1815\n|Meritorious Service on Heligoland\n|-\n|\n|Matthew Whitworth-Aylmer, 5th Baron Aylmer\n|6 June 1815\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Sir Charles Pratt\n|29 June 1815\n|5th Regiment of Foot\n|-\n|\n|Warren Peacocke\n|27 July 1815\n|Award of Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword\n|rowspan=9|\n|-\n|\n|Thomas Reade\n|27 November 1815\n|Deputy Adjutant General Saint Helena\n|-\n|\n|Hugh Gough\n|4 December 1815\n|Meritorious Service\n|-\n|\n|Sir William Williams\n|4 December 1815\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Sir Robert Arbuthnot\n|4 December 1815\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Benjamin Bloomfield\n|11 December 1815\n|Chief Equerry to the Prince Regent\n|-\n|\n|Charles William Doyle\n|1815\n|Unknown\n|-\n|\n|Sir Robert Trench\n|22 December 1815\n|74th Regiment of Foot\n|-\n|\n|Sir Joseph Carncross\n|22 December 1815\n|Royal Artillery\n|}\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
