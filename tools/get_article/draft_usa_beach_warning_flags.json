There are many flags and they may differ by state.\nAlways exercise caution because even green flags can still be dangerous.\nFlags\nGreen Flags (Low Hazard)\nGreen flags denote there are minimal rip currents and waves aren't dangerous. The USLA decided not to use the green flag, but some states and areas (eg. Fort Macon, North Carolina) still use it.\nYellow Flags (Medium Hazard)\nYellow flags imply there are may be more rip currents, waves are bigger, and more dangerous. This could be the minimum flag type even if the water is very calm.\nRed over Yellow\n(Two flags where the top flag is red and the bottom flag is yellow). Red over Yellow (Red/Yellow) flags denote there are the same conditions as green on yellow flags, but has lifeguard supervision. This flag isn't used much, and you might never see it.\nRed Flags (High Hazard)\nRed flags indicate there are more-than-normal rip currents and waves are more dangerous. Lifeguards watch the area, and swimming is not recommended. Oceanic Currents may be faster and push you further.\nPurple Flags\nPurple flags denote there are more-than-normal dangerous marine life. Sharks, jellyfish, and other oceanic animals are more proactive.\nDouble Red\n(Two flags where both are red). Double red flags mean the water is too dangerous to swim and is prohibited. These usually occur during or after storms. You may be either fined or arrested.\nBlack and White Flag\n(Black in top left and bottom right, white in top left and bottom right). Black and White flags signify this is a watercraft area (eg. surfboards).\nYellow Flag with Black\n(Yellow flag with a black circle inside it). This flag indicates watercraft are prohibited and is a swim only zone.\nOrange Windsock\nThis is not a flag, but states that inflatables are recommended against because of wind.\nRed and White Flag\n(Red in top left and bottom right, white in top right and bottom left). This insinuates swimmers and surfers need to be evacuated immediately. This may be because a shark was sighted or a storm is coming.\nReferences"
