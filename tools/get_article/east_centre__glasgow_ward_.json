On its creation in 2007 and in 2012 it returned four council members, using the single transferable vote system. For the 2017 Glasgow City Council election, the boundaries were changed, but four members were still returned.\nBoundaries\nLocated in the east of Glasgow, the core of the ward since 2007 includes Carntyne, Cranhill and Riddrie, with the northern boundary being the M8 motorway). The 2017 changes were substantial: the Dennistoun, Milnbank and Haghill neighbourhoods in the west of the original territory were removed and assigned to a new Dennistoun ward, whereas the neighbourhoods of Barlanark, Budhill, Greenfield, Lightburn and Springboig were added to East Centre from the Baillieston ward. The southern boundary is the North Clyde Line railway.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Patricia Chalmers(Labour)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=5|Frank Docherty(Labour)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Elaine McDougall(Labour)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Jennifer Dunn(SNP)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=4|Russell Robertson(Labour/SNP/Independent)\n|-\n!2016\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Marie Garrity(Labour)\n|rowspan=3|Annette Christie(SNP)\n|-\n!2019\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Declan Blench(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Ann Jenkins(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Kieran Turner(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Election\n2022 Glasgow City Council election\n2017 Election\n2017 Glasgow City Council election\n2012 Election\n2012 Glasgow City Council election\n2007 Election\n2007 Glasgow City Council election\nSee also\n*Wards of Glasgow\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/east-centre-ward-glasgow-city#.Xm_aFrenzN4 Listed Buildings in East Centre Ward, Glasgow City] at British Listed Buildings"
