He chaired the House Ways and Means Committee during both sessions. Branch was appointed a District Judge in 1838, which also made him an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court. He served as judge until 12 August 1840.\nIn 1843, he served as postmaster of Liberty, and in 1846, as representative of Liberty in the Texas House of Representatives of the First Texas Legislature. During that session, Branch was elected Speaker of the House pro tempore and served as Speaker from his election on 9 March 1846 until Speaker William Crump returned from a leave of absence on 16 March 1846.\nIn private life, Branch split his time between farming and his law practice.
