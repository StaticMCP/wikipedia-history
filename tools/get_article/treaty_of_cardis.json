This particular agreement ended the Russo-Swedish War of 1656–1658. It took place in Cardis Manor (now Kärde) in Estonia. Based on the terms of the treaty, Russia surrendered to Sweden all captured territories. Moreover, all vessels constructed at Kokenhausen (Latvian: Koknese, Russian: Tsarevich-Dmitriev) for the failed Russian siege of Riga were destroyed (the vessels were constructed in a shipyard founded by a boyar named Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin). Overall, the Peace of Cardis maintained the territorial accords of the Treaty of Stolbovo.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.neva.ru/EXPO96/book/chap1-3.html Under the Romanovs]"
