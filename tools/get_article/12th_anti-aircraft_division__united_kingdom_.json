It defended Western Scotland and Northern Ireland, including the period of the Clydebank Blitz and Belfast Blitz, but only had a short career.\nMobilisation\nThe 12th Anti-Aircraft Division was one of five new divisions created on 1 November 1940 by Anti-Aircraft Command to control the expanding anti-aircraft (AA) defences of the United Kingdom. The  division was formed by separating responsibility for Western Scotland (particularly the industrial areas of Clydeside and Ayrshire) and Northern Ireland from the existing 3rd AA Division, which continued to be responsible for the rest of mainland Scotland.\nThe divisional headquarters (HQ) was at Glasgow and the General Officer Commanding (GOC), appointed on 15 November 1940, was Major-General Gerald Rickards, promoted from command of 44th AA Brigade. The 12th AA Division formed part of III AA Corps.\nThe Blitz\nThe division's fighting units, organised into three AA Brigades, consisted of Heavy (HAA) and Light (LAA) gun regiments and Searchlight (S/L) regiments of the Royal Artillery (RA). The HAA guns were concentrated in the Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) at Belfast and Glasgow, LAA units were distributed to defend Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as factories and airfields, while the S/L detachments were disposed in clusters of three, spaced 10,400 yards apart.\nThe approved scale of HAA guns for the Clyde had been 80 in 1939, and this was raised to 120 in 1940 and again to 144 in March 1941, but by the end of February 1941, the 12th AA Division still only had 67 guns in place, rising to 88 (11 batteries) in late March.\nGlasgow and Clydeside received heavy raids on the nights of 13 and 14 March 1941 (the Clydebank Blitz), and again on 7 April, while Belfast was hit on 15 April and 4 May. The Luftwaffe returned to Clydeside on 5 and 6 May, before The Blitz petered out in mid-May.\nOrder of Battle 1940–41\nThe division's composition during the Blitz was as follows:\n* 3rd AA Brigade – Northern Ireland District\n** 102nd HAA Regiment\n** 66th LAA Rgt – new unit raised December 1940 from LAA batteries of 102nd HAA Rgt\n** 90th S/L Rgt – new unit raised March 1941\n** 91st S/L Rgt – new unit raised March 1941\n* 42nd AA Brigade – Clyde Estuary\n** 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt\n** 100th HAA Rgt\n** 111th HAA Rgt – new unit raised October 1940\n** 123rd HAA Rgt – new unit raised February 1941\n** 18th LAA Rgt\n** 60th LAA Rgt – new unit raised November 1940; to the 63rd AA Brigade by May 1941\n* 63rd AA Brigade – West Scotland\n** 60th LAA Rgt – from 42 AA Bde by May 1941\n** 56th (Cameronians) S/L Rgt – to 3rd AA Division by February 1941\n** 57th (Cameronians) S/L Rgt\n** 66th S/L Rgt– to the 8th AA Division by May 1941\n** 86th S/L Rgt – new unit raised January 1941\n** 11th AA 'Z' Regiment – divisional Z Battery rocket unit formed January 1941\n* 12th AA Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) – expanded from a Glasgow company of 3rd AA Divisional Signals\n* 12th Divisional Royal Army Service Corps (RASC)\n** 195th Company (Northern Ireland District)\n** 909th Company\n* 12th AA Divisional Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC)\n* 12th AA Divisional Workshop Company, Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC)\nMid-War\nNewly formed AA units joined the division, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them. At the same time, experienced units were posted away to train for service overseas; in some cases they joined the 12th AA Division temporarily while they trained in Scotland; others remained with AA Command as unbrigaded units. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) and the need to transfer AA units  to counter the Baedeker raids.\nAt the end of 1941 S/Ls were declustered to form 'killer zones' for night fighters, and the S/L requirement for Northern Ireland was reduced to three batteries. As a result, 91st S/L Rgt could be converted into an LAA Rgt for the field army.\nIn May 1942, the 57th AA Brigade HQ was transferred to the 12th AA Division from the 7th AA Division; some units from the 42nd AA Brigade were transferred to it, together with newly formed units. In August, to deal with the Luftwaffes hit-and-run attacks, the 3rd AA Division's HQ was moved from Scotland to the South Coast of England and the 12th AA Division took over command of 51st AA Brigade and its units.\nOrder of Battle 1941–42\nDuring this period the division was composed as follows (temporary attachments omitted):\n* 3rd AA Brigade\n** 1 HAA Rgt from 4th AA Division July 1941\n** 102nd HAA Rgt – to 6th AA Division by October 1942\n** 111th HAA Rgt – from 42 AA Bde June 1941\n** 66th LAA Rgt – to 6th AA Division June 1942\n**81st LAA Rgt – from 42 AA Bde by October 1942\n** 84th LAA Rgt – from 63 AA Bde June 1942;

The 12th AA Division amalgamated with the 3rd and the 7th AA Divisions to form the 6th AA Group, based at Edinburgh and cooperating with No. 14 Group RAF, while Northern Ireland became the 7th AA Group based at Belfast and working with No. 9 Group RAF. Major-General Rickards retired. The 12th AA Divisional Signals was amalgamated back into its parent 3rd AA Divisional Signals as the 6th AA Group (Mixed) Signals.\nGeneral Officer Commanding\nThe following officer commanded 12th AA Division:\n* Major-General Gerald Rickards (15 November 1940 – 30 September 1942)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/index.html Basil Collier, History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom, London: HM Stationery Office, 1957.]\n* Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939–1941, Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, .\n* J.B.M.
