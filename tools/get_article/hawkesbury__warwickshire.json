It lies between Coventry and Bedworth. In 2021 it had a population of 2,290.\nVillage\nAlthough the area name of Hawkesbury is of Anglo-Saxon origin, the hamlet of Hawkesbury grew up around nearby Hawkesbury Junction, a canal junction where the Oxford Canal meets the Coventry Canal, which became operational in 1803. The area was historically part of the ancient parish of Foleshill. There is a Hawkesbury Hall nearby, which was once owned by the Parrott family, who owned coal mining interests in the area. Historically two collieries operated in the vicinity, both of which are long gone.\nThe village borders the northernmost edge of Coventry and is separated from the city by a thin stretch of countryside and the M6 motorway, adjacent to Junction 3. It is situated within the Poplar Ward of the Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council area, less than 2 miles south of Bedworth town centre, 5 miles south of Nuneaton and 5 miles northwest of central Coventry.\nUntil around 1999, it consisted of three streets with approximately 140 houses and a population of 250. Housing developments have now increased the number of houses to approximately 740 with an adult population of 1,147.\nThis specific area has previously been referred to as a number of different locations, including Exhall, Longford, Tackley, Little Bayton and Black Horse Road. Due to these anomalies, it was felt that the area should be given a specific identity.\nTowards the start of 2005, contact was made between Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council and Warwickshire County Council regarding signage for the area, which is defined as being between the Hawkesbury Lane railway crossing on Black Horse Road, where Hawkesbury Lane station used to be, and the humpback bridge over the Coventry Canal, alongside Hawkesbury Junction, where the Oxford Canal starts.\nFollowing consultation, Warwickshire County Council reached the decision that this area should be known as Hawkesbury Village. The area includes the Moorings Business Park.\nIn August 2005, the Hawkesbury Village Residents' Association was formed to act as a voice of the community and assist with local issues.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hawkesburyvillage.co.uk/ Hawkesbury Village Residents Association website]\n* [http://www.nuneatonandbedworth.gov.uk/ Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190102151519/https://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/home Warwickshire County Council Website]\n* [https://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=5142627 Photos of Hawkesbury and surrounding area on geograph.org.uk]"
