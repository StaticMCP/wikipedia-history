It nevertheless still appeared in books and articles in the 1970s, by now covering not merely agricultural output from (formerly) colonial countries but all long-life staple foods, regardless of provenance, as well as soap, washing powder and petrol/gasoline, and other newly important basic household supplies.\nColonial goods stores\nColonial goods stores were retailers specializing in colonial goods. The name is now used generically for grocery stores selling non-perishable items.\nNotes"
