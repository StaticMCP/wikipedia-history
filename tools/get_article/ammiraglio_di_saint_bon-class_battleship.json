The class comprised two ships: , the lead ship, and . They were armed with a main battery of four  guns and were capable of a top speed of . Smaller and less powerfully-armed than most contemporary battleships, they marked a brief departure from Italian capital ship design, which had previously emphasized large ships equipped with large guns.\nBoth ships served in the active duty squadron early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912. They took part in the Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes, but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet. They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and they spent the war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly after the end of the war, both having been stricken in 1920.\nDesign\nThe previous Italian capital ships, the  and the es of ironclad battleships, marked a period of experimentation on the part of Benedetto Brin, Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon, and the strategists of the Italian navy. Since the planners had not determined what type of battleship would best suit their strategic needs, the government stepped in and mandated a  design, a limit significantly lower than the earlier classes. Following the death of di Saint Bon, Brin took over the design process and proposed a small battleship armed with  guns, a weaker main battery than those of contemporary foreign designs.\nThe ships, much smaller than their contemporaries, and slower than cruisers, were not particularly useful warships. The mistake of building a battleship of only 10,000&nbsp;tons was not repeated in the subsequent, and much more successful, .\nGeneral characteristics and machinery\nThe ships of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were  long at the waterline and  long overall. They had a beam of  and a maximum draft of . Ammiraglio di Saint Bon displaced  at normal loading and  at full load, while Emanuele Filiberto displaced  and , respectively.\nThe ships had an inverted bow and a relatively low freeboard of only . They had a fairly large superstructure with a conning tower and high bridge forward and a large military mast fitted with fighting tops placed amidships. Abreast the mast, each ship carried a number of small boats. Ammiraglio di Saint Bon had a crew of 557&nbsp;officers and enlisted men, while Emanuele Filiberto had a slightly larger complement of 565.\nThe ships' propulsion system consisted of two triple-expansion steam engines, which drove a pair of screw propellers. Steam for the engines was provided by twelve coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which were ducted into a pair of widely spaced funnels. Ammiraglio di Saint Bons were rated at , while Emanuele Filibertos engines only reached . The ships' propulsion system provided a top speed of  and a range of approximately  at .\nArmament and armor\nThe ships were armed with a main battery of four  40-caliber guns manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth. The guns were placed in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The ships were also equipped with a secondary battery of eight  40-cal. guns in individual casemates amidships. These guns were export derivatives of the British QF 6-inch /40 gun. Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was also equipped with eight  40-cal. guns in shielded pivot mounts directly above the casemate battery, while Ammiraglio di Saint Bon carried six  guns. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of eight  guns and two  guns. Emanuele Filiberto had eight  guns instead. Both ships also carried four  torpedo tubes in deck-mounted launchers.\nThe ships were protected with Harvey steel. The main belt was  thick, and the deck was  thick. The conning tower was protected by 249&nbsp;mm of armor plating on the sides. The main battery guns also had 249&nbsp;mm thick plating on the turrets, and the casemates were  thick.\nShips of the class\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Construction data\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Builder\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Launched\n! scope=\"col\" | Completed\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Venetian Arsenal\n|18 July 1893\n|29 April 1897\n|24 May 1901\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|5 October 1893\n|29 September 1897\n|16 April 1902\n|-\n|}\nService\nin late 1918 after the end of World War I]]\nwas built by the Venetian Arsenal in Venice. She was laid down on 18 July 1893, launched on 29 April 1897, and completed on 24 May 1901, although she had been commissioned on 1 February 1901.  was named after Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta. She was built by the  (Royal Shipyard of Castellammare di Stabia), Naples. She was laid down on 5 October 1893, launched on 29 September 1897, and completed on 16 April 1902, although she had been commissioned on 6 September 1901. The ships spend the first several years in the active duty squadron until they were replaced by the new s, which entered service by 1908.\nBoth ships took part in the Italo-Turkish War in 1911–1912 in the 3rd Division with the two Regina Margherita-class battleships. Emanuele Filiberto took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, though Ammiraglio di Saint Bon did not see action in the first months of the war. Both ships participated in the seizure of the island of Rhodes, where Ammiraglio di Saint Bon provided gunfire support to the soldiers ashore.\nThe two ships were slated to be scrapped in 1914–1915 due to their age, but the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 prevented their disposal. Italy initially remained neutral during the war, but by 1915, had been convinced by the Triple Entente to enter the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Both Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and Emanuele Filiberto were used as harbor defense ships in Venice for the duration of the war, and did not see action there. Neither ship remained in service long after the end of the war. Emanuele Filiberto was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was stricken on 18 June. Both ships were subsequently discarded.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n|oclc=1408563\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.marina.difesa.it/noi-siamo-la-marina/mezzi/mezzi-storici/Pagine/ABCD/di_saint_bon.aspx Ammiraglio di Saint Bon (1897)] Marina Militare website"
