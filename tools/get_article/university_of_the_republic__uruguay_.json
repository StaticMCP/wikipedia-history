It is the country's oldest and largest university, as well as one of the largest public universities in South America in terms of enrollment. Established in 1849, it has educated the vast majority of Uruguay's professionals throughout history and has maintained a leading role in advancing academic research and higher education.\nThe University of the Republic enrolls more than 140,000 students and is organized into 16 independent faculties. It administers 7 university schools and scientific institutes, the Hospital Clinic Manuel Quintela, as well as three regional university centers that serve different parts of the country.\nHistory\nThe process of founding the country's first public university began on 11 June 1833, when a law proposed by then-Senator Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga was passed. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836 the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence.\nOn 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree through which created the Greater University of the Republic.  That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\nRanking\n| CWTS_W = | CWTS_W_year = | CWTS_W_ref =\n| THE_W =  | THE_W_year =  | THE_W_ref =\n| USNWR_W =951  | USNWR_W_year =2025  | USNWR_W_ref =\n| QS_W ==650  | QS_W_year =2026  | QS_W_ref =\n}}\nIn 2019, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance, it is the best university in Uruguay and it stands in the 801-900 bracket among the best universities in the world.
