      "text": "# BattleCards\n\nBattleCards was a fantasy-themed card game published in 1993 by Merlin Publishing. The game features a unique \"Scratch and Slay\" system created by Steve Jackson. The cards came in 10 card booster packs which included warrior cards, spell cards, advanced combat cards, quest cards, and treasure cards. The game was published in both the UK and the United States with a number of differences between the two releases.\nFirst collectible card game claim\nThe game debuted at Gen Con 1993 (exactly same time as Magic: The Gathering saw public release) and was marketed as a trading card game.  On rare occasions, it is debated whether the game counts as the world's first CCG along with Magic. However, the game is not played with a deck and there is no collectibility involved. The Scrye guide acknowledges the limited playability of the game as \"use them once and they're worthless\" which strictly disqualifies it as a collectible card game. Darwin Bromley of Mayfair Games noted that the scratch-offs would crack when shuffled, and once scratched off \"you had to either play the game or collect it.\" \"You couldn't have your cake and eat it too.\"\nThe \"Scratch and Slay\" game system\nEach warrior card has 25 scratch-off dots around its border. These are separated into 3 Life dots, 1 Purse dot, 4 Head dots, 6 Arm dots, 6 Leg dots, and 5 Body dots. Underneath each head, arm, leg, and body dot is either nothing or a red blood drop. Underneath each life dot is either nothing or a red skull. Underneath the purse dot is a number.\nTo play, each player selects one warrior card. Then, one player is randomly determined to go first, such as with a coin flip. Then, the first player scratches one of the head, arm, leg, or body dots off. If a red blood drop is revealed, that player scratches off again. Otherwise, the other player goes. Each time a red blood drop is revealed, that player scratches off again. After the second blood drop is revealed and after any further blood drops, that player scratches off a life dot. If a red skull is revealed, that player wins.\nPlayers could collect the Purse from a card after scratching off the purse dot on a card. The purse from several cards could be collected and sent in with the Trading Post card for special Silver Foiled Treasure cards. However, this offer expired in 1994.\nOfficial Rules (from back of booster pack)\nScratch & Slay Rules\n* Choose one BattleCard each. Decide who starts.\n* Scratch one of your opponent's spots.
