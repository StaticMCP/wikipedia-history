      "text": "# Timeline of same-sex marriage\n\nThis article contains a timeline of significant events regarding same-sex marriage and legal recognition of same-sex couples worldwide. It begins with the history of same-sex unions during ancient times, which consisted of unions ranging from informal and temporary relationships to highly ritualized unions, and continues to modern-day state-recognized same-sex marriage. Events concerning same-sex marriages becoming legal in a country or in a country's state are listed in bold.\nSummary\nThe summary table below lists in chronological order the sovereign states (United Nations member states plus Taiwan) that have legalized same-sex marriage. As of January 2025, 38 states have legalized same sex marriage.\nDates are when marriages between same-sex couples began to be officially certified. When distinguished, the initial date is the date of legalization in the first subnational jurisdiction (state, province or constituent country), and the second is the completion date for all jurisdictions, not counting external territories (or in the case of the US, sovereign tribal nations). A dash indicates that same-sex marriage is not (yet) legal in all jurisdictions. This is the case for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, where the constituent country Sint Maarten has not yet legalized, and for the Realm of New Zealand, where the constituent countries of Niue and the Cook Islands have not legalized.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable static-row-numbers\" style=\"font-size:90%; background:white; text-align:center\"\n|- style=line-height:1.2\n!

Cicero states thus that the younger Curio was \"united in a stable and permanent marriage\" to Antonius. Martial also mentions a number of same-sex marriages, but always in derisory terms against people whom he wants to mock.\nAt least two of the Roman Emperors were in same-sex unions; and in fact, thirteen out of the first fourteen Roman Emperors held to be bisexual or exclusively homosexual. The first Roman emperor to have married a man was Nero, who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions. First with one of his freedmen, Pythagoras, to whom Nero took the role of the bride, and later as a groom Nero married a young boy, who resembled one of his concubines, named Sporus.\nAdolescent emperor Elagabalus referred to his chariot driver, a blond slave from Caria named Hierocles, as his husband. He also married an athlete named Zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in Rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens. In the Far East, same-sex marriage was recorded as normal and accepted by society in many of the native cultures of the Asia-Pacific region, such as Philippines.\nThe Siwa Oasis in Egypt had a historical acceptance of male homosexuality and even rituals of same-sex marriage—traditions that Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century. The German egyptologist George Steindorff explored the oasis in 1900 and reported that homosexual relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage.\nPost-classical history\n* 1590: The Boxer Codex records same-sex marriage as a normal occurrence in the Philippines for the indigenous population.\n* 1781: Jens Andersson of Norway, assigned female at birth, but identifying as male, was imprisoned and put on trial after marrying Anne Kristine Mortensdotter in a Lutheran church. When asked about their gender, the response was \"\" (\"He believes he belongs to both\").\n* 1834: Anne Lister, dubbed \"the first modern lesbian\", married Ann Walker (landowner) at Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York.\n1900s\n]]\n1901\n* Two women named Marcela Gracia and Elisa Sánchez are able to get legally married in A Coruña, Spain. To achieve it, Elisa adopted a male identity under the name Mario Sánchez to marry Marcela and thus they were able to fool the authorities. The truth eventually broke out and their case appeared in many newspapers throughout Europe, so they had to escape to the Americas to avoid being arrested.\n1929\n* Following the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the Soviet Union, a conference on sexual and gender diversity organised by the People's Commissariat for Health adopts a resolution calling for same-sex marriage to be officially recognised with a requirement for approval from a psychiatrist. The resolution was not adopted into law and homosexuality was re-criminalised by the Soviet Union in 1933 under Joseph Stalin.\n1960s\n1963\n* Swedish lesbian activist Vivi Astroy and her partner Märta organize a symbolic wedding ceremony with around 50 guests in one of the banquet halls of the Källaren Drufvan restaurant, in Stockholm. A gay friend of theirs officiated the wedding.\n1970s\n1970\n(r), 1970]]\n* 18 May: Gay activists Jack Baker and Michael McConnell from the United States apply for a marriage license in Hennepin County, Minnesota, but are denied one by a clerk. Blue Earth County issues them a license in August 1971. Eventually, Assistant Chief Judge Gregory Anderson declares that marriage \"to be in all respects valid\", which made it the earliest legal same sex marriage \"recorded\" in the public files of any civil government.\n1971\n* 15 October: The Minnesota Supreme Court rules in Baker v. Nelson that the refusal by the clerk in Hennepin County to issue a marriage license to Jack Baker and Michael McConnell in 1970 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court accepts their appeal but dismisses the action in 1972. Neither decision invalidates the license issued in Blue Earth County.\n1973\n* 1 January: Maryland becomes the first state in the U.S. to statutorily ban same-sex marriage. In the following two decades, other states joined Maryland in statutorily banning same-sex marriage, reaching almost the totality of US states by 1994.\n1974\n* 20 May: Singer v. Hara, a lawsuit filed by John F.
