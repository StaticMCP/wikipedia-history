The Diodotids were the first independent Greek kings to rule in Bactria.\nThe origins of Diodotids are unknown. Antiochus Nicator, a proposed Greco-Bactrian King c. 230s BC, would have belonged to the Diodotid dynasty (his existence as a distinct Greco-Bactrian ruler is controversial and his coins may have represented Seleucid authority). Diodotus II Theos was the last Diodotid ruler of Bactria. His reign was marked for his controversial alliance with the Parthians against the Seleucid Empire. Diodotus II was deposed c. 235-225 BC by Euthydemus, founder of the Euthydemid dynasty, thus ending the dynasty's rule over the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.\nFamily Tree\nThis is a theoretical family tree of the Diodotid kings of Bactria, including the Seleucid king Antiochus II (for a more detailed family tree, see Family tree of the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kings).\nReferences"
