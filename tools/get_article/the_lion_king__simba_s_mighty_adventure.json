It was developed by Paradox Development for the PlayStation and by Torus Games for the Game Boy Color, and published by Activision. Unlike the previous The Lion King video game, it adhered more closely to the events in the film and the storyline carried on into the 1998 animated film ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, with Simba having to battle his evil uncle Scar, rescue his daughter Kiara (the protagonist from The Lion King II: Simba's Pride), and finally battle Zira.\nThis game was the only console-based platform game to involve The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''. All other games based on the title were educational or puzzle games and were released on the PC.\nGameplay\nThe game's gameplay varied between the two consoles.\nGame Boy Color\nThe game is mostly a side-scrolling platform game with occasional levels where the camera is top-down.  The gameplay is very similar to the first The Lion King video game, in which the player takes control of Simba and must leap and run between platforms while fighting enemies and avoiding pitfalls.  During levels Simba can collect pawprint-shaped tokens which add to the overall score.\nThe game supports the Game Link Cable accessory.\n| Allgame = 3/5 (PS1)\n| NP = 4.5/5 (GBC)\n| Gamekult = 5/10 (GBC)\n| IGN = 4.0/10 (PS1)\n| JXV = 16/20 (GBC)11/20 (PS1)\n| rev1 = Gamezilla\n| rev1Score = 62/100 (PS1)\n}}\nGame Boy Color\nNintendo Power gave a positive review, praising the level design but also pointing out that certain jumps may necessitate overly precise execution.
