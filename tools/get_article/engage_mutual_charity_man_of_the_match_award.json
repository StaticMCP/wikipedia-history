The 2011 Super League season (known as the Engage Super League XVI for sponsorship reasons) was the sixteenth season of rugby league football since the Super League format was introduced in 1996. In 2011 the league had fourteen teams: thirteen from England and one from France. In partnership with Sky Sports, Engage Mutual Assurance - title sponsor of the Super League - donated £100 to the Steve Prescott Foundation and £100 to a charity nominated by the Man of the Match, at all live televised Super League games. Over the full season, donations to a variety of charitable causes totaled over £12,000.\nEngage Mutual\n2011 Winners of the Engage Mutual Man of The Match Award\n*  14 May \tHuddersfield v St Helens\n**Danny Brough (Huddersfield) - donated to Brennan Rooney Fund\n* 13 May \tWarrington v Castleford\n**Matt King (Warrington) - donated to Paul Darbyshire Foundation\n* 30 April \tHarlequins v Salford\n**Matty Smith (Salford) - donated to Broadgreen Hospital Cardiac Unit\n* 29 April \tCastleford v Leeds\n**Carl Ablett (Leeds) - donated to Laura Crane Trust\n* 25 April - \tCatalans v Bradford\n**Ian Henderson (Catalans) - donated to Leukaemia Foundation UK\n* 22 April - Hull FC v Hull KR\n**Tom Briscoe (Hull FC) - donated to The Steve Prescott Foundation\n* 22 April -\tWigan v St Helens\n**Pat Richards (Wigan) - donated to Wigan Warriors Foundation\n* 21 April -\tBradford v Leeds\n**Rob Burrow (Leeds) - donated to RTS Suffers\n* 16 April -\tSalford v Bradford\n**Ashley Gibson (Salford) - donated to Salford's Children Hospital\n* 15 April -\tSt Helens v Wakefield\n**Jonny Lomax (St Helens)- donated to TRU Rehab (Brain Damage Charity)\n* 9 April  -\tHull KR v Leeds\n**Ben Galea (Hull KR) - donated to Women and Children's Hospital - Hull\n* 8 April  -\tHuddersfield v Warrington\n**Danny Brough (Huddersfield) - donated to Brennan Rooney Fund\n* 2 April  -\tSalford v Crusaders\n**Gareth Thomas (Crusaders) - donated to Candlelighters\n* 1 April  -\tLeeds v Wigan\n**Danny Buderus (Leeds) - donated to Japanese Tsunami Appeal\n* 26 March \tHull KR v Huddersfield\n**Jermaine McGillvary (Huddersfield) - donated to RiasRainbow.com\n* 25 March \tWigan v Warrington\n**Ben Westwood (Warrington) - donated to Warrington Maternity Unit's Baby Bereavement Suite\n* 19 March \tLeeds v St Helens\n**Jamie Foster (St Helens) - donated to Japanese Earthquake Appeal\n* 18 March \tHuddersfield v Wigan\n**Josh Charnley (Wigan) - donated to Japanese Earthquake Appeal\n* 12 March \tCastleford v Catalan\n**Craig Huby (Castleford) - donated to NZ & Queensland Disaster Fund\n* 11 March \tWakefield v Warrington\n**Ben Harrison (Warrington) - donated to Warrington Wolves Charitable Foundation\n* 5 March \tWarrington v Leeds\n**Rhys Evans (Warrington) - donated to Warrington Wolves Charitable Foundation\n* 4 March \tHarlequins v Huddersfield\n**Shaun Lunt (Huddersfield) - donated to Help the Heroes\n* 26 February \tCrusaders v Bradford\n**Brett Kearney (Bradford) - donated to Breast Cancer Research\n* 25 February \tSt Helens v Warrington\n**Gareth Carvell (Warrington) - donated to National Deaf Children's Society\n* 19 February \tCastleford v Huddersfield\n**Rangi Chase (Castleford)- donated to Prince of Wales Hospice, Pontefract\n* 18 February \tHull FC v Leeds\n**Rob Burrow (Leeds) - donated to Prince of Wales Hospice, Pontefract\nReferences"
