They followed the death in an air crash in February of incumbent President Boris Trajkovski.\nPrime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of the Social Democratic Union won the first round. As he failed to cross the 50% threshold, a second round was held in which he defeated Saško Kedev of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity.
