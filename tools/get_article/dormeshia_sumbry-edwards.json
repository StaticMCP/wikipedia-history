At age 8, she performed at the Tip Tap Festival in Rome. At age 12, she made her Broadway debut in Black and Blue, alongside Gregory Hines, Jimmy Slyde, Buster Brown, and Savion Glover. In 1989, the New York Times described her as part of a young generation who \"have the certain something.\" After graduating from high school, Sumbry-Edwards joined Lynn Dally's Jazz Tap Ensemble as a soloist.\nCareer\nSumbry-Edwards also appeared on Broadway in the Tony Award-winning Bring In Da'Noise, Bring In Da'Funk as the only female tap dancer, initially appearing dressed as a man.
