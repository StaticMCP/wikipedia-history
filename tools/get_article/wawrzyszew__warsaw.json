Photography taken in 2007.]]\nThe first known mention of Wawrzyszew in historical documents comes from 1367. In 1379, Janusz I the Old, the Duke of Warsaw, has granted all profits from five nearby villages, including Wawrzyszew, to the city of Old Warsaw, for eight years. It was done as one of a few policies, to help it financially offset the costs of building the city walls. The village was also historically known as Wawrzyszewo.\nIn the 16th century, Baltazar Smosarski, a physician of the Polish royal court, bought the village of Wawrzyszew. There he founded the construction of the Catholic Church of St. Mary Magdalene, which lasted between 1543 and 1548. It is located at the current 64 Wólczyńska Street.\nOn 26 August 1794, Wawrzyszew was captured and burned down by Prussian forces during the Siege of Warsaw in the Kościuszko Uprising.\nIn the 19th century, next to the Church of St. Mary Magdalene was opened the Wawrzyszew Cemetery. The oldest known grave there comes from 1830.\nIn 1819, the Institute of Agronomics and Forestry had acquired a portion of Wawrzyszew, where around the 1820s, it built three artificial ponds, connected with canals, which later become known as the Brustman Ponds. Two ponds, and a canal connecting them, survive to the present day, with the third pond being filled up at some point.\nIn 1868, the area of four settlements, including Wawrzyszew, was given by Alexander II, the Emperor of Russia, to Alexandr Vladimirovich Patkulov, a general in the Russian Imperial Army, as an award for his service. Patkulov has built there his residence, located next to the Brustman Ponds.\nin 1939.]]\nIn the 1880s, the Fort II had been built to the south-east of Wawrzyszew, as part of the series of fortifications of the Warsaw Fortress, built around Warsaw by the Imperial Russian Army. In 1909, it was decided to decommission and demolish the fortifications of the Warsaw Fortress, due to the high maintenance costs. As such, Fort II was decommissioned and partially demolished. Currently, it is located within the City Information System area of Chomiczówka.\nIn 1909, Wawrzyszew was partitioned and sold off. Its southern portion was bought by brothers Bolesław and Józef Chomicz, who then had established the branch of their agricultural company Bracia Chomicz (lit. Chomicz Brothers), with headquarters at 8 Zgody Street. In 1920, they had begun selling plots of land in a suburban residential neighbourhood of villas, named Chomiczów. In 1933, the project was renamed to Przylesie. In the late 1930s, it gradually became known as Chomiczówka while its former name fell out of use. Bracia Chomicz company functioned until 1937.\nBy 1921, Wawrzyszew was administratively divided into the village of Wawrzyszew Stary (Old Wawrzyszew) to the north, and the settlement of Wawrzyszew Nowy (New Wawrzyszew) to the south. In 1921 Wawrzyszew Stary had a population of 328 people, while Wawrzyszew Nowy, 245 people. By 1933 there were also smaller village of Wawrzyszew Poduchowny, and the settlements of Wawrzyszew Polski, and Wawrzyszew Parafialny.\nDuring the Second World War, on 21 September 1939, the area had been captured by German forces. During the conflict, the Fort II was used as a warehouse. Between 13 and 14 June 1943, a division of the People's Militia of the Worker's Party of Polish Socialists had attacked it, destroying a portion of the supplies stored there.\nFollowing the beginning of the Warsaw Uprising, between 1 and 2 August 1944, the Polish partisans of the Home Army had attacked the nearby Bielany Aerodrome, which was heavily guarded by German forces. The attack was unsuccessful, ending in a German victory, and retreat of the partisans. There were also clashes in the area of Bielany, including a few small fights in Wawrzyszew. On 3 August 1944, German forces attacked partisants in Bielany, which fought of the attack with heavy losses.\nFollowing the unsuccessful attack, German forces had decided to take revenge on the population of Wawrzyszew. Later that day, German forces, who according to the testimonies of the witnesses were from the Protection Squadron, had entered the village. They had set buildings on fire, destroyed them with grenades, and expelled the population. People who fought back, or were to slow to leave, were killed at the scene. Additionally, the attackers had d\nalso executed several men. In total 30 people, including women and children, were killed, while a portion of the village was burned down. The surviving population was displaced.\nOn 14 May 1951, the area, including Wawrzyszew Stary, Wawrzyszew Nowy, and Chomiczówka, was incorporated from the municipality of Młociny into the city of Warsaw, within the district of Żoliborz.\nIn the 1960s, at 53 Wolumen Street was opened the Wolumen Marketplace.\nIn the 1970s, the Warsaw Housing Cooperative built a neighbourhood of Wawrzyszew, consisting of the multifamily residential large panel system buildings.  Simultaneously, to the south was built the neighbourhood of Chomiczówka, also consisting of the multifamily residential large panel system buildings.\nIn 1980, at 1 Goldoniego Street was opened community centre, now known as the Bielany Cultural Centre.\nOn 19 June 1994, it became part of the city subdivision of the municipality of Warsaw-Bielany. On 27 October 2002, it became part of the district of Bielany.\nBetween 1994 and 1997, at 64 Wólczyńska Street, next to the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, the new Catholic Church of Mary the Mother of Entrustment was built.\nIn 1997, Bielany was subdivided into areas of the City Information System. The neighbourhood was divided into two divisions, that being, Wawrzyszew to the north, and Chomiczówka to the south.\nOn 25 October 2008 in Wawrzyszew were opened two stations of the M1 line of the Warsaw Metro rapid transit underground system. They were Wawrzyszew, located at the intersection of Kasprowicza Street, Lindego Street, and Wolumen Street, and Młociny located at the intersection of Kasprowicza Street, Nocznickiego Street, and Zgrupowania AK \"Kampinos\" Street.\nCharacteristics\nWawrzyszew is a residential neighbourhood consisting of the multifamily residential apartment buildings.
