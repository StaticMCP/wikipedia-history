Infanterie-Division) was a formation of the Imperial German Army in World War I.  The division was formed in November 1914 as the provisional Westernhagen Division (Division Westernhagen), named after its commander.  The nucleus of the unit was troops collected at Posen.  It became the 89th Infantry Division in August 1915.   The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nCombat chronicle\nThe Westernhagen Division initially served on the Eastern Front. It fought in the Battle of Łódź in November/December 1914.  From December 1914 to July 1915, it was in the line in the fighting on the Rawka and Bzura Rivers.  In July and August 1915, it fought around Warsaw and then participated in the siege of Modlin Fortress.  It was redesignated the 89th Infantry Division in August and then fought in the Battles of Neman and Vilnius.  After the line stabilized, the division was in positional warfare until September 1916.  It then went south to participate in the Romanian campaign.  It fought in Romania until the armistice there in December 1917, and thereafter remained in the line securing the armistice.  From May to November 1918, it was in the occupation troops in Romania.
