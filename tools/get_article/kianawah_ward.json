      "text": "# Kianawah Ward\n\nKianawah Ward was a Brisbane City Council ward from 1985 to 1994. It covered the present-day suburbs of Lota, Lytton, Manly, Port of Brisbane, and Wynnum; the majority of  Wynnum West; and parts of Manly West, Ransome Tingalpa, and Wakerley.\nThe ward was established for the 1985 Brisbane City Council election as part of an increase from 21 to 26 wards. It was created from most of the eastern part of the abolished Waterloo Bay Ward, combined with a small part of Ransome and Wakerley from the retained Carina Ward. It was abolished for the 1994 Brisbane City Council election, and was largely replaced by the Wynnum Manly Ward.\nDon Randall of the Labor Party was the only alderman to represent the ward, and had previously represented the Waterloo Bay Ward since 1979. Randall resigned in June 1993 due to poor health, and the ward remained vacant until its abolition at the 1994 election.\nCouncillors for Kianawah Ward\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Don Randall\n| Labor\n| 30 March 1985 –\n| Resigned due to poor health.\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" | Vacant\n|  – 26 March 1994\n|\n|}\nReferences"
