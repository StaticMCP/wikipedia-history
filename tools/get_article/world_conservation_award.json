Different countries have set different standards or criteria in order for Scouts to receive this award.\nBoy Scouts of America\nIn the Boy Scouts of America, the World Conservation Award is presented at three levels:\n* Cub Scouting: The requirements differ by rank, but Cub Scouts at all levels must learn about nature and participate in a den or pack conservation project.  Webelos Scouts must earn the Forester, Naturalist, and Outdoorsman activity badges and take part in a den or pack conservation project. The Cub Scout World Conservation Award uses the panda emblem on a gold background with a blue border.\n* Boy Scouting: by earning the Environmental Science merit badge, either Soil and Water Conservation or Fish and Wildlife Management merit badge, and Citizenship in the World merit badge. The Boy Scout World Conservation Award uses the panda emblem on a tan background with a tan border.\n* Venturing: by earning the Ecology elective of the Ranger Award and by showing and teaching about environmental relationships.
