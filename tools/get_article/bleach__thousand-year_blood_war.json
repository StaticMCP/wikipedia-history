Ichigo breaks free and returns to the Soul Society for help. He trades blows with Yhwach, but is quickly defeated. Yhwach attempts to kill Ichigo, but is countered by him awakening a defensive Quincy technique called Blut Vëne. Yhwach reveals Quilge's Jail can only be broken by a Quincy, but Ichigo does not know the truth about himself or his mother, Masaki. Shadow portals appear to transport the Quincy back to Silbern and Yhwach realizes that Aizen used his Shikai ability on him to lose track of time. Ichigo tries to charge at Yhwach, but his Zanpakutō is destroyed by Haschwalth.

Kūkaku, having sent them up to the Royal Palace, joins her brother Ganju, Kūgo Ginjō, Shūkurō Tsukishima, and Giriko Kutsuzawa, who now reside in the Soul Society, since they were killed with a Zanpakutō, given a proper burial, and did not become Hollows. At the Royal Palace, Ichigo, Rukia, Renji, and Byakuya, are being healed by Tenjirō Kirinji, a member of Squad Zero and the one who taught Unohana healing techniques. The Soul King is seen awakening.\n| LineColor       = AC1E1B\n}}\n| DirectedBy      = Kaito Asakura\n| WrittenBy       = Masaki Hiramatsu\n| Aux2            = Kaito Asakura\n| Aux3            = Michio Hasegawa\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         = July 27, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = Ichigo and Renji are healed completely by Kirinji.

Unohana and Kenpachi fight at the underground prison, Muken. Kenpachi recalls how he used to admire Unohana, from their first meeting on, when he scarred her chest. Unohana states that he has become far weaker since then and she will push him to the brink of death and revive him repeatedly to unlock his full potential.\n| LineColor       = AC1E1B\n}}\n| AltDate         = August 3, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = Hundreds of years ago, Unohana, weary of fighting bandits, sought a true challenge until she encountered the fierce child Kenpachi. Though she was initially overpowered, Kenpachi subconsciously restrained himself, leading to his defeat. In the present, their battle resumes as Unohana repeatedly wounds Kenpachi, each death and revival sharpening his strength. She unleashes her Bankai, Minazuki, transforming her blade into streams of acidic blood-like slashes. Ultimately, Kenpachi grows strong enough to withstand her attacks and strikes the killing blow. As Unohana dies, he mourns her loss but finally awakens his own Zanpakutō, forging the bond he had long lacked. Meanwhile, Ichigo, Renji, and Kon arrive at Nimaiya's palace, Hoohden, where they encounter Zanpakutō spirits and the eccentric creator of the blades himself. Nimaiya explains the origin of Zanpakutō: Soul Reapers are first given a nameless Asauchi, which gradually evolve into their personalized weapon as they imprint their spiritual essence upon it. To prove themselves, Renji and Ichigo are cast into a pit swarming with countless Asauchi and given a three day endurance test. Renji successfully bonds with his weapon. However, Ichigo fails the test and Nimaiya abruptly sends him back to the Human World so he can rediscover his origins.\n| LineColor       = AC1E1B\n}}\n| AltDate         = August 10, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = Nimaiya tells Renji that he forged every Zanpakutō over the past several thousand years, including Kenpachi's, which was taken from a dead Soul Reaper. However, Ichigo's Zanpakutō was not one of his Asauchi, making his training crucial. Ichigo visits Ikumi Unagiya, but is taken away by his father, Isshin, in Soul Reaper form, leaving his badge behind. Isshin reveals that Ichigo's mother, Masaki, was a Quincy. Nearly 20 years ago, as captain of Squad 10, Isshin investigated Soul Reaper deaths in Naraki City caused by a powerful Hollow named \"White\", created from multiple dead Soul Reapers' souls. Masaki, an Echt Quincy raised by Sōken Ishida's family, sensed the Hollow's presence and intervened despite protests from Ryūken and the family maid Kanae Katagiri. While battling the Hollow, Isshin was ambushed and wounded by Aizen, Gin Ichimaru, and Kaname Tōsen, who had created \"White\". Masaki saved Isshin, defeating the Hollow at the cost of triggering its self-destruction. Isshin protected her and learned she was a Quincy. Fearing rejection, Masaki was relieved when Isshin warmly accepted her. Ryūken and Kanae, seeing she was safe, left her.

After the mission, he reported to Yamamoto but left out Masaki's involvement. Drawn to her, he continued patrolling the Human World. Meanwhile, Masaki began feeling the effects of the Hollow soul that had merged with her, collapsing as a Hollow hole appeared on her chest. Berated by Ryūken's mother for helping a Soul Reaper, Masaki was taken for help by Ryūken, who blamed Isshin for her condition. Urahara intervened, explaining he discovered a cure during his hundred-year exile while studying the Visoreds. Unlike Soul Reapers, Quincies lack resistance to Hollow souls, so Masaki's powerful Quincy soul needed the presence of a full Soul Reaper's powers to stabilize her for life. Isshin volunteered, and Urahara gave him a special Gigai to seal his powers and make him human. Isshin and Masaki later fell in love, while Ryūken married Kanae. Isshin reveals the reason that Masaki died saving Ichigo from Grand Fisher, and Katagiri died from her illness, was because of Yhwach, who nine years earlier used Auswählen to absorb the powers of Quincies he deemed to be impure. Before leaving, Ichigo retrieves his badge from Ikumi.\n| LineColor       = AC1E1B\n}}\n| DirectedBy      = Tomohisa Taguchi, Mitsutoshi Satō& Yoshinori Odaka\n| WrittenBy       = Masaki Hiramatsu\n| Aux2            = Tomohisa Taguchi\n| Aux3            = Kumiko Takayanagi\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         = August 24, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = Ichigo is guided back to the Royal Palace by one of Nimaiya's Zanpakutō bodyguards.

Meanwhile, in Soul Society, preparations for the next battle intensify. Hitsugaya returns to train in swordsmanship, determined to improve. Kensei Muguruma assigns unofficial lieutenant Mashiro Kuna to train under Hisagi, pushing him toward awakening his Bankai. Akon, recovering from injuries, discovers that Mayuri and Nemu Kurotsuchi have sealed themselves inside the lab, pursuing a mysterious project. Elsewhere, Komamura seeks his clan elder to learn a secret technique, while Soi-Fon sharpens her skills through solitary training in the mountains. Back at the palace, Nimaiya forges Ichigo's true Zanpakutō, revealing the truth: \"White\" is his actual Soul Reaper blade, while \"Old Man Zangetsu\" is the embodiment of his Quincy powers who resembles Yhwach from a thousand years ago. Zangetsu explains that he suppressed Ichigo's full Soul Reaper strength to protect him and finally releases his control on it, proud of Ichigo's growth. Ichigo embraces both embodiments, manifesting his dual-bladed Shikai, the True Zangetsu. In Silbern, Haschwalth presents Uryū, wearing the Stern Ritter attire, to Yhwach.\n| LineColor       = AC1E1B\n}}\n| DirectedBy      = Hikaru Murata\n| WrittenBy       = Masaki Hiramatsu\n| Aux2            = Tomohisa Taguchi, Hikaru Murata& Yusaku Kikuchi\n| Aux3            = Kiyoshi Komatsubara\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         = August 31, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = Ichigo begins his training with Ichibe'e Hyōsube, the captain of Squad 0. Meanwhile, Yhwach gathers the Quincy army to announce that he has chosen Uryū as his successor, causing discord between many of the Stern Ritters who considered Haschwalth more worthy for the post. Askin Nakk Le Vaar stops the ruckus between other ones, specifically Bazz-B and Haschwalth. Orihime and Chad train at Hueco Mundo, while Urahara researches the Quincy Medallion. Ichibe'e leads Ichigo to a special place in the Royal Palace, which can only be accessed with permission from the Soul King, in order to make him stronger. New Head Captain Shunsui Kyōraku gives Ichigo's human friends a Soul Ticket into the Soul Society in case Ichigo's spiritual pressure becomes too much for the Human World to bear. Rukia and Renji continue their training in the Royal Palace, while Byakuya recovers with Kirinji's help. A dark dome engulfs the Seireitei and the Quincy army returns for the next battle. Yhwach declares that he will retake the world in the next nine days, as per the Quincy Song, the Kaiser Gesang.\n| LineColor       = 1335A9\n}}\n| AltDate         = September 7, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = The Wandenreich launch their second invasion of the Seireitei. Haschwalth orders the Stern Ritters who stole Bankai to defeat their respective robbed captains. In Squad 12, Askin confronts its members and explains that the Wandenreich fortress was forged from Quincy powers and exists hidden within the Seireitei's shadows, where the Quincies observed and studied them. Mayuri and Nemu emerge from his personal lab, now lit in constant brightness, where Mayuri crafted countermeasures against Quincy techniques. Irritated by Mayuri's persistence, Askin withdraws. Elsewhere, Haschwalth confronts Shunsui and Nanao, only for Nanao to halt him with a high-level Kido. Across the Seireitei, chaos erupts as Soul Reapers clash with Soldat troops.

Hitsugaya and Rangiku attempt coordinated tactics, but Bazz-B overwhelms them with ease. Before Hitsugaya can recover from Bazz-B's assault, Stern Ritter \"I\" Cang Du intervenes and prepares to finish Hitsugaya off with his own Bankai. At the same time, BG9 gravely wounds Soi Fon. Just as hope seems lost, Urahara contacts Mayuri, announcing he has discovered a way to reclaim the stolen Bankai.\n| LineColor       = 1335A9\n}}\n| Aux3            = Kumiko Takayanagi\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         = September 14, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = Cang Du has already defeated Rangiku and moves to finish off Hitsugaya. Urahara informs Mayuri he has created the Shin'eiyaku: a black pill that hollowfies Bankai, rendering them poisonous to Quincies. He discovered this weakness after Quilge's inability to properly control Arrancar Reishi. The pills are distributed to all captains and several lieutenants. Hitsugaya takes the pill, activating his hollowfied Bankai, and freezes Cang Du. BG9 attempts to harvest the unconscious Soi-Fon, but Ōmaeda gives her the pill, enabling her to unleash her Bankai to eliminate BG9. Squad 5 captain Shinji Hirako activates his Bankai, Sakashima Yokoshima Happō Fusagari, causing enemies and allies alike to get confused and making the Soldats kill each other. Yumichika, Hisagi, and Ikkaku ingest the Shin'eiyaku, and are ambushed by Stern Ritter \"S\" Mask de Masculine, who easily overwhelms them.

While Momo retreats with Shinji, Komamura shields them. Bambietta reveals her power is not conventional bombs, but the ability to make anything struck by her Reishi projectiles explode. She blasts apart Komamura's helmet, exposing his new human appearance. Komamura explains that he sacrificed his own heart to his clan elder, gaining the secret Jinka Technique. In this temporary form, he is immortal and impervious to harm. Summoning his Bankai, now unarmored and invulnerable, Komamura drives Bambietta back by deflecting her projectiles and defeats her. Komamura immediately rushes toward Yhwach, but his heart fails and he is reduced to a pure wolf form. His lieutenant, Tetsuzaemon Iba, carries him away. A gravely injured Bambietta is discovered by her close Sternritter friends. Meanwhile, Uryū gathers the fallen Cang Du and BG9, while Haschwalth returns to Yhwach's side.

Kensei unleashes his Bankai, Tekken Tachikaze, against Mask de Masculine and briefly overwhelms him, but Mask quickly recovers thanks to James' cheers and critically wounds him. Hisagi warns that James is the source of Mask's strength, so Rose slices him in half and activates his Bankai, Kinshara Butōdan, producing illusions through music. Mask counters this by rupturing his eardrums and defeats Rose. As Mask moves to finish Rose off, Renji arrives and blocks his blow. Rukia follows, revealing that both have completed Squad 0's training. She evacuates the injured captains to Kotetsu for healing as Renji battles Mask. James survives his injury and continues empowering Mask, who triggers his Vollständig and fires a massive Reishi blast at Renji that incinerates James. Renji withstands Mask's attack with his complete Bankai: Sō-ō Zabimaru, which he can now properly wield after previously being given its false name. He counters with Zāgā Tēppō, turning Mask into ash. Inside Silbern, Yhwach absorbs Mask's Reishi before vanishing into a shadow, leaving Haschwalth behind. Haschwalth tells Uryū that all Quincies are bound to Yhwach, and as his heir, he should be told the truth about him.\n| LineColor       = 1335A9\n}}\n| AltDate         = October 5, 2025\n| ShortSummary    = After completing training with Squad 0, Ichigo begins descending towards the Seireitei and informs Urahara.

As Rukia scouts around the Seireitei, she confronts Stern Ritter \"F\" Äs Nödt, who is looking for Byakuya. Since Rukia is now much stronger and has learned about her Zanpakutō's true abilities, particularly its ability to lower the user's temperature and anything they touch to absolute zero, she manages to freeze Äs. Angered by Rukia's suggestion that he is afraid, Äs activates his Vollständig and begins instilling fear via Rukia's optic nerves.

Gremmy explains that his true ability is turning imagination into reality and states he has already killed Rose and Kensei. Demonstrating his power, he imagines Yachiru's bones turning into cookies, which incapacitates her. Kenpachi arrives and informs Isane of Unohana's death before challenging Gremmy. Gremmy attempts to drown Kenpachi, but he breaks free and wounds him. Gremmy then imagines heavy artillery and a clone to double his power, but Kenpachi withstands them. Gremmy then imagines a meteor falling into the Seireitei. Kenpachi releases his Zanpakutō, Nozarashi, and slashes the meteor in pieces. Gremmy creates numerous clones, casting Kenpachi into outer space, yet he escapes it and slashes Gremmy again. Desperate, Gremmy imagines his body to be as strong as Kenpachi's, but his perception of Kenpachi as a monster causes his own body to collapse under immense pressure.

The Bambies activate their Quincy Vollständig forms to fight him. Candice charges an immense lightning bolt to attack Ichigo, but he counters her by merging two Getsuga Tenshō into one powerful cross-shaped strike, the Getsuga Jūjishō, severing Candice's arm. Giselle regenerates it for her using a dead Soul Reaper's flesh. Before the Bambies can attack Ichigo again, several other Stern Ritters intervene.

Using a genetically modified blood-like substance, Mayuri seizes full control of Giselle's Soul Reaper zombies and one of them impales her. Elsewhere, Byakuya unleashes his Bankai to defeat Candice, Robert Accutrone, and NaNaNa Najahkoop, while Meninas and Liltotto observe from a distance. Hisagi arrives to assist but suddenly turns on Byakuya, revealing he is being manipulated by PePe Waccabrada, Stern Ritter \"L\". PePe's power, The Love, enslaves anything with a soul, including Meninas, who goes on to attack Liltotto. PePe even enchants Senbonzakura to his will, forcing Byakuya's Zanpakutō against him as Hisagi takes it under PePe's influence. Just as Byakuya is cornered, Mayuri and his zombified allies arrive. Kensei incapacitates Hisagi and activates his Bankai to obliterate PePe. Liltotto stumbles upon PePe and devours him as revenge backstabbing her and Meninas.

Yhwach questioned why the Soul Reapers enslaved the Soul King, his father, and used him to split one eternal realm into the World of the Living, Hueco Mundo, and Soul Society. Though Ichibe offered the Soul King's left arm as a peace token, Yhwach swore to erase his father and reunify the realms to \"save\" him. In the present, Urahara fires a cannon to send Ichigo, Orihime, Chad, Yoruichi, and Ganju to the Royal Palace. Aware of the invading Quincies, Senjumaru leads the Royal Guard in cutting down the Soldaten and killing Nianzol Weizol \"W\", the Wind. In response, Yhwach summons his Schutzstaffel: Lille Barro (\"X\"), Gerard Valkyrie (\"M\"), Pernida Parnkgjas (\"C\"), and newly promoted Askin. Lille apparently fires a shot through Senjumaru's head and destroys the Soul Palace. However, Senjumaru reveals this was all a decoy and the Quincies are actually trapped within Kirio's Cage of Life. Joined by Tenjirō and Ōetsu, the Royal Guard counterattacks. Ōetsu unveils Sayafushi, a Zanpakutō so sharp it cannot be sheathed, and annihilates the Schutzstaffel.

Meanwhile, Ichibe clashes with Yhwach, wielding his brush-shaped Zanpakutō that cuts names instead of flesh, halving the power of whatever it strikes. A single blow drastically weakens Yhwach. Tenjirō activates his Shikai to defeat Haschwalth, while Senjumaru manipulates Reishi to overwhelm Uryū's Licht Regen, knocking him unconscious. Ōetsu is stunned when Askin survives his earlier strike. Askin reveals that his Schrift \"D\", the Deathdealing, allows him to control lethal dosages of substances within his body and others. By ingesting his own blood, he make its dangerously toxic to Ōetsu. Tenjirō intervenes, using his hot springs to purge the poison from Ōetsu's system, allowing him to finally kill Askin. Ichibe's momentum in his fight halts when Yhwach activates Auswählen, absorbing Reishi and Schrift powers from surviving Stern Ritters in the Seireitei to resurrect the Schutzstaffel and Haschwalth, who all ascend into Vollständig. Liltotto, Giselle, and Bazz-B manage to survive this and swear vengeance.

Senjumaru rescues and heals Ōetsu while Kirio transforms the battlefield with overgrown flora, splitting opponents for one-on-one duels. Senjumaru immobilizes Gerard with her threads, Kirio entraps Pernida in Reishi seeds, and Askin dodges Tenjirō's assaults. Ōetsu evades Lille's shots, even standing atop his rifle before countering. Ichibe continues battling Yhwach using high-level Kidō and activates his Shikai, splattering black ink that erases names and, by extension, power. When Yhwach's blade is stained, it becomes useless. Gerard breaks free and defeats Senjumaru, Pernida shreds Kirio's roots, and Askin wounds Tenjirō. Lille overcomes Ōetsu's speed by firing through him directly. Ōetsu reveals that their true powers were sealed to prevent cosmic imbalance as he, Tenjirō, and Kirio sacrifice themselves and channel their lifeforce into Senjumaru. She releases her Bankai: Shatatsu Karagara Shigaraminotsuji, enveloping the Schutzstaffel, Haschwalth, and Uryū in a shifting void where she individually executes them with woven cloths.

Meanwhile, Ichigo's group reaches Yhwach, not knowing that he already impaled the Soul King. Ichigo confronts Yhwach, who compliments his powers gained through his training with Ichibe'e, but claims that Ichibe'e purposefully sent the young man after him knowing that he would not win the battle. However, Yhwach reveals that he has not yet used his eyes and activates The Almighty, allowing him to foresee and nullify all of Ichigo's strikes, bringing him back to his group beaten and questioning his reasons to fight. Yhwach unveils the impaled Soul King, his father Adnyeus, shocking them. Yhwach details how the all-powerful Soul King separated the three worlds from darkness and was able to foresee even a thousand years into the future. Ichigo rises to attack, supported by Orihime and Yoruichi, though Yhwach dispels any danger to him, Ichigo reaches the Soul King and pulls the blade out of him, falling into Yhwach's trap. Forced by the Quincy blood in him, Ichigo inadvertently kills the Soul King. Yhwach revels that everything proceeded how he foresaw it would, and explains that only someone who is a hybrid of human, Soul Reaper, Quincy, Fullbringer, and Hollow like Ichigo could kill the Soul King.

Ukitake joins the Soul Reaper Academy under the tutelage of Yamamoto, Sasakibe, and Unohana, and becomes close friends with his sparring partner Shunsui, confiding in him about Mimihagi. Later, the two mourn Kaien, and Yamamoto with Unohana, after which Ukitake bids farewell to Unohana. Back in the present day, Ukitake reveals to the others that the Kamikake process he underwent gave all his organs, not just his lungs to Mimihagi and, after handing over Squad 13 to Rukia, uses his life force to hold the Soul King together temporarily. While Ichigo, Yoruichi, Chad, and Ganju try to distract Yhwach, Orihime fails to reverse the Soul King's death, but Mimihagi attaches itself to him, something that not even Yhwach's eyes foresaw.

As he attempts to destroy both, Ichigo disengages his Blut Vene, releasing Yhwach's blade and grabbing his arm to stop him. Yoruichi sets up a stabilizing barrier around the Soul King's remains. Yhwach mocks Ichigo for not being able to kill the man who murdered his mother, calling him weak. As Ichigo moves to attack in anger, Uryū unexpectedly shoots Yoruichi, causing her to lose focus and break the barrier. Pernida and Yhwach blast her off the Soul Palace. Uryū claims loyalty to the Quincies as Ichigo, devastated, begins battling him. During their fight, Uryū is surprised to see Ichigo can use Blut Vene, a Quincy ability, to block his arrow. Meanwhile, Chad, Ganju, and Orihime struggle against the Schutzstaffel, and are quickly overwhelmed. Uryū activates his Vollständig and clashes with Ichigo again. As they fight, Uryū prepares a massive Quincy arrow, but Ichigo counters with Getsuga Jūjishō. Their attacks collide in midair, creating a powerful shockwave. Uryū then lands a direct, devastating arrow strike on Ichigo, severely injuring him and sending him falling. Taking advantage of the chaos, Yhwach breaks the Soul King's crystal completely and absorbs both the Soul King's body and its right arm.

At this moment, Aizen arrives, restrained in Mayuri's chair, and obliterates the creatures using only his immense spiritual pressure. Though many Soul Reapers are uneasy about relying on Aizen, Shunsui defends the decision, stating that honor is meaningless in the face of such a threat. Suddenly, Aizen is immobilized by NaNaNa Najahkoop, who uses his Schrift, The Underbelly, on him. The surviving Quincies: Bazz-B, Liltotto, and Giselle intervene, with Bazz-B killing NaNaNa for his actions and revealing the group's intention to betray Yhwach for abandoning them. Shunsui accepts their aid. In order to reach the Soul Palace, he calls on all remaining Soul Reapers to channel their Reiryoku into a gate that Urahara can use. As the Visoreds handle the gate's construction, Kenpachi, now recovered from his fight with Gremmy, arrives and briefly searches for Yachiru. Aizen, also fully recovered, prepares to assist from the ground level. The assault team, which includes captains, lieutenants, Visoreds, and the rogue Quincies, assembles to storm the palace, leaving Aizen behind in the chair. Back at the palace, Orihime heals Ichigo and Yoruichi, with the group already plotting a counterattack. Yoruichi opens a portal to Hueco Mundo to summon Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez.

The Soul Reapers power up the gate as the Seireitei starts to crumble. Due to Yhwach, more cities in the Seireitei begin to break down, the remains of which he raises up to the Soul Palace, completely transforming it into a Quincy city named Wahr Welt, which is shaped like a massive Quincy Zeichen. Ichigo's group and the Soul Reapers arrive at Wahr Welt simultaneously, shocked by the power one could wield to reshape the entire Soul Palace effortlessly.

Mayuri and Nemu split off from Kenpachi, Hanatarō, Yumichika, and Ikkaku, and both groups venture off towards the main keep, while Gerard is searching for Soul Reapers to fight. After Bazz-B, Liltotto and Giselle separate from them to confront Haschwalth and Yhwach respectively, the main Soul Reaper group is assaulted by Lille, who succeeds in shooting Hisagi, Ōmaeda, Kiyone, Sentarō and Isane down, thus scattering the group. Uryū begins firing arrows, separating Renji from the group as well. Renji unleashes his True Bankai and effortlessly overpowers Uryū until the latter activates Vollständig, but Renji powers through and grounds the latter. Backed into a corner, Uryū uses Sklave Rei to overcharge his Vollständig, after which he overcomes Renji and shoots him through the chest.

Despite Mayuri's warnings, Kenpachi recklessly charges Pernida and lands a blow, but Pernida retaliates by manipulating Kenpachi's body through its nerves, twisting his right arm grotesquely until Kenpachi is forced to sever it. Charging again, Kenpachi is overwhelmed and begins to spiral apart, prompting Mayuri to paralyze him with a stab from behind to halt Pernida's control. Mayuri deduces that Pernida weaponizes its nerves, which can invade and manipulate organic or even inorganic matter. He burns them with acid, but Pernida responds by mutating into an even larger form and begins speaking. When Mayuri severs one of Pernida's fingers to contain it as a specimen, Pernida simply regenerates more arms from the severed fingers, revealing its terrifying regenerative power. To counter, Mayuri unveils a modified version of his Bankai: Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō Matai Fukuin Shōtai. This new Bankai manifests as a giant, pregnant Ashisogi Jizō, capable of instantaneously birthing battle-ready variants of itself tailored to the enemy’s abilities. Mayuri's creation has 70,000 layers of nerves to prevent control by Pernida, shedding layers as needed.

As per Shunsui's orders, Nanao instructs the others to continue ahead, while she runs back to join Shunsui. After his rifle is severed by Shunsui, Lille explains that the rifle is part of him, made from Reishi and that he was the first Quincy to receive power from Yhwach, referring to himself as God's messenger sent to punish sinners. Lille then fully activates his Vollständig, turning into an angelic, eight-winged being who supposedly cannot be killed by any weapon, and gravely injures Shunsui. Shunsui is forced to use his Bankai, Katen Kyōkotsu Karamatsu Shinju on him, which envelops most of Wahr Welt. Within this area, Shunsui can initiate various theater plays composed of several acts, this time selecting a play composed of four acts with two actors, him and Lille. With act 1, he reflects his injuries onto his opponent, with act 2 he infects Lille with an illness, with act 3 he plummets them both into an infinite sea and with the final act, he uses a thread made up of Lille's supposed regret for harming him to decapitate him.

After regenerating their arms with drugs, Mayuri distracts Pernida while assigning Nemu to inject a nerve-coagulating agent into one of its arrows. The coagulant begins spreading through Pernida's body but is halted when it severs the infected finger. Mayuri realizes that Pernida is rapidly evolving, adapting to counter every strategy. Nemu continues pushing beyond her limits, outputting extraordinary power. Compressing six percent of her soul, she pierces Pernida, but its exploding remains regenerate into more arms, which obliterate her and absorbing most of her remains. A devastated Mayuri recovers her brain. As Pernida closes in, Mayuri reveals a hidden trap: Nemu's pituitary gland contained a synthetic organ that triggers uncontrollable cell division without her brain. Pernida's body begins to mutate and explodes, though not before one last nerve twist renders Mayuri's legs useless. Yumichika and Ikkaku rescue him, and Mayuri instructs them to retrieve his containment pods holding Rangiku, Hitsugaya, Kensei, and Rose, all of whom he successfully de-zombified at the cost of some of their life expectancy.

The clan's sacred weapon, Shinken Hakkyōken, is passed down to female heirs and reflects the power of godlike beings back onto them. After her husband's death, the Ise matriarch returns to her family with her unborn daughter Nanao, seeking to protect her from the blade's curse by secretly entrusting it to Shunsui. He conceals it inside his second Zanpakutō spirit, Okyo, created by Ohana, his first Zanpakutō spirit. The Central 46 sentences Nanao's mother to death for losing the sacred treasure. Nanao later enrolls in the Soul Reaper Academy, excelling at Kido and nearly joining the Kido Corps, but is instead assigned to Squad 8, where she unknowingly reunites with her uncle, Shunsui, who mentors her. Back in the present day, Shunsui is critically wounded by Lille, who assumes a new angelic form in his Vollständig and attacks with divine light. Nanao rejoins him, and using his Shikai, Shunsui hides them in Lille's shadow. After revealing their shared history, Shunsui gives Nanao her inherited Zanpakutō. Despite being injured, Nanao uses Shinken Hakkyōken to sever Lille's arm. Together they reflect his ultimate blast, a massive trumpet-shaped energy bomb, back at him, which destroys most of Wahr Welt and severs Lille in half. After the battle, Shunsui and Nanao collapse and begin to recover.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n| DirectedBy      = Dali Chen\n| WrittenBy       = Masaki Hiramatsu\n| Aux2            = Toshiyuki Tsuru\n| Aux3            = Kiyoshi Komatsubara\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         =\n| ShortSummary    = Over a thousand years ago in Licht Reich, young Quincies Bazzard \"Bazz-B\" Black and Jugram \"Jugo\" Haschwalth live in the rurals. Though Jugo is unable to absorb Reishi or form a Heilig Bogen, Bazz-B is highly talented. The two bond through hunting, with Bazz-B for training and Jugo for food. Their lives change when Yhwach and his forces destroy their homes and kill their families, leaving the boys orphaned. For the next five years, they train in the wilderness, with Jugo learning swordsmanship to make up for his lack of Quincy abilities. During a visit to town, they encounter Yhwach's soldiers, who are recruiting young Quincies for the Stern Ritter to prepare for war against the Soul Society. When they try to enlist and are dismissed, Bazz-B challenges one of the soldiers. Yhwach suddenly arrives, overwhelming everyone with his spiritual pressure, except for Jugo, who remains standing. Yhwach declares Jugo to be just like him: a Balance Quincy, who cannot form power but distributes it to others and later reclaims it. Bazz-B tries to attack Yhwach, but Jugo deflects it, revealing the bond between them has already begun to fracture. Three years later, Haschwalth becomes the Stern Ritter's commander, while Bazz-B joins as a soldier. Bazz-B continually challenges him to duels, hoping to one day rise up together against Yhwach. Back in the present, during Yhwach's slumber, Bazz-B attacks Haschwalth with his full power, aiming to end Yhwach's influence on him. However, Haschwalth coldly defeats and kills his former friend.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n| AltDate         =\n| ShortSummary    = While Yhwach absorbs Mimihagi in his sleep, causing massive earthquakes across the three worlds, Haschwalth activates The Almighty and begins interrogating Uryū Ishida about his true intentions. Meanwhile, the Visoreds find and heal Renji, who rejoins Urahara, Shinji, Momo, Rukia, Byakuya, and Soi-Fon just in time to face Gerard Valkyrie, who challenges them all at once. Elsewhere, Askin Nakk Le Vaar defeats Ichigo, Orihime, and Chad, explaining that Gerard and Pernida were not given their Schrifts by Yhwach, but were instead named after powers they already possessed as the respective heart and left arm of the Soul King. Askin prepares to eliminate the group when suddenly Yoruichi intervenes. Orihime quickly heals everyone, and Yoruichi sends Ichigo's group off to confront Yhwach, while her brother Yūshirō arrives to assist in battle with her. Meanwhile, after Gerard is overwhelmed and seemingly defeated by the Soul Reapers, he resurrects himself as a towering giant through his Schrift, \"The Miracle\", which transforms damage inflicted on him into growth. As Rangiku and Hanatarō witness from afar, Gerard devastates nearly the entire group, sparing only Urahara. Askin, now immune to Yūshirō's spiritual pressure through his Schrift, seriously wounds him. Meanwhile, Haschwalth accuses Uryū of a future betrayal and attacks. Uryū is knocked down, crash-landing near Ichigo and his team. Back in the World of the Living, Isshin and Ryūken meet at the graveyard and prepare to head to the Soul Society.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n| DirectedBy      = Hikaru Murata & Tomohisa Taguchi\n| WrittenBy       = Masaki Hiramatsu\n| Aux2            = Hikaru Murata\n| Aux3            = Kumiko Takayanagi\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| AltDate         =\n| ShortSummary    = Haschwalth confronts Uryū, claiming he has already foreseen his thoughts and commands him to kill Ichigo, Orihime, and Chad to prove his loyalty. Meanwhile, in the World of the Living, Isshin and Ryūken use Sōken's old Sun Key to access the Gate of the Sun and enter Wahr Welt. Simultaneously, Riruka and Yukio arrive at the Shiba estate. In Seireitei, Lille's remains fall and begin to spawn smaller clones. However, they are swiftly eliminated by a revived Izuru Kira. As Gerard pursues the injured Momo, the Visoreds assemble and hollowfy to confront him. Yoruichi continues her battle against Askin, shielding her brother Yūshirō. During their battle, Uryū and Ichigo's clash tumbles the group to the castle's lower levels. Uryū finally reveals his true motive: he joined Yhwach not out of loyalty, but to stop him. He cites his grandfather Sōken's book, which warned that Yhwach's revival came at the cost of countless Quincy lives, and that he must be stopped in order to preserve the Quinces' honor. Uryū urges the group to escape to the World of the Living using his Sun Key, but Haschwalth suddenly arrives, revealing that he foresaw this and already destroyed the gate. Uryū then sends Ichigo, Orihime, and Chad ahead to directly fight Yhwach, staying behind to face Haschwalth who expresses surprise at his optimism. Uryū retorts that an Almighty should not be surprised if they truly foresaw the future. Meanwhile, Yhwach kills the surviving Bambies, as Ichigo's group closes in on him.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\nRecap special\n| ShortSummary    = A recap special covering the first 21 episodes of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War\n| TopColor        = E9E9E9\n| LineColor       = AC1E1B\n}}\nHome media release\nJapanese\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 70%;\"\n|+ Aniplex (Region B/2, Blu-ray & DVD)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|\n!
