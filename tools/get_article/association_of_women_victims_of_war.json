It has provided key testimony in rape and sexual abuse trials linked to the conflict and has helped obtain justice and financial and psychological assistance for many of its thousand-plus members.\nThe organisation's founder and president Bakira Hasečić is a Bosniak woman from Višegrad, in the Drina valley of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina.  She was herself a victim of the notorious war criminal Milan Lukić during the rape campaign that was a significant component of the ethnic cleansing of Višegrad in 1992.  Under Bakira Hasečić's leadership the association has become one of the most prominent human rights advocacy organisations in Bosnia, working with international human rights organisations such as Amnesty Internationalhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/bosnia-and-herzegovina-no-justice-rape-victims-20090721  and Human Rights Watch. The association has been prominent in campaigning for national and international courts to prosecute the crime of rape as a weapon of war.\nThe association's work has been featured in documentary programmes produced by the BBC and Al-Jazeera.\nSee also\n*Vilina Vlas\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Association of Women Victims of War / Udruzenje Žene-Žrtve Rata website [https://web.archive.org/web/20100224213719/http://www.zena-zrtva-rata.ba/news.php]\n* Investigation: \"Visegrad rape victimes say their cries go unheard, by Nidžara Ahmetašević, Nerma Jelačić and Selma Boračić (Višegrad and Sarajevo), BIRN [http://genocideinvisegrad.wordpress.com/2008/11/29/investigation-visegrad-rape-victimes-say-their-crie-go-unherd/]"
