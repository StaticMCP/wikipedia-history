It was released as a double A-side single alongside a new version of Richard's first hit \"Move It\" (featuring Queen guitarist Brian May).\nRichard had achieved a UK number one single in each of the previous five decades, but not one in the sixth decade. The promotional release spruiked the opportunity that \"Cliff has a great chance to make it to No 1 with this single - and it would ensure his record of No. 1 single in 6 consecutive decades becomes virtually unassailable.\" However, the single fell just short, reaching No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe track was not included on Richard's contemporaneous album release, ''Two's Company - The Duets'' (given it was not a duet), but was included on Richard's subsequent compilation albums, The 50th Anniversary Album (2008) and 75 at 75 (2015).\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2006)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|10\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Physical Singles (OCC)\n|1\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.45worlds.com/cdsingle/cd/nc571732eu Move It / 21st Century Christmas (promo edition)] at 45worlds\n* [http://www.cliffrichardsongs.com/cliffuksingles/index2.htm Cliff Richard - Single releases 1979 onwards]"
