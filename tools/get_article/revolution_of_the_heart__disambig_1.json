      "text": "# Revolution of the Heart__disambig_1\n\nRevolution Of The Heart is Howard Jones's eighth album, released in 2005. This album marked a return to the electronic production that featured on Jones' early albums. A number of promo singles were released - \"Just Look at You Now\" and \"Revolution of the Heart\". Notably, the album's lyrics are broadly influenced by Nichiren Buddhism which Jones began practicing in the early 90s. The album was released in a number of formats including a limited edition version sold through Jones' website which sold out quickly. A double disc was released in some territories which included a number of remixed tracks, while the Japanese edition contained some reworked versions of old hits as bonus tracks.\nTrack listing\n\"Slip Away\" is performed by Mohito featuring Howard Jones.\nPersonnel\n* Howard Jones – vocals, acoustic piano, Moog Prodigy, keyboard programming, producer\n* Robbie Bronnimann – virtual instruments, Macintosh computer, sound design, producer, mixing\n* Robin Boult – guitars\n* Shaz Sparks – backing vocals (1, 3, 4)\n* Mark \"Busk\" Conlin – vocals (3, 5) (Australian Bonus Disc)\n* Ian Walden – sleeve design, illustration, additional and image photography\n* Freddie Walker – cover photography\nReferences\n*"
