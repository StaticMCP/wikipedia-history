It was part of Jan Sobieski’s autumn expedition, aimed at the destruction of mounted Tatar units, which plundered southeastern provinces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nBattle\nIn early October 1672, Hetman Sobieski was stationed in Krasnystaw. On 5 October after finding out that several Tatar units were plundering the area of Zamość, he decided to destroy them. The main Tatar forces camped near Krasnobród, and during the night of October 5–6, Sobieski began a 52-kilometer march, which took place in a heavy rain.\nEarly the next morning, the Tatar camp was attacked by pro-Polish Cossacks, loyal to Mykhailo Khanenko. When the news of the skirmish reached Sobieski, he decided to intervene, arriving at the site of the battle after 30 minutes. Polish forces joined the fighting, while Khanenko himself left Krasnobród and headed to Zamosc. Several Tatar units were destroyed, and some 2,500 Polish civilians captured by the invaders were freed and sent to Zamosc.\nReferences\n*"
