The design is modified compared to earlier ships of the same class, and slightly larger than , at .\nThe ship's name was announced by Cunard on 10 October 2007. Since the retirement of  in 2008 the company has operated four vessels. The naming of the ship as Queen Elizabeth brings about a situation similar to that between 1940 and 1948, when Cunard's original Queen Elizabeth was in service at the same time as the Royal Navy battleship .\nDesign\nExterior\nQueen Elizabeth is similar in design to Queen Victoria; however, the steeper stern allowed a slightly higher passenger capacity of up to 2,058 compared to Queen Victorias 2,014.\nAlso unlike many previous Cunard Queens, Queen Elizabeth is not a true ocean liner as she does not have the heavy plating throughout the hull. However, the bow was constructed with heavier plating to cope with the transatlantic run, and the ship has a high freeboard.\nInterior\nAlthough having an almost identical interior arrangement to Queen Victoria, the decor is very different. The ship is a tribute to the two previous Queen Elizabeth-named ships: the original  and Queen Elizabeth 2. She also evokes the era of the 1930s, in which Cunard's first Queen Elizabeth was launched, with many art deco interior touches. The ship also features a Britannia Club section of the main restaurant, which is a feature on , but not available on Queen Victoria. This service allows passengers in the Britannia staterooms to have single seating dining arrangements, without having to upgrade to the more expensive Grills classes.  The sliding roof over the Winter Garden featured on Queen Victoria is replaced with a simple glass roof with the space being renamed the Garden Lounge.\nLaunch\nFollowing the ship's construction in Italy from 2007 to 2010, Cunard Line officially confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II would name Cunard's new ship. The ceremony was held in Southampton on 11 October 2010 before the ship set sail on her maiden voyage to the Canary Islands the following day. Queen Elizabeth II was also the sponsor of the now-retired Queen Elizabeth 2 in 1967 and Cunard's current flagship, Queen Mary 2, in 2004.\nService history\nThe first master of Queen Elizabeth was Captain Christopher Wells. On 4 October 2010 Queen Elizabeth was formally handed over to Cunard. She sailed on her maiden voyage from Southampton on 12 October 2010, following a naming ceremony with the monarch on 11 October 2010.\nOn 13 January 2011, two years after the first Cunard Royal Rendezvous, RMS Queen Mary 2 met up with Queen Victoria and the then brand new Queen Elizabeth for another Royal Rendezvous in New York City. Both Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth made an Atlantic crossing in tandem for the event. All three Cunarders met in front of the Statue of Liberty at 6:45 pm for a Grucci fireworks display. The Empire State Building was lit up in red to mark the event. At the end of October 2011 Queen Elizabeth and her fleet mates were registered to Hamilton, Bermuda, in order to host weddings aboard.\nOn 5 June 2012 all three 'Queens' met once more, but this time in Southampton in order to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

However, she was not scheduled to visit Svalbard in her 2013 schedule. Legislation relating to cruise ships visiting the archipelago (applicable from 2014) meant that Queen Elizabeth will never be able to visit again. On 15 July 2012 both Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary 2 visited Hamburg for the first time together.\nOn 12 March 2013 the cruise ship passed the former Cunard liner , then a hotel in Long Beach, California, for the first time along with fireworks display.

Frost had been invited to give a speech by Cunard whilst travelling on board the ship.\nOn 1 March 2014 Queen Elizabeth sailed into Sydney Harbour displaying a 126-metres long rainbow 'Happy Mardi Gras' banner from her top decks in tribute to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.\nOn 9 May 2014 both Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria led Queen Mary 2 up the Southampton channel in single file, with both ships docking in a bow to bow formation performing a birthday salute to Queen Mary 2. Later on, all three Cunarders gathered for a fireworks display during which Queen Mary 2 led both Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria back down the channel.\nOn 20 December 2014 Queen Elizabeth on a four night cruise was unable to dock in Amsterdam due to stormy conditions and was forced to circle in the English channel before returning to Southampton early.\nIn April 2015 while visiting Sihanoukville, Cambodia a passenger died on the Queen Elizabeth following an accident whilst boarding from a tender.\nThree Queens: Cunard's 175th anniversary\nOn 25 May 2015 the three 'Queens' were positioned at Liverpool celebrating 175 years of the formation of the Cunard Line, which was formed and based in the city. At low tide, the three ships stopped in line in middle of the River Mersey, bow to stern, turned 180 degrees in full synchronisation with each other, which was known as the \"river dance\", they then formed an arrow side by side. Queen Mary 2 was in the centre with its bow in line with the Cunard Building at the Pier Head. The Royal Air Force's display team, the Red Arrows, performed a flypast in Vic formation, emitting red, white and blue smoke, over the vessels. An estimated 1.3 million people lined the river banks to witness the spectacle.\nOn 13 August 2016 Queen Elizabeth made the 2,500th cruise ship call at Kiel, Germany.\nQE2 50th Anniversary Celebration\nIn September 2017 the ship hosted a special commemorative cruise to honour the 50th anniversary of its predecessor QE2.

On 15 January 2023, adverse weather offshore from Tauranga prevented safe hull cleaning and the ship was prevented from visiting the Bay of Islands.\nIn February 2023, after extensive consultation with New Zealand authorities, it was stipulated that additional work was required in advance of visiting any New Zealand destinations, which was not possible.  The planned cruise to New Zealand was replaced with visits to Australian ports. Having completed the Australian cruise season the Queen Elizabeth sailed for Singapore via Bali and Jakarta.
