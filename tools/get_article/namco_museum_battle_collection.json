It is the first Namco Museum title since the original PlayStation series to be developed in Japan. It includes 21 games - four of these are brand-new \"arrangement\" remakes of older Namco games, while the rest are emulated ports of Namco arcade games from the 1970s and 1980s. These ports include an options menu that allows the player to modify the in-game settings, such as the screen orientation and number of lives. Players can send one-level demos to a friend's console via the \"Game Sharing\" option in the main menu.\nBattle Collection was the first PlayStation Portable game to make use of the system's game sharing function. The Japanese version of the game, simply titled Namco Museum, was split into two different volumes; the second volume includes three games not found in international releases, these being Dragon Spirit and two new \"arrangement\" games based on Pac-Man and Motos.\nBattle Collection was met with a positive response from critics; reviewers applauded the large library of games, emulation quality and multiplayer features, but criticized the Game Sharing option, which many deemed \"useless\", and the game requiring a firmware update to boot. In Japan, the first game sold 79,572 copies in its first week of release.\nGames\nNamco Museum Battle Collection includes a total of 21 games; 17 of these are ports of Namco arcade games from the 1970s and 1980s, including Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga. They encompass several different game genres, such as maze, shoot'em up and platform. Each of the arcade game ports allow the player to modify the in-game settings, such as the number of lives and screen orientation, as well as access to a sound test and autosave feature. A \"Game Sharing\" option can be accessed from the main menu, allowing the player to send one-level demos to a friend's PSP system. Alongside the arcade games, four new \"Arrangement\" games have been included, which are new to this collection. These games include 3D graphics and incorporate new features, such as power-ups, new stages, world maps and boss fights. Despite their similar name, they share nothing in common with the \"Arrangement\" games found in both Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1 and Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|+Games included in Namco Museum Battle Collection\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" | Arrangement games\n|-\n!Title\n!Genre\n!Release date\n!Vol. (Japan)\n|-\n|Pac-Man Arrangement\n|Maze\n|2005\n|1\n|-\n|Galaga Arrangement\n|Fixed shooter\n|2005\n|1\n|-\n|Dig Dug Arrangement\n|Maze\n|2005\n|1\n|-\n|New Rally-X Arrangement\n|Maze\n|2005\n|1\n|-\n|Motos Arrangement\n|Platform\n|2006\n|2\n|-\n|Pac-Man Arrangement Plus\n|Maze\n|2006\n|2\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" | Arcade games\n|-\n!Title\n!Genre\n!Original release\n!Vol. (Japan)\n|-\n|Galaxian\n|Fixed shooter\n|1979\n|1\n|-\n|Pac-Man\n|Maze\n|1980\n|1\n|-\n|Rally-X\n|Maze\n|1980\n|1\n|-\n|King & Balloon\n|Fixed shooter\n|1980\n|2\n|-\n|Galaga\n|Fixed shooter\n|1981\n|1\n|-\n|Bosconian\n|Multi-directional shooter\n|1981\n|2\n|-\n|New Rally-X\n|Maze\n|1981\n|1\n|-\n|Ms. Pac-Man\n|Maze\n|1982\n|1\n|-\n|Dig Dug\n|Maze\n|1982\n|1\n|-\n|Xevious\n|Vertical-scrolling shooter\n|1983\n|2\n|-\n|Mappy\n|Platform\n|1983\n|2\n|-\n|The Tower of Druaga\n|Role-playing\n|1984\n|2\n|-\n|Grobda\n|Multi-directional shooter\n|1984\n|2\n|-\n|Dragon Buster\n|Action role-playing\n|1985\n|2\n|-\n|Dig Dug II\n|Platform\n|1985\n|2\n|-\n|Motos\n|Platform\n|1985\n|2\n|-\n|Rolling Thunder\n|Run'n gun\n|1987\n|2\n|-\n|Dragon Spirit\n|Vertical-scrolling shooter\n|1987\n|2\n|-\n|}\n}}\nPorts\nThe Pac-Man Arrangement, Galaga Arrangement, and Dig Dug Arrangement games were featured in the 2008 compilation title Namco Museum Virtual Arcade, and were also ported to iOS under the names Pac-Man Remix, Galaga Remix, and Dig Dug Remix in 2009. Galaga Remix and Dig Dug Remix include the original arcade versions of Galaga and Dig Dug. Pac-Man Arrangement was featured in the 2014 compilation title Pac-Man Museum. All ports lack the 2 player modes found in the original games.\nAs of 2018, Pac-Man Remix, Galaga Remix and Dig Dug Remix have been delisted from the App Store and are no longer available for download. Additionally, the games do not run on devices running iOS 11 and higher as the system has dropped support for 32-bit apps. Pac-Man Museum has been delisted from all digital storefronts as of 2020.\nPac-Man Arrangement (labelled as Pac-Man Arrangement CS Ver. to distinguish itself from the 1996 game) is included in Pac-Man Museum+ as an unlockable title, released in 2022.\nReception\n| MC = 73/100\n| 1UP = B+\n| IGN = 7.5/10\n| GSpot = 7.5/10\n| GSpy =\n}}\nNamco Museum Battle Collection was met with a mostly positive critical reception.
