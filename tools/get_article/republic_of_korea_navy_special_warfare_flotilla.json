The WARFLOT is most commonly referred to as the Underwater Demolition Team or UDT, and sometimes as UDT/SEALs, coming from the fact UDTs are the most prominent branch of the flotilla and their close ties with US Navy SEALs respectively.\nThe UDT/SEALs under WARFLOT are heavily influenced and inspired by the United States Navy SEALs/Underwater Demolition Team/Special Boat Teams, which initially provided funding and expertise in the unit's creation, and still maintain a strong relationship by regularly undertaking joint combined exchange training (JCET) several times a year, utilizing American helicopter and maritime assets, and enrolling students each year in the U.S. Naval Special Warfare programs at Naval Special Warfare Center such as Naval Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training School and Special Missions Training Center school.\nOrganization\n, from Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit (EODMU) 5]]\nNaval Special Warfare Flotilla - headquartered in Jinhae:\n*Special Mission Squadrons - established January  1st, 2023\n**Counter-Terrorism Unit (CT)\n**Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit (EOD)\n**Naval Pre-Operation Unit\n*Naval Special Warfare Group (UDT/SEAL)\n**1st Battalion\n**3rd Battalion\n**5th Battalion\n**Special Warfare Education and Training Battalion\n*Sea Salvage & Rescue Unit (SSU)\n*Operational Support Battalion\n*Special Boat Unit\n*Duty Support Squadron\nApplicants and selection\nThe Special Warfare Troops (SWF) teams take applicants among conscripts, petty officers, and officers. Most petty officers and all conscripts now apply before basic training while officers apply after commissioning (NA, ROTC, or OCS), completion of Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS), and after they have been assigned to a ship. The BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL School) selection process is inspired by and similar to the U.S. Navy SEAL program, consisting of physical and mental challenges, such as Hell Week. The completion rate has been known to dip under 10% and usually hovers between 30 and 40%, leading to manpower problems as the unit continues to expand and has an increasing number of foreign commitments. Between 2010 and 2012 the completion rate was unusually high at 78.4%, which coincided with the unit's expansion.\nSince 2010, most washouts have been retained as support personnel and equipment maintenance staff. Those who survive the first ten weeks are trained in open and closed circuit diving, demolition, land warfare and tactics before receiving the special warfare pin. It also includes learning to fight in close quarters under Multi UDT/SEAL Assaulting Tactics (MUSAT) training.\nA SEAL/UDT team is made up of seven soldiers: a point man, a platoon leader, a communication expert, a machine gunner, a grenadier, an assistant leader, and rear security. Basic UDT/SEAL training is 10 weeks long for enlisted men and 20 to 26 weeks long for NCO and officers.\nHistory\nOrigins\nUnderwater Demolition Unit (UDU) was officially established in 1954. Its parent organization was formed in September, 1948 when the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps set up a secret spy unit in Korea. In 1955 the unit was renamed UDU, short for Underwater Demolitions Unit. Its primary missions were infiltrating into North Korea, kidnapping or assassinating key officials, destroying key structures, resupplying agents, demolishing transportation infrastructures, reconnaissance, wiretapping communications of the North Korean army and attacking military targets in the North.\nUnderwater Demolition Unit (UDU)\nThe SWF (also known in popular culture as the ROKN UDT/SEALs) were involved in reconnaissance missions in North Korea until 1980 when a number of operators were broken away to form the UDU intelligence unit. The UDU (Underwater Demolition Unit) evolved into black ops clandestine unit under the cover name of a Navy unit. More than 300 UDU personnel were killed in over 200 missions into North Korea from 1948 until 1971, including missions with allies that included the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. However, only a list of about 150 names has been obtained by UDU, because of a fire at the unit in 1961 which burned all the data.\nSpecial Warfare Flotilla\nIn 1968, the Explosives Disposal Unit (EOD) was established and in 1993 the SWF were tasked with standing up a maritime counter-terrorism unit, which up until that point was the responsibility of the Army's 707th Special Mission Group. In the late 1990s, the main focus was on defense of the coast from frequent attempts by the North to infiltrate agents into the South using midget submarines. As of January 1, 2009, the Special Forces were reorganized again, and the Ship Salvage Unit (SSU) was subordinated to the 5th Battalion.\nJune 23, 1968 incident\nFifteen South Korean secret agents, a team of three and two teams of six, were sent to the North on a mission to seize a North Korean naval vessel and to kidnap a key officer. But the mission failed because of miscommunication among the South Korean vessels and the commander's misjudgment. It was about 2a.m. when the three South Korean vessels approached the bay from the Yellow Sea and met wired obstacles on the water, which made navigating harder. Without warning, the North Korean Navy started an attack that apparently killed six agents. The other nine South Korean agents returned safely to the South.\n1996 Gangneung submarine incident\nSWF were involved in the 1996 Gangneung submarine infiltration incident caused by North Korean agents, on a mission to spy on the naval installations in the area and then return. The submarine made a failed attempt to collect the team on the 17th, and returned the following day. The submarine, however, ran aground in the attempt, and all efforts to try to make her free were in vain. A 49-day-long manhunt ensued, from 18 September through 5 November, resulting in the capture or elimination of all the crew and members of the reconnaissance team, except one, who is believed to have made it back to North Korea. Four civilians and 12 ROK soldiers (eight by firefight and four accidental) died; 27 soldiers were wounded.\n1998 Sokcho submarine incident\nIn 1998 the unit was involved in the recovery and search of a North Korean Yono-class submarine that had been accidentally snared in fishing nets near Sokcho, Gangwon Province. A South Korean fishing boat observed several submarine crewmen trying to untangle the submarine from the fishing net. The fishing boat notified the Republic of Korea Navy and a corvette towed the submarine with the crew still inside to a navy base at the port of Donghae. The submarine sank as it was being towed into port, it was unclear if this was as a result of damage or a deliberate scuttling by the crew.\nAnti-piracy operations\nSince 2009, the SWF have formed the core of the Cheonghae anti-piracy task group deployed to the coast of Somalia.  In the early morning of January 22, 2011, as part of Operation Dawn of Gulf of Aden, 15 SWF operators boarded the 11,000-ton chemical freighter Samho Jewelry which was taken by 13 pirates 6 days prior; 21 sailors had been held hostages. ROKS Choi-Young, a 4600-ton destroyer, dispatched its SWF team at 4:58am along with a Lynx helicopter which then circled the ship and fired machine guns to distract the pirates. The boarding party of 15 SWF killed 8 pirates and captured 5 without taking any casualties after 3 hours of intense firefighting. All 21 hostages were secured, with one hostage suffering a non-fatal gunshot wound to the abdomen.\nSinking of the MV Sewol\nSWF provided 114 men that took part in the recovery operation during the sinking of the MV Sewol, during which 304, mostly high school students, perished.\nCultural depictions\nSteel Troops, dubbed a \"military survival program\", features male South Korean reservists who served in various special forces units across different branches of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.\nThe Soldiers seeks to find the \"best special forces operator in the world\", beginning with selecting the best Korean special forces representatives through a series of missions.\nSee also\n* Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command\n* 707th Special Mission Group\n* 13th Special Mission Brigade\n* United States Navy SEALs\n* Naval Special Warfare Development Group\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://udtseal.or.kr/ Official Site]\n* [http://www.businessinsider.com/south-korean-special-forces-knife-training-2016-2 flotilla soldiers knife training]"
