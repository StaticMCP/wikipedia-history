It was originally built to house artifacts discovered in a burial site on the nearby islet of Rheneia, dating back to 425/426 BC. The museum’s collection includes pottery, funerary urns, and sculptures from the Cycladic, Geometric, and Classical periods, reflecting the island’s archaeological and maritime heritage.\nThe original Neoclassical building underwent refurbishments and expansions in the 1930s and 1960s and the large eastern room was added in 1972. The museum contains artefacts from the neighbouring island Rhenia, including 9th- to 8th-century BC ceramic pottery from the Cyclades and 7th- to 6th-century BC works from other areas in the Aegean. Its most famous item is the large vase produced in Tinos, showing scenes from the fall of Troy.\nGallery\nFile:Frying Pan 0502304.jpg|Early Cycladic pottery, 2800-2300 BC\nFile:Mykmm201.jpg|Donkey vase, orientalizing style, probably from Sifnos, 700-650 BC\nFile:Mykmm206.jpg|Large relief pithos, capture of Troy, 675-650 BC\nFile:Mykmm229.jpg|Large relief pithos, capture of Troy, detail, 675-650 BC\nFile:Mykon M Mykmm233.jpg|Melian amphora, a girl with earring, 625-600 BC\nFile:Mykmm205.jpg|Kouros as a handle, archaic small bronze, 560-540 BC\nFile:Mykon M 0502311.jpg|Pelike, sales of oil, Eucharidés painter, 520-500 BC\nFile:Mykon M 0502309.jpg|Amphora, Dionysus and menade, Shuvalov Painter, 450-425 BC\nFile:Mykon M 060340.jpg|Heracles, Parakastri, Roman copy of a classical Attic work\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081005111400/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh151.jsp?obj_id=3301 Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism]\n*"
