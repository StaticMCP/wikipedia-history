Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple is considered the original abode of the god.\nThis temple is more than 700 years old.\nDeities\nShiva is the temple's presiding deity. Although his consort Parvati has no idol, she is said to be ever-present in the Sanctum. The deity is called Gowri Shankara (lit. \"Shiva with Parvati\"). A Sanctum for Sastha is within the Chuttambalam. Ganesha (Ganapati), the serpent gods and Krishna dwell outside the Chuttambalam. Many devotees argue that the idol worshipped as Bhootathan is actually a Yakshi. Hanuman (Anjaneya) and Murugan (Kartikeya), both carved on pillars near the flagmast, receive worship. All the deities face east.\nAdjacent to the shrine of Ganapati stands an idol of Goddess Parashakti who was worshiped in a nearby Kalari. In the Kalari she was worshipped with 'makaara panchakam' in the Shakteya Sampradaya.\nLegend\nAs per legend, an old woman sweeper of Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple distinguished the Swyambhoo (self manifested) Shiva Linga idol while she was resting at this place. She got 'Darshan' (vision) of Shiva at the spot.\nMain Offerings\nMany devotees attend the Nirmalya Darshan.\nMritunjaya Homam, Mrityunjaya archana, Jaladhara, Pinvilakku and Kuvala mala samarpanam are the most popular offerings made to Shiva.\nGanapathy Homam, Mrithyunjaya Homam, Mrithyunjayarchana, Abhishekam, Dhara, Pushpabhishekam, Neerajanam, Venna Charthu for AnjaneyaSwamy, Ashtothararchana, Sahasranamarchana, Nateshalankaram.\nFestivals\nThe annual festival lasts for ten days and will be celebrated  in the Malayalam month Dhanu (Dec-Jan).
