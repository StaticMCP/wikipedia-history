Members agree that small arms proliferation must be countered by responsible legal domestic sales and foreign cooperation in reducing illicit arms trafficking. Participation is open to any organization that supports its objectives.\nSee also\n* Small Arms and Light Weapons\nExternal links\n* [https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/sawg.htm Official webpage]"
