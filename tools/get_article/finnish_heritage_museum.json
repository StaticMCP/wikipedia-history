Museum staff archive Finnish and Finnish-American history through collection, preservation, and exhibition of special books, documents, records and artifacts.  Such items are acquired, or documented, for their value in Finnish and Finnish-American history, biography, genealogy, commerce and folklore.\nThe museum recently acquired the building that once served as the town hall, police department and fire station. Work to renovate the building, which was suffering from structural deficiencies and other problems, began in the fall of 2006. The museum opened on June 30, 2007.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
