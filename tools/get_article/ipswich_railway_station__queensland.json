It serves the urban centre of Ipswich.\nHistory\nThe first railway station opened in Ipswich in 1865. It was the first railway station built in Queensland, as the first terminus for the 34 kilometre section of the Main line from Grandchester. In 1887, the station was completely rebuilt.\nTwo pieces of associated historic railway infrastructure are the:\n* Railway Signal Cabin and Turntable which enabled trains to be turned onto different railway lines\n* Bremer River Rail Bridge which connected the station to the North Ipswich Railway Workshops\nThe cabin, turnable, rail bridge and railway workshops are all listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\nThe now-closed Dugandan railway line split from the Main Line railway at Ipswich.\nIn 1978, a large office and retail complex (currently known as Ipswich Central Plaza) was built above the station and spanning both sides of Bell Street following the sale of the air rights. On 20 September 1980, the line was electrified from Darra. The last remaining old platform and buildings were demolished in 1985.\nServices\nIpswich is served mainly by trains to and from Caboolture and Nambour, and is the terminus for the Rosewood shuttles. Some inbound services originate from Rosewood in the morning on-peak, and some outbound services continue to Rosewood in the afternoon peak.\nThe Caboolture and Nambour trains outside of peak times typically stop all stations to Bowen Hills, then run express from Bowen Hills to Petrie, stopping only at Eagle Junction and Northgate. During weekday morning on-peak times, the trains also run express from Darra to Milton, stopping only at Indooroopilly. Some weekday services continue past Petrie to Kippa-Ring instead of Caboolture or Nambour.\nDuring morning on-peak times (6:00 am – 8:30 am, Monday to Friday), city bound services depart every six minutes at best, and during afternoon peak times (3:30 pm – 7:00 pm, Monday to Friday), terminating services arrive every 12 minutes at best. During off-peak times, Caboolture and Nambour services depart and arrive at half hourly intervals, with every second train being met by a Rosewood shuttle train. Weekday morning on-peak express services take 50 minutes to reach Central, and 58 minutes to reach Central on an off-peak all-stations service.\nIpswich is also served by Queensland Rail Travel's twice weekly Westlander service travelling between Brisbane and Charleville.\nServices by platform\nThe station has two island platforms. One (Platforms 3 and 4) is usually only used during peak periods.\nServices by platform\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0.5em; \"\n|-\n!Platform\n!Line\n!Destinations\n!Express\n!Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=background:#008851|Ipswich and Rosewood\n|Bowen Hills, Caboolture & Nambour\n| Darra to Milton, stopping at Indooroopilly (morning peak only), and from Bowen Hills to Petrie railway station, stopping at Eagle Junction and Northgate\n|\n|-\n|Kippa-Ring\n|Bowen Hills to Northgate, stopping at Eagle Junction\n|Three weekday afternoon services only\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=background:#008851|Ipswich and Rosewood\n|Rosewood\n|\n|Most weekday and all weekend services\n|-\n||Caboolture\n|Darra to Milton, stopping at Indooroopilly (morning peak only), and from Bowen Hills to Petrie railway station, stopping at Eagle Junction and Northgate\n|Two weekday morning services to Caboolture only\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=background:#008851|Ipswich and Rosewood\n|Rosewood\n|\n|Some morning and afternoon peak services only\n|-\n|Bowen Hills, Caboolture & Nambour\n|Darra to Milton, stopping at Indooroopilly (morning peak only), and from Bowen Hills to Petrie railway station, stopping at Eagle Junction and Northgate\n|Some morning & afternoon peak services\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=background:#008851|Ipswich and Rosewood\n|Bowen Hills, Caboolture & Nambour\n|Darra to Milton, stopping at Indooroopilly (morning peak only), and from Bowen Hills to Petrie railway station, stopping at Eagle Junction and Northgate\n|Some morning & afternoon peak services\n|-\n|Kippa-Ring\n|Bowen Hills to Northgate, stopping at Eagle Junction\n|One morning and One afternoon service only\n|-\n|}\nTransport links\nWestside Bus Company operates nine bus routes from the Bell Street bus station, directly adjacent to Ipswich station:\n*500: Riverlink Shopping Centre to Goodna\n*502: Bundamba to Riverlink Shopping Centre via Blackstone\n*503: Bundamba to Riverlink Shopping Centre via Eastern Heights\n*506: Riverlink Shopping Centre to Leichardt & One Mile\n*509: Yamanto to Riverlink Shopping Centre\n*512: Brassall to Riverlink Shopping Centre\n*514: Moores Pocket to Booval\n*515: Brassall to Yamanto & Willowbank\n*529: to Toogoolawah via Lowood\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150216152314/http://www.queenslandrail.com.au/AllStations/Pages/AllStations.aspx?StationName=Ipswich Ipswich station] Queensland Rail\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080721234213/http://qroti.com/placeinfo/qld/rail/ipswich/ Ipswich station] Queensland's Railways on the Internet\n*[ Ipswich station] Translink travel information"
