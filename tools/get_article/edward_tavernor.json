In 1626, he was elected Member of Parliament for Woodstock. He was re-elected MP for Woodstock in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles dispensed with parliament for eleven years. His name appears in the Calendar of State Papers receiving reimbursement for royal expenses at this time. He was Secretary to the Lord Chamberlain, Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, in December 1630, and was still held the post in 1637.\nReferences"
