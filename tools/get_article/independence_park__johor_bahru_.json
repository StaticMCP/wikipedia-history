These murals and landmarks are references to events celebrating the struggle for independence, the independence itself and thus, self-determination from the British colonial power.\nHistory\nThe park was officially launched in 2011 as a community recreational park.\nThe park was studied in 2020 by the University of Malaysia as a case study on the use of urban green spaces in Malaysia. The study found, among other things, that most visitors went there to \"de-stress\" and felt safe there. The park is used much more in the morning and most visitors drive there, both presumably due to the \"hot and humid tropical climate\".\nGeography\nIndependence Park spans over an area of . It has a lake in the center of it. The lake is full of water lilies on the water's surface, however the water is brownish in most places. The park also contains an open-air auditorium, which has musical performances on weekends. A pool for kids is also located here, as well as a mini English park called Laman Peringatan Sultan Abu Bakar (translated as Sultan Abu Bakar Memorial Lawn).\nThe other locations around the park include a jogging circuit, a mini square lined with flags of the state of Johor, and a watch tower.\nEvents\nA celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration of the City was held there in 2014.\nThe park is commonly used for community events, such as breast cancer support walk attended by 1200 in 2012 and over one thousand for a World Walking Day event, also in 2012\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://cj.my/92626/new-exercise-equipment-at-taman-merdeka-johor-bahru/ New exercise equipment at Taman Merdeka, Johor Bahru - Citizens Journal]\n*[https://visit2020.amirazrael.com/destinations/tamanmerdeka/ Taman Merdeka Johor Bahru – Visit Malaysia 2020]\n*[https://travelmalaysia.me/taman-merdeka-johor-bahru Taman Merdeka Johor Bahru - Park - Johor Bahru | TravelMalaysia]\n*[https://www.petitgo.com/listing_display?listingid=399 Merdeka Park (Taman Merdeka) Johor]"
