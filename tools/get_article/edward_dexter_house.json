It is a -story wood-frame structure, built in 1795–1797, with a hip roof topped by a square monitor. Its main facade is five bays wide, with the center bay flanked by two-story pilasters and topped by a small gable pediment. The well-preserved interior provided a template for an early-20th-century museum space designed by the Rhode Island School of Design to house a furniture collection donated by the house's then-owner, Charles Pendleton. The house is one of the few 18th-century houses in the city's College Hill neighborhood. It was originally located at the corner of George and Prospect Streets; in 1860 it was sawed in half and moved in sections to its present location.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\nGallery\nFile:Edward Dexter House, Waterman Street.jpg|The house, circa 1915\nFile:Edward Dexter House, North Side of Waterman Street.jpg|The house in 1918, following an addition to the building's rear\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
