LSM is one of the standard methods for announcing a new software release for Linux.\nFile format\nIf a Linux program is to be distributed widely, an LSM file may be created to describe the program, normally in a file called software_package_name.lsm.  This file begins with  and ends with . It has one field on each line. The field name is separated from the value by a colon (:). Mandatory fields are Title, Version, Entered-date, Description, Author and Primary-site.\nExample\nHere is a what a blank LSM template looks like, at time of writing:\nBegin4\nTitle:\nVersion:\nEntered-date:\nDescription:\nKeywords:\nAuthor:\nMaintained-by:\nPrimary-site:\nAlternate-site:\nOriginal-site:\nPlatforms:\nCopying-policy:\nEnd\nDatabase\nThe collective database of LSM entries can be searched in order to locate software of a particular type.  This database has passed through various owners.  It was created by Jeff Kopmanis, Lars Wirzenius maintained it for a while, and now the current maintainer is Aaron Schrab (with help from volunteers).\nThe database can be downloaded in its entirety, or one can perform limited queries using a web interface.\nAs of August 2022, the LSM index is still automatically updated by a e-mail robot. However, the maintainer of man-db eventually decided to stop maintaining its LSM data due to the perceived obsolescence of LSM.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/LSM-TEMPLATE.html LSM template version 4] on ibiblio.org\n*[http://lsm.qqx.org/lsm/LSM.gz Entire LSM Database]\n*[http://www.ibiblio.org/linsearch/index.html Simple LSM Search] on ibiblio.org\n*[http://www.ibiblio.org/linsearch/index.html Advanced LSM Search] on ibiblio.org\n*[http://lsm.execpc.com/lsm/ Instructions for New Entries]"
