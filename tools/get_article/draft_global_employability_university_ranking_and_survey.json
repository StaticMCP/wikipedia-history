It was created by the French HR consultancy Emerging and is published in exclusivity with the Tims Higher Education (THE) since 2015.. GEURS is distinctive in that it is based exclusively on insights from employers worldwide to identify the universities that best prepare future-ready graduates for the evolving demands of the global workforce. Each year, the ranking reveals [https://www.emerging.fr/geurs/ranking the world’s top 250 universities for graduate employability] according to global recruiters’ assessments. The purpose of GEURS is to inform students, universities, and employers about how institutions are performing in preparing students for the workforce, providing a unique lens on educational outcomes that complement traditional academic rankings.\nHistory and development\nGEURS originated in 2010 as one of the first cross-border employability rankings of universities. The inaugural edition was launched in 2011 (then called the Global Employability Survey) and featured the top 150 universities for employability, as selected by about 100 major employers and HR leaders from 10 countries. This first ranking gained international attention through coverage in the International Herald Tribune (the global edition of The New York Times), reflecting early global interest in comparing universities by graduate outcomes.\nOver the next few years (2012–2014), the ranking’s scope and methodology evolved. It continued to be published in the International New York Times and expanded its survey to employers in 25 countries. By 2014, the project adopted its current name, Global Employability University Ranking and Survey (GEURS), and enlarged its listing from 150 to 250 universities worldwide. The pool of respondents grew ultimately reaching over 13,000 employers by the mid-2020s. This period also marked a turning point in refining the survey’s format and influence.\nIn November 2015, Emerging partnered with Times Higher Education to co-publish and promote the GEURS. Ten years later, this editorial partnership remains, while THE ensures international visibility through its platform, Emerging remains the sole owner of GEURS and fully responsible for its methodology, content, and data. The collaboration underscored the rising importance of employability as a facet of university performance, alongside traditional measures. From this point on, GEURS results have been released annually via THE’s channels, bringing greater visibility and credibility, and often referred to as the “THE/Emerging Global Employability Ranking.”\nMethodological enhancements were introduced in subsequent years. In 2018, Emerging developed a more comprehensive analytical framework for GEURS. Drawing on nearly a decade of data, the team identified key “drivers of employability”:  around 35 indicators grouped into six major categories (or drivers) to interpret the results, including areas such as academic excellence, work experience, graduate skills, international outlook, digital capabilities, leadership, and sustainability. This framework enabled more granular insights into why certain institutions rank highly, and it provided universities with feedback on specific areas of strength or weakness in employability preparation. By 2019, an independent evaluation by the German institute [https://www.trendence.com/ Trendence] (a specialist in employer studies) found that GEURS had become the most consulted university ranking by employers globally, highlighting its growing influence in the corporate and education sectors.\nIn 2020, Emerging launched a related ranking called “[https://www.emerging.fr/digital-leaders Digital Leaders in Higher Education]” focusing on universities’ performance in digital skills and innovation – an offshoot inspired by one of the GEURS employability drivers. In 2023, the [https://www.emerging.fr/geurs-radar GEURS Radar] was introduced to spotlight high-potential institutions beyond the top 250, using the driver-based matrix to identify emerging contenders in employability. By 2024 (the 15th anniversary of GEURS), Emerging further leveraged its insights to create an [https://www.emerging.fr/emerging-labels Employability Quality Label] to universities that demonstrate outstanding commitment to graduate employability. These developments reflect how GEURS has evolved from a simple ranking into a broader initiative for benchmarking and improving how universities prepare students for careers\nMethodology\nGEURS’s methodology is unique among global university rankings in that it is entirely survey-based, drawing on employers’ direct opinions rather than academic metrics or university-reported data. The ranking is produced through a multi-step process each year, managed by Emerging in collaboration with professional polling partners. The process can be summarized in four key stages:\n# Employer survey (expectations): in the first stage, thousands of employers worldwide are surveyed about the skills and qualities they prioritize in graduates. They provide insight into current and future challenges in recruitment and what they expect from higher education in terms of graduate preparation. This qualitative input helps shape the context of the ranking each year (for example, gauging whether employers are putting more emphasis on digital literacy, leadership, adaptability, etc.).\n# Employer voting (university selection): in the second stage, the surveyed employers participate in a voting process. Each respondent (all of whom are qualified to hire managers or executives with experience recruiting young graduates) is presented with a list of over 1,000 universities worldwide and asked to rate which institutions they believe produce the most employable graduates. Each employer can cast up to 10 votes, for universities they are familiar with and regard highly in terms of graduate employability. Notably, employers can vote both for institutions in their own country and internationally, reflecting a global perspective. This voting methodology means the ranking is essentially a popularity poll among employers, akin to a reputation survey focused specifically on graduate job readiness.\n# Aggregation of the TOP 250: after voting, Emerging aggregates the results to determine the overall ranking. The 250 universities receiving the highest number of votes form the published ranking for that year. In effect, inclusion in the GEURS top 250 is a “stamp of approval” by employers at scale. The ranking is not weighted by any secondary data; it is a straightforward count of employer votes (though measures are in place to ensure diverse sampling and prevent any single country or sector from dominating the vote). The threshold for making the top 250 can be competitive: in the 2025 edition, for example, over 1,000 institutions received mentions, but only the highest-ranked quarter of those appeared in the final list.\n# Analysis of criteria: in a final survey step, employers are asked to justify their choices by rating the selected universities on various criteria related to employability. In GEURS reports, Emerging highlights which drivers are most associated with the top-ranked universities, and how employer priorities shift year to year.\nComparison with other global university rankings\nIn the landscape of international university rankings, GEURS occupies a distinct niche due to its exclusive focus on employability as judged by employers. Most well-known rankings, use a broad set of indicators primarily related to academic excellence and research performance. For example, some factors in academic peer reputation, faculty-student ratios, research citations, and internationalization metrics, with only a small portion (around 10%) of its score coming from an employer reputation survey. By contrast, GEURS is 100% based on employer input, without any academic reputation survey or bibliometric data in the mix. It asks employers directly “which universities produce the best graduates?” rather than inferring quality from research output or student grades.\nIt’s useful to compare GEURS with some specific rankings and measures to provide a more comprehensive perspective to inform stakeholder decisions.\nReferences"
