The project was the brainchild of Snider, who \"wanted to take his songwriting sensibility, material by people he thinks have written what he calls “perfect songs,” and sort of collide them into the jamband sensibility.\"\nThe album was recorded at Bob Weir's TRI Studios in San Rafael, CA in 2013. Schools and Snider split the production duties, while John Keane handled the mixing.  Hard Working Americans was initially released on January 21, 2014 on Thirty Tigers/Melvin Records.\nCritical reception\nHard Working Americans received generally favorable reviews from critics.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n:Todd Snider - Vocals\n:Dave Schools - Bass\n:Neal Casal - Guitar, Vocals\n:Chad Staehly - Keyboards\n:Duane Trucks - Drums\nAdditional Musicians\n:John Popper - Harmonica\n:Jason Crosby - Fiddle, Piano\n:John Keane - Banjo, Guitar, Vocals\nReferences"
