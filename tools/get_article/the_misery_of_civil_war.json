      "text": "# The Misery of Civil War\n\nThe Misery of Civil War is a 1680 tragedy by the English writer John Crowne. It was originally staged by the Duke's Company at the Dorset Garden Theatre in London. The play was staged at the height of the Popish Plot, something Crowne addressed in his prologue. Although he states that \"by his feeble skill 'tis built alone, The Divine Shakespeare did not lay one Stone\" the plot in fact drew heavily on Henry VI, Part 2 and Part 3\nThe original cast included Joseph Williams as Henry VI of England, William Smith as Edward, John Bowman as  Duke of Clarence, Thomas Gillow as  Richard, Thomas Betterton as Earl of Warwick, Thomas Percival as Old Lord Clifford, John Wiltshire  as Young Clifford, Mary Lee as Queen Margaret, Mary Betterton as Lady Grey and Elizabeth Currer as  Lady Eleanor Butler.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Murray, Barbara A.
