It was released as the first single from the album in August 1995 by Warner Bros. It is the first track on One Hot Minute, beginning with an unusually quiet intro, before suddenly kicking into a very heavy, crunching riff, and ends with a mellow, melodic outro. Anthony Kiedis' vocals are distorted and echoed throughout, and contrast dramatically with the rapping present on the band's previous material, especially on their more fast-paced songs such as this; short lines are stretched to fill an entire measure. The musical style is of an unpredictable and unsettling nature, which is generally maintained throughout the entire album. The lyrics describe Kiedis' confused feelings about drugs, starting already in the first lines with: \"my tendency/for dependency/is offending me\".\nDespite being the album's first single, neither the song nor the accompanying video was included on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Greatest Hits compilation. The B-side \"Melancholy Mechanics\" also appears on the soundtrack to the 1996 movie Twister as well as on the Japanese pressing of One Hot Minute.\nCritical reception\nPan-European magazine Music & Media described 'Warped' as \"powerful\" and \"a smart move as leadoff single\". The reviewer added, \"Watch out Rage Against the Machine and Dog Eat Dog, as the inventors of the funk-rap-metal crossover are no longer recluses. Loud and proud they reclaim their position as leaders.\"\nMusic video\nWhile piecing together the final components of the album, the band recorded a video for \"Warped\", which was released on August 9, 1995. They asked Flea's brother-in-law, Gavin Bowden, to direct it. The video featured members of the band scantily clad and posing in rather sexual manners and it involved Kiedis and Navarro kissing towards the end as a way of breaking the monotony of cumbersome video recording. Thinking nothing of it, they continued to shoot and finished several days later. Warner Bros., however, saw the video and instantly wanted it thrown away, considering it to be unmarketable and that the kiss and homoerotic imagery would alienate a large portion of the band's fan base. The band came to a consensus to let the kiss remain on the final cut, prompting a backlash from the more conservative segments of their audience, who took offense at the action. Kiedis said of the situation: \"If they couldn't accept what we were doing, we didn't need them anymore.\"\nLive performances\n\"Warped\" made its live debut on May 31, 1994, at a surprise show in Los Angeles which was over a year before the song and album were released. Another notable performance of the song was during their co-headlining set at Woodstock 1994 however this and other earlier live versions featured slightly different lyrics as the song had yet to be completed in the studio. The band would also perform the song at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Warped\" became one of the band's most performed songs from One Hot Minute during the One Hot Minute tour however like a majority of the songs from that album, it hasn't been performed live since that tour with its last performance coming on July 9, 1996, in France.\nDuring live performances of \"Warped\", the band sometimes played a sample of the song \"Three Days\" by Jane's Addiction (former band of then-guitarist Dave Navarro) at the end of the song.\nTrack listing\n* CD single (1995)\n# \"Warped\" (edit)\n# \"Pea\" (album)\n# \"Melancholy Mechanics\" (previously unreleased)\nPersonnel\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n* Anthony Kiedis – vocals\n* Dave Navarro – guitar\n* Flea – bass\n* Chad Smith – drums\nAdditional musicians\n* Stephen Perkins – percussion\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for \"Warped\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1995)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 27\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100 Tipparade)\n| 14\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release dates and formats for \"Warped\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Version\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United States\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Warped\"\n|August 14, 1995\n|Alternative radio\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Warner Bros.\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|August 21, 1995\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japan\n|\"Warped\" / \"My Friends\"\n|October 10, 1995\n|CD\n|\n|}\nReferences"
