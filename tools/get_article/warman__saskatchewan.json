It is located approximately  north of the city of Saskatoon, and  northeast of the city of Martensville. According to the 2021 census, Warman is the fastest growing municipality in Saskatchewan, and was the fastest growing municipality in Canada between 2011 and 2016. Warman is a bedroom community of Saskatoon. The current mayor is Gary Philipchuk.\nWarman is the newest city in Saskatchewan, officially incorporated on October 27, 2012. Warman is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344.\nHistory\nWarman was first established in the fall of 1904 when the Canadian Northern Railway built its northern line (running from Humboldt to North Battleford) at the intersection with the Canadian Pacific Railway north–south line (running from Regina to Prince Albert). The original railway station was opened in the spring of 1907, and currently holds heritage status. Operational until 1942, the building now serves as a senior citizens' drop-in centre.\nInformally called \"Diamond\" due to the diamond shape made by the intersecting railway tracks, the name of the settlement was soon changed to Warman, in honour of Cy Warman (from Illinois), a journalist, author, and poet who worked as a publicity writer for Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway documenting the railway expansion boom in western Canada.\nFollowing the completion of the new railway, there was an inflow of settlers into the region, drawn by the promise of a quarter section of farmland for $10 as well as by the economic opportunities in the new community. The government, newspapers, and railways all promoted settlement, and Warman quickly developed into a thriving community with a school, churches, a bank, two hotels, a newspaper, a blacksmith shop, a shoe repair shop, many general stores and wooden pavements.\nA fire in 1908, followed by a tornado in 1910, destroyed most of the newly created village, including most of Main Street, reducing the population. Main Street became a residential side street, as the residents opted to rebuild along Central Street instead. The population continued to decline in the aftermath of World War I and by 1927, the village had dropped to unincorporated hamlet status, having its administrative affairs handled by the Rural Municipality of Warman.\nIn the early 1950s Warman began to grow again, as one of the first bedroom communities of Saskatoon. By 1961, the population of Warman had reached 659, so it was decided in 1962 to reincorporate as a village, then as a town four years later. By 2011, the town grew to a population of 7,084. The town council applied for city status in 2012, which was approved by the provincial government in the summer of that year. Warman officially became a city on October 27, 2012.\nDemographics\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Warman had a population of  living in  of its  total private dwellings, a change of |11020|1}} from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of  in 2021.\nEthnicity\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\"\n|+ Panethnic groups in the City of Warman (2001−2021)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Panethnic group\n! colspan=\"2\" |2021\n! colspan=\"2\" |2016\n! colspan=\"2\" |2011\n! colspan=\"2\" |2006\n! colspan=\"2\" |2001\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n| European\n| 10,245\n|\n| 9,480\n|\n| 6,360\n|\n| 4,515\n|\n| 3,365\n|\n|-\n| Indigenous\n| 1,355\n|\n| 905\n|\n| 530\n|\n| 185\n|\n| 65\n|\n|-\n| South Asian\n| 170\n|\n| 140\n|\n| 20\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| Southeast Asian\n| 165\n|\n| 210\n|\n| 90\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| African\n| 150\n|\n| 95\n|\n| 10\n|\n| 10\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| Latin American\n| 30\n|\n| 65\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 10\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| East Asian\n| 25\n|\n| 40\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 10\n|\n| 10\n|\n|-\n| Middle Eastern\n| 0\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| Other/multiracial\" and \"Multiple visible minorities\" under visible minority section on census.|name=Other}}\n| 0\n|\n| 25\n|\n| 0\n|\n| 10\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n!
