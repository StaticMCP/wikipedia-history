Several hypotheses exist related to its location, but a location in Lusitania, near Scallabis (modern day Santarém) is strongly considered.\nStrabo mentions that Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus made camp on an island near the city possibly identified as modern Almourol on the river Tagus.\nAnother hypothesis points to Alpiarça.\nReferences"
