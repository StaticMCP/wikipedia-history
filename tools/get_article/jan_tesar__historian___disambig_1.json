After having pursued studies in history at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague, he joined the Military Historical Institute in 1956. Expelled from that institution in 1958 for political reasons, he spent two years without a steady position and worked as an independent researcher before finally obtaining a position at the Museum of Pardubice. In 1961, he joined the Military Historical Institute once again. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1966 but resigned his membership in 1969. He was one of the founders of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS), a signatory of Charter 77, and promoter of the meetings between Czech and Polish dissidents in the Giant Mountains. From 1977, he was the editor of the dissident magazine Dialogy. In 1980, he left Czechoslovakia and initially went to Germany, only to later settle in France where he continued his political activities. After 1989, he took part in several academic and political initiatives concerning democratization.\nTesař lived in Slovakia. He died on 16 June 2025, at the age of 92.\nArchives on the History of Czechoslovak Dissent\nAs a historian well trained in archival work, Tesař has left two important collections that concern the history of the Czechoslovak dissident movement. One of them is currently located at the Museum of Moravia, while the other is held in the collections of La contemporaine in France.\nWorks\n* Mnichovský komplex : jeho příčiny a důsledky.
