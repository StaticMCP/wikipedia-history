It is at the northwestern end of the boundary between New Jersey and New York, the northern end of the boundary between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the eastern end of the boundary between New York and Pennsylvania. The monument is located at the confluence of the Delaware and Neversink rivers. This location is also known as Carpenter's Point.\nThe nearby Witness Monument, also known as the Reference Monument or the western State Line Monument, is a taller upright granite monument located south of the Laurel Grove Cemetery in Port Jervis, New York, and under a bridge for Interstate 84. It is not directly on any state boundary, but instead witnesses the location of two points: this tripoint and the corner boundary point between New York and Pennsylvania in the Delaware River.\nThe Supreme Court of the United States summarized the boundaries of these three states with respect to this monument in New Jersey v. New York, 283 U.S. 336 (1931):\nAlso, it is the northernmost point of New Jersey, in Montague Township, Sussex County.\nBackground\nIn 1664, King Charles II of England granted his brother, James, the Duke of York, a Royal colony that covered what had been New Netherlands. Later in 1664, the Duke of York divided this area between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton. The western and northern border was to be:\nHistory\nIn December 1872, the New Jersey Geological Survey had the State Geologist, George H. Cook, survey the boundary between New Jersey and New York. In 1874, the United States Coast Survey recovered the previous crow foot cut marking the station location and placed a lead-filled copper pipe in a deep hole drilled into the bedrock. In 1882, this copper bolt was replaced with a granite monument similar to the witness monument, but ice floes broke off the upper portion by the spring of 1883. The remaining monument was then reworked on May 21, 1885, to its current description.\nOlder United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps show the three states converging in the middle of the Delaware channel instead of at the monument. However, New York and Pennsylvania law describing the state boundary both explicitly refer to the monument as its eastern terminus. Since 1972, USGS maps reflecting the construction of Interstate 84, which crosses the two rivers just north of the monument, have shown the state lines meeting there.\nDescription\nThe Tri-States Monument is  long,  wide, and  high above the bedrock. The top surface is engraved with the initials of the names of the three states and with grooves representing the state boundaries. \"Tri States Monument\" is engraved on the north side. It is by the water's edge near the high-water mark of the rivers. A bronze United States Coast and Geodetic Survey survey marker stamped LAUREL NO. 2 1942 was in the center of the top surface until 2013. It was a reference mark for the triangulation station, LAUREL, that was  from the Witness Monument. Both were set in 1942.\nThe Witness Monument is inscribed \"Boundary Monument\" and dated 1882 on both sides. \"Witness Monument\" is engraved on the east side. The New Jersey (south) side details the location of the tripoint: feet from this is the Tri State Rock which is the northwest end of the New York & New Jersey Boundary & the north end of the New Jersey & Pennsylvania Boundary.}} It also lists the commissioners from New Jersey: Abraham Browning, Thomas N. McCarter, and George H. Cook; and surveyor Edward A. Bowser. The New York (north) side details the location of the corner boundary point between New York and Pennsylvania: And lists the commissioners from New York: Henry R. Pierson, Chauncey M. Depew, Elias W. Leavenworth; and surveyor H. W. Clarke.\nGallery\nFile:NJ-NY-PA Tri-States and Witness Monuments - looking southwest.jpg|Overlooking the Tri-States Monument and the Delaware River from the Witness Monument\nFile:NJ-NY-PA Tri-States Monument - looking southwest.jpg|Looking southwest along the Delaware River, with Sussex County, New Jersey on the left and Pike County, Pennsylvania on the right\nFile:NJ-NY-PA Tri-States Monument - looking north.jpg|Looking north under the Interstate 84 bridge and along the Delaware River toward Matamoras, Pennsylvania\nFile:Tri-State Rock, showing line of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania States (62085).jpg|Postcard view\nFile:USGS Port Jervis South (1995), NJ-NY-PA Tri-States Monument detail.jpg|Topographic map showing state boundaries\nSee also\n* New York – New Jersey Line War\n* New York–Pennsylvania border\n* List of extreme points of U.S. states and territories\n* List of tripoints of U.S. states\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
