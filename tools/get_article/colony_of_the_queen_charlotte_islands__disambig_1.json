In 2010, the archipelago was renamed Haida Gwaii.\nThe Queen Charlotte Colony was created by the Colonial Office in response to the increase of American marine trading activity resulting from the gold rush on Moresby Island in 1851. No separate administration or capital for the colony was ever established, as its only officer or appointee was James Douglas, who was simultaneously Governor of Vancouver Island. He was granted a commission as Lieutenant-Governor of the Queen Charlotte Islands in September 1852.\nWhile the archipelago was ostensibly a British colony, historical evidence, such as a seasonal mission of exploration to survey the islands as late as 1859 does not support the establishment of a permanent European settlement following the unsuccessful conclusion to the gold rush in 1853.\nPrior to and during its establishment as a nominative British colony, the archipelago was inhabited by groups of the Haida people, which comprised the sole population of the ostensible colony.\nSee also\n* Haida people\n* Haida Gwaii\n* Queen Charlottes Gold Rush\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\nSee also\n*Lillard, Charles.
