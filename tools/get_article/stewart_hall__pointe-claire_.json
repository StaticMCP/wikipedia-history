The house was named for the Isle of Mull, which was the ancestral home of Clan MacLean in the Scottish Highlands.\nThe Fathers of Sainte-Croix acquired the mansion in 1940, and they continued to operate the farm on the surrounding land.\nIn 1958, the Fathers of Sainte-Croix sold the land to a real estate developer, who was planning to build a high-rise apartment building on the site. However, the property was purchased by Walter and May Stewart (the parents of ), who donated it to the city of Pointe-Claire in exchange for $1.\nThe city of Pointe-Claire turned the house into a cultural centre, which was inaugurated on February 16, 1963.\nArchitecture\nThe exterior walls of the house are made from locally sourced limestone blocks. The building's design is symmetrical, and consists of thirty five rooms. A large veranda overlooks Lake Saint Louis.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ville.pointe-claire.qc.ca/en/stewart-hall-cultural-centre/cultural-centre.html Stewart Hall Cultural Centre]\n*[http://www.ville.pointe-claire.qc.ca/en/stewart-hall-art-gallery.html Stewart Hall Art Gallery]"
