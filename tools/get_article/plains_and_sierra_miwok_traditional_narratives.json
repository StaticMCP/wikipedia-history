These Miwoks are the linguistically related speakers of the Plains and Sierra Miwok languages and their descendants. At the time of European entry, local groups that spoke these languages participated in the general cultural pattern of central California.\nThe record of Sierra Miwok oral literature is one of the most extensive in the state (see the Sources section below). The record of Plains Miwok narrative, on the other hand, is quite limited (see the Merriam [1910] citation in the Sources section below).\nOn-Line examples of their narratives\n* [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/ioy/index.htm The Indians of Yosemite Valley and Vicinity] by Galen Clark (1904)\n* [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/scc Indian Myths of South Central California] by Alfred L.
