It originally aired for 3 seasons from January 14, 2015, to March 8, 2017. The series is set in Chicago, about a naïve and soft-spoken man in his 20s named Josh Greenberg (played by Jay Baruchel), who finds himself in several surrealist and awkward circumstances while trying to find love.\nThe series is based on Rich's short story compilation, The Last Girlfriend on Earth, Jonathan Krisel, Andrew Singer, and Lorne Michaels are also executive producers, with Broadway Video, Allagash Industries and FXP (formerly FX Productions) as production companies. It has received generally positive reviews from critics.\nOn April 4, 2017, the show was canceled after three seasons.\nPremise\nMost episode plots are based on relatable conflicts and struggles of entering/maintaining a relationship; however, these conflicts are taken to absurd and literal extremes. The show centers on Josh Greenberg, who struggles finding love after a break-up with his long-term girlfriend Maggie. His mature and successful older sister Liz often tries to help him enter into a serious relationship, and his sex-crazed best friend Mike often tries to help him with solely having sex. Josh's efforts oftentimes lead him into surreal and awkward circumstances such as going on a date with an actual troll, physically misplacing his penis, meeting a Japanese monster composed of human penises, or learning that there is a national abstinence movement among women that is applied to him and no one else. Sometimes Josh is successful in finding a girlfriend; however, these relationships usually only survive for one episode.\nCast and characters\nMain\n* Jay Baruchel as Josh Greenberg, a naïve and soft-spoken 27-year-old man working a temp job. He struggles to find love, following a break-up from a long relationship. He is sometimes used as a straight man when absurd and surreal things happen.\n* Eric André as Mike Scaggs, Josh's laid-back best friend who has an easier time with girls than Josh. He often attempts to help Josh, however, he is more interested in helping him have sex as opposed to entering into a serious relationship.\n* Britt Lower as Liz Greenberg, Josh's protective and caring older sister who also tries to help Josh. Her methods of helping are more rational and down-to-earth than Mike's; they are more driven to getting Josh into a serious relationship. She has a condescending view of Mike, who in turn doesn't seem to have an opinion of her.\n* Maya Erskine as Maggie (season 1), Josh's ex-girlfriend, who breaks up with him at the start of the series.\n* Katie Findlay as Lucy Parker (season 3), Josh's girlfriend and later wife.\nRecurring\n* Robin Duke as Patti Greenberg, Josh and Liz's mother.\n* Mark McKinney as Tom Greenberg, Josh and Liz's step-father.\n* Jeff Pangman as Charles Powell, Josh's boss.\n* Ennis Esmer as Leo (season 1), Liz's boyfriend.\n* Rosa Salazar as Rosa Mendes (season 2), a co-worker of Josh's that he and Mike both fall in love with.\nProduction\nOn June 19, 2013, FXX ordered a pilot episode for Man Seeking Woman from Simon Rich, directed by Jonathan Krisel.
