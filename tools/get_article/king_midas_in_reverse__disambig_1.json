It was released as a single in September 1967 in anticipation of the band's album Butterfly.\nMusical style\nThe track was a departure in style for the group and influenced by Graham Nash's visits to the United States. Nash wanted to take the band in a new direction, which was resisted by other members of the band, and this led to his departure and move to the US. The song was released in the UK on the Parlophone label (R5637) and in the US on the Epic label (10234). While a critical success, the song was a commercial failure by the Hollies' standards, prompting them to write and record the more commercial song \"Jennifer Eccles\" for their next single.\nReception\nCash Box said  that it's \"a crashing folk-drenched rock side with heavy push in the rhythm section and some fine group vocal work\" that also has \"stunning production.\" Record World called it a \"compelling rock ballad about a destructive young chap..\"\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Chart performance for \"King Midas in Reverse\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1967)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Go-Set)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Singles Chart)\n|align=\"center\"|16\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Listener)\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCover versions\n*Nash performed the song in his solo section of concerts with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the band Nash joined after the Hollies, during their 1970 tours.
