There are 364 WW2 graves and a dedicated RAF cemetery. A number of Soviet pilots are also buried there from a plane crash in 1942. The site is in very poor condition having not been maintained or renovated by the CWGC and the graves are unmarked with the field being used as a dump and for sports with the RAF section being used to grow vegetables.\nHistory\nIn 1935 the site was cleared of gravestones due to their deterioration and a Memorial Screen Wall was installed with the names of the men buried there – none of which survive - when they were removed and by whom is unknown.

Indian Forces Cemetery]. The combined two cemeteries contain the remains of almost 5,000 servicemen primarily from WW1, some civilian graves and a few from World War II.\nDuring WW2 Basra was part of the Trans-Iranian transport route for the delivery of Lend-Lease to the USSR. Among the Soviet dead are included the crew from a plane crash in 08/05/1942:\nAlexey Nikolaevich Ivanov, Senior Lieutenant, commander of the aviation unit, section 7, row G, grave 5;\nYuri Pavlovich Zaitsev, foreman, navigator, section 7/G/6.It was maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) until 2007. Those buried at the cemetery include Victoria Cross recipient George Godfrey Massy Wheeler, and Henry Howard, 19th Earl of Suffolk.\nThe Daily Telegraph reported on 10 November 2013 that the cemetery had been damaged, with a number of headstones knocked down and broken by looters and vandals. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission subsequently cleared the site of all grave markers before abandoning the site, the cross of sacrifice and plinth. Local neighbors then started using the area as a football and games field.\nThe graves themselves remain undisturbed, and the sub-bases remain in place, making individual graves relatively easy to identify. As of July 2024 the CWGC has no plans to return to the country and renovate or maintain any of the cemeteries and monuments there.\nIn July 2024 a relative of a soldier buried there from 1941 visited the site and laid a new gravestone. The first new gravestone to be laid in over 80 years.\nGallery\nFile:Basra Cemetery Plot 1945.png|A map of the cemetery's plots.\nFile:Basra War Cemetery Gate.jpg|The main gate.\nFile:Gravestone of Gunner Joseph Soppitt Royal Artillery 1941.jpg|Gravestone of Royal Artillery Gunner Joseph Soppitt\nFile:Remains of plinth from Basra War Cemetery.jpg|The base of the plinth from Basra War Cemetery\nSee also\n* Amara War Cemetery\n* Basra Memorial\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/245492631177850/?ref=share&mibextid=K35XfP&rdid=cP6dUGuT1bBrxc0w&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2FEN4YneFbdqBF8U7c%2F%3Fmibextid%3DK35XfP Friends of Basra War Cemetery]\n* [https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/mesopotamia-campaign Mesopotamia Campaign]\n*\n* [https://www.cwgc.org/visit-us/find-cemeteries-memorials/cemetery-details/57200/basra-war-cemetery/ Commonwealth War Graves Commission Basra War Cemetery]\n*"
