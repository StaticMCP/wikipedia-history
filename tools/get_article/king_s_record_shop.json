It was released on June 26, 1987, her fifth album for the label. The album produced four singles on the Billboard country singles chart. They were  \"The Way We Make a Broken Heart\", a cover of her father Johnny Cash's \"Tennessee Flat Top Box\", \"If You Change Your Mind\", and \"Runaway Train\". This was the last album in Cash's career to feature Rodney Crowell as the sole record producer, who produced all of her albums since her first Columbia album Right or Wrong in 1980.\nThe album is named after King's Record Shop in Louisville, Kentucky, which was owned by Pee Wee King's younger brother, Gene. A photograph of Rosanne Cash standing in the shop's doorway is featured on the cover, though she was never actually at the shop for the photo.  Veteran steel guitarist Hank DeVito took the photo of the record shop and one of Rosanne standing as she is in the photo. A picture of Cash's 1981 album Seven Year Ache is shown. He superimposed her into the record shop photo (Music City News magazine, August 1987).\nSony BMG controversially used their XCP technology on the album when it was re-released in 2005 as part of its American Milestones series.\nTrack listing\nCD bonus tracks\n\"707\" (John Kilzer) – 3:34\n\"Runaway Train\" (live) (John Stewart) – 4:17\n\"Green, Yellow and Red\" (live) (John Kilzer) – 5:15\nPersonnel\n*Rosanne Cash: vocals, guitar\n*Rodney Crowell: background vocals\n*Vince Gill: background vocals\n*Arnold McCuller: background vocals\n*Mark O'Connor: mandola\n*Patty Smyth: background vocals\n*Benmont Tench: piano, keyboards\n*Steve Winwood: background vocals\n*Sterling Ball: acoustic guitar\n*Eddie Bayers: drums\n*Barry Beckett: piano, Hammond organ\n*Larry Crane: acoustic & electric guitar\n*Anthony Crawford: background vocals\n*Kristen DeLauer: background vocals\n*Terry Evans: background vocals\n*Willie Green, Jr.: background vocals\n*Bobby King: background vocals\n*Joann Neal: background vocals\n*Michael Rhodes: bass guitar, acoustic bass\n*Vince Santoro: drums\n*Randy Scruggs: acoustic guitar\n*Jean Smith: background vocals\n*Steuart Smith: electric guitar, gut string guitar\n*Billy Joe Walker Jr.: acoustic & electric guitar\nProduction\n*Rodney Crowell: producer\n*T-Bone Toglio: assistant producer\n*Margie Hunt: production assistant\n*Martha Wood: production assistant\n*John Agnello: engineer\n*Donivan Cowart: engineer\n*Jeanne Kinney: engineer\n*Steve Marcantonio: engineer, mixing\n*Keith Odle: engineer\n*Frank Pekoc: engineer\n*George Marino: mastering\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1987–1988)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canadian Albums (RPM)\n| 57\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1988)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard)\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1989)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard)\n| 47\n|}\nReferences\n*Hall, Wade.
