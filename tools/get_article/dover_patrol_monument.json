Two identical granite memorial obelisks,  high, were erected near Dover and on the Cap Blanc-Nez near Calais in 1921 and 1922.  A third was erected in Brooklyn, New York, in 1931.  The UK monument became a Grade II listed building in August 1966, promoted to Grade II* in August 2015.\nBackground\nThe Dover Patrol was formed in July 1914, around a nucleus of the 12 Tribal class destroyers.  Through the First World War, a variety of craft served in the patrol—cruisers, destroyers old and new, submarines, mine-sweepers, armed trawlers and drifters, armed yachts, motor launches and other coastal craft—as well as a variety of aircraft - flying boats, aeroplanes, and airships.  From time to time, French destroyers were included in the patrol.\nThe patrol covered the southern part of the North Sea and the eastern portion of the English Channel, including the Straits of Dover.  Its duties included escorting merchant ships, hospital ships and troop transports; anti-submarine patrols; sweeping for German mines, and laying British minefields and anti-submarine nets; and bombarding German land forces on the coast of Belgium and northern France.  It was commanded by Admiral Reginald Bacon from 1914 until his retirement at the end of 1917, and then by Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes.  Six members of the patrol were awarded the Victoria Cross in a single action on 22–23 April 1918, for their part in the Zeebrugge Raid to block the entrance to the port of Bruges-Zeebrugge and so prevent German vessels from leaving port.\nSome 2,000 members of the patrol lost their lives during the war.  A committee was formed in November 1918 to raise a public subscription for the erection of a monument in memory of the patrol.  Over £45,000 was raised, including £1,000 donated by King Albert and Queen Elizabeth of the Belgians.\nDescription\nA granite memorial obelisk was designed by Sir Aston Webb, perhaps better known as the designer of Admiralty Arch, the Victoria Memorial on the Mall, and the façade of Buckingham Palace, all in London.  Three obelisks were erected, the first at Leathercote Point to the east of St Margaret's Bay at St Margaret's at Cliffe near Dover, on land donated by Granville Leveson-Gower, 3rd Earl Granville; a second at Cap Blanc Nez near Sangatte in northern France; and a third in New York City.\nThe monument has an air of Egyptian architecture.  It comprises a  high obelisk of square section constructed from large granite blocks, with a pyramidal top.  The obelisk stands on a tall stone plinth, which flares out onto a square base.  Three sides of the base have a frame of ashlar blocks around an inscription.\nDover memorial\nThe first stone of the memorial near Dover )}} was laid by Prince Arthur of Connaught on 19 November 1919.  The completed monument was unveiled by the Prince of Wales on 27 July 1921.  On both occasions a dedication was led by Harold Bilbrough, the Suffragan Bishop of Dover.\nThe south-western side is inscribed \"THIS STONE WAS LAID BY /  H.R.H. PRINCE ARTHUR OF CONNAUGHT, K.G. / 19TH NOVEMBER 1919 / AND THE MEMORIAL WAS UNVEILED BY / H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES, K.G. / 27TH JULY 1921.\"\nThe north-western unframed side is inscribed \"THIS MONUMENT / TO THE /  DOVER PATROL / WAS ERECTED IN THE YEARS 1920 & 1921 BY / PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION TOGETHER WITH THOSE / AT CAP BLANC NEZ, FRANCE / AND NEW YORK HARBOUR, / AMERICA. / THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES SERVING THEIR KING / AND COUNTRY IN THE DOVER PATROL ARE RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF / REMEMBRANCE IN THE TOWN HALL, DOVER, A COPY OF WHICH IS KEPT / AT THE PARISH CHURCH, ST MARGARETS AT CLIFFE\".\nThe south-eastern side of the monument is inscribed \"TO THE GLORY OF GOD / AND IN EVERLASTING / REMEMBRANCE OF / THE DOVER PATROL / 1914 - 1919 / THEY DIED THAT WE MIGHT LIVE / MAY WE BE WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE / TO THE MEMORY OF THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE ROYAL NAVY AND MERCHANT NAVY / WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN SHIPS SAILING UPON THE WATERS OF THE DOVER STRAIT / 1939 - 1946\".\nA Book of Remembrance listing nearly the names of 2,000 war dead from the Dover Patrol is held at St Margaret's Church, near the monument.\nA Coastguard Station was erected nearby, and a radar station during the Second World War.\nThe monument became a Grade II listed building in August 1966, promoted to Grade II* in August 2015.\nCalais memorial\nA second obelisk )}} stands on top of Cap Blanc Nez near Sangatte in the Pas-de-Calais. Part of the inscription is in French, which claims that the monument was inaugurated by Flaminius Raiberti (the then minister of the French Navy) on 20 July 1922). It also claims that the first stone was laid by Maréchal Foch on 28 January 1920.\nThe memorial was blown up during the occupation and rebuilt in 1962. There are German bunkers in the cliffside.\nThe memorial was drawn by Leon de Keyser (an architect from Ghent) and built by Martiny of Brussels.\nThe memorial was renovated in 2007 as part of the renewal of the Grand Site de France Les Deux-Caps.\nNear the monument there is also a monument dedicated to Hubert Latham.\nNew York memorial\nA third obelisk )}} was erected near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in John Paul Jones Park in Brooklyn, New York, in 1931.  Inscriptions on the New York memorial read: \"THIS MONUMENT / TO THE DOVER PATROL / ERECTED AS A TRIBUTE TO THE / COMRADSHIP AND SERVICE OF THE / AMERICAN NAVAL FORCES / IN EUROPE / DURING THE WORLD WAR. / MONUMENTS OF IDENTICAL DESIGN AT / DOVER ENGLAND - CAP BLANC NEZ FRANCE - NEW YORK, NY. / ERECTED FROM FUNDS PROVIDED BY PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION / IN GREAT BRITAIN\" and then: \"TO THE GLORY OF GOD / AND IN EVERLASTING / REMEMBRANCE OF / THE DOVER PATROL / 1914-1919 / THEY DIED THAT WE MIGHT LIVE / MAY WE BE / WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE\" and the date \"1931\".\nThe New York memorial was recently named a \"WWI Centennial Memorial\" after being enter in the 100 Cities - 100 Memorials competition.\nFile:St Margaret's at Cliffe and memorial from Strait of Dover.jpg|View of the memorial on the cliffs near Dover\nFile:Dover Patrol memorial, Cap Blanc Nez.jpg|View of the memorial on the cliffs near Calais\nFile:Former Coastguard Station - geograph.org.uk - 1408810.jpg|Former Coastguard Station beside the monument near Dover\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed war memorials in England\nNotes\nReferences\n* [http://www.doverwarmemorialproject.org.uk/index.htm The Dover War Memorial website]\n* [http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1070067  Dover Patrol Memorial] on the Historic England website\n* [http://www.britainatwar.com/view_article.asp?ID=3726 Dover Patrol Memorial on the Britain at War magazine website]\n* [http://whitecliffscountry.org.uk/Whats-On/Events/2015/July/DoverPatrolMemorialServiceatLeathercotePointatStMargaretsBay.aspx Dover Patrol Memorial, White Cliffs Country website]\n* [http://catalogue.stmargaretshistory.org.uk/items/show/4312 Dover Patrol Memorial on the St Margaret's village archive website]\n* [http://catalogue.stmargaretshistory.org.uk/items/show/3895 Dover Patrol Memorial on the St Margaret's village archive website]\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/1579 Dover Patrol Memorial] on the Imperial War Museum website\n* [http://www.dover-kent.co.uk/ww1_dover_patrol.htm The Dover Patrol on the Dover (Kent) website]\n* [http://www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com/trails/the-allies-logisitics-base-on-the-channel-coast/dover-patrol-memorial-sangatte.html Dover Patrol Memorial near Cap Blanc Nez, on a website dedicated to remembrance trails in Northern France]\n* [http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/john-paul-jones-park/monuments/397 Dover Patrol Monument in John Paul Jones Park] on the NYC Parks website"
