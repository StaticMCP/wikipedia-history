As per tradition, it was the first primary and second nominating contest overall to take place in the cycle.\nBernie Sanders delivered a stinging defeat to Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, sweeping all demographic cohorts but dominating among voters without a college degree, younger voters and lower-income voters. Sanders claimed 15 delegates to Clinton's 9.\nIt occurred on the same day as the Republican primary.\nDebates and forums\nDecember 2015 debate in Goffstown\nOn December 19, 2015, the Democratic Party held their third debate at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. Hosted by \"World News Tonight\" anchor David Muir and Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz, it aired on ABC News. Before the debate, WMUR-TV's co-sponsorship had been revoked by the DNC due to a labor dispute. Participants were Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley.\nThe topics covered during the debate included Sanders' campaign's breach of Clinton's campaign data, strategy for defeating ISIS, gun control, the issue of whether to depose President Assad of Syria, if Wall Street favored each candidate, stability in the Middle East enforced by dictators and whether regime change was necessary, and the role of the First Spouse.\nFebruary 2016 forum in Derry\nA fifth forum, a Town Hall event, was held on February 3, 2016, in Derry, New Hampshire. It aired on CNN.\nLesser known candidates forum at Goffstown\nOne of the highlights of the campaign is when the non-recognized candidates gather together to introduce themselves to the public at this event, which first was held in 1972.\nDue to the notorious glitter-bombing incident of the previous cycle, Vermin Supreme was pointedly dis-invited, but showed up anyway, and made the national news. Eighteen people showed up: Jon Adams, Eric Elbot, Rocky De La Fuente, Mark Greenstein, Henry Hewes, William McGaughey, Edward O'Donnell, Graham Schwass, Sam Sloan, Edward Sonnino, Michael Steinberg, and several others.\nFebruary 2016 debate in Durham\nUnlike in previous years, initially, only a single authorized debate was scheduled to be held in New Hampshire. Initially planned as an unsanctioned debate, a debate on February 4 in Durham, New Hampshire was however later confirmed by the DNC. Hosted by Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow, it was broadcast by NBC News. While Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley all confirmed their participation, O'Malley eventually came to suspend his campaign prior to the debate.\nCommentators of the debate cited the elevated discourse between the candidates. There was discussion on the death penalty (federal versus state), money in politics, and assessing Iran, North Korea and Russia as threats to national security. Clinton demanded that Sanders explain his \"artful smears\" of Clinton receiving campaign donations. Sanders responded by critiquing the inherently \"quid-pro-quo\" nature of Wall Street campaign donations. The exchange between the two candidates was called by Eric Levitz one of the best 10-minute exchanges in the history of American political debates.\nCandidates\n, on August 24, 2015]]\n.]]\nat a rally following the 2016 Democratic primary.]]\nThis is a list of the candidates on the ballot in the New Hampshire primary.\nThe following notable candidates had participated in all authorized debates:\n* Hillary Clinton of New York (campaign), United States Secretary of State (2009–2013), presidential candidate in 2008, United States Senator from New York (2001–2009), First Lady of the United States (1993–2001)\n* Bernie Sanders of Vermont (campaign), United States Senator from Vermont (2007–present), United States Representative from Vermont (1991–2007), Mayor of Burlington (1981–1989)\n* Martin O'Malley of Maryland (campaign), Governor of Maryland (2007–2015), Mayor of Baltimore (1999–2007).

Sanders' win was propelled by younger voters, whom he won 74–25, men whom he won 67–32, self-identified Independents whom he won 73–25, and white voters whom he won 61-37 and who comprised 91% of the Democratic electorate in New Hampshire. According to exit polls, a 53–45 majority of voters thought Clinton was not honest or trustworthy, while 89% said Sanders was honest. 61% of voters said they were dissatisfied or angry about the federal government. Sanders swept all income levels and educational attainment levels in New Hampshire, except those who made more than $200k per year.\nSanders swept all of the major cities, including Nashua, Dover, Concord, and Manchester. Sanders won along the seacoast 59–41, in the Manchester/Nashua area 54–44, in Concord/Ct. Valley 64–35, in the south 59–39, and in the north 65–33. Clinton only won three towns: Bedford, Millsfield, and Windham.\nSanders' landslide victory was a clear regression for Clinton from 2008, when she had narrowly beaten Barack Obama in the 2008 New Hampshire primary thanks to support from populous southern New Hampshire. Furthermore, Clinton's win in Iowa but loss in New Hampshire marked a reversal of the 2008 results, where Clinton had scored a \"comeback victory\" in NH after coming third in Iowa. Both Sanders' percentage of the vote and margin of victory are the largest in a Democratic New Hampshire primary since John F. Kennedy in 1960.\nSee also\n* 2016 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations"
