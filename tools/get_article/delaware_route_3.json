The route runs from Lighthouse Road/Hay Road just south of Interstate&nbsp;495 (I-495) in Edgemoor north to DE&nbsp;92 in Hanbys Corner. The route passes through the suburban areas of Brandywine Hundred, Bellefonte, and Arden. It intersects I-495 and U.S. Route&nbsp;13 (US&nbsp;13) in Edgemoor, US&nbsp;13 Business (US&nbsp;13 Bus.) in Bellefonte, and I-95 near Bellevue State Park. DE&nbsp;3 was built as a state highway during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1968, the route was designated between US&nbsp;13 (now US&nbsp;13 Bus.) north to DE&nbsp;92 on Marsh Road. The route was moved to its current alignment and terminus by 1984.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;3 begins at an intersection with Lighthouse Road/Hay Road just south of an interchange with I-495 in an industrial section of Edgemoor, heading northwest on four-lane divided Edgemoor Road. After the I-495 interchange, the road passes over Norfolk Southern's Shellpot Secondary and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad lines before it intersects US&nbsp;13 near businesses. Past this intersection, DE&nbsp;3 enters a more residential area as a three-lane undivided road with two southbound lanes and one northbound lane. The route narrows to two lanes and turns west and north, coming to an intersection with US&nbsp;13 Bus. At this point, Shipley Road heads north and DE&nbsp;3 turns northeast to form a concurrency with US&nbsp;13 Bus. on four-lane undivided Philadelphia Pike, running through residential and commercial areas. DE&nbsp;3 splits from US&nbsp;13 Bus. at the northwest edge of the town of Bellefonte by turning northwest onto Washington Street Extension, a four-lane divided highway. The route passes to the southwest of Mount Pleasant High School and turns north onto Marsh Road, a four-lane undivided road that forms the western boundary of Bellevue State Park. The road becomes a divided highway as it crosses Carr Road and comes to a diamond interchange with I-95, with the ramps to and from northbound I-95 connecting to Carr Road.\nImmediately after this interchange, DE&nbsp;3 crosses under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line and narrows into a two-lane undivided road that heads through suburban areas in Brandywine Hundred, running through residential neighborhoods and past a few businesses. The route gains a center left-turn lane between Wilson Road/Veale Road and Silverside Road. The road curves northeast and forms the western border of the village of Arden. DE&nbsp;3 turns north again past the Grubb Road/Harvey Road intersection and leaves Arden as it runs between neighborhoods to the west and woodland to the east, ending at an intersection with DE&nbsp;92 in Hanbys Corner. Marsh Road continues north past this intersection as an unnumbered road toward the Pennsylvania state line.\nDE&nbsp;3 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 13,642&nbsp;vehicles at the I-95 interchange to a low of 4,708&nbsp;vehicles on Washington Street Extension.\nHistory\nWhat is now DE&nbsp;3 existed as a county road by 1920. Four years later, the road was upgraded to a state highway between Philadelphia Pike and Harvey Road. The state highway was extended north to Naamans Road by 1931. By 1968, DE&nbsp;3 was designated to run from US&nbsp;13 (now US&nbsp;13 Bus.) north to DE&nbsp;92 along Marsh Road. DE&nbsp;4 was extended onto the Washington Street Extension portion of present-day DE&nbsp;3 three years later. DE&nbsp;4 was removed from Washington Street Extension by 1981. Three years later, DE&nbsp;3 was extended to I-495 in Edgemoor. At this time, DE&nbsp;3 was realigned to follow Washington Street Extension from Marsh Road to a concurrency with US&nbsp;13 Bus., heading southwest along that route before heading southeast along Edgemoor Road.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n|notes=Exits 4B-A on I-495\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Southern end of US&nbsp;13 Bus.  concurrency\n}}\n|notes=Northern end of US&nbsp;13 Bus. concurrency\n}}\n|notes=Exit 9 on I-95\n}}\n|notes=Northern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-003/ DE&nbsp;3 at AARoads.com]"
