It is situated in Cumberland East Bay on the northeastern coast of the island. The settlement is the second smallest capital in the world by population, after Ngerulmud in Palau.\nHistory\nKing Edward Point was named in honour of King Edward VII. Grytviken (pot cove in Norwegian and Swedish) is nearby and was named after sealers' trywork. Both of these are along the King Edward Cove.\nThe Post Office in King Edward Point was established in 1909, and has been in operation since then with the exception of the Falklands War. The oldest building in King Edward Point is the customs warehouse and jail built in 1914.\nDiscovery House, a prefabricated laboratory, was established in 1925, and used by biologists collecting specimens from whale carcasses for six years. In 1929, Discovery II was opened for use in oceanographic study.\nArgentine soldiers arrived near King Edward Point on 24 March 1982, and occupied it on 3 April. The British retook King Edward Point in late April.\nEnvironment\nElephant and fur seals inhabit the area. Cats were brought to King Edward Point, but the last one died in 1980.\nClimate\nKing Edward Point and Grytviken have a tundra climate (Köppen ET) with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. The highest temperature ever recorded at Grytviken/King Edward Point was  on 10 March 1922.\n|source 2 = Globalbioclimatics/Salvador Rivas-Martínez (precipitation 1901–1950) DMI/Danish Meteorology Institute (sun, humidity, and precipitation days 1931–1960) Météo Climat (extremes)\n}}\nSee also\n* List of Antarctic research stations\n* List of Antarctic field camps\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mclaren.gs/kep.html King Edward Point]\n* [https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/king-edward-point/ British Antarctic Survey Research Station King Edward Point, South Georgia]"
