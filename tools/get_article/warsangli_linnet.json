It is found only in Somalia. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest and subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland. It is threatened by habitat loss.\nThe Warsangli linnet has not yet been examined genetically; it was formerly placed in the genus Carduelis but was assigned to the genus Linaria based on its plumage similarities to the common linnet Linaria cannabina.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Warsangli Linnet\n\n#REDIRECT Warsangli linnet\n}}"
