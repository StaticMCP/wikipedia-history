The reason for the rewrite was to fix architectural issues and eliminate the use of singletons. Development of Dancer1 was at first frozen, but was later continued to maintain backward compatibility for existing apps.\nDancer is developed through GitHub, with stable releases available via CPAN. Dancer2 is released as a separate module.\nExample\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\nuse Dancer2;\nget '/hello/:name' => sub {\nreturn \"Why, hello there \" . route_parameters->get('name');\n};\nget '/redirectMeTo/:trgval' => sub {\nredirect '/' . route_parameters->get('trgval');\n};\nstart;\nFeatures\nOut-of-box\nUnlike other frameworks such as Catalyst, Dancer only requires a handful of CPAN modules and is very self-contained.\nStandalone development server\nDancer includes a standalone development server that can be used for developing and testing applications.\nPSGI / Plack support\nDancer supports the PSGI specification, and can thus be run on any compliant PSGI server, including Plack, uWSGI or [http://mongrel2.org/ Mongrel 2].\nAbstracted\nSince most parts of Dancer are abstracted and has a plugin architecture, extending Dancer is fairly straightforward, and a thriving community has sprung up around building these extensions.\nDancer features a lightweight object system, exception throwing similar to Try::Tiny, and is fast, especially in CGI environments.\nSee also\n* Comparison of web frameworks\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n**\n* [https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2 Module on CPAN]\n* [https://advent.perldancer.org/2011/8 Dancer 2, or Why I Rewrote Everything]\n*"
