Daði responded by secretly raising an elite force of similar size from his followers, half of which were heavily armored sveinar and half unarmored but equipped with guns. Mounted and covered in gray cloaks they marched under the cover of dark and foggy weather unnoticed by the Bishop's forces, surprising them early in the morning. The battle was nonetheless close fought and Daði was almost shot down by gunfire when he led his troops into the fray.\nAfter being cornered in the Church, the Bishop accepted Daði's terms and surrendered. The bishop was captured along with his two sons and they were executed on 7 November 1550.\nReferences\nSources\n*Vilborg Auður Ísleifsdóttir, Siðbreytingin á Íslandi 1537–1565: Byltingin að ofan,, Hið íslenzka bókmenntafélag.
