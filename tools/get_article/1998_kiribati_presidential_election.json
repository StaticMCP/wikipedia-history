His government and the opposition both lost seats in the House of Assembly during the September 1998 parliamentary elections.\nThe candidates were chosen by the House of Assembly, voting on which three of its members would appear on the ballot. It selected Tito, Harry Tong, and Amberoti Nikora.\nResults\nThe presidential election was held on 27 November. Tito was reelected with 52.33 percent of the vote. It was the second election, following the one of 1994, in which the vote difference of the winner and the runner up was greater than the combined votes of other candidates.\n}}\nAftermath\nTito was reelected again in the February 2003 presidential election, but his government was dissolved the following month through a motion of no confidence. He was succeeded by Anote Tong.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
