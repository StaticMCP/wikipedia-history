Wellman and produced by Walter Wanger. Starring Edward Arnold and Arthur Byron, the film is an adaptation of Rex Stout's political novel of the same name.\nUpon its release, the film was praised for its ensemble cast but author John Douglas Eames, in his 1985 book The Paramount Story, stated that, even with \"an accomplished cast and an out-of-the-rut story,  The President Vanishes couldn't buck moviegoers' apathy towards political subjects\".\nPremise\nThe film follows the story of The President Vanishes.\nCast\n* Edward Arnold as Secretary of War Wardell\n* Arthur Byron as President Craig Stanley\n* Paul Kelly as Chick Moffat\n* Peggy Conklin as Alma Cronin\n* Andy Devine as Val Orcott\n* Janet Beecher as Mrs. Stanley\n* Osgood Perkins as Harris Brownell\n* Sidney Blackmer as D.L.

The Catholic Church demanded an implementation and enforcement of a set of industry censorship guidelines to control and remove content that the church saw as immoral. Threatened by a large scale boycott of all Hollywood films, Will H. Hays, then president of Motion Picture Association of America, came to an agreement with the church that saw the establishment of Production Code Administration and passage of the Motion Picture Production Code, also known as Hays Code. The Hays Code was in use from 1934 until 1968 when it was abandoned in favor of the MPAA film rating system.\nReception\nThe film recorded a loss of $145,948.\nSee also\n* 1934 in film\n* Cinema of the United States\n* List of American films of 1934\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
