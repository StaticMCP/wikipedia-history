The Democratic ticket of the governor of New York Samuel J. Tilden and the governor of Indiana Thomas A. Hendricks defeated the Republican ticket of the governor of Ohio Rutherford B. Hayes and the U.S. representative from New York's 19th congressional district William A. Wheeler. Hayes defeated Tilden in the national election with 185 electoral votes.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nIndiana chose 15 electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate, if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table reflects the statewide popular vote as calculated by Walter Dean Burnham in his influential study, Presidential Ballots, 1836–1892. Svend Petersen finds ten more votes for Tilden and 1,140 more for Hayes.\n}}\n3.06}}\n}}\n4.87}}\n}}\n2.22}}\n}}\nStatistics\nThis was the first time the Democratic presidential ticket carried Indiana since 1856. As of 2024, this is the only presidential election in which the Republican nominee won without carrying Indiana. This was the second and most recent election (along with 1848) when the state voted for a losing Democrat.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Indiana\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
