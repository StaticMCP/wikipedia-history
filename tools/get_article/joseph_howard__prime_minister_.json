He studied at the Lyceum and abroad, also serving at the French Military academy. Upon return to Malta, he had a career in business in the tobacco industry, up to being appointed director of Cousis Cigarettes. From 1914 to 1925 he served as consul of Japan in Malta and President of the Chamber of Commerce. He also chaired the ''Società dell'Arte, Manifattura e Commercio and  La Società Filarmonica La Valette''.\nIn 1912 Malta's Comitato Patriottico appointed him as member of the Council of Government. He chaired the Government emigration committee, and in 1919 headed the delegation which discussed the employment of Maltese emigrants with the French authorities.\nAt the 1921 elections Howard joined Msg. Ignazio Panzavecchia's Maltese Political Union (Unjoni Politika Maltija, UPM) and was elected Senator in the first Maltese Parliament. With 14 seats, UPM was the first party, but short of a majority. Governor Lord Plumer offered the premiership to Howard, as Panzavecchia could not accept it. Howard led the first autonomous Maltese government from 1921 to 1923 with the support of the Malta Labour Party, which held 7 seats.\nAccording to Rudolf, the appointment of Howard was deemed unusual, as he held personal views closer to the rival Constitutional Party, which also held 7 seats. As a first act in government, Howard proclaimed Roman Catholicism as the official religion of the country (Religion of Malta Declaration Act).\nHoward was also made Officer of the British Empire (OBE). He died aged 63 in 1925.\nDuring his premiership mandate, Joseph Muscat paid yearly tribute to Howard on the day of his birth from 2015 to 2018.\nThe green areas separating Mdina from Rabat have been named Howard Gardens.\nSee also\n*Prime Minister of Malta\n*List of prime ministers of Malta\nReferences"
