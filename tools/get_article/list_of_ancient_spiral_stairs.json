The spiral stair is a type of stairway which, due to its complex helical structure, has been introduced relatively late into architecture. Although the oldest example dates back to the 5th century BC, it was only in the wake of the influential design of the Trajan's Column that this space-saving new type permanently caught hold in ancient Roman architecture.\nApart from the triumphal columns in the imperial cities of Rome and Constantinople, other types of buildings such as temples, thermae, basilicas and tombs were also fitted with spiral stairways. Their notable absence in the towers of the Aurelian Wall indicates that they did not yet figure prominently in Roman military engineering. By late antiquity, separate stair towers were constructed adjacent to the main buildings, like in the Basilica of San Vitale.\nThe construction of spiral stairs passed on both to Christian and Islamic architecture.\nSpiral stairs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"22%\" | Monument\n! width=\"10%\" | Location\n! width=\"10%\" | Country\n! width=\"10%\" | Date of construction\n! width=\"10%\" | Height\n! width=\"10%\" | Number of stairways\n! width=\"10%\" | Comment\n|-\n|Temple A\n|Selinunte\n|Italy\n|\n|\n|2\n|\n|-\n|Temple of Bel\n|Palmyra\n|Syria\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Trajan's Column\n|Rome\n|Italy\n|\n|29.68 m\n|1\n|14 steps per turn\n|-\n|Column of Marcus Aurelius\n|Rome\n|Italy\n|\n|29.62 m\n|1\n|14 steps per turn\n|-\n|Baths of Caracalla\n|Rome\n|Italy\n|\n|\n|2\n|\n|-\n|Baths of Diocletian\n|Rome\n|Italy\n|\n|\n|4\n|\n|-\n|Round Temple at Ostia\n|Rome\n|Italy\n|\n|\n|1\n|\n|-\n|Santa Costanza\n|Rome\n|Italy\n|\n|\n|1\n|\n|-\n|Tomb of Galerius\n|Thessaloniki\n|Greece\n|\n|\n|2\n|\n|-\n|Imperial Baths\n|Trier\n|Germany\n|\n|\n|8\n|\n|-\n|Column of Theodosius\n|Constantinople\n|Turkey\n|\n|c. 50 m\n|1\n|Total former column height\n|-\n|St. Gereon's Basilica\n|Cologne\n|Germany\n|\n|16.50 m\n|1\n|\n|-\n|Column of Arcadius\n|Constantinople\n|Turkey\n|\n|c. 46.09 m\n|1\n|Total former column height\n|-\n|Basilica of San Vitale\n|Ravenna\n|Italy\n|\n|\n|2\n|A pair of stair towers\n|-\n|Gate of the Great Palace\n|Constantinople\n|Turkey\n|\n|?\n|?\n|Procopius (Pers. 1.24.43) refers to sortie down a spiral stairway\n|-\n|Sangarius Bridge\n|Adapazarı\n|Turkey\n|\n|10.37 m\n|1\n|Located in pier of triumphal arch at entrance of bridge\n|-\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Koldewey-Sicilien-vol2-table15-detail01.png|Plan of ground floor of the Greek Temple A at Selinunte.
