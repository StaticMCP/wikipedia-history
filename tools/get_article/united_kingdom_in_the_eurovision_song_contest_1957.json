The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, the second edition of Festival of British Popular Songs and, subsequently, the performer internally once the national final was over. This was the first-ever entry from the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the first-ever entry performed in English in the contest.\nBefore Eurovision\nFestival of British Popular Songs 1957\nThe United Kingdom was represented in the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in . The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) did not participate in the inaugural contest in , as it had created its own contest, the Festival of British Popular Songs, aspects of which influenced the 1957 Eurovision contest.\nThe Festival of British Popular Songs 1957 served as the selection for the United Kingdom's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1957. All British music publishing companies were invited to submit each one song for the national selection. Around 70 to 80 songs were reportedly submitted. A jury consisting of Jack Payne, Harry S. Pepper, Cyril Stapleton, Walter Ridley and Frank Lee met in December 1956 to select the competing entries of the live shows. The interpreting artists were chosen separately by the BBC production team.\nThe Festival of British Popular Songs 1957 consisted of three semi finals and a grand final. All shows took place in the King's Theatre, Hammersmith (West London). They were produced by Francis Essex. The presenter was David Jacobs, who would host many other British national finals the following years. Since the Festival of British Popular Songs 1956 was judged to be lacking effectiveness because it stretched over several months, it was decided that the 1957 edition would consist of weekly shows.\nSix songs competed in each semi-final. The songs were scored by ten regional juries, each consisting of twelve members of the general public. Each juror awarded one vote to their favourite song. Two songs in each heat advanced to the national final.\nSemi-finals\nThe first semi-final took place on 22 January 1957 at 19:45 GMT. The artists were accompanied by the Bill McGuffie Quintet and an orchestra under the musical direction of Eric Robinson. For the interval, Dennis Lotis performed \"Everybody Fall in Love With Someone\", the winning song of the Festival of British Popular Songs 1956. The ten regional juries in the first semi-final were from the cities of Birmingham, Aberdeen, Cardiff, Newcastle, Belfast, Manchester, Bangor, Bristol, Glasgow and London. The broadcast was watched by 6.8 million viewers in the United Kingdom.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:left\"\n|+Semi-final 1 – 22 January 1957\n! colspan=\"2\" | First performance\n! colspan=\"2\" | Second performance\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Song\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Songwriter(s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Place\n|-\n!\n!Artist 1\n!\n!Artist 2\n|-\n|1\n|The Keynotes\n|5\n|Lita Roza and Dennis Lotis\n|\"April Heart\"\n|John Watson\n|Eliminated\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:navajowhite\"\n|2\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Dennis Lotis\n|8\n|The Keynotes\n|\"Seven\"\n|\n|2\n|-\n|3\n|Marion Ryan\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\"The Teenage Waltz\"\n|Tony Osbourne\n|Eliminated\n|-\n|4\n| John Hanson\n|6\n|Janie Marden\n|\"There's a Place Called Paradise\"\n|\n|Eliminated\n|-\n|7\n|Marion Ryan\n|10\n|John Hanson\n|\"Turn Around and Face the Sun\"\n|\n|Eliminated\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:navajowhite\"\n|9\n|Lita Roza\n|colspan=\"2\"\n| \"The Way It Goes\"\n|Tony Osbourne\n|1\n|}\nThe second semi-final took place on 29 January 1957 at 21:00 GMT.

The ten regional juries in semi-final 3 were from the cities of Swansea, Glasgow, Plymouth, Leeds, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Aberdeen, Cardiff and London. The program was watched by 7.1 million viewers. The song \"Don't Cry Little Doll\" was subject to controversy since the songwriters had sold the copyright to a different music publisher before and it was not clear whether the song had been published before. Finally, it turned out that the song had only been on a test pressing and the BBC allowed the song to compete in the final.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:left\"\n|+Semi-final 3 – 5 February 1957\n! colspan=\"2\" | First performance\n! colspan=\"2\" | Second performance\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Song\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Songwriter(s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Place\n|-\n!\n!Artist 1\n!\n!Artist 2\n|-\n|1\n|The Ken-Tones\n|11\n|Shirley Eaton and Bill Maynard\n|\"Choose a Cosy Corner\"\n|\n|Eliminated\n|-\n|2\n|Lee Lawrence\n|7\n|Carole Carr\n|\"How Right You Were\"\n|\n|Eliminated\n|-\n|3\n|Shirley Eaton\n|9\n|Patricia Bredin\n|\"Hurdy Gurdy Joe\"\n|Tommie Connor\n|Eliminated\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:navajowhite\"\n|4\n|The Ken-Tones\n|8\n|Bill Maynard\n|\"Don't Cry Little Doll\"\n|\n|2\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:navajowhite\"\n|5\n|Patricia Bredin\n|10\n|Malcolm Lockyer\n|\"All\"\n|\n|1\n|-\n|6\n|George Mitchell Singers\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\"The Sycamore Tree\"\n|Hubert Gregg\n|Eliminated\n|}\nFinal\nThe final of the Festival of British Popular Songs 1957 was held on 12 February 1957 at 19:45 GMT.
