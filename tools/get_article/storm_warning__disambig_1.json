The winds must not be associated with a tropical cyclone. If the winds are associated with a tropical cyclone, a tropical storm warning will be substituted for the storm warning and less severe gale warning.\nIn US maritime warning flag systems, a red square flag with a black square taking up the middle ninth of the flag is used to indicate a storm warning (the use of two such flags denotes a hurricane force wind warning or a hurricane warning). The same flag as a storm warning is used to indicate a tropical storm warning.\nOn land, the National Weather Service issues a 'high wind warning' (Specific Area Message Encoding code: HWW) for storm-force winds, which also encompasses the lesser gale-force and greater hurricane force winds. In most cases, the warning applies to winds of 40-114 mph for at least 1 hour; or any gusts of 58–114 miles per hour on land unless a tropical storm warning, blizzard warning, winter storm warning, severe thunderstorm warning, or dust storm warning covers the phenomenon. Winds in excess of  will always result in new issuance of an extreme wind warning shortly before their onset, typically right before the eyewall of a major hurricane makes landfall, but possibly as a substitute for a severe thunderstorm warning in an extreme derecho event. The only exception is that if the extreme winds are associated with a tornado, a tornado warning (or more likely a tornado emergency) will be issued instead.\nWeather Warning Flags (United States)\nFile:Small Craft Advisory Flag (U.S).svg|Small Craft Advisory Flag\nFile:Gale Warning Flag (U.S).svg|Gale Warning Flags\nFile:Storm Warning Flag (U.S).svg|Storm Warning Flag\nFile:Hurricane Warning Flags (U.S).svg|Hurricane Warning Flags\nExample\nThe following is an example of a storm warning issued by the National Weather Service office in Seattle, Washington.\n246\nWHUS76 KSEW 180451\nMWWSEW\nURGENT - MARINE WEATHER MESSAGE\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SEATTLE WA\n851 PM PST SUN JAN 17 2010\nPZZ150-153-156-170-173-176-181300-\n/O.UPG.KSEW.GL.W.0087.000000T0000Z-100118T2300Z/\n/O.NEW.KSEW.SR.W.0003.100118T0451Z-100118T2000Z/\nCOASTAL WATERS FROM CAPE FLATTERY TO JAMES ISLAND OUT 10 NM-\nCOASTAL WATERS FROM JAMES ISLAND TO POINT GRENVILLE OUT 10 NM-\nCOASTAL WATERS FROM POINT GRENVILLE TO CAPE SHOALWATER OUT 10 NM-\nCOASTAL WATERS FROM CAPE FLATTERY TO JAMES ISLAND 10 TO 60 NM-\nCOASTAL WATERS FROM JAMES ISLAND TO POINT GRENVILLE 10 TO 60 NM-\nCOASTAL WATERS FROM POINT GRENVILLE TO CAPE SHOALWATER 10 TO\n60 NM-\n851 PM PST SUN JAN 17 2010\n...STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PST MONDAY...\nTHE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN SEATTLE HAS ISSUED A STORM\nWARNING...WHICH IS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON PST MONDAY.
