Both sides were had a significant  military presence nearby, in both Kef and Constantine. Although the idea of a peaceful settlement was embraced by both nations, on July 24, 1812, Algiers imposed a blockade of 19 sailboats on the port of La Goulette, situated in the northern part of Tunis. The imposition of the blockade was a manifestation of oppression against the Dey Hammuda ibn Ali, On August 10 the Admiral of Algiers, who was charged with the blockade, sent a letter from the Dey Hadj Ali in which he offered to sign a definitive peace treaty only if the Regency recognized the suzerainty of Algiers. Although the proposal was declined, Hammuda, who desired peace between the two nations, sent a cargo of oil to the Dey for the mosques in the capital.\nThe Algerian ships, still blockading the port, did not take any aggressive action for a couple of days. During that time  the port were increased and had been placed in a state of readiness. The Tunisian army had strengthened their defense In Kef and its surroundings. The border fortification was the idea of the Tunisian Prime Minister, Youssef Sahab et-taba, who recently took the command of the Tunisian army. On the other side of the border in Constantine, the Bey of Constantine, Mohammed Nàmane, gathered a huge quantity of ammunition and troops in the city as well. This proved to be unnecessary since the Algerians began the offensive in La Goulette.\nWar\nOn July 23, 1813, The Algerian navy bolstered its forces at the port of La Goulette, numbering 54 sailboats and 25 Gunboats. The Algerian force managed to deal considerable damage to the Fort, but was forced to retreat to Algiers on August 4 after suffering considerable damage. This would lead to a surprise invasion of the Beylik of Costantine.\nA couple of days later, Youssef launched an invasion of the Province but was pushed back by Nàmane, who successfully gathered enough troops to repel the Tunisians back across to the other side of the border. The two regencies suffered from terrible economic crises who were using all of their resources, all thought, The Tunisians were worried about the re imposition of the blockade or another invasion of Kef the following season. This led to the construction of another 60 Gunboats. On the Tunisian side however, Youssef managed to build a large army in Kef, with more than 40,000 Troops ready for the second invasion. The war finally ended in December 1813, when the old Hammuda Pasha agreed to a peace, before dying on September 15, 1814.\nReferences"
