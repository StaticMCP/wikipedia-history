Absolutely stream it. Overthinking with Kat & June is not only a fresh take on the awkwardness of adult friendship but it’s also a ton of fun. I understand there's no shortage of new content out there, but Overthinking with Kat & June is an absurdly funny comedy not to be missed.\" In another favorable critique, Metro US Andrew Husband described the series as \"an occasionally surreal blend of laugh-out-loud comedy and absolute cringe. From Kat and June's frequent fantasizing about their older landlord David to the former’s attempts to prepare the latter for a first date with the help of the twins Tessa and Molly, Overthinking can sometimes emphasize the \"over\" in its title. The thing is, it works so beautifully for this show and the kind of comedy it’s trying to accomplish.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
