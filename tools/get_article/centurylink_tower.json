At  and 11 stories tall, it is the tallest building in the state of South Dakota. Previously, the  Zip Feed Tower was the tallest building in the state.\nHistory and appearance\nThe building has had two different facades; initially it was of white stone, but structural issues that soon developed forced US West (later known as Qwest) to remove the outer facade and later install the present exterior. One portion of this building was actually constructed of brick and was the original telephone exchange building until its demolition in 2011 to make room for expanded parking.\nModern ownership\nThe building is now a dispatch center owned by CenturyLink.\nSee also\n*List of tallest buildings by U.S. state\nReferences"
