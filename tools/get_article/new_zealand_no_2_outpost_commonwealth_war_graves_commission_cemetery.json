      "text": "# New Zealand No.2 Outpost Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery\n\nNew Zealand No. 2 Outpost Cemetery is a small Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery containing the remains of some of the Allied troops who died during the Battle of Gallipoli.\nThe battles at Gallipoli were an eight-month campaign fought by British Empire and French forces against the Ottoman Empire in an attempt to force Turkey out of the war and to open a supply route to Russia through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea.\nThe NZEF Canterbury Infantry Battalion created No. 1 and 2 Outposts on 30 April 1915.  The 16th Casualty Clearing Station and the New Zealand Dental Corps clinic were established near No. 2  Outpost, which had a well.  Heavy fighting took place there at the end of May and it was later one of the jumping off points for the battle of Sari Bair. The cemetery is one long grave containing burials. Special memorials commemorate 31 casualties thought to be buried among them. Outpost No. 2 Cemetery is within 100 metres of it.\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
