At elevated altitudes, any cooking that involves boiling or steaming generally requires compensation for lower temperatures because the boiling point of water is lower at higher altitudes due to the decreased atmospheric pressure. The effect starts to become relevant at altitudes above approximately . Means of compensation include extending cooking times or using a pressure cooker to provide higher pressure inside the cooking vessel and hence higher temperatures.\nBoiling\nAt sea level, water boils at . For every  increase in elevation, water's boiling point is lowered by approximately 1°F. At  in elevation, water boils at just . Boiling as a cooking method must be adjusted or alternatives applied. Food will take longer to cook, or cannot be prepared at all depending on temperatures required.\nMethods used at high altitudes\nA pressure cooker is often used to compensate for the low atmospheric pressure at very high elevations. Under these circumstances, water boils at temperatures significantly below 100 °C and, without the use of a pressure cooker, may leave boiled foods undercooked. Charles Darwin commented on this phenomenon in The Voyage of the Beagle:\nBoiling point of pure water at elevated altitudes\nBased on standard sea-level atmospheric pressure (courtesy, NOAA):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!
