He painted the subject in tempera painting (89 × 128&nbsp;cm) and as a fresco (355 × 687&nbsp;cm) which is located in the music hall of Old Student House of Helsinki University.\nDescription\nThe fresco was donated to the Students' union by Otto Donner.\nThe theme for the painting is from the Kalevala, national epic of Finland. Kullervo sits on a white horse ready to ride to war, to take revenge on his uncle Untamo. He is followed by a dog or a wolf.\nGallen-Kallela traveled to Siena, Italy, where he likely saw the frescoes by Simone Martini in the Palazzo Pubblico. Martini's Equestrian portrait probably gave Gallen-Kallela inspiration for the setting of Kullervo.\nGallery\nReferences"
