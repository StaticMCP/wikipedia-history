It was also the B-side of the non-album single \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\".\nSynopsis\nThe song is a \"vengeful ballad\" whose lyrics are an allegory to describe the end of a relationship.\nCritical reception\nOn his book Abba – Uncensored on the Record, John Tobler said the song \"appeared to be much more personal than many of the group's previous songs\". The Sydney Morning Herald said \"The King Has Lost His Crown\" is \"an interesting song with some neat variations in style\". Internet reviewer George Starostin said it \"is simply way too pompous and ambitious to be endured\". ABBA biograph Carl Magnus Palm said \"Perhaps there's ... a sense of \"undiscovered gem\" about [Voulez-Vous], simply because what I feel were the best tracks were never international single A-sides, such as 'As Good as New', 'The King Has Lost His Crown' and 'If It Wasn't for the Nights'.\"\nReferences"
