The old convent of La Madre de Dios in Alcalá de Henares was chosen as location of the future museum in 1985 and, following works started in 1987, the museum was eventually opened on 25 May 1999.\nCollection\nThe museum exhibits some paleontological findings such as a skull of cave bear found in Patones in 1971, the biggest ever found in the Iberian Peninsula.\nThe part of the museum devoted to the Roman period includes a number of epigraphic pieces and an important collection of Roman mosaics from Complutum, the Roman-era Alcalá de Henares.\nFile:Machairodus aphanistus - Cerro de los Batallones - Museo Arqueológico Regional CAM.JPG|Skull of a Machairodus saber-toothed cat from the Cerro de los Batallones in Torrejón de Velasco\nFile:Pátera de Titulcia.JPG|Carpetan\nFile:Mosaico de Baco (Alcalá de Henares).jpg|Roman mosaic of Bacchus from Complutum\nFile:Olla (19826485532).jpg|11th-century pot from the Cava Baja in Madrid\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
