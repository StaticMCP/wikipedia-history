These were the first World Games, an international quadrennial multi-sport event, and were held in Santa Clara, California in the United States. The 640&nbsp;kg tug of war competition was the first event of the games, as it was held immediately following the opening ceremony at the same location, Buck Shaw Stadium. The Swiss athletes were associated with a club from Engelberg, while the United States was represented by a club from Orfordville, Wisconsin. In an interview during the Games, Albert Sabin, the chief judge of the event, revealed that he was from Birmingham, then hastened to add, \"England, not (Birmingham) Alabama.\"\nMedalists\nSources:\n{|\n|- bgcolor=\"DFDFDF\"\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| Men\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nTug of war, 640kg\nThe outdoor 640&nbsp;kg tug of war event was conducted on 24 July 1981.
