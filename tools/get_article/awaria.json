It revolves around a mechanic named Ula who, controlled by the player, fixes broken machines while avoiding female ghosts who she later kisses after each level.\nAwaria was released via Steam on December 16, 2024, and received positive reception.\nGameplay\nThe player controls a mechanic, Ula, who runs through the game's small top-down levels attempting to fix broken machines, while evading the attacks of increasingly aggressive ghost girls. Depending on the difficulty level, getting hit by a ghost's attack leads to a game over. If Ula manages to evade the ghosts and fix the machines, she can kiss the ghosts as a reward for beating each level.\nDevelopment\nAwaria is a stylistic follow-up to Piskorz's 2020 game Helltaker, though it is thematically and mechanically different. \"Awaria\" means \"mechanical breakdown\" or \"failure\" in Polish.\nThe soundtrack is composed by Mittsies, who had also scored Helltaker. The sound design is by Patryk Karwat.\nPiskorz distributes Awaria for free over Steam and itch.io for Windows, Mac and Linux computers.\nReception\nLike Helltaker, Awaria was well received by players, with 96% of Steam reviews positive following its release.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
