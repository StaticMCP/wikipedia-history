In the UK it was released as Live on the King Biscuit Flower Hour, and in 2003 it was re-released as Greatest Hits Live (see below).\nThe album was recorded on February 14, 1989, at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia during their In the Spirit of Things tour and featured performances by Steve Walsh and Steve Morse. Two tracks from the original performance were omitted from the release: \"Play the Game Tonight\" and a cover of \"Born to Be Wild.\" The liner notes include an extensive essay describing this era of the band and the circumstances surrounding the album and tour supporting it during which this show was recorded.\nThe same recordings have subsequently appeared on releases with different track order. In 2001, the same concert was released on the album Dust in the Wind by Disky Communications Europe (see below). It was also released on DVD-Audio format as From the Front Row Live, in a series of unclear licensing status and which apparently contained stereo sources attempted upmixed to multi-channel.\nTrack listings\n;King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Kansas and other versions releases by King Biscuit Flower Hour Records:\n#\"Magnum Opus\" (Kerry Livgren, Steve Walsh, Rich Williams, Dave Hope, Phil Ehart, Robby Steinhardt) – 2:12\n#\"One Big Sky\" (Howard Kleinfeld, Michael Dan Ehmig, Ehart, Walsh, Bob Ezrin) – 6:11\n#\"Paradox\" (Livgren, Walsh) – 4:11\n#\"Point of Know Return\" (Walsh, Ehart, Steinhardt) – 5:16\n#\"The Wall\" (Livgren, Walsh) – 6:04\n#\"All I Wanted\" (Walsh, Steve Morse) – 5:29\n#\"T.O.
