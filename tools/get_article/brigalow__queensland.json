In September 1862, the Queensland Government held a land sale of town, suburban, and country lots.\nMulga Provisional School opened in 1896. On 1 January 1909, it became Mulga State School. In 1914, it ceased to be a full-time school and became a half-time school in conjunction with Hill Top Provisional School (later Boonarga State School) with the two schools sharing one teacher. Mulga State School closed in 1915, but reopened in 1917 as a full-time school. It permanently closed in 1943. It was located on a L-shaped land parcel on the kink in Jones Road ().\nBrigalow Provisional School opened on 24 February 1908. In 1910, it became Brigalow State School.\nBrigalow Post Office opened by November 1912 (a receiving office, originally named Mulga, had been open from 1895) and closed around 1993.\nEhlma State School opened on 14 April 1913. It closed in 1965. It was on Ehlma Boundary Road () to the immediate north of the Ehlma railway station.\nThe Bethania Lutheran Church opened in Brigalow in 1914. It closed in 1961. Although the church building has been removed, its cemetery remains (and is now within the locality boundaries of Wychie).\nThe first wedding in the Brigalow Methodist Church was celebrated on 28 February 1923.\nBlackwood Provisional School opened on 19 July 1915 and closed on 27 October 1932. On 12 November 1932, the school was reopened and renamed Belah State School. It closed in 1962. In 1921, the school was on Inverai Road (). In 1938, the school was at 1249 Ehlma Boundary Road().

It was at 600 Brigalow Canaga Creek Road (), now in Wychie.\nThe Kogan Creek Power Station opened in 2006.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Brigalow and the surrounding area had a population of 457 people.\nIn the , the locality of Brigalow had a population of 170 people.\nIn the , the locality of Brigalow had a population of 181 people.\nEconomy\nThe Kogan Creek Power Station is a coal-fired power station in the south-west of the locality (). At 750 MW, it is the largest single unit in Australia. Construction by a consortium led by Siemens commenced in 2004 and was completed in 2007. It was opened by the Queensland Premier Anna Bligh and Minister for Mines and Energy Geoff Wilson on 27 November 2007.\nThe Kogan Creek coal mine is located to the south-east of the power station. It is an open-cut mine which supplies the power station with approximately 2.5Mt of coal each year.\nFrom the town to the south of locality is within petroleum leases held by Arrow CSG (Australia) and Australian CBM to extract coal seam gas. The extraction of coal seam gas within farming districts is controversial in Australia due to concerns that groundwater under prime grazing and cropping land could be contaminated. In April 2018 one operator in Hopeland (to the immediate west of Brigalow), Linc Energy, was fined $4.5 million in May 2019 for causing environmental harm through its underground coal gasification plant.\nIn the agricultural economy, there are a number of homesteads in the locality, including:\n* Allendale ()\n* Avonmore ()\n* Beltana ()\n* Bluebell Park ()\n* Eureka ()\n* Glencara ()\n* Greenacres ()\n* Heather Vale ()\n* Kalora ()\n* Laguna ()\n* Merina Park ()\n* Minie Vale ()\n* Oakbank ()\n* Quail Plain ()\n* Renbah ()\n* Riverlea ()\n* Shamrock Flat ()\n* The Shiralee ()\n* Wandella ()\n* Warra Warra ()\nEducation\nBrigalow State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls on the southern side of the Warrego Highway (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 52 students with 5 teachers (4 full-time equivalent) and 7 non-teaching staff (3 full-time equivalent).\nThere is no secondary school in Brigalow. The nearest government secondary schools are Chinchilla State High School (to Year 12) in Chinchilla to the north-west and Jandowae State School (to Year 10) in Jandowae to the north-east.\nAmenities\nBrigalow Public Hall is at 47-49 Warrego Highway ().\nBrigalow had three churches but all have now closed. The Brigalow Uniting Church (the last to close) was at 68 Mulga Street () and is now privately owned.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*  — includes Blackwood State School, Belah State School, Ehlma State School, Haystack State School, Mulga State School, Noola State School, and Wychie State School\nExternal links\n*"
