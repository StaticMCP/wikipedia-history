This book is set in Card's ''Ender's Game'' series and takes place during Ender Wiggin's time at Battle School as described in Card's novels ''Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow''.\nCharacters\nMorgan family\n*Zeck Morgan&nbsp;– the anti-hero protagonist.\n*Reverend Habit Morgan&nbsp;– Zeck's father\n*Unnamed&nbsp;– Zeck's mother\n*Unnamed&nbsp;– Zeck's three younger siblings\nWiggin family\n*Ender Wiggin\n*Peter Wiggin&nbsp;– Ender's older brother\n*Valentine Wiggin&nbsp;– Ender's older sister\n*John Paul Wiggin&nbsp;– Ender's father\n*Theresa Wiggin&nbsp;– Ender's mother\nStudents\n*Dink Meeker&nbsp;– Dutch boy\n*\"Rose de Nose\" Rosen\n*Filippus \"Flip\" Rietveld&nbsp;– Dutch boy\n*Bonzo Madrid\n*Ahmed&nbsp;– Pakistani (Muslim) student\nInternational Fleet personnel\n*Captain Brridegan\n*Agnes O'Toole&nbsp;– IF tester\n*Colonel Graff&nbsp;– Battle School commander\nLiterary significance and reception\nA War of Gifts was not particularly well received by genre critics.  The chief complaint with the story is that although it raises the issues of faith, religious freedom and religious suppression, it does so in a very superficial manner.  Some critics have also commented on the character of Ender Wiggin who is described as being too Christ-like to be believable. A Publishers Weekly review described it as \"an amusing and sincere tale\". Kirkus Reviews described the story as a \"Little League stocking stuffer that nevertheless makes several cogent points\".\n}}\nConnection to other parts of the Ender series\nIn addition to being set during ''Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow, the Islamic counter reaction to the Christmas celebrations in A War of Gifts sows the seeds for the creation of the Muslim Caliphate by Battle School graduates which plays a major role in the Shadow series.\nSee also\n*Ender's Game (series)\n*List of Ender's Game characters\n*Orson Scott Card bibliography\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hatrack.com/osc/bibliography/index.shtml Publication information for A War of Gifts'' available from Card's website]\n*"
