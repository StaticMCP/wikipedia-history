This was Turkmenistan's fifth presidential election and decided who would be the country's president for the next seven years. Incumbent President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow won with more than 97% of the vote, similar to the results of the 2012 elections.\nThe result was widely expected; although the election was nominally contested by nine candidates, all opposition candidates were appointed by the government and the elections were regarded by foreign organisations as not being a free and fair contest.\nBackground\nIn September 2016, the constitution was changed to remove term limits and the 70 year-old age limit for presidential candidates, as well as extending the presidential term from five to seven years.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Turkmenistan is elected using the two-round system.\nCandidates\nThe Democratic Party nominated the incumbent President, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, who won 97.14% of the vote in the previous elections. A total of 9 candidates were approved by the Central Election Committee. The opposition candidates' manifestos were published in the state-controlled mass media.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Party\n!Position\n|-\n|Maksat Annanepesow\n|Independent\n|Chairman of the State Food Industry Association\n|-\n|Jumanazar Annaýew\n|Independent\n|Deputy Head of Mary Region\n|-\n|Bekmyrat Atalyýew\n|Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs\n|Member of Parliament\n|-\n|Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow (Incumbent)\n|Democratic Party of Turkmenistan/Independent\n|President of Turkmenistan\n|-\n|Ramazan Durdyýew\n|Independent\n|Member of Parliament\n|-\n|Meretdurdy Gurbanow\n|Independent\n|Deputy Head of Daşoguz Region\n|-\n|Serdar Jelilow\n|Independent\n|Head of the Department of Economic Development, Akhal Region\n|-\n|Süleýmannepes Nurnepesow\n|Independent\n|Chief Executive of Garabogazsulfat\n|-\n|Durdygylyç Orazow\n|Agrarian Party\n|Head of Mary Region\n|}\nResults\nReferences"
