He is known for directing films \"set on a huge canvas while boasting of an opulent treatment\".\nHe is best known for helming the epic musical sports drama Lagaan (2001), the social drama Swades (2004) and the epic historical romantic drama Jodhaa Akbar (2008), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Director for Lagaan and Jodhaa Akbar.\nLagaan was nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film at the 74th Academy Awards, which makes him a voting member of the Academy Awards. He returned to acting by playing the lead role in the critically acclaimed comedy drama Ventilator (2016).\nEarly life\nGowariker was born into a Marathi-speaking family to Ashok and Kishori Gowariker, in Kolhapur. He is married to Sunita, Deb Mukherjee's daughter from his first marriage. They have two sons, Konark and Vishwang.\nCareer\nActor\nGowariker started his career as an actor, making his debut in 1984 in director Ketan Mehta's picture Holi. On the Holi sets, Gowariker met Aamir Khan with whom he later went on to collaborate on different film projects . After that, he acted in several television serials, including Kacchi Dhoop (1987), Circus (1989), C.I.D. (1998) and several films, including Naam (1986), Goonj (1989), Chamatkar (1992), and Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa (1993). He returned to acting by playing the lead role in the critically acclaimed Marathi comedy drama Ventilator (2016), which was produced by Priyanka Chopra. Allegedly, he took about 6 months to agree to do the film.\nDirector\nDebut\nGowariker made his directorial debut with the thriller Pehla Nasha (1993), followed by another thriller Baazi (1995), both of which received negative reviews upon release and emerged as commercial disasters at the box-office.\nWidespread success\nThe 2000's proved to be the golden period of Gowariker's career, during which he produced and directed three of his most popular films to critical and commercial success.\nHis first film of the new millennium was the epic musical sports drama Lagaan, produced by and starring Aamir Khan alongside debutante Gracy Singh. The film revolved around the people of a small village in Victorian India who stake their future on a game of cricket against their ruthless British rulers. It received positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise for its direction, soundtrack, performances of the cast, and its anti-imperialist stance. The film emerged as a commercial success, grossing  worldwide, ranking as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. Lagaan earned Gowariker his first Filmfare Award for Best Director and the Filmfare Award for Best Story, in addition to the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the Filmfare Award for Best Film. Lagaan was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film, being the third, and as of 2023 the last, Indian film after Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988) to be nominated for the award.\npose for a photo with the Vehicle Assembly Building, Kennedy Space Center in the background during filming for the movie Swades]]\nHe next screenwrote and directed the social drama Swades (2004) starring Shahrukh Khan and debutante Gayatri Joshi in lead roles. The story of the film revolves around an NRI project manager at NASA, who returns to India to discover the challenges faced by a rural village, and dedicates himself to their development, addressing issues of education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The film received rave reviews from critics upon release, with praise for its direction, story, screenplay, soundtrack and performances of the cast. However, despite pre-release hype and good critical reception, it emerged as a commercial failure at the box office. Swades earned Gowariker his second nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Director. However, over the years, the film has achieved cult status.\nGowariker's next screenwriting and directorial venture was the epic historical romantic drama Jodhaa Akbar (2008) starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai in lead roles. Set in the 16th century, the film depicted the life and romance between the Muslim Emperor Akbar of Mughal Empire and the Hindu Princess Jodhaa Bai of Amber, who married him on a political marriage. It opened to widespread critical acclaim upon release, with high praise for its direction, soundtrack, cinematography, costume design, choreography and performances of the cast. The film emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, grossing  worldwide, ranking as the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. Jodhaa Akbar earned Gowariker his second Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Director. The film was cited as \"10 Great Bollywood Films of the 21st Century\" by British Film Institute.\nGowariker's next venture was the romantic comedy ''What's Your Raashee? (2009) starring Priyanka Chopra (in 12 roles) alongside Harman Baweja. Based on the Gujarati novel Kimball Ravenswood'' by the playwright and novelist Madhu Rye, the film told the story of a Gujarati NRI who meets twelve potential brides, one from each zodiac sign, one of whom he must marry in ten days to save his brother from harm. It had its world premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics upon release, with praise for its soundtrack and Chopra's performance, but criticism for its screenplay, runtime and pacing. It emerged as a below-average grosser at the box-office.\nHis next venture was the historical action-adventure Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey (2010) starring Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone in lead roles. The film was based on Manini Chatterjee's Do And Die: The Chittagong Uprising 1930-34, an account of the 1930 Chittagong armoury raid. It opened to mixed-to-negative reviews from critics upon release, and emerged as a commercial disaster at the box-office.\nAfter a 6-year hiatus, Gowariker made his comeback with the period action-adventure Mohenjo Daro (2016) starring Roshan (in their second collaboration) alongside debutante Pooja Hegde in lead roles. Set in 2016 BC at the height of Indus Valley Civilisation, the film follows the story of a farmer who travels to the city of Mohenjo Daro,  challenges the city's elite and fights against overwhelming odds to save the civilization. It received negative reviews from critics upon release, and emerged as Gowariker's second consecutive commercial disaster at the box-office.\nHis next venture was the epic war drama Panipat (2019) starring Arjun Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Kriti Sanon in lead roles. The film depicts the events that took place during the Third Battle of Panipat. It received negative reviews from critics upon release, and emerged as Gowariker's third consecutive commercial disaster at the box-office.\nIn 2024 Gowariker served as chairperson of the international jury at the 55th International Film Festival of India held from 20 November to 28 November.\nFilmography\nDirector\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
