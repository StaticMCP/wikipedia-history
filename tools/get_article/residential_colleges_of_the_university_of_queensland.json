The college operates as an academic residential community of undergraduate and postgraduate members drawn from country and suburban areas throughout Australia as well as many other nations.\nKing's has a well-equipped gymnasium (including weights room and a cardio room), swimming pool, rowing shed and pontoon, tutorial/study rooms, Old Collegians Learning Centre, barbecue facilities, quarter basketball court and extensive well lit car-parks. The Junior Common Room is equipped with satellite television, billiard table and table tennis table.\nKing's College is well renowned for its Sporting and Cultural success. Having won the Old Collegians' Cup in 2018 for the 10th consecutive year has further cemented King's Colleges reputation as the 'sporting' college.\nSt John's College\n}}\n| full_name     = St John's College\n| motto_Latin   = Esolutus iterum vinctus\n| motto_English = Freed and Rebound\n| named_for     = St John the Evangelist\n| established   = 1911\n| warden        = Ms Rose Alwyn\n| president     = Samuel Crook (2025)\n| location      =\n| residents     = 322\n| gender        = Co-educational since 1990, formerly male only\n| homepage      = [http://www.stjohns.uq.edu.au/ Homepage][http://www.uq.edu.au/stjohns/HTML/OldJohnians.html Alumni Homepage]\n}}\nSt John's College is a co-educational residential college on the St Lucia Campus. St John's is the equal oldest college in affiliation with the university. The college was founded in 1911 – the same year The University of Queensland accepted its first students – and is currently home to approximately 300 students (colloquially known as 'Johnians' or 'Jabbers').\nFacilities include the Stanley Law Library, the general library, the Gibson Room for biomedical studies (anatomy and histology, speech therapy and physiotherapy). In the gymnasium, there is a weights room, and sauna, as well as a pool table. All undergraduate students also have access to the Junior Common Room. St John's College has a strong social atmosphere. The oldest book at the college library is a Jeremy Bentham text dating back to 1774.\nThe college has a strong sporting tradition. In 1996 it became the first College at The University of Queensland to win both the men's and women's Inter-Collegiate competitions in the same year. In 2013 St. John's College won both the male and female overall weighted sporting trophies. Since the inception of the ICC Competition, St John's College has won the Old Collegians Cup and the ICC Cultural Cup more times than any other college. In 2018 St John's became the first college since 2000 to win all five domains: Men's and Women's sporting, Men's and Women's weighted sporting, and the ICC Cultural Cup.\nMusic and drama are particularly strong at the college. There are seven pianos in the college and there are four specially built music practice rooms. A manual and pedal pipe organ was completed in the college chapel in 1994. In 2018 a Harpsichord was added to the college chapel. The choir performs at College functions and in the intercollegiate choral festival. Students from St John's and Women's Colleges perform an annual production. Choral Scholarships are offered by the college.\nThe college also has a Jazz Club which plays at the annual Jazz Night hosted by the student club, alongside the John's band Who Is John? and alumni bands such as The Eaglets who played in 2017. There is also speculation of a lesser-known subsidiary band of Who is John?, Kazoo is John.\nThe 'slab' is a monumental section of the college, of which only a few select students know of the location.\nSt John's College is also thought to be associated with the initiation of the long-standing tradition whereby males, and choice females, drop their pants whenever the song Eagle Rock is played. The tradition is thought to have originated from a small group of mining engineering students from UQ who resided there.\nThe College Anglican Chapel hosts musical events throughout the year, with an organ which has been played by organists such as Michael Faulkner. The chapel hosts an original artwork which was commissioned for the St. John's College chapel as a celebration of its jubilee at St Lucia, Brisbane, where the university relocated. The piece, Earth Creations, is similar to Regeneratation (1972) held at the University House, Australian National University chapel. The college also hosts 9 prints of the 10 piece series The Journey, also by Leonard French, which are held in University House ANU's dining hall.\nIn 2005, Edale wing was burned down in a fire apparently caused by unattended electrical devices left on by a student over the Easter break.\nThe college is very multicultural with students from Japan, New Zealand,and the UK.\nThe College provides tutorials, mainly taught by current and past Johnians. About $240,000 in scholarships yearly. The highest proportion of international students after IH and Grace, with 16% of the college in 2017 being international.\nSt Leo's College\n}}\n| full_name      = St Leo's College\n| motto_Latin    = Dominus Illuminatio Mea\n| motto_English  = The lord is my light\n| named_for      = St Leo the Great\n| established    = 1917\n| sister_college = Duchesne College\n| rector         = Steve Foley\n| president      = Finbar Rasmussen (2024)\n| location       = St. Lucia\n| residents      = 212\n| gender         = Men only\n| homepage       = [http://www.stleos.uq.edu.au/ Homepage][http://www.stleos.uq.edu.au/contact// Alumni Homepage]\n}}\n'''St Leo's College''' is a residential College on the St Lucia Campus of the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.\nHistory\nSt Leo's was founded by Brisbane's Catholic Archbishop Sir James Duhig in 1917 and is named in honour of St Leo the Great – the first Pope Leo (440 AD to 461 AD).\nThe book The Memory was compiled, and written by Fr Michael Head SJ, a former homogeneous of the college.  It provides an entertaining and in depth history of the college from its inception to the mid-1990s.\nThe college celebrated its centenary in 2017.\nThe college operates a catering business.\nSporting life\nThe college has a sporting tradition covering a wide range of athletic pursuits. Through the Inter College Competition (ICC), College teams participate in thirteen sports including football, cricket, tennis, squash, hockey, basketball and others, while the tennis/basketball court is the scene for inter-block competition and casual challenges.\nThe college performs well in all sports despite its relatively small size (approximately 210 students compared to about 300 at rival colleges); however, St Leo's is one of only two male-only residential colleges at the university.  Traditionally strong sports include rugby, athletics, tennis, cricket and touch football, while basketball, cross country and athletics have enjoyed a resurgence during recent year. St Leo's won the ICC Sports Cup (referred to at St Leo's as \"The FG Cup\") in 2008 after leading King's College all year. Before 2008, St Leo's last won the Cup in 1986 – behind by a handful of ICC points when starting athletics (the last event in the ICC calendar), Simon Doyle later a world ranked 1500m runner, stormed home in the final leg of the 400m relay for Leo's to clinch the Cup.\nBefore rugby was introduced to ICC, rugby league was the winter contact sport. In the seven seasons from 1978 to 1983, St Leo's won 54 of 56 games, drew one 2-all and lost one game (to Emmanuel) 2-nil. Unsurprisingly, in 1984 the other colleges voted to change to rugby union. Emmanuel College, the only college ever to beat Leo's at Rugby League, voted (unsuccessfully) with Leo's to retain league, earning the friendship and respect of Leo's through the 80s and 90s.\nSince 2001, the St Leo's College Open's Rugby Team has lost only 11 games on the back of an unbroken winning streak which stretched from 1992 till the 2001 Grand Final (the longest unbroken winning streak by any team in Queensland). Following this defeat, St Leo's would reclaim the Cup in 2002, and go on to win the Cup again in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Rugby is considered to be primary sport at St Leo's, as surmised in 2001 by Andrew \"Chook\" Hanrahan, the St Leo's College Sports Convenor for that year, who was quoted as saying \"Leos is Rugby\".\nDespite this emphasis on rugby, St Leo's does excel in other sporting fields. The college performs well in a multitude of sports despite its relatively small size (approximately 175 students compared to about 300 at rival colleges); however, St Leo's and King's College are the only two male-only residential colleges at the university. Despite St Leo's not winning the coveted ICC Sports Cup since 1982 (another record), it continues to be one of the top-tier Colleges for sport in Queensland. In 2007, St Leo's came within 2 points of winning the ICC Cup and in July 2008, the college won the 2008 ICC Sports Cup on the back of a historic win in the 2008 Rugby Final against Kings the Francis & Kassulke Cup.\nA gymnasium is available for residents and the college's on-campus location provides easy access to all of the university's sporting facilities.\nSocial life\nStudents at St. Leos college participate in a wide variety of social activities, within the University of Queensland. The student club run many parties on campus, including Tropicana, St Patrick's Day Boat Cruise, Back to School, ICC Regatta After Party and Mexicana.\nCultural life\nResidents are active in a full range of cultural activities, including debates, public speaking, and music.\nThe Student Club conducts the Annual Duhig Lecture  in the second semester of the university calendar. Notable speakers of have included John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, Peter Beattie, Premier of Queensland, Malcolm Fraser, former Prime Minister of Australia, Peter Garrett, politician and former musician, Chris Masters journalist and Alan Jones  (radio broadcaster and one-time Wallabies coach).\nRectors of the college\n* Steve Foley 2014\n* Br Vince Skelly cfc 2004–2013\n* Lt Col John Long (retired) 2001–2003\n* Fr William Uren SJ AO 1998–2000\n* Fr Gregory Jordan SJ 1992–1997[http://www.campion.edu.au/our-people/honorary-fellows Honorary Fellows]\n* Fr Michael Head SJ 1991\n* Fr Gerry Healy SJ 1989–1990\n* Fr Vincent Hurley SJ 1977–1988\n* Fr Brian Fleming SJ 1967–1977\nNotable alumni\n* Bob Katter, Sr.\n* Bob Katter\n* Robbie Katter\n* Hugh Wirth AM.
