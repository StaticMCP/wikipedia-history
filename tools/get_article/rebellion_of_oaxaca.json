That is, the main actors during the independence movement were army officers, militias and representatives of the town hall based in Antequera .\nCall for unity\nIn Oaxaca, despite the fact that the executive branch and the Congress called for the formation of a new Congress with more broad powers that constituted the nation under the indirect election system, assigning a deputy to every 50 000 inhabitants or to the fractions that After 40,000, the latter was not well received. During the War Board in Oaxaca, 72 people participated, of which few were from the Army and militias, predominantly General Antonio de León.\nRebellion\nWith this measure most of the provinces returned to calm, however, the Oaxaca government returned the call decreed in accordance with general opinion and decreed a provincial government, the people rose in arms and proclaimed their independence from Mexico as \"Free and Federal State of Oaxaca\". For this reason, the provisional government decided to resort to military force to quell the uprising as was done with the Guadalajara Rebellion, achieving calm after its taking.\nAftermath\nThe draft declaration of independence supported by merchants was not distinguished by its liberal characteristics, but the struggle to achieve what they had been seeking since the introduction of the intendancies in 1786. Independence would mean the return to the powerful position they held before senior Crown officials came to control the Oaxaca province.\nReferences\n* RIVA PALACIO, Vicente (1940).
