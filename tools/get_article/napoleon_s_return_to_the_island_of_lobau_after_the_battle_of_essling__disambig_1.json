It depicts a scene from the War of the Fifth Coalition, part of the wider Napoleonic Wars. After his defeat at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon returned to the island of Lobau where the French wounded from the battle lay. The River Danube is in the background. Shown with Napoleon are his chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier and his bodyguard Roustam Raza as well as the surgeon Dominique Jean Larrey. In July Napoleon would decisively defeat the Austrians nearby at the decisive Battle of Wagram.\nThe painting was commissioned by Napoleon for the Luxembourg Palace. It was displayed at the Salon of 1812 at the Louvre. In 1835 during the July Monarchy it was transferred to the Palace of Versailles.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo.
