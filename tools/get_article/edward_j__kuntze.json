In 1852 he came to the United States and, devoting himself to his art, achieved a reputation, and was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1869. Among his works are statuettes of William Shakespeare, Johann von Goethe, Washington Irving, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Abraham Lincoln; a statue of \"Psyche,\" one of \"Columbia,\" \"Puck,\" \"Puck on Horseback,\" and \"Puck on the Warpath\"; a bust of \"Mirth\"; \"Merlin and Vivien,\" in bas-relief; and many medallion portraits and busts.
