Konard I controlled the town before transferring it to the knights of Order of Dobrzyń in 1237. How the castle came under Konrad I's control or when is still a subject of debate. Dobrzyń knights were tasked with \"fighting Prussian heathens\" and the growing crusader influence in the Baltics could also threaten the south-western lands of the Kievan Rus'.\nBattle\nOn March 1238, Prince Danylo was ready to recapture the castle. This castle was an important Eastern trade route and was prepared to employ trickery against the knights of the castle. In addition, Mongol troops were besiging Kozelsk which forced Danylo to take quick approach to unify his principality. Danylo managed to get the knights out of the castle where he had an advantage. The battle took place outside of the castle's walls, its course was determined by efficiency of Danylo's cavalry. As a result, all knights were either killed or captured. The  Dobrzyń detachment likely didn't exceeded 200 knights, but this battle proven to be devastating to their existence. Some scientists believe Dobrzyń knights didn't hold much importance and were doomed to be gone eventually.\nAftermath and legacy\nFor Daniel of Galicia, the capture of Drohiczyn allowed him to unify the Volyn principality and he later established relations with Konrad I of Masovia. Apart from now owning the castle, Danylo now eliminated the crusader threat to south-western Rus' lands. However, some historians reduce the significanсe of this battle to a border skirmish.\nSoviet assessment\nDuring 1937–1938, Soviet propaganda used Danylo's conflict with the Order of Dobrzyń to encourage militancy among Soviet population against German aggression in the East. On July 7, 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
