This tensile membrane structure allows diffused light through into the arena reducing the need for artificial lighting. The light weight of the fabric also reduced the amount of steel required and saved on building costs. Brisbane-based company MakMax Australia (Taiyo Membrane Corporation) supplied and installed this roof along with other smaller outdoor structures at this venue.\nIt has twenty-three International Tennis Federation standard tennis courts, including the centre court and two showcase courts, representing all playing surfaces (hardcourt, clay and grass).\nThe centre court Pat Rafter Arena, named in honour of the Australian tennis player Patrick Rafter, has a seating capacity of 5,500 (with an extra temporary seating of 1,500 bringing total capacity to 7,000).\nDavis and Fed Cup fixtures\nThe Queensland Tennis Centre has hosted several ties in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup representative tournaments.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!width=\"100\"|Tournament\n!Year\n!width=\"200\"|Winning nation\n!width=\"200\"|Losing nation\n!width=\"125\"|Tie score\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ededed\" |Davis Cup\n| 2010 ||  Australia || Japan ||5–0\n|-\n| 2017 ||  Australia || United States||3–2\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ededed\" |Fed Cup\n| 2014 ||  Germany || Australia ||3–1\n|-\n| 2016 ||  United States || Australia||4–0\n|-\n| 2019\n| Australia\n|Belarus\n|3–2\n|-\n| 2024\n| Australia\n|\n|4–0\n|}\nSee also\n* List of tennis stadiums by capacity\n* List of indoor arenas in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112429/http://www.tennisattennyson.com.au/prop_dev.htm Details of Development] (archived)\n*"
