A 2021 study of fatal dog attacks in Europe during the period 1995–2016 placed the United Kingdom (with 56 fatalities) as fourth in the top five countries for number of human fatalities alongside Hungary (#1), France (#2), Romania (#3), and Poland (#5). The study also found that fatal dog attacks have been increasing significantly over time which was not attributable to the increase in the number of dogs, and stated \"The numbers of fatalities are indeed a very small tip of the 'dog attack iceberg', and the number of dog attacks that lead to hospitalizations of the victim outnumber fatalities by several orders of magnitude.\"\nSome fatalities and serious attacks have been followed by calls to increase dog regulations. There was a push to limit the number and gross weight of dogs that a dog walker could legally handle at one time after dog walker Natasha Johnston lost control of her eight dogs in 2023, resulting in a witness being bitten, spooking a horse causing its rider to fall, and Johnston's mauling death.[https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39nx1mmj7lo Coroner calls for dog-walking limits after death]. BBC. 4 November 2024. An increasing number of serious dog attacks (both fatal and non-fatal) was the catalyst for the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, which led to four breeds being banned: Pitbull, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro. Between 2021 and 2023, around half of fatal dog attacks were caused by a single breed, the American Bully XL, and in December 2023, they were the first breed to be added to the act since 1991, making it illegal in England and Wales to sell, breed, abandon, or give away a Bully XL, to possess one without a Certificate of Exemption, or to have one in public without a lead and muzzle.\nBelow is a list of human deaths caused by dogs reported by the news media, published in scholarly papers, or mentioned through other sources. In the lists below, the dog type or breed is assigned by the sources.

Circumstances\n|-\n|\n|Michek Cecil Franciss\n|1\n|Male\n|Alsatian (7)\n|Harlesden, London, England\n|Francis was in the garden of his grandparents' home where he was attacked by dogs owned by his uncle. The subsequent inquest was told the dogs were in poor condition and had been kept in a confined space. A verdict of accidental death was recorded.\n|-\n|\n|Amy Victoria Bourne\n|data-sort-value=0.0137|5 days\n|Female\n|Jack Russell (1)\n|London, England\n|Five-day-old Bourne was found dead in her carrycot with skull perforations and fractures caused by dog bites.\n|-\n|\n|Kellie Lynch\n|11\n|Female\n|Rottweiler (2)\n|Argyll, Scotland\n|While on holiday, Lynch was mauled by two prize-winning Rottweilers. The victim was walking the dogs with a friend when the attack took place, as they had done several times before. The victim's friend, a girl of twelve, tried to save her life, but to no avail. The dogs had never shown any aggression before the attack and were both put down.\n|-\n|\n|William Roach\n|38\n|Male\n|Alsatian (1)\n|Rusholme, Manchester, England\n|Roach was savaged to death by his pet dog as his wife tried to rescue him.\n|-\n|\n|David Parry\n|9\n|Male\n|Great Dane (1), Alsatian (1), Lakeland Terrier (1)\n|Leighton Buzzard, England\n|Parry was killed by his family's three pet dogs in the garden of the family's pub. The three dogs were subsequently put down at the request of the father.\n|-\n|\n|Dean Parker\n|7\n|Male\n|Pit bull mix (1)\n|Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England\n|The dog, being walked by two unsupervised boys, aged seven and ten, broke free of its lead and leapt at a snowman being built by Parker and his eight-year-old friend, Edward Davies. The dog then attacked Parker, biting through his jugular vein. He died from the injuries inflicted to his neck.\nWhen attacked, Parker screamed and struggled in an attempt to frighten off the dog, but this did not succeed; an expert later testified at the inquest that, given the dog's breed, this behaviour by Parker was counterproductive, and that the dog would only have been willing to let him go once he stopped screaming and resisting. Davies attempted to pull the dog off Parker, but was unable to do so. Early reports called the dog a mastiff cross-breed, but at the inquest, it was deemed largely a pit bull.\nThe victim's father stated that the dog \"was well known on the estate as being very dangerous before it attacked Dean\".\n|-\n|\n|Ashley Wilson\n|data-sort-value=0.083|1 month\n|Female\n|Bull terrier (1)\n|Preston, Lancashire, England\n|A dog attack just before Christmas; a bull terrier savaged a month-old baby girl. The infant had been lying in a bouncing chair by her mother's feet when the dog, named Dodger, suddenly grabbed the baby by the head. Despite being taken to the Royal Preston Hospital, the victim died two hours later from brain injuries. The dog was put down at the request of the family.\n|-\n|\n|David Kearney\n|11\n|Male\n|Rottweiler (2 or 3)\n|Darwen, Lancashire, England\n|Kearney was attacked two days before Christmas after climbing a fence to fetch his football. The boy was so badly mutilated, that his mother did not recognise him. He died two weeks after hospital admission and having a leg amputated to prevent gangrene. Two dogs involved in the attack, named Sam and Jet, were put down at the owner's request; he kept the other two dogs he owned.\nThe CPS declined to prosecute the dogs' owner, but the jury at Kearney's inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing.\n|-\n|\n|Margaret Crisp\n|76\n|Female\n|Bull Terrier\n|Mead Road, Leckhampton, England\n|Crisp was attacked in the garden of her home by her grandson's dog, which broke her neck, and was later shot dead by police at the scene. No prosecution took place because the dog was determined not to be a banned breed.\n|}\n2000–2009\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Date !! Victim's name\n!Victim's age\n!Victim's gender!! Dog type (Number)\n!Location!! class=unsortable|Circumstances\n|-\n|\n|Kirsty Ross\n|25\n|Female\n|Doberman (1)\n|Helston, Cornwall, England\n|Ross had had an epileptic seizure and her dog, named Frentzen, attempted to pick her up by the scruff of the neck as a mother dog would lift a puppy. There was no evidence of a 'savaging' of the victim, and the victim's 22-month-old daughter was in the same room unharmed. The dog was euthanised.\n|-\n|\n|George Dinham\n|45\n|Male\n|Staffordshire Bull Terrier (1)\n|London, England\n|Dinham was found dead in his home, mauled to death by his dog, Ben, possibly after an epileptic seizure. Neighbours claimed the same dog attacked a child a few months before, though it was suggested that the dog might have merely jumped at the girl, and the scratches sustained were from falling over. The victim and dog were said to be inseparable, and the dog was known to nip at his owner to bring him around from seizures before. The dog was later put down.\n|-\n|\n|Liam Eames\n|1\n|Male\n|American Bulldog (1)\n|Leeds, West Yorkshire, England\n|The family's two dogs were normally kept outside, but Liam's father, Christopher (who was at work at the time of the attack) had let them in because it was hot outside. Liam's mother, Jacqueline, was sitting with him on the floor when he crawled towards the dog and it attacked him.\nJacqueline was unable to free the baby and the dog only let go once the family's other dog intervened, at which point she ran outside with the baby shouting for help. The child was pronounced dead an hour later from head and neck wounds.\nThe dog, named Missy, had been acquired from a rescue, and had a \"nervous temperament,\" but was otherwise fine around the children. It was seized along with the family's other dog and was slated to be euthanised. The other dog was returned to the family.\n|-\n|\n|Cadey-Lee Deacon\n|data-sort-value=0.417|5 months\n|Female\n|Rottweiler (2)\n|Leicester, East Midlands, England\n|Deacon was attacked when her mother and her partner were moving furniture in the living quarters of a pub. The two guard dogs, which were usually kept in a kennel on the pub's roof, entered through a fire escape door that was left open for 15 minutes and took the unsupervised five-month-old baby from her Moses basket and out to the roof where they mauled her. The dogs, Bruno and Bessie, were owned by the partner's mother (the licensee of the pub) and were put down soon after the incident.\nThe pub where the attack took place was located opposite a primary school. Local residents familiar with the dogs described them as \"very aggressive\", \"powerful\", and \"vicious\", and said people were scared to walk their children past the pub to school, as they feared the dogs would jump down from the roof and attack.\n|-\n|\n|Ellie Lawrenson\n|5\n|Female\n|American Pit Bull Terrier (1)\n|St Helens, Merseyside, England\n|Lawrenson's grandmother, after smoking ten cannabis joints and drinking two bottles of wine, let the 75-pound dog inside the house where it attacked and killed the girl. The victim received 72 separate injuries, mostly to her head and neck, and the floor was \"awash with blood\" when police arrived. The dog was shot dead at the scene by a police marksman.\nThe dog, named Reuben, had a reputation locally for aggression. It weighed 34&nbsp;kg, spent its time bouncing on a trampoline in the back garden while carrying large pieces of wood, and was described by a dog specialist within the Met as \"fantastically well conditioned\" and of \"immeasurable power\". Previously, the dog had attacked the victim's aunt without provocation, leaving her needing stitches to her leg, and, on a separate occasion had attacked a Jack Russell Terrier.\nKiel Simpson, the victim's uncle and owner of the dog, was jailed on possession of an illegal dog and banned from keeping dogs for five years. The grandmother was charged with manslaughter but was acquitted. Almost 200 banned dogs were surrendered the following month when Merseyside Police offered an amnesty.\n|-\n|\n|Archie-Lee Hirst\n|1\n|Male\n|Rottweiler\n|Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England\n|Hirst was being carried by a seven-year-old girl when the dog attacked, wrenching the boy from her arms. He was dragged into the garden of his grandparents' house and mauled. Though the victim's aunt attempted to fight the dog away, the victim was 'savaged to death'. Both the victim's parents were at a neighbour's house and didn't witness the incident. The two-and-a-half-year-old female dog was shot dead by police at the scene. The grandparents had only acquired her six months prior and had not walked her for five months, according to testimony at the inquest. According to a consultant, the dog was kept in the back yard and did not have enough mental stimulation, which may have caused it to become aggressive.\n|-\n|\n|James Rehill\n|78\n|Male\n|Rottweiler\n|Newham, London, England\n|Rehill was taking the dog for its morning walk when he fell over in the street. At first, the dog licked and pawed its owner. Subsequent events, and Rehill's cause of death, are disputed.\nInitial media reports, based on eyewitness accounts, asserted that the dog attacked, tearing chunks of flesh from his face, and that this was what caused Rehill's death. The dog only let go once sprayed with a fire extinguisher and was then shot by the police.\nPer other witness accounts, the dog was merely trying to help the owner, not attacking him. Furthermore, a post-mortem revealed that he had had a stroke immediately before his collapse, and his inquest ruled that his death was due to natural causes.\nThe RSPCA complained that the ruling that he had died of natural causes did not get as widely reported as the initial \"attack\" had been, and cited the case as an example of a broader phenomenon that initial media reports about dog attacks are unreliable.\nRehill died at the Royal London Hospital. He had owned the dog for ten years, and it had allegedly never acted aggressively before.\n|-\n|\n4 February 2009 †\n|Stephen Hudspeth\n|33\n|Male\n|Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n|Bishop Auckland, County Durham, England\n|Hudspeth was bitten on the elbow while walking to work and later died from septicaemia.\n|-\n|\n| Jaden Joseph Mack\n| data-sort-value=0.25|3 months\n| Male\n|Staffordshire Bull Terrier (1), Jack Russell Terrier (1)\n| Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly, Wales\n|The two dogs dragged three-and-a-half-month-old Mack off a table while his grandmother was taking a nap, and attacked him. The grandmother discovered the dead baby and was shrieking, drawing attention from a neighbour who came over to see what was going on. The neighbour said the baby had severe injuries to his neck and was dead. Both dogs were said to have previously acted friendly towards the infant. Both dogs were put down.\n|-\n|\n|Andrew Walker\n|21\n|Male\n|Alsatian (2)\n|Blackpool, Lancashire, England\n|Walker was one of two men who were trying to separate two dogs that were fighting in their backyard. Both dogs turned on the victim, who received 51 bites in the attack and lost four pints of blood. The dogs were euthanised at the request of the owner, who was known to have owned dangerous dogs before. His previous Rottweilers had attacked a woman and killed her poodle, but he was not banned from owning animals.\n|-\n|\n21 September 2009 †\n|Damian Holden\n|35\n|Male\n|Weimaraner (1)\n|Wales\n|While Holden was trying to put up a tent during a camping holiday with his wife and son in Wales, his dog, Eric, nipped his hand. (The coroner would later rule that the nip had no \"malicious intent\" behind it.) Holden developed sepsis as a result of a virus in the dog's saliva, suffered multiple organ failures, had his feet amputated, and finally died three months later in hospital in Crewe, Cheshire.\n|-\n|\n|Jon Paul Massey\n|4\n|Male\n|Pit Bull Type (1)\n|Liverpool, England\n|Massey was attacked in his house by a large dog. His grandmother tried to protect him, sustaining injuries herself. The dog, named Uno, was shot in the front garden by responding police. It had been reported that they were breeding dogs at the house.\nChristian Foulkes, the victim's uncle and owner of the dog, pleaded guilty to three counts under the Dangerous Dogs Act and was jailed for four months. He was found to be breeding pit bulls. The victim's grandmother admitted one charge of keeping a dangerous dog and was given a four-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, and was banned from owning a dog again.\n|}\n2010–2019\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The grandmother, who was present, was not strong enough to remove the dog. Two workmen from next door pulled the child and dog apart, but the child died in hospital. The dog's owner wasn't charged with manslaughter due to insufficient evidence but was convicted of keeping a banned Dogo Argentino (a second dog), and was prohibited from keeping dogs for five years. Both dogs were put down.\n|-\n|\n18 August 2010 †\n|Lesley Banks\n|51\n|Female\n|Rottweiler (1)\n|Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England\n|Banks was bitten by her dog, Brannigan, while loading him into a car, and refused to seek medical treatment for the bite out of fear that Brannigan, who had previously saved her life by waking her during a fire, would be put down as a result. She developed septicaemia and died two days after the bite. The dog was put down.\n|-\n|\n|Barbara Williams\n|52\n|Female\n|Neapolitan Mastiff (1)\n|Wallington, Sutton, England\n|Williams was attacked and killed by her partner's pet mastiff, suffering multiple injuries and a severe haemorrhage to her head and neck. The dog, named Debo, was shot dead by police marksmen, and a pit bull puppy named Ruby (a banned dog) was seized and later euthanized. The dogs' owner was ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and pay costs of £3,340, and was banned from owning any animal or having anything to do with keeping or transporting animals.\nThe owner's neighbour had previously called the police and local council about the dog after it smashed the fence between the two properties.\n|-\n|\n29 January 2012 †\n|Leslie Trotman\n|83\n|Male\n|Pit bull type (1)\n|Brentford, West London, England\n|Trotman was attacked in his garden by his neighbour's escaped dog, suffering bite wounds and injuries from being knocked over. He died six days later from a ruptured spleen. The dog's owner was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and three dogs were seized.\n|-\n|\n|Gary Dickinson\n|57\n|Male\n|Terrier\n|Sturry, Kent, England\n|Dickinson was nipped by his pet terrier and the wound became infected. When Dickinson's partner first took him to hospital for treatment, the on-call GP at Kent and Canterbury Hospital misdiagnosed his symptoms as food poisoning and sent him home. Dickinson later suffered septic shock due to the infection and died three days after the bite. The dog was rehomed.\n|-\n|\n| Gloria Knowles\n| 71\n| Female\n|Bordeaux Bulldog (2), American Bulldog (1), Mongrel (1)\n| Morden, South London, England\n|Knowles was attacked and killed by her daughter's dogs when she went to feed them.

Her friend briefly left, leaving Lomas-Anderson alone in the house, when four of her friend's five dogs attacked her. The dogs, Buddy, Neo, Ty and Sky were shot dead by police. Their owner was given a 16-week suspended prison sentence for animal cruelty.\n|-\n|\n|Clifford Clarke\n|79\n|Male\n|Presa Canario x Bull Mastiff (1)\n|Liverpool, England\n|Clarke was attacked in his garden. He was dragged around and had one arm chewed off at the elbow. The 70&nbsp;lb dog, which had not been fed for roughly 48 hours before the attack, was so aggressive it bit at the end of the officer's gun; it was shot twice and killed. The dog's owners were charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act, were both jailed for a year, and banned from keeping dogs.\n|-\n|\n|Lexi Branson\n|4\n|Female\n|Bulldog type or Aylestone Bulldog (1)\n|Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, England\n|Branson was home from school, sick, when the dog, named Mulan, attacked her, going straight for her throat. The mother repeatedly stabbed the dog with a kitchen knife. A post-mortem revealed Branson died from facial injuries and the dog preventing the girl from breathing. The family got the dog from a rehoming centre two months prior; it was originally a stray that had been through several owners since 2007.\n|-\n|\n|Emma Bennett\n|27\n|Female\n|Pit bull (2)\n|Osmondthorpe, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England\n|Pregnant mother-of-four, Bennett, died after she was attacked by the animals, named Bella and Dollar, at her home in Leeds. She died the next day. Lee Horner, the victim's partner and owner of the dogs, pleaded guilty to owning dogs prohibited by the Dangerous Dogs Act and was ordered at Leeds Magistrates' Court to do 280 hours of unpaid work. The court heard he had threatened to set one of the dogs on two female social workers months before the fatal attack. He was banned from keeping dogs for life and ordered to pay £800 costs.\n|-\n|\n|Barry Walsh\n|46\n|Male\n|Staffordshire Bull Terrier (1)\n|Westcliffe-on-Sea, Essex, England\n|Walsh was mauled by his girlfriend's dog, Gypsy, after a domestic incident. The \"highly protective\" dog bit him 42 times, broke five of his ribs, and ruptured his spleen. The circumstances were unclear; Walsh's girlfriend alleged he slapped her and picked up and threatened Gypsy, but she changed elements of her story during the investigation and again during the inquest, and the police investigator complained she never gave a coherent account. The coroner recorded an open verdict, stating that \"We will never, ever, know or ever be entirely clear what happened\".\n|-\n|\n|Ava-Jayne Corless\n|data-sort-value=0.917|11 months\n|Female\n|Pit bull terrier (1)\n|Blackburn, Lancashire, England\n|Corless was attacked and killed by a 126&nbsp;lb dog as her mother lay sleeping with her boyfriend, the dog's owner. The 126&nbsp;lb dog was determined to be a pit bull terrier by experts and a veterinary surgeon and was put down after the attack. The dog's owner was jailed for 18 weeks and prohibited from owning dogs for five years after he was found guilty of owning a prohibited breed. The dog was named Snoop, but was known in the neighbourhood by the name \"Killer\", as it killed a neighbour's cat two years prior.\n|-\n|\n|Eliza-Mae Mullane\n|data-sort-value=0.0164|6 days\n|Female\n|Alaskan Malamute (1)\n|Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, Wales\n|Mullane's mother left the sleeping six-day-old baby in her pram inside the house while she stepped out to put her son in a taxi for school. One of the family's two pet dogs had entered the room and the baby was on the floor. The dog involved in the attack, an Alaskan Malamute, was seized and put down; the other dog, a collie-cross, was also euthanised.\n|-\n|\n|Irene Collins\n|73\n|Female\n|German Shepherd (1)\n|Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England\n|Collins was repeatedly bitten when police let loose a 98-pound police dog to locate a suspected drug dealer on the run. She suffered multiple bites and a broken arm from falling during the attack. She had lung cancer and emphysema and died four days after the attack. The pathologist said her death was hastened by the bites. The dog, which had eleven prior biting incidents, was put down. Cleveland Police changed their policy on acquiring dogs, now requiring bite records.\n|-\n|\n|Andrew Russell\n|90\n|Male\n|American Bulldog (1)\n|West Calder, Scotland\n|Russell, a pensioner with a zimmerframe, stepped in to protect his wife after an American Bulldog pounced on her. The dog turned on him and ripped the flesh from his arm, exposing bone, before bystanders came to his aid. He initially made good progress in hospital but deteriorated and died a month after the attack. The inquest found no clear cause of death and did not rule out death by natural causes.\n|-\n|\n|Louise Caygill\n|43\n|Female\n|Staffordshire Bull Terrier (1)\n|Liverpool, England\n|Caygill was found in her flat, dead from multiple dog bites. The dog, which had bitten and injured her arm on a previous occasion as well as biting and hospitalising another man, was seized and put down. A neighbour overheard her shouting at her dog to get down and let go of her, but didn't intervene because this was a common occurrence.\n|-\n|\n|Molly-Mae Wotherspoon\n|data-sort-value=0.5|6 months\n|Females\n|American Pit Bull Terrier (1)\n|Daventry, Northamptonshire, England\n|Six-month-old Wotherspoon was attacked when the family's pit bull terrier (banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act) broke free from its cage. The child had injuries to all four limbs and puncture wounds to her brain. The dog, named Bruiser, was put down at the scene. The victim's mother and grandmother were both sentenced to two years and prohibited from owning any dog for ten years.\n|-\n|\n|Rhona Greve\n|64\n|Female\n|American Bulldog (1)\n|Ely, Cardiff, Wales\n|Greve, who had heart disease, suffered cardiac arrest and died after being bitten on the neck and face by her grandson's dog.
