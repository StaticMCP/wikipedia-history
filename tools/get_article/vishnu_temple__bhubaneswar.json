The temple faces west and the Sanctum is used for storage purposes. The sculptural embellishment on the outer wall and the parsavadevatas in raha niche suggests that the temple was originally dedicated to Vishnu.\nThe Temple\nThe temple is estimated to have built during the 12th century AD with Rekha deul topology.\n* Surrounding: The Temple is surrounded by Bindusagara tank in the west at a distance of 8.00 metres across the road, Ananta Vasudeva Temple in the north at a distance of 10.00 metres, Ananta Vasudev bhogamandapa in the east at a distance of 1.00 metres and local shops in the south.\nArchitecture\nThe talajangha is carved with a series of khakhara mundi pilasters and bandhana has three mouldings without any carvings.
