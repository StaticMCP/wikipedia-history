As of the 2020 census, the population was 36,251. The county seat and only incorporated place is Waycross. Ware County is part of the Waycross, Georgia micropolitan statistical area.\nHistory\nWare County, Georgia's 60th county, was created on December 15, 1824, by an act of the Georgia General Assembly from land that was originally part of Appling County.\nThe county is named for Nicholas Ware, the mayor of Augusta, Georgia from (1819–1821) and  United States Senator who represented Georgia from 1821 until his death in 1824.\nSeveral counties were later created from parts of the original Ware County borders:\n* Bacon County (from portions of Appling, Pierce, and Ware counties in 1917)\n* Charlton County (from portions of Camden and Ware county in 1854)\n* Clinch County (from portions of Lowndes and Ware counties in 1850)\n* Coffee County (from portions of Clinch, Irwin, Telfair, and Ware counties in 1854)\n* Pierce County (from portions of Appling and Ware counties in 1857)\nWare County was home to Laura S. Walker (1861–1955) a noted author and conservationist. Walker promoted a comprehensive program of forestry activity, including the establishment of forest parks. She erected markers and monuments along old trails and at historic sites, in Waycross and Ware County so that local history would not be forgotten. Walker wrote three books about the land and history of her home. They are: History of Ware County, Georgia About \"Old Okefenåok\" and Doctors of Primitive Times and Horse and Buggy Days of Ware County.\nAn effort to recognize her work culminated in President Franklin D. Roosevelt issuing a proclamation to establish the Laura S. Walker National Park, located in Ware County, in her honor. She was the only living person for whom a state or national park was named. In 1937, the federal government purchased distressed farmland for the park. Work on the park was undertaken by the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1941, the national park was deeded over to Georgia, becoming the State's 13th state park.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (1.7%) is water.
