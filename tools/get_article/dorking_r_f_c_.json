The club currently play in the fourth tier (National League 2 East) of English club rugby.\nAbout\nWith over 700 active registered players, the club runs four senior sides and is a home-club to many internationals such as Elliot Daly, George Kruis, and Kay Wilson; a ladies team, and a large youth section aged between 5 and 18.\nThe club holds a fierce local derby with Old Reigatian RFC\nHistory\nDorking RFC was founded in 1921 with a single team; a second team followed in 1928. The club ceased to play in 1940 due to the demands of World War II.  It was re-established in 1946, initially with a single team, but grew rapidly as 2nd (1947), 3rd (1948) and 4th (1954) teams were formed.\n), pictured in 2006]]\nThe club moved to The Big Field in Brockham in 1972 when it was granted a 50-year lease by the National Trust. This was extended with another 50-year lease in 2011.\nThe first youth team&nbsp;&ndash; Dorking Schoolboys XV&nbsp;&ndash; was formed in 1951 with a single team of 13- to 18-year-olds. By 1965 this had grown to the point of splitting into three age banded teams. A mini section (for girls and boys aged 6&ndash;12) followed in 1980 and the first ladies team in 1988. Dorking youth teams have twice triumphed in the National under-17 cup, winning the main competition in 2007 and the Shield in 2012.\nThe 1st XV was promoted to the RFU National Leagues (National League 3 London & SE) in 2009 and at the end of the 2013–14 season won promotion to National League 2 South, finishing fourth in 2014–15, their highest league position to date. However the 2015–16 season saw the club lose many players such as hooker Ross Grimstone to Richmond F.C. & scrum half Will Crow to Rosslyn Park F.C. who represented the England Counties side in a game against Romania in the summer prior to the end of 2014–15. The Club spent a number of years at Level 5, before winning promotion back to National 2 in 2022. In recent years, the club has seen a number of new faces join the senior section with the AXV following the 1st XV in a promotion into the Raging Bull Shield. The Women's XV currently compete at Level 6 of the League system in NC3.\nCurrent standings\nJohn Douglas Youth Development Fund\nThe official launch of the [http://dorkingrfc.com/john-douglas-youth-development-fund/ John Douglas Youth Development Fund] took place on Wednesday 15 March 2017.
