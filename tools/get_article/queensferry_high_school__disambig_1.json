It was opened in 1970 by Princess Margaret marking the 900th anniversary of the arrival of Queen Margaret in Queensferry. Currently it has 1036 students, predominantly from Echline Primary School, Queensferry Primary School,  Dalmeny Primary School and  Kirkliston Primary School. It was made a School of Ambition in 2007.\nSchool life\nThe main school building viewed from the back grounds.Upon enrolment at the school, the pupils are assigned to a house: Dundas, Hopetoun, Rosebery or Forth. The three original houses are named after three noble families in and around Queensferry: the Earls of Rosebery, seated at Dalmeny House; the Earls of Hopetoun, seated at Hopetoun House; and the Stewart-Clark baronets, seated at Dundas Castle. The recently created house, Forth, is named after the river upon which Queensferry sits.\nA school uniform was reintroduced in 2005. It consists of black trousers or a black or tartan skirt, with a white shirt, a black jumper or sweater and a tie bearing the school's registered tartan \"The Ferry Fling\". Blazers are optional for junior students, and 'required' for senior students.\nLeadership\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ QHS Headteachers\n|-\n! Name !!

In 1995 a recreation wing was added, with a substantial extension to the school being added in 1997 and a total refurbishment being undertaken in 1998. In early 2016, plans to start building a new school were unveiled. The building started early 2018 and was finished mid-2020.\nAcademic records\nThe table below shows the fourth year pass rates at Level 3 (Standard Grade Foundation level or equivalent) or better, Level 4 (Standard Grade General level or equivalent) or better and Level 5 (Standard Grade Credit level or equivalent) or better for Queensferry High School in the 2006/2007 academic year, contrasted with pass rates for Edinburgh and Scotland as a whole.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

On 15 December 2005 pupils were locked in their classrooms for two hours and told to stay away from windows and out of corridors after a man with a gun threatened to commit suicide in a house opposite the school. Armed police closed off the surrounding area and arrested the man without any injury to anyone.\nIn the early hours of 22 February 2008 the school was petrol bombed by three former pupils, blowing out an external wall at the back of the school and destroying a ground floor English classroom. No one was harmed as no one was in the school at the time.\nCoat of arms\nThe school's coat of arms was granted by the Lord Lyon in 1970. It features the cross and martlets from the arms of St Margaret (the queen for whom Queensferry was named), plus the primroses from the arms of Neil Primrose, Earl of Rosebery.\nNotable alumni\n* Stephen Hendry (born 1969), snooker player\n* Paul Appleby (boxer) (born 1987), boxer\n* Callum Paterson (born 1994), footballer\n* Michael Travis (born 1993), footballer\n* Cammy Logan (born 2002), footballer\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.queensferryhigh.co.uk Official Queensferry High School website.]\n*[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scottishschoolsonline/schools/queensferryhighschooledinburghcity.asp Scottish Schools Online Profile.]"
