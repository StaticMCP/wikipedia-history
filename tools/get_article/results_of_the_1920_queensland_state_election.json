In electorates with 3 or more candidates, preferences were not distributed if a candidate received more than 50% of the primary vote.\nIf none received more than 50%, all except the top two candidates were eliminated from the count and their preferences distributed between the two leaders, with the one receiving the most votes declared the winner.\nResults by electoral district\nAlbert\nAubigny\nBalonne\nBarcoo\nBowen\nBremer\nBrisbane\nBulimba\nBundaberg\nBuranda\nBurke\nBurnett\nBurrum\nCairns\nCarnarvon\nCharters Towers\nChillagoe\nCook\nCooroora\nCunningham\nDalby\nDrayton\nEacham\nEast Toowoomba\nEnoggera\nFassifern\nFitzroy\nFlinders\nFortitude Valley\nGregory\nGympie\nHerbert\nIpswich\nIthaca\nKennedy\nKeppel\nKurilpa\nLeichhardt\nLockyer\nLogan\nMackay\nMaranoa\nMaree\nMaryborough\nMerthyr\nMirani\nMitchell\nMount Morgan\nMundingburra\nMurilla\nMurrumba\nMusgrave\nNanango\nNormanby\nNundah\nOxley\nPaddington\nBy-elections\n* This by-election was caused by the resignation of John Fihelly.
