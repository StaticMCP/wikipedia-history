Until 2014, the ceremony was officially known as the Good for Her Feminist Porn Awards.\nHistory\nholding a 2007 Feminist Porn Award for her work Chemistry (2007)]]\nGood For Her founded the Feminist Porn Awards with the intent to celebrate work that complicates dominant representations of desire, desirability, sexuality and gender. The ceremony was originally conceived of and coordinated by former store manager Chanelle Gallant, and it has been organized by current store manager Alison Lee since 2008. Both the store and the ceremony are based in Toronto, Ontario, and the ceremony commonly takes place at Berkeley Church. Despite the name of the ceremony, Lee states that the films featured at the awards (as well as the ceremony itself) are meant to appeal to men as well as women.\nWinners at the FPAs are awarded trophies in the shape of butt plugs.\nCriteria\nAccording to the official website, nominations for an FPA are dependent upon three criteria:\n#Women and/or traditionally marginalized people were involved in the direction, production and/or conception of the work.\n#The work depicts genuine pleasure, agency and desire for all performers, especially women and traditionally marginalized people.\n#The work expands the boundaries of sexual representation on film, challenges stereotypes and presents a vision that sets the content apart from most mainstream pornography.  This may include depicting a diversity of desires, types of people, bodies, sexual practices, and/or an anti-racist or anti-oppression framework throughout the production.\nSee also\n* Gender equality\n* Feminist art movement\n* Feminist pornography\n* Feminist views of pornography\n* Sex-positive feminism\n* Sex-positive movement\n* Women's erotica\n* Women's pornography\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
