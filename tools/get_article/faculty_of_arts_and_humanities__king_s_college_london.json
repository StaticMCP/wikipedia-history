The original Arts departments such as War Studies and Geography formed part of the Faculty known now as Social Science & Public Policy while the Arts & Humanities expanded from its 'classical' humanities roots. Over the past few years, the Faculty has established interdisciplinary programmes such Liberal Arts and led new developments in teaching and research, for instance through the Department of Digital Humanities, Department of Culture, Media & Creative Industries.The School of Arts & Humanities became the Faculty of Arts & Humanities in 2014.\nIn 2023, the Digital Futures Institute and the Global Cultures Institute were launched as part of a new Faculty vision to showcase how arts and humanities expertise were addressing some of society's most pressing challenges.\nDepartments\n: lyric poet Sappho (fronting) and dramatist Sophocles (back turned)]]\nThe following departments and centres can be found in the Faculty of Arts & Humanities:\n* Classics\n* Culture, Media & Creative Industries\n* Digital Humanities\n* English\n* Film Studies\n* History\n* Languages, Literatures and Cultures\n* Interdisciplinary Humanities\n* Music\n* Philosophy\n* Theology & Religious Studies\nNotable people\nCurrent Professorial staff\n* George Benjamin, Henry Purcell Professor of Composition\n* Francisco Bethencourt, Charles Boxer Professor\n* Fay Bound Alberti, Professor in Modern History\n* David Carpenter, Professor of Medieval History\n* Julia Crick, Professor of Palaeography and Manuscript Studies\n* Kate Devlin, Professor of Artificial Intelligence & Society\n* Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History\n* David Edgerton, Hans Rausing Professor of the History of Science and Technology\n* Paul Gilroy, Professor of American & English Literature\n* Paul Joyce, Samuel Davidson Professor of Old Testament/Hebrew Bible\n* Paul Readman, Professor in Modern British History\n* Martin Stokes, King Edward Professor of Music\nFormer academic staff\n* Roderick Beaton, Koraes Professor of Modern Greek & Byzantine History, Language & Literature\n* Harrison Birtwistle, British contemporary composer\n* Averil Cameron, Warden of Keble College, Oxford, Professor of Late Antique and Byzantine History in the University of Oxford, and Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford\n* A.
