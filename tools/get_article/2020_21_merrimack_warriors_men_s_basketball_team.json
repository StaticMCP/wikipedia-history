The Warriors, led by fifth-year head coach Joe Gallo, played their home games at Hammel Court in North Andover, Massachusetts as second-year members of the Northeast Conference (NEC).\nPrevious season\nThe Warriors finished the 2019–20 season 20–11, 14–4 in NEC play to finish as NEC regular season champions. In doing so, they became the first program in NCAA men's basketball history to win an outright conference regular season title in its first season of Division I reclassification. However, due to their transition from Division II to Division I, they were ineligible to participate in the NEC tournament, and aren't eligible to do so until 2024. They were a candidate for an invitation to the 2020 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. However, the CIT, and all postseason tournaments, were cancelled amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n* Micky Burtnyk ()\n* Phil Gaetano ()\n|roster_url=https://merrimackathletics.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/2020-21\n|accessdate=December 19, 2020\n}}\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| Northeast Conference regular season\n|-\nSource\nReferences"
