Prior to this she was called Palace Lady Han ().\nBiography\nAncestry\nBiography\nIn 1357 (6th year reign of Gongmin of Goryeo), she was chosen as the concubine of him and in the 1371, she was declared as the legal mother of Monino, the only son of King Gongmin. However, in 1374, it was falsely referred as the rebirth of the Han clan. Later, on November in the same year, she was posthumously honoured as Queen Sunjeong (; \"the Serene and Silent Queen\") and received her full Posthumous name along with her orientation in Hyemyeong Hall ().\nIn September 1376 (2nd year reign of King U of Goryeo), she was buried in Uireung Tomb (), Jeongneung-dong, Yeoreung-ri, Jungseo-myeon, Gaepung-gun, foot of Bongmyeong Mountain, west of Gaeseong which the location is corresponds to the west of Hyeolleung (현릉, 玄陵; King Gongmin's tomb) and Jeongneung (정릉, 正陵; Queen Indeok's tomb). However, in December 1389 (1st year reign of Gongyang of Goryeo), the tomb was abolished.\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Choi Jung-won in the 2005–2006 MBC TV series Shin Don.\nReferences"
