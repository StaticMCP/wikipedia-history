These awards \"recognizing extraordinary accomplishment in film\" are presented annually by the Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association (DFWFCA), based in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex region of Texas. The organization, founded in 1990, includes 28 film critics for print, radio, television, and internet publications based in north Texas. The Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association began presenting its annual awards list in 1991.\nThe Social Network was the DFWFCA's most awarded film of 2010 taking top honors in the Best Picture, Best Director (David Fincher), and Best Screenplay (Aaron Sorkin) categories. This continued a trend of critics groups across the United States giving their top prizes to the film about the founding of Facebook.\nTwo films each took two top prizes: 127 Hours garnered a Best Actor nod for James Franco as real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston plus Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak for Best Cinematography. The Fighter earned Christian Bale the Best Supporting Actor honor for his performance as real-life boxer Dicky Eklund and Melissa Leo the Best Supporting Actress award for her portrayal of Dicky's mother, Alice Eklund.\nThe other acting award went to Natalie Portman as Best Actress for her leading role in Black Swan. The remaining film honors went to Toy Story 3 as Best Animated Film, Waiting for \"Superman\" as Best Documentary, and Mexico's Biutiful as Best Foreign Language Film.\nAlong with the 11 \"best of\" category awards, the group also presented the Russell Smith Award to ''Winter's Bone as the \"best low-budget or cutting-edge independent film\" of the year. The award is named in honor of late Dallas Morning News film critic Russell Smith.\nWinners\nWinners are listed first and highlighted with boldface. Other films ranked by the annual poll are listed in order.
