He was an early member of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference and played a significant role in several political movements and most importantly, at the grassroot levels.  He was an active participant inthe Quit Kashmir Movement and was incarcerated. Later he became active in the Cooperative Movement in the region and organized Forest Labourers into a cooperative society in 1949. He established National High School in Shopian ( which was amalgamated with Government Higher Secondary School by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1951). He led the agitation for Shopian District Status and was again incarcerated.  He was awarded Tamra Patra by Indian Government in 1972 for his contribution to freedom movement.\nEarly life and background\nSaraf was born in 1907 to Pandit Vasudev Saraf in Kashmir. He initially worked as a Patwari (village revenue official) but resigned after physically resisting brutal revenue collection methods. He then dedicated his life to organizing poor peasants across Kashmir against injustice.\nPolitical activism\nIn 1939, Saraf joined the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference. In 1941, he was arrested for propagating anti-monarchical ideas and was appointed a member of the party’s General Council in the same year. During the Quit India Movement of 1942, he provided shelter to underground Congress leaders including Dina Nath Keskar.\nIn 1945, he established the National High School in Shopian to promote education in rural Kashmir.\nPandit Swaroop Nath Saraf played a significant role in the political awakening of Kashmir during the mid-twentieth century. He was closely associated with the Quit Kashmir Movement of 1946, a mass civil disobedience campaign led by the National Conference against the autocratic rule of Maharaja Hari Singh. Following the government's suppression of the movement, Saraf was arrested along with Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, G. M. Sadiq, and Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad. He was subsequently imprisoned in Central Jail, Srinagar, where several prominent political leaders and activists were detained for their participation in the agitation.\nAfter his release from imprisonment, Saraf continued to participate actively in public affairs and social reform in Jammu and Kashmir. He remained committed to the principles of democracy, communal harmony, and social justice that had guided his earlier activism. Saraf became a vocal advocate for the political rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and contributed to several civic and educational initiatives aimed at uplifting the local community. His post-movement engagement reflected his lifelong dedication to building a more inclusive and progressive society in the region.\nLegacy\nPandit Swaroop Nath Saraf is remembered among the early Kashmiri leaders who played a pivotal role in shaping the region’s political consciousness during the struggle against autocratic rule. His contributions to the Quit Kashmir Movement and his lifelong commitment to democratic and social reform earned him recognition as a respected figure in Jammu and Kashmir’s political history. Although less widely known than some of his contemporaries, Saraf’s dedication to public service and community development continues to be acknowledged in historical accounts of Kashmir’s freedom movement.\nImprisonment and emergency government\nIn 1946, Saraf was arrested for his participation in the Quit Kashmir Movement led by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. He was imprisoned in Srinagar, Jammu, and later in Kathua, where he reportedly suffered severe physical abuse that permanently damaged his health. He remained incarcerated for over a year and was placed under house arrest upon his release in 1948.\nLater, he served as an Emergency Officer in the interim government of Sheikh Abdullah, where he managed relief and resettlement for migrants from Rajouri who had fled during the Kabali Raider invasion. As Emergency Administrator, he also ordered the detention of Ghulam Mohammad Shah, Abdullah's son-in-law, for alleged disregard of authority.\nSocial work and later years\nIn 1949, Saraf founded the Forest Labour Society in Shopian and played a pivotal role in the Cooperative Movement in Kashmir. He worked alongside prominent figures like Abdul Sattar Ranjoor, Pandit Sarwanand Koul \"Premiji\", and Mirza Qadir Beig.\nDespite his contributions, he was not granted a mandate to contest elections in 1951, allegedly due to his Hindu background. In 1972, he was awarded the Tamra Patra by the Government of India on the 25th anniversary of India's independence.\nShopian agitation\nIn 1979, Saraf led a mass agitation demanding district status for Shopian under the banner of the All Parties Action Committee. The protest lasted three years and became the longest-running agitation in post-independence India at the time. During this movement, a young man named Suresh Qandhari was killed in police firing. Saraf and several others were again arrested. After his release, locals honored him with the title Baba-e-Shopian (Father of Shopian).\nFinal years and death\nFollowing the rise of militancy in Kashmir in 1990, Saraf migrated to Jammu. He died in exile in 1991, largely forgotten by the political establishment and the people he had served.\nLegacy\nPandit Swaroop Nath Saraf is remembered by many in the Kashmir Valley for his commitment to secularism, grassroots political activism, and selfless social service. Though he never held high political office, his behind-the-scenes efforts helped shape the political and social fabric of South Kashmir.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://autarmota.blogspot.com/2013/01/shopian-new-district-of-our-state.html Autarmota Blog on Shopian]\n* [https://youtube/AVlu3rccvHE Oral history video on YouTube]\n:Category:Indian independence activists from Jammu and Kashmir\n:Category:Kashmiri people\n:Category:1907 births\n:Category:1991 deaths\n:Category:People from Shopian district\n:Category:Indian social reformers"
