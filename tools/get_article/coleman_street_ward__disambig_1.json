In the 1130 survey, Coleman Street Ward is thought to correspond to Warda Haconis.\nThe ward contains areas both outside and inside the line of the City's former defensive walls. There was no local gate through the wall until Moorgate, previously a small postern, was built in 1511. Abraham Cowley's 1661 Restoration comedy The Cutter of Coleman Street refers to the area.\nIt appears that the area outside, the once very marshy Lower and Little Moorfields (now mostly occupied by Finsbury Circus and the surrounding buildings), previously part of the Soke of Cripplegate and then the Manor of Finsbury, was added in the 17th century, though it was not developed until 1817.\nThe Walbrook, known at this point as Deepditch and running on the line of modern Blomfield Street, formed the eastern boundary of Lower Moorfields and the line continues to form the eastern boundary of the part of the ward lying north of the former wall, with the extra-mural ward of Bishopsgate Without lying east of the brook, and the road which now covers it. This section of the Walbrook, around Blomfield Street, was the focus of the phenomena of the Walbrook Skulls, resulting from the immense quantities of Roman-era human heads that were deposited in the river. These are still regularly uncovered during building work.\nPost 2003 ward\nColeman Street borders six other wards and occupies an irregular shape of land bounded to the north by Chiswell Street and Eldon Street; to the east by Blomfield Street, Copthall Avenue and a section of Moorgate; to the south by Lothbury and Gresham Street; and to the west by Basinghall Street, Coleman Street itself, Moor Lane and Silk Street.\nPolitics\nColeman Street is one of 25 wards in the City of London, each electing an alderman to the Court of Aldermen and  commoners (the City equivalent of a councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City are eligible to stand. The Alderman is Peter Estlin and the Common Councilmen are Michael Cassidy, Sophie Fernandes, Stuart Fraser and Andrew McMurtrie.\nWarren Stormes Hale, Lord Mayor of London in 1864, was the ward's most notable civic dignitary.\nFeatures\n, in the north of the ward, is the largest public park in the City]]\nchurch.]]\nColeman Street is a one-way road that runs from Gresham Street to London Wall. The church of St Stephen Coleman Street used to stand at the southern end of the street, on the western side, until it was completely destroyed in the Blitz and was not rebuilt. In the 17th century, St. Stephen's became a Puritan stronghold. On the night of 5 January 1642, after the king's failed attempt to arrest them, five MPs, Pym, Hampden, Haselrig, Strode and Holles, hid on Coleman Street utilising the support for parliament that tended to be afforded by sympathisers in the City of London.\nAt the northern end of the street stands the livery hall of the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers, and the pineapple-shaped headquarters of Legal & General.\nDespite the bustle of business, the ward also contains the City’s \"finest oasis of calm\",\nFinsbury Circus, an elliptical square with its own bowling club, is located within the ward, as is Moorgate station.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110704191227/http://217.154.230.195/NR/rdonlyres/6B39A5C9-A367-47FD-99F2-96B3A481BC3F/0/colemanstreet.jpg City of London Corporation] Coleman Street ward boundaries (2003 —)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111003161430/http://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/render_page.php?id=COLE2&title=Coleman%20Street%2F Map of Early Modern London:  Coleman Street Ward] - Historical Map and Encyclopedia of Shakespeare's London (Scholarly)\n* [http://www.colemanstreet.org/ Coleman Street Ward Club] - A Social Club based in the City of London"
