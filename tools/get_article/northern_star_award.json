It is awarded by a panel of journalists, with the vote taking place in December. It was first awarded in 1936, named in honour of Lou Marsh, a prominent Canadian athlete, referee, and former sports editor of the Toronto Star. The trophy is made of black marble and stands around 75 centimetres high. The words \"With Pick and Shovel\" (the name of Marsh's long-running Star column) appear above the engraved names of the winners. The voting panel consists of sports media voters from across the country including representatives from the Toronto Star, The Canadian Press, FAN590, The Globe and Mail, CBC, Rogers Sportsnet, CTV/TSN, La Presse and the National Post.\nThe award has been awarded 80 times and won by 63 individual athletes and three pairs; in the voting for the 2018 Lou Marsh Trophy, it was decided in the future pairs should not be eligible for the trophy, thereby disqualifying Tessa Virtue / Scott Moir from consideration. Wayne Gretzky won the trophy four times, more than any other athlete, while Barbara Ann Scott won the trophy three times, more than any other woman. It was not awarded from 1942 to 1944 due to World War II.\nThere were ties between different athletes in 1978 and 2020 with soccer player Alphonso Davies & American football player Laurent Duvernay-Tardif as the most recent co-winners. In 1982, Rick Hansen was the auxiliary award of special merit winner (he won nine gold medals at the Pan-American Wheelchair Games) alongside first-time winner Wayne Gretzky, \"who was the unanimous choice of the selection committee\".\nOn November 16, 2022, it was announced the award would be renamed from the Lou Marsh Award to the Northern Star Award \"after concerns were raised about racist language used by Marsh, who died in 1936, during his years of sportswriting.\"\nWinners\n, 1990 winner]]\n, 1996 winner]]\n, 1995 and 1997 winner]]\nand David Pelletier, 2001 winners]]\n, 2003 winner]]\n, 2004 winner]]\n, 2005 winner]]\n, 2007 and 2009 winner]]\n, 2010 and 2017 winner]]\n, 2016 winner]]\n, 2020 winner]]\n;Key\n* * = Also won the Lionel Conacher Award as Canadian male athlete of the year\n* ^ = Also won the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award as Canadian female athlete of the year\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Fox was awarded for the Marathon of Hope; Duvernay-Tardif was awarded for opting out of playing in the 2020 NFL season for the Kansas City Chiefs after winning Super Bowl LIV to work as an orderly at a long-term care facility during the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
