He was credited with five aerial victories, all against German fighter planes.\nWorld War I service\nHaight scored his victories in just over a month, from 28 September through 30 October 1918 flying a Spad.\nBetween the World Wars\nPostwar, Haight pursued a career in the U.S. Flying Service although he interrupted his employment at some point for approximately six years. He flew as an airline pilot in Central America, and having maintained his military reserve force commission was recalled to Active duty for World War II.\nWorld War II and beyond\nDuring World War II, he rose to the rank of colonel and briefly commanded Randolph AFB in 1942. In 1950, having been culled from the officer's ranks he chose to enlist as a noncommissioned officer rather than leave the military; this allowed him to complete his 30 years for retirement. He retired on 3 May 1954 at Randolph AFB, after serving four years as a master sergeant in the School of Aviation Medicine.\nRelation\nHis son 2nd Lt Edward Haight was Missing in action on 18 July 1944 during World War II.\nSee also\n* List of World War I flying aces from the United States\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Over the Front: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914-1918.
