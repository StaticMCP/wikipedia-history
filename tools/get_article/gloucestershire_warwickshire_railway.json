The most recent extension to Broadway (completed in 2018) involved the company raising £1.38 million. The 28-mile return trip on steam and heritage diesel trains follows part of the route of the former Great Western main line from Birmingham to Cheltenham. There is a long-term aim of extending a further  from Broadway to the national rail network at .\nOverview\nThe line was originally part of the Great Western Railway's Cheltenham–Stratford-upon-Avon–Birmingham line, known as the Honeybourne Line, built in 1900–1906, and runs through the Cotswold towns of Winchcombe and Bishop's Cleeve. The line was run down over the years and finally closed after a derailment damaged a stretch of track in 1976, with the double track being lifted from 1979.\nThe preservation group rehabilitated the line, starting steam train operations at Toddington in 1984 over  of re-laid track. In 1987, the line was restored as far as Winchcombe, where the station was reconstructed using the former Monmouth Troy station building. The railway continued to re-lay track west of Winchcombe, through the  long Greet Tunnel, and past the villages of Gretton, Gotherington and Bishops Cleeve. The line to  was re-opened by Princess Anne in 2003. The latest extension of the line, to Broadway, opened in March 2018.\nThe GWSR runs trains from March to the end of December, with the line closing during January and February as well as November for line and locomotive maintenance. The GWSR runs regular train services every weekend, plus most weekdays from Easter to the end of October, and some weekends are used to host special events including steam and diesel galas, Wartime in the Cotswolds, Real Ale Weekends and Santa Specials.\nThe railway operates a wide variety of both steam and heritage diesel locomotives, as well as heritage DMUs, and often hosts visiting locomotives during special events. In 2021, the resident steam locomotives on the line were 7820 \"Dinmore Manor\", 28xx class 2807 (undergoing 10-year overhaul), 42xx class 4270, 7903 \"Foremarke Hall\" and 35006 \"Peninsular & Oriental SN Co\". To complement the running stock, a collection of over 210 carriages and wagons of various origins has been compiled, many of which are still being restored.\nThe GWSR opened its extension to Broadway, Worcestershire to the public on 30 March 2018.\nIn December 2021 the railway returned to running a standard timetable after the removal of Coronavirus restrictions.\nSignalling of the Heritage GWSR\nThe route consists of single line sections with passing places at the major stations.  All stations and loops are signalled using GWR lower quadrant semaphore signals.\nThe signalling on the line is a mixture of Electric Key Token (EKT) and One Train Staff working, depending on operational requirements. Current sections are:\n* Broadway–Toddington (One Train Staff) - will be Track-circuit block (TCB) when Broadway box opens\n* Toddington–Winchcombe (EKT)\n* Winchcombe-Gotherington (EKT)\n* Gotherington-Cheltenham Race Course (EKT)\n* Winchcombe–Cheltenham Race Course (EKT) (With Gotherington switched out)\n* Toddington–Cheltenham Race Course (One Train Staff - with Winchcombe and Gotherington switched out and Cheltenham Race Course behaving as a ground frame)\nThere are four signal boxes along the line, and a new-built platform-mounted one at Broadway, with the frame parts all acquired and assembled:\n* Broadway – currently non-operational\n* Toddington – operational\n* Winchcombe – operational\n* Gotherington – operational\n* Cheltenham Race Course – operational\nStations\n|52.0429|-1.8720| | | |name=Broadway Station}}\n|52.0204|-1.9047| |Closed | |name=Laverton Halt (Closed}}\n|51.9891|-1.9281| | | |name=Toddington Station}}\n|51.9752|-1.9331| | | |name=Hayles Abbey Halt}}\n|51.9664|-1.9634| | | |name=Winchcombe Station}}\n|51.9726|-1.9924| |Closed | |name=Gretton Halt (Closed)}}\n|51.9672|-2.0378| | | |name=Gotherington Station}}\n|51.9474|-2.0504| |Closed | |name=Bishops Cleeve Station (Closed)}}\n|51.9240|-2.0683| | | |name=Cheltenham Race Course Station}}\nFuture development plans\nSouth to Cheltenham\nmap of railways in the vicinity of Gloucester and Cheltenham Spa]]\n, when they constructed a supermarket on the site of the former  station]]\nEncouraged by support from Cheltenham Borough Council, which has both given the railway direct funds and placed protected status on the former line's trackbed south from Cheltenham Race Course to Cheltenham Spa, the railway could at some point connect to Network Rail in the south.\nThe Council has backed the long-term scheme, as this would allow the railway to:\n* be reinstated as an access point for race-goers from all over the UK to reach meetings at Cheltenham Racecourse, thus reduce current traffic congestion\n* build a new halt in the Wyman's Brook area of Cheltenham itself, to serve an adjacent Prince of Wales sports stadium\n* run tourist and excursion trains to access the railway and the town.\nAlthough the GWSR has extended track to (and through) Hunting Butts tunnel, a few hundred yards beyond Cheltenham Race Course station, it owns the trackbed as far as the Prince of Wales stadium at Wyman's Brook. It is likely that after completion of its extension to Broadway, laying track further into Cheltenham will happen to this point; a distance of about 1 mile. However, beyond here major and costly engineering works would be required to extend the trackbed further south.\nThe primary impediments are firstly a bowstring bridge over Honeybourne Way (at ), built in 2002 to allow continued access by bicycle along the old trackbed alignment to Cheltenham Leisure Centre when planning permission was given for the redevelopment of the former  station site as a Waitrose supermarket; the bridge spans a gap in the former railway embankment which was created to provide road access to the supermarket. Secondly, a reduced-height pedestrian specification bridge carrying the footpath/railbed beneath the busy St Georges Road, which would have to be replaced to allow trains to pass beneath the road. There is space alongside the bowstring bridge for the railway, but there is no way to avoid the work necessary to get railway vehicles beneath St Georges Road.\nAn alternative connection to Network Rail close to Swindon Village was also discussed in 2018 in conjunction with developing Cheltenham Race Course station into a National Rail parkway railway station, although the proposal was not acknowledged in the subsequent Gloucestershire Local Transport Plan covering 2020–2041. The 2020 Gloucestershire Rail Strategy does advocate further assessment is made of a new Gloucestershire Parkway station but suggests a site on the existing Birmingham and Gloucester Railway close to M5 junction 11 would have the greatest benefit.\nBetween Broadway and Honeybourne\nGWSR (Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway) could buy the trackbed between Broadway and Honeybourne to protect it from future non-GWSR developments. The trackbed is 4.5 miles long, the bridges have not been removed or filled, and there are no plans to fill or remove them. However, they are in a very poor state and would cost a significant amount to restore; additionally, the DfT has indicated that it would not grant permission for the GWSR to purchase the trackbed and to take on liability for the bridges.\nNorth from Honeybourne\nWhen the GWSR was first formed, it intended to purchase the entire line from Cheltenham Racecourse to Stratford Racecourse. However, when applying for the required Light Railway Order, the group were informed that they were unlikely to be granted the order for 25 miles when they had no experience of running a railway. A reduced application for the 15 miles from Cheltenham Race Course to Broadway was successful and track has since been laid and operations begun. Since this time, the section between Stratford and Stratford Racecourse has been utilised to improve road access around the town, especially the A4390, making reinstatement of rail to the main station at Stratford extremely difficult.\nLandslips\nIn the early 2010s the GWSR was affected by two major landslips in embankments on the line, which severed the preserved line into separate sections; however, both slips have now been repaired, and the whole line has been fully reopened. A further landslip occurred in November 2019 just south of Gotherington station, and again was repaired.\n2010 (Gotherington)\nIn April 2010 the GWSR suffered a landslip of an embankment near Gotherington. Train services continued despite the Gotherington landslip, but over a reduced route.  The landslip forced the closure of the line south of Gotherington, including Cheltenham Race Course Station, which was effectively cut off. The railway continued to operate services from Toddington to Gotherington, with a locomotive at both ends of the train (\"top and tailed\"), as it was not possible to run the locomotive around the train at Gotherington at the time (there is now a run round loop just south of Gotherington). The railway launched a £1m appeal, both to fund the rebuilding of the embankment, and also to undertake preventative maintenance to ensure that similar problems do not happen at other points along the line. It was deemed unlikely that the line south of Gotherington would reopen before July 2011, but donations ensured that the work could be carried out promptly, and it was reopened on 22 April 2011.\n2011 (Chicken Curve)\nIn January 2011 the railway was damaged by another landslip just east of Winchcombe station at Chicken Curve. The landslip severed the railway in two; it was very similar to the one at Gotherington, but closer to the middle of the route. It was estimated that the cost of the repair work would be £850,000; funds for the repair were successfully raised.  During the repair period a DMU service was run from Toddington up to the extension at Laverton; since the earlier Gotherington slip had been repaired, steam trains ran from Winchcombe to Cheltenham Race Course, the steam locomotive maintenance facilities temporarily being transferred to Winchcombe. The Chicken Curve landslip was repaired over the summer of 2012, and the GWSR was once again operational as a single unified line from Cheltenham Race Course to the site of Laverton Halt, a total of 12 route miles in length at that time.\n2019 (Gotherington)\nFollowing extended heavy rain, one side of the embankment south of Gotherington station slipped. This was first discovered in November 2019, and worsened to the extent that no trains could run in January 2020. Following remedial works, the line reopened on 7 March 2020, in time for the regular Cheltenham race trains to run. Work is still ongoing to finish off the site. The total cost of repairs is expected to be £500,000; an emergency appeal has been issued to raise £250,000 towards this cost due to the closure of the line following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSteam locomotives\nOperational\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
