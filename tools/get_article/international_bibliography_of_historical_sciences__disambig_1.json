Volumes 47-48 (1978/1979) were edited by Michel François and Michael Keul; starting from vol. 49 (1980) and up to vol. 62 (1992) the editors were Jean Glénisson and Michael Keul. From volume 62 (1993) the bibliography is edited by the Italian historian Massimo Mastrogregori, with Carlo Colella as assistant editor, and published by the German publishing house De Gruyter.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Julia Brauch, [http://www.histbib.eu/Conferences/4th_Conf_Brauch_Keller.pdf \"International bibliography of historical sciences, 4th Conference on European historical bibliographies, 17-18th March 2011, Munich, Bavarian State Library\"], histbib.eu\n*John L.
