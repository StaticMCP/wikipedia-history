As the grandson and nephew of Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, King had a strong desire to join the US Army. He entered the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, graduating in 1902.\nEarly military career\nInitially, King's family wanted him to be a lawyer, but he desired a more adventurous career. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry in the Georgia National Guard in February 1905. King applied for and received a commission as a second lieutenant of field artillery in the Army in 1908. He served with distinction during World War I, earning the Army Distinguished Service Medal. On 9 July 1918, President Wilson authorized the awarding of the Army's Distinguished Service Medal to Major King, with the citation for the medal reading as follows:\n}}\nAfter the war, King was an honor graduate of the Command and General Staff School in 1923 and then graduated from the Army War College in 1930 and the Navy War College in 1937. Between World War I and World War II, he held several important assignments, including that of instructor in both the Army and Navy War Colleges. In 1940, King was sent to the Philippines, where he was promptly promoted to brigadier general; he served as General Douglas MacArthur's second highest-ranking ground officer, after General Jonathan Wainwright.\nWorld War II\nOn 21 March 1942, after MacArthur was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Australia, Wainwright was given command of  United States Forces in the Philippines, and King became the commanding general of the Luzon Force located on the Bataan Peninsula.  King, an artilleryman, had served in the Philippines with the 2nd Field Artillery in 1915–1917.\nAfter months of fighting the invading Japanese Army and with food and medicine exhausted, King himself, accepting sole responsibility to disobey MacArthur's and Wainwright's orders, chose to surrender his troops on 9 April 1942 (this day is commemorated in the Philippines as the Araw ng Kagitingan, or \"Day of Valor\"). A combined American and Filipino force of over 75,000 surrendered; this was the largest surrender of a military force in American history.  Thousands of these soldiers would die under Japanese captivity during the ensuing Bataan Death March and imprisonment.\nWainwright and his men, numbering 10,000, held on to Corregidor until they too were forced to surrender on 6 May 1942.\nKing spent three and half years as a captive of the Japanese, who often mistreated him due to his rank. Both Wainwright and King expected to be court-martialled for disobeying orders that they should not surrender. However, they were treated as heroes when they were finally freed, with King being awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Army DSM:\nDecorations\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n|colspan=\"3\"|Army Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster\n|colspan=\"3\"|World War I Victory Medal\n|colspan=\"3\"|American Defense Service Medal with \"Foreign Service\" clasp\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|colspan=\"3\"|Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with campaign star\n|colspan=\"3\"|World War II Victory Medal\n|colspan=\"3\"|Philippine Defense Medal with service star\n|-\n|}\nPostwar\nAfter the war, King returned to the United States where he retired to a home in Georgia, devoting himself to many volunteer causes, such as the Red Cross. He died in 1958, and is buried at the Cemetery of St. John in the Wilderness Episcopal Church, Flat Rock, North Carolina.\nIn literature\nWriter John Grisham utilizes King as a character in his fictional novel The Reckoning. Part of the story takes place at Camp O'Donnell during World War II.\nSee also\n*Arnold J.
