Schwartz is an American psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and researcher in the field of neuroplasticity and its application to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). He is a proponent of mind–body dualism and intelligent design.\nWork with OCD\nBrain lock\nBrain lock is a term coined by Schwartz to describe obsessive-compulsive behavior. His 1997 book Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior outlines the disorder and its treatment. In the book Schwartz claims that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a result of a bio-chemical imbalance that \"locks\" brain functions into an obsessive-compulsive pattern and that OCD can be self-treated by following four steps:\n:#Relabel the obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as obsessions and compulsions, not as real thoughts.\n:#Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD.\n:#Refocus on a wholesome, productive activity for at least fifteen minutes.\n:#Revalue the entire obsession and compulsion group as having no useful meaning in your life\nAs consultant\nSchwartz served as consultant for the 2004 biographical film The Aviator, which depicts engineer and philanthropist Howard Hughes' struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Schwartz advised actor Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese on their portrayal of OCD.\nViews\nSchwartz is a proponent of intelligent design, stating, \"You can't get the intelligence out of nature. Intelligence is an intrinsic part of nature.\" In 2001, he signed the statement \"A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism\", which expressed skepticism about the ability of random mutations and natural selection to account for the complexity of life, and encourages careful examination of the evidence for \"Darwinism\", a term intelligent design proponents use to refer to evolution. He appeared in the controversial 2008 film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.\nSchwartz is an advocate for mind-body dualism, arguing that consciousness exists entirely separately from the brain. He provided neuroplasticity from therapy as evidence that \"the mind can exert control over the brain, which [he believes] challenges the material concept of the mind\". He also theorized that in sports, when an athlete focuses, they are \"making a connection with something deep within nature itself, which lends itself to deepening our intelligence.\"\nOther scientists have been critical of Schwartz's ideas. The Templeton Foundation rejected a grant proposed by him; the foundation's senior vice president, Charles L. Harper Jr., stated that the proposal \"had to do with a lot of hocus-pocus on quantum mechanics\".\nSelected publications\nBooks\n*Jeffrey Schwartz and Beverly Beyette, Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior, New York: Regan Books, 1997. .\n*Jeffrey Schwartz and Sharon Begley, The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the power of mental force, New York: Regan Books, 2002. .\n*Jeffrey Schwartz, You Are Not Your Brain: The 4-Step Solution for Changing Bad Habits, Ending Unhealthy Thinking, and Taking Control of Your Life, New York: Avery, 2011. .\nArticles\n*Schwartz, J.
