It was part of the 20th Army Corps. Sometimes the division was nicknamed as the river division, because all of its regiments were named after rivers. Those rivers were the Volga, Kama, Don, and the Ural.\nMany Lithuanians served in this division, with the 109th and 111th Infantry Regiments having particularly many Lithuanians in them. Regardless, the division was assigned to the 1st Army's 20th Army Corps. In the latter half of 1914, this infantry division endured harsh battles in East Prussia, although it met its end with the rest of the 20th Army Corps in the Augustavas Forest.\nDivision's dislocation\nThe division's headquarters were located entirely in Kaunas from 1903 to 1913. The 28th Infantry Division was located in the Kaunas Fortress and was trained for its defence, so it was not prepared for field battles.\nOrder of Battle\n*1st Brigade\n**\n**\n*2nd Brigade\n**\n**\n*28th Artillery Brigade\nReferences"
