At 10:00 am, less than five hours after Hamas attacked, fighting was reported outside of the Re'im Army Base, which is headquarters for the Gaza Division. The base was reportedly the location of IDF drone and surveillance operations. Hamas reportedly posted a video of dead Israeli soldiers it had killed at the base. Later in the day, Israeli Defense Forces regained control of the military base.\nSee also\n*Roi Levy, one of the deaths during the battle\n*Re'im music festival massacre, a massacre that took place nearby\n*Outline of the Gaza war\nReferences"
