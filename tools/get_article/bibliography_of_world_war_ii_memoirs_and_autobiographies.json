This list aims to include memoirs written by participants of World War II about their wartime experience, as well as larger autobiographies of participants of World War II that are at least partially concerned with the author's wartime experience. Works on this list should be all those primary accounts of World War II wartime experience intended for publication. The list does not aim to include diaries, private letter collections or transcripts of private conversations. It also should not include any prewar writings, setting the earliest dates of publication available for this list at 1937 (Second Sino-Japanese War), 1939 (European theater of World War II) and 1941 (Pacific War), depending on geographic context.\nThis article is part of the larger effort to document the Bibliography of World War II.\nIndividual memoirs of World War II that are notable enough to merit their own article are additionally collected in the World War II memoirs category and in the Holocaust personal accounts category.\nEntries are listed primarily by the professional background, then secondarily by national background. The professional background is shown in the context of World War II and does not pay attention to prior or later assignment; for instance, Dwight D. Eisenhower is listed as a general, not as a political leader.\nBibliography\nCivilians, victims of genocide and persecution\nFrance\n*\nHungary\n*\n*\nItaly\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPoland\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nUnited Kingdom\n*\nUnited States\n*  — Victim of the Internment of Japanese Americans\n*  — Victim of the Internment of Japanese Americans\nCivilians, other\nAustralia\n*  — Australian woman's recollection about the presence of U.S. troops in Australia during the war\nFrance\n*\nGermany\n*\nJapan\n*\nSingapore\n*\nJournalists; war correspondents\nAustralia\n*\n*\nUnited Kingdom\n*\n*\nUnited States\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nMilitary, generals & admirals\nAlbania\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nChina\n*\n*\nCzechoslovakia\n*\n*\nFinland\n*\nFrance\n*\nGermany\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nItaly\n*\nKorea\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPoland\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nRomania\n*\nSoviet Union\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nUnited Kingdom\n*\n*  ()\n*\n*  ()\n*  ()\nUnited States\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nVietnam\n*\nYugoslavia\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nMilitary, other\nAustralia\n*\n*  — Australian prisoner-of-war in German camps.\n*  — Australian prisoner-of-war in Japanese camps.\n*  — 9th Australian Division soldier in North Africa.\n*  — Australian anti-aircraft battery commander during the 1942 Battle of Rabaul of the 2/22nd Battalion.\nCanada\n*\n*  — first-hand account by a Canadian veteran of the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment\nFrance\n*  — French airman who later served in the Royal Air Force.\nGermany\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPoland\n*\n*\nSoviet Union\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nUnited Kingdom\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nUnited States\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nYugoslavia\n*\nPolitical leaders; politicians; heads of state; diplomats\nAlbania\n*\nFrance\n*\n*\nGermany\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nHungary\n*\nItaly\n*\nSoviet Union\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nUnited Kingdom\n*\n*\nUnited States\n*\n*\nVietnam\n*\nSecret agents; spies\n*\nSee also\n* Bibliography of the Holocaust\n* Bibliography of the Holocaust in Greece\n* Bibliography of World War II\n* Bibliography of World War II battles and campaigns in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East\n* Bibliography of World War II battles and campaigns in East Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific\n* Bibliography of World War II military units and formations\n* Bibliography of World War II warships"
