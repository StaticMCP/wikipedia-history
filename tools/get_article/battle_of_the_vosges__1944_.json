The engagements involved Free French and American forces advancing against German defenses established in the mountainous region.\nBackground\nThe battle followed the successful Normandy and Provence landings. The American 3rd Army under General George S. Patton advanced from the north, while French forces led by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny pushed from the south. Their junction occurred on September 12, 1944, at Montbard, under the command of SHAEF and General Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nCombat Operations\nGerman forces, including the 19th Army under General Friedrich Wiese, regrouped in the Vosges Mountains, using the Route des Crêtes and other natural defenses to slow the Allied advance.\nFrench and American units faced fierce resistance, harsh terrain, and coordination difficulties. Notable units included the French 3rd Algerian Infantry Division (3e DIA), the 2nd Armored Division (2e DB), and the U.S. 442nd Regimental Combat Team, made up largely of Japanese-American soldiers (nisei).\nNotable Engagements\n*  (October 1944), where the 442nd RCT rescued the Lost Battalion (World War II).\n* Assault on the Haut du Faing with mule trains transporting wounded and ammunition across snow-covered slopes.\nDifficulties\nThe campaign was marked by:\n* Harsh winter weather\n* Difficult terrain and dense forests\n* Logistical problems (equipment, clothing, and food)\n* Political and structural reorganization of French forces, including unit \"whitening\" (replacement of colonial troops with metropolitan ones)\nAftermath\nThe German defensive line was eventually broken, allowing the Allies to push toward Strasbourg, which was liberated on November 23, 1944. The battle demonstrated the critical role of both colonial troops and Japanese-American soldiers in the liberation of France.\nSee also\n* Battle of Dompaire\n*\n* Lost Battalion (World War II)\n* Operation Loyton\n* Operation Waldfest\n* Battle of Alsace\n* Haut du Faing\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/rha/rha97 Revue historique des Armées – SHD]\n* [https://forest.frenchboard.com/t1632-cornimont-bataille-du-haut-du-faing Cornimont: Haut du Faing]\nfr:Bataille des Vosges (Seconde Guerre mondiale)"
