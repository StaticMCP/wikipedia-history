It discusses the inter-ethnic and inter-racial relations between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic white Americans in Texas.\nThere is a version in Spanish, titled Anglos y mexicanos en la formación de Texas: 1836–1986, published in 1991 by Alianza Editorial in Spain.\nContents\nThe book is divided into four parts by year span. The parts cover, respectively, 1836–1900, 1900–1920, 1920–1940, and 1940–1986. The sections are titled Incorporation, Reconstruction, Segregation, and Integration, respectively.\nThe first discusses how after the Texas Revolution and later the Texas annexation, the non-Hispanic whites took financial and political supremacy over Mexican-descended Texans. The second part shows the reorientation of the Texas economy towards settled agriculture, when previously ranching was the primary economic engine, and how this resulted in repression against Texans of Mexican origin. The third section describes how Anglo-dominated Texas enacted racially discriminatory laws against Texans of Mexican origins. The final section shows how, in a more urban-oriented Texas, segregation declined and the order is more favorable to Texans of Mexican origins.\nReception\nThe book won the 1988 Frederick Jackson Turner Award.\nRodolfo O. de la Garza of the University of Texas at Austin stated that the work \"is the most comprehensive and insightful history of Anglo-Mexican relations in Texas yet written.\" de la Garza did argue that the book did not prove the theory the author intended.\nDavid R. Maciel of the University of New Mexico described the book as \"an outstanding contribution\".\nAvelardo Valdez of the University of Texas at San Antonio described the book as \"a benchmark publication\" that is \"a significant addition\" in its field and that it is \"meticulously documented\". He had some criticisms he characterized as minor.\nSee also\n* History of Mexican Americans in Texas\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;view=toc;idno=heb00601.0001.001 Book copy] at the University of Michigan\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7560/775664/html?lang=en Book copy] at DeGruyter"
