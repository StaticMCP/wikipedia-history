It is to manage the audiovisual content of ETH Zurich from production to distribution in an automated manner.\nApplication area\nThe main focus of REPLAY is the quasi-automated handling of large number of lecture recordings (>150 per week) and to provide an integrated management solution for other video objects (films, digitization results etc.). Thus, it covers all the audiovisual material usually to be found in academic and other institutions (museums, companies etc.).\nWorkflow\nREPLAY covers the complete lifecycle of the audiovisual objects: In the classroom / lecture hall, the Linux-based Playmobil as an additional hardware component automatically captures audio, video, and VGA (for slides/presentations/computer display/other devices). After the lecture, these sources are bundled with metadata and proceeded into the REPLAY backend. Other video material can be ingested through an inbox.\nAll bundles are then:\n* archived,\n* indexed (based on slide content, using Optical Character Recognition),\n* encoded according to settings and\n* distributed in various channels (RSS, streaming, download etc.)\nOne of the distribution channels is Interplay, a user interface designed for interactive consumption of video.\nQualities\nREPLAY is written in Java, open source and oriented towards standards wherever possible. It is modular in design and envisaged to run on a singular machine as well as in a distributed environment.\nLicense\nREPLAY is open source under GNU LGPL license version 2.\nDevelopment\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403002529/http://replay.origo.ethz.ch/ Development website]. Replay has been developed towards release 0.7 (March 2009); as of June 2009 the project has ended and support was suspended by the end of 2009. Efforts around REPLAY and its technology are being transferred to the Opencast Matterhorn project.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.replay.ethz.ch/ Official website]\n* [http://www.project-replay.ethz.ch/ Project website]\n* [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1449956.1450016 Article from the proceedings of the 36th annual ACM SIGUCCS conference]\n*[http://wsuelearner.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/educause-2008-replay-for-audiovisual-lecture-recordings/ The WSU eLearner blog on REPLAY]\n*[http://www.gorissen.info/Pierre/item/2008/10/31/replay-opern-source-lecture-capturing The ICT en Onderwijs blog on REPLAY (Dutch)]\n* [http://www.replay.ethz.ch/docs/educause Presentation of REPLAY at EDUCAUSE 2008]\n* [http://www.workshop.ch/openmind/2008/12/20/replay-gesamtloesung-zur-aufzeichnung-und-verbreitung-von-vorlesungen-der-eth-zuerich/ Article on REPLAY (German)]\n* [http://www.tele-task.de/lectures/view/3910/real/ Presentation of REPLAY (German, video)]"
