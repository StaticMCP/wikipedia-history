It was established in 1957 by the Society for Medieval Archaeology and is published on their behalf by Taylor & Francis. The editor-in-chief is Duncan Wright (Newcastle University).\nHistory\nIn the mid-20th century, archaeology in Britain was dominated by interests in prehistory and the classical period. The Society for Medieval Archaeology was founded in the 1950s to share information about medieval archaeology, and to publish a journal similar to the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society. The cost of producing the journal meant that external grants were needed early on, supplementing the society's membership fees. As a result, excavation reports were common especially in early volumes of the journal. Medieval Archaeology inspired the creation of other similarly themed academic journals, Archéologie mediévale (French), Zeitschrift für Archäologie des Mittelalters (German), and Archeologia Medievale (Italian).\nTo mark the Society for Medieval Archaeology's 50th anniversary in 2006, the first 50 volumes of Medieval Archaeology were made available online via the Archaeology Data Service and are free to access. In 2007, Medieval Archaeology began including abstracts translated into French, German, and Italian.\nEditor's Award\nSince 2007, the Society has given the Editor's Award (formerly the Martyn Jope Award) to \"the best novel interpretation, application of analytical method or presentation of new findings published in its journal\".\n*2007: Stuart Brookes, \"Boat-rivets in Graves in pre-Viking Kent: Reassessing Anglo-Saxon Boat-burial Traditions\"\n*2008: Roberta Gilchrist, \"Magic for the Dead?
