Bestowed by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS), the News & Documentary Emmys are presented in recognition of excellence in American news and documentary programming.\nCeremonies generally are held in the fall, with the Emmys handed out in about 40 awards categories. Only two of these award categories honor local news programming, while the rest are for national programming. Most Emmys for local news and documentary programming are instead awarded during the Regional Emmys.\nBefore the News & Documentary Emmy Awards, news and documentary were the focus of various short-lived categories at the Primetime Emmy Awards, including \"Best News Program\" (1951), \"Best Program Of News Or Sports\" (1954), \"Best Special Event Or News Program\" (1956), \"Best Coverage Of A Newsworthy Event\" (1957), \"Best Coverage Of An Unscheduled Newsworthy Event\" (1958), \"Best News Reporting Series\" (1959), \"Best News Commentator Or Analyst\" (1955-1959), \"Outstanding Program Achievement In The Field Of News\" (1961-1963), \"Outstanding Program Achievement In The Field Of News Commentary Or Public Affairs\" (1963-1964), \"Outstanding Program Achievement In The Field Of News Reports\" (1964), \"Outstanding Achievement In Cinematography For News And Documentary Programming, Documentary\" (1970-1972), \"Outstanding Achievement In Film Editing For News And Documentary Programming, Documentary\" (1971-1972), \"Outstanding Achievement In Film Editing For News And Documentary Programming, Regularly Scheduled News Programs And Coverage Of Special Events\" (1970-1972), and \"Outstanding Achievement In Cinematography For News And Documentary Programming, Regularly Scheduled News Programs And Coverage Of Special Events\" (1970-1972).\nRules\nAccording to the News & Documentary Emmy rules, a show, documentary or news report must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between January 1 and December 31, and to at least 50 percent of the country. A foreign-produced show is usually ineligible unless it was a co-production with an American partner, and was originally committed to be aired on American television right from the start.\nFor the two award categories that honor local news programming, Outstanding Regional Story: Spot News and Outstanding Regional Story: Investigative Reporting, only news reports that have already won a Regional Emmy are eligible.\nEntries must be submitted by March. Most award categories also require entries to include DVDs or tape masters of the show, documentary or news report. For the New Approaches categories, the video or multimedia is submitted online. In addition, a one-page essay describing why an entry is \"Emmy-worthy\" is also required.\nVoting is done by peer judging panels between May and June. The Academy solicits anybody with significant experience in national news or documentary reporting or production to serve as judges. Most categories have two voting rounds, with separate judging panels in each round. The top entries in each category are announced as the \"nominations\", and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.\nAward categories\nNational\n* Regularly Scheduled Newscast\n** Outstanding Coverage of a Breaking News Story\n** Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story\n** Outstanding Feature Story\n** Outstanding Investigative Journalism\n** Outstanding Business and Economic Reporting\n* News Magazine\n** Outstanding Coverage of a Breaking News Story\n** Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story\n** Outstanding Feature Story\n** Outstanding Investigative Journalism\n** Outstanding Business and Economic Reporting\n* Long Form\n** Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story\n** Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story\n** Outstanding Investigative Journalism\n** Outstanding Informational Programming\n** Outstanding Historical Programming\n** Outstanding Business and Economic Reporting\n* Outstanding Programming\n** Arts and Culture\n** Science and Technology\n** Nature\n** Outstanding Interview\n** Best Story in a Regularly Scheduled Newscast\n** Best Report in a News Magazine\n** Best Documentary\n* New Approaches To News & Documentary Programming:\n** Current News Coverage\n** Documentaries\n** Arts, Lifestyle & Culture\n* Outstanding Individual Achievement in a Craft:\n** Writing\n** Research\n** Cinematography - Nature\n** Cinematography - News Coverage / Documentaries\n** Editing\n** Editing–Quick Turnaround\n** Graphic Design & Art  Direction\n** Music & Sound\n** Lighting Direction & Scenic Design\n* Outstanding Promotional Announcement:\n** Institutional\n** Episodic\nRegional\n* Outstanding Regional News Story:\n** Spot News\n** Investigative Reporting\nSee also\n* List of American television awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170726194547/http://emmyonline.com/newsemmy News & Documentary Emmy Award Nominees and Winners 1979-2015]"
