The site (Kingscote Woods Complex, including Conygre Wood, Sandgrove Wood and Fishponds Wood) is listed in the 'Cotswold District' Local Plan 2001-2011 (on line) as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).\nLocation\nThe woods are in the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and there are two units of assessment. There are four separately named woods in the citation being Kingscote, Horsley, Sandgrove and Fishponds.\nWoodland type\nThe site is an example of ancient Beech woodland, which is typical of the Jurassic limestone of the west Cotswolds.  Kingscote, Horsley and Sandgrove woods are similar and includes some Ash and Oak.  The woodland understorey is Hazel and Hawthorn.  These are Bluebell woods with Wood Garlic, Wood Anemone and Dog's Mercury.\nFishponds Wood, as its names implies, includes a pond area, and is a regenerated woodland, having been previously felled. Ground flora includes Small Teasel.\nReferences\nSSSI Source\n* [http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1001720 Natural England SSSI information on the citation]\n* [http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/unitlist.cfm?sssi_id=1001720 Natural England SSSI information on the Kingscote and Horsley Wood units]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.naturalengland.org.uk Natural England] (SSSI information)\nImage:Kingscote Wood from Binley Farm - geograph.org.uk - 361548.jpg|Kingscote Wood"
