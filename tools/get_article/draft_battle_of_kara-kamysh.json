At the same time, Ishim and Bahadur, who had marched from Ala-Tagh with their army against the False Abd al-Ghaffar, approached the outskirts of Tashkent. Capturing a prisoner, they learned crucial information about the position of the False Abd al-Ghaffar Sultan. At dawn, Ishim and Bahadur launched a sudden attack on the camp in Kara-Kamysh. The False Abd al-Ghaffar Sultan was still asleep. Awakened by the sound of horses' hooves, he ran out of his tent in fear, but at that moment, Ishim Khan caught up with him and delivered a fatal blow with his massive saber.\n}}\nReference\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
