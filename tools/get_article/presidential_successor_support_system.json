Considered one of many \"black programs,\" (i.e. Special Access Programs), very few details have come to light about it. PSSS was run by the National Program Office.\nThe National Program Office was established in 1982, by National Security Decision Directive 55, Enduring National Leadership.\nPrior presidential administrations had different ways of dealing with the problem of leadership decapitation. President Eisenhower designated ten captains of industry to take control of war-time organizations to help the country reconstitute itself. The existence of the Eisenhower Ten was accidentally found by the incoming John F. Kennedy administration in 1961.\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcIyJFuEG0w Youtube.com: \"CNN Special Assignment: The Doomsday Plan,\" Part 2]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qid_fpUMoc Youtube.com: \"CNN Special Assignment: The Doomsday Plan,\" Part 3]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hWb_JATpR0 Youtube.com: \"CNN Special Assignment: The Doomsday Plan,\" Part 4]\nReferences"
