Tested in the US National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University,  averaged a survival rate of 85% after 10 years.\nDescription\nThe branches are upright, but the form of the tree is more oval than vase-shaped; the leaves are relatively large. However, examples grown in the warmer climes of the southern United States have not impressed, and it was dismissed, along with its Morton stablemates  and , as 'ugly' by Michael Dirr, Professor of Horticulture at the University of Georgia [http://www.greenbeam.com/rs/nm_pdfs/16338_013.pdf], on account of its 'wild' growth and splaying branches.\nPests and diseases\nAlthough resistant to Dutch elm disease in the United States, the tree is moderately susceptible to insects, notably elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola, Japanese beetle and Gypsy moth.\nCultivation\nis vigorous and robust, adjudged the third fastest-growing cultivar of 17 assessed by the University of Minnesota and fourth out of 15 in trials at UC Davis. The tree is also extremely tolerant of drought and cold; in artificial freezing tests at the Morton Arboretum the tree was found cold-hardy to −40°C.\nwas introduced by Chicagoland Grows and is currently being evaluated in the National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University. The tree was introduced to the UK in 2014, but is not known (2016) to have been introduced to Australasia.\nFile:190908 179 Chicago Botanic Gdn - Esplanade, North Lake, Ulmus 'Morton Stalwart' Commendation™ Elm (48861571041).jpg|Ulmus 'Morton Stalwart' Commendation™, Esplanade, North Lake, Chicago Botanic Garden (September 2019)\nFile:CBG Esplanade - view of North Lake, Ulmus 'Morton Stalwart' Commendation 150627 (19713630363).jpg|Boles of  'Morton Stalwart' Commendation™\nAccessions\n;North America\n*Arnold Arboretum, US.
