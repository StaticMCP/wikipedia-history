He ruled 18 June 1749 – July 1751, and 31 January 1753 – September 1772.\nHe succeeded on the death of his father, Maharaja Abhai Singh, on 18 June 1749. However, he was defeated in battle by his uncle Maharaja Bakht Singh at Luniawas on 27 November 1750, and was expelled from Jodhpur. He sought refuge in Jaipur in July 1751. In 1753, he reascended the gadi for the second time after deposing Maharaja Vijay Singh, his cousin.\nMaharaja Ram Singh died at Jaipur in September 1772. He was succeeded by Maharaja Vijay Singh, who then became Maharaja for the second time himself.\nSee also\n*Rulers of Marwar\nReferences"
