The group began as Stolt's touring band to support his third solo album The Flower King. They continued performing after the tour and have gone on to become one of the most prolific studio recording units in progressive rock, having released over twenty hours of music spread across sixteen studio albums. Their music is similar to early symphonic progressive rock groups such as Yes, marked by sharp dynamic changes, polyrhythms, heavy bass, vocal harmonies, abstract lyrics, and extended song lengths.\nHistory\nFormation\nIn early 1993, guitarist and singer Roine Stolt had written material for his third solo album The Flower King and sought musicians to perform it. He had wanted to release a progressive rock-style album for a while and felt the time was right to pursue the project. The album features Stolt on vocals, guitar, bass and keyboards; Jaime Salazar on drums; and Hasse Fröberg on vocals. It was recorded in Sweden between May 1993 and January 1994.\nIn preparation for Stolt's concert tour to support the album's release, Stolt, Salazar, and Fröberg were joined by Stolt's brother Michael on bass and Tomas Bodin on keyboards. The five performed their first gig on 20 August 1994 at an outdoor festival in Uppsala, Stolt's hometown and the city where The Flower King was recorded. After they decided to become a full-time band, they officially adopted the name The Flower Kings, named after Stolt's album. Stolt had produced a list of potential titles for the record, one of which was \"The Flower King\", and chose it because of its positive meaning and its reference to the hippie era of the 1960s.\nActivity\nAfter performing a series of concerts through 1994, the band entered the studio in December 1994 to record their debut album, Back in the World of Adventures. The recording process was gradual, finishing in October 1995.\nIn 2000, Michael Stolt was replaced by Jonas Reingold. Two years later, Salazar was replaced by Zoltan Csörsz. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation joined the band the same year as a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist.\nOther contributors have included Hasse Bruniusson (percussion) and Ulf Wallander (saxophone).\nStolt has written the vast majority of the material the band has recorded, with Bodin contributing most of the rest. The music is best described as symphonic progressive rock, bearing a strong resemblance to the music of Yes, King Crimson, Gentle Giant, and early Genesis, with jazz fusion and blues influences. The band's lyrics are almost uniformly positive and uplifting, affirming such values as love, peace, and spirituality, and furthering their association with Yes.\nTheir 1999 album Flower Power contains the eighteen-section, almost 60-minute \"Garden of Dreams\".\nIn June 2007, they released The Road Back Home, a compilation of remixed songs from 1994 to 2006, plus \"Little Deceiver\" (a previously unreleased track) and the full version of their cover of \"The Cinema Show\" by Genesis.\nZoltan Csörsz was replaced by new drummer Marcus Liliequist for one album, but returned for the 2007 album, The Sum of No Evil. He was subsequently replaced by Erik Hammarström in 2008.\nIn 2008, Ola Heden, previously of Reingold's side project Karmakanic, joined on guitar, vocals and keyboards.\nIn November 2008, the band were the opening act at the Ecco Prog Fest in Moscow.\nAfter touring in 2008, The Flower Kings were inactive for four years. Stolt felt the band had varied levels of focus in their direction and had started to feel lost. They reunited in 2011 to work on new material after Stolt felt it was the right time and sensed eagerness from the other members to work together. This marked the arrival of German drummer Felix Lehrmann. Banks of Eden, the group's eleventh album, was released in June 2012 and was recorded with analogue recording techniques and styles reminiscent of the height of vinyl records. This was followed by Desolation Rose in October 2013.\nThe lineup of Stolt, Bodin, Reingold, Fröberg and Lehrmann played together for the last time in 2015. 2016 and 2017 saw the band members busy with other engagements.\nIn December 2017, the first part of a career-spanning box set titled A Kingdom of Colours was released. This first box, with 10 discs, covers the period from 1995 to 2002 and includes the studio albums from Back in the World of Adventures to Unfold the Future. The second box set, titled A Kingdom of Colours 2 and covering the albums Adam and Eve through to Desolation Rose, was released in June 2018.\nIn September 2018, Stolt announced a new album named Manifesto of an Alchemist. The album did not feature long-time keyboardist Tomas Bodin, and as such, it is credited to \"Roine Stolt's The Flower King\" rather than \"The Flower Kings\".\nIn August of the same year, Roine Stolt presented a new band called \"Roine Stolt and friends play The Flower Kings\". The band featured Stolt, Fröberg and Reingold with new keyboard player Zach Kamins and new drummer Mirko DeMaio. Roine Stolt stated that he was done being in a group and wanted to tour as a solo artist like Roger Waters or Steven Wilson. Tomas Bodin was not a part of this group and made his displeasure quite public. The band toured with Spock's Beard in November and December 2018 and continued to do shows in 2019, this time under the name \"The Flower Kings Revisited\".\nIn July 2019, \"Revisited\" was removed from the band name, making it clear that this lineup was now \"The Flower Kings\". The band went on to release the double albums Waiting for Miracles in 2019 and Islands in 2020, the latter having been recorded entirely remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 24 March 2021, Roine Stolt announced two big projects. The Flower Kings are working on a brand new album \"in the same innocence\" of Stardust We Are. By the end of 2021, Stolt explained that Jonas Reingold could no longer participate in the touring line-up due to his commitments with Steve Hackett's band, but Reingold still plays some of the songs in the studio.\nOn January 7, 2022, the band announced their 15th studio album By Royal Decree would be released on 4 March 2022, while also announcing that founding member Michael Stolt returned after more than two decades to contribute bass and vocals, splitting duties with current bassist Jonas Reingold. On 8 April 2022, InsideOut and Roine Stolt announced that Back in the World of Adventures and Retropolis were getting \"remastered and partly remixed\". The release date for both was placed on 27 May 2022. Stardust We Are and Flower Power were also remixed and remastered in June.\nThe 16th studio album, Look at You Now, was announced for an 8 September 2023 release, alongside a European tour about to take place in October 2023. In April 2023, Zach Kamins revealed he left the group due to complicating touring logistics and Daniel Lantz joined for the summer shows. In July, the group mentioned that Lalle Larsson will play for the rest of the upcoming European dates.\nPersonnel\nCurrent members\n* Roine Stolt&nbsp;– vocals, guitar, keyboards, bass guitar (1994–present)\n* Hasse Fröberg&nbsp;– vocals, guitar, acoustic guitar, tambourine (1994–present)\n* Michael Stolt&nbsp;– bass guitar (1994–1999, 2021–present)\n* Mirko DeMaio – drums (2018–present)\n* Lalle Larsson – keyboards (2023–present)\nFormer members\n* Jaime Salazar&nbsp;– drums (1994–2001)\n* Tomas Bodin&nbsp;– keyboards (1994–2015)\n* Jonas Reingold&nbsp;– bass (1999–2021)\n* Felix Lehrmann&nbsp;– drums (2011–2015)\n* Zoltan Csörsz&nbsp;– drums (2002–2004; 2007–2008)\n* Daniel Gildenlöw&nbsp;– vocals, guitars, keyboards (2002–2004)\n* Marcus Liliequist&nbsp;– drums (2005–2006)\n* Zach Kamins – keyboards (2018–2023)\nGuest musicians\n* Hasse Bruniusson&nbsp;– percussion (1995–present)\n* Ulf Wallander&nbsp;– saxophone (1995–present)\n* Håkan Almqvist – sitar (1997)\n* Pat Mastelotto&nbsp;– drums (2007)\n* Erik Hammarström&nbsp;– drums (2008)\n* Ola Heden&nbsp;– vocals, keyboards, guitar (2008)\n* Aliaksandr Yasinski – accordion (2022)\n* Marjana Semkina – vocal (2023)\n* Daniel Lantz – keyboards (2023)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nColors =\nid:Vocals     value:red         legend:Vocals,_guitars\nid:Bass       value:blue        legend:Bass\nid:Drums      value:orange      legend:Drums\nid:Keyboards  value:purple      legend:Keyboards\nid:Lines      value:black       legend:Studio_Album\nid:LiveLines  value:gray(0.45)  legend:Live_Album\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1994\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1994\nLineData =\nlayer:back\nat:10/25/1995 color:black layer:back\nat:05/25/1996 color:black layer:back\nat:04/11/1997 color:black layer:back\nat:11/16/1999 color:black layer:back\nat:02/15/2000 color:LiveLines layer:back\nat:07/04/2000 color:black layer:back\nat:09/18/2001 color:black layer:back\nat:11/05/2002 color:black layer:back\nat:11/04/2003 color:LiveLines layer:back\nat:08/03/2004 color:black layer:back\nat:04/04/2006 color:black layer:back\nat:09/25/2006 color:LiveLines layer:back\nat:09/25/2007 color:black layer:back\nat:11/15/2011 color:LiveLines layer:back\nat:06/18/2012 color:black layer:back\nat:10/29/2013 color:black layer:back\nat:11/08/2019 color:black layer:back\nat:10/30/2020 color:black layer:back\nat:03/04/2022 color:black layer:back\nat:09/08/2023 color:black layer:back\nat:11/15/2024 color:LiveLines layer:back\nat:05/11/2025 color:black layer:back\nBarData =\nbar:Roine     text:\"Roine Stolt\"\nbar:Hasse     text:\"Hasse Fröberg\"\nbar:Daniel    text:\"Daniel Gildenlöw\"\nbar:Michael   text:\"Michael Stolt\"\nbar:Jonas     text:\"Jonas Reingold\"\nbar:Jaime     text:\"Jaime Salazar\"\nbar:Zoltan    text:\"Zoltan Csörsz\"\nbar:Marcus    text:\"Marcus Liliequist\"\nbar:Felix     text:\"Felix Lehrmann\"\nbar:Mirko     text:\"Mirko DeMaio\"\nbar:Tomas     text:\"Tomas Bodin\"\nbar:Zach      text:\"Zach Kamins\"\nbar:Lalle     text:\"Lalle Larsson\"\nPlotData =\nwidth:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\nbar:Roine from:start till:12/01/2008 color:Vocals\nbar:Roine from:start till:12/01/2008 color:Keyboards width:3\nbar:Roine from:05/01/2011 till:05/01/2015 color:Vocals\nbar:Roine from:05/01/2011 till:05/01/2015 color:Keyboards width:3\nbar:Roine from:08/01/2018 till:end color:Vocals\nbar:Roine from:08/01/2018 till:end color:Keyboards width:3\nbar:Hasse from:start till:12/01/2008 color:Vocals\nbar:Hasse from:05/01/2011 till:05/01/2015 color:Vocals\nbar:Hasse from:08/01/2018 till:end color:Vocals\nbar:Daniel from:01/01/2002 till:12/31/2004 color:Vocals\nbar:Daniel from:01/01/2002 till:12/31/2004 color:Keyboards width:3\nbar:Michael from:start till:11/01/1999 color:Bass\nbar:Michael from:08/01/2021 till:end color:Bass\nbar:Jonas from:11/01/1999 till:12/01/2008 color:Bass\nbar:Jonas from:05/01/2011 till:05/01/2015 color:Bass\nbar:Jonas from:08/01/2018 till:08/01/2021 color:Bass\nbar:Zoltan from:01/01/2002 till:12/31/2004 color:Drums\nbar:Jaime from:start till:12/31/2001 color:Drums\nbar:Marcus from:01/01/2005 till:12/31/2006 color:Drums\nbar:Zoltan from:01/01/2007 till:12/01/2008 color:Drums\nbar:Felix from:05/01/2011 till:05/01/2015 color:Drums\nbar:Mirko from:08/01/2018 till:end color:Drums\nbar:Tomas from:start till:12/01/2008 color:Keyboards\nbar:Tomas from:05/01/2011 till:05/01/2015 color:Keyboards\nbar:Zach from:08/01/2018 till:04/01/2023 color:Keyboards\nbar:Lalle from:04/01/2023 till:end color:Keyboards\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and sales figures\n!
