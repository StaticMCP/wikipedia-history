It is important to understand that these philosophers do not cast doubt on scientific predictions related to the past but rather propose a semantic difference which has not been widely adapted by historians or any scientific discipline which studies the past.\n* Various pseudo-scientists have used a hypothetical distinction between experimental science and \"historical science.\" to claim that science can not make predictions about the past. This claim is demonstrably false.\n* History of science"
