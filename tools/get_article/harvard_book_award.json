The award has been in existence since 1910.\nThe award is traditionally handed out at graduation ceremonies. Criteria for selection vary by school, and it is usually associated with unmistakable academic excellence, strength of character and achievements in other fields.\nEach Book awarded comes with an official Harvard bookplate which states the name of the donor and the award recipient and a commemorative bookmark.\nThe Harvard Prize Books are usually presented at the end of the academic year at high school award ceremonies or high school graduations.\nReferences\nHarvard Prize Book is an achievement award from the Harvard Alumni Association awarded to the outstanding high school student in the next-to-graduating class (junior year) who \"displays excellence in scholarship and high character, combined with achievements in other fields.\"\nState level Harvard Clubs provide the awards to approximately 2,000 selected high schools around the world.
