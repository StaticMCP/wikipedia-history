      "text": "# The Wild Colonial Boy\n\n\"The Wild Colonial Boy\" (Roud 677, Laws L20) is a traditional anonymously penned Irish-Australian folk ballad that tells the story of a bushranger in early colonial Australia who dies during a gunfight with local police. Versions of the ballad give different names for the bushranger involved: some based on real individuals and some apparently fictional. A common theme is romanticisation of the bushranger's battle against colonial authority. According to a report in The Argus in November 1880, Ann Jones, the innkeeper of the Glenrowan Hotel, asked her son to sing the ballad when the Kelly Gang were at her hotel in June that year.\nIdentity of the bushranger\nVersions of the ballad depict bushrangers with the first name of \"Jack\" and surnames such as \"Dolan,\" \"Doolan,\" \"Duggan\" and \"Donahue.\" It is unclear if the ballad originally referred to an actual person.\nOne possible origin is Jack Donahue (also spelled Donohoe), an 1820s Irish convict who was sent to Australia, became a bushranger and was killed by police. Another possibility is that the song refers to an 1860s juvenile Australian convict named John Doolan, who was born in Castlemaine, Victoria, and also turned to bushranging. However, the real Doolan was not shot by police, instead being captured and sentenced to an additional convict term. It is also possible that the histories of Donohue and Doolan became blended over time to produce the modern ballad's lyrics. There is also a possibility that the name of the real person was Jack Donahue, whose name was changed over time to mask the song's origins.\nLyrics and melody\n{{image frame|content=\n\\header { tagline = ##f }\n\\layout { indent = 0\\cm \\context { \\Score \\remove \"Bar_number_engraver\" } }\nglobal = {\n\\key d \\major\n\\time 3/4\n\\partial 4\n}\nchordNames = \\chordmode {\n\\global\ns4 | d,2. | d,2. | g,2. | e,2.:m | a,2.:7 | a,2.:7 | d,2. | s2\ns4 | d,2. | d,2. | a,2. | a,2. | g,2. | g,2. | a,2.~ | a,4 s4\ns4 | d,2. | d,2. | a,2. | a,2. | g,2. | g,2. | a,2. | a,4:7 s4\ns4 | d,2. | d,2. | g,2. | e,2.:m | a,2.:7 | a,2.:7 | d,2.~ | d,4 s4 \\bar \"|.\"\n}\ntenorVoice = \\relative c'' {\n\\global\na4 | d,2 fis4 | a2 a4 | b2 g4 | e2 d4 | cis2 a4 | fis'2 e4 | d2. | r2\nfis4 | a2 d4 | d2 a4 | cis2 b4 | e,2 fis4 | g2 a4 | cis2 b4 | a2.~ | a4 r4\nfis | a2 d4 | d2 a4 | cis2 b4 | e,2 fis4 | g2 a4 | cis2 b4 | a2.~ | a4 r4\nfis d2 fis4 | a2 a4 | b2 g4 | e2 d4 | cis2 a4 | fis'2 e4 | d2.~ | d4 r4 \\bar \"|.\"\n}\nverse = \\lyricmode {\n'Tis of a wild Co -- lon -- ial Boy, Jack Doo -- lan was his name,\nOf poor but hon -- est pa -- rents he was born in Cas -- tle -- maine.\nHe was his fa -- ther's on -- ly hope, his mo -- ther's pride and joy,\nAnd dear -- ly did his pa -- rents love the wild Co -- lon -- ial Boy.\n}\nchordsPart = \\new ChordNames { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"acoustic guitar (steel)\" \\set chordChanges = ##t \\chordNames }\ntenorVoicePart = \\new Staff \\with {\nmidiInstrument = \"accordion\"\n} { \\tenorVoice }\n\\addlyrics { \\verse }\n\\score {\n>\n\\layout { }\n\\midi {\n\\tempo 2.=90\n\\context { \\ChordNames midiMinimumVolume = #0.3 midiMaximumVolume = #0.3 }\n}\n}\n}}\n'Tis of a wild Colonial Boy, Jack Doolan was his name,\nOf poor but honest parents he was born in Castlemaine.\nHe was his father's only hope, his mother's pride and joy,\nAnd dearly did his parents love the wild Colonial Boy.\nChorus\nCome, all my hearties, we'll roam the mountains high,\nTogether we will plunder, together we will die.\nWe'll wander over valleys, and gallop over plains,\nAnd we'll scorn to live in slavery, bound down with iron chains.\nHe was scarcely sixteen years of age when he left his father's home,\nAnd through Australia's sunny clime a bushranger did roam.\nHe robbed those wealthy squatters, their stock he did destroy,\nAnd a terror to Australia was the wild Colonial Boy.\nIn sixty-one this daring youth commenced his wild career,\nWith a heart that knew no danger, no foeman did he fear.\nHe stuck up the Beechworth mail-coach, and robbed Judge MacEvoy,\nWho trembled, and gave up his gold to the wild Colonial Boy.\nHe bade the judge \"Good morning\", and told him to beware,\nThat he'd never rob a hearty chap that acted on the square,\nAnd never to rob a mother of her son and only joy,\nOr else you might turn outlaw, like the wild Colonial Boy.\nOne day as he was riding the mountain-side along,\nA-listening to the little birds, their pleasant laughing song,\nThree mounted troopers rode along – Kelly, Davis and FitzRoy –\nThey thought that they would capture him, the wild Colonial Boy.\n\"Surrender now, Jack Doolan, you see there's three to one.\nSurrender now, Jack Doolan, you're a daring highwayman.\"\nHe drew a pistol from his belt, and shook the little toy,\n\"I'll fight, but not surrender,\" said the wild Colonial Boy.\nHe fired at Trooper Kelly and brought him to the ground,\nAnd in return from Davis received a mortal wound.\nAll shattered through the jaws he lay still firing at FitzRoy,\nAnd that's the way they captured him – the wild Colonial Boy.\nIn popular culture\n* The Pogues and The Dubliners released \"Jack's Heroes\", a 1990 single celebrating the Republic of Ireland national football team, which uses the tune of \"The Wild Colonial Boy\".\n* \"The Wild Colonial Boy\" is sung in The Quiet Man (1952 film directed by John Ford), in the scene in which American Sean Thornton (played by John Wayne) first appears in the bar in the Irish village of Innisfree.\n* \"The Wild Colonial Boy\" is quoted by the character Blair Maine in the BBC TV series SAS: Rogue Heroes.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [http://www.planetslade.com/bushranger-ballads-wild-colonial-boy.html \"The Wild Colonial Boy\"], Paul Slade, May 2019\nExternal links\n*"
