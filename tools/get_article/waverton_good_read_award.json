      "text": "# Waverton Good Read Award\n\nThe Waverton Good Read Award was founded in 2003 by villagers in Waverton, Chester, England, and is based on ''Le Prix de la Cadière d'Azur, a literary prize awarded by a Provençal village.  Adult debut novels written by UK residents and published in the previous twelve months are eligible for consideration and are read by villagers. \"The aim was not only to stimulate reading in the village but to provide encouragement to British writers\". Two of the main founders were Gwen Goodhew (born 21 October 1942) an educational specialist who established Wirral Able Child Centre and has written and edited books on teaching the gifted child, and Wendy Smedley. It is the first British award to be judged by normal readers rather than literary figures.\n'Waverton Good Read Children's Award''' was first presented in 2011, for children's literature.\nDue to the COVID pandemic, the 2019/20 shortlist and winner were announced on the same day, and there was no Children's award.\nWinners and shortlists\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Shortlisted\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n! |2003/4\n| The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Mark Haddon\n|\n*Astonishing Splashes of Colour, by Clare Morrall\n*Brick Lane, by Monica Ali\n*Dissolution, by C.
