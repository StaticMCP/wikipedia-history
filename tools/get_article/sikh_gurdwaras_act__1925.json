The Udasi differed from their mainline Sikh congregants, and due to differences in theology (such as syncretic Hindu practices) as well as some instances of malfeasance were seen as allowing or committing behaviours unsuitable for a gurdwara. By the 1920s, resentment of this perceived corruption led to the foundation of the Akali Movement which negotiated or forced Udasi mahants (religious heads) out of control of key gurdwaras.\nLegislation\nAmong the issues addressed by the legislation:\n* Identification as a Sikh was defined by the attestation: One who professes the Sikh religion - I solemnly affirm that I am a Sikh, that I believe in the Guru Granth Sahib, that I believe in the Ten Gurus, and that I have no other religion. This definition was to stand until 1945.\n* Custody of historic Sikh shrines would pass to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, a Sikh-led committee.\n* The SGPC, formed in 1920, was defined as consisting of 120 practicing Sikhs, the heads of the Panj Takht (five primary Sikh gurdwaras), 12 appointees from the Princely States, and \"14 co-opted members\".\nSee also\n*Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.punjablaws.gov.pk/laws/33.html  text of the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925]"
