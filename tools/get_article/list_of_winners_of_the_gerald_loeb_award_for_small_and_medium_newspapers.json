The \"Newspaper\" category was awarded in 1958–1973. It was split into two categories beginning in 1974: \"Small Newspapers\" and \"Large Newspapers\". A third category, \"Medium Newspapers,\" was created in 1987. The small and medium newspaper awards were combined together as \"Medium & Small Newspapers\" in 2009–2012, and \"Small & Medium Newspapers\" in 2013–2014. The last year newspaper categories were awarded was 2014. \"Small & Medium Newspapers\" was replaced by the platform-neutral category \"Local\" in 2015.\nGerald Loeb Award for Small Newspapers (1974–1983, 1985–2008)\n* 1974: Livingston V.
