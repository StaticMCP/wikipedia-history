Beginning with the settling of the land by Native Americans organized cultivation of the land and the raising of livestock has occurred in Louisiana through the colonial, plantation, and early modern periods to the present.\nHistory\nThe Mississippian period in Louisiana was when the Plaquemine and the Caddoan Mississippian cultures developed, and the peoples adopted extensive maize agriculture, cultivating different strains of the plant by saving seeds, selecting for certain characteristics, etc. The Plaquemine culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana began in 1200 and continued to about 1600. Examples in Louisiana include the Medora site, the archaeological type site for the culture in West Baton Rouge Parish whose characteristics helped define the culture, the Atchafalaya Basin Mounds in St. Mary Parish, the Fitzhugh Mounds in Madison Parish, the Scott Place Mounds in Union Parish, and the Sims site in St. Charles Parish.\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings. The boll weevil infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers.\nMany African Americans left the state in the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s through the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs. The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living in communities where they could vote.\nIn the 21st century farmers have experimented with advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to improve their operations.\nMajor crops\nSugarcane\nHistorically, sugar production was important in the growth of slavery in Louisiana. Sugarcane was first planted in New Orleans in 1751 by French Jesuit priests. After Étienne de Boré introduced sugar refining to Louisiana in 1795, sugarcane production in Louisiana expanded dramatically; practically all Louisiana sugar was grown on plantations using slave labor.\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the output of the Louisiana sugar industry increased substantially. By the 1840s, Louisiana produced between 25% and 50% of sugar consumed in the US but it was far from the World's biggest producer, which was Cuba. The American Civil War paralyzed the sugarcane industry in Louisiana, causing a decline in output from 177,000 tons in 1855 to 5,000 tons in 1865. By 1875, the output had risen to 60,000 tons.\nIn the 21st century sugarcane production in Louisiana has been largely confined to the Mississippi River Delta, where soils are fertile and the climate is warm. However, the sugar industry in Louisiana has expanded northward and westward into nontraditional sugarcane growing areas. Most of the expansion in sugarcane acreage has occurred when returns for competing crops, such as rice and soybeans, have decreased. Louisiana production has also expanded because of the adoption of high-yielding sugarcane varieties, along with investments in new harvesting combines.\nSpecialty crops\nFigs\nFig production is significant but mostly takes place on a small scale, historically most homesteads would have had a fig tree and today fig trees are among the most common fruit trees found in Louisiana yards and small orchards. Louisiana State University has a significant fig breeding program.\nTobacco\nPerique\nWine grapes\nSee also\n* 1811 German Coast uprising\n* Agriculture in Mississippi\n* American Sugar Refining\n* Benjamin Laurent Millaudon\n* Cajun cuisine\n* Cuisine of New Orleans\n* Cotton Belt\n* History of slavery in Louisiana\n* Tabasco sauce\n* Louisiana Agricultural Finance Authority\n* Louisiana Creole cuisine\n* Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation\n* List of plantations in Louisiana\n* Sugar industry of the United States\n* This Week in Louisiana Agriculture\n* Thibodaux massacre\n* William Kenner\n* P.
