It is the earliest known film depicting a person shrinking down.\nPlot\nA man, portrayed by Méliès, is split into two figures: an augmented and a shrunken version of himself. Méliès starts  standing in front of a doorway before the split, and his giant self and dwarf engage in jocularity, before moving back into the doorway and going their separate ways.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
