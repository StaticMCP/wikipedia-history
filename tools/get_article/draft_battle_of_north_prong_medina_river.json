Because of this, a force of around 15 militiamen began to track down the warriors using trails, in order to save the children and kick out the Comanches from the county.\nThe Battle\nOn an afternoon a few days after the raid of the Krawitz farmhouse, the militiamen were able to track down the Comanches at the North Prong of the Medina River. The militiamen are able to ambush the raiding Comanches, and end up getting into a battle with them. During the battle, the militia manage to recover the kidnapped children as they were inflicting heavy losses upon the Comanches. At the end of the battle, 6 Comanches lay dead in the river, with 1 white man being killed and another wounded. This is likely the last battle between Native Americans and white settlers in the county.\nReferences"
