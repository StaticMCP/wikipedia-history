      "text": "# Marjorie Stewart (actress)\n\nMarjorie Frances Esclairmonde Stewart (Lady Marling) (18 May 19129 November 1988) was a British actress and a member of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II.\nEarly life and career\nStewart was born on 18 May 1912 in Kensington, London, the daughter of Sir Frances Stewart. She made her theatrical debut at age five and continued to perform in various West End plays.\nWorld War II service\nIn 1939, Stewart joined the SOE. Initially employed as a lift operator, she quickly rose to the position of secretary to SOE Controller Patrick Howarth. Historical records suggest her primary contributions were administrative, though she played a key role in planning operations and possibly training female spies. Her connection with Operation Postmaster was mainly behind-the-scenes, involved in strategic planning rather than direct action.\nPersonal life\nStewart met Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps during the war and married him on 18 April 1942, shortly after Operation Postmaster. Subsequently, March-Phillips was killed later that year, and Stewart was left a widow. She gave birth to their daughter, Henrietta Sophia March-Phillipps, on June 15, 1943. After the war, she returned to her acting career and worked with at least 22 other productions. In November 1957 she married Major Sir John Stanley Vincent Marling, son of Sir Charles Murray Marling and Lucia Slade. Her married name became Marling.\nActing career post-war\nAfter leaving the SOE in 1946, Stewart resumed her acting career, taking on small roles in various films through the 1950s, including Little Big Shot and The Lost King. Her acting career, while not as prominent as her early years, remained a significant part of her life until her retirement.\nDeath\nStewart died on 9 November 1988.\nPopular culture\nIn the 2024 film The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, Stewart is portrayed by Eiza González. The film, while taking considerable creative liberties, highlights the often-overlooked roles of women in wartime espionage. Many aspects of her portrayal are fictionalised, including her direct participation in field operations and her depicted marksmanship skills.\nReferences"
