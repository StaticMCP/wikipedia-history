He played as a forward but was a noted goal-kicker, specialising in the now obsolete goal from mark.\nHasell served with the NZ Field Artillery in World War I and toured with the New Zealand Army team.\nIn 1920, Hasell toured New South Wales with the All Blacks and featured in five matches. Two of his appearances, against the Waratahs, were uncapped, but are considered Test matches by Australia.\nHasell was a member of the Canterbury side which were the only provincial side to beat the visiting Springboks in 1921.\nSee also\n*List of New Zealand national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
