They are located in Clinton, Iowa, and play their home games at NelsonCorp Field. From 1956 to 2020, they were members of Minor League Baseball's Midwest League. With Major League Baseball's reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, Clinton was not selected to continue in affiliated baseball.\nThe LumberKings play in the Prospect League's Western Conference – Northwest Division along with the Burlington Bees, Illinois Valley Pistol Shrimp, and Quincy Doggy Paddlers.\nClinton baseball history\nAfter beginning play in 1895, Clinton had sporadic teams in various leagues over the next few decades, as the Great Depression, World War I and World War II affected many baseball franchises. However, Clinton joined the Midwest League in 1956 and is now the oldest franchise in the league. The team has had several different major league affiliations: the Brooklyn Dodgers (1937–38), New York Giants (1939–41), Chicago Cubs (1947–49),  Pirates (1954–58 and 1966–68), White Sox (1959–65),  Pilots/Brewers (1969–70), Tigers (1971–75), Tigers/White Sox co-op (1976), Dodgers (1977–79), Giants (1980–94), Padres (1995–98), Reds (1999–2000), Expos (2001–02), and Rangers (2003–08), and Mariners (2009–18). In September 2018, they entered into a two-year player development contract with the Miami Marlins.\nAside from its time as the C-Sox (1960–65) and the Pilots (1966–76), the team used the parent major league team's nickname before adopting the LumberKings name for the 1994 season.\nThe 2010 LumberKings season was the subject of the 2013 book \"Class A: Baseball in the Middle of Everywhere\" by Lucas Mann.\nIn 2016, led by first year manager Mitch Canham, the LumberKings won 86 games to set the mark for most in a regular season by any team in Clinton franchise history.  The squad went on to sweep the Peoria Chiefs in the first round of the playoffs before defeating the Cedar Rapids Kernels in a thrilling three-game series.  Game three of the Western Division final ended with a Ricky Eusebio walk off hit to win 1–0 in extra innings.  The LumberKings would fall, however, in the Midwest League Championship in four games to the Great Lakes Loons.\nIn addition to playing host to the franchise record setting LumberKings (86-54), the LumberKings transformed their ballpark overnight following game two of the Midwest League Championship to become a football field.  The LumberKings played host to Camanche High School Football in the inaugural \"LumberBowl.\"  Camanche hosted Williamsburg High School in the game on September 16, 2016.  The Raiders of Williamsburg defeated the Indians 55–7.\nFollowing the 2020 season, the LumberKings were cut from the Midwest League and affiliated baseball as part of Major League Baseball's reorganization of the minor leagues. They later joined the Prospect League, a collegiate summer baseball league, for 2021.\nNelsonCorp Field\nThe home park for the LumberKings is NelsonCorp Field in Clinton, Iowa. The stadium was built in 1937 as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project and named Riverview Stadium, due to its location on the banks of the Mississippi River. It was renamed Alliant Energy Field in 2002 and renovated in 2005–2006 to a capacity of 4,000. It was renamed to Ashford University Field in 2011 and NelsonCorp Field in 2019. The Dimensions are: LF – 330, CF – 401, RF – 325.\nNo-hitters\nClinton has tossed 25 no-hitters. The list includes the following no-hitters:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Date !!
