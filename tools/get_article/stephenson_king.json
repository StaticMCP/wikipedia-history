He is the Senior Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Ports, Transport, Physical Development, and Urban Renewal. King was the former candidate for the United Workers Party (UWP). He now represents the constituency of Castries North as an Independent candidate as of July 2021, after resigning from the UWP.\nEarly life and education\nHe is the son of Grafton King; a renowned seaman, from Canouan, St.Vincent, and Marie Bernadette Satney, a seamstress from the village of Choiseul. He attended the Methodist Infant and Primary Schools for his early infant and primary schooling. Later, he was admitted to the Seventh Day Adventist Academy, where he continued his secondary education.\nPre-politics career\nFollowing the completion of his secondary education, King gained employment at the former St. Lucia Co-operative Bank Ltd (now 1st National Bank of St Lucia), where he served for two and a half years. He resigned in 1981 to accept an offer from the law firm of Floissac and Giraudy, where he served for seven years as Accountant, Trade Marks Clerk/Paralegal.\nPolitical career\nIn 1981 following the inaugural youth conference of the United Workers Party, King was elected the President of the party's youth arm. In 1982 after having actively participated in the election campaign of that year he was appointed a City Councilor of the Castries City Council and a board member of the St. Lucia Housing Authority, serving in both capacities for 5 years. During that period he also formed and became the founding President of the Rotaract Club of Saint Lucia, resigning in 1987 when he entered elective politics.\nStephenson entered the political fray on the island when he was nominated as the candidate for the Castries North-East Constituency. In the first election on 6 April 1987 he got 2,411 votes against former prime minister Michael Pilgrim of the St Lucia Labour Party (1772 votes) and Oswald Augustin of the Progressive Labour Party (846 votes). In the second (snap) election on 30 April 1987 he polled 2,731 votes to Pilgrim's 2,549 votes and Augustin's 375 votes. He was then appointed as a Cabinet Minister, serving as the Minister for Community Development, Social Affairs, Youth, Sports, and local Government.\nHe faced the electorate again in 1992 against lawyer Wilkie Larcher of the St Lucia Labour Party. He was able to register a bigger victory this time polling 3,511 to Larcher's 2,009. Following the election he was appointed to the Cabinet as the Minister for Health, Local Government, Information and Broadcasting.\nHe would succumb in the tumultuous defeat of the United Worker's Party in the 1997 election where he was defeated by George Odlum on a St Lucia Labour Party ticket. The results of the election show Odlum overcoming the incumbent 3960 to 2604, the lowest number of votes King would ever gain in an election. He took a nine-year sabbatical from elective politics although remaining chairman of the party for most of this period.\nFollowing a short-lived struggle between himself and Cybelle Cenac for that right King received the endorsement of the United Workers Party in 2006 to contest the general elections as the candidate for Castries North. He would defeat the sitting Minister of Agriculture at the polls, which also saw his United Worker's Party return to office.\nThe UWP won a majority of seats in the 2006 election, and a new government under Compton was sworn in on 19 December 2006. King was named Minister for Health and Labour Relations.\nCompton's illness in May 2007 prompted King to be named acting prime minister. In a cabinet reshuffle in early June 2007, he became Minister of Finance (inclusive of International Financial Services), External Affairs, Home Affairs, National Security, Labor, Information and Broadcasting. In an ironic twist, King assumed the mantle while a few months earlier he had been seen as a Lewis loyalist in the party's leadership race.\nCompton died on 7 September 2007, and King announced his death on 8 September.\nKing was subsequently sworn in as prime minister by Governor-General Pearlette Louisy on 9 September. The ten UWP members of the House of Assembly agreed on King's designation as prime minister.\nKing reshuffled the cabinet on 12 September. In addition to Prime Ministership, he assumed the roles of External Affairs, Home Affairs and National Security. King also held the modified portfolio of Minister of Finance (including International Financial Services), Economic Affairs, Economic Planning and National Development.\nEarlier in 2008 Prime Minister King came under pressure, first from leader of the opposition Dr. Kenny Anthony and then from his own parliamentary wing, to dismiss Economic Planning Minister [https://archive.stlucia.gov.lc/govfolks/sen_the_hon_ausbert_dauvergne.htm Ausbert D'Auvergne]. He eventually acquiesced and returned Choiseul representative Rufus Bousquet to his cabinet, defusing the impasse.\n.]]\nKing also dismissed the representative of Central Castries and Minister of Housing Richard Frederick from cabinet in 2011, following a scandal created by the revocation of his visitors and diplomatic visas by the United States Government.\nThe King administration suffered defeat in the 2011 general elections on 28 November 2011, obtaining only 6 out of 17 seats in Parliament. He was subsequently Leader of the Parliamentary Opposition from November 2011 to January 2014.\nWithdrawal from the United Workers Party\nKing was at the center of media and public attention in June 2021 as rumors went on that he was going to leave the United Workers Party. King remained silent for weeks before breaking his silence in a dubbed \"Address to the Nation\"; this address was televised live on the Saint Lucia Choice Media Network and Liberty FM Radio. In his address King stated that he will not contest the 2021 general election on a UWP ticket but as an independent candidate. Prime Minister Allen Chastanet accepted King's resignation on 8 July 2021. King would be replaced the day after on 9 July 2021 by President of the Saint Lucia Senate Jeannine Giraudy-McIntyre.\nKing went on to justify his withdrawal in his \"Address to The Nation\", stating:\nKing would go on to receive public backlash. Mary Francis, an attorney at law, commented \"There is a price to pay for treachery and time will tell\", referencing to King's upcoming decision. Some members of the public took to social media to express their disappointment and disagreement, whilst others agreed with the decision.\nKing won re-election as an independent in the 2021 Saint Lucian general election, defeating his UWP opponent Jeannine Giraudy-McIntyre with 69.5% of the vote.\nPersonal life\nKing married Rosella Nestor, his longtime partner in a wedding ceremony in Miami on Saturday 29 November 2008.\nSee also\n* List of prime ministers of Saint Lucia\n* United Workers Party\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://opm.govt.lc/ Office of the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia]\n*Biography available in"
