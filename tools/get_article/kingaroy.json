The town is situated on the junction of the D'Aguilar and the Bunya Highways,  north-west of the state capital Brisbane and  south west of Gympie.  In the , the locality of Kingaroy had a population of 10,266 people.\nKingaroy is the seat of the South Burrnett Region. It is known as the \"Peanut Capital of Australia\" because Australia's largest peanut processing plant is located in the town and its peanut silo dominates the skyline. Kingaroy is also known as the hometown of former Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.\nGeography\nKingaroy is surrounded by extensive (and very picturesque) farmlands interspersed with low rolling hills. The Booie Range lies immediately north-east of the town and the Bunya Mountains about  to the south-west.\nThe Stuart River () flows northwards on the western outskirts of the town. The locality is part of the Burnett River catchment. The productive lands of the catchment feature sedimentary floodplains. The rich fertile soils of the floodplains are the agricultural and resource backbone of the region.  While there are benefits of the flooding there are also risks including the loss of vegetation in riparian zones, biosecurity issues and spread of weed species.\nThe locality sits in the Tarong Coal Basin.\nKingaroy varies in altitude / elevation / height above sea level from about  (highlight point) to  (highlight point) above sea level.\nEdenvale is a neighbourhood within the locality (), which takes its name from the Edenvale railway station which was named on 15 March 1911 by the Queensland Railways Department, because the land for the railway station was resumed from \"Paradise Farm\".\nClimate\nKingaroy experiences an elevation-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), with very warm, relatively wet summers and mild, dry winters with cold nights. Annual precipitation averages , with a summer maximum. Record temperatures have ranged from  on 12 February 2017 to  on 18 July 1961.\n}}\nThe original weather station at Kingaroy's Prince Street had been recording rainfall since 1905 and temperatures since 1947. However, it closed in 2000, in favour of the new, more advanced weather station at the town's airport  SW.\n}}\nEtymology\nThe origin of the name Kingaroy is usually claimed to be derived from the Wakka Wakka Aboriginal word for 'Red Ant'. The local Kingaroy Rugby League football team is known as \"the Red Ants\" and a Red Ant features on the old Kingaroy Shire coat of arms. A Wakka Wakka Word List provides the following explanation: \"Derived from 'king', a small black ant, and 'dhu'roi', meaning hungry. The name was suggested by a local Aboriginal helper of the surveyor, Hector Munro, who surveyed the original grazing holding of this name, on account of these ants being a pest at the survey camp.\". Munro selected Wakka Wakka words describing various species of ants when he surveyed a number of local towns, including Taabinga (dha' be'ngga) and Mondure (mon'dhur).\nHistory\nWakka Wakka (Waka Waka, Wocca Wocca, Wakawaka) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the Burnett River catchment. The Wakka Wakka language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the North and South Burnett Regional Council, particularly the towns of Cherbourg, Murgon, Kingaroy, Gayndah, Eidsvold and Mundubbera.\nRural settlement of the area dates back to 1843 when one of the first selections was made at Burrandowan (west of Kingaroy) by squatter and explorer Henry Stuart Russell. Even through Russell was reputedly the first European to realise the potential of the South Burnett, it was Simon Scott of Taromeo (now Blackbutt) and the Haly brothers of Taabinga who brought the first flocks of sheep to the area in the late 1850s.\nIn 1878, the district where Kingaroy now stands was settled by the Markwell brothers. When the first resumptions were made from the enormous Taabinga holding, the brothers selected two adjoining areas and in 1883 these leases were converted to freehold and became known as the 'Kingaroy Paddock'. The corner of this paddock was located on what is now known as Haly Street, named after the brothers who settled at Taabinga Station about  south-west of present-day Kingaroy. A small, prosperous village grew up around Taabinga in the 1890s.\nThe opening of the 5th stage of Nanango railway line to its terminus at Kingaroy railway station in the newly laid-out town of Kingaroy (known as the 56-mile peg) in 1904 led to a land explosion around Kingaroy and the development of Kingaroy as it now exists. Taabinga quickly declined into a ghost town by the end of World War I and today the original Taabinga Homestead and a few outbuildings are all that remain of it. The area opposite Kingaroy Airport is today known as \"Taabinga Village\" but is really only a suburb of Kingaroy.\nTaabinga Village Provisional School opened on 10 August 1897. On 1 January 1909, it became Taabinga Village State School. On 16 July 1961, Taabinga Village State School was closed and pupils transferred to the new Taabinga State School in Kingaroy.\nMalar Provisional School opened in 1901. On 1 January 1909, it became Malar State School. There were a number of temporary closures until the school closed permanently in 1955. The school was \"via Kingaroy\".\nMount Jones Provisional School opened on 20 January 1902. In 1905, it was renamed Kingaroy Provisional School. On 1 January 1909, it became Kingaroy State School. On 19 February 1918, a secondary department was added, which was discontinued in 1958 when Kingaroy State High School opened.\nLogboy Provisional School opened on 22 April 1902. On 1 January 1909, it became Logboy State School. It was at 289 Weens Road (). In 1911, it was moved to 215–227 Siefert Street, Crawford, and renamed Crawford State School, opening with 29 students.\nThe first Kingaroy Post Office opened by 1902 (a receiving office had been open from 1895) and was renamed Taabinga Village in 1905, when Kingaroy Railway Station office opened. This was renamed Kingaroy in 1907. The Taabinga Village office closed in 1929.\nErin Vale State School opened in 1911. In 1912 it was renamed Stuart Valley State School. It closed in 1961. It was \"via Kingaroy\".\nKingaroy's first general hospital opened on 19 November 1914. Prior the only hospital located in Kingaroy was St. Aubyn's private hospital, which opened in 1910. Clydebank Hospital became Kingaroy's second private hospital, which later became a hostel for children. Kingaroy's new public hospital was opened 7 October 1839.The foundation stone of the Kingaroy Soldiers' Memorial Rotunda was laid on 25 April 1922 (ANZAC Day) by the RSL president Sergeant Norman Booth. It was dedicated on 29 June 1932 by Mayor-General Sir Thomas William Glasgow.\nThe Kingaroy Branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association was established 22 August 1922 with Florence Daphne Youngman of Taabinga Homestead as the first president. In 1926 her husband Arthur Youngman donated land at 122 Kingaroy Street and Charlie Gills built the first rooms. On 24 November 1956 a hall was built at the rear of the rooms to allow for catering of weddings and functions.\nSt Mary's Catholic Primary School opened in January 1929. In 1980 it merged with St Mary's Catholic Secondary School to become South Burnett Catholic College.\nThe town's wastewater treatment plant was established circa 1940 with the treated water being discharged into the Stuart River. A major upgrade occurred between 2014–2016 resulting greater processing capacity at greater efficiency with treated water now being recycled for use on sporting fields and the golf course.\nThe Royal Australian Air Force had a significant operational and training presence in the region during the World War II, the first squadrons deploying to the town's airport about mid-1942. At least eight squadrons were based at RAAF Kingaroy then (viz. Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 15, 75, 92 and 93 Squadrons), together with No. 3 Initial Training School. Aircraft operated there by the RAAF included Avro Ansons, CAC Wirraways, DAP Beauforts, DH Mosquitos, Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks and Bristol Beaufighters. Kingaroy R.A.A.F. Post Office was open from 7 August 1942 until 28 February 1946.\nThe presence of the US Army in Queensland generally and more particularly in Kingaroy created a need to supply them with very large quantities of navy beans (known as baked beans in Australia) which led to widespread planting of navy beans in the Kingaroy area from 1940 with seed supplied by the US Army. Such was the military importance of navy beans that all war-time production of navy beans was done under contract to the Australian Government and subject to the National Security Act. After the war, the industry struggled with a number of issues including tariffs, marketing, processing and being controlled from Brisbane. With the vast majority of bean growers in Queensland being in the Kingaroy area and following the destruction of the processing factory in Toowoomba, local growers decided to form a co-operative based in Kingaroy to process and market the product locally on a site provided by Kingaroy Shire Council who wanted to encourage the project. Since 1993, the cooperative is known as Bean Growers Australia.\nSt Mary's Catholic Secondary School opened in 1946. In 1980 it merged with St Mary's Catholic Primary School to become South Burnett Catholic College.\nKingaroy State High School opened on 28 January 1958, replacing the secondary department at Kingaroy State School.\nSouth Burnett Catholic College opened in 1980, as the merger of St Mary's Catholic Primary and Secondary Schools.\nKingaroy Christian College opened on 24 April 1984 and closed on 6 May 1999. The college had buried a time capsule on 24 April 1994. On 16 April 2013, former students dug up the time capsule with the assistance of the owners of the former school site. The time capsule contained a number of small items including a floppy disk.\nSt John's Lutheran Primary School opened on 23 January 1989 with 26 students and 2 teachers. The school was established by relocating the school buildings from the closed Mannuem Creek State School in Mannuem. In 2014 the school expanded to offer junior secondary schooling (Years 7 to 9).\nKingaroy celebrated its centenary in 2004.\nKingaroy is also noted for being the first region in Australia to be placed on Level 7 [https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/kingaroy-dam-runs-dry/news-story/699e81413368586ea4d98683195963b6 Water Restrictions], which occurred on 1 October 2007.\nIn 2017, Kingaroy Magistrates and District Court underwent a $5.3 million refurbishment. The improvements included a full internal and external refurbishment and a new secure interview room for witnesses to give evidence.

Rich volcanic soil, hot dry summers and cold winters proved to be ideal conditions for wine growing. Quite a number of vineyards were established in the region, and the success of their wine enables the South Burnett region, which includes Kingaroy, to promote the area as a tourist destination. The success of these enterprises has been largely attributed to the scenery of the location, and has benefited the local economy.\nBean Growers Australia is a cooperative association with its headquarters at 82-84 River Road () where it has its processing factory.

The original mascot from the defunct Kingaroy Peanut Festival was also in attendance.  Kingaroy's Peanut Festival was an annual event held from 1959 until it was axed in 2011 following the Queensland floods due to a lack of community support.\nAlthough the idea for such as landmark had regularly been suggested for at least thirty years prior, it wasn't until 2017 when the concept for The Big Peanut garnered substantial support after a social media campaign was launched called \"Kingaroy Needs A Big Peanut\" which drew support from South Burnett Regional Council. Prior to the installation of The Big Peanut, the landmark was depicted in a 2020 episode of the ABC Kids program Bluey.\nIn March 2022, a 29-year-old man appeared in court on 15 charges including 12 counts of wilful damage by graffiti after he used spray paint to vandalise The Big Peanut and other local sites across Kingaroy between 3 January 2022 and 10 January 2022. He was ordered to pay restitution, complete 40 hours of unpaid graffiti removal work and also fined $250 for drug offences.\nNotable people\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.southburnett.qld.gov.au/ South Burnett Regional Council] – Official site\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090402005719/http://winefood.southburnett.com.au/ Kingaroy Wine & Food in the Park Festival]"
