These artifacts, whether handwoven traditionally or their 21st century contemporary variations, are considered exemplars of functional basketry in the Philippines and among Filipinos.\nThe sacred, ritual pasiking of the Ifugao tribal group is called the , not to be confused with the more common . Both of those types have abnut palm bast and/or apangdan vine weatherproofing. The bangaw has a rigid, fixed flap over the shoulders, while the  inabnutan has a flexible woven flap.\nAnother sacred, ritual pasiking of the Highland Philippine Bontoc and Kankanaey peoples is called the . Representing an ancestor figure, the takba is an active participant in  rituals. These takba must be fed or its contents recharged periodically. To neglect or disrespect a takba is to risk punishment of becoming \"bagtit\" or demented.\nSome of the Northern Philippine tribal groups called Igorots or Cordillerans that weave pasiking are the Apayaos or Isneg, the Tinguian of Abra province, the Kalingas of Kalinga province, the Gaddang, the Bugkalot, the Applai, the Bontocs of Bontoc, Mountain Province, the Ilagod, the Bago, the Kankana-ey, the Balangao, the Ibaloi, the Ifugaos, the Ikalahan, the Kalanguya, the Karao, and the Ilongots. It is also woven using rattan by non-Cordilleran persons.\nThe most common materials used in construction are rattan and bamboo. There are also rare pasiking specimens utilizing deer hide (parfleche) and wood.  There are at least two specimens utilizing a whole turtle shell (one is in the Museo ng Kaalamáng Katutubò collection in Manila,) and at least one documented sample in crocodile skin (in the George Schenk collection in Banaue.)\nA deconstructed version of the pasiking, including dozens of antique, vintage and contemporary variants, were exhibited in the BenCab Museum. There are also 21st century pasiking that are made of recyclable materials like plastic cargo straps, canvas conveyor belts, and recycled detonation cord.\nAn exhibit at Museo Kordilyera at University of the Philippines Baguio from December to January 2022 showcased several varieties of these traditional backpacks.\nIn the 1970s on through the 1980s, the pasiking has also been a symbol among Filipino students for nationalist activism. There was a decline of making traditional bamboo crafts, including the pasiking, during the 1980s but in the mid-2010s, the industry of bamboo crafts came into resurgence with the help of the Philippines' Department of Trade and Industry.\nFile:AVBC IMG 0303 (2).jpg|Pasiking in various styles\nFile:AVBCpasiking 10171 IFG RPPC.jpg|Ifugao pasiking during the early American period in Camp John Hay, Baguio City\nFile:AVBC IMG 1364 via Padmapani Perez Oct 2012.jpg|Contemporary 21st-century pasiking using recycled plastic polypropylene cargo straps\nFile:Pasiking hilera DSM MBC 2004.jpg|Pasiking specimens; photographed in Pt.
