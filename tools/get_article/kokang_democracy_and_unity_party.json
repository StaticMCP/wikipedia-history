The KDUP was re-established in 2010. In the 2010 elections, it contested constituencies in Lashio, Kunlong and Hsenwi Townships in Shan State, but again failed to win a seat.\nThe KDUP contested one House of Nationalities seat in the 2012 by-elections, Shan State's Constituency No. 3, fielding party's chairman, Luo Xingguang, who was believed to have ties to drug traffickers Lo Hsing Han and Liu Guoxi. In the 2015 elections the party succeeded in winning a seat in the House of Representatives and one seat in the Shan State Hluttaw.\nReferences"
