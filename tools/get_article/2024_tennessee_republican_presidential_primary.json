The contest was held on Super Tuesday alongside primaries in 14 other states.\nDonald Trump dominated across most of the state, with exceptions in certain traditionally Republican suburban areas where Nikki Haley performed well, including southern Davidson County, parts of Williamson County, and some predominantly white suburban and urban areas in Shelby, Knox, and Hamilton counties. Despite these pockets of support for Haley, Trump still carried every county by a comfortable margin.\nCandidates\nThe filing deadline for candidates was on December 5, 2023, at noon.
