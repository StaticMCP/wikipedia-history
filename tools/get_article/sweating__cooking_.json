Sweating usually results in tender, sometimes translucent, pieces. Sweating is often a preliminary step to further cooking in liquid;}} This differs from sautéing in that sweating is done over a much lower heat, sometimes with salt added to help draw moisture away, and making sure that little or no browning takes place.\nThe sweating of vegetables has been used as a technique in the preparation of coulis.\nIn Italy, this cooking technique is known as soffritto, meaning \"sub-frying\" or \"under-frying\". In Italian cuisine, it is a common technique and preliminary step in the preparation of risotto, soups and sauces.\nFile:Sweating onions.jpg|Close-up view of sweated onions\nSee also\n* Braising\n* Frying\n* Sautéing\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/glossary/g/sweat.htm Definition]\n* [http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/how-to-sweat-vegetables/ How to Sweat Vegetables]"
