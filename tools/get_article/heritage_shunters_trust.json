Ltd. which was founded in 1989.\nOverview\nHST is a railway preservation society and is the only preservation society that specialises in the preservation of ex-British Railway diesel shunters in the United Kingdom, although they do have a Class 14 which is a Type 1 locomotive and not a shunter.\nMost of the locomotives are kept at Rowsley, Derbyshire, England, on the site of preserved railway Peak Rail but the company is a separate outfit. Galas are usually held twice a year where the collection is put on display and brake van rides are hauled by an assortment from the active fleet. Guided tours of the collection, and the viewing of restoration work being undertaken, are available most weekends for a small charge.\nFormation and purpose\nThe Heritage Shunters Trust (HST) was established in 1989 with the primary objective of preserving and restoring British Railway diesel shunters. These locomotives, once ubiquitous in rail yards and industrial sidings, were facing an uncertain future due to the decline of traditional shunting operations.\nDiesel locomotives\nHST has the following locomotives.\n;Ex-British Rail\n* British Rail Class 01 No.  D2953 (First diesel loco to be sold by BR into private industry & pioneer 01)\n* British Rail Class 02 Nos.
