In Geba, the Portuguese found themselves powerless to counter Musa Molo's demands for taxes and levies. However, by 1886, Nbuku, the ruler of Ganadu and one of Musa Molo's provincial chiefs, had grown discontented with his Musa's rule. Seizing the opportunity, the Portuguese asked the Nbuku to form an alliance against Musa Molo. This alliance was solidified, and preparations began for a coordinated military campaign.\nBattle\nOn 6 September 1886, Lieutenant Francisco António Marques Geraldes, commanding the Portuguese garrison at Geba, led a force of 80 Portuguese soldiers, supported by 4,300 Fula and Mandinka allies, 170 Biafadas, 120 grumetes, and two pieces of artillery. The coalition launched an assault on the fortified tabanca of Fancá.\nThe battle lasted three hours, during which Musa Molo's forces resisted fiercely but were ultimately overwhelmed. The Portuguese and allied forces forced Musa Molo and his warriors to abandon their positions. Retreating north to Casamance, Musa Molo left behind the dead and wounded.\nAftermath\nAfter their victory, the Portuguese began incorporating parts of Fuladu into the newly proclaimed province of \"Guiné Portuguesa.\"\nThe operations would finish on September 15, but Marques Geraldes would lead another campaign against Musa Molo in 1889-1891.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
