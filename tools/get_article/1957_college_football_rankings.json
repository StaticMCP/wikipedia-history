College football's governing body, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), did not issue rankings or conduct a championship game or playoffs to determine a national champion. The most widely-reported rankings were published by two of the major news agencies based on weekly polling conducted during the season and at the end of the regular season.\n* The Associated Press (AP) conducted a weekly poll of sports writers throughout the country. This was known as the AP poll or the \"writers poll\".\n* The United Press (UP) conducted a weekly poll of the nation's head football coaches. This was known as the UP poll or the \"coaches poll\".\nAt the end of the regular season, Auburn was ranked No. 1 in the AP poll, and Ohio State was ranked No. 1 in the UP poll. Auburn did not play in a bowl game; Ohio State won the 1958 Rose Bowl. Neither agency conducted polling after the bowl games.\nAdditional rankings were published at the end of the season by the International News Service (INS), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), and Litkenhous, each of which ranked Ohio State at No. 1.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nAP poll\nThe final AP poll was released on December 2, at the end of the regular season, weeks before the major bowls.

The rankings were based on voting by a five-man committee consisting of Bert McGrane of the Des Moines Register & Tribune; Bill Rives of the Dallas News; Bill Leiser of the San Francisco Chronicle; Fred Russell of the Nashville Banner; and I.R. McVay of Look magazine. Points were counted on the basis of three points for a first-place vote, two points for second, and one point for third. The top-ranked team in the FWAA rankings received the Grantland Rice Award. The top teams determined by the FWAA were:\n1. Ohio State - 8 points (two first-place votes and one second-place vote)\n2. Auburn - 5 points (three-way tie, each with one first-place vote)\n2. Navy - 5 points (three-way tie, each with one first-place vote)\n2. Michigan State - 5 points (three-way tie, each with one first-place vote)\n5. Oklahoma - 4 points\n6. Ole Miss - 2 points\n7. Iowa - 1 point\nINS poll\nThe final 1957 INS rankings were released at the beginning of December. The rankings were determined by the votes of a \"panel of experts\" consisting of former coaches Bernie Bierman and Andy Kerr, sportswriter Francis J. Powers, INS columnist Bob Considine, and INS sports editor John Barrington. The INS panel selected the following as their top ten teams:\n1. Ohio State, 38 points\n2. Auburn, 37 points\n3. Michigan State, 33 points\n4. Oklahoma, 26 points\n5. Iowa, 25 points\n6. Ole Miss, 20 points\n7. Navy, 20 points\n8. Rice, 12 points\n9. Texas A&M, 8 points\n10. Notre Dame, 4 points\nLitkenhous Ratings\nAn early mathematical ranking system was developed by Vanderbilt University professor Edward Litkenhous. These were known as the Litkenhous Ratings or the Litkenhous \"difference-by-score\" rankings. Whereas other rankings were limited to the top 10 or 20 teams, Litkenhous ranked over 550 college football teams. The final Litkenhous rankings were issued in early December 1957, and his complete rankings from 1 to 170 are set forth below.\n1. Ohio State (9–1) - 106.7\n2. Auburn (10–0) - 103.3\n3.
