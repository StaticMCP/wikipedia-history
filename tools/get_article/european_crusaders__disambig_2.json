Although Team Europe operates with a similar concept, the Crusaders were notably the first female all European team to compete in Australia for the Australian Football International Cup. The team was also the first female combined team to play in the International Cup with players originating from Croatia, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Northern Ireland  and Scotland. A male European Crusaders team was originally formed but disbanded prior to the tournament.\n2017 AFL International Cup\nIn 2017 the European Crusaders formed and competed in the International AFL Women's Competition. Meeting only a few days before the beginning of the tournament, the Crusaders became known for \"their spirit, determination and improvement\" as it progressed.
