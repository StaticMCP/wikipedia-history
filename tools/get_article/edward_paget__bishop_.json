His first post was as a curate at St&nbsp;Frideswide's, Poplar after which he emigrated to Southern Africa. Initially Vicar of Benoni he was appointed to the colonial episcopate as the Bishop of Southern Rhodesia in 1925. The diocese was renamed to Mashonaland in 1952 when that of Matabeleland was divided from it; after thirty years as bishop, in 1955, he was additionally elected the inaugural Archbishop of Central Africa. He retired to Gillits in 1957, but came out of retirement to serve as Vicar-General of the Diocese of Johannesburg in late 1960 (the bishop, Ambrose Reeves, had suddenly been deported). A service of thanksgiving for his life was held on 24 May 1971 at the headquarters of the USPG in London. In 1956, a boarding house at Peterhouse Boys School in Marondera was named after him.\nReferences"
