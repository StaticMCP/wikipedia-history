Some use Square point-of-sale system, although it has also been reported that PayPal and Square will terminate accounts from cannabis-related businesses. A cashless transaction system was created by POSaBIT and used in Washington cannabis establishments  2017. It would convert US dollars from a customer's debit card swipe to cryptocurrency for expenditures made at the retail establishment.\nSee also\nReferences\nSources\n*}}\n*\n*}}\n*\n*}}\n*\n*}}\n*}}\n*}}\n*}}\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://dfi.wa.gov/banks/marijuana Marijuana in Washington State - Financial Services Issues], Washington State Department of Financial Institutions\n*[https://lcb.wa.gov/taxreporting/marijuana-tax-reporting-guide Marijuana Tax Reporting Guide] , Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, 2016\n*[https://www.salalcu.org/business/cannabis-industry/ Cannabis industry], Salal Credit Union\n*[https://www.fincen.gov/frequently-requested-foia-processed-records Marijuana banking updates] at FinCEN \"Frequently Requested FOIA-Processed Records\" site"
