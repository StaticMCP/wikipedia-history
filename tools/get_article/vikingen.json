Among the contributors were the satirical illustrators Olaf Krohn, Andreas Bloch, Gustav Lærum and Olaf Gulbransson.\nwith the union badge of Norway and Sweden. Caricature by Gustav Lærum in Vikingen 1905]]\nHistory and profile\nThe weekly comic magazine Vikingen was established by printer Henning Tønsberg in Kristiania in 1862. The first issue was published on 4 October 1862. Johan Ludvig Vibe, Johan Schønheyder and Olaf Skavlan were also instrumental in the establishment of the magazine and they worked as editors.\nIn the beginning the magazine had only 11 subscribers, but the magazine attracted some attention and it soon became an important, if not exactly serious, organ of public debate, humour and satire.\nContemporary celebrities were frequently featured. Among the first people frequently parodied in the magazine's columns was the young playwright Henrik Ibsen; he strongly disliked being a subject of rumors. To keep the writers' identity hidden, editorial meetings were held in secret at a back room of Jacob L'Orsas Café. The first illustrator was August Schneider, who designed the magazine's first title vignette in 1862, and further was member of the editorial council. He was many years later followed by the likes of Olaf Krohn, Andreas Bloch, Gustav Lærum and Olaf Gulbransson.\nThe magazine ceased publication in 1947.\nCultural references\nThe magazine startles the unnamed hero of Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger (1890) when it is offered to him while lost in thought.\nReferences"
