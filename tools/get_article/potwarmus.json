The type species, Potwarmus primitivus, was described based on fossils found in the Chinji Formation of Pakistan and originally considered a species of Antemus before the genus Potwarmus was erected in 1988. The species Potwarmus thailandicus from Thailand was likewise classified under Antemus when it was described in 1985 prior to the erection of Potwarmus as a new genus. Potwarmus flynni, known from Middle Miocene Hofuf Formation of Saudi Arabia, was described in 2009. Potwarmus mahmoodi was described in 2016 based on fossils from the Zinda Pir Dome of western Pakistan. An undescribed species is known from Libya.\nReferences"
