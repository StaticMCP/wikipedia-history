After the proposal fell through, they were sold to the Queensland Railways, entering service on the Southern & Western Railway. They were used as shunters.\nPer Queensland Railway's classification system, they were designated the 6D13 class, the 6 representing the number of driving wheels, the D that it was a tank locomotive, and the 13 the cylinder diameter in inches.\nLionel (No.70) was purchased by Queensland Rail in 1884, and was used for shunting. It gained notoriety when its boiler exploded at Roma Street Station on 29 August 1898. It was repaired and later written off in 1926.\nClass list\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Worksnumber\n!Southern & WesternRailways number\n!Queensland Railwaysnumber\n!Name\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|2826\n|align=center|70\n|align=center|70\n|Lionel\n|February 1884\n|Written off April 1926\n|-\n|align=center|2827\n|align=center|71\n|align=center|71\n|Lion\n|March 1884\n|Written off June 1926\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
