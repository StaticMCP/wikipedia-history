It opened on July 27, 1888.\nDesign\nRogers and MacFarlane of Detroit designed the depot, one of several Richardsonian Romanesque-style stations between Detroit and Chicago in the late nineteenth century. Masonry of Lake Superior red sandstone, noted for its distinctive patterns, provides one of the most striking aspects of the Depot's exterior.  Another prominent feature of the Depot is its clock tower.\nHistory\nThomas Edison as well as Presidents William Howard Taft and Gerald Ford visited here. The depot was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1918, Penn Central in 1968, and Amtrak in 1970. The depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\nThe station served New York Central trains on the Chicago - Detroit route, such as the Chicago Mercury and the Twilight Limited and trains on the Chicago - Detroit - New York (via southwestern Ontario) itinerary, such as the Wolverine.\nIn 1982, Amtrak moved operations to a newer facility located five blocks to the south on the Grand Trunk Western Railroad line, as part of a line consolidation that saw Conrail's ex-New York Central line through downtown closed and removed. The current Amtrak station services the Detroit to Chicago, and the Port Huron, MI to Chicago routes. The Michigan Central Depot sat empty for seven years.\nIn 1989, restaurateurs Peter Jubeck and Ross Simpson purchased the depot and transformed it into a restaurant named 'Clara's on the River' which opened June 8, 1992. 'Clara's on the River was a sister restaurant to the now closed Clara's Lansing Station', located in the Union Depot (Lansing, Michigan), which is now a Starbucks.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://claras.com/ Official page of Clara's on the River]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/clarasontheriver Official Facebook Page of Clara's on the River]"
