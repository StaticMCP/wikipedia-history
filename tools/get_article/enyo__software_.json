Initially developed by Palm, it was later acquired by Hewlett-Packard in April 2010 and then released under an Apache 2.0 license. It is sponsored by LG Electronics and Hewlett-Packard.\nBootplate\nBootplate is a simplified way of creating an app, providing a skeleton of the program's folder tree. The Bootplate template provides a complete starter project that supports source control and cross-platform deployment out of the box. It can be used to facilitate both the creation of a new project and the preparation for its eventual deployment.\nLibraries\n*Layout: Fittables, scrollers, lists, drawers, panels.\n*Onyx: Based on the original styled of webOS/Touchpad design but available for use on any platform.\n*Moonstone: Used by LG SmartTV apps but available for use on any platform.\n*Spotlight: To support key-based interactions and \"point and click\" events on remote controls and keyboards.\n*Mochi: Advanced user interface library. It has been maintained by the community since the team behind webOS released this abandoned interface from Palm/HP as open source. This library  is not included on bootplate right now, but has design documents.\n*enyo-iLib: Internationalization and localization library, it wrap ilib's functionality on Enyo apps. G11n was another library that has been deprecated on newer versions of enyo.\n*Canvas\n*Extra\n*enyo-cordova: Enyo-compatible library to automatically include platform-specific Cordova library (WIP).\nUse\nThe following projects are built with Enyo:\n* LG Smart TV apps\n* Openbravo Mobile and Web POS\n* xTuple ERP Web and Mobile App\nPartial list of Enyo apps can be found on Enyo Apps. Some developers can be found on Enyo Developer Directory.\nExamples\nThis is an example of a 'Hello world program' in Enyo\nenyo.kind({\nname: \"HelloWorld\",\nkind: enyo.Control,\ncontent: 'Hello, World!',\n});\nnew HelloWorld().write();\nSupported platforms\nIn general, Enyo can run across all relatively modern, standards-based web environments, but because of the variety of them there are three priority tiers.
