On the day before, 47 of them were accused of subversion. The 47 did not eat during the 14-hour trial period. By 1 am, 16 had not completed the statement of the reasons for applying bail.

The rally in London was held at Piccadilly Circus.The rally members waved the banner of Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times, and some used the traditional instrument of the British Army Band to play Glory to Hong Kong. Ted Hui, former Legislative Council member who participated in the primary election of the pro-democracy party, attended the event. He felt very angry about the charges and was very emotionally troubled. It is hoped that it can further promote the implementation of sanctions by various countries. In the Piccadilly Gardens of Manchester, more than 100 people participated in the rally. Although the name of the rally has the word \"sitting\", most of the participants stood on the grass. Samson Chan, Hui's assistant, gave a speech. The reporter found that the participants were mainly \"new immigrants\" who entered the country through LOTR, while foreign students accounted for only a minority. In Reading, a city on the west side of London, participants gathered in silence and lined up in two rows on the street. As the UK was still lockdown, police officers arrived at the scene and asked the participants to leave immediately. Participants dispersed peacefully.\nFile:Reading protest to Support Hong Kong 20210301.png|In Reading, the participants gathered in silence\nFile:倫敦聲援香港 47 名被捕人士 view 20210301.png|The rally in Piccadilly Circus in London.

The department pointed to the words \"in accordance with the law\" which Xia had added; it refused to elaborate on the significance of this comment in this context, and on the question of whether anyone else would be able to legally use the formulation of Xia.\nJohn Lee speaks to the UN Human Rights Council\nSecretary for Security John Lee said in a video conference of the United Nations Human Rights Council that since the implementation of the Hong Kong national security law in July 2020, there has been a significant reduction in the number of people advocating Hong Kong independence and the number of arrests involved in violent incidents has also been reduced by 50%, the effect is described as significant. He also emphasized that the national security law has not harmed the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens. He pointed out that so far only 99 people have been arrested for violating the national security law, accounting for a small part of the overall population. Lee reiterated that all prosecutions related to the national security law are carried out fairly in accordance with the law.

Defence lawyers voiced criticism of the court over defendants not being given the opportunity to shower or change clothes for four days since they were detained on 28 February. One of the defendants, Lawrence Lau, 53, also a practicing barrister, apologised for not bathing for three days before addressing the court. He added: \"When someone is stripped of their freedom, they are also stripped of their personal hygiene and appearance, which makes them lose confidence. I do not understand why I ended up in custody when I have been law-abiding my whole life.\" A defence counsel also told the court that his defendants had not been sent back to the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre until nearly 7 am on 2 March. \"The defendants have to attend court hearings that started at 8 this morning [yesterday], which means they could only rest for at most two hours, causing them to be physically tormented,\" he said. Amnesty International Hong Kong program manager Lam Cho Ming warned that an extended hearing \"along with insufficient time to rest could potentially violate the right to a fair trial.\" Chief magistrate Victor So called a halt to the second day of hearings at 10:36&nbsp;pm on 2 March.\nAnother defendant, Winnie Yu, 33, a nurse and chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, was suspended from her duties by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority after she was prosecuted.\nFile:People queue outside West Kowloon Court 20210302.png|Fewer people queued up for the public gallery to be called up than on the first day\nFile:PTU Police in Tung Chau Street standby 20210302.png|Police officers on guard outside the court\nFile:Supporters in Tung Chau Street 20210302.jpg|Parents brought their children in the court to \"send cars\" to stay behind to support the arrested\nFile:2 people stop and search outside West Kowloon Court 20210302.png|Two citizens were stopped for investigation because they failed to show their press cards\nFile:Alexandra Wong Fung Yiu outside West Kowloon Court view 20210302.png|Grandma Wong's solidarity outside the court\n3 March\nThird day of 47 pro-democracy activists trial\nand Raymond Chan at the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre before being sent to the court]]\nEight defendants had not addressed the court regarding their bail applications in the more than 24-hour marathon hearing. On the third day on 3 March, 47 pro-democracy defendants have yet to submit their statements on bail. Before the trial started at 12 pm, the live broadcast system showed the problem of not being able to hear the conversation or voice in the court again, causing the family members to question the \"secret interrogation.\" On the other hand, the live broadcasts in the press room and the auditorium both had problems with pictures and no sound, which caused the reporters on the spot to clamor. Barrister Margaret Ng said that the court has no way to control its own procedures. Do we still have judicial independence?\" However, Kit Hung, the senior news director of the Judiciary, stated that no in-court voices will be played before the court session. This statement caused dissatisfaction with Figo Chan, the convener of Civil Human Rights Front.\nand colonial-era flag]]\nAt the same time, four Civic Party defendants Alvin Yeung, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam and Lee Yue-shun announced their resignations from the party, with Yeung resigning from the party. Barrister Alan Leong, chairman of the party, terminated his legal representation of the four. Lam Cheuk-ting, Clarisse Yeung and Gwyneth Ho also told the court they had terminated the services of their legal representatives. Alvin Yeung said before addressing the court: \"As a barrister, I would never have imagined that I would have to address the court in the docks. On March 2 five years ago, I was sworn in as a legislative councillor, fighting for Hongkongers, but five years later, I am fighting for my own freedom.\" Chief Magistrate Victor So adjourned the third day proceedings at 8:30&nbsp;pm.\nHong Kong's degree of freedom dropped to 52 points\nThe international human rights monitoring organization Freedom House released the 2021 Global Freedom Survey Report. The total score of Hong Kong's freedom fell from last year by 3 points to 52 points.

Deputy Secretary of the Security Bureau, Sonny Au, said that the relevant amendments are \"very confident\" that they are in line with the Basic Law and have not expanded their powers. The Security Bureau stated that if all goes well, the tentative regulations will take effect on 1 August.\nCriminal convictions\nA 16-year-old boy participated in a riot at the junction of Nathan Road and Shantung Street in Mong Kok on 16 November 2019; used a scarf in an unlawful assembly; attempted to damage the road with fire at the junction of Shantung Street and Portland Street on the same day as he attempted to use fire to damage the road or property belonging to the Hong Kong; and to keep a wrench.

Hundreds of people queued in the rain for entering the courthouse before the proceedings until nighttime, defying police warnings of violating the national security law.\nSome media outlets applied to the court for lifting reporting strict restrictions on the bail proceedings which could only report the name of the court and the magistrate of the case, the date and place of the proceedings, the name of the defendants and their legal representation, the offence they were charged of and the result of a proceedings. The defence proposed a set of relaxed reporting rules, with Barrister David Ma saying that an open, fair and transparent trial was the \"cornerstone of the rule of law\", pointing out that freedom of speech and the press are respected under the national security law. A representative of Senior Counsel Hectar Pun argued that \"if the media cannot report on this open hearing, then it will undermine the principle of open justice.\" Chief Magistrate Victor So refused the plea on the grounds that the general public or the press may not be able to determine whether a statement made in court fell under the scope of \"legal argument,\" causing citizens to accidentally breach the restrictions, which would be \"a bit dangerous for them\".\nChief Magistrate Victor So initially granted bail to 15 of the 47 defendants at around 8 p.m., but the decision was immediately appealed by the Department of Justice. The 32 remaining defendants were denied bail on grounds that they would be likely to continue to commit acts endangering national security, meaning they would have to be remain in detention until the trial begins on 31 May. When the defendants left the court, the supporters who waited outside waved goodbye and thanked their lawyers.
