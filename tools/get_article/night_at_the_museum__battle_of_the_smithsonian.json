The film stars Ben Stiller, Amy Adams, Owen Wilson, Hank Azaria, Christopher Guest, Alain Chabat and Robin Williams. It is the second film in the Night at the Museum series, following Night at the Museum (2006).\nThe film was theatrically released on May 22, 2009, by 20th Century Fox. It received mixed reviews and became a box-office success, grossing $413 million on a $150 million budget. A third film, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, was released in 2014, and an animated sequel, Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again, was released in 2022.\nPlot\nThree years after the events of the first film, Larry Daley has left his job as night guard at the American Museum of Natural History to start a company selling his own inventions on direct response television. He visits the museum and learns that most of the exhibits are scheduled to be moved to the Smithsonian Institution archives in Washington, D.C. and replaced with holographic displays. Furthermore, the Tablet of Ahkmenrah will remain, leaving the departing exhibits without the ability to come to life at night.\nLarry receives a panicked phone call from miniature cowboy Jedediah, who explains that Dexter the monkey brought the tablet to the Smithsonian, where they are under attack by Ahkmenrah's older brother Kahmunrah. Determined to save them, Larry travels to Washington, D.C. and poses as a night guard to sneak into the archives, where he finds his friends trapped by Kahmunrah, who plans to use the tablet's powers to conquer the world.\nAided by Major General George A. Custer, who is captured, Larry is joined by Amelia Earhart. They evade Kahmunrah's soldiers inside the photograph of V-J Day in Times Square, leading Kahmunrah to enlist Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon Bonaparte and Al Capone to retrieve the tablet. Larry is captured, but when the tablet fails to open the Gate of the Underworld, Kahmunrah traps Jedediah in an hourglass and gives Larry one hour to decipher the tablet's combination.\nAmelia has fallen in love with Larry, and the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial mistakes them for a couple as they reach the National Air and Space Museum, where Larry has to stop all the rockets and aircraft from taking off. They encounter various figures from the history of flight, including the Wright brothers, a squadron of Tuskegee Airmen, and Able the space monkey, while a group of Albert Einstein bobbleheads explain that the combination is the value of pi. Napoleon, Ivan and Capone's troops arrive, prompting Larry and Amelia to escape in the Wright Flyer.\nThey crash into the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah uses the combination to open the gate and summon an army of Horus warriors. Miniature Roman general Octavius arrives with the statue of Lincoln, frightening the warriors back to the Underworld, and Amelia gathers an army of allies, including Larry's friends and Custer, leading to a climactic battle. Larry helps Custer overcome his fear of repeating the Battle of Little Big Horn, while Octavius rescues Jedediah, and Larry recovers the tablet and turns Capone, Bonaparte and Ivan against each other. Armed with his flashlight, Larry duels a khopesh-wielding Kahmunrah as Amelia reopens the gate, allowing Larry to banish Kahmunrah to the Underworld.\nAs she flies Larry and the New York exhibits home, Amelia reveals that she knows that she is only a wax figure of the real aviator. She and Larry share a kiss before she flies off to Canada, choosing to spend her final hours in the air rather than returning to the Smithsonian. Two months later, Larry has sold his company and made an anonymous donation to renovate the Natural History Museum and extend its nighttime visiting hours when the exhibits are alive; believed to be animatronics and hired reenactors, the exhibits are now able to interact with visitors at night. Back in his job as night guard, Larry meets a visitor named Tess who bears a striking resemblance to Amelia.\nCast\nHumans\n* Ben Stiller as Larry Daley, a night security guard and Amelia's love interest.\n* Ricky Gervais as Doctor McPhee, the curator at the Museum of Natural History and Larry's boss.\n* Jake Cherry as Nick Daley, the son of Larry Daley.\n* Mindy Kaling as a docent at the National Air and Space Museum.\n* George Foreman as himself.\n* Shawn Levy as an actor portraying a father in a Daley Devices infomercial.\n* Ed Helms (uncredited) as Larry's assistant.\n* Jonah Hill (uncredited) as Brandon (pronounced  ), a security guard at the Smithsonian.\nExhibits\n* Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt, a wax sculpture of the 26th President of the United States.\n** Williams additionally portrays a bronze bust of the president.\n* Mizuo Peck as Sacagawea, a polyurethane model of the Lemhi Shoshone woman who guided Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and Teddy's girlfriend.\n* Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart, a wax model of the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and Larry's love interest.\n** Adams additionally portrays Tess, a young woman at the end of the film who resembles Earhart.\n* Owen Wilson as Jedediah, a cowboy minifigure and Octavius' best friend.\n* Steve Coogan as Octavius, a Roman general minifigure and Jedediah's best friend.\n* Hank Azaria as Kahmunrah, a pharaoh who is Ahkmenrah's malevolent elder brother.\n** Azaria additionally provides the voices of The Thinker and the Lincoln Memorial's statue of Abraham Lincoln.\n* Rami Malek as Ahkmenrah, a mummy of a pharaoh who becomes a fully living human at night and is the benevolent younger brother of Kahmunrah.\n* Christopher Guest as Ivan the Terrible, the historic Tsar of Russia who allies with Kahmunrah.\n* Alain Chabat as Napoleon Bonaparte, the leader of the First French Empire who allies with Kahmunrah.\n* Jon Bernthal as Al Capone, a photographic standee of the gangster of the same name and founder of the Chicago Outfit who allies with Kahmunrah.\n* Bill Hader as George Armstrong Custer, a military commander whom Larry befriends.\n* Patrick Gallagher as Attila the Hun, a wax model of the leader of the Huns.\n* Brad Garrett as the voice of the Museum of Natural History's Easter Island Head.\n* Kerry van der Griend, Matthew Harisson and Rick Dobran as wax models of Neanderthals.\n* Randy Lee, Darryl Quon, Gerald Wong and Paul Chih-Ping Cheng as Atilla's fellow Huns.\n* Jonas Brothers as the Cherubs.\n* Jay Baruchel as Joey Motorola, a sailor who resides in the V-J Day in Times Square photograph.\n* Alberta Mayne as Greta Zimmer Friedman.\n* Eugene Levy as a group of Albert Einstein bobbleheads.\n* Keith Powell and Craig Robinson as the Tuskegee Airman.\n* Clint Howard and Matty Finochio as a pair of flight controllers at the National Air and Space Museum.\n* Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant as Orville and Wilbur Wright, respectively.\n* Caroll Spinney as Oscar the Grouch, a major character from the Sesame Street franchise who tries to ally with Kahmunrah but is dismissed because the ruler judges him to be \"vaguely grouchy\".\n* Thomas Morley as Darth Vader, a major character from the Star Wars franchise who tries to ally with Kahmunrah but is turned away because the ruler judges him as \"evil, asthmatic\" and \"a robot\".\n* Crystal the Monkey as Dexter and Able, a pair of mischievous stuffed capuchin monkeys.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nWriters Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon confirmed to Dark Horizons that they were writing a sequel to Night at the Museum, originally with the tentative title Another Night at the Museum.
