Ships in the inactive category include only ships in the inactive reserve, ships which have been disposed from US service have no listed status. Ships in the precommissioning category include ships under construction or on order.\nHistorical overview\nMine warfare consists of: minelaying, the deployment of explosive naval mines at sea to sink enemy ships or to prevent their access to particular areas; minesweeping, the removal or detonation of naval mines; and degaussing, the process of decreasing or eliminating a remnant magnetic field in a ship's hull to prevent its detection by magnetic mines. The US Navy has operated ships and craft for all three purposes. Mine planting is the laying and maintenance of controlled mines for harbor defense, which was traditionally a role of the US Army.\nClassifications\nMine warfare ships were originally considered by the US Navy to be either auxiliaries or yard and district craft, and so were given hull classification symbols beginning with either 'A' or 'Y', depending on their capabilities. The exceptions were four converted cargo ships with ID numbers (prior to the modern hull system), certain large 'cruiser' minelayers which were given hull symbols beginning with 'CM', converted destroyers which were given hull symbols beginning with 'DM', and three unclassified civilian cargo ships after World War II.\nOn 7 February 1955 all of these ships and craft still in service or reserve were reclassed and received new hull symbols beginning with 'M', usually without change of hull number. The exception was the degaussing ships, which retained the 'A' hull symbol.\nModern Littoral Combat Ships use 'L' hull symbols even though they can be used for mine warfare.\nAuxiliary minelayers (ACM)\nAll ACMs except USS Buttress and USS Monadnock were originally US Army mine planters.\nChimo class\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* , later ARC-5\nPCE-842 class\n* , ex-PCE-878\nCamanche

There ships were not Navy ships and were to be disposed and therefore were not assigned Navy hull classifications. Reportedly no active mines were found.\n* SS Pratt Victory\n* SS Joseph Holt\n* SS Marathon\nSee also\n* Commander Mine Squadron SEVEN\n* List of current ships of the United States Navy\n* List of United States Navy ships\n*  - abbreviated list\n*  - detailed list\n*\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\nMuseum ships\n* USS Hazard (AM-240) - Freedom Park, Omaha, NE\n* [https://stocktonhistoricalmaritimemuseum.org/ USS Lucid (AM-458)] - Stockton Maritime Museum, Stockton, CA\n* [https://www.museumschip-mercuur.nl/ MSO-483] - Stichting Maritiem Erfgoed Vlissingen, Netherlands"
