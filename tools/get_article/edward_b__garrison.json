He compiled a large collection of photographs to illustrate his books, which he donated to the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.\nPersonal life and education\nEdward Garrison was born in Chicago in 1900 and died in London on 16 October 1981.\nHe began his career in business, but changed direction in 1945 when he studied for an MA at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York.\nCareer\nGarrison spent much of his life as an art historian in Italy, travelling extensively. He worked as an independent researcher, publishing an important series of books on medieval Italian paintings. In 1949 he published \"Italian Romanesque Panel Painting: An Illustrated Index\", which is still used in the study of medieval Italian painting. Between 1953 and 1962 he published a series of four books Studies in the History of Mediaeval Italian Painting. This series included, for the first time, photographs of all twelfth century miniatures from the Papal States and Tuscany, as well as photographs of decorated manuscripts, wall paintings and panels.\nPhotographic archive\nGarrison collected a large photographic archive of medieval Italian art, which he donated to the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1962. It is known as the Garrison Collection and he became its honorary curator. The collection is an important source of material for medieval Italian art studies.\nThe collection is currently being digitised by the Courtauld Institute of Art as part of a larger digitisation project of the Conway Library.\nLegacy\nGarrison is considered to have made a \"fundamental contribution to the study of medieval Italian painting\".\nThe Garrison Collection at the Courtauld Institute of Art is an important source for the study of medieval Italian art.\nSee also\n* MS Ham. 78.A.5\nBibliography\n* Garrison, E.B., 1949.
