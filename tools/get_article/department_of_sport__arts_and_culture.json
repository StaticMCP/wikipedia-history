It was created in June 2019 by the merger of the Department of Arts and Culture with Sport and Recreation South Africa. As of 2024 the Sport, Arts and Culture Minister was Gayton McKenzie.\nDSAC and its predecessors provided more than  million for the maintenance of Liliesleaf Farm, a national heritage site of great significance to the history of the African National Congress and the liberation struggle against apartheid, from 2008 until 2021. At that time the museum was owned and run by the Liliesleaf Trust, headed by founder and CEO Nicolas Wolpe. After a dispute about funding, Mthethwa said that a process had begun towards declaring Liliesleaf Museum \"as a cultural institution in accordance with the Cultural Institutions Act\". This would enable Parliament to oversee the museum.\nSee also\n* Culture of South Africa\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
