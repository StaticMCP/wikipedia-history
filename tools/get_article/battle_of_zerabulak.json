It ended with the defeat of the Bukhara army, and the transition of the Bukhara Emirate to vassal dependence on the Russian Empire. Battle of Zerabulak is the first time that the Carle rifle was used in action.\nBattle\nAfter the capture of Samarkand in May 1868 by General Kaufman, in order to finally defeat the Bukharians, a campaign was undertaken in the direction of Bukhara.\nIn the meantime, it became known that a large Bukhara army was gathering at the Zerabulak heights, located about half the way from Samarkand to Bukhara. According to intelligence, there were about 30,000 people in it. Having received such news, General Kaufman, leaving a small garrison in Samarkand, decided to advance with the main forces to meet the enemy.\nOn the night of June 14, 1868, the Russian detachment approached the Zerabulak heights. At their feet stood the Bukhara infantry, behind it, on a hill — 14 guns and a mass of cavalry. The battle began at 4 am. Colonel Alexander Pistolkors, who commanded the vanguard, led his soldiers to attack the enemy's left flank. At the same time, the Cossacks moved, and the artillery began firing buckshot at the enemy infantry. The people of Bukhara, not expecting such pressure, wavered and ran. The Cossacks rushed in pursuit, but the Bukhara infantry, as soon as it emerged from the grapple fire, again lined up and began to retreat in an orderly manner, firing back and defending itself according to all the rules. Nevertheless, the entire hollow along which they retreated was covered with the bodies of Bukhara soldiers.\nOn the right flank, a battalion of 280 Russian infantrymen who had gone into hand-to-hand combat was unexpectedly surrounded by the Bukharians: enemy infantry was pressing in front, and cavalry came in from the rear. There was no way to help them, but, suddenly rushing into a bayonet attack, Russian soldiers overturned the enemy and got rid of the encirclement themselves, losing only 17 people wounded.\nThe entire Bukhara army gradually began to retreat, at first in order, and then — throwing weapons and ammunition. By 10 o'clock in the morning everything was over, the heights were cleared of the enemy. Among the trophies of General Kaufman's detachment was an artillery gun and 40 pack boxes with shells.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nGeneral references\n* [https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%AD/%D0%92%D0%A2/%D0%97%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4_1868_%D0%B3.
