For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n15 & 16 Vict.\nThe fifth session of the 15th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 3 February 1852 until 1 July 1852.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n| or the Inclosures Act 1852|public|2|20-04-1852|archived=n|An Act to authorize the Inclosure of certain Lands, in pursuance of the Seventh Annual and also of a Special Report of the Inclosure Commissioners for England and Wales.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to assimilate the Stamp Duties in Great Britain and Ireland, and to make Regulations for collecting and managing the same.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for Registering Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and to vest the Building appropriated for the Accommodation of the Supreme Courts of Justice in Edinburgh in the Commissioners of Works.}}\n|\n|\n| or the Industrial and Provident Societies Partnership Act 1852or '''Slaney's Act|public|31|30-06-1852|archived=n|repealed=y|An Act to legalize the Formation of Industrial and Provident Societies.|note4= }}\n|\n|  \"to facilitate Arrangements for the Relief of Turnpike Trusts, and to make certain Provisions respecting Exemptions from Tolls.\"}}\n|  to facilitate the Improvement of Landed Property in Ireland, and the Acts amending the same, to the Erection of Scutch Mills for Flax in Ireland.}}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Authority of Justices of the Peace to act in certain Matters relating to the Poor in Cities and Boroughs. }}\n|\n|\n|\n| |po1=Worthing|po1short=n|\n|po2=Worksop|po2short=n|\n|po3=Gainsborough|po3short=n|\n|po4=Rotherham and Kimberworth|po4short=n|\n|po5=Burnham|po5short=n|\n|po6=Calne|po6short=n|\n|po7=Banbury|po7short=n|}}\n|  and the Sixth of George the Third, Chapter Fifty-three.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Sunk Islands Roads Act 1852|public|45|30-06-1852|archived=n|An Act for making a Turnpike Road between Stone Creek and Sunk Island Church in the County of York, and between Sunk Island Church and Patrington Haven, and for consolidating with such Roads the present Turnpike Road from Sunk Island Church to Ottringham, and for constructing Quays and Wharfs at Stone Creek.}}\n|  for amending and consolidating the Laws relating to the Pay of the Royal Navy.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Turnpike Acts, Great Britain Act 1852|public|58|30-06-1852|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to continue certain Turnpike Acts in Great Britain.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for amending the Laws relating to Savings Banks in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to Friendly Societies.|note4= }}\n|  for the better Prevention of Crime and Outrage in certain Parts of Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  for facilitating the Sale and Transfer of Incumbered Estates in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Public Health Supplemental (No. 2) Act 1852|public|69|30-06-1852|archived=n|An Act to confirm certain Provisional Orders of the General Board of Health.|po1=Wisbeach|po1short=n|\n|po2=Walsoken|po2short=n|\n|po3=Salisbury|po3short=n|\n|po4=Ashby-de-la-Zouch|po4short=n|\n|po5=Woolwich|po5short=n|\n|po6=Stratford-upon-Avon|po6short=n|\n|po7=Leamington|po7short=n|\n|po8=Newbury|po8short=n|}}\n|  }}\n|  for the Embankment of a Portion of the River Thames.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Inclosures Act 1852'|public|79|30-06-1852|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to amend and further extend the Acts for the Inclosure, Exchange, and Improvement of Land.}}\n| or the Court of Chancery Act 1852|public|80|30-06-1852|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to abolish the Office of Master in Ordinary of the High Court of Chancery, and to make Provision for the more speedy and efficient Despatch of Business in the said Court.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Burials Act 1851or the Metropolitan Burial Act 1853|public|85|01-07-1852|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Laws concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis.}}\n|  }}\n| or the Court of Chancery Act 1852|public|87|01-07-1852|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for the Relief of the Suitors of the High Court of Chancery.|note4= }}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to \"The Mansfield Gaslight Company,\" and for conferring upon the Company further and additional Powers;
