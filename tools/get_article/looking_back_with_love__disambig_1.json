Produced by Curt Boettcher, the album includes a mix of covers and originals.\nSongs\nThe lyrics to the title track were written by Love's manager, Dan Parker.\n\"On and On and On\" is a cover of an ABBA song which was itself influenced by the 1968 Beach Boys song \"Do It Again\".\nLove's cover of \"Be My Baby\" originates from July 1980 sessions produced by (and featuring keyboards by) his Beach Boys bandmate and cousin Brian Wilson. However, the released track features additional overdubs and production completed without Wilson, and Curt Boettcher receives the sole production credit.\nCritical reception\nThe Rolling Stone Album Guide called the album \"notable only for its title track: an egregious 'salute' to those crazy ol' '60s that would probably make a dandy Republican campaign jingle.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
