It ceased to exist from 1816 to 1833, during which time it was split into two separate colonies (Antigua–Barbuda–Montserrat and Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla–Virgin Islands). It was dissolved in 1958 after the separation of the British Virgin Islands, and the remaining islands became parts of the West Indies Federation.\nHistory\nThe Leeward Islands was established as an English colony in 1671. In 1816, the islands were divided in two regions: Antigua, Barbuda, and Montserrat in one colony, and Saint Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands in the other.\nThe Leeward Islands were united again as a semi-federal entity in 1833, coming together until 1872 under the administration of the Governor of Antigua. The islands then became known as the Federal Colony of the Leeward Islands from 1872 to 1956. From 1833 to 1940, Dominica was part of the colony; in 1940, it was transferred to the British Windward Islands group.\nOn 3 January 1958, all islands except the Virgin Islands were absorbed into the West Indies Federation. The British Leeward Islands finally ceased to exist with the abolition of the office of its governor, and the elevation of the British Virgin Islands to the status of a separate crown colony, in 1960.\nA representative Leeward Islands cricket team continues to participate in West Indian domestic cricket.\nArmed forces structure in 1939\nThe armed forces of the colony included structures from Saint Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Dominica, and British Virgin Islands.\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis Defence Force\n* Royal Montserrat Defence Force\n* Royal Antigua Defense Force\n* Dominica Defense Force\nPostage stamps\nThe islands of the Leeward Islands all used postage stamps inscribed \"LEEWARD ISLANDS\" between 1890 and 1 July 1956, often concurrently with stamps inscribed with the colony's name. The islands also issued revenue stamps between 1882 and the 1930s.\nSee also\n*List of governors of the Leeward Islands\n*Attorney General of the Leeward Islands\n*Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands\n*British Windward Islands\n*History of the British West Indies\nReferences\nSources and further reading\n*\n* Dator, James. \"Frank Travels: Space, Power and Slave Mobility in the British Leeward Islands, c. 1700–1730.\" Slavery & Abolition 36.2 (2015): 335-359.
