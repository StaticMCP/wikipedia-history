The Queenslander was launched by the Brisbane Newspaper Company in 1866, and discontinued in 1939.\nHistory\nThe Queenslander was first published on 3 February 1866 in Brisbane by Thomas Blacket Stephens. The last edition was printed on 22 February 1939.\nIn a country the size of Australia, a daily newspaper of some prominence could only reach the bush and outlying districts if it also published a weekly edition. Yet The Queenslander, under the managing editorship of Gresley Lukin—managing editor from November 1873 until December 1880—also came to find additional use as a literary magazine.\nAngus Mackay, later a politician, was its first editor.\nIn September 1919, a series of aerial photographs of Brisbane and its surrounding suburbs were published under the title, Brisbane By Air. The photographs were taken by the newspaper's photographer, Frederick William Thiel and were promoted as the first photographs taken of Brisbane from an aeroplane.\nThe paper has been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Project by the National Library of Australia.\nSee also\n* Carl Feilberg, who campaigned for Indigenous rights in the paper\n* List of newspapers in Australia\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/discover/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/discover-queenslander#/mosaic Discover The Queenslander]"
