The award was created in 1989.\nSince 1989, the North Carolina Heritage Award has honored North Carolina's most eminent folk artists. Recipients of the Heritage Awards range from internationally acclaimed musicians to folks who quietly practice their art in rural and family settings. A dozen North Carolinians have gone on to receive the National Heritage Fellowship Awards presented by the National Endowment for the Arts. These awards deepen our awareness of the rich and diverse cultural traditions of people in North Carolina. The Heritage Award has become one of the most important and influential programs developed by the Folklife Program of the North Carolina Arts Council.\nRecipients receive a cash award and are honored in a ceremony that highlights their achievements. The Award ceremonies are a notable celebration and educational event for North Carolinians, drawing large and enthusiastic audiences.\nFrom the Award’s beginning, the Folklife Program of the North Carolina Arts Council engaged talented photographers&nbsp;— Rob Amberg, Cedric N. Chatterley, Mary Anne McDonald, Roger Haile and Bill Bamberger&nbsp;— to document the artistry of award recipients. Their images and the program book articles celebrate and commemorate the skills, values, aesthetics, and meaning of traditional arts in North Carolina.\nThe Folk Heritage Award recipients from 1989–1996 are also featured in a special issue of the North Carolina Folklore Journal.\nRecipients\n1989\n*Dorothy Auman and Walter Auman, potters (Randolph County, NC)\n*Etta Baker (1913–2006), Piedmont blues guitarist and singer (Burke County, NC)\n*Thomas Burt (1900-1990), Piedmont blues guitarist, banjoist, and singer (Durham County, NC)\n*Thomas Hunter (1919-1993), fiddler (Madison County, NC)\n*Emma Taylor (1920-2002), basketmaker (Qualla Boundary)\n*Doug Wallin (1919-2000), ballad singer (Madison County, NC)\n*Eva Wolfe (1922-2004), Cherokee basketmaker (Qualla Boundary)\n1990\n*The Badgett Sisters, gospel singers (Caswell County, NC)\n*Walker Calhoun (1918-2012), Cherokee musician and dancer (Qualla Boundary)\n*Earnest East (1916-2000), fiddler (Surry County, NC)\n*Benton Flippen (b. 1920), fiddler (Surry County, NC)\n*Wilma McNabb (d. 1991), weaver  (Cherokee County, NC)\n*Dellie Norton (1898-1993), ballad singer (Madison County, NC)\n*Sallie Parnell (1887-1994), rag-rug weaver (Davidson County, NC)\n1991\n*Effie Rhodes Bell, quilter (Pender County, NC)\n*Lela Brooks, Tobacco twine crocheter (Robeson County, NC)\n*Burlon Craig (1914-2002), potter in the style of Catawba Valley Pottery (Lincoln County, NC)\n*Menhaden Chanteymen, performers of worksongs  (Carteret County, NC)\n*Hazel Rhodes Reece (1925-2015), quilter (Onslow County, NC)\n*Quay Smathers (1913-1997), shape note singer and teacher (Haywood County, NC)\n*Thurman Strickland, basketmaker (Johnston County, NC)\n*Joe Thompson (musician) (1918-2012), fiddler (Alamance County, NC)\n*Odell Thompson, fiddler (Alamance County, NC)\n1992\n*Obadiah Carter (1925-1994), R & B musician\n*Bertie Dickens (1902-1994), old-time banjo player  (Alleghany County, NC)\n*Emma Dupree (1897-1996), herbalist and healer  (Pitt County, NC)\n*The \"5\" Royales, R & B musicians (Forsyth County, NC)\n*Leonard Glenn (1910-1997), banjo and dulcimer maker (Watauga County, NC)\n*Ray Hicks (1922-2003), storyteller (Watauga County, NC)\n*Algia Mae Hinton (1929-2018), blues guitarist and buck dancer (Johnston County, NC)\n*Lauchlin Shaw (1912-2000), fiddler (Harnett County, NC)\n*A.
