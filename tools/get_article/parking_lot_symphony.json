It also reached number 73 on the Swiss Hitparade, number 103 in the Netherlands, number 140 in France, and number-one on the Official Jazz & Blues Albums chart in the UK.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = All About Jazz\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = AllMusic\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = PopMatters\n| rev3score = 6/10\n| rev4 = Record Collector\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Slant\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = The Arts Desk\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = The Guardian\n| rev7score =\n}}\nParking Lot Symphony was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70 based on five reviews.\nAllMusic's Matt Collar praised the album, calling it \"one of Trombone Shorty's most balanced productions, equal parts New Orleans R&B sophistication and loose, block party fun\". Josh Hurst of Slant wrote: \"if there's a weakness here, it's that Shorty's lyrics feel like placeholders. ... The same could certainly not be said of the music, which is as rich and as complex as any he's made\".\nIn mixed reviews, Will Layman of PopMatters described the album as \"fine document of Shorty's blend of New Orleans funk, modernized brass band fire, and old school soul. Four albums into the journey, though, the formula has been varied, repeated, and--perhaps--exhausted\". Charles Waring of Record Collector complemented the artist's \"allusive, crossover style is a piquant marinade that blends Crescent City jazz with blues, pop, funk, R&B, hip-hop, and rock flavours\". John Lewis of The Guardian stated: \"the venerable label throwing everything at him in the hope that something sticks. But the horny retro soul of \"No Good Time\" and \"It Ain't No Use\" sound antiseptic when they should be down and dirty; the R&B; slugging on \"Familiar\" falls a little flat; while a version of \"Here Come the Girls\" works only because it's a note-for-note copy of the Allen Toussaint/Ernie K-Doe original\".\nTrack listing\n| length2       = 4:33\n| title3        = Parking Lot Symphony\n| writer3       =\n| length3       = 3:47\n| title4        = Dirty Water\n| writer4       =\n| length4       = 3:47\n| title5        = Here Come the Girls\n| writer5       = Allen Toussaint\n| length5       = 4:00\n| title6        = Tripped Out Slim\n| writer6       = Andrews\n| length6       = 2:19\n| title7        = Familiar\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 3:19\n| title8        = No Good Time\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 4:10\n| title9        = Where It At?\n| writer9       =\n| length9       = 3:26\n| title10       = Fanfare\n| writer10      =\n| length10      = 3:12\n| title11       = Like a Dog\n| writer11      =\n| length11      = 3:17\n| title12       = Laveau Dirge Finale\n| writer12      =\n| length12      = 4:44\n| total_length  = 42:43\n}}\nPersonnel\n*Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews – vocals (tracks: 2-5, 7, 9), Wurlitzer electric piano (tracks: 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11), Rhodes electric piano (tracks: 3-5, 7), guitar & tuba (track 6), Hammond B3 organ (tracks: 7-10), piano (tracks: 7, 9), drums (tracks: 8, 9), snare (tracks: 9, 10, 12), percussion (track 10), tom tom (track 11), glockenspiel & vibraphone (track 12), trombone, trumpet, arrangement\n*Dan Oestreicher – baritone saxophone\n*BK Jackson – tenor saxophone\n*Pete Murano – electric guitar (tracks: 2-12)\n*Tony Hall – bass guitar (tracks: 2-12)\n*Joey Peebles – drums (tracks: 2-12)\n*Tracci Lee – choir (tracks: 2, 3, 8, 9, 12)\n*Ashley Watson – choir (tracks: 3, 8, 9, 12)\n*Chrishira Perrier – choir (tracks: 3, 8, 9, 12)\n*Lonel Simmons – choir (tracks: 3, 8, 9, 12)\n*Raion Ramsey – choir (tracks: 3, 8, 9, 12)\n*Remonda Davis – choir (tracks: 3, 8, 9, 12)\n*Ashley Doucett – choir (track 2)\n*Faith Mack – choir (track 2)\n*India Favorite – choir (track 2)\n*Sabrina Hayes – choir (track 2)\n*Chris Seefried – mellotron (tracks: 2, 3, 5, 8), sitar & glockenspiel (track 2), electric sitar & piano (track 8), producer, arrangement\n*Leo Nocentelli – acoustic guitar (track 2)\n*Ramon Yslas – congas (track 2), tambourine (tracks: 2, 5)\n*Paul Cartwright – violin & viola (track 3)\n*Ivan Neville – piano (track 5)\n*Juan Pablo Covarrubias – synthesizer (track 7)\n*Glenn Hall – Wurlitzer electric piano (track 12)\n*Seth Atkins Horan – engineering, mixing\n*Bernie Grundman – mastering\n*Paul Moore – design\n*Mathieu Bitton – photography\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017–18)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard)\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Contemporary Jazz Albums (Billboard)\n| 1\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Chart (2018)\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Contemporary Jazz Albums (Billboard)\n| 15\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
