The builder was William Bishop of King's Heath.\nThe sanctuary and side chapels were built between 1925 and 1926 in a design created by George Bernard Cox, of Harrison and Cox, and the builders were John Bowen and Sons of Balsall Heath.\nThe western end of the church was completed in 1936.\nReferences"
