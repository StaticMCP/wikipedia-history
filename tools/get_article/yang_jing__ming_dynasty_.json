At this time, Zhu Yuanzhang had emerged as a leading commander of the Red Turban Rebellion, a movement directed against the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty that sought to restore Han Chinese rule after nearly a century of foreign domination. Following the conquest of Changzhou, he was appointed Vice Commander of the Guards (). He subsequently campaigned in Wuzhou and other regions, and his merits led to his promotion as Assistant Administrator of Huguang Province (), with his headquarters at Jiangling. Later, he commanded the offensive against Hunan and was further elevated to the position of Manager of Governmental Affairs of the province (). In 1367, he joined Zhou Dexing () and Zhang Bin () in an expedition against Guangxi, and the next year, he captured Yongzhou and Jingjiang, pacifying the province. He thereafter participated in the campaigns of Tang He and Xu Da against Shanxi. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed himself emperor and established the Ming dynasty. Two years later, in recognition of his achievements, Yang was created Marquis of Yingyang (), and dispatched to Sichuan to persuade the rulers of the Xia state to surrender, though the mission was unsuccessful. Yang Jing died in 1382 and was posthumously honored as Duke of Rui (), with the posthumous title Wuxin ().\nYang Jing had two sons. His eldest, Yang Tong (), inherited his father’s title. In 1387, he was ordered to lead surrendered Mongol troops to garrison Yunnan; however, many deserted en route, and he was consequently demoted to Commander of Puding Garrison. The second son, Yang Da (), held a minor official post.\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*  |orig-year=1739}}"
