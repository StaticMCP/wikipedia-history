The album begins with the bass monster of Apparat's - \"Not A Number\", with the keyboards tones like those from The Doors that blend in with the atmosphere of the keyboard synth from Fairmont & Dusty Kid's \"Cowboys\". Later Wally López's is included with Patric La Funk’s remix which standsout with hazy tech edges with a solid beat. Seaman changes his style into more tech, with the likes of Gui Boratto, Stel and Christian Fischer making the sound more minimal house. Skylark’s track \"Elevator\" combines progressive house with disco, tech house and tribal.\nThe entrance of disc two with Johannes Heil's \"The Coming\" is a piece including tribal drumbeats compounding slowly, followed by synth-and-bass lines of Tim Deluxe's \"You Got Tha Touch (Martin Buttrich Vox Mix)\" with smooth beats interlaced and funked-up vocals which rise to high pitch sounds increasing and later fading melodically. Later he mixes Mugwump with \"Memory Lane Refund (Acid Retraxion Mix)\" with tech funk and later ranging to sounds from Solumun's moody song \"Deadman\", Sol & Grimm's \"Exuma\" and Josh Gabriel's recent track \"Azora\" which will be featured in his first solo album since the separation of Gabriel & Dresden in 2008. Seaman also includes three works from Popof, his collaboration with Nina on \"Blablabla\", his track \"Brain On The Side\" and a remix of Solaris Heights' \"No Trace\".\nSeaman's mash-up of Oliver Huntemann's \"Bakery\" with Meat Katie & D. Rameriz's \"Stop The Revolution (Dubfire Mix)\" changed the style of the compilation into more epic sci-fi deep leading progressive sounds similar to those from Nubreed 001.\nThe compilation finishes with Umek's \"Faithfull Nights\" track which sounds like techno-trance from the late 90s.\nReferences"
