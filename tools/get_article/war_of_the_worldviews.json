The science worldview is represented by Mlodinow and the spirituality worldview is represented by Chopra. Each presents his side which is followed by the other person's rebuttal.\nOverall\nMlodinow suggests that \"the universe operates according to laws of physics while acknowledging that science does not address why the laws exist or how they arise\". Chopra says that \"the laws of nature as well as mathematics share the same source as human consciousness\".\nSee also\n*The Tao of Physics\nReferences"
