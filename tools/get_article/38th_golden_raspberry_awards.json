Razzies co-founder John J. B. Wilson has stated that the intent of the awards is \"to be funny.\" The nominees were announced on January 22, 2018, and the winners were announced on March 3, 2018.\nWith its nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screen Combo, and Worst Screenplay, The Emoji Movie became the first full-length animated motion picture to receive nominations for those specific categories at the Golden Raspberry Awards and to win all of these awards. A new award was also created, sponsored by Rotten Tomatoes, for \"The Razzie Nominee So Rotten You Loved It\", where the website readers voted for their favorite film which they thought was unfairly nominated, which was won by Baywatch. One of the film's stars, Dwayne Johnson, accepted the prize, albeit not in person. He did post a video online saying: \"We made Baywatch with the best of intentions, it didn't work out like that, but I humbly and graciously accept my Razzie. And I thank you, critics, and I thank you, fans.\"\nWith 10 nominations and no wins, Transformers: The Last Knight breaks the record for most nominations without a win, beating original record holder Grown Ups 2.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Actor winner]]\n, Worst Actress winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*'The Emoji Movie (Columbia)&nbsp;– Michelle Raimo Kouyate'\n**Baywatch (Paramount)&nbsp;– Michael Berk, Gregory J.

The ballot was also criticized for overlooking Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne's critically panned performances in Luc Besson's film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, despite the pre-nominations for Worst Picture and Besson for Worst Director, neither of both ended in the final ballot.\nBox office performance of nominated films\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto; table-layout: fixed\"\n|-\n!
