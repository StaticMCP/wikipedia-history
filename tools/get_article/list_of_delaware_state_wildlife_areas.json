      "text": "# List of Delaware state wildlife areas\n\nThe U.S. state of Delaware has 20 wildlife and conservation areas, as of 2015. Each of the wildlife areas is operated and maintained by the Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation, a branch of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).\nThe state wildlife system includes over 56,000 acres of public land set aside to conserve Delaware's fish and wildlife populations. Unlike Delaware's state parks, which are geared to more general outdoor recreation, the wildlife and conservation areas are managed primarily for recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, and birding, similar to the National Wildlife Refuges operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nState wildlife & conservation areas\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n! style=\"width:*;\" scope=\"col\"| Area Name\n! style=\"width:*;\" scope=\"col\"| County\n! style=\"width:*;\" scope=\"col\"| Date founded\n! style=\"width:*;\" scope=\"col\"| Size\n! style=\"width:*;\" class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\"| Description\n|-\n|C&D Canal Conservation Area\n|New Castle\n|\n||acre|adj=on}}\n|Preserves land along both sides of the C&D Canal, which connects the Delaware Bay to the Chesapeake Bay.\n|-\n|Augustine Wildlife Area\n|New Castle\n|\n||acre|adj=on}}\n|Preserves land along the Delaware Bay and the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal.\n|-\n|Cedar Swamp Wildlife Area\n|New Castle\n|\n||acre|adj=on}}\n|Preserves land along the Delaware Bay.\n|-\n|Eagles Nest Wildlife Area\n|New Castle\n|\n||acre|adj=on}}\n|Woods and wetlands near Blackbird State Forest.\n|-\n|DNERR Blackbird Creek Reserve\n|New Castle\n|\n|583-acre\n(236 ha)\n|Preserves uplands and marsh in Townsend, Delaware.\n|-\n|Woodland Beach Wildlife Area\n|Kent\n|\n||acre|adj=on}}\n|Preserves a stretch of wetland along the Delaware Bay.\n|-\n|Blackiston Wildlife Area\n|Kent\n|\n||acre|adj=on}}\n|\n|-\n|Little Creek Wildlife Area\n|Kent\n|1957\n||acre|adj=on}}\n|Preserves a stretch of wetland along the Delaware Bay.\n|-\n|Ted Harvey Conservation Area\n|Kent\n|1979\n|\n|Preserves land along the Delaware Bay and the St. Jones River.
