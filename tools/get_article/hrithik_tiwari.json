In the game, Hrithik went on to keep a clean sheet in an eventual 3–0 win for the Gaurs. Hrithik kept his place in the team, remaining first-choice goalkeeper even after Lara Sharma returned to full fitness.\nOn February 6, 2025, Hrithik saved a penalty from Diego Mauricio, as Goa went on to beat Odisha FC 2–1 at home.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|AFC\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |FC Goa\n|2020–21\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Indian Super League\n|0||0||1||0|| colspan=\"2\" |–||1||0\n|-\n|2021–22\n|1||0||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |–||0||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|0||0||4||0|| colspan=\"2\" |–||4||0\n|-\n|2023–24\n|0||0||1||0|| colspan=\"2\" |–||1||0\n|-\n|2024–25\n|16||0||3||0|| colspan=\"2\" |–||19||0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!17!!0!!9!!0!!0!!0!!25!!0\n|}\nReferences"
