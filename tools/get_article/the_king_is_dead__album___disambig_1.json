Described as the \"most pastoral, rustic record they've ever made\" by Douglas Wolk of Rolling Stone, the album reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart for the week ending February 5, 2011. The song \"This Is Why We Fight\" reached number 19 on the U.S. Alternative Songs Chart, while the song \"Down by the Water\" also charted in the United States. In November 2011, the band released an EP of album out-takes, entitled Long Live the King.\nPrior to the album's release, frontman Colin Meloy stated: \"If there's anything academic about this record, or me trying to force myself in a direction, it was realising that the last three records were really influenced by the British folk revival [...] this whole world that I was discovering, that I was poring over, learning inside-out. It was a wanting to get away from that. And looking back into more American traditions, reconnecting with more American music.\"\nBackground\nThe King Is Dead was recorded during spring 2010, with most of it being made in a six-week period in a barn at an  site called Pendarvis Farm, near Portland, Oregon. It has been speculated that the album title is an homage to The Smiths' 1986 album The Queen Is Dead, largely due to Colin Meloy's long-touted influence from the band. It was co-produced by Tucker Martine. “The Calamity Song”  premiered in a live performance on August 6, 2009, at the Cabaret Metro in Chicago.  At least three of the ten songs—\"Down by the Water\", \"Rise to Me\" and \"June Hymn\"—were performed live in 2010. Meloy has said that a primary musical influence for much of The King Is Dead is R.E.M., and three songs, \"Don't Carry It All\", \"Calamity Song\" and \"Down by the Water\", feature the R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck. The album was released on January 18, 2011. The King Is Dead has been called the \"most pastoral, rustic record they've ever made\" by Douglas Wolk of Rolling Stone. On January 26, 2011, it became their first No. 1 album on the U.S. album chart.\nOn November 1, 2011, the outtakes EP Long Live the King was released, collecting six songs recorded during these sessions.\nRelease and reception\n| MC = 77/100\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = The A.V.
