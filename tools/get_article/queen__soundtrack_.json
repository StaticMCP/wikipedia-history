Amit Trivedi is unusual and is known to create his own norm by refusing to fall into any random moulds of stereotypical understanding. Once again after last year's poetry in music, Trivedi has evolved another album that matches the marvel expected of him. Giving us amusing, delightful, enthralling composition Trivedi's memorable music from Queen wins my heart. I am going with a 4/5 and wishes that Trivedi is more frequent in the commercial music scenario\".\nCharts\nTwo songs, Jugni and Kinare from the soundtrack debuted at number 10 and eight at Planet Bollywood Top 10 chart.
