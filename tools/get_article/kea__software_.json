Kea and ISC DHCP are both implementations of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), a set of standards established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to automatically assign IP addresses. Kea software is distributed in source code form on GitHub, from various ISC sites, and through a number of operating system packages. Kea is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.\nThe Kea distribution includes a DHCPv4 server, a DHCPv6 server, and a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) server. Significant features include: support for IPv6 prefix delegation, host reservations (which may be optionally stored in a separate back end database), Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot, client classification, shared networks, and high-availability (failover pairs). Kea can store leases locally in a memfile, or in a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. Kea has a supported API for writing optional extensions, using 'hooks'.\nThe release of Kea 3.0.0 in June 2025 marked the first Long-Term Support version of the Kea DHCP software, meant to be supported for three years.\nKea has a graphical management application, called [https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork Stork], that integrates an agent running on the Kea server, an exporter to a Prometheus time-series data store, a Grafana template for data visualization, and the Stork web dashboard. Like Kea, Stork is licensed under the MPL 2.0 license. The Stork dashboard provides a simple graphical display for managing one or many Kea servers. Current features include server status, pool utilization, high-availability status, host reservations, and leases per second. Via the integration with Grafana it also provides detailed statistics on DHCP messages over time. Stork was first released in 2014, and features are being added rapidly in monthly releases.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea Project repository and issue tracker]\n* [https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork Project repository and issue tracker for Stork management dashboard].\n* [https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Kea documentation on ReadTheDocs]\n* [https://stork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Stork documentation on ReadTheDocs]\n* [https://cloudsmith.io/~isc/repos/ ISC Kea packages]"
