It is one of three churches located within 600m along Clergy Street (the others are Chalmers United Church, and St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church). It is one of two cathedrals in Kingston, the other being the Anglican St. George's Cathedral on King Street.\nHistory\nDesigned by architect James R. Bowes, construction began in 1842. The cathedral was officially opened October 4, 1848. It was greatly enlarged in 1889 with a design by Joseph Connolly.\nThe spire rises to a height of 242 feet, and this is believed to be the tallest structure in the entire city of Kingston.\nRenovations\nExtensive structural renovations were performed between 1987 and 1995, including rebuilding much of the north wall and replacing the 50-year-old asbestos roof (itself a replacement of the original tin roof) with slate tiles. The renovations cost approximately $7,000,000.\nStained Glass Windows\nSt Mary's Cathedral did not have any stained glass windows until 1885, when they were commissioned as part of the renovations Archbishop James Vincent Cleary was leading.\nEvents and Anniversaries\nThe Cathedral has been the location for a number of consecrations for Bishops and Archbishops over the years.\nSt Mary's Cathedral celebrated its 125th anniversary in 1973.\nFor the 175th anniversary in 2023, St Mary's held a special Lessons and Carols service. As well, the parish published two books about its stained glass windows: a coloring book, and a coffee table book detailing the windows' history.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.stmaryscathedral.ca/ St. Mary's Cathedral (Kingston) official website]"
