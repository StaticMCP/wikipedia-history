It holds the responsibility for culture and sport, and some aspects of the media throughout the UK, such as broadcasting. Its main offices are at 100 Parliament Street, occupying part of the building known as Government Offices Great George Street.\nIt also has responsibility for the tourism, leisure and creative industries (some jointly with the Department for Business and Trade). The department was also responsible for the delivery of the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.\nFrom 2017 to 2023, the department had responsibility for the building of a digital economy and was known as the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The responsibilities for digital policy were transferred to the newly created Department for Science, Innovation and Technology in the February 2023 cabinet reshuffle.\nHistory and responsibilities\nDCMS originates from the Department of National Heritage (DNH), which itself was created on 11 April 1992 out of various other departments, soon after the Conservative election victory. The former ministers for the Arts and for Sport (both created in 1964) had previously been located in other departments.\nDNH was renamed as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on 14 July 1997, under the premiership of Tony Blair. It was renamed to Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on 3 July 2017, staying DCMS under the premiership of Theresa May to reflect the department's increased activity in the digital sector. The department was renamed back to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in February 2023, with responsibility for digital moving to the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.\n2012 Olympics\nDCMS was the co-ordinating department for the successful bid by London to host the 2012 Olympics and appointed and oversees the agencies delivering the Games' infrastructure and programme, principally the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and LOCOG.\nThe June 2007 Cabinet reshuffle led to Tessa Jowell MP taking on the role of Paymaster General and then Minister for the Cabinet Office while remaining Minister for the Olympics.  Ministerial responsibility for the Olympics was shared with Ms Jowell in the Cabinet Office, but the staff of the Government Olympic Executive (GOE) remained based in DCMS.\n2010–2022\nFollowing the 2010 general election, ministerial responsibility for the Olympics returned to the Secretary of State. Although Jeremy Hunt's full title was Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the department's name remained unchanged. On 4 September 2012, Hunt was appointed Health Secretary in a cabinet reshuffle and replaced by Maria Miller. Maria Miller later resigned due to controversy over her expenses. Her replacement was announced later that day as Sajid Javid.\nAfter the 2015 general election, John Whittingdale was appointed as Secretary of State, tasked with initiating the BBC Charter review process. DCMS received full responsibility for the digital economy policy, formerly jointly held with BIS, and sponsorship of the Information Commissioner's Office from the Ministry of Justice.\nWhittingdale was replaced by Karen Bradley after the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU in July 2016.  The Office for Civil Society moved from the Cabinet Office to DCMS as part of the same reshuffle.\nIn January 2018, Matt Hancock, previous Minister of State for Digital, was appointed Secretary of State as part of a Cabinet reshuffle. In the 9 July 2018 reshuffle, Jeremy Wright became the Secretary of State. Nicky Morgan became Secretary of State in July 2019; she stood down as an MP at the 2019 United Kingdom general election but was ennobled as Baroness Morgan of Cotes and retained her position from within the House of Lords. As part of the 13 February 2020 reshuffle, Oliver Dowden MP was appointed Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Nadine Dorries succeeded on 15 September 2021. In July 2022, Dorries personally granted Grade II-listed status to a plaque of Cecil Rhodes which she believed is of \"special historic interest\". This decision attracted controversy. On 5 September 2022, in anticipation of the appointment of Liz Truss as Prime Minister, Dorries tendered her resignation as culture secretary.\nPolicy areas\nIt is responsible for government policy in the following areas:\n* The arts\n* Broadcasting, including the BBC and Channel 4\n* Civil society\n* Charities\n* Creative industries\n** Advertising\n** Design\n** Fashion\n** Film\n** Music industry\n** Publishing\n* Historic environment\n* Architecture and design\n* Arts market\n* Cultural property and heritage\n* Entertainment licensing\n* Gambling and horse racing\n* Press freedom and regulation\n* Libraries\n* Museums and galleries\n* The National Lottery\n* Tourism\n* Sport\n* Olympic legacy\nOther responsibilities\nOther responsibilities of DCMS include listing of historic buildings, scheduling of ancient monuments, export licensing of cultural goods, and management of the Government Art Collection (GAC).\nThe Secretary of State has responsibility for the maintenance of the land and buildings making up the historic Royal Estate under the Crown Lands Act 1851.

The Secretary of State for Culture retains legal responsibility for these palaces, but from 1 April 2012 this funding was amalgamated with the Civil List into a single Sovereign Grant administered by HM Treasury.  DCMS continues to make a separate small grant to the Royal Household for the maintenance of Marlborough House\nThe department also has responsibility for state ceremonial occasions and royal funerals.  However, responsibility for the Civil List element of head-of-state expenditure and income from the separate Crown Estate remains with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nDCMS works jointly with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) on design issues, including sponsorship of the Design Council, and on relations with the computer games and publishing industries.\nDCMS works with [https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/temporary-storage-of-imports/tsi004100 local community system providers] in broadcasting service via TV and Internet channels.
