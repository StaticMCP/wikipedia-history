It was a victory of a Dutch squadron under Commodore Johan van Galen over an English squadron under Captain Henry Appleton. Afterwards, another English squadron under Captain Richard Badiley, which Appleton had been trying to join up with, reached the scene in time to observe the capture of the last ships of Appleton's squadron, but was outnumbered and forced to return to Porto Longone.\nBackground\nIn 1652 the government of the Commonwealth of England, mistakenly believing that the United Provinces after their defeat at the Battle of the Kentish Knock would desist from bringing out fleets so late in the season, split their fleet between the Mediterranean and home waters. This division of forces led to a defeat at the Battle of Dungeness in December 1652, and by early 1653 the situation in the Mediterranean was critical too. Appleton's squadron of six ships (including four hired merchantmen) was trapped in Leghorn by a blockading Dutch fleet of 16 ships, while Richard Badiley's of eight (also including four hired merchantmen) was at Elba.\nThe only hope for the English was to combine their forces, but Appleton sailed too soon and engaged with the Dutch before Badiley could come up to help. Three of his ships were captured and two destroyed and only one (Mary), sailing faster than the Dutch ships, escaped to join Badiley. Badiley engaged the Dutch, but was heavily outnumbered and retreated.\nThe battle gave the Dutch command of the Mediterranean, placing the English trade with the Levant at their mercy, but Van Galen was mortally wounded, dying on 13 March.\nOne of the Dutch captains at the battle was son of Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, Cornelis Tromp, who was to become a famous admiral himself and one of the most celebrated and controversial figures in Dutch naval history due to his actions in the Anglo-Dutch Wars and the Scanian War.\nShips involved\nUnited Provinces of the Netherlands\nJohan van Galen\n]]\n.]]\n*Vereenigde Provincien/Zeven Provincien (United Provinces/Seven Provinces) 40 (flag)\n*Eendracht (Concord) 40 (Jacob de Boer)\n*Maan (Moon) 40 (Cornelis Tromp)\n*Ter Goes 40 (Jan Richewijn)\n*Zon (Sun) 40 (Pieter van Zalingen)\n*Zutphen 36 (Jan Uijttenhout)\n*Maagd van Enkhuysen (Maiden of Enkhuysen) 34 (Jan Roetering)\n*Jonge Prins (Young Prince) 28 (Cornelis Barentszoon)\n*Julius Caesar 28 (hired merchantman) (Jacon Janszoon Roocher)\n*Witte Olifant (White Elephant) (hired Italian merchantman Elefante Bianco) 28 (Sijbrant Janszoon Mol)\n*Madonna della Vigna 28 (hired merchantman) (Harman Sonne) - Ran aground north of Livorno harbor, but salved\n*Susanna 28 (hired merchantman) (Daniel Janszoon de Vries)\n*Zwarte Arend (Black Eagle) 28 (Pieter Janszoon van Bontebotter)\n*Salomons Oordeel (Judgment of Soloman) 28 (hired merchantman) (Meijndert Theunissen van Oosterwout)\n*Roode Haes (Red Hare) 28 (hired merchantman) (Adriaan Rodenhaes)\n*Ster (Star) 28 (hired merchantman) (Hendrik Govertszoon)\nThe Eendracht and Jonge Prins were ships of the Noorderkwartier Admiralty, all the others (including the hired merchantmen) pertained to the Amsterdam Admiralty.\nCommonwealth of England\n'Capt.
