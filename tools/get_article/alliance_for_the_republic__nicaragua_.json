For the 2006 Autonomous elections on the Caribbean Coast APRE lost four of its allies; the Conservative Party (PC), the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement (MDN) and the Social Conservative Party (PSC) to the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) and the National Unity Movement (MUN) to the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS).\nAPRE didn't pull enough votes to win a seat in the Regional Council and shortly after the elections, the two remaining allies of APRE abandoned the alliance; the Nicaraguan Party of the Christian Path (CCN) went to support the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC) in the upcoming elections and the Party for Citizen Action (PAC) joined the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) alliance.\nAs of 2006, APRE is part of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN).\nControversy\nAPRE was created and backed up by the presidential offices as the official government party, the Constitutional Liberal Party (PLC), declared itself in opposition to the Bolaños government in February 2003. The party enjoyed the resources of incumbency until the end of President Bolaños’s term in January 2007 and is also backed by some of the country’s most affluent capitalists.[http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/2313/ Revista Envío - The Way Out of the Labyrinth Is Long, but Possible]\nBolaños became a member of the National Assembly after his presidency.\nSources"
