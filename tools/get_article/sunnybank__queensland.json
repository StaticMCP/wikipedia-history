The name came from a property called Sunny Brae Estate owned by the Gillespie family, Sunnybank got its name when  of land were taken over for the railway. Brae is Scottish for the English word bank, so the area was named Sunnybank. The Town of Sunnybank was surveyed in 1886, with 50 town and suburban land parcels offered for sale in 1887.
