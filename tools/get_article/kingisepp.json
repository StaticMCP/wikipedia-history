Population:\nHistory\nNovgorod Republic 1384–1478\nGrand Duchy of Moscow 1478–1547\nTsardom of Russia 1547–1583\n1583–1595\nTsardom of Russia 1595–1617\n1617–1721\nTsardom of Russia 1703–1721 (occupation)\n1721–1917\nRussian Republic 1917\nSoviet Russia 1917–1919\nWhite Movement 1919\nSoviet Russia 1919–1922\n1922–1991\n1941–1944 (occupation)\n1991–present\n}}\n14th century\nThe town was first documented in 1384, when the Novgorodians under Patrikas built there a fortress against the Swedes. It was called Yama or Yamsky Gorodok, after the Izhorian (ethnic Finnic group) name Jaama. The environs of the town are still cited as the main location of speakers of the nearly extinct Izhorian language. The citadel withstood sieges by the Swedes in 1395 and by the Teutonic Knights during the 1444–1448 war.\n15-16th century\nThe town became the most important economic center of the  of the Novgorod Republic. There were 201&nbsp;homesteads in the 15th century in the town; its total population can only be evaluated roughly based on the estimates of three to five persons per homestead. At the end of the Livonian War, it was ceded to Sweden, only to be returned twelve years later, in 1595.\n17th century\nFollowing the Treaty of Stolbovo, it again passed to the Swedes, who kept the name which in Swedish orthography became Jama or Jamo. The town was completely destroyed by Russian armies during the war of 1656–1658, after which only the citadel remained intact. The Swedes demolished the citadel in 1681. It is questionable whether the town, with its exclusively Russian population, ever recovered.\n18th century\nFirst held by the Russians for a month in late 1700, what was left of the citadel was finally taken by the Russians in the course of the Great Northern War in 1703. On May&nbsp;14, 1703, Yam was renamed Yamburg (a German version of the name). Five years later, Peter the Great granted the town to Alexander Menshikov in his capacity of the Duke of Izhora. In the course of the administrative reform, Yamburg was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1780, Catherine the Great re-approved with some changes a previously existing coat of arms. Uyezd town status was granted to it in 1784.\n20th century\nRussian Civil War\nVladimir Lenin reportedly stayed in Yamburg in January 1919, when he ordered the Bolshevik troops to retake the town of Narva from Estonian forces. In October 1919, the anti-Bolshevist commander, General Nikolai Yudenich captured Yamburg, which marked the beginning of the push by the Northwestern White Army towards Petrograd. However, the Bolsheviks subsequently re-captured Yamburg on November&nbsp;14, 1919. On November&nbsp;16, 1919, the forces of General Yudenich were \"crowded together in a small space near Yamburg\" \"in a serious state of disorganization\", reported The New York Times.\nThe German form of the town name was retained until 1922, when the Bolsheviks renamed it in honor of the exiled Estonian Communist leader Viktor Kingissepp.\nKingisepp–Gdov Offensive\nDuring World War II, Kingisepp was occupied by German troops from August&nbsp;16, 1941 until February&nbsp;1, 1944, when the 109th Rifle Corps captured the town, forcing the German 18th Army into new positions on the eastern bank of Narva.\nAdministrative changes\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, Yamburg was the seat of Yamburgsky Uyezd of St.&nbsp;Petersburg Governorate (later known as Petrograd and Leningrad Governorate). On May&nbsp;17, 1922, Yamburgsky Uyezd was renamed Kingiseppsky, simultaneously with the town.\nOn August&nbsp;1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Kingiseppsky District, with the administrative center in Kingisepp, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July&nbsp;23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between March&nbsp;22, 1935 and September&nbsp;19, 1940, Kingisepp was the administrative center of Kingisepp Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. After Kingisepp Okrug was abolished on September&nbsp;19, 1940, Kingisepp became a town of oblast significance on December&nbsp;17, 1940. In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with the municipal structure and Kingisepp became a town of district significance.\nGeography\nClimate\n}}\nAdministrative and municipal divisions\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Kingisepp serves as the administrative center of Kingiseppsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with the village of Porkhovo, incorporated within Kingiseppsky District as Kingiseppskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Kingiseppskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kingiseppsky Municipal District as Kingiseppskoye Urban Settlement.\nEconomy\nIndustry\nThe economy of Kingisepp is based on chemical, glass, and food industries. It is the location for the EuroChem Northwest ammonia plant which has the largest single-train production capacity in Europe, at 1 million tpy.\nTransportation\nThe railway connecting St.&nbsp;Petersburg with Tallinn passes through Kingisepp and has a railway station in it. There is infrequent suburban service to the Baltiysky railway station in St.&nbsp;Petersburg and to Ivangorod.\nThe A180 Highway, connecting St.&nbsp;Petersburg and Ivangorod, passes Kingisepp as well. It coincides with the European route E20 connecting St.&nbsp;Petersburg via Tallinn. Kingisepp is also connected by road with Volosovo and Slantsy.\nCulture\n]]\nKingisepp contains thirteen cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally seventeen objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments include the Yam Fortress, the  (by Antonio Rinaldi), and the complex of military barracks of the 19th century.\nKingisepp has a local history museum. It was open in 1960 and is located in the buildings of the St.&nbsp;Catherine Cathedral. In 1990, the cathedral was transferred to Russian Orthodox Church and the museum was closed until 1999, when it re-opened in the former building of the commercial school, an architecture monument.\nTwin towns – sister cities\nKingisepp is twinned with:\n* Bielsk Podlaski, Poland\n* Jõhvi, Estonia\n* Narvik, Norway\n* Pitsunda, Georgia\n* Raisio, Finland\n* Renhuai, China\n* Sassnitz, Germany\n* Svietlahorsk, Belarus\nNotable people\n*Aleksei Ionov (1989), association football player\n*Vera Karelina (1870–1931), labor activist and revolutionary\n*Aleksandr Kerzhakov (1982), association football player\n*Mikhail Kerzhakov (1987), association football player\n*Pavel Mogilevets (1993), association football player\n*Grigory Spiridonovich Petrov (1868–1925), politician\n*Ivan Shpakov (1986), association football player\n*Gustav Heinrich Johann Apollon Tammann (1861–1938), scientist\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://makewebmap.com/city.php?kod=2371698-ru Pictures of Kingisepp]"
