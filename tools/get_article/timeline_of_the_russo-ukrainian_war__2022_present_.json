The campaign had been preceded by a Russian military buildup since early 2021 and numerous Russian demands for security measures and legal prohibitions against Ukraine joining NATO.\nPrelude\nOn 10 November 2021, the United States reported an unusual movement of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders. On 7 December, US President Joe Biden warned President of Russia Vladimir Putin of \"strong economic and other measures\" if Russia attacks Ukraine. On 17 December 2021, Putin proposed a prohibition on Ukraine joining NATO, which Ukraine rejected.\nOn 17 January 2022, Russian troops began arriving in Russia's ally Belarus, ostensibly \"for military exercises\". On 24 January, NATO put troops on standby. On 25 January, Russian military exercises involving 6,000 troops and 60 jets take place in Russia near Ukraine and Crimea. On 10 February, Russia and Belarus began 10 days of military maneuvers. Fighting escalated in separatist regions of eastern Ukraine on the 17th. On 21 February, Vladimir Putin officially ordered Russian forces to enter the separatist republics in eastern Ukraine. He also announced Russian recognition of the two pro-Russian breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine (the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic).\nInitial invasion\nSoutheastern front\n2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\nSecond stalemate\n2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\nIn early June 2023, Ukraine launched a substantial counteroffensive against Russian forces occupying its territory with a long-term goal of breaching the frontlines.
