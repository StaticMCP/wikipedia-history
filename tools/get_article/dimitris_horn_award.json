The award, which bears the name of Dimitris Horn, an actor recognised as the best contemporary Greek theatre actor, was established in 2000 by Stamatis Fasoulis and Theodosis Isaakidis, with the financial support of Yannis Horn, the actor's brother.\nThe prize of the award is the  gold cross worn by the actor, which is passed from one awardee to another every year, accompanied by a cash prize of 3000 euro.\nCandidates must be graduates of a drama school or have performed professionally for the first time no more than five years before the theatre period for which they are honoured.\nThe award ceremony takes place every year at the \"Dimitris Horn Theatre\" (formerly \"Dionysia Theatre\"). The \"Committee of the Dimitris Horn Award\" is currently composed of: Stamatis Fassoulis (chairman),  Lydia Koniordou, theatrologist Irini Moudraki and the journalists Myrto Loverdou and Antigoni Karali as members.\nMembers of the committee have been the theatrologist Kostas Georgousopoulos (chairman), Eleni Chatziargyri and Xenia Kalogeropoulou.\nThe gradual reduction of the trust fund that financed the award led the Ministry of Culture to take over its funding. With a draft law prepared by the Ministry, which has not yet become state law, the award will become state-sponsored, and the five-member committee evaluating nominations will be appointed by decision of the Minister of Culture.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  font-size: 90%;\"\n! width=\"20%\" | Theater season\n! width=\"15%\" | Resipient\n! width=\"20%\" | Play\n! width=\"20%\" | Role\n!width=\"30%\"  |Production\n! width=\"20%\" |Refs / Notes\n|-\n|1999 - 2000\n|\n|The Illusion (play)\n|Matamore\n|Theatre Company \"Dolihos\"\n|\n|-\n|2000 - 2001\n|\n|The Turn of the Screw (play)\n|The Man\n|Neos Kosmos Theater\n|\n|-\n|2001 - 2002\n|Christos Loulis\n|Erotokritos\n|Erotokritos\n|DipetheK  (Μunicipal Regional Theater of Crete)\n|\n|-\n|2002- 2003\n|Kostas Vasardanis\n|Translations (play)\n|Manus\n| \"Aplo\" Theater\n|\n|-\n|2003 - 2004\n|Nikos Kardonis\n|\"The one that doesn't end: Greek poetry of the 20th century - Edition II\"\n|dramatized poems\n|Experimental stage of National Theater of Greece\n|\n|-\n|2004 - 2005\n|\n| \"Η κατασαρίδα\"  (transl. \"The cockroach\")\n| he performed 16 different roles\n|Neos Kosmos Theater\n|\n|-\n|2005 - 2006\n|\n|\"Το γάλα\"   (transl. \"The milk\")\n|Adonis\n|National Theater of Greece\n|\n|-\n|2006 - 2007\n|\n|\"Ήρωες\"  (transl. \"Heroes\")\n|Natalia Alexeievna Bratuska Simeonidis\n|Athens Theater Company\n|\n|-\n|2007 - 2008\n|Makis Papadimitriou\n|\"Motortown\"\n|Lee\n|Neos Kosmos Theater\n|\n|-\n|2008 - 2009\n|Mixalis Oikonomou\n|\"Masked (play)\n|Daoud\n|Neos Kosmos Theatre\n|\n|-\n|2009 - 2010\n|\n|Twelfth Night\n|Sir Andrew Aguecheek\n|\"Elliniki Theamaton\"\n|\n|-\n|2010 - 2011\n|Dimitris Lalos\n|La Chunga (play)\n|Hosefino\n|\"NAMA\" group\n|\n|-\n|2011 - 2012\n|Haris Fragoulis\n|When Nietzsche Wept (novel)\n|Sigmund Freud\n|\"Thiseion, a theatre for the Arts\"\n| adaptation from the novel\n|-\n|2012 - 2013\n|\n|Mistero Buffo\n|The fool\n|\"Thiseion, a theatre for the Arts\"\n|\n|-\n|2013 - 2014\n|\n|\"\" (transl. \"Flantro\")  Hippolytus (play)\n|Notis Serdaris  Messenger\n|\"National Theater of Greece\"\n|\n|-\n|2014 - 2015\n|\n|King Lear\n|the fool\n|Athens Epidaurus Festival\n|\n|-\n|2015 - 2016\n|\n| \"Το δέντρο του Οιδίποδα\"  (transl. \"The Oedipus Tree\")\n|Oedipus\n|\"Thiseion, a theatre for the Arts\"\n|\n|-\n|2016 - 2017\n|Yiannis Niarros\n|\"Στέλλα κοιμήσου\"  (transl. \"Sleep Stella\")\n|Giorgos Gerakaris\n|\"National Theatre of Greece\"\n|\n|-\n|2017 - 2018\n|\n|Candide  \"Η πόλη\"  (tranls. \"The city\")\n|Candide  Kimonas\n|\"Porta\" Theater  \"Athens Epidaurus Festival\"\n|\n|-\n|2018 - 2019\n|Giorgos Tsouris\n|\"170 τετραγωνικά (Moonwalk)\"  (transl. \"170 square meters  (Moonwalk)\")\n|Grigoris\n|Theater company \"Ma Non Troppo\"\n|\n|-\n|2019 - 2020 and 2020 - 2021\n|Anastasis Roilos\n|\"The Glass Menagerie\"\n|''Jim O'Connor\n|National Theater of Greece\n|\n|-\n|2021 - 2022\n|Fotis Stratigos\n|\"Cost of Living (play)\"\n|John\n|\"Porta\" Theater\n|\n|-\n|2022 - 2023\n|Dimitris Kapouranis\n|\"Tebas Land\"\n| Martin/Federico\n|Neos Kosmos Theater\n|\n|-\n|2023 - 2024\n|Giannis Tsoumarakis\n|\"Κασέτα\"  (transl. \"Tape)\n|Yiorgakis\n|\"Stathmos\" Theater\n|\n|}\nNote\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece the award ceremony was postponed. The awards were given at the 2024 award ceremony\nBecause the 2020 2021 theatre season was not completed due to the pandemic, the nominations of the two seasons (2019 - 2020 and 2020 - 2021) were merged into one.\nDimitris Lalos, not a drama school graduate, was awarded after the Committee amended the statute to remove the requirement that recipients must be graduates of a recognized drama school.\nNikos Kardonis  was nominated for the award three years in a row (2002, 2003, 2004).\nReferences"
