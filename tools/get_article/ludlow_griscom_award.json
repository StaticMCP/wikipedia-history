The Ludlow Griscom Award was first presented to Roger Tory Peterson, considered the father of the modern field guide,  in 1980. In its early years, the award was more broadly designated to recognize \"outstanding contributions to excellence in field birding.\" After being awarded in 1981, it was awarded biennially from 1984 to 1998; since then, it has been awarded on an annual basis.\nList of winners\nSince the award's inception in 1980, there have been 34 recipients, including several years in which more than one award was given.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
