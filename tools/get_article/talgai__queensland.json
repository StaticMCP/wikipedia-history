In the , Talgai had a population of 106 people.\nGeography\nThe locality of Ellinthorp is entirely contained within the boundaries of Talgai. This is quite unusual in Queensland which does not normally permit such a containment, requiring all localities to have at least two neighbours.\nThe South Western railway line enters the locality from the north (Elphinstone/Allora) and exits to the south-east (Hendon). The Ellinthorp railway station is an abandoned railway station on the line (), which, despite the name, is in Talgai but immediately east of the town of Ellinthorp.\nHistory\nThe locality name derives from the pastoral run name established by G. Gammie who arrived on the Condamine River with stock on 9 March 1841.\nTalgai West Provisional School opened on 22 September 1902. On 17 April 1916, it became Talgai West State School. It experienced a number of temporary closures due to low student numbers. On 1 July 1920, it became a half-time provisional school in conjunction with Deuchar Provisional School (meaning a single teacher was shared between the two schools). The school closed on 31 October 1921, reopening on 19 July 1922 as a full-time school. It closed on 27 August 1962, briefly reopened and closed permanently in 1963. It was on the south-eastern side of Dalrymple Creek Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Talgai had a population of 106 people.\nIn the , Talgai had a population of 106 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Talgai.
