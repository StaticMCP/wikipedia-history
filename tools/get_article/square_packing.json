If a is an integer, the answer is a^2, but the precise – or even asymptotic – amount of unfilled space for an arbitrary non-integer a is an open question.\n{{multiple image|total_width=540\n|image1=5 kvadratoj en kvadrato.svg\n|caption1=5 unit squares in a square of side length 2+1/\\sqrt{2}\\approx 2.707\n|image2=10 kvadratoj en kvadrato.svg\n|caption2=10 unit squares in a square of side length 3+1/\\sqrt{2}\\approx 3.707\n|image3=Packing_11_unit_squares_in_a_square_with_side_length_3.87708359....svg\n|caption3=11 unit squares in a square of side length\na\\approx 3.877084\n}}\nThe smallest value of a that allows the packing of n unit squares is known when n is a perfect square (in which case it is \\sqrt{n}), as well as for n={}2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 24, 34, 35, 46, 47, and 48. For most of these numbers (with the exceptions only of 5 and 10), the packing is the natural one with axis-aligned squares, and a is \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\,\\rceil, where \\lceil\\,\\ \\rceil is the ceiling (round up) function.\nThe figure shows the optimal packings for 5 and 10 squares, the two smallest numbers of squares for which the optimal packing involves tilted squares.\nThe smallest unresolved case is n=11.  It is known that 11 unit squares cannot be packed in a square of side length less than \\textstyle 2+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}} \\approx 3.789. By contrast, the tightest known packing of 11 squares is inside a square of side length approximately 3.877084 found by Walter Trump.\nThe smallest case where the best known packing involves squares at three different angles is n=17. It was discovered in 1998 by John Bidwell, an undergraduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi, and has side length a\\approx 4.6756.\nBelow are the minimum solutions for values up to n = 12; the case n=11 remains unresolved:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Number of unit squares n\n! colspan=\"2\" |Minimal side length a of big square\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" |1\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" |2\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" |2\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" |2\n|-\n|5\n|2.707...\n|2+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" |3\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" |3\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" |3\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" |3\n|-\n|10\n|3.707...\n|3+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n|-\n|11\n| colspan=\"2\" |3.877... ?\n|-\n|12\n| colspan=\"2\" |4\n|}\nAsymptotic results\n, the optimal packing for  squares]]\nFor larger values of the side length a, the exact number of unit squares that can pack an a\\times a square remains unknown.\nIt is always possible to pack a \\lfloor a\\rfloor \\!\\times\\! \\lfloor a\\rfloor grid of axis-aligned unit squares,\nbut this may leave a large area, approximately 2a(a-\\lfloor a\\rfloor), uncovered and wasted.\nInstead, Paul Erdős and Ronald Graham showed that for a different packing by tilted unit squares, the wasted space could be significantly reduced to o(a^{7/11}) (here written in little o notation).\nLater, Graham and Fan Chung further reduced the wasted space to O(a^{3/5}).\nHowever, as Klaus Roth and Bob Vaughan proved, all solutions must waste space at least \\Omega\\bigl(a^{1/2}(a-\\lfloor a\\rfloor)\\bigr). In particular, when a is a half-integer, the wasted space is at least proportional to its square root. The precise asymptotic growth rate of the wasted space, even for half-integer side lengths, remains an open problem.\nSome numbers of unit squares are never the optimal number in a packing. In particular,\nif a square of size a\\times a allows the packing of n^2-2 unit squares, then it must be the case that a\\ge n\nand that a packing of n^2 unit squares is also possible.\nIn a circle\nSquare packing in a circle is a related problem of packing n unit squares into a circle with radius as small as possible. For this problem, good solutions are known for n up to 35. Here are the minimum known solutions for up to n = 12 (although only the cases n = 1 and n = 2 are known to be optimal):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Number of squares\n!Circle radius\n|-\n|1\n|\\sqrt{2}/2 \\approx 0.707\\ldots\n|-\n|2\n||\\sqrt{5}/2 \\approx 1.118\\ldots\n|-\n|3\n|5\\sqrt{17}/16 \\approx 1.288\\ldots\n|-\n|4\n|\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\ldots\n|-\n|5\n|\\sqrt{10}/2 \\approx 1.581\\ldots\n|-\n|6\n|1.688...\n|-\n|7\n|\\sqrt{13}/2 \\approx 1.802\\ldots\n|-\n|8\n|1.978...\n|-\n|9\n|\\sqrt{1105}/16 \\approx 2.077\\ldots\n|-\n|10\n|3\\sqrt{2}/2 \\approx 2.121\\ldots\n|-\n|11\n|2.214...\n|-\n|12\n|\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236\\ldots\n|}\nIn other shapes\nPacking squares into other shapes can have high computational complexity: testing whether a given number of axis-parallel unit squares can fit into a given polygon is NP-complete. It remains NP-complete even for a simple polygon (with no holes) that is orthogonally convex, with axis-parallel sides, and with half-integer vertex coordinates.\nSee also\n*Circle packing in a square\n*Squaring the square\n*Rectangle packing\n*Moving sofa problem\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
