However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nArmy Air Force Training Command\n* Yakima Air Base, Yakima\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Contract Flying School\n: Now: Yakima Air Terminal\nAir Transport Command\n* Gray Field, AAF, Fort Lewis\n: 302d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now:  Gray Army Airfield, active Army Airfield which supports Fort Lewis.\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Boeing Field, Seattle\n: Aircraft delivery facility, Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n* Moses Lake AAF, Moses Lake\n: 465th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Moses Lake Air Force Base (1947)\n: Was: Larson Air Force Base (1948-1966)\n: Now: Grant County International Airport\n* Ellensburg AAF, Ellensburg\n: Now: Bowers Airport\n* Spokane AAF, Spokane\n: 498th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Spokane Air Force Base (1947-1950)\n: Now:  Fairchild Air Force Base\nSecond Air Force\n* Bellingham/Tulip AAF, Bellingham\n: Now: Bellingham International Airport\n* Ephrata AAF, Ephrata\n: 355th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Ephrata Municipal Airport\n* Geiger/Sunset Field AAF, Spokane\n: 41st Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Spokane International Airport\n:: Seven Mile Gunnery Range, Spokane\n:: Sub-base of Geiger AAF(7 miles NW of Spokane; may have only been a target field.)\n:: Felts Field, Spokane\n:: Auxiliary of Geiger AAF\n:: Joint civil and contract AAF pilot training\n:: Now: Felts Field Airport\n* McChord Field AAF, Tacoma\n: 43d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: McChord Air Force Base (1947-2010)\n: Now:  Joint Base Lewis-McChord\n* Olympia AAF, Olympia\n: Now: Olympia Airport\n* Paine Field AAF, Everett/Paine\n: 33d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Paine Air Force Base (1951-1968)(Joint use USAF/Civil Airport)\n: Now: Paine Field/Snohomish County Airport\n* Port Angeles AAF, Port Angeles, Washington\n: Now: William R.
