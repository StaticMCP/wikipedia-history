J. King was an American schooner built in 1867. She operated on the Great Lakes for 19 years, before sinking in a storm on Lake Michigan, on 15 September 1886, while laden with iron ore. Her wreck was located nearly 139 years after her loss, on 28 June 2025, in  of water near Cana Island, by a Wisconsin archaeological group.\nHistory\nF. J. King (US official number&nbsp;9299) was a wooden schooner, built by master shipwright George R. Rogers in Toledo, Ohio, in 1867. Her hull was  in length,  in beam, and . She had a gross register tonnage of 280.55 tons, and a net register tonnage of 266. She was launched on 16 June 1867. Although built to fit within the confines of the Welland Canal, she was found to be too long, resulting in the removal of her stern's corners in 1869, to facilitate her passage. She was shortened by  a year later.\nShe lost her bowsprit on Lake Erie, on 2 November 1871, eventually running aground at the Black River.\nA third mast was installed in 1885.\nFinal voyage\nIn the early hours of 15 September 1886, F. J. King was headed from Escanaba, Michigan, to Chicago, Illinois, under the command of Captain William Griffin, with a cargo of iron ore. While off the Door Peninsula, she ran into a southwest gale, with  waves, resulting in her aging hull springing a leak. The crew attempted to pump the water out of her hull, which proved unsuccessful. Eventually, Griffin gave the order to abandon the sinking schooner, and the crew boarded the schooner yawl. At approximately 02:00, as the crew rowed towards the shore, they witnessed F. J. King sink bow-first, her aft deckhouse being blown about  into the air as she went down. The crew was picked up by the schooner La Petite, which transported them to Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin.\nWreck\nThe wreck of F. J. King was located on 28 June 2025, nearly 139 years after her loss, by the Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association, a group led by maritime historian Brendon Baillod. She was located in  of water, near Baileys Harbor. She was discovered after a two-hour search of the targeted area suggested by historical sources from Baillod's research. Over the previous decades, she had been one of the most highly sought-after shipwrecks on Lake Michigan, with a dive club issuing a $1,000 reward for her discovery in the 1970s. Most wooden vessels laden with ore sustained significant damage upon impacting the lake bottom, but F. J. King hull remains mostly intact.\nThe wreck will be nominated for a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.\n}}"
