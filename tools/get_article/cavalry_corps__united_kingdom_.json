The corps was formed in France in October 1914, under General Sir Edmund Allenby. It was later broken up in March 1916, but re-established in the following September.  It served as part of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front throughout its existence.\nFormation\nThe Corps consisted of the three cavalry divisions serving in France, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd divisions.\nThe cavalry division consisted of cavalry regiments in brigades. They were armed with rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only armed with the shorter range carbine. The cavalry division also had a high allocation of artillery compared to foreign cavalry divisions, with 24 13-pounder guns organised into two brigades and two machine guns for each regiment. However, when dismounted, the cavalry division was the equivalent of two weakened infantry brigades with less artillery than the infantry division.\nBattles\n*Battle of La Bassee\n*Battle of Messines (1914)\n*Battle of Arras (1914)\n*Battle of Cambrai (1917)\n* The Battles of the Hindenburg Line\nCommanders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"width=\n|-\n!style=|Rank\n!style=|Name\n!style=|Dates\n!style=|Notes\n!style=|Ref.\n|-\n| Lieutenant-General\n| E.
