      "text": "# A Queen for Caesar\n\n| runtime = 100 minutes\n| country = France  Italy\n| language = Italian\n}}\nA Queen for Caesar (, ) is a 1962 Italian-French historical drama film directed by Piero Pierotti and Victor Tourjansky and starring Pascale Petit, George Ardisson and Rik Battaglia. It is set in Egypt in 48 BC. Unlike other films about Caesar and Cleopatra, this film focuses entirely on the dynastic struggle within Egypt leading up to the arrival of Caesar, and in fact, we only see him in the closing scene of the film when he arrives at the Ptolemaic Palace in Alexandria.\nThis film was shot at the Incir De Paolis Studios in Rome. 20th Century Fox bought the rights for the film to keep it out of release lest it compete with their own Elizabeth Taylor Cleopatra.\nCast\n*Pascale Petit as Cleopatra\n*George Ardisson as Achillas\n*Rik Battaglia as Lucius Septimius\n*Akim Tamiroff as Gnaeus Pompeius\n*Gordon Scott as Julius Caesar\n*Corrado Pani as Ptolemy\n*Franco Volpi as Apollodoros\n*Ennio Balbo as Theodotos\n*Nerio Bernardi as Scaurus\n*Aurora de Alba as Rabis\n*Nando Angelini as Sextus Pompeius\n*Nino Marchetti as Pompey's messenger\nSee also\n*List of historical drama films\n*List of films set in ancient Rome\n*Cleopatra VII\n*Ptolemaic dynasty\n*History of Ptolemaic Egypt\n*1st century BC\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
