      "text": "# OHBM Replication Award\n\n}}\nThe OHBM Replication Award is an award presented annually by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM). It is presented to a researcher in recognition of conducting and disseminating the results of a neuroimaging replication study of exceptional quality and impact.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"| Researcher\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:60%;\"| Scientific Article\n|-\n| 2024\n| Helmet T.

Researchers focusing too much on novel discoveries instead of scrutinizing previously published findings was big contribution to reproducibility crisis in psychology.\nThe award has increased the likelihood of members of the neuroimaging community to conduct and disseminate results of replication studies and the procedure of running the award has been made publicly available in hope other academic communities could implement similar awards.\nSee also\n* List of neuroscience awards\nReferences"
