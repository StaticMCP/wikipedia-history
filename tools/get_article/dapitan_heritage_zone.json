Because of its prehistoric origins, collection of heritage structures and role in the exile of local patriot Dr. Jose Rizal, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared a specific portion of the city, along with its heritage structures, as a Heritage Zone or Historic Center in 2011. The declaration was made in coordination with the 150th birth anniversary of Dr. Rizal in June 2011.\nRationale for Declaration as Heritage Zone/Historic Center\nThe NHCP board resolution cites several reasons for the declaration of certain areas in downtown Dapitan as Heritage Zone/Historic Center:\n#Dapitan is considered as one of the oldest settlements in Northern Mindanao\n#Dapitan was founded as a mission by the Jesuits in 1629\n#Dr. Jose Rizal was exiled in Dapitan, initially detained at the Casa Real before being transferred to Talisay (now the José Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape in Dapitan)\n#Downtown Dapitan showcases a good number of heritage structures, some of which are officially declared by national government agencies as National Historical Landmarks and National Cultural Treasure\nList of Cultural Properties of the Philippines in Dapitan\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 37.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 15.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 21.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 30.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 29.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 23.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 09.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 10.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 11.JPG\n}}\n| image = Lateral View, Adasa Ancestral House.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 06.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 05.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 03.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 02.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 27.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 26.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 25.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 34.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 32.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 40.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 38.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 20.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 18.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 17.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 16.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 13.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 12.JPG\n}}\n| image = Bagting Ancestral House.jpg\n}}\n| image = Jimmy Adasa Ancestral House.jpg\n}}\n| image = Severina Icao Ancestral House.jpg\n}}\n| image = Sagario Icao Ancestral House.jpg\n}}\n| image = Calexto Sy-Gaco Ancestral House.jpg\n}}\n| image = Victoria Elumbar Ancestral House.jpg\n}}\n| image = Balisado Ancestral House.jpg\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 24.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 36.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 33.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 31.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 22.JPG\n}}\n| image = Dapitan Ancestral House 08.JPG\n}}\n| image = Rizal Shrine, Dapitan City (Features and Structures) 10.JPG\n}}\n| image = Rizal Shrine, Dapitan City (Features and Structures) 11.JPG\n}}\n| image = Casa Cuadrada.JPG\n}}\n| image = Rizal Shrine, Dapitan City (Features and Structures) 17.JPG\n}}\n| image = Rizal Shrine, Dapitan City (Features and Structures) 19.JPG\n}}\n| image = Rizal Shrine, Dapitan City (Features and Structures) 18.JPG\n}}\n| image = Rizal Shrine, Dapitan City (Features and Structures) 08.JPG\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n* Philippine Registry of Cultural Property\n* List of historical markers of the Philippines in Zamboanga Peninsula\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150516040531/http://nhcp.gov.ph/nhcp/policies/board-resolutions/ List of Board Resolutions of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130402233027/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/downloads/RA%2010066%20Heritage%20Law.pdf Republic Act No. 10066 - National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009]"
