It is a part of the municipal neighbourhood and the City Information System area of Radość. It is a residential area of single-family housing.\nHistory\nBorków was founded in the 15th century, as a small farming community.\nIn 1918, at the current Mrówcza Street, was opened the Borków Warszawski railway station. It was part of the Jabłonna Railroad narrow-gauge line. The station was closed in 1951.\nOn 14 May 1951, Borków was incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nIn 2004, the district of Wawer was subdivided into the areas of the City Information System, with Borków becoming part of the area of Radość.\nReferences"
