Nicknamed \"GNAT\" by the allies (acronym from \"German Naval Acoustic Torpedo). Generally regarded as the best German torpedo of World War II (between 5000 and 6000 launched, with a reported hit-rate of approximately 53%, a number that was considerably reduced after post-war analysis). TV torpedoes were modified to TXI from fall 1944.\n|-\n|TVa\n|G7es\n|Zaunkönig\n|Electric, lead-acid\n|534,6mm / 7163 mm\n|80 hm (21.5 kn)\n|Ke1 (Pi4d)\n|TV specially adapted for use on S-Boote (end-of-run detonation, reduced speed, longer range and different depth-mechanism).\n|-\n|TVb\n|G7es\n|Zaunkönig\n|Electric, lead-acid\n|534.6 mm / 7163 mm\n|80 hm (21,5 kn)\n|Ke1 (Pi4c)\n|TVa adapted for use as an anti U-boat torpedo.\n|-\n|TVI\n|G7es\n|\n|Electric, lead-acid\n|534,6 mm / 7163 mm\n|75 hm (30 kn)\n|Kf (Pi6)\n|TIIIa with minor changes (probably with Lut II) and a special warhead which was never fielded.\n|-\n|TVII\n|G7ut\n|Steinbutt\n|Walter turbine\n|534,6 mm / ? mm\n|80 hm (45 kn)\n|Kb (Pi2), Kf (Pi6)\n|Ingolin (peroxide)/dekalin/helman/water fueled BO VI-turbine. Combustion-chamber arranged horizontally in the longitudinal axis.

Wire guided by means of visual sight from a command bunker / observation site. Intended for coastal defence and use from beach-batteries (wagenbatterie), later evolved to also include special harbour installations (molenbatterie) and mobile launchers (schiffbatterie). Only 200 torpedoes were built (gerät 43d), originally for 35 \"spinne sperrbatterie\" to be established on the French channel- and Mediterranean coastline from July 1944. Some batteries were also established in Belgium, and after the allied invasion in July 1944 most of the French batteries were moved to the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark (85 TX torpedoes were located in 14 Danish batteries after the war).\n|-\n|TXa\n|G7ef NYK\n|Spinne\n|Electric, lead-acid (13T battery)\n|534.6&nbsp;mm / 7163&nbsp;mm\n|50 hm (30kn)\n|Ka (Pi1)\n|A new version (gerät 43 cp) of the TX tested for use on midget submarines (Marder/ Molch/ Seehund) with good results.

Operational. About 90 torpedoes in stock by September 1944 (a combination of new torpedoes and the ongoing upgrade of existing TV), but no certain record of usage during the war (five TXI torpedoes were recovered from the U-534, now on display in Birkenhead, UK. Four of the TXIs were picked for parts and blown up. Only one torpedo remains on display with the U-boat).\n|-\n|TXII\n|G5e\n|\n|Electric, lead-acid (9T battery)\n|534.6mm / 5550&nbsp;mm\n|30 hm (30 kn)\n|Kb (Pi2)\n|Short torpedo developed for the smaller type XVII coastal submarines.

It was proposed to get very good speed and range, but development ended due to lack of resources.\n|-\n|\n|M5\n|\n|Wet heater\n|736.6&nbsp;mm / 4880&nbsp;mm\n|unknown (40 kn)\n|unknown\n|Experimental torpedo developed for coastal defence with a very large explosive charge and long range. Based on the TI with a 6-cylinder engine and only one speed-setting. 14 torpedoes built with 6 spare engines. Testing proved numerous \"bottom-runners\" due to failure of the launch and general poor quality of design and production. Two torpedoes were recovered and prepared for transport to the U.S. Ordnance Investigation Laboratory as museum pieces, but whether this was executed is doubtful.\n|-\n|\n|G7es\n|Geier I and II\n|Electric\n|534.6&nbsp;mm / 7163&nbsp;mm\n|unknown\n|\n|Active sonar homing, experimental.

Proposed shorter range than the Steinbutt, due to losing space for fuel in favour of electronics for the seeker. The project was in model-testing phase, when all plans and models were destroyed in a bombing raid. The project was not continued.\n|-\n|\n|\n|Wal / Steinwal\n|Ingolin Walter turbine\n|\n|192 hm (45 kn)\n|\n|Experimental.

German oxygen-torpedo of similar design as the Japanese Type 93 'Long Lance'. Based on the G7a(TI) (reusing the airtank, the waterchamber and the enginecompartment) combined with the turbine from the G7ut. Expected to have improved performance over the TI, with almost no bubbletrack. Also it would have superior safety for handling/storage on board, as well as less loss of energy over time in storage, compared to the ingolin-torpedoes.\n|-\n|\n|G7ur\n|Hecht\n|Walter rocket\n|\n|\n|\n|Experimental\n|-\n|\n|G7ur\n|Mondfisch\n|Walter rocket\n|\n|700 hm (45 kn)\n|\n|Experimental.

The hull was of an unconventional \"manta\" design, which had several benefits: Less drag in the water. Potential for much higher payload (a total weight of 4 tonnes using the TIII engine, compared to the 1.5 tonne total weight of the TIII). Much more stable travel compared to the traditional tube-formed torpedo hulls.

It was used at least until October 1944 in the Ofotfiord-batteries outside Narvik, and most likely for the rest of the war on some \"schwimmende\" batteries protecting the major German battleships in their bases in northern Norway.\n|-\n|\n|G/250\n|\n|Wet heater\n|450&nbsp;mm / 7083&nbsp;mm\n|60 hm (27 kn) / 25 hm (36 kn)\n|\n|Older Whitehead torpedo (developed at the end of WW1), which saw limited use during World War II. For instance, it replaced older Norwegian torpedoes at two shore torpedo batteries on the west coast of Norway during the war (original torpedoes often failed due to conditions at the site, as well as a wish for an increased explosive charge).\n|-\n|\n|F5\n|\n|Wet heater\n|450&nbsp;mm / 6505&nbsp;mm\n|15 hm (45 kn)\n|\n|Norwegian 45&nbsp;cm torpedoes (beutewaffe) used at certain shore-based torpedo batteries in Norway, mainly the Whitehead Modell III.\n|-\n|\n|Horten torpedoes\n|\n|Wet heater\n|Various\n|Various\n|\n|Norwegian 45&nbsp;cm and 53&nbsp;cm torpedoes (beutewaffe + continued production at Torpedofabrik Horten during the war): The Modell VIII, VIIIb, IX, XI and XIb.\n|}\nKriegsmarine torpedo designation system\nThe first letter indicates the diameter:\n* G = 53&nbsp;cm (21&nbsp;in)\n* F = 45&nbsp;cm (17.7&nbsp;in)\n* H = 60&nbsp;cm (23.7&nbsp;in)\n* M = 75&nbsp;cm (30&nbsp;in)\nThe number indicates the approximate length (for example, the length of the TI is 7163&nbsp;mm):\n* 7 = 7 m\n* 6 = 6 m\n* 5 = 5 m\nNext letter(s) indicates specific features regarding propulsion and control:\n* a = Atem, i.e. Pressluft/Dampfgemisch-Antrieb (pressurized air/steam - \"wetheater\" - engine)\n* e = Elektrischer Antrieb (electric engine)\n* f = Fernlenkung (remote control by radio or cable)\n* d = Sauerstoff/Dampfgemisch-Antrieb (oxygen/steam engine)\n* p = Primärbatterie-Antrieb (primary battery propulsion)\n* m = Verbrennungsmaschine mit Kreislaufverfahren (combustion engine recirculating air)\n* u = Sauerstoffträger Ingolin spurenfreier Antrieb (oxygen/steam engine with hydrogen peroxide as source for air, and no exposing \"bubbletrack\")\n* x = Torpedo mit 3-Achsen Steuerung (3-axes control)\n* r = Raketen- oder Düsenantrieb (rocket- or jet propulsion)\n* s = Schall, Torpedo mit akustischen Suchkopf (acoustic seeker)\n* t = Turbinenantrieb (turbine-engine)\n\"r\" and \"t\" were only used with \"u\" to further denote the features of the ingolin-torpedoes.\nSome sources claim that \"s\" only was used with \"a\" to denote the development of G7a with acoustic seeker-capability; however, it was no doubt used for the electric torpedoes with acoustic seekers (as \"es\" or just \"s\").\nWhen the torpedo reached production status and was fielded (i.e. for operational use), Kriegsmarine gave it a short designation \"T\", or \"Torpedonummer\", with the number given in Roman lettering (TI, TII, TIII, TIV, etc.).\nFor different versions of the main torpedo, a small Arabic letter was added (for example TIIId, TVa etc.) denoting changes from the main design.\nWarheads\nWarheads were designated with the letter \"K\" (K = short for Kopf, meaning \"head\") and a small Arabic letter, with an additional number denoting variants of the head (for instance changing the material composition from bronze to steel, adding/removing spants during the course of the war or the method of installing the explosives). Examples: Ka, Ka1, Kb, Kb1, etc.\nThe explosive charge of warheads in German torpedoes during WW2, were different compositions of the Schießwolle (SW) that consisted mainly of a mixture of Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and Hexanitrodiphenylamin (HND):\n* Schießwolle 18: 60% Trinitrotoluol, 24% Hexanitrodiphenylamin, 16% Aluminumpowder\n* Schießwolle 36: 67% Trinitrotoluol, 8% Hexanitrodiphenylamin and 25% Aluminumpowder\n* Schießwolle 39: 45% Trinitrotoluol, 5% Hexanitrodiphenylamin, 20% Aluminumpowder, 30% Ammonium Nitrate\n* Schießwolle 39a: 50% Trinitrotoluol, 10% Hexanitrodiphenylamin, 35% Aluminumpowder, 5% Ammonium Nitrate\n* Schießwolle xx (unknown): 0.6% Trinitrotoluol, 40% Aluminumpowder, 31.4% Ammonium Nitrate, 5.9% Sodium Nitrate, 2.3% Potassium Nitrate, 9.7% Cyclonite, 10.1% Ethylene Diamine Dinitrate\nA total of 41 different types of explosive charges were used in German underwater ordnance, all given a \"S\"-number (1-41) for identification (only those relevant for torpedoes are listed here):\n* S1 = SW 18 (solid consistency)\n* S2 = SW 36 (solid consistency)\n* S3 = SW 39 (solid consistency)\n* S4 = Combination of S2 and S3 (solid consistency)\n* S5 = Combination of S1 and S3 (solid consistency)\n* S16 = SW xx (described as a \"lumpy\" consistency)\n* S17 = SW 39a (solid consistency)\n* S18 = Combination of S16 and S17 (easy liquefiable consistency)\nList of Kriegsmarine warheads with weight/type of explosive charge:\n* Type Ka: 295&nbsp;kg/S2 (pre-WW2 head, not produced after ca 1941)\n* Type Ka 1: 297&nbsp;kg/S3 or S4 (in service from June 1942 to August 1943)\n* Type Ka 2: 293&nbsp;kg/S3, S4 or S18 (in service from August 1943)\n* Type Kb: 282&nbsp;kg/S2 or S18 (in service from September 1942)\n* Type Kb 1: 282&nbsp;kg/S18 (in service from February 1944)\n* Type Kc: 260&nbsp;kg/S2 (in service from March 1943)\n* Type Kc 1: 256&nbsp;kg/S2 or S18 (in service from October 1943)\n* Type Kc 2: 256&nbsp;kg/S18 (in service from May 1944)\n* Type Ke: 274&nbsp;kg/S2 (in service from July 1943)\n* Type Ke 1: 274&nbsp;kg/S2 or S18 (in service from February 1944)\n* Type Kf: Unknown weight, but probably similar to the type Ke/S18 (in service from April 1944)\nPistols\nPistols used the \"Pi\" designations to begin with (Pi = short for pistole). The early models were named according to function and/or torpedo type like \"PiG7H\" or \"PiG7A-MZ\", but this was later replaced with a simple system of numbers, like \"Pi1\", \"Pi2\" etc.\nTo indicate variants within the main design, a small Latin letter was added after the number, like \"Pi1a\", \"Pi1b\" etc.\nAt some point, \"Pi\" was dropped for pistols with combination of mechanical (direct hit) and magnetic (influence) mechanisms, to the \"TZ\" designation (TZ = Torpedo-Zündeinrichtung). For example, the mechanical mechanism from the \"Pi1\" pistol combined with the magnetic mechanism from \"Pi2\" became the \"TZ2\".\nThe main booster charge used in German pistols was Pentrite, typically 300 g.\nThe following torpedopistols reached operational status with Kriegsmarine during WW2:\n* Pi G7A-AZ: Mechanical igniter with short whiskers (replaced by Pi1)\n* Pi G7A-MZ: Combined mechanical and (faulty) magnetic igniter (replaced by Pi2)\n* Pi Typ 3F (later renamed Pi40): Copy of the British Type 3F pistol\n* Pi G7H (later renamed Pi1): Mechanical igniter - most common pistol used besides Pi2\n* Pi1a: Pi1 with netcutter\n* Pi1b: Mechanical igniter with pendulum, rather than whiskers (not successful)\n* Pi1c: Improved Pi1a\n* Pi1d: Special version of the Pi1c for the TIIId \"Dackel\" torpedo (waterflap-safety replaced by a manually pulled safetypin, due to the torpedo's extremely low speed)\n* Pi2: Mechanical igniter from Pi1 with an additional magnetic igniter\n* Pi2a: Pi2 with netcutter\n* Pi2c: Special variant of the Pi2a with its own battery for the low-speed TIIIb torpedo\n* Pi2d: Improved variant of the Pi2c for torpedoes with low speed (TIIIb and TIIIc)\n* Pi2e: Variant of the Pi2a with pendulum for the mechanical igniter, used for TIIIb and TIIIc torpedoes\n* Pi2f: Variant of the Pi2d for low-speed TIIIb and TIIIc torpedoes\n* Pi2 EDS: Pi2 with \"endstreckendetonierersicherung\" - a feature to ensure the torpedo did not detonate if missing the target\n* TZ2: Combination of Pi1 and Pi2 used for torpedoes with low speeds below 30kn\n* Pi3: Italian pistol - similar in function to the Pi2, but a different construction\n* Pi3a: Variant of the Pi3, similar to the Pi1a\n* Pi3c: Pi3 with netcutter\n* PiSic (later renamed TZ3): Italian-constructed passive magnetic igniter combined with the mechanical igniter from the Pi3. Only used for G7a(TI) and G7a(TXIV)\n* TZ3a: Improved German variant of the PiSic.\n* TZ3b: TZ3a with improved induction-coil for the magnetic igniter\n* Pi4: New pistol for heads with front-mounted acoustic seeker – i.e. the TIV, TV and TIX (mounted on top of the head with a pendoulum-based mechanical igniter and a separate active magnetic igniter)\n* Pi4a: Pi4 with improved mechanical igniter\n* Pi4b (also designated Pi DWK): New design of the mechanical igniter by Deutsche Werke Kiel (hence \"DKW\")\n* Pi4c: Mechanical (pendolum) igniter (only used in the TZ5).\n* Pi4c EDS (later renamed Pi4e): Pi4c with the EDS-function from the Pi2 EDS\n* Pi4d SZE: Pi4c with \"selbstzerstörungseinrichtung\" - a function to ensure that the torpedo would detonate after missing a target, i.e. the opposite of EDS\n* Pi5 (later renamed TZ5): Combination of Pi4c and a new active magnetic igniter (sender in head, receiver in tail)\n* Pi6: New pistol ready for operational use with the TVI and TVII (ingolin) torpedoes. Based on the Pi3\n* Pi6a: Pi6 improved with parts of the Pi1a\n* TZ6: Mechanical igniter from the Pi6 and a new active magnetic igniter (sender in head, receiver in tail)\nCode names\nCode names were intended to be used only through the development period for security measures. However, in some cases they remained after the torpedo was fielded and had been designated with a \"T\"-number.\nTorpedo pistols, program seeker-systems and other special arrangements also had their own \"system\" of code names, using the names of birds, fish or animals (for example Pi \"Leuchtfisch\", GA \"Specht\", seeker \"Storch\", control \"Viper\", target detector \"Salamander\" etc.). During development, the pistols were often given code names designated by the industrial developer or manufacturer. Generally, these consisted of simple words, syllables, or names associated with the firm or the engineers in charge of the pistol's development (for example Pi \"Otto\", Pi \"Atlas\", Pi \"Berlin\" etc.).\nProgram steering\nProgram steering was accomplished by a mechanical device (\"Federapparat\") coupled to the torpedo's gyroscope to alter its course in various pattern. Two main types was fielded during WW2: \"Fat\" and \"Lut\".\nFat (\"Flächenabsuchender Torpedo\"): Changed the torpedo's course over time so that it ran various patterns. Three versions: Fat I, II and III (Fat III was later redesignated Lut I).\nLut (\"Lageunabhängiger Torpedo\"): Similar to Fat, but changed the torpedo's course to a preset heading directly after launch, so the launching platform could fire torpedoes at targets without changing its own course. Two versions: Lut I and Lut II (+ a special Lut I variant for the TIIId torpedo with a very long initial straight run of 36000 m).\nThe Fat or Lut mechanisms initiated control of the gyroscope after an initial (preset) straight running distance.\nFat I (\"S-shaped\" loop-patterns):\nThe initial straight distance could be set from a minimum of 500 m to a maximum of 1500 m.\nTwo loop-patterns were available: \"short\" and \"long\", and in addition, there was a choice of right or left turns (i.e. a total of 5 settings on the Fat-mechanism).\nFor \"short\" loops, the straight distance between turns was 800 m, with a total width of the pattern-search of 1140 m\nFor \"long\" loops, the straight distance between turns was 1500 m, and a total width of the pattern-search of 1840 m.\nThe turning radius for both patterns was 170 m.\nFat II (\"S-shaped loops or circular patterns):\nThe same as Fat I, but with an additional choice for \"circular pattern\", where the torpedo would run in a circle after the initial straight-run. This was an option primarily used by U-boats against attacking surface-ships that ran a zig-zag pattern hunting the U-boat (the goal was to locate the torpedo's circle-run just ahead of the attacking ship, hoping for a \"lucky\" hit).\nFat III / Lut I (\"zig-zag\" pattern):\nInitial torpedo course could be chosen, so the torpedo platform did not need to change its bearing to an optimal course for torpedo launch.\nThe \"Lut-speed\" (i.e. the resulting advance-speed of the torpedo, considering the zig-zag pattern) could be chosen, and subsequently, the straight legs between turns would be adjusted accordingly.\nLut II:\nSame as Lut I, but even slower Lut-speeds could be chosen.\nList of World War II Luftwaffe torpedoes\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Designation\n!rowspan=2|Codename\n!rowspan=2|Propulsion\n!rowspan=2|Dimensions, dia./length\n!rowspan=2|Range (speed)\n!rowspan=2|Warhead (pistol)\n!rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!Lw#\n!Type\n|-\n|\n|F5\n|\n|Wet heater\n|450mm / 5550mm\n|30hm (33kn)\n|unknown\n|Copy of the Norwegian F1 \"Horten\" torpedo.

It also combined further letters and numbers to indicate type and features of the torpedo:\n* I = Pressluft/Dampfgemisch-Antrieb (pressurized air/steam engine)\n* II = Ingolin-Antrieb (use of hydrogen-peroxide as oxygen carrier)\n* A = Tiefen- und Winkeleinstellung von Hand (manual setting of depth and steering)\n* B = Elektrische Tiefen- und Winkeleinstellung (electric setting of depth and steering, i.e. possible to change in flight)\n* C = Programmsteuerung (program steering)\n* 1 = Speed of 40kn\n* 2 = Speed of 33kn\n* 3 = Speed of 24kn\nWarheads\nLuftwaffe warheads were designated GK (= Gefechtskopf) followed by a number and a small Arabic letter for variants. Exerciseheads was designated ÜK (= Übungskopf).\nThe various types of explosives are described under the section of Kriegsmarine warheads above.\nOperational warheads (weight/type of explosive charge):\n* GK 1: 200&nbsp;kg/S3\n* GK 2: 180&nbsp;kg/S3\n* GK 2a: 240&nbsp;kg/S3\n* GK 3: 188&nbsp;kg/S17\n* GK 3a: 250&nbsp;kg/S17\nWarheads in various state of development/test and production by end of the war (weight/type of explosive charge):\n* GK 4: 230&nbsp;kg/S18\n* GK 4a: 220&nbsp;kg/S18\n* GK 5: 175&nbsp;kg/S18\n* GK 6: 180&nbsp;kg/S3\n* GK 9: 165&nbsp;kg/S18\n* GK 50: 300&nbsp;kg/S18\nPistols\nDesignations for Luftwaffe pistols used the same system as Kriegsmarine.\nThe following torpedopistols reached operational status with Luftwaffe during WW2:\n* Pi F5: Nose-mounted Luftwaffe adaption of the Kriegsmarine mechanical Pi G7A-AZ pistol (similar design with a reduced physical size)\n* Pi 30: Pi F5 with connector for activation by an additional top-mounted magnetich mechanism\n* Pi 42s: Nose-mounted mechanic mechanism in a Pi F5 housing without detonation-arms/whiskers.
