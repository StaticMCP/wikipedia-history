At the start of the game, both “jockey” and “horse” throw their stones at a straight line on the ground. The one whose stone is nearer to the line gets to ride the back of the other player. The “horse” then picks up two stones and hands them to the “jockey”, who has to throw one stone and then let the “horse” throw the second. If the “horse” accepts the challenge and hits the jockey's stone, he would win; but if the “horse” rejected the challenge, the “jockey” would have to hit the stone himself, and if he succeeded, the “horse” would need to continue supporting him. The game restarts once the jockey misses.\nGasing\nGoli\nGoli involved playing with marbles, such as by flicking a marble to dislodge opponents' marbles from a small circle in the middle of the playing area.\nVariations of tag\nGalah panjang\nReferences"
