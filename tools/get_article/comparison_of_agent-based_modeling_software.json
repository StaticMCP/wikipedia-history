More and more such toolkits are coming into existence, and each toolkit has a variety of characteristics. Several individuals have made attempts to compare toolkits to each other (see references). Below is a chart intended to capture many of the features that are important to ABM toolkit users.\nComparison of ABM Software\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sort-under\"\n|+ Agent Based Modeling Toolkit Comparison\n|-\n!\n!
