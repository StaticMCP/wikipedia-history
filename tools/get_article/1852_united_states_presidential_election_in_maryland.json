Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nMaryland voted for the Democratic candidate, Franklin Pierce, over Whig candidate Winfield Scott. Pierce won Maryland by a margin of 6.59%. This was the first presidential election in which Maryland voted Democratic. In addition, in 1851, Baltimore became an independent city, and had its election results calculated separately from Baltimore County for the first time. Also, Howard County voted for president for the first time in its history.\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Franklin Pierce\nDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Winfield Scott\nWhig\n! colspan=\"2\"  |John P.
