He remained in this role for more than 35 years, making him the longest-serving male newsreader on British television, having worked in both local and national news for 44 years. As a presenter for ITV News, he won the Royal Television Society's News Presenter of the Year award in 2004 and 2005.\nIn January 2020, he stepped down as an ITV News presenter and joined GB News on its introduction in 2021.

He then read Economics and Politics at the University of Bristol, and worked for the National Union of Students from 1974 to 1976.\nCareer\n1970s\nStewart's career in television started in 1976 with ITV's south of England company Southern Television in Southampton. He was a reporter, industrial correspondent, presenter and documentary maker. He recorded one of the last interviews with Lord Mountbatten before Mountbatten was assassinated by the IRA in 1979, and spent six weeks in Ford Open Prison to make a half-hour documentary.\n1980s\nHe joined ITN in 1980 as industrial correspondent, soon joining its roster of additional newsreaders. From 1983 to 1986, he was a presenter and reporter with ITN's Channel 4 News, and also presented ITN's News at 5.45.\nStewart provided live coverage of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster as the details of the tragedy unfolded. A two-minute newsflash became an unscripted, one-hour special programme. He also anchored, with Sandy Gall, the award-winning coverage on ITN on the night of the bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie and presented the ITV network coverage of the memorial service for the victims.\nHe moved again in May 1989, to ITN's flagship News at Ten bulletin, which he anchored live from the fall of the Berlin Wall, before spending a year in the United States as ITN's Washington correspondent. Four days after returning from his assignment in Washington he was sent to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, to anchor ITN's coverage of the Gulf War. He presented News at Ten, live from Saudi Arabia for two months. At the end of February, Stewart became the first British television reporter to broadcast live from the liberated Kuwait City. He presented News at Ten from Kuwait for a week before returning to the UK.\n1990s\nITN's network coverage of the 1992 Budget saw the ninth year of Stewart's involvement in the presentation of the annual event for ITV.

In 2003 he was dropped from this role after his second conviction for drink driving. He was more than three times the legal limit when his car crashed in Hampshire. Episodes that had already been recorded for broadcast in 2002 were finally shown in January 2006.\n2000s\nStewart was a presenter on the now defunct ITV News Channel for the 2003 Iraq War presenting a weekday programme called Live with Alastair Stewart''.\nHe was also a regular presence in ITV's national election coverage, co-anchoring network coverage of the general elections of 2005 (with Jonathan Dimbleby), 1997 (with Dimbleby and Michael Brunson), 1992 (with Jon Snow) and 1987 (with Alastair Burnet).

During the dispute, Stewart made a tweet addressed to Shapland which quoted the line \"Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd – His glassy elegance – like an angry ape\" from the Shakespeare play Measure for Measure. ITN received public complaints about this post and others. On 29 January 2020, Stewart deleted his Twitter account and announced he would be stepping down as an ITV News presenter. The following day, an ITN source said his departure came after \"multiple 'errors of judgment' in his use of social media\", not just the Measure for Measure quote. Following Stewart's departure, Shapland said \"I understand that Mr Stewart has acknowledged the words he used were misjudged and has expressed regret at what happened. I thank him for that... It is regrettable that he has decided to stand down and I take no pleasure in that.\"\nLater in 2020, Stewart worked as a relief presenter for Talkradio. In early April 2021 it was announced that he would join GB News to host a weekend news and current affairs programme.

He had the original 30-month ban reduced after he agreed to go on a rehabilitation course for disqualified drivers.\nIn September 2023, Stewart announced during an interview on GB News that he had been diagnosed with early-onset vascular dementia after suffering a \"series of strokes\" and began to feel \"discombobulated\" when [undertaking] simple tasks around the house. Stewart had smoked since his teens and had smoked up to 40 cigarettes a day, but said the diagnosis had led to him \"stopping smoking, going on longer dog walks and trying to keep his brain active with puzzles.\"\nCharity\nStewart is an active supporter of a number of charities, including Kids for Kids which helps villages in Darfur, and Patron of Naomi House & Jacksplace, hospices for children and young adults, near Winchester.
