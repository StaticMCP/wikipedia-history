A special operations platoon of 20 men led by  Léo Major in an overnight assault captured Hill 227 on the west flank of Hill 355 overlooking the RCR positions.\nThe following day, the US 3rd Division attempted to recapture Hill 355 summit, in a fierce battle over two days recovered the position.\n16 Canadians were killed, 34 wounded, and 3 taken prisoner.\nUS 3rd Division sustained many casualties in the three-day battle.\nThird battle (23–24 October 1952)\nThe battle started with Royal Canadian Regiment occupying the hilltop. A Chinese artillery assault followed by an infantry attack dislodged many of them. This was followed by an overnight Canadian artillery barrage, which had strong effect against the Chinese troops, who had not had an opportunity to find shelter, then a Canadian infantry counter-attack.\n18 Canadians were killed, 35 wounded, and 14 taken prisoner, the second-highest daily Canadian casualty count in the Korean War.\nMemorial\nRoyal Canadian Regiment commemorate this battle on 25 October (Kowang-San Day).\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323015518_Stanley_Arthur_Ward_Royal_Canadian_Regiment_7_July_1932_-_23_October_1952_Korea Stanley Arthur Ward, Royal Canadian Regiment (7 July 1932 - 23 October 1952), Korea.]"
