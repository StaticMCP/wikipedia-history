The Czech participating broadcaster, Czech Television (ČT), organised the national final ESCZ 2024 in order to select its entry for the contest.\nCzechia was drawn to compete in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 9 May 2024. Performing during the show in position 5, \"Pedestal\" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the second semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Czechia placed eleventh out of the 16 participating countries in the semi-final with 38 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2024 contest, Czech Television (ČT) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the Czech Republic eleven times since its first entry in . It competed in the contest on three consecutive occasions between 2007 and 2009 without qualifying to the final. After \"\" performed by Gipsy.cz placed 18th (last) in their semi-final in , failing to score any points, ČT withdrew from the contest between 2010 and 2014, citing low viewing figures and poor results as reasons for its absence. Since returning to the contest in  and qualifying to the final for the first time in , it had featured in five finals. In , it qualified for the final with the song \"My Sister's Crown\" performed by Vesna, ultimately placing 10th with 129 points.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, ČT organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster had used both national finals and internal selections to select its entries in the past. Between 2018 and 2020, and again since 2022, it had used the national final format ESCZ (formerly titled Eurovision Song CZ) as its selection method for the contest. On 16 October 2023, ČT confirmed its intention to participate in the 2024 contest, with its entry to be selected again via ESCZ.\nBefore Eurovision\nESCZ 2024\nESCZ 2024 was the sixth edition of ESCZ, the national final organised by ČT in order to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. The competition consisted of a live final held in Prague on 4 December 2023 followed by a voting round lasting until 11 December 2023.\nCompeting entries\nUpon confirming its participation in the contest on 16 October 2023, ČT opened a submission window for interested artists and composers lasting until 7 November 2023. At least one of the performers was required to have either Czech or Slovak citizenship for an entry to qualify to compete, while songwriters could be of any nationality.\nOn 14 November 2023, ČT announced that five finalist entries were being selected by music advisor Cesár Sampson () and the Czech delegation for the contest from over 200 submissions received, with the names of the artists to be revealed shortly; it was later clarified that the number of selected finalists may rise up to seven. The seven finalists were revealed on 28 November 2023; some of their songs, originally\nto be unveiled on the day of the final, were released earlier.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!Artist\n!Song\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Songwriter(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Aiko\n|\"Pedestal\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Elly\n|\"The Angel's Share\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Gianna Lei\n|\"Starlet\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lenny\n|\"Good Enough\"\n|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\"Red Flag Parade\"\n||Maria Broberg|Mikuláš Pejcha|Ondřej Slánský|Paweł \"Leon\" Krześniak|Žofie Dařbujánová}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\"Dopamine Overdose\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Tomas Robin\n|\"Out of My Mind\"\n|\n|}\nFinal\nThe seven competing entries were performed during a live show at the  in Prague on 4 December 2023, hosted for the second time in a row by  and co-hosted by Cesár Sampson. The show was broadcast on ČT art as well as via ČT's streaming platform  and the official Eurovision Song Contest's YouTube channel, and featured Lake Malawi and We Are Domi ( and  Czech representatives at Eurovision) as guest performers.

The revamped version features a lyrical change to comply with the contest's regulations prohibiting vulgar language. As part of the promotion of her participation in the contest, Aiko attended the PrePartyES in Madrid on 30 March 2024, the Barcelona Eurovision Party on 6 April 2024, the London Eurovision Party on 7 April 2024, the Eurovision in Concert event in Amsterdam on 13 April 2024, the Nordic Eurovision Party in Stockholm on 14 April 2024 and the Copenhagen Eurovision Party (Malmöhagen) on 4 May 2024.\nAt Eurovision\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at the Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals held on the respective dates of 7 and 9 May and the final on 11 May 2024. All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete in the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressd to the final. On 30 January 2024, an allocation draw was held to determine which of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show, each country would perform in; the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. Czechia was scheduled for the first half of the second semi-final. The shows' producers then decided the running order for the semi-finals; Czechia was set to perform in position 5.\nIn Czechia, all the shows were aired on ČT2, with commentary provided by Vašek Matějovský, Patricie Kaňok Fuxová and Dominika Hašková. In addition, as part of the Eurovision programming, ČT cooperated with DR and SVT alongside other EBU member broadcastersnamely ARD/WDR, the BBC, ERR, , NRK, NTR, RÚV, VRT and Yleto produce and air a documentary titled ABBAAgainst the Odds, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of  with \"Waterloo\" by ABBA.\nPerformance\nAiko took part in technical rehearsals on 29 April and 2 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May. The staging of her performance of \"Pedestal\" at the contest was directed by Matyas Vorda (LED screen content and light design) and Vit Belohradsky (camera and stage, a position previously held for the Czech performances in  and ), while her costume, black with sparkles and mesh, was designed by Lukáš Macháček. She was accompanied on stage by four Slovak female dancers, explained as representing the first four stages of grief during a breakup, i.e. denial, anger, bargaining and depression, with the singer representing the final stage, acceptance. Slovak choreographer Miňo Kereš decided the dance routine for the performance.\nSemi-final\nCzechia performed in position 5, following the entry from  and before entry from . The country was not announced among the top 10 entries in the semi-final and therefore failed to qualify to compete in the final.

Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting in the final vote, while the semi-final vote was based entirely on the vote of the public.

Each jury, and individual jury member, is required to meet a strict set of criteria regarding professional background, as well as diversity in gender and age. No member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final.\nThe following members comprised the Czech jury:\n* Ondřej Bambas\n* Bára Juránková\n* Kristyna Koreis\n* Marek Slabý\n* Jaroslav Špulák\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable collapsible plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n!
