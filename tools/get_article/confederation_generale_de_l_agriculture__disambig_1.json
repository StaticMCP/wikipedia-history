In 1944, the CNP began publishing a newspaper, La Résistance Paysanne. Key socialist figure François Tanguy-Prigent became minister of agriculture in the Provisional Government of the French Republic on 4 September 1944.\nThe CGA was officially established in March 1945 to unite agricultural sectors, including unions, mutual aid organizations, and cooperatives. Initially, the CGA prospered due to resources obtained from the dissolution of the Corporation Paysanne.\nIn March 1946, the Fédération nationale des syndicats d'exploitants agricoles (National Federation of Farmers' Unions or FNSEA) was created as a CGA branch, but it soon dominated the confederation. Political tensions between the PCF and SFIO weakened the CGA, which became dormant in 1953.\nHenri Canonge, the CGA's sole director, humorously described the organization's mission as: \"Article 1: Dissolve the Corporation Paysanne. Article 2: Reinstate it.\"\nFunction\nThe CGA aimed to unify agricultural organizations, akin to how the CGT unified labor unions. It advocated for agricultural modernization and farmer protection within a directed economy framework.\nThe CGA comprised:\n* A syndicalist group with:\n** Federations for farmers (future FNSEA), agricultural workers, technicians, and rural artisans\n** Youth organizations (later the Centre national des jeunes agriculteurs)\n* A cooperative group with:\n** Federations for cooperation, mutual aid, and agricultural credit\nThe organization struggled with internal conflicts between socialist and communist factions. The FNSEA, often led by former members of the Corporation Paysanne, eventually overshadowed the CGA.\nDecline\nThe CGA's six-year struggle ended with the FNSEA absorbing its representative union functions, while cooperative and mutual aid federations returned to their independent operations.\nThough short-lived, the CGA influenced agricultural policy and union structures in post-war France. Its decline marked the rise of the FNSEA as France's dominant farmers' union.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
