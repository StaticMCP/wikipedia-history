The signs are nearly the same as the European norm, but with small changes (e.g., the text is in Czech, some differences in colour). The law governing the road signs is Decree number 30/2001 Sb., many times amended, and replaced by decree 294/2015 Sb., in force since 1 January 2016.\nCzech road signs depict people with realistic (as opposed to stylized) silhouettes.\nCzechoslovakia had originally signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals on November 8, 1968, and ratified it on June 7, 1978. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which took effect on December 31, 1992, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia succeeded to the Vienna Convention on June 2, 1993, and on May 28, 1993, respectively.\nDimensions (mm)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
