It was released on October 25, 2022, through D.O.T. Audio Arts (aka Total Works) and FXCK RXP. Cities Aviv produced twelve of the album's seventeen tracks, with the other five tracks produced by Lukah.\nSecret Waters is part of a collection of two albums release by Cities Aviv during 2022, the first being Man Plays the Horn in February. Earlier in February, Cities Aviv had taken a four-day therapy retreat, inspiring the album's material.\nBackground and recording\nSecret Waters was largely inspired by a four-day therapy retreat that Cities Aviv had taken in early February, focused on exploring the generational and past life trauma of Black people. The creation of the album was described as \"effortless\" compared to those that required several hours of demoing to be completed.\nComposition\nLike much of Cities Aviv's work, Secret Waters is largely built upon distorted, chopped samples of previous recordings. Blake Gillespie of Bandcamp described the album as \"healing music built from ‘70s soul and jazz samples, full of urgency and encouragement.\" Influences from jazz and ambient music has been noted as the most prevelant influences on its musical style. Dweller Forever noted that Cities Aviv's \"eclectic\" sampling makes it hard to trace the origins of the songs used, as the website WhoSampled had a \"fittingly\" small amount of his sources listed.\nPromotion and release\nSecret Waters was released on October 25, 2022. The alias \"the Sun, Moon & Stars\" is crediited as the album's executive producer. Its description comes with the following instructions: \"ETERNAL LOVE. PEACE & BLACK POWER. PLAY LOUD.\"\nA limited run of 40 crewneck sweaters, bundled with a digital copy of Secret Waters, was released as a promotional item. 100 red wine-colored vinyls were also pressed for its physical release. The vinyls available on FXCK RXP's website come in five variants: \"Black Is Beautiful\", \"Grey\", \"Marbled\", \"White\", and \"Trans\".\nReception\nSecret Waters received positive reception from music publications. Eli Schoop of Dweller Forever said that the album's use of samples \"provide a context by which black music can be discovered and placed into proper history.\" they added that \"So much of black music has been wittingly or unwittingly lost, destroyed, or placed into disrepute. In consecrating very particular samples, Cities Aviv actively works against the invisibility of certain black music.\" The featured review on FXCK RXP's website, credited to \"Duncan Reviews\", described the production style of Secret Waters as \"far more focused\" than Man Plays the Horn, \"making up for its sibling's hyperactive tracklist with a crowded yet consistent collection of its own.\" He described the album's \"soulful overtones\" as \"mentally stimulating and playfully lethargic at the same time, cutting and pasting Cities Aviv's central character into a well-edited slideshow of vintage soul vocals and string-swept instrumentals.\" Duncan concluded that Secret Waters was \"by far one of the rapper's most significant statements, and he will no doubt go on to hone his craft to even greater heights.\"\nIn their list of honorable mentions for the year's best rap albums, HipHopGoldenAge staff opined that, \"No doubt Cities Aviv is an artist for a niche audience, but people who slept on him up to now just might be in for a nice surprise if and when they give Working Title For The Album Secret Waters a chance.\"\nTrack listing\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from Tidal and Bandcamp.\n* Gavin Mays – lyricist (all tracks), composer (1, 3, 5, 7–8, 10–14, 16–17)\n* Timothy Love – composer (2, 4, 6, 9, 15)\n* Hollow Sol – mastering (all tracks)\nReferences"
