It was hosted by Joel Dommett. The ceremony is typically held at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, but due to the damage the arena endured during Storm Eunice, it was confirmed that the awards would be held at Wembley. Originally scheduled to be held on 15 September 2022, they were since postponed to 13 October as a mark of respect following the death of Elizabeth II. The longlist nominations were released on 24 May 2022 and the shortlist was announced on 23 August 2022. Later that week, the ceremony announced that Robbie Williams would perform a medley of his discography, as well as a performance from Lewis Capaldi. In early October, Sam Ryder was announced to open the event instead of Williams.\nPerformances\n* Sam Ryder – \"Space Man\" & \"Somebody\"\n* Lewis Capaldi – \"Forget Me\"\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Category and presenter(s)\n!Winner\n!Nominated\n|-\n|\"The Bruce Forsyth Entertainment Award\"Presented by Oti Mabuse & Michelle Visage\n|''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!
