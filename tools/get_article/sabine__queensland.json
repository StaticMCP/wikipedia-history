In the , Sabine had \"no people or a very low population\".\nGeography\nThe Oakey–Cooyar Road runs along the eastern boundary of the locality.\nThe land is relatively flat and is  above sea level.\nThe land use is a mixture of crop growing (in the north and west of the locality) and grazing on native vegetation (in the south of the locality).\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from its former railway station, named by the Queensland Railways Department, after a pioneer land selector called Sabine.\nThe Cooyar railway line from Oakey to Kulpi (then known as Rosalie) was opened on 29 April 1912. It entered through the locality from the south-east (present-day Devon Park / Kelvinhaugh) and exited to the north-west (Acland) with the locality served by the Sabine railway station (). The line was partially closed beyond Acland on 1 May 1964, with the last segment closed on 8 December 1969.\nSabine State School opened on 15 April 1925. It closed circa 1937. It was at 210 Acland Sabine Road (), now within the present-day locality of Devon Park.\nDemographics\nIn the , Sabine had a population of 9 people.\nIn the , Sabine had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Sabine. The nearest government primary and secondary schools are Oakey State School and Oakey State High School, both in Oakey to the south.\nReferences"
