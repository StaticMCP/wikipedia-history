It occupied a strategic position near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a key maritime chokepoint connecting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\nThe population was ethnically mixed, predominantly Somali Issa clans and Afar. Following Somalia's independence in 1960, Somali nationalists in the territory sought either unification with Somalia or full independence, while the Afar community favored continued French administration.\nTwo referendums held in 1958 and 1967 favoured remaining under French control, though accusations of vote rigging and suppression of Somali voters heightened ethnic tensions.\nFront for the Liberation of the Somali Coast (FLCS)\nThe Front for the Liberation of the Somali Coast (FLCS) was a Somali nationalist guerrilla movement established in the early 1960s with the primary goal of ending French colonial rule over the Territory of the Afars and the Issas (now Djibouti).The group sought initially to unite the territory with the Somali Republic as part of a \"Greater Somalia,\" but over time it shifted toward advocating full independence for Djibouti itself.\nOrigins and Leadership\nThe FLCS was founded by Somali nationalists who opposed French control, including prominent figures such as Mahamoud Harbi, a former vice-president of French Somaliland and a vocal proponent of Somali unity. In 1966, Abdourrahman Ahmed Hassan, also known as \"Gaboode,\" was appointed Secretary-General. Later, from 1969 until independence in 1977, Aden Robleh Awaleh became the most prominent leader of the FLCS, guiding the movement through both political and armed struggle phases. Awaleh was sentenced in absentia by French authorities and was seriously injured during internal conflicts within the movement shortly before independence.\nGoals and Political Shift\nOriginally, the FLCS aimed to integrate French Somaliland with the Somali Republic to create a larger Somali nation. However, political realities and ethnic complexities in the territory prompted a strategic shift. By the mid-1970s, FLCS leadership began supporting Djibouti's independence as a separate state, distancing itself from Somali irredentism. This shift helped the FLCS build broader coalitions with local Afar leaders and other groups, culminating in the creation of the African People's League for Independence (LPAI) alliance.\nInternational Support and Funding\nThe Somali government, led by Siad Barre, supported the FLCS by providing arms, training, and safe havens within Somalia. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) recognized the FLCS as a legitimate liberation movement and offered financial and diplomatic support. Estimates suggest that the OAU provided funds in the early 1970s to help sustain FLCS operations. Additionally, some Arab states, particularly Algeria, offered political and material assistance to the group as part of wider anti-colonial solidarity.\nInternal Divisions and Leadership Struggles\nAs the independence referendum approached, the FLCS faced internal strife. In late 1976, several senior FLCS leaders were expelled amid accusations of financial mismanagement, fomenting unrest, and disagreements over the direction of the independence struggle. The central committee assumed direct control pending a formal congress, highlighting fractures within the movement that reflected broader political tensions in the territory.\nIndependence\nDespite internal divisions and leadership disputes, the FLCS remained a significant force in the struggle for independence. Its transition from a Somali nationalist movement advocating for Greater Somalia to a broader coalition supporting an independent Djibouti reflects the complex ethnic and political dynamics of the territory. The FLCS's efforts contributed decisively to the end of French colonial rule and the establishment of Independent Djibouti in 1977. The movement is regarded as a key actor in the country's path to sovereignty and national identity\nAftermath\nAfter independence, Djibouti retained close ties with France, which maintained military bases in the country. Political power was consolidated under President Hassan Gouled Aptidon. Ethnic tensions between the Somali and Afar communities continued to influence Djibouti's politics.\nReferences"
