      "text": "# New Zealand Republican Party (1967)\n\nThe New Zealand Republican Party of 1967 was a political party which campaigned for the creation of a New Zealand republic. It was founded by Bruce Jesson in 1967, and was linked to the Republican Association.\nIt did not win any seats in Parliament, and was dissolved in 1974. Instead, a new publication was created, The Republican, which was published until 1995. In 1995 another republican party, which was also subsequently dissolved, arose under the same name. The two are unconnected.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n* Republicanism in New Zealand\n* Republican Association of New Zealand\n* Bruce Jesson"
