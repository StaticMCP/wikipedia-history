The site has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological protected monument in Sri Lanka.\nThe site consists of two rectangular-shaped building foundations, built out of Kabok stones. The two foundations are located close to each other and assumed to be the palace ruins of King Nissanka Alagakkonara (Alakeshwara), who was a minister of King Vikramabahu III of Gampola.\nThe larger foundation is about  length and  wide while the smaller square foundation has a length and width of . Architectural features and the artifacts found from the site, such as grinding stones and water filters collaborate the assumption that the site is the palace of Alakeshwara. However this site is also known as the mausoleum (tomb) of Alakeshwara, but there is no conclusive evidence to substantiate this claim.\nSee also\n*Kingdom of Kotte\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Dkb2yUrC0 Sri Lanka Telecom Pura Varuna - Alagakkonara Palace]"
