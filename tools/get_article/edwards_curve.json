The concept of elliptic curves over finite fields is widely used in elliptic curve cryptography. Applications of Edwards curves to cryptography were developed by Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange: they pointed out several advantages of the Edwards form in comparison to the more well known Weierstrass form.\nDefinition\nThe equation of an Edwards curve over a field K which does not\nhave characteristic 2 is:\n:  x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d\\ x^2 y^2 \\,\nfor some scalar d\\in K\\setminus\\{0,1\\}.\nAlso the following form with parameters c and d is called an Edwards curve:\n:  x^2 + y^2 = c^2(1 + d\\ x^2 y^2) \\,\nwhere c,&nbsp;d&nbsp;∈&nbsp;K with cd(1&nbsp;−&nbsp;c4·d)&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0.\nEvery Edwards curve is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve in Montgomery form, and thus admits an algebraic group law once one chooses a point to serve as a neutral element.  If K is finite, then a sizeable fraction of all elliptic curves over K can be written as Edwards curves.\nOften elliptic curves in Edwards form are defined having c=1, without loss of generality. In the following sections, it is assumed that c=1.\nThe group law\n(See also Weierstrass curve group law)\nEvery Edwards curve x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2 over field K with characteristic not equal to&nbsp;2 with d \\ne 1 is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve over the same field: (1/e)v^2 = u^3 + (4/e - 2)u^2 + u, where e=1-d, u=\\frac{1+y}{1-y}, v=\\frac{2(1+y)}{x(1-y)} and the point P = (0,1) is mapped to the infinity O. This birational mapping induces a group on any Edwards curve.\nEdwards addition law\nOn any elliptic curve the sum of two points is given by a rational expression of the coordinates of the points, although in general one may need to use several formulas to cover all possible pairs. For the Edwards curve, taking the neutral element to be the point&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;1), the sum of the points (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) is given by the formula\n: (x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = \\left( \\frac{x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1}{1 + dx_1 x_2 y_1 y_2}, \\frac{y_1 y_2 - x_1 x_2}{1 - dx_1 x_2 y_1 y_2} \\right) \\,\nThe opposite of any point (x,y) is (-x,y). The point (0,-1) has order&nbsp;2, and the points (\\pm 1,0) have order&nbsp;4. In particular, an Edwards curve always has a point of order&nbsp;4 with coordinates in K.\nIf d is not a square in K and  \\{(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)\\} \\in \\{(x,y)|x^2+y^2=1+d x^2 y^2 \\}^2, then there are no exceptional points: the denominators 1 + dx_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2} and 1 - dx_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2} are always nonzero. Therefore, the Edwards addition law is complete when d is not a square in K. This means that the formulas work for all pairs of input points on the Edwards curve with no exceptions for doubling, no exception for the neutral element, no exception for negatives, etc. In other words, it is defined for all pairs of input points on the Edwards curve over K and the result gives the sum of the input points.\nIf d is a square in K, then the same operation can have exceptional points, i.e. there can be pairs of points  (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2) \\in \\{(x,y)|x^2+y^2=1+d x^2 y^2 \\}  such that one of the denominators becomes zero: either 1 + dx_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2} = 0 or 1 - dx_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2} = 0.\nOne of the attractive features of the Edwards Addition law is that it is strongly unified i.e. it can also be used to double a point, simplifying protection against side-channel attack. The addition formula above is faster than other unified formulas and has the strong property of completeness\nExample of addition law :\nConsider the elliptic curve in the Edwards form with d=2\n:{\\displaystyle}x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2 x^2 y^2\nand the point P_1=(1,0) on it. It is possible to prove that the sum of P1 with the neutral element (0,1) gives again P1. Indeed, using the formula given above, the coordinates of the point given by this sum are:\n:x_3 = \\frac{x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2}{1 + 2x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2} = 1\n:y_3 = \\frac{y_1 y_2 - x_1 x_2}{1 - 2x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2} = 0\nAn analogue on the circle\nTo understand better the concept of \"addition\" of points on a curve, a nice example is given by the classical circle group:\ntake the circle of radius 1\n:{\\displaystyle}x^2+y^2=1\nand consider two points , P2=(x2,y2) on it. Let α1 and α2 be the angles such that:\n:{\\displaystyle}P_{1}=(x_{1},y_{1})=(\\sin{\\alpha_{1}},\\cos{\\alpha_{1}})\n:{\\displaystyle}P_{2}=(x_{2},y_{2})=(\\sin{\\alpha_{2}},\\cos{\\alpha_{2}})\nThe sum of P1 and P2 is, thus, given by the sum of \"their angles\". That is, the point P3=P1+P2 is a point on the circle with coordinates (), where:\n:{\\displaystyle}x_{3}=\\sin({\\alpha}_{1}+{\\alpha}_{2})=\\sin{\\alpha}_{1}\\cos{\\alpha}_{2}+\\sin{\\alpha}_{2}\\cos{\\alpha}_{1}=x_{1}y_{2}+x_{2}y_{1}\n:{\\displaystyle}y_{3}=\\cos({\\alpha}_{1}+{\\alpha}_{2})=\\cos{\\alpha}_{1}\\cos{\\alpha}_{2}-\\sin{\\alpha}_{1}\\sin{\\alpha}_{2}=y_{1}y_{2}-x_{1}x_{2}.\nIn this way, the addition formula for points on the circle of radius 1 is:\n:{\\displaystyle}(x_1,y_1)+(x_2,y_2) = (x_1y_2+x_2y_1,y_1y_2-x_1x_2).\nAddition on Edwards curves\nThe points on an elliptic curve form an abelian group: one can add points and take integer multiples of a single point. When an elliptic curve is described by a non-singular cubic equation, then the sum of two points P and Q, denoted P&nbsp;+&nbsp;Q, is directly related to third point of intersection between the curve and the line that passes through P and Q.\nThe birational mapping between an Edwards curve and the corresponding cubic elliptic curve maps the straight lines into conic sections\nAxy + Bx + Cy + D = 0. In other words, for the Edwards curves the three points P, Q and -(P+Q) lie on a hyperbola.\nGiven two distinct non-identity points P_1=(x_1,y_1), P_2=(x_2,y_2), P_1 \\ne P_2, the coefficients of the quadratic form are (up to scalars):\nA = (x_1 - x_2) + (x_{1}y_{2} - x_{2}y_{1}),\nB = (x_{2}y_{2} - x_{1}y_{1}) + y_{1}y_{2}(x_{2} - x_{1}),\nC = x_{1}x_{2}(y_{1} - y_{2}), D = C\nIn the case of doubling a point P=(x,y) the inverse point -2P lies on the conic that touches the curve at the point P. The coefficients of the quadratic form that defines the conic are (up to scalars):\nA = dx^2y - 1,\nB = y - x^2,\nC = x(1 - y), D = C\nProjective homogeneous coordinates\nIn the context of cryptography, homogeneous coordinates are used to prevent field inversions that appear in the affine formula. To avoid inversions in the original Edwards addition formulas, the curve equation can be written in projective coordinates as:\n(X^2+Y^2)Z^2=Z^4+dX^2Y^2.\nA projective point (X : Y : Z) corresponds to the affine point (X/Z : Y/Z) on the Edwards curve.\nThe identity element is represented by (0 : 1 : 1 ). The inverse of (X : Y : Z) is (-X : Y : Z).\nThe addition formula in homogeneous coordinates is given by: (X_1 : Y_1 : Z_1)+(X_2 : Y_2 : Z_2 )=(X_3 : Y_3 : Z_3 )\nwhere\nX_3 = Z_{1}Z_{2}(X_{1}Y_{2} + X_{2}Y_{1})(Z_{1}^{2}Z_{2}^{2} - dX_{1}X_{2}Y_{1}Y_{2})\nY_3 = Z_{1}Z_{2}(Y_{1}Y_{2} - X_{1}X_{2})(Z_{1}^{2}Z_{2}^{2} + dX_{1}X_{2}Y_{1}Y_{2})\nZ_3 = (Z_{1}^{2}Z_{2}^{2} - dX_{1}X_{2}Y_{1}Y_{2})(Z_{1}^{2}Z_{2}^{2} + dX_{1}X_{2}Y_{1}Y_{2})\nAlgorithm\nAddition of two points on the Edwards curve could be computed more efficiently in the extended Edwards form (X:Y:Z:T), where T=XY/Z:\n(X_3:Y_3:Z_3:T_3) = (X_1:Y_1:Z_1:T_1) + (X_2:Y_2:Z_2:T_2)\nA = X_{1}X_{2}; B = Y_{1}Y_{2}; C = dT_{1}T_{2}; D = Z_{1}Z_{2};\nE = (X_{1} + Y_{1})(X_{2} + Y_{2}) - A - B; F = D - C; G = D + C; H = B - A;\nX_3 = E \\cdot F; Y_3 = G \\cdot H; Z_3 = F \\cdot G; T_3 = E \\cdot H;\nDoubling\nDoubling can be performed with exactly the same formula as addition. Doubling refers to the case in which the inputs (x1,&nbsp;y1) and (x2,&nbsp;y2) are equal.\nDoubling a point P=(x,y):\n\\begin{align}\n(x,y)+(x,y) & = \\left( \\frac{2xy}{1+dx^2y^2}, \\frac{y^2-x^2}{1-dx^2y^2} \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\left( \\frac{2xy}{x^2+y^2}, \\frac{y^2-x^2}{2-x^2-y^2} \\right)\n\\end{align}\nThe denominators were simplified based on the curve equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2. Further speedup is achieved by computing 2xy as (x + y)^2 - x^2 - y^2. This reduces the cost of doubling in homomorphic coordinates to 3M&nbsp;+&nbsp;4S&nbsp;+&nbsp;3C&nbsp;+&nbsp;6a, while general addition costs 10M&nbsp;+&nbsp;1S&nbsp;+&nbsp;1C&nbsp;+&nbsp;1D&nbsp;+&nbsp;7a. Here M is field multiplications, S is field squarings, D is the cost of multiplying by the curve parameter d, and a is field addition.\n;Example of doubling\nAs in the previous example for the addition law, consider the Edwards curve with d=2:\nx^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2 x^2 y^2\nand the point P=(1,0). The coordinates of the point P_2 = 2P_1 are:\nx_2 = \\frac{2xy}{x^2 + y^2} = 0\ny_2 = \\frac{y^2-x^2}{2 - (x^2 + y^2)} = -1\nThe point obtained from doubling P is thus P_2=(0,-1).\nMixed addition\nMixed addition is the case when Z2 is known to be 1. In such a case A=Z1.Z2 can be eliminated and the total cost reduces to 9M+1S+1C+1D+7a\nAlgorithm\nA= Z1.Z2 // in other words, A= Z1\nB= Z12\nC=X1.X2\nD=Y1.Y2\nE=d.C.D\nF=B-E\nG=B+E\nX3= A.F((XI+Y1).(X2+Y2)-C-D)\nY3= A.G.(D-C)\nZ3=C.F.G\nTripling\nTripling can be done by first doubling the point and then adding the result to itself. By applying the curve equation as in doubling, we obtain\n:  3(x_1,y_1) = \\left( \\frac{(x_1^2+ y_1^2)^2 - (2 y_1)^2}{4(x_1^2-1)x_1^2 - (x_1^2-y_1^2)^2}x_1, \\frac{(x_1^2+ y_1^2)^2 - (2x_1)^2}{-4(y_1^2-1)y_1^2+(x_1^2-y_1^2)^2}y_1 \\right). \\,\nThere are two sets of formulas for this operation in standard Edwards coordinates. The first one costs 9M&nbsp;+&nbsp;4S while the second needs 7M&nbsp;+&nbsp;7S. If the S/M ratio is very small, specifically below 2/3, then the second set is better while for larger ratios the first one is to be preferred.\nUsing the addition and doubling formulas (as mentioned above) the point (X1&nbsp;:&nbsp;Y1&nbsp;:&nbsp;Z1) is symbolically computed as 3(X1&nbsp;:&nbsp;Y1&nbsp;:&nbsp;Z1) and compared with (X3&nbsp;:&nbsp;Y3&nbsp;:&nbsp;Z3)\n;Example of tripling\nGiving the Edwards curve with d=2, and the point P1=(1,0), the point 3P1 has coordinates:\nx_3 = \\frac{(x_1^2+ y_1^2)^2 - (2 y_1)^2}{4(x_1^2-1)x_1^2 - (x_1^2-y_1^2)^2}x_1 = -1\ny_3 = \\frac{(x_1^2+ y_1^2)^2 - 2(x_1 )^2}{-4 (y_1^2-1)y_1^2+(x_1^2-y_1^2)^2}y_1 = 0\nSo, . This result can also be found considering the doubling example: 2P1=(0,1), so 3P1 = 2P1 + P1 = (0,-1) + P1 = -P1.\n;Algorithm\nA=X12\nB=Y12\nC=(2Z1)2\nD=A+B\nE=D2\nF=2D.(A-B)\nG=E-B.C\nH=E-A.C\nI=F+H\nJ=F-G\nX3=G.J.X1\nY3=H.I.Y1\nZ3=I.J.Z1\nThis formula costs 9M&nbsp;+&nbsp;4S\nInverted Edwards coordinates\nBernstein and Lange introduced an even faster coordinate system for elliptic curves called the Inverted Edward coordinates in which the coordinates (X&nbsp;:&nbsp;Y&nbsp;:&nbsp;Z) satisfy the curve (X2&nbsp;+&nbsp;Y2)Z2&nbsp;=&nbsp;(dZ4&nbsp;+&nbsp;X2Y2) and corresponds\nto the affine point (Z/X,&nbsp;Z/Y) on the Edwards curve x2&nbsp;+&nbsp;y2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;dx2y2 with XYZ&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0.\nInverted Edwards coordinates, unlike standard Edwards coordinates, do not have complete addition formulas: some points, such as the neutral element, must be handled separately. But the addition formulas still have the advantage of strong unification: they can be used without change to double a point.\nFor more information about operations with these coordinates see http://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-edwards-inverted.html\nExtended Coordinates for Edward Curves\nThere is another coordinates system with which an Edwards curve can be represented. These new coordinates are called extended coordinates and are even faster than inverted coordinates.
