Leslie McCloud (Bergen) makes history when she is elected the first female president of the United States. However, her husband Thad McCloud (MacMurray) is less enthusiastic. The picture's supporting cast features Eli Wallach, Arlene Dahl, Edward Andrews, and Donald May.\nKisses for My President was the last theatrical film directed by Bernhardt, whose career stretched back to the silent era. While the movie was cited by the Hollywood Reporter as being the “first” to feature a woman president, Project Moon Base (1953) actually preceded it.\nPlot\nThe United States elects its first female president, Leslie Harrison McCloud. She and her husband Thad (he is never called \"first gentleman\"; he is called \"first lady\" a few times, but typically \"president's husband\") move into the White House with their daughter Gloria and son Peter.\nImmediately, the new president is too busy for her husband and family as she deals with powerful opposition from Senator Walsh and a Central American dictator, Raphael Valdez Jr..\nThad attempts to find something meaningful to do as the president's husband. He is upset with his feminine bedroom and office within the White House.\nDoris Reid Weaver, Thad's former flame and Leslie's classmate at Radcliffe, and now an international businesswoman, wants Thad back. During a seductive visit, she offers to make him vice president of her cosmetics company as bait. Leslie smells Doris's perfume on her husband that night and confronts him.\nLeslie asks Thad to show visiting dictator Valdez around Washington, with disastrous results, as Thad brawls with a male diner at a burlesque show, and accidentally hits Valdez. To further complicate things, the First Daughter is running around town with a very unsuitable boyfriend and using her position to get out of scrapes with the police. First son Peter has become a bully, using his Secret Service men for protection as he terrorizes everyone in his school, including the principal.\nThe president's husband finds an important role in a Cold War subplot that resembles the rise and fall of Senator McCarthy, when Thad proves that Senator Walsh blindly supports the Latin American dictator for reasons that are not patriotic; the dictator is paying Walsh's old law firm in a lawsuit against Thad. Walsh aggressively portrays the lady president as weak in resisting communism because she refuses to give Valdez more foreign aid for his personal enrichment while he does nothing to alleviate poverty in his country. The Soviets are also co-funding Valdez to prevent him from being influenced exclusively by the United States. As soon as the president drops her support for the dictator, the Soviets do so as well.\nLeslie then discovers that she is pregnant, and resigns the presidency to devote herself full-time to her family. Thad jokes about male superiority, that 40 million women voters put her into office, but only one man, himself, could remove her.\nCast\n* Fred MacMurray as Thad McCloud\n* Polly Bergen as U.S. President Leslie McCloud\n* Eli Wallach as Raphael Valdez Jr.\n* Arlene Dahl as Doris Reid Weaver\n* Edward Andrews as Sen.

It wouldn't be funny! That's what his picture says.\"\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1964\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
