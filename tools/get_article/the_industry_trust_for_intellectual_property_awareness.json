This thanked the British public for supporting the film and television industry by buying cinema tickets, genuine DVDs and authorised downloads. The series of three trailers acknowledged the role the public plays in helping to fund future film production. The new trailers form part of an ongoing campaign by the Industry Trust which has helped double the amount of UK consumers who think unofficial downloads and file-sharing are wrong in the last two years (NOP 07-08).\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/YouMakeTheMovies YouMakeTheMovies] video campaign on YouTube"
