The 250 scientists on board the Hespérides and RV Sarmiento de Gamboa embarked on an eight-month expedition (starting in December 2010)  scientific research with training for young researchers - advancing marine science and fostering the public understanding of science.\nThe project was under the umbrella of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation's Consolider – Ingenio 2010 programme and was led by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) with the support of the Spanish Navy. It is named after the original scientific Malaspina Expedition between 1789 and 1794, that was commanded by Alejandro Malaspina. Due to Malaspina's involvement in a conspiracy to overthrow the Spanish government, he was jailed upon his return and a large part of the expedition's reports and collections were put away unpublished, not to see the light again until late in the 20th century.\nObjectives\nAssessing the impact of global change on the oceans\nGlobal change relates to the impact of human activities on the functioning of the biosphere. These include activities which, although performed locally, have effects on the functioning of the earth's system as a whole.\nThe ocean plays a central role in regulating the planet's climate and is its biggest sink of  and other substances\nproduced by human activity.\nThe project will put together Colección Malaspina 2010, a collection of environmental and biological data and samples which will be available to the scientific community for it to evaluate the impacts of future global changes. This will be particularly valuable, for example, when new technologies allow levels of pollutants below current thresholds of detection to be evaluated.\nExploring the biodiversity of the deep ocean\nHalf the Earth's surface is covered by oceans over 3,000 metres deep, making them the biggest ecosystem on the planet. Nevertheless, due to the limitations of the technology available until just recently, the oceans remain something of a mystery. Indeed, it is often said that we know more about the Moon or Mars than Earth's oceans.\nThe development of new genomic techniques has now made it possible to explore life's diversity in the sunless depths of the oceans and assess the metabolic potential of the life they conceal. Exploring biodiversity in the ocean's depths could also yield important discoveries with applications in biotechnology.\nAssessing the impact of the original Malaspina expedition\nUsing sources in the countries visited, the project also aims to assess the socio-political impact of the Malaspina expedition in the regions it explored, and review the biography and historiography of Alejandro Malaspina, with particular emphasis on the work done in the wake of the expedition.\nPromoting marine science in Spain and public understanding of issues in marine sciences\nSpain has played a leading role in the exploration of the planet's resources, and remains a benchmark in international oceanographic research. The project aims to foster platforms for cooperation within the marine research community in Spain, and to bring science and research on global change closer to the public through various outreach activities, such as exhibitions, lecture series, etc.\nRaising the interest for marine sciences within the youth and training young scientists in a global perspective to ocean sciences\nThe project will be a unique opportunity to promote the training of young researchers in marine sciences. Four postgraduate\nprogrammes have jointly coordinated a training module, included in the FBBVA-CSIC's Malaspina Expedition Doctoral Programme, financed by the BBVA Foundation and the CSIC. The high point of this training module will be the use of the Sarmiento de Gamboa as a teaching vessel on the leg of the journey between Miami and Las Palmas.\nResearch blocks\nThe expedition's research work is subdivided into 11 blocks:\nThematic blocks\n* Physical oceanography: changes in the physical properties of the ocean\n* Ocean biochemistry: carbon, nutrients and trace gases\n* Atmospheric deposition and organic pollutants\n* Optics, phytoplankton, production and metabolism\n* Microbiological diversity and ecological function\n* The distribution and role of zooplankton in the world's oceans\n* The Malaspina expedition. Science and politics on the other side of the ocean\nHorizontal blocks\n* Coordination\n* Science and society\n* Training\n* Integration\nRoute taken by the expedition\nThe Malaspina expedition, taking place between December 2010 and July 2011, will involve two oceanographic research vessels: The Hespérides, operated by the Spanish Navy, which will circumnavigate the globe, and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100918195024/http://www.utm.csic.es/sarmiento.asp R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa], operated by the [http://www.utm.csic.es  Marine Technology Unit] from the CSIC, which will sail from Cadiz to Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and then return to Cadiz, where it will host a ‘floating\nuniversity’ providing oceanographic training for a group of master's degree students.\nRoute of the Hesperides\n* Cartagena - Cadiz\n* Cadiz - Río de Janeiro\n* Rio de Janeiro - Cape Town\n* Cape Town - Perth\n* Perth - Sydney\n* Sydney - Auckland\n* Auckland - Honolulu\n* Honolulu - Cartagena de Indias\n* Cartagena de Indias - Cádiz\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.expedicionmalaspina.es Circumnavigation expedition Malaspina.
