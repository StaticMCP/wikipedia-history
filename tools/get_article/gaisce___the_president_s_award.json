There are three awards: bronze, silver and gold.\nThe term \"gaisce\" is from the Irish language and can be translated as \"achievement\". The award was established by a trust deed under the patronage of the President of Ireland on 28 March 1985. In 1988 the award became part of the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Association. The profile of the award was raised substantially following the first award ceremonies performed by President Hillery in 1989.\nOverview\nGaisce's mission is to contribute to the development of all young people through the achievement of personal challenges. The process is non-competitive, meaning that all participants who complete their challenges may receive the Gaisce. Awards can be entered directly (without a previous award) or indirectly (from a previous award). The award is presented at a regional ceremony by either a famous person (bronze/silver) or the President of Ireland (gold).\nThere are four challenges in each award, which all must be completed outside of school activities (except ECDL):\n*Community Involvement – Charity work, Help with a youth club, Green Schools, Tidy Towns, Helping with children\n*Personal Skill – ECDL, Musical instrument, Dance, Singing lessons, Web design, Learn a foreign language (No sport allowed)\n*Physical Recreation – Walking, Cycling, Tennis, Badminton, Golf, Soccer, Gaelic, Rugby, Swimming, A marathon\n*Adventure Journey/Research – Adventure center, European walk/cycle, Mountain hike, Canoeing, (Those who would be unable to accomplish this due to a physical disability perform a suitable replacement activity such as research)\nor\n*Residential Project (Gold only) – Volunteering in a foreign/3rd world country, Attend a sports coaching, Irish language course\nEvery participant has the support of a President's Award Leader (PAL) who guides them through the challenges and sets appropriate activities.\nBronze\nParticipants must be at least age 15 to enter.

It is integrated into the new 'One Program' for those who are at the qualifying age. Scouting Ireland has an award scheme called the Chief Scout Award which is an award that runs in conjunction with the Gaisce, although it is considered by many to be more difficult. Scout, Venture Scout, and Rover Scout Chief Scout Awards are affiliated with the Bronze, Silver and Gold Gaisce Awards. Through the Chief Scout Award you can in turn earn your Gaisce, but this does not work the other way around; if you have completed your Gaisce you do not receive your Chief Scout Award as well. All leaders who have been invested into Scouting Ireland and who have the appropriate training can take the role of being a PAL, if they so desire.\nAlso, the award is affiliated with Irish Girl Guiding's Senior Branch, with the separate segments being represented in the Bronze star, Silver moon, and Gold sun badges.\nSummary of requirements\nBronze Award (15+ years)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
