Established in 1835 when Liverpool was first divided into wards under the Municipal Corporations Act, it was abolished in 1953 as part of reordering of Liverpool's electoral wards. It elected three councillors to Liverpool City Council.\nIt was named after St. Peter’s Church, which stood in Church Street. The church was demolished in 1922. The ward was in the city centre area, covering part of what is now Central Liverpool around Church Street, Seel Street, Concert Square, and nearby districts, with St Peter’s Church and Church Street at the core of the shopping district.\nOverview\nSt Peter’s was one of the original sixteen wards established under the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, each sending three councillors to the newly reformed Liverpool City Council. It took its name from the prominent St Peter’s Church on Church Street, Liverpool’s first post-Reformation parish church, built in 1700, consecrated on 29 June 1704, and designated a pro-cathedral upon the establishment of the Diocese in 1880.\nThe church was widely considered architecturally unattractive: its doorways were each in a different design. It featured an octagonal tower rising to 108 ft with a peal of eight to ten bells, an admired oak altar, stained-glass east window depicting St Peter, and a grand organ. St Peter’s hosted Liverpool’s first oratorio (Handel’s Messiah) and served as pro-cathedral until Liverpool Cathedral took over .\nBy 1919, services had ceased; the church was demolished by 1922 to widen Church Street and to free up land for retail development, most notably a Woolworths store, later part of Liverpool ONE. The site is now marked by a brass Maltese cross embedded in the pavement.\nPolitically, following its abolition in the 1953 boundary reorganisation, much of St Peter’s became part of newly created central wards such as Church Ward.\nHistory and Boundaries\n* 1835: Created as one of the sixteen municipal wards; elected three councillors. It initially covered the area around Church Street and the city centre WikipediaPenkett.\n* Late 19th century to early 20th century: Boundaries gradually evolved, sometimes reflecting divisions such as “St Peter’s plus Pitt Street,” with numbering shifting (e.g., No. 19, No. 16, No. 8 in different years based on census and reorganisation).\n* 1953: Formal abolition alongside many other wards, replaced by new electoral divisions under the Local Government Act\nElections\n1835\nPolling place : At the two windows of the Horse and Jockey public-house fronting Seel-street\n1836\n1837\n1838\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Time\n! colspan=\"2\" | John Woollright\n! colspan=\"2\" | Wilfred Troutbeck\n|-\n!
