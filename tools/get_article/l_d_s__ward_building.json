It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\nIt was deemed significant \"as an excellent example of early 20th century Tudor Revival design\" and as \"a significant work of a regionally important master architect, Miles E. Miller of Salt Lake City\".\nIt served as the church building for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (L.D.S.) local ward (parish/congregation).\nIt is a one-story, Tudor Revival style building with an L-shaped\nplan.  It is built of ashlar limestone upon a high poured-in-place concrete foundation.\nIt has a cedar roof, coming to ends at three gables, each including detailing of half-timbering and plaster. One of the gables is clipped like a jerkinhead. It has a rear courtyard from which a large limestone chimney rises.\nIt was sold by the L.D.S. ward in 1996; the new owners renamed it as Greystone Manor and reopened it as a bed and breakfast and wedding chapel and reception venue.\nIt is still in operation as that in 2019.\nThe building has also served as a community center, such as for a pumpkin-carving festival in 2012.\nIt is located at 187 S. 2nd Ave. in Lava Hot Springs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.lavahotspringsgreystone.com/ Greystone Manor], official website"
