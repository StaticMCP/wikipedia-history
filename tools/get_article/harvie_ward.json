He is best known for winning both the U.S. Amateur (twice) and the British Amateur.\nEarly life\nBorn in Tarboro, North Carolina, Ward attended the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. As a Tar Heel, he won the NCAA Division I individual title in 1949, and graduated with a degree in economics.\nAmateur career\nWard's win in the British Amateur came in 1952 (he finished runner-up in 1953), and his consecutive U.S. Amateur wins came in 1955 and 1956. He also won several other significant amateur events including the Canadian Amateur, making him one of two golfers to win the U.S., British, and Canadian Amateurs (the other is Dick Chapman). Ward is the only player in history to have won those three titles along with the NCAA Championship. He finished runner-up in the 1952 Western Amateur.\nWard played on three winning Walker Cup teams (1953, 1955, 1959), winning all six of his matches.\nIn 1957, Ward lost his amateur status, in a controversial ruling by the United States Golf Association, for accepting expense money from sponsors for golf tournaments. The ruling was reversed in 1958. His primary sponsor, Eddie Lowery, who was serving at the time on the USGA's Executive Committee, had incorrectly claimed income tax deductions for the money he was spending to sponsor Ward, one of his car dealership employees in the San Francisco area. Ward was unaware of this situation, and was not personally at fault. Following the ruling, Ward's life went into a tailspin, and he took several years to recover.\nWard played in 19 professional majors. In 11 Masters Tournament appearances, he finished in the top 10 twice (4th in 1957 and tied for 8th in 1955), in the top 25 five times, and only missed two cuts. In the U.S. Open, he made the cut in five of eight appearances, including a tie for 7th in 1955.\nProfessional career\nIn 1974, Ward turned professional. He became a club professional and golf instructor. His best-known student was three-time major winner Payne Stewart. He worked at Foxfire Country Club, Grand Cypress Golf Club (Orlando, Florida), Interlachen Golf Club (Winter Park, Florida), and Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Club (Southern Pines, North Carolina). He also won the 1977 North Carolina Open as a professional.\nHe played occasionally on the Senior PGA Tour from 1980 to 1990.\nAwards and honors\n* In 1965, Ward was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame\n* In 1981, Ward was inducted into the Carolinas Golf Reporters Association - Carolinas Golf Hall of Fame\n* In 1996, Ward was inducted into the Carolinas PGA Hall of Fame\nAmateur wins\n*1948 North and South Amateur\n*1949 NCAA Division I Championship, Carolinas Amateur, Tournament of Golf Champions\n*1952 British Amateur, Dogwood Invitational\n*1953 Dogwood Invitational\n*1954 Canadian Amateur\n*1955 U.S. Amateur, San Francisco City Championship\n*1956 U.S. Amateur\nProfessional wins\n*1977 North Carolina Open\nMajor championships\nAmateur wins (3)\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year!!Championship!!Winning score!!Runner-up\n|-\n| 1952 || British Amateur || align=center|6 & 5 ||  Frank Stranahan\n|-\n| 1955 || U.S. Amateur || align=center|9 & 8 ||  Bill Hyndman\n|-\n| 1956 || U.S. Amateur || align=center|5 & 4 ||  Chuck Kocsis\n|}\nResults timeline\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1947\n!1948\n!1949\n!1950\n!1951\n!1952\n!1953\n!1954\n!1955\n!1956\n!1957\n!1958\n!1959\n!1960\n!1961\n!1962\n!1963\n!1964\n!1965\n!1966\n|-\n|align=left|Masters Tournament\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T51\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T35\n|T35\n|T21\n|T14 LA\n|T20\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T8 LA\n|T34\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|4 LA\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|-\n|align=left|U.S. Open\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T39\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T7 LA\n|47\n|T26\n|T37\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|U.S. Amateur\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|QF\n|R128\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|R16\n|R128\n|R32\n|R32\n|R32\n|R64\n|style=\"background:lime;\"|1\n|style=\"background:lime;\"|1\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|R16\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|R16\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|R16\n|R64\n|R32\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|British Amateur\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:lime;\"|1\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|}\nNote: Ward never played in The Open Championship or the PGA Championship.\nLA = low amateur\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\nR128, R64, R32, R16, QF, SF = round in which player lost in match play\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nSources: Masters, U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur\nU.S. national team appearances\nAmateur\n*Walker Cup: 1953 (winners), 1955 (winners), 1959 (winners)\n*Americas Cup: 1952 (winners), 1954 (winners), 1956 (winners), 1958 (winners)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1358273,00.html Obituary]\n*"
