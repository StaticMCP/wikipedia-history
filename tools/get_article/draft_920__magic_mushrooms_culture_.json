      "text": "# Draft:920 (magic mushrooms culture)\n\nInternational Magic Mushroom Day, observed on September 20th (9/20). Established by Nicholas Reville, who also founded the 920 Coalition. It is day of action dedicated to raising global awareness about the psychoactive fungi, most commonly mushrooms, and their active compound, psilocybin. The day serves as a platform for policy reform advocacy, public education, and destigmatization, drawing inspiration from the cultural advocacy efforts and political impact of 4/20 for cannabis. The date was chosen because it marks the beginning of Autumn, the start of mushroom foraging season. The day is celebrated globally with events focused on education, awareness, and discussion about the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, including its use in treating depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction.\nReferences"
