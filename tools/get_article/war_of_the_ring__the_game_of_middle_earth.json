Tolkien.\nGameplay\nWar of the Ring is a two player game with one player as Gondor and one player as Mordor as they compete to control the One Ring.\nReception\nTony Watson reviewed War of the Ring in The Space Gamer No. 12. Watson commented that \"The game plays well as game, but the use of a Diplomacy type system in a game of this nature is questionable.\"\nIn the 1978 White Dwarf gaming magazine (Issue 05) it was reviewed by Mike Westhead. He gave it a score of 5 out of 10, disliking the presentation, expense, rule ambiguities and the fact it had no control markers.\nReferences"
