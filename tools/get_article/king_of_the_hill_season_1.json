New episodes of Judge's first animated series Beavis and Butt-Head continued to air on MTV when the first and second seasons of King of the Hill were airing on Fox, with the series eventually wrapping up in November 1997. A Beavis and Butt-Head spin-off titled Daria also premiered on MTV in March 1997, although Judge had no creative involvement with this series, and didn't voice any of the characters like in Beavis and Butt-Head.\nThe opening sequence utilized digital ink and paint, however, the episodes themselves were still done using traditional cel animation, and they would continue to be animated this way up until the eight season.\nMusic\nWork on the show's background music began in January 1997, the same month that it commenced airing. The show's production company, Judgmental Films, hired seven composers to write the music to the first 13 episodes. Among the seven composers were the band The Refreshments, who also composed the opening and closing themes that appear in every episode. The producers gave each composer one or two episodes to do whilst they were looking for the style that would best suit the program, eventually settling on John O'Connor and Roger Neill. Ron Wasserman, who composed the theme songs for Fox's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and X-Men: The Animated Series, was interested in composing for the show and submitted acoustic guitar music during pre-production, although he would not end up being chosen as one of the initial seven composers on the first season. For the first season and beyond, the show's background music would typically be done three weeks before episodes went to air.\nBroadcast history\nThe season originally aired Sundays at 8:30–9:00&nbsp;p.m. (EST) on the Fox Broadcasting Company. It aired following The Simpsons, another adult animated series. King of the Hill's strong ratings helped The Simpsons post its first increase over previous season ratings. To coincide with Fox's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXI, a 20 second skit titled \"Super Bowl Moment with Hank Hill\" aired on January 26, 1997, in which Hank tries to cut in line at a supermarket checkout on the day of the Super Bowl. This skit utilized digital ink and paint like the opening sequence did, and was later included on the DVD release of the first season.\nOn August 1, 1997, King of the Hill's first season premiered on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. In Australia, the season began running on the free-to-air Seven Network on November 23, 1997, and was also aired on pay channel Fox8 the following year. Between 1998 and 2010, the rest of the series would continue to be aired concurrently on both Seven and Fox8 in Australia. On the Seven Network, the series was initially airing during prime time, although during the 2000s it typically aired during weekend afternoon timeslots, alongside children's programs. In 1998, a French-Canadian dub of this season began airing in Quebec. This dub removed the Texas references and set the show in rural Quebec, changing the names of all characters and locations. It continued up until the eight season.\nReception\nIn December 1997, Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker named King of the Hill as one of the best shows to debut that year. He wrote, \"it was a good year for new cartoons, but I'll take King of the Hill bracing openheartedness over South Park's clever but monotonous heartlessness any time. TV’s most original, complicated new character was Hank Hill—middle-class Texan, political conservative, social libertarian, Willie Nelson fan—who exploded every white-guy small-screen stereotype in place since Archie Bunker.\"\nIn his 1997 review for the Pilot episode, Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"whereas The Simpsons sees animation as an opportunity to expand physical reality and tour plot realms far beyond the resources of regular sitcoms, King of the Hill is visually myopic in its storytelling.\" Rosenberg also wrote that King of the Hill lacked \"the panoramic vision and often slashing irreverence and social observances of The Simpsons, which, although not the hilarious achiever it once was, remains a cleverly written farce and commentary on pop culture. On Sunday, for example, hapless Homer's eyewitness reports of an eerily glowing, ghostly figure in the night bring Dana Scully and Fox Mulder of Fox's own The X-Files to Springfield [in] a series whose points of reference, from sci-fi to goofy TV newscasters, are as topical and eclectic as ever.\" Rosenberg added that, \"despite being more conventionally humanoid and recognizable than the exotic universe of The Simpsons, the premiere of King of the Hill is light on media signposts, limiting itself pretty much to benign mentions of NBC's Seinfeld.\" A December 1997 article from Time magazine titled \"The Best Television of 1997\" stated that, \"The Simpsons is still the cleverest comedy on TV, and King of the Hill creates a world with far more specificity than any live-action sitcom. Both are smarter, funnier and, in fact, more human than Friends or Seinfeld.\"\nIn June 1997, Katy Daigle of the Hartford Courant labelled the show as being an improvement over Mike Judge's other animated series Beavis and Butt-Head, claiming that, \"it has substance to its consistently on-target humor.\" The Capital Gazette described it as \"The Simpsons meets Beavis and Butt-head in the Texas burbs\" in February 1997. Phil Gallo of Variety commented in his review of the Pilot that, \"it's a break from all the over-the-top sitcoms Fox has scheduled in hopes of building off the Married... with Children franchise. Humor here is far more sedate. Plenty of folks won't get it.\" Gallo added that the animation is \"neither as crude as B&B or as sharp as The Simpsons, which Film Roman also produces.\"\nContemporary reception\nIn a 2006 review of the DVD release of the first season, Dorian Lynskey of British publication Empire gave it four out of five stars, commenting that \"it seems odd that the Hills were once dismissed as Simpsons copyists. Compared to Springfield's helter-skelter surrealism, Arlen, Texas is doggedly low-key and the animation is as flat as the landscape.\" Lynskey added \"Texan-born creator Mike Judge's natural feel for small-town rhythms and ordinary lives makes this the truest and kindest of the post-Groening animated sitcoms.\" In 2021, Ben Sherlock of Game Rant considered the series to be more original than Fox's later adult animated show Family Guy, which premiered in 1999. He wrote \"King of the Hill and Family Guy are both adult-oriented animated comedies capitalizing on The Simpsons success, but only one is called a rip-off.\"\nCast and characters\nMain cast\n* Mike Judge as Hank Hill / Boomhauer / Stuart Dooley (voice)\n* Kathy Najimy as Peggy Hill (voice)\n* Pamela Adlon as Bobby Hill / Clark Peters (voice)\n* Brittany Murphy as Luanne Platter / Joseph Gribble (voice)\n* Johnny Hardwick as Dale Gribble (voice)\n* Stephen Root as Bill Dauterive / Buck Strickland (voice)\n* Toby Huss as Cotton Hill / Kahn Souphanousinphone, Sr. / Joe Jack / Additional voices (voice)\nGuest stars\n* Willie Nelson as Himself (voice)\n* Dennis Hopper as Himself (voice)\n* Chuck Mangione as Himself (voice)\n* Laurie Metcalf as Cissy Cobb (voice)\n* Jennifer Coolidge as Miss Kremzer (voice)\nEpisodes\n| ProdCode=4E01\n|Viewers=19.92\n| ShortSummary=Strickland propane salesman and family man, Hank Hill, is accused of beating his son, Bobby, after Bobby gets a black eye from getting hit in the face with a baseball during a Little League game and rumors spread that Hank beat up a teenaged Megalo-Mart employee (when really he just yelled at him for not knowing if the store sells a tap and die and some WD-40).
