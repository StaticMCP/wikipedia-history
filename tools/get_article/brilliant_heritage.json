It aired on KBS1 every weekday at 20:30 (KST) starting April 20, 2020.\nIt was the only KBS1 daily soap opera to draw average ratings of more than 20% since the end of Lovers in Bloom in 2017. Lead actor Park In-hwan won the Top Excellence Award during the 2020 KBS Drama Awards.

The move shocks his sons, but Gye-ok's strong work ethic makes Young-bae realize that she'll be able to keep his cold noodle restaurant afloat.
