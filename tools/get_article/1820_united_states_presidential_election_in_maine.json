The state's popular vote chose nine representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMaine voted in its first ever United States presidential election, having become the 23rd state by splitting off Massachusetts on March 15 of the same year. The state cast its nine electoral votes for the Democratic Republican candidate and incumbent president James Monroe, who won the state by a margin of 91.56%.\nEffectively, the 1820 presidential election was an election with no campaign, since there was no serious opposition to Monroe and Tompkins. In fact, Monroe won all the electoral votes, barring one from neighboring New Hampshire, which was cast for Secretary of State John Quincy Adams.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Maine\nReferences"
