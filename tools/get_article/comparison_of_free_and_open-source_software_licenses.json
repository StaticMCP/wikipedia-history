      "text": "# Comparison of free and open-source software licenses\n\nThis comparison only covers software licenses which have a linked Wikipedia article for details and which are approved by at least one of the following expert groups: the Free Software Foundation, the Open Source Initiative, the Debian Project and the Fedora Project. For a list of licenses not specifically intended for software, see List of free-content licences.\nFOSS licenses\nFOSS stands for \"Free and Open Source Software\". There is no one universally agreed-upon definition of FOSS software and various groups maintain approved lists of licenses. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is one such organization keeping a list of open-source licenses. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) maintains a list of what it considers free. FSF's free software and OSI's open-source licenses together are called FOSS licenses. There are licenses accepted by the OSI which are not free as per the Free Software Definition. The Open Source Definition allows for further restrictions like price, type of contribution and origin of the contribution, e.g. the case of the NASA Open Source Agreement, which requires the code to be \"original\" work. The OSI does not endorse FSF license analysis (interpretation) as per their disclaimer.\nThe FSF's Free Software Definition focuses on the user's unrestricted rights to use a program, to study and modify it, to copy it, and to redistribute it for any purpose, which are considered by the FSF the four essential freedoms. The OSI's open-source criteria focuses on the availability of the source code and the advantages of an unrestricted and community driven development model. Yet, many FOSS licenses, like the Apache License, and all Free Software licenses allow commercial use of FOSS components.\nGeneral comparison\nFor a simpler comparison across the most common licenses see free-software license comparison.\nThe following table compares various features of each license and is a general guide to the terms and conditions of each license, based on seven subjects or categories. Recent tools like the European Commissions' Joinup Licensing Assistant, makes possible the licenses selection and comparison based on more than 40 subjects or categories, with access to their SPDX identifier and full text. The table below lists the permissions and limitations regarding the following subjects:\n* Linking - linking of the licensed code with code licensed under a different license (e.g. when the code is provided as a library)\n* Distribution - distribution of the code to third parties\n* Modification - modification of the code by a licensee\n* Patent grant - protection of licensees from patent claims made by code contributors regarding their contribution, and protection of contributors from patent claims made by licensees\n* Private use - whether modification to the code must be shared with the community or may be used privately (e.g. internal use by a corporation)\n* Sublicensing - whether modified code may be licensed under a different license (for example a copyright) or must retain the same license under which it was provided\n* TM grant - use of trademarks associated with the licensed code or its contributors by a licensee\nIn this table, \"permissive\" means the software has minimal restrictions on how it can be used, modified, and redistributed, usually including a warranty disclaimer. \"Copyleft\" means the software requires that its source code be made publicly available and that all provisions in the license be preserved in derivative works.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sort-under sticky-header\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!License\n!Author\n!Latest version\n!Publication date\n!Linking\n!Distribution\n!Modification\n!Patent grant\n!Private use\n!Sublicensing\n!TM grant\n|-\n|Academic Free License || Lawrence E.

Organizations usually approve specific versions of software licenses. For instance, a FSF approval means that the Free Software Foundation (FSF) considers a license to be free-software license. The FSF recommends at least \"Compatible with GPL\" and preferably copyleft. The OSI recommends a mix of permissive and copyleft licenses, the Apache License 2.0, 2- & 3-clause BSD license, GPL, LGPL, MIT license, MPL 2.0, CDDL and EPL.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sort-under sticky-header\" style=\"text-align: center; width:99%\"\n|-\n!License and version\n!FSF approval\n!GPL (v3) compatibility\n!OSI approval\n!Debian approval\n!Fedora approval\n|-\n|Academic Free License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Apache License 1.x ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Apache License 2.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Apple Public Source License 1.x ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Apple Public Source License 2.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Artistic License 1.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Artistic License 2.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Beerware License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Original BSD license ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Revised BSD license ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Simplified BSD license ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Zero-Clause BSD License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Boost Software License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|CeCILL ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Common Development and Distribution License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Common Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Creative Commons Zero ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Cryptix General License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Eclipse Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Educational Community License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Eiffel Forum License 2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|European Union Public Licence ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|GNU Affero General Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|GNU General Public License v2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|GNU General Public License v3 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|GNU Lesser General Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|GNU Free Documentation License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|IBM Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Intel Open Source License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|ISC license ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|LaTeX Project Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Microsoft Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Microsoft Reciprocal License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|MIT license / X11 license ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|MIT No Attribution License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Mozilla Public License 1.1 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Mozilla Public License 2.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|NASA Open Source Agreement ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Netscape Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Open Software License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|OpenSSL license ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|PHP License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Python Software Foundation License 2.0.1; 2.1.1 and newer ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Q Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Reciprocal Public License 1.5 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Sleepycat License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Sun Industry Standards Source License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Sun Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Sybase Open Watcom Public License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Unlicense ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|W3C Software Notice and License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL) ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|XFree86 1.1 License ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|zlib/libpng license ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Zope Public License 1.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|Zope Public License 2.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Creative Commons licenses\n* Free software\n* Free-software license\n* List of free and open-source software packages\n* List of open-source hardware projects\n* List of open-source programming languages\n* List of open-source video games\n* Open-source license\n* Open-source software\n* Source-available software\n* SPDX-License-identifier\n* License proliferation\n* European Union Public Licence\nNotes\nReferences"
