It represents more than 9,000 members, and is affiliated with the Law Council of Australia.  The society provides support and public advocacy for the legal profession.\nThe society originated as an informal meeting of solicitors in Brisbane, on the 7th of August 1873, and was formalised as the \"Queensland Law Association\" in 1883.  In 1927, it was incorporated under the current name, the \"Queensland Law Society\".  In 1941, during difficult years when many lawyers were called to war, the society first engaged a full-time employee, Beryl Donkin, as secretary and chief administrative officer.   The society was enshrined by Act of Parliament in 1952.\nIn 1964 the society initiated the \"Queensland Law Society Symposium\".\nSee also\n*Bill Potts (lawyer)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.qls.com.au/Home Official page]"
