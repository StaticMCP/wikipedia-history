The Riigikogu — the Parliament of Estonia — elected Alar Karis to serve in the office and he was sworn in as the 6th president on 11 October 2021. The incumbent, Kersti Kaljulaid, was eligible to seek reelection to a second, and final, term but failed to gain the endorsement of at least 21 MPs, which is required in order for a candidate to register, as she was outspoken against some of the policies of the government, who thus denied her support.\nThe election, being one of an unopposed candidate (a first under the 1992 constitution), caused an outcry as it was compared with those held under the Soviet occupation of the country. Described as \"unethical\", it reignited previous calls for a reform of the electoral system, including direct election. Referencing the \"turmoil that surrounded the presidential selection process\" in his post election speech, Karis called for changes of the system to be examined by the Riigikogu, such as using an enlarged electoral college, facilitating the nomination of candidates or even using direct election.\nProcess\nBy law, the president of Estonia is indirectly elected. The Riigikogu has the task of electing the president in the first instance. If no candidate receives the required supermajority of two-thirds (68 votes out of 101), the president is selected by an electoral college consisting of MPs and representatives of local (municipal) governments. If the electoral college fails to achieve a supermajority as well, the process is to return to the parliament yet again.\nThe incumbent Kersti Kaljulaid served one term, and was eligible to be elected to a second consecutive term in office, but did not receive enough parliamentary nominations in order to stand as a candidate. In June 2021, Jüri Ratas announced a special session of the Riigikogu on 30 August, in order to begin the process of electing the president. Members of parliament were allowed to begin nominating candidates on 26 August.\nCandidates\nIndividuals must be nominated by one-fifth of the members of Riigikogu (21 MPs) in order to officially stand as candidates. Members of the Riigikogu may begin officially nominating candidates for the election on 26 August, while the nominations were publicly revealed on 29 August.\nNominated\nThe following individual received the mandated amount of nominations from at least 21 MPs.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!
