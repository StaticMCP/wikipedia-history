The president of the United States can establish a national monument by presidential proclamation, and the United States Congress can do so by legislation. The president's authority arises from the Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows the president to proclaim \"historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest\" as national monuments.\nConcerns about protecting mostly prehistoric Native American ruins and artifacts, collectively known as antiquities, on western federal lands prompted the legislation, which allowed the president to quickly preserve public land without waiting for legislation to pass through an unconcerned Congress. The ultimate goal was to protect all historic and prehistoric sites on U.S. federal lands, and it has resulted in designation of a wide variety of ecological, cultural and historical sites.\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt established the first national monument, Devils Tower in Wyoming, on September 24, 1906. He established 18 national monuments, although only nine still retain that designation. Eighteen presidents have created national monuments under the Antiquities Act since the program began; only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush did not. Bill Clinton created 19 and expanded three others.\nJimmy Carter protected vast parts of Alaska, proclaiming 15 national monuments, 7 of which were later promoted to national parks. President Barack Obama created or expanded 34 national monuments by proclamation, the most of any president, with over half a billion acres of public land and water protected.\nNational monuments are located in 33 states, Washington, D.C., the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Minor Outlying Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. California has the most national monuments, with 20, followed by Arizona with 19 and New Mexico with 13. At least seventy-nine national monuments protect places of natural significance, including nineteen primarily for their geological features, eight marine sites, and nine volcanic sites (two of which are designated \"National Volcanic Monuments\"). At least sixty-six national monuments primarily protect historic sites, including twenty-eight associated with Native Americans, eleven relating to African American history, and eleven forts. Four have been designated World Heritage Sites. With the variety of resource types there is significant variation in the size of national monuments; the median size is roughly . The five largest national monuments are all oceanic marine sites that protect waters and submerged lands where commercial fishing is prohibited.\nMany former national monuments have been redesignated as national parks or another status by Congress, while others have been transferred to state control or disbanded.\nManagement by federal agencies\nNine federal agencies in five departments manage the 138 current U.S. national monuments. Of these, 121 monuments are managed by a single agency, while 17 are co-managed by two agencies. Two of the NPS's national monuments, Grand Canyon–Parashant and Avi Kwa Ame, are not official units because they overlap with Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Management practices vary across agencies and sites according to their missions, the size or type of protected place, and legal authorization. Generally, hunting, fishing, and extraction of resources are prohibited.\nMonuments and memorials that were not designated by the U.S. government, such as the USS Maine National Monument, are not listed here.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Agency\n!Department\n!Co-managed\n!Total managed\n|-\n||National Park Service (NPS)\n|Interior\n| 3 with BLM, 1 with FWS, 1 with Army\n| 89\n|-\n||Bureau of Land Management (BLM)\n|Interior\n| 3 with NPS, 6 with USFS\n| 31\n|-\n||United States Forest Service (USFS)\n|Agriculture\n| 6 with BLM\n| 16\n|-\n||Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)\n|Interior\n| 5 with NOAA, 1 with NPS, 1 with DOE\n| 9\n|-\n|  |National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n|Commerce\n| 5 with FWS\n|5\n|-\n||Department of Energy (DOE)\n|Energy\n|1 with FWS\n|1\n|-\n||Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH)\n|Defense\n|\n| 1\n|-\n||United States Army\n|Defense\n|1 with NPS\n|2\n|-\n||United States Air Force (USAF)\n|Defense\n|\n| 1\n|-\n| (duplications)\n|\n|\n| (17)\n|- class=sortbottom\n| colspan=3|Total\n| 138\n|}\nList of national monuments\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-F\n!scope=\"col\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" |Location\n!scope=\"col\" |Agency\n!scope=\"col\";data-sort-type=\"number\" |Date established\n!scope=\"col\";data-sort-type=\"number\" |Area\n!Visitors (2018)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Admiralty Island\n| Alaska\n| USFS\n|\n|\n|\n| Occupying most of Admiralty Island, the 7th largest in the United States, this monument is part of Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska.
