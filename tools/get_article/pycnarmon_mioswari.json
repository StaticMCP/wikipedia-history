It is found in Papua New Guinea, where it has been recorded from Mioswar Island.\nThe wingspan is about 24&nbsp;mm. The forewings are white, with a small sooty black spot near the base of the cell and a larger round one at the end. There is a costal black spot before the apex, from which springs a pale transverse ochreous line reaching the inner margin. The hindwings are white, with a small dark spot near the base and a thin median line with a darker hind margin.\nReferences"
