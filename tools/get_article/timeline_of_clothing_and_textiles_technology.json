This includes the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, and manufacturing systems (technology).\nFibers and fabrics\nflowers]]\n* Research remains ongoing as to when people started wearing clothes.\n*c. 50,000 BC – A discovered twisted fibre (a 3-ply cord fragment) indicates the likely use of clothing, bags, nets and similar technology by Neanderthals in southeastern France.\n*c. 27000 BC – Impressions of textiles, basketry, and nets left on small pieces of hard clay in Europe.\n*c. 25000 BC – Venus figurines depicted with clothing.\n*c. 8000 BC – Evidence of flax cultivation in the Near East.\n*c. 6000 BC – Evidence of woven textiles used to wrap the dead at Çatalhöyük in Anatolia.\n*c. 3000 BC – Breeding of domesticated sheep with a wooly fleece rather than hair in the Near East.\n*c. 2500 BC – The Indus Valley civilisation cultivates cotton in the Indian subcontinent.\n*c. 1988 BC – Production of linen cloth in Ancient Egypt, along with other bast fibers including rush, reed, palm, and papyrus.\n*c. 1000 BC – Cherchen Man was laid to rest with a twill tunic and the earliest known sample of tartan fabric.\n*c. 200 AD – Earliest woodblock printing from China. Flowers in three colors on silk.\n*247 AD – Dura-Europos, a Roman outpost, is destroyed. Excavations of the city discovered early examples of naalebinding fabric.\n*11th century – Broadcloth first produced in the Duchy of Brabant (now Flanders).\n*1275 – Approximate date of a silk burial cushion knit in two colors found in the tomb of Spanish royalty.\n*1493 – The first available reference to lace is in a will by one of the ruling Milanese Sforza family.\n*1550-1600 – Armazine and Bombazine introduced for the first time in United Kingdom.\n*1590 – First reference to Cambric fabric.\n*1840 – Barathea developed as a cloth for mourning clothes.\n*1892 – Cross, Bevan & Beadle invent Viscose.\n*1938 – First commercial nylon fiber production by DuPont.
