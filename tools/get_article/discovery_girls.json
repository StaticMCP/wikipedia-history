Written “by girls, for girls,” the publication honestly addresses the issues faced by preteen girls. First published in 2000, the magazine had a circulation of 195,062 in 2012.\nHistory\nDiscovery Girls was founded in 2000 by Catherine Lee. As part of the process of creating the first issue, Lee selected twelve girls from local schools to provide input on what is important to them. Lee continued to use the approach. From 2000 to 2012, for each issue 12 girls were selected from various states. The girls attended a two-day photo shoot and provided ideas and content for the issue. In 2012, this switched to a once-a-year camp for 36 girls in the US and Canada that would provide images and content for a year's issues.\nMagazine features\nMost of the regular features contain content sent in by readers.
