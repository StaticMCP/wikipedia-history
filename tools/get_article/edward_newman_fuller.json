He attended Merchant Taylors School where he featured in the School first fifteen rugby squad in 1906–07, but where he was more noted for his prowess as a cricketer playing in the School XI in 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906 (as captain) and 1907 (as captain). He left school in 1907 and became a scholar of Madgalen College Cambridge.\nRugby union\nFuller played his rugby for his school's old boys club, Old Merchant Taylors' and was captain of the OMTFC in 1910-11 and 1911–12. Although he was never selected to play rugby for England, he was selected to tour with the Combined British on the 1910 tour to Argentina where he played in what Argentina count as their first test match.\nCareer and later life\nIn the First World War he joined the Royal Flying Corps. He served in France and Egypt amongst other theatres. On 25 January 1913 he became a Second Lieutenant, and eventually became a major during the war. On 21 March, at Jesmond Parish Church, the now Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Newman Fuller, R.F.C., was married to Dorothy Kate, the eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Legg, of Paul's Dean, Salisbury. He died in September 1969 in Hailsham, Sussex, England.\nReferences\n*Photo taken on 15 October 1912 contained within: Royal Aero Club.
