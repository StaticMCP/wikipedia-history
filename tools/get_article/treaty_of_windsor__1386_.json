With the victory at the Battle of Aljubarrota, assisted by English archers, John I was recognised as the undisputed King of Portugal, putting an end to the interregnum of the 1383–1385 Crisis. The Treaty of Windsor established a pact of mutual support.\nCopies are preserved at the Torre do Tombo National Archive in Lisbon and The National Archives in London.\nWinston Churchill, speaking in the House of Commons in 1943, described the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance as \"an alliance without parallel in world history.\" The historian Matthew Winslett says, \"This treaty has been the cornerstone of both nations' relations with each other ever since.\" Still in effect today, it is the longest-lasting diplomatic treaty in recorded history.\nSee also\n*Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373\n*\n*Timeline of Portuguese history\n*\n*\n*Operation Alacrity\nReferences\nBibliography\n*[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029394365&a=KCountryProfile&aid=1019061813652 Country profile of Portugal],  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office website\n*\n*"
