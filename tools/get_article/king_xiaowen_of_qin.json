He is also known as Lord Anguo (安國君), based on his title before his kingship.\nLife\nXiaowen was the second son of King Zhaoxiang of Qin and Queen Tang, and grandson of Queen Dowager Xuan.\nHe was the king of Qin for less than one year, and died three days after his coronation.\nVarious theories explaining his short reign have been proposed. The most accepted theory is that he was very old when he ascended to the throne, as his father had ruled for over 50 years.\nHowever, there is a conspiracy theory that Lü Buwei poisoned the king, or at least hastened his death, to put the next king, King Zhuangxiang of Qin, onto the throne.\nFamily\nQueens:\n* Queen Dowager Huayang, of the Xiong lineage of the Mi clan of Chu (; 296–230 BC), a royal of Chu by birth\n* Queen Dowager Xia, of the Xia lineage (; 300–240 BC), the mother of Crown Prince Yiren\nSons:\n* Prince Zixi (; ?–?), half-brother of Yiren\n* Crown Prince Yiren (; 281–247 BC), renamed Zichu (); ruled as King Zhuangxiang of Qin from 250–247 BC\nReferences"
