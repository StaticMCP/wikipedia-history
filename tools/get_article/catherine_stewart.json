She was an ardent suffragette, and a member of the Theosophical Society. At Labour's 1938 conference Stewart stated \"I am not speaking as a feminist but as a woman who wishes to stand shoulder to shoulder with our men\" in her acceptance to stand as a party candidate.\nPolitical career\n|end=1943\n|term=26th\n|electorate=\n|party=New Zealand Labour Party\n}}\nShe won the Wellington West electorate in the , when she defeated long-standing MP Robert Wright. She was the second woman to be elected to Parliament after Elizabeth McCombs and first to enter parliament as a result of a general election. Stewart saw herself as the \"Member for Everywoman\" and felt obliged to concentrate on issues in the interests of women, children and those in need. In 1941, she was joined by Mary Dreaver, also of the Labour party, bringing the total of female MPs to two.\nStewart was defeated in the next election held in . This was seen as a result of public vilification due to two of her sons, who were conscientious objectors during World War II. Later she was unsuccessfully nominated for a position on the New Zealand Legislative Council by Labour’s Karori branch in her old electorate.\nIn both 1941 and 1944 she unsuccessfully stood for the Wellington City Council on a Labour Party ticket. Both elections saw all Labour candidates defeated.\nAfter the death of her husband Charles in 1948, she returned to live in Glasgow, where she died on 2 April 1957.\nReferences\n*\n*Women in Parliamentary Life 1970-1990: Hocken Lecture 1993 by Marilyn Waring, page 35-36 (Hocken Library, University of Otago, 1994)"
