The company provides janitorial services and commercial cleaning services for public spaces such as offices, retails spaces, hotels, and stadiums.\nHistory\nThe company was founded by James Cavanaugh, Jr., in 1969. In 2001, it was the title sponsor of the NASCAR event at the Texas Motor Speedway now known as the SRS Distribution 250. In 2002, Cavanaugh was involved in a scandal when his girlfriend, Claire Robinson, died of a cocaine overdose while on vacation with him at his Caribbean holiday home. In 2019, a court found that a settlement payment of $2.3 million he had made to avoid negative publicity for the company and liability arising from Robinson's death was not a deductible business expense for his S corporation.\nCurrent organization\nJani-King's corporate offices are in Addison, Texas.\nFrom its corporate headquarters, and through regional support offices in local markets, Jani-King provides its franchise owners additional training and certification programs for servicing hotels and hospitals. In August 2012, Jani-King partnered with a sports team, the Buffalo Bills.\nSee also\n* List of cleaning companies\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
