Barker, as the new prime minister, transforms Britain into a republic and dismantles the monarchy.\nIn Hellebore Close (aptly known as \"Hell Close\" to its longtime residents), the new home of the Royal Family, they learn to cope with the normal day of ordinary people. The Queen – now called Mrs. Windsor – is not allowed to take all her beloved corgis to her new home in \"Hell Close\", with only Harris with her, and Charles learning that horses cannot be kept in a council house garden.\nThe Queen is visited by a social worker, but refuses to let her in. She learns how to use a zip and buttons, and that five hours of waiting to see a doctor in an ordinary hospital is not unusual when she injures herself opening tinned beef; Princess Margaret mistakes the injured Queen for a dead one and believes they're all going to be killed. The Queen learns that living on a small pensioner's income is difficult, and that she must organise her budget to fit.\nNonetheless, the Queen quickly learns to cope with the situation, and later does not wish to return to Buckingham Palace due to the duties that would await her there, should she return to her former royal status.\nHer husband, Prince Philip, conversely struggles with the situation, refusing to eat, share a bed with his wife, and wishing he were anywhere but in Hellebore Close.\nCharles, former Prince of Wales, discovers his great love for gardening. While he and his wife Diana, Princess of Wales, begin affairs with their neighbours, their children, William and Harry, do not recognise the situation they are in, thinking the whole thing to be an adventure.\nLater, Charles is imprisoned and sentenced for attacking a police officer, a crime he did not actually commit. His sister, Princess Anne takes up with a local handyman. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, is briefly mentioned to be serving aboard a Royal Navy submarine under the Arctic ice cap.\nTheir neighbours, who are at first sceptical, eventually include the ex-royal family in their community, and help them as much as their own circumstances allow. Although the Queen Mother is the oldest of the ex-royals, she learns very fast how to cope with the new situation, but even in the poor circumstances of Hellebore Close, cannot stop herself from betting on horses. Her death shakes the whole neighbourhood and everyone takes part in her cheap but solemn funeral. A disgruntled fishmonger and his wife start a campaign to \"Bring Our Monarch Back\", under the acronym 'B.O.M.B'.\nJack Barker and his so-called \"Kitchen Cabinet\" make election promises to voters that would cause great expense, such as promising to raise pensions and renew schools, and soon get into trouble with foreign creditors. After talks with the Japanese emperor, Barker announces that Britain is to become part of the Japanese Empire, with himself as Governor-General. In return, all repayments to Japan are to be suspended indefinitely. This agreement is sealed by the marriage of Edward, the Queen's youngest son, to Sayako, daughter of the Emperor.\nIt is then revealed the events were a nightmare. The Queen wakes to find that the Conservatives have won the election instead, as indeed actually happened, and John Major has remained prime minister.\nIn 2006, a sequel, Queen Camilla, was published. The novel ignores the revelation that Hellebore Close was all a dream, and begins with the royal family as still living there, with Jack Barker still in power.\nCharacters\nRoyal Family\n* Queen Elizabeth II\n* Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\n* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\n* Prince Charles, Prince of Wales\n* Diana, Princess of Wales\n* Prince William\n* Prince Harry\n* Princess Anne, Princess Royal\n* Peter Phillips\n* Zara Phillips\n* Prince Edward.
