Its history begins in 851 with Erispoe's claim to kingship. In 856, Erispoe was murdered and succeeded by his cousin Salomon.\nThe kingdom fell into a period of turmoil caused by Norse invasions and a succession dispute between Salomon's murderers: Gurvand and Pascweten. Pascweten's brother, Alan, called the Great, was the third and last to be recognized as King of Brittany. After his death, Brittany fell under Norse occupation.\nWhen Alan Twistedbeard, Alan the Great's grandson, reconquered Brittany in 939, Brittany became a sovereign duchy until its union with France in 1532.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn 383, Magnus Maximus was proclaimed emperor by his soldiers in Britain. He promptly invaded Gaul and deposed Emperor Gratian. During the invasion, he instructed some of his soldiers to occupy the western part of the Armorican peninsula and expel soldiers loyal to Gratian. The House of Ingelger confirm this event in their origin story.\nAt the end of the Antiquity period, additional Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain (5th-7th centuries), settled in the same region. At some stage, it was renamed Brittany (\"little Britain\").\nAs a result of these settlements, Celtic culture was revived in Gallo-Roman Armorica and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region, namely Cornouaille, Domnonée and Broërec.\nImperial emissary\nFrom 801 to 837, the adjacent Frankish Empire made several unsuccessful attempts to subdue the Breton tribes. In order to bring Brittany into the Empire's sphere of influence, Louis the Pious appointed Nominoe, a noble Briton, head of the region. Titled missus imperatoris (\"Imperial emissary\") by the Emperor, he was in charge of the administration of the region on the latter's behalf.\nKingdom of Brittany\nin the 9th and 10th centuries in Brittany. The location of the supposed or attested Viking camps is not validated by any reliable document, nor any archaeological proof of their presence on the site, except perhaps at Péran and more certainly at Landévennec.]]\nBattle of Ballon\nFollowing the death of Louis the Pious and taking advantage of the Norman invasions destabilizing the Frankish Empire, Nominoe defeated Frankish troops at the Battle of Ballon (845). The peace treaty that followed allowed Nominoe to increase his autonomy from Charles the Bald, a son of Louis the Pious. In 850, the Bretons briefly occupied the Frankish Breton March, but following Nominoe's untimely death they retreated to their historical lands.\nBattle of Jengland and the First Breton King\nSeeking revenge, Charles the Bald invaded Brittany with an army drawn from both the western and eastern parts of the Frankish empire. Erispoe, Nominoe's son and successor, intercepted Charles at the Battle of Jengland (851). At the Treaty of Angers signed the same year, the Pays de Retz entered Erispoe's realm. As the Bretons decisively defeated the Franks, Brittany became effectively independent of the Frankish Empire, making Erispoe the first king of Brittany. In 856, the Kingdom of Brittany and the Frankish Empire allied themselves to counter the Norman invasions. But Erispoe was murdered the same year by his cousin Salomon who took the throne of Brittany and allied himself with the Normans to capture the Frankish city of Le Mans.\nThe second Breton King\nCharles the Bald bought peace with the Bretons by giving away the provinces of Cotentin (863) and Maine (867). In 874, Salomon was murdered in a conspiracy involving Pascweten and Gurvand, but a civil war ensued between the latter pair. Both claimants died in 876, but war continued between their respective successors Alan (Pascweten's brother) and Judicael (Gurvand's son).\nThe third Breton King\nIn a temporary truce, Alan and Judicael allied themselves to counter Norman attacks. In one of those attacks in Questembert in 888, Judicael died and Alan became king of Brittany as Alan I.\nEnd of the Kingdom\nAlan died in 907 and was succeeded, after a disputed succession, by Gourmaëlon who did not claim the title of king. Little is known about his reign because Norse raids increased dramatically, destabilizing the region further. It was probably during one of these attacks that Gourmaëlon died in 913.\nThe Norse Occupation\nFrom 919, Brittany was completely occupied by the Norsemen, monasteries and cities were looted and many Bretons fled to neighbouring countries.\nThe Breton reconquer\nIn 935, Alan Twistedbeard (Alan I's grandson), who had fled back to England after a failed insurrection against the Norsemen a few years earlier, disembarked once more on the shores of Brittany in order to reconquer his domain. By 937, he had recovered most of Brittany and the Norsemen retreated to their stronghold of Trans-la-Forêt. In 939, a combined army of Frankish and Breton soldiers attacked the fortress and eliminated the Norse threat in Brittany.\nFealty to the Franks\nWith his domain ruined by decades of occupation and war, Alan Twistedbeard was not in a position to restore the kingship of Brittany and paid tribute as duke of Brittany to king Louis IV of France in 942.\nPetty and regional kings\n*Judicael (–657) - Breton high king, king of Domnonée; united the Breton kingdoms of Domnonée and Broërec; recognized Dagobert I and Eligius\n*Morman (reigned 814–818)- first ruler named King of Brittany by the Breton nobles upon the death of Charlemagne in 814, whom he had served as a vassal\n* Period of Frankish rule under Louis the Pious (819–822) - Morman rebelled against Frankish rule but was defeated by Louis the Pious.
