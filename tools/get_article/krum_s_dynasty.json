During this period Bulgaria adopted Christianity, reached its greatest territorial extent and triggered a golden age of culture and literature. Under the patronage of these monarchs Bulgaria became the birthplace of the Cyrillic alphabet; Old Bulgarian became the lingua franca'' of much of Eastern Europe and it came to be known as Old Church Slavonic. As a result of the victory in the Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927 the Byzantine Empire recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian rulers and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an independent Patriarchate.\nThe last representative of the dynasty, Tsar Roman (r. 977–991), was succeeded by Tsar Samuel (r. 997–1014) of the Cometopuli dynasty, upon the former's death in Byzantine captivity in 997, after spending six years in prison. Samuel had made the last member of Krum's dynasty a nominal head of state in 977, in order to avoid conflict.\nHistory\nKrum was originally a Bulgar chieftain in Pannonia. His background and the events around his accession as Khan of Bulgaria are unknown. It has been speculated that he was a descendant of Khan Kubrat (c. 632–665) and that his rule marked the return of the Dulo clan, the first dynasty of Bulgaria.\nMembers\nMonarchs\n*Krum, khan (r. 803–814)\n*Omurtag, khan (r. 814–831)\n*Malamir, khan (r. 831–836)\n*Presian I, khan (r. 836–852)\n*Boris I, khan, knyaz (r. 852–889)\n*Vladimir-Rasate, knyaz (r.&nbsp;889–893)\n*Simeon I, knyaz, tsar (r. 893–927)\n*Peter I, tsar (r. 927–969)\n*Boris II, tsar (r. 969–971)\n*Roman, tsar (r. 977–991)\nFamily tree\n*Krum\n**Omurtag\n***Enravota\n***Zvinitsa\n****Presian I\n*****Boris I\n******Vladimir\n******Gavrail\n******Simeon I\n*******Michael\n*******Peter I\n********Boris II\n********Roman\n********Plenimir\n*******Ivan\n*******Benjamin (also known as Boyan the Mage)\n******Evpraksiya\n******Anna\n***Malamir\nReferences\nSources\n*"
