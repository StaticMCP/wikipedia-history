As the U.S. president is both head of state and head of government, these visits have taken many forms, ranging from formal state visits to official visits, working visits, or private visits (or, as in the case of Franklin D. Roosevelt, personal vacations).\nSince the first presidential visit, made by Warren G. Harding in 1923 (just a few weeks before his death), Canada has become one of the most common presidential international travel destinations. Since the Franklin Roosevelt administration, only Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter never visited Canada while in office. Eight presidents have addressed a joint session of the Parliament of Canada, with Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan both speaking twice.\nTable of visits\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Date(s)\n!Location(s)\n!Key details\n|-\n|Warren G.

President Franklin Roosevelt visited there twice: He vacationed at Bay of Islands and Bonne Bay on August 17 to 20, 1939. Two years later, between August 9 and 12, he returned to Newfoundland, ostensibly for another vacation. In actuality, he conferred with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill aboard HMS Prince of Wales and USS Augusta in Placentia Bay. At the conclusion of the conference, they issued the Atlantic Charter.\nSee also\n* Canada–United States relations\n* Foreign policy of the United States\n* Foreign relations of the United States\nReferences"
