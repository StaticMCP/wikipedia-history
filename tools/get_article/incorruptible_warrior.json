The player takes on the role of protagonist who battles corrupt government officials as well as their children and mistresses. The game received financial sponsoring from the Chinese Communist Party Disciplinary Committee of the Haishu district in Ningbo city.\nJust weeks after its launch, the game attracted so many users that its servers crashed and it had to be taken offline for upgrades.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://zonaeuropa.com/200708.brief.htm#001 The Incorruptible Warrior] - English translation of a Southern Metro Daily article on the game"
