It serves stations between its namesake town, Warminster, and Center City Philadelphia. Half of the route is shared by other lines, including the Lansdale/Doylestown Line, West Trenton Line, Fox Chase Line, Chestnut Hill East Line, and Manayunk/Norristown Line. All trains continue as part of the Airport Line with the exception of some weekday trains that terminate at 30th Street Station, Thorndale, or Trenton Transit Center.\nRoute\nThe Warminster Line uses the SEPTA Main Line between Center City and Glenside station, where it branches off onto the Warminster Branch to Hatboro and Warminster. The tracks continue past Warminster to Ivyland and eventually to New Hope, where the New Hope Railroad runs heritage excursion trains.\nThe Warminster Line becomes a single-track line just north of Ardsley, but was once double-tracked as far north as Roslyn, the original northbound track being removed in 2010. A passing siding exists north of Willow Grove. There is also a second storage track at the Hatboro station and the line becomes double-tracked again as it approaches the terminus at Warminster station.\nHistory\nwas the extent of electrified service until 1974]]\nThe Warminster Line is a continuation of the Reading Company's suburban services over the Warminster Branch. The line was built between 1872 and 1874 and electrified as far as Hatboro in 1931. Passenger service beyond Hatboro ended in 1952. The Reading extended electrification and suburban service to Warminster on July29, 1974.\nWith the Reading's final bankruptcy in 1976 Conrail took over the operation of the trains and ownership of the branch. The Warminster Branch was conveyed to SEPTA in 1979; SEPTA took over operation of the trains in 1983. A train crash occurred on July1, 2006, in Abington Township injuring 38 passengers and 6 crew members.\nBeginning in 1984 the route was designated R2 Warminster as part of SEPTA's diametrical reorganization of its lines. Warminster Line trains operated through the city center to the Wilmington/Newark Line (then Marcus Hook) on the ex-Pennsylvania side of the system. The R-number naming system was dropped on July25, 2010.  the majority of Warminster trains continue on to the Airport Line, though some weekday trains terminate at 30th Street Station, Thorndale, or Trenton Transit Center.\nOn April18, 2016, SEPTA launched positive train control on the Warminster Line, the first Regional Rail line to use the signal system which will enhance safety.\nPotential for expansion beyond Warminster\nIn a 1991 report, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission ranked the line between Warminster and New Hope as having \"medium potential\" for reuse based on projected growth in population and employment in the region. It noted that SEPTA considered the line a \"long range transit opportunity corridor.\"\nStations\n, which serves as the terminus of the Warminster Line]]\nThe Warminster Line includes the following stations north of the Center City Commuter Connection; stations indicated with gray background area closed.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Zone\n!Location\n!Station\n!Miles (km)from\n!Date opened\n! class=\"nowrap\"|Connections / notes\n|-\n|rowspan=1|C\n|Temple University\n|\n|\n|\n| SEPTA Regional Rail: all lines\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1\n|Nicetown–Tioga,Philadelphia\n|\n|\n|\n| SEPTA Regional Rail:     SEPTA City Bus:  SEPTA Trackless Trolley:\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Olney-Oak Lane,Philadelphia\n|-bgcolor=dfdfdf\n|Logan\n|\n|\n|Discontinued on October 4, 1992\n|-bgcolor=dfdfdf\n|Tabor\n|\n|\n|Closed 1992\n|-\n|Fern Rock T.C.\n|\n|\n| SEPTA Regional Rail:  :  SEPTA City Bus:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2\n|Melrose Park\n|\n|\n|\n| SEPTA Regional Rail:\n|-\n|Elkins Park\n|Elkins Park\n|\n|May 14, 1899\n| SEPTA Regional Rail:   SEPTA City Bus:\n|-\n|rowspan=9|3\n|Jenkintown\n|\n|\n|\n| SEPTA Regional Rail:   SEPTA City Bus:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Glenside\n|\n|\n|\n| SEPTA Regional Rail:  SEPTA City Bus:\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Roslyn\n|\n|\n|\n| SEPTA City Bus:\n|-\n|Abington\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Willow Grove\n|\n|\n|\n| SEPTA City Bus:\n|-bgcolor=dfdfdf\n|Upper Moreland Twp.\n|\n|\n|\n|Closed November 10, 1996\n|-\n|Hatboro\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Warminster\n|\n|\n|July 29, 1974\n| SEPTA City Bus:  TMA Bucks: Rushbus\n|}\nRidership\nBetween FY 2013–FY 2019 yearly ridership on the Warminster Line ranged between 2.3 and 2.7 million before collapsing during the COVID-19 pandemic.}}\n}}\nNotes\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*  }}\nExternal links\n* [https://schedules.septa.org/current/WAR.pdf SEPTA – Warminster Line schedule]\n*[http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20INTRO%20Jul%2004.wd.pdf The Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society]"
