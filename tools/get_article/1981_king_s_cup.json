Arumugam. China was represented by the August 1 team, while Indonesia entered their provincial champions Semarang. The match between Malaysia and Semarang was abandoned after 15 minutes due to heavy rain with the score at nil.\nGroup 2 comprised India, along with the representative sides North Korean Army, Polonia Warszawa, South Korea Army, Wollongong from Australia, and Thailand B.\nGroup stage\nGroup 1\n|team2=AUG|name_AUG= August 1\n|team3=SIN|name_SIN=\n|team4=PAK|name_PAK=\n|team5=IDN|name_IDN= PSIS
