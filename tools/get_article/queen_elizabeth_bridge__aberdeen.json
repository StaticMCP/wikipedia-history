It carries a dual carriageway (part of the A956 route) and pavements on either side.\nHistory\nIn 1978, Grampian Regional Council approached the Scottish Development Department with a view to constructing the bridge as a replacement for the Wellington Suspension Bridge. The estimated cost at the time was £2 million.\nDuring construction, the bridge was referred to as the New Wellington Bridge. The bridge opened to traffic in December 1983. In April 1984, the bridge was named Queen Elizabeth Bridge. The bridge was officially opened by Elizabeth I on 10 August 1984.\nStructure\nThe bridge is  long and has three spans.\nReferences"
