Launched in 2011, MyRepublic currently operates in Singapore and licenses its platform to operators in Brunei and Indonesia through its joint venture with Sinar Mas.\nMyRepublic Group Limited is a group of companies consisting of MyRepublic which offers broadband, phone, and cloud services and MyRepublic Digital offering digital platform services.\nHistory\nMyRepublic was founded by Malcolm Rodrigues, a former Vice President of StarHub International and Wholesale; KC Lai, a former StarHub Senior VP of Consumer Sales; and Greg Mittman, previously a lead of Alcatel-Lucent's National Broadband Network Team, on 25 July 2011.\nMyRepublic became a licensed telecommunications carrier in Singapore in October 2011 and signed the Interconnection Agreement with the National Broadband Company in Singapore shortly after. A soft launch of MyRepublic took place in mid-December 2011.\nOn 16 February 2012, MyRepublic officially launched its operations in Singapore. By the end of 2012, MyRepublic had 450 resellers, 10,000 subscribers, and more than S$5 million in revenue. Rodrigues attributed the company's growth to its \"thin operator model,\" which is unburdened by costly legacy infrastructure.\nIn January 2014, MyRepublic expanded into New Zealand. It also launched its 1 Gbit/s service in the same month in Singapore. Later in May, the company received an investment of S$4.4 million from Indonesian energy company Dian Swastatika Sentosa, part of Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas.

In 2012, the company launched in Singapore with fibre broadband Internet plans offering speeds of up to 150&nbsp;Mbit/s and the country's first no-contract term Internet plans.\nIn February 2012, MyRepublic rolled out its GAMER fibre broadband packages, becoming Singapore's first Internet service provider to offer fibre broadband plans specifically catered towards gamers. MyRepublic is most well known for its GAMER fibre broadband package, which features lower latency for popular games.\nIn May 2015, MyRepublic launched the first-ever 1&nbsp;Gbit/s no-contract fibre broadband plan in Singapore. The plan targets users who want greater flexibility and are unwilling to commit to a 12—or 24-month contract.\nAccording to the internet analysis firm's Q4 Speedtest, in September 2021, MyRepublic became the country's fastest provider, recording a Speed Score of 258.01.\nIn February 2024, MyRepublic unveiled its 10Gbit/s home broadband trial offerings for households looking for speedier in-home connectivity.\nEnterprise Connectivity\nThe company also offers fibre broadband, voice, and managed Wi-Fi services to business customers nationwide.\nIn 2016, it launched MySDN, its first enterprise connectivity service, available to customers across the region, including Singapore, Indonesia, and New Zealand.\nIn 2022, MyRepublic announced the launch of Ignite, a brand-new suite of enterprise ICT (Information and Communications Technology) specialized for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore.\nMyRepublic Digital\nMyRepublic Digital is a spin-off company of MyRepublic that aims to simplify and increase the productivity of digital transformation for telcos and aspiring digital brands worldwide.

HetNet is a new wireless system that leveraged NBN as part of a mobile network, allowing mobile phone users to hop across networks to minimize surfing slowdowns or disruptions automatically. As part of the trial, MyRepublic gave out 1,000 free SIM cards with unlimited 4G data to trial participants in the coverage area.\nIn September 2015, the company submitted its bid for the New Entrant Spectrum Auction (NESA) and two other companies - Australian telco TPG Telecom and Singapore start-up airYotta. Of the three, only MyRepublic and TPG were pre-qualified to participate in the NESA.\nMyRepublic participated in the NESA in December 2016 but ultimately exited the auction at S$102.5 million and ceded the license to TPG, citing concerns that bidding higher would not make sense for its business case.\nIn May 2017, reports emerged that MyRepublic was looking for private equity backing to bid for Singaporean telecommunications company M1. This would allow it to get back into the Singapore Telco market despite losing the fourth telco license. In a press conference later that year, MyRepublic confirmed the report but added that it was no longer interested in buying M1 and would seek to offer mobile services as a virtual network operator (MVNO) instead.\nMobile services offering\nIn May 2018, MyRepublic announced that it had formed a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) agreement with local telco StarHub, enabling it to offer services using StarHub's mobile infrastructure.

For a \"boundless\" data offering, the plans allowed customers to continue to consume data at reduced speeds once they hit the data limit of their plans without additional charges.\nIn October 2020, MyRepublic and M1 Limited (M1) signed an agreement for MyRepublic to deliver an enhanced suite of mobile services as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) using M1's mobile network infrastructure.\nIn January 2023, MyRepublic announced its foray into 5G and introduced its 5G plan offerings using StarHub's 5G Standalone/4G/3G infrastructure. MyRepublic's 4G plan offerings will continue using M1's 4G/3G infrastructure.\nGigatown competition\nIn 2017, MyRepublic launched the \"Gigatown\" Competition to connect Australia's first town to consumer-grade 1&nbsp;Gbit/s gigabit service. MyRepublic wanted to demonstrate the benefits of ultra-fast next-generation fiber and the benefits it could deliver to consumers and small businesses. MyRepublic ran the Gigatown petition and gathered over 6,000 responses from individuals who expressed their feelings towards how they felt about their current internet speeds. MyRepublic began offering their 1&nbsp;Gbit/s speed tier packages to Wollongong at A$129/month with unlimited data as part of their Gigatown Competition. At the end of 2017, MyRepublic expanded and launched NBN Small Business products to market.\nMyRepublic announced to its customers on 24 January 2023 that it would be exiting the Australian fixed broadband market and transferring customers to Superloop.\nMyRepublic Indonesia\nIn mid-2014, Sinar Mas, through its subsidiary Sunshine Network Pte. Ltd., invested approximately SGD 19.63 million in MyRepublic Limited, a telecommunications company based in Singapore. As a result of this capital injection, Sinar Mas acquired a 21.5% ownership stake in MyRepublic Singapore. This strategic investment was followed by the launch of MyRepublic's operations in Indonesia in April 2015. The initial service coverage included key urban areas such as Jabodetabek (Jakarta metropolitan area), Semarang, Palembang, Surabaya, and Malang.  The company operates under PT Eka Mas Republik, a subsidiary of PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa Tbk, which is part of the Sinar Mas.\nUtilizing Fiber to the Home (FTTH) technology, MyRepublic Indonesia delivers high-speed, unlimited broadband services without Fair Usage Policy (FUP) restrictions.
