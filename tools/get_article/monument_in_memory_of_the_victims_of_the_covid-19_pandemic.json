It is located in the administrative neighbourhood of Jerónimos of the district of Retiro. Made of black steel, it consists of a circle that is almost 2 m in diameter, and which rests on a prism. On the circular piece is the Spanish inscription \"Vuestra llama nunca se apagará en nuestro corazón\" (translation: Your flame will never go out in our hearts).

Originally, it was fueled with propane cylinders, which were later replaced with gas, to keep it permanent.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
