A professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), he is currently serving as Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education) and Professor at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and has held leadership roles such as department chair (2000–2023) and Associate Dean of Engineering (2013–2019). His work has earned fellowships from the ACM, IEEE, and the International Neural Network Society.\nEducation\nKing completed a Bachelor of Science in Engineering and Applied Science at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1984. He pursued graduate studies at the University of Southern California (USC), earning a Master of Science (1987) and a Doctor of Philosophy (1993) in computer science. His doctoral research focused on simulating biological neural networks for motion detection, working with Michael A. Arbib, Christoph von der Malsburg, and Irving Biederman, at the University of Southern California (USC).\nCareer\nKing joined CUHK in 1993, rising from assistant professor to chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. From 2010 to 2012, he worked at AT&T Labs Research on big data applications and later taught at the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting professor. He was also a Member of the Technical Staff at the AT&T Labs Research from 2010 to 2012 working on Big Data and data science-related projects.\nHe served as the Associate Dean (Education) of the Engineering Faculty at CUHK from August 2013 to July 2019. He also served as the Chair of the Department of Computer Science from August 2000 to July 2023. He founded CUHK’s Machine Intelligence and Social Computing Lab in 2006 and became the inaugural director of the ELearning Innovation and Technology (ELITE) Centre in 2017, promoting digital education tools.\nNotable projects under his leadership include:\n* [https://veriguide1.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/portal/page/index.jsp VeriGuide] (2005–present): A plagiarism-detection system to uphold academic integrity.\n* [https://keep.edu.hk/ KEEP] (2014–present): A platform supporting MOOCs across Greater China.\nAwards and Honors\n# ACM Fellow (2024)\n# IEEE Fellow (2019)\n# INNS Fellow (2021)\n# AAIA Fellow (2022)\n# HKIE Fellow\n# Lee Woo Sing College Fellow\n# Apple Distinguished Educator\n# World’s Top 2% Scientists by Stanford University (September 2022)\n# ACM WSDM Test of Time Award (2022)\n# ACM SIGIR Test of Time Award (2020)\n# ACM CIKM Test of Time Award (2019)\n# 2021 INNS Dennis Gabor Award for work in Neural Engineering for Social Computing\n# 2020 APNNS Outstanding Achievement Award\nLeadership\n# Vice-President, ACM SIGWEB (2023–present)\n# Vice-President of Conference, WebConf Steering Committee (2022–present)\n# Former President of INNS (2019–2020)\n# Executive Committee member, Hong Kong High Performance Computing Association (HKHPC) (2024–present)\n# General Co-Chair, WWW2020\n# General Co-Chair, RecSys 2013\n# General Co-Chair, ASONAM 2012\nRecent publications\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSelected Award-Winning Publications\n# [ICONIP2023 Best Student Paper Award Finalist] Xiangli Yang, Xinglin Pan, Irwin King, Zenglin Xu: Generalized Category Discovery with Clustering Assignment Consistency.
