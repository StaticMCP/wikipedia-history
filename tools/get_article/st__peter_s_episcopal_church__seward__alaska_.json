The first Episcopal services in Seward were held in 1904 by a priest from Valdez. The church building was constructed between 1905 and 1906 and was consecrated on April 1, 1906, by the Rt. Rev. Peter Trimble Rowe, the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Alaska. The interior of the church is noted for the 1925 reredos of Christ's Resurrection and Ascension which was done by Dutch artist Jan Van Empel.\nThe church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nSt. Peter's is still an active Episcopal parish.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.stpeters-seward.org/ St. Peter's Episcopal Church website]\n*[http://www.stpeters-seward.org/reredos.html Recent color photo of the reredos]\n*[http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/cdmg10&CISOPTR=205&REC=2&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=1440&DMHEIGHT=2000 1930s photo by Sylvia Sexton: Inside the Episcopal church showing the painting of the Resurrection that Jan van Emple did for the reredos of the church]\n*"
