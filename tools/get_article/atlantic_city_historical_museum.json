The museum was opened near the Atlantic City Art Center and displays 150 years of the city's history including many photos from Al Gold, Atlantic City's official photographer from 1939 to 1964. The museum also contains a life-sized Mr. Peanut, posters displaying the city's golden era, relics from old eras and a documentary showcasing the most unique seaside resorts. Since, Miss America was first hosted at the Garden Pier, the museum also contains numerous old Miss America dresses.\nIn March 2016, the original location closed after the Garden Pier was sold to Philadelphia-based developer Bart Blatstein. As of 2019, both the Atlantic City Historical Museum and the Atlantic City Art Center moved to the Jim Whelan Boardwalk Hall and is now a part of the Atlantic City Experience.\nFurther reading\n*\nReferences"
