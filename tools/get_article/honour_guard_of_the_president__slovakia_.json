In addition to being and honor guard for the leadership of the Slovak Socialist Republic, it also performed guard services for the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Government of Czechoslovakia. After the establishment of the Slovak Republic on New Years Day in 1993, the battalion was transformed into the Castle Guard Regiment, which provided a public duties detachment which would become a separate unit on 1 March 1993. The battalion was transferred to the Primate's Palace on November 24, 1993, and was moved again to the Grassalkovich Palace in September 1996, where it currently provides guard duties.\nUniform and weapons\n]]\nThe uniform of the company has been employed since June 2003. The uniform is based on a uniform of Slovak volunteers in the 1840s, which includes the Slovak tricolor. The uniform also features elements of Slovak folk art, such as a hat with a plume and a cord ornament. The uniform was designed by Ľubica Jarjabková and Helena Jurikovičová. Officers of the Honor Guard are armed with a 985-mm-long ceremonial sword. The blade is made of stainless steel, and has a leather-covered scabbard. Soldiers of the battalion (mostly NCOs) are for ceremonial occasions armed with a 1080&nbsp;mm flintlock rifle with steel barrel and a bayonet.\nSee also\n*Military Music Band of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic\nReferences"
