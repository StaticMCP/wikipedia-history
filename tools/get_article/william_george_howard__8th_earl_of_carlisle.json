Her mother was the daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Georgiana Spencer (the eldest daughter of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer).\nHoward was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.\nCareer\nCarlisle was Rector of Londesborough (a living in the gift of the Earl of Londesborough) in the East Riding of Yorkshire from 1832 for more than forty years until 1877, although from 1866, due to Lord Howard's mental incapacity, his duties were performed by his replacement.\nHe succeeded to the title  on 5 December 1864 on the death of his elder brother George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, who never married. On his death, the title passed to his nephew George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
