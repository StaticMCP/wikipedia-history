The Penny Lane ward was created as a single-member ward from the western part of the former Church ward and a part of the former Greenbank ward. The ward boundaries follow Smithdown Road, Allerton Road, Rose Lane and the West Coast Main Line. The ward includes, and is named for, Penny Lane made famous by the Beatles single of the same name.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
