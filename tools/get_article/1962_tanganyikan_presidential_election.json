They were the first elections following independence the previous year and the decision to form a republic. Julius Nyerere, leader of the ruling Tanganyika African National Union and incumbent Prime Minister won easily with 98.15% of the vote.\nThe vote share of more than 98% for Nyerere remains to this day the highest percentage of votes obtained by any candidate in Tanzania, even though it was ironically the only election in which he faced a rival. No further multi-party elections were held until 1995.\nResults\nThere were around 1.8 million registered voters.\nReferences"
