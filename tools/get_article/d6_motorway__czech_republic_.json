When completed, it will route from Prague through Karlovy Vary and Cheb, to the border with Germany. D6's first segment was opened in 1980s.\nThe D6 motorway is part of the European road E48, and a short part of it forms the European road E49. ,  of the motorway is in operation.\nChronology\nThe section between Pavlov – Velká Dobrá was built in two stages, at a total length of the section being . The motorway route is built in the R 24,5/100 category. Construction of the section started in May 1999. The first stage of the section was put into operation in half profile on 20 June 2001. The second profile was put into operation on 1 June 2002. The second stage was put into operation in half profile in autumn 2000 and in full profile on 20 June 2001.\nThe D6 begins at a connection with the Prague ring road which starts at the Řepy interchange and ends in the cadastre of the village of Pavlov where it connects to the previously built section Pavlov - Velká Dobrá, making the Prague - Pavlov section  long. The motorway in this section is built in category R 24,5/120. The route of the motorway is to be crossed in the future by a new runway of Ruzyně Airport. Therefore, a tunnel was built in advance during the construction, to minimize the impact of the later construction, on traffic. Construction of the section started in March 2005 and was handed over for use in December 2008.\nAt a cost of CZK 1 billion, construction on the Lubenec bypass started in March 2018, and finished in March 2021. The construction was led by a consortium of Svietelsky and Strabag.\nRelocations\nThere are several parts of the I/6, which had to be relocated, to accommodate bypasses around important towns. These relocations meant that the old I/6 road was redesignated as road I/606. The  relocation of the D6 in Krupá was put into operation in August 2024.\nFuture developments\nThe  relocation of the D6 in Hořesedly is set to open in June 2025. Two months later, in September 2025, is the planned opening of the  long bypass of Hořovičky.\nSeveral tenders have been issued for future construction, in, and east of Karlovy Vary. In 2024, a tender has been issued for  long section between Bošov and Knínice, at a cost of nearly €170 million, and the section is now under construction.\nExit list\n|notes=Kilometrage starting point\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=End of electronic toll section\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Temporary end of motorway\n}}\n|notes=Temporary start of motorway\n}}\n|notes=Start of electronic toll section\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Temporary end, sections in planning\n----\nRoad continues as Czech I/6\n}}\nImages\nFile:Dálnice D6 most u Sokolova (1).jpg | Bridge of the D6 motorway near the town of Sokolov, Sokolov District.\nFile:Dálnice D6 most u Sokolova (3a).jpg\nFile:Jeneč, dálnice D6 01.jpg | D6 motorway near Jeneč in Central Bohemian Region.\nFile:Railway bridge over D6 between Jenec and Hostoun.jpg | Railway bridge over D6 between Jeneč and Hostouň.\nReferences\nContent in this edit is translated from the existing Czech Wikipedia article at :cs:Dálnice D6; see its history for attribution."
