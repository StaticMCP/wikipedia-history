The battle ended in a massacre of the Snapphanar who were not equipped to deal with the cavalry.\nBackground\nBefore the Battle of Borst, General Lennart Torstenson invaded Denmark in the Torstenson War. One of the objectives of the Swedish army was Scania, so under the command of Gustav Horn, Count of Pori Swedish forces invaded Scania.  The Danish forces were either scattered or captured leaving Scania in the hands of the Swedes.  A group of scanian partisans called the Snapphane tried to resist the Swedish occupation, most of their ranks were filled with farmers so they were poorly unequipped.\nBattle\nThe Battle of Borst was fought on the 25 of March 1644 and took place north of the town of Vombsjön. The Battle began when the Swedish cavalry was on their way to plunder Bjärsjölagärd and Övedskloster when they encountered resistance near Borstbäcken, the Scanians numbered about 500 poorly armed and untrained peasants.  Many of the Scanians were equipped with spears and clubs, with a very few having Wheel-lock rifle.  Most of the peasants came from the Färs Härad region.  They came up against 300 well armed and battle-hardened Swedish calvary,  easily destroyed the poorly equipped peasants. About 500 peasants or almost all of the peasants were killed.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, the dead Scanians were buried in a mass grave not far from the battlefield.  The Swedish continued their campaign and conquered Scania, the War would end in a Swedish victory with gains in Norway, Haaland, and islands in the Baltic. The battle is still remembered in Scania as a massacre of Scanians.\nReferences"
