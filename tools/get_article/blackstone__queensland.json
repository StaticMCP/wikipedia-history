In the , Blackstone had a population of 1,144 people.\nHistory\nThe district was originally called Bundamba Creek but this caused confusion with nearby Bundamba, so the postmistress Mrs Orr proposed the name Blackstone, believed to be a place in Ireland.\nThe area is renowned for its mining history and in 1866 Welshman Lewis Thomas established one of the first mines in the area. Blackstone has a rich Welsh history with Lewis Thomas having populated the community with Welsh miners and their families, who in turn established their own Cambrian choir and church in 1886, a School of Arts in 1891, a Soccer club in 1890, and public school in 1887.\nAfter switching to mining at Dinmore in 1870, Thomas returned to open his first Aberdare Mine in 1876 and prospered thereafter. In 1881 the government granted him permission to build a private railway which developed by 1903 into a loop line connecting the mines from:\n* Bundamba to Redbank:\n* Blackheath\n* Box Flat\n* Fairbank\n* Aberdare\n* Bogside\n* No 2, Mafeking\n* Denham\n* Swanbank\n* Bonnie Dundee\n* Rhondda\n* Whitwood\n*New Chum.\nBlackstone Congregational Church was established in 1879 and was designed by architect Will Haenke. The church originally faced Thomas Street, but circa 1900 a new church building was constructed to face Mary Street with the original building being retained as a hall. In December 2007 the Samoan Methodist Church purchased the church with Samoan-language services being conducted from 27 January 2008.\nBlackstone State School opened on 17 January 1887 and closed on 31 December 2009. The school was at 14 Hill Street (). The school's website was archived.\nAt some time after 1980, Bundamba Uniting Church and Blackstone Uniting Church joined Trinity Uniting Church in North Booval which was then renamed Trinity Ipswich Uniting Church.\nDemographics\nIn the , Blackstone had a population of 1,017 people.\nIn the , Blackstone had a population of 1,024 people.\nIn the , Blackstone had a population of 1,144 people.\nHeritage listings\nBlackstone has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 6 Thomas Street: United Welsh Church, Blackstone\n* 14 Mary Street: Blackstone Congregational Church, Blackstone\n* 20 Thomas Street: Cambrian House, Blackstone\n* 16 Hill Street: Blackstone State School, Blackstone\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Blackstone.
