However, he praised the action sequences and choice of music.\nRobert Daniels of IGN scored the film 2 out of 10, noting a lack of character development, a bloated story that is incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the games or the original source material, and poor direction and visual effects.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
