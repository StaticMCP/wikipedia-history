Her father died when she was 7 years old and she was primarily raised by her grandmother, who taught her how to sew. She began sewing and creating dolls, crafts, and clothes when she was young.\nAfter growing up in Cambridge near Harvard University, she graduated from the local Cambridge High & Latin, and then Emerson College, she then moved to New York in order to pursue dance and performance. There, she taught dance and designed costumes for the Billie Pope Dance Company.\nArtistic career\nWard Armstrong's work in soft sculpture began in the 70's when she made a doll for a friend's child. She was encouraged to pursue sculpture professionally by Barry Gaither and started creating larger-scale pieces depicting human-scale figures. Initially, her work was displayed mostly in the Boston area, but an installation at the California Afro-American Museum brought her work to a much wider audience.\nA consistent objective in her life-size sculptures is, as Barry Gaither noted, to, \"force a delightful but lasting dialogue between themselves and the viewers.\" Ward Armstrong frequently used bold color, fabrics from different cultures around the world, 3D objects, and abstraction to play with traditional forms of art, such as African masks and portraiture.\nFrom 1978-1984, she was an artist-in-residence at Northeastern University. Her sculpture work has been exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the California Afro-American Museum, the Harriet Tubman House.\nShe collaborated with her husband and musician Howard Armstrong on many creative ventures. A POV documentary released in 2002, Sweet Old Song, was made about their life together.\nNotable works\n* New Race I, 1986\n* New Race II, 1987-1988\n* Life Begins at 70, 1988\n* Let My People Go, 1989\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Barbara Ward: A Portfolio\n* [http://hdl.handle.net/2047/D20428803 Interview with Barbara Ward, fine artist, dancer, choreographer, drummer and wife of Howard Armstrong]\n* [https://www.archive.pov.org/sweetoldsong/ Sweet Old Song, POV (PBS)]"
