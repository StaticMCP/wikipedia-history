The government announced that elections to nine councils would not take place in 2025 to allow restructuring to take place, with elections to reformed or newly created replacement authorities taking place in 2026.\nOn the same day, there will also be elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd.\nBackground\nThe 2025 local elections were described as a sweeping victory for Reform UK. The party placed first, winning the most seats and took control of a number of local authorities. The governing Labour Party and opposition Conservative Party suffered historic losses. This was the first time that Labour finished fourth in a local election; they were the first elections under the premiership of Keir Starmer. There were major gains for the Liberal Democrats who won new councils.\nFollowing the publication of the English Devolution White Paper on 16 December 2024, which set out the Labour government's plans for local government reorganisation, some of the elections scheduled for May 2025 will be delayed by up to a year while reorganisation takes place. County councils and unitary authorities had until 10 January 2025 to request to join the Government's Devolution Priority Programme and ask the Government to cancel or postpone their regularly scheduled elections. At least 13 of the 21 county councils asked the government to delay their elections.\nOn 5 February 2025, the government announced that elections to nine councils (seven county councils and two unitary authorities) would not take place in 2025 to allow restructuring to take place, with elections to reformed or newly created replacement authorities taking place in 2026.\nIn September 2025, following the Angela Rayner tax scandal that led to her resignation and a Labour Party deputy leadership election, the subsequent cabinet reshuffle, and the dismissal of Peter Mandelson as British ambassador to the United States over the latter's association with Jeffrey Epstein, criticisms of Starmer's leadership became more prominent within the Labour party. MPs reportedly viewed underperformance in the 2026 local elections and next Senedd election as a likely catalyst for a leadership challenge. On 13 September, The Guardian reported that plans to replace Starmer had begun among groups of MPs.\nLondon boroughs\nElections for all councillors in all thirty-two London boroughs will be held in 2026 in line with their normal election schedule. The previous elections to London borough councils were held in 2022, which saw Labour win its second-best result in any London election and the Conservatives return their lowest-ever number of councillors in the capital.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"1\" | New\n|-\n| Barking and Dagenham\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Barnet\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Bexley\n| 45\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Brent\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Bromley\n| 58\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Camden\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Croydon\n| 70\n|  (Conservative minority)\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Ealing\n| 70\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Enfield\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Greenwich\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hackney\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hammersmith and Fulham\n| 50\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Haringey\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Harrow\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Havering\n| 55\n|  (HRA/Labour coalition)\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hillingdon\n| 53\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hounslow\n| 62\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Islington\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Kensington and Chelsea\n| 50\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Kingston upon Thames\n| 48\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Lambeth\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Lewisham\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Merton\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Newham\n| 66\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Redbridge\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Richmond upon Thames\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Southwark\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Sutton\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Tower Hamlets\n| 45\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Waltham Forest\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Wandsworth\n| 58\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Westminster\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | All 32 councils\n! 1,817\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nMetropolitan boroughs\nThere are thirty-six metropolitan boroughs, which are single-tier local authorities. Thirty-two of them have an election in 2026 (Doncaster, Liverpool, Wirral and Rotherham do not). Of these, Birmingham City Council and St Helens Council hold their elections on a four-year cycle from 2022, so are due to hold an election in 2026. In 2025 Barnsley Council held a public consultation regarding the permanent adoption of the whole council election cycle, which has since been confirmed. The council is going to hold their elections on a four-year cycle starting from 2026. The remaining twenty-nine councils generally elect a third of their councillors every year for three years with no election in each fourth year, on the same timetable which includes elections in 2026. Thirteen of these metropolitan borough councils have all of their councillors up for election in 2026 rather than the usual one-third, following ward boundary changes from their LGBCE electoral review. All thirteen will likely be reverting to thirds in 2027, 2028 and 2030.\nElections for all councillors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Barnsley\n| 63\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Birmingham\n| 101\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Bradford\n| 90\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Calderdale\n| 51\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Coventry\n| 54\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Gateshead\n| 66\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Kirklees\n| 69\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Newcastle upon Tyne\n| 78\n|   (Labour minority)\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Sandwell\n| 72\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Sefton\n| 66\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Solihull\n| 51\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| South Tyneside\n| 54\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| St Helens\n| 48\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Sunderland\n| 75\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Wakefield\n| 63\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Walsall\n| 60\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | 16 councils\n! 1,061\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|}\nElection for one third of councillors\nBy-elections or uncontested wards can cause the seats up for election to be above or below one third of the council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! up\n! of\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Bury\n| 17\n| 51\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Rochdale\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Bolton\n| 20\n| 60\n|  (Labour minority)\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Dudley\n| 24\n| 72\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Knowsley\n| 15\n| 45\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Leeds\n| 33\n| 99\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Manchester\n| 32\n| 96\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| North Tyneside\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Oldham\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Salford\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Sheffield\n| 28\n| 84\n|  (Labour minority)\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Stockport\n| 21\n| 63\n|  (Lib Dem minority)\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Tameside\n| 19\n| 57\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Trafford\n| 22\n| 63\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Wigan\n| 25\n| 75\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|-\n| Wolverhampton\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n| ||\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | 17 councils\n!  356\n!  1,065\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|}\nUnitary authorities\nNew unitary authorities\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Previous councils and control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | New council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Result\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" | County\n!colspan=\"3\" | District\n|-\n|rowspan=11|Surrey\n|rowspan=11\n|Guildford\n|\n|rowspan=6|West Surrey\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 90\n| rowspan=\"11\" |TBD\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Details\n|-\n| Runnymede\n|\n|-\n|Spelthorne\n|\n|-\n|Surrey Heath\n|\n|-\n|Waverley\n|\n|-\n| Woking\n|\n|-\n| Elmbridge\n|\n|rowspan=5|East Surrey\n| rowspan=\"5\" |72\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Details\n|-\n|Epsom and Ewell\n|\n|-\n| Mole Valley\n|\n|-\n| Reigate and Banstead\n|\n|-\n| Tandridge\n|\n|}\nElection of councillors by thirds\nSwindon and Milton Keynes elect councillors by thirds, but have all seats up in 2026 due to new ward boundaries.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! up\n! of\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Halton\n| 18\n| 54\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hartlepool\n| 12\n| 36\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hull\n| 19\n| 57\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|-\n| Milton Keynes\n| 60\n| 60\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|-\n| Peterborough\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|-\n| Reading\n| 16\n| 48\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|-\n| Swindon\n| 57\n| 57\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|-\n| Wokingham\n| 18\n| 54\n|\n|colspan=2|\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | 6 councils\n!  103\n!  306\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nMayors\nCombined authorities\nAll combined authority mayors up for election in 2026 are newly-established roles.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
