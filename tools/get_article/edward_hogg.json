He was quoted as saying: \"I like being in film, I like going to watch a film, and I'm in it, and going 'wow' but, actually, I think doing the physical kind of acting, being on stage, is better. Because it's happening, it's instant, there and then all the time.\"\nCareer\nHogg made his professional debut in a production of ''My Father's Son at the Sheffield Crucible.
