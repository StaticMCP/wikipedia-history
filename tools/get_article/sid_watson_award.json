      "text": "# Sid Watson Award\n\nThe Sid Watson Award is an annual award given to the top player in NCAA Division III Men's Ice Hockey. It is given by the American Hockey Coaches Association. It was known as the Division III Men's Player of the Year Award prior to 2005.\nIn 2004, the AHCA voted to rename the Division III Men's Player of the Year after Sid Watson. The award is named for longtime Bowdoin College hockey coach and athletic director Sid Watson, who died in April 2004 at age 71. Watson was a three sports star at Northeastern and went on to play four seasons in the NFL before starting his coaching career at Bowdoin in 1958.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the award was not conferred during the 2021 season.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"\n!
