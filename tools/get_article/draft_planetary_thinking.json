It focuses on transcending anthropocentric perspectives by offering a broader understanding of humanity’s relationship with planetary processes. This framework integrates long-term perspectives on planetary dynamics, human-planet interactions, and systemic considerations for ecological sustainability.\nHistorical and theoretical background\nThe origins of planetary thinking can be traced back to the intellectual developments in the mid-20th century, where concerns about the planet’s finite resources, environmental degradation, and the impacts of human activities led scholars to think in broader, interconnected terms. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, authors such as Bruno Latour and Dipesh Chakrabarty have further expanded on these ideas. Latour’s Down to Earth: Politics in the New Climatic Regime proposes a new political order grounded in planetary responsibility​, while Chakrabarty’s The Climate of History in a Planetary Age explores how human history can be understood within planetary scales. The development of planetary thinking incorporated scientific insights and Indigenous knowledge, underscoring the interconnectedness of life and natural processes. This perspective aligns with theories of planetary multiplicity, which highlight the Earth’s historical evolution through various states of change.\nCore Concepts\n# Planetary Interconnectedness: The recognition that Earth's systems—ecological, geological, atmospheric, and human—are interlinked. Planetary thinking suggests to view these systems as part of a single, integrated whole.\n# Temporal and Spatial Scales: The framework considers the temporal and spatial dimensions of Earth processes. It incorporates perspectives on \"deep time,\" addressing planetary dynamics over millennia, as well as the global scale of current environmental challenges.\n# Beyond Anthropocentrism: Moving away from a strictly human-centered worldview, planetary thinking proposes recognizing the agency and value of non-human entities, including ecosystems and other natural processes.\n# Interdisciplinarity: Planetary thinking draws from multiple disciplines, including environmental science, philosophy, sociology, and political science. It suggests to integrate these perspectives to develop a holistic understanding of planetary systems.\nImplications for governance and democracy\nPlanetary thinking has potential implications for democratic governance, suggesting institutional reforms that reflect the long-term and global nature of planetary processes. Nation-state governance has been critiqued as insufficient for addressing planetary-scale challenges that require coordinated international responses. Scholars like Frank Biermann, Stefanie Fishel, and Anthony D. Burke propose institutional innovations, including global environmental treaties and multinational regulatory frameworks, to address these interconnected challenges.\nThe framework also suggests expanding democratic systems to represent future generations and non-human entities. This includes the legal recognition of ecosystems through concepts such as the rights of nature, which grant legal personhood to natural systems. Such approaches suggest an ethical and practical need for inclusive governance that recognizes humanity's interdependence with the environment. However, planetary governance raises concerns about democratic legitimacy and representation, as expanding decision-making to a global scale may distance governance from local communities. Balancing global coordination with local democratic participation remains a central challenge.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.uni-giessen.de/en/faculties/planetarythinking/aboutus Panel on Planetary Thinking - University of Giessen]\n* [https://www.planetpolitics.org/ Planet Politics Institute]\n* [https://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/ Earth System Governance Project]"
