The building was constructed to resemble a colonial warehouse, as it is located next to the Perkins House Museum, which is a preserved colonial home built in 1766.\nThe museum is home to the Simeon Perkins diaries, which detail Perkins' life in Liverpool from 1766 to his death in 1812.\nIn 2016, the museum received a grant of 2,000 from the Region of Queens Municipality, the first grant received from the municipality in 35 years.\nIn 2017, the Queens County Museum agreed to begin operating the historic Liverpool Courthouse, which had sat vacant since 2015. After the Queens County Museum took ownership of the courthouse, it became the Queens Museum of Justice & Exhibit Centre.\nA book containing a Babe Ruth autograph was donated to the Queen County Museum in 2015. In 1933, 11-year-old Granville Nickerson approached Ruth and asked him to sign his copy of The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot.\nThe Queens County Museum began operating the Fort Point Lighthouse in Liverpool as a seasonal attraction in 2021.\nThomas Raddall Research Centre\nThe Queens County Museum houses the Thomas Raddall Research Centre, which contains a library of local history materials. Publicly accessible archival holdings include genealogical, shipping, probate, and census records; a Mi'kmaq and Black Nova Scotian history collection, and every issue of the Queens County Advance published since 1929.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Nova Scotia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://novascotia.com/listing/queens-county-museum/ Queens County Museum] at Tourism Nova Scotia\n__INDEX__"
