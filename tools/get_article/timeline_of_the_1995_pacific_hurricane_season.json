The official bounds of each Pacific hurricane season are dates that conventionally delineate the period each year during which tropical cyclones tend to form in the basin according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), beginning on May&nbsp;15 in the Eastern Pacific proper (east of 140°W) and June&nbsp;1 in the Central Pacific (140°W to the International Date Line), and ending on November&nbsp;30 in both areas. However, tropical cyclogenesis is possible at any time of year. Activity during the season was below average; only eleven&nbsp;tropical depressions developed, of which ten&nbsp;strengthened into named tropical storms. Seven&nbsp;became hurricanes, of which three&nbsp;further intensified into major hurricanes. Hurricane Barbara was the only tropical cyclone to exist in the Central Pacific in 1995, entering the region as a weak system near dissipation. The first system, Tropical Depression , formed on May&nbsp;21; the final, Hurricane Juliette, dissipated on September&nbsp;26, making this season the first since the beginning of the satellite era in which no tropical cyclones were active after September.\nThe vast majority of damage and casualties during the season resulted from Hurricane Ismael in mid-September. It was initially expected to move slowly to the west or northwest, which would have kept it over open ocean. Instead, it accelerated northward and struck northwestern Mexico, catching many in its path unprepared. High seas damaged or destroyed fifty-two&nbsp;fishing boats, killing fifty-seven&nbsp;fishermen. On land, strong winds and severe flooding caused heavy damage and killed fifty-nine&nbsp;people in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The name Ismael was later retired on account of the hurricane's disastrous effects. Two other hurricanes, Flossie and Henriette, adversely affected land. Flossie in August remained off the coast of Mexico but passed close enough to cause gusty winds and flooding rains; seven&nbsp;people died. An eighth death occurred after Flossie helped generate severe thunderstorms and flash floods in Arizona. In early September, Henriette made landfall at peak intensity on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula before continuing westward out to sea; it caused moderate damage, but no known fatalities.\nPrior to 2015, two time zones were utilized in the Eastern Pacific basin: Pacific east of 140°W, and Hawaii−Aleutian from 140°W to the International Date Line. For convenience, each event is listed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first, using the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC), with the respective local time included in parentheses. Figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest five&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers) and averaged over one&nbsp;minute, following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury. This timeline documents the formation of tropical cyclones as well as the strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It also includes information that was not released while the storm was active, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center is included.\nTimeline of events\nMay\nMay 15\n*The 1995 Eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nMay 21\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, May&nbsp;20) at Tropical Depression  forms from an Intertropical Convergence Zone disturbance about 405&nbsp;mi (650&nbsp;km) south of Manzanillo, Colima;
