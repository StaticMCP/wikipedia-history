One such raid occurred at Massard Prairie on July 27, 1864 where Confederate forces under Brigadier-General Richard M. Gano won a victory, encouraging further engagement.\nOpposing Forces\nUnion\n* District of the Frontier – Brig. Gen. John M. Thayer\n** 1st Brigade – Col. John Edwards\n** 2nd Brigade – Col. James M. Williams\n** 3rd Brigade – Col. William R. Judson\nConfederate\n* District of the Indian Territory – BG Douglas H. Cooper\n** 5th Texas Cavalry Brigade – Brig. Gen. Richard M. Gano\n** 1st Indian Brigade – Brig. Gen. Stand Watie\nBattle\nSeveral days later Gano's superior, Brigadier-General Douglas H. Cooper, led a Confederate division several miles north to Fort Smith. Cooper's force consisted of Gano's brigade and Watie's brigade. Gano took position along the Indian Territory side of the Poteau River while Watie moved up from the south on the Arkansas side. Brigadier-General John M. Thayer commanded the town's defenses with three brigades. Watie's men made first contact with the 6th Kansas Cavalry of Colonel William R. Judson's brigade. Judson's men fell back from Fort No. 2 along the Texas Road, alerting the rest of the Union garrison of the Confederate arrival. Cooper's men began to shell the fort. Thayer responded by sending forward units from Williams' brigade, including the 6th Kansas Colored Infantry and two howitzers from the 2nd Kansas Battery. The Union artillery proved superior and soon drove off the Confederates. Cooper ordered a withdrawal, leaving snipers behind to cover the retreat.\nAftermath\nCooper took with him approximately $130,000 worth of Union arms and supplies. Thayer maintained control of Fort Smith for the duration of the war.  Fort Smith is preserved within Fort Smith National Historic Site.\nSee also\n* List of American Civil War battles\n* Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1864\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://home.nps.gov/fosm/learn/historyculture/six-days-one-summer.htm/index.htm Battle of Fort Smith] at Fort Smith National Historic Site\n* [https://www.arkansasheritage.com/arkansas-register/fort-2-rifle-pits Fort No. 2 Rifle Pits] at Division of Arkansas Heritage"
