It was the last album with Graham Oliver before he was fired.\nReleased in September 1995, 'Dogs of War' marked a period of changes for Saxon, both in their sound and lineup. The band began to flirt more intensely with Hard Rock and had on the album the last appearance of Graham Oliver as a member of the classic formation, as the guitarist was expelled from Saxon for leading the sale of a 1980 live album without permission of the other members, having obtained all the profit from the sale of the bootleg. Even 'Dogs of War' was re-released in 2009 with bonus tracks from this show.\nTrack listing\nA 2006 CD re-issue on SPV/Steamhammer Records includes two bonus live tracks: \"The Great White Buffalo\" and \"Denim and Leather\" recorded in 1995.\nPersonnel\n* Biff Byford - vocals\n* Graham Oliver - guitars\n* Paul Quinn - guitars\n* Nibbs Carter - bass guitar\n* Nigel Glockler - drums\n* Rainer Hänsel - guitars (guest)\n; Production\n* Biff Byford  - producer, mixing\n* Rainer Hänsel - producer\n* Kalle Trapp - mixing engineer\n* John Mc Lane - mixing engineer\n* Gems Studio in Boston, Lincolnshire, England - recording location\nRevolution Studios in Cheadle Hulme\n* Karo Studios, Brackel, Germany - mixing location\n* Paul R.
