When his cousin Leo IV, the last Hethumid monarch of Cilicia, was murdered by the barons, the crown was offered to his younger brother John, who urged Guy to accept it. Guy was reluctant — his mother and two of his brothers had been murdered by the Armenian regent Oshin of Corycos — but he eventually accepted and took the name Constantine.\nGuy was killed in an uprising in Armenia on April 17, 1344 and was succeeded by a distant cousin, Constantine III.\nMarriages and issue\nGuy married twice, firstly to a Kantakouzene (died c. 1330), without issue, and secondly in 1330–1332, Theodora Syrgiannaina (died 1347/1349), with whom he fathered:\n* Isabella of Lusignan (c. or after 1333 – in Cyprus, 1382–1387), Lady of Aradippou, married after February 26, 1349 Manuel Kantakouzenos (c. 1326 – April 10, 1380), Despot of Morea.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
