The most serious of these began near Shiraz in January 1744 and was led by Moḥammad Taqi Khan Shirazi, the commander of Fārs province and one of Nāder’s favorites. In June 1744, Nāder sacked Shiraz, and by winter he had crushed these revolts with extreme force. Since Nader had taken an oath to never kill Taqi Khan, he was tortured and mutilated instead: he was castrated and an eye was torn out, then his brother, sons and friends were executed in front of him, and then his wife was raped in front of him by Nader's soldiers.\nSee also\n* Afsharid dynasty\n* Safavid dynasty\n* Shiraz\n* Nader Shah\nSources\n* Michael Axworthy, The Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant Hardcover 348 pages (26 July 2006) Publisher: I.B.
