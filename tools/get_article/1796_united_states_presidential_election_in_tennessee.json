It was the first presidential election that Tennessee had participated in since being admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796, as the 16th state.\nTennessee voted for the Democratic-Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson over Federalist candidate, John Adams, but the exact election results are unknown. Jefferson did, however, win all three electoral votes.\nTennessee used an electoral district system to choose its electors, with each district electing a single elector. This is similar to the way Nebraska and Maine choose their electors in modern elections.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Tennessee\n* 1796 Tennessee gubernatorial election\nReferences"
