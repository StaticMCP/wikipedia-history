This version was also used in the Future of Go Summit in May 2017. It used four TPUs on a single machine with Elo rating 4,858. DeepMind claimed that AlphaGo Master was 3-stone stronger than the version used in AlphaGo v. Lee Sedol.\nDeepMind released a version of AlphaGo Master in December 2017 that serves as a teaching tool analyzing the win rates of 6,000 Go openings from 230,000 human games.\nMatches\nOnline games\nThe software was first used to play games against professional players on 29 December 2016 on the Tygem Go server, under the account name 'Magister' (shown as 'Magist' at the server's Chinese version). The account name was changed to 'Master' on 30 December. After playing 30 games on Tygem, it was moved to the FoxGo server on 1 January 2017.\nMaster played at the pace of 10 games per day. Many quickly suspected it to be an AI player due to little or no resting between games. After winning its 59th game it was revealed in the chatroom that Master was controlled by Aja Huang of the DeepMind team. On 4 January 2017, after these games were completed, Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, confirmed that Magister and Master both played using an updated version of AlphaGo and said, \"We're looking forward to playing some official, full-length games later [in 2017] in collaboration with Go organizations and experts\".\nGu Li, a 9-dan player and co-founder of FoxGo, offered a bounty of 100,000&nbsp;RMB (14,400&nbsp;USD) to the first human player who could defeat Master. However, no one took the bounty since Master's final online record was 60 wins and 0 losses, including three victories over Go's top ranked player, Ke Jie, who had been quietly briefed in advance that Master was a version of AlphaGo.\nMaster's adversaries included many world champions such as Ke Jie, Park Jeong-hwan, Yuta Iyama, Tuo Jiaxi, Mi Yuting, Shi Yue, Chen Yaoye, Li Qincheng, Gu Li, Chang Hao, Tang Weixing, Fan Tingyu, Zhou Ruiyang, Jiang Weijie, Chou Chun-hsun, Kim Ji-seok, Kang Dong-yun, Park Yeong-hun, and Won Seong-jin, and also included national champions or world championship runners-up such as Lian Xiao, Tan Xiao, Meng Tailing, Dang Yifei, Huang Yunsong, Yang Dingxin, Gu Zihao, Shin Jinseo, Cho Han-seung, and An Sungjoon. All 60 games except one were fast-paced games with three 20 or 30 seconds byo-yomi. Master offered to extend the byo-yomi to one minute when playing with Nie Weiping due to his old age.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No. !! Date !! Player (dan during the game)  !! Time control !!

It defeated Ke Jie in a three-game match by three to zero and beat a human team with five top Go professionals.\nInnovative moves\nGo experts were extremely impressed by Master's performance and by its non-human play style in its online games. Ke Jie stated, \"After humanity spent thousands of years improving our tactics, computers tell us that humans are completely wrong... I would go as far as to say not a single human has touched the edge of the truth of Go\".\nMaster played many innovative moves and inspired professional players.\nIn the 23rd online game Master invaded the 3-3 point at a very early stage.\n{| style=\"display:inline; display:inline-table;\"\n| style=\"border: solid thin; padding: 2px;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | Online game 23, Master (black) v.
