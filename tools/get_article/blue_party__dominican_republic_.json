Ulises Heureaux and Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra were the main leaders of this party in the 20th century, and were opposed to  or Red Party, led by Horacio Vásquez.\nThe name of the party came from the popularity of rooster fighting in the late 19th and early 20th century, and Bolos literally means Tailless. The Blue Party was banned in 1930 after Rafael Trujillo’s coup. Founded by intellectuals, Santo Domingo liberals, merchants and large peasant proprietors, it does not technically have an ideological heir, although the Liberal Party of the Dominican Republic tends to identify with a similar type of liberalism.\nSee also\n*:Category:Blue Party (Dominican Republic) politicians\n*History of the Dominican Republic\nReferences"
