It is a gray granite monument erected in 1879 and approximately 40&nbsp;inches square and 58&nbsp;inches tall.  It is located in a circular plot approximately 31 feet in diameter.  It commemorates the site of the hanging of Major John André on October 2, 1780.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\nThe monument was constructed in 1879 by millionaire Cyrus W. Field. It was dedicated on October 2, 1879. It was quite controversial when it was first constructed, and there were three attempts to destroy the monument:\n* On February 22, 1882, the monument was hacked and mutilated by George Hendrix, of New York City.\n* On March 30, 1882 at 11:35 PM, an explosion slightly damaged the monument.\n* On November 3, 1885 at 10:00 PM, an explosion destroyed the iron fence surrounding the monument and toppled the monument.\nIt was felt that a monument to a British spy was an insult to George Washington; for this reason, a bronze tablet was later added to commemorate the bravery of Washington and his generals during a crisis of the war.\nAfter Cyrus Field's death, his heirs refused to pay the taxes of $6.38 on the property. George Dickey of Nyack bought the land in a tax auction in October 1895. Mr. Dickey sold the land to the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society for $250 on November 13, 1905.  After the Society disbanded in 1983, the property was conveyed to Rockland County NY.\nGallery\nFile:Andremonument1879.jpg|Monument with base\nFile:JohnAndreInscription.jpg|Major John André Monument inscription, April 2008\nMajor John Andre Monument, Tappan, NY - main view.jpg\nInscription\nHERE DIED OCTOBER 2, 1780.\nMAJOR JOHN ANDRE, OF THE BRITISH ARMY\nWHO ENTERED THE AMERICAN LINES\nON A SECRET MISSION TO BENEDICT ARNOLD\nFOR THE SURRENDER OF WEST POINT,\nWAS TAKEN PRISONER TRIED AND CONDEMNED AS A SPY.\nHIS DEATH\nTHOUGH ACCORDING TO THE STERN CODE OF WAR\nMOVED EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO PITY,\nAND BOTH ARMIES MOURNED THE FATE\nOF ONE SO YOUNG AND BRAVE.\nIN 1821 HIS REMAINS WERE REMOVED TO WESTMINSTER ABBEY,\nA HUNDRED YEARS AFTER HIS EXECUTION.\nTHIS STONE WAS PLACED ABOVE THE SPOT WHERE HE LAY,\nNOT TO PERPETUATE THE RECORD OF STRIFE\nBUT IN TOKEN OF THOSE BETTER FEELINGS\nWHICH HAVE  SINCE UNITED THE NATIONS\nONE IN RACE, IN LANGUAGE AND IN RELIGION,\nWITH THE EARNEST HOPE THAT THIS FRIENDLY UNION\nWILL NEVER BE BROKEN.\nArthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean of Westminster\nReferences\nExternal links"
