While collaborating with Mylène Farmer and Laurent Boutonnat, she recorded a series of albums that attained immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on NRJ, Europe 1, MTV, Virgin, and many others. Throughout her career, many of her songs have been in top 25 hit lists on the record charts, including \"Moi... Lolita\", \"L'Alizé\", \"J'en ai marre!\" \"Gourmandises\", \"Mademoiselle Juliette\", her cover version of \"La Isla Bonita\", \"Parler Tout Bas\", \"Les collines (never leave you)\" and \"À cause de l'automne\".\nHer first two albums were composed by Laurent Boutonnat and written by Mylène Farmer.

The album featured her most successful single \"Moi... Lolita\" which reached number one in several countries in Europe and East Asia, in the UK the song was acclaimed by the New Musical Express who recognised it with a \"Single of the Week\" award. It became a rare example of a foreign-language song to chart highly in the UK, peaking at number 9.\nGourmandises was followed by a second studio album, Mes Courants Électriques, in 2003. Following its release, Alizée toured during the fall of 2003, performing in 43 concerts throughout France, Belgium and Switzerland.\nAlizée married fellow French singer Jérémy Chatelain in late 2003.
