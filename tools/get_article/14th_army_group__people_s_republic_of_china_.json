It was organized in March 1949.\nAt its activation, the Army Group's commander was Liu Yalou, commissar was Mo Wenhua, 1st deputy commander Huang Yongsheng, deputy commissar Wu Faxian.\nThe Army Group was composed of 39th, 41st, and 42nd Corps.\nIn July 1949, roughly 3 months after its activation, the 14th Army Group was inactivated and converted as headquarters, People's Liberation Army Air Force.\nIt should be clearly noted that William W. Whitson, writing with Chen-Hsia Huang in The Chinese High Command, 1972, lists a 14th Army (rather than Army Group) under the Fourth Field Army in the June–September 1949 period, and gives its composition as the 48th Corps (142nd, 143rd, and 144th Divisions) and the 54th Corps (160th, 161st, and 162nd Divisions). He lists the commander during that period as Ch'en Ch'i-han.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*William W. Whitson, with Chen-hsia Huang.
