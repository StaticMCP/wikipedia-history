Voters were asked whether they approved of the possibility of renouncing independence and integration with Moldova, or alternatively independence and possible future integration into Russia.\nForeign actors described infringements, a lack of conditions for free will expression and a biased wording in the questions of the referendum, and its results were not recognized internationally.\nBackground\nPro-Moldovan organisations announced before the referendum that they would not recognise its results. Ballots for the referendum were reprinted three times, as the chairman of electoral commission, Piotr Denisenko, announced a shrinkage of electorate of 7% compared with the previous year. Moreover, according to the 2004 Transnistrian census, only 90% of the population of Transnistria had Transnistrian citizenship and could thus vote, and many of the rest have only Moldovan citizenship. In the 2004 Transnistrian census, 107,600 thousand people (19,4%) listed themselves as citizens of the Republic of Moldova, while 56,000 people (10,1%) claimed citizenship of the Russian Federation and 44,400 people (8,0%) citizenship of Ukraine; this was hardly reflected in the referendum results.\nResults\nRenouncing independence and potential future integration into Moldova\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|-\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||10,308||3.39\n|-\n|align=left|Against||294,253||96.61\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||5,608||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||310,169||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||394,861||78.55\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"4\"|Source: [http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=md022006 Direct Democracy]\n|}\nIndependence and potential future integration into Russia\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|-\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||301,332||98.07\n|-\n|align=left|Against||5,905||1.93\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||2,932||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||310,169||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||394,861||78.55\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"4\"|Source: [http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=md012006 Direct Democracy]\n|}\nOf the total of 394,861 registered voters, the voter turnout was 78.6%, substantially more than the 50%+1 required by law to validate the referendum.\nOn the day of the referendum, no exit polling was allowed within 25 meters of polling stations, to prevent disruption of voting.\nReactions\nInternational organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, European Union, GUAM, and some other countries (Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania, Norway, Iceland) did not recognise the referendum.\nThe representative of the Congress of Russian Communities from Moldova declared that the referendum was held according to international standards. However, no internationally recognised monitoring organisations had observers present.\nViktor Alksnis, a deputy from the Russian party \"Rodina\" stated that referendum in Transnistria was held without any violations of legislation and democratic standards.\nViktor Alksnis is known to have previously described the Transnistrian Republic as the base from which the Soviet Union's restoration would begin.\nIn the opinion of the Ukrainian foreign ministry, the situation in Transnistria failed to meet the conditions of a free will expression by citizens.\nAccording to the OSCE, the media climate in the Transdniestrian region is restrictive, as authorities there continue a long-standing campaign to silence independent opposition voices and movements.\nAlthough the OSCE decided not to send any observers to monitor the referendum, 130 observers from CIS and Europe and from eleven election monitoring organizations who did attend the referendum had different reactions.\nIn contrast, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Moldova (HCHRM) claims to have observed a series of infringements at the referendum:\n# Groups of activists going into people's homes, especially in Tiraspol and Bender districts, asking why they did not come to the referendum, and threatening that after the referendum they will be forced to look for a new home in Romania.\n# At some voting stations agents dressed in civil or militia uniforms forcing the observers from outside the sections to stay at a distance of 200–250 meters far from these places.\n# \"Cleaning\" of the list of voters by excluding some citizens who previously boycotted elections and referendums held in Transnistria.\n# \"Electoral tourism\" and multiple voting\nKarel De Gucht (Chairman of the OSCE) expressed an opinion about the \"lack of basic requirements for free and fair elections, such as freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and political pluralism, in the region pre-determined the results\" and argued that the questions in the referendum are suggestively worded. In a possible manipulation of the public opinion, people are asked to choose between freedom (\"free association\") and loss of independence (\"renounce the Transnistria's independent status\"), between reality (\"support the course\") and possibility (\"consider it possible\"). As he said, this formulation could have resulted in a response bias.\nVictor Josu, deputy editor-in-chief of Russian-language Moldovan newspaper Moldavskie Vedomosti, an accredited observer, described the referendum as a successful public relations action (regardless of violations and a lack of recognition) and reported favorably on a comparison between \"recognized Chişinau\" and \"unrecognized Tiraspol\" in an article which emphasized the openness, transparency and glasnost of the referendum process.\nSergei Bagapsh, president of Abkhazia (Abkhazia claims independence from Georgia, but has a disputed status), has said his republic \"supports the aspirations of Transniestria toward independence and its choice of unification with Russia.\"\nAccording to the results of a telephone survey on the morning of September 18, 63% of the listeners (782 people) of the Ekho Moskvy radio station were in favor of accepting Transnistria into Russia, while 37% (466 people) were against.\nSee also\n*Elections in Transnistria\n*Human rights in Transnistria\n*Politics of Transnistria\n*Proposed Russian annexation of Transnistria\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150227005720/http://www.regnum.ru/english/706298.html \"International observer: Referendum in Transdnestr conforms to international norms\"] Regnum News\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060919182705/http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-09-17-voa30.cfm \"Moldova's Trans-Dniester Votes in Referendum on Whether to Pursue Independence\"] Voice of America News\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020804/http://en.rian.ru/trend/Transdne/ Transdnestr independence plebiscite] RIA Novosti\n* [http://www.osce.org/item/20620.html OSCE reaction]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071211231752/http://www.olvia.idknet.com/ol162-09-06.htm Final monitoring report by international observers]\n* [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/09/2921dabd-b521-449a-a326-bf81bbe3ac88.html Transdniester Conflict Was Long In The Making] Radio Free Europe"
