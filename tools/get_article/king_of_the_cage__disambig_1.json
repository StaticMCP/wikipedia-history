KOTC also promotes events in Canada, Australia & Japan.  King of the Cage events are also broadcast on most national pay-per-view platforms.\nIn September 2007, Trebilcock Jr. sold KOTC to ProElite.  Two years later, in July 2009, he reacquired 100% ownership of KOTC and simultaneously entered into a joint venture agreement with Mark Burnett Productions (Survivor, The Apprentice, The Celebrity Apprentice and The Contender) to begin the development of a reality television program.  Bully Beatdown, a Burnett produced program, aired three seasons on MTV and featured several KOTC competitors.\nOn January 30, 2010, it was announced that KOTC would begin airing monthly shows on Mark Cuban's HDNet channel.  The initial deal was for 36 events to air. The announcers included Michael Schiavello, Jason \"Mayhem\" Miller and Maria Kanellis. The most recent event on HDNet aired on September 17, 2010 with No Mercy. There has been no further news regarding King of the Cage events on the channel. Only 6 events aired from February 2010 to September 2010.\nIn November 2012, MAVTV struck a 5-year deal with King of the Cage.\nCurrent champions\nThe weight division system of KOTC is in accordance with the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, but KOTC names its 145-pound division Bantamweight (instead of Featherweight), its 135-pound division Flyweight (instead of Bantamweight) and its 125-pound division Light Flyweight (instead of Flyweight). The only three weight classes not in accordance with the Unified Rules are a 165-pound division (Light Welterweight), a 195-pound division (Super Middleweight), and a 230-pound division (Cruiserweight).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
