His cousin, George Brown, took over the farm. It was eventually handed down to Jim and Dorothy Gorman in 1943.\nIn 1996, the Cincinnati Nature Center took ownership of the farm and converted it into an outdoor educational facility. The main barn was turned into an interpretive center. The Nature Center turned the farm over to the Village of Evendale, which established the Gorman Heritage Farm Foundation. In 2012, the entire farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Brown–Gorman Farm, owing to its historically significant architecture.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Hamilton County, Ohio\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
