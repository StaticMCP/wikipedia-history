He is currently a free agent. Usually deployed as a right-back, he can also play as a centre-back.\nA versatile defender who can play anywhere across the back-line, Ward was an academy graduate of Portsmouth. He made his senior debut in 2009 following a loan to Bournemouth, and made 96 appearances for the club.\nIn 2012, Ward signed for Crystal Palace, and helped the side achieve promotion to the Premier League in his first season. He has since gone on to make the most top-flight appearances of any player in the club's history, as well as serving the 2023–24 season as club captain and winning the FA Cup in 2025. He departed the club following his release at the end of the 2024–25 season.\nClub career\nPortsmouth\nWard started his footballing career with local youth team East Lodge and signed a professional contract with Portsmouth in July 2008 after spending two years in the Academy and Reserves.\nAFC Bournemouth (loan)\nThe following month, Ward signed a one-year loan deal with AFC Bournemouth to gain first team experience. It came after when he and Matt Ritchie went on trial with the Cherries and appeared in the club's three friendly matches. Upon joining AFC Bournemouth, Ward said: \"I think it will be a great opportunity for me to get first-team football and work for my place. Hopefully I can get game time and getting that experience is all part of growing up. I think League Two will be a test and it's a step up from youth and reserves football. It will be tough to compete but I think I'm capable of raising the bar.\"\nHe soon made his debut in a League Cup match against Cardiff City on 12 August, playing the full 90 minutes as Cardiff ran out 2–1 winners. His League Two debut came later that week on 16 August 2008 in an away draw with Aldershot Town. As the season progressed, Ward continued to appear in defence for the Cherries, competing for a place in the starting–eleven. He gained the first yellow and red cards of his career on 18 October in a 4–1 away defeat to Shrewsbury Town, eventually being sent off for two bookable offences. After serving a one match suspension, Ward made his return, coming on as a 85th-minute substitute, in a 1–0 loss against Lincoln City on 25 October 2008. However, his form meant that he returned to the side soon afterwards, making his Football League Trophy and FA Cup debuts: a home defeat by Colchester United and a home win against Bristol Rovers on 4 and 8 November respectively.\nHowever, in a match against Shrewsbury Town on 7 February 2009, Ward suffered ankle injury after \"falling awkwardly\" and was substituted in the 16th minute, as the club won 1–0. After the match, he was out for eight weeks. By April, Ward was making progress on rehabilitation from his injury. He returned to the first team and scored his first and only Bournemouth goal in a 4–0 win over Morecambe on 2 May 2009. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Ward went on to make twenty–five appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Following this, he returned to his parent club.\nReturn to Portsmouth\nGosport Borough in 2009]]\nOn 26 August 2009, Ward made his Portsmouth debut as a centre-back against Hereford United in the League Cup, before making his Premier League debut on 14 April 2010 against Wigan Athletic, playing from start to finish at left-back as the game finished goalless. Ward played in most of Pompey's remaining league matches that season and remained at Fratton Park in the summer even after they were relegated to the Championship. He began the new season as first-choice right-back, but later lost his starting berth to Wolverhampton Wanderers loanee Greg Halford. Ward scored his first Portsmouth goal in a 3–2 defeat to Doncaster Rovers on 13 November 2010.\nStarting with their 2–0 away victory over Doncaster Rovers on 12 February 2011, a game in which he scored, Ward played as an attacking midfielder in Portsmouth's new 4–2–3–1 formation and earned praise from manager Steve Cotterill who was quoted as saying: \"Joel Ward has got great energy and did well in that role in the centre in midfield in behind the striker.\"\nOn 18 December 2011, Ward scored the equaliser in the South Coast derby against Southampton which finished 1–1.\nCrystal Palace\nduring an exhibition match between Crystal Palace and FC Cincinnati in 2016]]\nOn 28 May 2012, Ward completed a move to Crystal Palace for £400,000 on a four-year deal. He made his debut on 14 August 2012, in a 2–1 win against Exeter City in the League Cup. He made his league debut four days later in a home game against Watford. He won promotion with Crystal Palace after clearing a shot off the line during the last minute of injury time against the same opponents in the 2013 Championship play-off final.  Ward scored his first goal for Crystal Palace in a 3–1 home win against Queens Park Rangers on 14 March 2015.\nOn 15 April 2015, Ward signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract which kept him at Palace until the summer of 2018. As of May 2016, Ward currently holds the record for most Premier League appearances for a Crystal Palace player. He reached the hundred milestone in a 1–1 draw away to Arsenal on 17 April 2016.\nOn 2 July 2018, Ward signed a new three-year deal at the club until the summer of 2021.\nIn July 2021, Ward signed a two-year contract extension.\nIn June 2023, Ward signed a one-year contract extension, and replaced the departing Luka Milivojević as club captain for a season, until Marc Guéhi replaced him the following summer. In May 2024, Ward signed another contract extension, until June 2025.\nOn 13 May 2025, it was announced that Ward would not extend his contract and he would leave the club at the end of the 2024–25 season, having made a total of over 360 appearances in all competitions over thirteen years at the club. Ward was the last remaining member of the 2013 Championship play-off winning squad. He was an unused substitute as Palace won the 2025 FA Cup final on 17 May, lifting the trophy alongside Guéhi. Ward played his final match at Selhurst Park three days later, starting in a 4–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers; he was substituted off in the 71st minute and received a standing ovation, and later stated he \"couldn't have written a better story and a better ending\" to his time at the club.\nPersonal life\nWard is currently involved with helping and supporting local charity Faith and Football, which was set up by former Pompey defender Linvoy Primus. He attended the Bourne Community College in Southbourne and Bishop Luffa School in Chichester. Ward is a Christian and kneels down on the pitch to pray before each match. On 20 April 2014, Ward returned to his home church for an interview about how he brings his Christian faith to his job as a footballer. He currently resides in London.\nStyle of play\nWard operated mainly as a central defender at the start of his professional career, particularly during the beginning of his time at Portsmouth and loan to Bournemouth. He proved his versatility in the 2010–11 season with Steve Cotterill deploying him as a right-back at the start of the season, and also played him as a central midfielder, right midfielder and as an attacking midfielder. Whilst at Palace, he predominantly played at right-back, though often filled in at left back, most notably in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. In the 2023–24 season, under new manager Oliver Glasner, Ward's defensive solidity saw him revert to playing as a right-sided centre-back when Glasner used a system with three centre-backs.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n!rowspan=2|Club\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=3|League\n!colspan=2|FA Cup\n!colspan=2|League Cup\n!colspan=2|Other\n!colspan=2|Total\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Portsmouth\n|2008–09\n|Premier League\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|2009–10\n|Premier League\n|3||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||4||0\n|-\n|2010–11\n|Championship\n|42||3||1||0||3||0||colspan=2|—||46||3\n|-\n|2011–12\n|Championship\n|44||3||1||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||46||3\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!89!!6!!2!!0!!5!!0!!0!!0!!96!!6\n|-\n|AFC Bournemouth (loan)\n|2008–09\n|League Two\n|21||1||2||0||1||0||1||0||25||1\n|-\n|rowspan=14|Crystal Palace\n|2012–13\n|Championship\n|25||0||0||0||2||0||3||0||30||0\n|-\n|2013–14\n|Premier League\n|36||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||36||0\n|-\n|2014–15\n|Premier League\n|37||1||3||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||40||1\n|-\n|2015–16\n|Premier League\n|30||2||6||1||2||0||colspan=2|—||38||3\n|-\n|2016–17\n|Premier League\n|38||0||3||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||42||0\n|-\n|2017–18\n|Premier League\n|19||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||20||0\n|-\n|2018–19\n|Premier League\n|7||1||3||0||2||0||colspan=2|—||12||1\n|-\n|2019–20\n|Premier League\n|29||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||29||0\n|-\n|2020–21\n|Premier League\n|26||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||26||0\n|-\n|2021–22\n|Premier League\n|28||0||3||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||32||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|Premier League\n|28||1||1||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||30||1\n|-\n|2023–24\n|Premier League\n|25||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||25||0\n|-\n|2024–25\n|Premier League\n|2||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||3||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!330!!5!!19!!1!!11!!0!!3!!0!!363!!6\n|-\n!colspan=3|Career total\n!441!!12!!23!!1!!17!!0!!4!!0!!485!!13\n|}\nHonours\nCrystal Palace\n*FA Cup: 2024–25; runner-up 2015–16\n*Football League Championship play-offs: 2013\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cpfc.co.uk/teams/first-team/defender/joel-ward/ Joel Ward profile] at Crystal Palace\n*[http://www.afcb.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10324~44104,00.html Joel Ward profile] at [http://www.afcb.co.uk/ AFCB.co.uk]\n*"
