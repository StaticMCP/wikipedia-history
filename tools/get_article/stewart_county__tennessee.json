As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,657. Its county seat is Dover. Stewart County is part of the Clarksville Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory\nStewart County was created in 1803 from a portion of Montgomery County, and was named for Duncan Stewart, an early settler and state legislator.  The first County Court met in March 1804. According to Goodspeed's history of Stewart County, \"Stewart County was settled principally by North Carolinians, the first of whom came some time about 1795, that State having issued military grants to survivors of the Continental war, which called for large tracts of land lying in this county\". It was settled during the early migration of pioneers from Virginia to the west after the American Revolutionary War. They pushed Native American peoples, such as the Cherokee, out of the area.\nDuring the American Civil War, the Battle of Fort Donelson took place in February 1862. Union forces took control of the state, occupying several strategic areas. In August 1862 their forces partially burned the county seat, Dover, to prevent its re-capture by Confederate Lt. Col. Thomas G. Woodward.  A second battle in the area, commonly called the Battle of Dover, took place in February 1863.\nTobaccoport Saltpeter Cave was intensely mined for saltpeter, possibly during the War of 1812 but more likely not until the Civil War. Saltpeter is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from the cave. The Union took control of Tennessee and this area in February 1862, early in the Civil War. It seems unlikely that mining could have happened before that.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (6.8%) is water. The county lies in a rugged section of the northwestern Highland Rim. The Cumberland River (part of Lake Barkley) traverses the county. The Tennessee River (part of Kentucky Lake) provides the county's border with Henry County to the west.\nFederal and state agencies control nearly 44% of the land in the county.\nUnlike most of Tennessee, a sizable part of northern Stewart County is outside of the Sun Belt due to a past error surveying the northern border of Middle and East Tennessee. The Sun Belt is defined by the Kinder Institute as being south of 36°30'N latitude, which was intended to be the northern border of Tennessee and is the actual northern border of West Tennessee.\nAdjacent counties\n*Trigg County, Kentucky (north)\n*Christian County, Kentucky (northeast)\n*Montgomery County (east)\n*Houston County (south)\n*Benton County (southwest)\n*Henry County (west)\n*Calloway County, Kentucky (northwest)\nNational protected areas\n* Cross Creeks National Wildlife Refuge\n* Fort Donelson National Battlefield (part)\n* Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (part)\nState protected areas\n*Barkley Wildlife Management Area\n*Stewart State Forest\nDemographics\n1790–1960 1900–19901990–2000 2010–2014\n}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+Stewart County racial composition\n!scope=\"col\"| Race\n!scope=\"col\"| Number\n!scope=\"col\"| Percentage\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| White (non-Hispanic)\n| 12,321\n| 90.22%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Black or African American (non-Hispanic)\n| 171\n| 1.25%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Native American\n| 74\n| 0.54%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Asian\n| 76\n| 0.56%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Pacific Islander\n| 2\n| 0.01%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Other/Mixed\n| 677\n| 4.96%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Hispanic or Latino\n| 336\n| 2.46%\n|}\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 13,657 people, 5,178 households, and 3,355 families residing in the county.\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 12,370 people, 4,930 households, and 3,653 families residing in the county.

The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 2.91.\nIn the county, the population was spread out, with 23.90% under the age of 18, 7.50% from 18 to 24, 28.40% from 25 to 44, 25.40% from 45 to 64, and 14.90% who were 65 years of age or older.

From the antebellum period, conservative whites historically voted Democratic, adding to the Southern Block. Residents of eastern Tennessee had been Unionist and supported the Republican Party.\nIn the late 20th century realignment of political parties, many white conservatives shifted into the Republican Party. Before Richard Nixon's campaign in 1972, no Republican had ever won as much as thirty percent of Stewart County's vote, but he won by a landslide in the South. Until 2000, Richard Nixon was the only GOP presidential candidate to gain forty percent of the vote in the country.\nBefore 2000, the Democratic presidential candidate lost Stewart County only in 1968, when segregationist George Wallace ran for the American Independent Party. After that Stewart County was one of only six Wallace counties to support Democratic candidate George McGovern.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Stewart County's voters have increasingly supported Republican candidates in recent presidential elections. In the 2008 presidential election, John McCain received approximately 53.7% of the vote; he was the first Republican to carry the county. For 100 years before that, Stewart County was the sole county in Tennessee that had never voted in majority for a Republican presidential candidate. In 2016, Republican Donald Trump gained a proportion of votes here that was only marginally less than that of the GOP gained in the historically Unionist counties of East Tennessee and the Highland Rim; by 2024 he achieved an eye-popping 81% of the vote, making Kamala Harris's performance the worst ever of all time by a Democrat and the first one to not even hit 19% of Stewart's vote.\nMedia\nRadio stations\n*WTPR-FM 101.7 - \"The Greatest Hits of All Time\"\n*WTPR-AM 710 - \"The Greatest Hits of All Time\"\n*WRQR-FM 105.5 - \"Today's Best Music with Ace & TJ in the Morning\"\nNewspaper\n* [https://www.stewartcountystandard.com/ The Stewart County Standard]\nCommunities\nCity\n*Dover (county seat)\nTowns\n*Cumberland City\n*Tennessee Ridge (mostly in Houston County)\nCensus-designated place\n* Big Rock\nUnincorporated communities\n* Bear Spring\n* Bumpus Mills\n* Indian Mound\n* Leatherwood\nGhost towns\n*Model\n*Tharpe\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Stewart County, Tennessee\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.stewartcogov.com/ Official website]\n* [http://www.stewartcountychamberofcommerce.com/ Stewart County Chamber of Commerce]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130128100556/http://www.stewartcountyschools.net/ Stewart County Schools]\n* [https://www.stewartcountystandard.com/ www.stewartcountystandard.com]\n* [http://www.tngenweb.org/stewart/ TNGenWeb]\n* [http://www.scfr.org Stewart County Fire Rescue]"
