It is one of the 108 Shiva Temples of Kerala and one of the Dwadasha Shivalayam (12 important Shiva temples of ancient Kerala, stretching from Gokarnam to Kanyakumari). It also has a prominent place amongst the numerous Shiva temples in South India. It had the tallest shikhara amongst the temples of its time. The Rajarajeshwara temple has a top of about 90 tonnes.\nLegendarily, it was supposedly renovated by Sage Parashurama, long before the Kali Yuga commenced. Several centuries ago, it was renovated by the Mushika (Kolathiri) dynasty kings. This temple was rebuilt into its present form in the early eleventh century. The quadrangular sanctum has a two-tiered pyramidal roof; in front of the sanctum is the namaskara mandapam, but the temple has no kodi maram (flagstaff), unlike others in Kerala. Only Hindus are permitted to enter.\nLegend and history\nThe Shiva Linga here is believed to be several thousands of years old. Legend has it that Shiva gave 13 sacred Shivalingas to Parvati/Sati to worship. One sage, Maandhata, propitiated Lord Shiva with intense prayers. Shiva was so pleased that he presented one of the Shiva Lingas to him with the injunction that it should be installed only at a place where there was no cremation ground. The sage, after searching all over, found Taliparamba the most sacred spot where he installed the Shiva Linga. After his death the Linga disappeared into the earth. Then his son Muchukunda offered similar prayers to Shiva and got a second Shiva Linga, which too disappeared in course of time. Centuries passed. The third Shiva Linga was handed down to Satasoman, a king of Mushaka/Kolathiri/Chirakkal Royal Family, who then ruled the region. He was an ardent devotee of Shiva. On the advice of sage Agastya, he prayed to Lord Siva, who granted him the Shiva Linga. The king installed it in the present temple built by him. However, as per many legends associated with the Temple, Agastya Himself installed the Shiva Linga (which is believed as per those legends to be a 'Jyothirlingam').\nIt is believed that Sri Rama during his victorious return from Lanka stopped here to offer worship to Lord Shiva. In honor of His presence, devotees are not allowed into the namaskara mandapam even today.\nVisitors\n* Karnataka former chief minister Yeddyurappa visited here several times. He donated an elephant to this temple during one of his visits.\n* Tamil Nadu former chief minister Jayalalithaa had a special relation with this temple.\n* BJP president Amit Shah\nControversies\nIn July 2006, Malayalam actress Meera Jasmine, a Christian, was found to have visited the temple despite the fact that non-Hindus are banned from entry. She later apologised and offered to pay money to perform purification rituals.\nSee also\n* Taliparamba\n* Trichambaram Temple\n* Kapalikkulangara Sree Mahavishnu Temple\n* Madayi Kavu\n* Kalarivathukkal Bhagavathy Temple\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&ie=UTF8&t=k&om=1&msa=0&msid=114038809751246788218.00000112844f7014c63f0&ll=12.046634,75.355933&spn=0.00681,0.008701&z=17 Satellite images of Rajarajeshwara Temple]\n* [http://indiansaga.com/temples/brihadeshwara_temple.html Summary of Brihadeshwara Temple]"
