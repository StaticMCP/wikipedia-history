When hiking and you arrive at a lake, you change into a swimming costume and put your clothes in a waterproof rucksack and you swim across the lake. On the other side you change back into your hiking gear and continue hiking.\nExternal links\n* BBC video [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7534136.stm River deep mountain high]\n* BBC video [https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7567448.stm 'Swimhiker' takes the plunge]\n* The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/05/healthandwellbeing.fitness?gusrc=rss&feed=sport Walking with the fishes]"
