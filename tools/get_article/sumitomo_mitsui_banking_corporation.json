It is headquartered in the same building as SMBC Group in Marunouchi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan.\nSMBC was established in 2001 through the merger of the Sakura Bank, which originated from the Mitsui zaibatsu and was founded as Mitsui Bank in 1876, and The Sumitomo Bank, which originated from the Sumitomo zaibatsu and was founded in 1895.\nDigital banking\nIC cash card\nAn IC cash card is a single cash card that can be used with three method of identification: biometric authentication, IC chip or magnetic stripe, by setting the limit and registering biometric information (finger vein pattern). With this cash card, the security of usage improved since transactions relies on IC chip recording data and the pattern of past transactions that combined IC chip recording data and biometric authentication.\nAs of 2017, SMBC issued IC cash cards at the bank's counters (only applicable to ordinary design deposit cash cards; cards of other designs and non-savings accounts are not eligible for immediate issuance).\nArtificial Intelligence\nSMBC has been an early adopter of AI in its banking operation. It is the first Japanese bank to use IBM Watson since 2014 to support operators at its call center. AmiVoice, a voice recognition solution provided by SMBC, transforms inquiries into text on a real-time basis as a speech recognition system, while IBM Watson gives customers responses taken from service manuals and Q&As, thereby allowing digital operators to provide timely and correct answers to callers.\nSMBC branch in Tokyo Disneyland\nSMBC Tokyo Disneyland Branch\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation is the only bank that has a branch office in Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. The branch is the legacy of Mitsui Bank, which was a member of the Mitsui Group when Oriental Land was established. Tokyo Disney Resort project was done by Mitsui Fudosan.\nThe branch office in Tokyo DisneySea has an unmanned ATM section called \"Nihonbashi Branch Tokyo DisneySea Branch\", but staff are still assigned to the \"Urayasu Branch Tokyo Disneyland Branch\" (store number 593) in Tokyo Disneyland. The operating hours follow normal bank operational time. It was possible to open an account and no limitation of total handled customers, but now it is limited only to Urayasu citizens and related parties. The passbook design and the card design are not different from the one issued by ordinary SMBC's branches and cannot be visually differentiated. Previously, the Disneyland branch office also handled foreign currency exchange.\nNote, SMBC is not a participating company nor official sponsor of Tokyo Disney Resort. For instance, Disney characters have been used by the Bank of Mitsubishi UFJ as an image character for over half a century since it was adopted by Mitsubishi Bank in 1962.\nSee also\n* Loans in Japan\n* List of banks in Japan\n* Financial services in Japan\n* Japanese financial system\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.smbc.co.jp/global/ Official website (in Japanese)]\n* [https://www.smfg.co.jp/english/ Official website (in English)]"
