      "text": "# Warkany syndrome 1\n\nWarkany syndrome 1 was an X-chromosome linked recessive genetic condition originally described by Joseph Warkany in 1961 as part of an article on intrauterine growth retardation - the condition is no longer diagnosed. The family history was consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance of intrauterine growth retardation and small head size, but these features are not unique to this condition and no linkage to a specific gene was ever established.  In fact, the condition appears to have been abandoned, given that the OMIM number ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim?term=308400 308400]) assigned to it ([https://www.nlm.nih.gov/archive/20061212/mesh/jablonski/cgi/jablonski/syndrome_cgi96c9.html?term=Warkany+syndrome+1&field=name]) and listed in a review article on X-linked mental retardation has been removed from the OMIM database. Furthermore, this condition is no longer mentioned in a more recent review of X-linked mental retardation.\nSee also\n* Trisomy 8, which causes Warkany syndrome 2\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/archive/20061212/mesh/jablonski/cgi/jablonski/syndrome_cgi96c9.html?term=Warkany+syndrome+1&field=name U.S. National Library of Medicine: Warkany Syndrome 1]"
