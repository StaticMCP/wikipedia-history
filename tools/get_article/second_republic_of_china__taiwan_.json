      "text": "# Second Republic of China (Taiwan)\n\nIn Taiwan's political history, the term \"Second Republic of China\" () is used in historical research on the Republic of China (Taiwan) and was first proposed by Japanese political scientist ; it may be useful in describing Taiwan's democratization and the \"Taiwanization of the Republic of China.\"\nThe period referred to as \"Second Republic of China\" refers to Taiwan after May 1, 1991; Lee Teng-hui's government abolished Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion annd promulgated the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China. This centered on the Chinese identity and distinguished it from the \"First Republic of China\" () before May 1, 1991, which was Kuomintang's one-party system. The state agency that was established afterwards actually represents the Taiwanese people, not the mainland Chinese, and the legitimacy of the state power's rule also comes from the mandate of the Taiwanese people.\nSee also\n* Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China\n* Huadu (Taiwan)\n* Republic of China on Taiwan\n* Taiwanese nationalism\n* Self-determination\nReferences"
