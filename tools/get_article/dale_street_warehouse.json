It is a Grade II* listed building as of 10 November 1972. It is the earliest surviving canal warehouse in the city. The building is dated 1806 with the initials \"WC\" on the datestone, indicating that it was designed by William Crosley, an engineer who worked with William Jessop on the inner-Manchester canal system.\nConstructed of watershot millstone grit blocks, the four-storey building has timber floors, supported throughout by cast-iron columns, a feature which now makes it unique amongst Manchester warehouses. The base of the building incorporates four boatholes, which allowed boats to unload their cargoes inside of the warehouse. The warehouse also incorporates a \"subterranean wheel-pit containing a 16-foot water-wheel used to drive hoists both in this building and in a former warehouse to the south via a line-shaft tunnel which mostly survives beneath the car-park\".\nFor many years, the building was a shop and was described in 2000 as \"sadly neglected\"; the warehouse has now been converted to office space and a café and renamed Carver's Warehouse.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Manchester-M1\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester\nNotes\n}}\nReferences\n* Pevsner, Nikolaus; Hartwell, Clare & Hyde, Matthew, The Buildings of England: Lancashire - Manchester and the South East (2004) Yale University Press\n* Hartwell, Claire Pevsner Architectural Guides: Manchester (2001) Yale University Press"
