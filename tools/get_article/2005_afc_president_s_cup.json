The eight teams that competed were split into two groups and played each other team in their group once. The winner of each group then played the runner-up in the other group in the semifinals, and the winners of the semifinal matches played in the final match to determine the winner. There was no third-place match. The games were played in May 2005 and were held in Kathmandu, Nepal.\nQualified teams\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Association\n!Team\n!Qualifying method\n|-\n| Bhutan\n|Transport United\n|2004
