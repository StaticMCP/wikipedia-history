SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.\nSFD was established in 2004 and was first observed on 28 August of that year. About 12 teams participated in the first Software Freedom Day. Since that time it has grown in popularity and while organisers anticipated more than 1,000 teams in 2010 the event has stalled at around 400+ locations over the past two years, representing a 30% decrease over 2009.\nSince 2006, Software Freedom Day has been held on the third Saturday of September. In 2025, this event will be held on the 20th of September.\nOrganization\nEach event is left to local teams around the world to organize. Pre-registered teams (2 months before the date or earlier) receive free schwag sent by DFF to help with the events themselves. The [http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org SFD wiki] contains individual team pages describing their plans as well as helpful information to get them up to speed. Events themselves vary between conferences explaining the virtues of Free and Open Source Software, to workshops, demonstrations, games, planting tree ceremonies, discussions and InstallFests.\nPast events\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The maps on the SFD website are only reliable after 2007, however some years such as 2009 saw extra teams from two different sources which did not \"officially\" register with DFF. There was about 80 teams from China and a hundred from the Sun community (OSUM) who heavily subsidized goodies for their teams. In the early year of SFD the map was an optional component not connected with the registration script and therefore some teams did not go through the troubles of adding themselves.\nSponsors\nIn the past, the event has been sponsored by entities like Canonical Ltd., IBM, Sun Microsystems, DKUUG, Google, Red Hat, Linode, Nokia and MakerBot Industries.\n* Sponsorship in 2023: Musescore, Digital Peak\n* Sponsorship in 2024: Huion\n* Sponsorship in 2025: LPI, [https://jensen.technology/ Jensen Technology]\nThis event also has the long term support of Earth Cause, Linode, Mailman, FSF, FSFE, Joomla, Creative Commons, Admin Magazine, Linux Journal, Ubuntu User and Woman Tech.\nEach local team can seek sponsors independently, especially local FOSS supporting organizations, and often appears in local medias such as newspapers and TV.\nSee also\n*Outline of free software\n*Document Freedom Day\n*Hardware Freedom Day\n*Culture Freedom Day\n*Public Domain Day\n*International Day Against DRM, promoted by the Free Software Foundation in its Defective by Design campaign\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.softwarefreedomday.org Software Freedom Day]"
