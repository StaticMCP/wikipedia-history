      "text": "# List of serial killers in the United Kingdom\n\nA serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people, with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them. The British Centre for Crime and Justice Studies defines a serial killer when an individual has killed three or more people who were previously unknown to him or her, with a ‘cooling off’ period between each murder. This definition is accepted by both police and academic experts and therefore provides a useful frame of reference.\nEngland\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!width=\"200px\"|Name!!width=\"100px\"|Years active!!data-sort-type=\"number\"|Proven victims!!data-sort-type=\"number\"|Possible victims!!Status!!Notes!!Ref\n|-\n|Akinmurele, Stephen\n|1995–1998\n|8\n|8\n|Committed suicide before trial\n|Known as \"The Cul-de-sac killer\"; Nigerian immigrant suspected of killing elderly people in Blackpool and the Isle of Man\n|\n|-\n|Allitt, Beverley\n|1991\n|4\n|4\n|Sentenced to life imprisonment\n|Known as \"The Angel of Death\"; Lincolnshire paediatric nurse who killed children in her care\n|\n|-\n|Balls, Jonathan\n|1824–1845\n|22\n|22+\n|Committed suicide prior to identification\n|Poisoned relatives and acquaintances with arsenic in Happisburgh\n|\n|-\n|Bellfield, Levi\n|2002–2004\n|3\n|3+\n|Sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order\n|Known as \"The Bus Stop Stalker\"; convicted of the 2002 murder of Amanda Dowler and two fatal hammer attacks on young women in South West London.\n|\n|-\n|Bierton, Lawrence\n|1995–2023\n|3\n|3\n|Sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order\n|Killed two elderly sisters in Rotherham in 1995.
