It was founded by designers Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick. In 1995, Bengtsson and Pavlick received the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Perry Ellis Award for New Menswear Talent.\nThe duo was known for drawing inspiration from working-class uniforms such as those of lumberjacks, auto racers, and rescue workers. A 1997 Los Angeles Times article noted their fascination with blue-collar aesthetics. In 2001, ''Harper's Bazaar'' described the brand's mission as creating \"laid-back, luxurious clothes that combine menswear quality with a feminine flourish\".\nInitially focusing on menswear, Richard Edwards later expanded to include a women's collection.\nReferences"
