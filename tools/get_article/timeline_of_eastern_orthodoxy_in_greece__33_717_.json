      "text": "# Timeline of Eastern Orthodoxy in Greece (33–717)\n\nThis is a timeline of the presence of Eastern Orthodoxy in Greece from 33 to 717 AD. The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece.\nOverview\nChristianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras; Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop; Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens; Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes; Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus; and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities. Such were the sees of Thessaloniki, Corinth, Nicopolis, Philippi and Athens.\nBy the 4th century almost the entire Balkan peninsula constituted the Exarchate of Illyricum which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Illyricum was assigned to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor in 732. From then on the Church in Greece remained under Constantinople till the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. As an integral part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the church remained under its jurisdiction until Greek independence. Under Ottoman rule, up to \"6,000 Greek clergymen, ca. 100 Bishops, and 11 Patriarchs knew the Ottoman sword\". Bompolines, Κ. Α. (1952). The church in the struggle for freedom. Athens: no publisher given. Paparounis, no date; Perantones, 1972; Pouqueville, 1824; Vaporis, 2000.).\"|group=note}}\nThe Greek War of Independence of 1821–28 created an independent southern Greece, but created anomalies in ecclesiastical relations since the Ecumenical Patriarch remained under Ottoman tutelage, and in 1850 the Endemousa Synod in Constantinople declared the Church of Greece autocephalous.\nThe cultural roots of both Byzantine and modern Greece cannot be separated from Orthodoxy. Therefore, it was natural that in all Greek Constitutions the Orthodox Church was accorded the status of the prevailing religion.\nIn the 20th century, during much of the period of communism, the Church of Greece saw itself as a guardian of Orthodoxy. It cherishes its place as the cradle of the primitive church and the Greek clergy are still present in the historic places of Istanbul and Jerusalem, and Cyprus. The autocephalous Church of Greece is organised into 81 dioceses, however 35 of these – known as the Metropolises of the New Lands – are nominally under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople but are administered as part of the Church of Greece; although the dioceses of Crete, the Dodecanese, and Mount Athos are under the direct jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nThe Archbishop of Athens and All Greece presides over both a standing synod of twelve metropolitans (six from the new territories and six from southern Greece), who participate in the synod in rotation and on an annual basis, and a synod of the hierarchy (in which all ruling metropolitans participate), which meets once a year.\nThe government observes several religious holidays as national holidays including Epiphany, Clean Monday (the start of Great Lent), Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, Holy Spirit Day, the Dormition of the Theotokos and Christmas.\nAmong the current concerns of the Church of Greece are the Christian response to globalization, to interreligious dialogue, and a common Christian voice within the framework of the European Union.\nThe population of Greece is 11.4 million (2011), of which 95% to 98% are Greek Orthodox.\nThe early church in Greece (33–325)\nApostolic era (33–100)\n, Apostle of Greece and Cyprus.]]\n*c. 45–46 Apostle Pauls mission to Cyprus, where he converts proconsul Quintus Sergius Paullus.\n*c. 49 Paul's mission to Philippi, Thessaloniki and Veria;

When, for example, during the Avar-Slav siege of September 586, the city was about to fall, John related that a high-ranking civilian dreamt that he saw two angels dressed as imperial guardsmen enter Demetrius' shrine and demand that he quit the city because God had ordered Thessalonica's destruction. But the saint resisted, telling the angels that the city's fate would be his: either God would relent when he heard the Saint's prayers, or he would 'perish' with the city. Shortly thereafter the city was saved and the efficacy of Demetrius' intercessions manifested. Indeed, the man who had the dream was certain that it was Demetrius who had saved the city because the figure he saw in the vision matched exactly 'the form in which he is represented in his ancient images'.\"|group=note}}\n*c. 590 Parthenon in Athens converted into a Christian church dedicated to Agia Sophia.\n*594 Evagrius Scholasticus writes Ecclesiastical History, covering the years 431 to 594 AD.\n*602 Final series of wars between Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Empire.\n*610 Heraclius changes official language of the Empire from Latin to Greek, already the lingua franca of the vast majority of the population.\n*c. 611 Andreas of Caesarea, Bp. of Caesarea in Cappadocia, writes the first Greek Patristic commentary on the Book of Revelation.\n', divine protectress of the Byzantine Empire (7th century).]]\n*612 Holy Sponge and Holy Lance brought to Constantinople from Palestine.\n*617 Persian Army conquers Chalcedon after a long siege.\n*620 Slavs attack Thessaloniki.\n*626 'Akathist Hymn (Chairetismoi) to the Virgin Mary' written, after Constantinople liberated from a siege of 80,000 Avars, Slavs and the Persian fleet.\n*627 Emperor Heraclius decisively defeats Sassanid Persians at Battle of Nineveh, recovering True Cross and breaking power of the Sassanid dynasty.\n*630 Second Elevation of the Holy Cross, on 21 March 630 AD, when Emperor Heraclius entered Jerusalem amidst great rejoicing, and together with Patriarch Zacharios (609–633), transferred the Cross of Christ with great solemnity into the temple of the Resurrection; it is the only time a Byzantine emperor sets foot in the Holy Land.\n*632 Christian influences on Islamic practice include veiling of women, hospitality for monastic travellers, prostrations, facing east for prayer, fixed hours for daily office of prayer, ritual ablutions before worship.\n*633 Death of Patr.
