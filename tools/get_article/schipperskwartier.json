Located just north of the historic center and close to the old port, it has been associated with prostitution and maritime trade for centuries. In recent decades, it has been the focus of significant urban redevelopment and legal reforms aimed at improving the safety and regulation of sex work.\nHistory\nThe name \"Schipperskwartier\" (literally \"Skippers’ Quarter\") reflects the area's historical connection with sailors and dockworkers. Since at least the 19th century, it has been a hub for nightlife, bars, and sex work, catering to the nearby port population.\nDuring the 1990s, the area became increasingly notorious for organized crime and human trafficking, with a notable increase in sex workers from Eastern Europe. The murder of a 17-year-old Romanian girl in 1999, later attributed to an Albanian human trafficking ring, sparked national outcry and led to intensified law enforcement efforts.\nUrban Renewal\nIn 1999, the city of Antwerp launched a major urban renewal initiative to improve safety and living conditions in Schipperskwartier. This included the creation of a designated \"tolerance zone\" for prostitution and the construction of Villa Tinto, a modern complex designed to regulate and monitor sex work. The €10 million building includes biometric access, panic buttons, and health services.\nLegal Context\nIn 2022, Belgium became the first European country to fully decriminalize sex work, allowing sex workers to register as self-employed and gain access to labor protections. The Schipperskwartier became a focal point for this new legal framework, with authorities continuing to combat illegal trafficking while promoting safer working environments.\nPublic Perception\nWhile the area has seen a decline in street crime and an increase in police presence, Schipperskwartier remains controversial. Local residents express mixed opinions—some highlight the improvement in cleanliness and order, while others remain wary of its reputation.\nIn popular culture\nIn 2025, the theatre company Het Achterland announced a summer comedy titled *'t Schipperskwartier*, set in the 1990s within the district. The play centers on Thierry and Marleen, owners of a bridal boutique struggling to attract clientele due to the neighborhood's reputation. They receive unexpected assistance from their neighbor Sonja, a sex worker familiar with the area's dynamics. The production features a cast including Ludo Hoogmartens, Myriam Bronzwaar, Charline Catrysse, Maarten Bosmans, and Ludo Hellinx, with Julie Daems joining later. The play is scheduled to premiere on 4 July 2025 at the Fakkeltheater in Antwerp.\nCoordinates\nThe geographic center of Schipperskwartier is located at:\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241753126_Global_pressures_local_measures_The_re-regulation_of_sex_work_in_the_Antwerp_Schipperskwartier \"Global Pressures, Local Measures\"] – Academic paper on the regulation of sex work in Schipperskwartier\n* [https://www.antwerpen.be/nl/overzicht/stadsvernieuwing/nieuws/villa-tinto City of Antwerp – Villa Tinto overview] (in Dutch)"
