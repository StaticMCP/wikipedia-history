S. Lewis's 1950 fantasy novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which aired on ITV in 1967.\nBackground\nThe series was produced by Pamela Lonsdale and adapted for television by Trevor Preston.  Original music was provided by Paul Lewis and the programme, and the costumes, were designed by Neville Green.  The programme was made for the ITV network by ABC Weekend TV.  The animals were all portrayed by actors in costume, not unlike the later BBC adaptation.  Only two episodes, the first and eighth, are known to still survive today. An audio recording of episode 7 also survives.\nMain cast\n* Zuleika Robson - Susan\n* Liz Crowther - Lucy\n* Jack Woolgar - Professor\n* Paul Waller - Peter\n* Edward McMurray - Edmund\n* Elizabeth Wallace - The White Witch\n* George Claydon - Ginarrbrik\n* Susan Field - Mrs. Beaver\n* Jimmy Gardner - Mr. Beaver\n* Bernard Kay - Aslan\n* Robert Booth - Maugrim\n* Angus Lennie - Mr. Tumnus\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
