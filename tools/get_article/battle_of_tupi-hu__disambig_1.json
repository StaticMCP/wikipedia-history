It was a Brazilian victory despite a Paraguayan advantage in numbers.\nThe allied army was advancing slowly in central Paraguay and gearing up to resume campaigning against the reorganized Paraguayan army which had been mostly destroyed during the Pikysyry campaign some months earlier. A Brazilian unit had been tasked with finding a Paraguayan column operating near the Jejuí Guazú river, which it proceeded to engage and defeat.\nEngagement\nAs the allied armies advanced through the hills of Central Paraguay, chasing Paraguayan president López's remaining forces after the bloody Pikysyry campaign, intelligence was obtained indicating that a Paraguayan column, 1,200 men strong, was stationed on the eastern shore of the Jejuí Guazú river, a position oblique to the axis the allies were advancing at. The allied commander, Gaston, Count of Eu, ordered a detachment to attack it on the 17th of May, composed by men from the 2nd Cavalry Division and the 10th Cavalry Brigade, together with an infantry battalion and two guns, totalling 500 troops, under general Câmara.\nAware of this movement, the Paraguayan column withdrew on the 21st, however, and some days later reached Tupí-hú, a pass on the . On May 30 the Imperial army arrived, and by 10&nbsp;a.m. battle had begun with the Brazilian artillery firing against the Paraguayan troops, which had assumed a position on the dry river bed. Lieutenant Colonel Galeano's}} troops were anchored on the right by a forest and on the left by a swamp on which a trench had been dug. A swift Brazilian attack, under rain, which made the Paraguayan matchlocks unable to fire, and supported by artillery fire and cavalry flanking attacks managed to defeat the defenders quickly, leaving 500 dead and 350 prisoners on the Paraguayan side, amongst them many children and teenagers; the Brazilians suffered 126 casualties. Reportedly, 800 prisoners were made on the action, but most of these were slain afterwards. 18 guns, gold and silver, thousands of head of cattle and more than 3,000 women were also captured after the battle.\nLieutenant Colonel Galeano, one of the few Paraguayans who managed to escape, was executed for cowardice after being captured by Paraguayan forces later.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
