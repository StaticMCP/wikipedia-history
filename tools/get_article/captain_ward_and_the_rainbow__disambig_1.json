It recounts a tale of the pirate Captain Ward, likely Jack Ward.\nSynopsis\nThe king sends a ship, the Rainbow, after Captain Ward. In one variant, the ship carries 500 seamen, in another it carries 1,300. Ward defeats the Rainbow and sends taunts back to the king, \"If he reign king of all the land, I will reign king at sea.\" In many variants, Ward claims to have never harmed an English ship.\nLyrics\nCome all you gallant seamen bold,\nAll you that march to drum,\nLet's go and look for Captain Ward,\nFar on the sea he roams;\nHe is the biggest robber\nThat ever you did hear,\nThere's not been such a robber found\nFor above this hundred year.\nA ship was sailing from the east\nAnd going to the west,\nLoaded with silks and satins\nAnd velvets of the best,\nBut meeting there with Captain Ward,\nIt proved a bad meeting;\nHe robbèd them of all their wealth\nAnd bid them tell their king.\nO then the king provided a ship of noble fame,\nShe's call'd the \"Royal Rainbow,\"\nIf you would know her name;\nShe was as well provided for\nAs any ship could be,\nFull thirteen hundred men on board\nTo bear her company.\n'Twas eight o' clock in the morning\nWhen they began to fight,\nAnd so they did continue there\nTill nine o' clock at night.\n\"Fight on, fight on,\" says Captain Ward,\n\"This sport well pleases me,\nFor if you fight this month or more,\nYour master I will be.\"\nO then the gallant \"Rainbow\"\nShe fired, she fired in vain,\nTill six and thirty of her men\nAll on the deck were slain.\n\"Go home, go home,\" says Captain Ward,\n\"And tell your king from me,\nIf he reigns king on all the land,\nWard will reign king on sea!\"\nSee also\n* List of the Child Ballads\n* Scottish mythology\n* English folklore\nMusical adaptations\n* The song was set for four-part chorus (TTBB) by Ralph Vaughan Williams in Folk Songs from the Eastern Counties (1912).  Williams had previously (1906) made use of the melody in his Norfolk Rhapsodies.\n* Being a well-documented song and publicised by English Folk Dance and Song Society, The Broadside Ballads Project, and Mainly Norfolk, the song was recorded by Jon Boden and Oli Steadman for inclusion in their respective lists of daily folk songs \"A Folk Song A Day\" and \"365 Days Of Folk\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch287.htm Captain Ward and the Rainbow]"
