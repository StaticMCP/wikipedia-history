It was the first and only national anthem of a unified Korean state to date.\nHistory\nThe national anthem was first commissioned by Emperor Gojong in 1901 and presented to the Korean court on 1 July 1902, by German composer Franz Eckert, who was the director of the Korean Empire's military band at the time. It was published in Germany in five different languages (Korean, German, English, Chinese, and French) and performed for the first time on 9 September 1902, during Emperor Gojong's birthday ceremony.\nThe imminent demise of the Korean Empire's independence, however, meant that the state anthem did not become widely promulgated or available. With the signing of the Eulsa Treaty in 1905, the Korean Empire was made into a colony of the Empire of Japan and in 1910 was annexed outright by Japan with \"Kimigayo\" replacing the Korean national anthem.\nLyrics (monarchist version)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Original Korean !! English !! Modern Korean translation\n|-\n|\n|\nMay God save our emperor.\nLong live the emperor\nWhile hermits raise their houses with yearly coming twigs.\nKeeping his power and influence on the world\nMay his happiness forever be renewed for fifty million years.\nMay God save our emperor.\n|\n상제여, 우리 황제를 도우소서.\n성수무강하사\n해옥주를 산같이 쌓으시고\n위세와 권력이 천하에 떨치사\n오천만 국민에게 새롭게 번영이 있게 하소서.\n상제여, 우리 황제를 도우소서.\n|}\nIt was the original version made for Emperor Gojong.\nLyrics (republican version)\nThe republican lyrics were re-discovered on 13 August 2004, by curator Lee Dong-guk of the Seoul Calligraphy Art Museum. The surviving specimen was a copy kept by the Korean-American Club of Honolulu-Wahiawa and published in 1910 under the title Korean old national hymn in English and  () in Korean.\nThe discovery came as a surprise even in South Korea, where the existence of the republican lyrics was unknown until then. The finding was later reported in the mass media and has since then been performed by various K-pop artists. Hawaii has been a source for various pre-Japanese annexation heritage investigations by South Korea since many Korean Empire citizens emigrated to Hawaii before the Japanese annexation. One recent incident involved a Korean Empire émigré descendant donating a very rare 100-plus-year-old original passport issued by the Korean Empire to South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun during his visit to Hawaii.\nThe republican lyrics are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
