Thus he was the nephew of both  Sir Edward Synge-Hutchinson and Lieutenant General Coote Synge-Hutchinson.\nBrown was educated at Edinburgh Academy and the United Services College. He entered the Army as a Lieutenant in the 18th Hussars on 7 November 1883.  On 27 March 1889, he joined the 14th King's Hussars. From 1 January 1890 to 31 December 1894, he was Commandant of the Aldershot School of Instruction for Yeomanry.\nBrown had achieved the rank of major when the 14th King's Hussars were mobilised for active service on 9 October 1899 for service in the Second Boer War. They had been stationed at Newbridge in Ireland, and arrived in South Africa in January 1900. As a result of his courage under fire, he was awarded the Victoria Cross.  He was also mentioned twice in dispatches: on 29 November 1900 by Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief during the early part of the war and on 8 April 1902 by Lord Kitchener C-i-C during the latter part of the war\nBrown left Cape Town for the United Kingdom in early May 1902, shortly before the end of the war, part of a detachment to attend the Coronation of King Edward VII. He received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902.\nIn 1904 he took the name (but was not able to inherit the title) of his maternal uncle, Sir Edward Synge-Hutchinson, to become Edward Douglas Brown-Synge-Hutchinson VC.\nIn November 1906 he was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel, took command of the 14th Hussars in February 1907, and was simultaneously made a lieutenant colonel, and so served until February 1911.\nAfter relinquishing command of the regiment he was promoted to colonel and placed on half-pay. In November that year he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He retired from the military in 1915.\nBrown died in London at the age of 78.}}\nThe medal\nHis Victoria Cross is currently not on display, but is housed at HorsePower- The King's Royal Hussars Museum, Winchester, Hampshire, England.\nArms\nNo crest or motto were recorded.}}\nReferences\n*Irish Winners of the Victoria Cross (Richard Doherty & David Truesdale, 2000)\n*Monuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999)\n*The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997)\n*Victoria Crosses of the Anglo-Boer War (Ian Uys, 2000)\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090623050143/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/golders.htm Location of grave and VC medal] (Golders Green)\n*[http://www.angloboerwar.com/medals-and-awards/12-victoria-cross/171-browne-edward-douglas AngloBoerwar.com]"
