It is named after its most famous member, Constantine the Great, who became the sole ruler of the empire in 324. The dynasty is also called Neo-Flavian because every Constantinian emperor bore the name Flavius, similarly to the rulers of the first Flavian dynasty in the 1st century.\nStemmata\nIn italics the augusti and the augustae.\n* Constantius I\n*# From relationship between Constantius I and Helena\n*#* Constantine I\n*#*# From marriage between Constantine I and Minervina\n*#*#* Crispus\n*#*# From marriage between Constantine I and Fausta\n*#*#* Constantina, wife of Hannibalianus and Constantius Gallus\n*#*#* Constantine II\n*#*#* Constantius II\n*#*#*#No offspring from marriage between Constantius II and his first wife, daughter of Julius Constantius\n*#*#*#No offspring from marriage between Constantius II and Eusebia\n*#*#*#From marriage between Constantius II and Faustina\n*#*#*#*Constantia, wife of Gratian\n*#*#* Constans I\n*#*#* Helena, wife of Julian\n*# From marriage between Constantius Chlorus and Theodora\n*#*Flavius Dalmatius\n*#*# From marriage between Flavius Dalmatius and unknown wife\n*#*#* Flavius Dalmatius\n*#*#* Hannibalianus, husband of Constantina\n*#*Julius Constantius\n*#*# From marriage between Julius Constantius and Galla\n*#*#* son, died in the purges of 337\n*#*#* daughter, first wife of Constantius II\n*#*#* Constantius Gallus\n*#*#*# No offspring from marriage between Gallus and Constantina\n*#*# From marriage between Julius Constantius and Basilina\n*#*#* Julian\n*#*#*# No offspring from marriage between Julian and Helena, daughter of Constantine I\n*#* Hannibalianus (must have died before the imperial purges that occurred in 337 because he is not listed among its victims);\n*#*Anastasia;\n*#* Flavia Julia Constantia, wife of Licinius\n*#*#* Licinius II\n*#*Eutropia\n*#*#*Nepotianus\nFamily tree\nEmperors are shown with a rounded-corner border with their dates as Augusti, names with a thicker border appear in both sections\n'''1: Constantine's parents and half-siblings\n|boxstyle_CGOTH=border:2px solid; border-radius:1em}}\n|boxstyle_CCHLO=border:2px solid; border-radius:1em|THEO1=Flavia Maximiana Theodora}}\n|boxstyle_CONST=border:3px solid; border-radius:1em|FLAVD=Flavius Dalmatius|HANN1=Hannibalianus|CONS2=Flavia Julia Constantia|LICI1=|boxstyle_LICI1=border:2px solid; border-radius:1em|ANAST=Anastasia|BASSI=Bassianus}}\n|boxstyle_JULIA=border:3px solid; border-radius:1em|HELE2=Helena|boxstyle_HELE2=border:3px solid|NEPO2=Nepotianus}}\n2: Constantine's children'\n|boxstyle_CONST=border:3px solid; border-radius:1em|FAUS1=Fausta}}\n|boxstyle_CONS3=border:2px solid; border-radius:1em|CONS5=|boxstyle_CONS5=border:2px solid; border-radius:1em|HANN2=Hannibalianus|boxstyle_HANN2=border:3px solid|CONS6=Constantina|boxstyle_CONS6=border:3px solid|GALLU=Constantius Gallus|boxstyle_GALLU=border:3px solid}}\n|boxstyle_CONS4=border:2px solid; border-radius:1em|JULIA=|boxstyle_JULIA=border:3px solid;  border-radius:1em|HELE2=Helena|boxstyle_HELE2=border:3px solid}}\n|boxstyle_GRATI=border:2px solid; border-radius:1em|CONS7=Constantia}}\nRelationship to other tetrarchs\nOther rulers of the tetrarchy were related to the Constantinian dynasty:\n*Maximian: adoptive father and father-in-law of Constantius Chlorus, father-in-law of Constantine, grandfather-in-law of Licinius\n*Maxentius: adoptive brother and brother-in-law of Constantius Chlorus, brother-in-law of Constantine\n*Licinius: son-in-law of Constantius Chlorus, half-brother-in-law of Constantine\nEastern Roman dynasties that linked themselves to Constantinians\n*Valentinians (through marriage)\n*Theodosians (through marriage)\n*Palaiologos\n*Komnenos\n*Doukas\n*Phokas\nNotes\nReferences\n*[http://www.roman-emperors.org/nfstem.htm R.
