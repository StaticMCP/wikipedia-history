Its  are covered with a mix of oak-hickory and pine forest. Dominant tree species include oaks (white, chestnut, black, northern red, southern red and scarlet), hickories (mockernut and pignut), yellow poplar, red maple, and pines (loblolly, shortleaf, and Virginia). It is the largest state forest in Virginia.\nHistory\nThe forest was originally farmland that was intensively used until the 1930s. At that point in time, the land was depleted and the United States Government purchased it as part of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. In 1954, the tract of land was turned over to Virginia, creating the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest. Many homesteads from the former farmers can be found in the forest. The Virginia Department of Forestry continues to work to transition the regenerating forest to a mixed ecosystem.\nRecreation\nThe Carter-Taylor Trail is a  loop trail open for walking, hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking. All motorized vehicles are prohibited on the trail. The forest also has various gated trails and forest roads that can be used. Boating, fishing, and hunting are all allowed in the forest.\nHolliday Lake State Park is surrounded by the forest. The park offers camping, picnicking, swimming, boating, and hiking. Permanent campsites are installed inside the park.\nSee also\n*List of Virginia state forests\n*List of Virginia state parks\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.dof.virginia.gov/stateforest/list/absf.htm Virginia Department of Forestry: Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest]"
