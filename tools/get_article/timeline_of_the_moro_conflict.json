      "text": "# Timeline of the Moro conflict\n\nThis is a chronology of the Moro conflict, a low level conflict in the southern Philippines, involving jihadist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf Group, the Maute Group, Jemaah Islamiyah, and Islamic State affiliates, mainstream separatist groups such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), and the Philippine Government since 1971. Much of the fighting has been concentrated on the island of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, with spillover incidents and attacks occurring in the Philippine capital Manila and neighboring countries such as Malaysia.\nAs of 2019, the conflict has ended between separatist groups, but the Islamic State Insurgency continues.\n1960s\n1968\n* May – The Muslim (later Mindanao) Independence Movement (MIM), a secessionist organization, is launched by its would-be chairman, newly retired Cotabato governor Datu Udtog (or Udtug) Matalam, to campaign for an independent Islamic Republic comprising Mindanao, Palawan and Sulu Archipelago.\n1969\n* Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the country's major Muslim group, is founded by Nur Misuari. Its first members are the youth recruited by traditional leaders for military training in Malaysia. Misuari has decided to fight for an independent Bangsamoro homeland as a result of the 1968 Jabidah massacre, but their original objective is later reduced to accepting autonomy within the country, being under pressure from the Organization of Islamic Conference. Its armed group is Bangsa Moro Army. By 2000, it has main bases, from Zamboanga Peninsula to parts of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and the Soccsksargen.\n* Hashim Salamat establishes the organization Nurul Islam to promote Islamic renewal in Cotabato. Both Salamat and his organization are aligned with the MIM by 1970.\n1970s\n1971\n* 19 June – Suspected members of an extremist Christian group Ilagas (\"Rats\") storm in a mosque in Carmen, Cotabato, where Moslems are waiting for a scheduled conference between the warring communities, and gun them down. At least 65 Moslems, including 13 children and 29 women, are killed.\n1972\n* 28 June – early July – Bands of Moslem Barracudas, reportedly travelling by motorized boats from the Sulu Archipelago to southwestern Mindanao, raid coastal villages in Zamboanga del Sur; particularly about 100 in two villages in Mabuhay and one in Dimataling. A total of 58–67 Christians are reported massacred; another hundred are injured. The attacks are an apparent reprisal for the killing of Moslems by Ilagas in the province.\n** Early July – Raiders enter Dimataling, hack the Christian mayor to death, and kill two policemen and six soldiers.\n* 21 September – President Ferdinand Marcos imposes martial law; its principal reasons are the existence of armed conflict between Muslims and Christians and a Muslim \"secessionist movement\" in the country's south. However, in fact, within months prior, neither serious incidents of sectarian violence nor activities by the MIM have been reported; the imposition results in an armed Muslim insurgency against the state, and leads to hostilities in Muslim Mindanao.\n* Mid-October:\n** Marcos announces being prepared to deploy all troops in the country's south to \"annihilate\" outlaws if all guns would not be surrendered prior to 25 October deadline.\n** Marawi, Lanao del Sur, is attacked by more than 400 armed Maranaos who would be defeated by army forces after three days.\n* Late October – Fighting begins between Muslim rebels and government soldiers in Cotabato.\n* November – Marcos sends thousands of troops to Mindanao. By month's end, fierce clashes with separatist rebels are occurring throughout the country's south.\n* 27 November – An encounter occurs in a hill on Jolo island; government forces suffer defeat.\n* 24 December – A Philippine Air Force C-47 with a crew of seven is shot down by Moslem dissidents during a fighting in southern Sulu.\n* 26 December – The military reports that since September, at least 46 soldiers and 92 Moslem dissidents have been killed, and there are half a million refugees in areas of Mindanao, in the ongoing fighting.\n* Late December – A military strike force overruns a rebel training camp in eastern Mindanao with 40 rebels killed.\n* 28 December – Government troops attacks the guerrilla stronghold on Jolo island; military's victory reported. Officials report at least 14 troops are killed and more than 20 are wounded.\n* 30 December:\n** A government patrol kills 25 rebels in Basilan City, Zamboanga del Sur.\n** Military forces captures Sibalo Hill on Jolo island, used as training camp an command post by Moslem rebels, after a massive assault.\n* As political groups are banned, martial law causes the dissolution of aboveground organizations as the MIM and Nurul Islam. The underground MNLF is then activated, and will be involved in the developing insurgency by yearend.\n* 2 January:\n** President Marcos calls a peace conference with about 200 Moslem leaders to forge a peace alliance between the national government and minority Filipino Moslems in Mindanao and Sulu. He likewise plans a next day's conference with 170 leaders to explain his order allowing barter trade between the country's south and Borneo.\n** The military announces that in the past two weeks, fighting has resulted in the deaths of 38 Moslem dissidents and 10 government troops in 12 encounters.\n1973\n* By that year, the entire core leadership of the MNLF is operating from abroad. Misuari has left Manila after the imposition of martial law, fleeing to Sabah and to Libya.\n1974\n* By that year, the MNLF central committee has almost all of its members in Tripoli, Libya. Its chairman and vice-chairman are Misuari and Salamat, respectively. Immediately after the start of martial law, Salamat and his companions are forced underground when Datu Udtug signs an \"affidavit\" against them, which is turned over to the Philippine Army; shortly, the group joins forces with Misuari, and Salamat goes to Tripoli. Meanwhile, Abul Khayr Alonto, member of a prominent Maranao family, is the overall field commander of the Bangsa Moro Army, being among the few top leaders to remain in the country.

The MNLF is represented by its spokesmen, Hashim Salamat of Cotabato, and Hdul Hamid Lukman, a former judge in Maimbung, Sulu. Neither their departure nor the meeting is announced by the national government; the news on the fighting is not reported by the government-controlled media.\n* 9 March – The military reports that an attack is launched against Moslem insurgents—an estimated 4,000—in northeast Basilan, while a clash in Jolo, Sulu, results in the deaths of three soldiers and four civilians.
