It was filmed on Library Place, Princeton, New Jersey, with residents of the home of Ellwood and Shirley Kauffman receiving credits for their work. Business-manager-to be Scott Kauffman made a cameo appearance as the younger version of de Souza's character, Kenny.\nSynopsis\nFrom the film's promotional materials:\nReception\nThe film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1972 Atlanta Film Festival.  It was released in a few venues the following September, with promotion and advertising all but absent when the film's distributor went into bankruptcy at the same time.\nThe soundtrack by the band Adom, released on East Coast Records, has become something of a cult collectible, and the \"Marijuana!\" cut (with the lyrics simply being repetitions of that one word) was frequently played on the Dr. Demento radio show.\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1973\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
