The electoral system was introduced in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15. Kalinga, 16. Park Street, 17. Victoria Terrace, 18. Hastings, 19. Entali, 20. Beniapukur, 21. Baliganj-Tollyganj, 22. Bhabanipur, 23. Alipur, 24.Ekbalpur and 25. Watganj. A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888, the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there, but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.\nAs per KMC sources, the adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpore and Manicktola were amalgamated with Kolkata in 1923.\nThe state government superseded the Corporation in 1948, and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. The adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144.\nGeography\nWard No. 2 is bordered on the north by Kalicharan Ghosh Road and Ramkrishna Ghosh Road; on the east by the Eastern Railway line; on the south by Dum Dum Road; and on the west by Barrackpore Trunk Road.\nThe ward is served by the Sinthee police station of Kolkata Police.\nAmherst Street Women police station covers all police districts under the jurisdiction of the North and North Suburban division of Kolkata Police, i.e. Amherst Street, Jorabagan, Shyampukur, Cossipore, Chitpur, Sinthi, Burtolla and Tala.\nDemographics\nAs per the 2011 Census of India Ward No. 2, Kolkata Municipal Corporation had a total population of 48,190, of which 24,381 (51%) were males and 23,809 (49%) were females. Population below 6 years was 2,575. The total number of literates in Ward No. 2 was 42,986 (94.24% of the population over 6 years).\nKolkata is the second most literate district in West Bengal.
