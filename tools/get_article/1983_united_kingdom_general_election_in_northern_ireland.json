This was an increase of five seats, after the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1979 had come into effect to account for the reduced representation after direct rule had been imposed since 1972. New constituencies were drawn up in 1982.\nResults summary\nThe Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher as prime minister won another term in government.\nThe main beneficiaries of the increase of seats was the Ulster Unionist Party, now led by James Molyneaux. The SDLP lost a seat held by former leader Gerry Fitt to Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin, but the new SDLP leader John Hume gained a seat.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+Results\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party\n! colspan=\"5\" |Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" |Aggregate Votes\n|-\n!
