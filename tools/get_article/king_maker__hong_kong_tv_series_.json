King Maker started its broadcast on Hong Kong's Jade and HD Jade channels on 13 August 2012.\nPlot\nSong dynasty's first prince Kwai Sing (Pierre Ngo) and second prince Kwai Wo (Lai Lok-yi) greedily compete for the throne. Yu Jing (Wayne Lai) and Tung Chiu (Kent Cheng) are responsible in advising each prince. Jing and Chiu are old family friends, having a mentor-friend relationship.\nJing's father Yu Pok Man (KK Cheung) brought trouble to the family when his achievements made his advisor feel uneasy. Since then, Jing was separated from his younger brother Yu Tsing (Patrick Tang) and sister Yu Ching (Natalie Tong). Tsing was deceived into becoming an imperial eunuch, while Ching loses her memory, but fortunately triad leader Fan Chiu Lun (Shek Sau) adopts her and triad member Yim Sam Leung (Kristal Tin) takes care of her.\nBig villain Yeung Chi San (Joseph Lee) and his sister Consort Wai cause much trouble to get Kwai Wo the throne instead. But, perhaps San and Wai are not the only villains, and there are many others that are much more evil...\nCast and characters\nRoyal court\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=\"center\"\n|style=\"width:6%\"|Name||style=\"width:6%\"|Actor/actress||style=\"width:15%\"|Background\n|-\n|Emperor Ning-chung (宋寧宗)||Kwok Fung||EmperorHas health problems beginning from Episode 26\n|-\n|Empress Gung-shuk (恭淑皇后)||Kingdom Yuen||EmpressMother of Chiu Kwai-singPoisoned by Tung Chiu in Episode 27\n|-\n|Consort Wai (慧妃)||Florence Kwok||Mother of Chiu Kwai-woYeung Chi-san's younger sister(Villainess)Exiled in Episode 28\n|-\n|Consort Yee (儀妃)||Rachel Kan||Killed by Tung Chiu in Episode 27\n|-\n|Chiu Kwai-sing (趙貴誠)||Pierre Ngo||Crown PrinceBecomes Emperor in Episode 28\n|-\n|Chiu Kwai-wo (趙貴和)||Lai Lok-yi||Second Prince(Villain)Exiled in Episode 28\n|-\n|Consort Tak (德妃)||Vivien Yeo||Chiu Kwai-sing's wife(Semi-Villain)\n|-\n|Fan Hung-ying (樊紅纓) Consort Lai (麗妃)||Natalie Tong||Chiu Kwai-sing's concubine(Further information: #Yu Family)\n|-\n|Consort Man (閔妃)||Janet Chow||Chiu Kwai-wo's wifeExiled in Episode 28\n|}\nYu Family\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=\"center\"\n|style=\"width:6%\"|Name||style=\"width:6%\"|Actor/actress||style=\"width:15%\"|Background\n|-\n|Yu Bok-man (余博文)||KK Cheung||ChancellorFather of Yu Jing, Yu Tsing, and Yu Ching\n|-\n|Yu Jing (余靖)||Wayne Lai||Chancellor, kingmakerYu Bok-man's eldest sonTung Yuk-kiu's ex-fiancéLoves Yim Sam-leung\n|-\n|Sheung Hei (常喜)||Patrick Tang||Born Yu Tsing (余清)Eunuch, Consort Wai's confidantYu Bok-man's second sonCommitted Suicide in Episode 26\n|-\n|Fan Hung-ying (樊紅纓)||Natalie Tong||Born Yu Ching (余晴)Yu Bok-man's youngest daughterChiu Kwai-sing's concubineBecomes Empress in Episode 28\n|}\nTung Family\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=\"center\"\n|style=\"width:6%\"|Name||style=\"width:6%\"|Actor/actress||style=\"width:15%\"|Background\n|-\n|Tung Chiu (董昭)||Kent Cheng||ChancellorFather of Yuk-kiu and Ming-hin(Main antagonist)Turns partially insane when a coup d'état attempt of his fails, resulting in his exile\n|-\n|Tung Yuk-kiu (董玉喬)||Elaine Yiu||Eldest daughter of Tung ChiuYu Jing's ex-fiancéDies in Episode 28\n|-\n|Tung Ming-hin (董明軒)||Eric Li||Son of Tung Chiu(Villain)Dies in Episode 28\n|}\nFan Family\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=\"center\"\n|style=\"width:6%\"|Name||style=\"width:6%\"|Actor/actress||style=\"width:15%\"|Background\n|-\n|Fan Chiu-lun (樊照麟)\nPreviously known as Pang Kwok-chu\n||Shek Sau||Former triad leader(Villain)Dies in Episode 28\n|-\n|Yim Sam-leung (嚴三娘)||Kristal Tin||Triad leaderSacrificed herself to save Yu Jing and died in Episode 24\n|-\n|Fan Hung-ying (樊紅纓)||Natalie Tong||Fan Chiu-lun's adopted daughterFurther information: Yu Family\n|-\n| (惠　蘭)||Angel Chiang||Fan Hung-ying's personal attendantIntroduced in Ep.06\n|}\nYeung Family\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=\"center\"\n|style=\"width:6%\"|Name||style=\"width:6%\"|Actor/actress||style=\"width:15%\"|Background\n|-\n|Yeung Chi-shan (楊次山)||Joseph Lee||Chancellor(Villain)\nExecuted in Episode 19\n|-\n|Consort Wai (慧妃)||Florence Kwok||Yeung Chi-san's younger sister(Villain)Further information: Royal court\n|-\n|Yip Yeuk-mei (葉若媚)||Meini Cheung||Yeung Chi-san's concubine\n|-\n|Wan Chi-kwan (溫子君)||Kibby Lau||Yeung Chi-san's concubine\n|-\n|Tung Yuk-kiu (董玉喬)||Elaine Yiu||Yeung Chi-san's concubineFurther information: Tung Family\n|-\n|Yeung Kuk (楊谷)||Sammy Sum||GeneralYeung Chi-san's son\n|}\nProduction\nDevelopment\nThe drama began in development in early 2011, and announced their intentions to cast Kent Cheng and Wayne Lai, who had previously worked together in Leung Choi-yuen's The Greatness of a Hero in 2008.
