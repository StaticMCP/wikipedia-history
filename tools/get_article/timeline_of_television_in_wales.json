It does not include events that affect the whole UK.\n1950s\n* 1952\n** 15 August – Television becomes available in Wales for the first time following the switching on of the Wenvoe transmitting station.\n* 1956\n** 14 October – The Blaenplwyf transmitting station enters service, providing television signals to the Cardigan Bay area.\n** 26 October – Television Wales and the West is awarded the ITV franchise for South Wales and the West of England.\n* 1957\n** The BBC launches a daily five minute news bulletin for Wales.\n* 1958\n** 14 January – At 4.45pm, TWW starts broadcasting.\n** The Llanddona transmitting station is switched on, bringing television to the isle of Anglesey and other parts of the north Wales coast.\n* 1959\n** No events.\n1960s\n*1960\n** No events.\n*1961\n** Following pressure from Welsh-speaking businessmen, the ITA offers and then awards a licence covering a new North and West Wales region, awarding the contract to Wales West and North Television.\n**BBC Wales launches a Welsh language news bulletin called Heddiw.\n*1962\n** 14 September – Wales (West and North) Television launches as Teledu Cymru.

The BBC begins broadcasting from that transmitter in 1965.\n** Delays in switching on the Arfon and Moel-y-Parc transmitters destroys the finances of WWN. Free programming from the ITV network, plus other support from its neighbours ABC, ATV and TWW just about kept the ship afloat, but Granada decided to dispense with its productions in the Welsh language, and the loss of this programming stream proved fatal to WWN.\n*1964\n** 26 January – Wales (West and North) Television stops broadcasting after going bankrupt. TWW offers a generous package to WWN's shareholders, in order to gain control of the territory, and kept the Teledu Cymru name on the air as a service separate from its existing service to South Wales and the West.\n** 9 February – Following the creation of separate regions for Wales and the west of England, BBC Cymru Wales is officially launched and output includes an extended news bulletin called  Wales Today – a 25-minute programme broadcast only to Wales. 1964 also sees the launch of current affairs series Week In Week Out.\n*1965\n** For the first time, TWW is able to provide separate programming for he whole of Wales and the West of England, due to the addition of a second VHF transmitter to the St Hilary mast to extend the Teledu Cymru network into South East Wales. Viewers in South Wales are able to receive both services.\n** 12 September – BBC Two Wales begins broadcasting.\n*1966\n** BBC Wales moves to new studios at Broadcasting House, Cardiff.\n* 1967\n** TWW loses its licence to the Harlech Consortium.

It improves reception for people living in Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot.\n* 1968\n** 4 March – TWW stops broadcasting five months before its contract was due to expire, selling the final months of airtime to Harlech.

However the new Conservative government decides against a Welsh fourth channel, and suggests that, except for an occasional opt-out, the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the UK. This leads to acts of civil disobedience, including refusals to pay the television licence fee and sit-ins in BBC and HTV studios and some attacks on TV transmitters in Welsh-speaking areas.\n** 10 August – The ten week ITV strike forces HTV off the air. The strike ends on 24 October.\n1980s\n* 1980\n** 17 September – The government reverses its position on a separate Welsh language service for Wales following opposition from the public and Welsh politicians, including a threat from the former president of Plaid Cymru, Gwynfor Evans, to go on hunger strike and the idea is given the green light.
