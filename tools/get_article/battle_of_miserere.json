The confrontation took place on 2 July 1807 in the current Miserere square, Balvanera neighborhood, Buenos Aires. The British troops prevailed, but General Gower discouraged further advances, and gave orders to Colonel Crauford to stop the pursuit of the defeated, allowing them to entrench themselves in the city.\nReferences"
