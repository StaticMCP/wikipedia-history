Founded in 1774, it remained active under a variety of names until 1935. The names included the  (Warsaw Independent Gazette; during the Warsaw Uprising (1794)) and , Warsaw Morning Gazette, after the merger with , (2 grosze) in 1925.\nInitially published by Stefan Łuskina, it remained his personal enterprise until 1793. Defunct after its founder's death, it was revived as a conservative newspaper the following year, this time as a private venture of the Lesznowski family. Among the notable editors of the newspaper were Józef Kenig (1859–1889), Maurycy Zamoyski (1906–1909) and Roman Dmowski (1910–1916). Disbanded in 1916, it was revived again in 1918, this time as an organ of the National Democrats. Drifting towards the far-right, it was officially banned by the Sanacja in 1935, after which it was continued until 1939 under the title Warszawski Dziennik Narodowy (Warsaw National Daily).\nThe Jewish war of 1859\nIn 1859, the  launched an infamous antisemitic campaign, known as the \"Jewish war of 1859\", against the Jewish bourgeoisie of Warsaw. Members of Polish Jewry sued  for defamation but lost in court. Historian Joachim Lelewel and other democrats supported them, however, the readership appeared to be on the side of the leaders of the campaign. Later in the 19th century, the leaders of the Endecja political tendency praised the  for being the first forum in favour of Polish Integral nationalism, and considered it to be a predecessor of their movement: \"[The ] was the leading national paper which advocated the preservation of Polish national culture, fought against Jewish influence, and warned against the German threat long before the birth of Roman Dmowski\".\nReferences"
