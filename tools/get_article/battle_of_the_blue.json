The first game was played between the two teams in 1895 and was played annually from 1964 to 1980, when Villanova dropped football. The rivalry resumed when Villanova restarted its football program in 1988. Beginning in 2007, the annual Delaware–Villanova game became known as Battle of the Blue. As part of this concept, the winning team gets to keep the Battle of the Blue Trophy at its institution for the year and is responsible for bringing the trophy to the following installment of the rivalry game. The trophy consists of a football with a Villanova logo and the Wildcat shade of blue on one side and the Blue Hen logo and the Delaware shade of blue on the other side. The ball sits in a wooden platform and the scores of each game are engraved on the base of the trophy. Villanova had possession of the trophy for the first four years, until Delaware won in 2011.\nThree times within the first four years of the rivalry's existence, one of the teams went on to reach the NCAA Division I Football Championship. In 2007, the Wildcats upset #9&nbsp;Delaware 19–14 to claim the first Battle of the Blue Trophy. Delaware would later reach the FCS National Championship game before falling to the Appalachian State Mountaineers 49–21. In 2009, Villanova would win their first-ever appearance in the national championship, defeating the Montana Grizzlies 23–21. The 2010 meeting marked the first time the game had gone into overtime, with the Wildcats securing another upset win over the #1-ranked Delaware team on a recovered fumble. Once again, however, Delaware would reach the national championship, but would lose to Eastern Washington, 20–19.\nIn 2011, the Battle of the Blue was the first American football game to be played at the venue now known as Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, in which Delaware beat Villanova to earn the trophy for the first time.\nOn November 27, 2023, it was announced that the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football program had accepted an invitation to move up to the FBS Subdivision and would join Conference USA prior to the 2025 football season. There are no future meetings scheduled.\nGame results\n| team2 = Villanova\n| team2style =\n| November 23, 1895 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 10 | Villanova | 6\n| October 3, 1896 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 14 | Delaware | 0\n| October 18, 1924 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 17 | Delaware | 3\n| October 20, 1962 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 22 | Delaware | 10\n| October 17, 1964 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 34 | Delaware | 0\n| October 16, 1965 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 24 | Villanova | 21\n| October 15, 1966 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 16 | Delaware | 14\n| September 30, 1967 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 21 | Delaware | 13\n| September 28, 1968 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 16 | Delaware | 0\n| September 27, 1969 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 36 | Delaware | 33\n| October 3, 1970 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 34 | Delaware | 31\n| October 2, 1971 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 23 | Villanova | 15\n| November 4, 1972 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 14 | Villanova | 7\n| November 3, 1973 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 24 | Delaware | 7\n| November 2, 1974 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 49 | Villanova | 7\n| November 1, 1975 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 14 | Villanova | 13\n| October 16, 1976 | Newark, DE | Tie | 24 | Tie | 24\n| October 15, 1977 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 33 | Delaware | 16\n| November 11, 1978 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 23 | Villanova | 22\n| October 13, 1979 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 21 | Villanova | 20\n| November 1, 1980 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 17 | Villanova | 7\n| October 15, 1988 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 10 | Villanova | 7\n| October 14, 1989 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 20 | Delaware | 11\n| October 13, 1990 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 19 | Villanova | 15\n| October 19, 1991 | Newark, DE| Delaware | 38 | Villanova | 28\n| October 17, 1992 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 21 | Villanova | 20\n| October 16, 1993 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 19 | Villanova | 7\n| September 17, 1994 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 38 | Villanova | 31\n| September 16, 1995 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | Villanova | 7\n| September 14, 1996 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 27 | Delaware | 0\n| September 13, 1997 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 35 | Delaware | 25\n| September 12, 1998 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 34 | Delaware | 31\n| November 20, 1999 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 51 | Delaware | 45 OT\n| November 18, 2000 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 59 | Villanova | 42\n| November 17, 2001 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 19 | Delaware | 14\n| November 23, 2002 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 38 | Delaware | 34\n| November 22, 2003 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 20 | Villanova | 17\n| November 20, 2004 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 41 | Villanova | 35\n| November 19, 2005 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 38 | Villanova | 13\n| November 18, 2006 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 28 | Delaware | 27\n| November 17, 2007 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 19 | Delaware | 14\n| November 22, 2008 | Newark, DE | Villanova| 21 | Delaware | 7\n| November 21, 2009 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 31 | Delaware | 12\n| November 20, 2010 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 28 | Delaware | 21OT\n| November 19, 2011 | Chester, PA | Delaware | 26 | Villanova | 16\n| November 17, 2012 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 41 | Delaware | 10\n| November 23, 2013 | Chester, PA | Villanova | 35 | Delaware | 34\n| November 22, 2014 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 35 | Delaware | 28\n| September 19, 2015 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 28 | Delaware | 21\n| November 19, 2016 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 41 | Delaware | 10\n| November 18, 2017 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 28 | Delaware | 7\n| November 17, 2018 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 42 | Delaware | 21\n| November 23, 2019 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 55 | Delaware | 33\n| April 17, 2021 | Villanova, PA | Delaware | 27 | Villanova | 20\n| November 20, 2021 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 21 | Delaware | 13\n| November 19, 2022 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 29 | Delaware | 26\n| November 18, 2023 | Newark, DE | Villanova | 35 | Delaware | 7\n| November 23, 2024 | Villanova, PA | Villanova | 38 | Delaware | 28\n}}\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\nReferences"
