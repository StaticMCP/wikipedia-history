It entered into force on 1 January 1995. The Treaty arranged accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the EU and amended earlier Treaties of the European Union. As such it is an integral part of the constitutional basis of the European Union. Norway failed to join the EU because its referendum did not pass.\nFull title\nThe full official name of the treaty is:\nReferendums\n*  Austrian referendum\n*  Finnish referendum\n**  Åland referendum\n*  Norwegian referendum\n*  Swedish referendum\nSee also\n*1995 enlargement of the European Union\n*Norway–European Union relations\nReferences"
