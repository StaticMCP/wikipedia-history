The area remained largely rural with agricultural land and small settlements.\nThe ward existed as an administrative division until 1953, when it was merged with **Much Woolton ward** to form the larger **Woolton ward** as part of boundary changes within Liverpool.\nGeography\nLittle Woolton ward was located in the southeastern part of Liverpool, bordering Woolton, Gateacre, and Halewood. It was known for its open spaces, farmland, and village-like atmosphere, in contrast to the more urbanized districts of Liverpool.\nLegacy\nAlthough Little Woolton ward was abolished in 1953, the name **Little Woolton** is still used informally to describe the area. It retains historical significance due to its past as an independent township before Liverpool's expansion.\nElections\n1914\nNo. 34 Allerton, Childwall and Little Woolton, 4 October 1916\nFollowing the resignation of Councillor Henry Glover (Conservative, Allerton, Childwall and Little Woolton, elected 1 November 1913) which was reported to the Council on 6 September 1916, Herbert Plant Harrison was appointed by the Council in his place on 4 October 1916.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Ward\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n!Resigning Councillor\n!Appointed Replacement\n!Term expires\n|-\n|No. 34 Allerton, Childwall and Little Woolton\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Conservative\n|Henry Glover\n|Herbert Plant Harrison\n|1917\n|-\n|}\n1916\nAllerton, Childwall and Little Woolton\n1918\nAllerton, Childwall and Little Woolton\n1919\nAllerton, Childwall & Little Woolton\n1922\n1925\n1928\n1931\n1934\n1937\n1945\n1947\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\nBoundaries were readjusted and Little Woolton was deleted in 1952.\nReferences"
