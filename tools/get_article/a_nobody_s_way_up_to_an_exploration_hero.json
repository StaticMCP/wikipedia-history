He remains happy on the first floor killing slimes and makes it up to 999 slimes. His 1,000th slime is a golden slime that drops a summoning card for a Valkyrie. He later finds and defeats a silver slime that rewards him a Demon.\n;\n:\n: A Valkyrie that is rewarded to Kaito after killing his 1,000th slime and earning him the title Slime Slayer. She is a short statured young woman that resembles an older child. She wears silver armor and she has blue hair with blue eyes. Her main skills are offensive lightning and a defensive barrier that she can create. She often shows jealousy to Luceria and is very sensitive and encouraging to Kaito. Kaito eventually gives her the nickname Syl.\n;\n:\n: A childhood friend and neighbor to Kaito. She often discourages Kaito from going to the local dungeon. Her father helped to inspire Kaito to go down to the dungeon and become an explorer.\n;\n:\n: A demon summon rewarded to Kaito after killing a silver slime. Unlike the more reserved and nurturing Syl, Luceria is blunt and at first bemoans being the summon of Kaito. Like other summons, she requires the crystals dropped by monsters, but she has a habit of always asking for more crystals despite her workload. Her character has dark hair and also resembles an older child. Kaito eventually gives her the nickname Luce. Her skills involve strong fire magic and disintegrating ability.\n;\n:\n: A female adventurer that Kaito meets in the dungeon along with her two female party members. She uses a naginata and has trained in her family dojo to use it as she dreams of becoming a hero. This dream is one she shares with Kaito. Eventually Kaito joins her party so they can clear more levels in the dungeon. She is a first year in college and attends the college that is the first choice for Katsuragi. She becomes infatuated with Kaito the more time she spends with him.\n;\n:\n:\n;\n:\n:\nMedia\nLight novel\nWritten by Kaitō, ''A Nobody's Way Up to an Exploration Hero'' began serialization on the user-generated novel publishing website Shōsetsuka ni Narō on April 9, 2019.
