The expedition lasted for nine months and traveled .\nThe expedition was one of several surveys approved in 1853-4, when funding was added to the War Department budget. This allowed Secretary of War Jefferson Davis to send out surveying expeditions to explore potential transcontinental railroad routes across the United States.\nReports from these expeditions were published between 1855 and 1861 by the federal government in a twelve-volume report titled \"Reports of explorations and surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean\". These reports were also known as the Pacific Railroad Surveys. Volumes III and IV contain the reports from Whipple's expedition.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [http://cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_RR_Surveys/  Pacific Railroad Survey Reports], Central Pacific Railroad Photographic Museum\n* [https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/reportsofexplora11855unit  Reports of explorations and surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, Volume I, 1855], Smithsonian Libraries\n* [https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/reportsofexplora31856unit  Reports of explorations and surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, Volume III, 1856], Smithsonian Libraries\n* [https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/reportsofexplora41856unit  Reports of explorations and surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, Volume IV, 1856], Smithsonian Libraries\nBibliography\n*"
