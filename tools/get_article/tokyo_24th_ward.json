The phone call is from their supposedly dead friend, Asumi, which presents them with a vision of the soon to be launched Kizuna Train full of passengers heading towards their friend Mari holding her puppy on the tracks, presenting them with the Trolley problem. The vision becomes true after Mari who chases her puppy Daisy onto the railway tracks and becomes caught as the train hurtles towards her.

In a series of flashbacks, the proposed demolition of the historic Takara Elementary school was strongly opposed by Asumi who encouraged her friends and the RGB to cover the buildings with murals and draw attention to its plight. However, while the issue was being discussed, the school caught on fire, which led to Asumi's death. Back in the present, Mari draws strength from Asumi's conviction for what she believed in, and decides to enter her okonomiyaki in the Gourmet Festival.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hajime Taki and his gang plan to sabotage the judging at the Gourmet Festival so that Yabusame's Mon Jungle food stall wins, but they are foiled by Kaba who exposes them and they are disqualified. Just then the RGB team receive another phone message from Asumi, with a vision showing a tornado threatening the lives of everyone at the festival. The boys are given a choice: get people run across the bridge to the mainland, but leaving the weak behind or guide the weak into a shipping containers for protection, but this will leave many others outside - either way, people will die. RGB immediately initiate a plan to clear the bridge of vehicles and begin evacuation, while Ran arranges for trucks carrying containers to head towards the island. However, due to a misunderstanding Shu causes a truck to block the bridge, so the boys arrange for everyone to shelter inside the containers on trucks jammed on the bridge. However, Kaba's daughter Kozue is still on the island looking for her father. Kabe tries to save her, and Shu goes to their aid, but is unable to save Kaba who is blown away. Later it is reported that 21 people died and 130 were seriously injured and the RGB decide that they must work together more effectively if another disaster occurs. Suddenly, TV transmission is interrupted with the image of and upside-down phoenix and a character appear on the screen calling himself Carneades and threatening to thrust choices upon the world in the future.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Three months after the tornado there has been no communication from Asumi or Carneades.

Shu consoles her, and she sees him as a hero even though he could not save her father. Suddenly the Carneades firebird symbol appears projected into the night sky and the symbol appears on TV screens warning the population to \"choose their future\". The RGB group then receive another call from Asumi sending a vision of a cruise ship of VIPs in Tokyo Harbor which has a remote controlled bomb on board planted by a terrorist.

Ran visits Kunai's home where he discovers that Kunnai's invention of Di-VA, a music application which uses the owner's biorhythms to create soothing music, had been sold to Hajime Taki of the Kaburaya Corporation to aid his ailing mother. Kaburaya Corporation then modified the app to create addictive sounds which could destroy the user's reasoning, a drug without a physical existence. This led to the increased the crime rate, playing into Howard Win's plan to demolish shantytown and redevelop it. Devastated by the misuse of his creation, Kunai built a bomb in a hard drive which he gave to Taki stating it was an enhanced software version, knowing that Taki would take it to Howard aboard the ship.

He claims that it was modified and distributed by Howard in his attempt to acquire Shantytown which is why Kunai targeted Howard's ship. Kunai's action causes a rift between Ran and Ko which Shu appears unable to mend. Ko's father, Mayor Gori, shows Ko the futuristic accumulation radio tower, Cornucopia, which is nearing completion and will be the center of the Hazard Cast system monitored by Sakiko Tsuzuragawa. The supercomputer has been named the KANAE System after Ko's mother whose ideas on protecting society inspired it. Days later, Mayor Gori announces the trial of the new system prior to a referendum on its implementation. Because it uses personal data from the participant's cPhone, there is a mixed reaction by the citizens about the trade-off between loss of privacy for enhanced security. While explaining the system to Ko, Gori reveals to his son's surprise that the heart of the system is Asumi's brain, still encased in her damaged body which was retrieved and kept in stasis after her death.\n}}\n｜Orijinaru Terebi Animēshon \"Tōkyō Nijūyon-ku\" Kōshiki Saito|language=ja|script-title=ja:TVアニメ「東京24区」7話放送延期のお知らせ - NEWS ｜オリジナルTVアニメーション「東京24区」公式サイト|trans-title=TV Anime \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" Notice of Postponement of Episode 7 Broadcast - News ｜Original TV Animation \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" Official Website|website=tokyo24project.com|access-date=February 15, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220215093810/https://tokyo24project.com/news/?article_id=59972|archive-date=February 15, 2022|url-status=live}}}}\n| ShortSummary        = Two months after the introduction of the KANAE System, the integration between 24th Ward and Tokyo approaches and SARG's apprehension rates have increased.

If they are waned beforehand, they could survive, but the cranes will fall. 0th explains to Ran that he started the so-called graffiti war to stir people's anger against the KANAE system which he sees as a threat to humanity because it purports to control human behavior through its predictive AI is based on cypher and he asks Ran to hack into the KANAE system. As a storm approaches and the lightning alarm is sounded. Ran hacks into the Cornucopia surveillance system which shows Carneades at the top, but when Shu calls the rooftop phone, Carneades does not pick it up. Shu climbs to the top to find Carneades repairing the broken cable but is struck by lightning. Shu discovers that Carneades is actually really Tsuzuragawa.

As the years passed, Sakiko graduated and carried on Kanae's research. One day, during a Takara Food Bank day, Kanae was stabbed to death by a crazed man demanding money, and with her dying breath she asked Sakiko to watch over Ko and Asumi. Years later when Kuchikiri realized that Gori was building Cornucopia he fiercely objected saying that the KANAE system had a flaw. As Cornucopia and the KANAE system neared completion Gori and Sakiko still did not have the biological brain to run the system, so when Asumi was fatally wounded at the historic Takara Elementary school, he decided to use his own daughter to complete the KANAE system and keep both his wife and daughter's memory alive.

In an attempt to catch Ran, SARG leaks word that Kinako is a member of DoRed, but when she is attacked by vigilantes, Shu saves her. Hajime Taki brings Ran into his office and reveals he is profiting from the DoRed graffiti war and convinces Ran to hack into the KANAE polling system to help sway the people using cPhones to vote against the Hazard Cast system. Meanwhile, Gori decides on forced eviction of the Pylon Apartment building which stirs up anti SARG feelings and the residents begin to gather under the DoRed banner.

Tsuzuragawa confesses that she created Carneades to buy time to investigate and asks Shu to save Asumi.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Tsuzuragawa presents Shuta with the dilemma of either eradicating Asumi from the KANAE system or sending her into permanent sleep. Chikushi arrests Shuta after he is identified by the Hazard Cast system as a terrorist, but many others are also identified, indicating a fault with the system and that Asumi is not coping with the data load.

Rather than make a choice, RGB decide to visit Asumi together and discuss it with her, although she does not want to see them or be forced to determine the future. Asumi does everything she can to stop them, including declaring them as terrorists, but with Tsuzuragawa's help they find a way into Cornucopia. They reach the core and see Asumi and establish contact with her conscience while their conversation is transmitted across the 24th Ward. RGB offer to share her burden of having to make important decisions and as Asumi accepts their offer, Shuta declares his love for her and she reciprocates. Then, across the island, everyone declares their love for Asumi and the sacrifices she made, but then she asks Shuta, Ko and Ran if she can leave, and she fades from existence along with the KANAE system. Later, the 24th Ward is incorporated into Tokyo and renamed the \"Nijimi Ward\" with everyone's futures now resting on their own shoulders, although with the benefit of Shuta, Ko and Ran's help.\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://tokyo24project.com/ Official website]\n*[https://tokyo24thward-anime.com/ Official website]\n*"
