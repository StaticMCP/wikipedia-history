The award is presented for outstanding research in any aspect of inorganic chemistry. The winner receives a monetary prize of £2000, in addition to a medal and a certificate, and completes a UK lecture tour. The winner is chosen by the Dalton Division Awards Committee.\nIn 2020 the Ludwig Mond Award was merged with the Nyholm Prize for Inorganic Chemistry to form the Mond-Nyholm Prize for Inorganic Chemistry.\nAward History\nThe award was established in 1981 to commemorate the life and work of the chemist Dr Ludwig Mond and followed an endowment from ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries). Mond was born in Kassel, Germany in 1839, and became a noted chemist and industrialist who eventually took British nationality.\nRecipients\nSource:\n*  |event=Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson}}\n*  |event=F.
