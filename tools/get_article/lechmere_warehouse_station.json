It served the Lowell Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail system. The station, located in northwestern Woburn away from the residential areas, primarily served reverse commuters working at the adjacent warehouse of the Lechmere department store. It was a flag stop, with certain northbound stops during the morning rush and southbound trains during the evening rush stopping on request.\nHistory\nThe station opened in 1979 and consisted of two low platforms about  long serving the line's two tracks. The station was never heavily used; in 1983, it had just 17 daily riders. The stop was discontinued circa 1997, when the Lechmere stores closed as parent company Montgomery Ward underwent bankruptcy. The platforms are still extant.\nReferences\nExternal links"
