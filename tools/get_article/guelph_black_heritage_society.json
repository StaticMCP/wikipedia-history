It is incorporated through the Ontario Historical Society.\nThe impetus for the founding of the Society was when the historic Guelph BME (British Methodist Episcopal) Church was listed for sale in November, 2011. Part of the Society's mission is to restore and maintain the Church.\nIn 2017, the Society launched the Viola Desmond BIPOC Business Directory, to highlight and support BIPOC-owned businesses in Wellington County and the Waterloo Region.\nReferences"
