The barren hill is believed to have been covered with dense jungle in the days of Maruthupandiar's rule from late 17th century to 1801. It was part of a large jungle that extended from the Eastern Ghats to the Palk Straits. This is a vast hill temple reached by a flight of steps in the Pandya Kingdom.  The Marudu brothers of Sivagangai associated with Kalayar Kovil have made several contributions to this temple. The hilly village includes five areas (Piranmalai Main, Mathagupatti, Pudupatti, Pappapatti, Adiyarkulam).\nMythology\nPiranmalai is said to have been ruled by Paari Vallal. Piraanmalai is said to be a block of Mount Meru, which got blown off during a fierce tussle between the serpent king Aadiseshan and the wind God Vaayu(as in Tiruchengode). Since this hill is in the form of a Sivalingam, it is also called Prachandragiri and Katoragiri. Bhrama, Saraswati, Subramanya and Nandi are believed to have worshipped Shiva here. Shiva is believed to have revealed a vision of his marriage with Parvati to Agasthya Muni here. Lord Shiva in this hill temple is known as Mangaibaagar(also called MangaiNayagar) and Goddess Parvati is known as Thenammal. In this hill, there is a natural stone carving that depicts the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati .
