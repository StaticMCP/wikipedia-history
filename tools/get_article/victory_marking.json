The use of victory markings originated during World War I, burgeoned during World War II and frequently took the form of the roundel or national flag of the nationality of the military target defeated. Sometimes damaged targets also included, but the mark will be slightly different to distinguish them from those targets that are destroyed. These enemy targets can be planes, helicopters, trains, ships and sea mines in World War II, which later also include cruise missiles and drones in subsequent conflicts. The manner of destruction that qualify for a victory mark also varies, from bombs and cannons by planes, deck guns by ships to torpedoes by submarines.\nIn 2012, a German Eurofighter was spotted with a kill mark denoting a simulated victory over a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor, achieved in a dogfight during a training exercise.\nIn the United States Air Force, as of 2010, victory markings are applied in the form of six inch green stars set within a black border with the type of aircraft defeated stencilled inside the star in white lettering.\nIn the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukrainian anti-air defenses such as Flakpanzer Gepards and Patriot Missile systems are decorated with victory markings for successfully shooting down Russian aerial targets, missiles and Iranian Shahed drones.\nMission symbol\nVictory marks have been applied to aircraft for reasons other than aerial victories.  During the period of its use for astronaut recovery, the U.S. Navy's Helicopter 66 bore victory marks showing a space capsule silhouette, with one mark added for each recovery in which it participated.\nGallery\nFile:MemphisBelle crew USAF.jpg|Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress Memphis Belle with victory markings signifying 25 bombing missions and 8 fighter kills.\nFile:Martin B-26B 'Flak-Bait' fuselage at NASM (NASM2014-02561).jpg|Nose section of Martin B-26 Marauder Flak-Bait (serial no. 41-31773), showing the large number of victory marks from its 207 missions over Europe during World War II.\nFile:84606 General Dynamics F-16BM 11(MR) 39W Pakistan Air Force Konya AFB 30.6.22 (52232199842).jpg|An F-16BM (serial no. 84606) from the No. 11 Squadron 'Arrows' of the Pakistan Air Force with an Indian flag on its nose as a kill mark signifying its shoot down of an Indian Air Force MiG-21 during Operation Swift Retort in 2019.\nFile:IAF-F-15C-Baz--Independence-Day-2017-Tel-Nof-IZE-086-kill-marks.jpg|McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle of the Israeli Air Force showing 4 kill marks for aerial victories over Syrian pilots in the 1982 Lebanon War.\nFile:F-16-Netz-107-fighter-and-killmarks-01.jpg|F-16A Netz 107 of the Israeli Air Force.
