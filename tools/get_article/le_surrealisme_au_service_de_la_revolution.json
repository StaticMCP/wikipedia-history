It was the successor of La Révolution surréaliste (published 1924–29) and preceded the primarily surrealist publication Minotaure (1933 to 1939).\nAfter the writing of his Second Manifesto of Surrealism (1929), which announced the expulsions of several prior surrealists due to theoretical differences, André Breton and his supporters developed a new, more politically charged publication.  The first issue of Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution was published in June 1930, and was followed by five more issues through 1933.  Contributors included André Breton, Paul Éluard, René Crevel, Tristan Tzara, Salvador Dalí, René Char, Benjamin Péret, Louis Aragon, and Luis Buñuel, among others.\nSelected issues\nIssue 1 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Crevel, Tzara, Dalí, Char, Péret, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include stills from Buñuel's film ''L'Âge d'or'', paintings by Dalí, and a drawing of the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky with a skeleton. It was originally published in June 1930.\nIssue 2 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Crevel, Char, Péret, Marcel Duchamp, Aragon, and Georges Sadoul, and others.

It was originally published in October 1930.\nIssue 3 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Char, Tanguy, Max Ernst, Pierre Unik, Crevel, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include photographs of surrealist objects by Breton, Gala Éluard, Valentine Hugo, Joan Miró, Alberto Giacometti, and Dalí. The issue opens with an ad for the books ''L'Immaculee conception by Breton & Eluard, La Peinture au defi by Aragon, and La Femme Visible'' by Dalí. It was originally published in December 1931.\nIssue 4 features writings by Breton, Éluard, Char, Tzara, Dalí, Pierre Unik, Crevel, and Aragon, and others.
