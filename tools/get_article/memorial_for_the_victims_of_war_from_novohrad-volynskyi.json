The monument was created by the artist Josef Tabachnyk who makes monuments and sculptures.\nIt lies near the House of the Officers in Novohrad-Volynskyi, where women and children were murdered in the Second World War. In pink granite, a mother is depicted carrying her tortured children in her arms. Two stone pyramids connected to one another form a Star of David, on which the inscription \"We remember\" is written in Hebrew. The black pyramid symbolises a body, which is aiming for the ground. The pink pyramid symbolises a soul, which is ready to rise up to heaven.\nThe sculpture was opened in 1995. The sculpture's measurements are 200 x 200 x 200 cm.\nReferences"
