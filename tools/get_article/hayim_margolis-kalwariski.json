She notes that Margolis-Kalwariski became involved in Arab politics centered in Damascus as early as 1913 and that he was in contact with King Faysal.\nCareer\nDuring the Mandate period in Palestine, Margolis-Kalwariski served on the Arab-Jewish Advisory Council set up by Herbert Samuel and on the executive of the Va'ed Le'umi, the National Council of the Palestinian Jewish community. He also directed the Office of Arab Affairs of the Zionist Executive from 1923 to 1927 and was called upon for mediation efforts after the 1929 uprising.\nHe was a member of Brit Shalom, a small political group that called for a binational state in Palestine, as well as several organizations which succeeded it, including Kedma Mizraha (Forward to the East), the League of Arab-Jewish Rapprochement, and Ihud.\nReferences"
