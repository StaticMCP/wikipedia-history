He held office under Sir Robert Peel as Paymaster of the Forces between 1834 and 1835 and as Paymaster General between 1841 and 1845.\nBackground and education\nKnatchbull was the son of Sir Edward Knatchbull, 8th Baronet, and Mary, daughter and heiress of William Western Hugessen, of Provender House in Norton, Kent, and was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and matriculated in 1800.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1802 and was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1803. In 1819 he succeeded in the baronetcy on the death of his father.\nPolitical career\nKnatchbull was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Kent at a by-election in November 1819, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father. He held the seat until the 1831 general election, which he did not contest.  The Reform Act 1832 split the Kent county constituency into Eastern and Western divisions, and at the 1832 general election Knatchbull and John Pemberton Plumptre were elected as Members for the new Eastern division of Kent. Knatchbull held that seat until his resignation in early 1845 by taking the Chiltern Hundreds.\nIn 1829 he became one of the leaders of the \"Ultra-Tories\" who were opposed to Catholic emancipation in Ireland. Sworn of the Privy Council in 1834, he served under Sir Robert Peel as Paymaster of the Forces between 1834 and 1835 and as Paymaster General between 1841 and 1845.\nFamily\nKnatchbull married twice.

They had nine children, including:\n*Edward Hugessen Knatchbull-Hugessen, 1st Baron Brabourne (1829–1893)\n*Reverend Reginald Bridges Knatchbull-Hugessen (1831–1911), who married firstly in 1866 Mary Brockman and secondly in 1885 Hon.
