In the , Happy Valley had a population of 733 people.\nGeography\nThe Leichhardt River flows north–south through the town of Mount Isa, dividing the suburbs of the town into \"mineside\" (west of the Leichhardt River) and \"townside\" (east of the Leichhardt River). Happy Valley is a \"mineside\" suburb.\nHappy Valley is bounded to the west by the Great Northern railway, to the north by Twenty-third Avenue, and to the east roughly by the Leichhardt River.\nHistory\nThe suburb was named in September 1973 and is the ironic name given to the area by the population during the Great Depression, when a shanty town existed in the area.\nIsa Mines State School opened on 3 May 1932 with 79 students and head-teacher Mr Phail and assistant teacher Miss Bennett. The original school building had 2 rooms with verandahs on the front and one side. By the end of the first month there were 99 students. Rising student numbers necessitated the user of the verandahs as classrooms resulting in the addition of two more schoolrooms and an office in 1933. In 1938 a fifth classroom was added for the primary school with another room for secondary students who were taught by high school teacher Les Jacobs. In 1971 new facilities were built at a new location and the school was renamed Happy Valley State School.\nDemographics\nIn the , Happy Valley had a population of 767 people.\nIn the , Happy Valley had a population of 733 people.\nEducation\nHappy Valley State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Brilliant Street ().
