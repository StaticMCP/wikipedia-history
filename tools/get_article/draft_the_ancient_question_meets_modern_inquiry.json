Central to this discussion is the question of how ancient cosmological views—particularly the idea of a flat earth under a firmament—intersect with modern scientific understanding of the Earth as an oblate spheroid with varied surface topography. This article examines the biblical narrative, ancient Near Eastern cosmology, scientific evidence for Earth’s shape, and a theological interpretation suggesting post-Flood divine restructuring of Earth’s terrain.\n1. Ancient Cosmology and the Flood Narrative\n1.1 The Genesis Account\nGenesis 7:19–20 reports that \"waters prevailed … above the highest mountains under the entire heavens\" (ESV), while Genesis 9:11–15 emphasizes the promise that such a flood will not recur. Although the description asserts total inundation, it does not specify the Earth's shape or topographic features\n[https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&context=jats&utm digitalcommons.andrews.edu]\n[http://biologos.org biologos.org]\n.\n1.2 Flat-Earth Cosmology and the Firmament\nAncient Near Eastern and early Hebrew cosmology frequently depicted the Earth as a flat disc beneath a solid firmament—the raqīaʿ—which separated celestial waters from terrestrial seas\nen.wikipedia.org\n. Biblical scholars note that this model aligns with ancient cultural and sensory perceptions, where the sky appeared as a dome\nen.wikipedia.org\nbiologos.org\nreddit.com\n.\n1.3 Theological Purpose of the Flood Narrative\nScholars agree that Genesis 6–9 presents a narrative focused on divine judgment, covenant, and moral instruction rather than scientific or geological detail .\n2. Modern Scientific Consensus\n2.1 Earth's Shape: Oblate Spheroid\nSubstantial evidence—from satellite imagery, lunar eclipses, maritime and aerospace observations, GPS technology, and gravitational theory—supports the understanding of Earth as an oblate spheroid .\n2.2 Topographical Complexity\nEarth’s varied surface—mountains, ocean trenches, plains, and valleys—results from geological processes such as plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism .\n3. Theological Reconciliation: Divine Restructuring Post-Flood\n3.1 Contextual Ancient Accuracy\nThis theological perspective holds that the ancient flat-Earth model reflected legitimate cultural and experiential understanding at the time, rather than a mistaken belief .\n3.2 Literal Interpretation of Flood Coverage\nWithin a flat-Earth framework, the universal flood would indeed have submerged “all the high mountains,” supporting the textual claim\n[http://biblearchaeology.org biblearchaeology.org]\n.\n3.3 Post-Flood Topographical Transformation\nThe hypothesis proposes that God's covenant with Noah (Genesis 9:11–15) was actualized through divine intervention: reshaping the Earth’s surface so that future floods could not again engulf the entire planet. Psalm 104:6–8, which refers to mountains rising and valleys sinking, may symbolize this transformative act\n[http://biblearchaeology.org biblearchaeology.org]\n[http://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu digitalcommons.cedarville.edu]\n[http://digitalcommons.andrews.edu digitalcommons.andrews.edu]\n4. Alternate Exegetical Perspectives\n4.1 Creation-Centric Interpretation of Psalm 104\nExegetes note that the imagery in Psalm 104:5–9 parallels the Creation narrative (Genesis 1) and may not reference the Flood at all. Instead, the “mountains rose” verse emphasizes the establishment of order during Creation\n[http://biblearchaeology.org biblearchaeology.org]\n4.2 Early Geological Boundaries\nTexts such as Job 38:10, Proverbs 8:29, and Jeremiah 5:22 are often interpreted as describing the original land-sea boundaries set at Creation, not post-Flood events\nbiblearchaeology.org\n.\n5. Knowledge as Cyclical (“Nothing New Under the Sun”)\nDrawing from Ecclesiastes 1:9, some theologians propose that ancient wisdom and modern discoveries reflect deeper continuities, suggesting that early cultures possessed insights temporarily obscured and later rediscovered by science .\nConclusion\nThe flood narrative in Genesis was contextualized within a flat-Earth cosmology and served primarily theological aims. Contemporary science confirms that Earth is spherical and features complex topography shaped through natural processes. Some theological frameworks attempt a synthesis by suggesting divine reconfiguration of Earth post-Flood. While these ideas hold significance for theological reflection, they remain outside the scientific paradigm. Nonetheless, ongoing dialogue among historians, scientists, and theologians enriches our understanding of how ancient narratives intersect with modern knowledge.\nOokoTonny (talk) 10:06, 8 June 2025 (UTC)\nReferences\nOokoTonny (talk) 12:05, 8 June 2025 (UTC)"
