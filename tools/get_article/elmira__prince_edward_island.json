It was completed on January 22, 2007, and it is owned and operated by PEI Energy Corporation.\nThe wind farm consists of ten Vestas V90 wind turbines 3 MW. Annual production will be 90-95 million kilowatt hours. The average house uses about 8,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually so the wind farm will produce enough electricity to power about 12,000 homes.\nThe Eastern Kings Wind Farm was projected to supply about 7.5% of PEI's electricity and displace 75,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year. The project capital cost was approximately $47 million.\nReferences\n}}"
