It permits the president to divide, consolidate, abolish, or create agencies of the U.S. federal government by presidential directive, subject to limited legislative oversight. First granted in 1932, presidential reorganization authority has been extended to nine presidents on 16 separate occasions. As of 2024, it was most recently granted to Ronald Reagan.\nPresidential reorganization authority is designed to allow periodic refinement of the organizational efficiency of the government through significant and sweeping modifications to its architecture that might otherwise be too substantial to realistically implement through a parliamentary process.\nOverview\nThe customary method by which agencies of the United States government are created, abolished, consolidated, or divided is through an act of Congress. The presidential reorganization authority essentially delegates these powers to the president for a defined period of time, permitting the President to take those actions by decree. A method of limited oversight has generally been included in past cases of presidential reorganization authority; usually, reorganization plans issued pursuant to the authority can be nullified by an act of Congress during a fixed window of time following promulgation of the orders. In other words, should Congress take no action in response to an reorganization plan issued under the authority, then the plan becomes law. This is different from the normal process of lawmaking, in which laws take effect with congressional action, not in the absence of action, and has been colloquially called the \"legislative veto\".\nPresidential reorganization authority is designed to allow periodic refinement of the organizational efficiency of the government through significant and sweeping modifications to its architecture that might otherwise be too substantial to realistically implement through a parliamentary process.\nFirst fully extended in 1932, presidential reorganization authority has been authorized on 16 occasions. The Reorganization Act of 1949 was the last full statute enacted from scratch until the Reorganization Act of 1977; reorganizations occurring between the 1949 and 1977 statutes took the form of amendment and extension of the 1949 law.\nAs of 2017, the last major reorganization of the government using presidential reorganization authority was during the administration of Dwight Eisenhower. All subsequent cases of the invocation of presidential reorganization authority has been to make more minor, corrective adjustments.\n) reserves some authority over the design and organization of the executive branch.]]\nLegal basis\nThe U.S. Constitution establishes an Executive Branch of government. It is, therefore, left to normal statute law to establish inferior offices and agencies, under the President, by which the government can operate.\nDespite the broad authority granted by the United States Constitution to the president, they do not have \"unilateral and unrestrained authority over the Executive Branch\" and \"congressional action is required to create Executive Branch departments, to fund them, to determine the nature and scope of their duties and to confirm the appointment of their top leaders\". While the president manages the conduct of executive branch offices, \"it is Congress, not the President, that establishes departments and agencies, and to whatever degree it chooses, the internal organization of agencies\".\nDelegation of legislative authority\nThe nondelegation doctrine is a principle that the Congress, being vested with \"all legislative powers\" by Article One, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, cannot delegate that power to anyone else.  However, the Supreme Court ruled in J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States'' (1928) that congressional delegation of legislative authority is an implied power of Congress that is constitutional so long as Congress provides an \"intelligible principle\" to guide the executive branch: \"'In determining what Congress may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the government co-ordination.' So long as Congress 'shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.'\"\nUnicameral legislative veto\nA unicameral legislative veto has been a feature of the oversight authority built into several instances of presidential reorganization authority. United States Attorney-General William D. Mitchell early expressed concern that the Economy Act of 1932, the first instance of presidential reorganization authority, was unconstitutional on the basis of it allowing the exercise of the so-called \"legislative veto\" by only one chamber of Congress. The act provided that either the Senate or the House of Representatives could annul an executive order issued by the president under the reorganization authority. In Mitchell's view, a single chamber of Congress was constitutionally incompetent to act by itself; the legislative power could only be exercised by the two chambers jointly, he argued. The question was not immediately tested in court. However, in the 1983 case of Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, the U.S. Supreme Court essentially affirmed Mitchell's earlier opinion that a one-house legislative veto was unconstitutional. The decision in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha created the possibility that every previous reorganization was effectively null and void; to avoid the potential administrative chaos that might have ensued, Congress enacted legislation retroactively approving all previous reorganizations.\nHistory\nBackground\nThe creation of presidential reorganization authority was foreshadowed with the passage of the Overman Act in 1918, which allowed the president to consolidate government agencies, though abolishing any specific department was prohibited.\nEconomy Act of 1932\nThe Economy Act of 1932 (47 Stat. 413) was passed in response to Hoover's frustration at the lack of cooperation from Congress in refining aspects of the administrative structure of the government and his concern that any proposal he advanced would be \"amended beyond recognition\". Hoover issued 11 executive orders under the Economy Act of 1932 on December 9, 1932. All were nullified by resolutions of disapproval on January 19, 1933.\nThe Amendments of 1933 (47 Stat. 1517; 48 Stat. 8) to the Economy Act granting presidential reorganization authority to Franklin D. Roosevelt were made at the urging of Herbert Hoover before he left office. In contrast to the original legislation, however, the reorganization authority granted by the 73rd Congress \"all but eliminated the ability of Congress to prevent such orders from taking effect\" short of enacting a new law. Roosevelt used the authority to create the Office of National Parks, Buildings, and Reservations in the United States Department of the Interior; abolish the United States Shipping Board; merge the Bureau of Immigration and Bureau of Naturalization into the Immigration and Naturalization Service; abolish the Board of Indian Commissioners, transferring its authority to the U.S. Department of the Interior; and consolidate several disparate government farm credit agencies into the Farm Credit Administration.\nReorganization Act of 1939\nThe Reorganization Act of 1939 (53 Stat. 561) defined the reorganization plan as its own kind of presidential directive. Previously, the delegated authority had been exercised using executive orders.\nRoosevelt's Reorganization Plan No. 1 and Reorganization Plan No. 2 substantially reorganized a number of federal agencies. It created several agencies:\n* The Federal Security Agency, bringing together the Social Security Board, U.S. Employment Service, Office of Education, Public Health Service, National Youth Administration, and Civilian Conservation Corps\n* The Federal Works Agency, bringing together the Bureau of Public Roads, Public Buildings Branch of the Procurement Division, Branch of Buildings Management of the National Park Service, United States Housing Authority, Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, and Works Progress Administration\n* The Federal Loan Agency, bringing together the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Electric Home and Farm Authority, Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Federal Housing Administration, and Export-Import Bank of the United States.\nThe plan also transferred the Farm Credit Administration, Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, and Commodity Credit Corporation to the United States Department of Agriculture. One later criticism of Roosevelt's actions is that they further reduced the influence and capacity of the Cabinet.\nDuring World War II, special reorganization authority was granted to Franklin Roosevelt. However, these powers differed from what is generally considered to be presidential reorganization authority as all structural changes undertaken were to revert following the conclusion of the war.\nReorganization Act of 1945\nHarry Truman used his power under the Reorganization Act of 1945 (59 Stat. 613) to restructure some federal housing agencies. Proposals to restructure the U.S. Department of Labor were nullified by Congress.\nReorganization Act of 1949\nTruman used the Reorganization Act of 1949 to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, which was chaired by former president Herbert Hoover. While most of the commission's program was ultimately implemented, eleven of the 41 reorganization plans issued by Truman to carry out the reorganization were nullified by Congress.\nUnder the Amendments of 1953, Eisenhower that year created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare under the orders of his Reorganization Plan No. 1.\nUnder the Amendments of 1955, Congress disapproved Eisenhower's plans to reorganize the research and development programs of the Department of Defense and to make the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation independent of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.\nThere was another period under the Amendments of 1957.\nUnder the Amendments of 1961, John F. Kennedy's Reorganization Plans No. 1 and No. 2 of 1961, effecting the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Communications Commission, were disapproved by Congress.  However, Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1962 created the Office of Science and Technology in the Executive Office of the President.\nThere were two more additional periods under the Amendments of 1963 and 1965.\nNixon used his reorganization authority under the Amendments of 1969 to establish the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency under his Reorganization Plan No. 3.\nThere was another period under the Amendments of 1971.\nReorganization Act of 1977\nThe Reorganization Act of 1977, originally intended to be a further series of amendments to extend the Act of 1949, ultimately materialized as its own statute. Carter used his authority under the act to create the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority. A plan to create a Department of Natural Resources, by renaming the Department of the Interior and transferring into it the U.S. Forest Service from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was ultimately never enacted after it became clear the proposal was likely to be disapproved by Congress.\nThere was another period under the Amendments of 1980.\nIn 1983 in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the one-house legislative veto was unconstitutional, causing Congress the following year to enact legislation (), retroactively approving all previous reorganizations.\nAfter passing the Amendments of 1984, the Senate immediately adjourned sine die and did not reconvene until the two-month time-limit had almost passed. Because of the requirement that reorganization plans had to be forwarded to the Congress while it was in session, Reagan was unable to conduct any reorganization.\nLater history\nThe last reorganization authority was passed by Congress in 1984, although there have been proposals to reinstate it since then.\nIn 2002 George W. Bush requested the president be granted permanent reorganization authority. No such authorization was extended. Also in 2002, the National Commission on the Public Service proposed extending presidential reorganization authority to substantially restructure the executive branch which, it contended, had become incoherent in the level of overlapping jurisdiction and different management structures.\nDuring the presidency of Barack Obama, Obama requested reorganization authority from Congress which he said he would use to restructure the Department of Commerce, followed by less specific modifications to other agencies. Under Obama's plan, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would have been transferred to the Department of the Interior while the rest of the Department of Commerce would be merged with the Small Business Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and renamed. The authorization was not granted.\nList of reorganization acts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! President !! Congress !! Authorizing legislation !! Time limit !! Oversight procedure !!
