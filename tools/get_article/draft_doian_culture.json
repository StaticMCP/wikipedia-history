The culture is best documented at archeological site of  Buur Heybe, particular Gogoshiis Qabe rock shelter, where excavations have revealed a stratified sequence ranging from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) to the Later Stone Age (LSA). The Eibian/Doian toolkit—first identified by Paolo Graziosi in 1935 was found in distinctive gravel layers and includes microlithic tools such as small points, scrapers, trihedral rods, and pressure-flaked implements made of exotic cherts and local quartz. While early scholars dated the Eibian to the mid-Holocene due to superficial associations with pottery, recent excavations and radiocarbon dates from Gogoshiis Qabe and nearby sites (e.g., a 12,910 ± 180 BP ostrich eggshell date from Mirsaale) indicate a terminal Pleistocene age, firmly placing the Doian culture in a pre-ceramic Later Stone Age context. These findings make the Doian one of the earliest known microlithic industries in the Horn of Africa and a critical component in understanding the region's prehistoric humans.\nReferences"
