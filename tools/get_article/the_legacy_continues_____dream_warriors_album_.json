(Dream Warriors album)\n\n}}\n}}\nThe Legacy Continues... is the fourth and final studio album by Canadian hip hop duo Dream Warriors, released July 9, 2002 on ISBA/BMG Music, exclusively in Canada. It spawned the singles \"Road of Many Signs\", \"Breathe or Die\", and \"Unstoppable\". NOW magazine gave the album a 3 out of 5 rating, calling it \"another set of jazzy, loose-limbed hiphop that skips from beats and rhymes to UK garage, Swizz Beatz-style bumps and dancehall.\" The album also included a remix of the group's best-known single from 1991, \"My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style\".\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!
