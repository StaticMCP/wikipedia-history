Established by brothers Tamás “Tomi” Kiss and Gergely “Geri” Kiss, the kennel has expanded from its rural origins to an international presence, particularly in the United States. Their branding focuses on puppies with lifetime genetic health guarantees and ongoing owner support, and has a U.S.-based breeder network since 2024, as part of the “TomKings Breeder Family” U.S. affiliate program to comply with travel regulations and offer younger puppies domestically.\nHistory\nThe kennel was founded by the Kiss brothers in southern Hungary. Gergely Kiss was previously known for being a professional freestyle wrestling athlete, and participated the 2008 Summer Olympics representing Hungary, but has retired since. Tamás Kiss states that he has worked with dogs since childhood and holds a university degree in animal breeding. These claims about Tamás are based on internal interviews and blog posts published by the company.  They began raising french bulldogs during the early 2010s, however the exact date is undisclosed on their website. By 2025, TomKings stated that they had placed puppies in all 50 U.S. states and in nearly 45 countries worldwide.\nBusiness practices\nTomKings emphasizes health screenings, including genetic testing, and offers lifetime guarantees on genetic conditions. They state that puppies are not rehomed before eight weeks, and undergo vet checks, microchipping, and documentation before delivery. In 2024, TomKings introduced the “TomKings Breeder Family” U.S. affiliate program to comply with travel regulations and offer younger puppies domestically.\nImport regulations and operational changes\nAll puppies were originally transported internationally via trained couriers. In August 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented new dog importation rules requiring that all dogs entering the United States be at least six months old, microchipped, appear healthy, and be accompanied by a valid CDC Dog Import Form. In response, TomKings began offering older “Junior Frenchies” and expanded its U.S. breeder network to continue offering younger pups locally.\nControversy\nIn 2023, actor Neil Patrick Harris adopted a French Bulldog (“Chunk”) from TomKings and shared about it on Instagram. PETA criticized the adoption, citing concerns about imported dogs and brachycephalic health issues. TomKings reiterated its commitment to ethical breeding and responsible health standards, though made no direct public statement."
