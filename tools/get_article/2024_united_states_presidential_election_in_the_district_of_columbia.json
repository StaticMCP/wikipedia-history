District of Columbia voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The District of Columbia has 3 electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the district neither gained nor lost a seat. Per the Constitution, the District of Columbia can not be apportioned more members of the Electoral College than the number apportioned to the state with the fewest.\nAs an extremely blue urban district with an African American plurality, Democrats have faced no challenge to earning the District of Columbia's electoral votes in presidential elections since it was first granted its electoral college representation. Starting with Lyndon B. Johnson's victory in 1964, every Democratic nominee for president has won the District by massive margins, including the 49-state landslide defeats of George McGovern and Walter Mondale in 1972 and 1984. Thus, the district was expected to be a certain lock for Kamala Harris in 2024.\nHarris won the district overwhelmingly with 90.28% of the vote. The district was both Harris' strongest electoral jurisdiction and county-equivalent jurisdiction, voting more Democratic than all state counties in the United States. Trump won 6.47% of the vote, his best performance in terms of percentage of votes cast in all three of his runs. Trump also won the highest raw total in the district over all three of his runs, though this was still lower than 2012.\nDespite overwhelmingly voting Democratic, the district still shifted right by approximately 3 percentage points from 2020, in addition to all 50 states shifting right from 2020 to 2024. Harris won the lowest vote share in the district since 2004, though she still won over 90% of the vote.\nPrimary elections\nRepublican primary\nThe District of Columbia Republican presidential primary was held on March 1–3, 2024, alongside primaries in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota.\nThe District of Columbia was one of only two jurisdictions not to be won by Trump in the 2024 Republican primaries, the other being Vermont.\nDemocratic primary\nThe 2024 District of Columbia was held on June 4, 2024, alongside primaries in South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey, Montana.\nStatehood Green primary\nThe D.C.
