Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands send nine delegates to convention.\nThe caucus will elect six of the nine delegates to the Republican National Convention. Delegates from the Northern Mariana Islands are not technically required to support a certain candidate at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa.\nMatt Romney, son of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, arrived in the Northern Mariana Islands to campaign on behalf of his father in the run-up to the caucus. This is the first time in history that any U.S. presidential campaign had visited the Northern Mariana Islands.\nGovernor Benigno Fitial endorsed Romney for President at a luncheon with Romney's son and daughter-in-law on March 9, 2012.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | Northern Mariana Islands Republican caucuses, 2012\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"160px\"| Candidate\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"75px\"| Votes\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"75px\"| Percentage\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"75px\"| Delegates\n|- align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"pink\"\n| align=\"left\"|   Mitt Romney\n| 740\n| 87%\n| 6\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\"| Rick Santorum\n| 53\n| 6%\n| 0\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\"| Ron Paul\n| 28\n| 3%\n| 0\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\"| Newt Gingrich\n| 27\n| 3%\n| 0\n|- align=\"right\"\n| colspan=\"3\"| Unprojected delegates:\n| 3\n|- align=\"right\"\n| Total:\n| 848\n| 100%\n| 9\n|}\nSee also\n* Republican Party presidential debates, 2012\n* Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012\n* Results of the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P12/events.phtml?s=c&f=m The Green Papers]: Major state elections in chronological order"
