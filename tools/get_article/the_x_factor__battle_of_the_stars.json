Pop Idol was meant to air in its place as Celebrity Pop Idol but was stopped shortly before transmission, when ITV picked The X Factor over it.\nNine celebrity acts participated, singing live in front of the nation and facing the judges of the previous The X Factor series, Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. Voting revenues were donated to the celebrities' chosen charities.\nCowell originally axed the format after its first airing, describing as \"pointless\", however, a revamped variation of the format aired in 2019, titled The X Factor: Celebrity with Cowell and Walsh reprising their roles as judges and Nicole Scherzinger replacing Osbourne on the panel as well as Dermot O'Leary taking over from Kate Thornton as host.\nContestants\nKey:\n: &ndash; Winner\n: &ndash; Runner-up\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n!

On 7 July 2019, Walsh spoke about the return of the series, stating, \"I go to Los Angeles on Tuesday, I go to Simon's house in Malibu, it's me Simon and Nicole [Scherzinger] and we're doing the celebrity one.\"\nReferences"
