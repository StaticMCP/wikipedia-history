      "text": "# East Korea Warm Current\n\nThe East Korea Warm Current (EKWC; ; ), is an ocean current in the Sea of Japan (East Sea). It branches off from the Tsushima Current at the eastern end of the Korea Strait, and flows north along the southeastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. Between 36° and 38° N, it encounters the North Korea Cold Current and veers southeast into the open sea.  The boundary between the two currents fluctuates throughout the year, creating large eddies. The interactions of these currents also have seasonal effects on the mixing and stratification in the southwest region of the Sea of Japan. As it flows northeastward, the East Korea current eventually rejoins the Tsushima Current. It's very hot and rainy in the summer.\nmoves eastward to the north of it,as a branch of the Liman Current(8)..]]\nSee also\n*Geography of South Korea\nReferences"
