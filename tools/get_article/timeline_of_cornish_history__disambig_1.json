First Cornish hedges.\n2000 BC\n*Mining in Cornwall has existed from the early Bronze Age around 2150 BC and it is thought that Cornwall was visited by metal traders from the eastern Mediterranean. It has been suggested that the  Cassiterides or \"Tin Islands\" as recorded by Herodotus in 445 BC may have referred to the Scilly Islands and Cornwall as when first discovered they were both thought to have been islands.\n1600 BC\n* Cornwall experiences a trade boom driven by the export of tin across Europe.\n750 BC\n* The Iron Age reaches Cornwall, permitting greater scope of agriculture through the use of new iron ploughs and axes.\n330 BC\n*Pytheas of Massilia (now Marseille), a Greek merchant and explorer, circumnavigated the British Isles between about 330 and 320 BC and produced the first written record of the islands. He described the Cornish as civilised, skilled farmers, usually peaceable, but formidable in war.\n100 BC\n*60 BC: Greek historian Diodorus Siculus named Cornwall \"Belerion\" – \"The Shining Land\",  one of the first recorded place names in the British Isles.\n*55 BC: First attempted invasion of British mainland by Julius Caesar. Over the next century, the Romans come to rule Cornwall, then part of Dumnonia.\n1st millennium\nRoman invasion and occupation\n(251–253 AD)]]\n* 19 AD: Total eclipse in Cornwall.\n* 43 AD: Claudian invasion of Britain begins. Roman control of Cornwall comes much later, but at an uncertain date.\n*55–60 AD: Construction of Nanstallon Roman fort near Bodmin, one of only a few Roman sites in Cornwall.\n* Roman villa at Magor Farm near Camborne occupied.\n*360 and after: various Germanic peoples came to Roman Britain: raiders, Roman armies recruited from among German tribes, authorized settlers: ref. Ælle of Sussex\n5th century\n(1905)]]\n*Cornwall's native name (Kernow) appeared on record as early as 400. The Ravenna Cosmography, compiled c. 700 from Roman material 300 years older, lists a route running westward into Cornwall and on this route is a place then called Durocornovio (Latinised from British Celtic duno-Cornouio-n – \"fortress of the Cornish people\"). In Latin, 'V' represented and was pronounced as a 'W' and the fortress name refers to Tintagel.\n*410: Emperor Honorius recalls the last legions from Britain. There is some uncertainty: some say that this \"rescript\" refers not to Britannia (= Britain) but to Bruttium in Italy.\n*Mid-5th century: first waves of settlers from Cornwall, and Devon, go to Brittany\n*433: The Britons call the Angles to come and help them (as mercenaries) against the Picts.\n*about 446: The \"Groans of the Britons\" last appeal (possibly to the Consul Aetius) for the Roman army to come back to Britain.\n*King Mark, of Tristan and Iseult fame, probably ruled in the late 5th century. According to Cornish folklore, he held court at Tintagel. King Salomon, father of Saint Cybi, ruled after Mark.\n6th century\n*500: The Kingdom of Cornwall emerged around the 6th century which included the tribes of the Dumnonii and the Cornish Cornovii. The origins of the neighbouring Kingdom of Wessex are also in this period.\n*490 to 510: likely range of dates for the Battle of Mons Badonicus, in which Romano-British Celts defeated an invading Anglo-Saxon army.\n*535/536: Volcanic winter of 536 cause European famine.\n*After 540s: Plague of Justinian, which would affect all of Europe.\n*577: Battle of Deorham Down near Bristol results in the separation of the West Welsh (the Cornish) from the Welsh by the advance of the Saxons. The earliest Cornish saints systematically convert Cornwall to Christianity, a considerable period before the conversion of the Anglo-Saxon peoples of England (the territory east of the River Tamar). According to tradition these early monastic foundations were made by Christian preachers or Christian Druids from other Celtic lands, mainly Ireland (as in the cases of Saint Piran and Saint Gwinear), Wales (as in the case of Saint Petroc and the Children of Brychan), and Brittany (as in the case of Saint Mylor).\n7th century\n*658: Battle of Peonnum drives the Britons from the area around Glastonbury abbey down to the River Parrett.\n*664: The Synod of Whitby determines that England is again an ecclesiastical province of Rome, with its formal structure of dioceses and parishes. The Celtic Church in Dumnonia is not party to the decision and the Cornish Church remains monastic in nature.\n* 682: Centwine, King of Wessex ''drove the Britons of the West at the sword's point as far as the sea''. (ASC) Difficult to place due to the nature of the South-West as a Peninsula but likely to be the North Coast around Bridgewater in Somerset as the border had been set at the River Parrett by the Battle of Peonnum.\n8th century\n*710: Battle of Llongborth (probably Langport in Somerset) fought to try to prevent further English expansion into Devon.King Geraint of Cornwall's led the fighting and his death is recorded in the Elegy for Geraint in the Black Book of Carmarthen. Tensions possibly exacerbated by Geraint's refusal to allow the Celtic church to follow the call of the English church (which was perhaps 300 years younger) to conform to the standards of Rome. The battle was fought against the West Saxon King Ine and his kinsman, Nonna.\n*722: Battle of Hehil – The Cornish Britons together with their friends and allies, push back a West-Saxon offensive at \"Hehil\", unlocated, but probably somewhere in modern Devon.\n*753: Cuthred of Wessex fights 'Against the Welsh (Cornish)' according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\n*755: Cynewulf fights 'Hard battles against the Welsh (Cornish).\n9th century\n*807: Unsuccessful Cornish alliance with Danes.\n*815: The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states \"& þy geare gehergade Ecgbryht cyning on West Walas from easteweardum oþ westewearde.\"...and in this year king Ecgbryht harried the Cornish from east to west.\n*825: Battle of Gafulforda, at an uncertain location, thought to be Galford, near Lewdown in West Devon. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle only states: \"The Wealas (Cornish) and the Defnas (men of Devon) fought at Gafalforda\".\n*838: Battle of Hingston Down: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that the Cornish in alliance with the Danes were defeated by Egbert of Wessex at \"Hengestesdun\", generally considered to be Hingston Down in eastern Cornwall.\n*850: Settlement at Mawgan Porth occupied. Archaeological excavations revealed a settlement comprising three groups of buildings ('courtyard houses') and a burial ground dating from around 850–1050. Finds included pottery and stone artefacts.\n*875: King Dungarth (Donyarth) of Cerniu (\"id est Cornubiae\") drowns in what is thought to be the River Fowey.\n*880s: the Church in Cornwall is having more Saxon priests appointed to it and they control some church estates like Polltun, Caellwic and Landwithan (Pawton, in St Breock; perhaps Celliwig (Kellywick in Egloshayle?); and Lawhitton). Eventually they passed these over to Wessex kings. However, according to Alfred the Great's will the amount of land he owned in Cornwall was very small.\n*late 9th century: The earliest known example of written Cornish is a gloss in a late 9th century Latin manuscript of De Consolatione Philosophiae by Boethius, which used the words ud rocashaas. The phrase means \"it (the mind) hated the gloomy places\".\n10th century\n, who supposedly visited the Isles of Scilly in 986. It is said an encounter with a cleric there led him to Christianise Norway.]]\n* 926: The entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reads....'This year fiery lights appeared in the north part of the heavens. And Sihtric perished: and king Aethelstan obtained the kingdom of the North-humbrians. And he ruled all the kings who were in this island: first, Huwal king of the West-Welsh (Cornish or Deheubarth); and Constantine king of the Scots; and Uwen king of the people of Guent; and Ealdred, son of Ealdulf, of Bambrough: and they confirmed the peace by pledge, and by oaths, at the place which is called Eamot, on the 4th of the ides of July [12 July]; and they renounced all idolatry, and after that submitted to him in peace.\n* 927: William of Malmesbury, writing around 1120, says that Athelstan evicted the Cornish from Exeter and perhaps the rest of Devon: \"Exeter was cleansed of its defilement by wiping out that filthy race\". ''The area inside the city walls still known today as 'Little Britain' is the quarter where most of the Cornish Romano-British aristocracy had their town houses, from which the Cornish were expelled. Under Athelstan's statutes it eventually became unlawful for any Cornishman to own land, and lawful for any Englishman to kill any Cornishman (or woman or child).\n* 928: It is thought that the King Huwal, \"King of the West Welsh\" (Cornwall or Hywel Dda of Deheubarth) was one of several kings who signed a treaty with Aethelstan of Wessex at Egmont Bridge.\n* 930: Armes Prydein, (the Prophecy of Britain), this early Welsh poem mentions 'Cornyw', the Celtic name for Cornwall. It foretells that the Welsh together with Cornwall, Brittany, Ireland and Cumbria would expel the English from Britain. This poem also demonstrates an early allegiance between the Celtic people of Britain.\n* 936: Athelstan fixed Cornwall's eastern boundary as the east bank of the Tamar. There is no record of Athelstan taking his campaigns into Cornwall and it seems probable that Huwal, King of the Cornish, agreed to pay tribute thus avoiding further attacks and maintaining a high degree of autonomy. Prior to this the West Saxons had pushed their frontier across the Tamar as far west as the River Lynher, but this was only temporary. It was long enough, however, for Saxon settlement and land charters to influence our modern day inheritance of placenames: between Lynher and Tamar there are today many more English than Cornish place names, as is also the case in that other debatable land between Ottery and Tamar in north Cornwall.\n* 944: Athelstan's successor, Edmund I of England, styled himself \"King of the English and ruler of this province of the Britons\"\n* 981: The Vikings lay waste \"Petroces stow\" (probably Padstow) according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\n* 986: Olaf Tryggvason allegedly visits the Isles of Scilly\n* 997: The Dartmoor town of Lydford, near the Cornish/Wessex border just east of the Tamar is completely destroyed by an angry mob of Danish Vikings. The surprise attack on Lydford is ordered by the King of Denmark and Viking leader Sweyn Forkbeard (previously, Lydford was believed to be impregnable against Viking attack). However, Cornwall is left alone as Sweyn Forkbeard has no intention of crushing Cornwall—unlike Wessex.\n2nd millennium\n11th century\n*1013: Cornwall's enemy and Anglo-Saxon neighbour, Wessex is crushed and conquered by a Danish army under the leadership of the Viking leader and King of Denmark Sweyn Forkbeard. Sweyn annexes Wessex to his Viking empire which includes Denmark and Norway. He does not, however, annex Cornwall, Wales and Scotland, allowing these \"client nations\" self-rule in return for an annual payment of tribute or \"danegeld\".\n*1014–1035: The Kingdom of Cornwall, Wales, much of Scotland and Ireland were not included in the territories of King Canute the Great\n*1016: Famine throughout Europe.\n*1066: Norman Conquest brings many Bretons into Cornwall. The Cornish and Breton languages are mutually intelligible at this point.\n*1066: William the Conqueror may have granted Cornwall to Brian of Brittany.\n*1067: Harold Godwinson's sons, who have taken refuge in Ireland, raid Somerset, Devon and Cornwall from the sea.\n*1068: The Battle of Exeter – the Cornish attacked the Saxon stronghold of Exeter but were eventually driven back by an Anglo-Norman army sent to mop up pockets of resistance.\n*1069: Brian of Brittany, lord of Cornwall, defeats the sons of Harold near the River Taw\n*1070: (ca.) Robert, Count of Mortain made Earl of Cornwall.\n*1086: Domesday Survey: the major landholders in Cornwall are Robert, Count of Mortain, King William, the Bishop of Exeter, and Tavistock Abbey\n*1099: Mount's Bay inundated by the sea making St Michael's Mount an island\n12th century\n*1120: Ingulph's Chronicle records Cornwall as a nation distinct from England.\n*1154–1214: (effective)/1242 (formal) Angevin Empire, which includes other Brythonic areas such as Brittany and parts of Wales.\n*1173: Reginald de Dunstanville, 1st Earl of Cornwall, grants a charter to his 'free burgesses of Triueru' and he addresses his meetings at Truro to: \"All men both Cornish and English\" suggesting a continuing differentiation. Subsequently, for Launceston, Reginald's Charter continues that distinction – \"To all my men, French, English and Cornish\".\n*1198: William de Wrotham (Lord Warden of the Stannaries) writes of those working tin in Cornwall paying twice the taxation of their Devon counterparts.\n13th century\n*1214: Battle of Bouvines confirms the French crown's sovereignty over the Duchy of Normandy's lands in Brittany and Normandy, meaning Cornwall and Brittany are once more in separate states.\n* 1235–1237: Cornish militia fight against the Scots\n(the magnum opus of mediaeval Cornish literature), written by an unknown monk in the late 14th century]]\n*1265: Work starts on the Lostwithiel Stannary Palace.

And there be many men and women the which cannot speake one worde of Englysshe, but all Cornyshe.\"\n*1548: Glasney College is closed and much of the cultural heritage held there is destroyed\n*1549: The Cornish rise up in the Prayer Book Rebellion—some 5,000 \"rebels\" were killed by mercenary forces. The main confrontations are the siege of Exeter, the battles of Fenny Bridges, Woodbury Common, Clyst St Mary, Clyst Heath (where 900 unarmed Cornish prisoners are killed) and Sampford Courtenay. Following this, Provost Marshal Sir Anthony Kingston is sent into Cornwall to seek retribution.

Charles refuses and dissolves Parliament after a mere 3 weeks, hence the name of the \"Short Parliament\"\n*1642: The Cornish play a significant role Civil War as Cornwall was a Royalist stronghold in the generally Parliamentarian south-west. The reason for this was that Cornwall's rights and privileges were tied up with the royal Duchy and Stannaries and the Cornish saw the Civil War as a fight between England and Cornwall as much as a conflict between King and Parliament.\n*1642–1646: The First \"English\" Civil War\n*1642: First Battle of Lostwithiel.\n*1643 January 19: Cornish Royalist victory at the Battle of Braddock\n*1643 May 15: Cornish Royalist victory at the Battle of Stratton.\n*1643 autumn: King Charles I issues a letter to the people of Cornwall thanking them for their support for the Royalist campaign which he wrote at Sudeley Castle.
