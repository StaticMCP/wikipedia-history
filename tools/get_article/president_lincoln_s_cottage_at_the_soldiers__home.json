In 2000 it was designated a national monument called '''President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument.'''\nPresident Abraham Lincoln and his family resided seasonally on the grounds of the Soldiers' Home to escape the heat and political pressure of downtown Washington, as did President James Buchanan (1857–1861) before him. President Lincoln's Cottage also served as the Summer White House for Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes (1877–1881) and Chester A. Arthur (1881–1885).\nHistory\nThe historic cottage, built in the Gothic Revival style, was constructed from 1842 to 1843 as the home of George Washington Riggs, who went on to establish the Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C.  Lincoln lived in the cottage June to November 1862 through 1864 and during the first summer living there, Lincoln drafted the preliminary draft of the Emancipation Proclamation. Mary Todd Lincoln fondly recalled the campus; in 1865, she wrote, \"How dearly I loved the Soldiers' Home.\"\nPoet Walt Whitman, who was living on Vermont Avenue near the White House in 1863, often saw the president riding to or from Soldiers' Home. He wrote in The New York Times, \"Mr. LINCOLN generally rides a good-sized easy-going gray horse, is dressed in plain black, somewhat rusty and dusty; wears a black stiff hat, and looks about as ordinary in attire, &c., as the commonest man...I saw very plainly the President's dark brown face, with the deep cut lines, the eyes, &c., always to me with a deep latent sadness in the expression.\" Whitman quoted this article in his 1876 book Memoranda During the War, adding the phrase: \"We have got so that we always exchange bows, and very cordial ones.\" In 1889 it was named Anderson Cottage after the late Brevet Major General Robert Anderson, who was one of the founders of Soldiers' Home.\nThe Soldiers' Home stands on  atop the third highest point in Washington. The Home was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 7, 1973, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 11, 1974. In 2000, the cottage was placed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 11 Most Endangered list. Then about 2.3 acres (9,300 m2) of the Home was proclaimed a National Monument by President Bill Clinton on July 7, 2000. The National Trust took on the restoration which was completed in 2007. The Cottage exterior was restored to the period of Lincoln's occupancy in the 1860s in a joint venture by the Philadelphia firm J. S. Cornell & Son, and Stephen Ortado, Historic Structures, according to the standards of the National Park Service. Today the property is leased by the National Trust for Historic Preservation through a cooperative agreement with the Armed Forces Retirement Home; and is managed by President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home, an independent 501(c)(3) charity.\nPresident Lincoln's Cottage opened to the public on February 18, 2008. A reproduction of the Lincoln desk on which he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation was commissioned by the Trust for use in the Cottage. The original drop-lid walnut paneled desk is in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House. The desk is the only surviving piece of furniture that is known to have been placed in the White House and the Cottage during the Lincoln era.\nThe adjacent Robert H. Smith Visitor Education Center features exhibits about the Soldiers' Home, wartime Washington, D.C., Lincoln as Commander-in-Chief during the Civil War, and a special exhibit gallery. President Lincoln's Cottage and Visitor Education Center is normally open to the public for tours seven days a week.\nGallery\nFile:Lincoln Cottage Rear Entrance.jpg|Rear of the Cottage, September 2018\nFile:Lincoln Statue at Lincoln's Cottage.jpg|Statue of Lincoln in front of the Cottage, September 2018\nSee also\n* List of residences of presidents of the United States\n* 150th Pennsylvania Infantry\n* United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery\nReferences\n* Preservation Vol 59, Number 1, Jan/Feb 2007, page 6\nExternal links\n* Official website: [http://www.lincolncottage.org/ President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home]\n* [https://www.npshistory.com/publications/srs/lincoln-soldiers-home-srs.pdf President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument Special Resource Study – National Park Service]\n* [https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/president-lincolns-cottage President Lincoln's Cottage at Google Cultural Institute]\n* [https://www.afrh.gov/washington Armed Forces Retirement Home: Washington, D.C.]\n* [https://savingplaces.org/places/lincolns-cottage National Trust for Historic Preservation: President Lincoln's Cottage]\n* [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-114/pdf/STATUTE-114-Pg3348.pdf Presidential Proclamation 7329 of July 7, 2000]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090109121441/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1506&ResourceType=District National Historic Landmark information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030627040627/http://tour.cua.edu/heritage/history/founding/lincoln.cfm Letters from Mary Todd Lincoln]\n* [https://www.c-span.org/video/?179036-1/lincolns-sanctuary-soldiers-home Booknotes interview with Matthew Pinsker on ''Lincoln's Sanctuary: Abraham Lincoln and the Soldiers' Home'', December 21, 2003.]"
