Manager Willie Waddell later tried to boost the team's forward line by handing Stewart an attacking position, but during the experiment his regular place at wing half was taken by Frank Beattie. Stewart moved on to St Mirren, where he played in their 1961–62 Scottish Cup final defeat, then Ayr United.\nCoaching career\nIn November 1972, Stewart took charge of the Scotland women's national football team for the first ever official women's international match to take place in Britain, a 3–2 defeat to England at Ravenscraig Stadium in Greenock.\nReferences"
