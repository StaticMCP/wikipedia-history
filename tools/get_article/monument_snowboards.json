      "text": "# Monument Snowboards\n\nMonument Snowboards is a snowboard company based in the Mid-Atlantic founded in late 2001 by David Tran. It was first started as a house brand for Capitol Board Room (originally owned by Chad and Mike Ellis), a snowboard shop based in Virginia, then emerged into its own brand with a full team by 2003.\nThe original Capitol Board Room Snowboard/Skateboard/Surf shop was open from 1996-1998 under the Ellis brothers.  Tran kept the web site up as part of his portfolio after the shop closed. After a trip out west in 1999, owner Dave Tran had all of his equipment stolen from Dulles Airport ($2,500 value) from United Airlines on his way out to Steamboat Springs, Colorado. He then decided to start up the online Capitol Board Room after talking with Chad Ellis and getting his blessing to use the name [http://www.ontaponline.com/view_article.php?article_id=10463 1].\nTwo years after starting up Capitol Board Room, Tran started Monument Snowboards. After picking up local Virginia rider, Jeremy Cline from Massanutten Mountain, Virginia, the company started to move from a generic house brand to its own entity by adding team members who worked at June Mountain, California, for the 2005 Transworld Snowboarding Magazine Team Challenge. In 2005, several team members were featured in DFI's snowboard video, \"the over surveillance.\" In 2006, the company put a video called \"Clouds Happen.\" For 2007, the company filmed and edited another film short called \"Frontcountry.\"\nEthan Deiss is featured in 2009's \"Think Positive\" (Role Model Productions), putting him in the spotlight with \"Jibber of the Year\" mentions from Transworld Magazine.\nMonument Snowboards has participated in numerous events including 2005 Transworld Snowboarding Team Challenge, and the 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 Snowboarder Magazine SuperPark event.\nMonument snowboards have been featured in the Washington Post, and numerous international publications.\nLinks\n* [http://www.monumentsnowboards.com Monument Snowboards website]\n* [http://www.capitolboardroom.com Capitol Board Room website]\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/11/AR2007011101844.html  Washington Post Sunday Source Article: 1/14/07]\n1[http://www.ontaponline.com/view_article.php?article_id=10463 Ontap Magazine Article - Background of Monument Snowboards]\n* [http://gonzorangers.com/?p=170 DC Snowboarding Scene]\n* [http://www.timeoutny.com/newyork/Details.do?page=1&xyurl=xyl://TONYWebArticles1/585-586/check_out/express_lane.xml TimeOut NY Product Showcase]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070102144643/http://www.southmainonline.com/cline/cline.html Southmain Interview with Jeremy Cline]\n* [http://www.rocktownweekly.com/rocktown/search_rockdetails.php?AID=209&key=jeremy%20cline&title=&author=&date1=&date2=  Rocktown Weekly interview with Jeremy Cline]\n* [http://www.deaflympics.com/games/result.asp?GamesID=34&EID=579  Jeremy Cline Deaflympics Results]\n* [http://www.northwave.com/?q=/team_rider/20 Doug Mercer profile on Northwave]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106103518/http://www.k5.com/page.asp?itemid=382  K5 Board Shop News with Doug Mercer Update]\n* [http://www.snowboard-revolution.com/module.php?name=WatchVideo&id=134 Doug Mercer Video Clip on SnowboardRevolution.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311141029/http://www.surfrider.org/capitol/whatwedo/news.html  Surfrider Foundation - DC Surfrider Raises $4,500 for Tsunami Relief]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927091922/http://www.snowboard-mag.com/node/16524  Press Release on Snowboard Magazine 11.16.06]\n* [http://www.twsbiz.com/twbiz/industrynews/article/0,21214,708533,00.html  Press Release on Transworld Snowboarding]\n* [http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=monument+snowboards Monument Snowboards on video.google.com]"
