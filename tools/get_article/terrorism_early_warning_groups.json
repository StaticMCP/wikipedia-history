It provides local responders and community leaders with information on the current threat and future prevention. Terrorism Early Warning (TEW) Groups are a model of fusion center that emphasizes operations-intelligence fusion for all phases of response and community protection. TEWs serve law enforcement investigative needs, fire service response, and medical (EMS and hospital), as well as public health (epidemiological intelligence). The LA TEW was named among the \"Top 100\" innovative programs by Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government: 16th Annual Innovations in American Government Awards (2003), and as a Finalist (top 5) in Mitretek Innovations in Homeland Security Award issued by Mitretek and the Ash Institute for Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy School (2004).\nTEW Mission\nEach individual TEW shares the following attributes:\n* Serves as the focal point for analyzing the strategic and operational information needed to respond to terrorism and protect critical infrastructure;\n* Is responsible for information sharing and intelligence fusion;\n* Performs net assessments to aid mission planning, decision-making, and allocation of resources in support of incident command during actual events.\nCollectively, individual TEWs form a node in the TEW network. The overarching mission for individual TEWs and the collective network follows:\nOverarching TEW Mission\nTo develop operational intelligence for area of operations, and contribute to the co-production of intelligence across the TEW and intelligence fusion community in order to prevent, counter and respond to terrorism and emerging threats by conducting indications and warning and operational net assessment.\n(Source:  National TEW Resource Center, February 2006)\nSharing Intelligence\nThe 9/11 Commission Report illustrated some shortcomings in intelligence sharing.  The TEWs are examples of state and local efforts that provide a mechanism for the collection, analysis and sharing of information.  The [https://www.dhs.gov/national-network-fusion-centers-fact-sheet National Network of Fusion Centers] emerged from the TEW network and other fusion center initiatives.\nResources\nThe LA Terrorism Early Warning (TEW) case study:\nJohn P.
