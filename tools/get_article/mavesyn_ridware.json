The parish had a population of 1,048 in 2001, increasing to 1,128 at the 2011 Census. It includes the villages of Hill Ridware, Rake End, Pipe Ridware and Blithbury, all of which lie between the River Trent and a small tributary, the River Blithe. To the east is the parish of Hamstall Ridware and to the south the larger village of Armitage.\n]]\nHeritage\nMavesyn Ridware contains two notable buildings: the parish church dedicated to St Nicholas and the Gatehouse of the erstwhile Manor House.\nThe name \"Mavesyn\" derives from the French Malvoisin, which was the name of the Norman family that acquired the estate after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The church contains many monuments to members of that family and to their successors as lords of the manor, the Cawardens and the Chadwicks.\nThe Gatehouse is timber framed with a later skin of brick and stone. Growth rings on the timbers indicate that the building was erected in 1391–1392.\nHigh Bridge crosses the River Trent on the edge of the parish, carrying to the road to Handsacre.\nAmenities\nThe village is not served by public transport, other than a minibus service to Handsacre or Rugeley, which must be booked in advance by phone or on the web. The nearest railway station is at Rugeley (5 miles, 8&nbsp;km).\nRidware has a bowls club and a youth club. There is a village hall for hire.\nNotable residents\n*Henry Fourdrinier (1766–1854), paper manufacturer and inventor, spent his last years at the Old Rectory.\n*Ashby Haslewood (1810–1876), first-class cricketer and educationalist, was rector of Mavesyn Ridware in 1866–1876.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Mavesyn Ridware\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072429/http://www.genuki.org.uk:8080/big/eng/STS/MavesynRidware/ GENUKI: Mavesyn Ridware]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091118175443/http://www.roman-britain.org/chase/places/mavesyn_ridware.htm Cannock Chase History: Mavesyn Ridware]"
