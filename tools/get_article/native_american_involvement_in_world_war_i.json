World War I involved many major groups, with Native American participation being one of the smaller groups that participated. Native Soldiers made up roughly 12,000 of the nearly 5 million American soldiers that served during the war. Of these 12,000, 6,500 Native men were drafted and roughly 5,000 more enlisted on their own. Native men were not the only ones that served in the war. 14 Native women also volunteered and served as army nurses in France. Those who served on the warfront held a variety of different positions. Typically, they held combat positions that were more dangerous like being snipers or scouts. Because of the more dangerous nature of the typical combat positions, Native soldiers were killed at a much higher percent than the U.S. average. Roughly 5 percent of all Native American soldiers were killed in combat, while only one percent of U.S. troops were killed overall. For the tens of thousands of Native Americans who did not go to the warfront, they supported at home. They did this by working in war industries, assisting in war relief efforts, such as supporting the Red Cross, and purchasing war bonds to help fund the cause. Despite Native war support, they faced consequences of the war on the home front. Native land steadily decreased because the cattle and sugar beet companies swayed the federal government to allow them more land. These companies did so under the rationale that they needed the land for supporting the war effort. After the war ended, Native contributions did not go unnoticed. Congress granted citizenship to all Native veterans in 1919, and later did the same for all American Indians with the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.\nCode Talkers\nBefore American troops were even deployed in World War I, American messages had been getting decoded by German forces. These messages being deciphered led to notable losses. With the involvement of Native American languages, particularly Navajo, these messages became much harder to decipher. Code Talkers were soldiers that used Native languages in order to communicate with fellow soldiers and relay information secretly. They became more well known in World War II, but the Native American soldiers during World War I laid the groundwork for their success. These Native American soldiers in World War I played an important role in the relaying of information between different groups because they made it vastly more difficult for their messages to be deciphered. At this time, Native Americans on the home front were discouraged from speaking their native languages. On the warfront, however, Cherokee and Choctaw troops used their native dialect to keep the German soldiers from intercepting important messages. Being able to secretly transmit messages to their allies helped them gain a strategic advantage.\nReferences\nCode Talkers Revolutionize Military Intelligence. (2024, October 20).
