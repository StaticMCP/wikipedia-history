This can include wildcat strikes, which are done without union authorisation, and slowdown strikes, where workers reduce their productivity while still carrying out minimal working duties. It is usually a response to employee grievances, such as low pay or poor working conditions. Strikes can also occur to demonstrate solidarity with workers in other workplaces or pressure governments to change policies.\nTimeline\nContinuing strikes from 1999\n* Cochabamba Water War\n* 1999–2000 El Salvadoran healthcare strike\n* 1998–2000 Kaiser Aluminum strike, 2-year strike by Kaiser Aluminum metalworkers in the United States.\n* 1999 UNAM strike\nJanuary\n* 2000 Uttar Pradesh electric strike, 11-day strike by Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited workers in Uttar Pradesh, India.\nFebruary\n* 2000 Boeing engineers' strike\n* 2000 Volkswagen South Africa strike\nMarch\n* 2000 Costa Rican protests\nApril\n* 2000 Finnish paper workers' strike\n* 2000 Indonesian teachers' strike\nMay\n* 2000 commercial actors strike\n* 2000 French security guards strike\n* 2000 Moulinex strike, 6-week strike by Moulinex workers in Barbastro, Spain.\n* 2000 Norwegian private sector strike\nJune\nJuly\n* 2000 South Korean bank strikes\nAugust\n* 2000 South Korean medical strike\n* Verizon strike of 2000\nSeptember\n* 2000 Copenhagen childcare strike\n* 2000 uprising in Egypt\n* 2000 Wallonian bus strike\nOctober\n* 2000 Italian McDonald's strikes, first strike by McDonald's fast food workers in Italy.\n* October 2000 protests in Israel\n* 2000 São Tomé and Principe health workers' strike\n* 2000–03 prisoners' hunger strike in Turkey\nNovember\n* 2000 Luxembourg cash-in-transit strike\n* 2000–01 Seattle newspaper strike\nDecember\n* 2000 Indian postal strike\n* Ukraine without Kuchma\nReferences"
