Juneau was a French trader with the American Fur Company. In 1818, the American Fur Company established a trading post in Milwaukee. Juneau decided to purchase the land between the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan and named it Juneau Town. He was the postmaster and the first president of the Village of Milwaukee. He was elected the first mayor of the City of Milwaukee in 1846. Juneau died in 1856 while making an Indian payment for the U.S. Government at a reservation in Keshena. Shoe manufacturers Charles T. Bradley and William H. Metcalf, friends of the Juneau family, donated the monument as a gift in remembrance of the first mayor of Milwaukee.\nReferences\n* ([https://archive.org/details/unveilingjuneau00junegoog copy])\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!27381~!0#focus Solomon Juneau from the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey]\n*[http://collections.lib.uwm.edu/u?/gfmmke,343 Juneau Monument], Greetings from Milwaukee, UWM Archives"
