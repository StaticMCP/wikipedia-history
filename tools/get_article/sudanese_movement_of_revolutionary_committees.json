The organization was established in May 1985. The movement, which emerged as an outgrowth of the Tripoli-based Sudanese People's Socialist Front, was financially supported by the Libyan government. The movement was led by Abdullah Zakaria (rumoured to have been a co-author of The Green Book).\nBy late 1987 the movement appeared largely dormant, as popular interest to take part in the activities of the Revolutionary Committees had been weak.\nReferences"
