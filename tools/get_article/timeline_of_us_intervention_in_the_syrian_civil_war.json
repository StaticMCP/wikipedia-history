Since early 2017, the U.S. and other Coalition partners have also targeted the Syrian government and its allies via airstrikes and aircraft shoot-downs.\n2014\nSeptember 2014: Airstrikes begin\nlaunching from  to strike ISIL targets in Syria on 23 September]]\nOn 22 September 2014, Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby confirmed that the United States and partner nations had undertaken airstrikes in Syria using fighters, bombers, and Tomahawk missiles in strikes authorized by President Barack Obama. The initial strikes were coordinated by United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) with Arab partner forces from Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting or supporting airstrikes. The overnight strikes targeted about 20 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) targets, including headquarters buildings. Sources in Syria claimed that among the target locations was Brigade 93, a Syrian army base that ISIL militants had recently captured, and targets in the ISIL-held towns of Tabqa and Tell Abyad in Raqqa Governorate. The U.S. also targeted the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front and the Khorasan group in Syria's Aleppo and Idlib provinces. At least 70 Islamic State fighters, 50 fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, and eight civilians were killed overnight by the airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) conflict monitor, while eight strikes were launched against the Khorasan group.\nU.S. F-22 Raptor stealth fighters were reportedly among the U.S. aircraft striking targets in Syria on the first night of the campaign, carrying out their first ever combat missions since entering service in 2005. Syrian military radar was \"passive\" during the first air strikes, making no known attempt to counter coalition aircraft. The U.S. had deployed HARM missiles as a precaution, as it was uncertain how Syria's air-defense network would react.\nOn 24 September, the U.S.-led coalition conducted a second round of airstrikes on Islamic State facilities in Syria, targeting ISIL-held oil production facilities the group was using to fund their activities. Some targets were apparently also mobile production facilities which were most likely not refineries. In a third round of airstrikes on ISIL targets on 25 September, Arab partners led the U.S. in strikes against militant-held oil facilities in northeastern Syria. Saudi Arabia and the UAE dropped 80 percent of the bomb tonnage in the third round of strikes, compared to other strikes in which the U.S. led the way. On 26 September, the U.S. carried out a fourth round of airstrikes on ISIL targets in eastern Syria, targeting ISIL heavy equipment and destroying four battle tanks in Deir ez-Zor Governorate.\nIn a fifth round of airstrikes on 27 September, the U.S. led strikes along with Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE against ISIL forces in the Kobanî Canton of Syrian Kurdistan, destroying two armored vehicles and an unknown number of fighters. The area was under siege by ISIL militants, with the fighting recently forcing over 100,000 Syrian Kurds to flee across the border to Turkey.\nOn 28 and 29 September, the U.S. carried out two rounds of strikes against ISIL positions across four provinces. Among the facilities targeted was the entrance to the largest gas plant in Syria, in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, and ISIL training camps and vehicles near an ISIL-controlled grain silo in Manbij.\nOctober 2014\nIn an eighth round of airstrikes on 1 October, the U.S.-led coalition conducted daytime strikes against Islamic State forces besieging the primarily Kurdish town of Kobanî. The strikes were in support of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), who were defending the city. On 2 October, the U.S. and the UAE led a ninth round of strikes against ISIL forces across Syria, destroying an ISIL checkpoint near Kobanî, damaging a tank north of the Sinjar Mountain area, destroying a tank west of Raqqa, and destroying several ISIL facilities east of Aleppo.\nIn a tenth round of airstrikes on 3 October, the U.S., assisted by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, struck ISIL forces in northern and eastern Syria, destroying an ISIL garrison south of al-Hasakah, destroying two tanks southeast of Deir ez-Zor and two modular oil refineries and a training camp south of Raqqa, and striking an ISIL building northeast of Aleppo.\nThe U.S. led an 11th round of airstrikes on 4 October, alongside Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, against ISIL forces across Syria.

Also on 12 October, the U.S. announced that the Turkish government had approved the use of Turkish military bases by Coalition forces fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq. These installations included key bases only  from the Syrian border and important U.S. military bases in Turkey such as the Incirlik Air Base. Despite the announcement of Turkish government approval, on 13 October, Turkish officials publicly denied that any agreement had been made over Coalition use of Turkish airbases, including Incirlik.\nIn a 20th round of airstrikes in Syria on 13 October, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia carried out eight airstrikes against ISIL forces.

In the following weeks, they are to join the 50 that are already in the country; their main aim is to advise, assist and expand the ongoing effort to bring more Syrian Arab fighters into units the U.S. supports in northern Syria to combat ISIL.\nMay 2016\nwith Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir during a meeting on Syria in May 2016]]\nIn late May 2016, more than a dozen U.S. special forces troops were seen in the village of Fatisah, less than  north of Raqqa. They were fighting near the front lines with the YPG and wearing both YPG and U.S. insignia on their military uniforms; the operators were helping call in fire support for local SDF forces and coordinating airstrikes from behind the front lines in their advance toward Raqqa. However, the Pentagon and White House insisted that the troops were not fighting ISIL on the front lines and were still participating in a non-combat mission known as \"train, advise and assist.\" Also in late May, a U.S. special forces operator was wounded north of Raqqa by indirect ISIL rocket or mortar fire.\nThe Telegraph reported that British special forces had been operating on the frontline in Syria, particularly in May when they frequently crossed the border from Jordan to defend a New Syrian Army (NSA) rebel unit composed of former Syrian special forces as it defended the village of al-Tanf against ISIL attacks. They mostly helped the unit with logistics such as building defenses and making bunkers safe. The NSA captured the village that month and faced regular ISIL attacks; an ISIL SVBIED drove into the base and killed 11 members of the NSA and injuring 17 others.

Much of the SDF advance was made possible by Coalition air support, with airstrikes being directed by special forces personnel on the ground. On the same day, four U.S. special operations troops in northern Syria were \"lightly\" wounded by shrapnel when an Islamic State anti-tank missile fired at a nearby vehicle exploded, but they quickly returned to duty.\nOn 16 June, supposedly as part of Russia's campaign to pressure the U.S. to agree to closer cooperation over Syria, Russian military aircraft bombed, with cluster bombs, a military outpost in al-Tanf in southeast Syria that was garrisoned by the New Syrian Army (NSA); U.S. and British special forces based in Jordan regularly worked with Syrian rebels at the al-Tanf outpost. The airstrike happened 24 hours after a detachment of 20 British special forces left the outpost. After the airstrike took place, U.S. commanders warned Russia that the garrison was part of the international coalition against ISIL and therefore should not be attacked, but 90 minutes later, nearby U.S. warplanes observed Russian jets dropping a second barrage of bombs on the outpost, killing four rebel soldiers. A U.S. spy plane overhead tried to contact the Russian pilots on emergency frequencies, but the Russians did not answer. U.S. officials demanded an explanation from Moscow, but they were told the Russian pilots struck the outpost because they \"thought it was an ISIL base\", Russian officials then said that Jordan had approved the strikes in advance, but Jordan denied this. Moscow also claimed its air command headquarters in Syria was unable to call off the strikes because the U.S. had not given them the precise position of the outpost.\nOn 29 June, as part of the 2016 Abu Kamal offensive – the offensive by the Pentagon-trained New Syrian Army and several hundred other rebels from different factions that aimed to capture Abu Kamal and sever ISIL's transit link between Syria and Iraq – rebel forces entered the al-Hamdan air base –  northwest of the border town Abu Kamal following intense clashes. This followed significant advances into ISIL-held territory near the Abu Kamal border crossing, the NSA said it had captured a number of ISIL positions on the outskirts of Abu Kamal, but a raid on the town at dawn was reported to have been repelled by militants. Fighting continued around the town, as coalition airstrikes were carried out on ISIL hideouts; the NSA also said it was coordinating the assault with Iraqi government forces, who were advancing on the border from the other side. The NSA issued a statement saying \"the NSA maintains control of the desert, the approaches to Abu Kamal, and maintains freedom of manoeuvre\". later on that day, ISIL militants ambushed the rebels, inflicting heavy casualties and seizing weapons, according to a rebel source. ISIL retook the airbase from the NSA and continued to advance against the rebels, recapturing some of the outposts the NSA had captured south of the town; Coalition helicopters dropped in \"foreign\" airborne troops on the southern edge of Abu Kamal to help the rebels in their advance; coalition jets also carried out eight airstrikes on ISIL targets in the Abu Kamal area. A contributing reasons for the failure of the U.S.-backed rebel operation was the withdrawing of air support at a critical moment; the aircraft assigned to the operation were ordered in the middle of the operation to leave the area and instead fly to the outskirts of Fallujah, where a large convoy of ISIL fighters, which U.S. commanders considered a \"strategic target\", had been seen trying to escape across the desert after the city was recaptured by the Iraqi army. The convoy was eliminated by American and British planes along with gunships and aircraft from the Iraqi air force.\nAugust 2016: Operation Euphrates Shield\nOn 7 August, as part of Operation Tidal Wave II, \"multiple\" coalition warplanes destroyed some 83 oil tankers used by the Islamic State near Abu Kamal.\nCNN reported that the Coalition carried out airstrikes in support of the Turkish intervention in Syria with Syrian opposition forces in August 2016, which seized the town of Jarabulus from ISIL and pushed south and west in an effort to clear the terror group from its border.

The strike marked the highest-profile killing of an ISIL member thus far.\nSeptember–October 2016: Coalition air raid on Deir ez-Zor\nOn 8 September, an airstrike allegedly carried out by the United States killed Abu Hajer al-Homsi (nom de guerre Abu Omar Saraqib), the top military commander of the renamed al-Nusra Front (Jabhat Fateh al-Sham) in the countryside of the Aleppo Governorate. Abu Hajer al-Homsi was one of the founding members of the al-Nusra Front and had taken part in the Iraq War against the U.S. when he was part of the processor organization al-Qaeda in Iraq. The Pentagon denied carrying out the strike and instead claimed Russia was responsible.\nOn 16 September, CNN reported that up to 40 U.S. special forces operators were accompanying Turkish troops and vetted Syrian opposition forces as they cleared ISIL from northern Syria.

Officially, the U.S. personnel were to conduct the same type of \"advising, assisting and training\" missions that the U.S. had been providing to moderate opposition and local anti-ISIL forces. The Washington Post reported that the contingent of Special Operations forces (SOF) assisting the Turkish and Syrian rebel forces around the cities of Jarabulus and al-Rai were sent at the request of the Turkish government.\nOn 17 September, two U.S. A-10s, two Danish F-16s, and a UK Reaper drone mistakenly bombed a Syrian Army-controlled base in the ISIL-besieged city of Deir ez-Zor. More than 62 Syrian soldiers were killed and at least 100 were wounded in the airstrike. ISIL forces attacked immediately after the Coalition airstrike and took the strategically important elevation near Deir ez-Zor airbase: Tharda (Thurda) mountain. According to Russian and Syrian government sources, SAA forces, supported by Russian and Syrian airstrikes, counterattacked and recaptured Tharda mountain by the end of the day, suffering additional losses, including one Syrian jet fighter. The USAF immediately issued an official explanation - it was a navigation\\intelligence mistake and bombing was stopped after Russian Air Force contact informed them about the SAA loses. The Danish Air Force confirmed that their two F-16 fighters participated in the airstrike, insisting that operations stopped the split-second they received the message from the Russians and explaining it as a mistake and was regretting the losses. Russian officials accused the U.S. in helping ISIL due to the air raid. Russia also called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the airstrike and the U.S. temporarily ceased airstrikes in the area. In response to the errant airstrike, the Syrian Armed Forces called it a \"serious and blatant attack on Syria and its military\".\nOn 3 October, Ahmad Salama Mabruk, a senior al-Nusra Front and previously Egyptian Islamic Jihad commander, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Jisr al-Shughur.\nNovember 2016\nloads a U.S.-made M2 Browning heavy machine gun in northern Aleppo, November 2016]]\nOn 8 November, Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election and began transitioning to becoming the next president and commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, succeeding the outgoing Obama administration that had ordered the Syrian intervention.

Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said, \"His removal degrades ISIL's ability to conduct further attacks in the West and denies ISIL a veteran extremist with extensive ties.\"\nStars and Stripes reported that in November 2016, airmen from the 621st Contingency Response Wing with a contingent of civil engineers, intelligence personnel, and security forces were temporarily deployed to expand and modify the airstrip that the airmen had established earlier in 2016 at an airbase where they deployed to near Kobani, so it can be used to assist in the offensive to retake Raqqa. The airbase gave the U.S. an additional location for its aircraft to support the Coalition and other anti-ISIL forces, but it had been used by U.S. forces limitedly due to the condition of the runway which restricted what types of aircraft could land there. General Carlton Everhart II, commander of U.S. Air Mobility Command, said that the base enabled aircraft to deliver critical supplies, equipment and help position forces; he added that airmen from the 621st group have supported anti-ISIL coalition forces on the ground in Syria.\nDecember 2016\n.]]\nOn 4 December, it was reported that a U.S. airstrike in Raqqa killed three key ISIL leaders, two of whom (Salah Gourmat and Sammy Djedou) were involved in plotting the November 2015 Paris attacks.\nOn 8 December, during the 4th Palmyra offensive, U.S.-led Coalition warplanes bombed an ISIL convoy near Palmyra in central Syria and destroyed 168 trucks carrying petroleum.\nOn 10 December, it was reported that the U.S. was sending 200 more special operations personnel to Syria, joining the 300 U.S. special forces already in the country.

On the same day, the Royal Jordanian Air Force launched several airstrikes on ISIL outposts in southern Syria.\nOn 4 February, a U.S. airstrike killed Abu Hani al-Masri, who was part of Ahrar al-Sham at the time of his death, but described by the Pentagon as a former al-Qaeda commander. It was reported that there was speculation that he was about to defect to Tahrir al-Sham before his death.\nOn 26 February, in Al-Mastoumeh, Idlib, a U.S. drone strike killed Abu Khayr al-Masri, the deputy leader of al-Qaeda. He had been released and allowed into Syria as part of a prisoner swap between Iran and al-Qaeda in 2015. The U.S. airstrike also killed another Tahrir al-Sham militant, who was traveling in the same car. It was later revealed in May 2019 that the missile used in the airstrike was a Hellfire R9X, which has a kinetic warhead with pop-out blades, intended to reduce collateral damage.\nMarch 2017: Regular U.S. forces arrive and the Battle of Tabqa\nnear Manbij, acting as advisors to the Syrian Democratic Forces, March 2017]]\nOn 8 March, various news outlets reported that regular U.S. troops, part of an amphibious task force, left their ships in the Middle East and deployed to Syria to establish an outpost from which they can provide artillery support for U.S.-backed local forces who were preparing to assault Raqqa in a battle to liberate the city from ISIL control. The deployment marked a new escalation in the U.S.'s role in Syria and put more conventional U.S. troops on the ground, a role that, thus far, had primarily been filled by Special Operations units. The ground force was part of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit; 400  U.S. Marines from the Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, 4th Marines were tasked to crew an artillery battery of M777 howitzers whilst additional infantrymen from the unit will provide security. Resupplies were to be handled by a detachment of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element. A defense official with direct knowledge of the operation said the Marines were flown from Djibouti to Kuwait and then into Syria. By then, there were 900 U.S. soldiers and Marines deployed to Syria in total (500 special forces troops were already on the ground to train and support the SDF); under the existing limits put in place by the Obama administration, the formal troop cap for Syria is 503 personnel, but commanders have the authority to temporarily exceed that limit to meet military requirements.\nThere were approximately 100 U.S. Army Rangers in Stryker vehicles and armored Humvees deployed in and around Manbij in northern Syria, U.S. officials said. Officially, they were deployed there to discourage Syrian, Russian, or Turkish troops from making any moves that could shift the focus away from an assault on ISIL militants, specifically preventing them from inadvertently coming under fire. The U.S. believed the pressure on ISIL in Raqqa was working &ndash; a U.S. official said that intelligence indicated some ISIL leadership and operatives were continuing to try to leave the city. He added that there was also U.S. intelligence indicating the city was laced with trenches, tunnels, roadside bombs and buildings wired to explode, which, if correct, indicated that the U.S. was able to gather intelligence from both overhead surveillance aircraft and people on the ground. However, the official also noted that \"Raqqa will probably not be the final battle against ISIS\" and added that the group still had some personnel dispersed in areas south and east of the city. According to the official, the U.S. estimated that ISIL could have had roughly as many as 4,000 fighters in Raqqa. An official told The Guardian that in addition, the U.S. was preparing to send hundreds of troops to Kuwait on stand-by to be ready to fight ISIL in Syria if needed and the number would be fewer than 1,000. The Independent reported that Colonel John Dorrian, a spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, said the artillery unit and the Army Rangers would not have a front line role.\nOn 16 March, a U.S. drone strike hit a mosque west of Aleppo and killed between 45 and 49 people, mostly civilians. The location was assessed by the U.S. military as a meeting place for al-Qaeda and claimed that the airstrike hit a target across the mosque and was not targeted at the mosque itself.\nStars and Stripes reported that on 28 March, an airman assigned to the 21st Space Wing died in a non-combat incident (possibly of natural causes) in northern Syria.\nOn 22 March, hundreds of SDF fighters, with an undisclosed number of U.S. Special Operations troops operating as their advisers, launched a large-scale heliborne assault on ISIL around the area of the Tabqa Dam. They were inserted on the southern bank of the Euphrates river behind ISIL's defenses to take them by surprise; Colonel Joe Scrocca, an OIR spokesman, said that as a result of the air insertion behind ISIL lines, the SOF-SDF force did not come under fire. The following day, there was heavy fighting in the area; Col. Scrocca added that the ground forces were supported by helicopter gunships, U.S. Marine 155mm artillery and U.S. airstrikes.\nAirwars reported that March 2017 saw the greatest number of munitions dropped during the war thus far &ndash; 3,878 munitions on ISIL targets in both Syria and Iraq, based on figures published by United States Air Forces Central Command &ndash; as well as the highest number of civilian deaths (between 477 and 1,216 non-combatants, 57% of which were in Syria) to date, likely caused by Coalition strikes, exceeding casualties caused by Russian strikes for the third consecutive month. Significant incidents that were attributed to Coalition strikes occurred in Tabqa and Kasrat al-Faraj during the Battle of Tabqa. The deadliest incident occurred in al-Mansoura, where local witnesses said at least 33 civilians were killed in a former school used to house displaced persons, although this was denied by the Coalition.\nApril 2017: Shayrat missile strike\nvehicles drive through Qamishli onwards to the Syria-Turkey border after border clashes between the YPG and Turkey]]\nOn 6 April, U.S. special forces conducted a landing operation against ISIL west of Deir ez-Zor. Two Coalition helicopters airdropped soldiers in the area who then interdicted a car on route from Raqqa to Deir ez-Zor. During the operation, U.S. forces killed four ISIL commanders and extracted a Jordanian spy who had infiltrated ISIL and served as one of its leaders. CNN reported that the operation took place near Mayadin and that one of the ISIL commanders killed by U.S. forces was Abdurakhmon Uzbeki, a top facilitator and close associate of ISIL's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi; he was also connected to the 2017 New Year's nightclub bombing in Turkey.\nOn 7 April, in response to chemical weapon attacks (most notably the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack) against Syrian civilians allegedly by the Syrian government, the U.S. launched missile strikes on the airfield from which the chemical weapon attacks were allegedly launched. This incident marked the first deliberate direct attack by the U.S. on the Assad government. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as being based on false intelligence and against international law, suspended the Memorandum of Understanding on Prevention of Flight Safety Incidents that had been signed with the U.S., and called an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.\nOn 8 April, ISIL militants attacked a U.S. garrison at al-Tanf in Southern Syria: the garrison's main gate was blown up with a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED), followed by a ground assault of about 20-30 ISIL militants, some of whom were wearing suicide vests. The U.S. Central Command said that the ″U.S. special operators″ at the base along with other coalition members and ″U.S.-backed Syrian fighters″, supported by multiple airstrikes, repelled the attack, with no American casualties. The Telegraph reported that during the battle, ISIL militants also ambushed a convoy of reinforcements from an allied rebel group who were trying to relieve the base.\n, April 2017]]\nCNN reported that on 11 April, a misdirected U.S. airstrike near Tabqa, during the ongoing Raqqa offensive, killed 18 SDF soldiers.\nMay 2017\nThe BBC reported that on 9 May, a Royal Air Force drone strike stopped an ISIL-staged public killing. The hellfire missile killed an ISIL sniper positioned on a rooftop set to shoot civilians attempting to walk away. No civilians were harmed and other ISIL fighters fled on motorbikes.\nThe Independent reported on 12 May that SDF forces had seized control of the Tabqa Dam after a deal struck by the SDF and around 70 ISIL militants; the deal included the dismantling of IEDs and booby traps, the surrender of heavy weaponry and withdrawal of remaining ISIL fighters from Tabqa city.\nOn 18 May, the U.S. conducted airstrikes on a convoy of a pro-government militia during the 2017 Baghdad–Damascus highway offensive. According to a U.S. defense official, before the strikes were conducted, government troops were warned they were getting too close to Coalition forces garrisoned at al-Tanf but did not respond. According to the U.S., four or five vehicles were destroyed, including a tank and two bulldozers. In contrast, the Syrian Army reported that two tanks were destroyed and a Shilka SPAAG was damaged. Eight soldiers were killed.\nJune 2017: Battle of Raqqa begins\n2nd Battalion/10th Marines Battery F (Freedom) provide fire support to the SDF & SOF with M777A2 howitzers during the Battle of Raqqa]].\nOn 6 June, SDF ground troops backed by Coalition airstrikes launched the battle for Raqqa. USCENTCOM reported that 4,400 munitions were fired in support of operations in Raqqa, a dramatic increase from previous months.\nAlso on 6 June, U.S. aircraft conducted airstrikes on over 60 troops, a tank, artillery, antiaircraft weapons, and armed technical vehicles from pro-government forces that had entered what the Coalition called the al-Tanf \"deconfliction zone\". On 8 June, a U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft shot down a drone and other aircraft destroyed two armed pick-up trucks belonging to pro-government forces that moved near U.S. backed fighters at al-Tanf.\nOn 18 June, a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22 after it allegedly bombed an SDF position in Ja'Din, south of Tabqa. A statement by the Syrian Army claimed that the plane was on a mission to bomb ISIL militants. The same day, pro-government forces captured the village of Ja'Din following an SDF withdrawal. On 20 June, a U.S. F-15E shot down a pro-government Shahed 129 drone near al-Tanf after it \"displayed hostile intent\" and allegedly advanced towards Coalition forces.\nAcross Iraq and Syria, Airwars tracked 223 reported Coalition airstrikes with civilian casualties during June 2017, likely killing a minimum of between 529 and 744 civilians (including at least 415 in Syria, mainly in Raqqa governorate, making it the second mostly deadly month for civilians since the strikes began in 2014. Significant reported incidents included 3 June in Raqqa (20 civilians), 5 June (hitting civilians fleeing conflict), and 8 June in Raqqa (including reported white phosphorus use and a mosque hit).\nAugust 2017\nOn 21 August, U.S. forces in northern Syria were fired on by Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army units near Manbij, and returned fire in a short firefight.\nOn 29 August, following the Qalamoun offensive, ISIL militants were surrounded by Lebanese, Hezbollah and Syrian forces on both sides of the Lebanon–Syria border. They negotiated a safe-passage deal so that 670 ISIL fighters and their relatives would be taken from the border in vehicles to Abu Kamal. The U.S. military disapproved of the deal; Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said the deal undermined efforts to fight the ISIL in Syria. U.S. aircraft carried out airstrikes, blocking the road the ISIL convoy was travelling on, before it reached ISIL-occupied territory in Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Dillon added that other U.S. airstrikes hit militants apparently attempting to join the stranded militants in the convoy. The Independent later reported that the convoy was trapped in between the towns of Humayma and al-Sukhnah.\nSeptember 2017\nduring counter-ISIL operations in southern Syria, November 2017]]\nOn 3 September, the Independent reported that 400 ISIL militants and their families traveling in the convoy that was trapped by U.S. airstrikes in Syria in late August had abandoned their vehicles and began travelling on foot to the Iraqi border.\nDecember 2017\nCNN reported that on 12 December, Maghawir Al-Thawra fighters accompanied by U.S. advisers intercepted a convoy of about ten vehicles that was passing through the 55&nbsp;km \"de-confliction\" zone surrounding the coalition base at al-Tanf; a firefight ensued, resulting in 21 ISIL fighters killed and a further 17 captured.\nCNN reported that on 13 December, two U.S. F-22A fighters intercepted two Russian Su-25 jets that crossed the \"de-confliction line\" multiple times. An Air Forces Central Command spokesman said that \"The F-22s conducted multiple maneuvers to persuade the Su-25s to depart our de-conflicted airspace, including the release of chaff and flares in close proximity to the Russian aircraft and placing multiple calls on the emergency channel to convey to the Russian pilots that they needed to depart the area.\"  One U.S. defense official said that a Russian Su-35 fighter was also involved in the incident.\nOn 22 December, Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said that Australia will end their air strikes against the Islamic State and recall its six Super Hornet aircraft. Payne added that other Australian operations in the region would continue, with 80 personnel who are part of the Special Operations Task Group in Iraq, including Australian special forces, continuing their deployment.\n2018\ncriticized the United States' support for Kurdish YPG fighters in northern Syria.]]\nJanuary 2018\nMilitary Times reported on 12 January that Coalition aircraft carried out more than 90 airstrikes between January 4 and January 11 near the Iraq-Syria border.\nMilitary Times also reported that on 20 January, U.S. airstrikes targeting an ISIL headquarters and command and control center in the Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV) near Al-Shaafah killed nearly 150 ISIL militants. According to a press release, SDF fighters provided target observation and intelligence on the target.\nFebruary–March 2018: The Khasham engagement\nAccording to U.S. military officials, on 7 February, in deliberate air and artillery strikes, the U.S.-led coalition killed more than 100 pro-government fighters in the Euphrates River valley in Deir ez-Zor province after they launched an \"unprovoked attack\" against the Syrian Democratic Forces. Syrian state news corroborated the events, but insisted that the Kurdish forces were mixed in with ISIL forces; it also stated that ten Russian mercenaries were among those killed.\nCNN reported that on 30 March, Master Sergeant Jonathan J. Dunbar of Delta Force and Sergeant Matt Tonroe of the British Special Air Service were killed by an IED blast during a mission in Manbij, the objective of which was – according to Pentagon spokesman Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway – to \"kill or capture a known ISIS member.\"\nApril–June 2018\nOn 14 April, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S., France, and the United Kingdom had decided to carry out a series of military strikes against the Syrian government. The strikes came in the wake of the Douma chemical attack.\nOn 1 May, the SDF, in coordination with the Iraqi Armed Forces, announced the resumption of their Deir ez-Zor offensive to capture the final ISIL enclaves near the Iraqi border and along the Euphrates. By 3 May, the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group had joined in support of the SDF's anti-ISIL operations.\nNovember 2018\nOn 1 November, the Coalition began a series of joint patrols with the Turkish Armed Forces along the frontlines of the Kurdish-controlled Manbij region and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army's territory. The move was seen as a part of a \"roadmap\" to ease tensions between the NATO ally and U.S. backed Kurdish forces, and reduce violence between Kurdish and Turkish-backed elements.\nOn 21 November, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced the U.S. would set up new observation posts along the Turkish border in northern Syria in order to reduce skirmishes between Turkish forces and armed Kurdish militants in the region such as the border clashes in late October-early November. Mattis affirmed that it was a co-operational endeavor with Turkey and it will not require additional U.S. troops to be deployed to Syria.\nDecember 2018: Initial announcement of U.S. withdrawal\nairstrike on an ISIL fuel truck in al-Susah, 29 November 2018]]\nPresident Donald Trump, declaring \"we have won against ISIS,\" unilaterally announced on 19 December 2018 that the remaining 2,000-2,500 U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn. Trump made the announcement on Twitter, overruling the recommendations of his military commanders and civilian advisors, with apparently no prior consultation with Congress. Although no timetable was provided, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders indicated that the withdrawal had already been ordered. Various sources indicated that Trump had directed that the withdrawal be completed within 30 days. However, Reuters was told by a U.S. official that the withdrawal was expected to take 60 to 100 days. Following Trump's surprise announcement, the Pentagon and State Department tried to change his mind, with several of his congressional and political allies expressing serious concerns about the sudden move, specifically that it would hand control of the region to Russia and Iran and abandon America's Kurdish allies.\nCNN reported on 24 December that during the weeks before Trump's withdrawal announcement, national security advisor John Bolton told senior officials to meet directly with anti-ISIL coalition partners to assure them that America would remain in Syria until Iran had left. One senior administration official commented that Trump's decision was \"a complete reversal,\" done \"without deliberation,\" reportedly leaving allies and partners \"bewildered.\" According to one CNN analysis, the announcement reportedly came as the Coalition had reason to believe ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his top commanders were possibly cornered in a small pocket of northern Syria, \"in a Tora Bora situation\" akin to the region where al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden escaped from American forces in 2001.\nOn 27 December, administration officials stated that USCENTCOM's troop withdrawal plan entailed the withdrawal taking place over several months instead of weeks, falling in line with Trump's post-announcement comments that the pullout of U.S. troops would be \"deliberate and orderly.\" By the end of the month, it remained unclear whether anti-ISIL air operations would continue post-withdrawal. By 31 December, after U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and a group of generals held a luncheon with the president over the withdrawal, Graham tweeted that Trump would seek a more gradual withdrawal over a course of several months; a slow down of the withdrawal was not officially confirmed by the administration at the time.\nMany experts proposed that Trump could mitigate the damage of the withdrawal by using the CIA's Special Activities Center. Many believed Trump chose \"to replace U.S. ground forces in Syria with personnel from the CIA's Special Activities Center\" and that the process had already been underway for months. Already experienced in operations in Syria, the CIA had numerous paramilitary officers who possessed the skills to operate independently in harms way. While the CIA lacked the numbers to replace all 2,000 U.S. military personnel in Syria at the time and work alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces, but their model was based on fewer enablers and support.\n2019\nJanuary 2019\nairstrike on an ISIL building in al-Shaafah, 4 January 2019]]\nOn 6 January 2019, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, while on a trip to Israel and Turkey, said that the pullout of U.S. troops from Syria depended on certain conditions, including the assurance that the remnants of ISIL forces are defeated and Kurds in northern Syria were safe from Turkish forces. However, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected the call to protect Kurdish troops, whom he regarded as terrorist groups. On 10 January, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. would withdraw its troops from Syria while continuing the battle against ISIL. He also stated that there would be no U.S. reconstruction aid for areas controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad until Iran and its \"proxies\" had left.\nOn 11 January, Coalition spokesman Col. Sean Ryan confirmed the U.S. troop withdrawal process from Syria had begun. \"Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movements,\" he said. The SOHR observed that the Coalition had started scaling down its presence at Rmeilan airfield in al-Hasakah. U.S. defense officials said it had begun the removal of equipment, but not yet troops, and that the total number of U.S. soldiers in Syria may temporarily increase in order to provide security for the final pullout. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian welcomed what he believed was a slower, more effective withdrawal by the U.S. after pressure from its allies.\nOn 15 January the Coalition released fresh numbers regarding their ongoing operations in both Syria and Iraq. Between 30 December 2018 and 6 January 2019, the Coalition conducted 575 air and artillery strikes against ISIL in Syria; the strikes destroyed 105 ISIL mortar and rocket artillery units, 50 IED manufacturing sites, 26 vehicles, 19 weapons caches, and two UAV systems. Between January 7 and 13, airstrikes in the MERV near the Iraqi border also killed around 200 militants including four senior commanders.\nOn 29 January, with ISIL cornered in its final redoubt due to the Kurdish-led conquest against it in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan proclaimed at his first news conference as SecDef that the Coalition will liberate all of the Islamic State's remaining self-proclaimed caliphate in \"two weeks\". \"I'd say 99.5 percent plus of…the ISIS-controlled territory has been returned to the Syrians. Within a couple of weeks it will be 100 percent,\" Shanahan said. He added that the U.S. is still in the early stages of what he called a \"deliberate, coordinated, disciplined withdrawal,\" from Syria and that \"very important dialogues going on in major capitals\" about support to Syria once the U.S. leaves, were ongoing.\nFebruary 2019: Battle of Baghuz\nPresident Donald Trump reiterated his support for withdrawing American ground troops from both Syria and Afghanistan in a series of tweets on 1 February amid proliferating concerns among America's allies, politicians, analysts, and local activists over a feared power vacuum in Syria post-withdrawal. \"I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the 'Endless Wars' of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end. We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace after 18 long years,\" Trump tweeted. The day prior, the U.S. Senate had issued a rebuke of the president cautioning against the \"precipitous withdrawal\" of military forces; furthermore the United States Intelligence Community contradicted the president on its perception of the global threat ISIL continued to pose during a Senate committee hearing. A draft Pentagon report emerged on 1 February warning that ISIL could regain territory in Syria within a year following a U.S. disengagement from Syria. On 5 February, CENTCOM commander General Joseph Votel noted during a Senate Armed Services Committee testimony that he had not been consulted prior to Trump's decision to withdraw American forces, reinforcing the notion that the U.S. withdrawal was ordered completely unilaterally from the White House without prior consultation with relevant military advisors and Defense Department personnel.\nOn 6 February, President Trump, while at a summit of 79 foreign ministers and officials that assisted in the global coalition against ISIL, predicted a formal announcement of a final victory against ISIL as early as the following week. \"Remnants - that's all they have, remnants - but remnants can be very dangerous,\" Trump said in regards to ISIL. \"Rest assured, we'll do what it takes to defeat every ounce and every last person within the ISIS madness\". The Wall Street Journal, citing State Department officials, reported on 8 February that the U.S. pullout was expected to be complete by April, with the majority of ground troops expected to be already withdrawn by mid-March. A U.S. official confirmed to Reuters that the withdrawal included pulling troops from al-Tanf.\nAn Operation Inherent Resolve summary on Coalition activity between 27 January and 9 February detailed air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq and Syria. The Coalition conducted 176 strikes in Syria. Targets included: 146 ISIL tactical units, 131 supply routes, 53 fighting positions, 31 staging areas, 14 VBIEDs, 13 pieces of engineering equipment, 11 explosive belts, nine tankers for petroleum oil and lubricants, eight tactical vehicles, five command and control nodes, four buildings, three aircraft operations areas, three tunnels, two petroleum oil and lubricant storage facilities, two manufacturing facilities for IEDs, two artillery pieces, two weapons caches, and one armored vehicle.\nAfter the SDF's assault on Baghuz Fawqani began on 9 February, CENTCOM commander Joseph Votel told CNN on 11 February that ISIL losing physical territory does not mean the end of the organization. \"Putting military pressure on [ISIL] is always better, it's always easier when you are there on the ground, but in this case our President has made a decision and we are going to execute that and so it's my responsibility as the CENTCOM commander working with my chain of command to look at how we do that,\" adding that the completion of the U.S. pullout was \"weeks away...but then again it will be driven by the situation on the ground\".\nTrump tweeted late on 16 February urging European countries to repatriate the over 800 captured suspected ISIL members from Syria, warning the U.S. may be forced to release them otherwise. Kurdish prisons could not hold the ISIL members and all their families, totaling around 2,000 people, indefinitely. The Kurds called the situation a \"time bomb\". The U.S.-Kurdish demand to take responsibility got mixed responses from Europe. German foreign minister Heiko Maas said repatriation would be possible only if returning fighters could be immediately taken into custody, which would be \"extremely difficult to achieve\" without proper judicial information. France, whose citizens made up the majority of European ISIL recruits, said it would not act immediately on Trump's call but would take militants back \"case by case,\" and not categorically. Britain has said its fighters can return only if they seek consular help in Turkey, while acknowledging repatriation was a dilemma. Belgium’s justice minister Koen Geens called for a \"European solution,\" urging \"calm reflection and a look at what would pose the least security risks.\" The Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said the issue was \"one of the greatest challenges ahead of us for the upcoming months.\"\nAfter announcing the U.S. would keep a \"peacekeeping\" force of around 200-400 troops in Syria – instead of the initially planned total withdrawal – on 22 February, senior Trump administration and defense officials stated the decision was an endorsement of a plan pressed by U.S. military leaders for some time, calling for an international force, preferably NATO or regional Arab allies, of 800 to 1,500 troops that would monitor a safe zone along Syria's border with Turkey.\nMarch–April 2019: Talon Anvil Baghuz strike and ISIL territorial collapse\nOn 10 March, John Bolton stated that he was \"optimistic\" France and the UK would commit personnel to the planned observer force. He also reiterated the U.S. commitment to keep troops in Iraq.\nOn 18 March, during the ongoing Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, the U.S. Air Force's Talon Anvil special operations unit (a Delta Force unit within the larger Task Force 9) bombed a group of people in Baghuz, killing up to 80 (64 civilians and at least 16 ISIL militants). According to CENTCOM spokesman Captain William (Bill) Urban, the U.S.-backed SDF called in air support on a position following a recent ISIL counterattack that almost overran them, but the only UAV above the battlefield recorded standard-definition video and the only available offensive aircraft was an F-15E jet; however a high-definition coalition UAV was operating in the area, unbeknownst to Talon Anvil. The SDF, the standard-definition UAV operator, and Talon Anvil all concluded there were no civilians in the area, with the latter approving the airstrike, in which the F-15E dropped three 500&nbsp;lb. bombs on the gathering, reportedly to the surprise of drone activity analysts. According to Capt. Urban, hours after the strike, the UAV operator reported possible civilians in the area, and a bomb damage assessment and investigation acknowledged there were civilian casualties but called the bombing \"legitimate self-defense strikes\" and \"proportional due to the unavailability of smaller ordinance at the time of the request,\" citing video showing \"multiple armed women and at least one armed child\". The 64 civilians were likely exclusively women and children and the airstrike was covered up by the U.S. military—it was not included in the coalition's annual civilian casualty report and the site was reportedly bulldozed—and it was not revealed to the public until mid-November 2021 amid media reports of a possible war crime cover up in Syria. Urban added that procedures were changed following the strike, requiring the \"strike cell\" on the ground to coordinate with coalition aircraft and the usage of only high-definition drone surveillance before such strikes are ordered.\nOn 20 March, in response to new developments in Baghuz, President Trump predicted that the remaining ISIL holdout would be cleared \"by tonight\" during a speech at the Lima Army Tank Plant in Lima, Ohio. \"The caliphate is gone as of tonight,\" he said, as he used maps depicting ISIL's territorial collapse since November 2016; later, the November 2016 map was shown to actually be a map from 2014 when ISIL was at its peak territorial size, before the Coalition's anti-ISIL operations.\nOn 23 March, the SDF announced victory in the battle for Baghuz, signifying the territorial collapse of ISIL in Syria, a critical milestone for the U.S.-led Syrian intervention. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that the physical caliphate was defeated but ISIL was not and that there were over 10,000 completely unrepentant fighters left in Syria and Iraq. He expected the U.S. to be in Syria for the long haul with a very capable partner in the Syrian Democratic Forces. He said that the U.S. partnership with the SDF was a model to follow, like the partnership with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and with the Kurdish Peshmerga in Iraq as the northern front against Saddam Hussein.\nU.S.-Turkish negotiations over joint troop patrols in a designated safe zone along the northern Turkish-Syrian border continued into late April as the UK and France rejected a plan to provide troops to a buffer zone between Rojava and Turkey, claiming their missions in Syria are only to fight ISIL. With their troop numbers set to be cut to 1,000 in upcoming months, the U.S. reportedly prefers a narrower strip of land to patrol than the approximately 20 miles that Turkey has proposed. The Turks would send their own troops into the buffer zone while only demanding U.S. logistical help and air cover. The Turkish proposal reportedly saw push back as the Americans prefer to avoid a situation that effectively pushes the Turkish border 20 miles into Syria, further increasing the chances of clashes with the Kurds instead of reducing it.\nMay 2019\nThe Syria Study Group, a U.S. Congressionally appointed panel of experts tasked with assessing the situation in Syria, similar to the Iraq Study Group appointed in 2006, released an interim report on 1 May endorsing the view that instead of a draw down, the U.S. should reassert its presence in Syria, citing the prospect of a potential ISIL resurgence, Russian \"prestige\" after successfully propping up the Assad government, perceived Iranian entrenchment in the country, and al-Qaeda retaining control in the form of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's dominance in northwestern Syria, a region U.S. warplanes rarely venture to due to the nearby presence of Russian air defenses deployed on behalf of the Syrian government. The report argued that the U.S. should step up attempts to isolate Assad and counter Iranian influence in the region; it also argued that the U.S. should take in more Syrian refugees, the admittance of which the Trump administration has reduced from thousands to just a few dozen in recent years. The report further underlined the differing views between the president and comparatively more hawkish Congress on what direction to take the U.S.'s commitments in the country.\nJune–July 2019\non an escort mission in northeastern Syria, 22 June 2019]]\nOn 30 June 2019, in a rare operation against non-ISIL elements, the U.S. carried out a strike against an al-Qaeda in Syria (AQ-S) leadership meeting at a training facility west of Aleppo, which killed eight jihadists from the Guardians of Religion Organization, including six commanders: two Tunisians, two Algerians, an Egyptian and a Syrian. It was the first known coalition strike in western Syria since February 2017 due to the U.S. and Russia arranging an unofficial deconfliction boundary that largely bars any substantial U.S. forces from venturing into the region. The U.S. did not specify what assets were used in the strike.\nIn July, U.S. special anti-ISIL envoy James Jeffrey continued to urge Britain, France and Germany to assist the U.S.'s ground mission in Syria. \"We want ground troops from Germany to partly replace our soldiers\" in the area as part of the anti-Islamic State coalition, Jeffrey told German media.\nDuring a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Deputy Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Michael Mulroy stated that the SDF has over 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters in custody from over 50 countries—in which they spend quite a bit of time, effort and resources taking care of—and that the U.S. has pushed these countries to take back their citizens. The number of American nationals who joined ISIL on the battlefield is small compared to countries like France and the UK, where several hundred foreign fighters traveled from.\nAugust 2019\nOn 7 August 2019, the U.S. and Turkey reached a framework deal to jointly implement a demilitarized buffer zone in the areas between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers—excluding the Manbij area—in northern Syria. Terms of the deal include joint U.S.-Turkish ground patrols, the relocation of some Syrian refugees into the area, and the withdrawal of heavily armed YPG and YPJ forces and fortifications from the Syria–Turkey border, leaving the areas under SDF military council rule instead. On 24 August, the SDF began dismantling border fortifications under the supervision of U.S. forces. On 27 August, YPG units began withdrawing from Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.\nOn 31 August, in a second attack against non-ISIL militants in western Syria since June 30, the U.S. carried out a series of airstrikes on a Rouse the Believers Operations Room meeting between Kafriya and Maarrat Misrin, killing over 40 Guardians of Religion militants, including several leaders. Local human rights NGOs reported that 29 civilians were\nkilled in the attack, naming 22, of whom six were children.\nOctober 2019: U.S. drawdown from north Syria, return, & al-Baghdadi's death\nbeing loaded unto a C-17 Globemaster III in Kobanî for airlift, 25 October 2019]]\nFollowing a phone call between U.S. President Trump and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the White House released a statement on 6 October that Turkey would \"soon\" be carrying out a planned military offensive into Kurdish-administered northern Syria, so U.S. troops in northern Syria began to withdraw from the area to avoid interference with the offensive. The White House statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIL fighters (held by Kurdish forces) to Turkey. This initial withdrawal involved around 50 troops from two towns along the Syrian border, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The sudden withdrawal proved controversial as U.S. Congress members of both parties sharply denounced the move, including Republican allies of Trump such as Senator Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell. They argued that the move betrayed the American-allied Kurds, and would only benefit ISIL, Turkey, Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime.\nAfter the U.S. pullout, Turkey launched its ground offensive into Kurdish-controlled areas in northeast Syria on 9 October, spelling the collapse of the Turkey–U.S. Northern Syria Buffer Zone agreement established in August 2019. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied that the U.S. had given a \"green light\" for Turkey to attack the Kurds. However, Pompeo defended the Turkish military action, stating that Turkey had a \"legitimate security concern\" with \"a terrorist threat to their south\". On 13 October, Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated that the entire contingent of nearly 1,000 U.S. troops would be withdrawn from northern Syria entirely, because the U.S. learned that Turkey will \"likely intend to extend their attack further south than originally planned, and to the west\". Hours later, the Kurdish forces, concluding that it would help save Kurdish lives, announced an alliance with the Syrian government and its Russian allies, in a united effort to repel the Turkish offensive.\nOn 25 October, Mark Esper confirmed the U.S. had partially reversed its Syria pullout and that the U.S. had a new dedicated mission to guard and secure Syrian oil and gas fields and infrastructure, assisted by the deployment of mechanized infantry units. Though the deployment of mechanized units shifted the U.S.'s special forces-led Syria intervention to a more conventional military operation, therefore leaving a heavier U.S. footprint in Syria, Esper stressed that the U.S.'s \"core mission\" in Syria continued to be defeating ISIL.\nDeath of al-Baghdadi\n's hideout in Barisha, Idlib before the U.S. special forces raid, 26 October 2019]]\nOn 26 October 2019, U.S. Joint Special Operations Command's (JSOC) 1st SFOD-D (Delta Force) conducted a high-profile raid into Idlib Governorate near the border with Turkey that resulted in the death of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nNovember 2019\nObservers raised concerns about the potential for deliberate or inadvertent altercations in north and east Syria, as U.S. forces were now operating in close proximity to Russian, Syrian, and Turkish-backed forces in accordance with an 22 October Russian-Turkish \"safe zone\" arrangement and a prior SDF-Syrian government deal. By November, there had been a steady flow of pictures and videos online showing U.S., Syrian, and Russian forces passing by each other in northern Syria. On 3 November, a U.S. convoy came within one kilometer of a Turkish-backed rebel artillery strike near Tell Tamer, with no U.S. personnel injured.\nOn 7 November, the Pentagon reiterated that the U.S.'s only mission in Syria is to \"defeat ISIS\", and that securing Syrian oil fields is \"a subordinate task to that mission\" by denying ISIL any potential oil revenue. Though ISIL's territory and physical caliphate had been decimated, \"We've not said that ISIS as an ideology and ISIS as an insurgency has been eliminated,\" a Pentagon spokesman stated. The Pentagon also insisted that the revenue from the Syrian oil fields the U.S. is protecting will go to the SDF, not the U.S., despite President Trump raising the possibility in late October of American oil companies taking over the oilfields. On 19 November, a report by the Pentagon Inspector General, citing Defense Intelligence Agency assessments, starkly concluded that the U.S. pullout from most of northern Syria on 6 October and the subsequent 9 October Turkish ground offensive gave ISIL the \"time and space\" to regroup as a potent transnational terror threat. The report assessed that Turkey's incursion impacted the U.S.'s relationship with the Syrian Kurds, greatly shifted the balance of power in north Syria, and disrupted CJTF-OIR and SDF counter-terrorism operations to the point of giving ISIL ample room to quickly resurge. The report, like the Syria Study Group's May 2019 report, further underscored the differing attitudes of the Trump White House and the intelligence community on the state of the intervention.\nOn 10 November, in regards to U.S. troop levels in Syria, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley stated that there will be fewer than 1,000 troops remaining \"for sure\" and estimated that number would be around 500 to 600; Defense Secretary Mark Esper echoed the 600 estimate three days later, adding that numbers could fluctuate depending on the situation on the ground and the possible increase of European presence in the country. On 23 November, General Kenneth McKenzie, USCENTCOM commander, stated that there were \"about 500 U.S. personnel generally east of the Euphrates river east of Deir al Zor up to Hasaka\" that were working closely with the SDF and were set to reconvene anti-ISIL operations in coming days and weeks. SDF-U.S. counterinsurgency coordination reportedly recommenced that same day.\nLieutenant Colonel David Olson, a spokesman for the U.S. Third Army, confirmed that the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and many elements of the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team, particularly elements of the South Carolina Army National Guard's 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment that were deployed to Syria on 31 October, had been quietly withdrawn and returned to Kuwait by the end of November, remaining less than two months in the country. Olson said approximately 100 members of the 30th ABCT remained in Syria conducting \"logistical and support tasks\" and that the Bradleys were pulled out because commanders deemed the additional firepower no longer necessary. Observers noted that the deployment of the armored units demonstrated a willingness and ability for the U.S. to deploy heavy armed forces to forward positions in Syria.\nDecember 2019\nand Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley testify to Congress about the Syria intervention, 11 December 2019]]\nOn 3 December, a U.S. coalition drone strike on a minivan in Atme killed two men. Their affiliations were not immediately clear, but one man was reportedly Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham member Abu Ahmad al-Muhajir, a foreign trainer of Tahrir al-Sham's elite \"Red Bands\" unit. If confirmed, it would be the first reported U.S. strike specifically targeting the group since 2017. The vehicle was relatively intact and not exploded, and the men inside were \"mashed\" by the impact, leaving some observers to suggest the munition deployed was probably the Hellfire R9X missile, a Hellfire missile variant that uses a kinetic warhead utilizing sword-like blades to kill the target rather than an explosive. The missile is known for its precision kills that reduce collateral damage.\nOn 4 December, Mark Esper told Reuters that the U.S. had scaled down its presence in northeast Syria and consolidated its forces in the country to a flexible 600 troops, a 40 percent reduction in troop levels since Donald Trump's initial October order to withdraw 1,000; it was not clear if the 600 estimate included the ~200-250 troops at al-Tanf, which would raise the actual total estimate to around 800–850. Esper again suggested that U.S. troop numbers could further decline if more NATO allies volunteered personnel.\nLocal sources reported that a team of 15 Egyptian and Saudi engineers and technicians arrived at the al-Omar oil field in Deir ez-Zor on 13 December, reportedly tasked by the U.S. with enhancing oil production at the field and training locals to observe oil productivity in the area.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Russian and U.S. soldiers got into a \"brawl\" in Tell Tamer on 25 December, where a spontaneous meeting between Russian and American troops devolved into a fist fight, \"due to their presence in the same area\"; no one was reportedly hurt as the incident did not involve weapons. The U.S. troops were reportedly in the area with an interpreter to get to know the opinions of local residents. The Russian Ministry of Defense denied the claims, calling the SOHR report a \"hoax\".\n2020\nJanuary 2020\nOn 18 January, U.S. troops blocked a Russian convoy from entering Rmelan, where the U.S. is protecting oil fields under SDF control. Tension occurred between the two groups as U.S. soldiers asked the Russian soldiers to return to the Amuda district in northwest of Al-Hasakah Governorate. Tensions between Russian and American forces continued to grow as U.S. troops again blocked a Russian convoy from using a main road between two Kurdish-held towns on 21 January.\nOn 23 January, in regards to ISIL activity in Iraq and northeastern Syria, ambassador James Jeffrey stated there was no uptick in violence following the U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Jeffrey also acknowledged there had been \"dustups\" between American and Russian troops in Syria, but downplayed the apparent tensions.\nOn 24 January, U.S. Army Reserve Specialist Antonio Moore of 346th Engineer Company, 363rd Engineer Battalion—a sub-unit of the 411th Engineer Brigade—died when his vehicle rolled over during mine sweeping/route clearance operations at an unspecified location in Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Spc. Moore was on his first deployment after enlisting in May 2017. The U.S. Army had deployed dedicated route clearance combat engineer units in Syria since at least 2017.\nFebruary–March 2020\nOn 12 February, a group of Assad government supporters, including civilians and militiamen, blocked a U.S. military convoy in the village of Khirbet Amo, near Qamishli, resulting in clash that left one civilian dead and another injured. A coalition spokesman said the troops fired in self defense and that the incident was under investigation. One U.S. soldier sustained a \"minor superficial scratch while operating their equipment.\" According to the coalition, soldiers issued a series of warnings to de-escalate and then came under small arms fire before firing back.\nIn early March 2020, NPR's Tom Bowman accompanied an American patrol tasked with protecting oil fields in northeast Syria. He reported on a \"multiday\" drone attack on two oil fields, the first reported attack of its kind since the U.S. launched its mission to protect them. On 4 March, a drone of an unspecified type dropped a mortar round near where West Virginia National Guard soldiers—operating in Syria as part of the 30th ABCT—were sleeping at an oil field, and on 6 March, drones returned and dropped multiple mortar rounds; no soldiers were injured. The report noted the attacks left noticeable impact craters and \"sprayed\" oil tanks and at least one military truck. The West Virginian guardsmen reportedly repelled one of the drones, but it was unclear what weapon was used. It also remained unclear who exactly were operating the drones, but Army investigators told Bowman that some of the mortar-like munitions were 3D printed.\nMay–August 2020: Caesar Act, Syrian checkpoint skirmish, and Russian collision incident\nOn 30 May, Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR) released images of special operations forces personnel training at al-Tanf with an advanced optical sighting system, the Israeli-made Smart Shooter SMASH 2000 \"smart sight\", attached to their M4A1 carbines, suggesting that special operators in Syria were among the first American forces to deploy the system into a real combat zone. It remained unclear if any special operations units had adopted the computerized optic or if the training was part of field trials.\nOn 14 June, a U.S. coalition drone strike killed Guardians of Religion Organization leaders Khalid al-Aruri and Bilal al-Sanaani who were driving a vehicle in Idlib. There was reportedly no explosion and the target vehicle was relatively intact, with the roof and windshield impacted from above and one side shredded, leading observers to suggest the munition used was probably the kinetic Hellfire R9X missile that uses blades to eviscerate its target rather than an explosive warhead. Ten days later, on 24 June, Abu Adnan al-Homsi, logistics and equipment commander at the Guardians of Religion Organization, was also killed by a U.S. drone strike.\nOn 17 June, the U.S. imposed the Caesar Act on the Syrian government, regarded as the toughest American sanctions ever imposed on Syria, in a bid to pressure Assad to return to the UN and western-led peace process. The sanctions target Assad's inner circle, including his wife Asma, family members, and Russian and Iranian entities, and freezes the assets of any investors dealing with the country's energy, military, and intelligence agencies and infrastructure. The act was named after the Caesar Report.\nOn 23 July, Maj. Gen. Christopher Donahue of the 82nd Airborne Division confirmed that a U.S. paratrooper who died in Syria after suffering fatal injuries in a car crash was in fact on \"combat deployment.\" The paratrooper, Sgt. Bryan \"Cooper\" Mount of St. George, Utah, was said to be on his \"second\" combat deployment as well.\nOn 27 July, the Congressional Research Service issued a report, in which they outlined the American strategy in Syria which would aim to achieve: (1) the enduring defeat of the\nIslamic State; (2) a political settlement to the Syrian civil war; and (3) the withdrawal of Iranian-commanded forces.\nIn early August 2020, Syria's foreign ministry accused the U.S. and the SDF of stealing Syria's oil, in reference to a recent deal apparently signed by the SDF and an unidentified American company. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Senator Lindsey Graham both publicly acknowledged that the SDF had made an agreement with a U.S. firm to \"modernize the oil fields in northeastern Syria\". Damascus condemned the agreement as U.S. government-sponsored theft of the country's crude and deemed it \"null and void and has no legal basis.\" There was no immediate response from the SDF or U.S. officials in regards to the ministry's statements.\nOn 17 August, in the first direct clash since February 2018, Syrian personnel clashed with U.S. troops at a government checkpoint near Tal al-Zahab, in the southern Qamishli countryside where Russian, Syrian and American forces often patrol. According to the SOHR, the Syrian troops refused a U.S. patrol from passing the checkpoint near an air base with a deployed Syrian \"combat formation\", resulting in an exchange of gunfire after the patrol continued to pass through. The coalition said that its troops returned fire after coming under fire from the checkpoint and then \"returned to base\" after the gunfight. SOHR and state media said, however, that the patrol was initially repelled but deployed two attack helicopters 30 minutes later to attack the checkpoint with \"heavy machine guns\", killing one Syrian soldier and injuring two others. The coalition denied that it called in air support and said it launched an investigation into the fatal clash.\nOn 25–26 August, four U.S. troops were injured in a \"chaotic\" incident with Russian troops. According to U.S. officials, \"at approximately 10 a.m. (Syria Time), August 25,\" a coalition patrol encountered a Russian patrol near Dayrick, Syria, in which an armored Russian patrol vehicle eventually side-swiped an M-ATV during the interaction, causing four of the crew to suffer concussive-type injuries, described as minor in nature. The coalition patrol then departed the area. Video of the incident posted online showed a tense scene, with Russian military helicopters briefly seen hovering above the American vehicles as well as the armored vehicle collision. The U.S. condemned the \"reckless move\" that breached \"de-confliction protocols, committed to by the United States and Russia in December 2019\" and said the Russians had previously agreed to stay out of the area. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley contacted Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov about the incident, with specific details of the telephone call remaining private.\nSeptember–November 2020\nIn September 2020, the U.S. deployed 100 additional troops and six M2A2 Bradley IFVs from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, based in Kuwait, to north-eastern Syria. Additionally, CENTCOM said an AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel radar was to be deployed and \"the frequency of U.S. fighter patrols over U.S. forces\" would increase. Some U.S. officials said the reinforcements were in response to recent skirmishes and increasingly belligerent interactions with Russian soldiers in north-eastern Syria, with one official saying the deployment was a \"clear signal to Russia\" to \"avoid unprofessional, unsafe and provocative actions in north-east Syria\". \"The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation in Syria, but will defend Coalition forces if necessary,\" said a CENTCOM spokesman. The move was seen specifically as a response to the 26 August incident.\nOn 15 October, two commanders from the Guardians of Religion Organization, Abu Dhar al-Masri and Abu Yusuf al-Maghribi were killed by a U.S. drone strike.\nOn 22 October, at least 17 people with reported connections to al-Qaeda were killed by a U.S. airstrike during a dinner gathering in Jakarah, Salqin Subdistrict, Idlib.\nIt was reported on 30 November that an airstrike near the Iraq–Syria border killed an unidentified Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander and three other men traveling with him from Iraq and into Syria. The vehicle was struck after it entered Syrian territory. Iraqi security and local militia officials said the commander's vehicle had weapons in it and that pro-Iran paramilitary groups helped retrieve the bodies. Sources did not identify the commander nor elaborate on the exact time of the incident. It was not immediately known who conducted the strike, and Reuters could not independently verify the reports.\n2021\nFebruary–May 2021\nOn 21 February 2021, images emerged online of Avenger air defense systems purportedly being transported on a highway between the Iraqi city of Ramadi and the Syrian border. Though it was unclear which military units the Avengers belonged to, when and where the images were taken, and the destination of the reported convoy was uncertain, The War Zone online warfare magazine speculated that the Avengers were being transported to U.S. bases in Syria, where small drone attacks remained a persistent threat to U.S. forces since March 2020, according to officials. Observers suspected the drone attacks, carried out by small commercial drones such as quadcopters, were being conducted either by Iran-backed proxy elements or the Islamic State, which is known for its usage of drone warfare.\n2nd Battalion, 156th Infantry Regiment, and 2nd Platoon, 1st Battalion, 141st Field Artillery Regiment train with an M777 howitzer at Mission Support Site Conoco, an outpost near the Conoco gas fields in Syria, 14 June 2021]]\nIn March 2021, soldiers of the Louisiana National Guard stationed at Mission Support Site Conoco (MSS Conoco)—a makeshift U.S. military outpost established near the Conoco gas field—and another outpost named \"Green Village\", a base near Mayadin housing U.S. troops in dilapidated apartments once used by oil field workers, soldiers gave some details on their situation on the ground to the media. At Green Village, troops fire a long-range salvo from an M777 howitzer every two weeks into remote areas where ISIL insurgents are believed to be present. At MSS Conoco, a (tattered) U.S. flag is strung between 40-foot-tall gas processing towers in a deliberate display of American presence. \"We want them to know we are committed to this region,\" said one U.S. Army lieutenant.\nOn 22 April 2021, Politico reported that the Pentagon had been investigating suspected \"directed-energy attacks\" against U.S. troops in Syria since 2020, and that U.S. officials had identified Russia as a likely culprit. According to officials, in one incident in autumn 2020, several troops developed \"flu-like symptoms\", and the U.S. Congress's Gang of Eight and Senate Armed Services Committee were briefed on the development. The investigation was reportedly part of a larger Pentagon probe into suspected directed-energy attacks on U.S. personnel around the world. Following the Politico report, General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, testified to the Senate that he had seen \"no evidence\" of purported directed-energy attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East.\nGeneral Frank McKenzie and deputy commander of CJTF–OIR, British Brig. Gen. Richard Bell, visited four outposts in eastern Syria on 21 May 2021. During the trip, McKenzie met with coalition troops and commanders, along with SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, where, according to Abdi, they discussed security and economic challenges. McKenzie and Bell reiterated the coalition's mission to assist the SDF in combating the ISIL insurgency, but McKenzie said the issue of how long U.S. troops would remain in Syria was up to President Joe Biden. McKenzie also expressed support for Iraq's announced repatriation of 100 families from the Al-Hawl refugee camp, which he said remained a breeding ground for radicalization and a target of ISIL recruitment, despite recent security improvements. In March 2021, the SDF conducted a five day sweeping operation of the camp, arresting 125 suspects.\nJune–November 2021\npersonnel of Information Warfare Task Force-Central (IWTF-C) drop 42,000 anti-ISIL propaganda leaflets over villages in southeastern Syria, November 2021]]\nOn 10 July, a mortar shell landed near MSS Conoco, with no injuries reported. It was reportedly the fourth attack on or near U.S. troops or diplomats within a week, reportedly including one in which two service members were injured. No group claimed responsibility, but U.S. forces suspected Iran-backed proxy militias of carrying out such attacks.\nOn 20 October, five drones equipped with explosive charges attacked the al-Tanf garrison. There were no reports of injuries. U.S. officials reportedly held Iran and its proxy forces in the region responsible for the attack, with Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby calling the attack \"complex, coordinated and deliberate\" and saying it resembled previous attacks by Iran-backed Shia militias. According to an Associated Press report, Iran \"resourced and encouraged the attack,\" but the drones were not launched directly from Iranian territory. It remained unclear if the U.S. was considering retaliation, with Kirby stating \"if there is to be a response, it will be at a time and a place and a manner of our choosing, and we certainly won't get ahead of those kinds of decisions.\" Pro-Iranian media outlets suggested the drone attack was retaliation for a previous attack near Palmyra, which the Axis of Resistance reportedly accused Israel of conducting; U.S. officials denied American forces were involved. Israeli defense sources suggested drone attacks on coalition forces in Syria were part of a larger Iranian-led \"expansion campaign\".\nIn mid-November 2021, a New York Times investigation revealed that operations carried out by Talon Anvil, an Air Force special operations unit a part of Task Force 9, resulted in substantial civilian casualties between 2014 and 2019. After the 18 March 2019 Baghuz strike that killed up to 64 civilians was revealed to the public, defense secretary Lloyd Austin asked Gen. Frank McKenzie for a briefing on the strike, which occurred days before McKenzie became CENTCOM commander. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Pentagon was working on two studies on civilian harm, one of which focuses specifically on Syria.\n2022\n, prepare M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles for deployment in northeast Syria, 1 February 2022]]\nJanuary–April 2022: Al-Sina'a prison break and death of second ISIL leader\nOn 12 January 2022, the cabinet of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz decided to end the Bundeswehr's anti-ISIL mission in Syria, pending parliamentary approval. German military jets had been flying reconnaissance missions in Syria as part of the coalition until March 2020.\nBetween 20 and 30 January 2022, a bloody battle occurred in al-Hasakah when ISIL attacked Al Sina'a prison, triggering a violent prison riot that resulted in hundreds of prisoners, including important Emirs, escaping. SDF forces, supported by coalition airstrikes, clashed with ISIL and eventually ended the riot. Over 340 ISIL fighters and over 154 SDF personnel died in the battle, which was the largest ISIL attack since the battle of Baghouz in 2019.\nOn 3 February, U.S. special operations commandos raided the compound of ISIL leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi in Atme. During the raid, al-Qurashi detonated a bomb, killing himself and 12 other people, including four women and six children according to the White Helmets. Parallels were drawn to the 2019 raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi was succeeded by Abu al-Hasan al-Hashimi al-Qurashi.\nOn 1 April, U.S. Army General Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla assumed control of U.S. Central Command from Marine General Frank McKenzie, who retired the same day. Later in the year, in September 2022, Gen. Kurilla urged faster repatriation and reintegration of thousands of ISIL families from the al-Hawl refugee camp, long seen as a breeding ground for Islamic radicalization and ISIL recruiting ground. Kurilla said the current Iraqi repatriation rate of 125-150 families per month was too slow, and said CENTCOM was helping Iraq expedite the transfer of ISIL detainees held in Syria to face trial.\nJune–December 2022: Rocket attacks, continued raids against ISIL, and death of third ISIL leader\nU.S. raids and strikes against ISIL in Syria reportedly increased in July–December 2022. A report by the Lead Inspector General for Operation Inherent Resolve stated that ISIL conducted 74 attacks in Syria between July and September 2022.\nOn 27 June, a \"kinetic\" coalition drone strike in Idlib Governorate killed senior Hurras al-Din leader Abu Hamzah al-Yemeni as he traveled alone on a motorcycle, with CENTCOM stating he was a Yemeni citizen and that initial review indicated there were no civilian casualties in the strike. The White Helmets said the strike occurred just south of rebel-held Idlib city and that he was the only fatality in the strike, with his body being handed over to local morgue officials.\nOn 12 July, the U.S. announced top ISIL operative Maher al-Agal was killed and an unidentified associate was injured in a drone strike on their motorcycle in northwest Syria, near Jindires. Al-Agal was one of five top ISIL figures in Syria and Iraq, and he \"aggressively\" built the group's networks outside of the region, according to the U.S. military. The White Helmets said the strike occurred in the village of Khaltan and said al-Agal's associate later died from their wounds. CENTCOM announced on 6 October that ISIL weapons smuggler Wahid al-Shammri was killed in a U.S. helicopter raid in a village in northeast Syria, in Syrian government-held territory.\nOn 15 August, drones allegedly launched by Iranian-backed militias struck the al-Tanf base, resulting in \"zero casualties and no damage\" according to CENTCOM. According to a CENTCOM press release, between 24 and 25 August, more rocket attacks targeted the coalition's MSS Conoco and MSS \"Green Village\" bases in Deir ez-Zor governorate, prompting coalition forces to respond with M777 artillery, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and AC-130 gunship strikes against \"Iran-affiliated militants\" in the area, killing four enemy fighters and destroying seven rocket launchers. CENTCOM spokesman, Colonel Joe Buccino, called the 24 August strikes \"proportionate, deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimise the risk of casualties\" but did not identify the targets nor provide casualty figures. SOHR and activist collective DeirezZor 24 said pro-Syrian government Liwa Fatemiyoun's Ayash Camp was the target and that at least six Syrian and foreign militants were killed in the strikes.\nAt approximately 7:05 pm on 18 September, three 107mm rockets launched by an unidentified group struck MSS Green Village, causing no injuries or damage. A fourth rocket was discovered at the launch site, located 5&nbsp;km away from the base, according to CENTCOM.\nOn the night of 5 October, U.S. special operations forces conducted a helicopter raid near Qamishli, killing an ISIL official named Rakkan Wahid al-Shammri and injuring one of his associates. According to U.S. officials, al-Shammri smuggled weapons and fighters into Syria for ISIL. The raid was reportedly unilateral—it did not involve coalition personnel—and Russia was not notified via the de-confliction line prior to the operation due to the location and sensitivity of the operation. The next day, on 6 October at 6:23 pm local time, a U.S. airstrike in northern Syria killed two senior ISIL operatives: Abu 'Ala, the deputy leader of ISIL in Syria, and Abu Mu'Ad al-Qahtani, an ISIL official responsible for prisoner affairs. No U.S. personnel were injured and, according to an initial assessment, there were no civilian casualties. According to two U.S. defense officials, CENTCOM spent over 1,000 hours gathering intelligence on the targets in order to limit collateral damage. Syrian state media reported that the operation had killed one person and accused U.S. forces of having \"kidnapped\" several people.\nOn 10 October, CENTCOM stated that a 107mm rocket launched by an unidentified group struck the coalition landing zone in Rmelan without causing damage or injuries, and additional rockets were found at the launch site. On 17 November, rockets again targeted MSS Green Village, causing no injuries or damage.\nOn 20 November, after Turkish authorities implicated the PKK (and SDF) for a terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey launched cross-border air, drone, and artillery strikes into northern Syria against Kurdish positions, with at least one strike landing within 150 yards of American personnel. In response, U.S. commanders restricted joint ground operations with the SDF.

General Esbati revealed that relations had been strained throughout 2024 after Assad refused to let Iranian elements attack Israel from Syria and said Assad ignored efforts to reform, making his fall inevitable.

Esbati added that advanced U.S. defense systems (and fear of American retaliation) was the reason Iran was not launching normal missile attacks on U.S. bases.
