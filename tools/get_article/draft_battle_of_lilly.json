The KKK targeted Lilly, a small coal town in Pennsylvania, due to its significant population of Catholic immigrants who worked in local coal mines. The Klan aimed to assert its influence and intimidate the community, which had recently hired these immigrants and fired Klan members from their jobs.\nRiot\nOn the night of April 5, 1924, approximately 400 Klansmen arrived in Lilly by train to hold a demonstration. They planned to burn crosses and intimidate the local population. However, the townspeople, angered by the Klan's presence and actions, decided to resist. As the Klansmen marched, they were met with hostility from the residents, who used hoses to spray them with water and threw objects at them. The situation escalated into a violent confrontation, resulting in gunfire. Three local residents—Philip Conrad, Cloyd Paul, and Frank Miesko—were killed during the riot, and many others were injured. The townspeople's resistance ultimately forced the Klan to flee in disarray, marking a significant moment of defiance against Klan intimidation\n.\nAftermath and Significance\nThe events of that night had a significant and enduring impact on the community of Lilly and the broader efforts to confront the Ku Klux Klan in the Northeastern United States. The riot is widely regarded as a pivotal moment that contributed to the reduction of Klan influence in the region. In acknowledgment of this event, a monument was established in Lilly to honor the community members' resistance and resilience."
