The Guna Yala region is situated between Colombia and Panama, and traditionally the Guna were able to cooperate with Colombia and live peacefully by their own laws and customs. Following Panama's declaration of independence, the new government attempted to control the Guna Yala region and its people, and impose a Westernised and \"national\" culture in its place.\nThe laws introduced by the Panamanian government significantly influenced traditional Guna customs and culture. The San Blas Rebellion consisted of multiple attempts made by the Guna to resist this control, and fight back against Panamanian authorities. Resistance against this power resulted in the Revolution of 1925, which resulted in 27 deaths, and initiated the peace agreement involving the United States that followed.\nThis rebellion is also known as the Tule Revolution, or the Guna Revolution, and was a direct consequence of repression by the Panamanian government. The Guna felt this was crucial for their ethnic survival as the laws implemented by the new Panamanian government directly impacted traditional Guna education, dress and customs.\nThe Revolution was planned by Guna leaders, and the Guna received US backing for an autonomous region during the mediation process. Through those negotiations, peace was once again achieved. The Guna were made to withdraw their declaration of independence and abide by the laws of the Panamanian government, so long as their terms were agreed upon and the Panamanian authorities did not threaten to eradicate Guna traditions and customs.\nBackground\nPanama's independence\nIn 1903, Panama issued a declaration of independence from Colombia, with support from the U.S. government. At the time of their declaration of independence, the San Blas islands were situated in a strategic location on the Colombian border, and some villages remained loyal to Colombia. However, Panama's unity as nationality was in doubt, and Gunas claimed themselves as a distinctly non-Latin culture, demanding ethnic autonomy.\nPanamanian intervention in San Blas\nRealizing the significance of this region, the Panamanian government began to incorporate it into the new nation by establishing administrative control of the area and followed an assimilation program since 1904, when some villages of San Blas accepted the flag of Panama. In 1906, Panamanian government took 17 Guna students to be educated in the Western way, and in 1907 a priests entered San Blas with armed supporters. In 1909, a police border was introduced, leading to several conflicts between police officers and the Guna.\nThe Guna resisted the assimilation program. In 1910, President Carlos Mendoza was rejected in San Blas as President Porras five years later.\nForced assimilation\nIn 1919, Panamanian President Belisario Porras began a policy of forced assimilation. The government introduced bans which affected the wearing of some components of traditional woman's dress. The government introduced these laws to Westernize Guna society and assert control. They stopped Guna women from wearing their mola blouses, nose rings and leg and arm bindings, and forced them to wear Western style clothing.\nThere was a strong link between traditional dress and Guna culture and identity, which made it a subject for control and change by the Panamanian government. As a fairly conservative society, the men typically wore dress shirts and trousers and the women wore traditional colourful dresses called tulemolas which were handmade. They also wore multicoloured bracelets known as winnis, which were beaded and believed to keep unwanted evil spirits away.\nThe Guna greatly objected to the control on their cultural dress, and ethnic identity, and showed great strength in their reaction to the bans implemented by the government. For example, in 1925 for a three-year period following the revolution, women were required to once again adopt traditional dress as a form of rebellion against the government. Women on Nargana and other more progressive islands were forced to wear mola, even if they had never worn this traditional dress, and their noses had to be pierced by force.\nRevolution\nForces\nRichard Marsh\nIn 1925, the Guna leaders planned and arranged a major revolt. The leaders were advised and supported by Richard Marsh. Marsh later wrote their declaration of independence.\nMarsh was an American explorer who had initially gone to the Guna Yala region in the search of \"White Indians\", the lost ancestors of European heritage. During this trip he stumbled upon the Guna and quickly found them to be likeable people. He also began to learn of the cultural attacks that were being implemented by the Panamanian government in this area and on the Guna people. In order to raise awareness to this issue, he brought a legion of Guna across to North America, which gained the attention of both Canada and the United States.\nMarsh soon returned to Panama and became a spokesman for the Guna people despite his original intentions of his journey being in search of wealth.\nMarsh helped Guna rebel leaders organise the rebellion in 1925 which attacked the Panamanian government. He also assisted in writing their declaration of independence which declared a new Guna Republic.\nGuna Rebel Leaders\nThe main leaders involved in the revolt was the Chief of the island of Ustupu, Nele Kantule, and the Chief of the island of Ailigandi, Simral Colman.\nThe motivation for the attacks were to revolt against the Panamanian police and government. They planned to do this by attacking the islands that were being most controlled by Panamanian officials.\nAbout the Revolution\nOn 12 February 1925, a conference was held in Aligandi, which lasted 26 days. It announced the Republic of Tule and implemented its territorial borders. A flag was created to symbolise this planned uprising - it was yellow with red stripes on the top and bottom, and a swastika in the middle.\nTogether the Guna leaders coordinated attacks on many of the islands that were being controlled by the Panamanian police and government. Marsh assisted in planning these attacks across the islands. They planned the attacks on the main islands whom had been carrying out the Panamanian government's policies which encouraged ethnocide, and implementing the most control on the Guna people.\nThe revolt began on 22 February in 1925. It lasted three to four days and resulted in fewer than thirty deaths overall.\nLullabies\nLullabies played an essential role in the Guna rebellion. Guna society is fundamentally matriarchal, and lullaby singing is a key part of their culture. Lullabies are only sung by Guna women to their children, and the messages conveyed in these lullabies were used to advise children about behaviour and common sharing. This made lullabies extremely influential in shaping the mindsets of Guna children and society as a whole.\nDuring the Revolution, lullabies were used as a means to encourage children  to defend their identity and culture. The children were told that they were the superior ethnic group, and that extinction of their culture and people would be disastrous and unrecoverable. These lullabies also had great religious significance as well during this time. Some lullabies recounted that the Guna had been given a land in which they can live peacefully by their God, Paba Tummat, and in return they must protect this land from foreign intervention.\nThese lullabies were used as a form of pop culture to influence the younger generation of Guna to protect their culture and identity against the Panamanian government and Western influence.\nResult\nThrough Marsh, the Guna made an appeal to the United States. Marsh wanted support from the United States following his proclamation of independence. The government of Panama similarly wanted support from the United States government vis-a-vis the Guna. They had only recently become a republic themselves, and were struggling without support from Colombia.\nThis resulted in mediation between representatives of the US government, the Panamanian government, and the Guna leaders. A warship was sent by the Americans to the Gulf of San Blas, and the Panamanians and Guna were invited to board the ship and negotiate their situation. This mediation resulted in a US-backed agreement for the Guna people of San Blas to remain independent and isolated from Panama, and to be self-governing. The agreement stated that if they ended hostilities, the Guna would be able to live as they had before.\nThe official peace agreement was signed on 4 March, by the American minister, John G. South. In this agreement, the Guna were promised respect for their traditions and culture, and a cease to certain laws which had imposed on their education system and traditional customs such as their dress. The Panamanian government pledged to protect and support the rights of the Guna people. In return for this offering, the Guna promised to cease their revolt by putting down their weapons, and withdraw their declaration of independence. They also promised to abide by the laws and regulations of the Panamanian government so long as they continued to abide by their agreement in respecting Guna customs.\nThis peace treaty was later followed by an agreement in 1938 which recognised the Guna Yala territory as being a reserve, and later the establishment of a representative body (The Guna General Congress) which would be recognised by the Panamanian government.\nPolitics\nFollowing the peace agreement issued in 1925, it took time for the adjustments to be made and for Guna society to integrate into Panamanian politics. Although a few Guna villages did participate and vote in the Panamanian elections of 1920 and 1924, they did not fully immerse themselves in Panamanian politics until the elections of 1932.\nUp until the late 1920s, the Guna villages were still very much divided into two camps, one being Pro-Colombian and the other Pro-Panamanian due to their history. This resulted in the leaders of both factions voting for different parties in the 1932 election in Panama.\nHowever, by 1935, 1000 Guna voted in the election, and 2738 voted in 1940. By 1945 Guna people were recruited at leadership level, this showing their slow but steady inclusion into Panamanian politics.\nThe San Blas Islands today\nThe Guna of San Blas, whose population was numbered around 10,000 then, has since increased to around 35,000. There now exist 49 communities across the Guna Yala region, and the entire region is governed by the Guna General Congress.\nTheir economy relies mainly on agriculture, tourism, fishing, and other handiwork production, with the sale of molas and migrant labour being other sources of income.\nDespite struggles during the revolution, the making and wearing of molas is still considered to be an important and integral part of Guna identity and culture, and the women are proud to be the only people in the world who can make this dress.\nHowever, more recently internal pressures such as climate and social change have resulted in the Guna having to expand their tourism industry. The expansion of this industry, enabling more visitors to stay on the Islands, and the development of hotels have been challenging for the Guna and their culture. Many hotels have exploited Guna employees and culture. This has resulted in the Guna controlling and limiting much of the tourism industry, making it much more difficult for Westerners to travel here.\nSee also\n* Guna Yala\n* Guna people\n* History of Panama (1904–1964)\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Price, K.
