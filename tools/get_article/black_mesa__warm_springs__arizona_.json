It is separated to the north from the Black Hills range by a canyon and road. The north side of the canyon is the southern border of the adjacent Mount Nutt Wilderness, thus comprising a two-sectioned wilderness region.\nThe mesa is about  long, north – south and about  higher than the surrounding valleys to the east, south and west. Interstate 40 in Arizona runs along the valleys to the east and south of the Black Mesa, connecting Needles, California to Kingman. Yucca, Arizona lies in the Sacramento Valley just east of the mesa.\nSee also\n* Black Mesa, Arizona\nReferences"
