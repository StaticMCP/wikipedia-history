This time, the army was not a raiding party like that of Mahmud Ghazni who came with intention of raiding, looting and retreating with the loot to Afghanistan . They were backed by the imperial army and came here with the intention of permanent conquest in India.\nKing Anandpal Shahi tried to check this Gazni advance towards heartland of India . He was helped by King of Sialkot , Rai Arjun. But, this alliance was overwhelmed by superiority of numbers of Turkic army. After defeating Anandpal Shahi and Rai Arjun, Masud advanced towards Malwa and Gujarat . King Mahipal Tomara tried to check their advance here but was defeated too.\nAfter victories across North Indian plains, Masud Ghazni settled at Bahraich near Lucknow . He stayed here up to mid 1033. Meanwhile, 17 Kings of North India forged an alliance. This is the biggest confederation that have ever existed in India . They were Rai Raib, Rai Saib, Rai Arjun, Rai Bheekhan, Rai Kanak, Rai Kalyan, Rai Makaru, Rai Savaru, Rai Aran, Rai Birbal, Rai Jaypal, Rai Shreepal, Rai Harpal, Rai Hakru, Rai Prabhu, Rai Deo Narayan and Rai Narsinha. Raja Bhoj of Malwa also played an important role in this battle. The head of this confederation was Raja Sukhdev. It would be interesting to know how the alliance was forged and how was the game of chess played before the final showdown on 14th June.\nIn June 1033, as per Hindu traditions, Masud Ghazni was intimated by Rajput confederation that the land belonged to Rajputs and Hindus and Masud should evacuate these lands. Masud replied that all land belongs to Khuda and hence he would not retreat.\nOn 13th June, Morning, Rajput army of about 120,000 descended on Ghazni camp of Bahraich. Masud's army was completely besieged and encircled. The battle continued for hours. In the end, each and every man in Masood's camp was killed. No POW's were taken, no mercy was shown on the Turkic army. The location of this battle to be precise was near Chittaura Jheel, a lake about 8 KM away from modern Bahraich on Bahraich-Gond Road . The battle ended on 14th June with Victory of Raja Sukhdev and his Rajput alliance.On the evening of 14 June 1033 AD,Sunday Salar Masud was beheaded by Raja Sukhdev. The battle ended with Victory of Raja Sukhdev and his Rajput alliance.\nThe invasion was completely crushed and such resounding was this victory that none of the king from Northwest dared to invade India for 160 years."
