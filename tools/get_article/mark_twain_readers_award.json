It is now one of four Missouri Association of School Librarians (MASL) Readers Awards and is associated with school grades 4 to 6; the other MASL Readers Awards were inaugurated from 1995 to 2009 and are associated with grades K–3, 6–8, 9–12 and nonfiction.

Armstrong, was the inaugural winner of the Mark Twain Award in 1972.\nPeg Kehret has won the Mark Twain Award four times, once in 1999 for Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio, a memoir of her childhood, and three times in six years from 2007 to 2012 for novels.\nNomination guidelines\n* Books should interest children in grades four through six.\n* Books should be an original work written by an author living in the United States.\n* Books should be of literary value which may enrich children's personal lives.\n* Books should be published two years prior to nomination on a master list of twelve nominees.\nVoting process\nThough the list of nominated books is designated for grades four through six, any student can vote for the winner so long as they satisfy the following criteria:\n* Book must have been read by voter.\n* Voter must have read at least four books from the list of nominees.\n* Voter can only vote once.\nSchools design their own ballots.
