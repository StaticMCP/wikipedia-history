It is the follow-up to the 2011 album ''Organ Music Not Vibraphone Like I'd Hoped'' and was released on April 17, 2012. The album is a result of the collaboration of Krug with the Finnish rock band Siinai. Krug met the band Joensuu 1685 while on tour with another of his bands, Wolf Parade, in 2009. Joensuu 1685 later became Siinai, and when they indicated to Krug that they were in need of a vocalist the project that would later become Heartbreaking Bravery was born.\nThe album was released on April 17, 2012 on vinyl, CD and for digital distribution, although it was made available for download early if pre-ordered through Jagjaguwar's website on March 26, 2012.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Spencer Krug and Siinai.\n# \"Heartbreaking Bravery\" - 5:38\n# \"Yesterday's Fire\" - 5:05\n# \"Shitty City\" - 3:59\n# \"Quickfire, I Tried\" - 5:51\n# \"I'm Not the Phoenix Yet\" - 2:44\n# \"10,000 Scorpions\" - 2:10\n# \"Faraway Lightning\" - 4:45\n# \"Headed For the Door\" - 7:38\n# \"Teary Eyes and Bloody Lips\" - 2:45\n# \"Lay Your Cheek On Down\" - 5:37\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://jagjaguwar.com/artist.php?name=moonface Moonface Page] at Jagjaguwar\n* [http://moonface.ca/ Official Moonface Page]"
