It was founded in 1987.\nThe museum is geared to children from 6 months to 10 years of age with different areas of the museum tailored to a specific age group.  Children have the options of exploring the 6 different sections of the museum: Art Studios, Bay Hall, Discovery Hall, Lookout Cove, Tot Spot, and Fab Lab.\nIn the fall of 2021, the museum completed a $20M USD renovation that included five new exhibits including an interconnected set of tree houses shaped like the nuts of the trees they inhabit.\nReferences"
