This is the first blues album by Springfield who grew up playing this music in Australia.\nReception\nEditors at AllMusic rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that this album lyrically continues the serious themes that Springfield has previously explored while working in new genres of blues and folk. Writing for Louder Sound, Phoebe Flys called the lyrics on The Snake King \"a mixed bag, flitting between tongue-in-cheek and extremely poignant\" and praises his guitar playing.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*[https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2018/03/26/596994071/rick-springfield-on-world-cafe Set] on World Cafe"
