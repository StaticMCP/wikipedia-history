Two of these games were friendlies in 1919 against HK Foster's XI, while the other – Nesfield's only County Championship outing – came the following year. His highest score of 16 was made in his debut innings.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://somersetcricketmuseum.co.uk/bridgetown-cricket-club-club-history/ Bridgetown Cricket Club – Club History]"
