Directed by Alf Kjellin, the episode was written by Robert Culp, who played one of the main characters of the series, Kelly Robinson; in this episode, he also played the guest character, Chuang Tzu.\nPlot\nKelly Robinson and Alexander Scott are assigned to rescue Katherine Faulkner, the daughter of a highly influential British arms producer, who has been kidnapped by a Chinese warlord in Burma; however, when they arrive, they find that not only was the kidnap a hoax, but Katherine is the War Lord's lover.\nOrigins\nRobert Culp wrote “The Warlord” with Julie Christie in mind, who had become a big star after appearing in \"Darling,\" The script sat idle for a long time, until Leon Chooluk said they could make it work within budget if they filmed the episode on location in Spain. They never approached Christie for the part, instead casting Jean Marsh for the role of Katherine Faulkner. Culp wasn't initially excited about Jean Marsh, but realized later she was excellent for the part.\nMain cast\n* Robert Culp as Kelly Robinson / Chuang Tzu\n* Bill Cosby as Alexander Scott\n* Jean Marsh as Katherine Faulkner\n* Cecil Parker as Sir Guy Faulkner\n* Patrick Barr as The General\n* Carl Rapp as Weaver\n* Bill Curran as Robert Carter\nSee also\n*I Spy\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
