The listed area is a 1/2 acre portion of the  Heritage Park.  It is located at the northern edge of downtown Fort Worth and northwest of the Tarrant County Courthouse.  The park lies at the original location where in the Spring of 1849, Major Ripley Arnold of the United States Army established a military post that became Fort Worth.  The park opened on April 18, 1980.\nAccording to the National Park Service:\nHeritage Park Plaza is a public park in downtown Fort Worth, Texas designed by the internationally acclaimed architect Lawrence Halprin (1916-2009). The plaza design incorporates a set of interconnecting rooms constructed of concrete and activated throughout by flowing water walls, channels, and pools. Halprin later used this technique for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, DC. This park represents one of Halprin's most significant projects and embodies his mature theories and philosophy of landscape design.\nThe property was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 2010. The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of May 21, 2010.\nThe park has been closed because of safety concerns.  The 2014 City of Fort Worth bond vote approved $1.5 million for repairs.  Additional private funding has been secured. The plaza is expected to reopen in 2016.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Tarrant County, Texas\nReferences\nExternal links"
