Voters chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMichigan voted for the Republican candidate, John C. Frémont, over Democratic candidate, James Buchanan. Frémont won Michigan by a margin of 15.63%.\nWith 57.15% of the popular vote, Michigan proved to be Fremont's fifth strongest in the 1856 election after Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island.\nThis marked the first of eighteen Republican victories in Michigan over the next nineteen presidential election cycles. Michigan would not vote for a Democratic candidate again until Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, and it would not vote for a different candidate until Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid in 1912. Michigan would also not send any Democratic electors to the Electoral College until Grover Cleveland won five of the state's 14 electoral votes in 1892. This is one of only four occasions since the founding of the Republican Party that Michigan and Pennsylvania have voted for different presidential candidates.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Michigan\nNotes\nReferences"
