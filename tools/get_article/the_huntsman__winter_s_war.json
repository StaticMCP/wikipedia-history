Billed as both a prequel and sequel to Snow White & the Huntsman (2012), it marks the directorial debut of Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. It takes place before and after the events of the first film. The screenplay was written by Craig Mazin and Evan Spiliotopoulos and is based on characters created by Evan Daugherty. Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Nick Frost and Sam Claflin reprised their roles from the first film, with Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain and Rob Brydon joining.\n''The Huntsman: Winter's War'' premiered in Hamburg in March 2016, and was released in the United States on April 22, 2016, by Universal Pictures to negative reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the visuals and cast but many felt the film was unnecessary. It grossed $165 million worldwide against a $115 million production budget, becoming  a box office bomb.\nPlot\nAfter Queen Ravenna's Magic Mirror reveals that her sister, Princess Freya, is pregnant by her lover Andrew, tragedy strikes when Andrew kills their newborn daughter. In grief and rage, Freya's latent cryokinetic powers emerge, and she kills Andrew before fleeing to the northern mountains. There, she becomes the Snow Queen, ruling with fear and raising kidnapped children as an army of Huntsmen, forbidding them from ever falling in love.\nAmong them, Eric and Sara defy her rules and fall in love, planning to escape together. However, Freya discovers them and tricks them with illusions—making Sara believe Eric abandoned her and Eric believe Sara was killed.\nYears later, after Ravenna's defeat, Queen Snow White falls ill due to the Mirror's dark magic. Fearing its power, she orders it taken to Sanctuary, but it is lost en route. Eric, joined by dwarves Nion and Gryff, sets out to recover it. Along the way, he is reunited with Sara, who survived but resents him for supposedly leaving her. They eventually uncover Freya's deception and rekindle their bond.\nThe group retrieves the Mirror from goblins but is ambushed by Freya. Sara appears to betray Eric, but her attack only fakes his death. Freya takes the Mirror and unknowingly resurrects Ravenna, whose spirit had fused with it. The two sisters plot to rule together, but Freya soon learns Ravenna orchestrated her daughter's death. Enraged, she turns against Ravenna but is mortally wounded. With her last strength, she helps Eric destroy the Mirror, killing Ravenna once and for all.\nAs Freya dies, she sees a vision of her daughter and finds peace. With her rule broken, her Huntsmen are freed, and Eric and Sara finally have a future together. In a post-credits scene, Snow White is seen on her balcony as a golden crow lands beside her.\nCast\n* Chris Hemsworth as Eric: An exceptional warrior and Freya's former Huntsman.\n** Conrad Khan as Young Eric\n* Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna: Snow White's evil stepmother.\n* Emily Blunt as Queen Freya: Ravenna's younger sister.\n* Jessica Chastain as Sara: Eric's wife who was thought to be dead by and through Freya's deceiving powers.\n** Niamh Walter as Young Sara\n* Nick Frost as Nion: a Dwarf who previously helped Eric and Snow White defeat Ravenna's army.\n* Sam Claflin as King William: the King of Tabor and Snow White's husband who helped her and Eric defeat Ravenna's army.\n* Rob Brydon as Gryff: A debt-collecting Dwarf who is Nion's older half-brother.\n* Sheridan Smith as Bromwyn: A feisty and greedy Dwarf who becomes allies with Nion and Gryff.\n* Alexandra Roach as Doreena: A female Dwarf and Nion's love interest.\n* Sope Dirisu as Tull: A fellow warrior raised by Freya.\n* Sophie Cookson as Pippa: A fellow warrior raised by Freya.\n** Amelia Crouch as Young Pippa\n* Sam Hazeldine as Liefr: A fellow warrior raised by Freya.\n* Colin Morgan as Andrew: Freya's lover.\n* Robert Portal as the unnamed King and husband of Ravenna and the ruler of an unnamed Kingdom.\n* Fred Tatasciore as Mirror Man : The physical form of the Magic Mirror.\n* Madeleine Worrall as Eric's Mother\n* Liam Neeson as Narrator\n* Kristen Stewart as Snow White, the Queen of Tabor, William's wife and Ravenna's stepdaughter (uncredited; archive footage)\n* Ruby and Scarlett Kick as Freya's Baby Daughter (uncredited)\nProduction\nDevelopment\nA sequel to Snow White & the Huntsman was initially planned with director Rupert Sanders in talks to return.
