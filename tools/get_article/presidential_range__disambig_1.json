It contains the highest peaks of the Whites, the most notable of which are named for American presidents, followed by prominent public figures of the 18th and 19th centuries. The Presidential Range is notorious for having some of the worst weather on Earth, mainly because of the unpredictability of high wind speeds and whiteout conditions on the higher summits. Because of the poor weather conditions, the Presidential Range is often used for mountaineering training for those who go on to climb some of the world's highest mountains, including K2 and Everest.\nMount Washington, long home of the highest winds recorded on the surface of the Earth at , is the tallest at , followed by neighboring peaks Mount Adams at  and Mount Jefferson at . The range is almost entirely in Coos County.\nNotable summits\nThe highest mountains in the Presidential Range are named principally for U.S. presidents, with the tallest mountain (Mount Washington) named for the first president and the second tallest (Mount Adams) for the second president.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Summit !!

Several of these peaks, drained on their west faces by the Dry River, are less accessible than the main and most-visited ridge of the range.\nSubsidiary peaks of Mount Washington:\n* Ball Crag (6,106&nbsp;ft)\n* Nelson Crag (5,620&nbsp;ft)\n* Boott Spur (5,500&nbsp;ft)\nNorth from Mount Washington:\n* Mount Bowman (3,449&nbsp;ft) (spur of Mount Jefferson)\nSouth from Mount Washington:\n* Engine Hill (3,100&nbsp;ft)\n* Maple Mountain (2,601&nbsp;ft)\n* Iron Mountain (2,726&nbsp;ft)\n* Montalban Ridge:\n** Mount Isolation (4,004&nbsp;ft)*\n** Mount Davis (3,819&nbsp;ft)\n** Stairs Mountain (3,463&nbsp;ft)\n** Mount Resolution (3,415&nbsp;ft)\n* Bemis Ridge:\n** Mount Crawford (3,119&nbsp;ft)\n** Mount Hope (2,505&nbsp;ft)\n* Mount Parker (3,004&nbsp;ft)\n* Mount Langdon (2,390&nbsp;ft)\n* Mount Pickering (1,945&nbsp;ft) (family name of first president of Appalachian Mountain Club)\n* Mount Stanton (1,716&nbsp;ft)\nThe summits marked with an asterisk (*) are included on the peak-bagging list of 4,000-foot and higher mountains in New Hampshire; the others are excluded, in some cases because of lesser height and in others because of more technical criteria.\nWatersheds\nThe Presidentials separate drainage via the Saco and Androscoggin rivers into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of Maine, from drainage into the Israel and Ammonoosuc rivers, thence into the Connecticut River, and thence into Long Island Sound.\nPresidential Traverse\nThe so-called Presidential Traverse is a hike that traverses each major summit along the  of the Presidential ridge. The traverse encompasses over  in elevation gain. It can be done in a single day in summer, but during winter it is generally a two- to four-day venture. The traverse is considered strenuous.\nHazards\nSign warning of weather.\nThe range is notorious for its unpredictable and inclement weather, with some of the deadliest mountains in the continental United States. Due to its unique location relative to other geographic features, it holds the world record for highest recorded surface wind speed not within a tropical cyclone. Fatalities in this area are dominated by those that occur on Mount Washington, the highest peak in the range.  The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department conducts an average of 200 rescues a year for hikers in need of assistance.\nSee also\n* List of people who died on the Presidential Range\n* List of subranges of the Appalachian Mountains\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://trailsnh.com/Presidential_Range.php TrailsNH.com - Current trail conditions for the Presidential Range, compiled daily]"
