In the , New Farm had a population of 12,197 people.\nGeography\nThe suburb of New Farm (peninsula in upper part of image) including New Farm Park is located on the Brisbane River.\nThe suburb is located 2 kilometres east of the Brisbane CBD on a large bend of the Brisbane River. New Farm is partly surrounded by the Brisbane River, with land access from the north-west through Fortitude Valley and from the north through Newstead. Merthyr is a neighbourhood within New Farm; until 1975 it was a separate suburb.leftThe suburb has an eclectic mix of 19th century colonial constructions; 20th century traditional Queenslander and Federation homes; and modern architectural hybrids. New Farm is home to Brisbane's most impressive collection of art deco buildings. As the population density increases and apartment, unit and duplex housing continue to exceed its share beyond 70% of the local dwelling mix, detached housing is increasing in demand and price.\nAt the south-eastern end of the peninsula is the historic New Farm Park. Brunswick Street is the main street running northwest–southeast up the centre of the peninsula. To the south of Brunswick Street the suburb is characterised by large ornate Queenslander-style houses, shady streets lined with large trees and tall apartment buildings, predominantly along the river. More modest Queenslander-style houses dominate the north of Brunswick Street, where there are fewer large trees and apartments.\nThe suburb has one main commercial area close to New Farm Park, called 'Merthyr Village'. A wide variety of businesses also operate along Brunswick Street and in adjacent streets. The former electric tramway power station, located at the eastern corner of New Farm Park, has been converted into a community arts and performance space called 'The Powerhouse'. New Farm is known as Brisbane's \"Little Italy\" as many immigrants from Italian descent first settled in the suburb. The Brisbane City Council operates a public library at 135 Sydney Street. The library opened in 1975 and offers publicly accessible Wi-Fi.\nHistory\nThough one of Brisbane's oldest suburbs, the peninsula of New Farm was once called Binkinba (place of the land tortoises) by the indigenous Turrbal tribe of Brisbane.\nThe suburb derives its name from the fact that the peninsula was used as a farming area in the early years of Brisbane's history. Commandant Patrick Logan established a new farm in the area in 1827 as part of the Moreton Bay penal colony. The area was also a working site of convicts (lime kilns dating back to 1870 are still evident on the river banks).\nPolitician and judge Samuel Griffith built his house 'Merthyr' in the suburb in 1870.\nFrom 1885 to 1897, New Farm's transport needs were met by horse-drawn trams, which operated along Brunswick Street, as far as Barker Street. In 1897, the horse trams were replaced with electric trams and the line was extended, with trams ultimately running as far as Macquarie Street and down to the river at New Farm Park. The electric trams ceased operation on 13 April 1969. Since then the suburb has been served by diesel buses.\nNew Farm State School was opened on 21 January 1901.\nOn 29 November 1919, 24 river frontage subdivided allotments between Merthyr Road and Sydney Street were advertised to be auctioned by Cameron Bros Auctioneers.  A map advertising the auction indicated that the home of Sir Samuel Griffith was adjacent to the advertised lots.\nOn 24 April 1920, 5 allotments on Welsby Street were advertised to be auctioned on 27 April 1920 at 11am by Cameron Bros Auctioneers.  A map advertising the auction indicated that the lots were close to the new tramway.\nOn 6 May 1920, 5 residential sites and 2 cottages were advertised to be auctioned on Monday 10 May 1920 by Cameron Bros Auctioneers.  A map advertising the auction indicated that the lots and cottages were located between St Clair House and Heal Street.\nIn 1923, the Catholic Church purchased a house to celebrate mass. The Holy Spirit Church opened on 1 June 1930, enabling the Sisters of Mercy to open the Holy Spirit School on 7 July 1930 in the house. The house was replaced with a purpose-built school building costing £4,000. In September 1937 the new school guilding was blessed and opened by Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig.\nThere was a marine base established in World War II and the suburb was home to many wealthy merchants and lawyers.\nSpastic Centre School opened on 12 February 1951. It was renamed New Farm Special School in 1974. It closed on 16 December 1994.\nNew Farm developed a reputation in the late 1980s for street prostitution and as a drug-addled, low-rent culture depicted in Andrew McGahan's grunge novel Praise, which is set largely in the suburb.\nSince then, and like many Brisbane suburbs, New Farm has experienced much 'gentrification' and 'infill development' throughout the 1990s and the years since 2000. However, New Farm maintains its diversity, being known for its long-established Anglo-Saxon and Italian communities (as depicted in Venero Armanno's novel Firehead), and its many restaurants and cafes.\nOn 23 January 2007, part of the movie ''Fool's Gold, starring Kate Hudson, was shot at New Farm Park. Scenes from the films All My Friends Are Leaving Brisbane (2007) and Jucy'' (2011) have also been shot there.\nDemographics\nAt the , New Farm recorded a population of 11,330. This meant New Farm had the highest population density in Greater Brisbane at the time with approximately 5,861.7 people per square kilometre.\nIn the , New Farm had a population of 12,542 people.\nIn the , New Farm had a population of 12,197 people. With 5% of household couples identifying as same-sex, New Farm is home to one of Queensland's largest LGBT communities.\nHeritage listings\nNew Farm has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 41 Abbott Street: Residence, Abbott Street\n* 41 Balfour Street: Cairnsville\n* 388 Bowen Terrace (): Feniton\n* 701 Brunswick Street: Village Twin Cinemas\n* 790 Brunswick Street: [https://heritage.brisbane.qld.gov.au/heritage-places/1127 Wynberg]\n* Cnr James & Heal Streets: New Farm State School\n* 12 Julius Street: Langshaw Marble Lime Works\n* 15 Julius Street: Julius Street Flats\n* Lamington Street: former CSR Refinery\n* 71–73 Moray Street: Bertholme\n* 186 Moray Street: Glenugie\n* 209 Moray Street: Santa Barbara\n*172 Oxlade Drive: Glenfalloch Apartments\n* 1 Riverview Court: [https://heritage.brisbane.qld.gov.au/heritage-places/2123 The Moorings]\n* 137 Sydney Street: New Farm Park\n* 101 Welsby Street: Amity\nEducation\nNew Farm State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at corner of James & Heal Streets ().
