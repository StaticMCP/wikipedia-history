During this period, the Arkansas Air National Guard became a separate component of the Arkansas National Guard.   The Arkansas Army National Guard provided Field Artillery and Medical units in support of combat operations in Korea.\nReorganization following World War II\nWith the end of hostilities, the Arkansas National Guard was directed by the War Department to begin re-organization with an expected strength approximately double the size of the pre-war organization.  The 39th Infantry Division was reconstituted on 30 September 1946. It was composed of units Arkansas and Louisiana, with its headquarters stationed at Jackson Barracks in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Arkansas portion headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

During the Chinese Spring Drive the battalion fell back to Seoul and was moved to IX Corps. Battery A continued with X Corps and was attached to the 1st Marine Division.

The battalion was awarded battle streamers for the following campaigns:\n*First U.N. Counteroffensive\n*CCF Spring Offensive\n*UN Spring Offensive\n*UN Summer – Fall Offensive\n*Second Korean winter\n*Korea, Summer – Fall 1952\n*Third Korean Winter\n*Korea, Summer 1953.\nThe 217th Medical Company was mobilized August 2, 1950, and underwent training at Fort Benning, Georgia. The Company departed Fort Lawton, Washington, for January 15, 1951, and arrived in Yokohama, Japan on February 2, 1951. The unit then moved to Kyoto, Japan for training until May 3, 1951. The unit arrived in Pusan, Korea May 4, 1951. The 217th conducted its basic mission of air evacuation of patients to Japan in an area from Pusan north to Seoul. Headquarters Platoon and 1st Platoon were stationed at the K-9 Airbase near Pusan. 2nd Platoon was stationed near Pusan, the 3rd Platoon was stationed near Uljomgby and 4th Platoon was stationed near Chucuhon and Yomdgumgpo and Tamjon.

This list may be shorter than the list contained in various unit histories because those lists may contain Soldiers who were not Arkansas National Guardsmen prior to mobilization but joined the unit following mobilization.  Many Soldiers who were drafted were later assigned to mobilized Guard units.\n*Corporal Donald Osbourn\n*Captain Paul Blew\n*Private First Class  Fred Rose, Jr.\n*Private First Class Jarrell Graham\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*[http://www.arngmuseum.com/ The Arkansas National Guard Museum]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120925125808/http://www.history.army.mil/ARNG/NG-AR.htm Bibliography of Arkansas Army National Guard History] compiled by the United States Army Center of Military History"
