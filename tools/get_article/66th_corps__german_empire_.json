It was formed on 9 May 1917 and was still in existence at the end of the war.\nChronicle\nThe 66th Corps (z.b.V.) was formed on 9 May 1917.  It was formerly known as Gruppe \"Nowogrodek\", named for the city of Nowogrodek. (Now known as Navahrudak.)\nWith the onset of trench warfare, the German Army recognised that it was no longer possible to maintain the traditional Corps unit, that is, one made up of two divisions.  Whereas at some times (and in some places) a Corps of two divisions was sufficient, at other times 5 or 6 divisions were necessary.  Therefore, under the Hindenburg regime (from summer 1916), new Corps headquarters were created without organic divisions.  These new Corps were designated\nGeneral Commands for Special Use ().\nBy the end of the war, the Corps was serving on the Western Front as part of 19th Army, Heeresgruppe Herzog Albrecht von Württemberg with the following composition:\n* 2nd Bavarian Landwehr Division\n* 19th Ersatz Division\n* 17th Reserve Division\nCommanders\nThe 66th Corps had the following commanders during its existence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
