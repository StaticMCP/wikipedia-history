His pop art style paintings gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s through the sale of posters and prints.\nEarly career\nMozkowitz's first success in mass-produced prints was \"American Rabbit\". Later successes included \"Penguins...the Corporation\", \"The White Brothers\", \"Chocolate Mousse\", \"Patchwork Cow\", and \"Chicken Soup\". His characters and artistic style became especially popular in Japan in the early 1980s. Moskowitz published several children's books of his own in 1982. By 1986, several of the characters in Moskowitz's paintings were used in the movie The Adventures of the American Rabbit. His work remained strongly popular in Japan and formed the basis of logos and commercial illustrations for several Japanese companies (including AT&T Japan, Fuji, Mitsubishi & Panasonic), children's books, and animated movies in that country.\nFuji TV used one of Moskowitz's paintings, which depicts the planet Earth as a fish, as the Naruhodo! The World logo during the series broadcast run. Parasa & Dinky Dinos became a Japanese franchise including a coloring cartridge for the Konami Picno; at least one animated short; and Parasa (a yellow parasaurolophus) was instated as the mascot of newly renamed Sakura Bank in 1992, appearing on bank cards, pass books, and other materials.\nMoskowitz registered several dozen paintings under United States' copyright in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\nDeath\nBy mid-May, 2017, Moskowitz had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and was in hospice care. A YouCaring (now part of GoFundMe) fundraiser raised over $10,000 to bring his family together, given his condition. Moskowitz's death came shortly after, on May 23, 2017.\nArtistic works\nPaintings (1970s)\n* American Rabbit\n* Peeky-Turcock\n* The White Brothers\n* Penguins...the Corporation\n* Loose Appaloosas\n* Star Rabbit\n* Patchwork Cow\n* Giant Pig/Pig With House\nBibliography\nAs author\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Publisher\n!ISBN\n!Pages\n!Note\n|-\n|1982\n|A Patchwork Fish Tale\n|Julian Messner\n|978-0671453275\n|28\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|\n|Julian Messner\n|978-0671458850\n|30\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|Too-Loose the Chocolate Moose\n|Julian Messner\n|978-0671458867\n|28\n|\n|-\n|1984\n|''Fred & Freddy's Lovely Cooking (Desserts)\n|AIPEC\n|978-4870470101\n|63\n|Japanese\n|-\n|1984\n|Fred & Freddy's Lovely Cooking (American Snacks)\n|AIPEC\n|978-4870470118\n|63\n|Japanese\n|-\n|1984\n|Fred & Freddy's Lovely Cooking (Dinners)\n|AIPEC\n|978-4870470156\n|63\n|Japanese\n|-\n|1984\n|Fred & Freddy's Lovely Cooking (Lunches)\n|AIPEC\n|978-4870470163\n|63\n|Japanese\n|-\n|1990\n|Moskowitz's World\n|Fusosha Publishing\n|978-4594006143\n|\n|Japanese\n|-\n|1993\n|Yellow Dinosaur Boy: Adventure of Parasa and Friends\n|Fusosha Publishing\n|978-4594011420\n|\n|Japanese\n|-\n|1996\n|Yellow Dinosaur Boy 2: Save Our Dinosaur Planet\n|Fusosha Publishing\n|978-4594019679\n|\n|Japanese\n|-\n|2012\n|Too-Loose the Chocolate Moose, 30th Anniversary Edition\n|\n|978-0985146719\n|32\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Vincent van Goat: The Real Story\n|Stewart Moskowitz Media\n|978-0985146726\n|34\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|A Patchwork Fish Tale: 30th Anniversary Edition\n|Stewart Moskowitz Media\n|\n|34\n|\n|}\nAs illustrator\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title (author)\n!Publisher\n!ISBN\n!Pages\n!Note\n|-\n|1994\n|\n|Fusosha Publishing\n|978-4594015817\n|\n|Japanese\n|-\n|1997\n|The Flying Coconut (unknown)\n|\n|\n|\n|Japanese\n|-\n|2015\n|Barney Meets BeeBee (Noni Morton)\n|Jangus Publishing Group\n|978-0996463706\n|23\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Bear's Pond'' (Noni Morton)\n|\n|\n|23\n|\n|}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Olson C, Gerhardt LN.
