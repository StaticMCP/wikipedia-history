It is known by a variety of titles, including \"I Wouldn't Mind Dying (If Dying Was All)\" and \"A Mother's Last Word to Her Daughter'''\". It was recorded seven times before 1930, using the preceding titles.\nIt has been most often recorded in gospel or gospel blues style, but also in other styles such as country.\nDescription\nThe song consists of several four-line verses (quatrains) and a repeated refrain. The words both of verses and of refrain often differ from one artist to another. A standard feature is that the refrain consists of four lines, the first three of which are identical. Common variants of those three lines include \"Bye and bye we're (or, I'm) going to see the King\" and \"Holy, holy, holy is His name\". The fourth line almost always begins \"(I) wouldn't (or, don't) mind dying\". It concludes in various ways in different versions, for example \"If dying was all\", or \"But I gotta go by myself\", or \"Because I'm a child of God\".\n\"The King\" is a title of the Christian God.  Many versions include a verse which refers to the vision of the chariot in the Book of Ezekiel, Chapter 1.  A line found in many versions, \"He said he saw him coming with his dyed garments on\", alludes to the Book of Isaiah at 63:1:\n| recorded = Dallas, Texas, December 2, 1929\n| genre    = Gospel blues\n| length   =\n| label    = Columbia\n| writer   = Washington Phillips\n| producer = Frank B. Walker\n}}\nTitles like \"Bye and Bye We're Going to See the King\" and \"I Wouldn't Mind Dying (If Dying Was All)\" are taken from the refrain. The title of the 1929 version by Washington Phillips, \"A Mother's Last Word to Her Daughter\", whose verses differ markedly from other versions, was presumably chosen to indicate that he intended it as a companion song to his \"Mother's Last Word to Her Son\" of 1927. Blind Mamie Forehand's 1927 performance of \"I Wouldn't Mind Dying If Dying Was All\" has been reissued on various Washington Phillips compilations, so Phillips is often confused to be the performer. YouTube has multiple videos doing just this, but Phillips never recorded this song, only his adaptation, \"A Mother's Last Word to Her Daughter\".\nRecordings\n* 1926Arizona Dranes, \"Bye and Bye We're Going to See the King\"  10\" 78rpm single Okeh 8438-B\n* 1927Blind Mamie Forehand, \"Wouldn't Mind Dying If Dying Was All\"  10\" 78rpm single Victor 20574-A\n* 1927Norfolk Jubilee Quartet, \"I Wouldn't Mind Dying If Dying Was All\"  10\" 78rpm single Paramount 12630-B\n* 1928Golden Leaf Quartet, \"I Wouldn't Mind Dying\"  10\" 78rpm single Brunswick 7050\n* 1928Rev.
