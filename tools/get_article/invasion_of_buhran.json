A report had arrived to the Muslims that a formidable force of the Banu Sulaym from Buhran were advancing on Madinah. Muhammad, took 300 men, to Hijaz reaching to Buhran, where the Banu Sulaym fled in panic.\nThroughout the expedition, they did not meet any enemies, and no fighting took place. The expedition is regarded as a \"patrolling invasion\", according to Muslim scholar Saifur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri.\nThis event is mentioned in Ibn Hisham's biography of Muhammad and modern Islamic sources such as Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum by Saifur Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri.\nSee also\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nNotes"
