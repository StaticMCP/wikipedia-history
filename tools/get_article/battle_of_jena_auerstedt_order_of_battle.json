As the emperor ordered a general attack, a guardsman took off his bearskin hat and shouted \"Forward\". Napoleon rebuked the soldier, \"Only a beardless youth would presume to judge in advance what I should do.\"]]\nThe order of battle at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt is listed below. The order of battle includes units from the First French Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia that fought each other in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October 1806. The order of battle may be useful to trace the battles of Schleiz and Saalfeld, which occurred before Jena-Auerstedt, as well as battles and capitulations that happened after 14 October, such as Erfurt, Halle, Prenzlau, Pasewalk, Stettin, Waren-Nossentin, and Lübeck.\nFrench Grande Armée\nEmperor Napoleon I\n* Chief of Staff: Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier\nReserve Artillery\nGeneral of
