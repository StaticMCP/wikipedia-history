This fulfilled the original campus design of the university's first architect, William Augustus Edwards, which called for a Gothic bell tower as a focal point for the entire campus. The design carries forward the spirit and proportions of Canterbury Cathedral's central Bell Harry Tower, a Norman structure rebuilt in the 14th century to a design by John Wastell (best known as the architect of King's College Chapel in Cambridge). However, at the time of the Century Tower's completion in 1956 there was no money to buy bells for a carillon. An electronic bell system given by J.E. Davis and A.D. Davis, two of the Davis Brothers who controlled Winn-Dixie, was used until it finally broke down in 1975. In 1976, $200,000 from accumulated student fees was used to buy the initial set of 49 bells. A Dutch bellfoundry, Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry  designed, fabricated and installed the full carillon.  In May 1979 the carillon was dedicated in two recitals by Milford Myhre, carillonneur of the Bok Singing Tower, Lake Wales FL, who had served as consultant for the instrument.\nIn 2002 a major gift from the estate of Larry Allen Webb of St. Augustine, Florida, (a distant relative of President Dwight D. Eisenhower) made possible the addition of twelve trebles for a total of 61 bells, with complete revision of the carillon playing action and provision of an identical studio practice clavier in the adjacent University Auditorium, including sound samples from ten major carillons throughout the world.  Thus the Century Tower Carillon of sixty-one bells was completed in its present form at the 50th anniversary of the tower itself. It was dedicated on September 11, 2003, with a recital by University Carillonneur emeritus Willis Bodine.\nIn 2008 the Century Tower became a contributing property in the University of Florida Campus Historic District which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 20, 1989.\nPerhaps because Century Tower was built soon after the university became co-ed, an old school joke states that every time a virgin graduates from UF, a brick falls off the tower.\nAbout the Century Tower Carillon\n* It has 61 bells and a range span of 5 octaves.\n* The entire carillon weighs .\n* The smallest bell in the Century Tower Carillon plays a high C, weighs  and has a diameter of about .\n* The largest bell, called the bourdon, plays a low A-sharp. It is  tall, weighs about  and is  in diameter.\n* The carillon chimes each quarter of the hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The pentatonic clock strike melody that is played, \"Florida Chimes\", is unique to this carillon and was written by Dr. Budd Udell, former Chair of the Department of Music (1977–85) at the University of Florida.\n* Students at the university can take carillon lessons, and regularly climb 194 steps in Century Tower to play in one of the two daily performances.\n* The carillon is played using 61 keys (or “batons”) for the hands and 25 pedals for the feet. The musician sits in a small room just below the bell chamber.\n* There are fewer than 200 carillons in North America and only four in Florida.\nSee also\n*Buildings at the University of Florida\n*List of carillons in the United States\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/ufarch/century.htm Picture of the Century Tower]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512065704/http://www.questions.ufl.edu/general/facts/139/ General info about the tower]\n*[http://www.alligator.org/articles/2009/01/16/news/campus/090116_tower.txt Alligator article about Century Tower]"
