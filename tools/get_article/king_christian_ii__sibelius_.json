The original play deals with the love of King Christian II, ruler of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, for a Dutch girl, Dyvecke, a commoner. Sibelius composed in 1898 seven movements. He conducted the first performance of the first four parts the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki on 24 February 1898. In the following summer, he composed three more movements, Nocturne, Serenade and Ballad. The Nocturne was an interlude between the first act and the second. The position of the serenade changed. The ballad is a dramatic piece about the Stockholm Bloodbath (1520). This movement shows already traits of the later First Symphony. The stage music consists of the following numbers:\n# Elegia\n# Musette\n# Menuetto\n# Sången om korsspindeln\n# Nocturne\n# Serenade\n# Ballade.\nSibelius derived from the incidental music a suite of five movements.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
