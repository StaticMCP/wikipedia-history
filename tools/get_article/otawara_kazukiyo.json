His courtesy title was Hida-no-kami, and his Court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, later raised to Upper Fifth Rank.\nBiography\nŌtawara Kazukiyo was the eldest son of Ōtawara Tomikiyo, the 13th daimyō of Ōtawara. He became daimyō in 1862 on his father's death. In 1868, with the start of the Boshin War, he immediate pledged fealty to the new Meiji government and was awarded with reconfirmation in his holdings. In 1869 he was appointed imperial governor of Ōtawara, although the government also demanded 5000 ryō in gold to help pay for the costs of the Boshin War. With the abolition of the han system in July 1871, he retired and relocated to Tokyo, where he attended the Keio Gijuku university.\nWith the establishment of the kazoku peerage system he was awarded with the title of shishaku (viscount) in 1884. In 1899, he was appointed to a seat in the House of Peers, where he served until 1923. He died in 1930.\nSee also\n*Ōtawara Domain\nReferences\n* Koyasu Nobushige (1880).
