Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nThe 1969 North Dakota State Bison football team compiled a perfect 10–0 record and was rated No. 1 by both the AP and UPI. Montana compiled a 10–0 record in the regular season and was ranked No. 2 by both the AP and UPI. North Dakota State and Montana met in the post-season Camellia Bowl with North Dakota State prevailing by a 30–3 score.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB;
