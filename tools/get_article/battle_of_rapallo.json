Later the Neapolitan fleet was forced away by bad weather. On 5 September, Louis d'Orleans landed with 1,000 Swiss mercenary infantry which was later reinforced overland by 2,000 more Swiss mercenaries and a contingent of Genoese-Milanese infantry.\nA skirmish broke out between the Swiss mercenaries and Neapolitan forces, though the terrain did not allow for the Swiss to form up their pike squares. However, the battle was mainly fought between the Genoese-Milanese and Neapolitan infantry. Following concentrated artillery fire from the French fleet, the Neapolitans were routed. The Swiss massacred Neapolitans trying to surrender, although Orsini and Campofregoso were captured in the retreat.\nAfter the battle, the Swiss mercenaries killed the enemy wounded and sacked the town of Rapallo. Though a small battle, it was seen as a significant victory that halted Neapolitan attempts to incite a rebellion in Genoa against the French.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
