      "text": "# MLW WarGames\n\nWarGames was a reoccurring professional wrestling supercard event produced by Major League Wrestling (MLW) named after the WarGames match, which headlined each event.\nBoth events have been held during September. The inaugural event in 2003 was a supercard, while the other was a television taping for MLW Fusion in 2018. The 2018 WarGames match aired on the September 14, 2018 episode of Fusion on beIN Sports.\nThe event was replaced by War Chamber in 2019, after WWE acquired the rights from MLW.\nDates and venues\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!#\n!Event\n!Date\n!City\n!Venue\n!Main event\n|-\n|1||WarGames (2003)||September 19, 2003||rowspan=\"2\"|Fort Lauderdale, Florida||rowspan=\"2\"|War Memorial Auditorium||The Funkin' Army (Bill Alfonso, Sabu, Steve Williams, Terry Funk and The Sandman) vs. The Extreme Horsemen (Barry Windham, CW Anderson, PJ Walker, Simon Diamond and Steve Corino) in a WarGames match\n|-\n|2||WarGames (2018)||September 6, 2018||Barrington Hughes, John Hennigan, Kotto Brazil, Shane Strickland and Tommy Dreamer vs. Abyss, Jimmy Havoc, Sami Callihan and The Death Machines (Leon Scott and Sawyer Fulton) in a WarGames match\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.mlw.com Major League Wrestling official website]"
