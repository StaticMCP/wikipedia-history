After operating two trials on the line to Toowoomba, where it spread the rails and ultimately derailed, Queensland Railways refused to accept them. After four years in storage, they were repatriated to England and converted to . Two were sold to the Central Argentine Railway for use at Montevideo, while the third was sold to the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in Wales and named Victoria.\nReferences"
