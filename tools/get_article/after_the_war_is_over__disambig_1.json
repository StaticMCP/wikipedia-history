Pourmon and Andrew B. Sterling. The song was published by Joe Morris Music Co., and was written for voice and piano.\nThere are four versions of the score published by the Joe Morris Music Co. and two known issues from Broad & Market Music Company.\nThe song is a celebratory song, anticipating that American soldiers will end the war and return home. The song also celebrates General Pershing, a key American general, and references the Second Battle of the Marne, which resulted in a decisive Allied victory.\nLyrics\nAngels, they are weeping over the foreign wars\nChanged will be the pictures of the foreign lands\nTrains, Ports are sailing from shore to shore\nMaps will change entirely to different hands\nBrave Heroes are falling to arise no more\nKings and Queens may ever rule their fellow man\nBut still, the bugles calling every man to war\nBut pray they'll be united like our own free land\nAfter the war is over and the world's at peace\nMany a heart will be aching after the war has ceased\nMany a heart will be vacant, Many a child will be alone\nBut I hope they'll all be happy in a place called home sweet home\nReferences"
