She completed secondary school in Europe and moved to Dakar in Senegal. She earned a diploma in library science at Cheikh Anta Diop University and worked for several years as a librarian. In 1961, she married the film director Paulin Soumanou Vieyra.\nSeveral of her poems were published in the literary magazine Présence Africaine in 1976. Her first novel, written in 1980, was ''Le Quimboiseur l'avait dit (the 1983 English translation published by Longman was entitled As The Sorcerer Said), which is set in the Caribbean. Her second novel Juletane, published in 1982, is the story of a Caribbean woman who married a Senegalese man who, she discovers, is already married. This was followed by a collection of stories, Femmes échouées (Fallen women), in 1988.\nWarner-Vieyra died aged 78 on 29 December 2017 in Tours, Indre-et-Loire, France.\nBibliography\n* Le Quimboiseur l’avait dit…, Paris/Dakar: Présence Africaine, 1980.
