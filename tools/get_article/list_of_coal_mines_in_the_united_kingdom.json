      "text": "# List of coal mines in the United Kingdom\n\nThis is a list of coal mines in the United Kingdom, sorted between those operating in the 21st century and those closed earlier.\nThe last operating deep coal mine in the United Kingdom, Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire, closed in December 2015. After 2015, most continuing coal mines were collieries owned by freeminers, or open pit mines of which there were 26 in 2014. However, since December 2023 -with the closure of Ffos-y-fran- no opencast coal mine operates, and opencast production is zero according to the UK Coal Authority. The largest mine is Aberpergwm, which is a drift mine. Aberpergwm (and other small scale underground mines) produced around 106,000 tonnes in 2024 while opencast production was zero (except for 800 tonnes in January, 2024).\n21st century\nThese coal mines closed in the 21st century or still operate.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
