The Swedish army had problems repairing the bridge due to constant fire from the Norwegian side of the river. It was then a small Swedish force of 75 men, consisting of jägers from the Bohuslän and Life Grenadier Regiments, passed over the river at a hidden point. Once over they waited for reinforcements but none came; but instead the order of attacking the vastly larger Norwegian force. The Colonel response to the attack order have been famous \"It is unreasonable to attack with only 75 men when you face a whole regiment.\" \"But such an order isn't given to me twice. March!\" During cheers the Swedes rushed up the hill toward the mansion that was occupied with 600 men. The attack was surprising and decisive. As more Swedish troops crossed, the Norwegians quickly left the stand. This was the last battle fought during the Swedish–Norwegian War. The Convention of Moss, providing a cease fire agreement, was signed that same day.\nThe last shots were fired north of the bridge with the Norwegians in retreat.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n*Norway in 1814\n*Union between Sweden and Norway\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_norway1814.html Norwegian-Swedish War of 1814 (The Napoleon Series)]\n*[http://ostfold1814.no/temaer/kampene-ved-kjolberg-bru/ Kampene ved Kjølberg bru (Østfoldmuseene Prosjektleder)]\n*[http://www.eidsvoll1814.no/default.aspx?aid=9078804 The Story of 1814  (Eidsvoll 1814)]"
