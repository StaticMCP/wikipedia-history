On November 17, 2014, BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith reported that Uber senior executive Emil Michael \"outlined the notion of spending 'a million dollars'\" to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists. He said that team could help Uber fight back against the press by looking into \"personal lives, your families\". Michael was particularly focused on journalist Sarah Lacy, who accused Uber of “sexism and misogyny\". Lacy wrote a sharp response critical of Uber's actions. The controversy was picked up by CNBC, Business Insider, and the New York Times Bits blog. Michael Wolff, the journalist who had arranged for and invited Smith to the private dinner where the controversial remarks were made, wrote a lengthy piece about the controversy, stating that Uber executives had believed that the event was off-the-record, but that he (Wolff) had failed to communicate the information to Smith.\n|-\n| October 29 ||International expansion\n|Uber expands its operations in Canada by launching UberX in Montreal.\n|-\n| December 4 || Funding || Uber confirms it has raised $1.2 billion at a $40 billion pre-money valuation in a Series E round.

The move is prompted by the observation that UberPool users, who do see the ride price upfront, are more likely to continue using the service. Price changes triggered by destination changes will be sent to riders in real time. Changes to routes due to traffic or other reasons not under the rider's control will not result in a change to the price charged upfront. The move is not an end to surge pricing but rather a change in the way the surge pricing is communicated to customers. The change, officially announced in late June, had already been rolled out at the time of announcement in several cities, and had received some commentary in May.\n|-\n| June 9 || Product || Uber opens up the Uber RUSH API to developers. The goal of this API is to make it easy for merchants to integrate the use of Uber drivers into their delivery system.

The cars are modified version of the Volvo sports utility vehicle equipped with Uber's technology for self-driving. Cars will have drivers at the wheel, monitoring the vehicle, as required by law. The move is seen by commentators as the first step in Uber's ambitious goal of replacing its entire fleet with autonomous vehicles.\n|-\n|September 16\n|Product\n|Uber begins mapping UK streets in an effort to identify the best pick-up and drop-off points from its own images.\n|-\n|October 28\n|Legal\n|Uber loses the case of Aslam v Uber BV on workers' rights.

The app also connects better with the user's current location, real-world identity, favorite places (such as work and home) and integration with services such as Foursquare and Yelp for destination-specific information, in what is seen as an attempt to pull users into spending more time in the app.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |2017\n|March\n|Product\n|Uber begins beta testing a program in select cities to pick up passengers aged 13 through 17, previously not allowed on the company's terms of service.\n|-\n| June 6 || Team || Uber CEO Travis Kalanick takes summer sabbatical after an investigation into the company's workplace culture.\n|-\n|June 21\n|Team\n|Travis Kalanick resigns as CEO.\n|-\n|August 28\n|Team\n|Dara Khosrowshahi is hired as CEO.\n|-\n|October 25\n|Product\n|A Uber branded Visa credit card is announced for the United States market, in partnership with Barclays.
