It is part of The Maritimes and is separated to the north from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia by the Northumberland Strait. The information provided is from the most recent Field Checklist of Birds published by the Government of Prince Edward Island's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, which contains 369 species observed in the province as of 2014. Of these, 78 are accidentals, 38 are occasional, and 13 are hypotheticals as defined below. Two species have been introduced to Prince Edward Island and another four were introduced elsewhere in North America.\nThis list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 62nd Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that Canadian English spellings are used and the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.\nThe following tags are used to categorise some species. The DAF Checklist provides abundance codes by season, and species may be abundant in one season and accidental in another. Therefore, an (A), (O), or (H) code is used here when a \"higher\" code does not also apply.\n* (A) Accidental - \"9 or fewer records per century\" per the DAF Checklist\n* (O) Occasional - \"seen only 1 - 9 times per decade\" per the DAF Checklist\n* (H) Hypothetical - \"unconfirmed sighting report or bird of unconfirmed origin\" per the DAF Checklist\n* (I) Introduced - \"Introduced to Prince Edward Island and now established as a breeding population\" per the DAF Checklist\n* (INA) North America - Introduced to North America but not directly to Prince Edward Island\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\nAnatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\n*Virginia rail, Rallus limicola\n*Clapper rail, Rallus crepitans (A)\n*King rail, Rallus elegans (A)\n*Sora, Porzana carolina\n*Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata (O)\n*American coot, Fulica americana\n*Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus (A)\n*Yellow rail, Coturnicops noveboracensis (A)\nCranes\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae\nCranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds.
