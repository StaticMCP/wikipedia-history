The first such stronghold was Stalingrad.\nOn the Eastern Front, Warsaw, Budapest, Vilnius, Kolberg, Königsberg, Küstrin, Danzig and Breslau were some of the large cities selected as strongholds.\nOn the Western Front, Hitler declared eleven major ports as fortresses on 19 January 1944: IJmuiden, the Hook of Holland, Dunkirk, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Le Havre, Cherbourg, Saint-Malo, Brest, Lorient, Saint-Nazaire and the Gironde estuary.  In February and March 1944 three more coastal areas were declared to be fortresses: the Channel Islands, Calais and La Rochelle.\nFate of the fortresses\nThe fate of the fortress areas varied. Stalingrad, the first to fall, is seen as a crucial turning point in the war, and one of the key battles which led to German defeat. In several cases, Alderney, for example, the fortresses were bypassed by the attackers and did not fall, surrendering only after the unconditional surrender of Germany.\nOne fortress, Courland, would see guerrilla war being waged in the area after 1945 to the late 1950s by Latvian and Lithuanian partisans, with a few Germans who fought as Forest Brothers, with individual guerrillas remaining in hiding and evading capture into the 1980s.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable data-sort-type=number sticky-header\"\n!Fortresses\n!Siege\n!Commander\n!Besiegers\n!Date declared\n!Date siege started\n!Date
