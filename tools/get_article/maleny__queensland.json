Maleny was a timber town until the early 1920s and then was a centre of dairy production and fruit growing.  In the , the locality of Maleny had a population of 3,959 people.\nGeography\nMaleny is  north of Brisbane on the Blackall Range overlooking the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Nearby towns include Landsborough, Montville, Peachester, Palmwoods and Hunchy.  Nearby places of geographical significance include the Glass House Mountains and Baroon Pocket Dam (in North Maleny).\nBaroon Pocket Dam constructed in 1989 is fed by the Obi Obi Creek, a significant tributary of the upper Mary River, which drains the basalt capped Maleny plateau.  Water runoff statistics have been kept in this area since the 1940s showing that the average annual rainfall is  and the runoff into Baroon Pocket Dam receives annually about 64,000 megalitres. The Baroon Pocket Dam holds about 61,000 megalitres of water and the treatment plant supplies about 150 megalitres of treated water to the Sunshine Coast daily.\nMaleny is situated approximately  above sea level, among the characteristic rolling green hills of the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Prior to European settlement, the area was covered in thick sub-tropical rainforest with huge hardwood trees. Loggers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries opened up the area seeking valuable timber, which was prized locally and in Europe. Heavy logging led to the almost complete denuding of the rainforest clad hills in the district around Maleny. Only a few pockets of forest remain in steeper terrain and in one large remnant patch (around ) which now forms Mary Cairncross Reserve.\nLandsborough–Maleny Road enters from the east, Maleny–Montville Road exits to the north-east, Maleny–Kenilworth Road exits to the north-west, and Maleny–Stanley River Road exits to the south-west.\nHistory\nThe name Maleny is probably derived from the parish name, which in turn is possibly derived from the Scottish place name Malleny, a historic house and garden in the Midlothian village of the same name.\nThe area around Maleny was originally populated by the Nalbo and the Dallambara — two aboriginal tribes of the Gubbi Gubbi language group. The area was known for its bunya feasts which happened every third year when the giant bunya tree was in fruit.\nThe first European to document Maleny was the explorer Ludwig Leichhardt who describes the area in his travel diary in 1844. The first European settlement followed in the wake of the Gympie gold rush of 1867. A track linking Maleny to Landsborough was cut in 1880.\nAn official proclamation of Maleny as a town occurred in 1891.\nSince just after the turn of the 20th century, the Maleny Community Centre has provided facilities to residents and visitors for a wide range of activities. The Maleny Butter Factory began operation in 1904. Two years later, Maleny Post Office opened by February 1906. (A receiving office had been open from 1889.)\nMaleny Township State School opened on 22 April 1913. In 1915 its name was changed to Maleny State School. Maleny State High School opened 27 January 1987.\nMaleny Baptist Church opened in July 1914. The Maleny branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association was formed in 1929.\nSt George's Anglican Church was dedicated on 6 September 1931 by Archbishop Sharp. It had been relocated from the Beerburrum Soldier Settlement where it was dedicated (also as St George's) on 20 August 1922 by Canon D.J. Garland, but it fell into disuse due to the failure of the settlement and was formally closed in August 1931 prior to its removal to Maleny. The building was originally built as a chapel at the Enoggera army barracks during World War I by the Soldiers' Church of England Help Society. Many of the furnishings and ornaments of the church were donated in memory of soldiers who had died, including the altar and its furnishings which were donated in the member of Earl Kitchener.\nAlthough a campaign to have a police station in the town was started in the 1920s, it wasn't until 1952 that permission to convert a house into the police station and residence (in use until 2017) was granted.\nOn 15 August 1995, the Queensland Governor Leneen Forde dedicated the Maleny War Memorial.\nMaleny hosted the Maleny Folk Festival from its inception in 1987 to 1993, when it was moved to the nearby town of Woodford and renamed to the Woodford Folk Festival.\nThe Maleny Library was opened in 1998 with a major refurbishment in 2012.\nMaleny's population growth since 2000 has brought an increase in urban development. Many local residents have resisted some of the development, the most notable being the establishment of a Woolworths store in the town. In July 2005, a rally attracted about 300 protestors objecting to the store. Many locals were opposed to the idea. (79% of local residents opposed according to \"Market Facts\" survey of 20 July 2005.) A number of motivations for the protest existed but of particular concern was that the supermarket was to be built over a significant platypus habitat and that local traders would be negatively affected as well as issues regarding local council members going against the original town planning agreement regarding all development in Maleny to be in fitting with \"the village environ\" that characterises much of the townships of the Blackall Range. Badges and posters reading \"I WON'T SHOP THERE\" were seen in Maleny as part of the anti-Woolworths campaign, although the bumper stickers can now be seen in the Woolworths car park. The campaign against the supermarket achieved international coverage. Despite protests and an offer to purchase the site for A$2 million (pledged by local residents) the supermarket opened on 3 April 2006. Although many residents refuse to shop in the supermarket, nonetheless Woolworths recorded it as one of its top 30 stores in 2008.\nIn 2013, many residents protested the construction of a petrol station and convenience store at 19 & 21 Bunya St, Maleny by the IGA Supermarket. Protestors cited proximity to the primary school as the main issue with the development proposal. The proposal was abandoned by the owners of the IGA supermarket who said \"We don't want to embroil our business in something that is controversial.\"\nIn 2016, Sydney-based advertising executive and author David Rollins proposed a \"TT Style\" motorcycle race for the Maleny area. Maleny residents formed a protest group to oppose this event called \"Peaceful Roads Sunshine Coast.\" The group protested the event citing safety, noise and access issues of concern and that the event was not in keeping with the existing tourism activities in the area. The application was withdrawn in August 2018.\nIn 2018, Jeanette Jamieson became the Anglican priest in charge of the Parish of Maleny, having previously served in the Parish of Kilcoy.\nMaleny Independent School was a private secondary (7–10) school at 23 Coral Street (). It opened in 1918, initially offering Years 7 and 8. In 2019, the school had an enrolment of 25 students with one principal (0.8 full-time equivalent), three teachers (part-time) and one non-teaching staff (part-time). As at 2024, the school has closed.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Maleny had a population of 3,734 people.\nIn the , the locality of Maleny had a population of 3,959 people.\nHeritage listings\nMaleny has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Fairview, 15 Porter's Lane\n* Maleny Lodge Guest House, 58 Maple Street\nEconomy\nThe controversial Woolworths supermarket at Maleny on the Obi Obi Creek\nMaleny has replaced its timber-cutting and dairying past with tourism with a large influx of people who wanted an alternative lifestyle. As well as being on the Hinterland tourist drive, Maleny attracts daytrippers from Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast who are attracted to the various stores, art galleries and specialty shops.\nMaleny is home to a large number of cooperative enterprises.
