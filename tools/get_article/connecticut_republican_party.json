The last Republican to represent the state in the U.S. House was Chris Shays, who lost his seat in 2008 to Jim Himes. The last Republican to represent the state in the U.S. Senate was Lowell Weicker, who lost his seat in 1988 to Joe Lieberman.\nTown committees\nIn Connecticut, there are Republican town committees in all 169 Connecticut municipalities. The 169 Republican town committees are affiliates of the Connecticut Republican Party. Town committees have the ability to endorse candidates in primary elections for local office.\nElected officials\nMembers of Congress\nU.S. Senate\n* None\nBoth of Connecticut's U.S. Senate seats have been held by Democrats since 1989. Lowell Weicker was the last Republican to represent Connecticut in the U.S. Senate. First elected in 1970, Weicker lost his bid for a fourth term in 1988 to Joe Lieberman.\nU.S. House of Representatives\n*None\nAll 5 of Connecticut's congressional districts have been held by Democrats since 2009. The last Republican to represent Connecticut in the House of Representatives was Chris Shays. First elected in a 1987 special election, Shays was subsequently defeated by Democratic challenger Jim Himes in 2008.\nStatewide offices\n* None\nConnecticut has not elected any GOP candidates to statewide office since 2006, when Jodi Rell was elected to a full term as governor. First elected as lieutenant governor in 1994, Rell assumed the position of governor in 2004 following the resignation of John G. Rowland. In 2010, Rell opted not to seek re-election to a second term. Former U.S. Ambassador Thomas C. Foley ran as the Republican nominee in the 2010 election and was subsequently defeated by Democratic challenger Dannel Malloy.\nState legislative leaders\n* Senate Minority Leader: Stephen G.
