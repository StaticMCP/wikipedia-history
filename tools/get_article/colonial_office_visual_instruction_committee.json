The committee also commissioned other artists, such as E.J. Stephenson, who was married to a patent agent in Harare called Gilbert Stephenson, and produced a series of watercolours of places and scenes in Southern Africa. Published outputs from the committee included H. Mackinder's [https://archive.org/details/eightlecturesoni00mackiala Eight Lectures on India] and four volumes by Arthur John Sargent (1871-1947), including Seven Lectures on South Africa.\nCOVIC was discontinued after World War I, though COVIC photographs continued to circulate in school classrooms until 1945.\nPapers relating to COVIC are held at Cambridge University Library.\nReferences"
