As a result, a Corps of Signals was planned to be formed in 1917, however its formation was delayed until 1920.\nThe 4th Wireless Signal Company (War Office Signals) was formed in 1934 at Aldershot Garrison to provide signal intelligence activities under the command of the War Office.\nIn 1938, the company was re-titled as No. 2 Company, General Headquarters Signals. The company later expanded its responsibility to provide secure communications for the army.\nIn September 1939, the unit was deployed to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. It was later evacuated at Dunkirk and renamed as the 1st Special Wireless Group on 18 July 1940. Following a short re-organisation, the group was deployed to the Middle East under the command of the 2nd Special Wireless Group.\nDuring the Cold War years, the group was based in Minden and re-titled as the 1st Special Wireless Regiment. In August 1946, the regiment moved to Peterborough Barracks and then moved again in 1950 to Nelson Barracks in Münster. By 1953, the regiment was moved as a result of an analysis of Soviet Forces in East Germany and by 1955, a brand new set of barracks was constructed in Wassenberg-Rothenbach, near Birgelen, on the German-Dutch Border. In 1959, as a result of the 1957 Defence White Paper reforms, the regiment was further renamed as 13th Signal Regiment (Radio).\nIn 1994, the regiment was disbanded as part of the Options for Change reforms.\nAs a result of the Army 2020 Refine reforms, the regiment was stood up on 1 June 2020 under the command of 1st Signal Brigade.\nFuture\nIn 2021, it was announced that under the Army's Future Soldier reforms programme, the regiment would be re-organised to form part of the Cyber and Electro Magnetic Activities (CEMA) Effects Group alongside 14 Signal Regiment and 21 Signal Regiment, the Army's Electronic Warfare units.\n13 Signal Regiment is set to move from their current headquarters at Blandford Camp to Basil Hill Barracks, MoD Corsham NB (not before) 2028.\nOrganisation\nThe current organisation of the regiment is:\n* Regimental Headquarters, at Blandford Camp\n* 224 (Cyber Protection Teams) Signal Squadron\n* 233 (Global Communication Networks) Signal Squadron, at Basil Hill Barracks, MoD Corsham\n**605 (Army HQ ICS) Signal Troop, at Marlborough Lines, Andover\n* 259 (Global Information Systems) Signal Squadron\n** Combat Information Systems (CIS) Trails and Development Unit (CISTDU)\n* Specialist Group Information Services (SGIS)\nSee also\n* Units of the Royal Corps of Signals\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n* Lord, Cliff, and Graham Watson.
