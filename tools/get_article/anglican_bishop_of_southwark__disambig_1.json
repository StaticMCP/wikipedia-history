In 1891, the Bishop of Rochester appointed Huyshe Yeatman-Biggs the only suffragan bishop of Southwark and an ancient parish church in Southwark was restored to become a pro-cathedral in 1897, which later became Southwark Cathedral. The bishop's residence is Bishop's House, Streatham.\nOn 1 May 1905, the Diocese of Southwark was created and covers Greater London south of the River Thames and east Surrey, broadly defined. The Bishop of Southwark is assisted by the suffragan bishops of Croydon, of Kingston and of Woolwich who each oversee an episcopal area of the diocese.\nThe current and previous bishops have been cited in canonical practice in its interpretation as \"valid but irregular\" of three ordinations of candidates ordained abroad, associated with a conservative evangelical church-forming group, the Anglican Mission in England, having expressed, in the church's view, extreme views on a complex subject.\nThe current bishop is Christopher Chessun, the 10th Bishop of Southwark, who signs +Christopher Southwark. He had previously been the area Bishop of Woolwich (2005–2011). When the post-holder ranks among the longest-serving 21 bishops heading a diocese, he or she will qualify for a place in the House of Lords, joining the other five who qualify ex officio, including the two archbishops.\nList of bishops\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\"|Diocesan Bishops of Southwark\n|-valign=\"center\"\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|From\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|Until\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"30%\"|Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"45%\"|Notes\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1905\n|align=\"center\"| 1911\n|  Edward Talbot\n| Translated from Rochester, translated to Winchester\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1911\n|align=\"center\"| 1919\n|  Hubert Burge\n| Translated to Oxford\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1919\n|align=\"center\"| 1932\n|  Cyril Garbett\n| Translated to Winchester, and later to York\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1932\n|align=\"center\"| 1941\n|  Richard Parsons\n| Translated from Middleton, translated to Hereford\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1942\n|align=\"center\"| 1959\n|  Bertram Simpson\n| Translated from Kensington\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1959\n|align=\"center\"| 1980\n|  Mervyn Stockwood\n|\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1980\n|align=\"center\"| 1991\n|  Ronald Bowlby\n| Translated from Newcastle\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1991\n|align=\"center\"| 1998\n|  Roy Williamson\n| Translated from Bradford\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1998\n|align=\"center\"| 2010\n|  Tom Butler\n| Translated from Leicester\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 2011\n|align=\"center\"| incumbent\n|  Christopher Chessun\n| Translated from Woolwich\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"4\"| Source(s):\n|}\nAssistant bishops\nAmong those who have served as assistant bishops in the diocese have been:\n*1964–1968: Gething Caulton, former Bishop of Melanesia and Assistant Bishop of Auckland\n*1968–1972 (d.): John Boys, former Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman\n*19671971 (ret.): Lawrence Barham, Minister of Emmanuel Church, Wimbledon and former Bishop of Rwanda and Burundi.
