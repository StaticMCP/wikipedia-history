He was arrested as a Jacobite, but released a few months later.\nDeath and legacy\nWarre died at Ghent 1 December 1718. and was buried with his ancestors at Kingston.  He had one son, Michael by his first marriage who was a Captain of Dragoons and who predeceased him, dying at Ghent. A son by his second wife died in infancy, and he had only a surviving daughter Margaret.  The baronetcy therefore became extinct and his estate, which included the manor of Middlezoy, went to his daughter, who married John Bampfylde and brought him the Hestercombe estate.  The estate eventually passed to a grandson John Tyndale, who adopted the name Warre.\nReferences"
