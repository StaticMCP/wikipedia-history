Veterans are defined as people who were members of the armed forces of the combatant nations during the conflict, although some states use other definitions.\nFlorence Green, a British citizen who served in the Allied armed forces as a Royal Air Force (WRAF) service member, is generally considered to have been the last verified veteran of the war at her death on 4 February 2012, aged 110. The last combat veteran was Claude Choules, who served in the British Royal Navy (and later the Royal Australian Navy) and died 5 May 2011, aged 110. The last veteran who served in the trenches was Harry Patch (British Army), who died on 25 July 2009, aged 111. The last Central Powers veteran, Franz Künstler of Austria-Hungary, died on 27 May 2008 at the age of 107.\nThe total number of participating personnel is estimated by the Encyclopædia Britannica at 65,038,810. There were approximately 9,750,000 military deaths during the conflict.\nLast surviving veterans of each country\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!data-sort-type=\"text\"|Country and Portugal.}}\n!Veteran\n!Death date\n!data-sort-type=\"number\"|Age\n|-\n|\n|\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|98 years\n|-\n|\n|John Campbell Ross\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|110 years\n|-\n|\n|\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|105 years\n|-\n|\n|Cyriel Barbary Barbary, who had served in the Belgian army in the final months of the war and emigrated to the United States, was only subsequently recognised.}}\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|105 years\n|-\n| Brazil\n|Waldemar Levy Cardoso\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|108 years\n|-\n|\n|John Babcock\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|109 years\n|-\n|\n|Zhu Guisheng\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|106 years\n|-\n|\n|Alois Vocásek\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|107 years\n|-\n|\n|style=text-align:left|\n|style=text-align:right|\n|105 years\n|-\n|\n|Lazare Ponticelli\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|110 years\n|-\n|\n|Erich Kästner\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|107 years\n|-\n|\n|Gershom Browne\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|102 years\n|-\n|\n|Franz Künstler\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|107 years\n|-\n|\n|Robert Francis Ruttledge\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|102 years\n|-\n|\n|Delfino Borroni\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|110 years\n|-\n|\n|Stanley Stair\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|107 years\n|-\n|\n|Yasuichi Sasaki\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|108 years\n|-\n|\n|\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|97 years\n|-\n| New Zealand\n|Bright Williams\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|105 years\n|-\n|\n|Wallace Pike\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|99 years\n|-\n|\n|Yakup Satar\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|110 years\n|-\n| Poland\n|Stanisław Wycech\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|105 years\n|-\n|\n|Gheorghe Pănculescu\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|103 years\n|-\n|\n|Mikhail Krichevsky}}\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|111 years\n|-\n|\n|Aleksa Radovanović\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|103 years\n|-\n| Siam\n|\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|106 years\n|-\n|\n|Norman Benjamin Kark\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|102 years\n|-\n|\n|Florence Green and Alfred Anderson (d. 2005) was the last from Scotland.}}\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|110 years\n|-\n|\n|Frank Buckles\n|style=text-align:right|\n|style=text-align:right|110 years\n|}\nNotes\nVeterans by country of service – 9 veterans who lived to 2009 or later\nOn 27 June 2006, the British Government approved a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey, to take place after the death of the last known World War I veteran from the United Kingdom.
