For the OVA series, reviewer Tim Jones criticized the art style as \"recycled\" and said the plot is \"no winner\" but that the animation and characters is what makes the OVA worth watching. He added that while the series is \"hardly revolutionary,\" it is fun, sweet, and \"riddled with eye candy.\" For Battle Athletes Victory, reviewer Carlos Ross said that it is different from the OVA series, as it has a \"more lighthearted feel\" and it has a different cast of characters, noting that while there are various stereotypes in this series, along with people of all races, there is humor, like a female character having \"a crush on her female superior.\" Ross also said that while the animation is \"beautiful\" and it has a lot of \"cute girl characters,\" the storyline is \"seemingly inconsequential\" and it reminds him of Gunbuster.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Geneon Entertainment\n**\n**\n**\n**\n* AIC\n**\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*"
