      "text": "# Juno Awards of 1971\n\nThe Juno Awards of 1971 (Juno Award), representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 22 February 1971 in Toronto at a ceremony in the St. Lawrence Hall. These would be the first awards to be formally titled the Junos as decided by RPM Magazine in 1970 following its first formal music awards event. George Wilson of CFRB radio was master of ceremonies for the awards for the second consecutive year.\nAtlantic Canadians were particularly successful at the awards in 1971, most notably producer Brian Ahern and artists Stompin' Tom Connors, Gene MacLellan and Anne Murray, prompting Murray to quip to the audience about the emergence of a \"Maritime Mafia\" in the Canadian music scene. Connors would go on to win several more Junos before returning them in protest of the awards honoring Canadian musicians who primarily make their career outside of Canada.\nNominated and winning people\nBest Female Vocalist\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n* Susan Jacks\n* Debbie Lori Kaye\n* Joni Mitchell\n* Ginette Reno\nBest Male Vocalist\nWinner: Gordon Lightfoot\nOther nominees:\n* Andy Kim\n* Pierre Lalonde\n* Gene MacLellan\n* Tom Northcott\nBest Group\nWinner: The Guess Who\nOther nominees:\n* Edward Bear\n* Lighthouse\n* Mashmakhan\n* The Poppy Family\nBest Songwriter\nWinner: Gene MacLellan (Special Award: Canadian Composer)\nBest Country Female Artist\nWinner: Myrna Lorrie\nOther nominees:\n* Debbie Lori Kaye\n* Dianne Leigh\n* Julie Lynn\n* Donna Ramsay\nBest Country Male Artist\nWinner: Stompin' Tom Connors\nOther nominees:\n* Gary Buck\n* Dick Damron\n* Tommy Hunter\n* Hank Smith\nBest Country Group or Duo\nWinner: The Mercey Brothers\nOther nominees:\n* The Chaparrals\n* The Hickorys\n* The Rainvilles\n* Rhythm Pals\nTop Folk Singer\nWinner: Bruce Cockburn\nOther nominees:\n* Great Speckled Bird\n* Anthony Green and Barry Stagg\n* Joni Mitchell\n* Tom Northcott\nMusic industry Man of the Year\nWinner: Pierre Juneau\nBroadcaster of the Year\nWinner: Standard Broadcasting, noted for its Canadian Talent Library\nTop Canadian Content Company of the Year\nWinner: Quality Records\nOther nominees:\n* Capitol Records\n* Columbia Records\n* London Records\n* RCA Records\nTop Record Company of the Year\nWinner: Capitol Records\nOther nominees:\n* Columbia Records\n* Quality Records\n* RCA Records\n* Warner Bros.
