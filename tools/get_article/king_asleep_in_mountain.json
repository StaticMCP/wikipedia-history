Thompson termed it as the Kyffhäuser type. Some other designations are king in the mountain, king under the mountain, sleeping hero, or Bergentrückung (\"mountain rapture\").\n(Danish: Holger Danske) in Kronborg Castle, Helsingør; Ogier is said to sleep in the castle until one day when Denmark is in peril]]\nExamples include the legends of King Arthur, Fionn mac Cumhaill, Charlemagne, Ogier the Dane, King David, Frederick Barbarossa at Kyffhäuser, Falanto of Taranto, Genghis Khan, Constantine XI Palaiologos, Kraljević Marko, Sebastian of Portugal and King Matjaž.\nThe Thompson motif entries A 571, \"Cultural hero asleep in mountain\", and E 502, \"The Sleeping Army\", are similar and can occur in the same tale. A related motif is the \"Seven Sleepers\" (D 1960.1, also known as the \"Rip Van Winkle\" motif), whose type tale is the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus (AT tale type 766).\nGeneral features\nKing in the mountain stories involve legendary heroes, often accompanied by armed retainers, sleeping in remote dwellings including caves on high mountaintops, remote islands, or supernatural worlds. The hero is frequently a historical figure of some military consequence in the history of the nation where the mountain is located.\nThe stories gathered by the Brothers Grimm concerning Frederick Barbarossa and Charlemagne are typical of the stories told, and have been influential on many variants and subsequent adaptations. The presence of the hero is unsuspected; until some herdsman wanders into the cave, typically looking for a lost animal, and sees the hero. The stories almost always mention the detail that the hero has grown a long beard, indicative of the long time he has slept beneath the mountain.\nIn the Brothers Grimm version, the hero speaks with the herdsman. Their conversation typically involves the hero asking, \"Do the eagles (or ravens) still circle the mountaintop?\" The herdsman, or a mysterious voice, replies, \"Yes, they still circle the mountaintop.\" \"Then begone! My time has not yet come.\"\nThe herdsman in this story was then supernaturally harmed by the experience: he ages rapidly, he emerges with his hair turned white, and often he dies after repeating the tale. The story goes on to say that the king sleeps in the mountain, awaiting a summons to arise with his knights and defend the nation in a time of deadly peril. The omen that presages his rising will be the extinction of the birds that trigger his awakening.\nExamples from Europe\nA number of European kings, rulers, fictional characters and religious figures have become attached to this story. Major examples are King Arthur of Britain, Charlemagne of the Franks, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, as well as  Ogier the Dane and William Tell.\nBaltic states\n* A motif in Latvian legends involves a castle sinking into ground leaving a hill behind it. In legends that have someone enter such hill, the inhabitants of the castle are found in sleep-like state. If the visitor is able to guess the name of the castle, it is returned to the surface with its inhabitants awakened. The choir song \"Gaismas pils\" (The Castle of Light), which is part of Latvia's Cultural Canon, drew inspiration from these legends.\n* Vytautas the Great in Lithuania is believed by some to rise from the grave to defend the country when danger threatens it.\nBritain and Ireland\n* King Arthur (Great Britain and Brittany). According to the legend, Arthur was taken away to Avalon to sleep until he was needed by the people of Britain. Several legends talk of a herdsman who stumbles across a cave on mainland Britain, wherein he finds Arthur sleeping, often with his knights and Excalibur by his side. In a variation on this, sometimes the exploring herdsman finds instead just Arthur's knights, or Sir Lancelot, Guinevere and the knights sleeping in wait on the return of the \"Once and Future King\". In early Arthurian literature, Arthur references his predecessor Brân the Blessed as having his head placed on a mound overlooking Britain so as to protect it. He wishes to do the same, and later they overlook and protect Britain together.\n* Merlin of the Arthurian legend, who is imprisoned in an oak tree by Nimue.\n* Thomas the Rhymer is found under a hill with a retinue of knights in a tale from Anglo-Scottish border. Likewise, Harry Hotspur was said to have been hunting in the Cheviots when he and his hounds got holed-up in the Hen Hole (or \"Hell-hole\"), awaiting the sound of a hunting horn to awaken them from their slumber. Another border variant concerns a party of huntsmen who chased a roebuck into the Cheviots when they heard the sweetest music playing from the Henhole. However, when they entered, they became lost and are trapped to this day.\nWales\n* Brân the Blessed. Referenced as protecting the Isles and overlooking Britain; his head severed and placed on a mound. Arthur later says he wishes to do the same and in early Arthurian literature both guard Britain together.\n* Owain Lawgoch, Welsh soldier and nobleman (14th century).\n* Owain Glyndŵr, the last native born Welshman to hold the title \"Prince of Wales\"; he disappeared after a long but ultimately unsuccessful rebellion against the English. He was never captured or betrayed and refused all Royal pardons.\n* An unnamed giant is supposed to sleep in Plynlimon.\nIreland\n* Fionn mac Cumhaill is said to sleep in a cave/mountain surrounded by the Fianna.

In other accounts he will return to glory as a great hero of Ireland.\n* The 3rd Earl of Desmond, who dozes under Lough Gur with his silver-shod horse.\n* The 8th Earl of Kildare, who is at temporary rest under the Curragh of Kildare.\n* Dónall na nGeimhlach Ó Donnchú, in legend around County Kerry.\n* Cu Chulainn in Nationalist circles in Northern Ireland.\nEngland\n* King Harold.

It is stated that if England is in deadly peril and Drake's Drum is beaten, then Sir Francis Drake will arise to defend England from the sea. According to the legend, Drake's Drum can be heard at times when England is at war or significant national events take place.\n* Knights asleep at Alderley Edge in Cheshire. There is an enduring legend of a cavern full of knights in armour awaiting a call to decide the fate of a great battle for England. There is no king named, but there is a wizard involved, who is referred to as Merlin in later versions of the legend.\n* King Dunmail. A Cumbrian King said to be defeated at the hands of Edmund I of England and Malcolmn of Alba. Dunmail's warriors are said to have fled with his crown, climbing into the mountains to Grisedale Tarn below Helvellyn, where they threw it into the depths to be safe until some future time when Dunmail would come again to lead them.

Folklore reports another instance of evidence that Genghis would return: every year there is a sacrifice for Genghis Khan in the Ordos and two white horses (the horses of Genghis Khan) appear. In the third year of the Chinese Republic (1914), though, just one horse appeared. When the second horse came, four years later, it had saddle galls.

He was decapitated by the Spaniards, who buried his head in an unknown location. The head is not dead but hibernating while it regenerates the rest of the body. When the regeneration is complete, Inkarri will return.\n** In the second, Inkarri and his wife Qollari were the founders of Cusco.

Though Muslims believe Jesus will return to Earth, this is not a resurrection, as Muslims do not believe Jesus died on the cross. Rather, Muslims generally believe that Jesus entered Heaven alive, and that he will return to Earth before the End of Days. See also: Islamic view of Jesus' death and Occultation (Islam)\nDruze\n* al-Ḥākim bi-Amr Allāh (either died or disappeared in 1021 AD at the age of 35), is believed by the Druze to return at the End of Time to rule from Egypt.\nHinduism\n* Viṣṇu is often depicted as asleep, woken up by the other gods asking for his help. His avatar Krishna informs Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita that he periodically returns to Earth to establish order and justice. The Mahabharata specifically claims that Vishnu will appear in his tenth avatar of Kalki, yet to come, at the end of the Kali Yuga to rule as king.\nSleeping anti-hero and villain\nSometimes this type of story or archetype is also attached to not-so-heroic figures, who are either simple anti-heroes or fully villains, whose return would mean the end of the world, or whose sleep represents something positive. This kind of archetype is known as the \"Chained Satan\" archetype.

One day he will supposedly awaken and destroy the world.\n* Artavasdes I of Armenia, who according to Moses of Chorene was chained and cursed to stay eternally chained by his father Artaxias I.\n* Loki in Norse mythology was bound by the gods after he engineered the death of Baldr.
