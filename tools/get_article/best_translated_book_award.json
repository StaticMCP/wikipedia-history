It was inaugurated in 2008 and was conferred by Three Percent, the online literary magazine of Open Letter Books, which is the book translation press of the University of Rochester. A long list and short list were announced each year leading up to the award.\nThe award took into consideration not only the quality of the translation but the entire package: the work of the original writer, translator, editor, and publisher. The award was \"an opportunity to honor and celebrate the translators, editors, publishers, and other literary supporters who help make literature from other cultures available to American readers.\"\nIn October 2010 Amazon.com announced it would be underwriting the prize with a $25,000 grant. This would allow both the translator and author to receive a $5,000 prize. Prior to this the award did not carry a cash prize.\nIn January 2023, the prize's initiator, Chad Post, announced on the Three Percent blog that the award, which had not been given out since 2020, would remain on \"continued hiatus.\"\nWinners\nFiction\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- bgcolor=\"#505050\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Original title\n!Translated title\n!Translator\n!Language\n!Publisher\n!Country\n|-\n| 2008\n| Dorothea Dieckmann\n| Guantánamo\n| Guantanamo\n| Tim Mohr\n| German\n| Soft Skull\n| Germany\n|-\n| 2009\n| Attila Bartis\n| A nyugalom\n| Tranquility\n| Imre Goldstein\n| Hungarian\n| Archipelago\n| Hungary\n|-\n| 2010\n| Gail Hareven\n| שאהבה נפשי\n| The Confessions of Noa Weber\n| Dalya Bilu\n| Hebrew\n| Melville House Publishing\n| Israel\n|-\n|2011\n| Tove Jansson\n| Den ärliga bedragaren\n| The True Deceiver\n| Thomas Teal\n| Swedish\n| New York Review Books\n| Finland\n|-\n|2012\n| Wiesław Myśliwski\n| Kamień na kamieniu\n| Stone Upon Stone\n| Bill Johnston\n| Polish\n| Archipelago Books\n| Poland\n|-\n|2013\n| László Krasznahorkai\n| Sátántangó\n| Satantango\n| George Szirtes\n| Hungarian\n| New Directions\n| Hungary\n|-\n|2014\n| László Krasznahorkai\n| Seiobo járt odalent\n| Seiobo There Below\n| Ottilie Mulzet\n| Hungarian\n| New Directions\n| Hungary\n|-\n|2015\n| Can Xue\n| 最后的情人\n| The Last Lover\n| Annelise Finegan Wasmoen\n| Chinese\n| Yale University Press\n| China\n|-\n|2016\n| Yuri Herrera\n| Señales que precederán al fin del mundo\n| Signs Preceding the End of the World\n| Lisa Dillman\n| Spanish\n| And Other Stories\n| Mexico\n|-\n|2017\n| Lúcio Cardoso\n| Crônica da casa assassinada\n| Chronicle of the Murdered House\n| Margaret Jull Costa and Robin Patterson\n| Portuguese\n| Open Letter Books\n| Brazil\n|-\n|2018\n| Rodrigo Fresán\n| La parte inventada\n| The Invented Part\n| Will Vanderhyden\n| Spanish\n| Open Letter Books\n| Argentina\n|-\n|2019\n| Patrick Chamoiseau\n| ''L'esclave vieil homme et le molosse\n| Slave Old Man\n| Linda Coverdale\n| French\n| New Press\n| Martinique\n|-\n|2020\n| Daša Drndić\n| colspan=\"2\"| EEG\n| Celia Hawkesworth\n| Croatian\n| New Directions\n| Croatia\n|-\n|}\nPoetry\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- bgcolor=\"#505050\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Original title\n!Translated title\n!Translator\n!Language\n!Publisher\n!Country\n|-\n| 2009\n| Takashi Hiraide\n| 胡桃の戦意のために\n| For the Fighting Spirit of the Walnut\n| Sawako Nakayasu\n| Japanese\n| New Directions\n| Japan\n|-\n| 2010\n| Elena Fanailova\n| Русская версия\n| The Russian Version\n| Genya Turovskaya and Stephanie Sandler\n| Russian\n| Ugly Duckling Presse\n| Russia\n|-\n| 2011\n| Aleš Šteger\n| Knjiga reči\n| The Book of Things\n| Brian Henry\n| Slovenian\n| BOA Editions\n| Slovenia\n|-\n| 2012\n| Kiwao Nomura\n|\n| Spectacle & Pigsty\n| Kyoko Yoshida and Forrest Gander\n| Japanese\n| Omnidawn\n| Japan\n|-\n| 2013\n| Nichita Stănescu\n|\n| Wheel with a Single Spoke\n| Sean Cotter\n| Romanian\n| Archipelago Books\n| Romania\n|-\n| 2014\n| Elisa Biagini\n|\n| The Guest in the Wood\n| Diana Thow, Sarah Stickney and Eugene Ostashevsky\n| Italian\n| Chelsea Editions\n| Italy\n|-\n| 2015\n| Rocío Cerón\n| colspan=\"2\"| Diorama\n| Anna Rosenwong\n| Spanish\n| Phoneme Media\n| Mexico\n|-\n| 2016\n| Angélica Freitas\n| colspan=\"2\"| Rilke Shake\n| Hilary Kaplan\n| Portuguese\n| Phoneme Media\n| Brazil\n|-\n| 2017\n| Alejandra Pizarnik\n| Extracción de la piedra de locura\n| Extracting the Stone of Madness\n| Yvette Siegert\n| Spanish\n| New Directions\n| Argentina\n|-\n| 2018\n| Eleni Vakalo\n|\n| Before Lyricism\n| Karen Emmerich\n| Greek\n| Ugly Duckling Presse\n| Greece\n|-\n| 2019\n| Hilda Hilst\n| Da morte.
