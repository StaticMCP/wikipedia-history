The bank was established by royal charter on 1 June 1836, and had opened offices in most of the territories by 1837.\nThe  (6 & 7 Geo. 5. c. vi) gave the Colonial Bank the power to operate throughout the British Empire, and it expanded to West Africa. The  (7 & 8 Geo. 5. c. xlviii) further extended the bank's powers, allowing it to operate in any part of the world. Later in 1917, the Colonial Bank entered into a working arrangement with Barclays Bank.\nBarclays Bank obtained control of Colonial Bank in 1919, and following re-incorporation by the  (15 & 16 Geo. 5. c. cvi) it changed its name to Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas). The Anglo-Egyptian Bank and the National Bank of South Africa were then merged into Barclays Bank DCO.\nReferences"
