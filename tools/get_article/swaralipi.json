As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a Pythagorean fifth rather than an equal-tempered fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes'). Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' () pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, , the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the  pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-\"flat\") (thus,  is a half-step higher than Sa). Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (-\"sharp\") (thus,  Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni are called  ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the , and for the higher variety of all the . Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the .\nReferences"
