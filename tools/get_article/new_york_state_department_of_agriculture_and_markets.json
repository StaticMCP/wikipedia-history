It principally investigates animal and plant diseases, regulates food safety and labeling, promotes state agriculture, and administers the New York State Fair. Its regulations are compiled in title 1 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations.\nAgroeconomy\nAgriculture is a major component of the New York economy. As of the 2012 census of agriculture, there were over 35,000 farms covering an area of  which contributed $5.4 billion in gross sales value and $1.2 billion in net farm income to the national economy. The Finger Lakes region is the center of state agriculture, and the state is a top-ten national producer of cow milk, apples, grapes, onions, sweet corn, tomatoes, and maple syrup.\nStructure and services\nKosher food registry\nNew York State's concern for consumer protection of those seeking to buy kosher food was documented in  the 1920s, but a New York Times article noted that some legal protection \"originated in the late 19th century.\"\nWhile the department \"maintains an online registry of food represented as kosher\" it does not define what is kosher. Consumers are provided, per the Kosher Law Protection Act of 2004, with \"information identifying the person or organization certifying that food as kosher,\" and as of 2005 may also search online.\nIn addition, the department verifies that claims about this \"food product, ... food establishment or a caterer\" are in compliance with consumer protection standards. In 1986 there were 12 inspectors, headed by Schulem Rubin, Director of the Kosher Law Enforcement Division. One significant change Rubin made was to add more people with experience as kosher butchers.\n]]\nBased on legislation passed in July 2004, data is submitted by those \"involved in the kosher food industry\" and also about qualifications of those who provide certification.\nSoil and water conservation\nThe New York State Soil and Water Conservation Committee is an independent agency within the department that supports natural resources management through the support of soil and water conservation districts, which represent each of the 57 counties of New York and New York City (for the 5 counties thereof).\nThe state committee administers the Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution (NPS) Abatement and Control Grant Program, the Agricultural Environmental Management (AEM) Base Program, the annual district reimbursement, and provides review and oversight for AEM Planner certification. The US Natural Resources Conservation Service continues to set standards for water conservation best management practices (BMP) and administers farm bill conservation programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Agricultural Management Assistance Program (AMA), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (FRPP), Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP).\nHistory\nThe department's progenitor was the 1884 New York State Dairy Commission that inspected dairy production and sales facilities, which was abolished in 1893 and its functions transferred to the Department of Agriculture that inspected farms, set agricultural quality standards, and operated agricultural experiment stations. A separate Department of Foods and Markets was established in 1914 to set standards for grading and selling food, supervise markets, and publish information on dairy prices and marketing methods. In 1917, these two departments and the 1851 Office of State Superintendent of Weights and Measures were consolidated into the Department of Farms and Markets, headed by the Council of Farms and Markets.\nThe current Department of Agriculture and Markets was established as part of the 1926 reorganization of government under Governor Al Smith and was transferred the functions of the Department of Foods and Markets as well as the State Fair Commission. In 1935 the Council of Farms and Markets was abolished and the power to appoint the commissioner transferred to the governor. In February 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent to the states the Standard State Soil Conservation Districts Law, a model law, and on April 23, 1940 the New York State Soil and Water Conservation Committee was established and the soil and water conservation districts authorized when the Soil Conservation District Law was enacted, and in April 1964 water was added to the jurisdiction and in 1981 the state committee was transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Markets.\nList of commissioners\n* John J.
