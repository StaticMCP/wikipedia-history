It was directed by Willi Patterson.\nPlot\nSuzanne, a beautiful widow, has to choose between Frank, a philandering dentist, and Tony, a sensitive, failing sports trainer who helps her son.\nCast\n* Anthony Edwards as Tony\n* Jenny Seagrove as Suzanne\n* Charles Dance as Frank\nProduction Notes\nDr. Fiedler played by Tom Conti is a parody of Dr Fassbender played by Peter Sellers in the movie What's New Pussycat?.\nBill Kenwright had to mortgage his own £1 million London home to pay for its production. Geoff Morrow who wrote the screenplay also wrote the 1977-hit Can't Smile Without You. Despite being second billed, Linford Christie only makes a short cameo appearance in the pre-credit scene of the film.\nReception\nJulianne Pidduck from Sight & Sound praised several aspects of the film, however she concluded: \" But despite all efforts, an uninspired script and uneven direction fail to make Suzanne's unhappy lurches from mourning widow to tender lover plausible.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/712 Don't Go Breaking My Heart at BFI]"
