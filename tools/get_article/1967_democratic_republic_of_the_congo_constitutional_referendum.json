The new constitution created a unitary state with a presidential system, whereby the president would be selected by a unicameral National Assembly and then approved by a referendum. It also abolished presidential term limits, limited the number of political parties to two, and gave women the vote.\nThe proposed constitution was approved by 97.8% of voters.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|-\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For\n|8,220,000\n|97.8\n|-\n|align=left|Against\n|184,907\n|2.2\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes\n|\n| -\n|-\n|align=left|Total\n|8,404,907\n|100\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: Nohlen et al.\n|}\nReferences"
