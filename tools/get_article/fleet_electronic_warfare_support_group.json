FEWSG also operated their own aircraft under contract, most notably EB-47E, NKC-135A and an EC-24A.  FEWSG was joined with the Fleet Deception Group Atlantic in May 1992 to form the Fleet Tactical Readiness Group (FTRG). The FTRG had an inventory of EW jammers and threat simulators for realistic training for operators.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/list/e.htm Electronic Aircraft Variants]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060715115304/http://www.reenactor.net/vaq-33/index.htm VAQ-33]\n*[http://www.vaq34.com/vaq34/ VAQ-34]\n*[http://www.vaq34.com/vaq34/vaqfewsg1.htm VAQ-34 - Fleet Electronic Warfare Support Group Aircraft and Assets web page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20011005191719/http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/PART12.PDF Chronology of Significant Events in Naval Aviation The First Half of the Nineties 1991-1995]"
