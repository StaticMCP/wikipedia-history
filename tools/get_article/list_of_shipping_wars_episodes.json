Roy Garber and Jarrett Joyce are the big winners of the transports, respectively, but there's no time to celebrate when they both realize they may have bitten off more than they can chew. If the steel horse doesn't arrive on time, Roy will lose half his pay. Meanwhile, the Venus Flytrap is on a deadline for the opening night of the \"Little Shop of Horrors\" premiere. If Jarrett doesn't deliver the oversized prop on time, then the show doesn't happen. The stakes are high as they race to make sure their loads arrive intact and on time. One mistake and these loads could be their last.\n| Viewers         = 3.084\n}}\n| ProdCode = 102 / 02\n| ShortSummary    = When shipments hit the auction block, the Bawcoms score a shipment for a 35 foot freshwater boat while Roy gets stuck transporting an old English phone booth after he tries to teach Jarrett a lesson.\n| Viewers         = 2.957\n}}\n| ProdCode = 104 / 04\n| ShortSummary    = When livestock hits the uShip auction, Jennifer makes her move and wins a haul of two bucking bulls, while Marc gets a fragile experimental aircraft.

After Marc quickly loads up the tanks, he's got to find his way through a maze of round-a-bouts in a small Pennsylvania town before he even makes it to the highway. Roy has to make this delivery and get back home in time for his son's graduation, but when he's caught up in one of the worst storms in history, will he damage the load and find himself out of pocket for this priceless antique?\n| Viewers            = 2.435\n}}\n| ProdCode = 105 / 05\n| ShortSummary    = When it comes to the biggest and baddest loads, Marc can't help but throw his hat in the ring. Fighting off Scott and Susie, he lands the job hauling a 1928 train caboose. When he arrives, Marc finds more of a remodel project than a shipment, and has to get to work right away. Pushing the limits, this load could make him a small fortune, or sink his ship before he makes it across the country. When Roy wins the privilege to ship a pristine condition 1955 Ford Thunderbird, he's sure it'll be an easy run. But when he arrives to pick up the vintage automobile, it's the neighbors who give him more grief than he's paid for.\n| Viewers            = 2.587\n}}\n| ProdCode = 106 / 06\n| ShortSummary    = Jennifer uses her experience transporting livestock to win a camel shipment from Oklahoma to Vermont.

Jarrett picks up a 400-lb wooden African sculpture.\n| Viewers            = 2.175\n}}\n| ProdCode = 108 / 08\n| ShortSummary    = Jennifer may have taken her livestock specialty too far when she tops the transporters in an auction to ship a number of small animals. Between the smell, the constant feedings, and the never-ending squeals, it may be the last run Jennifer makes with so many critters. Jarrett outbids Marc in the competition to haul a go-kart in the shape of a miniature semi-tractor trailer. Moving it up the coast, he must deliver the tiny automobile in time for a local Shriner event, which will feature an entire fleet of mini semis turned go-karts. But when his van breaks down once again, it may be the last straw for this rookie's unreliable transportation.\n| Viewers            = 2.393\n}}\n| ProdCode = 109 / 09\n| ShortSummary    = Marc is headed to Mexico when he wins an auction to ship a $100,000 Baja 1000 Trophy Truck.

Scott and Susie take their boat hauling knowledge to a whole new level when they transport a wooden pirate ship across the southwest.

The precariously positioned arachnid requires reinforcements to ensure its safety, putting the young couple to work. Roy moves the largest cargo of his career with a 42- foot water tower.
