Founded on December 12, 1985, by Mark E. Seremet and Antony Davies, the company was best known for games developed around licenses from Marvel Comics, including ''The Amazing Spider-Man and Captain America in Dr. Doom's Revenge!'', and licenses from Game Designers' Workshop, such as the MegaTraveller series. On July 27, 1992, MicroProse announced that they had acquired Paragon Software, and that the company would be merged into MicroProse as a result of it. The company had 19 employees at the time. The studio's final game, XF5700 Mantis Experimental Fighter, was released under the MicroProse branding on September 2, 1992.\nGames\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year\n! Title\n!
