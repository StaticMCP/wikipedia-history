She became the Countess of Arundel and Surrey in 1815 when Bernard succeeded as 12th Duke, and upon the death of her husband's father in 1842, she became the Duchess of Norfolk. The couple later had five children:\n*Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk (1815&ndash;1860)\n*Lord Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Glossop (1818&ndash;1883)\n* Lady Mary Charlotte Howard (1822&ndash;1897) m. Thomas Foley, 4th Baron Foley\n*Lord Bernard Thomas Fitzalan-Howard (1825&ndash;1846)\n* Lady Adeliza Matilda Fitzalan-Howard (1829-1904) m. her cousin Lord George Manners\nHenry Charles Howard and his father were Roman Catholics, although his mother Lady Elizabeth Belasyse was Anglican. It is not clear if Howard was formally and nominally raised Anglican, or if he was already Catholic when he married into a prominent Whig (and therefore anti-Catholic) family.  In 1829, after Catholic emancipation, the Earl of Surrey (as he now was) was elected a Member of Parliament.\nOne of the duchess's most accomplished works was a 166-piece collection of songs and piano pieces that she translated into five languages between 1811 and 1823. It includes works from composers such as Rousseau, Gay, Mozart, Arnold, Arne and Handel. The collection is currently held by Yale University.\nReferences"
