A flash flood is a sudden, violent flood after a heavy rain, or occasionally after a dam break. Rainfall intensity and duration, topography, soil conditions, and ground cover contribute to flash flooding.\nMost flash floods occur when there is a heavy amount of precipitation falling in an area and that water is then channeled through streams or narrow gullies. Flash floods may take minutes or hours to develop. It is possible to experience a flash flood without witnessing any rain.\nFlash flood alerts\nThere are two types of alerts for flash floods which are issued by the National Weather Service. One is a flash flood watch, which means that conditions are favorable for flash flooding, and the other is a flash flood warning, meaning that a flash flood is occurring or one will occur imminently and is usually issued when there are strong weather radar echoes for an area that is prone to flash flooding.\nFlash floods can also occur because of a dam or levee failure, or because of a sudden release of water held by an ice jam.\nResidents are usually urged to do the following when flash flooding is imminent:\n* Be aware of any signs of heavy rain\n* Move to higher ground if rapidly rising water is seen or heard\n* Not attempt to cross the flowing water\nFlash flood emergency\nIn addition, there is an enhanced version of flash flood warning, referred to as a flash flood emergency (or as termed by the Albany, New York office as a flash flood warning emergency), which indicates a severe flooding situation, often, but not always in densely populated areas, similar to the procedure for declaring a tornado emergency.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, examples of situations that warrant the inclusion of flash flood emergency language in flash flood warnings may include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n* Emergency manager(s) of the affected county(ies) or the state emergency management association declare a state of emergency and have confirmed that rapidly rising floodwaters are placing or will place people in life-threatening situations.  The state of emergency for the affected areas may have been previously relayed by the emergency manager(s) or the state emergency management association through the local NWS forecast office in a Non-Weather emergency message. These might include a Civil Emergency Message (CEM), an Evacuation Immediate (EVI), or a Local Area Emergency (LAE).\n* Water has rapidly risen or will rapidly rise to levels where people who are ordinarily in safe locations during previous flash flood events are now placed in life-threatening situations. For example, people in homes that might see waters rapidly rise up to their front yards or steps during typical flash flood situations would experience waters that are several feet above floor level, such that rescue is necessary and/or their entire home is threatened.\n* Multiple swift water rescue teams have been or are being deployed in response to flash flooding of an exceptional magnitude.\n* Stream gages, where available, indicate floodwaters have risen rapidly to at least major levels, or if gages are not available, floodwaters have risen to levels rarely, if ever, seen.\n* Total failure of a major high hazard dam that would have a catastrophic impact on the downstream communities.\nThe National Weather Service also notes that in situations where a robust emergency management structure does not exist or external communications are not possible, a local forecast office may include flash flood emergency language in a flash flood warning without pre-coordinating with emergency managers when the above or similar criteria are met.\nNotable events where flash flood emergencies were issued\nOn August 27, 2017, as Hurricane Harvey brought torrential rain to southeast Texas, the NWS issued a \"Flash Flood Emergency for Catastrophic Life Threatening Flooding.\"\nOn September 10, 2017, the NWS issued a Flash Flood Emergency for life-threatening storm surge because of Hurricane Irma in southwestern Florida at the eye landfall.\nOn February 6, 2020, the NWS issued a Flash Flood Emergency for Tazewell County, Virginia due to a major storm moving through the area which caused the Clinch River to rise to its highest crest in 40 years.\nOn May 20, 2020, the NWS issued a Flash Flood Emergency for the Tittabawassee River in Midland County, Michigan due to multiple dam failures causing the river to overflow and reach its highest crest since 1986.\nOn July 6, 2020, the NWS issued a Flash Flood Emergency for Tacony Creek and Frankford Creek, the former situated along Montgomery County and North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the latter along Philadelphia's Frankford neighborhood.\nOn September 2, 2021, the NWS issued a first ever Flash Flood Emergency for New York City, Philadelphia, Fairfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut, and most of Central New Jersey a region that stretches over 200 miles, as the remnants of Hurricane Ida transitioned and intensified into a post tropical cyclone causing torrential rains. Some areas reported up to 10 inches of rain in less than an hour. Although the region was forecasted to experience heavy rains, this event is considered unprecedented as such a warning has never been issued to the area. The region had already experienced above average precipitation for most of the Summer due to previous storm systems and tropical storms affecting the area.\nOn July 28, 2022, the NWS issued several Flash Flood Emergencies in eastern Kentucky for catastrophic and deadly flooding.\nOn March 27, 2023, the NWS issued a Flash Flood Emergency for a dam break on the Head's Creek Reservoir in Spaulding County, Georgia. A [https://twitter.com/NWSAtlanta/status/1640378615375470594 statement] was later posted on Twitter.\nOn September 27, 2024, a Flash Flood Emergency was issued for Metro Atlanta as Hurricane Helene brought catastrophic flooding to the area.\nOn October 9, 2024, a Flash Flood Emergency was issued for several counties in the Tampa Bay and Big Bend areas of Florida as Hurricane Milton posed life-threatening flooding to a large portion of the West Coast.\nFrom July 4-7, 2025, several Flash Flood Emergencies were issued in central Texas, as a slow-moving mesoscale convective complex caused catastrophic flooding, particularly in Kerr County. At least 135 people have been confirmed dead from this event as of August 8, 2025.\nOn July 14, 2025, a Flash Flood Emergency was issued for Union and Somerset counties in New Jersey as a slow-moving thunderstorm caused life-threatening flooding to Plainfield and nearby areas in the Raritan Valley.\nExample of a flash flood warning and emergency\nWarning\nThis warning was issued following a dam failure along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border.\nFlash Flood Warning\nMNC115-WIC013-031-192330-\n/O.NEW.KDLH.FF.W.0012.180618T2329Z-180619T2330Z/\n/00000.U.DM.000000T0000Z.000000T0000Z.000000T0000Z.OO/\nBULLETIN - EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\nFlash Flood Warning\nNational Weather Service Duluth MN\n1203 PM CDT SUN JUN 18 2018\nThe National Weather Service in Eastern Duluth MN has issued a\n* Flash Flood Warning for...\nA Dam Failure in...\nEast central Pine County in east central Minnesota...\nNorthwestern Douglas County in northwestern Wisconsin...\nNorth central Burnett County in northwestern Wisconsin...\n* Until 543 PM CDT\n* At 1201 PM CDT, local law enforcement reported the Radigan Flowage\nDam west of Dairyland has failed, causing flash flooding\ndownstream on the Tamarack River south of the Dam as it flows\ntowards the Saint Croix River.\n* Locations impacted include...\nTown Rd T west of Dairyland.\nSwedish Highway at the Tamarack River.\nHighway T west of Cozy Corner.\nMarkville Road east of Markville.\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\nTurn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads.
