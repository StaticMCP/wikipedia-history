Letters patent have also been used for the creation of corporations or offices, for granting city status, for granting coat of arms, and for granting royal assent.\nPatents are prepared by the Crown Office; the name of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery is subscribed/printed at the end of all documents as a way of authentication of their having passed through the Crown Office.\nThe form of letters patent have been disclosed by the Crown Office as pro forma texts, and have been compiled here. The Ministry of Justice has said in the past that there are 92 unique types of letters. The text of letters patent can be altered for specification in certain situations, though the following texts are the general basis for draft.\nTerminology\nIn appointing a person to an office through letters patent, there are three documents involved:\n* The warrant – This contains the monarch's instructions to the Lord Chancellor to prepare letters patent. The Lord Chancellor delivers the said instructions to the Crown Office, who under the guidance of the Clerk of the Crown prepare the patent.\n* Letters patent (sometimes called the patent) – the document which actually makes the appointment; it is sealed by either the Great Seal or its wafer form, and is typed or handwritten on vellum.\n* The patent roll entry – this is a record of the warrant. The patent roll entries are bound together at the end of each regnal year and are sent to The National Archives, together with the warrants for permanent retention and storage.\nThese documents are not always given to the appointee. Letters patent come at a cost for an appointee who elects to receive an illustrated document prepared by the scribes at the Crown Office, but is otherwise entitled to receive a text-only version for nothing. The patent roll entry is exclusively held by The National Archives and is not given to the appointee.\nPatents, most notably before the 20th century, were granted with special conditions. The following methods were mainly used in regards to the appointment of individuals to offices, whose purpose was to allow the holder to pick his successor.\n* Grant in reversion – granted to a person after the demise of the current holders (or sometimes after the demise of multiple future holders)\n* Grant in survivorship – granted to two persons who hold the office collectively; upon the death of one of the parties the remaining assumes the office alone\nTypes of letters patent\nRemoval from office\nPersons may be removed of an office through letters patent, though this process is reserved for offices that were granted through patents in the first place. Modern patents, instead of requiring this form be issued, state that the grantee shall replace the present holder of the office in question.\nCharles the Third by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Our other Realms and Territories King Head of the Commonwealth Defender of the Faith To all to whom these Presents shall come Greeting Whereas on the XX day of XX two thousand and XX We of Our especial grace and favour conferred XX upon XX as a XX Now Know Ye that We of Our certain knowledge and mere motion do hereby cancel and annul the XX conferred upon the said XX as a XX together with all rights precedences privileges and advantages to the same degree title honour and dignity belonging or appertaining thereto In Witness whereof We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent Witness Ourself at Westminster the XX day of XX in the XX year of Our Reign\nPeerage and baronetage\nPeerages: Peerages may be created for individuals for life, or as hereditary peerages.
