Serving as the successor to 1975's Made in the Shade, it covers material from the recording sessions of ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll (1974), Black and Blue (1976), Some Girls (1978) and Emotional Rescue (1980). Deviating from the standard practice of \"greatest hits\" albums, it features a mix of hit songs, remixes, alternate takes of album tracks, B-sides, and live recordings.\nContents\nAll tracks on Sucking in the Seventies'', except \"Shattered\" and \"Everything Is Turning to Gold\" were mixed or edited specifically for this release. The album includes an otherwise unreleased live version of \"When the Whip Comes Down\", which was recorded during the band's 1978 tour in Detroit.\n\"If I Was a Dancer (Dance Pt. 2)\" is a longer and different mix, containing different lyrics from \"Dance (Pt. 1)\", which is the opening track on Emotional Rescue (1980). The compilation album does not include \"Miss You\", which was The Rolling Stones' only number-one hit during this period.\nRelease and reception\n|rev2 = ''Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s\n|rev2Score = C+\n| rev8 = Tom Hull – on the Web\n| rev8Score = B+ ()\n}}\nReleased in the spring of 1981, as Tattoo You was nearing its completion, Sucking in the Seventies reached #15 in the U.S., going gold, but failed to chart in the UK.\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes:\nIn 2005, the album was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records.\nTrack listing\nAll songs by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted.\nSide one\n#\"Shattered\" – 3:46\n#*From Some Girls (1978)\n#\"Everything Is Turning to Gold\" (Jagger, Richards, Ronnie Wood) – 4:06\n#*B-side to \"Shattered\"\n#\"Hot Stuff\" – 3:30\n#*Edited version from Black and Blue (1976)\n#\"Time Waits for No One\" – 4:25\n#*Edited version from It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (1974)\n#\"Fool to Cry\" – 4:07\n#*Edited version from Black and Blue (1976)\nSide two\n#\"Mannish Boy\" (Ellas McDaniel, Mel London, McKinley Morganfield) – 4:38\n#*Edited version from Love You Live (1977)\n#\"When the Whip Comes Down\" (Live version) – 4:35\n#*Recorded live in Detroit on 6 July 1978\n#\"If I Was a Dancer (Dance Pt. 2)\" (Jagger, Richards, Wood) – 5:50\n#*Previously unreleased, from the Emotional Rescue sessions (1980)\n#\"Crazy Mama\" – 4:06\n#*Edited version from Black and Blue (1976)\n#\"Beast of Burden\" – 3:27\n#*Edited version from Some Girls (1978)\nCharts\nAlbum\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Year\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"left\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|1981\n|align=\"left\"|Billboard'' Pop Albums\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Year\n!align=\"left\"|Single\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"left\"|Position\n|-\n|!align=\"left\"|1981\n|align=\"left\"|\"If I Was a Dancer (Dance Pt.2)\"\n|align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock Tracks\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
