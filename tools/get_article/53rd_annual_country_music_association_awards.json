The ceremony recognizes some of the best country music released during the eligibility period. Carrie Underwood hosted the event with special guest hosts Reba McEntire and Dolly Parton, celebrating legendary women in country music.\nBackground\n\"In addition to awarding the year's best and brightest in the genre, the 53rd Annual CMA Awards will celebrate the legacy of women within country music, and we couldn't think of a more dynamic group of women to host the show.\" said CMA CEO Sarah Trahern. For the first time in CMA history, women were nominated in every category, except Male Vocalist of the Year. However, when all was said and done, the sole female Entertainer of the Year nominee, Carrie Underwood, lost the top honor to Garth Brooks; upsetting fans and leading to Garth Brooks stepping down from the category the following year.\nWinners and nominees\nThe CMA Awards nominees were announced live on Good Morning America by Jimmie Allen, Ashley McBryde, Midland and Morgan Wallen. For the 53rd CMA Awards, an artist must have released work in the eligibility period which ran from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. On November 6, 2019, Kris Kristofferson was revealed to be the recipient of the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award.\nWinners were denoted in Bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85;\" width=\"50%\" |Entertainer of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85;\" width=\"50%\" |Album of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Garth Brooks\n**Eric Church\n**Chris Stapleton\n**Carrie Underwood\n**Keith Urban\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Girl — Maren Morris'\n**Center Point Road — Thomas Rhett\n**Cry Pretty — Carrie Underwood\n**Dan + Shay — Dan + Shay\n**Desperate Man — Eric Church\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Male Vocalist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Female Vocalist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Luke Combs\n**Dierks Bentley\n**Thomas Rhett\n**Chris Stapleton\n**Keith Urban\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*Kacey Musgraves\n**Kelsea Ballerini\n**Miranda Lambert\n**Maren Morris\n**Carrie Underwood\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Vocal Group of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Vocal Duo of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Old Dominion\n**Lady Antebellum\n**Little Big Town\n**Midland\n**Zac Brown Band\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*Dan + Shay\n**Brooks & Dunn\n**Brothers Osborne\n**Florida Georgia Line\n**Maddie & Tae\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Single of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Song of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''\"God's Country\" — Blake Shelton\n**\"Burning Man\" — Dierks Bentley and Brothers Osborne\n**\"Girl\" — Maren Morris\n**\"Millionaire\" — Chris Stapleton\n**\"Speechless\" — Dan + Shay\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*\"Beautiful Crazy\" — Luke Combs, Wyatt B.
