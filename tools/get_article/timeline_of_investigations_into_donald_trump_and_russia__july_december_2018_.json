He says Papadopoulos agreed to the fine, but has not been very cooperative and only volunteered information when confronted with evidence.\n** In an impromptu exchange with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump praises Manafort and attacks his prosecution and the Mueller investigation.
