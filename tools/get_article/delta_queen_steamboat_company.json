The name was changed in 1973 to Delta Queen Steamboat Company.\nHistory\nThe company was started in 1890 by Gordon C. Greene with Henry K. Bedford. When Gordon died in 1927 his sons: Christopher Becker Greene, Henry Wilkins Greene, and Thomas R. Greene ran the company. In 1969, a charter airline, Overseas National Airways (ONA) bought the company and changed its name in 1973 to \"Delta Queen Steamboat Company\".
