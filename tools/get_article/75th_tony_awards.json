The ceremony was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, with Ariana DeBose serving as host of the main ceremony, and Darren Criss and Julianne Hough co-hosting a streaming pre-show.\nThe most-awarded productions of the season were the new play The Lehman Trilogy, which won five awards, including Best Play, and the revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical Company, which also won five awards, including Best Revival of a Musical. The Pulitzer Prize-winning musical A Strange Loop was the most-nominated show of the season, with 11 nominations, and won Best Musical, becoming the first Best Musical winner to win only two awards total since 42nd Street (1981).\nWith her nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical in A Strange Loop, L Morgan Lee became the first openly transgender person to be nominated for a Tony. Additionally, with her win as a lead producer of A Strange Loop, Jennifer Hudson became the 17th person to win the EGOT in their entertainment career.\nCeremony information\nhosted the ceremony.]]\nReturning to its usual June scheduling, the ceremony's telecast was split between Paramount+ and CBS. Paramount+ streamed an hour-long pre-show, The Tony Awards: Act One, which was hosted by Darren Criss and Julianne Hough and featured \"special performances\" and the presentation of selected awards. It was followed by the main ceremony telecast on CBS and Paramount+, which was hosted by Ariana DeBose. For the first time, the ceremony was televised live nationally.\nEligibility\nThe Tony Awards eligibility cut-off date for the 2021–22 season was May 4, 2022 for all Broadway productions which meet all other eligibility requirements. Nominations for the 2022 Tony Awards were announced by Adrienne Warren and Joshua Henry on May 9, 2022. They were initially going to be announced on May 3, but were extended a week to accommodate possible COVID-19 outbreaks. A revival of West Side Story that opened on February 20, 2020 was considered ineligible for the 74th Tony Awards because too few nominators and voters had seen it before Broadway shut down on March 12, 2020 due to the pandemic, and it did not resume when Broadway reopened in September 2021.\n34 shows were eligible.

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the program received six positive and two negative reviews, for an approval rating of 75%.\nIn Variety, Gordon Cox praised the opening number of the CBS telecast and DeBose's performance as host therein, singling out the performance as \"hip and queer and sexy, and it satisfied the old-school avids as much as it made Broadway look like a place the cool kids might want to check out, too\". Jennifer Vanasco of NPR also praised DeBose, writing \"Let Ariana DeBose host everything [...] She was funny and playful, strutting into the audience and sitting on Andrew Garfield's lap. She was poignant, coming to tears as she talked about her theater teacher mentor. She was honest, gently commenting on the racial disparities in the theater industry\". Writing for the Associated Press, Jocelyn Noveck called the telecast \"exuberant\" and said that it showed \"Broadway is back, with verve and creativity, and it is here to stay. It just needs even more people filling the seats\".\nJohnny Oleksinski of the New York Post panned the show, describing it as \"low-energy, poorly put-on\", writing that DeBose's \"songs and banter were forced and unfunny\", and heavily criticizing the ceremony's tribute to Stephen Sondheim, which he deemed \"far too modest [...] a total afterthought\".\nRatings\nThe CBS telecast was watched by 3.86 million viewers in the United States, marking a 39% increase from the previous year's ceremony, the lowest-rated Tony Awards broadcast since viewership was measured. However, when compared to the 73rd Tony Awards in 2019, which were the last one before the 75th to run three hours and the last one before the COVID-19 pandemic, viewership declined 29% between 2019 and 2022.\nIn Memoriam\nActor Billy Porter Performed On the Street Where You Live From The musical My Fair Lady.\n*Sidney Poitier\n*Jay Binder\n*Leslie Bricusse\n*Eugene Osborne Smith\n*Leonard Soloway\n*Sally Kellerman\n*Alan Hall\n*Maurice Murphy\n*Alvin Deutsch\n*Gary McAvay\n*Rae Allen\n*William Hurt\n*Tony Walton\n*Arlene Dahl\n*Vinny Sainato\n*Marilyn Bergman\n*Donald Pippin\n*Jonathan Reynolds\n*Terry Teachout\n*Bruce Pomahac\n*Peter Scolari\n*Hollis Resnik\n*Harvey Evans\n*Craig Jacobs\n*Barbara Maier Gustern\n*Robert Morse\n*Joan Didion\n*Stephen Sondheim\nSee also\n* Drama Desk Awards\n* 2022 Laurence Olivier Awards – equivalent awards for West End theatre productions\n* Obie Award\n* New York Drama Critics' Circle\n* Theatre World Award\n* Lucille Lortel Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
