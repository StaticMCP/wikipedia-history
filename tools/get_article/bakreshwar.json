Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station of West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited and Bakreswar Thermal Power Plant Township are located some distance away from this town. The nearest railway station of Bakreshwar is Dubrajpur.\nEtymology\nThe word Bakreshwar comes from the name of Lord Shiva worshipped in the locality. Bakra (Vakra) means bent or curved. Ishwar means God. Mythologically it is said that in Satya Yuga during the marriage ceremony of Lakshmi and Narayan, Ashtavakra Muni (then known as Subrata Muni) was insulted by Indra. The muni was so enraged that he developed 8 cripples in his body (Ashtavakra Muni means a sage with 8 curved cripples, probably kyphoscoliotic). Ashtavakra Muni was blessed by lord Shiva here after many years of Tapashya (meditation). This place is also famous as one of the 51 Shakta pithas where there is a temple dedicated to Adi Shakti. This is a major pilgrimage spot for Hindus.\nGeography\n|  float=left|caption=Cities and towns in Suri Sadar subdivision of Birbhum  districtM: municipal city/ town, CT: census town, R: rural/ urban centre, B: Barrage.Owing to space constraints in the small map, the actual locations in a larger map may vary slightly\n|mark-coord1= | label-pos1=left|label1=Karidhya | numbered1=CT| mark-title1= Karidhya (CT)|label-color1=#800000 |label-size1=13| mark-size1=13|shape1=l-circle|shape-color1=#A40000|shape-outline1=white|label-offset-x1=2\n|mark-coord2= | label-pos2=left|label2=Kalipur | numbered2=CT| mark-title2= Kalipur, Birbhum (CT)|\n|mark-coord3= | label-pos3=left|label3= Ahmedpur | numbered3=CT| mark-title3= Ahmedpur, Birbhum (CT)|\n|mark-coord4= | label-pos4=left|label4= Rajnagar | numbered4=CT| mark-title4= Rajnagar, Birbhum (CT)|\n|mark-coord5= | label-pos5=right|label5=Suri |label-size5=14 | numbered5=M| mark-title5= Suri, Birbhum (M)|label-color5=#800000\n|mark-coord6= | label-pos6=left|label6=Sainthia | numbered6=M| mark-title6= Sainthia (M)|label-color6=#800000\n|mark-coord7= | label-pos7=right|label7=Dubrajpur | numbered7=M| mark-title7= Dubrajpur (M)|label-color7=#800000\n|mark-coord8= | label-pos8=top|label8= Mohammad Bazar| numbered8=R| mark-title8= Mohammad Bazar, Birbhum (R)|shape-color8=#A40000\n|mark-coord9= | label-pos9=right|label9= Lokpur| numbered9=R| mark-title9= Lokpur (R)|shape-color9=#A40000\n|mark-coord10= | label-pos10=left|label10= Chandrapur| numbered10=R| mark-title10= Chandrapur, Birbhum (R)|shape-color10=#A40000\n|mark-coord11= | label-pos11=right|label11= Panrui| numbered11=R| mark-title11= Panrui (R)|shape-color11=#A40000\n|mark-coord12= | label-pos12=right|label12= Khoyrasol| numbered12=R| mark-title12= Khoyrasol (R)|shape-color12=#A40000\n|mark-coord13= | label-pos13=right|label13= Kankartala| numbered13=R| mark-title13= Kankartala (R)|shape-color13=#A40000\n|mark-coord14= | label-pos14=right|label14= BTPP Township| numbered14=R| mark-title14= Bakreswar Thermal Power Plant Township (R)|shape-color14=#A40000\n|mark-coord15= | label-pos15=right|label15= Angar Garia| numbered15=R| mark-title15= Angar Garia (R)|shape-color15=#A40000\n|mark-coord16= | label-pos16=right|label16= Purandarpur| numbered16=R| mark-title16= Purandarpur (R)|shape-color16=#A40000\n|mark-coord17= | label-pos17=right|label17= Hetampur|numbered17=R| mark-title17= Hetampur (R)|shape-color17=#A40000\n|mark-coord18= | label-pos18=right|label18= Abinashpur|numbered18=R| mark-title18= Abinashpur (R)|shape-color18=#A40000\n|mark-coord19= | label-pos19=right|label19= Nakrakonda|numbered19=R| mark-title19= Nakrakonda (R)|shape-color19=#A40000\n|mark-coord20= | label-pos20=right|label20= Bara Chaturi|numbered20=R| mark-title20= Bara Chaturi (R)|shape-color20=#A40000\n|mark-coord21= | label-pos21=right|label21= Deucha|numbered21=R| mark-title21= Deucha (R)|shape-color21=#A40000\n|mark-coord22= | label-pos22=right|label22= Bakreshwar|numbered22=R| mark-title22= Bakreshwar (R)|shape-color22=black| label-size22=13|label-color22=black\n|mark-coord23= | label-pos23=top|label23= Patharchapuri|numbered23=R| mark-title23= Patharchapuri (R)|shape-color23=#A40000\n|mark-coord24= | label-pos24=right|label24= Tilpara |labela24=Barrage| numbered24=B| mark-title24= Mayurakshi River#Tilpara Barrage (B)|shape-color24=#0048BA\n|mark-coord25=| label25=Mayurakshi |labela25=River| label-color25 = #77A1CB| label-angle25=48| label-pos25=top| label-size25=10| mark-size25=0| mark-title25 =none\n|mark-coord26=| label26=Bakreshwar|labela26= River| label-color26 = #77A1CB| label-angle26=2| label-pos26=top| label-size26=10| mark-size26=0| mark-title26 =none\n|mark-coord27=| label27=Ajay River| label-color27 = #77A1CB| label-angle27=2| label-pos27=top| label-size27=10| mark-size27=0| mark-title27 =none}}\nLocation\nBakreshwar is located at .
