She was queen consort of Joseon from 1623 until her death in 1636.\nBiography\nLady Han was born on 6 August 1594 into the Cheongju Han clan to Han Jun-gyeom and his wife, Lady Hwang of the Changwon Hwang clan, as their youngest child of five children. Her parents were 5th cousins as they shared Grand Prince Hyoryeong as their 4th great-grandfather.\nHer mother later died a few days after her birth, but Lady Han was born and raised in the town of Wonju until she married.\nIn 1610, she married Prince Neungyang (), Injo of Joseon, when she was 17 and was known as \"Princess Consort Cheongseong\" (). Princess Cheongseong gave birth to Crown Prince Sohyeon in 1612, Grand Prince Bongrim (later known as King Hyojong) in 1619, and Grand Prince Inpyeong in 1622.\nOn 24 April 1623, she became the queen consort upon her husband's ascension to the throne. The Queen gave birth to a fourth son, Prince Yongseong, in 1624, her first daughter in 1626, and a fifth son in 1629, but both died prematurely.\nOn 14 October 1635, she gave birth to a prince, her sixth son, who died later on 22 December 1635. A month later on 6 January 1636, the Queen died at the age of 41 in Changgyeonggung as she was suffering from postpartum illness.\nHer husband, King Injo wanted to bestow Myeongheon () as her posthumous title, but Kim Sang-heon persuaded the king to change the name into Inyeol. \"In\" () for benevolence and \"Yeol\" () for pillar.\nKing Injo had decided to have his own tomb be made next to the queen in Jangneung. After the king died, their son, King Hyojong granted his wish and buried his father there. Jangneung was originally located in Uncheon-ri, Paju, but when snakes and scorpions began to live and infest around the tomb, King Yeongjo moved the tomb to Galhyeon-ri, Paju, Gyeonggi Province.\nFamily\n*Father - Han Jun-gyeom (; 1557–1627)\n* Mother\n** Biological - Internal Princess Consort Hoesan of the Changwon Hwang clan (; 1561–1594)\n** Step - Yi Kang-ah-ji (), Lady Yi of the Jeonju Yi clan (1583–?)\nSiblings\n* Older sister - Lady Han (; 1577–?)\n*Older brother - Han So-il (; 1584–1608)\n*Older sister - Lady Han (; 1588–1637); died during the Manchu war\n*Older sister - Lady Han (; 1590–1637); died during the Manchu War\n*Younger brother - Han Hoe-il (; ?–1642)\n*Younger half-sister - Lady Han (; 1592–?)\n*Younger half-sister - Princess Consort Han of the Cheongju Han clan (; 1596–1637); died during the Manchu war\n*Husband - Injo of Joseon (; 7 December 1595 – 17 June 1649)\n** Mother-in-law - Queen Inheon of the Neungseong Gu clan (; 17 April 1578 – 14 January 1626)\n** Father-in-law - Wonjong of Joseon (; 2 August 1580 – 29 December 1619)\nIssue\n#Son - Yi Wang, Crown Prince Sohyeon (; 5 February 1612 – 21 May 1645)\n##Daughter-in-law - Crown Princess Minhoe of the Geumcheon Kang clan (; 1611 – 30 April 1646)\n#Son - Yi Ho, King Hyojong (; 3 July 1619 – 23 June 1659)\n##Daughter-in-law - Queen Inseon of the Deoksu Jang clan (; 9 February 1619 – 19 March 1674)\n#Son - Yi Yo, Grand Prince Inpyeong (; 10 December 1622 – 13 May 1658)\n##Daughter-in-law - Princess Consort Bokcheon of the Dongbok Oh clan (; 22 April 1622 – 6 August 1658)\n#Son - Yi Gon, Grand Prince Yongseong (; 24 October 1624 – 22 December 1629)\n#Unnamed daughter (1626–1626)\n#Unnamed son (1629–1629)\n#Unnamed son (12 January 1636 – 16 January 1636)\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Seo Woo-rim in the 1981 KBS1 TV Series Daemyeong.\n*Portrayed by Kim Do-yeon in the 1986–1987 MBC TV series Namhansanseong Fortress\n*Portrayed by Lee Seung-ha in the 2015 MBC TV series Splendid Politics\nReferences\n}}\n}}"
