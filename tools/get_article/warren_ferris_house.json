It was built in 1894 by Warren Ferris. It is a two and one-half story tall wood-framed building on a cut-stone foundation, in the Queen Anne style. The building is characterized by irregular massing, as it is divided into four distinct sections, decreasing in size from front to rear. There is also a contemporary carriage house also constructed in 1894.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.\nReferences"
