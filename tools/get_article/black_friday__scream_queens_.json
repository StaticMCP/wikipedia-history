LaToya Ferguson from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, citing \"But “Black Friday” is also probably the last bit of “fun” these characters will have before the finale, so it’s at least a good thing that this is a very funny episode and, for the first time all season, no one is the weak link.\" Sarene Leeds from The Wall Street Journal stated that \"I didn’t think it was possible for “Scream Queens” to stretch itself any thinner in its debut season, but congratulations, Ryan Murphy, you’ve done it again.\" Patrick Sproull of the Den of Geek said \"Black Friday tried to deliver some solid development and teasing in the B-plot alongside the fluffy main action.\" IGN's Amber Dowling gave the episode 8.0 out of 10, stating \"The series continued to cleverly play with common horror tropes. By the closing moments it was Jamie Lee Curtis who stood out most, however, killing it in a way that only she can.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
