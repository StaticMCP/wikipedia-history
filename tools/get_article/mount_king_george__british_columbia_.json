The mountain is the highest point of The Royal Group, a subset of the Rockies, which includes Mount Queen Mary, Mount Princess Mary, Mount Prince George, Mount Prince Albert, Mount Prince Henry, Mount Prince John, and Mount Prince Edward. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Joffre,  to the east. Mount King George is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.\nHistory\nThe mountain was named in 1917 by the Interprovincial Boundary Survey after King George V (1865–1936).\nThe name was officially adopted 23 February 1918.\nThe first ascent of Mount King George was made 10 August 1919 by Val Fynn with Rudolph Aemmer as guide. Owing in part to the remoteness of the peak and the difficulty of the first ascent, the second ascent of the mountain was not made until 1970 by Gerry Brown, William Hurst, and John Carter.\nClimbing\nEstablished climbing routes on Mount King George:\n* East Face-North Ridge  (1919 route of the first ascent)\n* Southeast Ridge  (1970 route of the second ascent)\n* Southwest Face-West Ridge (1971 route of the third ascent by D. Hurrell, R. Mills)\n* Congdon-McNab Coulior (FA 1980 by Dwayne Congdon, Dave McNab)\n* East Face (FA 1984 by F. Campbell, R. Varnam, K. Nagy)\n* Elzinga-Welsted  (FA 2012 by Jim Elzinga, Ian Welsted)\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount King George is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. This climate supports the King George Glacier on the eastern slope of the mountain. Temperatures can drop below −20&nbsp;°C with wind chill factors below −30&nbsp;°C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Palliser River. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for climbing are July through September, with late summer being best for crossing the Palliser River.\nSee also\n}}\n* Geography of British Columbia\n* Geology of British Columbia\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Mount King George photo: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/7129939@N02/26864597159/in/photolist-GVW5MD-os2pjp-o8LT33-aPnuKK-WXffAK-eWeHYe-pz7A6Q-hYztZo-pvVRHf-pdDVnD-7JXaXk-J49Aoz-pbNh9z-ku68a6-2cCTrUu-27AQLfg-dRBiE8-VUxHNN-brjiYY-789j2B-paFZva-paY9WC-e28KbG-pb3Sgu-UEGnzu-ru4kYh-8P1EfY-29DUCk-b6pbu8-2erPtS-7RSW2S-dVbtMV-dVtiYn-V9pN4Q-VccoT9-fMXeDh-VH59bs-eDozA4-78cxz7-fMEK4e-Vzc68c-G9eZJy-pbx6Xs-5c3Kn1-S93zBp-ppYWxh-59qLz9-26V5Bv4-fd2vYZ-788G43 Flickr]\n* Mount King George: [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-6081430/Canada/British%20Columbia/Mount%20King%20George weather forecast]\n* BC Parks: [http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/height/ Height of the Rockies Provincial Park]"
