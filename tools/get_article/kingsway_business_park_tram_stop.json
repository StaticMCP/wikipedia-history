It is located in Firgrove, on the northeastern side of Kingsway Business Park in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, between the Milnrow and Newbold stops. It opened as part of Phase 3a of the system's expansion, on 28 February 2013.\nHistory\nFollowing the rejection of the Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund the station had an unknown future being unfunded by the rest of the 3A and 3B program with suggestions private contributions would be required for construction to proceed.\nIn March 2011 it was proposed to cancel the plans for Drake Street Metrolink station for being too close to Rochdale Station Metrolink stop and generate efficiency savings while it was also noted a significant gap in coverage existed around Kingsway which could lead to the construction of Kingsway Business Park after all. On 8 July 2011 the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee gave approval of the station after Rochdale Council pledged £2.5m towards the stop.\nServices\nKingsway Business Park is located on the Oldham & Rochdale Line with trams towards Manchester city centre and Rochdale Town Centre.\nServices are mostly every 12 minutes on all routes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/kingsway-business-park-tram Metrolink stop information]\n*[https://tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/kingsway-business-park-tram/local-map Kingsway Business Park area map]"
