It was founded by David B Leblang, Paul Levine, David Jabs and others on January 11, 1990.\nSome of the Atria developers had worked on an earlier system: DSEE (Domain Software Engineering Environment) from Apollo Computer. After Hewlett-Packard bought Apollo Computer in 1989, they left to form Atria.\nAtria later merged with Pure Software to form Pure Atria. That firm merged with Rational Software, which was purchased by\nIBM in 2003. IBM continues to develop and market ClearCase.\nReferences"
