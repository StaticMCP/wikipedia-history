Chambers and Kelly can not be too strongly emphasized as components of this brilliant group, carrying over their assets to the Curtis session as if shifting boxes from one side of a garage to another\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by King Curtis except where noted\n# \"Da-Duh-Dah\" – 5:11\n# \"Have You Heard?\" (Curtis, Herman Foster) – 10:23\n# \"Willow Weep for Me\" (Ann Ronell) – 5:24\n# \"Little Brother Soul\" – 8:35\n# \"In a Funky Groove\" – 10:49\nPersonnel\nPerformance\n*King Curtis – tenor saxophone\n*Little Brother – trumpet (tracks 1-3 & 5)\n*Wynton Kelly – piano\n*Paul Chambers – bass\n*Oliver Jackson – drums\nProduction\n* The Sound of America – producer\n* Rudy Van Gelder – engineer\nReferences"
