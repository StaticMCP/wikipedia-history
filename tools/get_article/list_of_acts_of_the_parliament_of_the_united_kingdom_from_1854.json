For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n17 & 18 Vict.\nThe second session of the 16th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 31 January 1854 until 12 August 1854.\nPublic general acts\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for the better Management and Control of Highways in South Wales.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|   and the Act of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Victoria, Chapter Fifty-four.|note4= }}\n|\n| or the Prize (Russia) Act 1854|public|18|02-06-1854|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for the Encouragement of Seamen and the more effectual Manning of Her Majesty's Navy during the present War.|note4= }}\n| or the Navy Pay and Prize Act 1854|public|19|02-06-1854|archived=n|An Act for facilitating the Payment of Her Majesty's Navy, and the Payment and Distribution of Prize, Bounty, Salvage, and other Monies to and amongst the Officers and Crews of Her Majesty's Ships and Vessels of War;
