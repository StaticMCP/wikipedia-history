The organisation has been recognised as a British flagship clan since its founding. It was operated by 4K UK Ltd and managed by Toby Aldridge. 4K is particularly known for its Warcraft III team, which won the ESL WC3L Series on four occasions. In late 2007, the section that signed players such as Warcraft III player, Grubby Schenkhuizen and Yoan \"ToD\" Merlo was dissolved due to financial problems.\nHistory\nEstablished in 1997, 4Kings was formed as Quake 1 clan playing in the QuakeWorld client.\nUnder the management of \"Zommy\" the clan grew expanding into new games such as Quake III, Warcraft III,  Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Counter-Strike be one of the most recognised esports teams in the world at the time.\nAfter being sponsored by processor manufacturer Intel for six years, 4Kings gained a new main sponsor in 2008 with Packard Bell. This marked a shift in focus to Britain.\nIn July 2008, the signing of a Finnish Counter-Strike team signalled the clan's return to the global market, and was later followed by a successful Dutch Counter-Strike:Source team joining 4Kings. However, setbacks followed, with Packard Bell withdrawing their sponsorship.\nIncreasing numbers of teams fell apart or left the clan, leading to management being completely replaced in 2009. After this the Swede Andreas \"Fisk\" Johansson took responsibility for the former tranditional clan. A new start was planned by Fisk, with the aim of building on previous successes, though the clan has been inactive since the end of 2013, and the website four-kings.com no longer in operation.\nThe team had players competing in Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Quake III, Warcraft III, Unreal Tournament, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress 2 and Shootmania. Across its history 4Kings was managed by members including Philip Wride, as well as Jason Potter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://x.com/4_Kings_Esports?t=n3S_26k_KkZTf_LOqiHPKQ&s=09 4 Kings]"
