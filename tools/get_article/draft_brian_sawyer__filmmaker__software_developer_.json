S0091 (talk) 17:27, 11 September 2025 (UTC)}}\n----\nBrian Sawyer is an American software developer, screenwriter, producer, and director known for creating VP-Expert, a pioneering expert system shell, co-authoring technical books on visual programming tools, and his extensive work in television and film writing, particularly in the holiday and mystery genres.\nEarly career and software development\nSawyer began his career during the personal computing revolution of the 1980s, focusing on artificial intelligence and expert systems technology. He developed VP-Expert, an expert system shell published by Paperback Software that became the best-selling product of its kind for personal computers.\nVP-Expert\nVP-Expert, created by Sawyer, was a rule-based expert system development tool that allowed users to build knowledge-based applications without extensive programming expertise. The software featured:\n* Backward chaining for goal-driven reasoning\n* IF-THEN rule structures for knowledge representation\n* An explanation facility to make decision processes transparent\n* User-friendly interface accessible to non-programmers\nBy 1990, VP-Expert had sold over 120,000 copies worldwide and was used by major organizations including DuPont, Kodak, and the Wharton School of Business. The software found applications across diverse fields including business, finance, engineering, healthcare, and education.\nSawyer's work on VP-Expert helped democratize artificial intelligence tools, making expert system creation accessible to businesses and researchers with limited programming backgrounds. One notable application was \"Wines on Disk,\" a wine recommendation system developed by Anthony Dias Blue using the VP-Expert framework.\nObjectVision collaboration\nIn 1990, Sawyer co-authored \"ObjectVision: A Graphical Programming Tool for Object-oriented Applications\" with management consultant Paul Harmon. The book documented ObjectVision, a forms-based programming language and environment for Windows 3.x developed by Borland. ObjectVision used decision trees rather than traditional programming languages, making application development accessible to non-programmers and supporting various database formats including Paradox, dBASE, and BTrieve.\nEarly game development\nPrior to his expert system work, Sawyer developed \"Dungeon\" (1979), an early computer role-playing game that has been recognized by gaming historians for its technical innovations and influence on the genre.\nFilm and television career\nSawyer transitioned into screenwriting and filmmaking, establishing himself as both a writer and director. His work spans short films, television movies, and series, with particular recognition in holiday and mystery genres.\nEarly filmmaking success\nIn 2000, Sawyer wrote and directed \"Tex, the Passive-Aggressive Gunslinger,\" a 10-minute comedy short film starring Bob Balaban and Charles Rocket. The film achieved significant recognition:\nSelected for the Palm Springs International ShortFest in 2000\nBroadcast on the Independent Film Channel (IFC)\nReceived critical acclaim with an IMDb rating of 7.5/10 based on 91 votes\nPraised by critics as \"the best short comedy film since 'The Dove'\"\nReceived a film festival award nomination\nTelevision writing career\nSawyer has established himself as a prolific television writer, with over 40 writing credits, 12 producing credits, and 3 directing credits.
