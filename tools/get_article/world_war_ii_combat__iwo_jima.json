In each mission, the player must complete a number of objectives to progress. The player is equipped with four weapons including a pistol, a secondary firearm, an explosive weapon and a knife (which can be upgraded to a flamethrower in some missions). Restocking on bullets requires the player to search bodies and places as well as occasional ammunition pickups. The player can also try to collect three hidden \"Souvenirs\" in every mission, which if collected will allow the player to access trivial history and war documentary footage. The Xbox version supports up to four players in split screen mode.\nDevelopment\nThe game's composer, Alex Guilbert, also acted as an audio director and provided voice acting for the title, receiving top billing in the game's credits.\nReception\n| MC_XBOX = 25/100\n| 1UP_PC = D−\n| GSpot_PC = 2/10\n| GSpot_XBOX = 2/10\n| IGN_PC = 3/10\n| IGN_XBOX = 3/10\n| OXM_XBOX = 2/10\n| PCGUS_PC = 18%\n}}\nLike its predecessor, World War II Combat: Road to Berlin, it received negative reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It suffered from many of the same problems of the first game.\nSee also\n*World War II Combat: Road to Berlin\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
