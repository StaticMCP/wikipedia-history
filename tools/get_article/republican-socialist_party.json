PRS member René Viviani was the first French Minister of Labour (Ministre du Travail et de la Prévoyance sociale) from October 1906 until July 1909).\nThe PRS was weakened by an ideological contradiction between socialism and reformism in an era where the political divide was very sharp. It also suffered from an organizational division between those favouring a united and structured party like the SFIO or an independent party with independent personalities. The party was merged into the Socialist Republican Union (USR) in 1934, as were two other parties issued from the right wing of the SFIO, the French Socialist Party (PSF) and the Socialist Party of France – Jean Jaurès Union (PSdF).\nIn 1945, an attempt failed to recreate it within the Rally of Left Republicans. Several PRS members headed French cabinets, including Viviani, Aristide Briand, Paul Painlevé, Alexandre Millerand and Joseph Paul-Boncour.\nBibliography\n* Jean-Thomas Nordmann (1974).
