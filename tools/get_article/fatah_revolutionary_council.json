It consists of approximately 80 members elected from a pool of approximately 1400 party members including civil and military personalities during the Fatah General Congress, from whom another 21 members are also elected for Fatah’s Central Committee. Candidates may only be nominated if they're over the age of 33, and have been full party members for 15 years uninterrupted.\nSessions\nAccording to the internal regulations of the Fatah movement, the Revolutionary Council must meet periodically every three months, where:\na) the Secretary-General invites the members to the meeting or,\nb) written letter is written by two-thirds of the members to call for a session or,\nc) in the event of a request by the Central Committee\nResponsibilities\nThe Fatah Revolutionary Council is tasked with a variety of responsibilities, the most notable of which are to supervise the work of the Central Committee and to approve internal policies and their interpretation. It also replaces vacancies on the Central Committee in the event of death, withdrawal, or expulsion. It also takes on the responsibility of dismissing or freezing members' memberships, whether in the Central Committee or any of the movement's apparatuses. The Revolutionary Council also works to implement Fatah's General Conference decisions, monitor the work of the Central Committee and the movement's conditions in the regions, and oversee the Fatah movement's military affairs, in addition to discussing the Central Committee's decisions and activities. It also interprets the texts of Fatah's internal regulations in accordance with the movement's regulations, elects the head of the movement's court and the members of its committees, and discusses the reports of the General Conference and Revolutionary Council committees.\nFatah's seventh Congress, held in Ramallah in December 2016, elected a new FRC and FCC. This was widely interpreted as Mahmoud Abbas' attempt to tighten his grip on the party by expelling his opponent Mohammed Dahlan and marginalising the popular Fatah figure Marwan Barghouti.\nMembership\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
