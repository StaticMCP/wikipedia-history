It was originally established in 1941 under the Bureau of Ordnance as the Naval Ammunition Depot for the production, testing, and storage of ordnance under the first supplemental Defense Appropriation Act. The base is named after William M. Crane. The base is the third largest naval installation in the world by geographic area and employs approximately 3,300 people. The closest community is the small town of Crane, which lies adjacent to the northwest corner of the facility.\nOperations\nWith an increasing demand in the 1990s and 2000s by the US military for bases to support multiple functions rather than being sole-purpose installations, NSA Crane has taken on a broad variety of development and support operations. These include expeditionary warfare systems, fleet maintenance, and modernization, radar, power systems, strategic systems, small arms, surface and airborne electronic warfare, night vision systems, and undersea warfare systems. NSA Crane is also involved in systems development for the upcoming DD(X) class of destroyer for the U.S. Navy and the current Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).\nDiagram showing Crane focus areas\nOperations at NSWC Crane are divided into three distinct focus areas: Strategic Missions, Electronic Warfare, and Expeditionary Warfare.\nStrategic missions\n\"Deter – Defend – Defeat\"\n''The Strategic Missions Focus Area encompasses the full range of DoD activities that alter an adversary's will and ability to attack the United States and its interests''.\n;Critical Infrastructure Protection\nNSWC Crane is the acquisition engineering & technical support agent for the Navy's Strategic Programs Office for the fielding of the Integrated Nuclear Weapons Security System.\n;Full Spectrum Radar Engineering Support\nNSWC Crane provides a broad range of systems engineering expertise for the sustainment and modernization of the Air Forces Ballistic Missile Early Warning Systems.\n;Flight Systems\nNSWC Crane supports systems engineering design, analysis, test, and evaluation of flight systems for strategic platforms.\n;Launcher Systems\nNSWC Crane provides product and subsystem engineering and logistics to the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs Strategic Weapons System and Attack Weapon Control System.\n;Modeling and Simulation\nThe Flight Systems Division (Code GXM) models and simulates electronic components and subsystems of the Navy's Strategic Weapons System including the Attack Weapon Control System and Counter Measurement System.

Measured shock profiles from actual weapons are used with the simulator to test the survivability of batteries, electrical connections, and optical components. This division also uses a six-axis platform that simulates sea states for testing auto tracker software. The Electro-Optic Technology Division uses modeling tools in a number of applications. Examples include using a variety of commercially available tools to do the following:\n* evaluate the performance of Infrared systems, to accurately predict atmospheric effects on specific optical/electromagnetic wavelengths\n* predict turbulence effects on optical transmission and imaging at different altitudes\n* simulate a realistic system-level minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) test result\n* model laser beam propagation through the atmosphere over the distance to a target\n* calculate spatial frequencies based upon range, scene, and sensor\n* predict electro-optical sensors and I2 tubes Minimum Resolvable Contrast (MRC)\n* predict the Contrast Threshold Function (CTF) of a human interacting with an imaging system in order to predict task range performance\n* predict an imaging system modulation transfer function (MTF)\n* predict electrooptical weapon and navigation systems performance\n* model laser-based active imager performance\n* predict mission effectiveness versus sensor system versus environmental conditions\n* use Concept Modeling tools to analyze warfighter tasks to provide improved sensors, interfaces, communications, and testing methods\nAdditional modeling capabilities within the Special Missions Focus Area use common modeling tools (i.e., Finite Element Analysis, MATLAB, COMSOL, etc.) as well as tools developed within the government to better understand electrooptic phenomena, warfighter technology applications, benefits, and trade spaces of new technologies, etc.\nHistory\nIn the late 1940s, an ammunition quality evaluation unit was added by the Bureau of Ordnance to expand its quality control system. As the complexity and sophistication of weapons increased in the 1950s and 1960s, Crane's activities, capabilities, and expertise expanded in scope under the newly formed Bureau of Weapons to include small arms, sonobuoy surveillance, microwave tubes, Polaris missiles, and other scientific and engineering support to the Bureau.\nChart showing the evolution of technical capabilities over time at CraneIn the 1960s, NSWC Crane came under the command of the newly established Naval Ordnance Systems Command and began providing technical support for weapons systems including logistics, in-service engineering, repair, overhaul, and design. In the 1970s, NSWC Crane's support began to include batteries, rotating components, electronic components, failure analysis, and standard hardware and new technologies related to night vision systems.\nIn 1974, NSWC Crane came under the Naval Sea Systems Command that was established from the merger of the Naval Ordnance Systems Command and Naval Ship Systems Command. Shortly after in 1975, Crane's name was changed to the Naval Weapons Support Center which more accurately reflected the true function of the installation.\nIn 1977, a major change occurred with the designation of the United States Army as the single-service manager of conventional ammunition. This resulted in the establishment of the tenant command, Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CAAA), which took over the loading, assembly, and storage of ammunition at the installation. CAAA and NSWC Crane's strong partnership continues today.\nIn 1992, NSWC Crane's name was changed to the Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center when the warfare centers were established under the related systems commands. Today, grown from its ordnance roots, NSWC Crane is recognized worldwide as a modern and sophisticated leader in diverse and highly technical product lines.\nIn 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended to retain most existing operations at NSA Crane, with weapons and armaments research, development and acquisition, and test and evaluation, but moving gun/ammunition, combat system security, and energetic materials to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California. This BRAC change resulted in a net loss of 672 civilian jobs from the base.\nNSA Crane tenants\nNaval Support Activity Crane hosts a number of different commands and divisions. These are:\n* Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division\n* Crane Army Ammunition Activity provides munitions and energetics storage and distribution, and first strike and war reserve ordnance support for the United States Department of Defense.\n* Great Lakes Industrial Hygiene\n* Defense Automated Printing Service\n* Naval Criminal Investigative Service\n* Defense Commissary Agency Detachment Crane\n* Navy Exchange\n* Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services activity of the Defense Logistics Agency\n* Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC)\n* Explosive Ordnance Disposal\n* United States Coast Guard\n* United States Army Reserve\n* [http://www.crane.navy.mil/eeaa/JTAA/ Joint Test and Assessment Activity]\n* [http://www.crane.navy.mil/eeaa/ITTC/Index.html Joint Innovation and Technology Transition Center]\nGeography\nThe base is the third largest naval installation in the world, comprising approximately  of territory. Lake Greenwood, a  lake, is entirely encompassed by the base. White oak wood for reconstruction of  is harvested at this base from a grove of trees known as \"Constitution Grove\".\nSee also\n*Naval Surface Warfare Center\n*Time in Indiana\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://www.cnic.navy.mil/Regions/cnrma/installations/nsa_crane/ Naval Support Activity Crane]\n*  - recorded inside NSWC Crane"
