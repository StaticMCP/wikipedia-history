Crafted by local stone mason Frank Scheirer at a cost of $2,200, the monument incorporates a 7-foot-tall statue of an early 20th-century fireman with a handlebar mustache, pointed fire hat, fire coat, and boots, holding a young girl in both arms.\nArthur Scranton, a member of the Vigilant Fire Company, was responsible for the erection of the monument, according to the monument's dedication plaque.\nThis monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\nBurials\nInitially planned as a burial site for firemen who had faced financial hardships or were without family at their respective times of death, the place of the monument was expanded to allow for the burial of career and volunteer firemen. Three firemen who are interred here are: Harry J. Henritzy. Marcus Hessman, and Theodore Hoffman.\nGallery\nFile:Vigilant Fire Company Firemen's Monument 04.JPG|Tombs of firemen\nFile:Vigilant Fire Company Firemen's Tomb 01.JPG|Tomb of Harry J.
