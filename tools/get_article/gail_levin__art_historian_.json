She is a specialist in the work of Edward Hopper, feminist art, abstract expressionism, Eastern European Jewish influences on modernist art  and American modernist art. Levin served as the first curator of the Hopper Collection at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\nEarly life and education\nLevin was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia and graduated from Northside High School.\nLevin graduated from Simmons College in 1969 with a B.A. and from Tufts University with an M.A. in fine arts in 1970, and she received her PhD in art history in 1976 from Rutgers University.Levin, G.

Southern Cultures, 24(2), 125-136.\nArt career\nArtist\nLevin is also an artist who has shown photographs, photo collages, and collages with a solo show at the National Association of Women Artists at its New York Gallery in the spring of 2014. The show included her collage memoir, \"On NOT Becoming An Artist,\" which tells her life in art in pictorial form, beginning with her mother teaching her to paint and then her parents forbidding her to become an artist.\nLevin has also published books with her photographs, including \"Hopper's Places\", in which she identified all of the paintings by Edward Hopper and then located the actual sites and photographed them. In her 1985 review of a related show organized by Levin, Vivien Raynor wrote in the New York Times: \"''Hopper's Places,'' a show that is as much about its guest curator, Gail Levin, as about its subject....Miss Levin has been building a small reputation as a photographer, and it is partly in this capacity that she now contemplates her subject....Miss Levin's deductions are invariably enlightening, as when she infers that Hopper's tendency to elongate structures was a reflection of his great height.\" In this book, Levin also analyzes the changes Hopper made in his paintings. Since she began this conceptual art project in the 1970s, several other photographers have emulated her project.\nCurator\nAt the Whitney Museum of American Art, Levin was the curator of several landmark touring exhibitions, including Edward Hopper: Prints and Illustrations (1979) and Edward Hopper: The Art and The Artist (1980); Synchromism and American Color Abstraction, 1910-1925 (1978); and co-curator with Robert Hobbs of Abstract Expressionism: The Formative Years (1978).\nLevin continues to organize exhibitions for museums internationally.\nPublications\n}}\nLevin is the author of \"Edward Hopper: A Catalogue Raisonne.\" She has published books with her photographs, including \"Hopper's Places\" and \"Marsden Hartley in Bavaria.\" She wrote the foreword to \"The Lining of Our Souls: Excursion into Selected Paintings by Edward Hopper\" by Rolando Pérez (Cuban poet).\nLevin is the author of three biographies: \"Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography,\" \"Becoming Judy Chicago: A Biography of the Artist\" and \"Lee Krasner A Biography.\" Levin also spearheaded a recent revival of the artist Theresa Bernstein (1890-2002) by producing and editing \"Theresa Bernstein: A Century in Art,\" a monograph with essays by herself, four of her graduate students, and two other scholars, which accompanies a touring exhibition and a comprehensive research website.\nSelected works\n* Lee Krasner: A Biography (2011)\n*Ethics and the Visual Arts, co-edited with Elaine A.
