      "text": "# Wartislaw Swantibor\n\nWartislaw II Swantibor, also known as Wartislaw the Younger or Wartislaw Swantiboritz (d. 1196) was a member of a cadet line of the House of Griffins, who ruled the Duchy of Pomerania.  Wartislaw II was Castellan of Szczecin.  He is the only known son of Swantibor I, a Pomeranian prince about whom very little is known.\nIn the early 1170s, a Danish army under King Valdemar I besieged Szczecin Castle.  Reportedly, Wartislaw II surrendered and handed the castle to the Danes.  In 1173, he founded Kołbacz Abbey.\nAfter the death of Duke Bogislaw I in 1187, Wartislaw II and Boglislaw's widow Anastasia jointly acted as guardians and regents for the underage Dukes Bogislaw II and Casimir II.  The fact that he was their guardian is considered a strong indication that he was closely related to them; the exact family relationship is unknown.  Wartislaw II was charged with convincing King Canute VI of Denmark to enfeoffed the young Dukes with Pomerania.  However, a revolt against Denmark broke out during his rule, and in 1189, Canute VI deposed him and appointed Prince Jaromar I of Rügen as regent.  Wartislaw II then retired from public life.\nNothing is known about his later life, except the archives of Kołbacz mention that he died in 1196.\nIssue\nHis known sons:\n* Bartholomew of Szczecin (d. ), probably Castellan of Szczecin\n* Casimir (d. 1220), Castellan of Kołobrzeg\n* Wartislaw (↑ 1230/32), Castellan of Stettin\nIt is disputed whether Bishop Conrad II of Cammin (d. 1233) was a son of Wartislaw.\nFootnotes"
