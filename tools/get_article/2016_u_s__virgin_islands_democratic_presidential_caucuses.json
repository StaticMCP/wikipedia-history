A mandatory 15 percent threshold is required in order for a presidential contender to be pledged National Convention delegates.\nThe At-Large delegates are to be pledged proportionally to presidential contenders based on the Caucus results on each of the three islands: four from St Thomas and St. John jointly, and three from St. Croix. Hillary Clinton won the Virgin Islands Democratic Caucuses, which was her biggest margin in the primaries.\nThis is the only primary where Bernie Sanders receives zero delegates. In 2008, the primary of the same place was where Hillary Clinton received zero delegates.\nResults\n]]\nReferences"
