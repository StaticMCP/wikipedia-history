The general Juan Zavala de la Puente, commander of the 2th Spanish division, went to the aid of the Spanish positions and managed to repel the attackers.\nAftermath\nThe Moroccan army fled in the direction of Castillejos, where a battle would also take place. His distinguished action earned him the title of marquis of Sierra Bullones.
