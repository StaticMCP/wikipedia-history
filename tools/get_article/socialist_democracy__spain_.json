In 1992 the party joined the Coalition for a New Socialist Party, which failed to gain any representation at the national or regional level.\nElections\n* Andalusian regional election, 1990: 14,495 votes (0.53%).\n* Basque regional election, 1990: 5.023 votos (0.49%).\n* Valencian regional election, 1991: 5.207 votos (0.26%).\n* Local elections, 1991: 8.747 votos (0.05%). 4 municipal councillors.\nReferences"
