The mountain is situated above the south shore of Kathleen Lake,  southeast of Mount Worthington across the lake, and  south-southeast of Haines Junction, Yukon. The mountain can be seen from the Haines Highway as it prominently rises  above the lake. The mountain's descriptive name comes from how it is shaped by a cirque on the north aspect. A rock glacier descends from the cirque to the lake. A steep five kilometre trail provides access to the amphitheatre, and an additional three kilometres on a beaten path reaches the summit via the east ridge. Based on the Köppen climate classification, Kings Throne Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.\nSee also\n*\n*List of mountains of Canada\n*Geography of Yukon\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Parks Canada website: [https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/yt/kluane/activ/randonnee-hiking/kings-throne Kings Throne trail]\n* Flickr photo: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ben_a/14440744537/in/album-72157645213868397/ View of the cirque]\n* Flickr photo: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/tvrdypa/43691157794/in/photolist-29yQB33-2592F47-YSAP3W-YDa7DY-269emM8-uh1srQ-frqSDW-K5TnP8-n6LV9U-G5tDRJ-dvmywV-2hGk7s7-a8vKoo-k7ZGST-c1amqf-kuQUeB-2fP1q7b-khTojV-ktfXjj-ku68a6-WU1uba-2g1XiNV-rkrpmR-MtuLHd-6MvtbH-8CAzWK-Ln6hhQ-cCGLhJ-6MvunZ-6MvpGp-6MzC5Q-cuPpv9-BBmLtd-MPVhba-8Pb8wW-75kMGb-RfgD4Q-d7MoWu-d7MbfS-7EabTs-d7N3Bh-PSUWyR-SnoSDr-syF63-DT1jYu-Hj5pgN-d7MGk7-EhKzyd-8eVpJw-Hj5S9f Kings Throne Peak with Kathleen Lake]"
