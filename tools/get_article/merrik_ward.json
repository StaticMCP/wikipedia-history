He was educated at Eton College, where he played for the college cricket team. He made his debut in first-class cricket for Hampshire against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham in the 1927 County Championship. He played first-class cricket for Hampshire until 1929, making five appearances. In his five matches, Ward scored 141 runs at an average of 15.66, with a highest score of 48. As a left-arm bowler who could bowl both medium pace and slow orthodox, he bowled a total of 39 overs without taking a wicket. He stood in as captain for The Hon. Lionel Tennyson in a match against Kent in 1928, the same match in which he made his highest first-class score.\nWard later served in the Second World War, being commissioned into the Royal Army Ordnance Corps as a second lieutenant in January 1941. He died at Bath in February 1981.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
