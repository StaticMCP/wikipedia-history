The barracks were renamed Queen Elizabeth Barracks following a visit by Queen Elizabeth in 1948. The wooden hutted camp, with barrack blocks arranged as 'spiders', could accommodate 2,500 soldiers.\nBetween January 1963 and January 2003, 9 Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers was based at Haig Lines.\nThe Royal Army Medical Corps moved their depot to Keogh Barracks in 1964 and were replaced by training regiments of the Royal Corps of Transport in 1965 and by the Gurkha Regiments in 1970. After the Gurkha Regiments left in 2000, the site was decommissioned and acquired by Bryant Homes in 2002. It was initially renamed Khukri Park, but following acquisition by Taylor Wimpey, it was renamed Crookham Park. The main administration building was moved to the Aldershot Military Museum.\nReferences"
