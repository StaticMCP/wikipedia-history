This island is one of the Torres Strait Islands and is within the locality of Warraber Islet in the Torres Strait Island Region.\nGeography\nIt is in the Vigilant Channel. Situated on a coral cay, Sue Island has an abundance of traditional foods such as wongai and coconuts. Fish, turtles and dugong inhabit the warm waters and coral reefs surrounding the island.\nThe island is threatened by rising sea levels, and coastal defences have been built on many of the beaches on the island. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that by 2100, tides will rise by 30–110&nbsp;cm, depending on the timing and level of cuts to carbon emissions.\nHistory\nWarraber Island State School was opened on 29 January 1985. On 1 January 2007 it became the Warraber Island campus of the Tagai State College.\nPeople\nThe people of Sue Island are part of the Kulkalaig, of the Central Islands of Torres Strait, including Nagi. Specifically, the Nagilgal and of Waraberalgal are the same people. Life on the island remains very traditional and includes hunting, dancing, and thayilai (feasts); vital components of contemporary life.\nLanguage\nThe day-to-day language of Warraber is Brokan (Torres Strait Creole); however, the traditional language of the people of Waraber is Kulkalgau Ya, one of the four dialects of Kalaw Lagaw Ya.\nKulkalagau Ya phrases:\nNi midhadh? How are you?\nNinu nel nga? What is your name?\nStuwa unaga? Where is the store?\nNinu waru ubilaig, au? Do you like turtle?\nNi kulkalgadh yamuleka, au? Do you speak Kulkalgau Ya?\nNi markaidh muleka, au? Do you speak English?\nIna ngau mudh. This is my house.\nKayib mina kapu goeiga. This is a really nice day.\nMaal kapu idi. The sea is dead calm.\nInabi ai mina kapu mithalnga. This food is very delicious.\nAye, ngoeba buthuka. Come, let's go to the beach.\nReligion\nMany Sue Islanders still retain strong links to their traditional religion, centring on ancestor worship, including a totemic clan structure. An important religious figure was Kulka, one of Malo-Bomai's brothers. The inhabitants (Kulkalgal) are named for Kulka.\nOn 1 July every year the residents of Sue Island observe the \"Coming of the Light\". On this date in 1871, a Christian reverend named Samuel MacFarlane of the London Missionary Society came to convert the Indigenous people of the Torres Strait to Christianity. Currently, there are two main churches on the island, including the more traditional Church of the Torres Strait and the Pentecostal Assemblies of God Church.\nEducation\nWarraber Island Campus is a primary (Early Childhood - Grade 6) campus of Tagai State College  in Yessie Street in the town of Sue Island  ().\nFacilities\nWarraber Island has an Indigenous Knowledge Centre operated by the Torres Strait Island Regional Council. It functions as a library and a visitor centre.\nNavigation\nThis island houses new ship tracking and communications technologies (Automatic Identification Systems) and ship polling via the INMARSAT C satellite system.\nSee also\n*Warraber Island Airport\nReferences"
