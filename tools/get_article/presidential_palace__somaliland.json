Situated in the capital city of Hargeisa, the palace serves as the central hub for executive governance and state functions.\nOverview\nThe presidential palace, or state house was constructed in 1952 on a vast estate to the southwest of Hargeisa's city centre by the British protectorate administration to serve as a residence for Queen Elizabeth II in anticipation of a visit. The state house served as the official residence of the British governor of the Protectorate and was used to host dignitaries and entertain them on its golf course and in its gardens. The state house was considered the jewel in British Somaliland's crown.\nAfter Somaliland's independence and unification with Somalia in 1960 the palace served as a government guesthouse and as the official residence of the Mogadishu-appointed governors of the then North-West region (today Marodi Jeh), and was named Villa Hargeisa. The palace was destroyed in 1988 during the Battle of Hargeisa in the Somaliland War of Independence.\nThe palace has hosted numerous international delegations, including delegations from the United Kingdom, the European Union, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, the Czech Republic, and France.\nSee also\n* President of Somaliland\nReferences"
