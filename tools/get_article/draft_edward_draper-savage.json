Spending time in both France and the United States, Draper-Savage was a fan of the arts in preservation and creation. In 1949, he purchased the Moorefields Historic Site in Hillsborough, North Carolina.\nEarly life\nDraper-Savage spent his youth in Wilmington. Despite being born and raised in North Carolina, Draper maintains he is “90 percent yankee”. His mother, Effie Draper lived in New York until her teenage years, where her family moved to the South. His first 10 years were at Masonboro Sound in Wilmington.\nLife in France\nIn 1915, Draper Savage went to France, volunteering with the American Field Service to assist France. Upon the United States entrance into the war, he joined the Army. After the war, Draper-Saveage stayed, living in Paris. He studied art there at Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts and L’Academie Julian. Draper began sculpting and painting there, where his work was shown at many galleries, including the Paris International Exhibition. While he never became a citizen, he would live there until 1936.\nPost-France life\nDraper-Savage would return to the States in 1936 to take care of his mother and brother. He would become a French Professor at the University of Chapel Hill in 1943. During World War II he translated for French Pilots who were stationed at the University of Chapel Hill Campus.\nMoorefields\nMoorefields Historic Site in Hillsborough was built in 1785 by Alfred Moore. In looking for a studio to do his sculpture, Draper-Savage came across it, and ended up purchasing the property in 1949. At the time of purchase, Moorefields spanned over 150 acres, although he would later sell part of the property. He instituted French Gardens in the back of the house. After thoroughly renovating the house, Draper-Savage received the Cannon Cup award from the North Carolina Society for the Preservation of Antiquities. The house remains open for tours today as a Historical Site.\nReferences"
