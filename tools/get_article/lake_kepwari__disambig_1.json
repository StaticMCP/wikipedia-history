It is  long,  wide and up to  deep. It covers  and holds about  of water.\nSince 2003, rehabilitation work on the site has been undertaken to develop it as a community aquatic recreation facility. It has taken about five years to fill with water from Collie River South. In 2008, the state government allocated 3.29 million for the recreational development of the site.\nIts opening has been delayed, however, due to public safety concerns about the low pH levels (pH 4.5) in the water. The acidity is believed to be due to ground water leakage at its deeper points. The ground water contains high levels of iron which oxidises and causes acidity levels to rise.\nIn 2009, the government called for submissions for an environmental impact assessment relating to the effects of reconnecting Collie River South to the lake, which is intended to create a flushing effect. The river is upstream from Wellington Dam and was diverted around the southern edge of the site throughout the mining operations.\nIt was officially opened in December 2020 by Premier Mark McGowan. The 5.2 million campground and boating facilities were described as part of a larger 23.3 million investment in infrastructure in the area to make it a tourism hub.\nFacilities\nThe lake has a boat ramp and parking for trailers along the shoreline. Water skiing is permitted in the lake along kayaking and swimming. Shelters and gas barbeques are also found near the boat ramp. Fishing is permitted in the lake and redfin perch and marron are both commonly caught. There are some campsites in the area, but booking is required.\n}}\nReferences"
