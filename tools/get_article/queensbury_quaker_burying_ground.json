It was established about 1765 and remained in service until 1837.\nThis cemetery was the first in Queensbury.\nA commemorative marker was installed in 1911 by the Wing family to honor that family's role in the settlement of Queensbury.  The burial ground contains approximately 80 burials.\nThe site was the location of a Quaker Meeting House and school, as well as cemetery. Today the site is a fenced patch of grassy ground next to a shopping center, marked by two plaques. The cemetery has no gravestones, in keeping with Quaker tradition of the time. In 2002, during planning for the shopping center, an archaeological survey was conducted. The burials were discovered, and the land deeded to Queensbury in perpetuity.\nThe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.warrencountyny.gov/historian/CemeteryBooks/FirstQuaker.pdf List of burials – Warren County, New York]\n*"
