      "text": "# Bedsit Disco Queen\n\nBedsit Disco Queen: How I grew up and tried to be a pop star is an autobiography written by Tracey Thorn, first published in February 2013. The book received widespread critical acclaim and was a Sunday Times Top Ten bestseller. The book was featured on BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week in March 2013.\nReception\nWriting for The Independent, Fiona Sturges stated that “Thorn is about as far removed from typical notions of a successful singer as it's possible to get. Which makes her ideal to report on the pop star experience, and the ever-shifting landscape of the British music scene of the Eighties and Nineties\".\nIn The Times, Lucy Denyer stated that \"It is a beautifully written book, dryly funny and searingly honest about growing up, whether it was discovering feminism, or being slightly out of her depth as a 15-year-old at an Anti-Nazi League rally\".\nReferences"
