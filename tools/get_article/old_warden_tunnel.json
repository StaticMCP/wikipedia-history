Construction began in 1853 and the line opened on 7 May 1857. It was operable for over 100 years before losing its passenger services a year before the Beeching Axe on 1 January 1962. Goods services between Shefford and Bedford succumbed to the Beeching Axe on 28 December 1964.\nConstruction\nBuilt of blue engineering bricks, the tunnel is ovoid in shape and runs at a very slight gradient to allow drainage; however, it is perfectly straight in alignment.\nThe tunnel has no blast relief ducts, due to its lack of curves and relatively short length, allowing good air passage. Regular niches were cut into the wall to allow maintenance on the permanent way during running hours. Both portals were capped with stone and it covers a total length of .\nThe tunnel can be seen in the film Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines into which they fly. The location where Sir Percy's aircraft lands on a train is the same disused line from Bedford to Hitchin. The tunnel had only recently been closed, and in the panning shot through the railway cutting, the cooling towers of the now-demolished Goldington power station can be seen.\nThe tunnel today\nThe tunnel has lain derelict for over 60 years, but is in fair condition, with the southern (Hitchin) end back-filled to within  of the tunnel roof and the northern (Bedford) end bricked up with gratings to allow access for bats. However, public access has been closed at both ends. Entrance to the tunnel is not recommended, due to bats and standing water accumulation. The northern portal is still visible in its cutting, but the southern portal is entirely covered in undergrowth.\nNature reserve\nThe land above the tunnel is Old Warden Tunnel nature reserve, which is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.\nSee also\n* List of tunnels in the United Kingdom\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.abandonedengland.com/oldwardentunnel Old Warden Tunnel – Bedfordshire] – Abandoned England"
