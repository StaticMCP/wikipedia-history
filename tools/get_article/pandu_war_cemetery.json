Most of the graves belong to Dutch civilian war victims and prisoners of war from Japanese-run internment camps who were killed by their captors during the fall of Japan in 1945. At the highest point of the cemetery stands a flag pole with at its base the place names where most people were killed. Lt. Gen. Berenschot, who died in an aircraft crash before the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies, is also buried here.\nThere are two monuments on the cemetery, one for all the unidentified civilian war victims and one for all the unknown soldiers who are buried there.\nNotable burials\n* Gerardus Johannes Berenschot (1887–1941)\n* L. E. Lanjouw (1896–1942)\n* Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker (1882–1949)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [https://oorlogsgravenstichting.nl/begraafplaatsen/nederlands-ereveld-pandu-te-bandung Pandu War Cemetery] on the website of the Netherlands War Graves Foundation (OGS)\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20030428210333/http://www.ogs.nl:80/docs/222030_Ereveld%20Pandu.pdf OGS leaflet about Pandu War Cemetery]\n*  [https://issuu.com/oorlogsgraven-stichting/docs/ogs_brochure_zo_azie_eng?fr=xKAE9_zU1NQ OGS brochure about Dutch war graves in Southeast Asia]"
