The game is set during the Napoleonic Wars, with a total conversion DLC set during World War I titled Holdfast: Frontlines. The game is developed and published by Maltese company Anvil Game Studios.\nHistory\nAnvil Game Studios was founded in June 2014 by twin brothers Julian and Andrew Farrugia, after completing work on the 'Napoleonic Wars' DLC for Mount & Blade: Warband, and began working on Holdfast: Nations At War. An early access version was released on September 21, 2017. After developing further based on player feedback, a 'Version 1.0' was released March 5, 2020. Additional content and DLC have been developed continually since, with Holdfast: Frontlines released on February 17, 2022.\nSetting and gameplay\nPlayers can play as a number of different factions that participated in the Napoleonic Wars, including the British Empire, French Empire, Kingdom of Prussia, Russian Empire, Austrian Empire, and Kingdom of Italy. In Holdfast: Frontlines, players can play as factions from World War I, such as Australia, United States, Germany or the Ottoman Empire. Players can choose from various classes in the class system, such as infantry, commanders, drummers, surgeons and carpenters. Servers can handle up to 150 players at a time, and feature both line battle and naval combat servers.\nReferences"
