The monument is located in Sibelius Park (; ) in the Töölö district of Helsinki, Finland.\nDescription\nThe monument is a sculpture by Finnish artist Eila Hiltunen titled Passio Musicae and was unveiled on 7 September 1967. The sculpture won a competition, organised by the Sibelius Society, following the composer's death in 1957. The competition took two rounds after one early winner was abandoned. Originally it sparked a lively debate about the merits and flaws of abstract art and although the design looked like stylised organ pipes it was known that the composer had created little music for organs. Hiltunen addressed her critics by adding the face of Sibelius which sits beside the main sculpture.\nIt consists of series of more than 600 hollow steel pipes welded together in a wave-like pattern. The monument weighs  and measures . Hiltunen's aim was to capture the essence of the music of Sibelius.\nA smaller version of the monument, Homage to Sibelius, is located at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. A work with a similar concept, also designed by Hiltunen, is located at the grounds of the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City.\nSibelius Park and Kalevala Monument\nIn 1939, the Leo and Regina Wainstein Foundation organised a competition for sculptors to design a work that depicted a scene from Finland's national epic The Kalevala, which would be erected in the park. The winner was  (1889–1980) and his work Ilmatar and the Scaup, in bronze, was unveiled in 1946.\nGallery\nFile:Sibelius-monumentin-paljastus.jpg|President Urho Kekkonen and the artist at the unveiling\nFile:Jean Sibelius Park.jpg|alt=Sibelius monument|Sibelius Park\nFile:WWII monument in Sibelius Park.jpg|World War II Monument in Sibelius Park\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071110131356/http://www.360travelguide.com/360VirtualTour.asp?iCode=hel21 Virtual tour of Sibelius Monument]"
