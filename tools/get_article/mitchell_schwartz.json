Schwartz was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the second round of the 2012 NFL draft.\nSchwartz played college football for the California Golden Bears. He started all 51 games possible from 2008 to 2011, at either left tackle or right tackle. He was named second-team All-Pac-10 as a junior, and first-team All-Pac-12 and Pac-12 All-Academic as a senior. He also earned honorable mention Pac-10 All-Academic (2008–10), and the Brick Muller Award as Cal's Most Valuable Offensive Lineman (2009–11), for three seasons each.\nHe was named to the Pro Football Focus (PFF) 2012 All-Rookie Team, lauded for his \"top-notch pass blocking\", and to the 2014 PFF All-Third Year Team. He signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2015. Following the 2018 season, he was named the winner of the Pro Football Focus Matthews Award, given out by the organization to their highest-rated offensive lineman each year, and was named a First-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. In 2019 he was named to the CBS Sports' NFL All-Decade Team. He has started over 120 consecutive games, and had 7,894 consecutive snaps (which made him the active iron man leader in the snaps category).\nEarly life\nSchwartz was born in Pacific Palisades, California and grew up in West Los Angeles.  He is the son of Lee Schwartz, a business consultant to manufacturing companies, and Olivia Goodkin, an attorney. Schwartz is Jewish, and was raised in Conservative Judaism. His Hebrew name is Mendel. Schwartz and his brother Geoff authored the book Eat my Schwartz: Our Story of NFL Football, Food, Family, and Faith.\nSchwartz didn't start playing football until he was a freshman in high school. When he started the ninth grade, he was already  tall and , too big for the size restrictions of the local Pop Warner youth leagues.  Additionally, his parents wanted him to instead focus on studying for his Bar Mitzvah.\nHis brother, offensive guard Geoff, played in the NFL for four different teams. Geoff and Mitchell are the first Jewish brothers to play in the NFL since Ralph Horween and Arnold Horween, in 1923.\nHis father, speaking of the fact that he has two sons playing in the National Football League, said: \"I just kvell.\"  His mother, commenting on having two sons play football, said: I started out worrying that they were going to get hurt, but then I realized it was the other players I should be worrying about. They were like trucks hitting small cars. And I started to kind of feel like maybe this was their destiny.\nHigh school career\nSchwartz attended Palisades Charter High School. Playing football for his high school team, on which he was the team captain, he was regarded as a three-star offensive tackle prospect by Rivals.com; Scout.com ranked him #23.\nHe began as a quarterback, but quickly moved over to offensive tackle where he was a four-year starter.

He was named to the 2014 PFF All-Third Year Team.\n2015 season\nIn 2015, Schwartz started all 16 games for the Browns for the fourth consecutive season, playing all offensive snaps.

Schwartz won his first Super Bowl when the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV.\nSchwartz had never missed a snap in his NFL career spanning parts of eight seasons and 121 games, until a knee injury forced him out of a Kansas City loss to the Tennessee Titans for three snaps in November 2019, and after 7,894 snaps his streak—then the longest among active players in the NFL—came to an end. Schwartz did in that game start his 122nd-consecutive game, behind only Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers (218 games) and Baltimore cornerback Brandon Carr (184).\n2020 season\nDuring practice prior to the Chiefs' Week 6 game against the Buffalo Bills, Schwartz injured his back.
