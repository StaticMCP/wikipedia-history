Created in 1991 by the PEN American Center (today PEN America), the award ensures custodians of language and literature are representative of the American people.\nThe Committee discusses mutual concerns and strategies for advancing writing and professional activities, and coordinates Open Book events. While multiple awards were presented in previous years, the PEN Open Book Award now presents one award every year to books published in the United States (but without citizenship or residency requirements) by \"authors of color who have not received wide media coverage\".\nThe award is one of many PEN awards sponsored by International PEN affiliates in over 145 PEN centers around the world. The PEN American Center awards have been characterized as being among the \"major\" American literary prizes.\nHonorees\nPEN Open Book Award\nAfter 2010, the Beyond Margins Award was renamed the PEN Open Book Award.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+PEN Open Book Award winners and finalists\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!
