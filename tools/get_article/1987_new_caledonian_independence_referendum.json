Voters were given the choice of remaining part of France or becoming independent. The referendum was boycotted by independence movements. Only 1.7% voted in favour of independence.\nBackground\nBy a vote of 325 to 249, the French Parliament passed a law on 15 April 1984 on holding an independence referendum in New Caledonia. Independence movements including the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front boycotted the referendum in protest at the franchise requirements, which made the indigenous population a minority. Although former French president François Mitterrand had promised short-term residents of the territory would not be able to vote, they were enfranchised for the referendum. As a result of claimed failures to respect the rights of the indigenous population, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization did not send observers.\nResults\nVoters were asked \"Do you wish New Caledonia to remain in the French Republic, or do you wish it to become independent?\"\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|France||48,611||98.30\n|-\n|align=left|Independence||842||1.70\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||797||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||50,250||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||85,022||59.10\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: [http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=nc011987 Direct Democracy]\n|}\nSee also\n* 2018 New Caledonian independence referendum\n* 2020 New Caledonian independence referendum\n* 2021 New Caledonian independence referendum\n* Decolonisation of Oceania\n* United Nations list of non-self-governing territories\n* Ouvéa cave hostage taking (1988)\n* \"Yaka dansé\"\nReferences"
