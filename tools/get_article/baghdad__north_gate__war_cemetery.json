His initial grave and marker was replaced by a more elaborate structure and then enclosed in a small mausoleum structure on the walls of which is mounted the standard CWGC headstone.

He kept the faith.\"\n*Lieutenant-Colonel Gerard Leachman (1880 – 1920), soldier and intelligence officer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
