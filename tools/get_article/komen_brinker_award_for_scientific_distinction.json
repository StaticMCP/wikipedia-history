Komen for the Cure in 1992 to recognize leading scientists for their significant work in advancing research concepts or clinical application in the fields of breast cancer research, screening or treatment.\nThe intent of the award is to recognize scholars for a specific contribution, a consistent pattern of contributions, or leadership in the field that has had a substantial impact on the fight against breast cancer. The awardees are nominated and selected by a panel of their peers. Recipients are also invited to present their work in a lecture at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). Brinker Award recipients each receive a $20,000 honorarium and a special citation of this distinction.\nRecipients\n[http://raiseproject.org/resultsDetail.php?id=121 Past recipients of the Komen Brinker Award] for Scientific Distinction include\n* V.
