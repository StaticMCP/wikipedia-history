It is part of the Delta Force series. The game was re-released in 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via PlayStation Network.\nPlot\nThe game tells the story of a Delta Force operative named John Carter who had taken part in a failed drug deal bust in Tumaco, Colombia, and was subsequently sent undercover by CIA agent Robert Jackson to capture or kill the involved drug lord and red mercury smuggler Malik.\nGameplay\nIt was designed to be a military simulation loosely based on the Delta Force special operations force. The storyline spans twelve missions, including a bank robbery, hostage rescue, and an assault on an offshore oil rig.\nThe game features a greater emphasis on story than previous Delta Force games, as it features fully animated and voice-acted cutscenes in between missions. Its missions are also less vast and open than other titles in the franchise, focusing instead on a more scripted and linear play style, in tight urban environments.\nReception\n| CVG = 6/10\n| EGM = 7/10\n| EuroG = 6/10\n| OPM =\n}}\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
