The ceremony was first held at the flagship Odeon Cinema in Leicester Square in London, then the Royal Opera House from 2007 to 2016. The event was held at the Royal Albert Hall from 2017 to 2022, before moving to the Royal Festival Hall for 2023. The statue awarded to recipients depicts a theatrical mask. The BAFTA Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British cinema, equivalent to the BAFTA TV Awards for television, Laurence Olivier Awards for theatre, and the BRIT Awards for music. The BAFTA Film Awards are considered equivalent to the Academy Awards.\nThe first BAFTA Awards ceremony was held in 1949, and the ceremony was first broadcast on the BBC in 1956 with Vivien Leigh as the host. The ceremony was initially held in April or May; since 2001, it typically takes place in February.\nHistory\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) was founded in 1947 as The British Film Academy, by David Lean, Alexander Korda, Carol Reed, Charles Laughton, Roger Manvell, Laurence Olivier, Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell, Michael Balcon, and other major figures of the British film industry. In 1958, the Academy merged with The Guild of Television Producers and Directors to form The Society of Film and Television, which eventually became The British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1976.\nThe stated charitable purpose of BAFTA is to \"support, develop and promote the art forms of the moving image, by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners, and benefiting the public\". In addition to high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA runs a year-round programme of educational events, including film screenings and tribute evenings. BAFTA is supported by a membership of about 6,000 people from the film, television, and video game industries.\nThe Academy's awards are in the form of a theatrical mask designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe, in response to a commission from the Guild of Television Producers in 1955.\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was the host of the ceremony as the first president of BAFTA in 1960,1963, and 1965.\nPrincess Anne presented the first Fellowship Award to Alfred Hitchcock in 1971, and subsequently attended the ceremony several times as President of BAFTA between 1973 and 2001.\nAnnual ceremony\nceremony]]\nThe ceremony previously took place in April or May, but since 2001 it has been held in February in order to precede the Academy Awards. Most of the awards are open to all nationalities, though there are awards for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Producer or Director. Only UK films are eligible for the categories of The British Short Film and British Short Animation awards.\nDuring each annual ceremony, BAFTA pauses in memoriam to pay tribute to those in the industry who have died over the past 12 months, showcasing a montage of images accompanied by music.\nWilliam, Prince of Wales attended the ceremony for the first time in 2010 after being named president of BAFTA, and has attended frequently since, including together with Catherine, Princess of Wales. He presented the BAFTA Fellowship award to Mel Brooks in 2017 and Kathleen Kennedy in 2020.\nBroadcast\nHistorically, the Awards ceremony was broadcast on British television on a same-day delay, and later distributed internationally. The first broadcast was on the BBC in 1956, with Vivien Leigh (who would present an award to her ex husband Sir Laurence Olivier) as the host. It has been broadcast in colour since 1970. In the US the show was previously broadcast with a delay on BBC America until 2021, after which it has broadcast on streaming service BritBox. In 2023, the BAFTA Film Awards included a live telecast for its major award categories during the culmination of the ceremony.\nLocation\nThe award ceremony is held in London. From 2000 to 2007, the ceremonies took place at the flagship Odeon cinema in Leicester Square. Between 2008 and 2016, the ceremonies took place at the Royal Opera House. The 70th Awards in 2017, and subsequent ceremonies up to the 75th Awards in 2022, were held at the Royal Albert Hall.\nFor the 76th British Academy Film Awards in 2023, it was announced that the ceremony would be moved to the Royal Festival Hall as part of a new multi-year deal between BAFTA and the Southbank Centre, bringing the Film Awards in-line with the British Academy Television Awards and British Academy Games Awards, which were already held there.\nSponsorship\nUntil 2012, the mobile telephone network Orange sponsored the awards. Orange's parent company, EE, took over the sponsorship of the event from 2013.\nAward categories\nRetired awards\n* BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles (awarded 1952–1984)\n* BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay (awarded 1955–1968)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay (awarded 1969–1983)\n* BAFTA Award for Best British Actor (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA Award for Best British Actress (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress (awarded 1952–1967)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Original Song (awarded 1983–1985)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Factual Film\n* BAFTA Award for Best Fictional Film\n* BAFTA Award for Best Short Factual Film\n* BAFTA Award for Best Specialised Film\n* BAFTA Award for Best Animation (awarded 1955–1982)\n* BAFTA John Grierson Award\n* BAFTA United Nations Award (awarded 1949–1976)\nSpecial awards\n* BAFTA Fellowship (since 1971)\n* Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award (known as the Michael Balcon Award from 1979 to 2006)\n* Britannia Awards (1989–2019)\nSuperlatives\nActing\nat the 2008 BAFTA Awards.
