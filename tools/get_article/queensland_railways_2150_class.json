They differed by having a modular control system and the sandboxes relocated from the nose to the bogies. All were transferred to QR National in 2004, which became Aurizon in 2012.\nIn 2011, four were sold to TasRail entering service as the 2050 class. In August 2013, seven were exported to South Africa. Three were sold by Aurizon back to Queensland Rail in 2014.\nReferences"
