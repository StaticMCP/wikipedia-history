The incident occurred after 1:00 PM when more than 20 participants were simultaneously on the 30-by-50-foot arched wooden framework. Twelve people were transported to hospitals by ambulance or helicopter, including a 10-year-old child. Injuries included broken bones, lacerations, and back and neck trauma. Nurse Brandi Taylor, who suffered a broken arm in the collapse, reported that the structure appeared \"structurally unsound\" and fell in \"slow motion.\"\nInvestigation and Legal Consequences\nIn August 2017, following an investigation by the Louisiana State Fire Marshal's Office, arrest warrants were issued for five individuals. Two North Carolina contractors were charged with 13 misdemeanor counts of negligent injury and one felony count each for contracting without Louisiana licensure. Three Red Frog Events employees were charged with negligent injury.\nSafety and Construction Violation\nThe investigation revealed multiple safety and construction failures. Safety monitors, many approximately 13 or 14 years old, were provided radios but no instruction regarding participant capacity limits. Construction deficiencies included the use of 2x4-inch boards where plans specified 2x6-inch boards, and inadequate nailing. According to Chief Deputy State Fire Marshal Brant Thompson, when boards became detached from the main frame during the event, organizers attempted minor repairs rather than closing the obstacle.\nThe event organizers failed to follow written company safety procedures, including:\n* Proper construction verification\n* Monitoring of obstacles during the race\n* Positioning of staff members at each obstacle for safety supervision\nThe event was the fourth Warrior Dash held at this location, with 6,500 pre-registered participants. Despite thousands of competitors safely traversing the obstacle before its collapse, investigators questioned the stability of other obstacles at the site.  These events were widely reported in the news at the time...[https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/construction-blamed-for-obstacle-crash-5-warrants-issued/]\n2019\nAs of July 31, 2019, Red Frog Events announced that it will cease operations, and all scheduled races were cancelled. They offered no refund for anyone, took money from participants and continued to advertise, knowing they were going to close up shop. Red Frog has not responded to messages. Other races have attempted to fill the gap by offering free admission for those registered for a Warrior Dash that was cancelled.\nRegistration\nRegistration for Warrior Dash takes place online prior to deadlines put forth by Red Frog Events. Pricing depends on location and the length of time until the event. All registrations close on the Tuesday before each specific event at 11:59 PM (CST).\nWith registration, each participant receives:\n* Race bib\n* As of 2014, races are self-timed.\n* Warrior Dash participant T-shirt\n* Warrior Dash helmet\n* One free beer (for those who are of legal drinking age; redeemable by bib tear-off)\n* Finisher medal\n* Post-race snack and water\nRace Day\nRace organizers provide parking on site or a free shuttle system from an off-site parking venue. Parking prices are currently $10 per car at each event. Warrior Dash organizers also provide a \"Gear Check Tent\" where participants are able to store belongings.\nRunners gather in the start corral prior to their designated wave time. The course is roughly 5 kilometers long with at least 12 obstacles to overcome before reaching the finish line where they will receive a finisher medal, snack and water. The race is self-timed. There will be a clock at the start line. Racers are encouraged to bring a waterproof watch.\nWarrior Dash provides additional forms of entertainment that vary at each event. Examples of such forms are axe-throwing contests, fireworks displays and chainsaw carving displays.\nAt each Warrior Dash, there are several awards presented to participants. Each participant is eligible to win awards for:\n* Top three overall male and female times\n* Top three males and females in each age division\n* Best Warrior beard\n* Best costume\nCharity partnerships\nSt. Jude\nEach participant has the opportunity to raise funds for St. Jude's Children's Hospital. Warrior Dash does not contribute any portion of their revenue to St. Jude. Rather, all of the funds raised for St. Jude comes directly from the participants.\nFundraising opportunity\nWarrior Dash provides monetary donations to local organizations that volunteer at events. By volunteering at Warrior Dash, local organizations such as athletic teams, nearby school and non-profit organizations are able to raise funds based on the number of group members who volunteer at Warrior Dash.\nSponsorships\nWarrior Dash has multiple national sponsors as well as local sponsorship opportunities on a market basis.\nSponsors in 2011 include Bear Naked and Monster Energy. A sample of additional sponsors are:\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"width: 375px\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"375\" | Sponsor\n|-\n| Pyramid Breweries\n|-\n| U.S. Marine Corps\n|-\n| Athletes Honey Milk\n|-\n| Pacific Monarch Resorts\n|-\n| Shock Top\n|-\n| Honest Tea\n|-\n| FUZE\n|-\n| Degree deodorant\n|-\n| Otterbox\n|-\n| Stanley\n|}\nAccording to a 2010 Warrior Dash participant survey administered by Red Frog Events, Warrior Dash on average draws participants from 47 states and three countries. According to the National Association of Sports Commissions (NASC), direct spending on average by Warrior Dash attendees from one event is $4.5 million.
