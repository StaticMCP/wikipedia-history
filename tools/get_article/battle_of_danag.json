Prior to the attack, Abu Sayyaf attacked Philippine forces on March 15 in Basilan, killing one and injuring two others.\nBattle\nAt the time of the attack, the 21st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army had been preparing for an assault against Abu Sayyaf militants in the jungly mountains near the village of Danag when they came upon a group of forty militants. The encounter occurred at 3:05pm at Sitio Lubong, and clashes broke out immediately between the militants and the soldiers. A military report confirmed that Abu Sayyaf leader Radullan Sahiron and Hajan Sawadjaan were among those present in the militant's group. The fighting lasted for an hour, and the Abu Sayyaf militants withdrew.\nAftermath\nBlood at the scene confirmed the deaths and injuries of an unknown number of militants, according to Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana. Eleven Philippine soldiers were initially killed, and fourteen were injured. One soldier died of his injuries shortly after the battle, raising the toll to twelve killed. Philippine forces lost several weapons.\nThe Philippine Army dispatched reinforcements from the 11th Infantry Division, 5th Scout Ranger Battalion, 6th Special Forces Battalion, and 32nd Infantry Battalion to the site, and the army began combing operations around the site of the battle. The Philippine government announced that the flag would be flown at half-mast in response, and Chief of Staff Felimon Santos Jr. hailed the fallen soldiers as heroes.\nReferences"
