Co-written and produced by Keith Diamond, it climbed to number one on both the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the Billboard Black Singles chart, and number six on the UK Singles Chart. The song won Ocean the 1985 Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, making him the first British artist to win in that category.\nThe song is written and recorded in the key of D minor. The saxophone solo is played by Vernon Jeffrey Smith.\nHistory\nThe song was initially released in the UK as \"European Queen\" in May 1984, but it did not achieve success. As suggested by people at the record company, it was re-recorded for different parts of the world—resulting in the versions \"Caribbean Queen\" and \"African Queen\".\nIn the US, the song was released under the title \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)\". It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 85 on the chart dated 11 August 1984. Twelve weeks later it hit number one and stayed at the top of the chart for two consecutive weeks. The song charted for 26 weeks. This version then also achieved success in Europe:\nCharts\n\"Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)\"\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984–1985)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Guatemala (UPI)\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Adult Contemporary\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot Black Singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Year-end chart performance for \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984)\n!scope=\"col\"|Rank\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|76\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n|align=\"center\"|30\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|51\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box\n|align=\"center\"|22\n|}\n\"African Queen\"\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"African Queen\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|}\n\"European Queen (No More Love on the Run)\"\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"European Queen (No More Love on the Run)\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984–1985)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+1984 year-end chart performance for \"European Queen (No More Love on the Run)\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984)\n!scope=\"col\"|Rank\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)\n|align=\"center\"|98\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100)\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+1985 year-end chart performance for \"European Queen (No More Love on the Run)\"\n!Chart (1985)\n!Rank\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|West Germany (Official German Charts)\n|align=\"center\"|51\n|}\nCertifications and sales\nSee also\n*List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1984\n*List of number-one dance singles of 1984 (U.S.)\n*List of number-one singles of 1984 (Canada)\n*List of number-one singles from the 1980s (New Zealand)\n*List of number-one R&B singles of 1984 (U.S.)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.45cat.com/record/jive77 \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)\"] at 45cat.com"
