      "text": "# Timeline of antisemitism__disambig_1\n\nThis timeline of antisemitism chronicles events in the history of antisemitism, hostile actions or discrimination against Jews as members of a religious and ethnic group. It includes events in Jewish history and the history of antisemitic thought, actions which were undertaken in order to counter antisemitism or alleviate its effects, and events that affected the prevalence of antisemitism in later years. The history of antisemitism can be traced from ancient times to the present day.\nSome authors prefer to use the terms anti-Judaism or religious antisemitism in reference to religious sentiments against Judaism which were prevalent before the rise of racial antisemitism in the 19th century. For events which specifically pertain to expulsions and exoduses of Jews, see Jewish refugees.\n__NOTOC__\nAntiquity Century C.E.: 1st2nd3rd 4th5th6th7th 8th9th 10th11th12th 13th14th15th16th 17th18th19th 20th21st\nAntiquity\nNote: Several of the following events took place earlier than the term \"antisemitism\" is generally applied. Some even took place when the Israelites and Judeans practiced an early, non-monotheistic form of Judaism known as Yahwism, First Temple Judaism, or First Temple Israelite religion. However, these events feature heavily in the history detailed in the Old Testament, which was foundational to the later establishment of Second Temple Judaism, following the return of the Israelites from Babylon after it was conquered by the Persian Empire.\n;740&nbsp;BCE: During the Assyrian captivity (or the Assyrian exile), several thousand Israelites of ancient Samaria are resettled as captives by Assyria. The Northern Kingdom of Israel is then conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n;586&nbsp;BCE: During the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar II, the Neo-Babylonian Empire destroys the temple in Jerusalem and captures the Kingdom of Judah, expelling as many as 10,000 families to Babylon. Judeans are seen here by the Babylonians as a uniform group, marking the beginning of collective persecution.\n;475&nbsp;BCE: Haman is said in the Book of Esther to attempt genocide against the Jews. While this book is considered fictional by historians, it alludes to a history of conquest by non-Levantine groups for the people of Judea.\n;175&nbsp;BCE–165&nbsp;BCE: The Deuterocanonical First and Second Books of the Maccabees record that Antiochus IV Epiphanes attempts to erect a statue of Zeus in Jerusalem and persecutes Jews who follow Jewish law. He arrests a mother and her seven sons and tries to force them to eat pork. When they refuse, he tortures and kills the sons one by one. The Talmud tells a similar story, as do 4 Maccabees and Josippon. The festival of Hanukkah commemorates the uprising of the Maccabees against this attempt.\n;139 BCE:Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Hispanus expels all Jews from the city of Rome.\n;63 BCE: 12,000 Jews are killed by the Romans and many more are sent into the diaspora during Pompey's conquest of the East.\n;59 BCE: Cicero criticizes Jews, claiming they are too influential in public assemblies. He also refers to Jews and Syrians as \"races born to be slaves\".\nFirst century\n;19 CE: Roman Emperor Tiberius expels Jews from Rome. Their expulsion is recorded by the Roman historical writers Suetonius, Josephus, and Cassius Dio.\n;38 CE: Thousands of Jews killed by mobs in the Alexandrian pogrom, as recounted by Philo of Alexandria in Flaccus. Synagogues are defiled, Jewish leaders are publicly scourged, and the Jewish population is confined to one quarter of the city.\n;50 CE: Jews are ordered by Roman Emperor Claudius \"not to hold meetings\", in the words of Cassius Dio (Roman History, 60.6.6). Claudius later expelled Jews from Rome, according to both Suetonius (\"Lives of the Twelve Caesars\", Claudius, Section 25.4) and Acts 18:2.\n;66 CE: Under the command of Tiberius Julius Alexander, Roman soldiers killed about 50,000 Jews in the Alexandria riot.\n;66–73 CE: The First Jewish–Roman War against the Romans is crushed by Vespasian and Titus. Titus refuses to accept a wreath of victory, because there is \"no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God.\" (Philostratus, Vita Apollonii). The events of this period were recorded in detail by the Jewish–Roman historian Josephus. His record is largely sympathetic to the Roman point of view and it was written in Rome under Roman protection; hence it is considered a controversial source. Josephus describes the Jewish revolt as being led by \"tyrants\", to the detriment of the city, and he describes Titus as having \"moderation\" in his escalation of the Siege of Jerusalem (70).\n;70 CE: Over 1,000,000 Jews perish and 97,000 are taken as slaves following the destruction of the Second Temple.\n;70 CE: Pogrom against jews in Damascus\n;94 CE: Fabrications of Apion in Alexandria, Egypt, including the first recorded case of blood libel. Juvenal writes anti-Jewish poetry. Josephus picks apart contemporary and old antisemitic myths in his work Against Apion.\n;96 CE: Titus Flavius Clemens, nephew of the Roman Emperor Vespasian and supposed convert to Judaism is put to death on charges of atheism.\n;100 CE: Tacitus writes anti-Jewish polemic in his Histories ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+5.1 book 5]). He reports on several old myths of ancient antisemitism (including that of the donkey's head in the Holy of Holies), but the key to his view that Jews \"regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies\" is his analysis of the extreme differences between monotheistic Judaism and the polytheism common throughout the Roman world.\nSecond century\n;115–117: Thousands of Jews are killed during civil unrest in Egypt, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica, as recounted by Cassius Dio.\n;119: Roman Emperor Hadrian bans circumcision, making Judaism de facto illegal.\n;132–135: Crushing of the Bar Kokhba revolt. According to Cassius Dio 580,000 Jews are killed. Hadrian orders the expulsion of Jews from Judea, which is merged with Galilee in order to form the province of Syria Palaestina.  Although large Jewish populations remain in Samaria and Galilee, with Tiberias as the headquarters of exiled Jewish patriarchs, this is the start of the Jewish diaspora. Hadrian constructs a pagan temple to Jupiter at the site of the Temple in Jerusalem, builds Aelia Capitolina among the ruins of Jerusalem.\n;136: Hadrian renames Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina and builds a Roman monument over the site of the Temple Mount. Jews are banned from visiting.

The Christian Church separates the calculation of the date of Easter from the Jewish Passover: \"It was ... declared improper to follow the custom of the Jews in the celebration of this holy festival, because, their hands having been stained with crime, the minds of these wretched men are necessarily blinded.... Let us, then, have nothing in common with the Jews, who are our adversaries. ... avoiding all contact with that evil way. ... who, after having compassed the death of the Lord, being out of their minds, are guided not by sound reason, but by an unrestrained passion, wherever their innate madness carries them. ... a people so utterly depraved. ... Therefore, this irregularity must be corrected, in order that we may no more have any thing in common with those parricides and the murderers of our Lord. ... no single point in common with the perjury of the Jews.\"\n;330: Rabbah bar Nahmani is forced to flee to the forest where he dies.\n;339: Intermarriage between Christians and Jews is banned in the Roman Empire, declaring the punishment death.\n;351: Book burning of Jewish texts in Persia.\n;351–352: Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus.

Theodosius I orders that those responsible be punished, and the synagogue is rebuilt at the Christians' expense. Ambrose of Milan insists in his letter that the whole case be dropped. He interrupts the liturgy in the emperor's presence with an ultimatum that he will not continue until the case is dropped. Theodosius complies.\n;399: The Western Roman Emperor Honorius calls Judaism superstitio indigna (unworthy superstition) and confiscates gold and silver collected by the synagogues for Jerusalem.\nFifth century\n;408: Roman laws pass which prohibit Jews from setting fire to Haman, stating that they are mocking Christianity.\n;415: A Jewish uprising in Alexandria claims the lives of many Christians. Bishop Cyril forces his way into the synagogue, expels the Jews (some authors estimate the numbers of Jews expelled up to 100 thousand) and gives their property to the mob. Later, near Antioch, Jews are accused of ritual murder during Purim. Christians confiscate the synagogue. Jews call it \"415 C.E. Alexandria Expulsion\".\n;415: An edict issued by the Emperors Honorius and Theodosius II ban building new Synagogues and converting non-Jews to Judaism.\n;418: The first record of Jews being forced to convert or face expulsion.
