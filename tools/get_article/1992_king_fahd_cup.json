It was hosted by Saudi Arabia in October 1992, and was won by Argentina, who beat the hosts Saudi Arabia 3–1 in the final. The 1992 tournament was the only one not to feature a group stage and only featured four nations.\nBoth Holland Euro 1988 winners and Denmark Euro 1992 winners also 1990 World Champions Germany were invited but all 3 nations declined due to the difficulty in persuading clubs to release players for the tournament also there was no team from Oceania, This meant that there was no representation from Europe and Oceania.\nIn 1997, FIFA took over the organization of the tournament, named it the FIFA Confederations Cup and staged the competition every two years and recognized the first two editions.\nQualified teams\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Team\n!Confederation\n!Qualification method\n!Participation no.\n|-\n|\n|AFC\n|Hosts and 1988 AFC Asian Cup winners\n|align=center|1st\n|-\n|\n|CONCACAF\n|1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup winners\n|align=center|1st\n|-\n|\n|CONMEBOL\n|1991 Copa América winners\n|align=center|1st\n|-\n|\n|CAF\n|1992 African Cup of Nations winners\n|align=center|1st\n|}\nSquads\nVenue\nAll matches were played at the 75,000-capacity King Fahd International Stadium in the city of Riyadh.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"4\" |}}\n!Riyadh\n|-\n|King Fahd International Stadium\n|-\n|Capacity: 75,000\n|-\n|\n|}\nMatch referees\n;Africa\n* Lim Kee Chong\n;Asia\n* Jamal Al Sharif\n;North, Central America and Caribbean\n* Rodrigo Badilla\n;South America\n* Ulisses Tavares da Silva\nFinal tournament\nBracket\n|4||0\n|15 October – Riyadh||0||3\n|20 October – Riyadh||3||1\n|19 October – Riyadh||5'''||2\n}}\nSemi-finals\n|score=0–3\n|report=[https://web.archive.org/web/20150913052324/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/confederationscup/saudiarabia1992/matches/round%3D4298/match%3D21302/index.html Report]\n|team2=\n|goals1=\n|goals2=Al-Bishi Al-Thunayan Al-Muwallid\n|stadium=King Fahd International Stadium, Riyadh\n|attendance=70,000\n|referee= Ulisses Tavares da Silva (Brazil) }}\n----\n|score = 4–0\n|report = [https://web.archive.org/web/20150913054814/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/confederationscup/saudiarabia1992/matches/round%3D4298/match%3D21301/index.html Report]\n|team2 =\n|goals1 = Batistuta Altamirano Acosta\n|goals2 =\n|stadium = King Fahd International Stadium, Riyadh\n|attendance = 15,000\n|referee = Jamal Al Sharif (Syria) }}\nThird place match\n|score = 5–2\n|report = [https://web.archive.org/web/20150911231323/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/confederationscup/saudiarabia1992/matches/round%3D4299/match%3D21303/index.html Report]\n|team2=\n|goals1 =Balboa Jones Wynalda Murray\n|goals2 = Traoré Sié\n|stadium = King Fahd International Stadium, Riyadh\n|attendance = 9,500\n|referee = Rodrigo Badilla (Costa Rica) }}\nFinal\n|score = 3–1\n|report = [https://web.archive.org/web/20150912070805/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/confederationscup/saudiarabia1992/matches/round%3D4300/match%3D21304/index.html Report]\n|team2 =\n|goals1 = Rodríguez Caniggia Simeone\n|goals2 = Al-Owairan\n|stadium = King Fahd International Stadium, Riyadh\n|attendance = 75,000\n|referee = Lim Kee Chong (Mauritius) }}\nStatistics\nGoalscorers\nWith two goals, Gabriel Batistuta and Bruce Murray were the top scorers in the tournament.
