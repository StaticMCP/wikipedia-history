Emily Hannemann of TV Insider gave the episode 5 out of 5 stars, writing \" 'In Dreams' is among the show’s best installments, anchored by strong performances and a tragic twist.\" Ray Flook of Bleeding Cool also praised the episode, saying \"it was a very touching and heartbreaking tale of the sacrifices a mother is willing to make for her daughter- and in this case, vice-versa.\"\nDavid S.E. Zapanta from Den of Geek! rated it of 2.5 out of 5 and wrote: \"By the end of the season, I expect we’ll find out what “the cost of peace” really means for our survivors.
