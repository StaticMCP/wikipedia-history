Since then, the PPA's scope has expanded to include parking operations at the Philadelphia International Airport, most street-parking policy enforcement, and regulation and enforcement of taxicabs and limousines.\nThe PPA's status as an agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania rather than the City of Philadelphia allows for the Republican-controlled state authorities to offer patronage positions in the largely Democratic city. The former board chairman Joseph Ashedale has over 10 family members on the agency's payroll.  An audit found the former PPA's director, former Republican state representative Scott Petri, did not meet the minimum qualifications of the job description, and his $210,000 salary was above comparable positions in other cities.\nThe Parking Authority:\n* Generates needed revenue for the city\n* Coordinates the parking efforts of public agencies\n* Builds and operates public parking facilities\n* Does planning and analysis of parking requirements\nto provide full parking services for Philadelphia residents, businesses, and visitors.\nIn popular culture it is the basis of the reality television show Parking Wars.\nPolicies\nOff-street parking\nOriginally, the Parking Authority provided parking garages and parking lots, but various city departments were responsible for on-street parking.\nOn-street parking\nIn 1982, Philadelphia City Council was authorized by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to delegate certain powers formerly exercised by various city departments to the Parking Authority. In April 1983, City Council transferred on-street parking responsibilities to the Authority.\nFunctions transferred from the Streets Department:\n* Location, installation and maintenance of all parking meters throughout the city\n* Preparation of documentation to modify existing or implement new parking regulations, establishing time limits, loading zones, fire hydrant restrictions, reserved parking for people with disabilities, tow-away zones and residential permit parking\n* Preparation of work orders for parking regulations signs\nFunctions transferred from the Revenue Department:\n* Meter Collections\nFunctions transferred from the Police Department:\n* Issuance and processing of parking tickets\n* Towing of motor vehicles\n* Impoundment of motor vehicles\nHowever, both Police Department officers and SEPTA supervisors can issue parking tickets.\nFunctions transferred from the Department of Licenses and Inspections:\n* Issuance of Loading Zone Permits\n* Administration of the Residential Parking Permit Program\nA vast majority of revenue for on-street parking for PPA is generated from ticketing violations (63%) and meter parking (29%). Other revenue categories comprise less than 9% of PPA's on-street parking income. The PPA is also considering punishing unlawful parking in bus and bicycle lanes, as well as \"Ghost Cars\" without license plates.\nBooting\nA program to \"boot\" repeat parking violation offenders was authorized by City Council in 1983.\nTaxicabs and limousines\nThe Authority was authorized by the General Assembly in July 2004 to regulate taxis and limousines operating in the city, and to adopt and enforce regulations for their operations.\nRed Light Camera Program\nThe Authority has been authorized by the General Assembly to administer a pilot red light enforcement program. Cameras are installed at intersections with a high accident rate, and fines are imposed for motorists who run red lights. Notices are sent by mail to offenders, based on photos of license plates and the motorists themselves.\nInspection Expired\nPennsylvania law requires vehicles to display safety and emission inspection stickers, which must be renewed on an annual basis. As these vehicles are parked on a public street, PPA may cite otherwise legally-parked vehicles with expired inspection stickers. Failure to respond to these tickets may result in booting, towing, or the sale at auction of a vehicle repeatedly ticketed for an expired inspection violation.\nStaff\nPPA Executive Staff\n* Executive Director – Richard Lazer\n* Deputy Executive Director – Gabe Roberts\n* Deputy Executive Director – Corinne O'Connor\nBoard Members\nOriginally, the Authority's board of directors was controlled by city officials, but the legislature, acting at the initiative of Representative John Perzel, has shifted control to state officials, including the Governor and officers of the legislature.\n* Lynette M.
