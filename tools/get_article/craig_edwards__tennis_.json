He was the No. 1 player at Ventura High School for two and a half years, then in 1974 began as a freshman at the University of Redlands. An All-American at Redlands in 1973-74 and 1974–75, he later went to Pepperdine University.\nDuring the 1980s, Edwards competed professionally on the Grand Prix tennis circuit, primarily in doubles events. His regular partner was Eddie Edwards, a South African player of no relation, who played with him at Pepperdine. They won a Grand Prix title at Bournemouth in 1980 and were runners-up in a further two Grand Prix tournaments, at Adelaide and Stuttgart the following year. In Grand Slam competition, the pair made the semi-finals of the 1980 Australian Open and lost a match deciding tiebreak to top seeds Peter McNamara and Paul McNamee to miss out on a spot in the final. They earned seedings at subsequent Grand Slam tournaments, including the 1981 Wimbledon Championships. The pair performed well again at the 1981 Australian Open and were quarter-finalists. In singles, Edwards competed in the main draw at the 1981 US Open (first round loss to Roscoe Tanner) and 1982 Australian Open (first round loss to David Pate).\nA family friend of the Bryan brothers, Edwards was a travelling coach for Bob and Mike Bryan in their early years on tour.\nGrand Prix career finals\nDoubles: 3 (1–2)\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!style=\"width:40px\"|Result\n!style=\"width:35px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W-L\n!style=\"width:60px\"|Date\n!style=\"width:180px\"|Tournament\n!style=\"width:50px\"|Surface\n!style=\"width:140px\"|Partner\n!style=\"width:140px\"|Opponents\n!style=\"width:100px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win\n|1.\n|Sep 1980\n|Bournemouth, United Kingdom\n|Clay\n| Eddie Edwards\n| Andrew Jarrett Jonathan Smith\n|6–3, 6–7, 8–6\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss\n|2.\n|Jan 1981\n|Adelaide, Australia\n|Grass\n| Eddie Edwards\n| Colin Dibley John James\n|3–6, 4–6\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss\n|3.\n|Mar 1981\n|Stuttgart, West Germany\n|Hard\n| Eddie Edwards\n| Buster Mottram Nick Saviano\n|6–3, 1–6, 2–6\n|}\nChallenger titles\nDoubles: (1)\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97%\n!width=30|No.\n!width=50|Year\n!width=150|Tournament\n!width=50|Surface\n!width=160|Partner\n!width=160|Opponents\n!style=\"width:100px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n|1.\n|1980\n|Brussels, Belgium\n|Clay\n| Eddie Edwards\n| Doug Adler Chris Johnstone\n|6–1, 6–2\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
