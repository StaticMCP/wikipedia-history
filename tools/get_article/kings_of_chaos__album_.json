It was released in 1999 via Blackend Records, and it was the band's first album to feature Dean Seddon as vocalist (who replaced the former one, Jon Kennedy, who was fired in the same year) and keyboardist Darren \"Daz\" Bishop (who replaced Michael Snell).\nWith this album, Hecate Enthroned greatly toned down their previous symphonic black metal sonority and aesthetics, dropped the corpse paint used on the previous few albums and adopted a style more reminiscent of melodic blackened death metal, albeit still retaining the keyboards and dark black metal melodies of the older albums.\nThe track \"I Am Born\" is the first part of the \"I Am Born\" trilogy; the second part can be heard on 2001's Miasma, and the third one on 2004's Redimus.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n; Hecate Enthroned\n* Dean Seddon — vocals\n* Andy Milnes — guitar\n* Nigel Dennen — guitar\n* Rob Kendrick — drums, percussion\n* Dylan Hughes — bass guitar\n* Darren Bishop — keyboards\n;Additional personnel\n* Pete \"Pee-Wee\" Coleman — production\n* Andrea Wright — engineering\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Hecate_Enthroned/Kings_of_Chaos/3296 Kings of Chaos] at Encyclopaedia Metallum"
