He later became the Bishop of Chichester.  Originally from Wales, Ware served as a canon from the 1390s and then studied law, of which he was made a master, at Oxford University.  He later became an official in the court at Canterbury. He also spent some time in diplomatic missions to France. In early 1418 he was elected bishop of Chichester, and was consecrated in July 1418. He died in July 1420, between the 7th and the 26th.\nEarly life\nWare almost certainly was from Glamorgan in Wales. He probably came from a modest background, as in his will he referred  to a brother and ‘poor kinsfolk’, and to his sister, Margaret, who married one John Hayward. Despite this apparent relative lack of advantage in his early life, Ware went on to   Oxford  University, where he studied law, and was a MA by 1399.\nCareer\nWare's earliest post was in Glamorgan as a canon of Llandaff, by May 1394 and as rector of Marcross by 1398. His career was twofold. He had become  a notary public by 30 July 1398 and was still active in this on 28 February 1402, as he is known to have witnessed an actum by Archbishop Thomas Arundel  at Lambeth. In June 1402 the archbishop appointed him as  scribe  and Henry was soon sitting over legal disputes in the diocese on Arundel's behalf. By July 1408 he was official of the court of Canterbury and he continued in this post till at least 1416.\nWare was appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal, for Henry V, on 11 September 1416.  He was a member of a mission sent, on 12 March 1417, to seek a peace treaty with France and Burgundy. On his return to England he spent some time sorting out various disputes that had arisen in his absence.\nOn 14 May 1414 the crown awarded Ware the Parish of Tring, Hertfordshire.\nOn 28 February 1418 Ware was elected and confirmed by Pope Martin V, to the see of Chichester. Consequently, he was then required to renounce, in the presence of the king, any papal requirements that would be prejudicial to the authority of the crown. He  was consecrated at Pont de l'Arche in Normandy on 17 July 1418.\nAlso in 1418, Ware joined a royal expedition to Normandy, again as part of a diplomatic mission to seek a treaty with the Dauphin on 26 October. He had previously resigned from his position as keeper of the privy seal on 21 September 1418, presumably because of his forthcoming trip to France. Ware was involved in  further talks on 22 January 1419 and 8 March 1419.\nWare evidently returned to England shortly after March 1419 as he was listed at a convocation in October 1419, and he is known to have been in Chichester on 10 December 1419.\nDeath\nWare seems to have become sick on his return to England, as he undertook very little formal business. He made his will on the 7 July 1420 and died shortly afterwards between 7 and 26 July.\nIn his will Ware asked for an ‘old bible’ to be returned to Margam Abbey, and left vestments to St Buruoc's, Barry. He also left money for repairs  to the Bishop's Palace at Chichester.\nWare was buried, as requested, in Chichester Cathedral.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
