The site is situated in a deep chalk combe.\nThe site is owned by Hampshire County Council and managed as a nature reserve jointly by the council and Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust. The woodland glades are kept open by coppicing.\nSite description\nBeech is the dominant tree at this site although on some of the steeper slopes, Yew dominates; on the deeper soils in the valley bottom the woodland has a more open canopy of Ash and Hazel.\nBotanical interest\nThe site's primary interest lies in the fact that it is one of three sites in Britain where Red Helleborine Cephalanthera rubra remains; this orchid grows on a north-west facing slope. The others being Workman's Wood in Gloucestershire and Windsor Hill SSSI, a site in the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire. The species was first found at Hawkley Warren in 1986 by K. Turner and Ralph Hollins.\nOther orchid species found growing under beech at this site include Bird's-nest Orchid, Early Purple Orchid and Narrow-leaved Helleborine; Spurge-laurel is also found.\nRamsons is found in the valley bottom and Herb Paris is also found here.\nInvertebrates\nThe Mountain Bulin snail Ena montana occurs here.\nReferences"
