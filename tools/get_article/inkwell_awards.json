Founding members included artists Tim Townsend, Jim Tournas, Bill Nichols, and writer Daniel Best, with support from artist Adam Hughes and DC Comics editor Mike Marts.\nThe Hall of Fame Award was named in honor of Joe Sinnott.\nIn memory of artist Dave Simons, the Dave Simons Inkwell Memorial Scholarship was established, offering a $1,000 annual award to a Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art student.\nWizard Entertainment sponsored the first live Inkwell Awards presentation at The New England Comic Con in October 2010.  In 2011, Heroes Convention became the host for the annual live presentation ceremony. The Inkwell Awards moved to the Great Philadelphia Comic Con in Oaks, Pennsylvania, in 2019.\nLive awards presentations were suspended from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, the Hershey Comic Con was announced as the new venue for live awards presentations.\nContributors\nThe Inkwell Awards are funded via donations.  In 2010, a book produced by Jimmy Tournas at the Boston Comic Con raised funds for the awards.\nArtist Dan Panosian designed the Inkwell Awards logo. Randy Green designed the Inkwell spokesperson costume.\nAward winners\nMVP Award\n* 2008 Danny Miki\nThe Call of Duty Award\n* 2008 Bob Almond\nFavorite Finisher / Embellisher\n* 2008 (retro)Tom Palmer/ (modern) Kevin Nowlan\nMost-Prolific Inker\n* 2008 Danny Miki\nFavorite Inker\nFavorite ink artists over the pencil work of another artist from award year cover-dated, interior, American comic book material.\n* 2008 (retro) Terry Austin and Joe Sinnott (tie) / (modern) Danny Miki\n* 2009 Wade Von Grawbadger\n* 2010 Mark Morales\n* 2011 Scott Hanna\n* 2012 Mark Farmer\n* 2013 Klaus Janson\n* 2014 Norm Rapmund\n* 2015 Victor Olazaba\n* 2016 Joe Prado\n* 2017 Scott Hanna\n* 2018 Scott Hanna\n* 2019 Walden Wong\n* 2020 Walden Wong\n* 2021 Ruy José\n* 2022 Eber Ferreira\n* 2023 Walden Wong\n* 2024 Wade Von Grawbadger\n* 2025 Elisabetta D'Amico\nMost-Adaptable InkerInk artist \"showing ink style versatility\" in award year interior, cover-dated, American comic book material.\n* 2008 Danny Miki\n* 2009 Tim Townsend\n* 2010 Scott Hanna\n* 2011 Scott Hanna\n* 2012 Scott Hanna\n* 2013 Jonathan Glapion\n* 2014 Walden Wong\n* 2015 Walden Wong\n* 2016 Walden Wong\n* 2017 Walden Wong\n* 2018 Scott Hanna\n* 2019 Walden Wong\n* 2020 Walden Wong\n* 2021 Norm Rapmund\n* 2022 Norm Rapmund\n* 2023 Walden Wong\n* 2024 Elisabetta D'Amico\n* 2025 Elisabetta D'Amico\nProps Award\nInk artists \"deserving of more attention\" for their work from award year interior cover-dated American comic book material.\n* 2008 Danny Miki\n* 2009 Matt Ryan\n* 2010 Jonathan Glapion\n* 2011 Art Thibert\n* 2012 Scott Hanna\n* 2013 Eber Ferreira\n* 2014 Walden Wong\n* 2015 Wade Von Grawbadger\n* 2016 Wade Von Grawbadger\n* 2017 Scott Hanna\n* 2018 Joe Prado\n* 2019 Elisabetta D'Amico\n* 2020 Eber Ferreira\n* 2021 Eber Ferreira\n* 2022 Tim Townsend\n* 2023 Adriano Di Benedetto\n* 2024 Elisabetta D'Amico\n* 2025 Adriano Di Benedetto\nThe \"SPAMI\" Award (Small Press and Mainstream-Independent)\nFavorite Small Press And Mainstream-Independent award year interior, cover-dated, American comic book ink work over another pencil artist (non-Marvel or DC work).\n* 2009 Tim Townsend\n* 2010 Dan Parsons\n* 2011 Cliff Rathburn\n* 2012 Dexter Vines\n* 2013 Sal Buscema\n* 2014 Andrew Pepoy\n* 2015 Dan Parsons\n* 2016 Stefano Gaudiano\n* 2017 Jonathan Glapion\n* 2018 Sal Buscema\n* 2019 Stefano Gaudiano\n* 2020 Stefano Gaudiano\n* 2021 Adelso Corona\n* 2022 Adelso Corona\n* 2023 David Cabeza\n* 2024 Terry Moore\n* 2025 Tony Kordos\nThe All-in-One Award\nArtists known for inking their own pencil work in award year interior, cover-dated, American comic book material.\n* 2009 Mike Mignola\n* 2010 Amanda Conner\n* 2011 Francis Manapul\n* 2012 J.H.
