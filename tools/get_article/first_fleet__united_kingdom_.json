The numbered fleets during this period had different levels of battle readiness; ships of the First Fleet ships were in full commission.\nThe First Fleet included four destroyer flotillas under Captain Cecil Lambert. Captain Reginald Tyrwhitt took over the command of the destroyer flotillas in December 1913.\nCommanders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! Rank !! Flag !! Name !!
