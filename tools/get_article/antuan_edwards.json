During the course of the year, he made a total of thirty tackles (twenty-six solo), had four interceptions including one returned for a touchdown, and was named to the College & Pro Football Weekly'' All-Rookie team. The following season, he started three games but saw his tackle total go down to twenty-five, while defending nine passes and two interceptions. Edwards only played in three games in 2001 when he suffered a knee injury and was placed on injured reserve. In 2002, he started the season as the team's starting safety, but was replaced early on by rookie Marques Anderson following a forearm injury.
