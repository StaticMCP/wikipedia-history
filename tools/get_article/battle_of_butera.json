      "text": "# Battle of Butera\n\nThe Battle of Butera happened in late 845 or early 846 between the Aghlabid army and the Byzantine army at Butera, south of Sicily. The Aghlabids achieved a resounding success against the Byzantines.\nIn 845, the Byzantines and the Abbasids made a peace treaty. The Byzantine empress, Theodora, wanting to take advantage of the peace treaty, dispatched an army to re-establish Byzantine control of Sicily. The Byzantine army was mostly recruited from the theme of Charsianon. The Byzantine numbers were substantial and were equipped and ready to fight. The Byzantine general, however, was not ready. Both sides met at Butera, and the Aghlabid general, Al-Abbas ibn al-Fadl, defeated the Byzantines and killed 9,000 to 10,000 of their troops, according to Arab sources, which is probably an exaggeration. The Aghlabid casualties were insignificant. The battle happened either in late 845 or early 846.\nFollowing this defeat, the Byzantines suffered several setbacks in quick succession. In 846, the Arabs annexed Lentini and destroyed Ragusa in 848. For his victory at Butera, Al-Abbas became the governor of Sicily in 851.\nReferences\nSources\n*Andrew Holt & Florin Curta (2016), Great Events in Religion, An Encyclopedia of Pivotal Events in Religious History.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ouTNEAAAQBAJ&dq=battle+of+Butera+845+or+846&pg=PT650]\n*John Bagnell Bury, A history of the Eastern Roman empire [https://books.google.com/books?id=svPkt-TIHK0C&dq=butera+845&pg=PA306]\n*Alexander A.
