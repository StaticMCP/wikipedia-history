J. Owen' York (Northern Rugby League.) E. J. Owen was born in Crumlin, and is proving his worth as a full back. He was discovered by Leeds officials, but the Headingley club with a great wealth of talent allowed him to go to York. He is a brilliant defensive player, and can kick with great power with either foot. He is also a great goalkeeper. Owen has been unfortunate in coming to hand when there were so many full backs of ability in the league. He was, however, selected as reserve to Sullivan for the Wales and England match in 1926.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/search/?q=Owen Search for \"Owen\" at rugbyleagueproject.org]"
