He studied at Oxford, where he met his future wife, Barbara. He taught at Ruskin College whilst working on his PhD.\nInitially, Ward concentrated his studies on eighteenth century British history but the bulk of his work concerned religious history. He was one of the co-editors on the definitive, scholarly edition of John Wesley's works.\nHe was a Member of the Chetham Society, serving as a Member of Council (1964-2010), Secretary (1964–84), President (1984–92), and Vice-President (1993-2010). He was a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and British Academy and also President of the Ecclesiastical History Society (1970–71).\nWorks\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=bi84AAAAMAAJ&q=ward%20Georgian%20Oxford:%20University%20Politics%20in%20the%20Eighteenth%20Century Georgian Oxford: University Politics in the Eighteenth Century] (Clarendon Press, 1958).\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=bRhqDAAAQBAJ Victorian Oxford] (Routledge, 1965).\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=bq0lAQAAMAAJ&q=ward%20Religion%20%26%20Society%20in%20England:%201790-1850 Religion & Society in England: 1790-1850] (HarperCollins, 1972).\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhkLD9t4GO0C The Protestant Evangelical Awakening] (Cambridge University Press, 1992).\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=aujIv_WLE9YC Christianity under the Ancien Régime, 1648-1789] (Cambridge University Press, 1999).\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=lE2oIwml-fQC Early Evangelicalism: A Global Intellectual History, 1670-1789] (Cambridge University Press, 2006).\nNotes"
