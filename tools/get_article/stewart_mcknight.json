He played seven first-class matches for Otago between the 1958–59 and 1966–67 seasons.\nMcKnight grew up on the family property at Ranfurly in Central Otago, where his father died in 1940 while mining for gold. He was educated at Otago Boys' High School in Dunedin and later farmed the property.\nAs well as playing first-class cricket for Otago, McKnight played Hawke Cup cricket for Central Otago from the 1963–64 season to 1976–77. He captained Central Otago against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club in 1960–61 at Alexandra, top-scoring with 48 in the second innings. He took part in a world tour with a New Zealand Cricket Council side in 1964, playing in 11 countries.\nMcKnight was also a rugby union referee, and represented New Zealand at curling. He was a life member of both the Otago Cricket Association and the Otago Rugby Football Union and was a cricket selector for Otago. His son, Ken McKnight, played for both Central Otago and Otago during the 1980s and 90s.\nMcKnight died at Ranfurly in 2021. He was aged 85.\nReferences"
