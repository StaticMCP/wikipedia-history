It was previously housed in Nissan's Oppama and was also known as the Nissan DNA Museum.\nUp until 2013–2014, the collection was entirely private, with no public access whatsoever. By 2018, it had welcomed a total of 15.000 visitors.\nDescription\nThe museum focuses on restoration and safekeeping of Datsun, Prince and Nissan cars, and is curated by former Nissan career employees. The facility houses more than 450 cars dating as far back as the 1930s. 70% of the cars in the collection are in drivable condition. 300 cars are on permanent display. The exhibition is curated by David Bishop, Senior Manager at Nissan.\nVisits to the facility are limited. Visitors must register for a visit online and wait for an approval.
