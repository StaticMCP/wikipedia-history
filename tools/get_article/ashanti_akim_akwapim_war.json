This battle was not a direct war on Akyem states, which were never subdued by any power, but a war to get access to the coasts in which the Akyem along with Akuapem forces allied for.\nIn 1814 the Ashanti, under the leadership of Asantehene Osei Bonsu, defeated the outnumbered Akim-Akwapim alliance.\nAfter attacking the Fante during this period, the Ashanti seized Accra and took over Fante country, turning it into an Ashanti province.\nAfter the war and with access to the coast the Ashanti followed up their victory by pillaging the coastal Ga people.\nSee also\n*Empire of Ashanti\n*Ashanti-Fante War\n*Ga-Fante War\n*Anglo-Asante Wars\n*History of Ghana\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.san.beck.org/1-14-Africa1800-1875.html#5 Sanderson Beck: Asante, British and the Gold Coast]"
