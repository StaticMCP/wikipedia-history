      "text": "# John Edward Lloyd\n\nSir John Edward Lloyd (5 May 1861 &ndash; 20 June 1947) was a Welsh historian.\nEarly life and education\nJohn Edward Lloyd was born in Liverpool on 5 May 1861. He was educated in the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth (which later become the University of Wales, Aberystwyth), which he left in 1881, and Lincoln College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1883 with a first class honours degree. Upon leaving Oxford in 1883, he obtained an academic position in his alma mater in Aberystwyth teaching history. In 1891 he applied for the post of College Principal. However, his application was unsuccessful, which prompted him to look for an academic post elsewhere, which he obtained shortly afterwards in Bangor University.\nLloyd married Clementina (Tina) Miller within a year of arriving in Bangor, and they had two children, Edmund and Eluned. He was knighted in 1934.\nCareer\nLloyd became a much-published and famous Welsh historian. He wrote the first serious history of the country's formative years, A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest (1911) and Owen Glendower/Owain Glyn Dŵr (1931). And he was the first editor of 'Y Bywgraffiadur Cymreig', which was published posthumously in 1953. Its English counterpart, the Dictionary of Welsh Biography, was published in 1959 with Robert Thomas Jenkins as its sole editor.\nPublications\nThe following publications are a selection of Lloyd's published output.
