During this march, a force under Raja Gurdat Mal and Lakhpat Rai assisted by the Dogra Dynasty was despatched and met face to face with the Sikhs in the villages of Sodhra and Badra.\nBattle\nGurdit Mal commanded 5,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry while the strength of the Sikhs was not more than 2,000. This is why during the battle, Hari Singh Bhangi advised the Sikhs to fight with their swords since a gun battle was out of question. Therefore, the Sikhs made a sudden run with swords towards the enemy and gave them a surprised attack, which inflicted heavy losses to the enemy. Gurdit Mal barely made it out alive and retreating along with his army.\nAftermath\nRight after this battle, the Sikhs took advantage by the recent Mughal-Afghan conflict and fought the Mughals when they didn't expect it. A week after the battle, Adina Beg was defeated by the Sikhs in a battle near Khanpur and they also reoccupied Amritsar in the Siege of Amritsar (1748).\nReferences\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism"
