      "text": "# Kongemose culture\n\nThe Kongemose culture (Kongemosekulturen)  was a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer culture in southern Scandinavia ca. 6000 BC–5200 BC  and the origin of the Ertebølle culture. It was preceded by the Maglemosian culture. In the north it bordered on the Scandinavian Nøstvet and Lihult cultures.\nThe Kongemose culture is named after a location in western Zealand and its typical form is known from Denmark and Skåne. The finds are characterised by long flintstone flakes, used for making characteristic rhombic arrowheads, scrapers, drills, awls, and toothed blades. Tiny micro blades constituted the edges of bone daggers that were often decorated with geometric patterns. Stone axes were made of a variety of stones, and other tools were made of horn and bone. The main economy was based on hunting red deer, roe deer, and wild boar, supplemented by fishing at the coastal settlements.\nGenetics\nSee also\nReferences\nOther sources\n*Clark, Grahame  (2009) The Earlier Stone Age Settlement of Scandinavia (Cambridge University Press)"
