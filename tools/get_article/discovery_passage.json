The strait is considered the most important natural passage for vessels entering or leaving the Salish Sea from the north.\nEtymology\nThe strait was named by Captain Vancouver in 1792 after his ship, . Other sources say that the passage was named by Captain Kellett because Vancouver's Discovery had sailed through the passage earlier.\nGeography\nThe strait has a length of  and an average width of , narrowing to only  at Seymour Narrows. Most of the eastern shoreline of the passage is Quadra Island, with Sonora Island forming the shoreline at the northern end where Discovery Passage meets Johnstone Strait. The southern end of Discovery Passage enters the Strait of Georgia, the northern arm of the Salish Sea, at Campbell River, British Columbia.\nThe strait is frequently transited by cruise ships, cargo ships, fishing boats, and ships of the Alaska Marine Highway and BC Ferries systems.\nSee also\n* Cordero Channel\n* Sutil Channel\nReferences\nExternal links"
