It lies approximately  north of Puck and  north of the regional capital Gdańsk. It is located on the Bay of Puck within the historic region of Pomerania.\nHistory\nSwarzewo was a royal village of the Polish Crown, administratively located in Puck County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.\nDuring the German occupation of Poland (World War II), Swarzewo was one of the sites of executions of Poles, carried out by the Germans in 1939 as part of the Intelligenzaktion, and in 1942 the Germans expelled several Polish families, whose farms were then handed over to German colonists as part of the Lebensraum policy. The expelled Poles were enslaved as forced labour to serve Germans in other villages in the region.\nReferences"
