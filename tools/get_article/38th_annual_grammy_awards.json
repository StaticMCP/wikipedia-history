The awards recognized accomplishments by musicians from the previous year. Alanis Morissette was the main recipient, being awarded four trophies, including Album of the Year. Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men opened the show with their Record of the Year nominated \"One Sweet Day\".\nThe ceremony was controversial for its unexpected snub of Mariah Carey's Daydream album, which proved to be one of the bestselling and most acclaimed albums of 1995. When the Grammy Award nominees were announced, and Daydream was nominated for six different awards, critics began raving how it would be \"cleaning up\" that year. Carey, being a multiple award nominee, was one of the headlining performers. Together with Boyz II Men, she sang a live rendition of \"One Sweet Day\", to a very positive response. The album had lost all of its six nominations, shocking most critics who branded it the \"album of the year\". Carey did not perform again until the 2006 ceremony, when she was nominated for eight awards (winning three) for The Emancipation of Mimi.\nThe ceremony is also significant for Tupac Shakur introducing Peter Criss, Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons, and Paul Stanley of Kiss for the first time in full makeup and costume since 1979. Shakur said \"And I've seen just about everything now,\" in response to seeing Kiss walk on stage to announce the nominees  for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal.\nPerformers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n|Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men\n|\"One Sweet Day\"\n|-\n|Annie Lennox\n|\"Train in Vain\"\n|-\n|Coolio\n|\"Gangsta's Paradise\"\n|-\n|Alanis Morissette\n|\"You Oughta Know\"\n|-\n|Seal\n|\"Kiss from a Rose\"\n|-\n|TLC\n|\"Waterfalls\"\n|-\n|Joan Osborne\n|\"One of Us\"\n|-\n|Shania Twain\n|\"Any Man of Mine\"\n|-\n|The Mavericks\n|\"All You Ever Do is Bring Me Down\"\n|-\n|Hootie & the Blowfish\n|\"I'm Going Home\"\n|-\n|Dwight Yoakam\n|\"Fast As You\"\n|-\n|Maxim Vengerov\n|\"Shostakovich: Violin Concerto No. 1\"\n|-\n|Seal & Annie Lennox\n|\"What's Going On\" (Tribute to Marvin Gaye)\n|-\n|CeCe Winans, Whitney Houston & Shirley Caesar\n|Medley:\n* \"I Surrender All\"\n* \"Count on Me\"\n* \"Heaven\"\n|}\nPresenters\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Presenter(s)\n!Award(s)\n|-\n|Anita Baker\n|Lifetime Achievement Award to Stevie Wonder\n|-\n|Timothy Hutton\n|Lifetime Achievement Award to Dave Brubeck\n|-\n|Sheryl Crow & Andy Garcia\n|Best Pop Vocal Album\n|-\n|Shania Twain & Patty Loveless\n|Best Male Country Vocal Performance\n|-\n|The Mavericks\n|Best Female Country Vocal Performance\n|-\n|Lisa Kudrow & Chris Isaak\n|Best Hard Rock Performance\n|-\n|Mary J.
