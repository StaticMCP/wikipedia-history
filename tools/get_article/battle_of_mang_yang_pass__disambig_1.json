The battle was one of the bloodiest defeats of the French Union forces, along with the battle of Dien Bien Phu shortly beforehand.\nBackground\nGroupement Mobile No. 100 (\"Group Mobile 100\" or G.M. 100) was a regimental task force unit of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps which was assembled as a convoy. It included the elite veteran UN Bataillon de Corée who fought in the Korean War at Chipyong-ni, Wonju and Heartbreak Ridge. It had already suffered a defeat at the Siege of Đắk Đoa in February 1954. In addition, anxious to avoid a second disaster like the siege at Dien Bien Phu, the French Chief of Staff ordered G.M. 100 to abandon their isolated position in the Central Highlands. This was code named opération Églantine.\nAmbush\nOn 24 June 1954, G.M. 100 received orders to abandon its defensive positions at An Khê and fall back to Pleiku, some  away over Route Coloniale 19. At the road marker 'Kilometer 15' the column was ambushed by Việt Minh troops belonging to the 803rd Regiment and suffered heavy losses. The remains of G.M. 100 managed to break through the ambush. The remnants of G.M. 100, now with G.M. 42 and the 1st Airborne Group, had to drive through  of Viet Minh controlled road. The column was ambushed again on 28 June and 29 at Dak Ya-Ayun by the Việt Minh 108th Regiment, suffering heavy losses. The survivors finally reached Pleiku the following day.\nIn five days of fighting, G.M. 100 lost 85 percent of its vehicles, all of its artillery, 68 percent of its signal equipment and half of its crew-served weapons. The Headquarters Company had only 84 men left out of an original 222. The 43rd Colonial and the 1st and the 2nd Korea Battalions, which numbered about 834 men each, were now mustered at roll call with 452, 497, and 345 men respectively. The 2nd Group of the 10th Colonial Artillery, reduced to fighting as infantry after the loss of all of their guns, had shrunk from 475 men to 215 men during the fighting. Colonel Barrou and several men were taken as prisoners of war. The Việt Minh 96th Regiment suffered more than 100 killed in comparison.\nFile:Dak Po ambush1.jpg|French vehicles lay abandoned or destroyed.

On 17 July the column was ambushed at Chu Dreh Pass by local units of the Việt Minh 96th Regiment. When the survivors finally arrived at Ban Mê Thuột the following day, there were only 107 men remaining out of 452, of those 53 were wounded, in addition a further 47 vehicles were lost.\nThree days after the ambush at Chu-Dreh the Geneva agreements were signed. On 1 August an armistice went into effect.\nOrder of battle\nFrench Union forces\nThe G.M.s (Groupement Mobile) were designed as self-sustaining motorized regimental task force unit modelled on the U.S. Army's World War II regimental combat teams. The G.M.s typically consisted of three infantry battalions with one artillery battalion, along with elements of light armor or tanks, engineer, signal and medical assets, totaling 3,000–3,500 soldiers.\nUnits in the G.M.100 included:\n*Korea Regiment, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Korea Battalions formed from the elite veteran UN Bataillon de Corée.\n*The Bataillon de Marche of the 43rd Colonial Infantry Regiment.\n* 520th TDKQ (Tiểu-đoàn Khinh-quân), a light battalion from the Vietnamese National Army as part of An Khê garrison.\n*2nd Group of 10th Colonial Artillery Regiment.\n* (less) 3rd Squadron of 5th \"Royal Poland\" Armored Cavalry Regiment – these were in reserve in Pleiku when GM 100 left An Khê [https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220118/http://www.penseemiliterre.fr/ankhe-centre-annam-24-juin-1954-extraction-difficile-ou-embuscade-annoncee_1012505.html]\nViệt Minh forces\nThe Việt Minh 96th Regiment included:\n* 40th Battalion (three infantry companies).\n* 79th Battalion (less) (two infantry companies).\n* Two weapon companies (mortars, recoilless guns and bomb-launchers).\nIn popular culture\nThe opening scene of the movie We Were Soldiers – about the Ia Drang valley battle in Nov. 1965 – alludes to the destruction of Groupement Mobile 100. The US troops started out of An Khê as well, where they had established Camp Radcliff.\nThe battle is referred to in the novel Incident at Muc Wa and depicted, but not identified, in its movie adaptation Go Tell the Spartans.\nReferences\nSources\n* Fall, Bernard, Street Without Joy: The French Debacle in Indochina.
