The Vikings where initially friendly with the Natives (called \"Skraeling\" in the Vikings language) they would incounter during trade and the Vikings would usually trade cloth for some animal fur because Karlsefni (A icelandic/Nordic explorer who was the leader of the colony) forbade his men to trade for weapons with the natives. This peaceful trade ended when a Viking killed a Native, making the other natives retreat but not long after they came back in large numbers, armed with weapons, and hostile. The Natives  charged at the Nordic settlement but the Vikings saw them coming and they fought back. Karlsefni's men managed to fight off the large attacking force and killed 4 natives while only losing 2 men during the battle making the natives retreat, which ment it was a victory for Karlsefni and his men. This battle lead to many other fierce battles between natives and Vikings. Due to all the fighting in that one settlement it would have to be abandoned and the Vikings would later have to return to Greenland or another Nordic territory."
