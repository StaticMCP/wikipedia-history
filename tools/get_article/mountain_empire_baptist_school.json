Started in 2001, it was member of the Tennessee Association of Christian Schools.\nWith old fashioned style worship and preaching from the King James Bible (1611), it was a Baptist school without apologizing for doctrine, heritage, nor for zeal.\nTheir goal was to not take the place of the Christian home, but seek to complement it. The curriculum used for all grades was A Beka. Subjects were taught from a Biblical viewpoint and were based upon the firm foundation of spiritual truth. Social development was encouraged through the teaching of good manners, high moral standards, respect for parents and authority, and patriotism.\nAthletics\n8 man football\n2007 TAACS Tennessee State Champions\nMEBS Retired Numbers\n11  - Andrew King  06-10 Basketball(all-time leading scorer), Football, Baseball\n10 - Charli Fricker volleyball, basketball.\nReferences"
