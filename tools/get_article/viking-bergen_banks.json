At this time, Viking-Bergen would have been an island surrounded by a shallow sea. If sea levels reached the lowest projected level, the formation may have existed for some time as hills at the northernmost extent of Doggerland; these hills would have been east of the Shetland hills, now the Shetland islands. Viking-Bergen may have been occupied during the Bølling–Allerød warming based on a hypothetical piece of worked flint found near the banks. The island was inundated by the North Sea by about 12,000 years BP although it's possible that Viking-Bergen remained an island into the early Holocene.\nReferences"
