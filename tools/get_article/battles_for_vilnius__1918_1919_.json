The fighting resulted in the temporary capture of most of the city of Vilnius by the Poles, who eventually had to retreat before the Red Army came. Some historians consider this as the beginning of the Polish–Soviet war.\nBackground\nIn the early 20th century, Vilnius (; ), was a part of the Russian Empire until 1915, when the city came under German occupation after a successful German offensive. In late 1918, German soldiers withdrew from the occupied lands of the former Russian Empire, and their place was taken by the Bolsheviks.\nAt that time, Vilnius was the subject of a territorial dispute between the newly emerging states of the region - Belarusian People's Republic, the Republic of Lithuania, and the Republic of Poland. From March 1918, the government of Lithuania resided in the city, and from early December also the government of the BPR. On December 15, the Vilnius Soviet of Workers Deputies was also established in the city. The Republic of Lithuania, which, considering it the heir to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, claimed the right to include the city within its borders \"for historical reasons\". At the beginning of December, the government of the Belarusian People's Republic, headed by Anton Lutskevich, also arrived in Vilnius, forced to leave Minsk due to its occupation by the Bolsheviks. The Belarusian government also considered Vilnius as part of its territory, but at that time it sought strategic rapprochement with Lithuania, considering the Belarusian-Lithuanian territorial disputes as a matter to be resolved later.\n]]\nThe dominant national group living in Vilnius, apart from Jews, were Poles. Even before Poland gained independence, part of the Polish population of the Vilnius region was preparing to join these lands to the emerging country. The formation of Polish military formations in Vilnius began on September 10, 1918, under the patronage of the Union of Military Poles (ZWP). A Citizens' Committee was established, which in turn appointed a Public Safety Committee. Capt.  participated in its work on behalf of the ZWP in Vilnius. An attempt was made to bring together the Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian and Jewish people to defend themselves against the approaching Bolsheviks, but it failed. Therefore, the newly established Polish Self-Defense of Lithuania and Belarus intended to defend the city on its own. From December 8, this formation was commanded by General Władysław Wejtko, who attempted to transform it into a regular army. It included the Vilnius Self-Defense, commanded by General .\nAt the end of December 1918, it numbered approximately 1,200 volunteers, residents of the city and surrounding areas, from whom two infantry regiments and one uhlan regiment were formed. The Polish Military Organisation (POW) in Vilnius was active under the leadership of .\nOn December 29, 1918, the Polish authorities in Warsaw, as part of the reorganization, dissolved the Self-Defense of Lithuania and Belarus and invited its members to join the ranks of the Polish Army. Władysław Wejtko was appointed commander of the Military District of Lithuania and Belarus,  - military commandant of Vilnius, Stanisław Bobiatyński - his deputy and  – chief of staff. The Vilnius Self-Defense was transformed into the 1st Brigade, and General Bolesław Krejczmer became its commander. These formations, however, retained a character more similar to volunteer self-defence than a regular army. Polish troops in Vilnius were ordered to act independently in case the Red Army attempted to enter the city.\nPreparation to the defense of Vilnius by Lithuanian-Belarusian forces\nAs the Bolsheviks were approaching Vilnius, Lithuanians and Belarusians made joint efforts to form troops to defend the city. The Lithuanian government appointed a Belarusian General Kyprian Kandratovich to the position of deputy minister of national defense, entrusting him with the task of creating a Lithuanian army with Belarusian troops in it. At the beginning of December, the formation of the 1st Belarusian Infantry Regiment (1 BPP) began in Vilnius, commanded by Col. M. Ławrentiew, battalion commanders - Col. Leniwow (a few days later dismissed from the 1st BPP) and Lt. Col. Uspensky, company commanders - Capt. Eugeniusz Hajdukiewicz, lieutenants Piatko, Żywotkiewicz and Talkowski. At the end of December, the following officers joined the regiment: Siatkowski, Hasan Konopacki, Dawid Jakubowski, Remiszewski and Łukaszewicz. The formation of the headquarters of the 2nd Belarusian Infantry Regiment also began. However, these actions turned out to be insufficient to defend Vilnius against the Bolsheviks. At the end of December, the Lithuanian army was just in the process of being formed, and its seeds were being formed in Kaunas, Alytus and Kėdainiai. The Belarusian troops in Vilnius had only officers and no privates. Therefore, on December 27, 1918, Belarusian military formations along with most members of the BRL government left Vilnius and evacuated to Grodno, which remained under German occupation.\nPolish forces\nAt the end of December, the Polish 1st Brigade (self-defence) in Vilnius had the following structure:\n*1st Vilnius Uhlan Regiment (commander: Capt.  ; from November 30 to December 25, 1918, the Vilnius Self-Defense Uhlan Squadron)\n*1st Battalion (Commander: sub-captain Witold Szczerbicki)\n*2nd Battalion (commander : Mikołaj Zujewicz)\n*3rd Battalion (commander: Lieutenant Edward Kaczkowski ; composed of Poles - former German soldiers)\n*4th POW Battalion (commander: Lt. Jan Gołębiowski)\n*Recruit Battalion (commander: Capt. Władysław Piasecki).\nThey were soon joined by the Officers' Legion.\nThe Battle\nThe Polish capture of the city\nPolish self-defense\n| combatant2        =  Germany\n| combatant3        =  Vilnius Soviet\n| units1            = Vilnius self-defense\n| units2            = Ober Ost\n| units3            = Vilnius Soviet of Workers Deputies\n| commander1        =  Władysław Wejtko\n| commander2        = unknown\n| commander3        = unknown\n}}\nBy the end of 1918, regular Polish Army units failed to reach Vilnius. The reason was the difficulties created by the Germans in the territory they occupied, separating Vilnius from Poland. Polish self-defence units in Vilnius, anticipating that the Germans would hand over Vilnius to the Bolsheviks on January 5, decided to independently take control of the city and remove German troops from it. On December 31, 1918, the commander of the Military District of Lithuania and Belarus, General Władysław Wejtko, issued a mobilization order in which he said:\nOn the same day, the first fighting broke out in Vilnius. The 3rd Battalion captured the Vilnius Town Hall. Skirmishes also took place in other parts of the city, in the area of the Gate of Dawn, where Polish soldiers began disarming German soldiers. As a result of the negotiations, the German command agreed to hand over part of the city to the Polish formations, while retaining control over the street Wielka Pohulanka (now ) and the Vilnius railway station. On January 1, 1919, the Polish-German demarcation line was established. On the same day, the Polish military commandant of Vilnius, General Adam Mokrzecki, who took power in the city, issued a proclamation to the inhabitants calling for order, and also:\nThe Lithuanian government limited itself to the symbolic gesture of hanging Lithuanian flag over the Vilnius Castle Hill, and then on January 1 it also evacuated with the Germans by train to Kaunas. The reason for the evacuation of the Lithuanian government was not only the approach of the Bolsheviks to the city but also the fear that after the Poles established themselves there, its further work would be very difficult or impossible.\nWładysław Dąbrowski became the actual commander of the Polish self-defence forces on his initiative and only later formally received this position from General Wejtka. The Germans decided to evacuate the city and did not resist the Polish forces. On the night of January 2-3, Polish scouts, railway workers and POW members took over the Vilnius railway station.\nSiege of the Vilnius Soviet on Jakšto Street\nPolish self-defense\n| combatant2        =  Vilnius Soviet\n| commander1        =  Władysław Wejtko  W.

Cichowski\n| date              = 1 January 1919\n}}\nAs German soldiers evacuated from Vilnius, the socialist movements attempted to take power in the city and held elections to the Vilnius Soviet of Workers Deputies in mid-December. In the last days of the German occupation, the Soviet held two sessions, and declared itself the only legal authority in the city and issued the first decrees; its headquarters was in a building at Wronia Street. The Soviet preparing for an armed confrontation with the Polish self-defence,  proceeded to organize a workers militia. The chairman of the Council was Kazimierz Cichowski, former secretary of the Petrograd group of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), and the secretary of the praesidium was Jan Kulikowski, a Pole from Trakai County, member of SDKPiL and the Communist Workers' Party of Poland; its headquarters was in a building at Wronia (now Jakšto) Street. The Soviet was of a mixed nature; the largest but not dominant faction was the Bolsheviks, balanced by Mensheviks, Bundists, Lithuanian Social Democrats and other groups.\nOn January 1, 1919, Polish self-defence units under the command of Capt. Dąbrowski (2nd Battalion and about 30 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion) surrounded the Soviet, which had barricaded the Workers' Club building at Wronia 5.)}} At around 11 pm the leader of the Polish forces, General Władysław Wejtko, issued an ultimatum to surrender which the Soviet refused. The fight lasted for over twelve hours, which ended with the surrender of the Vilnius Soviet at 2 PM. As a result of the siege on the Polish side, 1 soldier was killed}} and 4 were wounded. On the defenders' side, 3 combatants died, 5 committed suicide, and 76-100 were taken prisoner. The suiciders included: the commandant of the people's militia, Leonas Čaplinskis, Antanas Liaudanskas, Jankelis Šapira, Julius Simelevičius (Brother of Boris Shimeliovich)  and the Vilnius shoemaker, Bonifacas Verbickas.  Roman Pilar attempted to shoot himself, but survived. Moreover, Polish self-defence soldiers captured over 1,000 rifles and 600 grenades, mainly German ones. On January 9, 1919, after the Red Army captured Vilnius, a ceremonial burial for the deceased members of the Vilnius Soviet was organized at the Cathedral Square. During the post-World War II Soviet era, Wronia Street (Later Dąbrowski Street) was renamed Komunarų Street in memory of the five men.\nThe first attack of the Red Army on Vilnius\nPolish self-defense\n| combatant2        =  Bolsheviks\n| commander1        =  Władysław Wejtko\n| commander2        =  Vladimir Olderogge\n| casualties1       = Heavy\n| casualties2       = Heavy\n| date              = 4 January 1919\n}}\nOn January 2, the Soviet Western Army approached Vilnius from three directions: from Nemenčinė, Maladzyechna and Lida. The commander of the Polish self-defence forces, Władysław Wejtko, led some of the forces (part of the Vilnius Uhlan Regiment, the 3rd Battalion and the Officer's Legion) to the area of Naujoji Vilnia to block the enemy's movement there. Meanwhile, the rest of the Vilnius Uhlan Regiment, the 1st Battalion, the 4th POW Battalion and other small units remained in Vilnius, under the command of Capt. Władysław Dąbrowski.\nThe order to capture Vilnius was given to the 2nd Rifle Brigade of Vladimir Olderogge's Pskov Division, which was in the Pabradė area on January 1. For this task, it was reinforced with the 5th Vilnius Regiment under the command of A. Zienkowicz. At the same time, the 144th and 146th Regiments of the 17th Rifle Division of Grigory Maksymovich Borzinsky and a unit separated from the Western Division of Vladimir Alekseevich Yershov were heading from Molodechno to Vilnius. To complete the task of capturing Vilnius, the 2nd Rifle Brigade's command sent the 4th Regiment through Pabradė to Mickūnai, so that, together with the 1st Regiment, it occupied the railway station in Naujoji Vilnia. In turn, the 5th Vilnius Regiment was sent from Pabradė through Nemenčinė to Vilnius. Bolshevik troops were ordered to suppress Polish resistance by force.\nOn January 4, 1919, the first battles with the attacking Red Army took place near Naujoji Vilnia. The Bolsheviks sent there the 1st Battalion and, moving to the right of it, two companies of the 4th Battalion of the Pskov regiment under Mokhnachev's command. The Polish cavalry suffered losses and was forced to withdraw. The infantry tried to counterattack Naujoji Vilnia, but this attempt failed. Regular units of the Red Army had a significant advantage over improvised, irregular Polish self-defence units. Moreover, the Poles had very limited supplies of ammunition and no prepared defensive positions on the approaches to the city or in the city itself. At the same time, the Bolsheviks sent the 5th Vilnius Regiment to directly attack Vilnius. General Władysław Wejtko decided to withdraw Polish troops from Naujoji Vilnia to Vilnius. Shortly afterwards, they encountered German forces on Wielka Pohulanka Street, as a result of which the Poles suffered further losses, including officers. The Bolsheviks attacked the city mainly from the direction of Naujoji Vilnia and Nemenčinė. The self-defence formations were forced to retreat to the city centre, where, thanks to combining forces, they repelled the attack of the Red Army.\nThe second attack of the Red Army on Vilnius\nPolish self-defense\n| combatant2        =  Bolsheviks\n| commander1        =  Władysław Wejtko Jerzy Dąbrowski\n| commander2        =  Vladimir Olderogge\n| casualties1       = Heavy\n| casualties2       = Unknown\n| date              = 5 January 1919\n| units1            = 1st Self defense battalion2nd Self defense battalion3rd Self defense battalion4th Self defense battalion\n| units2            = Unknown\n| territory         = Vilnius is occupied by the Red Army\n}}\n]]\nThe Polish self-defence repelling the attack surprised the Bolsheviks. To better coordinate actions, the next day the Bolsheviks created a unified command. A second attempt was planned to take the city by a strong attack on the centre and then encircling the wing. However, the command of the 5th Vilnius Regiment accused the leadership of incompetence in planning and directing the attack and refused to participate in the action. On January 5, the Bolshevik group concentrated in Naujoji Vilnia started attacking Vilnius. The Poles organized the defence as follows: the 1st, 2nd and 4th Battalions defended the city's southern part, including Užupis, while the 3rd Battalion and the Vilnius Lancers Regiment defended the approaches to Antakalnis. The 4th POW battalion focused on defending the Vilnius defence headquarters building in Užupis. The fighting began in the suburbs. The Bolsheviks occupied the Hill of the Three Crosses, from where they started artillery bombardment of the city, especially Užupis. Then the infantry attacked the center of Vilnius. After doing this the Soviets attacked the Gate of Dawn (Ostrabrama) capturing it successfully.\nThe Bolshevik advantage in this clash was very large. The Vilnius self-defence force received information from Warsaw that it would not be possible to provide it with help from regular units of the Polish Army. Therefore, civilian representatives of the City Council suggested to General Wejtka to stop the fighting. They were afraid of reprisals from the Bolsheviks if they were forced to take the city by storm. On January 5, at 7 P.M., the chief of staff, Capt. Zygmunt Klinger, decided to stop the fighting and leave Vilnius since there was no chance of staying in the city.\nThe Polish retreat from Vilnius\nThe evacuation of the combat units and services took place in great chaos because it had not been planned beforehand. There was no detailed plan for the withdrawal of the Vilnius crew, and the whole complicated operation had to be improvised. The order issued by the Chief of Staff, Captain Klingera, only stated that the place where the troops were to assemble was the castle at Biała Waka, about 8 km south-west of Vilnius. It was known that there were neither German nor Bolshevik troops there. The necessary number of transport vehicles was not available, so it was not possible to take all the food and weapons. Having received this order, General Wejtko and Captain Klinger set off by car in the direction of Landwarów, near the town of Waka Tyszkiewiczowska, about 6 km north-west of Biała Waka, where they encountered the German 101st Infantry Battalion and were interned. The Germans also controlled the railway station at Landwarów.\nIn this situation, individual commanders made their own decisions. Most of them, according to the orders they received, directed their units towards Biała Waka and nearby Khazbijevich and other backwaters. There the Rifle Regiment and the 1st Vilnius Uhlan Regiment were present until 7.00 a.m. on 6 January.\nOn the basis of the information received from the Germans and an analysis of the position of their own troops, General Wejtko and Captain Klinger came to the conclusion that an independent march to Podlasie was impossible. The units did not have the wagons left in Vilnius, there was no food and money, the soldiers did not have winter uniforms, the area of the eventual march, inhabited mainly by Byelorussians, was devastated by the war, making it impossible to resupply during the retreat. In this situation, through Captain Wenderlich of the 101st Battalion, negotiations began with several German commands (Ober-Ost in Kaunas, 10th army in Grodno and one of the Reserve Corps). They ended with the signing of an agreement that the German military authorities would provide rail transport from Landwarow to Lapy, including provisions for the duration of the transit. However, General Wejtko soldiers were to deposit their weapons (except white weapons) in one of the wagons and surrender their horses. Everything was to be returned to them in Lapy. On the basis of this agreement, Captain Klinger issued an order which read: \"During today's march to Waka (Count Tyszkiewicz's castle). From there we will march at 8.30 a.m. to Landwarow to the prepared train to Łapy. Provisions provided\". The troops largely obeyed the order; the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Rifle Regiment marched to Landwarow, where, after laying down their arms, they were loaded onto wagons and transported to Łapy. There, 154 officers and 1,035 non-commissioned officers and sergeants joined the Lithuanian-Belarusian Division that had been formed. Some Polish soldiers continued the fight while making the way through Paneriai, Rūdninkai, Eišiškės and .\nAftermath\nThe defense of Vilnius despite initial successes became a disaster for the outnumbered Polish self-defense. According to Leon Wasilewski Piłsudski broke into tears after hearing that Vilnius fell to the Bolsheviks. After the battle 500 men led by the Dąbrowski brothers decided on a cavalry march to Brest. The main goal of the march was to reach the Grodno self-defense commanded by Mikołaj Sulewski. During the campaign the Poles captured Różana and Prużany. For 5 Months the Dąbrowski brothers engaged in a guerilla war with the Bolsheviks, giving them high losses.\nReactions of the Belarusian government\nOn January 3, 1919, the Prime Minister of the BRL, Anton Luckievich, handed over a protest note to the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Leon Wasilewski. His government was dissatisfied with the fact that General Władysław Wejtko announced mobilization in Vilnius, which also included Belarusians living there. In this way, he intended to make it clear that he treated the Vilnius region as part of the BRL and did not agree to any other country taking action there. According to historian Dorota Michaluk, this type of protest in the situation of the ongoing siege of Vilnius by the Bolsheviks could have been treated very unfavourably by a significant part of its inhabitants, because it could easily be misinterpreted as an expression of pro-Bolshevik sympathies or a call to abandon the defence.\nHistorical dispute\nThe fighting between Polish and Bolshevik forces, which began on January 4, 1919, was the first fight in which units formally part of the Polish Army and the Red Army fought against each other.  For this reason, some historians, including Waldemar Rezmer, accept this date as the beginning of the Polish-Bolshevik war. However, the Polish self-defence formations in Vilnius were improvised and irregular units, operating without specific orders from Supreme Command of the Polish Army. For this reason, most historians do not treat the above-mentioned fights as the beginning of a regular Polish-Bolshevik war, although they admit that it was an announcement of it in the near future.\nSee also\n* Żeligowski's Mutiny\n* Vilna offensive\n* Battle of Bereza Kartuska\n* Nieśwież uprising\nNotes\nSources\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nLithuanian-language sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPolish-language sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
