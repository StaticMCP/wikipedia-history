Ninkō's reign spanned the years from 1817 until his death in 1846, and saw further deterioration of the power of the ruling . Disasters, which included famine, combined with corruption and increasing Western interference, helped to erode public trust in the  government. Emperor Ninkō revived certain court rituals and practices upon the wishes of his father. However, it is unknown what role, if any, the Emperor had in the turmoil which occurred during his reign.\nHis family included fifteen children from various concubines, but only three of them lived to adulthood. His fourth son, Imperial Prince Osahito, became Emperor Kōmei upon Ninkō's death in 1846. While political power at the time still resided with the , the beginnings of the  (end of military government) were at hand.\nEvents of Ninkō's life\nEarly life\nBefore Ninkō's ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (imina) was . He was born on 16 March 1800 and was the fourth son of Emperor Kōkaku. He was the only child of sixteen others to survive into adulthood. Ayahito was named as crown prince in 1809, having been adopted by his father's chief wife , also known as . His birth mother was one of his father's concubines named .\nReign\nPrince Ayahito was enthroned as Emperor on 31 October 1817, after his father retired from the throne. Following his father the Retired Emperor's wishes, he attempted to revive certain court rituals and practices. These included, among other things, restoring the title tennō, which identified the Emperor. Among Ninkō's innovations was the establishment of the Gakushūsho (the predecessor of the Gakushūin) for the Court Nobility just outside the Imperial Palace. One major event during his reign was the Tenpō famine which lasted from 1833 to 1837. The famine was most severe in northern Honshū and was caused by flooding and cold weather.\nNinkō's reign also saw some deterioration of the Shōgun's power. Damage from the Tenpō famine and other concurring natural disasters shook the faith of the people in the ruling Shōgun. In 1837, Ōshio Heihachirō led a revolt in Osaka against corrupt officials who refused to help feed the impoverished residents of the city. That same year also had an incident take place where an American merchant vessel was driven away by coastal artillery. While order was eventually restored, long term resentment resonated with the commoners against the ruling government. It is unclear though what role, if any, the Emperor played during this period of unrest.\nEmperor Ninkō died on 21 February 1846 and was enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, , which is at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined in Tsuki no wa no misasagi, at Sennyū-ji are this Emperor's immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi, Go-Momozono and Kōkaku. The shrine complex also encompasses the misasagi of Ninkō's immediate successor – Kōmei. Empress Dowager Yoshikō is also entombed at this Imperial mausoleum complex.\nEras and Kugyō\nThe years of Ninkō's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō. While  is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.\nThe following eras occurred during Ninkō's reign:\n* Bunka (1804–1818)\n* Bunsei (1818–1830)\n* Tenpō (1830–1844)\n* Kōka (1844–1848)\nDuring Ninkō's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:\n* Kampaku, Ichijō Tadayoshi, 1814–1823\n* Kampaku, Takatsukasa Masamichi, 1823–1856\n* Sadaijin\n* Udaijin\n* Naidaijin\n* Dainagon\nGenealogy\nEmperor Ninkō's family included 7 sons and 8 daughters from various concubines, but only the future Emperor Komei (Komei-tennō), Princess Sumiko (Sumiko-naishinnō) and Princess Chikako (Chikako-naishinnō) survived beyond childhood.\nSpouse\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Position||Name || Birth || Death || Father || Issue\n|-\n| Kōgō ||later || 1798 || 1823 || Takatsukasa Masahiro || First Son: Imperial Prince Yasuhito (b. 1820)First daughter: Princess Jihishin’in (b. 1823)\n|-\n| Nyōgo ||later || 1811 || 1847 || Takatsukasa Masahiro || Fourth Daughter: Princess Maninshu’in (b. 1829)\n|}\nConcubines\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name || Birth || Death || Father || Issue\n|-\n| later || 1803 || 1856 || Ogimachi Sanemitsu || Second Son: Prince Yo (b. 1825)Fourth Son: Imperial Prince Osahito (later Emperor Komei) (b. 1831)Sixth Son: Imperial Prince Katsura-no-Miya Misahito (b. 1833)Seventh Daughter: Princess Kyo (b. 1837)\n|-\n|  || 1806 || 1861 || Kanroji Kuninaga || Second Daughter: Princess Nori (b. 1823)Third Daughter: Imperial Princess Katsura-no-Miya Sumiko (b. 1829)Third Son: San-no-miya (b. 1830)Fifth Daughter: Princess So (b. 1832)Sixth Daughter: Princess Tsune (b. 1836)\n|-\n| later || 1826 || 1865 || Hashimoto Sanehisa || Seventh Prince: Prince Tane (b. 1844)\nEighth Daughter: Imperial Princess Kazu-no-miya Chikako (b. 1846)\n|-\n|  || 1795 || 1875 || Nakayama Naruchika || align=\"center\"| None\n|-\n|  || 1809 || 1875 || Imaki Sadanori || Fifth son: Prince Jōjakkō-in (b. 1832)\n|}\nIssue\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Status || Name ||  Birth || Death || Mother || Marriage || Issue\n|-\n| 01 First Son ||  || 1820 || 1821 || Takatsukasa Tsunako ||  ||\n|-\n| 01 First Daughter || (Stillbirth)|| 1823 || 1823 || Takatsukasa Tsunako ||  ||\n|-\n| 02 Second Son ||  || 1825 || 1826 || Ogimachi Naoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 02 Second Daughter ||  || 1825 || 1826 || Kanroji Kiyoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 03 Third Daughter ||  || 1829 || 1881 || Kanroji Kiyoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 04 Fourth Daughter ||  || 1829 || 1831 || Takatsukasa Yasuko ||  ||\n|-\n| 03 Third Son ||  || 1830 || 1831 || Kanroji Kiyoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 04 Fourth Son || (Emperor Komei) || 1831 || 1867 || Ogimachi Naoko || align=\"center\"| Asako Kujō || align=\"center\"| Mutsuhito\n|-\n| 05 Fifth son || (Stillbirth) || 1832 || 1832 || Imaki Haruko ||  ||\n|-\n| 05 Fifth Daughter ||  || 1832 || 1833 || Kanroji Kiyoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 06 Sixth Son ||  || 1833 || 1836 || Ogimachi Naoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 06 Sixth Daughter || (Stillbirth) || 1836 || 1836 || Kanroji Kiyoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 07 Seventh Daughter ||  || 1837 || 1838 || Ogimachi Naoko ||  ||\n|-\n| 07 Seventh Son ||  || 1844 || 1845 || Hashimoto Tsuneko ||  ||\n|-\n| 08 Eighth Daughter ||  || 1846 || 1877 || Hashimoto Tsuneko || Tokugawa Iemochi || Tokugawa Iesato\n|}\nAncestry\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\n* Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines\nNotes\nReferences\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nBibliography\n* Meyer, Eva-Maria.
