She has received various accolades, including a Grammy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and two NAACP Image Awards, in addition to a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2006, she became the first hip hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nAt age 19, Latifah released her debut album All Hail the Queen (1989), featuring the hit single \"Ladies First\". Her second album Nature of a Sista' (1991), was produced by Tommy Boy Records. Her third album, Black Reign (1993), became the first album by a solo female rapper to receive a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and spawned the single \"U.N.I.T.Y.\", which was influential in raising awareness of violence against women and the objectification of Black female sexuality. The track reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, and won a Grammy Award. Her fourth album Order in the Court (1998), was released with Motown Records. She has since released the albums The Dana Owens Album (2004), ''Trav'lin' Light (2007), and Persona (2009).\nLatifah starred as Khadijah James on the Fox sitcom Living Single from 1993 to 1998 and landed a leading role in the action film Set It Off (1996).

She is the daughter of Rita Lamae (née Bray; d. 2018), a teacher at Irvington High School (Dana's alma mater), and Lancelot Amos Owens, a police officer.  Her parents divorced when she was ten.\nShe was raised in the Baptist faith. She attended Catholic school in Newark, New Jersey and Essex Catholic Girls' High School in Irvington but graduated from Irvington High School.  After high school, she attended classes at Borough of Manhattan Community College.\nShe found her stage name, Latifah ( laṭīfa), meaning \"delicate\" and \"very kind\" in Arabic, in a book of Arabic names when she was eight. Always tall, the  Dana was a power forward on her high school basketball team. She performed the number \"Home\" from the musical The Wiz in a grammar school play.\nMusic career\n1988–1989: Career beginnings\nShe began beat boxing for the hip-hop group Ladies Fresh and was an original member of the Flavor Unit, which, at that time, was a crew of MCs grouped around producer DJ King Gemini. DJ King Gemini made a demo recording of Queen Latifah's rap song Princess of the Posse, which he gave to Fab 5 Freddy, the host of Yo! MTV Raps. The song got the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, who signed Latifah and in 1989 released her first single, \"Wrath of My Madness\". More recent artists, like Ice Cube and Lil' Kim, would go on to sample Latifah's track in their songs \"You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo\" and \"Wrath of Kim's Madness\" respectively in later years. Latifah has a two-octave vocal range. She is considered a contralto, with the ability to both rap and sing.\n1989–2002: Rap and hip-hop\nLatifah made her mark in hip-hop by rapping about issues black women face. She wrote songs about topics including domestic violence, street harassment, and troubled relationships.\nFreddy helped Latifah sign with Tommy Boy Records, which released Latifah's first album All Hail the Queen in 1989, when she was nineteen. That year, she appeared as Referee on the UK label Music of Life album 1989The Hustlers Convention (live). She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1992. The single \"Ladies First\" featuring Monie Love became the first collaborative track by two female rappers not in a group. In 1993, she released the album Black Reign, which was certified Gold in the United States and produced the Grammy Award-winning song \"U.N.I.T.Y.\" In 1998, co-produced by Ro Smith, now CEO of Def Ro Inc., she released her fourth hip-hop album Order in the Court, which was released by Motown Records. Latifah was also a member of the hip-hop collective Native Tongues.\nLatifah performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show, making her the first rapper to do so.\n2003–2009: Change to traditional singing\nAfter Order in the Court, Latifah shifted primarily to singing soul music and jazz standards, which she had used sparingly in her previous hip-hop-oriented records. In 2004, she released the soul/jazz standards The Dana Owens Album. On July 11, 2007, Latifah sang at the famed Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles as the headlining act in a live jazz concert. In front of a crowd of more than 12,400, she was backed by a 10-piece live orchestra and three backup vocalists, which was billed as the Queen Latifah Orchestra. Latifah performed new arrangements of standards including \"California Dreaming\", first made popular by 1960s icons the Mamas & the Papas. Later in 2007, Latifah released an album titled ''Trav'lin' Light. Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Joe Sample, George Duke, Christian McBride, and Stevie Wonder made guest appearances. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the \"Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album\" category.\nIn 2009, Latifah, along with the NJPAC Jubilation Choir, recorded the title track on the album Oh, Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration, covering the song that the Edwin Hawkins Singers made popular in 1969.\n2008–present: Return to hip-hop\nIn 2008, Latifah was asked if she would make another hip-hop album. She was quoted stating that the album was done already and it would be called All Hail the Queen II. The following year, in 2009, she released her album Persona''. The song \"Cue the Rain\" was released as the album's lead single. 2011 saw Queen Latifah sing \"Who Can I Turn To\" in a duet with Tony Bennett for his album Duets II. In January 2012, while appearing on 106 & Park with Dolly Parton, to promote Joyful Noise, Latifah stated that she had been working on a new album.\nFilm and television\n1991–2001: Early career\nShe began her film career by having supporting roles in the 1991 and 1992 films House Party 2, Juice and Jungle Fever. Moreover, she has guest starred in two episodes during the second season (1991–1992) of the NBC hit The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and had a guest role as herself on the ABC sitcom ''Hangin' with Mr. Cooper in 1993.

However, on November 21, 2014, Sony Pictures Television canceled Latifah's show due to declining ratings. Production of the series closed down, taking effect on December 18, 2014, leaving new episodes that were broadcast until March 6, 2015.\n2002–present: Mainstream success\nAlthough Latifah had previously received some critical acclaim, she gained mainstream success after being cast as Matron \"Mama\" Morton in Chicago, a musical film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Latifah herself received the nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role, but lost to co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones. Latifah is one of five hip-hop/R&B artists to receive an Academy Award nomination in an acting category. The others are Will Smith (Best Actor, Ali, 2001, and The Pursuit of Happyness, 2006), Jennifer Hudson (Best Supporting Actress, Dreamgirls, 2007), Jamie Foxx, (Best Actor, Ray, and Best Supporting Actor Collateral, both in 2004, also winning the first) and Mary J.

In 2008, Latifah appeared in the crime comedy Mad Money opposite Academy Award–winner Diane Keaton as well as Katie Holmes and Ted Danson. She appeared on Saturday Night Live on October 4, 2008, as moderator Gwen Ifill in a comedic sketch depicting the vice-presidential debate between then-Senator Joe Biden and then-Governor Sarah Palin and played in The Secret Life of Bees. In 2009, Latifah was a presenter at the 81st Academy Awards, presenting the segment honoring film professionals who had died during 2008 and singing \"I'll Be Seeing You\" during the montage. Latifah spoke at Michael Jackson's memorial service in Los Angeles. She also hosted the 2010 People's Choice Awards. Latifah sang \"America the Beautiful\" at Super Bowl XLIV hosted in Miami, Florida, on February 7, 2010, with Carrie Underwood. Latifah hosted the 2010 BET Awards on June 27, 2010. She starred with Dolly Parton in Joyful Noise (2012). In June 2011, Latifah received an honorary doctorate degree in Humane Letters from Delaware State University in Dover, Delaware. On September 16, 2013, Latifah premiered her own syndicated daytime television show titled The Queen Latifah Show.

In 2015, Latifah received a Best Actress Emmy nomination for her lead role as Bessie Smith in Bessie, an HBO film which received a total of 12 Emmy nominations.\nIn 2017, Latifah starred in the hit comedy film Girls Trip. On April 26, 2017, MTV announced that Latifah would be an executive producer for the third season of the slasher television series Scream. The show would undergo a reboot with a new cast and Brett Matthews serving as show runner. In addition, Matthews, Shakim Compere and Yaneley Arty would also be credited as executive producers for the series under Flavor Unit Entertainment. The third season titled Scream: Resurrection premiered on VH1 on July 8, 2019.\nIn 2019, Latifah played the sea witch Ursula in The Little Mermaid Live!. Although the production itself was not well received, critics widely praised Latifah's performance, with The Hollywood Reporter calling her performance \"the best moment of the evening\".\nIn 2021, CBS premiered the new active TV series, The Equalizer, a reboot of the 1980s detective series of the same name, starring Latifah in the lead role (renamed as Robyn for her version). More recently, she signed a deal with Audible.\nArtistry\nLatifah's music usually contains hip-hop, jazz and gospel and has the elements of R&B, soul, and dance. She possesses a two-octave vocal range. Queen Latifah is a contralto, and she has the ability to rap and sing. Her biggest musical influences are EPMD, KRS-One, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and Run–D.M.C. She also cites Bessie Smith as one of her influences.\nAl Hail the Queen features hip-hop, reggae, soulful back-up vocals, boppish scatting, snappy horn back-ups, and house music. She described the work as \"a creative outlet... and sometimes it can become like a newspaper that people read with their ears.\"\nEarly in her career, Queen Latifah's lyrics were described as woman-centered and Afrocentric. The rapper often used Afrocentric attires during public appearances and music videos, looks that became her trademark. In 1990, The New York Times Michelle Wallace described her art as \"politically sophisticated\", which \"seems worlds apart from the adolescent, buffoonish sex orientation of most rap.\" For AllMusic, her \"strong, intelligent, no-nonsense\" persona made her \"arguably the first MC who could properly be described as feminist\". Queen Latifah did not identify as a feminist at the time, and expressed that her music was not exclusive for the female audience. On the topic, author Tricia Rose wrote that Black female rappers likely did not identify with feminism during that time because it was perceived as a movement that focused primarily on white women's issues.\nProducts and endorsements\nLatifah is a celebrity spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics, Curvation women's underwear, Pizza Hut, and Jenny Craig. She represents her own line of cosmetics for women of color called the CoverGirl Queen Collection. Latifah has also launched a perfume line called \"Queen\" and \"Queen of Hearts\". On May 23, 2018, Latifah was named the godmother of Carnival Cruise Lines' vessel Carnival Horizon. Apart from singing, Queen Latifah has written a book on confidence and self-respect called Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman.\nPersonal life\nRaised in East Orange, New Jersey, Latifah has been a resident of Colts Neck, New Jersey; Rumson, New Jersey; and Beverly Hills, California.\nLatifah's older brother, Lancelot Jr., was killed in 1992 in an accident involving a motorcycle that Latifah had purchased for him. A 2006 interview revealed that Latifah still wore the key to the motorcycle around her neck, visible throughout her performance in her sitcom Living Single. In 1995, Latifah was the victim of a carjacking, which also resulted in the non-fatal shooting of her bodyguard, Sean Moon.\nIn 1996, she was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of a loaded handgun. In 2002, she was arrested for driving under the influence in Los Angeles County. She was placed on three years' probation after being convicted.\nOn March 21, 2018, her mother, actress Rita Owens, died due to heart failure, an issue she had been battling since 2004.\nLatifah long refused to address speculation around her sexuality and personal life, telling The New York Times in 2008 that \"I don't feel like I need to share my personal life, and I don't care if people think I'm gay or not\". At the BET Awards 2021, during her acceptance speech for the Lifetime Achievement Award, she publicly acknowledged her female partner Eboni Nichols and son Rebel for the first time, ending the speech with \"Happy Pride!\"\nIn the January 2020 season 6, episode 4 of Finding Your Roots titled \"This Land Is My Land\", Latifah learned that her family were descended from a line of freed Negroes, since her ancestors were listed by name in the U.S. pre–Civil War census of 1860 in Virginia. Slaves were almost never listed by name in pre–U.S. Civil War censuses. Latifah also learned the exact date her ancestors became free which was October 1, 1792, the date her second earliest known ancestor, a woman named \"Jug\" or Juggy Owens, was emancipated from slavery.\nShe supported the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign and spoke at a campaign rally in October 2024.\nFeud with Foxy Brown\nDisagreements between Foxy Brown and Queen Latifah began in mid-1996, where media reports indicated that Brown was a prime target of Latifah's diss record \"Name Callin, which was featured on the Set It Off soundtrack. In response, Brown made allegations of Latifah \"checking her out\" at musical events and further questioned Latifah's sexuality in various public radio interviews. In 1998, Brown released a diss record titled \"10% Dis\", where she continually questioned Latifah's sexuality and accused her of being jealous.\nBy late spring of 1998, Latifah responded to Brown through another diss record titled \"Name Callin' Part II\". On the record, Latifah disses Brown about her heavy reliance on sex appeal, in which she implies that Brown has to rely on skimpy outfits to hide her \"half-assed flow\". Foxy Brown retaliated via a response-diss record titled \"Talk to Me\", in which Brown made fun of the ratings of Latifah's television talk show and went on to make various homophobic remarks to both Latifah and then-newcomer Queen Pen.\nA significant part of media dubbed Latifah \"the winner\" of the feud. Hip-hop magazine Ego Trip stated that Latifah won the feud with her diss record \"Name Callin' Part II\" and added that she showed that \"the lady's still first\", in reference to Latifah's 1990 single, \"Ladies First\". In 2000, Brown and Latifah reconciled; to prove that the truce was real, Brown performed her song \"Na Na Be Like\" on The Queen Latifah Show.\nLegacy\nMusic\nOften cited as one of the best female rappers, Queen Latifah achieved groundbreaking success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and became what Pitchfork considered as the \"most recognizable female rapper\" of the golden era of hip hop. AllMusic writer Steve Huey stated that Latifah was \"certainly not the first female rapper, but she was the first one to become a bona fide star.\" In the book Notable Black American Women, Jessie Carney Smith hailed her as \"rap's first feminist\" and \"one of the few women to make a mark in the male-dominated field of rap music\". Variety called her \"one of the major forerunners for women in modern hip-hop,\" and The Guardian referred to her as a \"pioneer of female rap\".\nThroughout her career, several media publications have referred to her as the \"Queen of Rap\" including New York magazine (1990) via editor Dinitia Smith, as well as \"Queen of Hip Hop\". Latifah became the first solo female rapper to receive a RIAA certification for an album (Black Reign), a commercial breakthrough that the AllMusic editor considered as creating a path for \"a talented crew of women rappers to make their own way onto the charts as the 90s progressed\". Her breakthrough also helped place New Jersey on the hip hop map. In 1998, she performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show, making her the first rapper to do so.\nAccording to an African American Review journal, her afrocentric feminist music video for \"Ladies First\" presented a \"televisual moment\" and disrupted the continuity of sexism and racism that dominated the music videos at the time. The song was listed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll, and was one of the firsts texts to address the declining standards of male-female relationships in community life. Author Tricia Rose expressed that it \"offered hip-hop for the development of pro-female pro-black diasporas political consciousness.\" In Consequence, Okla Jones noted that the song \"U.N.I.T.Y.\"—which lyrics confront slurs against women in hip-hop culture and address other types of disrespect—created a path for future female rappers to be \"their authentic selves\".\nActing\nVibe magazine has noted her as the first female rapper to cross over into TV & film, as an artist that \"broke barriers and set standards\" for Black women in music to follow, and cited her as the \"First Lady of Hip-Hop\". For her performance as Matron \"Mama\" Morton in Chicago, Latifah earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first woman in hip hop to earn an Oscar nomination.\nCultural impact\nQueen Latifah has been cited as an influence on R&B, soul, and hip-hop artists, such as Eve, Da Brat, Lil' Kim, Fugees, Jill Scott, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Remy Ma, Ivy Queen, Foxy Brown, Ms. Dynamite, Naughty by Nature, Rapsody, Megan Thee Stallion, as well as actors Michael K. Williams, Keke Palmer, Vin Diesel, and author Jason Reynolds.\nPlaywright Lin-Manuel Miranda has stated that Latifah inspired the portrayal of Angelica Schuyler in the musical Hamilton. In 2020, Vogue editor Janelle Okwodu considered her a fashion icon that \"helped to start a conversation about body image that continues to this day\", crediting her among the first artists that pioneered the \"climate of size inclusivity and muses of all shapes\".\nInfluence on the entertainment industry\nChallenging Eurocentric standards\nQueen Latifah has demonstrated several forms of activism over her lifetime, challenging Eurocentric ideals and representing the black, female body. An initial sign of the beginning of her resistance to these Eurocentric standards started with her name. Her entire name was self-chosen, and while 'Latifah' came from an Arabic book, 'Queen' originated from her desire to create a strong, black identity, which was fueled by her mother, Rita Owens, who gave her the foundation to develop into a self-proclaimed Queen.\nAfrocentric Queendom is a concept that Queen Latifah uses to demonstrate her resistance to Eurocentric standards. This term, Afrocentric Queendom, refers to African centered customs that also incorporate female empowerment. Eurocentric constructions are challenged by this concept because Afrocentrism deconstructs oppressive environments, essentially disrupting centralized European spaces. The notion of the term Queen was intentionally crafted by Latifah, redefining what plus size, black women were in society. Over the twentieth century, the term 'mammy' coincided with black women because many were left to take care of white children. This term stripped many black women around this time of their name, forcing them to adopt the new identity of 'mammy'. Following the emergence of this term, African American women have been stereotyped as mothering figures, while also signaling a loss of identity. This is what Queen Latifah aimed to avoid when creating her stage name, with the intention of opposing the Eurocentric construction of the term mammy. The sole idea of her choosing her name imitates power and promotes strength within herself.\nLatifah also rejects Eurocentric standards by embracing Afrocentric ideals and incorporating this concept within her work. She claims that Afrocentricity is a great way of living, creating a sense of pride around her heritage. Within her music, Latifah incorporates Afrobeats and language while also centering black women within her lyrics and visuals. This can be clearly identified in her 1989 'Ladies First' music video, to where South African culture is present in her work, which included Afrocentric visuals and clothes that align culturally with South Africa.\nThe idea of the black, female body has been criticized and mocked, as well as being imitated over the past couple of decades by celebrities. Latifah, a plus sized, black woman, has continued to challenge Eurocentric standards by advocating for body positivity and incorporating her size as a part of her music identity within her early Hip Hop career. Her goal was to politicize and posterize her body to influence young, black girls that all bodies should be accepted, especially in her male dominated field at the time. Throughout her early career, Latifah challenged the Eurocentric mythology of the inferiority of black, female bodies, by creating a marketable figure that was respectable within the Hip Hop industry in the mid-1990s.\nQueen Latifah did not always center Africanness around her career, eventually embracing more Black American customs, while not completely abandoning African ideals. This was present through her physical appearance and her music. In her 1993 rap song, U.N.I.T.Y. she incorporates more jazz and soul sounds into her music, as well as empowering lyrics. Her lyrics address concerns regarding harassment and domestic violence within the black community, as well as lyrics to uplift black women, and lyrics that address misogyny within the hip hop community.\nEarly influence of feminism\nWhile Afrocentric influence and pro-black productions were what Queen Latifah focused on, she also incorporated feminism throughout her work. Latifah's demonstration of Afrocentricity co-existed with how she also demonstrated her feminism. The message of hip hop and rap began to change around the mid-nineties, with rappers like Queen Latifah, as well as Monie Love and Lil' Kim, changing the narrative. The lyrics of the songs produced by several of these women related to sexual liberation, female autonomy, and sexual domination. Language in hip hop was changed through female artists, reclaiming derogatory words that are used against women and incorporating them within their music.\nQueen Latifah's name, while self-empowering and challenging Eurocentric ideals, also demonstrates feminist action. The term \"queen\" refers to a female ruler who is in a higher position than those around her. By placing \"Queen\" in her stage name, Latifah set herself in a position to counter sexist ideals in the hip-hop and rap music industry, which was primarily dominated by men during this time.\nWhile there were several women, like Latifah, who associated with feminism, there were several women who rejected the idea of incorporating this into their artistry due to negative connotations of this movement. Involvement with feminism could adversely affect their career, especially if the idea of feminism is rejected by people who dominate the music industry. Queen Latifah was not a follower in this situation, subtly incorporating third-wave feminism within her lyrics, which specifically addressed the inclusion of women of color in feminism and the elimination of homophobia.\nFlavor Unit Records\nLatifah also founded a production company, which was referred to as Flavor Unit Records, eventually Flavor Unit Entertainment, co-launching it in 1995 with her business partner Shakim Compere. Near the creation of this label, she helped several artists create their music, such as Daddy D. Daddy D was Latifah's first artist to create a single with. Her purpose was to create a multimedia company that operates at full service. Several music artists at the time wanted to join Queen Latifah's label because they easily identified her success, from an artist herself, to a self made label chief. The label remained quite small in the nineties, but eventually gained traction as Queen Latifah gained more attention. While her record label helped several artists start up their career, she remained at Motown Records for her own benefit.\nPortrayal of characters\nQueen Latifah expanded her career from music, branching out to acting, as well as producing. Her first role that she took on was in the movie Jungle Fever, which was released in 1991, where she performed among several significant black actors, such as Samuel L. Jackson and Halle Berry. Her role in this movie was not major, but displayed her overall talent enough in the film. She later moved to entertainment television, starring and co-producing certain episodes of the show Living Single.\nLiving Single\nQueen Latifah was the star of the sitcom Living Single, which followed her character, Khadijah James, and three of her black, female friends. This sitcom that aired for three years aimed to highlight the Black American experience by demonstrating Black excellence. Latifah's character is described to embody what black womanhood was in the early nineties. Her character was well rounded and represented the idea of what a 'girl boss' was. With this all black cast, the possibilities for characters to be presented in a variety of ways were endless. Some characters, such as Maxine Shaw, played by Erika Alexander, were depicted as lawyers, while others were depicted as wealthy, such as Regine Hunter, played by Kim Fields. Khadijah was everything from a business owner, to a songwriter, to a friend, all while maintaining the lead role in the show. Depth and duality behind black characters on sitcoms within the nineties was not very common outside of Black Entertainment Television (BET), so it was quite significant to television when Latifiah took on such an important role. With the help of Latifah, Yvette Lee Bowser, the executive producer and creator, actively changed the perception of Black Americans, painting a new light on the Black experience.\nThrough her performance through the show, Latifah showed the complexity of Black womanhood successfully. There were several parallels that were identified between Living Single and Queen Latifah's life, such as how both she and her character had to navigate a male-dominated industry while trying to be successful. Their personalities also align, both being outspoken, confident, and driven. Latifah realistically depicted a black woman on television by simply acting as herself on Living Single.\nEarly influence of sexuality in entertainment (before the 2000s)\nQueen Latifah's sexuality has always come into question through her on-screen performances. In one of her films, 1996's Set It Off, she takes on a more masculine role. Cleopatra Sims (Cleo), Latifah's character, can be described as a butch, lesbian bank robber, which highlighted her sexuality. She was so successful while playing this masculine role, that rumors about her sexuality started spreading. In the early stages of her career, Latifah chose not to address the rumors regarding her sexuality, letting the public categorize her in their own way. Queen Latifah's ambiguity played to her strengths when acting, allowing her to have versatile roles and not become constrained to certain acting roles because of her off screen sexuality. This can be identified in many of her later films in her career, playing a range of either oversexualized characters or sexually muted characters. The distance Queen Latifah created from assumptions about her sexuality in her early career excluded her from any queer discourse throughout the 1990s. Her involvement in offhanded politics and pro-black work productions helped define her work, while her sexuality did not affect her work, early on.\nAccolades\n]]\nQueen Latifah became the first female hip-hop recording artist to get nominated for an Oscar.
