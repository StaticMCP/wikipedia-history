Governor Patrick said that the park will be a \"beautiful addition to the Greenway as well as a testament to the heritage of Armenian-Americans and Massachusetts' larger immigrant history\". Mayor Menino also noted that the park \"celebrates the distinctive history of the City of Boston and the generations of immigrants who have made Boston the wonderfully diverse community it is today\".\nConstruction of the park was expected to be completed within 12 months, but actually lasted over a year and the park was opened on May 22, 2012. Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Nalbandyan and Governor Deval Patrick joined hundreds of attendees from the Armenian community at the dedication of the park.\nJoanna Weiss, columnist for The Boston Globe, wrote in a 2015 opinion piece that the sculpture \"might well be the gem of the Greenway: an example of public art that is both permanent and alive.\"\nOn July 31, 2022, Armenian singer-songwriter Maléna, winner of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2021, performed her winning track \"Qami Qami\" at the park.\nGallery\nFile:Armenian Heritage Park inscription.JPG|The inscription.\nFile:Boston Custom House Tower View to the North.jpg|View from the Boston Custom House Tower.\nFile:Boston_Armenian_Heritage_Park_panorama_view_2015.jpg|Panorama view, 2015\nFile:Armenian Heritage Park - Boston, Mass.JPG|Armenian Heritage Park with North Market in background.\nSee also\n*List of Armenian genocide memorials\n*Armenian American\n*List of places named after Armenia\nReferences"
