Incumbent president Georgi Parvanov was not eligible for re-election; the Constitution of Bulgaria limits a president to two terms. No candidate won outright in the first round, resulting in a runoff between the eventual winner, Rosen Plevneliev of GERB, and Ivaylo Kalfin of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.\nBackground\nThe presidential elections were held in conjunction with local elections, saving the country BGN 8 million according to the finance minister Simeon Djankov. However, the move drew criticism from the US Ambassador in Sofia, James Warlick, who said that the move led to poor administration during the elections.\nCandidates\nThere were 18 registered candidates. Rosen Plevneliev, Ivaylo Kalfin, and Meglena Kuneva were expected to have the best chance of reaching the second round.

These two MPs were not authorized to be present at the electoral commission at that time: an offence under Bulgarian law. One of the GERB MPs, Stanislav Ivanov, was photographed carrying a large bag around the Sofia Electoral Commission building. This bag was presumably full of ballots. The Central Electoral Commission held a meeting on the case but failed to reach a decision, because voting could not reach the required 2/3 majority.\nUniversiada Hall crisis\nMembers of electoral committees were held without rest or sleep for 30 to 34 hours. Universiada Hall was not aired, was stunningly cold and members of committees were not given food and water, and not allowed to go outside the Hall to buy such. Journalists and observers were not allowed in Universiada Hall and a large region around it was slipped off with police until the next day late afternoon and early evening.\nIn the day of the elections and day after one member of Municipal Committee in Varna died, six ambulances arrived at Universiada Hall to assist fainted committee members, while the number of fainted man and women, and those suffering health problems during and after elections is not known, according to witnesses people were fainting in the Hall and at the queues for delivering elections protocols, and in the first lines at the committee members meeting in Universiada people were in constant fainted and wakening cycles condition because of lack of air, cold, malnutrition and exhausture.\nPeople slept on floor, on bags with bulletins and even some left Universiada Hall unlawfully with taking the bulletins with themselves at home because of the poor conditions.\nIn the first announcement of the situation no politician or Central Committee member expressed any sorry or apology for it and party GERB said that the reason of this was the one-hour delay of the starting of the electoral day but in fact the starting of the electoral day was marked by no voters in the first two hours, while people was arriving at sections to vote around 8 am.\nAfter the scandal of the situation of people still at Universiada Hall sparked in media, it was announced that committee members held there will receive 60 lv or 30 Euro more as a compensation for the long hours stay.\nInternational statements\nThe PACE delegation noted that whilst the election was conducted in a generally orderly and peaceful way, there remained concerns about a lack of an equal access to the media, blurred distinctions between newspaper editorials and political advertisements, the lack of a dedicated voter roll and the candidate registration system which particularly affected independent candidates. PACE also recommended that voting for expatriate Bulgarians should be improved. The OCSE delegation also noted concerns about the blurred lines in media coverage, as well as vote-buying allegations, restrictions on using minority languages in campaigns, and inflammatory statements by some candidates.\nResults\n|vp5=Galina Vasileva|party5=National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria|votes5=84205\n|cand6=Rumen Hristov|vp6=Emmanuel Yordanov|party6=Union of Democratic Forces|votes6=65761\n|cand7=|vp7=Polya Stancheva|party7=Order, Law and Justice|votes7=61797\n|cand8=Svetoslav Vitkov|vp8=Ventsislav Mitsov|party8=Initiative committee|votes8=54125\n|cand9=Sali Ibrayim|vp9=Valentina Gotseva|party9=National Movement Unity|votes9=41837\n|cand10=Krasimir Karakachanov|vp10=Daniela Dimitrova|party10=IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|votes10=33236\n|cand11=Aleksey Petrov|vp11=Nikolai Georgiev|party11=Initiative committee|votes11=31613\n|cand12=|vp12=Nikolay Kisyov|party12=United People's Party|votes12=30665\n|cand13=Nikolay Nenchev|vp13=Zheko Ivanov|party13=Bulgarian Agrarian National Union|votes13=9827\n|cand14=Pavel Chernev|vp14=Anelia Dimitrova|party14=Party for the People of the Nation|votes14=8081\n|cand15=Ventsislav Yosifov|vp15=Vladimir Slavov|party15=Initiative committee|votes15=7021\n|cand16=|vp16=Kamelia Todorova|party16=Initiative committee|votes16=6989\n|cand17=Andrey Chorbanov|vp17=Angel Mirchev|party17=|votes17=6340\n|cand18=|vp18=Vladimir Savov|party18=Initiative committee|votes18=5633\n|invalid=229844\n|invalid2=104837\n|electorate=6873589\n|electorate2=6910491\n|source=[https://web.archive.org/web/20161127062332/http://results.cik.bg:80/tur1/prezidentski/index.html Electoral Commission of Bulgaria]\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nsd.uib.no/european_election_database/country/bulgaria/ NSD: European Election Database - Bulgaria]  publishes regional level election data; allows for comparisons of election results, 1990-2011"
