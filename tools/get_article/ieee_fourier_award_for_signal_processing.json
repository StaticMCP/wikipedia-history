This award is presented for contributions in the field of signal processing.\nThe award is named after Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician and physicist who is noted for the representation of periodic signals as linear superpositions of sine-wave basis functions known as the Fourier series, and applications of the Fourier Series to the analysis of vibration and heat transfer. The Fourier transform, which is widely used throughout electrical engineering and in particular signal processing, image processing, and communication theory, is also named in his honor.\nThe IEEE Fourier Award for Signal Processing may be presented to an individual or team of up to three people.\nRecipients of the IEEE Fourier Award for Signal Processing receive a bronze medal, certificate, and honorarium. The Fourier Award is presented annually at the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) in the Spring.\nRecipients\nSource:\n* 2015: Georgios B.
