Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the B9½ class, B representing they had two driving axles, and 9½ the cylinder diameter in inches. They operated on  Innisfail Tramway, all being withdrawn in the early 1960s. One has been preserved at the Australian Narrow Gauge Railway Museum Society, Woodford.\nReferences"
