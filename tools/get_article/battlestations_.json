Commander Piper is taking a vacation from Starfleet following the events of the novel Dreadnought!, in which she prevented a military coup from taking over the Federation. However she is swept up into intrigue when Captain Kirk is arrested for the theft of transwarp drive, a new technology which could radically shift the balance of power across the galaxy. Piper, Commander Spock, and Dr. McCoy attempt to solve the mystery as the major powers of the galaxy scramble for the new technology.\nReception\nMark Chappell of TV Zone described the novel as \"a cut above the standard fare of Titan's Star Trek novels\" though it was \"not as fresh as Dreadnought\".\nReferences\nExternal links"
