Its goal is to maintain the French identity through the promotion and protection of the arts (visual, plastic, theatrical, musical, dance, architectural, literary, televisual and cinematographic) on national soil and abroad. Its budget is mainly dedicated to the management of the  (six national sites and hundred decentralised storage facilities) and the regional  (culture centres).\nIts main office is in the  in the 1st arrondissement of Paris on the . It is headed by the Minister of Culture, a cabinet member. The current officeholder has been Rachida Dati since 11 January 2024.\nHistory\nDeriving from the Italian and Burgundian courts of the Renaissance, the notion that the state had a key role to play in the sponsoring of artistic production and that the arts were linked to national prestige was found in France from at least the 16th century on. During the pre-revolutionary period, these ideas are apparent in such things as the creation of the , the Académie de peinture et de sculpture and other state-sponsored institutions of artistic production, and through the cultural policies of Louis XIV's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert.\nThe modern post of Minister of Culture was created by Charles de Gaulle in 1959 and the first officeholder was the writer André Malraux. Malraux was responsible for realising the goals of the droit à la culture ('right to culture'), an idea which had been incorporated in the Constitution of France and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), by democratising access to culture, while also achieving the Gaullist aim of elevating the \"grandeur\" ('greatness') of post-war France. To this end, he created numerous regional cultural centres throughout France and actively sponsored the arts. Malraux's artistic tastes included the modern arts and the avant-garde, but on the whole he remained conservative.\n]]\nUnder President François Mitterrand the Minister of Culture was Jack Lang who showed himself to be far more open to popular cultural production, including jazz, rock and roll, rap music, graffiti, bande dessinées, fashion and food. His famous phrase \"économie et culture, même combat\" ('economy and culture: it's the same fight') is representative of his commitment to cultural democracy and to active national sponsorship and participation in cultural production. In addition to the creation of the Fête de la Musique and overseeing the French Revolution bicentennial (1989), he was in charge of the massive architectural program of the François Mitterrand years (the so-called Grands travaux; 'Great Works') that gave permission for the building of the Bibliothèque nationale, the new Louvre, the Arab World Institute, the Musée d'Orsay, the Opéra-Bastille, the \"Grande Arche\" of La Défense (the Parisian business quarter), the new seat of the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance, the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre, and the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie and Cité de la Musique, both in the Parc de la Villette.\nThe Ministry of Jacques Toubon was notable for a number of laws (the \"Toubon Laws\") enacted for the preservation of the French language, both in advertisements (all ads must include a French translation of foreign words) and on the radio (35% of songs on French radio stations must be in French), ostensibly in reaction to the presence of English.\nMinisters of Culture\nThe following people were appointed Minister of Culture of France:\n* February 1959: André Malraux\n* June 1969: Edmond Michelet\n* October 1970: André Bettencourt\n* January 1971: Jacques Duhamel\n* April 1973: Maurice Druon\n* March 1974: Alain Peyrefitte\n* June 1974:\n* August 1976: Françoise Giroud\n* March 1977: Michel d'Ornano\n* April 1978: Jean-Philippe Lecat\n* March 1981: Michel d'Ornano\n* May 1981: Jack Lang\n* March 1986: François Léotard\n* May 1988: Jack Lang\n* March 1993: Jacques Toubon\n* May 1995: Philippe Douste-Blazy\n* June 1997: Catherine Trautmann\n* March 2000: Catherine Tasca\n* May 2002: Jean-Jacques Aillagon\n* March 2004: Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres\n* May 2007: Christine Albanel\n* June 2009: Frédéric Mitterrand\n* May 2012: Aurélie Filippetti\n* August 2014: Fleur Pellerin\n* February 2016: Audrey Azoulay\n* May 2017: Françoise Nyssen\n* October 2018: Franck Riester\n* July 2020: Roselyne Bachelot\n* May 2022: Rima Abdul Malak\n* January 2024: Rachida Dati\nNames of the Ministry of Culture\nSince the French constitution does not identify specific ministers (merely speaking of \"the minister in charge of\" this or that), each government may label each ministry as they wish, or even have a broader ministry in charge of several governmental sectors.
