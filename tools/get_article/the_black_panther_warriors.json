One night, Cougar was hired by minister Chu (Melvin Wong) to steal a silver box to test the newly installed security system in the police headquarters. Panthers then assembles his team of acquaintances possessing special skills to assistant. They include dart-thrower Madam Rose (Carrie Ng), sharpshooter Mang-po Fai (Tony Leung), gambling expert and card thrower Black Jack Love (Simon Yam), computer genius Robert Parkinson (Dicky Cheung), and Cougar's junior fellow apprentice, Ching-ching (Brigitte Lin). During their operation, they realized that in order for them to activate the security system, they would need to obtain the weight of police officer Fat Wong (Sze Kai-keung) and the fingerprints of his partner Enna (Elsie Chan). When they finally obtain the fingerprints and weight of the two, Cougar proceeds to steal the silver box on his own. However, Cougar was ambushed and was abducted and trapped in a cell by his senior fellow apprentice Bloody Wolf (Yuen Wah). While Wolf was torturing Cougar, Cougar's assistant, Chan-chan (Jennifer Chan) comes to rescue him. Ching-ching also comes and fights Chan-chan, revealing the latter to be a traitor. Ching-ching tells Cougar that this was all a setup by Wolf, which originated ten years ago when Wolf killed their mentor and faked his own death in order to obtain the \"Cougar Head Blade\". Chan-chan also comes back to confess and apologize for her betrayal and reveals that the silver box contains a photographic paper, which turns out to be a photo showing Wolf killing his mentor. Cougar therefore decides to battle to the death with Wolf.\nCast\n*Alan Tang as Black Cougar\n*Brigitte Lin as Ching-ching\n*Simon Yam as Black Jack Love\n*Tony Leung Ka-fai as Mang-po Fai\n*Dicky Cheung as Robert Parkinson\n*Carrie Ng as Madam Rose\n*Jennifer Chan as Chan-chan\n*Elsie Chan as Enna\n*Yuen Wah as Bloody Wolf\n*Melvin Wong as Chu\n*Pau Fong as Mentor (cameo)\n*Sze Ka-keung as Fat Wong (cameo)\n*Lily Lee as Airplane wet nurse (cameo)\n*Kingdom Yuen (cameo)\n*Kwan Yung as Thug in final fight scene\n*Kong Miu-deng\nReception\nCritical\nAndrew Sarooch of [http://www.fareastfilms.com/ Far East Films] gave the film a score of 2 out of 5 stars and criticizes its tasteless comedy and strange characters, but complements it imaginative action sequences.\nBox office\nThe film grossed HK$7,257,468 at the Hong Kong box office during its theatrical run from  18 November to 1 December 1993.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=1306 The Black Panther Warriors]  at Hong Kong Cinemagic\n*"
