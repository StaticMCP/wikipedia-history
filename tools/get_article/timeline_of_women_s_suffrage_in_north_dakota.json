Women's suffrage in North Dakota began while it was still part of the Dakota Territory. In 1879, women in the territory gained the right to vote in school meetings. Later, this was more formalized in 1883, providing women separate ballots for school issues. After North Dakota was a state, suffragists continued to work for full suffrage. A referendum on equal suffrage took place in 1914, but failed. In 1917, women gained the right to vote in municipal and presidential elections. On December 1, 1919, North Dakota became the 20th state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment.\n19th century\n1860s\n]]\n1868\n* Enos Stutsman proposes a women's suffrage bill in the Dakota Territorial House.\n1870s\n1872\n* The Territorial Legislature nearly passes a full women's suffrage bill, losing by one vote.\n1879\n* The Dakota Territory gives women the right to vote in school meetings.\n1883\n* A change in the way people would vote on school issues disenfranchised many women voters in the territory.
