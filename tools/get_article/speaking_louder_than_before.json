It was released on November 24, 2008, and entered the Billboard 200 at No. 38.\nBackground\nIn May 2008, Camp went into the studio to begin recording the album. Speaking Louder Than Before was recorded over five days, with Camp spending 12 hours in the studio each day. He co-produced the album with Brown Bannister.\nCamp has said that Speaking Louder Than Before has a different theme to his previous releases and that he has \"a more clear-cut purpose and vision of what I'm meant to do ... I see the hurt, the lack of direction, in this new generation. I always had a passion for youth, but this album is really aimed at them.\" Referring to the album's title and theme, he said, \"I have walked through the valleys, the mountains, and plains. That's why I'm speaking up, that's why I'm speaking now and loud.\"\nPromotion and release\nThe first single \"There Will Be a Day\" was released around early September. It was the most-added song at R&R's AC and CHR charts, and it was also the highest-debuting track in its first week of entering the chart. The song was digitally released on September 23.\nThe album itself was subsequently released in the United States on November 24, 2008. It debuted at No. 38 on the Billboard 200, with 32,700 copies sold in the first week. Speaking Louder Than Before also reached number one at Billboard's Top Christian Albums, and in its first week became Camp's highest-charting album to date.  \"There Will Be a Day\" reached number one at Christian CHR radio on November 28, and stayed at the top of the chart for two weeks.\nA special edition of the album was released on December 5, which included a DVD with an hour of in-studio video footage, a booklet containing journal entries from Camp, a sticker, three art cards and a silicone bracelet.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Jeremy Camp – lead and backing vocals\n* Blair Masters – keyboards, acoustic piano, Hammond B3 organ\n* Tom Bukovac – guitars\n* Jerry McPherson – guitars\n* Scott Denté – acoustic guitar (12)\n* Matt Pierson – bass\n* Dan Needham – drums (1-4, 6-9, 12)\n* Chris McHugh – drums (5, 10, 11)\n* Eric Darken – percussion\n* Richie Peña – loops (8)\n* Matt Balm – backing vocals\n* Luke Brown – backing vocals\n* Adie Camp – backing vocals\n* Jean-Luc Lajoie – backing vocals\nString Section (Tracks 4, 5, 7)\n* Phillip Keveren – string arrangements (4, 7)\n* Don Chapman – string arrangements (5)\n* Monisa Angell, John Catchings, Janet Darnall, Jim Grosjean, Sarighani Reist, Pamela Sixfin and Karen Winklemann – string players\nProduction\n* Brandon Ebel – executive producer\n* Tyson Paoletti – executive producer, A&R\n* Brown Bannister – producer, overdub recording\n* Jeremy Camp – co-producer\n* Steve Bishir – recording\n* Colin Heldt – recording assistant\n* Mike Carr – recording assistant\n* Billy Whittington – additional engineer, digital editing\n* Kent Hooper – additional engineer, digital editing\n* Ron Robinson – additional engineer, digital editing\n* Craig Swift – additional engineer, digital editing\n* Dave Dillbeck – additional engineer, digital editing\n* F.
