The 1975 Vikings had an even easier schedule than the often-criticized one of the unbeaten Dolphin team, and in fact had according to Eddie Epstein clearly the easiest schedule of any team between 1950 and 2001, with their fourteen opponents having a winning percentage excluding Vikings games of .346. According to Pro-Football-Reference.com, only the Super Bowl-winning 1999 Rams have since had a weaker schedule than the 1975 Vikings, playing only one opponent with a winning record during the regular season. Nine of fourteen opponents finished 4–10 or worse, and like the 1972 Dolphins only two had winning records. Football journalists noted during their streak how the Vikings had been playing very weak schedules for several seasons and flattered thereby.\nThe Vikings’ 10–0 start was not subsequently equaled until the 1984 Miami Dolphins began 11–0. They sealed their third straight NFC Central title on Thanksgiving Day in this same week when the Detroit Lions lost to the Los Angeles Rams.\nThe Vikings finished with a record of 12 wins and two losses, before losing to the Dallas Cowboys, 17–14 in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game at home due to a play known as the \"Hail Mary\". Earlier in the season, the New York Jets made their first appearance in Minnesota in a much-anticipated match between Super Bowl quarterbacks Fran Tarkenton and Joe Namath, in what had been the first regular season game sold out during the summer.\nThird year halfback Chuck Foreman became the first Vikings running back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season.\nOffseason\n1975 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1975 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!
