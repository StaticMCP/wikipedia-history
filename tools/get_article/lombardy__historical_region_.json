Since the 1400s Piedmont became more and more culturally autonomous from the rest of Lombardy, and by the 1600s there was a substantial partition between Lombardy and Piedmont, the latter being ruled by the House of Savoy.\nThe ancient concept of Lombardy has kept surfacing in a few placenames until the modern era, e.g. Massa Lombarda (in Romagna) or Reggio di Lombardia (in Emilia, known as Reggio nell'Emilia since the unification of Italy).\nReferences"
