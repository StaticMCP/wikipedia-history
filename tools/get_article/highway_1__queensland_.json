Highway 1 continues around the rest of Australia, joining all mainland state capitals, and connecting major centres in Tasmania. All roads within the Highway 1 system are allocated a road route numbered 1, M1, A1, or B1, depending on the state route numbering system. In Queensland, the highway is designated as National Route 1 from the NT border to Cairns, Route A1 from Cairns to Kybong, and then Route M1 down to the NSW border.\nHistory\nHighway 1 was created as part of the National Route Numbering system, adopted in 1955. The route was compiled from an existing network of state and local roads and tracks.\nRoute description\nThe Savannah Way is the largely unsignposted route for Highway 1 between the Northern Territory border and Normanton.\nFrom there, it follows the Gulf Developmental Road, Kennedy Highway and Captain Cook Highway to Cairns. Highway 1 then travels southwards along the Queensland Coast along Bruce Highway to Brisbane. The highway travels through Brisbane as the Gateway Motorway, and continues south as the Pacific Motorway, towards the Gold Coast, and subsequently, the New South Wales border.\nThe following sections, which are freeways or dual carriageways, are designated as route M1:\n* Bruce Highway from Kybong to Bald Hills.\n* Gateway Motorway from Bald Hills to Eight Mile Plains.\n* Pacific Motorway from Eight Mile Plains to the New South Wales Border, linking 'directly' with the Tugun Bypass.\nDevelopment of the M1\nWith the completion of Section C of the Bruce Highway - Cooroy to Curra upgrade project (Traveston to Woondum) in February 2018 the M1 has now been extended to Kybong,  south of Gympie. The Bruce Highway from Kybong to Gympie remains signed as A1. Section D of the project (Woondum to Curra, including a bypass of Gympie) will, when completed, become the next stage of the M1.\nNote: While the references use Woondum as a designator for sections of the project the new intersection that marks the end of the M1 is wholly within the locality of Kybong, although bordered on two sides by Woondum.\nMajor intersections\n*  Kennedy Developmental Road (State Route&nbsp;62)\n*  Mulligan Highway (State Route&nbsp;81)\n*  Captain Cook Highway (State Route&nbsp;44)\n*  Gillies Highway (State Route&nbsp;52)\n*  Palmerston Highway (State Route&nbsp;25)\n*  Flinders Highway (A6)\n*  Peak Downs Highway (State Route&nbsp;70)\n*  Capricorn Highway (A4)\n*  Burnett Highway (A3)\n*  Dawson Highway (State Route&nbsp;60)\n*  Isis Highway (State Route&nbsp;52)\n*  Wide Bay Highway (State Route&nbsp;49)\n*  Gateway Motorway (M2)\nReferences\nSee also\n* Highway 1 (New South Wales)\n* Highway 1 (Northern Territory)\n* Highway 1 (South Australia)\n* Highway 1 (Tasmania)\n* Highway 1 (Victoria)\n* Highway 1 (Western Australia)"
