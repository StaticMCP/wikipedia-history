It took place on December 29, 1991, from the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia. The event consisted of the Battlebowl battle royal and its \"Lethal Lottery\" tag team qualifying matches. 40 wrestlers, paired in randomly chosen tag teams, competed in qualifying matches; the winning team advanced to the 20-man double elimination Battlebowl Battle Royal to determine the winner.\nThis was the first Starrcade under the WCW (instead of the NWA) banner and the first to not include Ric Flair, who had left for the World Wrestling Federation. Sting won Battlebowl, and his victory led to a feud with Lex Luger over the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. In 2015, All WCW pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network.\nStorylines\nThe event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes or villains in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nBefore Starrcade, Sting was in a feud with both Rick Rude and Lex Luger. On July 14, Lex Luger won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, and vacated the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship because of this. Sting won a tournament to become the new WCW United States Heavyweight Champion on August 25, and this put Sting in contention for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Luger saw Sting as a threat, and had Abdullah the Butcher and Cactus Jack attempt to injure Sting. On October 27, Rude made his return, and he made Sting his first target. Finally, at Clash of the Champions XVII, Luger ambushed Sting, and injured his knee. This allowed Rude to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship from Sting later that night.\nEvent\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentator\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Tony Schiavone\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Referees\n|Mike Atkins\n|-\n|Randy Anderson\n|-\n|Nick Patrick\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Presenters\n|Eric Bischoff\n|-\n|Missy Hyatt\n|-\n|Battlebowl Commissioner\n|Magnum T.

Sting won the match and the title. Afterwards, Luger left World Championship Wrestling to join the World Bodybuilding Federation as a co-host of WBF BodyStars, a weekly television program.That was also a vehicle for Luger to eventually join the World Wrestling Federation, who owned the WBF. He would return to WCW in September 1995.  Sting continued his feud with Rick Rude as well as the other members of The Dangerous Alliance. The feud ended when Sting and his allies defeated the Dangerous Alliance in a WarGames match at WrestleWar. Sting then feuded with Big Van Vader (also managed by Race) over the title, and the feud continued for over a year.\nReception\nJ.D. Dunn of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 5.0 [Not So Good], stating, \"If you're looking for good wrestling, you can look elsewhere. On the other hand, it does have some good booking as far as stirring up feuds. The problem is that you only get a sense of that if you watch the shows before and after it in succession. Call it a mild thumbs [up] in conjunction with the other shows, but an easy thumbs down if you just sit down to watch a wrestling show.\nMild thumbs down.\"\nResults\nSee also\n* WCW/New Japan Supershow I\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.retroprowrestling.com/2022/08/ppv-review-wcw-starrcade-1991.html/ Starrcade 1991 Review at Retro Pro Wrestling]\n*[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/65437 Starrcade 1991 Review at 411mania]\n*[http://wcwrules4lyf.wordpress.com/2008/03/01/starrcade-1991/ Starrcade 1991 Review at The Powerdriver Review]"
