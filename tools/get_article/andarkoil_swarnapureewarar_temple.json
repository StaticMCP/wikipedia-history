However, since he did not wish to have dinner without having a darshan of Shiva, he had to go hungry. Shiva appeared in his dream and pointed out he would appear to his devotee at a nearby location. Kandadevar found a shivalinga at the prescribed spot and built a temple there with stone and mortar collected from passers-by. When Muchkunda learned of this, he charged Kandadevar with extorting his subjects and beheaded him. However, later Muchkunda realised his folly and tried to kill himself. At that instant, Shiva appeared before him and restored the minister to life.\nSignificance\nIt is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. The Saivite saint Thirunavukkarasar sang praises of the temple in his Thevaram.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
