It was designed by Victor Lundy, a member of the Sarasota School of Architecture. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The motel is located at 12597 South Tamiami Trail.\nThe motel is known for its mushroom champagne glass style roof and glass walls, allowing guests to see the stars. It was selected by the American Institute of Architects for the 1958 Special Awards.\nLundy wrote in a 1958 issue of The Florida Association of Architects: \"I was searching for a form that would somehow symbolize the thought of the Fountain of Youth by a plastic flowing shape, that would also echo the organic growing shape of a tree. The answer came in the adoption of a structural system based on using precast concrete hyperbolic paraboloids, 14ft-5in square (from basic motel unit width-requirement, plus necessary overlap) in two heights arranged in a U-shaped plan (the remaining wing will be added shortly). Three of the so called shells were lifted up on higher columns of varying height to form the sign of the motel, as a free-standing piece of sculpture.\"\nThe reception desk is original (from 1958). The pool area was added in 1990.\nGallery\nWarm Mineral Springs Motel front office view.JPG|Motel office\nWarm Mineral Springs Motel left side view from front to back.JPG|Parking lot side\nFL Warm Mineral Spring Motel08.jpg|Walkway and some of the rooms\nFL Warm Mineral Spring Motel sign02.jpg|Current motel sign (not original)\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sarasota County, Florida\n* List of motels\n*\nReferences"
