It was built by the then newly-formed Edinburgh Cemetery Company, and occupies around  of land on a slightly sloping site. It contains many tens of thousands of graves, including notable Victorian and Edwardian figures, the most eminent being the physician Sir James Young Simpson.\nIt is located on the north side of the Water of Leith, and has an impressive landscape; partly planned, partly unplanned due to recent neglect. It lies in the Inverleith Conservation Area and is also a designated Local Nature Conservation Site. The cemetery is protected as a Category A listed building.\nIn July 2013 the Friends of Warriston Cemetery was inaugurated to reveal the heritage and to encourage appropriate biodiversity.\nThe address of the cemetery is 40C Warriston Gardens, Edinburgh EH3 5NE.\nHistory\nDesigned in 1842 by Edinburgh architect David Cousin, the cemetery opened in 1843: the directors included Cousin and James Peddie (father of John Dick Peddie).\nThe first interment was towards the east, Margaret Parker, who was buried on 3 June 1843.\nIt was the first garden cemetery in Edinburgh, allowing the simplistic original title of The Edinburgh Cemetery, and provided a model for several other Scottish cemeteries. In its own right it was broadly based on ideas first introduced at Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Designed elements include a neo-Tudor line of catacombs. Their length was doubled in 1862 by architect John Dick Peddie. The chapel that once stood on top of the catacombs was demolished by 1930.\nSoon after instigation (in 1845) the cemetery was divided by the Edinburgh Leith and Newhaven Railway which was built east to west through its southern half. A tunnel was added, with Gothic archways at its mouths, to link the north and south sections, but the south being smaller, was the inferior area from this date onwards. The embankments of the railway have been partly removed following its closure in the 1950s, and the line is now a public walkway.\nIn 1929, the Edinburgh Cemetery Company expanded their business into the new field of cremation, converting  East Warriston House (1818) into Warriston Crematorium on an adjacent site to the east. The architect was Sir Robert Lorimer, hence the title Lorimer Chapel for the main chapel. The crematorium was extended to the west in 1967 by the architect Esme Gordon. The cemetery lodge to the north-west dates from 1931 and was designed by architect J. R. McKay.\nThe cemetery was in private ownership until 1994, when it was compulsorily purchased by the City of Edinburgh Council. The long task of restoring the heavily overgrown and vandalised cemetery has begun, but still has far to go. Currently, only the upper (westmost) section is maintained. Many sections are now so densely overgrown that the stones are no longer visible and are simply bumps in the green undergrowth.\nArguably, the overgrown nature of the cemetery is its most attractive quality. There is something enchanting about wandering in amongst the head- and tomb-stones covered in ivy with a rich canopy of deciduous trees above, forming a natural mausoleum.\nMonuments of architectural note\nThe Robertson mortuary chapel was erected in 1865 for Mary Ann Robertson (1826–1858), daughter of Brigadier-General Manson of the Bombay Artillery. The white marble shrine contained a sculpture of a reclining female figure, and was topped by a red glass roof, leading to the local nickname, the Tomb of the Red Lady. The monument was heavily vandalised and had to be demolished in the late 1980s.\nSir James Young Simpson's grave remains visible but the lower section has been infilled with earth to provide space for further burial.\nSeveral eminent sculptors' work is found in the cemetery, including a fine portrait of William Young, horticulturist (1816–1896) by William Birnie Rhind, a monument to Robert Bryson by Thomas Stuart Burnett, and a wealth of fine ornate Celtic crosses by the McGlashens. A sizeable arched pedestal to the Rev James Peddie (d. 1845) by John Dick Peddie is also of note.\nNotable persons interred and cremated\nInterred\nand his wife]]\n* George Aikman (1830–1905) artist and engraver\n* Joseph Anderson (antiquarian) (1832–1916) keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities, and his son David Anderson, Lord St Vigeans\n* Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921) architect\n* George Angus (architect) (1798–1845)\n* John Hutton Balfour (1808–1884) botanist\n* Dr William Beilby (1783–1849) physician\n* Thomas Vernon Bell MD (1824-1903) homeopath\n* Adam Black (1784–1874), publisher, Lord Provost and Member of Parliament for Edinburgh\n* Samuel Blackburn (1813–1856) portrait artist\n* Hippolyte Blanc (1844–1917), architect\n* William Graham Boss (1847–1927) stained glass designer\n* Major General James Roper Boswall (1826–1883)\n* John Crawford Brown (1805–1867) landscape artist\n* Sir William Slater Brown (1844-1917) Lord Provost of Edinburgh 1909-12\n* William Alexander Bryson FRSE (d. 1906) creator of the public electric lighting system in Leith in 1897 (one of the first in the world) - stone vandalised\n* Alexander Buchan (meteorologist) (1829–1907), creator of the map-based weather forecast\n* Sir John James Burnet (1857–1938), architect\n* Archibald Burns (1831–1880), photographer\n* Rev Dugald Butler (1862-1926) author (in the Marwick grave)\n* William Archibald Cadell FRSE (1775–1855) historian, mathematician and owner of the Carron Company\n* James Cadenhead (1858–1927) artist\n* Dr Colin Cadman (1916–1971), plant pathologist and mycologist\n* Robert Macfarlane Cameron (1860–1920) architect\n* Lorne MacLaine Campbell (1902–1991) Victoria Cross recipient\n* Sir John Cheyne (1841–1907)\n* Sir Thomas Clark (1823–1900), Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1865–1888)\n* James Scarth Combe (1795-1883) physician\n* Prof Arthur Connell (1794–1863), FRSE\n* Alexander Hunter Crawford (1865–1945) architect\n* William Crawford (1858-1926) creator of Crawfords Biscuits\n* Mary Crudelius (1839–1877) early campaigner for female education\n* John Cumming (artist) (1824–1908) father of William Skeoch Cumming\n* John Cunningham (architect) (1799–1873)\n* James Currie (shipowner) (1863–1930), owner of the Currie Line\n* Commodore James Dalgleish (1891–1964)\n* Sir David Deas (1807–1876), naval physician, with his architect son, Francis William Deas (1862–1951)\n* George Deas, Lord Deas (1804–1887)\n* William H.
