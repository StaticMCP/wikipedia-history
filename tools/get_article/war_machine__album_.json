      "text": "# War Machine (album)\n\nWar Machine is a 1980 studio album by Andrea True. It was her first and only solo LP, after two albums under the Andrea True Connection moniker released in the 1970s. War Machine was a departure from True's previous disco output, exploring new wave and rock music. The album is \"dedicated to world peace and finding alternate solutions to energy problems and wars\", with its title track carrying an anti-war message. The LP was released only in Italy by Italian label Ricordi International and was not commercially successful. It has never been released in any other format and is now a rare collectible item.\nSingles\nThe title track \"War Machine\" was released as a single by Ricordi International in Italy in 1980, and was accompanied by a music video. \"Make My Music for Me\" was released as a single by Atom in Austria the following year. For some unknown reason, the label changed the name of the song, which had appeared on the album as \"Makin' Music for Money\". Neither of the two singles was successful in music charts.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Andrea True – lead vocals, Moog, percussion, production\n* Tony D'Ambra – backing vocals, drums\n* Tom Bakas – backing vocals, guitar, bass\n* Tom Carey – backing vocals, bass\n* Jim Callen – backing vocals, bass\n* Mark Lineberry – backing vocals, guitar\n* Robert W.
