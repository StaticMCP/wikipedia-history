Chiang Kai-shek sent troops into Burma from Yunnan in 1942 to assist the British in holding back the Japanese. These Chinese forces became broken up, and in the retreat out of Burma part of these forces entered India. These were  cantoned at Ramgarh Cantonment in the Bihar Province (now in Jharkhand State), brought up to five-Division strength (Chinese New 30th,  New 22nd, New 38th, 14th and 50th Divisions), and re-equipped and re-trained by American instructors at British expense.\nEach of the five divisions had about 15,000 troops, for a total of 75,000 for the whole force. The New 30th and New 38th Divisions formed the New 1st Army which was commanded by Sun Li-Jen. The New 22nd, 14th and 50th Divisions formed the New 6th Army which was commanded by Liao Yaoxiang.}}\nSee also\n* India-China Division\n* China Burma India Theater\n* Northern Combat Area Command\n* New 1st Army\n* Burma Road\n* V Force\n* Z Force (Burma)\n* Chinese Expeditionary Force (Burma)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
