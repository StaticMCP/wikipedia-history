The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorized the president to proclaim \"historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest\" as national monuments.\nOther protective national designations, including those of the National Park Service, must be created by congressional legislation.\nInterior Department memorandum\nIn a 2010 \"Not for Release\" memorandum by the United States Department of the Interior, 14 areas were listed in the \"Prospective Conservation Designation\" attachment as \"good candidates for National Monument designation under the Antiquities Act\". Those areas are included in the lists below, shaded bluish-green.\nIn subsequent attachments in the same draft, \"areas worthy of protection that are ineligible for Monument Designation and unlikely to receive legislative protection in the near term\" and \"cost estimates\" of \"high priority land-rationalization efforts\" were listed.\nMonuments for All Campaign\nDuring the Biden Administration, coalitions of numerous conservation, Native American, and Black groups coalesced to form the Monuments for All campaign, to coincide with the \"America the Beautiful\" and \"30x30\" initiatives from the Biden Administration. These groups called on President Biden to designate numerous National Monuments under the Antiquities Act, many from the 2010 Memorandum that were not designated by President Obama. These groups successfully lobbied for the restoration of Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument from President Trump's cuts, as well as Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and Castner Range, Chuckwalla National Monument, and Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, among others. The undesignated monuments covered this campaign are colored blue below.\nProposed national monuments\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!scope=\"col\" |Proposed name\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Photo\n!scope=\"col\" |Location\n!scope=\"col\" |Area\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|External information\n|- style=\"background: #CEF2E0\"\n|  Bodie Hills\n|\n| California\n|\n|\n|-\n| Birthplace of Rivers\n|\n| West Virginia\n|\n| [http://www.birthplaceofrivers.org/ BirthplaceofRivers.org]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20160401160857/http://www.wvrivers.org/ProtectingHeadwaters/BirthplaceOfRivers West Virginia Rivers Coalition]  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDBO0iVSBGk Video by Pew & This American Land]\n|-\n|Douglas-Fir National Monument\n|\n|Oregon\n|530,000 acres\n(214,500 ha)\n|  [https://www.douglasfirnationalmonument.org/membership.html#:~:text=The%20Friends%20of%20the%20Douglas,public%20and%20to%20elected%20officials.
