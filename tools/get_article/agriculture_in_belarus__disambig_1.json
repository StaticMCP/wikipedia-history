In 2023, it employed 6.9% of the workforce, generated 7.2% of GDP. In 2020, it was responsible for 19.9% of exports. 20% more than it produced, suggesting these high numbers are likely due to re-exports.}}\nIt is mostly conducted by large-scale agricultural organizations that are heavily subsidized by the state, with minimal input from individual farmers. It can be divided into two segments: livestock and crops, which generate roughly equal production.\nThe main produce of Belarusian agriculture are milk, sugar beet, potatoes, wheat, barley, and rapeseed. Its main agricultural exports are rapeseed, beef, poultry and milk.\nHistory\nBelarus has been characterized by some as a slow land reformer compared to other CIS countries.\nThere have been no major shifts in the number of animals between collective and family farms since independence in 1995: the family farm sector (mainly household plots) controlled 11%–16% of the total cattle herd and 30%–40% of the number of pigs between 1980 and 2005. Poultry, on the other hand, has become concentrated to a greater extent in collective farms, with the share of family farms dropping from more than 40% in the 1980s to less than 30% since 1995.\nThe share of agriculture in GDP declined from 11.6% in 2000 to 7.4% in 2007, while the share of agriculture in total employment dropped from 14.1% to 9.9% over the same period. The decrease in agricultural employment is a long-term trend and back in the early 1990s agriculture's share was as high as 19% of the number of employed. The decrease of agricultural labor parallels the general urbanization trends, as the share of rural population in Belarus steadily declines over time.\nHistorical statistics\nCrops\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Sown area in thousand hectares, by year\n|-\n!  !! 1913 !! 1935 !! 1940 !! 1945 !! 1950 !! 1955 !! 1960 !! 1965 !! 1970 !! 1975 !! 1980 !! 1985 !! 1990 !! 1995 !! 2000 !! 2005 !! 2010 !! 2015\n|-\n| Potatoes\n| 583\n| 670\n| 929\n| 746\n| 875\n| 981\n| 1,028\n| 1,003\n| 956\n| 879\n| 787\n| 708\n| 638\n| 725\n| 661\n| 467\n| 371\n| 507\n|-\n| Vegetables\n| 42\n| 60\n| 62\n| 50\n| 42\n| 43\n| 50\n| 48\n| 48\n| 48\n| 54\n| 47\n| 41\n| 77\n| 98\n| 89\n| 86\n| 66\n|-\n| Sugar beet\n|\n|\n|\n| 2\n| 5\n| 19\n| 29\n| 59\n| 49\n| 52\n| 52\n| 59\n| 46\n| 55\n| 52\n| 100\n| 97\n| 103\n|-\n| Forage crops\n| 159\n| 298\n| 433\n| 119\n| 302\n| 778\n| 1,675\n| 1,738\n| 2,224\n| 2,342\n| 2,038\n| 2,404\n| 2,554\n| 2,451\n| 2,602\n| 2,289\n| 2,066\n| 2,663\n|-\n| Rye\n| 2,007\n| 1,093\n| 1,284\n| 1,250\n| 1,540\n| 1,454\n| 1,435\n| 1,715\n| 858\n| 808\n| 1,074\n| 1,015\n| 917\n| 969\n| 723\n| 537\n| 352\n| 252\n|-\n| Wheat\n| 86\n| 204\n| 262\n| 149\n| 239\n| 364\n| 162\n| 187\n| 442\n| 196\n| 209\n| 195\n| 140\n| 177\n| 452\n| 361\n| 611\n| 737\n|-\n| Triticale\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 38\n| 99\n| 363\n| 444\n| 512\n|-\n| Barley\n| 357\n| 298\n| 377\n| 469\n| 348\n| 294\n| 249\n| 398\n| 717\n| 1,134\n| 1,218\n| 918\n| 1,030\n| 1,033\n| 736\n| 615\n| 691\n| 507\n|-\n| Oats\n| 869\n| 551\n| 794\n| 606\n| 654\n| 574\n| 400\n| 195\n| 277\n| 290\n| 391\n| 380\n| 360\n| 337\n| 285\n| 232\n| 184\n| 154\n|-\n| Buckwheat\n| 194\n| 133\n| 245\n| 176\n| 294\n| 356\n| 131\n| 96\n| 41\n| 29\n| 44\n| 38\n| 18\n| 18\n| 22\n| 8\n| 31\n| 14\n|-\n| Legumes\n| 91\n| 123\n| 167\n| 139\n| 273\n| 222\n| 206\n| 290\n| 169\n| 146\n| 203\n| 270\n| 172\n| 119\n| 198\n| 154\n| 138\n| 160\n|-\n!

Agricultural land in Belarus is state-owned and can only be rented.\n,1,485 agricultural organizations were in operation. These organizations controlled 89.8% of agricultural land and generated 78.2% of all agricultural output. Roughly a third of them were privately owned, 40% had shared ownership with the government, and the remainder were under government control.\nThere were 3,822 private farms, which controlled 4.0% of the land and generated 2.9% of the output. On average, each private farm had three workers. They have better financial outcomes than agricultural organizations, showing a profitability of 20.8% compared to an overall average of 6.4%. Household plots controlled 5.0% of the land and were responsible for 18.9% of the output, including 37.7% of the total crop output. whose yield per hectare is almost ten times larger than that of cereals. Comparing crops of similar types, household plots are clearly the least efficient.}}\nIn terms of regional distribution, 26.2% of the value was produced in the Minsk region, while 40.7% came from the Western regions of Brest and Grodno, where the soil is, on average, more fertile.\nGovernment support\nEvery five years since 1995, Belarus has launched programs to boost its agricultural sector, with the goal of ensuring food security and generating export revenue. In 2008, Belarus's Vice Prime Minister claimed that Belarusian agriculture was 60% subsidized, compared to 15-30% globally. In 2011, Alexander Lukashenko stated that the amount of subsidies to the sector in the 2000s totaled $40 billion and that they should be lowered. The goal was subsequently achieved, and by the mid-2010s, subsidies amounted to 20-30% of agricultural output, a figure consistent with EU levels.\nThese subsidies are provided through limited taxation (effectively around 1%), cheap loans with negative real interest rates, regular debt forgiveness, free insurance, and lower costs for fuel, machinery, electricity, and other goods and services. During the 2000s, subsidies accounted for 7-9% of the government budget or 3-5% of GDP.\nProduction\n, 5,756 thousand hectares were used for crops. In the same year, agriculture generated 7.2% of GDP,}} employed 6.9% of workers, and accounted for up to a fifth of exports in 2020., 2020 was the last year for which detailed export statistics were published by Belarus; data since then is mostly estimates. Data on trade with Russia is likely the most obscure. In 2023, total agricultural exports were $7.9 billion out of $43.7 billion overall.}} Belarus achieved self-sufficiency in everything except fruits, for which consumption is a third higher than production.\nCrops constituted 46.6% of agricultural output, of which 16.1% were vegetables and 9.8% were cereals, while livestock production was 53.4%, with milk accounting for 32.5% of it. By volume, 1.4 million cows produce roughly 7.8 million tonnes of milk, and products derived from it generated $263 million in exports.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Production in 2023\n|-\n!
