He was professor emeritus of economics and statistics at UCLA Anderson School of Management who was Chauncey J. Medberry Professor of Management and director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.\nLife and career\nLeamer attended Princeton (B.A., mathematics, 1966) and the University of Michigan (M.A., mathematics, Ph.D., economics, 1970).\nLeamer was the author of five books and over 100 articles on a range of subjects especially including applied econometrics and quantitative international economics.\nLeamer was the vice presidential nominee on Laurence Kotlikoff's independent ticket in the 2016 US presidential election.\nLeamer was known amongst economists for his paper \"Let's Take the Con Out of Econometrics\", widely referred to as Leamer's critique, which is said to have catalyzed the implementation of more rigorous research designs in the economic sciences.\nHe was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Econometric Society. In honor of Leamer's championing of transparency in economic research, the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences in 2015 launched a three-year series of awards known as the Leamer–Rosenthal Prizes for Open Social Science (which also honored UC Riverside psychologist Robert Rosenthal) to recognize academics committed to engaging in transparent research practices and pioneering new methods to increase the rigor of research.\nLeamer died at his home in Los Angeles on February 25, 2025, at the age of 80.\nSelected publications\n;Books\n* 1970.
