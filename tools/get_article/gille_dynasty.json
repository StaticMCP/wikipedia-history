It is very unlikely that the rulers ever referred to the Gille dynasty which is a term coined by modern historians. The term \"Gille\" is probably derived from the Middle Irish Gaelic Gilla Críst, i.e. servant of Christ.\nKing Harald IV of Norway started the Gille (or Gylle dynasty), a putative cadet branch of the Hardrada dynasty (and by extension the Fairhair) dynasty. Harald Gille arrived in Norway from Ireland or the Hebrides and claimed to be the natural son of King Magnus Barefoot whose reign was marked by aggressive military campaigns and conquest, particularly in the Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles.  From historical sources, his claim seems to have been based largely upon stories told by his mother and her family during his youth.\nApproximately from the accession of Harald to the throne, the civil war era in Norway  (Borgerkrigstida)  lasted from 1130 to 1240. His descendants would expand the influence, wealth and power of the dynasty. The royal house replaced the Hardrada dynasty in 1135, and was again replaced by scion of the Hardrada dynasty in 1162. The line was briefly restored under Inge II Baardson, a cognatic descendant of the dynasty, but was replaced again by the House of Sverre in 1217.\nList of kings and rival kings\nThe rulers within the royal house would often have a rival who opposed the established king's right to rule the realm and dominions. Here is a list of the rulers during the period the house held the power in Norway:\n*Harald Gille : 1130–1136\n*Sigurd II of Norway Sigurd Munn : 1136–1155\n*Eystein II of Norway (Øystein Haraldsson) : 1142–1157\n*Inge I of Norway Inge the Hunchback (Inge Krokrygg) : 1136–1161\n*Haakon II of Norway Haakon Broadshoulder (Håkon Herdebreid) : 1157–1162\n**Sigurd Markusfostre : 1162–1163, rival king\n**Eystein Meyla Eystein the Maiden (Øystein Møyla) : 1174–1177, rival king\n**Jon Kuvlung : 1185–1188, rival king (pedigree uncertain)\n*Inge II of Norway (Inge Bårdsson) : 1204–1217\nKing Inge II Bårdsson belonged to the House of Gille cognatically, that is, through his mother. Patrilineally, both Inge II and his half-brother Duke Skule Bårdsson were members of the Rein dynasty, itself a cadet branch of the House of Godwin. Inge II was son of Bård of Rein, son of Guttorm of Rein, son of Åsulv of Rein, son of Skule Tostigsson, son of Tostig, Earl of Northumbria and of Kent, a brother of King Harold II of England.\nSee also\n*Civil war era in Norway\nReferences"
