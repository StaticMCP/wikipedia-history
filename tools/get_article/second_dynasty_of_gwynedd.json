The family was deposed in 1283 with the conquest of Wales by Edward I, and the execution of the last ruler of Gwynedd, Dafydd ap Gruffudd on October 3 of that year. The final politically active descendant of the main branch of the Second Dynasty of Gwynedd, Owain Lawgoch, was assassinated in July 1378.\nMerfyn Frych was the first ruler of Gwynedd not to be a male-line descendant of Cunedda and thus was not a member of the First Dynasty of Gwynedd, though he was married to a woman of this line. Therefore, the dynasty was known contemporaneously as the , literally 'descendants of Merfyn'. However, this name would and did also apply to the Dynasty of Deheubarth, who descendants of Anarawd's brother Cadell ap Rhodri, so modern scholarship refers to the branch of the family associated which ruled Gwynedd as the Second Dynasty of Gwynedd.\nEarly history\nIn the 9th century, Rhodri the Great () had inherited multiple Welsh Kingdoms, Gwynedd from his father Merfyn Frych (Manx Chieftain), Powys from his mother Nest and he added Seisyllwg (Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi) by a dynastic marriage to Angharad of Seisyllwg. Rhodri divided Wales into at least 3 provinces, his son Anarawd ap Rhodri was given the Kingdom of Gwynedd and founded the medieval dynasty the Second Dynasty of Gwynedd. Merfyn ap Rhodri was given the Kingdom of Powys. And another of Rhodri's sons, Cadell ap Rhodri was given the province of Deheubarth and began the House of Dinefwr. Wales was subsequently separated into North Wales, Mid Wales and South Wales respectively.\n]]\nSuccession\nRoyal succession within the Second Dynasty of Gwynedd (as with succession in Wales in general) was a complex matter due to the unique character of Welsh law. According to Hubert Lewis, though not explicitly codified as such, the edling, or heir apparent, was by convention, custom, and practice the eldest son of the lord or Prince and was entitled to inherit the position and title as \"head of the family\" from the father. This was effectively primogeniture with local variations. However, all sons were provided for out of the lands of the father, and in certain circumstances so too were daughters (with children born both in and out of wedlock considered legitimate). Men could also claim royal title through the maternal patrimony of their mother's line in certain circumstances (which occurred several times during the period of Welsh independence). The female line of the dynasty was also considered to remain royal, as marriage was an important means of strengthening individual claims to the various kingdoms of Wales and uniting various royal families to that of Aberffraw, or reuniting factions after dynastic civil wars (for example with the marriage of Hywel Dda, a member of the Dinefwr branch of the Aberffraw dynasty, and Elen of Dyfed, daughter of Llywarch ap Hyfaidd, King of Dyfed).\nCambro-Norse era\nDuring the Cambro-Norse era (850s1100s), Wales was subjected to Viking raids all throughout the country between 852 and 919 (the Jómsvíkinga saga refers to that period). An example of this pattern was with the Viking leader Ingimund who was expelled from Dublin and tried unsuccessfully to establish a base on Anglesey (), but instead left for Chester.\nThe Welsh Kingdoms had been subject to the Kingdom of Mercia from the 7th century onwards. This led to the construction of Offa's Dyke, a territorial land border between England and Wales built in the mid to late 8th century. However, war broke out against the English for decades from 853, this culminated in a victory for the Welsh Kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys against Mercia and Wessex and their Viking allies.\nRhodri the Great fought successfully against the Vikings, beginning with the death of Horn the Dane (leader of the 'New Dubliners') in 856. Rhodri was killed in battle against the Saxon leader Ceolwulf of Mercia in 878 AD. The Welsh avenged Rhodri with a victory over the Mercians at the Battle of the Conwy in 881. During this period, Rhodri Mawr's sons depended for protection on Viking mercenaries from Scandinavian York.\nThe second phase of Viking raids in Wales continued into the 10th century. Between the years 950–998, Wales saw raids, attacks, and slave raids with a devastating Viking raid happening at Aberffraw in 968. King Maredudd ab Owain paid the ransom for the return of Welsh victims of enslavement. Then, the third phase of Viking raids would coincide with the Norman invasion of Wales during the 11th century. This era saw a new alliance between the Vikings and the Second Dynasty through the marriage of Gruffudd ap Cynan's father Cynan ab Iago to the daughter of a Norseman after he took refuge in the Kingdom of Dublin. After several attempts to retake Gwynedd from the Normans, Gruffudd eventually succeeded with assistance from Magnus Barefoot (King of Dublin, King of Norway and King of the Isles) in 1098 when they won the Battle of Anglesey Sound against the English Normans together.\nPower base (Norman invasion)\nThe family were able to assert their influence within Gwynedd, their traditional sphere of influence, but by the 11th century they were ousted from Powys (Mid Wales) and Deheubarth (West Wales) by a series of strong rulers from the House of Dinefwr in Deheubarth, their dynastically junior cousins. The Dinefwr family were descended from the Cadell ap Rhodri, the second son of Rhodri the Great. However, under Gruffudd ap Cynan, the Second Dynasty was able to recover its heritage and position during the Norman invasion of Gwynedd (1081–1100) with Cynan as King of Gwynedd defeating the Norman invaders. Owain Gwynedd, Gruffudd's son defeated King Henry II of England and the vast Angevin host in the 1157 campaign and again in 1166. That led to Owain being proclaimed as the Prince of Wales () by other Welsh rulers. The proclamation reasserted and updated the Aberffraw claims to be the principal royal house of Wales, as senior line descendants of Rhodri the Great.}}}} However, after the death of Owain during 1170, 13 of his sons as the  descended into an internal bloody violence which became a cue for Prince Madog to flee the Kingdom and supposedly cross the Atlantic Ocean settling the New World, which today has become America. Madog's voyages are a part of the rediscovery of the Americas theory debate.\nAberffraw senior line\nBelow is a partial family tree of the dynasty of Gwynedd.\n*Gruffudd ap Cynan (c. 1055–1137), King of Gwynedd.\n** Owain Gwynedd (c. 1100 – 28 November 1170), King of Wales = Cristina ferch Gronw ap Owain ap Edwin.\n***Hywel Prince of Gwynedd, King of Ceredigion, c. 1139.}}\n****Caswallon}}\n***Iorwerth (died 1174).\n**** Llywelyn (c. 1173 – 11 April 1240), Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon.\n*** Rhodri (c. 1146–1195), Lord of Anglesey = Annest ferch Rhys ap Gruffudd.}}\nLlys\nThere were 22 administrative centres () in the Kingdom of Gwynedd to act as royal courts for the Princes of the . Below is an example of a couple of 'Llysoedd':\nRhosyr\nNearby Aberffraw at Newborough, Anglesey was Llys Rhosyr, where pottery and coins were excavated in the area dating between the years 12471314. The royal court was built during the reign of Prince Llywelyn and was first recorded on the 10 April 1237. Today a reconstruction is found in St. Fagans Museum in Cardiff, UK.\nAberffraw\nDuring , Prince Llywelyn the Great continued to convene the Royal court at Aberffraw to the high standard of the neighbouring English Kingdom The Prince's consort was Joan, daughter of King John of England, herself being a Princess who would have entertained court at Aberffraw for Welsh and English royalty. Llywelyn, as Prince, re-edified the rules of the 'royal suite', which were reenacted from the original laws and customs from the year 914 for the Aberffraw Royal Palace. The palace was known as \"the chief[e] house of the Prince of Gwynedd\" from its foundations during the reign of Rhodri the Great.\nThere were 35 court positions:\nThe Master of the Palace, The Domestic Chaplain / The Queen's Chaplain, The Steward of the Household / The Steward to the Queen, The Master of the Hawks, The Judge of the Palace, The Master of the Horse / Master of the Horse to the Queen, The Chamberlain / Queen's Chamberlain, The Domestic Bard, The Officer to Command Silence, The Master of the Hounds, The Metheglin (Mead brewer), The Physician of the Palace, The Cup Bearer, The Door Keeper, The Cook / The Queen's Cook, The Sconce bearer / The Queen's Sconce bearer, Woman of the Queen's Chamber, The Door-Keeper to the Queen, The Groom of the Rein, Officer to Support the Prince's Feet at Banquets, The Bailiff of the Royal Demesne, The Apparitor, The Gate-Keeper, The Watchmen of the Palace, The Woodman, The Baker Woman, The Palace Smith, The Laundress, The Chief of Song.\nThe setup of the Royal court was vast with a minimum of 47 positions necessary daily, and in some positions, multiple people would be needed. The hall at Aberffraw Palace would have been small. It was Llywelyn ap Gruffudd's room in Harlech Castle which was projected to be the same size as Aberffraw, that is, 15 feet wide and 40 feet long. During 1317, the hall was dismantled, with its timbers being reused in the construction of Caernarfon Castle.\nPrinces of Wales (de facto)\nThe Kingdoms of Wales defended their territory from Anglo-Normans and subsequent Kings of England's military expeditions 21 times between 10811267. It was King Edward I of England who finally suppressed the Welsh Principality after Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn I, the Great) and his grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn II) had controlled all of medieval Wales. As Llywelyn II was a second son and direct (lineal) descendant of Rhodri Mawr and Owain Gwynedd, his succession caused a number of problems within the Second Dynasty. The 13th century Llywelyns, rulers of Wales controlled their neighbouring Kingdoms through a political framework whilst excluding and subduing the descendants of Norman marcher lords through warfare.\nLlywelyn the Great\nBy 1203 Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn I, the Great) had followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, Owain Gwynedd, and unified the divided Kingdom of Gwynedd. He further advanced to conquer all of Wales by 1207. King John I of England (Llywelyn's father-in-law) intervened in Powys returning the Kingdom to Prince Gwenwynwyn in 1209, however, the intervention caused a retaliation in the form of the Welsh uprising of 1211. Llywelyn would gain favour from Pope Innocent III who excommunicated King John and encouraged the Welsh Principality to rebel against English rule. After the signing of Magna Carta on the 15th of June 1215, Llywelyn was recognised as Prince and ruler of all Wales. In 1216 Llywelyn the Great had received the fealty and homage of the Dinefwr rulers of Deheubarth at the Council of Aberdyfi. With homage and fealty paid by other Welsh lords to Llywelyn at Aberdyfi, Llywelyn the Great became the de facto first Prince of Wales in the modern sense. This was confirmed in a 1218 meeting in Worcester, England, by the next English monarch, Henry III. Llywelyn acted as Overlord to other nobles. By 1230 Llywelyn styled himself as the Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon.\n1200s – 1400s\nDuring the 13th century, Wales was ruled by Dafydd ap Llywelyn (Dafydd II), son of Llywelyn the Great. After the death of Dafydd II, the power was given to his nephew, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Prince Llywelyn II) who was granted the title of Prince of Wales by his English compatriot Henry III at the Treaty of Montgomery during 1267. Prince Llywelyn II was killed in action campaigning for Welsh independence in Cilmeri, December 1282. Of the Aberffraw dynasty the final Prince of Wales was Dafydd ap Gruffydd (Prince Dafydd III). After the death of Dafydd III's brother, the prince himself would be tried for treason and executed in Shrewsbury, England by his once ally Edward I of England on 3 October 1283. The consequences of the 1282–83 Conquest of Wales by Edward I greatly reduced the influence of the family. King Edward I forced the remaining members of the family to surrender their claim to the title of Prince of Wales under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, which also abolished the independent Welsh peerage. The Aberffraw family members closest to Llywelyn II were imprisoned for life by Edward, while the more distant Aberffraw members went into deep hiding and fell into obscurity. Other members of the family did lay claim to their heritage; they included Owain Lawgoch as the lineal successor to Llywelyn II in the 14th century. After the 13th century Lords of Aberffraw had accomplished the title of Prince of Wales very few Welsh lords survived the English conquest of 1282/3. But another descendant was Owain Glyndŵr, he proclaimed himself as Prince of Wales in 1400 and successfully rebelled against the English Crown during the early 15th century.\nSuccession after the dynasty\nMerely a century after the end of the dynasty, it was the Meyrick () family of nearby Bodorgan who were given the Crown lease for the manor lands of the Aberffraw cantref. Llewelyn Ap Heilyn fought at the Battle of Bosworth alongside Henry VII of England. Also known as Henry Tudor, the King was a descendant of the Aberffraw dynasty via The Tudors of Penmynydd, they descended from Ednyfed Fychan, he was the Seneschal (effectively a Prime ministerial position in government) to Llywelyn the Great and his son Dafydd II. Then Heilyn's son Meurig ap Llewelyn became captain of the bodyguard to Henry VIII, and the same family was once again rewarded with an extension of the land's lease. To date, the Meurig family of the Aberffraw cantref is represented by the Tapps-Gervis-Meyrick baronets. Away from Anglesey, several post medieval Welsh families including the Wynn family of Gwydir (until ) and the Anwyl of Tywyn family became heirs of the dynasty as hereditary male line descendants of Owain Gwynedd.\nSee also\n* Kingdom of Gwynedd\n* List of rulers of Gwynedd\n* King of Wales\n* List of rulers in Wales\nFootnotes\nReferences\n}}\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  -\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
