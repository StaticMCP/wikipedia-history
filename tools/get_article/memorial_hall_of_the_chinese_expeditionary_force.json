Later, due to years of disrepair, cracks appeared on the monument. Based on the suggestions of the descendants and the local Chinese, the Chinese Embassy rebuilt the monument and the memorial hall, and properly preserved the main body of the old monument. In March 2019, the newly renovated Chinese Expeditionary Force Monument and Memorial Hall were officially unveiled and put into use.\nThe newly renovated monument is 9.7 meters high.\nReferences"
