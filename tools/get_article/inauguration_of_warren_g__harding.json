Harding as the 29th president of the United States was held on Friday, March 4, 1921, at the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. This was the 34th inauguration and marked the commencement of the only term of Warren G. Harding as president and of Calvin Coolidge as vice president. Harding died  into this term, and Coolidge succeeded to the presidency.\nChief Justice Edward D. White administered the presidential oath of office. Harding placed his hand on the Washington Inaugural Bible as he recited the oath.\nCoolidge was sworn in as vice president in the Senate Chamber, while Harding's swearing-in as president took place on the east portico of the Capitol, respectively, which Coolidge believed ruined \"all semblance of unity and continuity.\" Critic H. L. Mencken described Harding's inaugural address, writing, \"It is rumble and bumble. It is flap and doodle. It is balder and dash. But I grow lyrical.\"\nThis inauguration was the first in which an automobile was used to transport the president-elect and the outgoing president (Woodrow Wilson) to and from the Capitol. Wilson, still compromised by his 1919 stroke, did not attend the ceremony itself.\nSee also\n*Presidency of Warren G.
