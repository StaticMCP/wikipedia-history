The memorial is guarded by two stone lions made by WA Hoare. It was designed by Bournemouth's deputy architect Albert Edward Shervey, who copied the two lions (one sleeping, the other awake and roaring) from Antonio Canova's lions which guarded the tomb of Pope Clement XIII.\nThe war memorial stands near Bournemouth Town Hall and St. Andrew's Church, Richmond Hill.\nGallery\nFile:War Memorial Bournemouth - panoramio.jpg|Inscription - World War II\nFile:War memorial Bournemouth - panoramio (1).jpg|Inscription - World War I\nFile:Bournemouth, the cenotaph is an island^ - geograph.org.uk - 2559970.jpg|The cenotaph when the River Bourne flooded.\nFile:Bournemouth, Remembrance Day crowds - geograph.org.uk - 1038891.jpg|Remembrance Day, 2008.\nFile:Bournemouth, cenotaph renovation works - geograph.org.uk - 2098265.jpg|Renovation works, 2010.\nFile:Bournemouth, cenotaph in snow - geograph.org.uk - 2185093.jpg|Snowy day, 2010.\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Bournemouth\n*Grade II* listed war memorials in England\nReferences"
