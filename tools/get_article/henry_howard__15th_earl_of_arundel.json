His grandmother Anne, the dowager Countess of Arundel, arranged for Henry to be baptised and christened as \"Frederick Henry\" at Woodstock Palace in October 1608 with Queen Anne as godmother. The Queen's children Henry and Elizabeth were also present.\nHe studied at St John's College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1624.\nPublic life\nBefore ascending to the peerage, Lord Arundel had served as Member of Parliament for Arundel in the Parliament of England from 1628 until 1629. He was again elected to represent Arundel in March 1640, but was called to the House of Lords by writ of acceleration as Baron Mowbray, one of his father's subsidiary titles, before he could take his seat. He also represented Callan in the Parliament of Ireland in 1634.\nAfter his father's death in 1646, he became Earl of Arundel and the titular head of the Howard family. He had been due to inherit his mother's peerage (Baron Furnivall), but he pre-deceased her and upon her death in 1654 it was inherited by his eldest son Thomas.\nThe entailment\nHenry sought to control the succession to his property after his death. Toward that end, he placed in his will a shifting executory limitation so that title to some property would pass to his eldest son (who was mentally deficient) and then to his second son, and title to other property would pass to his second son, and then to his fourth son. The estate plan also included provisions for shifting the titles many generations later if certain conditions should occur.\nWhen his second son, Henry, succeeded to the elder brother's property, he did not want to pass the other property to his younger brother, Charles. Charles sued to enforce his interest, and the court (in this instance, the House of Lords) held that such a shifting condition could not exist indefinitely. The judges believed that tying up property too long beyond the lives of people living at the time was wrong, although the exact period was not determined for another 150 years.\nFamily\nLord Arundel married Lady Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, on 7 March 1626. They had nine sons (10 on list below?) and three daughters:\n*Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk (1626/27–1677), died without issue\n*Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk (1628–1683/84), had issue; (ancestor of 7th through 9th Dukes of Norfolk)\n*Philip Howard (1629–1694), Catholic Cardinal\n*Charles Howard (1630–1713), married Mary Tattershall (d. 1695), had issue; they were the grandparents of Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk;\n*Lady Anne Howard (born 1632)\n*Lady Catherine Howard (1634–1655)\n*Talbot Howard (born 1636)\n*Edward Howard (1637–1691), married Anne Wilbraham, had issue.\n*Francis Howard (1640–1683), died in Geele, Belgium as stated in his brother Cardinal Philip Howard's Biography.\n*Bernard Howard of Glossop (1641–1717), married Catherine Tattershall (died 1727, sister of his brother Charles's wife Mary) and had issue, including Bernard Howard II of Glossop, who married Anne Roper (died 1744), had issue, including Henry Howard of Glossop and Sheffield, who married Juliana Molyneux, had issue, including Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk (from who all subsequent Dukes of Norfolk descend) and Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard;\n*Esme Howard (1645–1728), had one daughter, who died unmarried\n*Lady Elizabeth Howard (1651–1705)\n*John Howard (1652–1711)\nAncestry\nReferences\n* [http://www.thepeerage.com/ thePeerage.com]\n* [http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/HOWARD1.htm#Thomas/ Tudor Palace]\n*\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-"
