It plays a role in implementing presidential directives, coordinating national policies, and overseeing state-level engagements. The court is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital.\nHistory\nThe Presidential Court dates back to the formation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971, when it was initially known as the Diwan (Presidential Court). This entity served as the official Office of the President, providing administrative support and facilitating communication between the President and various governmental bodies.\nOn 1 November 2004, under Federal Decree-Law No. 4 of 2004, the Diwan was restructured to form the Ministry of Presidential Affairs. This reorganization aimed to enhance the administrative and executive functions supporting the presidency. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan was appointed as the first Minister of Presidential Affairs, a position he has held since its inception.\nIn July 2022, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the UAE, issued a Federal Decree-Law renaming the Ministry of Presidential Affairs as the Presidential Court. This change was part of a broader effort to streamline governmental functions and reflect the evolving role of the institution in supporting the President's duties. The title of \"Minister of Presidential Affairs\" was accordingly updated to \"Minister of the Presidential Court,\" with Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan continuing in this role.\nLeadership\nThe Presidential Court is currently led by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who serves as the country's Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of the Presidential Court.\nSee also\n* Federal Supreme Council, the highest constitutional authority in the UAE;\n* Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the current president of the UAE;\n* Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Chairman of the Presidential Court.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://diwan.govu.ae Official website]"
