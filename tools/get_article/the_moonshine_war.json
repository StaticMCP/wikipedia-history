It stars Patrick McGoohan, Richard Widmark, Alan Alda, and Will Geer.\nPlot\nJohn \"Son\" Martin owns and operates a profitable still, making moonshine whiskey in Prohibition-era Kentucky. One day, he gets a visit from an old Army acquaintance, Frank Long, who is now an Internal Revenue agent.\nWhen Frank is unable to persuade Son to cut him in on the profits, or even reveal where the moonshine is hidden, in exchange for Frank looking the other way, Frank calls in the dangerous Dr. Emmett Taulbee, who uses more violent methods in getting what he wants.\nEmmett and his henchmen go too far, killing Sheriff Baylor and even Emmett's girlfriend when she tries to get away. Frank can see that he made a mistake, so he volunteers to help Son fend off the gang. Still outnumbered, Son finally tells Emmett's men where the moonshine is buried in exchange for his life. However, when the crooks start digging, they set off Son's buried dynamite.\nCast\n* Patrick McGoohan as Frank Long\n* Richard Widmark as Dr. Emmett Taulbee\n* Alan Alda as John W.
