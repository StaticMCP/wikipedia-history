Rt Hon John Bright, an English Radical politician, was nominated as a form of protest, and won the resulting by-election on 10 July 1869. He never took his seat in the Queensland Parliament; indeed it is unknown if he knew he was either nominated or elected.\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1868–1870\nReferences"
