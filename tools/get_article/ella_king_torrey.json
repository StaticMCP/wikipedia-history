She was president of San Francisco Art Institute from 1995 to 2002; and was known for creating opportunities for visual artists.\nEarly life and education\nElla King Torrey was born in 1957, in Bronxville in Westchester County, New York (state). She grew up both in Evansville, Indiana, and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her mother was Ella King Russell Torrey.\nShe graduated in art history in 1980, from Yale University. Her thesis was on the cultural effects of Barbie dolls. Torrey continued her studies at the University of Mississippi (UM), where deepened her learning on contemporary folk art, and Black quilt making traditions. While attending UM, Torrey worked with the Center for the Study of Southern Culture, and curated a traveling exhibition on folk art toys. Her master's thesis was on folk art painter, Theora Hamblett.\nCareer\nAfter graduating in 1985, Torrey became a program officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia, an NGO working on the creation of artists' subsidized housing, and fundraising for local music organizations. During her time at Pew, she founded and led the Pew Artists Fellowship Program.\nIn 1995, Torrey was elected president of the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI), where she worked to amend some of the structural problems related to the organizational finances. During her time at SFAI, she tripled the schools endowment, added a few new trustees, and generally improved the school's reputation. Torrey resigned in 2002, as SFAI faced financial problems, and after an auditing firm found irregularities in 2001.\nShe died on April 30, 2003, at the age of 45, in her home in the Potrero Hill neighborhood in San Francisco. The cause of death was not disclosed; however, some news reports attributed her death to suicide. Her memorial service was held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, with a second service was held at the Santa Monica Museum of Art (now Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles).\nAfter her death the Ella King Torrey Arts Fund was created at the Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia.
