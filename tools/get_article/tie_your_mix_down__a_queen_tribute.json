      "text": "# Tie Your Mix Down: A Queen Tribute\n\nTie Your Mix Down: A Queen Tribute is a Queen tribute album. It features various covers of Queen songs by various artists.  Despite the album's name, these songs are not remixes of original Queen material, but are cover versions performed by the artists themselves.  The covers are very techno and electronica influenced, and because of this the album is unpopular among the band's fans.\nTrack listing\n# Tie Your Mother Down (Die Krupps Remix) - 3:43 - May\n# Sheer Heart Attack (Chemical Whore Remix) - 3:42 - Mercury\n# Another One Bites the Dust (Meeks Remix) - 3:47 - Deacon\n# Keep Yourself Alive (Sigue Sigue Sputnik Remix) - 4:41 - May\n# Save Me (Interface Remix) - 4:11 - May\n# Get Down, Make Love (Die Krupps Remix) - 3:52 - Mercury\n# We are the Champions (Rosetta Stone Remix) - 4:01 - Mercury\n# I Want It All (Julian Beeston Remix) - 4:50 - May\n# We Will Rock You (KMFDM Remix) - 4:58 - May\n# It's Late (Sheep on Drugs Remix) - 4:02 - May\n# One Vision (Spahn Ranch Remix) - 4:22 - Queen\n# Killer Queen (System Effect Remix) - 3:51 - Mercury\nReferences"
