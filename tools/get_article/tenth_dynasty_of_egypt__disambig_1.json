At this time Egypt was not unified, and there is some overlap between these and other local dynasties. The Turin Canon lists eighteen kings for this royal line, but their names are damaged, unidentifiable, or lost.\nThe following is a possible list of rulers of the Tenth Dynasty based on the Turin Canon, as Egyptologists have differing opinions about the order of succession within the two dynasties. Among them, only Wahkare Khety and Merykare are undoubtedly attested by archaeological finds:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:1em auto;\" width=\"60%\"\n|+Tenth Dynasty (according to Hayes) (c. 2130 – 2040 BC)\n|-\n!
