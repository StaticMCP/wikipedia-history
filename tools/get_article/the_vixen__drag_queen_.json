Her appearance on the show was notable for raising a conversation around racial dynamics both among her fellow drag queens and in the show's fandom. She is the founder of Black Girl Magic, a drag show consisting of only African-American queens. In August 2020, she released Commercial Break, her debut album.\nEarly life\nTaylor was born to Sheri Jones. He started doing drag at a local bar called the Jeffery Pub in April 2013. His drag mother is Savannah Westbrooke. The drag name \"The Vixen\" comes from his love of 1920s vintage wear, and the word \"vixen\" comes in those searches.\nCareer\nThe Vixen is known for blending political activism and queer advocacy into her drag performances. She has been an outspoken critic about anti-black sentiment in America, including in white queer communities, stating, “you [often] have to choose between calling out racism or homophobia”.\nIn November 2016, Taylor founded \"Black Girl Magic\", a drag show consisting of only African-American queens. Drag Race alumni Dida Ritz and Shea Couleé were part of the first show. Her fellow season ten contestants Asia O'Hara, Monét X Change and Monique Heart were added to the line-up of the \"Black Girl Magic\" cast in June 2018.\nThe Vixen was announced as one of fourteen contestants for season ten of ''RuPaul's Drag Race on February 22, 2018. She won the episode two main challenge. In the third episode, she engaged in a verbal back-and-forth with fellow contestant Aquaria, which left Aquaria crying and The Vixen noting that the exchange “created the narrative [of] an angry black woman who has scared off the little white girl\". Although Aquaria eventually conceded the point and later came to her defense, The Vixen received online death threats from Drag Race'' fans afterwards. She faced more backlash after quarreling with competitor Eureka O'Hara in multiple episodes, most notably in episode 4 of Untucked. She was eliminated in seventh place after losing a lip sync to \"Groove Is in the Heart\" against Asia O'Hara. During the final reunion episode, she walked offstage after feeling cornered by moderator RuPaul who kept pressing her to revisit past confrontations with Aquaria and Eureka. Season six alum Courtney Act later criticized RuPaul for a lack of compassion during the exchange.\nOutside of Drag Race, The Vixen had a booth covered with the Black Girl Magic logo for the first annual Wakandacon in August 2018.\nShe became a sponsor for Grindr's \"Kindr\" public service announcement in September 2018, in an effort to stop racial discrimination in the app.\nMusic\nBefore her stint on Drag Race, The Vixen was a featured guest on Couleé's 2017 song \"Cocky\". She released her first solo single, \"Room pt. 1,\" in March 2018. She released \"Room pt. 2\" on September 28, 2018, with Couleé featured on the track. The Vixen was featured with other Chicago drag queens on the song \"Drag\" by Dorian Electra. On October 17, 2018, she released the song \"Demons, Witches & Bitches\" with DJ Shilow and Aja.\nThe Vixen's single \"Tea Party\" was released on December 11, 2018. She released her debut album, Commercial Break, on August 4, 2020.\nPersonal life\nThe Vixen is gay. Her former drag daughter is Delikate Doll. In 2023, she announced that she had moved from Chicago to New Orleans, Louisiana.\nFilmography\nMovies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|2016\n|Lipstick City\n|Red Dancer\n|Short film by Shea Coulee\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2018\n| scope=\"row\" | ''RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Herself\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Contestant (7th place)\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked (season 10)\n|-\n|ABC 7 Chicago\n|Guest\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|The Jam\n|Guest\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|2019\n|Empire\n|Drag queen\n|Episode: \"Never Doubt I Love\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|}\nMusic videos\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Artist\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2017\n|\"Cocky\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Shea Couleé\n|-\n|\"Ride\"\n|}\nWeb series\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2016\n|Cooking with Drag Queens\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Herself\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2018\n|Watcha Packin'?''\n|\n|-\n|Cosmo Queens\n|\n|-\n|Queen to Queen\n|\n|-\n|Countdown to the Crown\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2019\n|Hey Qween!\n|\n|-\n|Behind the Drag\n|\n|-\n|Detailz\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Queer Table\n|\n|-\n|2021\n| Bambi Bakes\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|}\nDiscography\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Notes\n|-\n| 2020\n| Commercial Break\n| Featuring Lucy Stoole and Dida Ritz\n|}\nSingles\nLead artist\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2018\n|\"Room pt. 1\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Room pt. 2\"\n|Featuring Shea Couleé\n|-\n|\"Tea Party\"\n|\n|}\nFeatured artist\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Artist\n|-\n|2017\n|\"Cocky\"\n|Shea Couleé (featuring Lila Star and The Vixen)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2018\n|\"Drag\"\n|Dorian Electra (featuring Imp Queen, Lucy Stoole, Eva Young, The Vixen and London Jade)\n|-\n|\"Demons, Witches & Bitches\"\n|Aja (featuring DJ Shilow and The Vixen)\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
