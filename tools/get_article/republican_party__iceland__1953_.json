A party with an identical name was officially granted list letter I on 8 March 2013, and started to compose a candidate list for participation in the 2013 Icelandic parliamentary election. It is, however, not the same party that participated in the 1953 election, although the name was chosen as a homage to the party.\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"100px\" | Election\n! width=\"70px\" | Votes\n! width=\"50px\" | Vote %\n! width=\"50px\" | Seats\n! width=\"50px\" | Place\n|-\n! 1953\n| 2,531\n| 3.3\n| 0\n| 6th\n|}\nReferences"
