It was the 17th Global Wars event and the tour spanned three dates, from September 6 through September 8, 2019. It made stops at the Ford Community & Performing Arts Center in Dearborn, Michigan on September 6, the Odeum Expo Center in Villa Park, Illinois on September 7, and the Potawatomi Hotel & Casino in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 8. The events were broadcast live on Honor Club and FITE TV.\nBackground\nProduction\nThe U.S. based Ring of Honor (ROH) and the Mexico based Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) Professional wrestling promotions started a working partnership in the mid-2010s, with ROH wrestlers travelling to Mexico to compete on CMLL shows and CMLL wrestlers working select shows in the U.S. for Ring of Honor. The two promotions have collaborated on supershow events over the year, such as the 2016 through 2019 International Gran Prix in Mexico, the Summer Supercard show in 2019, and the CMLL 85th Anniversary Show where ROH wrestler Matt Taven worked the main event.\nIn late July ROH announced that they had partnered with CMLL for a three day \"Global Wars Espectacular\" tour, as part of their annual Global Wars series of events. The three-stop tour would start on September 6, 2019 at the Ford Community Center in Dearborn, Michigan. The second stop, on September 7, will be at the Odeum Expo in Chicago and concluded at the Potawatomi Casino in Milwaukee on September 8. Several of the matches would feature ROH and CMLL wrestlers facing off, in additional to non-interpromotional matches.\nStorylines\nthe Global Wars Espectecular tour will feature professional wrestling matches, involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that played out on ROH's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed villains (referred to as rudos in Mexico) or heroes (tecnicos) as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nMatches\nGlobal Wars Espectacular: Dearborn\n|times=\n|match1=Dak Draper defeated The Haitian Sensation\n|stip1=Top Prospect Tournament Semifinal Singles match\n|match2=Silas Young and Josh Woods defeated The Bouncers (Brian Milonas and Beer City Bruiser)\n|stip2=Tag team match\n|match3=Rush defeated Tritón\n|stip3=Singles match\n|match4=Mark Haskins defeated Rhett Titus\n|stip4=Singles match\n|match5=Kenny King defeated Jeff Cobb and Tracy Williams\n|stip5=Triple Threat match\n|match6=Dalton Castle and Joe Hendry defeated Jay Lethal and Jonathan Gresham\n|stip6=Tag team match\n|match7=Villain Enterprises (Marty Scurll, Flip Gordon, PCO, and Brody King) defeated Team CMLL (Rey Bucanero, Okumura, Hechicero, and Bárbaro Cavernario)\n|stip7=Six-man tag team match\n|match8=Volador Jr. and Stuka Jr. defeated The Kingdom (Matt Taven and Vinny Marseglia)\n|stip8=Tag team match\n|match9=Bandido defeated Jay Briscoe\n|stip9=Singles match\n}}\nGlobal Wars Espectacular: Villa Park\n|note1=dark\n|match2=Austin Gunn defeated Dante Caballero\n|stip2=Singles match\n|match3=Silas Young and Josh Woods defeated P.
