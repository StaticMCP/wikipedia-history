The campus is on 32 acres, formerly Idlewild Country Club. It is an extension of Queen's Grant Community School, an NHA charter that offers grades K-8.\nHistory\nQueen's Grant was formed in 2006, and opened in 2007 with ninth and tenth grades. The school rented space until 2009, when it first assembled modular units to accommodate over 400 students.\nIn 2010, Queen's Grant appointed Principal Michael Smith, who was recruited by former Mint Hill, North Carolina Mayor Ted Biggers. Smith retired and was replaced by Josh Swartzlander in 2019.\nAcademics\nAt Queen's Grant, the academic day begins at 7:50&nbsp;a.m. and ends at 2:40&nbsp;p.m.. A standard schedule consists of six class periods called \"blocks\". Each block lasts exactly one hour.\nNon-AP classes at Queen's Grant do not follow the same curriculum as Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, however, material is often similar in order to meet North Carolina's education standards. Each student must have a minimum of 22 credits in order to graduate.\nDual enrollment is offered by Queen's Grant through Central Piedmont Community College. Only juniors and seniors are allowed to participate in dual enrollment. All students, regardless of grade, are allowed to take North Carolina Virtual Public School classes on-site.\nStudent life\nTransportation\nStudents provide their own transportation to and from Queen's Grant. If students bring their own vehicles, parking on campus is free. Most trips and extracurricular activities also involve individual transportation.\nLearning\nThe school day lasts just under seven hours for most students. Queen's Grant utilizes multiple online platforms for work and grade management, including Schoology and PowerSchool. Students are provided with Google Workspace accounts.\nLunch\nQueen's Grant offers catered lunch Monday through Friday. Regularly sold are Chick-Fil-A sandwiches and Harris Teeter sub sandwiches, accompanied by chips and drinks.

It also features a half-mile cross country trail and a small volleyball area. All other athletic practices, games, and events are held off-site at various local facilities.\nBuilding campaign\nIn 2019, Queen's Grant announced plans to construct a building to be used as a student performance center and gymnasium. The school hopes to raise $5 million for the project.\nDuring Summer 2022, Principal Josh Swartzlander announced plans via email to \"embark on the construction of our new GYMPAC\" in the fall.\nSchool fundraising\nQueen's Grant utilizes a variety of fundraising methods. The school's student government also organizes events which generate revenue.\n* Spirit wear is sold via the school's Square site. Students can wear purchased items at any time throughout the year. Proceeds go towards technology improvements, campus maintenance, and more.\n* Engraved bricks are sold, and will be added to the school's performing arts center/gymnasium upon the building's completion. Proceeds go directly towards the construction of the building.\n* Jeans Days are held every Wednesday and Friday, with most proceeds benefiting school clubs. The cost is $1 to participate. Year-long jeans passes are also available for $100.\n* The sale of Chick-Fil-A Sandwiches during school lunch often raises additional funds; these proceeds go towards Student Council events.\nRules\nDress Code\nQueen's Grant does not currently have school uniforms.
