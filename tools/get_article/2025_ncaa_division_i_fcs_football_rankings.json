Unlike the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), college football's governing body, the NCAA, bestows the national championship title through a 24-team tournament. The following weekly polls determine the top 25 teams at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level of college football for the 2025 season. The STATS poll is voted on by media members while the Coaches' Poll is determined by coaches at the FCS level.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|+ Legend\n|-\n| style=\"background:#bbffbb; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffbbbb; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| Selected for NCAA FCS Playoffs\n|-\n| (Italics)\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n| (#–#)\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| т\n| &nbsp;\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nSTATS poll\n|Week2Date = September 1\n|Week3Date = September 8\n|Week4Date = September 15\n|Week5Date = September 22\n|Week6Date = September 29\n|Week7Date = October 6\n|Week8Date = October 13\n|Week9Date = October 20\n|Week10Date= October 27\n|Week11Date= November 3\n|Week12Date= November 10\n|Week13Date= November 17\n|Week14Date=\n|Week15Date=\n|Week1-1   = North Dakota State (54)\n|Week1-2   = Montana State (1)\n|Week1-3   = South Dakota State\n|Week1-4   = South Dakota (1)\n|Week1-5   = Incarnate Word\n|Week1-6   = Illinois State\n|Week1-7   = Montana\n|Week1-8   = UC Davis\n|Week1-9   = Rhode Island\n|Week1-10  = Tarleton State\n|Week1-11  = Mercer\n|Week1-12  = Idaho\n|Week1-13  = Villanova\n|Week1-14  = Lehigh\n|Week1-15  = Sacramento State\n|Week1-16  = Abilene Christian\n|Week1-17  = Jackson State\n|Week1-18  = Western Carolina\n|Week1-19  = Northern Arizona\n|Week1-20  = Southern Illinois\n|Week1-21  = Tennessee Tech\n|Week1-22  = Monmouth\n|Week1-23  = Stephen F.
