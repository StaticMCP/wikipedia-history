      "text": "# The American Revolution; Written in the Style of Ancient History\n\nThe American Revolution; Written in the Style of Ancient History is a 1793 account of the American Revolution written by Richard Snowden (1753–1825). An example of \"pseudo-biblicism\", it imitates the language of the King James Version of the Bible.\nOverview\nDespite adopting a biblical style, the work is relatively devoid of religious material, like most pseudo-biblical works. The work was aimed at schoolchildren, with Snowden writing that the style was chosen as the style \"most suitable to the capacities of young people\". The work was published with verse numbers and uses English of the Jacobean Era, similar to that found in the King James Version of the Bible published in 1611.\nIn the work, modern place names are replaced with archaic-sounding names, e.g. France is called Gaul.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* Read The American Revolution (1802 reprint) at the Internet Archive"
