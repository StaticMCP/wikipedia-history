In 2008, his senior year, King was named to the All-Hillsborough County team.\nFrom 2008 to 2011, King played as a forward for the Florida Atlantic Owls. King was the Owls' leading scorer during his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons.\nKing participated in the 2012 NASL Combine where he was noticed by Fort Lauderdale Strikers' coaching staff. He was invited to preseason with the Strikers, where he impressed enough to earn his first professional contract. On March 27, 2012, the Strikers announced that King had signed professional terms with the club.\nKing made his professional debut with the Strikers as a second-half sub against FC Edmonton on April 7, 2012, in the first game of the 2012 NASL season. He played 15 minutes after replacing Leopoldo Morales in the 75th minute. On July 2, King started and played 90 minutes in an unfamiliar right back position, and took the throw-in that lead to the opening goal. He started at right back in the Strikers' next match against the Carolina RailHawks, and scored his first goal as a professional in the 31st minute of the 3–3 draw. King ended up primarily playing right back for the Strikers and was named to the 2014 NASL Best XI as a defender.\nOn December 22, 2014, King returned to Tampa Bay by signing with the NASL's Tampa Bay Rowdies\nOn February 6, 2018, King made the move to United Soccer League side San Antonio FC. King earned a spot on the All-League team at the end of 2018.\nKing signed with Nashville SC on December 4, 2018, rejoining former Rowdies teammate Matt Pickens. He then signed with Phoenix Rising FC on December 18, 2019.\nFollowing a 2023 USL Championship season that saw Phoenix win the league, King announced his retirement on January 4, 2024. He transitioned to a coaching role with Phoenix Rising.\nAhead of Phoenix Rising’s week 4 clash of the 2025 USL Championship season against Monterey Bay, nine players were out with injuries. King was called up to the squad, as he would then come off the bench in the 69th minute after Phoenix were down to nine men. The match ended in a 3-1 loss for Phoenix.\nCareer statistics\nStatistics accurate as of December 4, 2018\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"3\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"3\"|Playoffs\n!colspan=\"3\"|Total\n|-\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Assists\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Assists\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Assists\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Assists\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Fort Lauderdale Strikers\n|2012\n|22||1||2||1||0||0||1||0||0||24||1||2\n|-\n|2013\n|26||3||1||2||0||1||—||—||—||28||3||2\n|-\n|2014\n|21||2||4||1||0||0||—||—||—||22||2||4\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Tampa Bay Rowdies\n|2015\n|27||1||2||1||0||0||—||—||—||28||1||2\n|-\n|2016\n|30||0||2||2||0||0||—||—||—||32||0||2\n|-\n|2017\n|24||0||1||1||0||0||2||0||0||27||0||1\n|-\n|San Antonio FC\n|2018\n|32||2||5||3||1||0||—||—||—||35||3||5\n|-\n|Nashville SC\n|2019\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||—||—||—||0||0||0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Career total\n!182!!9!!17!!11!!1!!1!!3!!0!!0!!196!!10!!18\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150108195034/http://www.rowdiessoccer.com/team/roster/player/uuid/zfa3dgzt4r2l1xpmluz3nv1xd/darnell-king Tampa Bay Rowdies bio]"
