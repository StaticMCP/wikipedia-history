A sequel to the 1992 classic Living in Bondage, the film stars  Kenneth Okonkwo, Kanayo O. Kanayo, Enyinna Nwigwe, and Muna Abii, with Swanky JKA in his breakout role, and Ramsey Nouah, who makes his directorial debut, playing the main villain. It received mostly positive reviews and ranked 11th overall on the list of highest-grossing Nigerian films of all time at the end of its theatrical run. The film premiered on Netflix in May 2020.\nPlot\nTwenty-five years after the events of the original movie, Andy Okeke is now an ordained Man-of-God, having renounced his allegiance to the secret cult now known as the Brotherhood of the Six. The sect has expanded into an international organisation, with most Nigerian members who survived the 1996 Otokoto riots fleeing the country apart from Chief Omego – now an Imo state governorship aspirant – and fellow ritualist Mike Ekejimbe. The film opens with Omego's son Obinna murdering his young daughter Kosi in a forest as part of a money-making ritual, and in a nod to the original story, her spirit torments her father throughout the movie, leading to his sudden insanity and eventual suicide.\nNnamdi Okeke – Andy's secret son by his late second wife, Ego – has been raised by maternal relatives Pascal Nworie and his wife, Eunice, and shares a close bond with their son, Toby. Highly ambitious but largely unlucky, Nnamdi is unable to maintain a stable career as an advertising executive five years after graduation. Despite the disapproval of his uncle, who is aware of Omego's occult background, Nnamdi, who yearns for a luxurious lifestyle by any means possible, becomes acquainted with Omego's wife, Nneka, and her son, Obinna, who both offer to help him establish connections within the advertising industry.\nDuring an office presentation where Nnamdi pitches his ad campaign for an upcoming rail network, billionaire tycoon Richard Williams is impressed by his ingenuity. He mentors Nnamdi professionally, and the latter is catapulted into high society status, acquiring vast wealth and recognition, but his new life comes at a price. Unbeknownst to Nnamdi, Richard is the new leader of The Six on a mission to lure him into their cult, and due to Andy's past, the Okeke lineage is eternally bound to the dark side.\nInvestigative journalist and blogger Uzoma grows suspicious of notable billionaires associated with mysterious murders, particularly after his sister and her daughter Kosi die in mysterious circumstances, and pays Andy a visit in search of answers. Having experienced cultism himself, Andy unsuccessfully tries to warn his son after Uzoma informs him of Nnamdi's existence to save him from The Six before time runs out. Richard eventually initiates Nnamdi, but fails to persuade Andy back into the fold. Nnamdi later regrets joining The Six, especially after falling for Kelly, whom he meets at Obinna's wedding when the latter remarries seven months after his wife's death. Richard and Omego have commanded him to present her as a sacrifice, and Nnamdi is torn between appeasing the cult and sparing Kelly's life.\nToby visits the depressed Nnamdi to get to the bottom of the latter's melancholy demeanour and passes the night at his place, but Richard possesses Nnamdi, commanding him to stab his sleeping cousin instead of Kelly. Unable to resist, Nnamdi resorts to stabbing himself instead and is rushed to the hospital, where he survives and reconciles with his biological father Andy, whom he had previously rejected. Members of The Six are arrested after a recording Obinna sent Uzoma before his suicide is used as evidence. However, Richard is able to escape, and is seen on his private jet before the ending credits roll.\nCast\n* Ramsey Nouah as Richard Williams\n* Jidekene Achufusi as Nnamdi Nworie\n* Kenneth Okonkwo as Andy Okeke\n* Enyinna Nwigwe as Obinna Omego\n* Munachi Abii as Kelly Nwankwo\n* Shawn Faqua as Toby Nworie\n* David Jones as Uzoma Adibe\n* Ebele Okaro as Eunice Nworie\n* Zulu Adigwe as Pascal Nworie\n* Kanayo O.
