Of those, 22 were excluded by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith between 28 October 2008 and 31 March 2009. On 5 May 2009 Smith publicly \"named and shamed\" sixteen of those individuals. In addition to the sixteen, other people are or have been banned from the United Kingdom.\nThe individuals are not necessarily banned from the British overseas territories, which have their own immigration regulations.\nSmith's successor as Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, ended the policy of naming people who are banned from entering Britain.\nHome Office 2023 list of hate promoters\nThe following 16 names were published:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=260|Individual\n! width=200|Nationality\n! width=260|Occupation\n! width=350|Official reason for ban\n|-\n|Abdullah Qadri Al Ahdal\n||\n|Muslim extremist preacher\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs and fostering hatred that might lead to inter-community violence\".\n|-\n|Yunis Al Astal\n||\n|Muslim cleric and Hamas member of the Palestinian parliament\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs and to provoke others to terrorist acts\".\n|-\n|Stephen Donald Black\n||\n|Extremist founder of the neo-Nazi website Stormfront\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by promoting serious criminal activity and fostering hatred, which might lead to inter-community violence in the United Kingdom\".\n|-\n|Wagdy Abd el-Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim\n||\n|Preacher, writer\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to foment, justify or glory terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs and to provoke others to commit terrorist acts\".\n|-\n|Erich Gliebe\n||\n|Neo-Nazi, far-right political leader\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by justifying terrorist violence, provoking others to commit serious crime and fostering racial hatred\".\n|-\n|Mike Guzovsky\n||\n|Jewish militant\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs and to provoke others to terrorist acts\".\n|-\n|Safwat Hijazi\n||\n|Imam, television preacher\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by glorifying terrorist violence\".\n|-\n|Nasr Javed\n||\n| Senior operative of the Kashmiri militant group Jammat Ud Dawa\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs\".\n|-\n|Abdul Alim Musa (deceased)\n||\n|Founder and director of the hate group As-Sabiqun\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by fomenting and glorifying terrorist violence in furtherance of his particular beliefs and seeking to provoke others to terrorist acts\".\n|-\n|Fred Phelps (deceased)\n||\n|Pastor and Founder of anti-LGBT group Westboro Baptist Church\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by fostering hatred such as homophobia, transphobia and biphobia, which might lead to inter-community violence in the United Kingdom\".\n|-\n|Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky\n||\n|Violent gang leaders and mass murderers\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by fomenting serious criminal activity and seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts\".\n|-\n|Amir Siddique\n||\n|Imam, preacher\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by fomenting terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs\".\n|-\n|Michael Savage\n||\n|Right-wing radio host\n|\"Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\".\n|-\n|}\nOther notable individuals banned or refused entry\nThe following individuals are temporarily or permanently refused entry into the United Kingdom.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=290|Individual\n! width=210|Nationality\n! width=300|Occupation\n! width=300|Reason banned\n|-\n|Asma al-Assad\n||\n|Former First Lady of Syria (2000-2024)\n|Allegations involving the \"systematic approach to the torture and murder of civilians, including with the use of chemical weapons\" and incitement of terrorist acts.\n|-\n|Siccatune Alcock(aka Jah Cure)\n||\n|Reggae musician\n|Criminal convictions in Jamaica.\n|-\n|Zokirjon Almatov\n||\n|Politician\n|War crimes committed in Uzbekistan.\n|-\n|Steven L.
