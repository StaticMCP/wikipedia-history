When Louis William learned that there were no Ottoman defensive positions on Vinik, he ordered Pavle Nestorović to attack it. Nestorović managed to bypass the right flank of the Ottoman forces and win the battle. For this achievement, Nestorović was promoted to the rank of lieutenant.\nAfter the battle Louis left Lieutenant-General Piccolomini in charge of the sanjak of Niš and marched to Vidin, where he attacked the Ottoman garrison on 14 October and received its capitulation on 19 October. Piccolomini led a campaign deep into Macedonia. The Ottomans retook Niš the following September after the Austrians abandoned the city.\nSee also\n*Fire of Skopje 1689\n*Karposh's Rebellion\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
