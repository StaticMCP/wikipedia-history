We can also see at the entrance an explanatory sign showing the movements of the ships during the Naval Battle.\nThis statue stands atop a small rocky summit, from where tourists are able to gaze the entire coast of Iquique, including the Buoy “Esmeralda”.\nIt is located opposite the buoy that indicates where the sunken remains of Corvette Esmeralda are located, which was defeated during the Naval Battle of Iquique in 1879.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.monumentos.gob.cl/monumentos/monumentos-publicos/marinero AL MARINERO] in Consejo de Monumentos Nacionales"
