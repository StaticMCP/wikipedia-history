The Democratic-Republican candidate James Madison defeated Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney decisively.\nMadison had served as Secretary of State since President Thomas Jefferson took office in 1801. Jefferson, who had declined to run for a third term, threw his strong support behind Madison, a fellow Virginian. Sitting Vice President George Clinton and former Ambassador James Monroe both challenged Madison for leadership of the party, but Madison won his party's nomination and Clinton was renominated as vice president. The Federalists chose to re-nominate Pinckney, a former ambassador who had served as the party's 1804 nominee, again alongside Rufus King.\nDespite the unpopularity of the Embargo Act of 1807, Madison won the vast majority of electoral votes outside of the Federalist stronghold of New England. Clinton received six electoral votes for president from his home state of New York. This election was the first of two instances in American history in which a new president was selected but the incumbent vice president won re-election, the other being in 1828.\nNominations\nDemocratic-Republican Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|1808 Democratic-Republican Party Ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#90EE90; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#90EE90; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| 5thU.S. Secretary of State(1801–1809)\n| 4thVice President of the United States(1805–1812)\n|-\n|}\n, the incumbent president in 1808, whose second term expired on March 4, 1809]]\nPresidential candidates\n* James Madison (Virginia), Secretary of State\n* James Monroe (Virginia), Former U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain\n* George Clinton (New York), Vice President of the United States\nFile:James_Madison_by_Gilbert_Stuart_(3).jpg|Secretary of State  James Madison  from Virginia\nFile:James Monroe White House portrait 1819.jpg|Former U.S. Ambassador  James Monroe  from Virginia\nFile:George Clinton by Ezra Ames.jpg|Vice President  George Clinton  from New York\nVice-presidential candidates\n* George Clinton (New York), Vice President of the United States\n* John Langdon (New Hampshire), Governor\n* Henry Dearborn (Massachusetts), Secretary of War\n* John Quincy Adams (Massachusetts), United States Senator\nFile:George Clinton by Ezra Ames.jpg|Vice President  George Clinton  from New York\nFile:John langdon.jpg|Governor  John Langdon  from New Hampshire\nFile:Gilbert Stuart - Major-General Henry Dearborn - 1913.793 - Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|Secretary of War  Henry Dearborn  from Massachusetts\nFile:Gilbert Stuart - John Quincy Adams - Google Art Project.jpg|Senator  John Quincy Adamsfrom Massachusetts\nCaucus\nSenator Stephen R. Bradley, who had chaired the congressional nominating caucus during the 1804 presidential election, made a call for the 1808 caucus to the 146 Democratic-Republican members of the United States Congress and Federalist allies. The caucus was attended by 89 to 94 members of Congress.\nThe caucus was held in January 1808. With the support of outgoing President Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State James Madison won the presidential nomination over opposing candidates James Monroe and Vice President George Clinton. The caucus voted to give the vice presidential nomination to Clinton over his main opponent John Langdon, although Clinton's supporters believed Clinton would receive the Federalist Party's presidential nomination. The Federalists instead nominated Charles Cotesworth Pinckney that September. A committee of fifteen members was selected to manage Madison's campaign.\nSeventeen Democratic-Republicans in Congress opposed Madison's selection and the caucus system whose authority to select presidential and vice-presidential candidates was disputed. Clinton also opposed the caucus system. Monroe, who was supported by dissident and majority leader John Randolph, was nominated by a group of Virginia Democratic-Republicans (Old Republicans), and although he did not actively try to defeat Madison, he also refused to withdraw from the race. Clinton was also supported by a group of New York Democratic-Republicans for president even as he remained the party's official vice presidential candidate.\nBalloting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Presidential Ballot\n!Total\n!Vice Presidential Ballot\n!Total\n|-\n|James Madison\n|align=\"right\"|83\n|George Clinton\n|align=\"right\"|79\n|-\n|James Monroe\n|align=\"right\"|3\n|John Langdon\n|align=\"right\"|5\n|-\n|George Clinton\n|align=\"right\"|3\n|Henry Dearborn\n|align=\"right\"|3\n|-\n|\n|\n|John Quincy Adams\n|align=\"right\"|1\n|}\nFederalist Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|1808 Federalist Party Ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#FFDAB9; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#FFDAB9; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| 6th U.S. Ministerto France(1796–1797)\n| 3rd U.S. Ministerto Great Britain(1796–1803)\n|-\n|}\nThe Federalist caucus met in September 1808 and re-nominated the party's 1804 ticket, which consisted of General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina and former Senator Rufus King of New York. This was the only time in American history that a defeated major party renominated its losing ticket for a second time.\nGeneral election\nCampaign\nThe election was marked by opposition to Jefferson's Embargo Act of 1807, a halt to trade with Europe that disproportionately hurt New England merchants and was perceived as favoring France over Britain. Nonetheless, Jefferson was still very popular with Americans generally and Pinckney was soundly defeated by Madison, though not as badly as in 1804. Pinckney received few electoral votes outside of New England.\nResults\nPinckney retained the electoral votes of the two states that he carried in 1804 (Connecticut and Delaware), and he also picked up New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and three electoral districts in North Carolina besides the two electoral districts in Maryland that he carried earlier. Except for the North Carolina districts, all of the improvement was in New England.\nMonroe won a portion of the popular vote in Virginia and North Carolina, while the New York legislature split its electoral votes between Madison and Clinton.\nSource (Popular Vote): A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825\nSource (Electoral Vote):\n(a) Only 10 of the 17 states chose electors by popular vote.\n(b) Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.\n(c) One Elector from Kentucky did not vote.\nElectoral votes by state\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| State\n!rowspan=2 style=\"font-size: 60%\"| Electoralvotes\n!colspan=4| For President\n!colspan=6| For Vice President\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n!
