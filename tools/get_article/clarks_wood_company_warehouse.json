It is known to have been used early in its history as a railhead warehouse for William Butler's tar works at nearby Crew's Hole, and later became part of St Vincent's Works.\nIt is an example of the Bristol Byzantine style of architecture, and has been listed by English Heritage as a grade II listed building.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Clarks wood company warehouse\n\n#REDIRECT Clarks Wood Company warehouse"
