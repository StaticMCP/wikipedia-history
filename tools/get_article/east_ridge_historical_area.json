These buildings were originally located adjacent to the campus orchard where the Central Residential Area currently stands today. The district consists mainly of lecture halls that were built prior to the First World War by the Massachusetts Agricultural College; however, it is also home to the Boltwood-Stockbridge House, the oldest house in Amherst.\nHistoric buildings\n* Apiary Laboratory\n* Boltwood-Stockbridge House\n* Clark Hall\n* Fernald Hall\n* French Hall\n** French Hall Greenhouse\n* Homestead House\n* Wilder Hall\nOther buildings\n* Durfee Conservatory\n* Franklin Dining Commons\n* Hills Hall\n* Morrill Science Center\n* Studio Arts Building\nFormer buildings\n* Fisher Laboratory\n* Insectary\n* Marshall Hall\n** Marshall Hall Annex\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070824064732if_/http://www.umass.edu/fp/Legacy%20Buildings%20Report.pdf 2007 Legacy Buildings Report]"
