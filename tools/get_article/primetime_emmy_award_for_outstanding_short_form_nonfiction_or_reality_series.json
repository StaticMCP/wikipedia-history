The awards replaced the now-retired category for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program. These awards are not presented at the Primetime Emmy Awards show, but at the Creative Arts Emmy Award show.\nWinners and nominations\n2010s\nOutstanding Special Class — Short-Format Nonfiction Programs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"35%\" | Program\n! width=\"55%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n|-\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2011(63rd)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| ''Jay Leno's Garage\n| Jay Leno, Helga Pollock and Robert Angelo, producers\n| jaylenos garage.com\n|-\n| Writer's Draft\n| Brian Katkin, executive producer; Raphael Kryszek, producer\n| Fox Movie Channel\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2012(64th)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| DGA: Moments in Time\n| Michael Stevens, producer\n| dga.org\n|-\n| Bravo's Top Chef: Last Chance Kitchen\n| David Serwatka, Dan Cutforth, Jane Lipsitz, Lisa Hsia and Aimee Viles, produced by\n| BravoTV.com\n|-\n| Jay Leno's Garage\n| Jay Leno, executive producer; Helga Pollock and Robert Angelo, producers\n| jaylenos garage.com\n|-\n| Thank a Vet\n| Kathleen Williams, executive producer; Jaimie DeFina, senior producer; Andrea Allen, Glenn Schubert and Eric Berger, producers\n| History\n|-\n| 30 Rock: Ask Tina\n| Tina Fey, Eric Gurian, Nick Bernardone, Clint Koltveit and William Sell, producers\n| NBC.com\n|-\n| rowspan=7 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2013(65th)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Remembering 9/11\n| Kathleen Williams, executive producer; Sean Kennedy, producer\n| History.com\n|-\n| Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\n| Jerry Seinfeld, producer\n| Crackle.com\n|-\n| Jay Leno's Garage\n| Jay Leno, Helga Pollock, Robert Angelo, Kico Velarde, Robert Hayes and David Swift, producers\n| jaylenos garage.com\n|-\n| The Office: The Farewells\n| John Krasinski, Carole Angelo and Daniel Stessen, producers\n| rowspan=2|NBC.com\n|-\n| 30 Rock: The Final Season\n| Tina Fey, Eric Gurian, Nick Bernardone, Clint Koltveit, William Sell and Carole Angelo, producers\n|-\n| Top Chef: Last Chance Kitchen\n| David Serwatka, Ashley Kaplan, Dan Cutforth, Jane Lipsitz, Lisa Hsia and Aimee Viles, produced by\n| BravoTV.com\n|-\n| rowspan=7 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2014(66th)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| 30 for 30 Shorts\n| Connor Schell, John Dahl, Bill Simmons and Maura Mandt, executive producers; Dan Silver and Tate Donovan, producers\n| ESPN\n|-\n| Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\n| Jerry Seinfeld, executive producer\n| Crackle.com\n|-\n| Cosmos: A National Geographic Deeper Dive\n| Allan Butler, executive producer; Christina Ricchiuti, producer\n| Nat Geo\n|-\n| I Was There: Boston Marathon Bombings\n| Kathleen Williams and Sean Kennedy, executive producers; Jaimie DeFina, senior producer\n| History.com\n|-\n| Jay Leno's Garage\n| Jay Leno, executive producer; Kico Velarde, supervising producer; Helga Pollock, Robert Hayes, David Swift and Walker Dalton, producers\n| NBC.com\n|-\n| Park Bench with Steve Buscemi\n| Steve Buscemi, Stanley Tucci, Wren Arthur, Justin Wilkes, Joe Killian and Jon Doran, executive producers\n| AOL\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2015(67th)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| A Tribute to Mel Brooks\n| Brian Katkin, Chuck Saftler, Adam Lewinson, Maureen Timpa and Raphael Kryszek, executive producers; Tava Smiley, host\n| FX\n|-\n| American Horror Story: Extra-Ordinary Artists\n| Ryan Murphy, Stephanie Gibbons, Sally Daws, Sue Keeton, Jason Miller and Ned Martel, producers\n| FX\n|-\n| Parks and Recreation: Behind the Final Season\n| Morgan Sackett, Dean Holland, Tom Ragazzo, Michael Maccarone and Greg Levine, producers\n| NBC.com\n|-\n| 30 for 30 Shorts\n| Connor Schell, John Dahl and Bill Simmons, executive producers; Dan Silver, senior producer; Sean Stuart, produced by\n| ESPN\n|-\n| This Is Me\n| Jill Soloway, Andrea Sperling and Rebecca Odes, executive producers; Xan Aranda, co-executive producer/produced by; Rhys Ernst and Zackary Drucker, supervising producers\n| EW.com\n|-\n|}\nOutstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"35%\" | Program\n! width=\"55%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2016(68th)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Inside Look: The People v.
