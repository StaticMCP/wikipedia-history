He appears in two key Rattanakosin period texts: the Elephant Treatise (Tamra Chang) and the Twenty Incarnations of Narayana (Khamphi Narai Yisip Pang).\nAlthough he resembles Ganesha, Phra Konchananeshvar is worshipped in Thailand as the teacher of elephant doctors in the traditional science of elephant care (kachasat).\nNotably, this figure does not appear in any Hindu scriptures from India.\nIn the Ramakien, Phra Phinai incarnates as Niluek, one of the Eighteen Monkey Generals (wanor sip paet mongkut) of Chomphu city, and is credited as the first monkey to discover Phra Phiphek.\nEtymology\nPhraya Anuman Rajadhon proposed that the name \"Konchananeshvar,\" as found in the Twenty Incarnations of Narayana, refers to Phra Khanda Kumar (Kartikeya). He linked the word \"Konchana\" to the Sanskrit Krauncha, the name of the mountain where Kartikeya resided.\nAssociate Professor Dr. Maneepin Phromsuthirak offers a related interpretation, deriving the name from the Sanskrit compound Kraunchanān-īśvara, meaning \"Lord of Krauncha\".\nManeepin further suggests that ancient Siamese were aware from Indian mythology that Phra Isuan had two sons, but may have confused the two figures, transferring Kartikeya’s name to Ganesha. Khomkrit Uitekkeng, however, interprets \"Konchanatneshvar\" from the Elephant Treatise as coming from Konchanat, meaning \"the cry of the elephant,\" which would render the name as \"Lord with the cry of the elephant.\" He also notes a possible derivation from a Tamil-influenced Sanskrit compound, Konchanatn+īśvara.\nHistory\nAccording to the Twenty Incarnations of Narayana, Phra Konchananeshvar is described as a son of Phra Isuan and younger brother of Phra Phikhanet:\n“In the third age (Tretā Yuga), Phra Isuan commanded Phra Phloeng to exercise divine power to create two sons. Phra Phloeng obeyed, causing flames to issue from both ears of Shiva. From the right ear emerged a son with an elephant face—Phra Phikhanet (Ganesha). From the left ear emerged a divine prince named Phra Konchananeshvar, with three elephant heads and six arms, each hand bearing different types of elephants—such as Airavata, the Trida Yuga cloud elephant, the foremost white elephant, the second white elephant, and others.”\nBoth the Twenty Incarnations of Narayana and the Elephant Treatise describe him identically: he has three elephant heads and six arms, each holding celestial or earthly elephants (including Airavata and various classes of white elephants), a right-hand conch shell turning clockwise (dakshinavarta shankha), and a left-hand conch turning counterclockwise (uttaravarta shankha). He stands upon a seven-headed elephant and is credited with creating white elephants for earthly kings.\nWhile his iconography resembles the South Indian Trimukha Ganapati (three-faced Ganapati) described in the Tattvanidhi, Phra Konchananeshvar’s role is uniquely tied to elephants and the Thai tradition of elephantology.\nReferences"
