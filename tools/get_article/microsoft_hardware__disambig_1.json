Since then, Microsoft has developed computer hardware, gaming hardware and mobile hardware. It also produced drivers and other software for integrating the hardware with Microsoft Windows.\nIn April 2023, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue the production of most branded PC accessories, electing to focus solely on Microsoft Surface-branded products (which are aimed at a high-end market). In January 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Incase, under which it would license designs for a number of its existing hardware products (including its mice, keyboard, and webcam designs), and provide it with access to its existing supply chains. These products will be marketed under the Incase branding moving forward, but will carry a \"designed by Microsoft\" tagline.\nProducts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Microsoft Hardware and Accessories\n!
