It was originally scheduled to be held on May 7, 2023, at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, and be hosted by Drew Barrymore.\nDue to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began on May 2, 2023, Barrymore and most of the planned guests dropped out in solidarity. As a result, the traditional in-person awards ceremony did not take place, and was replaced by a broadcast-only presentation with no host.\nThe nominees were announced on April 5, 2023. The Last of Us won the most awards overall, with Stranger Things being the most-nominated overall, and Top Gun: Maverick being the second-most nominated overall, and most-nominated film.\nCeremony cancellation\nOriginally, MTV announced on March 15 that Drew Barrymore would host the 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards, which would have once again been held at the Barker Hangar. However, on May 2, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike. On May 4, it was announced that Barrymore had withdrawn from hosting in support of the strike and was agreed to return for the 2024 ceremony.\nOn May 5, it was reported that the ceremony's format was being revised after many of its booked guests and presenters also dropped out in solidarity. After the WGA announced its intent to picket Barker Hangar, MTV announced that the in-person ceremony had been cancelled. Executive producer Bruce Gillmer stated that MTV would be \"pivoting away from a live event that still enables us to produce a memorable night full of exclusive sneak peeks, irreverent categories our audience has come to expect and countless moments that will both surprise and delight as we honor the best of film and TV over the past year\".\nThe in-person awards presentation was replaced by a hostless virtual ceremony with pre-recorded acceptance speeches, which Variety compared to those employed during the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions on public gatherings (including, in particular, the Greatest of All Time special that replaced the cancelled 2020 edition). Jennifer Coolidge and Joseph Quinn used their acceptance speeches to make statements in support of the striking writers. The remainder of the telecast was filled by highlights from past editions of the ceremony, promos for other films and television series, and sketches featuring Barrymore that had been filmed prior to her withdrawal as host (including an opening sequence where she reprised her role of Josie Geller from Never Been Kissed, as well as spoofs of Barbie and Wednesday). The telecast underran its two-hour time slot by seven minutes.\nWinners and nominees\nDeadline Hollywood reported the full list of nominees on April 5, 2023.
