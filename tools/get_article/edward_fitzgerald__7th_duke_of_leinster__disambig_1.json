He served army during the First World War. In January 1915, he was made a temporary lieutenant in the 8th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding). He took part in the Gallipoli campaign.\nHe inherited the Dukedom in February 1922, upon the death of his eldest brother, Maurice FitzGerald, 6th Duke of Leinster, who never married and was confined to a mental institution at the time of his death.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1478374/The-Duke-of-Leinster.html]\nAn addicted gambler, Leinster enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle, including motor racing.  He had already signed away his possible reversionary rights to the family's ancestral seat, Carton House, near Maynooth in County Kildare, not expecting that he would inherit the property and the title. He chose to live in England and his estates remained in the possession of the beneficiary, Sir Harry Mallaby-Deeley, 1st Baronet, during the Duke's lifetime.\nIn 1936, Leinster testified at a bankruptcy hearing that he had travelled to the United States in 1928 in order to find an heiress to marry and that during his trip he \"entertained lavishly on borrowed money in efforts to find an American wife who would pay off his debts\". Two heiresses appeared to be interested but both eventually declined to become Duchess of Leinster.\nUnable to repay his debts, the duke spent the final years of his life living in a small bedsit in Pimlico. He died by suicide in 1976 by taking an overdose of pentobarbital.\nMarriages and issue\nThe Duke of Leinster married four times, his wives being:\nThe first wife was May Juanita Etheridge [http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&strucID=441527&imageID=1137638&parent_id=440942&word=&snum=&s=&notword=&d=&c=&f=&k=0&sScope=&sLevel=&sLabel=&sort=&total=76&num=60&imgs=20&pNum=&pos=68] (4 August 1892 – 11 February 1935), a chorus girl and actress on the London Stage nicknamed the \"Pink Pajama Girl\", whom he married, in London, on 12 June 1913. She was daughter of Jesse Edward Etheridge, a salesman, buried at Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, and son of a George Etheridge and wife ..., and his wife, the former Theresa Grace Harriett Ann Summerell. They separated in 1922, whereupon the duke paid his estranged wife approximately $50 a week, \"on condition that she live in retirement and make no effort to communicate with her son\". The duke sued the duchess for divorce in 1926, citing a George Frederick Newell as co-respondent. The couple finally divorced in 1930, with Stanley Williams, \"a young chef\", being named as co-respondent. After the end of her marriage, the duchess took the name May Murray by deed poll.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110516120044/http://www.fownc.org/newsletters/no52.shtml]. In 1935 she committed suicide by an overdose of sleeping draught. They had one son:\n*Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Duke of Leinster (27 May 1914 – 3 December 2004)\nThe second wife was (Agnes) Raffaelle Van Neck (14 December 1902 – 28 December 1993, London), an American socialite, who was the former wife of Clare Van Neck and the only child of Robert Davidson Kennedy and his first wife, the former May Nutting.[http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nutting/nutting.html] The Duke and Mrs Van Neck married in London on 1 December 1932; they divorced in 1946, after some years of living in Scotland, the duke saying, \"She said she could not live with black-faced sheep and lochs, and I saw a certain amount of truth in that\".\nThe third wife was Jessie Wessel, a former actress and music-hall performer, known professionally as Denise Orme (1884–1960). She was the maternal grandmother of Prince Aga Khan IV. Born Jessie Smither, daughter of a bartender named Alfred Smither, she had become a music-hall performer and then married and divorced firstly Danish diplomat Theodor William Wessel, and secondly The 3rd Baron Churston; Leinster became her third husband on 11 March 1946. By this marriage, the duke acquired seven stepchildren, including Joan Yarde-Buller, known at that time (1936–49) as Princess Taj-ud-dawlah, mother of Prince Aga Khan IV (born 1936).\nThe fourth wife was Vivien Irene Conner, a waitress (19 February 1920 &ndash; Brighton, Sussex, 1992), the former wife of George William Conner and a daughter of Thomas Felton. She and the duke married in 1965. By this marriage, the duke had a stepson, Tony Conner.\nThe duke had an illegitimate son with Yvonne Denison Percy Probyn, later known as Yvonne FitzGerald, the daughter of Colonel J. Percy Probyn: Adrian Dighton Desmond FitzGerald, born in 1952, who married twice. His first wife was Colleen Theresa Cross, whom he married in 1972 and divorced in 1975; from this relationship, they had a daughter, Kirsty FitzGerald, born in 1973, who is the wife of Andrew Keetch. Adrian's second wife was Linda Jane Harris Clark, whom he married in 1982 and divorced in 1992.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
