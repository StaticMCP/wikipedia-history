He served in the War of the Austrian Succession, and was made lieutenant-colonel of the 36th Regiment of Foot in 1747. He was promoted in July 1757, colonel of the 22nd Regiment of Foot, and next year was made brigadier general. He was at the Siege of Louisburg in 1758, and, after the surrender of the town, was left there as military governor.\nOn a voyage to Boston in December 1761, the ship put into Plymouth, Massachusetts harbor to seek shelter from contrary winds. On 10 December 1761, near Plymouth, Whitmore, going on deck at midnight, accidentally fell overboard and drowned. His body was taken up next morning near the Gurnet, and carried to Boston in the same vessel. He was buried on 16 December 1761 in the King's Chapel.\nReferences\nAttribution\n* This work in turn cites:\n** Richard Brown, History of the Island of Cape Breton (London, 1869)\n** Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe (Boston, 1885)\n** William H.
