Micheal Shea was succeeded by McFaul, Paramount and Loew then organized a corporate Shea, who didn't renew the lease in 1939 because it wasn't profitable. Nikitas Dipson leased it from 1939 to 1941 who also did not renew due to profitability. It wasn't until Dipson's successor had spent over $50,000 restoring it before it became profitable. It was demolished in the summer of 1980.\nReferences"
