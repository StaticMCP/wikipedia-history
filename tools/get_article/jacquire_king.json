King has worked with such notable artists as Zach Bryan, Kings of Leon, Tom Waits, James Bay, Kaleo, Modest Mouse, Shania Twain, Buddy Guy, Norah Jones, Of Monsters and Men, Cold War Kids, Punch Brothers, City and Colour, Robert Ellis, Dawes and others. His work has received more than 40 Grammy Award nominations to date.\nCareer\nKing had his initial training in recording engineering at Recording Workshop in Chillicothe, Ohio. His first studio employment was in the Washington, D.C. area. In 1988, he moved to California and got a job at Different Fur Studios in San Francisco. King later interned for Dan Alexander at Coast Recorders, which led to him helping two friends open Toast Studios, where he began working as an assistant. After hearing that Tom Waits was looking for a new engineer, King auditioned and was chosen to engineer Waits' critically-acclaimed 1999 album Mule Variations at Prairie Sun Recording Studios.\nKing utilizes traditional analog techniques and equipment such as tracking to 2\" analog tape, combined with modern technologies like computer-based recording via Pro Tools and software plug-ins that emulate classic outboard Universal Audio and Neve signal processing gear.\nIn 2007 Jacquire disassembled and modified his 40-channel Quad-Eight Coronado console, converting it into two identical 16-channel/32-input consoles, and in 2013, he established residency at Blackbird Studio G in Nashville, Tennessee, which served as his primary studio for the next 6 years.\nIn 2014 he hosted his first Mix With The Masters seminar at Studios La Fabrique in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. In 2019, he established his own studio, LBT, in Nashville.\n*The Features, Some Kind of Salvation (2009)\n*Norah Jones, The Fall (2009)\n*Landon Pigg, The Boy Who Never (2009)\n*Kings of Leon, Come Around Sundown (2010)\n*Lissie, Catching a Tiger (2010)\n*Amber Rubarth, A Common Case of Disappearing (2011)\n*Tim Finn, The View Is Worth the Climb (2011)\n*Cold War Kids, Mine Is Yours (2011)\n*Melissa Etheridge, 4th Street Feeling (2012)\n*Of Monsters and Men, My Head Is an Animal (2012)\n*Punch Brothers, ''Who's Feeling Young Now?
