The office was created by the communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1974 and has developed into its modern form after the Romanian Revolution and the adoption of the 1991 constitution. The current president is Nicușor Dan, who has been serving since 26 May 2025.\nList\n;Key regarding the political parties of affiliation:\n|Romanian Communist Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (PCR)\n|National Salvation Front|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (FSN)\n|Social Democratic Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (PSD)\n|Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (PNȚCD)\n|Democratic Liberal Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (PDL)\n|National Liberal Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (PNL)\nSocialist Republic of Romania (1965–1989)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name(Birth–Death)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Elected\n! colspan=\"3\" width=\"30%\" | Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"35%\" | Political Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ref.\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Time in office\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:; color:white\" | 1\n| rowspan=\"2\" |80px\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Nicolae Ceaușescu(1918–1989)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1974\n1980\n1985\n| 28 March 1974\n| 22 December 1989\n|15 years,\n249 days\n|Romanian Communist Party (PCR)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Despite his country's membership in the Warsaw Pact, Ceaușescu recognised the state of Israel, supported Romanian nationalism, and denounced the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

During his term as president, Constantinescu struggled with the slow implementation of the modernization and privatization process which was bogged down by excessive bureaucracy.\nNonetheless, the CDR coalition managed to secure three prime ministers who initiated liberalizing economic reforms under Constantinescu's presidency, although the overall progress was meagre.\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:; color:white\" | (2)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |80px\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ion Iliescu(1930–2025)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2000\n| 20 December 2000\n| 20 December 2004\n|4 years\n|Social Democratic Party (PSD)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Iliescu was elected to his third non-consecutive term in 2000.

During his first term, Romania joined in the European Union (EU). In spite of the harsh opposition of the left-leaning parties (especially the PSD and the PRM), he publicly condemned the former communist regime.\nHis second term was marked by a landslide victory of the opposition coalition, specifically the Social Liberal Union (USL), in both the local and the legislative elections of 2012, amidst heavy losses for the presidential party (i.e. the Democratic Liberal Party).\nInternationally, Băsescu aligned Romania closer to the United States, the European Union (EU), and NATO, maintaining a pro-Western foreign policy throughout both his terms. He was suspended twice, namely in 2007 and 2012. Both impeachment referendums were invalidated by the Constitutional Court on the grounds of low turnout, thus paving his way for a comeback to presidency.\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n! rowspan=3 style=\"background:; color:black\" | 5\n|rowspan=3|\n|rowspan=3|Klaus Iohannis(born 1959)\n|rowspan=2|2014 2019\n| 21 December 2014\n| 12 February 2025\n|\n|National Liberal Party (PNL)\n|rowspan=3|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"|Elected with the support of the right-leaning Christian Liberal Alliance (ACL), Iohannis won against former USL ally and coalition partner Victor Ponta in the run-off of the 2014 Romanian presidential elections. During the presidential campaign, his platform focused on anti-corruption, judicial independence, and fiscal relaxation. He is also the first Romanian President to have stemmed from an ethnic minority, as he is of German (more specifically Transylvanian Saxon) origin.\nIn the wake of the 2016 legislative elections, his first presidential term was marked by the frequent change of prime ministers made by his former and current close allies, the social democrats, as well as by the most massive and widespread series of protests to have ever occurred in the history of Romania (which were directed against the political corruption supposedly endorsed by the social democratic governments).\nAfter defeating PSD candidate Viorica Dăncilă by a landslide in both presidential election rounds during late 2019, his second term has been marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and by further political instability (resulting in the 2021 Romanian political crisis) and democratic backsliding. In 2023, under his second last year of presidency, Iohannis faced a general strike of the Romanian teachers.\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"|2024\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"|After far-right candidate Călin Georgescu took a shock lead in the first round of the 2024 presidential election, the Constitutional Court of Romania annulled the results and cancelled the second round over allegations of Russian covert interference and illegal campaign spending by Georgescu. Though Iohannis's second term was due to expire in late December 2024, the Constitutional Court permitted him to stay in office until the inauguration of a successor.  However, Iohannis resigned on 12 February 2025 after opposition parties proposed an impeachment vote.\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:; \" | 6\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Nicușor Dan(born 1969)\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2025\n|26 May 2025\n|Incumbent\n|\n|Independent (Independent)3\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|}\nNotes:\n1 Emil Constantinescu was the candidate of the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNȚCD) whose candidacy was supported as part of the larger right-leaning Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) in both 1992 and 1996;\n2 Traian Băsescu was the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party (PD) whose candidacy was supported as part of the larger right-leaning Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) in 2004, alongside the National Liberal Party.
