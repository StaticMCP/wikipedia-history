As no candidate received more than half of the vote, a second round was held on 29 January between the two highest placed candidates from the first round, Tarja Halonen and Sauli Niinistö. Tarja Halonen, the incumbent, won the final round by 3.6 percentage points. The newly elected president formally took office for her second term on 1 March, and would have done so on 1 February, had no run-off been necessary (Constitution 55 §).\nAdvance voting is possible in Finnish elections, and the dates for this in the first round were the 4th, 5th and 7th to 10 January. Finnish citizens voting abroad could vote from the 4th to the 7th of January. An advantage to advance voting is that those doing so have a wider choice of polling stations (typically post offices, such as the one shown [https://web.archive.org/web/20060131170226/http://192.49.229.35/TP2006K1/e/aanpkat/kuntalista.htm here]), whereas on the actual election day the polling stations are fixed, usually schools, libraries or town halls.\nCandidates\nThe candidates are listed below following their candidate numbers. This list was confirmed by the Electoral District Committee of Helsinki on 15 December 2005.\n# (See below)\n# Bjarne Kallis (Christian Democrats)\n# Sauli Niinistö (National Coalition Party)\n# Timo Soini (True Finns)\n# Heidi Hautala (Green League)\n# Henrik Lax (Swedish People's Party)\n# Matti Vanhanen (Centre Party); the incumbent Prime Minister of Finland,\n# Arto Lahti (independent)\n# Tarja Halonen (Social Democratic Party; also supported by the Left Alliance); the current incumbent\nThe law states that candidate numbers start from the number 2. There are various justifications for this, such as preventing any candidate from using the slogan \"number 1\" for publicity, preventing ambiguity between the numbers 1 and 7, or preventing votes from being accidentally discounted because of a resemblance to a tickmark.\nFile:Tarja Halonen 2003.jpg|Tarja Halonen candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, winner of 1st round with 46.3% of votes\nFile:Sauli Ninisto (cropped).jpg|Sauli Niinistö candidate of the National Coalition Party, finished 2nd on 1st round with 24.1% of the votes\nFile:Matti Vanhanen 2008.jpg|Matti Vanhanen candidate of the Centre Party, finished 3rd on 1st round with 18.6% of the votes\nFile:Heidihautala.jpg|Heidi Hautala candidate of the Green League, finished 4th on 1st round with 3.5% of the votes\nCampaign\nThemes\nThe main theme of discussion in the campaign preceding the election was the President's powers and whether they should be limited further. The Green League's candidate Heidi Hautala suggested that the President be completely stripped of all powers relating to foreign affairs and foreign policy, but this proposal met with fierce resistance from the three candidates of the largest parties – Tarja Halonen, Matti Vanhanen and Sauli Niinistö. Halonen, the main left-wing candidate and incumbent president, has further indicated that the president's powers should not be increased either, since it would, in her opinion, reduce the degree of democratic decision-making.\nAnother important election theme was the threat of international terrorism and how to counter it. The main right-wing candidate, Sauli Niinistö, stated in the last presidential debate that he would consider Finland's membership \"in a more European\" North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) after 2008 to achieve such an end, but this was strongly rejected by the other main candidates. The only candidate openly embracing NATO-membership was the other right-wing candidate, Henrik Lax, of the Swedish People's Party. According to a poll carried out by the Taloustutkimus polling agency in July 2005, most Finnish people believe that NATO membership would increase the risk of international terrorism in Finland instead of decreasing it. This is also the view held by Vanhanen, of the Centre Party, and Halonen.\nOther themes included Christian values emphasised by Bjarne Kallis; stronger ties around the Baltic Sea and a stronger European Union by Henrik Lax; criticism of the EU by Timo Soini and the state of entrepreneurship and the returning of Karelia by Arto Lahti.\nSauli Niinistö raised the state of work as another theme. His campaign slogan was \"President of the workers\" (Työväen presidentti) and this provoked many union activists and left-wing supporters and voters. However, he was also criticised for trying to lure left-wing voters to vote for him with this slogan. Niinistö's campaign stated that there was neither \"left-wing work\" nor \"right-wing work\" but only Finnish work for Finnish welfare.\nConan O'Brien\nAmerican late night talk show host Conan O'Brien endorsed re-election for Tarja Halonen on his show due to a long-standing joke about his resemblance to incumbent president Halonen. The skits, commentary, and mock campaign ads were seen on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' on SubTV, a Finnish cable channel, five days a week (with a brief delay). Markku Jääskeläinen, Halonen's campaign manager, noted that the frequent mention of Halonen's name was positive for their campaign, and the running bits on the show attracted international attention to the election.\nOpinion polls\nHere is a collection of latest poll results. The opinion pollsters' methods may vary, as do the samples and the conducting time, which give the differences.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"  class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; clear: right\"\n!width=\"150\"|runoff election\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"orange\" |MTV3 16-18/01\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"yellow\" |HS 16–17/01\n|-\n|3 Sauli Niinistö\n|45 %\n|47 %\n|-\n|9 Tarja Halonen\n|55 %\n|53 %\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"  class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; clear: right\"\n!width=\"150\"|first round\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |Yle 10–11/01\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"orange\" |MTV3 weeks 52, 1 and 2\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"yellow\" |HS 05–07/01\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"yellow\" |HS 27–29/12\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"white\" |AL 12–29/12\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"yellow\" |HS 07–17/12\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |Yle 09/12\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"yellow\" |HS 05/11\n!width=\"40\" bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |Yle 05/11\n|-\n|2 Bjarne Kallis\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|2 %\n|2 %\n|1,4 %\n|2 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|-\n|3 Sauli Niinistö\n|20 %\n|19 %\n|21 %\n|20 %\n|20,3 %\n|20 %\n|18 %\n|24 %\n|19 %\n|-\n|4 Timo Soini\n|4 %\n|3 %\n|3 %\n|2 %\n|1,4 %\n|2 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|-\n|5 Heidi Hautala\n|4 %\n|3 %\n|3 %\n|2 %\n|2,3 %\n|2 %\n|2 %\n|3 %\n|1 %\n|-\n|6 Henrik Lax\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|1,0 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|-\n|7 Matti Vanhanen\n|18 %\n|17 %\n|18 %\n|18 %\n|16,5 %\n|19 %\n|19 %\n|18 %\n|15 %\n|-\n|8 Arto Lahti\n|1 %\n|7\n|na8\n|na9\n|-\n|9 Tarja Halonen\n|52 %\n|55 %\n|51 %\n|54 %\n|56,2 %\n|55 %\n|58 %\n|52 %\n|61 %\n|}\nThe total percentages may exceed 100% due to rounding.\nTwo of the latest polls made by Taloustutkimus and Suomen Gallup raised discussion over whether Halonen would gain the 50%+ majority of the votes necessary to win the election in a single round. According to Helsingin Sanomat, the reason why Halonen's support has decreased in polls might be an increase in the number of people not wanting to reveal their favourite candidate: some of them plead to the secrecy of voting. The airtime and space given by the media for the candidates may have given the candidates with smaller support the opportunity to bring their opinions to the public, which might add to their support in the polls in question.\nOn the other hand, the latest poll conducted by Research International (2) showed no change in Halonen's popularity between the three different weeks.\nThe candidates and their supporters read their polls for their advantage. In Timo Soini's mind there was a big surprise waiting in the ballot boxes; he did, in fact, receive 3.4% of the vote, which was much more than the support for his True Finns party in the last parliamentary election. Tarja Halonen stated this election as being the only one showing such a big support to her: \"The crossbar is trembling just right\", she said on January 10, meaning the excitement of getting the majority of the votes. Sauli Niinistö publicly stated that there would be a second round between him and Halonen.\nResults\nThe candidate in plurality in each municipality of Finland on the first (left) round (represents the geographical distribution but not population of supporters in plurality) and the candidate in majority on the second round (right).\nVoting took place from 09:00 to 20:00 on both of the two election days, with specifically designated periods for advance voting before both the first and second rounds.  Every municipality was required by law to have at least one polling station.  Voting was organised abroad for expatriate Finnish citizens at Finnish embassies, consulates and honorary consulates worldwide. The candidates were voted for directly by the electorate.  Votes were counted nationally.\nThe counting of advance votes started at 15:00, and was expected to finish before 20:00, when the first preliminary results were announced.  The preliminary counting of the election day votes began at 20:00, after which the votes were delivered to the central election committee in Helsinki, which performed a recount.  The definitive result in Finnish presidential elections is required by law to be confirmed on the following Tuesday at 10:00 at the latest. However, enough votes are normally counted during the first hour after polling stations close for an unofficial, but clear, result to be announced.\nA second round run-off was held on 29 January 2006 between Tarja Halonen (Social Democratic Party) and Sauli Niinistö (National Coalition Party).\nOpinion polls predicted a close election. A January 19 poll (HS Gallup) gave Halonen 53% and Niinistö 47% of the vote. By comparison, in October 2005 a clear majority of 70% would have voted for Halonen when asked to choose between her and Niinistö.\nFour of the six candidates who did not make it to the second round, Matti Vanhanen, Bjarne Kallis, Henrik Lax and Arto Lahti publicly expressed their support for Sauli Niinistö in the runoff election. This reflects a loose alliance termed porvariyhteistyö in the Finnish media, (roughly translated as \"bourgeois collaboration\"). According to Niinistö and Vanhanen, the main centre-right parties (the National Coalition Party and the Centre Party) had agreed about a year earlier on some level of co-operation to better compete with Halonen, who was supported by both the Social Democrats and Left Alliance.\nFirst round results by region\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:right\n!Province\n!Tarja Halonen\n!align=left|Sauli Niinistö\n!align=left|Matti Vanhanen\n!align=left|Heidi Hautala\n!align=left|Timo Soini\n!align=left|Bjarne Kallis\n!align=left|Henrik Lax\n!align=left|Arto Lahti\n!Electorate\n!Votes\n!
