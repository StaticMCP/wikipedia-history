It was taken over by the Royal Australian Air Force in October 1941 as Landing Ground No. 375 and formally acquired by the Commonwealth government in June 1943, becoming RAAF Station Kingaroy. Four runways and 180 buildings were constructed between July 1942 and May 1943. It was downgraded to an unstaffed Emergency Landing Ground in June 1945 and returned to civilian control in July 1946. On 17 March, 1949, Minister for Air C. F. Adermann suggested that Kingaroy Airport should act as an alternative landing ground to Eagle Farm Airport in Brisbane if the Brisbane airports were ever closed. The minister was investigating the sustainability of this role. One hangar was purchased by the Air Board, with other hangars retained by Civil Aviation.\nCurrent facilities\nThere are two runways, the main is 16/34 and is , paved and the second, 05/23, is , grass. There are no scheduled services but the airport is used by charter flights to the gas fields in far west Queensland.\nThe airport is used for gliding.\nSee also\n* List of airports in Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120614045239/http://www.southburnett.qld.gov.au/web/guest/aerodromes South Burnett Aerodromes]"
