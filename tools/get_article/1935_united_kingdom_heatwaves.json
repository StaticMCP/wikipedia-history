This heat wave, while not as extensively documented as some other heatwaves in UK history, left a mark on the weather records of the time.\nThe year 1935 saw notable weather anomalies in the United Kingdom, including an unusual winter heatwave in January and an exceptionally dry July. These events were significant deviations from the expected seasonal climate patterns and were widely reported at the time.\nThe drought records were not overtaken until the 2022 heatwave.\nJanuary 1935 winter heatwave\nIn early January 1935, the United Kingdom experienced a rare winter heatwave, particularly affecting London and parts of Wales and Scotland. Reports from the time indicated that it was the warmest on record since 1806, with temperatures only 4 degrees than the monthly June average.\nThe unseasonable warmth led to several unusual seasonal phenomena:\n*Roses bloomed in Wales despite in being winter.\n*Daffodils appeared much earlier than expected in South England.\n*Spring flowers appeared across areas of Scotland where snow usually would be, high hills across the country remained devoid of usual snow cover.\nJuly 1935 drought\nJuly 1935 was marked by an exceptional drought across England, making it one of the driest Julys on record at the time. The Central England Temperature (CET) for the month was recorded at 17.1°C, reflecting above-average warmth.\nThe conditions were caused after unusually thundery June, extensive sunshine was also observed, contributing to parched landscapes and agricultural concerns. Rainfall was also scarce this month.\nReferences"
