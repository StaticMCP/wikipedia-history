It was fought off Durazzo (now Durrës), Albania at the end of December 1915 and involved the navies of Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Italy, and France.\nBattle\nIn December 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Navy sent a cruiser squadron into the Adriatic Sea to interfere with Allied operations related to the Serbian Campaign. The new light cruiser  — with a main armament of nine  guns — accompanied by five s left Cattaro and headed for Durazzo (now Durrës) late on 28&nbsp;December&nbsp;1915, with the Austro-Hungarian submarine  and two Austro-Hungarian destroyers already off Durazzo on patrol. While on passage, the Austro-Hungarians sighted the French submarine  on patrol to the south of Cattaro. The destroyer  opened gunfire on Monge, then rammed and sank her.\nEarly the next day, the Austro-Hungarian squadron arrived off Durazzo and opened fire on the town, with Helgoland sinking a Greek steamer and two schooners. Then the destroyer  ran into a minefield and was sunk and the destroyer  was crippled by another mine. The destroyer  attempted to take Triglav in tow, but fouled a propeller, and the job was taken over by the destroyer . The Austro-Hungarian force then proceeded slowly northward toward their base at Cattaro.\nAllied forces in Brindisi on the coast of Italy were alerted to the Austro-Hungarian force's presence at sea, and the British light cruiser  and the Italian protected cruiser , escorted by five French destroyers, sortied in an attempt to cut off the Austro-Hungarian ships from Cattaro. These were followed two hours later by the Italian protected cruiser , the British light cruiser , and four Italian destroyers. The Austro-Hungarians also responded and despatched from Cattaro the armored cruiser , the protected cruiser , and scout cruiser  to support the returning survivors of the raid, but they did not see action.\nEarly in the afternoon of 29 December, the leading Allied ships came into action with the Austro-Hungarian squadron, which was still only halfway home. During the battle the italian cruiser Quarto hit the Austro-Hungarian cruiser Helgoland five times, Quarto also hit the destroyer Csepel once. The French destroyers headed for the already crippled Triglav and sank her before rejoining the British and Italian cruisers.\nMeanwhile, the Allied cruisers attempted to cut off and deal with Helgoland and the three remaining Austro-Hungarian destroyers. In a long-range gunnery duel fought throughout the afternoon, Tatra suffered a damaged engine from several shell hits, but Helgoland skillfully avoided the Allied cruisers and the surviving Austro-Hungarian ships reached Cattaro safely, albeit after having lost the valuable Lika and Triglav.\nSee also\n* Mediterranean naval engagements during World War I\n* Otranto Barrage\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
