The 2022 WIPO General Assembly decided that a short version of the draft (the \"Chair's text\") which had been drafted by Australian ambassador Ian Gross, Chair of the IGC in 2019, would be the basis for the treaty's negotiations. Prior to that decision, the text which was expected to be used as basis for the negotiations was the \"Consolidated text\", a more comprehensive document on which IGC Member States had been working on by consensus during years.\nContrary to the Consolidated text which addressed traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions as such, and different forms of intellectual property, the ''Chair's text focused only on genetic resources and the patent system.\nIn August 2023, India submitted a proposal with a series of amendments to the Chair’s text, aiming to add back some elements from the Consolidated text in the discussion.\n2023: IGC Special Session and Preparatory Committee\nAhead of the Diplomatic Conference, two extraordinary meetings were convened to prepare the Conference:\n* Special Session of the IGC (4–8 September 2023)\n* Preparatory Committee of the Diplomatic Conference (11–13 September, and 13 December 2023).\nThe Special Session which took place from 4 to 8 September 2023, reviewed part of the Chair's text containing substantive articles. The Preparatory Committee which was held the week after, addressed administrative and procedural parts of the draft. Jointly, these two meetings yielded a revised draft, which serves as the basis for the 2024 Diplomatic Conference discussions.\nThe Preparatory Committee'' also adopted Draft Rules of Procedure for the Diplomatic Conference, as well as a List of Invitees. On 13 September 2023, the committee had to suspend its session due to the absence of submission by Member States of proposals to host the Diplomatic Conference. On 13 December, the committee reconvened to adopt a decision to hold the Diplomatic Conference at WIPO's headquarters in Geneva, facing the lack of alternative proposals.\nDiplomatic Conference and adoption in 2024\nConvening and organization\nAs explained on the website of the Diplomatic Conference:On July 21, 2022, the WIPO General Assembly decided to convene a Diplomatic Conference to conclude an International Legal Instrument Relating to Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Traditional Knowledge Associated with Genetic Resources no later than 2024.The Diplomatic Conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland, between 13 and 24 May 2024. During the Conference, the draft resulting from the Special Session and Preparatory Committee was discussed and amended.\nParticipation at the Diplomatic Conference\nAdoption and signatures\nThe final legal instrument, the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (often referred to by its acronym \"GRATK\") was adopted in the night of Thursday 23 to Friday 24 May 2024, and opened for signature the 24 May in the afternoon, at the WIPO headquarter in Geneva.This is the first WIPO Treaty to address the interface between intellectual property, genetic resources and traditional knowledge and the first WIPO Treaty to include provisions specifically for Indigenous Peoples as well as local communities. The Treaty, once it enters into force with 15 contracting parties, will establish in international law a new disclosure requirement for patent applicants whose inventions are based on genetic resources and/or associated traditional knowledge.The Treaty was concluded on 24 May 2024 and immediately opened for signature. Under the Treaty's Article 16, it is stated that the Treaty will be \"open for signature at the Diplomatic Conference in Geneva and thereafter […] for one year after its adoption.\"\nAt the closing of the Diplomatic Conference, on 24 May 2024, the Treaty was signed by 30 countries: Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Morocco, Namibia, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Niue, North Korea, Paraguay, Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uruguay, and Vanuatu.\nRatifications and entry into force\nUnder Article 17, the Treaty is planned to enter into force 3 months after ratification or accession by 15 countries.\nSignature, ratification and accession is open to any Member State of the WIPO, under the Treaty's Article 12. Countries that sign the Treaty within the first year period (until 24 May 2025) have to further ratify it in order for the Treaty to enter into force. Countries deciding to join after the initial one-year period will join through \"adhesion\" (equivalent to both signature and ratification). In December 2024, 39 countries have signed the treaty.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Accessions to the GRATK Treaty\n! rowspan=\"2\" |WIPO Member States\n! colspan=\"2\" |Accession Process No. 1\n!Accession Process No. 2\n|-\n!Signature\n!Ratification\n!Adhesion\n|-\n|\n| rowspan=\"30\" |24 May 2024\n|\n| rowspan=\"44\" |n/a\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|28 May 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|14 June 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|8 July 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|8 July 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|10 July 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|16 July 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|3 December 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|4 December 2024\n|9 July 2025\n|-\n|\n|12 December 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|4 March 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|4 March 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|16 March 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|21 May 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|23 May 2025\n|\n|}\nLegal provisions\nPreamble and objectives\nDisclosures requirements (Article 3)\nMatters of retroactivity (Article 4)\nSanctions and remedies (Article 5)\nDatabases and information systems (Article 6)\nRelationships with other treaties (Article 7)\nReview of the scope and contents of the Treaty (Article 8) and other forms of amendment (Articles 14 and 15)\nAssembly of Contracting Parties (Article 10)\nSecretariat (Article 11)\nSee also\n* World Intellectual Property Organization – Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore\n* Biopiracy –– Bioprospecting\n* Patents –– Patent Law Treaty –– Patent Cooperation Treaty\n* Nagoya Protocol –– High Seas Treaty\n* UNDRIP –– UNDROP\nFurther reading\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/gratk/ Official WIPO webpage on the GRATK]"
