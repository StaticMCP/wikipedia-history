An army sent led by Brigadier Andrei Veterani was encircled by a combined Chechen–Kumyk force, as a result of which the corps was defeated and forced to retreat. Another detachment under Colonel Naumov broke into Endirey and destroyed it.\nHistory\nIn 1718, a large mountaineer force led by Aidemir Bardykhanov attacked Russian Terek fortifications and Cossack villages in retaliation for recent Cossack raids on Chechen villages. In February 1721, he conducted a major attack on the Terki fortress but was repelled with heavy losses. Together with a series of other Chechen and Kumyk raids on Russian territory, this led to the 2 punitive campaigns against the mountaineers in 1722.\nThe people of Endirey began preparing for a potential Russian campaign by fortifying the town and setting up defences, including defensive ditches, while non–combatants were evacuated to the mountains. Chechen fighters also came to help the Endireyans.\nIn July 1722, an army under the command of Brigadier Andrei Veterani was sent to punish the rebels and occupy the town Endirey, the capital of the Endirey Khanate. On his way, he was joined by the princes of Greater Kabardia—Elmurza Cherkassky and Mutsal Cherkassky, who were lieutenants in the Russian army, and a prince of Lesser Kabardia—Aslambek Kommetov. Some sources say the army counted 2,400 men, while other sources say it was 6,400 strong.\nIn a gorge on the Aktash River near Endirey, the army was encircled by a combined Chechen–Kumyk force, between 5,000 and 6,000, led by the two princes. The rebels, armed with sabers, daggers, arrows and guns, ran out from the forest, attacked the Russian detachment and quickly retreated back into the forest. Taken by surprise, the panicking Russian army could not offer any serious resistance and was forced to retreat, with 89 soldiers killed and 115 wounded. The Chechens and Kumyks also suffered considerable losses, with many being captured.\nReinforcements under Colonel Naumov soon arrived and left a part of his troops to hold their position and distract the rebels, while he and the main army directly attacked Endirey. Under fierce rebel resistance, the army of Naumov broke through the Endireyan defences and destroyed the entire town, leaving \"nothing but ashes\" behind.\nAs a result of the failure of the campaign, Peter the Great sent a 15,000 strong army to Chechnya and the Endirey Khanate, which devastated destroyed several villages. As a result, the Khanate went into decline.\nSee also\n* Insurgency in Chechnya (1722) — Main conflict\n* Aidemir Bardykhanov — One of the main commanders of the rebel forces\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*  |last=Хасбулатов |first=А.И. |url=https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21678449 |title=История Чечни с древнейших времён до наших дней |last2=Гапуров |first2=Ш.А. |last3=Ахмадов |first3=Ш.Б. |last4=Багаев |first4=М.Х. |last5=Хизриев |first5=Х.А. |last6=Ахмадов |first6=Я.З. |last7=Исаев |first7=С.А. |last8=Бадаев |first8=С.Э.С. |last9=Ибрагимова |first9=З.Х. |publisher=Книжное издательство |year=2006 |isbn=978-5-98896-103-1 |editor-last=Ибрагимов |editor-first=М.М. |location=Grozny |pages=300–301 |language=Russian |trans-title=History of Chechnya from the ancient times to the present day}}\n*\n*\n*"
