It runs through the state's high desert country from the town of Burns to the unincorporated community of Fields. It was designated as an Oregon Scenic Byway in 2003. The highway is maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT). There are a number of points of interest along the route including several that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nRoute description\nStarting from Burns, travel east on Oregon Route 78 for .

In addition, the P Ranch Historic District is located approximately  east of the community center. From Frenchglen, the Discovery byway heads west and then southwest over a low pass into the Catlow Valley, west of Steens Mountain. Shortly after entering the valley, there is a turnoff for the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge to the west. However, the Discovery byway continues to follow Route 205. It passes by the Roaring Springs Ranch, running parallel with Catlow Rim just east of the highway. After following the rim for approximately , the byway turns southeast and begins to claim over Steens Mountain. On its last leg, the byway passes over Long Hollow Summit and descends into the Pueblo Valley. The High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway ends at the small unincorporated community of Fields. The entire scenic byway trip covers .\nAlternate tour routes\nThe Diamond Loop Tour Route and the Steens Loop Tour Route are side trips from the main byway.

The route passes several other viewpoints along the crest of Steen Mountain as well. The tour provides an opportunity to spot Bighorn sheep on the mountain’s rocky cliffs. The Steen Mountain loop road is closed during the winter months.\nPoints of interest\nThe goal of the Oregon state byway program is to preserve the state's most outstanding scenic highway corridors. It is also designed to provide interesting tourist opportunities for the traveling public. Oregon byways highlight the scenic, historic, recreational, and cultural features found along the routes. All of Oregon’s byways must met road standards that accommodate most travelers and are maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation.\nThere are a number of interesting sights and places along the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway route.

Congress put the Federal Highway Administration in charge of managing the program. The program is intends to promote economic development and tourism by protecting scenic highway routes, often in less-traveled areas of the country. To be designated as a scenic byway, the road must have unique natural, archaeological, cultural, historic, scenic, or recreational value.\nIn the early 1990s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management proposed a scenic byway between New Princeton and Lakeview. The proposed route ran through Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, and Warner Wetlands. The plan included the construction of three visitor centers along the route plus 24 interpretive waysides. However, a national byway was never established.\nIn 2003, the state of Oregon designated a portion of Oregon Route 205 as the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway. It was a shorter route than the one proposed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management, and did not include any visitor centers along the way. In addition to the main byway, the state also approved the Diamond Loop and Steens Loop scenic tour routes that year.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Beginning of the byway}}\n|notes=}}\n|notes=End of the byway}}\nSee also\n*National Scenic Byway\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.co.harney.or.us Harney County, Oregon]"
