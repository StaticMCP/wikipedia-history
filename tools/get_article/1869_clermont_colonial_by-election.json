He resigned on 29 January 1869, claiming it was the only honourable course of action due to \"the treachery, the weakness, and the lust for office\" of the leaders of the Queensland Parliament. However, it was suggested that he resigned before his election was voided because his nomination was invalid. Oscar de Satge won the resulting by-election on 4 March 1869.\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1868–1870\nReferences"
