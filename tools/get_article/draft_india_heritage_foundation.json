The foundation was established to promote Indian art, culture, and heritage by supporting institutions engaged in activities relating to these fields, following in the footsteps of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the Founder-Āchārya of ISKCON.\nActivities and Initiatives\nLittle Krishna Animation Series\nOne of IHF’s most notable projects is the co-production of the animated series Little Krishna, developed in partnership with Reliance Big Animation. The 13-episode children’s series was created after seven years of research by ISKCON Bangalore devotees and an award-winning creative team. It presents the pastimes of Krishna in a contemporary and entertaining manner and has been broadcast internationally, winning several awards for its animation and storytelling.\nSpiritual Theme Park\nIn 2010, IHF announced plans for a large-scale spiritual theme park near Bengaluru. With an estimated budget of ₹350 crore, the 28-acre project was envisioned to depict mythological episodes through temple-like structures and immersive experiences.\nCultural and Religious Events\nThe foundation also organises and supports major cultural and religious festivals for the Indian diaspora.\n* In 2025, IHF hosted Rama Navami celebrations in New Jersey, USA, which drew over 400 participants and featured traditional rituals such as Sita Rama Kalyanam, devotional music, and prasadam distribution. The event was attended by senior diplomats including Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN.\n* IHF has also been active in the United States through events such as the first Ratha Yatra festival held in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, which introduced the local community to the chariot festival tradition of Lord Jagannath.\nSee also\n* ISKCON Bangalore\n* Little Krishna\nReferences"
