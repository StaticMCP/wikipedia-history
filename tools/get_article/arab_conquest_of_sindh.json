Hakim ibn Jabala al-Abdi, who attacked Makran in the year 649 AD, was an early partisan of Ali ibn Abu Talib. During the caliphate of Ali, many Jats of Sindh had come under influence of Islam and some even participated in the Battle of Camel and died fighting for Ali. Harith ibn Murrah al-Abdi and Sayfi ibn Fasayl' al-Shaybani, both officers of Ali's army, attacked Makran in the year 658. Sayfi was one of the seven shias who were beheaded alongside Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi in 660 AD near Damascus. Under the Umayyads (661–750 AD), many Shias sought asylum in the region of Sindh, to live in relative peace in the remote area. Ziyad Hindi is one of those refugees. The only solid gain at that time was the conquest of Makran.\nBackground\nAlthough there was no connection between Arabia and Sindh, the war being started was due to events of piracy that plagued the Arabian Sea, at the time the Caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate offered Raja Dahir protection and sovereignty if he would help him in quelling the piracy. Raja Dahir of Sindh had refused to return Arab rebels from Sindh, Meds and others. Med pirates shipping from their bases at Kutch, Debal and Kathiawar. Hostilities resumed between Sindh and Umayyads in 708 AD, when one of the pirate raid had kidnapped Muslim women traveling from Sri Lanka to Arabia near the port of Debal, thus providing a casus belli against Sindhi King Dahir. The Umayyad governor of Iraq, Al-Hajjaj wrote to Raja Dahir to set the women free. But Dahir expressed his inability to help retrieve the hostages. This gave Al-Hajjaj to sent expedition to Sindh.\nInvasion\nRaids on Debal\nHajjaj first dispatched ‘Ubaidullah to raid across Debal but he was defeated and killed. Next an army was sent under Budail by way of sea from Oman. Budail received reinforcements and marched towards Debal where he was checked by Jaisimha, son of Dahir. A pitched battle ensued, lasting a whole day. At the end, the Muslim army was routed and Budail was killed.\nMuhammad ibn al-Qasim's expedition\nPrelude\nFinally Hajjaj appointed his seventeen year old nephew Muhammad ibn al-Qasim to conquer Sindh with the approval of the Caliph al-Walid I (). Al-Hajjaj equipped an army built around 6,000 Syrian cavalry and detachments of mawali from Iraq, six thousand camelry, and a baggage train of 3,000 Bactrian camels under his nephew Muhammad bin Qasim to Sindh. More reinforcements arrived from the governor of Makran with five catapults (''manj'neeqs'') were sent to Debal by sea.\nSiege of Debal\nMuhammad bin Qasim laid siege and successfully conquered Debal leaving 4,000 Muslims behind and built a mosque in the city. The captive Muslim women were also released, and many prisoners were made while one-fifth of booty and slaves were sent to Al-Hajjaj. The chief of the Hindus of Debal converted to Islam and appointed as advisor of revenue officials. Next Muhammad bin Qasim proceeded to Nerun (Hyderabad) and Siwistan (Sehwan) where the local Buddhist priets aligned with Muhammad bin Qasim against the local the governors who were routed and defeated. They also aided Umayyads with provisions and entered into friendly relation. Mosques were built replacing idol-houses here too.\nBattle of Aror\nMuhammad bin Qasim proceeded on the western bank of Indus River where some of the chiefs offered alliance. Mokah Basayah 'the king of Island of Bet' deserted Dahir and promised to supply Muhammad with boats for crossing the Indus on receiving as reward a large stretch of the conquered territory. The Thakurs of Bhatta and the ‘western Jats’ all paid homage (bay'ah) to the Arabs, joined them, and were posted on the island. Muhammad bin Qasim was re-inforced by 2000 select horse sent by Hajjaj and 4000 warlike Jats from Siwistan. After two months of camping the Umayyads crossed the eastern bank of Indus and was joined by the brother of Mokah who helped him to cross the lake between the two armies. Dahir, supported by the chiefs of Sindh and 'eastern Jats' met the Umayyads at near Aror. Dahir who was boarding elephant and struck by an arrow and killed. His son Jaisimha retreated to Brahmanabad in Sind leaving the queen behind at the fort of Aror. Muhammad promptly laid siege on the fort. The queen committed Jauhar alongside with the female at fort. Muhammad bin Qasim next marched to Brahmanabad. Dahir’s head and the heads of ‘the chiefs of Hind’ were sent to Al-Hajjaj, with the fifth of the booty and slaves, including ‘those who were daughters of princes’. Al-Hajjaj delivered a sermon in the Great Mosque of Kufa declaring the conquest of Sindh.\nConquest of Brahmanabad, Alor and Multan\nJaisimha fortified Brahmanabad as well as the capital city Alor. He led an army to disrupt Muhammad's supply lines. Jaisimha's chiefs minister joined Muhammad. After six-months' defense, Brahmanabad fell after some citizens entered a secret pact with the invading army. Muhammad then subdued other regions before capturing Alor after brief resistance. He then besieged Multan, which resisted for two months but surrendered due to treachery.\nCasualties\nWhere resistance was strong, prolonged, and intensive, often resulting in considerable Arab casualties, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim's response was dramatic, inflicting 6,000 deaths at Aror (Rohri), between 6,000 and 26,000 at Brahmanabad, 4,000 at Iskalandah (Uch), and 6,000 at Multan. Conversely, in areas taken by sulh, such as Armabil, Nirun, and Aror, resistance was light and few casualties occurred. Sulh appeared to be Muhammad ibn al-Qasim's preferred mode of conquest, the method used for more than 60% of the towns and tribes recorded by al-Baladhuri and the Chach Nama. At one point, he was actually berated by Al-Hajjaj for being too lenient. Meanwhile, the common folk were often pardoned and encouraged to continue working; Al-Hajjaj ordered that this option not be granted to any inhabitant of Debal, yet Muhammad ibn al-Qasim still bestowed it upon certain groups and individuals.\nHindu and Buddhist response\nThe majority of Sindh's population at the time of the Umayyad Conquests was Hindu, but a significant minority adhered to Buddhism as well.\nBurjor Avari writes that it's likely that Buddhists collaborated and sided with the Arabs before the invasion even began, something that the primary sources describe as well.\nSoviet historian, Yu V. Gankovsky, writes that the Arab invasions were only made successful, because leaders of the Buddhist community of Sindh, despised and opposed the Brahmin ruler, hence sympathizing with the Arab invaders and even helping them in times.\nOn the other hand, Hindu Brahmin resistance against the Arabs continued for much longer, both in upper Sindh and Multan.\nThe eastern Hindu Jats supported the Sindhi king, Dahir, against the Arab invaders, whereas the western Jats aligned with Muhammad bin Qasim against Dahir. Having settled the question of the freedom of religion and the social status of the Brahmins, Muhammad bin al-Qasim turned against the Jats and Lohanas. Chronicles such as the Chach Nama, Zainul-Akhbar and Tarikh-i Bayhaqi have recorded battles between Hindu Jats and forces of Muhammad ibn Qasim.\nReasons for success\nMuhammad ibn al-Qasim's success has been partly ascribed to Dahir being an unpopular Hindu king ruling over a Buddhist majority who saw Chach of Alor and his kin as usurpers of the Rai dynasty. This is attributed to having resulted in support being provided by Buddhists and inclusion of rebel soldiers serving as valuable infantry in his cavalry-heavy force from the Jat and Meds. Brahman, Buddhist, Greek, and Arab testimony however can be found that attests towards amicable relations between the adherents of the two religions up to the 7th century.\nAlong with this were:\n# Superior military equipment; such as siege engines and the Mongol bow.\n# Troop discipline and leadership.\n# The concept of Jihad as a morale booster.\n# Religion, i.e. the widespread belief in the prophecy of Muslim success.\n# The Samanis being persuaded to submit and not take up arms because the majority of the population was Buddhist who were dissatisfied with their rulers, who were Hindu.\n# The labouring under disabilities of the Lohana Jats.\n# Defections from among Dahir's chiefs and nobles.\nAftermath\nThe motive of the expedition was not to propagate Islam but to free the Muslim women captured off Debal.\nAfter conquering Brahmanabad, Muhammad co-opted the local Brahman elite, whom he held in esteem, re-appointing them to posts held under the Brahman dynasty and offering honours and awards to their religious leaders and scholars. This arrangement with local Brahman elites resulted in the continued persecution of Buddhists, with Bin Qasim confirming the existing Brahman regulation forbidding them from wearing anything but coarse clothing and requiring them to always walk barefoot accompanied by dogs.\nFollowing his success in Sindh, Muhammad bin Qasim wrote to \"the kings of al-Hind (India)\", calling upon them to surrender and accept the faith of Islam. He dispatched a force against al-Baylaman (Bhinmal), which is said to have offered submission. The Med people of Surast (Maitraka dynasty of Vallabhi) also made peace. Bin Qasim then sent a cavalry of 10,000 to Kannauj, along with a decree from the Caliph. He went with an army to the prevailing frontier of Kashmir called Panj-Māhīyāt (in Western Punjab). Nothing is known of the Kanauj expedition. The frontier of Kashmir might be what is referred to as al-Kiraj in later records (Kira Kingdom in present-day Kangra Valley, Himachal Pradesh), which was subdued.\nBin Qasim was recalled in 715 CE and died en route. Al-Baladhuri writes that, upon his departure, the kings of al-Hind had come back to their kingdoms. The period of Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) was relatively peaceful. Umar invited the kings of \"al-Hind\" to convert to Islam and become his subjects, in return for which they would continue to remain kings. Hullishah of Sindh and other kings accepted the offer and adopted Arab names.\nThe Umayyad conquest brought the region into the cosmopolitan network of Islam. Many Sindhi Muslims played an important part during the  Islamic Golden Age; including Abu Mashar Sindhi and Abu Raja Sindhi. Famous jurist Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i is also reported by Al-Dhahabi to be originally from Sindh.\nSee also\n* History of Sindh\n* List of monarchs of Sindh\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
