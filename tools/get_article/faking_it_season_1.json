Karma has tried many things to get in with the cool crowd but nothing has made them stand out until Shane, a popular kid in school, mistakes them for lesbians and invites them to his party. He mistakenly outs them and nominates them for prom queens. Basking in her new-found popularity, Karma convinces a reluctant Amy to continue the ruse. Amy's soon-to-be stepsister Lauren (and rival for homecoming queen) is infuriated by this and publicly reveals at a school assembly that the girls are \"Faking It\". Amy kisses Karma in an attempt to defend Karma from public humiliation at the hands of Lauren. The kiss makes Amy aware that her feelings for Karma are more complex than she realized. This is the first appearance of the \"Woah, I Know\" tagline that is repeated throughout the series.\n| LineColor       = EEDC82\n}}\n| Viewers         = 0.86\n| ShortSummary    = Lauren threatens to out Amy to her conservative divorced mother as Hester High gets ready for their first-ever same-sex Homecoming Dance.
