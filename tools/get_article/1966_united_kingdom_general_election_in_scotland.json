The election took place only 17 months after the 1964 United Kingdom general election, with incumbent Prime Minister Harold Wilson deciding to call a snap election since his government had an unworkably small majority of only four MPs. Combined with results from across the UK, the result was a landslide victory for Wilson's Labour Party.\nThe election was the first in which the Scottish Conservatives stood for election as an integral part of the Conservative Party, with the former Unionist Party (which had been aligned with, but separate from, the Conservatives), having merged into the Tories in April 1965. Both Labour and Liberal parties gained seats from the newly merged Conservatives at the election.\nMPs\nList of MPs for constituencies in Scotland (1966–1970)\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" | Party\n! align=\"center\" | Seats\n! align=\"center\" | Seatschange\n! align=\"center\" | Votes\n! align=\"center\" | %\n! align=\"center\" | %change\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 46\n| align=\"center\" |  3\n| align=\"center\" | 1,273,916\n| align=\"center\" | 49.9\n| align=\"center\" |  1.2\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 20\n| align=\"center\" |  4\n| align=\"center\" | 960,675\n| align=\"center\" | 37.6\n| align=\"center\" |  3.0\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" |  1\n| align=\"center\" | 172,447\n| align=\"center\" | 6.8\n| align=\"center\" |  0.8\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" | 128,474\n| align=\"center\" | 5.0\n| align=\"center\" |  2.6\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" | 16,230\n| align=\"center\" | 0.6\n| align=\"center\" |  0.1\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" | 638\n| align=\"center\" | 0.0\n| align=\"center\" |  0.2\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"right\" | Turnout:\n| align=\"center\" |  2,552,380\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" |\n|}\nVotes summary\n|49.91}}\n|37.64}}\n|6.76}}\n|5.03}}\n}}\n|64.79}}\n|28.17}}\n|border=darkgray|7.04}}}}\nReferences"
