It is one of several categories of the annual GLAAD Media Awards, presented by GLAAD—an American non-governmental media monitoring organization—at ceremonies in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco between March and June.\nComic books and graphic novels selected by GLAAD are evaluated based on four criteria: \"Fair, Accurate, and Inclusive Representations\" of the LGBT community, \"Boldness and Originality\" of the project, significant \"Impact\" on mainstream culture, and \"Overall Quality\" of the project. GLAAD monitors mainstream media to identify which comic books will be nominated, while also issuing a Call for Entries that encourages media outlets to submit titles for consideration. Comics created by and for an LGBT audience must be submitted in order to be considered for nomination, as GLAAD does not monitor such works for defamation. Winners are determined by a plurality vote by GLAAD staff and board, Shareholders Circle members, as well as volunteers and allies. Nominees in this category must be an original graphic novel or an anthology of short stories appearing in the same book released by a mainstream publisher and its subsidiary labels. At GLAAD's discretion, a graphic novel or anthology from another publisher may be nominated if the book achieves a similar level of visibility and impact. Trade paperbacks of previously published material are not eligible.\nThe category was first introduced at the 33rd GLAAD Media Awards in 2022 as a sister category to the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book, which honored both comics and graphic novels from 1992 to 2021. The inaugural winner of the award was Cheer Up: Love and Pompoms, a graphic novel by Crystal Frasier which was published by Oni Press.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background:#99ff99; height:20px; width:20px\" |\n|Indicates the winner\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Award year\n! scope=\"col\" |Comic\n! scope=\"col\" |Writer(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Publisher\n! class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"10\" scope=\"rowgroup\" |2022\n(33rd)\n| style=\"background:#99ff99;\" |Cheer Up!
