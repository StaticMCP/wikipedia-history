It originates in the Eastern Ghats near Pakala, Tirupati district, and flows for about 130&nbsp;km before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Unlike many other rivers of the region, it does not join a major river system and its flow is largely dependent on seasonal rainfall.\nThe Swarnamukhi basin encompasses two of the most sacred pilgrimage centers in South India — Tirumala, home of the Sri Venkateswara Swami Temple, and Srikalahasti, famed for the Srikalahasteeswara temple — underscoring the river’s deep cultural and religious significance.\nGeography\nThe Swarnamukhi rises at about 300 m above sea level and flows northeast through forested areas, farmlands, and temple towns before reaching the sea. It drains a basin of roughly 3,225&nbsp;km².\nAnnual rainfall is uneven: around 1,270&nbsp;mm in the eastern basin, tapering to 762&nbsp;mm in the west. The river is non-perennial and highly seasonal.\nCultural significance\nThe basin is home to several of South India’s most revered pilgrimage centers:\n* Tirumala, where the Sri Venkateswara Temple is located.\n* Srikalahasti, home to the Srikalahasteeswara temple, dedicated to Shiva and often called Dakshina Kailasam.\nThe poet Dhurjati referred to the river as Mogaleru in his works.\nInfrastructure\nThe Kalyani Dam was constructed in 1977 across the Kalyani River, a tributary of Swarnamukhi. The gravity dam has a live storage capacity of 25 million cubic metres and supplies water to Tirupati city, often sufficient for up to two years.\nEnvironmental challenges\nHeavy metal contamination\nA 2018 study found that while river water was mostly free of contamination except for mild iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), the sediments showed considerable to very high levels of chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), posing eco-toxicological risks.\nIllegal sand mining\nIllegal sand excavation is widespread in Naidupeta, Pellakuru, and Ozili mandals. Reports highlight the role of the sand mafia and lack of enforcement, with sand transported illegally to markets like Chennai.\nA geospatial study identified nine sand-mining hotspots in Srikalahasti and Thotambedu areas, revealing over-exploitation is affecting river discharge capacity.\nEncroachment and land grabbing\nEncroachments include illegal construction in buffer zones, blocked nalas, and diverted channels. Such activities worsened flooding in 2021 and damaged the river’s ecological balance.\nConservation efforts\nIn 2025, the Tirupati Urban Development Authority (TUDA) launched Operation SWARNA (Swarnamukhi Waterbody Action for River and Nala Awareness), Andhra Pradesh’s first river rejuvenation programme.\nThe plan includes:\n* A drone survey from Thondavada to Srikalahasti to mark river boundaries and 50 m buffer zones.\n* Removal of illegal structures, with criminal cases filed against offenders.\n* Riverfront beautification at Tiruchanur to benefit pilgrims.\nReferences\nExternal links"
