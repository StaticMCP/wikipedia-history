The history of the city is divided into three kingdoms.\nFirst kingdom\nThe Sumerian King List (SKL) records a dynasty of six kings from Mari enjoying hegemony between the dynasty of Adab and the dynasty of Kish. The names of the Mariote kings were damaged on the early copies of the list, and those kings were correlated with historical kings that belonged to the second kingdom. However, an undamaged copy of the list that date to the Old Babylonian period was discovered in Shubat-Enlil, and the names bears no resemblance to any of the historically attested monarchs of the second kingdom, indicating that the compilers of the list had an older and probably a legendary dynasty in mind, that predate the second kingdom.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"border=\"1\"style=\"width:100%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"1%\"|#\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Inscription\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Ruler\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Epithet\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Succession\n!width=\"16.5%\"| date of reign\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Early Dynastic IIIa period ()\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|First Mariote kingdom ()\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"left\"||SKL}}\n|-\n|1st\n|rowspan=\"6\"|\n|Anbu𒀭𒁍\n|\n|\n|Uncertain,}}(30 or 90 years)\n|\n*This name is also read as Ilshu\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of, \"King\" of not just Mari; but, to have held the \"Kingship\" over all of Sumer\n*Known from the SKL; very little otherwise\n|-\n|2nd\n|Anba𒀭𒁀\n|\n|Son of Anbu\n|Uncertain,(7 or 17 years)\n|\n*Historicity uncertain\n*Known from the SKL; very little otherwise\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of, \"King\" of not just Mari; but, to have held the \"Kingship\" over all of Sumer\n|-\n|3rd\n|Bazi𒁀𒍣\n|\"the leatherworker\"\n|\n|Uncertain,(30 years)\n|\n*Historicity uncertain\n*Known from the SKL; very little otherwise\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of, \"King\" of not just Mari; but, to have held the \"Kingship\" over all of Sumer\n|-\n|4th\n|Zizi𒍣𒍣\n|\"the fuller\"\n|\n|Uncertain,(20 years)\n|\n*Historicity uncertain\n*Known from the SKL; very little otherwise\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of, \"King\" of not just Mari; but, to have held the \"Kingship\" over all of Sumer\n|-\n|5th\n|Limer𒇷𒅎𒅕\n|''\"the 'gudug' priest\"|group=note}}\n|\n|Uncertain,(30 years)\n|\n*Historicity uncertain\n*Known from the SKL; very little otherwise\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of, \"King\" of not just Mari; but, to have held the \"Kingship\" over all of Sumer\n|-\n|6th\n|Sharrum-iter𒈗𒄿𒌁\n|\n|\n|Uncertain,(7 or 9 years)\n|\n*Historicity uncertain\n*It has been suggested that only Sharrum-iter held the hegemony after Lugal-Anne-Mundu\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of, \"King\" of not just Mari; but, to have held the \"Kingship\" over all of Sumer\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"left\"||SKL}}\n|}\nSecond kingdom\nThe chronological order of the kings from the second kingdom era is highly uncertain; nevertheless, it is assumed that the letter of Enna-Dagan lists them in a chronological order. Many of the kings were attested through their own votive objects discovered in the city, and the dates are highly speculative.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"border=\"1\"style=\"width:100%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"25%\"|Depiction\n!width=\"25%\"|Ruler\n!width=\"25%\"| date of reign\n!width=\"25%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Early Dynastic IIIb period ()\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Second Mariote kingdom ()\n|-\n|\n|Ikun-Mari𒄣𒄿𒈠𒌷𒆠\n|Uncertain\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Ush\n*This name is inscribed on a jar in Mari\n|-\n|\n|Ikun-Shamash𒄿𒆪𒀭𒌓\n|Uncertain\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*May have ruled before the reign of Ur-Nanshe\n*temp. of Lugal-zage-si (?)\n|-\n|\n|Ikun-Shamagan𒄿𒆪𒀭𒊭𒈠𒃶\n|Uncertain,}}\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Ur-Lumma\n*His name was inscribed on a votive statue offered by his official \"Shibum\"\n|-\n|\n|Ansud\n|Uncertain,}}\n|\n*His name is inscribed on a jar (as Hanusum) sent to Mari by Mesannepada of Ur\n*The name was read by Pettinato as Anubu\n|-\n|\n|Saʿumu\n|Uncertain,}}\n|\n*temp.'' of Kun-Damu\n*He was attested in Enna-Dagan's letter as conquering many lands\n|-\n|\n|Išhtup-Išar𒅖𒁾𒄿𒊬\n|Uncertain,}}}}\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Il\n*He was attested in Enna-Dagan's letter as conquering Emar and other Eblaite vassals\n|-\n|\n|Iblul-Il𒅁𒈜𒅋\n|Uncertain,(≥40 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Igrish-Halam\n*He forced Ebla to pay tribute\n|-\n|\n|Nizi\n|Uncertain,(3 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Enentarzi\n|-\n|\n|Enna-Dagan\n|Uncertain,(3 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Irkab-Damu\n*He wrote a letter to Irkab-Damu of Ebla to assert Mari's authority\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Proto-Imperial period ()\n|-\n|\n|Ikun-Ishar𒄿𒆪𒊬\n|Uncertain,(8 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Meskigal\n*He forced Ebla to pay tribute\n|-\n|\n|Hidar\n|Uncertain\n|\n*Held the title of, \"King\"\n*temp. of Enshakushanna\n*He is attested in the archives of Ebla, which was destroyed during his reign\n|-\n|\n|Ishqi-Mari𒅖𒄄𒈠𒌷\n|Uncertain,\n|\n*temp. of Ur-Zababa\n*His name was previously read as Lamgi-Mari\n*Hypothetically the last king before the conquests of the Akkadian Empire\n|}\nThird kingdom\nThe third kingdom was ruled by two dynasties: the Shakkanakkus and the Lim. For the Shakkanakkus, the lists are incomplete and after Hanun-Dagan who ruled at the end of the Ur era c. 2008 BC (c. 1920 BC Short chronology), they become full of lacunae. Roughly 13 more Shakkanakkus succeeded Hanun-Dagan but only few are known, with the last known one reigning not too long before the reign of Yaggid-Lim who founded the Lim dynasty in c. 1830 BC, which was interrupted by Assyrian occupation in 1796–1776 BC.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"border=\"1\"style=\"width:100%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"20%\"|Depiction or inscription\n!width=\"20%\"|Ruler\n!width=\"20%\"|Succession\n!width=\"20%\"| date of reign\n!width=\"20%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Akkadian period ()\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Third Mariote kingdom ()\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"|Shakkanakku dynasty ()\n|-\n|\n|Ididish\n|\n|(60 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"Military Governor\"\n|-\n|\n|Shu-Dagan\n|Son of Ididish\n|\n|\n*Held the title of, \"Military Governor\"\n|-\n|\n|Ishma-Dagan𒅖𒈣𒀭𒁕𒃶\n|\n|(45 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"Military Governor\"\n|-\n|120px\n|Nûr-Mêr𒉌𒉿𒅈𒈨𒅕\n|Son of Ishma-Dagan\n|(5 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"Military Governor\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Gutian period ()\n|-\n|\n|Ishtup-Ilum𒅖𒁾𒀭\n|Son of Ishma-Dagan\n|(11 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"Military Governor\"\n|-\n|120px\n|Ishgum-Addu𒅖𒄣𒀭𒅎\n|\n|(8 years)\n|\n*Held the title of, \"Military Governor\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Ur III period ()\n|-\n|120px\n|Apîl-kîn 𒀀𒉈𒄀\n|Son of Ishgum-Addu\n|(35 years)\n|\n*Was designated with the royal title Lugal in a votive inscription set by his daughter\n|-\n|120px\n|Iddi-ilum𒄿𒋾𒀭\n|\n|(5 years)\n|\n*His name is also read as Iddi-Ilum; his name was inscribed on his votive statue\n|-\n|\n|Ili-Ishar𒀭𒄿𒊬\n|\n|(12 years)\n|\n*His name is inscribed on a brick\n|-\n|120px\n|Tura-Dagan𒌅𒊏𒀭𒁕𒃶\n|Son of Apîl-kîn\n|(20 years)\n|\n|-\n|120px\n|Puzur-Ishtar𒆃𒊭𒁹𒁯\n|Son of Tura-Dagan\n|(25 years)\n|\n*Used the royal title\n|-\n|\n|Hitlal-Erra\n|Son of Puzur-Ishtar\n|(7 years)\n|\n*Used the royal title\n|-\n|\n|Hanun-Dagan\n|Son of Puzur-Ishtar\n|(8 years)\n|\n*Used the royal title\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Isin-Larsa period ()\n|-\n|\n|Isi-Dagan\n|\n|\n|\n*This name is inscribed on a seal\n|-\n|\n|Ennin-Dagan\n|Son of Isi-Dagan\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Itur-(...)\n|\n|\n|\n*This name is damaged, a gap separate him from Ennin-Dagan\n|-\n|\n|Amer-Nunu\n|\n|\n|\n*This name is inscribed on a seal\n|-\n|\n|Tir-Dagan\n|Son of Itur-(...)\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Dagan-(...)\n|\n|\n|\n*This name is damaged and is the last attested Shakkanakku\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"|Lim dynasty ()\n|-\n|\n|Yaggid-Lim\n|\n|\n|\n*He may have ruled in Suprum rather than in Mari\n|-\n|120px\n|Yahdun-Lim\n|Son of Yaggid-Lim\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Sumu-Yamam\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Old Assyrian period ()\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"|Dynasty of Shamshi-Adad ()\n|-\n|\n|Yasmah-Adad\n|Son of Shamshi-Adad I\n|\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|\n|-\n|\n|Ishar-Lim\n|\n|\n|\n*He was an Assyrian official who usurped the throne for a few months between Yasmah-Adad's escape and Zimri-Lim's arrival\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"|Lim restoration ()\n|-\n|120px\n|Zimri-Lim𒍣𒅎𒊑𒇷𒅎\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Iku-Shamagan - Mari - Temple of Ninni-Zaza (retouched).jpg|Statue of Iku-Shamagan, c. 2453 BC.
