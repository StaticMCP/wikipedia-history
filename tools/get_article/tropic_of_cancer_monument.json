The second-generation marker was rebuilt on the same site in 1921. In 1923, a third-generation marker was built about 50 meters west of the original site, moving from beside the railway to the east side of the provincial highway. In 1935, the marker was reinforced and repaired, and by 1942, the fifth-generation marker was inscribed with \"North Tropic of Cancer Line Marker\" and the coordinates were removed.\nThe current building was completed in 1995. Since then, the site has expanded from a single monument to include a building complex.\nGeography\nThe monument is located along the Tropic of Cancer line which cut across Taiwan.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\nReferences"
