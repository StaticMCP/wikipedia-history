      "text": "# Timeline of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was an event in the annual tropical cyclone season in the north Atlantic Ocean. An above-average Atlantic hurricane season,|group=\"nb\"}} it was the first on record to have a major hurricane in every month from July to November.\nThe season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2008, and ended on November&nbsp;30, 2008, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Arthur, formed on May&nbsp;30, and the last, Hurricane Paloma, dissipated on November&nbsp;10. Pre-season forecasts noted a high possibility for an above average number of tropical cyclones, primarily due to lingering La Niña effects and abnormally warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic basin. Altogether, 16 of the 17 tropical cyclones observed during the season developed into tropical storms. Of these, eight became hurricanes with five intensifying further into major hurricanes.) or higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale are considered major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} With the exception of Tropical Storm Nana, every tropical cyclone during the season affected land to an extent.\nThis timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) prior to 2020 were: Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective regional time included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following the convention used in the National Hurricane Center's products. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nMay\n;May&nbsp;31\n* 0000&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT May&nbsp;30)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Arthur develops from an area of low pressure roughly  east of Belize City, Belize.\n* 0600&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Arthur attains its peak intensity with winds of  and a barometric pressure of 1004&nbsp;mbar (hPa;
