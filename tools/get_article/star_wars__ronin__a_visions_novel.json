It follows a lone, nameless wanderer only known as \"Ronin\" who travels the galaxy with his faithful droid while wielding a red lightsaber. The first chapter serves as a novelisation of the Visions episode \"The Duel\" written by Takashi Okazaki, directed by Takanobu Mizuno, and animated by Kamikaze Douga, with the remainder of the novel serving as a sequel to the episode, inspired by the works of Akira Kurosawa.\nRōnin was published on October 12, 2021.\nPremise\nTwo decades after rebellious Jedi rose up and formed the Sith order, and the ultimate downfall of the order from infighting, a former Sith warrior in a self-imposed exile wanders the galaxy while collecting red kyber crystals from Sith he has killed. After a confrontation with a bandit, Rōnin is forced to confront his old life and the endless cycle of violence he left behind.\nMarketing\nThe novel was announced six months before the release of Star Wars: Visions, advertised to let readers \"forget what [they] know about Jedi and Sith.\" According to James Waugh, an executive producer of Visions, he felt that the episode the novel is based on, \"The Duel\", stuck out as the one film that was rife for a continuation through novel form with the consultation of creative producer Jumpei Mizusaki and animation studio Kamikaze Douga. Waugh said of the story and its relation to the show: \"Visions allows us to explore Star Wars expressed in new ways. And this book is unlike anything we’ve done before.\"\nReception\nDork Side of the Force wrote: \"While the novel might be a harder sell for some, fans who enjoy the breadth of storytelling seen in the non-canon Legends books will certainly enjoy Candon’s avant-garde and at times mystical writing.\" Comic Book Resources wrote: \"While it is a bit of an adjustment to understand the new lore, it is nevertheless a fascinating read from the perspective of a man who tries to use the Dark Side for altruistic purposes.\"\nThe novel was on Publishers Weeklys science fiction bestseller list by selling 8,353 units.\nReferences"
