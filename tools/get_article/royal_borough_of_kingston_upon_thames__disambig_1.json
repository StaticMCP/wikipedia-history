The main town is Kingston upon Thames and it includes Chessington, Malden Rushett, New Malden, Surbiton and Tolworth. It is the oldest of the four royal boroughs in England. The others are Windsor and Maidenhead, the site of Windsor Castle, and the London boroughs of Greenwich, and Kensington and Chelsea. The local authority is Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council.\nThe neighbouring districts (clockwise from north) are the London boroughs of Richmond upon Thames, Wandsworth, Merton and Sutton, and the Surrey districts of Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley and Elmbridge.\nHistory\nKingston upon Thames, on the south bank of the River Thames has existed for many hundreds of years. Many Roman relics have been found in the surrounding areas. A church has stood on the site of All Saints' Church, in the centre of Kingston, for more than a thousand years. An earlier church was sacked by the Vikings in 1009 AD. Kingston was the site of the coronations of seven Anglo-Saxon monarchs:\n* Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, 900AD\n* Athelstan, 925AD\n* Edmund I, 939AD\n* Eadred, 946AD\n* Eadwig, 956AD\n* Edward the Martyr, 975AD\n* Ethelred the Unready, 979AD\nThe Coronation Stone, on which they are said to have been crowned stands outside the local council offices, the Guildhall. A coin from the reign of each of those kings is set into the base of the stone.\nAdministrative history\nThe town of Kingston upon Thames was an ancient borough, having been formally incorporated in 1441, with a long history prior to that as a royal manor dating back to Saxon times. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. Kingston was often described as a royal borough, with its right to that title being formally confirmed in 1927.\nThe old borough did not cover the whole parish of Kingston upon Thames, and separate local government arrangements were later put in place for the outlying parts of the parish. Surbiton was made an improvement commissioners district in 1855, and New Malden was made a local government district in 1866.\nSuch districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. New Malden was enlarged in 1895 to take in the neighbouring parishes of Coombe and Malden, at which point the urban district was renamed The Maldens and Coombe. Surbiton was also enlarged in 1895, absorbing the parishes of Hook and Tolworth, and again in 1933 when it absorbed Chessington. Both urban districts were incorporated to become municipal boroughs in 1936, at which point The Maldens and Coombe was renamed Malden and Coombe.\nThe modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former municipal boroughs of Kingston-upon-Thames, Malden and Coombe and Surbiton. The area was transferred from Surrey to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs. Kingston's royal borough status transferred to the enlarged borough.\nMost of the borough continued to have Surrey postal addresses until postal counties were abolished in 1996. Districts mainly use the KT postcode, except from the parts of Ham in the borough which use the TW code, and the Kingston Vale area in the north-east which has an SW15 postcode.\nDistricts in the borough\nAreas in the borough include:\n* Berrylands\n* Canbury\n* Chessington\n* Coombe\n* Hook\n* Kingston upon Thames\n* Kingston Vale\n* Malden Rushett\n* Motspur Park\n* Worcester Park (partly)\n* New Malden\n* Norbiton\n* Old Malden\n* Surbiton\n* Tolworth\nGovernance\nis the home of the Borough Council]]\nThe local authority is Kingston Council, which is based at Kingston upon Thames Guildhall.\nGreater London representation\nSince 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the South West constituency.\nUK Parliament\nThe borough includes the whole of the Kingston and Surbiton Parliamentary Constituency and part of the Richmond Park Constituency with both constituencies being created in 1997. The previous constituencies re-arranged to form these two had been essentially Conservative.\nIn 1997 the Liberal Democrats won both seats. Jenny Tonge took Richmond Park constituency and in 2005 Susan Kramer became its Liberal Democrat MP with a majority of 3,731 but she was beaten in the May 2010 election by Conservative Zac Goldsmith with a majority of 4,091. Goldsmith retained his seat at the 2015 general election, with a greatly increased majority of 23,015. Goldsmith stood as an Independent candidate in the by-election held on 1 December 2016, but was defeated by Sarah Olney, a Liberal Democrat, after the Conservative Party decided not to put forward its own candidate. Goldsmith regained the seat for the Conservatives in the 2017 general election with a significantly reduced majority of 45 votes. Sarah Olney then regained the seat during the 2019 general election.\nIn 1997 Ed Davey overturned the previous Conservative majority of more than 10,000 in Kingston and Surbiton, to win by 56 votes after three recounts. He retained the seat in 2001 with a majority of 15,676 over the Conservative candidate David Shaw. In 2005 Davey's majority was 8,961, and in the May 2010 general election he again retained the seat with a slightly reduced majority, beating the Conservative candidate Helen Whately. In the 2015 general election, Davey's seat was taken by Conservative James Berry with a majority of 2,834. Davey's was one of six Liberal Democrat losses in London and 49 overall as the party suffered its worst election results since its formation in 1988. Davey regained the seat in the 2017 general election.\nDemography\n}}\nEthnicity\nThe following table shows the ethnic group of respondents in the 2001 and 2011 census in Kingston upon Thames.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n!
