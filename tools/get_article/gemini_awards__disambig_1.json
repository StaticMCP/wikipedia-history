The Gemini Awards are analogous to the Emmy Awards given in the United States and the BAFTA Television Awards in the United Kingdom. First held in 1986 to replace the ACTRA Award, the ceremony celebrated Canadian television productions with awards in 87 categories, along with other special awards such as lifetime achievement awards. The Academy had previously presented the one-off Bijou Awards in 1981, inclusive of some television productions.\nThe awards' name was an allusion to Castor and Pollux, a mythological pair of twins; this was in reference to Canada's linguistic duality of English and French, with the Academy's separate awards presentation for French-language television production named the Gémeaux Awards. The statuette, designed by Toronto artist Scott Thornley, evoked twins through a design that essentially created two faces at the front and back of the statuette.\nIn April 2012, the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television announced that the Gemini Awards and the Genie Awards would be discontinued and replaced by a new award ceremony dedicated to all forms of Canadian media, including television, film, and digital media, dubbed the \"Canadian Screen Awards\". The inaugural Canadian Screen Awards were held on 4 March 2013.\nAward categories\nSpecial awards\n* Academy Achievement Award - general lifetime honour, inaugurated in 1996\n* Donald Brittain Award - for the best political or social documentary\n*  Canada Award - began in 1988 as the Multiculturalism Award, this is award \"honours excellence in mainstream television programming that reflects the racial and cultural diversity of Canada.\"\n* Margaret Collier Award - lifetime writing honour\n* John Drainie Award - broadcasting, not necessarily awarded every year\n* Humanitarian Award - inaugurated in 2001, recipients to date:\n** (2001) Donald Martin\n** (2002) Wendy Crewson\n** (2003) Max Keeping\n** (2004) George R.
