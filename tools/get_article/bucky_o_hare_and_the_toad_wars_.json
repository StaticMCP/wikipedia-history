(also known as Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Menace in Canada and Bucky O'Hare' in the United Kingdom) is an animated series created by Sunbow Productions, Abrams/Gentile Entertainment, Continuity Comics and the French company IDDH, co-produced by Marvel Productions and distributed by Hasbro's subsidiary Claster Television. It is based on the cult comic ''Bucky O'Hare'', and animated by AKOM.\nIt first aired in the United States in 1991, and in the United Kingdom on the BBC as part of its Children's BBC programming strand in 1992. The show was made with the intention of promoting the new Bucky O'Hare toy line. When plans for that fell through, the series was abruptly cancelled after only 13 episodes.\nCast\n* Long John Baldry as Komplex, Pit Stop Pete\n* Jay Brazeau as Toad Air Marshall, Secretary General, Mentor, Rumble Bee\n* Garry Chalk as Commander Dogstar, Al Negator, Quentin, MC, Major Bottlenose, Dan, Blackbeak, Kamikaze Kamo, General Baboon, Total Terror Toad, Digger McSquint, Wolf, Tri-Bot #1\n* Doc Harris as Toad TV, Harman, Fake Pirate\n* Simon Kendall as Security Toad #3, Bridge Toad #1\n* Sam Khouth as A.F.C.

His crew consists of:\n* Jenny (voiced by Margot Pinvidic) – The first mate and pilot, a cat from the planet Aldebaran with mysterious magical and psionic powers common to the females of her species. They include telepathy, astral projection, energy blasts, and healing. Because of the sacred precepts of Alderbaran, she keeps these powers secret from the other members of the crew, with the exception of Willy, for whom she has overt Maternal affections.\n* Bruce (voiced by Dale Wilson) – Bruiser's older brother, a Betelgeusian Berserker Baboon who served as the Righteous Indignation's engineer. He vanished into another dimension when the ship's photon accelerator malfunctioned during battle.\n* Willy DuWitt (voiced by Shane Meier) – An engineer, a preteen boy from San Francisco who enters the Aniverse via a portal between the ship's photon accelerator and his own accelerator at home. He replaced Bruce, the former engineer, who was killed (or in the franchise's terms, had \"attained oneness with the Aniverse\"). Later, Willy became stranded in the Aniverse when his parents turned off the photon accelerator back in his room. Bucky and his crew decide to keep Willy a secret from the S.P.A.C.E organization and the Toads.\n* Dead-Eye Duck (voiced by Scott McNeil) – A gunner, a four-armed former space pirate duck from Kanopis III. He is missing an eye, and is impatient and violent, preferring to let his four laser pistols do the talking for him. Unlike the comics where he has a Scottish accent, he has an American accent.\n* AFC Blinky (voiced by Sam Khouth) – An advanced AFC (\"Android\" First Class) with only one eye that uses the phrase \"Calamity and woe!\" to identify problem situations for Bucky and his crew-mates.\nThe members of the Toad Empire introduced are as follows:\n* KOMPLEX (voiced by Long John Baldry) – The undisputed ruler of the Toad Empire, this computer program was designed to run the consumerist toad culture but instead took it over and militarized it. Its name, in toad language, is an anagram for 'Feed me'.\n* Toad Air Marshall (voiced by Jay Brazeau) – One of KOMPLEX's foremost commanders, with a uniform adorned with medals and a face covered in warts.\n* Toad Borg (voiced by Richard Newman) – A large, purple cyborg second-in-command under KOMPLEX.\n* Storm Toads – The mindless toad soldiers who serve as the primary attack force for the Empire.\nCharacters that only appeared in the animated series\nAlmost all the characters listed above are both from the comic book and the cartoon. Most of the new ones that were introduced are listed below.\n* Bruiser (voiced by Dale Wilson) – Bruce's younger brother, a Betelgeusian Berserker Baboon who joins Bucky's team as space marine on the Righteous Indignation. He, like all berserker baboons, scares the toads out of their wits and loves to beat them up. He is dimwitted but well-meaning, and has great respect for Willy.\n* Commander Dogstar (voiced by Garry Chalk) – Bucky's ally, who is captain of The Indefatigable, another frigate fighting against the toads.\n* Mimi LaFloo (voiced by Margot Pinvidic) – A fox who was originally a captive of the toads. She is rescued by Bucky and goes on to command her own mammal frigate, The Screaming Mimi.\n* Frix and Frax (voiced by Terry Klassen and Scott McNeil) – The Air Marshal's two bumbling subordinates.\n* Al Negator (voiced by Garry Chalk) – A sleazasaur (bipedal crocodile) spy and mercenary frequently hired by the Air Marshal, though he is always demanding large payments in Simoleans (the Aniverse's currency) for his services. He dresses and speaks in a manner consistent to the cajun people.\nEpisode list\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%; background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#90EE90; width:20px\"| Nº\n! style=\"background:#90EE90;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#90EE90; width:140px\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#90EE90; width:135px\"| Original air date\n! style=\"background:#90EE90; width:30px\"|\n| WrittenBy = Christy Marx\n| ProdCode = 101\n| ShortSummary = Bucky O'Hare and the Righteous Indignation crew learn that the Toad Empire has taken over his homeworld Warren, and must travel there to investigate.
