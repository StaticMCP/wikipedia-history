While referring to the battle in Russian, the Borodino Field is actually more commonly applied rather than just Borodino, cf. Georgy Zhukov (\"...this division [32nd] was forced to cross the arms with the enemy on the Borodino Field...\").\nAt noon on 13 October 1941, German Junkers and Messerschmitt aircraft appeared over the Borodino Field, site of the climactic 1812 French-Russian clash. On 16 October, severe fighting broke out in the center of Borodino Field. Subsequently, the Germans managed to take the field. The Spaso-Borodinsky Monastery was burnt and the Borodino Museum suffered damage. Borodino Field was freed by the 82nd Soviet Rifle Division during the Russian counter offensive.\nReportedly, Col. Victor Polosukhin of the Red Army, whose unit was on Borodino Field, looked in on the museum shortly before it was damaged. He signed the visitors' guestbook and under \"Purpose of Visit\" wrote \"I have come to defend the battlefield\".\nSee also\n* Battle of Moscow (film)\nNotes\nSources\n*За нами Москва.
