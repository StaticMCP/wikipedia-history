In 1998, he was appointed as an assistant professor in the College of Education at Ohio State University and held that appointment until 2001.

In 2022 Howard was elected president of the American Educational Research Association.\nResearch\nHoward has published over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, and technical reports. His research focuses on investigating and addressing issues pertaining to race, culture, access, and educational opportunities for student populations that have historically been marginalized or minoritized.\nCulturally-responsive pedagogy\nIn his early research, Howard emphasized the need to better equip European American teachers to effectively instruct ethnically diverse students of color. His research has concentrated on developing strategies to enhance the effectiveness of teacher education programs, ensuring that preservice teachers possess the essential skills to work successfully with diverse student populations. He also addressed the resistance and apprehension often observed among students in teacher education programs regarding issues related to diversity and race. In 2001, he conducted research on effective teaching practices for African American students, emphasizing holistic development and cultural responsiveness. His findings revealed the applicability of these strategies to all teachers willing to critically examine assumptions, beliefs, and stereotypes. In related research, he analyzed African American males' schooling experiences using race based frameworks and observed their awareness of the impact of race and racism. Primarily focusing on urban contexts, he examined African-American elementary students' perceptions of culturally relevant teaching and revealed that students preferred caring teachers who created a community-like classroom environment and made learning fun.\nRace, education, and equity\nHaving focused his research on race, education, and equity, Howard has investigated faculty experiences, the impact of racial climate on black students, and the relevance of Critical Race Theory, highlighting systemic racism within academic institutions and emphasizing the need for equity and inclusion in education.\nOne of Howard's highly cited works determined that culturally relevant pedagogy requires critical teacher reflection to incorporate issues of equity and social justice into teaching practice. In his book, Why Race & Culture Matters in Schools, he highlighted the importance of race and culture in shaping students' school experiences, shared insights from successful schools that closed the achievement gap, and also emphasized how greater awareness of race and culture improved educational outcomes. In their book review, Vershawn Ashanti Young and Y’Shanda Young-Rivera commented, \"Howard’s text helps readers... make sense of the genesis and doggedness of these racial disparities as well as the necessity of understanding these trends. He also offers solutions in the form of steps educators can take toward becoming racially aware and culturally competent\". He also explored the chronic underperformance of African American males in U.S. schools, addressing historical, structural, educational, psychological, emotional, and cultural factors in his book, Black Male(d): Peril and Promise in the Education of African American Males and advocated for a paradigm shift in thinking, teaching, and studying Black males. Having reviewed this book, Young, and Young-Rivera highlighted, \"His meticulously crafted work provides current perspectives of Black male students, a historical overview, a discussion of the role of sports and popular culture, and the voices of Black males themselves on issues of masculinity, race, class, and success.\"\nAwards and honors\n*2017 – Fellow, American Educational Research Association\n*2017 – Mentorship Award, American Educational Research Association (AERA) Division G: Social Context of Education\n*2019 – Member, National Academy of Education\n*2022 – Research Award, AERA Social Justice\nSelected publications\nBooks\n*Black male(d): Peril and Promise in the Education of African American Males (2014) ISBN 9780807754917\n*Expanding College Access for Urban Youth (2016) ISBN 9780807774762\n*All Students Must Thrive (2019) ISBN 9781328027047\n*Why Race and Culture Matter in Schools (2019) ISBN 9780807778074\n*No More Teaching Without Positive Relationships (2020) ISBN 9780325120492\nArticles\n*Gay, G., & Howard, T.
