It was first established in 1899 as the Kingston School of Science and Art. In 1930 it was established as a separate school and has been based on its own art school campus since 1939. It was disestablished in 1970 by becoming part of Kingston Polytechnic, but a re-brand in 2017 introduced the name again. It is the oldest constituent part of Kingston University, which was established in 1992. The School of Art plays an important role in the cultural and social development of Kingston.\nThe school teaches a variety of art-related subjects, including architecture, fashion, and visual arts.
