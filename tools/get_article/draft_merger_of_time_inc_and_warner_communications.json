      "text": "# Draft:Merger of Time Inc and Warner Communications\n\nOn March 5, 1989, Time Inc and Warner Communications announced their intent to merge in a $18 billion deal to form the world's largest media conglomerate. Although, the media transaction was treated as a merger, Time Inc was actually acquiring Warner Communications. The merger faced regulatory hurdles and Paramount Communications attempted to perform a hostile takeover of Time Inc. By August 1989, Time Inc acquired majority of Warner Communications and changed its name to Time Warner. By January 10, 1990, Time Warner acquired the remainder of Warner Communications with both Steven Ross and Richard J. Munro being Co-CEOs of the company.\nBackground history\nTime Inc (also known as Time & Life Inc)\nTime Inc was founded by Henry Luce in 1922 and named after Time Magazine.\nReferences"
