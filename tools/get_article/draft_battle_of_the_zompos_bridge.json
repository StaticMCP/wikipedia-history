The bridge was in the Phrygia region of Anatolia, near Amorium, the capital of the Anatolic Theme. The decisive defeat of the Byzantine army would further undermine Byzantine authority in Anatolia and Armenia, especially as the defeat came after the shattering defeat by the emerging Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert. The defeat would allow a power vacuum in Asia Minor, one which the Turks would exploit, with Suleiman ibn Qutalmish, leading a band of Seljuk Turks, conquering vast swathes of the Central Anatolia region, especially its Central Anatolian steppe which was now vulnerable due to the crushing defeat of the Byzantines and allowed for the gradual Turkification of Anatolia.\nPrelude\nFollowing the establishment of the Duchy of Normandy, the Normans quickly assimilated to the local French culture, speaking the French language, intermixing with the French, becoming Christian, establishing feudalism, and becoming professional French knights. With such a small territory, but having a growing population, the many lords of the duchy often fought with each other for control of more fiefs, increasing the military experience of the Normans. Before long, due to the growing population, there were more lords than there were land to conquer. This caused many Normans to leave the small duchy to many foreign lands, seeking loot, land, and glory in the new places. This caused many Normans to setoff for Southern Italy. Taking advantage of the disunity of the region, these hardy Franco-Norsemen, with their martial prowess, conquered many lands, loot, and glory from the many peoples of it, like the Lombards of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua, the Byzantine Catepanate of Italy, and the Kalbids, a dynasty of Muslim Sicily. One of these Normans was a man named Roussel de Bailleul.\nRoussel de Bailleul, also known as Phrangopoulos () was a Norman adventurer, whom Anna Comnena in her Alexiad, the main source of his biography, called Ourselios (Οὐρσέλιος), also rendered as Urselius. Roussel ventured with the Apulian Normans to Italy, settled in Terra d'Otranto and served under Roger de Hauteville in Sicily. During the Conquest of Sicily, according to Geoffrey Malaterra, Roussel distinguished himself with his bravery at the Battle of Cerami, where he urged Count Roger to pursue the fleeing Arabs. Following Roussel's glorious achievements in Sicily and Southern Italy, the Norman adventurer, either in search of more glory and plunder or in exile, came to the Byzantine Empire where he became a mercenary for the Byzantine army.\nThe Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the Byzantine Empire, was in a crisis. In 1025, the Eastern Roman Empire was at its height under emperor Basil II, as during his reign, he conquered the First Bulgarian Empire, conquered lands in the Levant from the Fatimid Caliphate, conquered more lands from the Kingdom of Georgia, and his many generals launched other campaigns against the Khazars and Lombards. He left a powerful army and a massive treasury for his successors, and when he died in 1025, the Eastern Roman Empire was feared throughout Europe and the Middle East as it was the most powerful nation of that time. However, corrupt bureaucrats, weak and spoiled emperors, civil war, rebellions, court intrigue, and military defeats like Romanos III Argyros's humiliating defeat against his own client state, Mirdasid Aleppo at the Battle of Azaz (1030). Defeats like these killed many veterans and experienced soldiers of Basil II's campaigns, and helped the Byzantine state's decline. However, this didn't stop the Byzantines from conquering the Armenian Kingdom of Ani.\nBefore the expansion of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, Bulgaria and Armenia served as buffers against enemy raids. However, with the conquest of Bulgaria, Pechenegs raided the empire annually, and then by 1063, the Great Seljuk Empire under Alp Arslan. After a few years of back and forth raiding, the Byzantines, under Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes, faced the Seljuks under Alp Arslan, during the 1071 Battle of Manzikert, one of the greatest and decisive battles of Medieval Europe. Roussel was there during the campaign of Manzikert in 1071 as he led a contingent of 500 Frankish and Norman knights. However, they did not participate in the battle, as he was previously dispatched by the Emperor Romanos to Chliat to forage and plunder. The Byzantines lost the Battle of Manzikert with 6,000-12,000 soldiers killed.and they lost complete control of Anatolia to the Seljuks. The Seljuks would constantly raid and pillage the area for the next few years with Byzantine authorities having no control.\nThe constant raiding by the Turks roused the Byzantine government, under the new emperor Michael VII Doukas into action, gathering together a new army Isaac Komnenos. Issac was accompanied by his younger brother, Alexios Komnenos and a group of 3000 Franco-Norman knights. However, after Issac punished a knight, Roussel deserted the Byzantine army with his western mercenaries. Issac was then attacked by a group of Seljuks in Cappadocia, when his army was defeated and got captured. Alexios barely managed to escape with his life. Roussel then conquered some territory in the Anatolian regions of Galatia and Lycaonia and founded an independent principality in 1073, with himself as prince, following the example set by his fellow Normans in the Mezzogiorno. Roussel established his capital at Ancyra, which is now modern-day Ankara, the capital of Turkey.\nBattle\nIn order to subdue him, the Byzantine court sent an army under the Emperor's uncle, caesar John Doukas, and Nikephoros Botaneiates against Roussel. The army was also joined by John Doukas's son, Andronikos Doukas. Fixing his headquarters at Dorylaeum, the two armies met near Zompos bridge, a bridge over the Sangarios River, one of the great lines of communication between Constantinople and the central provinces in Asia Minor. Nikephoros warned John not to cross the Zompos Bridge and engage the forces of Roussel, but rather wait for reinforcements from nearby towns and cities. However John disregarded his advice, and crossed the river, basically pinning his army between Roussel's host and the Sangarios River.\nThe Byzantine right consisted of Frankish knights, the center consisted of Varangian Guard under John Doukas, while the left flank was under Andronikos. Meanwhile, Nikephoros held the reserve with the levies. The next day, Roussel had managed to convince the Frankish mercenaries on the Byzantine side to defect and join his cause. Betrayed by his Frankish mercenaries, Nikephoros was attacked on one side by the Frankish mercenaries and on the other by Roussel's host. Things were made worse when Nikephoros, who commanded the rearguard, held his troops back from fighting in the battle. Modern historians have debated exactly why he chose to withhold his troops, and whether they could have turned the tide of the battle. Nikephoro's shameful retreat of the Asiatic reserves left John and his son Andronikos alone and surrounded fighting the Franks and Normans so John was defeated and captured together with his son Andronikos. After the defeat of the forces under John, Nikephoros gathered the survivors and led them with his troops back to his estates in the Anatolic Theme. Ironically, two years earlier, Andronikos had done the same thing to Romanos at Manzikert as what Nikephoros did to himself and his father: Andronikos during the Battle of Manzikert had deserted Romanos with the reserves, leaving him to get captured. Whatever was the case, Roussel had solidified his new domain as he had won the Battle of the Zompos Bridge.\nAftermath\nReferences\nSources\n*"
