The object is set to be opened with a praying ceremony in April 2021 timed to the Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom HaShoah). The project was created by a world-renowned architect Manuel Hertz, assistant professor of architectural, urban, and territorial design at the University of Basel. He also designed a New Synagogue in Mainz, Germany.\nThe project was initiated by the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center together with the chief rabbis of Kyiv and Ukraine, Yaakov Dov Bleich (A Union of the Judaical and Religious Organisations of Ukraine) and Moshe Reuven Azman (The All-Ukrainian Jewish Congress).\nThe initiative was also supported by the Metropolitan Epiphanius of Kyiv and All Ukraine, the head of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations and the primate of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU).\nConcept\nThe art object «Place for thinking» is created as a symbolic memorial synagogue, opening and closing like a book with a special mechanism developed by the team of Ukrainian engineers. — Manuel HertzWhen closed, the building is a flat, vertical structure which is to be opened manually. It, thus, unfolds into a three-dimensional synagogue space. The process of its opening is a collective ritual performed by the members of the congregation.\nConstruction\nThe art object is erected without a foundation, on a wooden platform on the small site right after the Menorah Monument, the place where Jews traditionally gather to commemorate their relatives, who have died in Babyn Yar.\nThe construction of the «Place for thinking» as a symbolic memorial synagogue is executed on the basis of the permission No. 108/6.11.1 from 22.01.2021 issued by the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine.\nIt is made almost completely out of century-old oak wood, sourced from all over Ukraine.\nInside, the place is decorated with symbols and texts of prayers similar to the early synagogues of the Western Ukraine which were destroyed by the Nazis in the Second World War. The ceiling is painted with a myriad of symbols referencing the interior of the historic synagogues of Ukraine from the 17th and 18th centuries.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
