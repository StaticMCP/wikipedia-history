The Park was established in 1996.\nThe park is mostly within Lubusz Voivodeship, although it also extends northwards along the east bank of the Odra into West Pomeranian Voivodeship (Myślibórz County, Gmina Boleszkowice). It borders the Ujście Warty National Park, which was established in 2001 (formerly being part of the Landscape Park).\nAfter the boundary adjustment, the area of the Warta Mouth Landscape Park is now 19,496.38 hectares, of which 17,697.89 hectares lie in Lubuskie Province and 1,798.49 hectares in Zachodniopomorskie Province.\nSee also\n* Special Protection Areas in Poland\nReferences"
