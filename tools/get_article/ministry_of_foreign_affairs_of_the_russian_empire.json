According to the decree \"On the formation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\" from 1832, the Ministry included; the council, the Asian Department, the Department of External Relations, the Department of Internal Affairs and the Department of Economic and Accounting Affairs, as well as three main archives: two in Saint Petersburg and one in Moscow.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs became one of the ministries of the Council of Ministers from 1905 until its dissolution on 2 March 1917 after the February Revolution. However, remnants served as the foreign ministry of the short-lived Russian Provisional Government until October. Its role was eventually replaced by the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union in 1923.\nThe Ministry was known by the metonym \"the Chorister's Bridge,\" based on its location next to that bridge in Saint Petersburg.\nMinisters\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Name\n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"130\" |Term of office\n! width=\"130\" |Head of State\n|-\n|1\n|Alexander Vorontsov\n|September 8, 1802\n|January 16, 1804\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Alexander I\n|-\n|2\n|Adam Jerzy Czartoryski\n|January 16, 1804\n|Juny 17, 1806\n|-\n|3\n|Andreas Eberhard von Budberg\n|Juny 17, 1806\n|August 30, 1807\n|-\n|4\n|Nikolay Rumyantsev\n|February 12, 1808\n|August 1, 1814\n|-\n|5\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ioannis Kapodistrias(joint with Karl Nesselrode)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |January 31, 1816\n| rowspan=\"2\" |August 19, 1822\n|-\n|6\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |7\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Karl Nesselrode\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1814\n| rowspan=\"2\" |April 15, 1856\n|-\n|Nicholas I\n|-\n|8\n|Alexander Gorchakov\n|April 15, 1856\n|9 April 1882\n|Alexander II\n|-\n|9\n|Nicholas de Giers\n|April 9, 1882\n|January 26, 1895\n|Alexander III\n|-\n|10\n|Alexei Lobanov-Rostovsky\n|March 18, 1895\n|August 30, 1896\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Nicholas II\n|-\n|11\n|Nikolay Shishkin\n|September 1, 1896\n|January 13, 1897\n|-\n|12\n|Mikhail Muravyov\n|January 13, 1897\n|June 21, 1900\n|-\n|13\n|Vladimir Lambsdorff\n|January 6, 1901\n|May 11, 1906\n|-\n|14\n|Alexander Izvolsky\n|May 11, 1906\n|October 11, 1910\n|-\n|15\n|Sergey Sazonov\n|October 11, 1910\n|July 20, 1916\n|-\n|16\n|Boris Stürmer\n|July 20, 1916\n|November 23, 1916\n|-\n|17\n|Nikolay Pokrovsky\n|November 23, 1916\n|March 2, 1917\n|-\n|}\nProvisional Government/Russian Republic\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Minister\n!Party\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of Office\n! colspan=\"2\" |Prime Minister\n|-\n| style=\"background: ;\" |18\n|Pavel Milyukov\n|Constitutional Democratic Party\n|March 2, 1917\n|May 1, 1917\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: ;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |George Lvov\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: ;\" |19\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mikhail Tereshchenko\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Independent\n| rowspan=\"2\" |May 5, 1917\n| rowspan=\"2\" |October 29, 1917\n|-\n| style=\"background: ;\" |\n|Alexander Kerensky\n|}\nSee also\n*Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)#Russian Empire\nReferences"
