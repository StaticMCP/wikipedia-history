Taylor\n\nEdward Curtis Taylor, Jr. (August 3, 1923 – November 22, 2017) was an American chemist who designed and synthesized the chemotherapy drug pemetrexed (brand name Alimta), an inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, with grant support from the U.S. National Cancer Institute, NIH. As of 2009, royalties for this drug from Eli Lilly & Co. paid to Princeton University were sufficient to completely finance a state-of-the-art  chemistry laboratory building.

Taylor trained 187 PhD students.\nBiography\nHe was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on August 3, 1923.

Barton Hepburn Professor of Organic Chemistry, Emeritus, joined the Princeton faculty in 1954 and transferred to emeritus status in 1997.\nIn 2006 Taylor was named a Hero of Chemistry by the American Chemical Society.\nHe died on November 22, 2017.\nReferences"
