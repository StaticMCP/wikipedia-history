Its headquarters are at Shire Hall in the centre of Warwick, the county town. The council's principal functions are county roads and rights of way, social services, education and libraries, but it also provides numerous other local government services in its area. The council has been under no overall control since the 2025 election, being run by a Reform UK minority administration.\nHistory\nElected county councils were created in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over many administrative functions which had previously been performed by unelected magistrates at the quarter sessions. The cities of Birmingham and Coventry were considered large enough for their existing councils to provide county-level services, and so they were made county boroughs, independent from Warwickshire County Council. The 1888 Act also said that any urban sanitary districts which straddled county boundaries were to be placed entirely in the county which had the majority of that district's population, which saw Warwickshire cede its part of Hinckley to Leicestershire, its part of Redditch to Worcestershire, and its part of Tamworth to Staffordshire. Warwickshire County Council was elected by and provided services to the parts of the county (as thus adjusted) outside the county boroughs of Birmingham and Coventry. The county council's area was termed the administrative county.\n: The 1758 courthouse, facing Northgate Street.]]\nThe first elections to the county council were held in January 1889 and it formally came into being on 1 April 1889. On that day it held its first official meeting at the Shire Hall in Warwick, the courthouse (built 1758) which had served as the meeting place for the quarter sessions which preceded the county council. John Dugdale, the Conservative MP for Nuneaton, was appointed the first chairman of the council.\nThe administrative county ceded Aston Manor and Erdington to Birmingham in 1911. Solihull was made a county borough in 1964.\nThe administrative county was reformed in 1974 to become a non-metropolitan county, at which point it also ceded Sutton Coldfield, Hockley Heath and much of the Meriden Rural District to the new West Midlands metropolitan county, which also covered the already independent county boroughs of Birmingham, Coventry and Solihull, alongside other territory from Staffordshire and Worcestershire. The lower tier of local government was reorganised as part of the same reforms. Previously it had comprised numerous boroughs, urban districts and rural districts; they were reorganised into five non-metropolitan districts.\nControversies\nThe council became the centre of a national controversy following comments made by three Conservative councillors during a committee meeting in January 2024 discussing spending on Special Educational Needs (SEND). Following media attention, the council published a statement and apologies from the three councillors. A subsequent investigation cleared all three councillors of having breached the council's code of conduct, but found that some of the language used by two of the councillors had not been respectful. The investigation recommended further training for councillors on how to \"engage fully in debate at scrutiny and other committee meetings whilst ensuring that the language used is respectful, courteous, and sensitive to the matter concerned.\"\nGovernance\nWarwickshire County Council provides county-level services. District-level services are provided by the five district councils:\n*North Warwickshire Borough Council\n*Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council\n*Rugby Borough Council\n*Stratford-on-Avon District Council\n*Warwick District Council\nMuch of the county is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.\nPolitical control\nThe council has been under no overall control since the 2025 election. Reform UK was the largest party following that election, and they subsequently formed a minority administration to run the council.\nPolitical control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2|Party in control || Years\n|-\n|  ||1974–1977\n|-\n|  ||1977–1981\n|-\n|  ||1981–1989\n|-\n|  ||1989–1993\n|-\n|  ||1993–2009\n|-\n|  ||2009–2013\n|-\n|  ||2013–2017\n|-\n|  ||2017–2025\n|-\n|  ||2025–present\n|}\nLeadership\nThe leaders of the council since 1967 have been:\n{| class=wikitable\n!

Elections are held every four years.\nPremises\nThe county council is based at the Shire Hall in Market Place, Warwick, a complex of buildings built over many years. The oldest part was a courthouse built in 1758 facing Northgate Street. As the county council's functions grew it built new offices in 1929–32 on the adjoining site of the former county jail, retaining the jail's 1783 façade to Northgate Street. A large extension completed in 1958 included a new council chamber, and a further extension in 1966 created a new frontage and main entrance for the building facing Market Place.\nNotes\nReferences"
