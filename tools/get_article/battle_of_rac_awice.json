It was fought on 4 April 1794 near the village of Racławice in Lesser Poland.\nThe battle site is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated on 1 May 2004.  Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. In the original text of Poland Is Not Yet Lost, the battle is mentioned in the last verse.\nBattle\nGeneral Denisov, with 2,500 troops, had planned to attack the Poles from the south, while Tormasov's force of 3,000 troops blocked Kościuszko. Encountering Tormasov's force first, Kościuszko occupied a nearby hill, General Antoni Madalinski on his right and General Józef Zajączek on his left.  Not waiting any longer, Tormasov attacked the hill by 15:00, setting up their cannon.  Kosciuszko inspired his peasant brigade with shouts of \"My boys, take that artillery! For God, and the Fatherland! Go forward with faith!\"\nThe first group of serfs captured 3 twelve-pound cannons and the second wave captured eight more cannons.  Moving to his left flank, Kosciuszko led a bayonet charge when the Russians fled, followed closely by the scythemen.\nThe Polish Order of Battle was as follows:\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background: #ececec;\"\n! unit\n! superior\n! soldiers\n|-\n| 2 battalions\n| Infantry Regiment of Czapski\n| 400 bayonets\n|-\n| 2 battalions\n| Infantry Regiment of Wodzicki\n| 400 bayonets\n|-\n| 2 battalions\n| Infantry Regiment of Ożarowski\n| 400 bayonets\n|-\n| 1 battalion\n| Infantry Regiment of Raczyński\n| 200 bayonets\n|-\n| 10 squadrons of cavalry\n| under Antoni Madaliński\n| 400 sabres\n|-\n| 10 squadrons of cavalry\n| under Magnet\n| 400 sabres\n|-\n| 4 cavalry squadrons\n| under Biernacki\n| 160 sabres\n|-\n| 2 auxiliary cavalry squadrons\n| Duchy of Württemberg\n| 80 sabres\n|-\n! colspan=\"14\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9; text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;2440 men altogether\n|-\n|}\nIn addition, Lesser Poland fielded approximately 2,000 peasants armed with war scythes and pikes, known as kosynierzy, as well as 11 cannons. The outcome of the battle was a tactical Polish victory, with Kościuszko defeating the numerically inferior enemy. However, his forces were too small to undertake a successful pursuit, and the Corps of General Denisov evaded destruction and continued to operate in Lesser Poland.\nAftermath\nKościuszko marched back to Kraków and made camp in the fields of Bosutow.\nAfter the battle, Kościuszko paraded before his troops in a sukmana, a traditional attire worn in Lesser Poland, in honour of the bravery of the peasants, whose charge ensured the quick capture of the Russian artillery. He also praised Wojciech Bartosz Głowacki, a peasant who was the first to reach the cannons (he is visible in Matejko's painting, above). He smothered its fuse with his hat before it fired. In return he received an award of nobility, his freedom, a tract of land and made standard-bearer.\nThe victory was subsequently promoted in Poland as a major success and helped in spreading the Kościuszko Uprising to other areas of Poland and instigating the Warsaw Uprising of 1794. Also, the participation of peasant volunteers was seen by many as the starting point of the Polish peasantry's political evolution from serfs to equally entitled citizens of the nation.\nLegacy\nin Wrocław]]\nMilitary\nThe red cap worn by Kościuszko's soldiers and the homemade war scythes were later featured on the emblem of the RAF's 303 (Polish) Fighter Squadron, which took part in the Battle of Britain.\nThe Battle of Racławice is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \"RACŁAWICE 4 IV 1794\".\nArt\nJan Matejko's painting, Kościuszko at Racławice, depicts the battle and is on display at the Sukiennice Museum, a branch of the National Museum in Kraków. A monumental panorama (measuring 15 x 114 meters) known as the Racławice Panorama was completed a century after the battle in 1894, and is currently on display in Wrocław as a branch of the National Museum in Wrocław.\nSee also\n* The Racławice Panorama\nReferences"
