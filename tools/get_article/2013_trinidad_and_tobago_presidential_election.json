As Carmona was the only candidate nominated on election day, a vote did not take place and he was declared elected unopposed. He was sworn in to office on 18 March 2013 as the 5th President of Trinidad and Tobago.\nElectoral method\nThe President of Trinidad and Tobago is indirectly elected for a 5-year term by an electoral college comprising all 41 members of the House of Representatives and all 31 members of the Senate.\nTo win the election a candidate must gain a plurality of votes cast, whereby a quorum comprising the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 10 Senators and 12 other member of the House of Representatives must be met for the election to be considered valid. If only one candidate should be nominated to run in the election, he or she shall be considered to have been elected president without the need for a vote to take place.\nCandidates\nNominated by the Government\n*Anthony Carmona, Judge of the International Criminal Court\nResults\nResults of the election held on 15 February 2013\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
