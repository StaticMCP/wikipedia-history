The anthology had been expected to be published in 2021, but was released at the end of 2024. According to the SFWA press release, \"this volume represents a change in strategy for the organization that will result in a speed-up of our processes. This and future volumes will be edited by SFWA's own Publications Committee\".\nDelay\nMost Nebula Awards Showcases follow the pattern of being published the year following the award period (i.e. Nebula Awards Showcase 2008 (#42) covers the 2007 Nebula Awards and was published in 2008) with few exceptions.\nSFWA expected to release volume 56 by the end of 2021, but the volume was delayed; announced as \"nearing completion\" on February 17, 2024. The official release was confirmed on December 18, 2024.\nContents\n* Introduction by Cat Rambo\nI.
