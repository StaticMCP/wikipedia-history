      "text": "# Profit taking\n\nIn finance, profit taking (or taking profits) is the practice of selling an asset, mostly shares, when the asset has risen in price. This allows investors to convert the increase of an asset's market value into cash.\nProfit taking by a number of investors normally causes the price of the asset in question to fall temporarily. Nevertheless, the occasion of profit taking itself indicates an upward market trend.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profittaking.asp Definition from Investopedia]\n* [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/profit-taking.html Definition from BusinessDictionary]\n* [http://www.investorwords.com/3888/profit_taking.html Definition from InvestorWords]\n* [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Profit+Taking Definitions from TheFreeDictionary]\n* [https://fxshop24.net/the-power-of-take-profit-in-trading/ Definitions from FxShop24]"
