The review criticized the song's lack of coherence, stating that it \"makes no more sense in context, ping-ponging between uninspired synth arpeggios, than it does on paper.\"\nPersonnel\n* Sia – songwriting, vocals\n* Chaka Khan – songwriting, vocals\n* Greg Kurstin – songwriting, production, bass, mellotron, drums, engineering, keyboards, percussion, mixing, synthesizer\n* Jackie Wongso – marketing\n* Julian Burg – additional engineering\n* Matt Tuggle – additional engineering\n* Craig Kallman – A& R directing\n* Chris Gehringer – mastering\nTrack listing\nDigital download – album track\n#\"Immortal Queen\" (feat.
