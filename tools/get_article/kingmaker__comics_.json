His standard agreement involves delivering any wish to an applicant in exchange for a favour to be named later. His network of favours has given him vast financial reserves, business agreements with powerful individuals, and a personal trove of high-tech weaponry for his personal defence. He has a history with Emma Frost as a result of her rejection of his bid for membership in the Hellfire Club.\nWhen New X-Men member Hellion is denied a family inheritance, he investigates their financial history, eventually discovering their involvement with the Kingmaker. Hellion and his teammates are contacted by the Kingmaker, who offers their standard contract. In exchange for their deepest wishes, the Hellions are tasked with stealing a device for their benefactor. Unbeknownst to the Hellions, the device is a biological weapon that the Kingmaker intended to give to Doctor Octopus. The Hellions retrieve the device and turn on Kingmaker. After several losing battles, the Hellions defeat Kingmaker, who is arrested. Kingmaker is later released by Emma Frost, who convinces him to leave her students alone under the threat of being sent back to jail.\nBullseye's Father\nThe second version is the father of Bullseye and appeared during the Dark Reign storyline. While Bullseye is fighting an army of Hawkeyes, he is captured by Solo and brought before Kingmaker. The Kingmaker prepares to trade his old burned husk of a body for Bullseye's by placing his brain in his son's body. However, Bullseye's bones are laced with adamantium, which is impossible to cut through and blocks Kingmaker's neural inhibitor. Bullseye fights his way through Solo to get to his father, who he kills.\nPryor Cashman\nThe third version is Pryor Cashman, a \"demon entity\" who feeds on memories and is able to view and manipulate them.
