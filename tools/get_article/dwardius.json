      "text": "# Dwardius\n\nDwardius is an extinct genus of cardabiodontid sharks which existed during the Cretaceous period in what is now Australia, England, France, and India. It was described by Mikael Siverson in 1999, as a new genus for the species Cretalamna woodwardi, which had been described by J. Hermann in 1977. Another species, D. siversoni, was described from the middle Albian of northeastern France by V.I. Zhelezko in 2000; the species epithet honours the author of the genus. A new species, D. sudindicus, was described by Charlie J. Underwood, Anjali Goswami, G.V.R. Prasad, Omkar Verma, and John J. Flynn in 2011, from the Cretaceous Karai Formation of India.\nSpecies\n* Dwardius woodwardi (Hermann, 1977)\n* Dwardius siversoni Zhelezko, 2000\n* Dwardius sudindicus Underwood et al., 2011\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://paleobiodb.org/classic/checkTaxonInfo?taxon_no=186565 Dwardius] at the Paleobiology Database\n* [http://www.helsinki.fi/~mhaaramo/metazoa/deuterostoma/chordata/chondrichthyes/elasmobranchii/lamniformes/lamniformes.html www.helsinki.fi]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/somniosus/Albian_Dwardius.htm skynet.be]"
