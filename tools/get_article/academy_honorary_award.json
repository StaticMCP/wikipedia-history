Since 2009, it has been presented at the separate annual Governors Awards rather than at the regular Academy Awards ceremony. The Honorary Award celebrates motion picture achievements that are not covered by existing Academy Awards, although prior winners of competitive Academy Awards are not excluded from receiving the award.\nUnless otherwise specified, Honorary Award recipients receive the same gold Oscar statuettes received by winners of the competitive Academy Awards.  Unlike the Special Achievement Award instituted in 1972, those on whom the Academy confers its Honorary Award do not have to meet \"the Academy's eligibility year and deadline requirements\".\nLike the Special Achievement Award, the Special Award and Honorary Award have been used to reward significant achievements of the year that did not fit in existing categories, subsequently leading the Academy to establish several new categories, and to honor exceptional career achievements, contributions to the motion picture industry, and service to the Academy.\nRecipients\nwon this award twice in 1927/28 and 1971.]]\nholds the record for most Oscar nominations (59) and wins (22).
