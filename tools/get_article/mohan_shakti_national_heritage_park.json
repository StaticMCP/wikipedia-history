It is about 40 kilometers south of Shimla, about 15 kilometers north of Solan, and 85 kilometers northeast of Chandigarh. Spread over 40 acres of land, it was founded by Kapil Mohan – a retired Brigadier of the Indian Army, a Padma Shree awardee of India and an heir to the liquor-manufacturing family business Mohan Meakin Limited of Solan and Ghaziabad. The site is about 10 kilometers from the Solan \"Old Monk\" brewery operations of Mohan Meakin. The heritage complex costs around Rs 100 crore to build.\nIt is set on a hillside with a view of Ashwini Khad valley and the foothills of the Himalayas. The complex includes an expansive garden and park with a large Hindu temple at the top. The temple has two large \"Om\" symbols in the front, and Surya in a seven-horse chariot on the top. The temple features artwork of Hindu legends from the Vedas, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Motifs of Indian culture such as elephant, lion, tiger, peacock and river dolphin statues also dot the heritage park. The site includes life-size statues of famed Vedic rishis along with Hindu mythical figures and deities.\nThe park was inaugurated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Dec 01, 2002.\nGallery\nFile:Shiv statue on Mohan Shakti Heritage Park.jpg|Shiva\nFile:Mohan National Heritage Park, solan.JPG|Narasimha legend\nFile:Statue of mythology character in Mohan Shakti Heritage Park.jpg|A rishi (sage-poet)\nFile:A lady statue in corridor of Mohan Shakti Heritage Park.jpg|A Devi\nFile:Old man musician in corridor of Mohan Shakti Heritage Park.jpg|A singer–musician\nFile:Mountain view of Mohan Shakti Heritage Park.jpg|Mountain view from Mohan Shakti Heritage park\nFile:Shivling in Mohan Shakti Heritage Park.jpg|Shivling in the shrine\nFile:Statue of jalpari on corridor Mohan Shakti Heritage Park.jpg|The Jalpari (water-fairy) legend\nReferences"
