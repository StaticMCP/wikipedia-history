In 1144 AH (1731 AD) a Brahui force under Khan of Kalat Mir Abdullah Khan Ahmadzai who claimed himself \"Falcon of Mountains\" in open contravention of the terms of the peace, invaded the land of Káchi and plundered that part of the country. To counter the attack Mian Noor Mohammad Kalhoro himself marched out and encamped at Ládkanah. From there he dispatched some chiefs to fight with Khan of Kalat Mir Abdullah Khan Ahmadzai. Mir Abdullah was eventually slain in a fight with the Kalhoras at Jandrihar near Sanni in Kachhi.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle of Jandari, Khanate weas not able to fight further. The Kalhoro army could have taken Kalat, but either this step was purposely avoided or occupying a dry and barren hilly terrain was not thought useful. Mian Noor Muhammad Khan, as per his general political traditions, established relationships with the Ahmadzais. Therefore, in the year 1146 AH (1732–33 CE) Mian Noor Muhammad Khan's elder son, Muhammad Muradyab Khan, was married to the daughter of the cousin of Abdullah Khan, Mir Murad Ali.\nDuring the reign of Mir Abdullah's successor, Mir Muhabbat, Nadir Shah rose to power; and the Ahmadzai ruler obtained through him in 1740 the cession of Kachhi, in compensation for the blood of Mir Abdullah and the men who had fallen with him.\nReferences"
