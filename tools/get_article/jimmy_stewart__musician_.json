He is best known for his association with jazz guitarist Gábor Szabó, but he has been extensively involved in many genres of music as an arranger, conductor, producer, orchestrator, musical director, and educator. Stewart has appeared on over 1,200 recordings.\nEarly life and education\nStewart was born on September 8, 1937, in San Francisco, California. At the age of four, he commenced piano lessons, switching to guitar when he was eight. He sneaked out of the family house late at night to go to clubs. A professional by age 15, he received the opportunity to play with Earl Hines when he was 16.\nAfter working in Lake Tahoe, he studied at the College of San Mateo, earning a degree in 1957, and the next year married Janet McCoy. In 1960 he attended the Chicago School of Music, where he was a student of classical guitarist and teacher, Richard Pick. He received a certificate in composition and modern arranging from the Berklee School of Music in 1964. He also engaged in private studies with Albert Harris (composition, film scoring and orchestration), Jack Lee (conducting), George M. Smith (classical guitar and studio guitar), Paul Miller (fretted instruments), and Bud Young (dance band arrangements, harmony, and composition from 16th–18th centuries).\nUS Army\nFrom 1958 to 1960, Stewart served in the US Army, where he became a broadcast specialist. He recorded the 1959 Playboy Jazz Festival for the Armed Forces radio station, was musical director for the weekly radio show, At Ease Show, and produced Parade Rest for St. Louis television. He also played guitar on variety shows and produced radio programs.\nLos Angeles\nFollowing his time with Szabó, Stewart moved to Los Angeles, where he became involved in several different areas of music. He recorded his album, The Touch, about which guitarist Jim Ferguson wrote in Guitar Player, \"Throughout, Jimmy displays his imagination, depicting a fictional encounter between Szabo and Carlos Santana, as well as paying tribute to influences Jimmy Raney, Jim Hall and Wes Montgomery. In addition to playing jazz, Stewart played heavy metal next to Tommy Bolin at a music industry trade show in Los Angeles.\nStudio musician\nAs a studio musician, Stewart has played on over 1,200 sessions. He was one of the first studio guitarists to introduce the rock guitar to soundtracks and commercials. His versatility made him in demand for many decades. Chris Colombi, Jr. wrote of Stewart in 1986, \"His playing and tastes run back to the blues, Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt, and forward to Al DiMeola, Tony Purrone and Jim Hall.\"\nIn Encyclopedia of Jazz in the Seventies, music critic Leonard Feather said that Stewart \"attributes his inspiration to a range of influences, from Segovia and Bartók to Charlie Christian and Laurindo Almeida.\"\nSince settling in Los Angeles, Stewart worked as musical director for Lainie Kazan (arranger and conductor on tours from 1972 to 1979) and as an arranger for tours of Andy Williams. He worked with Gary Crosby, Chita Rivera, and Rod McKuen; arranged for John Gary, Lou Gottlieb, Alex Hassel, Chad Mitchell and Tonilee Scott; and coached Linda Ronstadt, Juice Newton, and Lee Ritenour.\nTV, film, stage\nStewart's guitar playing has appeared in such movies as Paint Your Wagon, Topaz, Some Kind of Nut, Nice Dreams, Minus One, and Chain of Command. In television, his work has appeared on music for Ironside, The Burt Bacharach Special, The Mike Douglas Show, and The Tonight Show. He also played music for stage shows, such as How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, Half a Sixpence, 110 in the Shade, No Strings, Funny Girl, ''Here's Love, Bye Bye Birdie, Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story, The Boy-Friend, and Man of La Mancha.\nEducator and author\nStewart has written over twenty books, including Ear Training for the Guitarist, Sight Reading for the Guitarist, A Tribute to Classical Guitar, The Complete Jazz Guitarist, Rock Guitar, and Heavy Metal Guitar''.\nStewart was founder of the guitar program at Dick Grove Music Workshops and was chairman of the Music Department at the Audio/Video Institute of Technology in Hollywood, conducting master classes in record production and music recording history.
