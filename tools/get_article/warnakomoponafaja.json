When the village was founded, a fire was made near the hole of a hare, and suddenly the hare escaped through the flames. The estimated population of the village in 1904 was about 80 people, and there were many fruit trees in the village. As of 2014, the village is not listed on the settlements in Boven Saramacca, and has probably been abandoned.\nNearby towns and villages include Makajapingo (2.0&nbsp;nm), Tabrikiekondre (5.1&nbsp;nm), La Valere (16.6&nbsp;nm), Baikutu (17.4&nbsp;nm), Stonkoe (1.4&nbsp;nm) and Mofina (1.0&nbsp;nm).\nReferences"
