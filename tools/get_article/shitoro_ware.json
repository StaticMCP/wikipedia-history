During the 15th century Tenshou era, the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu recommended the ceramic ware being made in the area as a \"specialty good\". Shitoro ware was admired by Kobori Enshu and others who practiced the tea ceremony. Shitoro ware pots are moisture resistant and are strong and sturdy.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.shizuoka-kougei.jp/019.html"
