The series was aired for 92 episodes, split into two seasons, from 29 January to 3 May 2017 on Anhui TV and Beijing TV.\nThe series has been made with a budget of around 260 million yuan ($38.68 million), and shot in 70 sets, with massive digital backup. It received a positive response from the audience for its historical accuracy and storyline. It has a score of 8.3 out of 10 on Tencent and 6.7 on Douban.\nSynopsis\nThe story is about Shen Zhenzhu, the concubine of Emperor Daizong while he was the Prince Li Chu of Guangping. Zhenzhu was an ordinary girl from Jiangnan. Kind-hearted and noble, she stayed behind during the An Lushan Rebellion in order to show solidarity with the Tang citizens. Although she was captured by the opposing forces, she never gave up protecting her people, and remained loyal to her husband despite the pursuit of Moyan Chou, a Uyghur general, and An Qingxu, the son of An Lushan.\nAfter peace was restored, Li Chu was determined to relocate her and bring her back to the palace, ignoring the advice of his fellow officials. However, Zhenzhu refused to return to the palace with him, as she knew her time as a hostage would jeopardize his chances of succeeding the throne. She chose to disappear from the royal court and live among the people she spent her whole life protecting.\nCast\nMain\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12%\"|Actor !! style=\"width:17%\"|Character !!
