They also received criticism for lacking actual actor couples in the Worst Screen Combo category and its inclusion for performances by Ben Affleck in the critically acclaimed film The Last Duel and Jared Leto in House of Gucci for Worst Supporting Actor; both performances were nominated, with Leto winning the award. Conversely, Leto received nominations for Best Supporting Actor from the Critics Choice Association and Screen Actors Guild. A reviewer for the website The Avocado'' was particularly critical of Affleck's nomination, stating that he \"gave one of the year's best performances\" in The Last Duel, writing: \"Was it silly? Of course it was and it was perfect for the role.\" The same reviewer also criticized Leto's nomination, writing that he \"doesn't deserve to be on here either\" and arguing that he was \"perfectly cast as a pathetic little moron that's in over his head\" in House of Gucci.\nWorst Performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 Movie\nThis year introduced a special category, \"Worst Performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 Movie\", which consisted of all eight films Willis appeared in throughout 2021. On March 30, 2022, Willis's family announced he was retiring from acting following an aphasia diagnosis, which resulted in the category incurring criticism as being insensitive. The Razzies originally stood by their decision, tweeting \"perhaps this explains why he wanted to go out with a bang in 2021. Our best wishes to Bruce and family\". They later rescinded the award in the wake of public backlash, stating \"If someone's medical condition is a factor in their decision making and/or their performance, we acknowledge that it is not appropriate to give them a Razzie\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
