He attended school in Chesterfield, Derbyshire (1967–73) and Liverpool University (1973–76). He then undertook a post-graduate teaching course at Crewe & Alsager College (1976–77), and lastly a post-graduate librarianship at Liverpool Polytechnic (1979–80). He was an oral historian at the Sound Archive of the Imperial War Museum in London from 1981 to January 2020.\nWorks\nHart has written mainly on British participation in the First World War. His books include; The Somme, Jutland 1916, Bloody April on the air war in 1917, Passchendaele, Aces Falling (on the air war in 1918), 1918 A Very British Victory and Gallipoli. He is a regular contributor to Britain at War magazine.\nHart's books contain references to the eyewitness accounts of the participants, many of whom he has interviewed.}}\nIn recent years, Hart has been a frequent visitor to the Gallipoli peninsula, accompanying group tours of the battlefields. In so doing, he made the acquaintance of Australian historian Mat McLachlan.\nAfter retiring from the Imperial War Museum, Hart launched the \"Pete & Gary's Military History\" podcast. The debut podcast was made available in February 2020. His friend Gary Bain serves as a Straight man foil to the irreverent Hart persona. The blend of historic analysis coupled with humour has its critics but reviews are generally favourable. The podcast is backed by McLachlan, and is a Living History production. }}\nHart's most recent book on Gallipoli was published by McLachlan's Living History production. In 2022, he published Laugh or Cry.\nHart has also made contributions to the \"History Hit\" podcast series chaired by Dan Snow.\nHart has given talks at symposiums, alongside the likes of Taff Gillingham, Spencer Jones, Alexandra Churchill, Rob Thompson and Richard Van Emden. His expertise has seen him engaged by the Great War Group and regional associations of the Western Front Association to give presentations at their meetings.\nPublished works\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nNotes and citations\n;Notes\n;Citations\nExternal links\n*\n*"
