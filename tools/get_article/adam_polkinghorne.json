He is more of a bowling all-rounder, and his fast-medium deliveries are difficult to score from. As a batsman he is a useful left-handed hitter who likes to slog down the order. As of 2006 he has so far yet to be able to transfer his exploits for club side South Hobart/Sandy Bay Sharks, where his club efforts have seen him named club player of the year four times."
