Although analysts had said he has above average athletic ability for a man his size, can play both end spots in a 3–4 or 4–3, is large enough to play defensive tackle in 4–3, and could become a quality pass rusher in the NFL, he was also seen as a developmental project who needs improvement in his power, and has inconsistent balance in contact.\nWard was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine and also participated at Illinois' Pro Day and even improved on the majority of his combine numbers.
