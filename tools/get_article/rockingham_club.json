Rockingham also backed the claim for American independence and in 1782, when he was appointed prime minister for a second time, upon taking office he acknowledged the independence of the United States, initiating an end to British involvement in the American Revolutionary War.\nMembers included:\n* John Carr (architect)\n* Michael McQueeney\nThe Yale University 'Rockingham Club' (1981-1986)\nThe Yale Rockingham Club was a Yale University student club founded by British-born Yale undergraduate Lord Nicholas Hervey, a descendant of Lord Rockingham, as a social club for Yale student descendants of royalty or aristocracy, a requirement later modified to allow membership by offspring of the \"super-wealthy.\"\nThe club survived five years (1981–1986) and the clubhouse (privately purchased by a small group of members including Hervey and Salem Chalabi) was an off-campus historic clapboard building housing a full-length portrait of Hervey (who took six years to graduate), as well as a ballroom and chandelier, and where parties were held.\nSee also\n*List of Yale University student organizations\n*Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham\nSources\n*NY Times Article on Rockingham Club at Yale\n*February 1986 Interview Magazine Article on Rockingham Club\n*Iovine, Juli V.
