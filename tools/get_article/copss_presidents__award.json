The COPSS Presidents' Award is generally regarded as one of the highest honours in the field of statistics, along with the International Prize in Statistics.\nSpecifically, eligible candidates either i) will be under age 41 throughout the award calendar year, or ii) will be under age 46 throughout the award calendar year and will have received a terminal statistically-related degree no more than 12 years prior to that year. For example, an individual eligible for 2016 nomination under (ii) must have been born in 1971 or later with terminal statistically-related degree dated 2004 or later. Prior to 2005 the award was given to a statistician not yet having reached their 41st birthday during the calendar year of the award.\nThe COPSS Presidents' Award is awarded by the five sponsoring statistical societies:\n* The American Statistical Association (ASA)\n* The Statistical Society of Canada (SSC)\n* The Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS)\n* The Eastern North American Region of the International Biometric Society (ENAR)\n* The Western North American Region of the International Biometric Society (WNAR)\nThe presentation of the award takes place at the annual Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM).\nWinners of the COPSS Presidents' Award\n* 1981: Peter J.
