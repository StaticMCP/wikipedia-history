      "text": "# Grey County, Queensland\n\nGrey County is a cadastral division of Queensland and a county of the South Gregory District of remote western Queensland.  The county is divided into civil  parishes.\nThe county came into existence in the 19th century, but on 8 March 1901, when the Governor of Queensland issued a proclamation legally dividing Queensland into counties under the Land Act 1897.\nLike all counties in Queensland, it is a non-functional administrative unit, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles. From 30 November 2015, the government no longer referenced counties and parishes in land information systems however the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying retains a record for historical purposes.\nClimate\nThe temperature may range from maximums in summer that approach 50&nbsp;°C to minimums in winter  that are below 0&nbsp;°C. The annual rainfall has recorded falls between a low of 86&nbsp;mm and a high of 988&nbsp;mm.\nReferences"
