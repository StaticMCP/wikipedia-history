It promotes historical preservation, as well as the study of the archaeology and history of the west of Ireland.\nAs of January 2002, the Society had published 53 consecutive volumes of the Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society since the first was published in 2000. Back issues of JGAHS are available through the academic database JSTOR.\nThe Society also runs a lecture series in Galway City and is involved in lobbying national and local authorities in relation to heritage matters relating to the City and County of Galway. In 1999, the society complained that renovation work carried out on Ballindooley Castle, was \"an appalling intrusion on the landscape, and one step too far\". That year, it also convinced the Galway Corporation to reconsider its decision allowing the demolition of Prairie House, a seaside boarding house built in the late 18th or early 19th century.\nSee also\n* List of historical societies in Ireland\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* By Time Everything is Revealed: The Galway Archaeological and Historical Society, 1900–1999, Joe O'Halloran, pp.&nbsp;162–182, Journal of the G.A. & H.S., Volume 53, 2001.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gahs.ie/ Cumann Seandálaíochta agus Staire na Gaillimhe] – Official site"
