A year later, a PPS WRN wing in Poland was established, created by activists like Michał Tabaczar from Warsaw, or a Kraków group concentrated around the newspaper Naprzód (Leszek Florczyk). The parties merged on 2 July 1993, with Władysław Panek becoming the General Secretary of PPS WRN. The party had Districted Workers' Committees in Warsaw and Kraków and had a newspaper, Naprzód Robotniczy. In the spring of 1994, the party was reinforced by a group of secessionists from the PPS, opposed to a merger with the group led by Edward Osóbka-Morawski (for example vicechair of the CKW Bronisław Jędrzejowski). In the 1995 presidential election, it endorsed Tadeusz Zieliński.\nReferences"
