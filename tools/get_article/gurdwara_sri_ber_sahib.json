This gurdwara is the historical place related to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first Guru of Sikhs.\nHistory\nThis historic site is of great importance to Sikhism, as it is said to be the place where the First Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, spent 14 years of his life. The place derives its name from a Ber tree (Ziziphus jujuba) said to have been planted by Guru Nanak himself, under which he first uttered the Mul Mantar or the \"Sacred Word or Revelation\" of Sikhism.\nArchitecture\nThe present building of Gurdwara Sri Ber Sahib was built by Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala. The cornerstone was laid by Bhai Arjan Singh of Bagarian on 25 February 1937, and the gurdwara was on completion dedicated by Lieutenant General Maharaja Yadavindra Singh of Patiala on 26 January 1941. Standing on a high plinth and entered through a portico, supported by octagonal columns, and a small entrance gallery is the high ceilinged, marble floored hall. At the far end, marked off by a high archway decorated with floral designs in stucco, is the sanctum sanctorum, where the Guru Granth Sahib is seated on a white marble canopied throne. Besides the daily services and observance of important Sikh anniversaries, a popular fair takes place on each birthday of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.\nSee also\n*Sultanpur Lodhi\n*Gurdwara Baba Bakala Sahib\nReferences"
