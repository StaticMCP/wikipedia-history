It belongs to the Parish of Saint Stanislaus Kostka - Transfiguration, together with Transfiguration Catholic Church, .\nHistory\nOne of the goals of building the church in 1872 was to provide a house of prayer and worship to local farmers living far away from St. Mary's Church that was located in the neighboring Winfield section of Woodside, Queens. Its original building was formerly located at 64-25 Perry Avenue in Maspeth, Queens. Its current pastor is Rev. Msgr. Joseph P.
