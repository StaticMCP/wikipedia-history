Members of NATO on its eastern flank, who in November 2015 convened into a group called the Bucharest Nine, felt threatened by a revanchist Russia, and he said he will raise the issue with Angela Merkel, who had \"previously blocked efforts to place NATO troops in central and eastern Europe, saying it might strain relations with Russia.\"\nOutcomes\n* Strengthening the alliance's military presence in the east, with four battalions in Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on a rotational basis – to be in place by 2017. This became known as NATO Enhanced Forward Presence.\n* Allies declared Initial Operational Capability of NATO's Ballistic Missile Defence to counter threats posed by Iran and further afield, North Korea, to the European continent.\n* Pledge to strengthen individual nations' and collective cyber defences, and recognise cyberspace as a new operational domain.\n* Commitment to improve member state resilience.\n* Start training and capacity building inside Iraq.\n* NATO Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS surveillance planes to provide information and intelligence to the Global Coalition to counter ISIL from Turkish and international airspace.\n* Agreed to an expanded maritime presence in the Mediterranean Sea to cope with the European migrant crisis and human trafficking.\n* Continue the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan beyond 2016, confirmed funding commitments for Afghan forces until 2020.\n* NATO-Ukraine Commission reviewed the security situation in Ukraine, endorsed government plans for reform, agreed a Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine.\n* NATO Secretary General signed a Joint Declaration with the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission to take partnership between NATO and the European Union to a higher level.
