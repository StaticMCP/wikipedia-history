Vindex had rebelled against the Emperor Nero and declared his allegiance to Galba. Verginius advanced against him and a battle between their two forces took place near  Vesontio (modern Besançon).  What occurred then is unclear, but, despite a meeting between Verginius and Vindex, the forces under Verginius seem to have decided on a battle without orders. Desire for plunder and the weakness of Verginius as a commander are possible explanations. Vindex was defeated in the resulting battle and subsequently committed suicide.\nReferences"
