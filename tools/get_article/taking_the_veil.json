It was the first single released in support of his 1986 album Gone to Earth.\nThe song's title was inspired by Sylvian's encounter with the Max Ernst collage novel A Little Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil. However, whereas Ernst's volume deals with various forms of angst undergone by its main character, the lyrics to Sylvian's song are much more positive.\nChart positions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1986)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n| Irish Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n|-\n| UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
