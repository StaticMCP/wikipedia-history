After moving to Los Angeles, Allen landed an internship with DJ and record producer Diplo. He has since been involved in most of the DJ's projects, including work by Major Lazer, Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Charli XCX, Mark Ronson, the Weeknd, Desiigner, Madison Beer, Sting, and Kiesza.\nCareer\nAllen studied classical guitar and initially didn't think that his music would focus on a mainstream sound. He admitted, \"I really wasn't super interested in making 'pop' music at all\". This changed after his first few success stories, including co-writing and co-producing Major Lazer's song \"Cold Water\" and Beyoncé's \"All Night\".\nKing Henry released his debut EP, ''Don't Stay Away, in late 2016, on Black Butter Records worldwide and his own Duke City in North America. The album features vocals by Naations, SEMMA, Bloodboy, and Emmi. His follow-up EP, titled For You, was released in 2017, also on Black Butter and Duke City, and features Sasha Sloan, Rhye, RY X, and Maejor. The end of 2017 saw King Henry performing his first-ever live shows, supporting RÜFÜS DU SOL.\nDiscography\nEPs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Title\n!Album details\n!Track listing\n|-\n|Don't Stay Away''\n|\n* Released: November 11, 2016\n* Label: Duke City / Black Butter Records (UK)\n* Format: digital download\n|\n# \"Don't Stay Away\" (feat.
