Among other theories, he speculated that the deployment of tanks in Operation Desert Storm could have influenced its sales. Steel Panthers II was nominated as Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1996 wargame of the year, although it lost to that year's Battleground games: Shiloh, Antietam and Waterloo. It was also a nominee for CNET Gamecenter's \"Strategy Game of the Year\" award, which went to Civilization II.\nWilliam R. Trotter of PC Gamer US was largely positive toward Steel Panthers II, but felt that it was held back by its technical problems, glitches and oversights. He concluded, \"If not for the numerous little flaws that keep it from realizing its own best intentions, this would have been my nominee for Wargame of the Year.\" In Computer Games Strategy Plus, Robert Mayer was less impressed: he considered it visually impressive but unrealistic, with numerous historical oversights. He nevertheless called it \"a worthy successor to a very successful game\".\nSteel Panthers and Steel Panthers II were named, collectively, the 62nd best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997.\nLegacy\nThe game was followed by Steel Panthers III: Brigade Command 1939-1999. The Camo Workshop released a mod based on Steel Panthers II called SP2WW2 (Steel Panthers II: World War 2) in 1998.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/steel-panthers-ii-modern-battles Steel Panthers II: Modern Battles] at MobyGames"
