The film is based on the 2012 article \"Marie Colvin’s Private War\" in Vanity Fair by Marie Brenner. The film was written by Arash Amel and features Jamie Dornan, Tom Hollander and Stanley Tucci.\nThe film premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States on November 2, 2018. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Pike's performance. At the 76th Golden Globe Awards, the film earned nominations for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Pike) and Best Original Song (\"Requiem for A Private War\"), while director Matthew Heineman received a nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement of a First Time Feature Film Director from the Directors Guild of America.\nPlot\nMarie Colvin is an American journalist for The Sunday Times, visiting the most dangerous countries and documenting their civil wars.\nIn 2001, while trekking with the Tamil Tigers, Colvin and her crew are ambushed by the Sri Lanka Army. Despite her attempt to surrender, an RPG fires in her direction, wounding her to the point that she loses her left eye. Afterward, Colvin decides to wear an eyepatch.\nDiagnosed with PTSD, Colvin is still determined to look for new stories, and argues with her boss, Sean Ryan, about conflicts she wants to cover, including Iraq, where she meets war photographer Paul Conroy, and Libya. She lives in London when not traveling the world, and begins a relationship with Tony Shaw (Stanley Tucci).\nIn February 2012, Conroy and Colvin decide to cover the conflict in the city of Homs, where they find 28,000 Syrian men, women, and children caught in the crossfire. After Conroy and Colvin send their story to Ryan, Colvin decides to broadcast to CNN to bring awareness to civilian casualties. As Marie, Paul, and another reporter, Rémi Ochlik, flee the building they had used as a media centre, the street is peppered with explosions. Paul, injured and shellshocked, wakes to find Colvin and Ochlik killed from the explosions and subsequent pile-up of rubble.\nThe film ends with imagery of the devastated city of Homs, followed by an interview of the real Marie Colvin, with the quote: \"You're never going to get to where you're going if you acknowledge fear.\"\nCast\n* Rosamund Pike as Marie Colvin\n* Jamie Dornan as Paul Conroy\n* Tom Hollander as Sean Ryan, The Sunday Times' foreign editor and Marie's boss\n* Nikki Amuka-Bird as Rita Williams, Marie's friend\n* Faye Marsay as Kate Richardson\n* Greg Wise as Professor David Irens\n* Corey Johnson as Norm Coburn, another photographer\n* Stanley Tucci as Tony Shaw\n*Fady Elsayed as Mourad\nProduction\nThe film was produced in Jordan and London, and was shot by Robert Richardson.
