Later depictions in other poetry and literature and various guises in drama and cinema have typically portrayed her as the Queen of the Fairies.\nOrigin\nShakespeare may have borrowed the character of Mab from folklore, but this is debated and there have been numerous theories on the origin of the name. A popular theory holds that Mab derives from Medb (pronounced \"Maive\"), a legendary queen from 12th-century Irish poetry; scholar Gillian Edwards notes \"little resemblance\", however, between the two characters. There is marked contrast between the formidable warrior Medb and the tiny dream-bringer Mab.\nOther authors such as Wirt Sikes argued that Mab comes from the Welsh \"mab\" (\"child\" or \"son\"), although critics noted the lack of supporting evidence. Thomas Keightley suggested a connection to Habundia or Dame Habonde, a goddess associated with witches in medieval times and sometimes described as a queen.\nA more likely origin for Mab's name would be from Mabel and the Middle English derivative \"Mabily\" (as used by Chaucer) all from the Latin amabilis (\"lovable\"). Simon Young contends that this fits in with fairy names in British literature of the time, which tended to be generic and monosyllabic. \"Mab\" was a nickname for a low-class woman or prostitute, or possibly for a haglike witch. Similarly, \"queen\" is a pun on \"quean\", a term for a prostitute.\nMercutio's speech\n\"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\nAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\nHer wagon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\nThe traces of the smallest spider's web,\nThe collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams,\nHer whip of cricket's bone; the lash of film;\nHer waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,\nNot half so big as a round little worm\nPricked from the lazy finger of a maid:\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\nTime out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\nO'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,\nO'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,\nO'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\nSometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\nTickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,\nThen dreams he of another benefice:\nSometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\nOf healths five-fathom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\nAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plaits the manes of horses in the night,\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\nWhich once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage:\nThis is she—\"\n— Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Act I, scene IV\nIn other works\nSince then, Queen Mab re-appears in works:\n* Ben Jonson's \"The Entertainment at Althorp\" (1603)\n* Michael Drayton's \"Nymphidia\" (1627)\n* In Poole's work Parnassus (1657), Mab is described as the Queen of the Fairies and consort to Oberon, emperor of the Fairies.\n* 1750 pantomime by actor Henry Woodward,\n* Queen Mab (1813), the first large poetic work written by Percy Bysshe Shelley\n* The composer Hector Berlioz wrote a \"Queen Mab\" scherzo in his Romeo et Juliette symphony (1839). Hugh Macdonald describes this piece as \"Berlioz's supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, prestissimo and pianissimo almost without pause... The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.\"\n* Charles Gounod's 1867 opera Romeo et Juliette includes a song about Queen Mab sung by the character Mercutio.\n* In the 1998 television miniseries Merlin, Queen Mab (Miranda Richardson) has been inserted into Arthurian legend as the primary antagonist, but is preserved as a ruler of fairies, pixies, goblins and a belief system referred to as 'the old ways', in opposition to the introduction of Christianity by recent Roman influences. Mab is responsible for the creation of the half-human wizard Merlin and influences the conception of Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son and her protegé. This version of Mab is the twin and opposite of the Lady of the Lake.\n* In The Dresden Files Summer Knight (2002) by Jim Butcher, Mab appears as the Queen of the Unseelie Court, also known as the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Winter Fae.\n* Under the Pendulum Sun (2017) by Jeannette Ng has Mab as queen of the fae.\n* Persona (series), where one of the available \"personas\" is named Queen Mab.\nReferences"
