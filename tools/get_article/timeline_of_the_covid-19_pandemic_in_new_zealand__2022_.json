As a result, the official figure was revised from 14,043 to 19,476.\nBy 27 October, the Ministry of Health reported that cases were averaging over 1,500 per day. 3,575 cases were reported that day while 3,923 cases were reported on 26 October.

In addition, the hospitalisation and death rates increased during that period; with 322 in hospital, 8 in intensive care, and 13 deaths. In addition, the population's immunity to COVID-19 was affected by long gaps between boosters and past infections and new overseas COVID strains such as XBB and BQ.1. In response, several public health experts including epidemiologist Michael Baker, immunologist Anna Brooks, and vaccinologist Helen Petousis-Harris called for the reinstatement of mask mandates and government support for vaccine rollouts including the Bivalent vaccine.\nDecember\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2| Cases\n! colspan=2 | Reinfections\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

The seven day rolling average for new daily cases is 6,099, making it the worst week in the latest Omicron outbreak. Based on these figures, University of Auckland computational evolution senior lecturer  Dr David Welch estimated that two or three out of every 100 individuals was being infected. College for Emergency Medicine chair Kate Allan expressed concerns that the movement of tourists to the Coromandel, Thames, Northland Region, Queenstown and Wānaka could place hospitals under strain. University of Otago epidemiologist Dr Michael Baker advised people to wear respirator masks in shopping malls and supermarkets.\nTraffic lights timeline\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=\"3\" | COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic lights)\n|-\n! style=\"width:160px;\" | Red\n! style=\"width:160px;\" | Orange\n! style=\"width:160px;\" | Green\n|-\n| 1 January 2022\n| Northland\n| Rest of North Island, South Island\n|\n|-\n| 21 January 2022\n|\n| New Zealand\n|\n|-\n| 24 January 2022\n| New Zealand\n|\n|\n|-\n|13 April 2022\n|\n| New Zealand\n|\n|-\n|13 September 2022\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
