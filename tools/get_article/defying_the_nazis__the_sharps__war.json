The film is about the previously untold story of Waitstill and Martha Sharp, an American minister and his wife from Wellesley, Massachusetts, who left their children behind in the care of their parish and boldly committed to a life-threatening mission in Europe. Over two dangerous years they helped to save scores of imperiled Jews and refugees fleeing Nazi occupation across Europe.\nProduction\nFlorentine Media and No Limits Media co-produced the film. This documentary expands on the film that Artemis Joukowsky produced and directed in 2012 entitled ''Two Who Dared: The Sharps' War''. One major addition was Tom Hanks as the voice actor for Waitstill Sharp.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/defying-nazis-sharps-war/ Official Website] at PBS\n*\n*"
