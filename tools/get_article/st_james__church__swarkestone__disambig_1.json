It was rebuilt between 1874 and 1876 by Frederick Josias Robinson of Derby, with Mr Lilley of Ashby-de-la-Zouch as the contractor. The west gallery was removed, and the high pews were taken out. The flat late roofs were removed and the flat ceiling, which cut off the upper part of the tower arch, was taken down. The walls were stripped of plaster and colour wash. An arcade of three arches, with carved and moulded capitals was erected between the nave and aisle, and new high pitched roofs with tiles were placed over the whole building. The entrance to the church was removed from the tower to the south side of the church. The walls of the chancel were rebuilt. The east window of three lights was fitted with a new stained glass window by Burlison and Grylls, the gift of the dowager Lady Crewe. It re-opened on 26 July 1876.\nParish status\nThe church is in a joint parish with\n*All Saints’ Church, Aston-upon-Trent\n*St Wilfrid's Church, Barrow-upon-Trent\n*St Andrew’s Church, Twyford\n*St Bartholomew’s Church, Elvaston\n*St James’ Church, Shardlow and Great Wilne\n*St Mary the Virgin’s Church, Weston-on-Trent\nMemorials\nThe church contains memorials to:\n*Sir John Harpur (d. 1627)\n*Richard Harpur (d. 1573)\n*Frances Willoughby (d. 1714)\n*John Rolleston (d. 1482)\nOrgan\nThe church has a pipe organ by Charles Lloyd dating from around 1876.
