In addition to fundraising, the organization also engaged in political sabotage against Nixon's opponents, the various Democratic politicians running in the election.\nHistory\nPlanning began in late 1970 and an office opened in the spring of 1971. Besides its re-election activities, CRP employed money laundering and slush funds, and was involved in the Watergate scandal. According to CRP member Donald Segretti, members actively attempted to sabotage Democratic candidates.\nEdmund Muskie sabotage\nIn an effort to sabotage Democratic candidate Edmund Muskie, then a presidential candidate, the CRP circulated a fabricated document, called the \"Canuck letter\", in an effort to ruin his reputation and destroy his chances in the 1972 New Hampshire primary by framing him as biased against Americans of French-Canadian descent.\nFailed attempt to sabotage George Wallace\nIn California, the CRP aimed to get George Wallace's American Independent Party (AIP) knocked off the ballot in the 1972 presidential election. They feared that he would split the vote in a 3-way race, and without him believed Wallace voters would go for Nixon. As part of this plan, in 1971 the CRP offered to pay Joseph Tommasi, a Californian neo-Nazi, , , to help. Tommasi was told to convince AIP voters to register instead as Republican; due to California's election rules, if there were too few registered voters for a party, they would be knocked off the ballot. The goal was to get the AIP's numbers either below 11,000 or less than 1/15th of 1% of all registered voters in the state.\nThe AIP's voter registration actually rose during the period the plan was enacted. Tommasi's involvement was also a failure, as he only came up with 4 men for the plan instead of his promised 20. Tommasi was paid less than he was promised ( vs ), and claimed the CRP had cheated the Nazis. In response, Tommasi leaked the story to the press. This initially resulted in only local news reports, but after the reveal of the Watergate scandal and CRP's implication in it, the story made national news, including in The New York Times. Hugh W. Sloan Jr. testified about the plan to the Watergate Commission.\nRobert Walters, the high-profile right-wing activist who created the plan, initially denied any tie to the CRP and said he had come up with the idea on his own. He also said he did not remember the Nazis. Another participant in the plan disputed Walters's telling of events; reporters ultimately found checks from Walters to Tommasi, after which Walters conceded that the neo-Nazis \"might have been involved\". The plan was described by the Watergate Committee as a \"complete failure numerically, according to all participants\", though the Los Angeles Free Press noted it had perhaps worked out for Tommasi.\nWatergate\nThe CRP used $500,000 in funds raised to re-elect President Nixon to pay legal expenses for the five Watergate burglars. This act helped turn the burglary into an explosive political scandal. The burglars, as well as G. Gordon Liddy, E. Howard Hunt, John N. Mitchell, and other Nixon administration figures (Watergate Seven), were indicted over the break-in and their efforts to cover it up.\nThe acronym CREEP became popular due to the Watergate scandal.\nLegacy\nWriting for Time magazine, Jonathan van Harmelen wrote that \"the tactics pioneered by members of Trojans for Representative Government and later CREEP set a precedent for the sort of organized political sabotage that has become commonplace today in a digital world\".\nProminent members\n* Charles Colson, special counsel to the President\n* Kenneth H.
