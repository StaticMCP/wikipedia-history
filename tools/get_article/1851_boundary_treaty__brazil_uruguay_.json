The Treaty of Montevideo (1828) confirmed Brazil's right to intervene in Uruguay's internal affairs. The treaties also allowed joint navigation on the Uruguay River and its tributaries, and tax exempted cattle and salted meat exports. The treaties also acknowledged Uruguay's debt to Brazil for its aid against the Blancos, and Brazil's commitment for granting an additional loan. In addition, Uruguay renounced its territorial claims to a border in the Ibicuí River and accepted the Quaraí River as northernmost border with Brazil, thereby reducing its area the size of the Cisplatina Province, and recognized Brazil's exclusive right of navigation in the Lagoa Mirim and the Jaguarão River, the natural border between the countries.  However, a dispute still exists in the vicinity of Masoller over which creek was meant to mark the border in that area. Uruguay also allowed Brazilians to legally own slaves in their properties despite the fact that after 1842 slavery wasn't legal in the country.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2212545 Treaty between the United States of Brazil and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, Modifying their Frontiers on Lake Merim and the Jaguarão River and Establishing General Principles for Commerce and Navigation in those Places]\".
