He was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge on 15 May 1707 and was awarded MA in 1708. In 1708, he bought Hallfield House, near Sheffield. On 22 September 1716, he married Lady Mary Finch (1701-1761), a daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and 7th Earl of Winchilsea, and his second wife, the Hon. Anne Hatton. He succeeded his father to Wentworth Woodhouse in 1723, remodelling the house to its present form.\nCareer\nAt the 1715 general election, Watson-Wentworth was elected in a contest as Member of Parliament for the family borough of Malton. He was returned again unopposed at the 1722 general election. On the death of his father in 1723 he set himself up as leader of the Whigs in Yorkshire. In 1725, he was appointed a Knight of the Bath. At the 1727 general election he was returned unopposed as MP for Yorkshire instead. In 1728, he was created Baron Malton and vacated his seat in the House of Commons.\nAt this time, now Lord Malton, he deliberately burned most of the manuscripts left by the 17th-century antiquary Richard Gascoigne; this act has been attributed to legal advice from his attorney. He was admitted to the Privy Council of Ireland in 1733 and was Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1733 to 1750. In 1734, he was created Earl of Malton, and in 1746, Marquess of Rockingham. He had inherited the Barony of Rockingham and Rockingham Castle from his cousin, Thomas Watson, 3rd Earl of Rockingham, earlier in 1746.\nFamily\nHe and his wife Lady Mary Finch (1701–1761) had nine children:\n#William (1718-1718)\n#Thomas (1720-1734)\n#Daniel (1724-1730)\n#William, styled Viscount Higham (1728–1739), died young\n#Charles, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham (1730–1782), Prime Minister of Great Britain.\n#Lady Anne (d. 1769), married William Fitzwilliam, 3rd Earl Fitzwilliam.\n#Lady Mary (1725-1725)\n#Lady Mary (1727–1798), married John Milbanke.\n#Lady Charlotte Wentworth (1732–1810), died unmarried.\n#Lady Henrietta Alicia (b.1737), eloped and married her footman William Sturgeon in 1764.\nLord Rockingham died on 14 December 1750, according to Walpole 'drowned in claret', and was buried in York Minster.\n}}\nReferences\n|-\n|-\n|-"
