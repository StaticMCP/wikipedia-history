The 'Red Cossacks' murdered 97 Poles and an additional number of wounded Poles were killed after the battle. Among the dead was the commandant of the regiment Colonel Wladyslaw Domanski. Altogether on that day some 240 Poles died.

It was completely destroyed after the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939.\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141218005837/http://polskietermopile.pl/ Web service on Battle of Dytiatyn in Polish]\n* [http://www.plock24.pl/fusion/readarticle.php?article_id=312 Plock24.pl]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080210135113/http://www.historycy.pl/Strony/Artykuly/2006%2001/Polskie_temopile.html Historycy.pl]"
