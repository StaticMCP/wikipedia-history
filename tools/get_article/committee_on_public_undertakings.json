The duties and responsibilities of the COPU are specified in the Fourth Schedule of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. This committee, alongside the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Estimates Committee (EC), are the three financial standing committees of the Parliament of India.\nThe COPU consists of 22 members, 15 elected by the Lok Sabha, and not more than 7 members by the upper house, the Rajya Sabha. Committee members are elected annually from among members of both houses by means of proportional representation through the single transferable vote. The chairperson of the COPU is appointed by the Lok Sabha speaker. The term of the office of the members is one year. Ministers are not eligible to become a member of the committee. If a member, after being elected to the committee, becomes a Minister, the member ceases to be a member, from the date of such appointment.\nHistory\nThe first proposal for a separate public sector undertakings committee was made by Lanka Sundaram in December 1953, stating the inadequacies of both the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee regarding public undertakings. In May 1956, Ashok Mehta also proposed a separate committee for public undertakings, however the then finance minister held the view that the PAC and the EC were sufficient to handle the work load. By 1957, the government had agreed to form a standing sub-committee of the EC on public undertakings. In 1958, the congress formed the V. K. Krishna Menon committee. which put forward a number of recommendations intended to reconcile the accountability of public undertakings to parliament while keeping their autonomy on one hand and also ensuring efficiency on the other.\nIn September 1963, Minister of Commerce and Industry Nityanand Kanungo, put forward a motion in the Lok Sabha proposing the formation of a separate Parliamentary Committee on Public Undertakings. In pursuance of this motion, the Committee on Public Undertakings was formed in effect from May 1, 1964.\nScope and Working\nThe responsibilities of the Committee on Public Undertakings are:\n* To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings specified in the fourth Schedule to the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.\n* To examine the reports, if any, of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on the Public Undertakings.\n* To examine, in the context of the autonomy and efficiency of the Public Undertakings whether the affairs of the Public Undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices.\nThe committee from time to time takes up for examination as such any PSU or subjects related to them as they may deem fit and which are within their terms of reference. The depth or Undertaking concerned is asked to furnish necessary material relating to those subjects for information of the Members of the Committee. The Committee may from time to time appoint one or more Study Groups for carrying out detailed examination of various subjects.\nCurrent composition\nKey: |BJP (10)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |INC (4)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |SP (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |AITC (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |DMK (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |TDP (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}|JDU (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |SS (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |AAP (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}} |BJD (1)|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}   = 22 members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+15 Members from 18th Lok Sabha; tenureMay 2024-25\n!Sr. No.\n!Name\n!Constituency, state\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1\n|Baijayant Panda\n|Kendrapara, Odisha\n| rowspan=\"7\" |BJP\n| bgcolor=\"\" rowspan=7|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2\n|Shankar Lalwani\n|Indore, Madhya Pradesh\n|- align=\"center\"\n|3\n|Poonamben Maadam\n|Jamnagar, Gujarat\n|- align=\"center\"\n|4\n|B.

Since OVL did not chose to farm-out part of its stake to a local partner, the entire loss has been borne out by it,\" Following up in August 2015, COPU stated; \"Except reiterating its earlier reply OVL has not offered any justification for its ill-conceived decision not to farm-out part of its stake in IEC to local Russian firms/ entities and its unrealistic estimation of oil reserves and production targets.\"\nChairpersons\nChairpersons of the committee till date\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Sr. No.\n!Name\n!Term of office\n!Terms\n! colspan=\"2\" |Political party\n(Alliance)\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1\n|P.
