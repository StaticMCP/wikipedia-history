GALECA is an association of professional journalists and critics who regularly report on movies, TV and/or New York City stage productions for print, online, and broadcast outlets mainly in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. The group was founded in 2009 as the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association. As of February 2025, the organization listed approximately 540 members, including those on its advisory board.\nThe Dorian Award is named in honor of Oscar Wilde, in reference to the main character from his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, and the honor's logo includes an illustration of Wilde.\nVarious versions of the physical award over the years include a framed certificate, a giant cue-card, and a small canvas print showing an illustrated portrait of the winner or a memorable scene from the awarded project. During GALECA's Dorians Film Toast 2021 (airing April 18, 2021 on the streaming platform Revry), actress Carey Mulligan, in accepting the group's Best Actress award for her work in Promising Young Woman, said her Dorian \"might be the coolest prize I've ever seen.\"\nFormat\nThe Dorian Awards honor film, television and Broadway / Off-Broadway productions at separate times of the year. Dorian film nominees and winners for the previous calendar year are announced in January and February, while TV nominees and winners for the previous television season are typically announced in June and August. The Dorian Theater Awards were added in 2023, with a separate wing of the society consisting of 31 members announcing its inaugural winners June 1 of that year.\nIn addition to more traditional categories such as Film of the Year and Best TV Comedy, the Dorians include more novel categories, including Unsung TV Show, Visually Striking Film, Wilde Wit, and Campy Flick, an honor that has generated amusement from The New York Times.\nRather than present an official awards ceremony, GALECA typically hosts its annual \"Dorian Awards Winners Toast\", an informal day party in Los Angeles for members, winners, nominees, and associates. For the 2020 Toast, Antonio Banderas, the group's choice for 2019 Film Performance of the Year—Actor, and actress-director Olivia Wilde, director of GALECA's Unsung Film of the Year winner Booksmart, were among the honored guests.\nIn September 2020, GALECA presented its first televised awards, Dorians TV Toast 2020, a pre-recorded two-hour special on Revry with appearances by performers and producers including Hugh Jackman, Janelle Monáe, Billy Porter, Margaret Cho, Josh Thomas, Regina King, Dan Levy, Laverne Cox, John Oliver, Chad Michaels, Thomas Roberts, Fiona Shaw, Annie Murphy, Alex Newell, and Damon Lindelof. The program, shown on LGBTQ+ streaming platform Revry, was hosted by broadcasting veteran and LGBTQ rights activist Charles Karel Bouley, and included segments where he and other GALECA members discussed the merits of the contenders in various categories.\nBouley, known simply as Karel, also hosted the group's Dorians Film Toast 2021, this time a three-hour special featuring Carey Mulligan, Daniel Kaluuya, Chloé Zhao, Lee Daniels George C. Wolfe, Radha Blank, Lee Isaac Chung, Cynthia Nixon, Gabourey Sidibe, Rachel McAdams, Isabel Sandoval, Colman Domingo, Rafael L. Silva, Harry Hamlin, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Deven Green, Leslie Jordan, Emerald Fennell, California governor Gavin Newsom, Charo, Cox, Michaels, and other stars. \"Wilde Artist\" recipient Dolly Parton did not appear in the show to accept that special award (\"to a truly ground-breaking force in film, theater, and/or television\"), but said in a statement: \"I'm not sure I'm as edgy as past winners (in the Wilde Artist category) like Todd Haynes, Kate McKinnon, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Jordan Peele — but I am honored and humbled. I appreciate all of you entertainment journalists who are so passionate and are working so hard. Keep up the good work!\"\nA third awards special, Dorians TV Toast 2021, streamed on Here TV and its YouTube channel Planet Out, and later on-demand on Tubi. Bowen Yang, Jean Smart, Ziwe, Jennifer Beals, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Stephen Fry, Nick Kroll, Olivia Newton-John, Tituss Burgess, Fran Drescher, Michael Cimino, Josie Totah, Big Freedia, Russell T Davies, Gottmik, Callum Scott Howells, Steven Canals, Hannah Einbinder, Jim J. Bullock, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, Paapa Essiedu, Paul W. Downs, Jesse James Keitel, and Eurovision Song Contest host Edsilia Rombley were among the participants. In a unique moment, actor-comedian John Lehr impersonated gay cable news polling expert Steve Kornacki in presenting three categories.\nMembership\nHonorary GALECA members and advisors include or have included former film critics David Ansen and Kevin Thomas, lesbian journalist Judy Wieder (former editor-in-chief of The Advocate), broadcasting veteran Jane Velez-Mitchell, columnist Michael Musto, former Jezebel editor-in-chief and Teen Vogue online executive editor Koa Beck, Princeton University Dean of the College and feminist writer Jill Dolan, noted film critic and talk show host Bobby Rivers, and professor of literature Joseph Bristow, one of the world's leading authorities on Oscar Wilde.\nGALECA members who've authored new books on entertainment are occasionally interviewed by other members on the group's YouTube channel. Some of the authors who've participated are Tre'vell Anderson (We See Each Other: A Black, Trans Journey Through TV and Film), Kristen Lopez (But Have You Read the Book? 52 Literary Gems That Inspired Our Favorite Films), Michael Schulman (Oscar Wars), Matt Baume (''Hi Honey, I'm Homo) and Kyle Turner (The Queer Film Guide: 100 great movies that tell LGBTQIA+ stories'').\nThe channel also features members' interviews with Hollywood and New York stage creatives doing work the organization deems somehow special. Among the subjects: Kristen Wiig, Ricky Martin, Dominic Burgess and the creators of the Apple TV+ comedy Palm Royale; the stars and creators of Netflix's Dead Boy Detectives; and Longtime Companion cast members Bruce Davison, Dermot Mulroney and Stephen Caffrey alongside screenwriter Craig Lucas.\nIn addition, members' individual talks with such group \"heroes\" as Ziwe Fumudoh, Trace Lysette and Wilson Cruz are also presented.\n\"Ten Best\" lists\nTo commemorate the 2015 film and TV awards season, GALECA revealed its first \"Ten Best\" list, The Ten Best Movies About the Academy Awards. Included were such films as The Oscar, California Suite, For Your Consideration, and The Bodyguard. More recently, the group's lists include the Ten Best LGBTQ Movies Every Straight Person Should See, Ten Best Actresses of All Time, and Ten Best Films You Didn't Know Were LGBTQ.\nIn 2024, GALECA announced the group's choices for America's 10 Best TV News Journalists, praising the work of such on-air figures as CNN anchors Christiane Amanpour and Kaitlan Collins, NBC News reporter Jacob Soboroff, ABC News' David Muir and Robin Roberts, and Mehdi Hasan.\nDorians Toast theme songs\nFour original songs have been written for GALECA's Dorian Awards Toast streaming specials: \"Look Into the Light\", a pop ballad about the power of movies, and \"A Toast!,\" both sung by Morgan Mallory and written and composed by Mallory and Charles Karel Bouley; an expanded, faster-paced variation on the latter performed by Dave Rooney of The Black Donnellys with additional lyrics by Bouley and Rooney; and \"Flickering Life\", a pop rock tune about the power of TV also composed and sung by Mallory with lyrics by him and Bouley.\nHistory\nGALECA and its annual Dorian Awards were created in 2008 in Hollywood, California, by John Griffiths, former long-time television critic for Us Weekly magazine and contributor to Emmy Magazine of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. As of 2023, Griffiths remained as the nonprofit's Executive Director. Current and past elected board members include former Pride Media CEO Diane Anderson-Minshall, Pulitzer Prize winner Walt Hickey,  Variety editor Jazz Tangcay, and The New York Times columnist Trish Bendix.\nThe first Dorian Awards, for the 2009's best in both film and TV, were announced in January 2010 (nominees were revealed the previous month). GALECA's Dorian Award film and TV nominees and winners for 2010 productions were announced in January 2011. Following suit, 2011's Dorian Award nominees and ultimate honorees were revealed in January 2012. The Dorian nominees and winners for 2012 productions were announced in January 2013, and so on.\nIn 2018, the group separated its film and TV awards' timelines, with Dorian movie award winners revealed each February and TV honors in August.\nIn 2019, GALECA joined forces with the African-American Film Critics Association, Latino Entertainment Journalists Association (LEJA), the entertainment and features arm of the Asian American Journalists Association, the Online Association of Female Film Critics, and Time's Up Entertainment's CRITICAL initiative to form Critics Groups for Equality in Media (CGEM), to promote diversity in journalism. Time's Up, enmeshed in controversy, eventually dropped out of the alliance ahead of ceasing its programs in January 2023.\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic's effects on the film business, for its 2021 film awards, GALECA adjusted its window of eligibility to movies released in 2020 and the first two months of 2021. The 2022 Dorian film awards considered movies released in the remaining months of 2021. In that two-year period, award contenders vied for \"Best Film\" rather than \"Film of the Year,\" which the group restored in 2023.\nAlso in 2023, GALECA introduced the Crimson Honors, a college journalism contest for aspiring film and TV critics, focused on elevating female and nonbinary students of color in the LGBTQ community. The critics' reviews aggregate Rotten Tomatoes provided scholarship funds to three winners. GALECA broadened the contest's eligibility to LGBTQ students in general for its 2025 scholarship, with the organization this time providing prize funds itself.\nTheater Wing\nIn 2023, GALECA launched the Dorian Theater Awards, voted upon by members in the group who regularly critique, report on or assign coverage of Broadway and Off-Broadway stage productions. The contingent named honorees and two finalists per category that first year, and moved to first announcing nominees and then winners in 2024.\nIn 2025, GALECA's theater wing counted over 40 members, including Naveen Kumar of The Washington Post, HuffPost's Curtis Wong, Abbey White of The Hollywood Reporter, and Michael Schulman of The New Yorker.\nWinners\nThe below lists of film, TV and Broadway/Off-Broadway Dorian winners over the years do not include all the nominees or finalists in each category.\nDorian Film and TV Awards\n2024-25 (Television)\nSources -\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"500\" |Category\n!
