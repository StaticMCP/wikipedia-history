Located on East Randolph Street in Chicago, Illinois, the building sits between the new 340 on the Park building to its west and the older Outer Drive East building to its east. Two parks, Millennium Park and Lakeshore East Park, are immediately located to the Buckingham's south and north faces respectively. It is one of the few buildings that predates the new Lakeshore East development in the New Eastside neighborhood.\nThere are 7 rooms located on every residential floor of the building, for a total of 306 units. An indoor pool, sauna, laundry room, fitness center and open roof deck are located on the top floor. The Buckingham has 3 high-speed elevators that run the length of the building plus one elevator that runs from the first floor to each floor of the 4-story underground parking garage.\nPosition in Chicago's skyline\nThe Buckingham is east of 340 on the Park.  It appears (unlabelled) in front of Park Tower in the diagram below.\nReferences\nExternal links\nfrom BP Pedestrian Bridge\n*[http://www.thebuckingham.org/ Official Site]\n*[http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/1285/Buckingham__The.php More Photos from Chicago Architecture]"
