For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n8 Edw. 7\nThe third session of the 28th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 29 January 1908 until 21 December 1908.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 8 Ed. 7 or 8 E. 7.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  and 1884. }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the provision and regulation of Markets applicable in rural districts.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the compulsory acquisition of tenanted land.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  with respect to Piers, Quays, and other Works, and for other purposes connected therewith.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the White Phosphorus Prohibition Act 1908|public|42|21-12-1908|repealed=y|An Act to prohibit the Manufacture, Sale, and Importation of Matches made with White Phosphorus, and for other purposes in connection therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  with reference to the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Registrar.|note4= }}\n|  and 1891.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Coal Mines (Eight Hours) Act 1908or the Eight Hours Day Act 1908or the Eight Hours Act 1908|public|57|21-12-1908|maintained=y|An Act to amend the Coal Mines Regulation Acts 1887 to 1905, for the purpose of limiting hours of work below ground.}}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Clancy Act|public|61|21-12-1908|An Act to provide further facilities for the erection of Houses for the Working Classes in Cities and Towns in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| or the '''Children's Act 1908or the Children and Young Persons Act 1908or the Children's Charter'''|public|67|21-12-1908|repealed=y|maintained=y|An Act to consolidate and amend the Law relating to the Protection of Children and Young Persons, Reformatory and Industrial Schools, and Juvenile Offenders, and otherwise to amend the Law with respect to Children and Young Persons.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Acts amending it.|note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to the Transfer of Training Colleges in Scotland.|po1=Transfer of Training Colleges (Scotland) Order 1908|Provisional Order to enable the body of management of any existing Training College or Colleges in Scotland to demit their powers of management and to transfer such College or Colleges and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to the Clyde Navigation.|note4=|po1=Clyde Navigation (Superannuation) Order 1908|}}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  to provide for the acquisition by the Knott End Railway Company of the undertaking of the Garstang and Knot End Railway Company and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  to authorise the Hull and Barnsley Railway Company to construct new railways and for other purposes}}\n|  relating to Edinburgh Corporation (Tramways &c.).|note4=|po1=Edinburgh Corporation (Tramways, &c.)
