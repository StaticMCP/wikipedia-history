The locality is split between the Western Downs Region (northern part of the locality) and the Goondiwindi Region (southern part of the locality).\nThe Moonie Highway passes through the locality from the north-east to the south-west. The Leichhardt Highway passes through the locality from the north to the south. The town is at the intersection of the two highways.\nHistory\nThe town's name is derived from Moonie River, which was first recorded as Mooni by Sir Thomas Mitchell in November 1846 when he passed through the region.\nMoonie State School opened on 14 May 1962.\nIn 1973, a church building was moved from Drillham to Moonie to become Our Lady of the Way Catholic Church.\nMoonie Post Office opened by June 1966 closed in 1983.\nMoonie Library opened in 2003.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Moonie had a population of 189 people.\nIn the , the locality of Moonie had a population of 182 people.\nEconomy\nIn December 1961, Moonie was the site of Australia's first commercial oil field, a very small field consisting of less than one percent of Australia's oil and gas reserves.
