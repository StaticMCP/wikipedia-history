Since January 2023, the Minister has been Glen Simard.\nManitoba Sport, Culture and Heritage—through developing, supporting, promoting, and celebrating the identity and well-being of the province and its communities—manages those government programs and services that support the sport, art, culture, and heritage of Manitoba.\nThe Minister and the Department are responsible for generating sustainable economic growth based on Manitoba's unique qualities and identity; increasing community capacity to improve well-being; enhancing public access to knowledge and information; encouraging, sharing, and making use of the province’s cultural and heritage resources; building Manitoba’s identity and reputation as a hub for artistic opportunity; and supporting Manitoba’s investments in amateur sport and encourage the hosting of regional, national, and international sport events.\nLegislation\nStatutes that are the responsibility of the Minister of Sport, Culture and Heritage, include:\n* The Manitoba Advisory Council on Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Act\n* The Amusements Act (except Part II)\n* The Archives and Recordkeeping Act\n* The Arts Council Act\n* The Centre culturel franco-manitobain Act\n* The Coat of Arms, Emblems and the Manitoba Tartan Act\n* The Combative Sports Act\n* The Manitoba Film and Sound Recording Development Corporation Act\n* The Foreign Cultural Objects Immunity from Seizure Act\n* The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act\n* The Heritage Manitoba Act\n* The Heritage Resources Act\n* The Income Tax Act (section 10.4)\n* The Legislative Library Act\n* The Manitoba Multiculturalism Act\n* The Manitoba Museum Act\n* The Public Libraries Act\n* ''The Queen's Printer Act''\nHistory\nThe precise ministerial designations related to sport, culture, and/or heritage in Manitoba have changed several times.\nThe ministerial position can be traced back to 1966, when Attorney-General Sterling Lyon was named as Minister of Tourism and Recreation. The newly-elected government of Edward Schreyer added a separate ministry of Cultural Affairs in 1969, but united the two ministries in 1971. In 1978, a minister in Sterling Lyon's government was given responsibility for Sport.\nResponsibility for Tourism was transferred to the Economic Development portfolio in 1979, and was not reunited with Culture until 1999. Culture Ministers were also responsible for Citizenship from 1991 until 1999, when the responsibility was given to the Minister of Labour and Immigration.\nLists of ministers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ministers of culture, heritage, and recreation\n!Name\n!Party\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Tourism and Recreation\n|-\n|Sterling Lyon\n|PC\n|July 22, 1966\n|September 24, 1968\n|-\n|John Carroll\n|PC\n|September 24, 1968\n|July 15, 1969\n|-\n|Peter Burtniak\n|NDP\n|July 15, 1969\n|December 1, 1971\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Cultural Affairs\n|-\n|Philip Petursson\n|NDP\n|July 17, 1969\n|November 4, 1970\n|-\n|Peter Burtniak\n|NDP\n|November 4, 1970\n|December 1, 1971\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Tourism, Recreation and Cultural Affairs\n|-\n|Laurent Desjardins\n|NDP\n|December 1, 1971\n|January 28, 1974\n|-\n|Rene Toupin\n|NDP\n|January 28, 1974\n|September 22, 1976\n|-\n|Ben Hanuschak\n|NDP\n|September 22, 1976\n|October 24, 1977\n|-\n|Robert Banman\n|PC\n|October 24, 1977\n|October 20, 1978\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Tourism and Cultural Affairs\n|-\n|Norma Price\n|PC\n|October 20, 1978\n|November 15, 1979\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Cultural Affairs and Historical Resources\n|-\n|Norma Price\n|PC\n|November 15, 1979\n|November 30, 1981\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Culture, Heritage and Recreation\n|-\n|Eugene Kostyra\n|NDP\n|November 30, 1981\n|April 17, 1986\n|-\n|Judy Wasylycia-Leis\n|NDP\n|April 17, 1986\n|May 9, 1988\n|-\n|Bonnie Mitchelson\n|PC\n|May 9, 1988\n|February 5, 1991\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship\n|-\n|Bonnie Mitchelson\n|PC\n|February 5, 1991\n|September 10, 1993\n|-\n|Harold Gilleshammer\n|PC\n|September 10, 1993\n|January 6, 1997\n|-\n|Rosemary Vodrey\n|PC\n|January 6, 1997\n|October 5, 1999\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Culture, Heritage and Tourism\n|-\n|Diane McGifford\n|NDP\n|October 5, 1999\n|January 17, 2001\n|-\n|Ron Lemieux\n|NDP\n|January 17, 2001\n|September 25, 2002\n|-\n|Eric Robinson\n|NDP\n|September 25, 2002\n|September 12, 2007\n|-\n|Flor Marcelino\n|NDP\n|November 3, 2009\n|October 18, 2013\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ministers of Sport\n!Name\n!Party\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Fitness, Recreation and Sport\n|-\n|Robert Banman\n|PC\n|October 20, 1978\n|November 30, 1981\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister responsible for Recreation and Sport\n|-\n|Laurent Desjardins\n|NDP\n|November 30, 1981\n|November 4, 1983\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister responsible for Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act\n|-\n|Laurent Desjardins\n|NDP\n|November 4, 1983\n|February 10, 1988\n|-\n|James Ernst\n|PC\n|May 9, 1988\n|February 5, 1991\n|-\n|Eric Stefanson\n|PC\n|February 5, 1991\n|September 10, 1993\n|-\n|James Ernst\n|PC\n|September 10, 1993\n|January 6, 1997\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister responsible for Fitness and Amateur Sport and the Boxing Commission Act\n|-\n|Eric Stefanson\n|PC\n|January 6, 1997\n|October 5, 1999\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister responsible for Sport\n|-\n|David Chomiak\n|NDP\n|October 5, 1999\n|January 17, 2001\n|-\n|Ron Lemieux\n|NDP\n|January 17, 2001\n|September 25, 2002\n|-\n|Eric Robinson\n|NDP\n|September 25, 2002\n|September 12, 2007\n|-\n|Eric Robinson\n|NDP\n|November 3, 2009\n|October 18, 2013\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ministers of Culture, Heritage, and Sport\n!Name\n!Party\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport\n|-\n|Eric Robinson\n|NDP\n|September 12, 2007\n|November 3, 2009\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Tourism, Culture, Heritage, Sport and Consumer Protection\n|-\n|Ron Lemieux\n|NDP\n|October 18, 2013\n|May 3, 2016\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Sport, Culture and Heritage\n|-\n|Rochelle Squires\n|PC\n|May 3, 2016\n|August 17, 2017\n|-\n|Cathy Cox\n|PC\n|August 17, 2017\n|January 18, 2022\n|-\n|Andrew Smith\n|PC\n|January 18, 2022\n|January 30, 2023\n|-\n|Obby Khan\n|PC\n|January 30, 2023\n|October 18, 2023\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Minister of Sport, Culture, Heritage and Tourism\n|-\n|Glen Simard\n|rowspan=\"2\"|NDP\n|October 18, 2023\n|November 13, 2024\n|-\n|Nellie Kennedy\n|November 13, 2024\n| incumbent\n|}\nSee also\n* Minister of Canadian Heritage\n* Minister for Sport (Canada)\n* Minister responsible for the Status of Women (Manitoba)\nReferences"
