The design of the coat of arms had been based on the design of the coat of arms of the duke Janusz I of Warsaw, who ruled the Duchy of Warsaw, from between 1373 and 1374 to 1429. It was present on the banner used by his forces during the Battle of Grunwald. The eagle present in the coat of arms was a symbol of the Duchy of Masovia, originally used by duke Siemowit III in 14th century, while a Piast Dragon, a symbol of the Duchy of Czersk. The dragon used by Czersk was green, however the banner used by duke Janusz I, was red. The county in its coat of arms, used the original green design instead, of the one present in the banner.\nThe civil flag was a rectangle divided in the middle into four equal rectangles. The top left and bottom right fields were white (silver), while top right field was red, and bottom left, was green. The state flag additionally featured the coat of arms of the county placed in the middle.\nOn 19 September 2012, the county had redesigned its coat of arms. It included changing the design of the eagle and the dragon present on it. It also had established the current design of the flag.\nGallery\nPOL powiat warszawski zachodni COA (2000-2012).svg|The coat of arms of West Warsaw County used from 2000 to 2012.\nFlag_of_Warsaw_West_County_(2000-2012).svg|The civil flag of Warsaw West County, used from 2000 to 2012\nState flag of Warsaw West County (2000-2012).svg|The state flag of Warsaw West County, used from 2000 to 2012\nReferences"
