Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.\nDesign and development\nThe Warrior was designed to comply with the US Experimental - Amateur-built aircraft rules. It featured a single  diameter two-bladed main rotor, a two-bladed tail rotor, both made from single metal extrusions. The kit's drive components were intended to be supplied complete and ready to install. The aircraft had a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield and skid-type landing gear. A cockpit enclosure was optional. The standard engine used was a twin cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition  Hirth 2706 powerplant.\nThe aircraft fuselage was made from steel and aluminum tubing and supplied in three major bolt-together sub-assemblies. It had an empty weight of  and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of . With full fuel of  the payload for the pilot and baggage was .\nThe manufacturer estimated the construction time from the planned assembly kit as 80&nbsp;hours.\nThe company said \"the Warrior was used [as] a proof of concept platform to develop new models\" and was followed by the two place Pawnee Chief.\nOperational history\nBy 1998 the company reported that one aircraft had been completed and was flying.\nBy April 2015 no examples were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration and it is likely that no examples exist any more.\nSpecifications (Warrior)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Hirth 2706\n|eng1 type=twin cylinder, air-cooled, two stroke aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=65\n|rot number=1\n|rot dia m=\n|rot dia ft=21\n|rot dia in=0\n|rot area sqm=\n|rot area sqft=346\n|rot area note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=100\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=80\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=180\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=10000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|disk loading kg/m2=\n|disk loading lb/sqft=2.5\n|disk loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\n*List of rotorcraft\nReferences"
