The council plans to achieve this by replicating its Manufacturing Connect program at elementary and high schools in the Chicago region.  This program links public schools with the manufacturing sector solving their talent needs and creating career options for youth and adults.  Manufacturing Renaissance (www.mfgren.org) provides management and staff for the CMRC.\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090225103125/http://chicagomanufacturing.org/ Chicago Manufacturing Renaissance Council (CMRC)]\n* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121263901268847755 Wall Street Journal]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080704105722/http://www.chicagoreporter.com/index.php/c/Sidebars/d/A_common_cause Chicago Reporter]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717095725/http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/news/index.php?item=2544&cat=23 Catalyst-Chicago]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061421/http://austinweeklynews.1upsoftware.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&SubSectionID=1&ArticleID=1257&TM=83316.45 Austin Weekly News]\n* [http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/183136721.html Entrepreneur.com]\n* [https://archive.today/20130414114507/http://www.chitowndailynews.org/Chicago_news/Shuttered_Austin_school_leaves_void,9821 Chi-Town Daily News]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111007003941/http://americaneconomicalert.org/news_item.asp?NID=3307827 AmericanEconomicAlert.org]"
