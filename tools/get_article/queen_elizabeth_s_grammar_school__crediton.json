In 1559 it was \"further endowed by Queen Elizabeth, who by her charter vested the patronage in the twelve governors of the church, directing them to elect four boys, under the name of Queen Elizabeth's Grammar Scholars, to each of whom 40s. are annually given: there are three exhibitions, of £6. 13s 4d each, to either of the universities, tenable for five years. \"\nTeaching began in 1572 in the Lady Chapel of the parish church with 10 pupils\nIn 1861 it moved into new premises (at St Martins Lane).\nIn 1911 it absorbed Dunn's School.\nIt was noted in Hansard in 1952 as a maintained secondary school which provided boarding.\nMerger in 1966\nIn 1966 the boys grammar school (between St Martins Lane and Western Road) incorporated the Crediton High School For Girls (which had been founded in 1911 on the adjoining site to the west).
