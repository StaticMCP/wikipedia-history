This was the fifth such election since the post of President of the Republic of Abkhazia was created in 1994. The election was held to elect the successor of president Sergei Bagapsh who died in office on 29 May 2011.\nBackground\nThe election was originally scheduled to take place in 2014, five years after the previous election; however, the Constitution of Abkhazia required an election to be held within three months after the unexpected death of incumbent president Sergei Bagapsh on 29 May. On 8 June the People's Assembly set the election date for 26 August. The MPs decided against earlier dates such as 20 August, which is immediately after the summer holidays, as the election is largely organised by teachers and to allow for repairs to school buildings to be completed, where many polling stations are located.\nRequirements and registration procedure\nAccording to the Law on the Election of the President of the Republic of Abkhazia, candidates for the Presidency have to:\n* possess Abkhazian citizenship;\n* be of Abkhaz ethnicity;\n* be fluent in the Abkhaz language;\n* be no younger than 35 and no older than 65 years of age;\n* be eligible to vote;\n* have permanently lived in Abkhazia for the last five years up to the election day.\nProspective candidates have to be nominated between 27 June and 17 July. This can be done either by an initiative group of at least 10 people with a list of between 2000 and 2500 signatures, or by a political party registered with the Central Election Commission. The only parties registered in this way are United Abkhazia, the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia, the Party of the Economic Development of Abkhazia, the People's Party and the Communist Party. After the nomination period ends, the Central Election Commission will verify the signature lists and whether candidates satisfy the set requirements. To test the nominees' proficiency in Abkhaz, it has established a language commission. Registration of the candidates has to be completed before 27 July and two days after their registration the Central Election Commission has to make public the list of nominees whose candidacy had been approved.\nCandidates\nAll three candidates who were nominated for the election successfully completed their registration: Acting President Alexander Ankvab, Prime Minister Sergei Shamba and opposition leader Raul Khajimba. Following their nomination, Shamba and his vice presidential candidate, Shamil Adzynba, as well as Khajimba and his running mate Svetlana Jergenia applied for registration on 16 July. Ankvab and his vice presidential candidate Mikhail Logua filed their application on 17 July. The three presidential candidates passed their Abkhaz language test on 20 July 2011. All candidates were registered by the CEC on 25 July and received their certificates on 26 July.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Presidential candidate\n!Career\n!Vice presidential candidate\n!Career\n!Political support\n|-\n| width=\"160px\" nowrap align=center |\n| rowspan=2 width=\"160px\" |\n*Vice President (2005–2009)\n*Prime Minister (2003–2004)\n*Minister of Defence (2002–2003)\n| width=\"160px\" nowrap align=center |\n| rowspan=2 width=\"160px\" |\n*Widow of first President Vladislav Ardzinba\n| rowspan=2 width=\"320px\" |\n*Nominated by an initiative group (28 June)\n*2009 presidential candidate Zaur Ardzinba (28 June)\n*Nominated by the Forum for National Unity (16 July)\n*Akhatsa (5 July)\n*Aruaa (7 July)\n*Former prime minister and 2004 presidential candidate Anri Jergenia (27 July)\n*Union of Cossacks (5 August)\n|-\n!Raul Khajimba\n!Svetlana Jergenia\n|-\n| width=\"160px\" nowrap align=center |\n| rowspan=2 width=\"160px\" |\n*Acting President (since 29 May 2011)\n*Vice President (2010–2011)\n*Prime Minister (2005–2010)\n*Businessman\n| width=\"160px\" nowrap align=center |\n| rowspan=2 width=\"160px\" |\n*Governor of Gulripshi District\n| rowspan=2 width=\"320px\" |\n*Nominated by an initiative group (29 June)\n*United Abkhazia (22 July)\n*Amtsakhara (2 August)\n|-\n!Alexander Ankvab\n!Mikhail Logua\n|-\n| width=\"160px\" nowrap align=center |\n| rowspan=2 width=\"160px\" |\n*Prime Minister (since 13 February 2010)\n*Minister for Foreign Affairs (1997–2004 and 2004–2010)\n| width=\"160px\" nowrap align=center |\n| rowspan=2 width=\"160px\" |\n*Deputy Chairman of the committee for Youth Affairs and Sport\n| rowspan=2 width=\"320px\" |\n*Nominated by an initiative group (8 July)\n*Party for Economic Development (21 July)\n*10 (out of 12) members of the Association of Youth Organisations (28 July)\n*Communist Party (9 August)\n|-\n!Sergei Shamba\n!Shamil Adzynba\n|}\nCampaign\nThe election campaign official began when the candidates received their registration certificates on 26 July. According to election law, Alexander Ankvab and Sergei Shamba had to take leave from their offices. Correspondingly, Parliament Speaker Nugzar Ashuba temporarily took over as Acting President and Vice-Premier Beslan Kubrava as Prime Minister.\nOn 19 July, the League of Voters \"For Fair Elections\" held its first press conference to announce that it would monitor the upcoming election as in previous years.\nShamba's campaign was led by Beslan Eshba.\nMedia use\nTV broadcasts\nEach presidential candidate received three hours of free air time on national state television in the four weeks running up to election day, and each Vice Presential candidate one hour. During the first week, candidates had the choice between an hour of live interaction with voters and sending in a pre-recorded DVD. In the second week, the candidates, alone or assisted by no more than four associates, received one hour of live interaction with voters. In the third and fourth weeks, first the vice-presidential candidate and then the presidential candidates had the opportunity to answer alternatingly questions from voters and from officially registered media.\nApart from these broadcasts, each candidate could send in commercials up to five minutes, which were broadcast on weekdays between 1 and 25 August, three times daily (8:00, 18:00 and 20:00).\nThe order in which the broadcasts of candidates appeared was determined by draw, and was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n|style=\"width: 200px;\"|\n|style=\"width: 100px;\"|Monday\n|style=\"width: 100px;\"|Tuesday\n|style=\"width: 100px;\"|Wednesday\n|style=\"width: 100px;\"|Thursday\n|style=\"width: 100px;\"|Friday\n|style=\"width: 200px;\"|Order of commercials\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" |Week 1 (1–5 August)\n|Khajimba\n|\n|Shamba\n|\n|Ankvab\n|Khajimba – Ankvab – Shamba\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" |Week 2 (8–12 August)\n|Khajimba\n|\n|Shamba\n|\n|Ankvab\n|Khajimba – Shamba – Ankvab\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" |Week 3 (15–19 August)\n|Logua\n|\n|Jergenia\n|\n|Adzynba\n|Ankvab – Khajimba – Shamba\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\" |Week 4 (22–26 August)\n|Shamba\n|Khajimba\n|Ankvab\n|\n|\n|Ankvab – Shamba – Khajimba\n|}\nOpinion polls\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Instead, it sent a letter to the Ministry of Defence requesting that soldiers should receive leave ten days before the election, allowing them to collect absentee ballots and thus vote in a polling station of their choosing.\nAccording to the Abkhazian electoral commission, preliminary results showed a first round victory for Ankvab over Shamba and Khajimba.\nThe official results, released on 27 August, showed only small differences, and Alexander Ankvab was elected in the first round. He is to be sworn in on 26 September.\nReferences"
