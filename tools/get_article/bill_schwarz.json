The project began as a collaboration, and clearly Schwarz is a faithful amanuensis. Answering the need to reduce this material to a manageable form, he arranges each chapter with a foreword, argument and afterword, which gives the flavour of an extended series of talks.&nbsp;... Familiar Stranger reads as a subtle and subversive memoir of the end of empire.\" The reviewer for Black Perspectives concluded: \"An undeniable boon to cultural and postcolonial studies, Stuart Hall and Bill Schwarz's Familiar Stranger turns the traditional memoir on its head, and produced an engaging exchange about race, identity, colonialism, and culture.\"\nSelected bibliography\n* West Indian Intellectuals in Britain (Studies in Imperialism series), Manchester University Press, 2003, ; paperback\n* ''Memories of Empire: The White Man's World (Volume I), Oxford University Press, 2011, ; paperback 2013,\n* With Stuart Hall, Familiar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands, Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2017,\n;As editor\n* The Locations of George Lamming, Warwick University Caribbean Studies series, Macmillan, Oxford, 2007,\n*  Caribbean Literature After Independence.
