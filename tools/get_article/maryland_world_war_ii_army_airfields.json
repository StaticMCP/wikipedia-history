However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nFirst Air Force\n* Baltimore MAP, Baltimore\n: Also part of Air Technical Service Command\n: 394th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Industrial area (non-aviation use)\n* Camp Springs/Andrews Field AAF, Camp Springs\n: Headquarters, Continental Air Forces\n: 463d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now:  Andrews Air Force Base\nProving Ground Command\n* Phillips Field AAF, Havre de Grace\n: Now: active US Army Airfield , part of Aberdeen Proving Ground\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
