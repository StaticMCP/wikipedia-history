The municipality entered then into the Cisalpine Republic in July 1797.\nHistory\nThe city of Crema and its surroundings had been annexed by the Republic of Venice since 1449, and had been ruled by a Venetian podestà for more than three centuries. On 28 March 1797, a troop of French Revolutionary Army dragoons entered and occupied the city without facing any resistance and arrested the last Venetian magistrate, the duke Zan Battista Contarini.\nA new municipality was formed to control the city, which was composed mostly of small landowners and local nobles. They proclaimed the new Republic of Crema, that had the control of the town and the territories previously belonging to the province of Crema.\nThe small revolutionary republic had a short life. Three months later, on 29 July 1797, its territory merged with the Cisalpine Republic and legally annexed to it on the base of the Treaty of Campo Formio, becoming part of the Adda department and later on the Alto Po one.\nNowadays, the territory of the former Republic of Crema goes from the municipality of Spino d'Adda (east) to the Castelleone one.\nFlag and coat of arms\nThe republic used a simple white flag with the coat of arms.\nReferences"
