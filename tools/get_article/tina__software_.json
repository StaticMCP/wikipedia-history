Its features include analog, digital, and mixed circuit simulations, and printed circuit board (PCB) design.\nHistory\nTINA was created and developed by DesignSoft, a Hungarian company in Budapest. The first Windows version was released in 1993 as TINA 4.0 for analog, digital, and mixed circuits. TINA 9.0 also includes microcontroller (MCU) simulation, RF network analysis, optimization, and printed circuit board design.  TINA development was at version 10, released in 2013, and is at major version 11 since 2016. Since 2004, TINA-TI is a free limited version for the support of integrated circuits and applications licensed by Texas Instruments.\nVersions\nTINA software is available in installable and cloud-based versions. Feature versions exist for use in industry and for educational use. TINA allows simulation, design, and real-time testing of hardware description language (HDL), such as VHDL, VHDL-AMS, Verilog, Verilog-A, Verilog-AMS, SystemVerilog and SystemC and for microcontroller (MCU) circuits, as well as mixed electronic circuits including switched-mode power supply, RF, communication, and optoelectronics circuits.\nWith the integrated and third-party flowchart tools, generation and debugging of MCU code is also possible both in digital and mixed circuit environments.\nTINA Design Suite includes an integrated layout module for designing multilayer PCB's with split power plane layers, auto-placement & auto-routing, rip-up and reroute, manual and \"follow-me\" trace placement, DRC, forward and back annotation, pin and gate swapping, keep-in and keep-out areas, copper pour, thermal relief, fan-out, 3D view of the PCB design, Gerber file, and CNC (G-code) output.\nTINA is available on many platforms with multiple versions of the software including TINA-TI, a complimentary limited version of TINA for the support of TI integrated circuits and applications licensed by Texas Instruments since 2004.\nTINACloud is the cloud based, multi-language, online version of TINA.\nIt is running in main browsers without installation through the Internet. TINACloud runs on most operating systems and computers.\nSince 2014, TINACloud is also used by Infineon Technologies as the engine of Infineon Designer for online prototyping with A/D simulation.\nAwards\n*2006: TINA 7 Design Suite: Worlddidac Award, Worlddidac Association\n*2014: TINACloud: Worlddidac Award, Worlddidac Association\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tina.com TINA website]\n*[http://www.tinausa.com TINA USA website]"
