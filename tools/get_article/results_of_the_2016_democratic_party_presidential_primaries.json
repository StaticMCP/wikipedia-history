Below are the vote totals for everyone that appeared on the ballot during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Two candidates, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, appeared on all 57 ballots. Two others, Martin O'Malley and Rocky De La Fuente, appeared in over 30 states and six others appeared on between two and ten states. Nearly 20 appeared on only New Hampshire's ballot. As of June 8, Hillary Clinton was considered the presumptive nominee according to media organizations. On July 26, the second day of the Democratic National Convention, Clinton was confirmed the Democratic nominee for the 2016 United States presidential election.\nOverview\nMajor candidates\nThe following are the results of candidates that have won at least one state. These candidates are on the ballots for every state, territory, and federal district contest. The results of caucuses do not always have attached preference polls and attendance can be extremely limited. The unpledged delegate count may not always reflect the latest declared preferences. Results are collected by The New York Times. For explanations of the various types of primaries see primary elections in the United States.\nDetailed results\nFebruary\nIowa\n* Precinct caucuses: February 1\n* County conventions: March 12\n* District conventions: April 30\n* State convention: June 18\nNew Hampshire\nNevada\nSouth Carolina\nSuper Tuesday\nAlabama\nArkansas\nAmerican Samoa\nColorado\nGeorgia\nMassachusetts\nMinnesota\nOklahoma\nTennessee\nTexas\nVirginia\nVermont\nEarly March\nKansas\nLouisiana\nNebraska\nMaine\nDemocrats Abroad\nMichigan\nMississippi\nNorthern Mariana Islands\nLate March\nFlorida\nIllinois\nMissouri\nNorth Carolina\nOhio\nArizona\nIdaho\nUtah\nAlaska\nHawaii\nWashington\nApril\nWisconsin\nWyoming\nNew York\nConnecticut\nDelaware\nMaryland\nPennsylvania\nRhode Island\nMay\nIndiana\nGuam\nWest Virginia\nKentucky\nOregon\nJune\nVirgin Islands\nPuerto Rico\nCalifornia\nMontana\nNew Jersey\nNew Mexico\nNorth Dakota\nSouth Dakota\nDistrict of Columbia\nSee also\n* Results of the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Libertarian Party presidential primaries\nNotes\nReferences"
