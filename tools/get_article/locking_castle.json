It has been scheduled as an ancient monument.\nIt was a motte and bailey on Carberry Hill. Excavations in 1902 identified the remains of a small stone chamber surrounded by a ditch. Fragments of pottery and the remains of a sword were also found. A coin from the period of Edward IV was also uncovered.\nAround the site of the castle is a  long bank which is around  high and a ditch. An area west of the inner bailey has been identified as a possible pillow mound.\nThe origin of the castle is unclear. It may have been part of the manor of Kewstoke or alternatively Hutton. The two manors were combined and given by Henry I to Geoffrey de Dun. In 1214 Locking was given to Woodspring Priory and would have ceased to have military significance.\nSee also\n*Castles in Great Britain and Ireland\n*List of castles in England\nReferences"
