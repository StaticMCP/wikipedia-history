The Hall of Four Heavenly Kings is a standard component of Chinese Buddhist temples.\nThe Four Heavenly Kings (Sanskrit Caturmahārāja, Pali Catu-Mahārāja, Chinese Sì Dà Tiānwáng 四大天王, Japanese Shitennō 四天王) are celestial deities or guardian gods in Buddhist cosmology who preside over the four cardinal directions and protect the Dharma.\nCosmological role\nIn Buddhist cosmology, the Four Heavenly Kings dwell on the lower slopes of Mount Sumeru in the heaven known as Cāturmahārājakāyika (the realm of the Four Great Kings). They act as subordinate deities of Śakra (Indra) in the Trāyastriṃśa realm and are tasked with guarding the four directions and protecting the world from malevolent forces.\nIn the Sutra of Golden Light (Suvarṇabhāsottamasūtra), the Four Heavenly Kings vow to protect those who honor and recite the sutra, thereby safeguarding righteous rulers and the Buddhist sangha.\nThey also appear in protective discourses such as the Āṭānāṭīya Sutta (Dīgha Nikāya 32), where one of the kings (Vessavaṇa / Vaiśravaṇa) gives protective verses against malicious spirits.\nIndividual kings and attributes\nEach king corresponds to a cardinal direction and leads classes of lesser spirits or beings. Their names and roles vary slightly across Buddhist traditions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Direction !! Name (Sanskrit / Pali) !! East Asian name !!

It was widely employed in East Asia as a state-protection text: rulers would commission recitations to invoke the protector deities, including the Four Heavenly Kings, to defend the realm from disasters, invasions, or internal disorder.\nIn particular, Emperor Shōmu of Nara Japan (8th century) ordered the construction of provincial temples, each enshrining a copy of the text, naming them “Temples for the Protection of the State by the Golden Light of the Four Heavenly Kings.”\nProtective sūtras and recitations\nThe Scripture of the Four Heavenly Kings (Si Tianwang Jing, T.590) is another text in the East Asian canon describing the kings' protective functions. Scholars have observed that parts of this scripture contain strongly secular or non-Buddhist elements.\nIconographic and regional variations\n* In Chinese Buddhism, the Four Kings are often enshrined in the Heavenly Kings Hall (天王殿) at temple entrances.\n* In Japanese Buddhism, known as Shitennō, they guard temple gates or surround the main deity in martial stances.\n* In Korean Buddhism, the Four Heavenly Kings at Hwaomsa (Gurye) have been studied, with attribution to the 17th-century sculptor monk In’gyun.\nThe standardized iconography (lute, sword, snake, parasol) crystallized in China under Tibetan Tantric influence.\nSymbolic interpretation\nThe Four Heavenly Kings are commonly interpreted as symbolizing:\n# Guardianship of the Dharma – protecting the world from negative influences.\n# Cosmic order – maintaining harmony in the universe through control of directions.\n# Support of rulers – legitimizing righteous kingship through divine protection.\nNames\nThe Kings are collectively named as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Language\n!Written form\n!Romanization\n!Translation\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Sanskrit\n|चतुर्महाराज\n|ChaturmahārājaChaturmahārājikā\n|Four Great Kings\n|-\n|लोकपाल\n|Lokapāla\n|Guardians of the World\n|-\n|Sinhala\n|\n|\n|Four Privileged/Bestowed Gods\n|-\n|Burmese\n|\n|\n| Loanword from catulokapālaloanword from catumahā + king nats\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Chinese\n|\n|\n| Heavenly Kings\n|-\n|\n|\n| Four Heavenly Kings\n|-\n|\n|\n| Four Great Heavenly Kings\n|-\n|\n|\n| Good, rainy weather for growing crops\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Japanese\n|\n|\n| Four Heavenly Kings\n|-\n|\n|\n| Four Great Heavenly Kings\n|-\n|Korean\n| /사천왕\n|\n| Four heavenly kings\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Vietnamese\n| 四天王\n|Tứ Thiên Vương\n| Four heavenly kings\n|-\n| 四大天王\n|Tứ Đại Thiên Vương\n| Four great heavenly kings\n|-\n|Tibetan\n|རྒྱལ༌ཆེན༌བཞི༌\n|rgyal chen bzhi\n| Four great kings\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Mongolian\n|Язгуурун дөрвөн их хаан\n|Yazguurun dörwön ix xaan (Ijaɣur-un dörben yeke qaɣan)\n| Four great kings of the root\n|-\n|ᠳᠥᠷᠪᠡᠨ ᠮᠠᠬᠠᠷᠠᠨᠽᠠ\nДөрвөн махранз\n|Dörwön maxranz (Dörben maqaranza)\n|Four great kings, loan word from mahārāja (Sanskrit)/mahārājan (Pali)\n|-\n|ᠣᠷᠴᠢᠯᠠᠩ ‍ᠢ ᠬᠠᠮᠠᠭᠠᠯᠠᠬᠤ ᠳᠥᠷᠪᠡᠨ ᠮᠠᠬᠠᠷᠠᠨᠽᠠ\nОрчлоныг хамгаалах дөрвөн махранз\n|Orchlonig xamgaalax dörwön maxranz\n(Orčilang-i qamaɣalaqu dörben maqaranza)\n|World-protecting four great kings\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Thai\n| จาตุมหาราชา\n| Chatumaharacha\n| Four Great Kings, loan word from catumahārāja (Pali)\n|-\n| จตุโลกบาล\n| Chatulokkaban\n| Four Guardians of the World, loan word from catulokapāla (Pali)\n|-\n|Pali\n|Catu-Mahārāja\n|Catu-Mahārāja\n|The Four Great Kings\n|}\nIndividually, they have different names and features.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Pali name\n|Vessavaṇa\n|Virūḷhaka\n|Dhataraṭṭha\n|Virūpakkha\n|-\n|DevanagariSanskrit romanization\n|वैश्रवण (कुबेर) (Kubera)\n|विरूढक\n|धृतराष्ट्र\n|विरूपाक्ष\n|-\n|Meaning\n|He who hears everything\n|He who causes to grow\n|He who upholds the realm\n|He who sees all\n|-\n|Control\n|yakṣas/yakkhas\n|kumbhāṇḍhas/kumbhaṇḍhas\n|gandharvas/gandhabbas\n|nāgas\n|-\n| Description\n| This is the chief of the four kings and protector of the north.

On the 8th, 14th and 15th days of each lunar month, the Kings either send out emissaries or go themselves to inspect the state of virtue and morality in the world of men. Then they report their findings to the assembly of the  devas.\nOn the orders of Śakra, the Kings and their retinues stand guard to protect  from another attack by the Asuras, which once threatened to destroy the realm of the devas. They also vowed to protect the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Buddha's followers from danger. In Chinese Buddhism, all four of the heavenly kings are regarded as four of the Twenty Devas (二十諸天 Èrshí Zhūtiān) or the Twenty-Four Devas (二十四諸天 Èrshísì zhūtiān), a group of Buddhist dharmapalas who manifest to protect the Dharma.\nin Beijing, China.]]\nAccording to Vasubandhu, devas born in the Cāturmahārājika heaven are 1/4 of a krośa in height (about 750 feet tall). They have a five-hundred-year lifespan, of which each day is equivalent to 50 years in our world; thus their total lifespan amounts to about nine million years (other sources say 90,000 years).\nThe attributes borne by each King also link them to their followers; for instance, the nāgas, magical creatures who can change form between human and serpent, are led by , represented by a snake; the gandharvas are celestial musicians, led by , represented with a lute. The umbrella was a symbol of regal sovereignty in ancient India, and the sword is a symbol of martial prowess. 's mongoose, which ejects jewels from its mouth, is said to represent generosity in opposition to greed.\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|\n|align = \"center\"|Vaiśravaṇa\n(north)\n|\n|-\n|align = \"center\"|Virūpākṣa\n(west)\n|align = \"center\"|Heavenly Kings\n|align = \"center\"|Dhṛtarāṣṭra\n(east)\n|-\n|\n|align = \"center\"|Virūḍhaka\n(south)\n|\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Lingyin temple 06.jpg|Duowen Tianwang (north)\nFile:Hangzhou-Lingyin-Tempel-04-Waechter-2012-gje.jpg|Zengzhang Tianwang (south)\nFile:Lingyin temple 04.jpg|Chiguo Tianwang (east)\nFile:Lingyin temple 07.jpg|Guangmu Tianwang (west)\nImage:Jikoji jikokuten.JPG|Jikoku-ten (east)\nImage:Jikoji zochoten.JPG|Zōjō-ten (south)\nImage:Jikoji komokuten.JPG|Kōmoku-ten (west)\nImage:Jikoji tamonten.JPG|Tamon-ten (north)\nPopular culture\nThe motif of the Four Heavenly Kings has been appropriated in secular contexts.
