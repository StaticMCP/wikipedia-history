Held six months after a three-part constitutional referendum, the election was reported as a success for Russian-backed candidate Akhmad Kadyrov, who reportedly won with 84% of the vote and 88% turnout.\nEarly candidates in the election besides Kadyrov included Aslambek Aslakhanov, Malik Saidullaev, and Umar Dzhabrailov. However, by the time of the election any significant candidates besides Kadyrov had dropped out. The election was marked by a lack of violent incidents, though among the incidents that did occur was a skirmish in Grozny and a mine clearing operation in Samashki. The election was boycotted by international monitors such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who argued that a free and fair election was impossible under Chechnya's conditions. Representatives of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Arab League, Organisation of the Islamic Conference, and the Commonwealth of Independent States assessed the vote, and Moscow Helsinki Group head Lyudmila Alexeyeva described the vote as free and fair, though she criticised the conditions of the vote as causing voters to fear retaliation for their votes. Despite claims by the Russian government to the contrary, several polling stations were reported as being empty by independent media.\nIn addition to residents of Chechnya, Russian soldiers and Chechen refugees in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia were permitted to vote.\nFew commentators within Chechen or Russian media spheres expected any significant change to emerge from the election, according to Reuters. The government of the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria rejected the results, with representative Akhmed Zakayev saying that \"Mr Kadyrov is, and will continue to be, an appointed head of the regime.\"\nResults\n|votes2=28823\n|cand3=Shamil Burayev|votes3=19694\n|cand5=Kudus Saduyev|votes5=7667\n|cand6=Nikolay Payzulayev|votes6=4387\n|cand7=Avkhat Khanchukayev|votes7=2688\n|row8=Against all|votes8=12906\n|invalid=19670\n|electorate=569347\n|source=Scilla\n}}\nReferences"
