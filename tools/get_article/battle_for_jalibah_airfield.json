At 6 a.m. the morning of 27 February, following an intensive artillery barrage, about 200 vehicles of the 2nd Brigade, under the command of Colonel Paul J. Kern, charged into the airfield and secured it after four hours of fighting.\nTwo thousand enemy soldiers, 80 anti-aircraft guns, and a tank battalion were knocked out of action in this brilliantly executed attack. The airfield fuel supplies and ammunition were blown up in a thunderous roar that could be heard for 30 kilometers (19 miles). 20 enemy aircraft were destroyed. Colonel Paul Kern and his Brigade had become the 'aces' of the campaign. Major General McCaffrey flew into the captured Jalibah airstrip to congratulate Colonel Kern of the 2nd Brigade's superb victory.\nAccording to 2nd Lieutenant Neal Creighton, Iraqi soldiers \"tried to hide in shallow bunkers and some tried to surrender. Most that moved were quickly cut down under a swath of machine gun fire. The burning helicopters, jets and dead soldiers seemed almost unreal. ... My soldiers were alive.\" Major David S. Pierson, who served as a task-force intelligence captain in the 2nd Brigade, said he eventually felt \"guilty that we had slaughtered them so; guilty that we had performed so well and they so poorly; guilty that we were running up the score. ... They were like children fleeing before us, unorganized, scared, wishing it all would end. We continued to pour it on.\"\nOnly one U.S. soldier, 2nd Lieutenant John Ford, was wounded by enemy fire during the battle. In the confusion, however, three U.S. M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles of C Company, 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment were accidentally hit with 5 depleted uranium rounds fired by the tanks of Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment. At the time, the Task Force was under indirect fire and were \"buttoned up.\"  The engagement took place using their thermal sights and the Bradleys of C Company were misidentified as retreating Iraqi vehicles.  They  fired  between 15 and 25 rounds at what they identified as Iraqi T-72 tanks. This friendly fire incident resulted in the 10 additional American casualties: two deaths and eight injuries.\nReferences\nNote"
