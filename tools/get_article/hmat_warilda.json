She was designed for the East-West Australian coastal service, but following the start of the First World War, she was converted into a troopship and later, in 1916, she was converted into a hospital ship.\nHer identical sister ships, also built by William Beardmore and Company, were  (1912) and SS Willochra (1913).\nTime as a troopship\n* 5 October 1915: 10th Reinforcements, 9th Battalion embarked from Brisbane heading to Egypt.: 15 Batt embarked Brisbane HMAT A69 Warilda same date\n* 8 October 1915: 10th Reinforcements, 1st Infantry Battalion embarked from Sydney heading to Egypt.\n* 8 October 1915: 10th Reinforcements, 1st Brigade of the AIF, embarked from Liverpool, NSW, Australia.

The Deputy Chief Controller of the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corp, Mrs Violet Long, lost her life in this action. Among the survivors was her commander, Captain Sim, who was later awarded the OBE by King George V. Her wreck lies in the English Channel.\nGallery\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110811081532/http://alh-research.tripod.com/Light_Horse/ Australian Light Horse Studies Centre] [http://alh-research.tripod.com/ships_lh.htm His Majesty's Australian Transports HMAT Ships], Transporting the 1st AIF.\n* [http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictoria/b/3/6/doc/b36884.shtml WARILDA picture by Green, Allan C.]\n* [http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-pa-HTTP%253A%252F%252FWWW.SLV.VIC.GOV.AU%252FPICTORIA%252FB%252F4%252F1%252FDOC%252FB41080.SHTML Photo at Picture Australia]"
