The song was a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 12, and No. 9 on the Canadian RPM charts.\nBackground\nStewart wrote the song with two band members: guitarist Jim Cregan and keyboardist Kevin Savigar. Stewart told Mojo magazine in 1995 that he considered \"Forever Young\" to be one of his favorite songs, and the reason for writing it was, \"I love 'Forever Young' because that was a real heartfelt song about my kids. I suddenly realized I'd missed a good five years of Sean and Kimberly's life because I was so busy touring all the time. With these kids now I don't make that mistake -- I take them on tour with me, so I can watch them grow up. So that's another favorite. Unfortunately, it wasn't a big hit in England, but it's like a national anthem here [America].\"\nThe structure of the lyrics in this song was similar enough to a Bob Dylan song of the same title that, after its completion, the song was then sent to Dylan, asking whether he had a problem with it. The two men agreed to participate in the ownership of the song and share Stewart's royalties.\nIn January 1989, immediately following the broadcast of Super Bowl XXIII, NBC Sports used \"Forever Young\" as the soundtrack for a year-in-review montage showcasing highlights from four events NBC had broadcast over the previous year: the 1988 Summer Olympics, the 1988 World Series, the 1989 Fiesta Bowl, and Super Bowl XXIII.\nStewart recorded a more mellow version of the song for his 1996 compilation album If We Fall in Love Tonight, and a version featuring just Stewart's voice with piano accompaniment can be found on the 2009 compilation album The Rod Stewart Sessions 1971-1998. A live version was recorded during his MTV Unplugged session in 1993. Though not included on the original release of the live album Unplugged...and Seated, this version was later released as a bonus track on the Collector's Edition of the album released by Rhino Records in 2009. Another live version of the song from his 2013 performance at The Troubadour, West Hollywood was included on the deluxe edition of the album Time.\nMusic video\nThe video for this song features Stewart singing to a child, played by Alex Zuckerman, while scenes of rural America pass by. It was filmed on Potrero Road in Hidden Valley, Ventura County, California.\nChart history\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Chart (1988)\n!
