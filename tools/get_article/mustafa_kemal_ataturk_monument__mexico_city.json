The statue of Atatürk is 3.2 m in length and weighing approximately 1.5 tonnes.\nHistory\nAlthough it was completed by Azerbaijani sculptor Səid Rüstəm in 2000 with the initiative of the Confederation of Employers' Unions of Turkey, the erection of the statue to the relevant region was delayed due to various reasons. To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, it was opened with a ceremony on 29 October 2003. Labor and Social Security Minister Murat Başesgioğlu, National Defence Minister Vecdi Gönül, and State Minister Güldal Akşit also attended the ceremony from Turkey.\nReferences"
