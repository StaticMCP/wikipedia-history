They both won the award for Karan Johar's My Name Is Khan, who also won Best Director.\nSisters Ratna Pathak Shah and Supriya Pathak were nominated for Best Supporting Actress for their performances in Golmaal 3 and Khichdi: The Movie respectively, but both lost to Kareena Kapoor who won the award for We Are Family.\nAwards and nominees\nMain awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\" | Best Film\n! style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\" | Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Dabangg – Arbaaz Khan'\n**Band Baaja Baaraat – Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra\n**My Name Is Khan – Hiroo Johar, Gauri Khan\n**Peepli Live – Aamir Khan\n**Udaan – Ronnie Screwvala, Anurag Kashyap, Sanjay Singh\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Karan Johar – My Name Is Khan'\n** Abhinav Kashyap – Dabangg\n** Maneesh Sharma – Band Baaja Baaraat\n** Sanjay Leela Bhansali – Guzaarish\n** Vikramaditya Motwane – Udaan\n** Milan Luthria – Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai\n|-\n!
