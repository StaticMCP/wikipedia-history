Honorees are drawn from diverse backgrounds, including the worlds of journalism, academics, business, science, entertainment, philanthropy and law.\nBackground\nThe award is named in honor of Rachel Carson, the undisputed founder of the modern environmental movement. Each year the Rachel Carson Award is created by Tiffany & Company. The Rachel Carson Awards Council was founded by Allison Whipple Rockefeller in 2004.\nThe award is presented to honorees each May at the Rachel Carson Award Luncheon, held annually at New York City's Plaza Hotel. Proceeds from the luncheon support Audubon's Long Island Sound Campaign, the Sound having undergone unprecedented pollution, habitat loss, and ecosystem disruption in recent years.\nAudubon's Women in Conservation Program, in conjunction with Audubon's Rachel Carson Awards Council, supports a website which connects women to leaders in the environmental movement and to pressing environmental issues. Audubon's Women in Conservation also supports an internship program and hosts an educational school panel in which past Rachel Carson Award honorees speak at a local all-girls school.\nAward recipients\n2004 to 2009\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Name\n!Role\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2004\n|Jayni Chase\n|Environmental activist, philanthropist\n|-\n|Lynn Chase\n|Wildlife artist, philanthropist\n|-\n|Maria Rodale\n|Rodale Publishing, chairman\n|-\n|Peggy M.
