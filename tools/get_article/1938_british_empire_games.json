Held in Sydney, Australia, from 5–12 February 1938, they were timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia). Venues included the Sydney Cricket Ground (the main stadium), the North Sydney Olympic Pool and Henson Park. An estimated 40,000 people attended the opening ceremony. A men's residential village was established within the grounds of the Sydney Showground, while the female athletes were housed in hotels.\nThe star of the games was the Australian athlete Decima Norman, who won five gold medals in track and field. Margaret Dovey, later married to Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam, finished sixth in the 220 yards breaststroke.\nDue to the onset of World War II, the games were not held again until 1950.\nParticipating teams\nCountries that participated\n*  (host)\n*\n*\n*\n* 23px Ceylon\n*\n*\n* 23px India\n*\n*\n*\n* 23px South Africa\n*\n*\n*\nMedals by country\n| gold_SAF = 10 | silver_SAF = 10 | bronze_SAF = 6 | name_SAF =\n| gold_NZL = 5 | silver_NZL = 7 | bronze_NZL = 13\n| gold_WAL = 2 | silver_WAL = 1 | bronze_WAL = 0 | name_WAL =\n| gold_CEY = 1 | silver_CEY = 0 | bronze_CEY = 0 | name_CEY =\n| gold_SCO = 0 | silver_SCO = 2 | bronze_SCO = 3\n| gold_BGU = 0 | silver_BGU = 1 | bronze_BGU = 0 | name_BGU =\n| gold_SRH = 0 | silver_SRH = 0 | bronze_SRH = 2\n}}\nSports\n*\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nVenues\nSporting\n*Sydney Cricket Ground (athletics)\n*Sydney Sports Ground (athletics)\n*North Sydney Olympic Pool (swimming and diving)\n*Henson Park, Marrickville (cycling, track)\n*Centennial Park (cycling, road)\n*Nepean River, Penrith (rowing)\n*Rushcutters Bay Stadium (boxing and wrestling)\n*Waverley Bowls Club, Waverley (lawn bowls)\nOther\n*Sydney Cricket Ground (opening ceremony)\n*Sydney Showground (men's village)\n*Lapstone Hill Hotel, Lapstone (rowing athletes)\n*Centennial Park (closing ceremony)\nSee also\n* 2000 Summer Olympics at Sydney, Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.commonwealthsport.com/commonwealth-games/sydney-1938 \"Sydney 1938\"].
