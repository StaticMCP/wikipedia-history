It was released on August 6, 2002 on Greedy Green Entertainment and Mo Beatz. The album was originally titled The Kingdom Come and was slated for a release on June 30, 1998, on Aftermath Entertainment. The 1998 version was to be King Tee's first release of new material in three years after allying with Dr. Dre and appearing on his compilation, Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath. King Tee's album was later put on hold. His shelved album had already been rated three and a half stars out of five by The Source, which was \"not good enough\" for Dr. Dre,[http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2002_12_thykingdom.html King T :: Thy Kingdom Come :: Greedy Green Entertainment] but King Tee maintained a positive relationship with Dr. Dre. He even appeared on Dr. Dre's album, 2001, in 1999. By 2002, The Kingdom Come was released under its new name Thy Kingdom Come to mixed opinions and was a commercial failure. It had no charting singles, and it did not chart as an album. The album has been released in some places under the original name \"The Kingdom Come\" with an alternative album cover. The song \"Speak On It\" also appeared on San Andreas: The Original Mixtape, an album by King T's protégé Young Maylay.\nDespite its challenging history of release and commercial success, it is officially available on streaming.\nTrack listing\nAdditional Information\nOn the 2002 release of The Kingdom Come, many song and personnel names are spelled differently:\n*King Tee is credited as King T (Though he is credited as King T on all his songs on the aftermath)\n*DJ Quik is credited as DJ Quick\n*Shaquille O'Neal is credited as Shaquille O'Neil in \"Shake da Spot\", which samples the talk box from \"California Love\", and interpolates lyrics for \"Straight Outta Compton\".\n*Bud'da is credited as Budda\n*Playa Hamm is credited as Playa Ham\n*Stu-B-Doo is credited as Stu\n*Sharief is credited as Killa Ben\n*\"Squeeze Yo Balls\" is credited as \"Skweez Ya Ballz\"\n*\"Money\" is credited as \"Monay\"\n*\"The Chron\" is credited as \"Da 'Kron\" and samples skits from Snoop Dogg's \"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\".\n*\"Real Raw\" is credited as \"Reel Raw\"\n*\"2 G's From Compton\" samples the background chorus vocals from Snoop Dogg's \"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\".\n*The beat of \"6 N 'Na Moe'nin\" was later released in \"Zoom\" by LL Cool J feat.
