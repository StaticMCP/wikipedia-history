The colonies (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia) started the war because they didn’t want to be ruled by the king of England, which at the time was King George III. In 1781, after years of fighting in the war, the 13 colonies won! In 1776, 5 men had finished writing an essay. It is in Washington D.C., where you can see it being displayed in a museum. This declaration is called The Declaration of Independence. It is 248 years old. July 4th is Independence Day because the declaration of independence was finished that day. And to this day, we are a free country because so many risked their lives for freedom and we should thank them with all of our hearts. They gave something HUGE to us, we should do the same to them as a thanks gift from all of us."
