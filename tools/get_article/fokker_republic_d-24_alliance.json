The project was based out of Schiphol, Netherlands, and led by Alexander Wadkowski of Republic Aviation.\nDesign\nThe D.24 was designed to be capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and was designed in accordance with NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 and competed in NATO's BMR-3 military project bidding. Only a scale model was built and is now located at the Luchtvaartmuseum Aviodrome in Lelystad, Netherlands.\nSpecifications\n|eng1 type=vectored-thrust turbofan engine\n|eng1 kn=\n|eng1 note=for lift/cruise\n|eng2 number=\n|eng2 name=\n|eng2 type=\n|eng2 kn=\n|eng2 note=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed note=\n|max speed mach=1.5 at sea level, Mach 2.4 at 70,000 feet\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km= 4828\n|range note=\n|combat range km=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=21336\n|ceiling note=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\n*List of VTOL aircraft\nReferences"
