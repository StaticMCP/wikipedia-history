It is unusual in that it is linked by pathway to a German cemetery, the Saint-Désir-de-Lisieux German war cemetery. Half way that path, there is a small memorial with flagpoles flying British, French, German and EU colours. There were 520 Commonwealth graves until 78 graves were reinterred from Chartres after the war. A large number of soldiers from the 51st (Highland) Division are buried at St. Désir and four victims of the First World War.\nReferences"
