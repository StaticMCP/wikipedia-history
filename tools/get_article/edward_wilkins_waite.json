Edward Waite, MA, and his wife Cleopha Julia (née Dukes) – there were six sons and two daughters in total. His grandfather William Watkin Waite was a miniaturist, his father an amateur watercolourist, and three of his brothers – Charles, Harold and Arthur – also became artists.\nHe was educated at the Mansion House Grammar School in Leatherhead. In 1874 he travelled to Ontario, Canada, to work as a lumberjack. On his return he took up painting as a profession, exhibiting often at the Royal Academy, London, from 1878 to 1919. He also exhibited at many other major galleries, in London and the regions, and became a member of the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA) in 1893.\nIn 1891, Waite married Barbara Isabella Tait (1862–1950). They had one son and two daughters. They lived at Peaslake and Abinger Hammer, in Surrey, before moving to Woolhampton in Berkshire in 1910. They moved back to Surrey and then East Sussex in 1915. Waite died in Fittleworth, Sussex, in 1924.\nWaite was a landscape painter and worked in oils. Much of his output depicts rural scenes in his native Surrey.\nExternal links and references\n*[http://www.burlington.co.uk/cgi-bin/biography.pl?artistID=278 E W Waite biography] (Burlington Paintings)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110710142037/http://www.dnfa.com/catalogues/12875.pdf E W Waite and family - paintings] (Dreweatt Neate auctioneers catalogue, 24 Oct 2007)\n*[http://www.burlington.co.uk/cgi-bin/gallery-artist.pl?artistID=278&firstname=Edward%20Wilkins&surname=Waite Paintings by E W Waite] (Burlington Paintings)\n*[http://www.myartprints.co.uk/a/waite-edward-wilkins.html Paintings by E W Waite] (\"My Art Prints\")\n*[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4306870 At Peaslake] (Oil on canvas, 1897 - Christie's)\n*[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5296202 A view to the sea] (Oil on canvas - Christie's)\n*[http://artondemand.museumofcroydon.com/art/293359/Cornfield_Harvest Cornfield harvest]  (Oil on canvas - Croydon Museum)\n*[http://www.boltonmuseums.org.uk/collections/art/objects/19252?term=paintings&s_tags=&sort_by=Title&item_number=9&b_start:int=0 An autumn moonrise] (oil on canvas - Bolton museum and archive service)"
