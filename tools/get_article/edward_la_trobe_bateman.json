He worked in Australia from 1852 to 1869, and had links with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\nLife\nBateman was probably born in Lower Wyke, Yorkshire, the son of John Bateman, a manufacturer, and his wife Mary (née) La Trobe. His brothers were John Frederick Bateman, the hydraulic engineer, and Christian Henry Bateman, an Anglican Church minister and a composer of hymns. His nephew Benjamin Latrobe was a notable architect, and a cousin Charles Latrobe was first lieutenant-governor of the colony of the state of Victoria in Australia.\nIn 1924, his grandson Charles La Trobe donated 12 artworks by Bateman to the state. The pencil sketches were of La Trobe's Cottage and its grounds.\nBateman had lived in London where he had been engaged to the daughter of William and Mary Howitt. When Bateman visited Australia, he stayed initially with Godfrey Howitt.\nIn 1856, the Carlton Gardens in Melbourne were redesigned and Edward la Trobe Bateman was engaged to do the designs. The path layout and other features were built, although limitations on funding for maintenance resulted in frequent criticism.\nHe died in Rothesay, Scotland, where he had lived after leaving Australia in 1870.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=qHw1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=tpYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7010,3229806&dq=edward-la-trobe-bateman&hl=en Edward La Trobe Bateman: An Interesting Old-time Personality] The Age\n*[http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/catalogues/artist/10883/edward-la-trobe-bateman.aspx?related=work Edward LaTrobe Bateman: Prints and Printmaking, 71 works ]"
