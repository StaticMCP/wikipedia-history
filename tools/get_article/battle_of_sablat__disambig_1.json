The battle was fought between a Roman Catholic Imperial army led by Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy and the Protestant army of Ernst von Mansfeld.\nWhen Mansfeld was on his way to reinforce general Hohenlohe, who was besieging České Budějovice, Bucquoy intercepted Mansfeld near the small village of Záblatí (), about  km northwest of České Budějovice, and brought him to battle. Mansfeld suffered defeat, losing at least 1,500 infantry and his baggage train. As a result, the Bohemians had to lift the siege of České Budějovice.\nSources\n* Parker, Geoffrey.
