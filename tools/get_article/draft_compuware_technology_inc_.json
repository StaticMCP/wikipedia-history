Compuware Corporation historically specialized in mainframe software and IT services, and was acquired by BMC Software in 2020. In contrast, Compuware Technology Inc. is a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer established in 2004, focusing on power solutions and hardware.\nA trademark dispute arose concerning the \"COMPUWARE\" name, which ultimately led to Compuware Technology Inc. redesigning its logo in 2019 and 2020 to differentiate its branding.\nReferences"
