Alan was the winner.\nBake for Your Afterlife: For the final, the bakers made ornate layer cakes that illustrated their most feared way to die. As the winner of the Haunted Heat, Alan received an advantage; he could choose his theme from all options written by the competitors and assign themes to his opponents.
