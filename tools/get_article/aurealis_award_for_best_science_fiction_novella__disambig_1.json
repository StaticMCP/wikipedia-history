To qualify, a work must have been first published by an Australian citizen or permanent resident between 1 January and 31 December of the corresponding year; the presentation ceremony is held the following year. It has grown from a small function of around 20 people to a two-day event attended by over 200 people.\nSince their creation in 1995, awards have been given in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have attracted the attention of publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to be taken seriously.\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from a list of submitted nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short-list of finalists. Ties can occur if the panel decides both entries show equal merit, however they are encouraged to choose a single winner. The judges are selected from a public application process by the Award's management team.\nThis article lists all the short-list nominees and winners in the best science fiction novella category. Stephanie Gunn, Garth Nix, and T. R. Napper are tied in the record for most wins (one) and nominations (three).\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the story's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\nWinners and joint winners\nNominees on the shortlist\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\"|Year\n! width=\"20%\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"35%\"|Novella\n! width=\"34%\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"By Frogsled and Lizardback to Outcast Venusian Lepers\" || Random House (Old Venus) ||\n|-\n|  || \"Blood and Ink\" || Prizm Books ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || ''Asimovs' Science Fiction ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"Salto Mortal\" || Lightspeed (#73) ||\n|-\n|  || Waking in Winter || PS Publishing ||\n|-\n|  || \"Going Viral\" || Dimension6 (#8) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Seizure Press ||\n|-\n|  || \"All the Colours of the Tomato\" || Dimension6 (#9) ||\n|-\n|  || \"Did We Break the End of the World?\" || Twelfth Planet Press (Defying Doomsday) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || Girl Reporter || (self-published) ||\n|-\n|  || \"This Silent Sea\" || Review of Australian Fiction (Vol 24 No 6) ||\n|-\n|  || \"I Can See the Ending\" || HarperCollins Australia (Begin, End, Begin: A #LoveOzYA Anthology) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Ticonderoga Publications (Ecopunk!) ||\n|-\n|  || \"Island Green\" || Ticonderoga Publications (Ecopunk!) ||\n|-\n|  || Matters Arising from the Identification of the Body || Peggy Bright Books ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"Pinion\" || Ticonderoga Publications (Aurum) ||\n|-\n|  || \"I Almost Went to the Library Last Night\" || Ticonderoga Publications (Aurum) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || eMergent Publishing ||\n|-\n|  || Icefall'' || Twelfth Planet Press ||\n|-\n|  || \"Singles' Day\" || Interzone (#277) ||\n|-\n|  || Static Ruin || Tor.com ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"'Scapes Made Diamond\" || Interzone (#280) ||\n|-\n|  || \"Ventiforms\" || ''Asimov's Science Fiction ||\n|-\n|  || \"You Will Remember Who You Were\" || Dimension6 (#16) ||\n|-\n|  || Prisoncorp || Seizure, an imprint of Brio Books||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n|*\n|\"\"\n|Grimdark Magazine (Neon Leviathan)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Jigsaw Children\"\n|Clarkesworld (#161)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Generation Gap\"\n|Clarkesworld (#161)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Dingo & Sister\"\n|Andromeda Spaceways Magazine (#78)\n|\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |\n|\n|\"Preserved in Amber\"\n|Clarkesworld (#178)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Access Denied\"\n|Aurealis (#142)\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|Merino\n|-\n|\n|\"\"\n|World Weaver Press (Multispecies Cities: Solarpunk Urban Futures)\n|-\n|\n|\"Problem Landing\"\n|Analog (March/April 2021)\n|-\n|\n|\"\"\n|F&SF (Nov/Dec 2021)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" |\n|Amanda Cool\n|Resembling Lepus\n|Grey Matter Press\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|T.
