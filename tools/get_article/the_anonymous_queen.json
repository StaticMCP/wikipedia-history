Produced by Ditirambo Films and Lola Films, the film boasted a 250 million ₧ budget. Filming began on 25 May 1992. Regarding the labelling of his film, Suárez stated that he was \"not interested in discussing what La reina anónima is. I usually say it is a tragedy disguised as a comedy, or a psychological drama. But in the end they are nothing more than jests\".\nRelease\nThe film screened in the Golden Shell competition of the 40th San Sebastián International Film Festival in September 1992. It was released theatrically in Spain on 16 October 1992.\nReception\nÁngel Fernández-Santos of El País assessed that despite the film boasting certain assets such as \"expressionist sets\", \"excellent craft on the part of the cast\", and \"a dense and brilliant literary base\", it has \"little, if any, sense of ellipsis\", thus damaging the whole.\nAccolades\n|-\n|  || 7th Goya Awards || Best Costume Design || Yvonne Blake ||  ||\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Spanish films of 1992\nReferences"
