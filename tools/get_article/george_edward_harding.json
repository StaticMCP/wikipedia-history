In association with his partner William Tyson Gooch, he is best known as designer of several early skyscrapers in New York.\nLife and career\nGeorge Edward Harding was born in Bath, Maine in 1843. He was educated as an engineer at Columbia University.\nIn 1872 Harding began practice as an associate of architect Arthur Gilman. Harding left in 1880 to establish his own office. He practiced alone until circa 1886, when he formed a short-lived partnership with Frederick P. Dinkelberg. This was dissolved in January, 1888. In 1889 he became associated with William Tyson Gooch, practicing as George Edward Harding & Company. They formed a partnership in 1890, which was known as George Edward Harding & Gooch.\nIn 1902 the partnership was dissolved. Harding continued to practice independently for several years but was obliged to retire several years before his death due to his declining health. Harding died in 1907 in Passaic, New Jersey.\nLegacy\nHarding is notable as the designer of several of the early skyscrapers in New York City, projects probably obtained through his training as an engineer. He was also the designer of a number of cottages at Newport and elsewhere. At least one of his buildings has been listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places, and others have been designated New York City Landmarks.\nArchitectural works\n* Remodeling of and additions to the Brunswick Hotel, New York, New York (1881, demolished 1906)\n* \"Inchiquin\" for John O'Brien, Newport, Rhode Island (1886)\n* \"Oak View\" for William H.
