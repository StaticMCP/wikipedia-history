It is the first time any Dominican Republic team has qualified for a FIFA World Cup at any age level or gender. In the semifinal match, the Dominican team defeated Guatemala 4–2 in a penalty shootout after a 2–2 draw, securing a spot in the 2024 Summer Olympic games in Paris. In the final match, fortune was not on the side of the Dominican Republic when they lost 6–0 against the United States, even so, the sensation in the entire region about the Caribbean country was excellent because soccer is not the main sport in the Dominican Republic. It was a pleasant surprise for everyone to see the talent and potential of the Dominican players as they became Concacaf Runners-up.\n2023\nThe Dominican Under-20 Soccer Team settled on April 16 in Jerez, Spain, where they participated in the \"Road to Youth World Cup\" competition where they played three friendly matches against the U-20 teams of Brazil, Iraq and Uzbekistan as part of the final phase of their preparation for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.\nThe Dominican Under-20 National Team participated in its first U-20 World Cup in 2023, a tournament that was held in Argentina. It would be placed in Group D along with historical teams such as Italy, Brazil and Nigeria. The Dominican Republic would have his debut on May 21 against Nigeria in the city of Mendoza, he would start winning with a goal of Edison Azcona at minute 21, later the African team would come back from the game ending this with a score of 2–1, despite the defeat the performance of the Dominican team was acceptable being a rookie team in the tournament and also considered as the weak team of the group. Their second commitment would be against the five-time world champion of the category, Brazil, in this match the superiority of the South American team would be notorious, defeating the Dominican team by a score of 6-0. This result forced the Dominican Republic to win on the last group date against Italy and wait for other results to qualify as one of the best third parties. However, the Dominican team succumbed to the Europeans and would be defeated 3–0, being eliminated in the first round in their first World Cup experience.\nCompetitive record\nCONCACAF U-20 Championship\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|CONCACAF U-20 Championship record\n|-\n!Year\n!Result\n!Position\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n|-\n| 1962\n|colspan=\"9\" rowspan=\"4\"|Did not enter\n|-\n| 1964\n|-\n| 1970\n|-\n| 1973\n|-\n| 1974\n|Group Stage\n|11th of 12\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|1\n|8\n|-\n| 1976\n|Second round\n|7th of 15\n|6\n|1\n|0\n|5\n|7\n|31\n|-\n| 1978\n|First round\n|11th of 13\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|14\n|-\n| 1980\n|Group Stage\n|14th of 18\n|3\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|2\n|6\n|-\n| 1982\n|colspan=\"9\" rowspan=\"2\"|Did not enter\n|-\n| 1984\n|-\n| 1986\n|colspan=\"9\" rowspan=\"16\"|Did not qualify\n|-\n| 1988\n|-\n| 1990\n|-\n| 1992\n|-\n| 1994\n|-\n| 1996\n|-\n|  1998\n|-\n|  2001\n|-\n|  2003\n|-\n|  2005\n|-\n|  2007\n|-\n| 2009\n|-\n| 2011\n|-\n| 2013\n|-\n| 2015\n|-\n| 2017\n|-\n| 2018\n|Group Stage\n|9th of 34\n|5\n|3\n|0\n|2\n|23\n|10\n|-\n| 2020\n|colspan=\"9\" |Cancelled\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 2022\n|Runner-up\n|2nd of 20\n|4\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|8\n|6\n|-\n| 2024\n|Group Stage\n|10th of 12\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|2\n|7\n|-\n!Total||Runner-up ||7/29||26||7||1||18||43||82\n|}\nU-20 World Cup\nFIFA U-20 World Cup\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=9|FIFA U-20 World Cup record\n|-\n!Year\n!Round\n!Position\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n| 1977|| colspan=\"8\" rowspan=\"22\" |did not qualify\n|-\n| 1979\n|-\n| 1981\n|-\n| 1983\n|-\n| 1985\n|-\n| 1987\n|-\n| 1989\n|-\n| 1991\n|-\n| 1993\n|-\n| 1995\n|-\n| 1997\n|-\n| 1999\n|-\n| 2001\n|-\n| 2003\n|-\n| 2005\n|-\n| 2007\n|-\n| 2009\n|-\n| 2011\n|-\n| 2013\n|-\n| 2015\n|-\n| 2017\n|-\n| 2019\n|-\n| 2021|| colspan=\"8\" |Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n| 2023\n|Group Stage\n|23rd\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|1\n|11\n|-\n| 2025|| colspan=\"8\" |did not qualify\n|-\n| 2027|| colspan=\"8\"|To be determined\n|-\n!Total||Group stage||1/25||3||0||0||3||1||11\n|}\nFixtures and recent results\nThe following is a list of match results from the previous 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n2022\n|time       = 18:30\n|team1      =\n|score      = 4–5\n|team2      =\n|goals1     =\n*Gil\n*Arévalo\n*Esquivel\n|goals2     =\n*Boatwright\n*Gomez\n*Montes de Oca\n*Azcona\n|stadium    = Estadio Nacional, Tegucigalpa\n|attendance =\n|referee    = Said Martínez (Honduras)\n|report     = https://www.concacaf.com/en/men-s-under-20/game-details?matchid=623477\n|result     = W\n}}\n|time       = 17:00\n|team1      =\n|score      = 1–0\n|team2      =\n|goals1     = Montes de Oca\n|goals2     =\n|stadium    = Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano, San Pedro Sula\n|attendance =\n|referee    = Reon Radix (Grenada)\n|report     = https://www.concacaf.com/en/men-s-under-20/game-details?matchid=623485\n|result     = W\n}}\n|time       = 20:00\n|team1      =\n|score      = 2–2\n|aet        = yes\n|team2      =\n|goals1     =\n*De Peña\n*Azcona\n|goals2     =\n*Ordoñez\n*Mañón\n|penalties1 =\n*Jungbauer\n*Montes de Oca\n*Azcona\n*De Peña\n*María\n|penaltyscore = 4–2\n|penalties2 =\n* Gaitán\n* Cardoza\n* Franco\n* Ordoñez\n|location   = San Pedro Sula, Honduras\n|stadium    = Estadio Morazán\n|attendance =\n|referee    = Daneon Parchment (Jamaica)\n|report     = https://www.concacaf.com/en/men-s-under-20/game-details?matchid=623489\n|result     = W\n}}\n|time       = 17:00\n|team1      =\n|score      = 6–0\n|team2      =\n|goals1     =\n*Wolff\n*Aaronson\n*Allen\n*McGlynn\n*Tsakiris\n|goals2     =\n|stadium    = Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano, San Pedro Sula\n|attendance =\n|referee    = Drew Fischer (Canada)\n|report     = https://www.concacaf.com/en/men-s-under-20/game-details?matchid=623490\n|result     = L\n}}\n2023\n|time       = 15:00\n|team1      =\n|score      = 2–1\n|team2      =\n|goals1     =\n*De Peña\n*Sam.
