This included rapid deployment of warships and military aircraft, billions in military aid, expedited weapons shipments —including guided missiles, artillery shells, and advanced defense systems. The U.S. repeatedly vetoed multiple UN ceasefire resolutions and shielded Israel from international legal scrutiny even as civilian casualties in Gaza mounted and humanitarian conditions worsened.\nDespite internal State Department reports documenting more than 500 potential violations of international law by Israel, no action was taken. White House lawyers rejected internal findings that Israel was deliberately blocking humanitarian aid. Protests erupted nationwide, including resignations from over a dozen U.S. officials, and large-scale demonstrations on university campuses and outside defense contractors. Legal experts, lawmakers, and rights groups have cited violations of the Leahy Law and Foreign Assistance Act, urging the Biden administration to stop arming Israel.\nAfter an initial period of Western support for the offensive, Israel and the United States became increasingly isolated amid growing worldwide calls for a ceasefire, with the US vetoing three United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for a humanitarian ceasefire. International rights groups have condemned the U.S. for providing military and diplomatic support to Israel that they say risks complicity in Israeli war crimes.\nAs the war went on, tensions between the Israeli government and the Biden administration began to grow. The US government became more publicly critical of Israel as Palestinian civilian casualties rose and opposition grew. In February 2024, the Biden administration issued a national security directive requiring written assurances from Israel that it was using US-supplied weapons in line with international law. In March 2024, the US began calling for an immediate and sustained ceasefire linked to the release of hostages, and Israel berated the US for allowing a ceasefire resolution to pass at the UN Security Council. The US also voiced its opposition to much of Israel's post-war plan for Gaza. Despite this, however, American weapons transfers to Israel continued.\nBackground\n, 1946–2022]]\nAfter Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, resulting in the death of 1,139 Israelis, 695 of which were civilians, Israel began a campaign against Gaza.\nSince the start of the Israeli operation, more than 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, of whom 52% of identified were women and children.\nSeveral thousand more are missing and presumed trapped under rubble. Israel placed Gaza under a complete blockade, including the prevention of fuel and water from entering the Gaza Strip. The United States described Hamas' preemptive attack as \"unprovoked,\" and started sending warships and warplanes into the region, prepared to give Israel whatever it needs. Civil rights groups such as the Center for Constitutional Rights meanwhile called on the government to address the underlying issues that have led to the recent violence, such as Israel's 56-year illegal possession of the Palestinian lands and its 16-year blockade of Gaza as well as \"the apartheid regime throughout historic Palestine\".\nFollowing Israel's victory over surrounding Arab forces in the 1967 Six-Day War and its subsequent occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, military assistance to the country surged significantly. The Iron Dome, which became operational in 2011, was created with the help of the United States, which is responsible for providing components for the system, including allocating more than $1.5 billion for missile defense for Israel in 2022.\nAs part of a record $38 billion agreement over ten years negotiated under former US President Barack Obama in 2016, US military aid to Israel exceeded $3.8 billion in 2023. Of this $3.8 billion, half a billion was for Israel's missile defense. Washington has announced that it will replenish Israel's ammunition used in the recent war against Hamas.\nMilitary support\ndelivering remarks on Hamas's attack on Israel, October 2023.]]\nWeapons transfers\nThe Biden administration caused controversy after bypassing Congress on multiple occasions to authorize arms sales to the Israeli military. Unlike the United States' military support for Ukraine, details of weapons sent to Israel have been vague. Leaked details have shown that the U.S. has sent laser-guided missiles, 155mm shells, new army vehicles, among others, at Israel's request. According to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the United States spent $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel from October 2023 to October 2024.\nIn December 2023, the WSJ report stated that US arms shipments to Israel since the start of the war included 15,000 bombs and 57,000 155mm artillery shells. The United States also delivered 100 BLU-109 bunker buster bombs, 5,000 unguided Mk82 bombs, more than 5,400 Mk84 bombs, about 1,000 small diameter GBU-39 bombs, and approximately 3,000 JDAM guidance kits.\nAn investigation by The Guardian found the U.S. government was using special mechanisms to protect Israel from domestic human rights laws to continue sending weapons. Following a trip to Washington D.C. in June 2024, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant addressed Israeli complaints about slowed arms transfers, stating, \"Obstacles were removed and bottlenecks were addressed\". A report by ProPublica found the U.S. State Department had ignored reports about potential human rights violations by the Israeli army to continue weapons transfers to Israel. Current and former State Department officials stated there were more than 500 reports of Israel using U.S. weapons to cause \"unnecessary harm to civilians\" in the Gaza Strip, but that no action had yet been taken on any of the reports.\nUnnamed officials stated in March 2024 that the U.S. had signed off on an additional 1,800 MK84 2,000-pound bombs and 500 MK82 500-pound bombs. In May 2024, Israel used two U.S.-made GBU-39 missiles during the Tel al-Sultan massacre. GBU-39 bombs were also identified in other attacks on dense civilian areas, including the Al-Sardi school attack and the Al-Tabaeen school attack. In June 2024, two U.S. officials stated the United States had transferred ten thousand 2,000-pound bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles to Israel since 7 October. In late-June 2024, an Israeli official stated the Biden administration would soon transfer a delayed shipment of 500 pound bombs to Israel. In mid-July 2024, a U.S. official confirmed that the United States was resuming its transfers of 500 pound bombs to Israel.\nIn August 2024, the Biden administration approved a $20 billion arms sale to Israel, including  F-15 fighter jets and tank and mortar shells. The United States approved a $165 million sale of military tank trailers, including replacement parts, tool kits, and logistics support.\nNaval and air support\nThe United States has provided naval and aerial support to Israel on multiple occasions since October 2023. In April 2024, U.S. fighter jets, along with the U.K., France, and Jordan, shot down Iranian drones and missiles directed at Israel. In June 2024, the United States sent the USS Wasp and its marines aboard to serve as a deterrent to Hezbollah in its conflict with Israel. In August 2024, the United States deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, equipped with stealth F-35C Lightning II combat jets, and the ballistic missile submarine USS Georgia, to Israel.\nIn October 2024, the United States deployed the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, along with 100 U.S. troops to Israel. That same month, an investigation using available open source data found that U.S. aircraft were responsible for 33 percent of reconnaissance flights, providing Israel with intelligence on ground movements in the Gaza Strip. In November 2024, the United States ordered ballistic missile defense destroyers, a fighter squadron, tanker aircraft, and Air Force B-52 long-range strike bombers to \"make clear\" to Iran that the U.S. would \"take every measure necessary to defend\" its interests in the region.\nIn response to the United States's involvement, U.S. Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Cori Bush wrote a letter to the Biden Administration asking for an explanation as to the country's participation in Israel's military engagements and suggesting such collaboration was unauthorized and unconstitutional.\nFinancial support\nThe United States has provided $9 billion in loan guarantees to Israel. Israel has also issued $5 billion of debt in the U.S. during the war with state and local governments making up a large portion of the purchases. Karen Wells et al. point to the billions in financial support as evidence of US complicity in Israel's \"genocidal war\". Research in 2024 showed that Israel's military relies heavily on fuel imports from the US for its operations in Gaza. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, said the United States' provision of fuel to Israel after the ICJ's provisional ruling was \"a breach of the Genocide Convention\".\nAs of April 2024, state and local governments in the U.S. had purchased $1.7 billion in Israel Bonds since 7 October 2023. States which have purchased Israel bonds during the war include Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New York, and Texas. Palm Beach County in Florida has purchased almost $700 million in Israel bonds during the war, leading residents to file a lawsuit against the county comptroller Joseph Abruzzo for allegedly violating his fiduciary duty.\nOn 6 February 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14203 imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) due to its arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. In June 2025, the United States imposed financial sanctions on four ICC judges including two who were part of the investigation of Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. The US also imposed financial sanctions on Francesca Albanese after she issued a report on corporate involvement in the Gaza war. On 20 August 2025, the US sanctioned ICC judge Nicolas Guillou for authorizing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. The US also sanctioned ICC prosecutors Nazhat Shameem Khan and Mame Mandiaye Niang for continuing to investigate Israel.\nProtests\n's office in Goleta, California to protest the military contractor's supply of weapons to Israel, 9 November 2023]]\nJosh Paul, a senior State Department official specializing in arms transfers, resigned after stating the U.S. government continues to sell weapons to Israel despite its record of human rights abuses.\n\"Direct action\" tactics were adopted against arms companies in the United States that supplied arms to Israel, including Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Textron, Boeing, L3Harris, Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman.\nWar protesters on university campuses are calling for universities to withdraw any funding from arms manufacturers and companies linked to the Israeli military, including Cisco, Caterpillar and General Electric.\nA group of seven Democrat U.S. senators stated that the Biden administration was in violation of the Foreign Assistance Act, which stipulates that weapons cannot be transferred to governments blocking humanitarian assistance. Senator Chris Van Hollen called on Biden to cease weapons transfers, stating, \"We need the president and the Biden administration to push harder and to use all the levers of US policy to ensure people don't die of starvation\".\nIn June 2024, the NAACP called on the Biden administration to stop sending weapons to Israel.\nin Exeter, England, 10 February 2024]]\nIn July 2024, a group of U.S. doctors and nurses returning from Gaza stated they had witnessed widespread war crimes committed by the Israeli army and called on the United States to implement an arms embargo. In October 2024, a majority of all American doctors who had volunteered in Gaza in the prior year signed a letter to the Biden administration calling for an arms embargo. Later the same month, the editorial board of the Financial Times called for an U.S. arms embargo on Israel, stating, \"Biden has the tools to rein in Netanyahu. He must halt the offensive arms sales to Israel that enable its relentless bombing of Gaza and Lebanon.\"\nIn May 2025, a pro-Palestinian protest was held in Denver, Colorado against Congressman Jason Crow for repeatedly accepting campaign donations from Palantir Technologies, which provides intelligence and surveillance services to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the Gaza war.\nHuman rights issues\nThe United Nations General Assembly on 27 October 2023 voted a non-binding resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire to enable relief to enter Gaza; the United States stood with Israel in rejecting the proposal. The previous week, Washington had vetoed a resolution similar to this one at the more powerful UN Security Council. Email correspondence between the Pentagon and White House in October 2023, however, showed U.S. officials were concerned about the risk of Israeli war crimes.\nDemocratic congressman Andre Carson of Indiana wrote to The Guardian, accusing Israel of \"war crimes\" and citing the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) alleged use of white phosphorus and this week's deadly bombing of the Jabalia refugee camp. \"I am very concerned that our taxpayer dollars may be used for violations of human rights,\" Carson wrote. The Biden administration declared earlier that week that it was not imposing any restrictions on Israel's use of the US-supplied weapons. According to Pentagon spokesman Sabrina Singh, \"That is really up to the Israel Defense Force to use in how they are going to conduct their operations... But we’re not putting any constraints on that.\"\nLike Carson, Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, particularly mentioned the alleged use of white phosphorus, as asserted by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW), as a violation that should bar Israel from getting aid from the US. \"Deployment of white phosphorus near populated civilian areas is a war crime,\" she said.\nFollowing reports that the U.S. State Department had not found Israel's assurances of following international law credible, William Hartung wrote that State Department staffers' \"desires to align U.S. actions with U.S.and international law have been firmly rebuffed by the Biden administration’s leadership team\". In August 2024, the Quincy Institute published a list of twenty instances in which Israel used U.S. weapons to commit likely war crimes. Bryan Finucane warned the U.S. could be complicit if Israel used its weapons to commit war crimes.\nReuters reported that the Biden administration obtained intelligence from Israeli military lawyers that indicated Israel may have committed war crimes. According to the report, the administration continued providing weapons to Israel under the justification that the US had not gathered this information itself. The US also reportedly obtained evidence of Israel's use of Palestinians as human shields.\nAlleged US complicity in Gaza genocide\n, United States, October 2023]]\nSome scholars believe that America is complicit in an alleged genocide committed by Israel against the Palestinians. Lawyers of the Center for Constitutional Rights warned the Biden administration that they could be held liable \"for their failure to prevent Israel's unfolding genocide, as well as for their complicity, by encouraging it and materially supporting it\".\nIn November 2023, president Joe Biden was nicknamed \"Genocide Joe\" by critics of his support for Israel. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, described by Israeli media outlet Ynet as \"an exceptionally accomplished Israeli advocate,\" said \"Israel's trying to defend itself against a genocidal terrorist threat. So if we're going to start using that word, fine, let's use it appropriately.\"\nIn November 2023 the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) sued Biden for allegedly failing in his duty under national and international laws to prevent Israel from committing genocide in Gaza. The CCR argued that \"the United States has the means available to have a deterrent effect on Israeli officials now pursuing genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza.\" In a declaration in the lawsuit, Genocide scholar William Schabas said that in his view there was a \"serious risk of genocide\" and that the US was \"in breach of its obligation\" under the 1948 Genocide Convention and international law.\nRashida Tlaib, a Democratic representative of Michigan, accused Biden of supporting \"the genocide of the Palestinian people\". US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) sponsored a resolution to censure Tlaib.\nFollowing the veto of another resolution in the UN Council on 8 December 2023, international human rights organizations issued the following statement: \"By continuing to provide Israel with weapons [and] diplomatic cover as it commits atrocities, including collectively punishing the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, the US risks complicity in war crimes.\"\nDuring an August 2024 meeting with humanitarian aid organizations, U.S. diplomat Lise Grande reportedly responded to concerns about Israel's international humanitarian law violations by responding that Israel was too close an ally for the United States to cease sending weapons. In September 2024, a ProPublica investigation found that USAID and other agencies found that Israel had deliberately blocked humanitarian aid, but that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had rejected their findings.\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) announced in August 2025 that US military personnel who assist Israeli forces in committing war crimes may be prosecuted for their actions.\nLegal obligations\nForeign Assistance Act\nOn 14 December 2023, Independent Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a privileged resolution invoking Section 502(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act, calling on the State Department to investigate Israeli crimes against humanity in its conduct of the war in Gaza. Sanders said that \"This resolution is not prescriptive — it does not alter aid to Israel in any way. It simply requests that the State Department report on how our aid is being used.\" The resolution would freeze US military aid to Israel unless the State Department issues a report within 30 days. The proposal was defeated, 72 to 11, with only Sanders and Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley, Chris Van Hollen, Martin Heinrich, Laphonza Butler, Ed Markey, Ben Ray Luján, Mazie Hirono, Peter Welch and Elizabeth Warren and Republican Rand Paul voting for it. Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) voiced support for the resolution. Among the senators who voted against the resolution were Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tom Carper (D-DE), Mike Braun (R-IN), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Independent Angus King of Maine and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) opposed the resolution. Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that resolution \"would be a gift to Hamas, a gift to Iran\".\nLeahy Laws\nSome Democrats have argued that the $14.3 billion package the White House has promised Israel violates the Leahy Act because most of the victims of Israel's attacks on Gaza are civilians. The act forbids the US State and Defence departments from providing security support to foreign governments that are suspected of violating human rights. The act's proponents refer to the increasing number of Gaza residents losing their lives as a result of military operations, the forced relocation of over a million people, and the escalating humanitarian situation following Israeli authorities' cuts to the region's supplies of fuel, food, water, and electricity. A group of top U.S. House Democrats urged the president to enforce the Leahy Laws.\nUsamah Andrabi, Justice Democrats' director of communications – said \"I think the Leahy Act should absolutely be looked into right now, when we are seeing gross violations of human rights,\" he said. \"[The Israelis] are targeting refugee camps, hospitals, mosques all under the guise of self-defense or that one or other member of Hamas is hiding there. It doesn't matter whether Hamas is there or not, because you are targeting civilians. No amount of tax dollars should be justified for that.\"\nCharles O. Blaha, the former director of the State Department's Office of Security and Human Rights, wrote in Just Security, stating that the U.S. secretary of state's decision not to issue sanctions on the IDF's Netzah Yehuda Battalion appeared to be \"directly contrary to the Leahy law\". Stacy Gilbert, a former-State Department official, stated, \"It is widely known and documented in the humanitarian community and the US government that Israel has been blocking humanitarian assistance since the start of the Gaza conflict\".\nRaed Jarrar, director of advocacy at DAWN, an American nonprofit that fights for democracy and human rights in the Arab world, supported Palestinians who sued the State Department over US aid to the Israeli military, and called on the government to follow the Leahy law.\nDouble standards\nThe Islamic world and much of the Global South accused the United States and its allies of a double standard in condemning an illegal occupation in Ukraine while standing firmly behind Israel.\nWestern leaders, pressed for weeks to say whether the loss of thousands of mostly civilian lives could be a violation of international law, spoke only tentatively, adding that they could not judge: \"We're not going to get dragged into all this judge-and-jury role,\" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.\nBy comparison, a year earlier the United States Department of State had officially announced that, based on available information, the US government assessed that members of Russia's forces in Ukraine had committed war crimes.\nThe U.S. State Department said there is no need to launch any formal domestic investigation into whether Israel has committed war crimes, even though the weapons it uses are supplied by the US.\nIn a speech to the European Parliament, the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said water cuts are a violation of international law regardless of where they occur, whether in Ukraine or Gaza.\nIn an interview, Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official, stated to The New Yorker, \"Do I think that Joe Biden has the same depth of feeling and empathy for the Palestinians of Gaza as he does for the Israelis? No, he doesn’t\". In April 2024, the Foreign Ministry of Turkey accused the U.S. of having a \"double-standard policy on human rights\". Barry Trachtenberg, a professor at Wake Forest University, criticized Western support of Israeli military actions, stating, \"What we’re seeing is this clear double-standard where when it’s in the interests of the United States and Western allies, they’ll invoke international law. When it’s not in their interests, they’ll clearly violate international law\". In July 2024, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez spoke at the NATO summit in Washington D.C., urging the West to stop its \"double standards\" between Gaza and Ukraine.\nAfter Israel killed the American peace activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi in the West Bank, another American activist who was shot by Israeli forces wrote an editorial in Time magazine, stating, \"Earlier this year, President Joe Biden said that 'if you harm an American, we will respond.' Yet the Biden Administration has not even condemned my attack.\" The families of Americans killed by Israel also stated that the Department of Justice had failed to investigate their relatives' deaths. According to a leaked letter, Department of Justice attorneys requested Attorney General Merrick Garland to \"investigate potential violations of U.S. law by Israel’s government, military, and citizenry, and hold the perpetrators to account.\"\nBacklash to US support\nHuman rights organizations and UN officials have heavily criticized the Biden administration for vetoing multiple UN resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire and for continuing to send arms to Israel. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the US was complicit in war crimes, and Amnesty International's Secretary General said that the veto showed that the US \"displays a callous disregard for civilian suffering in the face of a staggering death toll\". Doctors Without Borders said that the veto \"stands in sharp contrast to the values it professes to uphold,\" and that the US was providing \"diplomatic cover for the ongoing atrocities in Gaza\". Human Rights Watch said that the veto and the military support \"risks complicity in war crimes\". Following the veto, a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a ceasefire garnered overwhelming support, with 153 countries voting for the resolution to 10 opposed. Turkey's president called for reform of the UN Security Council system that allows for the five permanent members to veto resolutions supported by the overwhelming majority of countries.\nPolling by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies showed 94 percent of respondents in sixteen Middle East countries had a negative view of U.S. policy in the war and 76 percent had a diminished view of the country due to its policies. In a social media post, the Palestine UN mission criticized the US secretary of state for not acknowledging the tens of thousands of killed Palestinians in his post marking the 100 days since the start of the war.\nOn 4 February 2024, Irish MEP Mick Wallace accused the United States of lacking respect for other cultures or international law after it initiated a bombing campaign against Yemen. Following a US veto of a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, Zhang Jun, China's ambassador to the UN, stated it was \"nothing different from giving the green light to the continued slaughter\".\nWithin Congress\nU.S. House\nwith House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator Ben Cardin, 24 July 2024]]\nOn 29 October 2023, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), accused Israel of committing genocide, saying, \"President Biden, not all America is with you on this one, and you need to wake up and understand. We are literally watching people commit genocide.\" Representative Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) stated on 27 December 2023, that U.S. policy in Israel had failed. Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) stated on 3 January 2024, that Israeli officials' statements calling for the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza were \"reprehensible\". Tlaib and Congressman Cori Bush (D-MO) released a joint statement on 12 January in support of the South Africa International Court of Justice case, stating, \"The US must stop trying to discredit and undermine this case and the international legal system it claims to support.\" Congressmembers Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Val Hoyle (D-OR) and Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) condemned Biden's 2024 missile strikes in Yemen on 12 January, stating that only Congress has the power to approve a war. A 19 January letter from 60 Democratic Congressmembers urged U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken to firmly condemn the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. A group of a dozen Jewish Congressmembers issued a statement on 19 January condemning Netanyahu's opposition to a Palestinian state, which read, \"We strongly disagree with the Prime Minister. A two-state solution is the path forward.\"\nTexas Congressman Lloyd Doggett wrote on 24 January: \"After all America has done for him, if Netanyahu 'needs to be able to say no' to us, we need to say no to him and do so now!\" On 24 January, a group of five Congressmembers requested the Government Accountability Office to review whether arms transferred to Israel were being used to violate international law. Mark Pocan (D-WI) criticized Biden's decision to suspend funding to UNRWA, stating on 29 January: \"UNRWA feeds 1.2 million people a day, as well as helps distribute aid now to all Palestinians in need. Aid needs to be restored now to help the displaced millions in Gaza.\" Chuy Garcia (D-IL) stated that the \"decision to freeze UNRWA funding\" should be reversed. On 11 February 2024, Congresswoman Cori Bush criticized Israel's impending invasion of Rafah, stating, \"Almost half of Gaza's population has taken refuge in Rafah. There's nowhere else to go.\" Congressman Ro Khanna also criticized Biden's response to Israel's planned attack on Rafah, stating, \"This is not the time for vague generalities about doing more to protect civilian life.\"\nOn 28 February, U.S. congresswoman Madeleine Dean (D-PA) called for an end to the war and condemned Netanyahu, stating, \"Prime Minister Netanyahu's dishonesty – his broken promises to use precision strikes to protect civilians and his false claims that safe zones have been created and enforced – is unacceptable\". A group of two dozen House members demanded Biden and Blinken take steps to ensure journalists' safety in Gaza, stating: \"Not enough steps have been taken to safeguard the lives of the civilian population in Gaza, including journalists\". On 29 February, Congressman Jim McGovern called for the U.S. to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza, stating, \"Massive humanitarian support is needed to save innocent lives.\" A group of six U.S. House representatives – Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Sean Casten (D-IL), Madeleine Dean, Becca Balint (D-VT), Salud Carbajal (D-CA), and Mark Takano (D-CA) – returned from a trip to Israel and released a joint statement, saying, \"We are deeply worried that Prime Minister Netanyahu is moving toward the total destruction of Gaza and has demonstrated an utter disregard for Palestinian lives\". Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) stated in May 2024, \"We are way past the red line. We cannot continue supporting this.\"\nIn October 2024, a group of several dozen House Democrats signed a letter to the Biden Administration, urging tougher accountability regarding press access to the Gaza Strip.\nIn November 2025, Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, with the support of 20 other Democratic members of Congress and more than 100 human rights groups, has introduced a resolution recognizing Israel’s assault on Gaza as genocide.\nU.S. Senate\nwith Israeli President Herzog in Tel Aviv, Israel, 15 October 2023]]\nOn 2 November 2023, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) became the first U.S. senator to call for a permanent ceasefire. He was followed by Jeff Merkley (D-OR) later that same month. On 23 December 2023, US senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), stated, \"There's a big gap between what the United States says is essential, and what the Netanyahu government is prepared to do. And when you see these big gaps, the United States looks feckless.\" US senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) criticized Biden's emergency sale of weapons to Israel on 30 December 2023, stating, \"Why should the Admin bypass Congress on arms sales to any nation? Bypassing Congress = keeping the American public in the dark.\" U.S. senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) forced a vote on  17 January 2024, on a resolution requiring the State Department to explore whether U.S. weapons were being used to violate international humanitarian law.\nOn 7 February 2024, U.S. senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) stated he would support an amendment requiring weapons sold internationally to be used in compliance with U.S. law, international humanitarian law, and the laws of armed conflict. In a speech on 13 February, Senator Chris Van Hollen accused the Israeli government of committing war crimes in Gaza, stating, \"Kids in Gaza are now dying from the deliberate withholding of food. That is a war crime. It is a textbook war crime. And that makes those who orchestrate it war criminals.\" On 9 March, Senator Bernie Sanders criticized members of Congress, stating, \"It is absurd to criticise Netanyahu's war in one breath and provide another $10bn to continue that war in the next.\" On 29 April, Senator Van Hollen of Maryland there was \"serious doubt on the integrity of the process in the Biden administration for reviewing whether the Netanyahu government is complying with international law in Gaza\".\nIn May 2024, Bernie Sanders asked how the U.S. would be able to criticize other countries' human rights abuses if it ignored the \"crimes against humanity\" committed in Gaza. In June 2024, Senator Chris Van Hollen urged sanctions against Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich during a U.S. congressional subcommittee meeting. In September 2025, Senators Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley, after returning from a congressional delegation trip to the Middle East, said that Israel was operating under a systematic plan to destroy and ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza in order to force the local population to leave, and they said that the United States was complicit. In September 2025, Bernie Sanders became the first US senator to say that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.\nWithin the Biden administration\nIn January 2024, a letter was signed by more than a dozen Biden campaign staffers calling for condition of US support to Israel and a ceasefire. Paul told The Guardian that the administration is witnessing \"pretty extraordinary levels of dissent\". On 2 February 2024, a group of 800 U.S. and European officials signed an open letter stating their governments' policies were weakening their nations' \"moral standing\". Following the World Central Kitchen drone strikes on 1 April 2024, internal dissent within the Biden administration on the issue of weapons sales to Israel increased.\nDuring a February 2024 meeting between U.S. diplomats, humanitarian workers, and USAID director Samantha Power, staff were reportedly \"visibly upset\" with the administration's policy, with some wearing keffiyehs in protest and others breaking down into tears.\nJake Sullivan, former national security advisor to Biden, admitted in an interview published in January 2025 that he had doubts about whether the Biden administration had done the right thing in continuing supporting Israel with arms because of the \"immense human suffering in Gaza\".\nResignations\nBy 7 January 2024, two officials from the Biden administration—Josh Paul and Tariq Habash, working on arms sale at the State Department and policy adviser at the Department of Education respectively—had resigned in opposition to US support to Israel's war efforts. In March 2024, another State Department staffer working on human rights, Anelle Sheline, resigned over the administration's support to the war, in particular its bypassing of Congress to authorize the sale of weapons to Israel. In April 2024, the U.S. State Department Arabic spokesperson resigned in protest of the administration's Gaza policy. In May 2024, Lily Greenberg Call, the special assistant to the Interior Department's chief of staff, resigned in protest of Biden's Gaza policies. On 30 May, a senior State Department official resigned, stating U.S. statements that Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza were false.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Israel's Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir stated, \"Instead of giving us his full backing, Biden is busy with giving humanitarian aid and fuel [to Gaza], which goes to Hamas. If Trump was in power, the U.S. conduct would be completely different.\" Israel's Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich stated Biden was involved in an anti-Semitic lie for issuing sanctions against violent West Bank settlers.}} Following comments by Biden in March 2024 that Israel's killing of civilians was \"hurting Israel more than helping\", the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu stated this was \"false\" and \"wrong\". After a speech by Chuck Schumer calling for new elections after the war, Likud released a statement, saying, \"Senator Schumer is expected to respect Israel's elected government and not undermine it. This is always true and even more so in wartime.\"\nOn 27 March, Ben-Gvir stated, \"Biden prefers the line of Rashida Tlaib and Sinwar to the line of Benjamin Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir.

Numerous social media users, including Americans, expressed their opposition to US foreign policy by widely sharing the letter and its contents. The letter was removed from The Guardian website after more than 20 years of being present online in the news outlet's webpage, and TikTok began issuing takedowns of videos featuring the letter. Reporting in The Washington Post suggested that the virality of the letter had been limited prior to media coverage, having never trended on TikTok, that many of the TikTok videos covering the letter were critical of bin Laden, and that the media coverage had exaggerated its significance and elevated the virality of the letter.\n*Angie Nixon (D), a member of the Florida House of Representatives, sponsored a resolution calling for \"de-escalation\" and a ceasefire. The resolution was rejected by a vote of 104 to 2, but there was controversy during the legislative debate. Nixon said: \"We are at 10,000 dead Palestinians. How many will be enough?\" State Representative Michelle Salzman (R) replied, \"All of them.\" Some commentators called Salzman's remark a call for genocide.

The two million people who live there – they are clever assassins. They need to be removed from that land. That land needs to be turned into a national park. And since they're the voluntary mercenaries for Iran, they need to be dropped on the doorstep of Iran. Let Iran deal with those people.\" She received a round of applause from the audience, while Kirk replied \"I look at Israel and Israel says we never want another person into our country that doesn't share our values,\" Kirk said. \"They said they don't want refugees. They don't want any of these people.

Trump's campaign also said that, if elected again, he would bar Gaza residents from entering the U.S. as part of an expanded travel ban, which commentators has viewed as a call to continue and \"double down\" on genocidal acts. In another interview with Fox News, Benjamin Netanyahu said \"I appreciate President Trump's tremendous support for Israel.\"\n* Donald Trump later also stated that \"Israel has to be very careful because you're losing a lot of the world, you're losing a lot of support.\"\n* Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, senior foreign policy adviser under Trump's presidency, stated that \"Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable\", that Israel should bulldoze an area of the Negev desert and move Palestinians there, and that the Palestinians having their own state is \"a super bad idea\" that \"would essentially be rewarding an act of terror\".\n* In a town hall meeting on 25 March 2024, the Republican US House representative Tim Walberg of Michigan stated that Palestinian civilians should have nuclear weapons used against them, \"like Nagasaki and Hiroshima\" (the Japanese cities where the US dropped atomic bombs at the end of World War Two, killing hundreds of thousands of people) in order to \"Get it over quick.\"\n* A group of eight Democrat senators led by Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen issued an official letter to President Joe Biden, calling on him to \"enforce federal law\" by requiring Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"to stop restricting humanitarian aid access to Gaza or forfeit U.S. military aid to Israel\" as \"The severe humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is nearly unprecedented in modern history\" and \"The United States should not provide military assistance to any country that interferes with U.S. humanitarian assistance.\" They cited the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, which states that \"no assistance\" shall be provided under that law or the Arms Export Control Act to any country that restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. \"Stopping American humanitarian aid is in violation of the law.

Until then, starve away.\" He also called the reports of starvation \"Muslim terror propaganda\".\n* On 26 August 2025, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew justified Israel's killing of children during the Gaza war, saying that \"in many cases, the children were children of Hamas fighters, not children taking cover in places\" and therefore \"whether or not it was a legitimate military target flows from the population that’s there\".\n* A Quinnipiac University poll in August 2025 found that 60 percent of respondents oppose more military support for Israel, the highest number since the 7 October attacks.\n*Human Rights Watch announced in August 2025 that US military personnel who assist Israeli forces in committing war crimes may be prosecuted for their actions.\n*In August 2025 President Donald Trump said that no genocide is taking place.\n* Microsoft vice president and president Brad Smith confirmed that the company has canceled some of the services it provides to the Israeli military over concerns that the Israeli military is violating its terms of service by using the company's cloud computing software to spy on millions of Palestinians.\n*In September 2025 the US senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley (D) said that Israel was operating under a systematic plan to destroy and ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza and that the United States was complicit in that plan.\nOutside the U.S.\nin Tel Aviv, 9 October 2025, following the announcement of the impending release of Israeli hostages.]]\n* Iranian officials claimed on 30 October that attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and other parts of the region were the consequence of \"wrong American policies,\" which included Washington's backing of Israel in its war against Hamas.\n* Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the commander of the Houthi movement in Yemen, declared on 10 October that his organization would retaliate by using missiles and drones in addition to other military measures if the United States got involved in the Gaza conflict.\n* According to Agnès Callamard, Secretary-General of Amnesty International, in the face of a staggering death toll, the US vetoing another UN Security Council ceasefire resolution \"displays a callous disregard for civilian suffering\". In addition, Washington \"has brazenly wielded and weaponized its veto to strongarm the UN Security Council, further undermining its credibility and ability to live up to its mandate to maintain international peace and security,\" according to the statement.\n** In February 2024, Callamard responded to the U.S. vetoing another ceasefire resolution at the UN Security Council stating, \"When the US could do the right thing: protect Palestinians against serious risks of genocide; respect international law and universality; prevent massive killings and sufferings – it chose the opposite path\".\n* The executive director of Doctors Without Borders, Avril Benoit, states: \"By vetoing this resolution, the US stands alone in casting its vote against humanity. The US veto stands in sharp contrast to the values it professes to uphold. By continuing to provide diplomatic cover for the ongoing atrocities in Gaza, the US is signaling that international humanitarian law can be applied selectively — and that the lives of some people matter less than the lives of others …. The US veto makes it complicit in the carnage in Gaza.\"\n* International rights groups said in a statement:\"By continuing to provide military and diplomatic support to Israel as it commits atrocities, including the collective punishment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the US is complicit in war crimes.\"\n* In response to Biden stating Israel's actions were \"over the top,\" the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stated, \"If you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people being killed.\"\n* A Pew Research poll showed that most foreign countries disapproved of Biden's response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n* The State Council Information Office of China released a report dating back to 2024, stating that the United States is \"an accomplice to the genocide in Gaza\" and criticised the \"excessive use of unilateral sanctions\".\nAnalysis\nU.S. lawmakers have long viewed Israel as an ally to help protect U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East. Maintaining Israel's regional military hegemony, according to Al-Jazeera, is a central element of U.S. Middle East policy. This has been achieved with U.S. financial aid and an increase in Israel's military arsenal.\nOn the question of why Joe Biden is reluctant to freeze arms transfers or impose conditions on future supplies, Guardian journalist, Robert Tait writes that the US is concerned that pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu could push him towards a common goal with Republicans in a year leading to the election.\nJosh Paul, who resigned over sending arms to Israel, has described Biden policy in favor of \"the status quo of the occupation\" and a \"shortsighted, destructive, unjust\" policy that \"will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people — and is not in the long term American interest.\"\nAlthough the U.S. has asked Israel to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid, State Secretary Antony Blinken acknowledged that there is \"a gap\" between these appeals and \"the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground\". The United States has not used its leverage over Israel—its weapons transfers and diplomatic support—to ensure civilian safety, leading the Washington Post to describe American rhetoric as a \"good cop-bad cop approach\". Aaron David Miller of the CEIP said that the Biden administration deserved credit for the humanitarian pause negotiations, but that it had \"tethered\" itself to Israeli war aims that cannot be achieved without bringing \"grievous harm to the civilian population\".\nAli Harb described the contradictions between media reports about Biden's \"frustration\" with Netanyahu, and his continued military support for Israel, stating, \"The US keeps calling for minimising civilian casualties, but the Palestinian death toll keeps growing. The Biden administration repeatedly emphasises the two-state solution; Israeli leaders continue to explicitly say they oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state.\" In March 2024, Al Jazeera English senior analyst Marwan Bishara assessed a perceived shift in Biden's tone toward the war, stating, \"Biden is underlining a change of tone, not a change of policy. And that explains a bit why he sounds as if he's speaking from both sides of his mouth.\"\nIn late-March 2024, Tamer Qarmout, a professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, stated, \"You don't see the US using its real leverage to stop Israel or correct its behaviours.\"\nWhile Republican support for Israel remains strong, many Democrats are debating making future U.S. military aid conditional on Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza. According to Steven A. Cook, for the United States, a more normal bilateral relationship with Israel is likely to reduce the moral costs of military aid. In an op-ed, Elias Khoury argued that the United States's support of Israel \"has eroded its international authority and claim to uphold the international rules-based system\".\nAmidst criticism that Biden's blanket support for Israel's actions had weakened the supposed rules-based order, Lara Friedman of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, wrote, \"The costs of these new rules of war will be paid with the blood of civilians worldwide for generations to come, and the U.S. responsibility for enabling, defending, and normalizing these new rules, and their horrific, dehumanizing consequences will not be forgotten.\"\nSenator Bernie Sanders attributed Washington's reluctance to alter its stance on backing Israel to the financial influence of lobbying groups.\n\"If you speak up on that issue, you’ll have super Pacs like Aipac going after you,\" Sanders said.\nU.S. isolation\nIsrael and the United States have become increasingly isolated amid growing global calls for a ceasefire. American political scientist Ian Bremmer stated that the Biden administration's position unconditionally supporting the Israeli invasion of Gaza has left Joe Biden as isolated on the world stage as Russian president Vladimir Putin has been since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Jeffrey Sachs, a professor of economics at Columbia University, also stated that the United States was being isolated on the world stage due to its support for Israel. In March 2024, U.S. senator Bernie Sanders wrote the U.S. was \"virtually alone in the world\" in continuing to defend Israel's actions as the Palestinian death toll has sparked widespread outrage and protests.\nPeace process\nAccording to some analyses, the US-led ceasefire talks are simply buying more time for Israel's war in Gaza to continue.\nFollowing US request to Qatar to expel Hamas from the country, according to the BBC, this is the result of the Biden administration's less influence over Israel, which led them to believe that the best way to force some sort of deal was by putting pressure on Hamas. Writing in Le Monde Diplomatique, Adam Shatz said that Israel had taken advantage of the United States' facilitation of a peace process to assassinate Ismail Haniyeh and Hasan Nasrallah, writing that \"Netanyahu helped the Americans to draft a ceasefire proposal he had no intention of honouring, while conspiring to kill the Arab leaders with whom the ceasefire was to be reached.\"\nTimeline\n2023\nOctober\n* Hours after the start of the Gaza war on 7 October, the United States started sending warships and warplanes into the region, prepared to give Israel whatever it needs.\n** US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of United States Navy's Carrier Strike Group 12, led by the USS Gerald R.

In addition, the Air Force was sending twice as many F-16, A-10, and F-15E squadrons as before to the Persian Gulf region in order to intensify its land-based assault aircraft presence there. According to officials, the United States would have an aerial armada of more than 100 attack planes when combined with the four squadrons of F/A-18 jets that were stationed onboard each carrier.

The US said the resolution did not do enough to underscore Israel's right to self-defense. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council \"We are on the ground doing the hard work of diplomacy. We believe we need to let that diplomacy play out\".\n* On 19 October, one day after traveling to Israel, President Biden urged Congress to increase military aid to Israel, claiming that Hamas aimed to \"annihilate\" Israeli democracy.\n* On 20 October, Biden announced that the additional funds he asked Congress to authorize would come to a total of $14 billion, as part of a $105 billion military aid package that addressed Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel as well as US border security.\n* On 21 October the Pentagon declared that two of its most potent missile defense systems—a THAAD battery and extra Patriot batteries—would be deployed to the Middle East.\n*Craig Mokhiber of the UN High Commission for Human Rights resigned, criticising the organisation for its response to the Gaza war.

The report stated that US arms shipments to Israel since the start of the war included 15,000 bombs and 57,000 155mm artillery shells, mostly carried on C-17 military cargo planes. U.S. has also sent more than 5,000 unguided Mk82 bombs, more than 5,400 Mk84 bombs, about 1,000 small diameter GBU-39 bombs, and almost 3,000 JDAMs. The Wall Street Journal says that some of the bloodiest Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip have involved the use of big US-made bombs, such as the one that destroyed an apartment complex in the Jabalia refugee camp and killed over a hundred people.\n* On 8 December, the US vetoed another UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The US called it \"unbalanced\" because it did not condemn the Hamas attack nor acknowledge Israel's right to self-defense.\n* On 9 December, the Pentagon said that on the prior day, Biden used emergency authority to skip congressional review to sell ~14,000 tank shells worth $106.5 million for immediate delivery to Israel.\n* On 12 December, Biden said \"Israel's security can rest on the United States\" but warned that Israel was losing international support because of its \"indiscriminate bombing\" of Gaza.\n* On 29 December, the United States government again used emergency authority to sell Israel artillery shells and related weapons worth $147.5 million in order to replenish Israeli weapons stockpiles.\n2024\nJanuary\nand Israeli president Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv, Israel, 9 January 2024]]\n* On 4 January, John Kirby stated the United States had \"not seen anything\" that Israel had done that would make the US change its approach.\n* On 18 January, US Department of State spokesman Matthew Miller stated, \"Our support for Israel remains ironclad.\"\n* PM Netanyahu stated that he would not support a Palestinian state and that he was proud to have thus far prevented a state, leading Biden to comment that he believed a two-state solution was still possible with Netanyahu in power.\n* On 19 January, John Kirby stated, \"We don't have any indications that there's deliberate efforts to commit war crimes\" by Israel.\n* Brett McGurk, the White House leader of post-war Gaza planning, was reportedly pushing a plan that would exchange minimal Israeli interference in the Palestinian Territories for Saudi normalization with Israel.\n* The CIA established a new taskforce to provide intelligence to Israel regarding Hamas leaders.\nFebruary\nwith Israeli president Isaac Herzog at the 60th Munich Security Conference, 16 February 2024]]\n* On 8 February, Biden called Israel's actions in Gaza \"over the top\". Following this, the Biden administration issued a national security directive demanding written assurances from Israel (and other countries) that it was using US-supplied weapons in line with international law or face a pause in weapons transfers. Israel has to prove this to the US State Department on a yearly basis or risk having its weapons supplies cut.\n* In a call with Benjamin Netanyahu on 11 February, Biden said the US would not support an Israeli assault on Rafah without a \"credible and executable plan\" for ensuring the safety of civilians.

The US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that the resolution would undermine ongoing hostage negotiations: \"Demanding an immediate unconditional ceasefire, without an agreement requiring Hamas to release the hostages, will not bring about durable peace\". Instead, the US proposed a draft UN Security Council resolution, calling for a \"temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as practicable, based on the formula of all hostages being released\". It stated that a Rafah offensive would have \"serious implications\" and \"should not proceed under current circumstances\". The US's draft resolution also rejects any Israeli attempt at demographic or territorial change in Gaza that would violate international law. The US said it would not yet put the resolution to a vote as it wanted to allow negotiations to continue.\n* When asked about the deaths of Palestinian children, US Representative Andy Ogles (R) said: \"I think we should kill 'em all...

He said that Netanyahu \"has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza\" and that \"Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah\". Schumer added that if Netanyahu stayed in power after the war, \"the United States will have no choice but to play a more active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to change the present course\". President Biden praised the speech and said Schumer's \"serious concerns\" are shared by many Americans.\n* A group of 19 Senate Democrats sent an open letter to Biden, stating, \"We request the Biden administration promptly establish a bold, public framework outlining the steps necessary\" to create a Palestinian state.\n* Jack Lew, Joseph R.

He added \"We’re looking forward to seeing Israeli officials in Washington next week to go through the details and the best way forward. We’re determined that Israel succeed in defending itself\".\n* On 23 March, the US Defense Ministry said a planned visit by the Israeli Defense Minister to the U.S. would focus on \"the progress of the fighting to dismantle Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the efforts to return the hostages held captive by Hamas, the actions being taken on the ground to bring in humanitarian aid\", as well as on weapons procurement \"to preserve the qualitative advantage of the State of Israel in the region\".\n* On 24 March, Vice president Kamala Harris replied, \"I am ruling out nothing,\" when asked if there would be consequences for Israel if it invaded Rafah.\n* A group of 17 Democratic senators urged the Biden administration to reject Israel's report stating that it was complying with international human rights law in Gaza.

The functioning of the organization has been marked by repeated mass killings in the vicinity of GHF distribution sites.\nJuly\nAugust\n* US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the full occupation of Gaza was \"pretty much up to Israel\".\n* On 16 August 2025, the US State Department has announced that it has suspended the issuance of visitor visas to people from the Gaza Strip, including children who require urgent medical care.\nSeptember\nin Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, 13 October 2025]]\n* The US State Department has sanctioned three Palestinian human rights groups that have called on the International Criminal Court to investigate allegations of war crimes in Gaza and arrest Israeli leaders.\n* On 29 September 2025, Trump announced, alongside Benjamin Netanyahu, a 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan from the White House which consisted of 20 specific points aimed at achieving a ceasefire, the return of Israeli hostages, dismantling Hamas's military capabilities, and establishing a transitional governance structure in the Gaza Strip.\nOctober\n* Trump announced his deal for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas had been reached and that the remaining hostages would be released.\n* British journalist Sami Hamdi was detained by federal immigration authorities at San Francisco International Airport on October 26 for criticizing Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza while giving a speech in the United States, according to Council on American–Islamic Relations.\nPro-Israel lobby\nspeaks at the AIPAC Political Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C., 2023]]\nOn 30 October 2023, AIPAC, a leading pro-Israel lobbying group, issued a public critique of the members of Congress who voted against House Resolution 771, which expressed support for Israel. In response, Republican Thomas Massie defended his vote by saying he objected to a broad \"open-ended promise of military support,\" while Democrats Cori Bush, Mark Pocan and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused AIPAC of harming US democracy. On 1 November, Ilhan Omar accused AIPAC of running Islamophobic ads against her. On 2 November, Rashida Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, was the target of a $100,000 TV ad campaign by the Democratic Majority for Israel.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives on 5 December passed a resolution that included language that said the House \"clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is antisemitism\". The resolution also condemned the slogan \"From the river to the sea,\" for which Tlaib was censured on 5 November. Analysis from The Guardian showed that Congress members who were supportive of Israel from the beginning of the war had received an average of $100,000 more from pro-Israel donors than their pro-Palestinian colleagues. Analysis of Federal Election Commission filings showed House Speaker Mike Johnson received $95,000 from AIPAC.\nIn March 2024, a group of 20 progressive political organizations formed an anti-AIPAC coalition to push back against the lobbyist group's influence on U.S. politics. In response to comments by Senator Chuck Schumer that Israel needed new elections to replace Netanyahu, J Street stated the speech \"signals a historic shift from those in the Democratic party who care deeply about Israel's future\".  Haaretz found that hundreds of fake social media accounts were targeting Democratic Party lawmakers with messages repeating Israeli government accusations relating to UNRWA and Hamas. Haaretz found Israel targeted U.S. lawmakers with an influence campaign, primarily focused on Black politicians. In July 2024, a group of more than 30 human rights organizations requested the Biden administration investigate these influence campaigns. Politico found that AIPAC was the largest source of Republican donors' money spent in 2024 Democratic primary races.\nIn an early June 2024 interview by the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the Republican U.S. Representative Thomas Massie stated that AIPAC has designated representatives assigned to each Republican member of Congress to ensure that the lawmakers vote for bills that Israel supports. He also questioned why the lobby group and their representatives are not required to register as foreign agents, which would be the case for those advocating on behalf of all other countries.\nAntisemitism Awareness Act\n| introduceddate =\n| passedbody1 = House\n| passeddate1 = 1 May 2024\n| passedvote1 = [https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/118-2/172 320 - 91]\n}}\nThe Antisemitism Awareness Act, spearheaded by the Republicans but also backed by many Democrats, passed the United States House of Representatives in a 320–91 vote on 1 May 2024, and proceeded to the Senate. The bill is intended to add the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's approved working definition of antisemitism to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits \"exclusion from participation in, denial of benefits of, and discrimination under federally assisted programs on ground of race, color, or national origin\". Democratic representative Sara Jacobs, who is Jewish, said she opposed the bill because \"it fails to effectively address the very real rise of antisemitism, all while defunding colleges and universities across the country and punishing many, if not all, of the non-violent protestors speaking out against the Israeli military’s conduct.\"\nThe proposed legislation would broaden the legal definition of antisemitism to include Anti-Zionism, criticism of the policies of the state of Israel, and concerns about Palestinian human rights, categorizing all of them as hate speech. It has been criticized for conflating \"Judaism with Zionism in assuming that all Jews are Zionists\". It faces strong opposition from several Democratic lawmakers, Jewish organizations, and free speech advocates, including more than 800 Jewish U.S. academics, who signed a letter calling on Biden not to sign the bill. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the centrist pro-Israel group J Street, said that his organization opposes the bill because it is an \"unserious\" effort led by Republicans \"to continually force votes that divide the Democratic caucus on an issue that shouldn’t be turned into a political football\". The American Civil Liberties Union meanwhile sees the bill as an attack on First Amendment rights and argues that its \"overbroad\" definition of antisemitism \"could result in colleges and universities suppressing a wide variety of speech critical of Israel or in support of Palestinian rights in an effort to avoid investigations by the Department [of Education] and the potential loss of funding\".\nSome far-right Republicans have criticized the bill saying it could make antisemitic tropes attributed to the New Testament such as Jewish deicide illegal, with figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz chastising it as a free speech violation on that basis.\nOrganizations like the Anti-Defamation League and Conference of Presidents have praised the bill, but hundreds of Israeli and international civil society organizations have opposed it saying the IHRA definition was not meant to be used as a basis for law.\nSee also\n*Attacks on US bases during the Gaza war\n*Esther Project\n*Israel–United States military relations\n*Israeli government response to the October 7 attacks\n*List of military aid to Israel during the Gaza war\n*List of companies involved in the Gaza war\n*Negroponte doctrine\n*Palestine–United States relations\n*Project Esther\n*United States foreign policy in the Middle East\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
