      "text": "# Presidential elections in Taiwan\n\nThe election of the president and vice president of Taiwan () is a universal direct election through secret vote by the citizens of Taiwan (ROC) in the Free Area. ROC presidents are elected by relative majority (plurality), meaning the candidate with the most votes wins without a runoff requirement. The most recent election took place on January 13, 2024.\n* The Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act states that a candidate for president or vice president must be a citizen of the Republic of China, at least 40 years old, and a resident of Taiwan for a period of no less than 15 years with a physical presence of no less than 6 consecutive months.\n* The following persons shall not be registered as candidates for the president:\n** Military personnel\n** Election officials\n** People who hold foreign nationality or who hold residency of the People's Republic of China\n** People who have restored their nationality or acquired their nationality by naturalization\n*The president and vice president are nominated on a joint ticket. Political parties which have gained at least 5% of the votes in the last presidential or legislative election may nominate a set of candidates directly. For example, during the 2012 elections, only the Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party were qualified to nominate candidates through this rule. Alternatively, candidates may be nominated by a petition signed by eligible voters numbering no less than 1.5% of the electors in the last legislative election. (This equaled 252,848 signatures for the 2012 election.)\nList of presidential elections in Taiwan\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Order!!Year!!Party!!Presidentialcandidate!!Vice presidentialcandidate!!Popular vote!!%\n|-\n|rowspan=4|9||rowspan=4|1996\n|Kuomintang||Lee Teng-hui||Lien Chan\n|align=right|5,813,699||align=right|54.00%\n|-\n|Democratic Progressive||Peng Ming-min||Frank Hsieh\n|align=right|2,274,586||align=right|21.13%\n|-\n|Independent||Lin Yang-kang||Hau Pei-tsun\n|align=right|1,603,790||align=right|14.90%\n|-\n|Independent||Chen Li-an||Wang Ching-feng\n|align=right|1,074,044||align=right|9.98%\n|-\n|rowspan=5|10||rowspan=5|2000\n|Democratic Progressive||Chen Shui-bian||Annette Lu\n|align=right|4,977,697||align=right|39.30%\n|-\n|Independent||James Soong||Chang Chau-hsiung\n|align=right|4,664,972||align=right|36.84%\n|-\n|Kuomintang||Lien Chan||Vincent Siew\n|align=right|2,925,513||align=right|23.10%\n|-\n|Independent||Hsu Hsin-liang||Josephine Chu\n|align=right|79,429||align=right|0.63%\n|-\n|New||Li Ao||Elmer Fung\n|align=right|16,782||align=right|0.13%\n|-\n|rowspan=2|11||rowspan=2|2004\n|Democratic Progressive||Chen Shui-bian||Annette Lu\n|align=right|6,471,970||align=right|50.11%\n|-\n|Kuomintang||Lien Chan||James Soong\n|align=right|6,442,452||align=right|49.89%\n|-\n|rowspan=2|12||rowspan=2|2008\n|Kuomintang||Ma Ying-jeou||Vincent Siew\n|align=right|7,659,014||align=right|58.45%\n|-\n|Democratic Progressive||Frank Hsieh||Su Tseng-chang\n|align=right|5,444,949||align=right|41.55%\n|-\n|rowspan=3|13||rowspan=3|2012\n|Kuomintang||Ma Ying-jeou||Wu Den-yih\n|align=right|6,891,139||align=right|51.60%\n|-\n|Democratic Progressive||Tsai Ing-wen||Su Jia-chyuan\n|align=right|6,093,578||align=right|45.63%\n|-\n|Independent||James Soong||Lin Ruey-shiung\n|align=right|369,588||align=right|2.77%\n|-\n|rowspan=3|14||rowspan=3|2016\n|Democratic Progressive||Tsai Ing-wen||Chen Chien-jen\n|align=right|6,894,744||align=right|56.12%\n|-\n|Kuomintang||Eric Chu||Wang Ju-hsuan\n|align=right|3,813,365||align=right|31.04%\n|-\n|People First||James Soong||Hsu Hsin-ying\n|align=right|1,576,861||align=right|12.84%\n|-\n|rowspan=3|15||rowspan=3|2020\n|Democratic Progressive||Tsai Ing-wen||Lai Ching-te\n|align=right|8,170,231||align=right|57.13%\n|-\n|Kuomintang||Han Kuo-yu||Chang San-cheng\n|align=right|5,522,119||align=right|38.61%\n|-\n|People First||James Soong||Sandra Yu\n|align=right|608,590||align=right|4.26%\n|-\n|rowspan=3|16||rowspan=3|2024\n|Democratic Progressive||Lai Ching-te||Hsiao Bi-khim\n|align=right|5,586,019||align=right|40.05%\n|-\n|Kuomintang||Hou Yu-ih||Jaw Shaw-kong\n|align=right|4,671,021||align=right|33.49%\n|-\n|Taiwan People's||Ko Wen-je||Cynthia Wu\n|align=right|3,690,466||align=right|26.46%\n|}\n{|width=650px\n|align=center|\nFile:2024ROCPresident.svg|2024 Election\nFile:2020ROCPresident.svg|2020 Election\nFile:2016ROCPresident.svg|2016 Election\nFile:2012ROCPresident.svg|2012 Election\nFile:2008ROCPresident.svg|2008 Election\nFile:2004ROCPresident.svg|2004 Election\nFile:2000ROCPresident.svg|2000 Election\nFile:1996ROCPresident.svg|1996 Election\n|-\n|align=center|\n|}\nSee also\n*Elections in Taiwan\n*President of the Republic of China\n*List of presidents of the Republic of China\n*Vice President of the Republic of China\n*List of vice presidents of the Republic of China\n* Right of expatriates to vote in their country of origin#Taiwan\nReferences"
