It is the fifth game in the Close Combat series. A remake, Close Combat: The Longest Day was released in 2009.\nGameplay\nClose Combat: Invasion: Normandy is a computer wargame with real-time gameplay, which focuses on military conflict in World War II.\nDevelopment\nAtomic Games began working on Close Combat: Invasion: Normandy in early 2000, following the release of the fourth Close Combat title, Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge. The previous game had been made for Mindscape's Strategic Simulations Inc. (SSI) label, and Invasion: Normandy began under that publisher. However, Mindscape had since been sold to Mattel when that company bought The Learning Company, Mindscape's parent, for $3.5 billion in 1999. As a result, Close Combat V was published by Mattel Interactive, a financially unstable company. Computer Games Magazines Robert Mayer noted in September 2000 that \"the future of [Close Combat] is up in the air—Mattel Interactive is perennially on the trading block, and Atomic&nbsp;... has lost some key staff members in recent months\".\nLate in September, Mattel sold The Learning Company at a bargain price to The Gores Group. A spokesman for the new managers announced that they expected to make it \"profitable within six months.\" Invasion: Normandy was released in October 2000.\nReception\n| rev1 = CNET Gamecenter\n| rev1Score = 8/10\n}}\nAccording to Metacritic, Close Combat: Invasion: Normandy received \"generally favorable reviews\" from critics.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
