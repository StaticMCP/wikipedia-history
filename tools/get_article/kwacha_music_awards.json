The awards were established to encourage and promote the originality and the excellence in Zambian music industry for the radio airplay through recognizing, honoring, and appreciating the deserving artists.\nThe awards are registered with the National Arts Council of Zambia and PACRA for the copyright protection.\nHistory\nThe first Kwacha Music Awards ceremony was held in Lusaka at Mulungushi International Conference Centre on 30 September, 2017.\nThe National Arts Council of Zambia is mandated by National Arts Council Act 31 of 1994 Part 5, Section (e) to “regulate and provide for modalities for the award of national honours for artistic merit\".\nThe awards are hosted in the capital city of Zambia, Lusaka. They are one of the major local Zambia's awards. As similar with most of the awards in Zambia, the awards categories are split into male and female.\nThe awards also recognize humanitarians who are helping the needy in communities. The votes by the public and organisations are cast via their website in Zambia as well as across the African continent.\nNomination and criteria\nThe nominees of the awards are drawn from the fan interactions that are reflected on the radio airplay in countrywide. The votes are tracked by the committee of the awards with partnership to various radio stations. The awards are then determined by the polls of the public and the fans via established channels that include website, SMS, and social media. The awards are then verified by the auditing firms for transparency.\nArtist of the Year\nThe Artist of the Year category is one of the highest and most prestigious of the awards given at the event given to the artist(s). The artist winning most of the awards is Yo Maps.\nList of ceremonies\n2023 winners\nKwacha Award winners were announced in December 2023.\nGeneral award categories\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
