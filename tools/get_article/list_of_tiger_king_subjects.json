He claimed to be the most prolific breeder of tigers in the United States. He ran as a candidate for president of the United States as well as for governor of Oklahoma, but neither campaign managed to garner significant public support. Aside from his career as a zookeeper and his political runs, Exotic had several side-projects, including his country music, magic shows, a career in the police force, and a professional wrestling commentator.\nFor over 20 years, Exotic was the owner and operator of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, known for its big cats. He operated an online reality television show that he streamed from his zoo. Over the years, he operated sideshows around the country, allowing people to pet tiger cubs. He also staged shows at fairs and in shopping malls. In 2019 he was convicted on 17 federal charges of animal abuse (eight violations of the Lacey Act and nine of the Endangered Species Act) and two counts of murder-for-hire, for a plot to kill Carole Baskin, the chief executive officer of Big Cat Rescue, an animal rescue organization for exotic cats. Exotic was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison, though his sentence was later reduced to 17 years in July 2021.\nExotic is the main focus of Tiger King, with the documentary discussing his zookeeping career, political runs and feud with Baskin. As a result of the documentary, Exotic received significant amounts of attention on social media, inspiring several internet memes and gaining a fanbase. In prison, Exotic has been writing an autobiography.\nCarole Baskin\n, the second most well-known subject in Tiger King]]\nCarole Baskin (née Stairs; born June 6, 1961) is an American animal rights activist and owner of Big Cat Rescue, a non-profit animal sanctuary based near Tampa, Florida.

She is the current chief executive officer of the sanctuary, which she renamed to Big Cat Rescue sometime after Lewis's disappearance in 1997. She has used social media such as Facebook and YouTube and her \"The Cat Chat\" podcast to promote activism against private zoos.\nExotic engaged in a pattern of harassment against Baskin, including trademark infringement. In 2013, a court ordered him to pay Baskin $1&nbsp;million in damages, leading to his bankruptcy. In 2020, he was convicted of attempting to hire a hitman to kill her.\nHoward Baskin\nHoward Gene Baskin is an American animal rights activist and the third husband of Carole Baskin.

In July 1997, Lewis filed a restraining order against her, claiming that she had threatened to kill him; the restraining order was rejected.

When any of my friends asked what I thought his response might be before the release of the documentary, I said 'he will call me crazy and try to minimize my involvement.' That is exactly what he has done.\"\nRachel Starr\nRachel Starr is an adult film star from Dallas, Texas.
