The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, Algeria has been nominated five times, winning once for Costa-Gavras' Z (1969). The other two directors nominated were Ettore Scola (Le Bal in 1983) and Rachid Bouchareb (Dust of Life in 1995, Days of Glory in 2006, and Outside the Law in 2010.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nA running theme in the Algerian submissions has been the relationship between Algeria (and its citizens) and its former colonial power, France. Salut cousin! and ''Inch'Allah Dimanche follow the lives of recent Algerian immigrants in France, while Cheb follows a young man who returns to his native Algeria and many years studying in France. Three others take a historical look at relations; La Dernière image tells the story of a young French schoolteacher who arrives in a small town under the control of Vichy France at the start of World War II, while the Oscar-nominated Indigènes follows a cadre of Algerian soldiers who fight in the French army during the same war. Chronique des années de braise'' shows the beginning of Algeria's war of independence from France through the eyes of a peasant.\nFour other Algerian submissions actually had little direct connection with the country. Z had a Greek-French director, while Le Bal was directed by an Italian, and neither film took place in Algeria. Rachid Bouchareb's Dust of Life followed a group of Amerasian children living in a refugee camp near Vietnam, while Little Senegal took place among illegal immigrants from Africa living in New York City.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Algeria for review by the academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
