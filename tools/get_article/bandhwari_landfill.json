Established in 2008, it serves as the primary dumping ground for waste from Gurugram and Faridabad. Over the years, it has drawn criticism for frequent fires, groundwater contamination, and encroachment into the ecologically sensitive Aravalli Range.\nHistory\nThe Bandhwari landfill was commissioned in 2008 to manage growing waste from Gurugram and Faridabad. Initially designed to handle around 1,200 tonnes of waste per day, it currently receives approximately 2,000 tonnes daily.\nA municipal waste composition analysis in 2025 revealed that plastic comprises approximately 25% of total waste entering the landfill, significantly contributing to its bulk and fire risk.\nEnvironmental impact\nGroundwater contamination\nStudies by the Central Pollution Control Board have found that leachate from the landfill has polluted local groundwater. Nearby residents report the water is unfit for drinking and may pose serious health risks. A 2023 study in the Journal of Water and Health concluded that ingestion of groundwater from the surrounding area posed potential health risks due to heavy metal contamination.\nIn 2025, leachate was reported to have been illegally sprayed outside the landfill compound to settle dust pollution, prompting a government inquiry.\nAravalli degradation\nThe landfill borders the Aravalli Range, a fragile ecological zone. Environmentalists warn that dumping and spillage have harmed native flora and fauna. Fires and unregulated operations have affected forest patches adjacent to the site.\nFires\nBandhwari has witnessed frequent landfill fires, with over 70 incidents reported between March and June 2024. Fires are primarily caused by methane accumulation from decomposing organic waste. In April 2025, major fires occurred on 3, 6, 21, and 26 April, producing thick smoke and noxious fumes.\nFirefighting efforts have been difficult; officials report that extinguishing one blaze often leads to another smouldering ember reigniting. The Supreme Court of India has expressed concern over the situation, noting the severe environmental and health implications.\nFollowing criticism, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the installation of methane sensors, fire safety equipment, patrolling teams, and fencing at the site.\nSee also\n* Waste management in India\n* Ghazipur landfill\n* Deonar dumping ground\n* Aravalli Range\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mcg.gov.in Municipal Corporation of Gurugram official website]\n* [https://cpcb.nic.in/ Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)]"
