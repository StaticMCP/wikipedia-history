The game was announced on July 7, 2002, and released on November 5, 2002, in North America.\nSynopsis\nThe martial arts-themed RTS takes place seven years prior to the events in the first game.\nThe story begins with Grayback, the last heir to the Wolf clan's throne, explaining that long ago that life was better for their clan before the storms came and drowned their paradise. (Home island) They were saved from death by their druidess order using their clan's most sacred treasure the white wolf's skull, given to them by their clan's totem, the white wolf.\nThe skull guided them to the lands of the Serpent empire where their new neighbors the Serpent and Lotus clan welcomed them as allies but unfortunately they trusted them. Thinking that their lives seemed simple and good again little did they know that Lord Zymeth of the Lotus clan made a deal with the Serpent emperor and attacked them by surprise. The Serpent clan looked away as the Lotus burned their towns and killed their people, many wolvesmen tried to fight back but were unsuccessful, the survivors of the battle became slaves in the Lotus shale mines, ever since then Grayback trained his fellow miners in the arts of war, led them to rebellion and struggle for freedom from the grip of their slave master Mistress Yvaine.\n| MC = 71 out of 100\n| 1UP =\n| GSpot = 7.3 out of 10\n| GameZone = 8.5 out of 10\n| IGN = 7.5 out of 10\n| PCGUS = 68%\n| XPlay =\n| rev1 = ActionTrip\n| rev1Score = 8.1 out of 10\n}}\nBattle Realms: Winter of the Wolf received \"mixed or average,\" according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on reviews from 10 professional critics.
