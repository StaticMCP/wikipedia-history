Originally classified as Eurypterus scabrosus, it was later found to be generically distinct and placed as a member of the family Mycteroptidae. Later in 2005, was assigned to its own genus, and linked to a new own family, Woodwardopteridae inside Mycteropoidea, probably as a sister taxon of Megarachne. W. scarabrosus had carapace length about  and estimated total length about .\nA possible second species, W. freemanorum, was named in 2021 and comes from the Changhsingian (Late Permian) beds of the Baralaba Coal Measures, Bowen Basin, central Queensland, Australia. This possible second species is important due to be the geologically youngest eurypterid discovered (at least 11&nbsp;Ma younger than any previously known relative), showing that large sweep-feeding eurypterids persisted until the end-Permian extinction in the southern high latitudes of Gondwana. W. freemanorum was described by Andrew Rozefelds of Queensland Museum (also adjunct associate at Central Queensland University) and German expert Markus Poschmann of the Generaldirektion Kulturelles Erbe RLP. It was named after Nick Freeman, who discovered the large but incomplete fragment of the creature's cuticle about  long on his family property near Theodore in central Queensland in the 1990s. After being taken to the Queensland museum for identification in 2013, it was subsequently dated as being 252 million years old. Later research showed that this specimen was the last known eurypterid in the world, having lived not long before the end of Permian extinction event, in which around 96 per cent of all species went extinct. It was probably a large sweep-feeder commonly considered as mycteroptid ecology, estimated to have a length of greater than .\nSee also\n* List of eurypterids\nReferences"
