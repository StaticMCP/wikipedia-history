They are named in honor of artist Mike Wieringo and they were founded by the Reisterstown, Maryland–based Cards, Comics, & Collectibles shop alongside the Ringo Awards Committee in 2017, their ceremony meant to succeed the Harvey Awards which left the Baltimore Comic-Con as its venue in 2016.\nThe Ringo Awards are nominated by an open vote among comic-book professionals and fans. The winners are selected from the top two fan choices as the first two nominees and the professional jury selects the remaining three nominees in each category.\nHistory\nThe Ringo Awards were created as an industry award voted by comics professionals and its fans.
