The film had a negative critical reception.\nPlot\nUN operative Neil Shaw is sent to South Korea to stop a potential nuclear threat amidst reunification talks with North Korea. Shaw's team is attacked, resulting in the death of one agent. During the firefight, Shaw encounters Sun Yi, who is with the arms dealers, and takes her into custody. Shaw's superior, Gaines, arrives in South Korea but is intercepted and killed by men working for the arms dealer. They plant evidence to frame Shaw for the murder, making him a fugitive from the FBI and the Triads. Shaw must evade capture, clear his name, and stop the North Korean separatists from acquiring a nuclear bomb.\nCast\n* Anthony \"Treach\" Criss as SAD Agent Neil Shaw\n* Warren Derosa as SAD Agent Jason\n* Lee Sung Hi as Sun Yi\n* Janet Carroll as Secretary General Barnes\n* Leo Lee as Kim\n* Charles Rahi Chun as Byung Hoon\n* Brian Fitzpatrick as Agent Gibs\n* Jack Conley as Gaines\n* David Basila as Wakeen\n* David Frye as Detective Halpin\n* John P.

Though consideration was initially given to releasing it as a stand-alone film named \"Intervention\", it was ultimately released as the third The Art of War film.\nReception\nThe film received a strongly negative critical reaction. DVDtalk called the film \"complete garbage\", singling out the action sequences and Treach's performance. The Movie Scene had similar criticisms, describing the action as \"boringly pedestrian\", accusing Treach of having no charisma, and finding Warren Derosa's performance to be annoying. Movieman's Guide described the plot as \"frankly nonsensical and just plain stupid\", and criticised the poorly-staged gunfights, particularly the film's climax.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
