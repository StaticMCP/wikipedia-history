Called amid a constitutional crisis after the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected the People's Budget, the Liberal government, seeking a mandate, lost their majority.\nScotland was allocated 72 seats in total, with 70 territorial seats, comprising 32 burgh constituencies and 37 county constituencies. There were also two university constituencies, Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities and Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. As voters in university constituencies voted in addition to their territorial vote, the results are compiled separately.\nIn Scotland the election saw little change from the 1906 election, being a second landslide for the Liberal government, which took 58 of the 72 seats. However when combined with results from across the United Kingdom, the election resulted in a hung parliament: Arthur Balfour’s Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won the most votes, but Asquith’s Liberals secured the most seats, edging out the Conservatives by two. With Irish Parliamentary Party support, Asquith remained in power. Labour retained two seats. Archibald Corbett retained his seat of Glasgow Tradeston sitting as an Independent Liberal, however as he had stood in the 1906 election a Liberal Unionist this represented a loss of one seat for the Conservative/Liberal Unionist alliance.\nAnother election followed in December as the Liberal government sought a mandate for the Parliament Act 1911, which would prevent the House of Lords from permanently blocking legislation linked to money bills.\nResults\nSeats summary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Last Election\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#ffd700\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Liberal\n| align=center| 58\n| align=center| 58\n| align=center|\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Conservative and Liberal Unionist (Total)\n| align=center| 11\n| align=center| 12\n| align=center|  1\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#0087dc\" | &nbsp;\n|Conservative\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=center| 7\n| align=center|  1\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#2061a2\" | &nbsp;\n|Liberal Unionist\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=center| 5\n| align=center|  2\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#DC241f\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Labour\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFFAA\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Independent Liberal\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 0\n| align=center|  1\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Total\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center|\n|}\nBurgh & County constituencies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFD700\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Liberal\n| align=center| 58\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 354,847\n| align=center| 54.2\n| align=center|  2.2\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#0281AA\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Conservative and Liberal Unionist\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" |  1\n| align=\"center\" | 260,033\n| align=\"center\" | 39.6\n| align=\"center\" |  1.8\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#DC241f\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Labour Party\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 37,852\n| align=center| 5.1\n| align=center|  2.3\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#D3D3D3\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Other\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" |  1\n| align=\"center\" | 7,710\n| align=\"center\" | 1.1\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Total\n| align=center| 70\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 660,442\n| align=center| 100\n| align=center|\n|}\nUniversity constituencies\nThe two university constituencies each elected an additional member to the house.\n2.0\n}}\n4.0\n}}\n5.1\n}}\n9.9\n}}\n24.0\n}}\n2.7\n}}\n2.2\n}}\n7.1\n}}\nVotes summary\n|titlebar=#ddd|width=700px|barwidth=410px|bars=\n|54.2}}\n||39.6}}\n|5.1}}\n}}\n|titlebar=#ddd|width=700px|barwidth=410px|bars=\n|80.6}}\n||15.2}}\n|2.8}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences"
