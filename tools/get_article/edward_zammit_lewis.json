He is married to Elena Farrugia, a notary, with whom he has a daughter.\nPolitical career\nEdward Zammit Lewis served as President of the Labour Youth Forum () for two consecutive years.  In 1997, he was elected as local councillor for the Labour Party in Attard.\nUntil 2013, he practised as a lawyer at the Courts of Malta, including as a counsel to the Labour Party. Then party leader Joseph Muscat appointed Zammit Lewis to  represent the party in the debate on the rent law reform amendments in 2009.\nAt the March 2013 elections, won by the Labour Party, Zammit Lewis was elected a Member of Parliament for District 8.\nHe was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Competitiveness and Economic Growth.\nFrom April 2014 till June 2017, he served as Minister for Tourism, also responsible for Air Malta (which Zammit Lewis unsuccessfully attempted to sell to Alitalia) and for the film industry in the 1st Muscat cabinet.\nZammit Lewis was re-elected at the 2017 election via a casual election following a seat vacancy on District 8. He was not re-appointed to Cabinet. In the following two years, his law firm received several direct orders from governmental bodies including Identity Malta, the Lands Authority, and the National Development and Social Fund. Zammit Lewis also served as consultant for then-energy minister Konrad Mizzi.\nIn July 2019, Zammit Lewis returned to Cabinet and was appointed Minister for European Affairs and Equality in the 2nd Muscat cabinet, replacing Helena Dalli who had been appointed EU Commissioner. During his tenure, Zammit Lewis employed Saviour Balzan as public relations manager.\nFrom January 2020 till 2022, Zammit Lewis served as Minister for Justice, Governance and Equality in the government led by Robert Abela. During this tenure, Zammit Lewis oversaw the introduction of judicial reforms to comply with the recommendations of the Venice Commission to strengthen the rule of law.\nAbela did not reappoint Zammit Lewis to government following the 2022 Maltese general election.\nIn June 2024, he was nominated by Robert Abela as judge for Malta at the EU General Court. In December 2024, the EU General Court rejected his nomination.\nControversies\nZammit Lewis is considered very close to former Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat, whom he knows since the times of St Aloysius' College. He was part of Muscat's inner circle of aides, also accompanying the prime minister on family holidays, including a stay at a Hilton Hotel in France in 2017, which was paid for by Yorgen Fenech, later accused of masterminding the 2017 assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia.\nIn January 2019, Zammit Lewis mocked Simon Busuttil's calls for an investigation into the company 17 Black in private messages to the company's owner Yorgen Fenech. In the messages, Zammit Lewis also mocked Labour Party supporters and referred to them as dim-witted (). After these messages were revealed to the public in 2021, the NGO Repubblika and the political party AD+PD called for Zammit Lewis' resignation, and Leader of the Opposition Bernard Grech announced his intention to call for a motion of no confidence in him in parliament. Zammit Lewis refused to resign, claiming he had already made public his acquaintance with Yorgen Fenech.\nIn September 2019, Yorgen Fenech offered Zammit Lewis to employ his supporters within his Tumas Group. Such arrangements had already occasionally taken place since 2014, when Zammit Lewis was minister of tourism. Zammit Lewis stated that this is a \"normal practice among politicians\" to help their constituents.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
