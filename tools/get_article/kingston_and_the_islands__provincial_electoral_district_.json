It has been represented by Ted Hsu since 2022.\nDemographics\n* Average family income: $68,494 (2001)\n* Median household income: $46,310\n* Unemployment: 7.4%\n* Language, Mother Tongue: English  84%, French 3%, Other 13%\n* Religion: Protestant 44%, Catholic 33%, Orthodox Christian 1%, Other Christian 2%, Muslim 1%, Jewish 1%, Non Religious Affiliation 18%, Other 1%\n* Visible Minority: Black 1%, Chinese 1%, South Asian 1%, Others 2%\nBoundaries\nThe riding was created before the 1967 provincial election. Its initial area consisted of the townships of Amherst Island, Howe Island and Wolfe Island, the city of Kingston and the islands in the St. Lawrence River within the county of Frontenac. In 1986, it was changed slightly to include Kingston and the three major islands plus all the land south of Highway 401 within the township of Pittsburgh.\nIn 1996, the provincial government reduced the number of ridings in the province from 130 to 103. They also directed the new ridings to correspond to the boundaries of the existing federal ridings. At that time, the federal counterpart, Kingston and the Islands, existed with the same boundaries as the current provincial riding. After the 1999 election, minor changes to the riding were made along with the federal counterpart in 2003 and 2013.\nMembers of Provincial Parliament\n* For Keith Norton's Legislative Assembly information see\n* For Ken Keyes's Legislative Assembly information see\n* For Gary Wilson's Legislative Assembly information see\n* For John Gerretsen's Legislative Assembly information see\n* For Sophie Kiwala's Legislative Assembly information see\n}}\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2014 general election redistributed results\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Liberal ||align=right| 19,698 ||align=right| 42.06\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| New Democratic ||align=right| 13,781 ||align=right| 29.42\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Progressive Conservative ||align=right| 9,744||align=right| 20.80\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Green ||align=right| 3,388 ||align=right| 7.23\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Freedom ||align=right| 224 ||align=right| 0.48\n|}\n2007 electoral reform referendum\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; clear:both\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=4|2007 Ontario electoral reform referendum\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=2 style=\"width: 130px\"|Side\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"blue\"|\n|First Past the Post\n|26,473\n|54.6\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"green\"|\n|Mixed member proportional\n|21,968\n|45.4\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"white\"|\n!Total valid votes\n| 48,431\n|100.0\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/preo/2017atlasmaps/046KingstonandtheIslandsAtlasMap.pdf Map of riding for 2018 election]"
