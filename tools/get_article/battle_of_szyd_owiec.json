It began when Polish insurgents under Captain  and Colonel Marian Langiewicz attacked the town of Szydłowiec (Congress Poland), where a garrison of the Imperial Russian Army stayed.\nSzydlowiec was defended by an infantry regiment under Major Rudigier. Polish insurgents attacked the town three times, but after initial successes, they were forced to retreat, losing five men. The town eventually remained in Russian hands. After retreating, Langiewicz's unit went to Wąchock.\nFive insurgents were killed, several wounded, and three wounded Poles were taken prisoner by the Russians. Among the Polish casualties were high school students. Russian losses totaled 24 killed, wounded or taken prisoner.\nReferences"
