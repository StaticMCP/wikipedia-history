It produced the singles \"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\", a collaboration with 'N Sync, \"Small Stuff\", \"We Made Love\" and \"Twentieth Century\", which respectively reached No. 3, No. 24, No. 63, and No. 51 on the Hot Country Songs charts. In addition, \"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\" was the band's last Top 10 hit on the country charts.\n\"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time On You\" was originally recorded by 'N Sync in 1998 on their first album *NSYNC.\nThe album peaked at No. 5 on Billboard Country Albums chart and No. 51 on the Billboard 200.\nCritical reception\n}}\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote \"There's not a note out of place or a missed harmony. It's easy to marvel at the sheer technical achievement of the record, since not only is it so well made, but the songs rarely make an impression…That's the problem with Twentieth Century: although it's pleasant, it never creates its own identity, even compared to latter-day Alabama records.\" He praised \"Twentieth Century\", \"Mist of Desire\", \"Life's Too Short to Love This Fast\", and \"God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You\" as the best tracks, but said that \"taken in the context of the record, they're nearly indistinguishable from the rest\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCompiled from liner notes.\nAlabama\n* Randy Owen – vocals, acoustic guitars\n* Jeff Cook – vocals, electric guitars, lead vocals (8)\n* Teddy Gentry – vocals, bass guitar, lead vocals (6)\nMark Herndon is not credited on the album.\nAdditional musicians\n* John Barlow Jarvis – acoustic  piano, keyboards, Hammond B3 organ\n* Brian D.
