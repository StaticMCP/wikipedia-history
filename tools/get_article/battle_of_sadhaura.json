The imperial forces were defeated and took refuge behind the city's walls. Banda's forces captured the fort and levelled it to the ground. It resulted in a victory for the Sikhs where Banda Singh Bahadur defeated Osman Khan.\nBackground\nSadhaura was ruled by Osman Khan, who had tortured and executed the Muslim Pir Syed Badruddin Shah (also known as Pir Budhu Shah), for helping Guru Gobind Singh in the Battle of Bhangani. And also for the atrocities committed against Hindus by Osman Khan where the cows were slaughtered in front of their homes and his order which forbade Hindus and Sikhs from cremating their dead and performing their religious events, which led the Sikhs to march to Sadhaura.\nAftermath\nOsman Khan was captured and chastised. Many aggrieved peasants who wanted to revolt against the ruling elites joined the forces of Banda Singh Bahadur and thus, the angry mob revolted with plunder and destruction of town and killed everyone who took shelter in the house of Syed Badruddin Shah. Banda's forces sacked the city and a general massacre of the city inhabitants ensued. Osman Khan was subsequently captured and hanged to death by the Sikhs. Banda Singh Bahadur later appointed his own governor in Sadhaura.\nReferences"
