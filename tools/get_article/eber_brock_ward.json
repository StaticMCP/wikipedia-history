He started as an owner of steamship interests, and later accumulated woodlands, as well as lands that contained iron ore, copper and silver. His investments would ultimately include newspapers, railroads, glass manufacturing, banking, and insurance companies.\nEarly life\nWard was born in Applegaths Mills, Upper Canada on December 25, 1811.\nWhile in Waterford, Pennsylvania, Ward's mother fell ill and died and the family moved to Detroit.\nBusiness\nShipping\nWard obtained a job as a cabin boy and deck hand when he was twelve or thirteen years old at Marine City, Michigan and worked for a time for Samuel Ward, his uncle. Ward came in contact with marine transactions this way, and learned the industry.\nWard invested in a vessel called the General Harrison, as a 25 percent owner, and became the master of this vessel in 1835. He was successful as its operator, but eventually became a partner with his uncle at Marine City. He was successful at this enterprise, and continued this until 1850, when he moved to Detroit. There he was involved in the shipbuilding business, and his operations participated in the construction of steamers and sailing ships; among them were the Arctic, Atlantic, B.F. Wade, Detroit, General Harrison, Huron, Montgomery, Ocean, Pacific, Planet, Samuel Ward, Caspian, Champion, and Pearl.\nRailroading\nStarting around 1852, Ward acquired timberlands along the Pere Marquette River in Lake County, near the Ludington area. He held onto this land, waiting for the timber to mature. He was elected president of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad Company in 1860, and was the first to use rail made of Bessemer steel.\nSteel manufacturing\nBessemer steel was produced at Kelly Pneumatic Process Company around 1864 or 1865.\nLogging\nWard carried on logging operations in Lake County through his agents. In 1869 he purchased a tract consisting of  in the fourth ward of Ludington, on Lake Pere Marquette, accessible by the Pere Marquette River.\nWard built a sawmill out on Lake Pere Marquette in 1870, known as the \"North\" mill. It was built on 55 stone piers, and was  by  in size. It was equipped with two circular mills, and \"cutting-edge technology\". The cost of the mill was $60,000 (), and it had a capacity of  per day. Ward purchased all the land between his mill and that of Messrs. Danaher and Melendy, which bordered on the Lake in the spring of 1871. During the summer months, he built a  by  warehouse near the original mill. This was used for storing supplies, and selling supplies to his employees. The next year Ward, built another mill nearby, which was called the \"South\" mill. This was then considered the best sawmill in the United States.\nMining\nWard engaged in silver mining around Lake Superior with the Silver Islet Mining Company.\nPersonal life\nWard was married twice. His first marriage, on July 24, 1837, was to Mary Margaret McQueen of Newport, Michigan, who had seven children that grew to adulthood. His second marriage, in 1869, was to Catherine Lyon of Conneaut, Ohio.\nWard died of a stroke on January 2, 1875. He owned about a million dollars' worth of stock in the North Chicago Rolling Mill company, and about half a million dollars' worth of stock of the Milwaukee Rolling Mill company. He also had about a half a million in the Wyandotte Rolling Mill. He left seven children. He last lived at West Fort Street and 19th Ave in Detroit. Ward is buried in Elmwood Cemetery.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023214024/http://www.mfhn.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=33 Michigan Pioneer and Historical Collections]"
