In 1932 he was nominated for an Academy Award for his adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel Arrowsmith, and he was nominated again in 1936 for Dodsworth, which he had adapted for the stage in 1934. In 1940 he was awarded a posthumous Academy Award for the screenplay for Gone with the Wind. During his career he wrote or adapted over seventy plays and eleven films.\nSidney Howard was one of the founding members of the Playwrights' Company.\nHoward died in 1939 at the age of forty-eight.
