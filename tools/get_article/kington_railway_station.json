Replacing an earlier terminus station which had been opened in 1857, the station was opened in 1875 and closed in 1964. The final passenger service had been on 5 February 1955, and passenger services were withdrawn two days later.\nThe 1857 station building can still be seen on what is now the Hatton Gardens Industrial Estate.\nA model of the station, as it appeared in the mid-1940s, may be viewed at the nearby Kington Museum.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\nLine and station closed|next=Line and station closed|route=Great Western RailwayKington and Eardisley Railway|col= }}"
