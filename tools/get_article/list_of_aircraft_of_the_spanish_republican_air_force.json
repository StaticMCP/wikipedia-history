In the summer of 1936 the beleaguered Spanish Republic found itself direly in need of modern weapons, but the governments of the United Kingdom and France quickly led a policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. In defiance of the non-intervention pact some aircraft were sent to Republican Spain from France thanks to the efforts of personalities supporting the republican cause, but these consisted mostly in old material, including trainers, transport aircraft and planes without weapons that could not be used for attacks. Owing to the international blockade against the republic other planes of dubious value were acquired by the republican government through various sources, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Belgium and Czechoslovakia which included a motley combination of obsolete aircraft, prototypes and almost discarded single models. Some of the shipments of aircraft did not make it to the Spanish fronts owing to the sinking of the merchant vessels transporting them or having been seized by the customs at the ports of origin. The most well-known Spanish Republican Air Force planes such as the 'Chato', 'Mosca', 'Natacha' and 'Katiuska' would come later in the same year and throughout 1937, when the USSR would decide to openly assist the Spanish Republic.\nDocuments\nInformation, both written and pictorial, regarding the identification of the aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force is found in a variety of sources. These include press reports of the time, official republican government documents, as well as documents and reports from the rebel side.\nSince republican aerodromes were restricted military areas, relatively few photographs are available. Most are pictures of aircraft taken with air force personnel posing near them in an informal way, as well as photographs of crashed planes. Except for the primary aircraft, certain republican military plane types were never photographed, or if available, photographs have not been found, being only known from written documents or from pilot reports. This is often the case in the assorted —often obsolete and almost useless— aircraft of which only one or two units arrived in the first critical months at the beginning of the civil war. There are also aircraft which had been known only from written documents, such as the Spanish Republican Air Force Farman F.430, of which a picture has surfaced only recently.\nAttack aircraft\n* Beechcraft Staggerwing\n* Breguet XIX\n* Gourdou-Leseurre GL.32\n* Gourdou-Leseurre GL-633\n* Grumman G-23, nicknamed 'Delfín'\n* Hispano-Suiza E-30\n* Potez 25\n* Vickers Vildebeest\nBombers\n* Bloch MB.200, photographic data are lacking\n* Bloch MB.210\n* Breguet 413,\n* Breguet 460 Vultur\n* Fokker F.IX\n* Hawker Spanish Osprey\n* Latecoere 28\n* Macchi M.18\n* Polikarpov R-5, also known as 'Rasante'\n* Polikarpov R-Z, nicknamed 'Natacha'\n* Potez 540\n* Tupolev SB, nicknamed 'Katiuska'\n* Vultee V-1\nFighters\n* AEKKEA-RAAB R-29\n* Avia BH-33\n* Bristol Bulldog (1 only for evaluation)\n* Blériot-SPAD S.51\n* Blériot-SPAD S.91\n* Boeing 281 (1 example only)\n* Dewoitine D.27\n* Dewoitine D.53\n* Dewoitine D.372\n* Dewoitine D.510\n* Fokker D.XXI\n* Hawker Hispano Fury\n* Letov Š-31\n* Letov Š-231\n* Letov Š-331 (1 example only)\n* Loire 46\n* Martinsyde F.4 Buzzard\n* Hispano-Nieuport Ni-52\n* Polikarpov I-15, nicknamed 'Chato'\n* Polikarpov I-16, nicknamed 'Mosca'\nPatrol and liaison aircraft\n* Caudron C.600 Aiglon\n* de Havilland DH.83 Fox Moth\n* Dornier Do J Wal\n* Fokker C.X\n* Lockheed Model 9 Orion\n* Macchi M.18\n* Miles Falcon\n* Potez 58\n* RWD 9\n* Sikorsky S-38B, one unit was used in the Northern Front.
