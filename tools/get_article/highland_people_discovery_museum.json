Overlooking a tree-lined lake, the very pretty and peaceful setting makes a visit worthwhile, as does the opportunity to learn something about the various hill tribes before heading off on a trek.\" The \"useful wall chart\" explains life in a village around the year, \"giving a month-by-month picture of the agricultural activities, ceremonies and festivals of the tribes featured\", while the photographs and models of village houses give \"a good idea of the different styles of architecture, and a display of hill tribe instruments accompanied by taped music\".\nThe New York Times quotes Frommer on the Tribal Museum: ''\"Formerly part of Chiang Mai University's Tribal Research Institute, this small exhibit showcases the cultures and daily lives of the hill tribe people of Thailand's north. It is recommended as a good introductory course for those who plan to visit many northern villages.\"\nThailand's World recommends the Tribal Museum, writing \"A visit to the Tribal Museum is strongly recommended as an introduction to the cultures and practices of the current hill tribes of northern Thailand. This museum serves as an extensive resource centre for the tribal cultures, and the visitor will certainly leave with a better understanding of each hill tribe. It is unique and compact, and together with the nearby National Museum of Chiang Mai, can be viewed in half a day.\"''\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://highlandmuseum.or.th/ Website of the museum]\n* [https://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/sightseeing/13223/chiang-mai-tribal-museum Bangkok Post: Travel]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111016160433/http://thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=339 Thailand's World]"
