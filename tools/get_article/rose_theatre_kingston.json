The theatre seats 822 around a wide, thrust stage.\nIt officially opened on 16 January, 2008 with the play Uncle Vanya written by Anton Chekhov and directed by Sir Peter Hall. Hall had also directed an \"in the raw\" production of As You Like It within the shell of the uncompleted building in December 2004.\nDesign\nThe theatre's layout is based on that of the Rose Theatre in London, an Elizabethan theatre that staged the plays of Christopher Marlowe and early plays by Shakespeare. It features a shallow thrust stage. Unlike the original Rose, it makes the Elizabethan design more comfortable by adding a roof and modern seats, rather like the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. The auditorium has since been refurbished to include stall seating in the pit area – reaching a total number of 822 seats.\nHistory\nThe Rose was a project supported by Peter Hall and broadcaster David Jacobs CBE, who served as chairman of the Kingston Theatre Trust.\nThe construction was undertaken with £5m (of the £11m construction cost) support from the local council, involvement from Kingston University, Peter Hall, and the Friends of Kingston Theatre. The shell of the building was provided to the Trust for free by St George plc as one of the concessions for the construction of Charter Quay, a development on the bank of the Thames.\nIn January 2008, a week after the theatre opened, Hall resigned and it was announced that from April 2008, Stephen Unwin, departing director of English Touring Theatre would take over the role of Artistic Director, while Hall would remain as director emeritus.\nOn 25 November, 2010, the Rose won an award for \"Commitment to the Community,\" at the Kingston Business Awards. The same week, Sir Peter Hall won the Moscow Art Theatre Golden Seagull award for his contribution to World Theatre at the Evening Standard Awards.\nThe Rose is supported by the Royal Borough of Kingston and Kingston University. However, it receives no funding from Arts Council England.\nRose Theatre productions\nThe Rose has staged an increasing number of home-grown productions. Some highlights include ''Love's Labour's Lost, directed by Sir Peter Hall; A Christmas Carol''; Terence Rattigan's The Winslow Boy with Timothy West; Sir Peter Hall's revival of Alan Ayckbourn's Bedroom Farce with Jane Asher and Nicholas Le Prevost (which later transferred to the West End) in repertoire with Miss Julie; Treasure Island; Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream; Dumb Show'' by Joe Penhall; Noël Coward's Hay Fever with Celia Imrie; Three Musketeers; As You Like It; Jane Asher returned for Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest performed in rep with the premiere of Harley Granville-Barker's Farewell to the Theatre; The Snow Queen; Joely Richardson in The Lady from the Sea; Alison Steadman in Michael Frayn's Here; and The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.\n2018\n* Curtains\n* Much Ado About Nothing, starring Mel Giedroyc as Beatrice and John Hopkins as Benedick\n*''Hogarth's Progress, starring Keith Allen and Bryan Dick\n*Don Carlos, starring Tom Burke as The Marquis of Posa\n*Hansel & Gretel\n2019\n*Zog\n*Stones in his Pockets\n*The Cat in the Hat\n*Captain Corelli's Mandolin\n*Valued Friends\n*The Snow Queen''\nGraduation ceremonies\nKingston University has held its graduation ceremonies at the Rose Theatre since 2010 (students completing their degree in 2009); they were, for many years, previously held at the Royal Albert Hall and in 2009, at the Royal Festival Hall.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rosetheatre.org/ Official website]"
