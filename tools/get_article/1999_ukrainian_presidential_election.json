The result was a victory for Leonid Kuchma, who defeated Petro Symonenko in the run-off, winning a second consecutive presidential election.\nAs of , this is the only re-election of an incumbent president in the history of independent Ukraine.\nElectoral system\nAt the time of election the population in Ukraine was 50,105,600 with 34,017,400 living in cities. The Donetsk Oblast, the most populous oblast, contained the most electoral districts, with 23. The least electoral districts among oblasts were in the Chernivtsi Oblast, which only had 4. The city of Kyiv had 12 electoral districts and Sevastopol 2. There also was a special out-of-country district available for voters who at the time of elections were not available to vote in Ukraine.\nRegistration\nA total of 32 individuals applied for registration as candidates for the presidency, of whom 19 were registered by the Central Election Commission of Ukraine; the other 13 had their applications rejected.\nSince the summer of 1999 there was heavy competition between candidates. Four candidates Yevhen Marchuk, Oleksandr Moroz,  (mayor of Cherkasy), and Oleksandr Tkachenko (speaker of the Verkhovna Rada) met in Kaniv and called on all candidates to ensure just and honest elections. The \"Kaniv Four\" had intentions to present a single candidate who would have a better chance of success. However, they failed to do so and no-one else joined them. On 27 October Oliynyk withdrew his candidacy in favor of Yevhen Marchuk, while Oleksandr Tkachenko favored Petro Symonenko (leader of the Communist Party of Ukraine).\nRegistered candidates\nUdovenko and Kostenko initially were denied in registration, but on 21 May 1999 both were registered.\n* Oleksandr Bazylyuk, by Slavic Party\n* Hennadiy Balashov, by group of voters (Dnipropetrovsk)\n* , by Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists\n* Nataliya Vitrenko, by Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine\n* , by Patriotic Party of Ukraine\n* Yuriy Karmazin, by Motherland Defenders Party\n* Vitaliy Kononov, by Party of Greens of Ukraine\n* Yuriy Kostenko, by group of voters (Kyiv)\n* Leonid Kuchma, by group of voters (Kyiv)\n* Yevhen Marchuk, by Bloc \"Our President - Yevhen Marchuk!\" (Social-Democratic Union, Christian-People's Union, Ukrainian Republican Party, Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party)\n* Oleksandr Moroz, by Socialist Party of Ukraine\n* Hryhoriy Novodvorsky, by group of voters (Dashiv, Vinnytsia Oblast)\n* , by group of voters (Kirovohrad)\n* Vasyl Onopenko, by Ukrainian Social Democratic Party\n* , by group of voters (Khmelnytskyi)\n* Oleksandr Rzhavsky, by All-Ukrainian Political Association \"One Family\"\n* Petro Symonenko, by Communist Party of Ukraine\n* Oleksandr Tkachenko, by Peasant Party of Ukraine\n* Hennadiy Udovenko, by National Movement of Ukraine\nRegistration denied\n* Mykola Havrylov\n* Borys Holodyuk, by group of voters (Monastyrets, Lviv Oblast)\n* Volodymyr Huba, by group of voter (Kyiv)\n* Valentyna Datsenko, by All-Ukrainian Party of Female Initiatives\n* Tetyana Zadorozhna, by group of voters (Shakhtarsk)\n* Oleh Kalashnikov, by group of voters (Kyiv)\n* Valeriy Korotkov, by Women National Party (united)\n* Dmytro Korchynsky, by group of voters (Pohoriltsi, Chernihiv Oblast)\n* Pavlo Lazarenko, by Hromada\n* Oleksandr Pukhkal, by group of voters (Mykolaivka, Kirovohrad Oblast)\n* Marian Roketsky, by group of voters (Ivano-Frankivsk)\n* Andriy Taranenko, by group of voters (Kyiv)\n* Volodymyr Yurchenko, by group of voters (Kyiv)\nCandidates\nAll pretenders were required to collect signatures to become candidates.
