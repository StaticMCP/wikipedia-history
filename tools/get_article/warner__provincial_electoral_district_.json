The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.\nThe plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A, asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B, asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton, asked if men and women should be allowed to drink together in establishments.\nProvince wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Warner voted against the proposal with a heavy majority. The voter turnout in the district was well below the province wide average of 46%.\nOfficial district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957. The Social Credit government in power at the time did not consider the results binding. However the results of the vote led the government to repeal all existing liquor legislation and introduce an entirely new Liquor Act.\nMunicipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against the plebiscite such as Warner were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones. Business owners who wanted a licence had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a licence.\nSee also\n* List of Alberta provincial electoral districts\n* Canadian provincial electoral districts\n* Warner, a town in southern Alberta\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.electionsalberta.ab.ca/ Elections Alberta]\n*[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ The Legislative Assembly of Alberta]"
