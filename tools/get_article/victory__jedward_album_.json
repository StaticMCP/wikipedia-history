The album was released on 5 August 2011 in Ireland and on 15 August 2011 in the United Kingdom.  It was the 18th best selling album in Ireland in the year 2011. It was also certified double platinum in Ireland that year, thus becoming the duo's second consecutive album to receive that certification in their home country.\nBackground\nJedward began recording tracks for the album in January 2011. In February 2011, it was announced that the pair would be representing Ireland at the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest, after winning a nationwide competition against four other acts. The pair announced the song they would representing with would be \"Lipstick\", a song recorded for their upcoming second studio album. \"Lipstick\" was subsequently released as the album's lead single in February 2011. In the final of the competition, Jedward scored 119 points and finished 8th, giving Ireland its best result in eleven years. The single was released across Europe following the final, and three months after its release, it peaked at #1 on the Irish Singles Chart.\nIn March 2011, a 30-second preview of a song entitled \"Bad Behaviour\" was posted on the twins' official YouTube channel. A further clip was posted in May, this time of a song entitled \"Distortion\". Both songs were previewed on tour dates for the Planet Jedward Tour. In June 2011, Jedward announced that recording on the album had been completed, and the album was scheduled for release in August. In July 2011, the track listing for the album was announced via Digital Spy. On 1 July, Jedward announced that the title of the album would be Victory. On the same day, the album's second single, \"Bad Behaviour\", was released via iTunes, and on 8 July, the song became the duo's third single to peak at #1 in Ireland. Upon its release in August 2011, the album peaked at #1 on the Irish Albums Chart.\nFollowing Jedward's success in Eurovision, a new version of their album Planet Jedward was released in Europe. Despite its name, it was based around songs recorded for Victory, using seven previously unreleased tracks from the as yet unreleased album.\nIn September 2011, the album was released across Europe and Asia, complete with three bonus tracks that did not appear on the original version.  In November 2011, the album's third single, \"Wow Oh Wow\", was released.\n\"Everyday Superstar\" was released as a promotional single in August 2011.\nTrack listing\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title13         = Bad Behaviour\n| note13          = Wideboys Radio Edit\n| length13        = 3:34\n| writer13        = Daniel Priddy, Reuben Priddy\n| extra13         = Daniel Priddy, Wideboys\n}}\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title13         = Go Getter\n| writer13        = Daniel Priddy, Lars Halvor Jensen, Martin Michael Larsson\n| extra13         = DEEKAY\n| length13        = 3:42\n| title14         = Get Up And Dance\n| length14        = 3:28\n| writer14        = Allan Eshuijs, Simon Hermansen, Lars Halvor Jensen\n| extra14         = DEEKAY and Gettic\n| title15         = Bad Behaviour\n| note15          = Wideboys Radio Edit\n| length15        = 3:34\n| writer15        = Daniel Priddy, Reuben Priddy\n| extra15         = Daniel Priddy, Wideboys\n}}\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title16         = Lipstick\n| note16          = Instrumental\n| length16        = 3:52\n| writer16        = Daniel Priddy, Lars Halvor Jensen, Martin Michael Larsson\n| extra16         = DEEKAY\n}}\nChart performance\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2011)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|Irish Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n|Scottish Albums Chart\n|align=center|31\n|-\n|UK Albums Chart\n|align=center|34\n|}\nReferences"
