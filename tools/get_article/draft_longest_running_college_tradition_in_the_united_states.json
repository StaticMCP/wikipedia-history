However, only the University of Montevallo’s annual \"College Night\" tradition has run without interruption since 1919 making it the longest running U.S. college tradition.\n“Class Day” at Yale University and Dartmouth College, an event for graduating seniors, was SUSPENDED for some of World War II. Yale’s “Class Day” events were also CANCELED in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic.\n“Tinker Day” at Hollins University (Roanoke, VA) was NOT held in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic.\nHope College’s (Holland, MI) annual tug-of-war tradition called “The Pull” did NOT occur 1899-1908, 1918, 1943, 1944, and 2020.\nThe “College Night” tradition at the University of Montevallo (UM), Montevallo, Alabama, was begun in 1919. Despite world wars and a global pandemic, it has occurred annually and uninterrupted. Thus, UM’s College Night is the longest running college tradition in the United States.\nReferences\nInformation for each tradition mentioned in this article was confirmed by the respective educational institutions."
