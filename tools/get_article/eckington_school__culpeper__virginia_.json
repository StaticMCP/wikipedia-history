It was built in 1895, and is a one-story, vernacular frame structure. It measures 20 feet by 26 feet, and is clad in weatherboard. It was used as a school until 1941, after which it was used as a church hall for the adjoining Free Union Baptist Church.  At that time, a 10 foot by 20 foot addition was built.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.\nReferences\nExternal links"
