      "text": "# NBA G League Team Executive of the Year Award\n\nThe NBA Development League Team Executive of the Year is an annual NBA Development League (D-League) award given since the 2009–10 season to the top front office executive involved in team operations. The award is determined by peer voting and teams are not allowed to vote for themselves. Jon Jennings, the President and General Manager of the Maine Red Claws, was the inaugural winner. He was recognized for leading a team that sold out its inaugural season, led the league in merchandise sales and ticket revenue, and was among the top teams in sponsorship revenue. Matt Bresee would earn the honor during the Erie BayHawks' final season of operation as a sense of recognition for his work while the team operated under the three different teams that work beyond them now in the Osceola Magic, College Park Skyhawks, and Birmingham Squadron.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
