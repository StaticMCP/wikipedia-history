Born in Los Angeles, his playing first came to prominence in the 1950s as a protégé of pianist Lennie Tristano and earned attention in the 1970s as a member of Supersax.\nBiography\nMarsh came from an affluent artistic background: his father was Hollywood cinematographer Oliver T. Marsh (1892–1941), and his mother Elizabeth was a violinist. He was the nephew of actresses Mae Marsh and Marguerite Marsh and film editor Frances Marsh.\nHe was tutored by Lennie Tristano. Marsh was often recorded in the company of other Cool School musicians, and remained one of the most faithful to the Tristano philosophy of improvisation – the faith in the purity of the long line, the avoidance of licks and emotional chain-pulling, the concentration on endlessly mining the same small body of jazz standards. While Marsh was a generally cool-toned player, the critic Scott Yanow notes that Marsh played with \"more fire than one would expect\" in certain contexts.\nMarsh's rhythmically subtle lines are immediately recognizable. He has been called by Anthony Braxton \"the greatest vertical improviser\" (i.e., improvising that emphasizes harmony/chords more than melody). In the 1970s, he gained renewed exposure as a member of Supersax, a large ensemble which played orchestral arrangements of Charlie Parker solos. Marsh also recorded one of his most celebrated albums, All Music, with the Supersax rhythm section during this period.\nMarsh died of a heart attack onstage at the Los Angeles club Donte's in 1987, in the middle of playing the tune \"Out of Nowhere\". He left a widow, Geraldyne Marsh, and two sons, K.C. Marsh and Jason Marsh. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\nThough he remains something of a cult figure among jazz fans and musicians, his influence has grown since his death; younger players such as Mark Turner have borrowed from his music as a way of counterbalancing the pervasive influence of John Coltrane.  Marsh's discography remains somewhat scattered and elusive, as much of it was done for small labels, but more and more of his work has been issued on compact disc in recent years.\nA documentary is being made about him: Warne Marsh: An Improvised Life, directed by his eldest son, K.C. Marsh.\nDiscography\nAs leader/co-leader\n* 1952 - Live in Hollywood (Xanadu, 1979)\n* 1955 - Lee Konitz with Warne Marsh (Atlantic) with Lee Konitz\n* 1956 - Jazz of Two Cities (Imperial) also released as The Winds of Marsh (Imperial, 1959)\n* 1956 - Art Pepper with Warne Marsh (Contemporary, 1986)\n*1957 - The Right Combination (Riverside) with Joe Albany\n* 1957 - Music for Prancing (Mode, 1957)\n* 1957-58 - Warne Marsh (Atlantic)\n*1959 - The Art of Improvising (Revelation, 1974) - excerpts with only the W.
