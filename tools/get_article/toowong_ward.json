      "text": "# Toowong Ward\n\nToowong Ward was a Brisbane City Council ward from 1925 to 1973, and again from 1994 to 2016. Both incarnations were based in Brisbane's inner west, covering Toowong, Queensland and surrounding suburbs.\nAcross both its incarnations, the ward was almost exclusively represented by members of the Liberal Party/Liberal National Party or their precursors.\nHistory\nFirst incarnation\nThe first incarnation of Toowong Ward was established with the creation of the City of Brisbane, and was one of the original 20 wards contested at the 1925 Brisbane City Council election. The ward was created using the boundaries of the Electoral district of Toowong, as the city originally defined its wards on the state electoral districts that were fully or partially within its boundaries. The ward also largely succeeded the Town of Toowong, which was one of 20 LGAs abolished to form the new city.\nThe ward was one of only nine original wards to be contested at every election from 1925 to 1970; expansions of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1950 and 1960 having indirectly abolished a number of wards, and increased the total wards to 28. However, ahead of the 1973 council election, the Country Party state government altered the City's electoral acts in a bid to remove incumbent Labor Lord Mayor Clem Jones. This included a reduction from 28 to 21 wards, which meant the city could no longer define its ward boundaries using state districts. As such, all 28 wards were abolished and replaced by wards with different names to the state districts. The abolished Toowong Ward was split between the new wards of Auchenflower and Indooroopilly.\nSecond incarnation\nThe second incarnation of the ward was established for the 1994 election, and was created from parts of the abolished Taringa Ward and the second incarnation of Paddington Ward.\nThe ward's was represented by Judy Magub from the 1994 election until her resignation in 2007. Peter Matic was appointed to fill the resulting vacancy and represented the ward until its abolition.\nSuccessive redistributions saw the ward lose the majority of the suburb of Toowong to Walter Taylor Ward, leading to it being abolished ahead of the 2016 election. Its area largely became part of the third incarnation of Paddington Ward, with incumbent councillor Matic successfully contesting the new ward.\nCouncillors for Toowong Ward\nFirst incarnation\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Archibald Watson\n| United\n| 21 February 1925 – 12 May 1925\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Served as the final mayor of the Town of Toowong.Vacated position upon becoming Lord Mayor.\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Nationalist Civic\n| 12 May 1925 – 24 February 1931\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Harry Massey\n| Civic Reform\n| 2 May 1931 – 28 April 1934\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Did not contest 1937 election.\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Independent\n| 28 April 1934 – 1937\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| William Richer Moon\n| Citizens' Municipal Organisation\n| 1937 – 30 April 1955\n| Did not contest 1955 election.\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Lex Ord\n| Citizens' Municipal Organisation\n| 30 April 1955 – 31 March 1973\n| Ward abolished.
