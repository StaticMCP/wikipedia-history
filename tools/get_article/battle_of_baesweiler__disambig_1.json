Peace was only maintained by the involvement of the Landfrieden.  After mercenaries robbed a number of Brabantine merchants on the territory of William II, Duke of Jülich in 1371, William refused to pay reparation to Wenceslaus I of Luxembourg, the Duke of Brabant, let alone punish the mercenaries, instead protecting them and even hiring some. As Wenceslas prepared his forces, William sought help from his brother-in-law, Edward, Duke of Guelders.\nBattle\nOn 20 August, Wenceslas led his army of 2,500 from the border town of Maastricht towards the enemy capital of Jülich. The army advanced slowly, burning and looting as it went and by the evening of 21 August was encamped near the town of Baesweiler north of Aachen. On 22 August, Wenceslas' army was confronted by the smaller force of William, Duke of Jülich which consisted of 1,600 troops. Two different versions of what happened next are recorded. In one, the army of Jülich attacked in the morning while the Brabant forces were at mass. In the other, the army of Brabant had the best of the fighting until the late appearance of the troops of Edward, Duke of Guelders, perhaps from ambush.\nThe battle ended with the capture of the Wenceslas, Duke of Brabant, and William, Margrave of Namur, and the death of the Edward of Guelders. Guy I of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny, a distant relative of the Wenceslas, was also killed. Wenceslas was incarcerated at Nideggen at Roer.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022214056/http://www.graafschap-middeleeuwen.nl/oorlogvoering/slag-baesweiler.html Slag bij Baesweiler]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050909120342/http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/boen001brab01/boen001brab01_249.htm Chronicle \"Brabantsche Yeesten\" in medieval Dutch]"
