They are awards \"by writers to writers\". The panelists are five \"writers who are known to be doing great work in their genre or field\".\nThe original National Book Awards recognized the \"Most Distinguished\" biography and nonfiction books (two) of 1935 and 1936, and the \"Favorite\" nonfiction books of 1937 to 1940. The \"Bookseller Discovery\" and the \"Most Original Book\" sometimes recognized nonfiction. (See below.)\nThe general \"Nonfiction\" award was one of three when the National Book Awards were re-established in 1950 for 1949 publications, which the National Book Foundation considers the origin of its current Awards series.\nFrom 1964 to 1983, under different administrators, there were multiple nonfiction categories.\nThe current Nonfiction award recognizes one book written by a U.S. citizen and published in the U.S. from December 1 to November 30. The National Book Foundation accepts nominations from publishers until June 15, requires mailing nominated books to the panelists by August 1, and announces five finalists in October. The winner is announced on the day of the final ceremony in November. The award is $10,000 and a bronze sculpture; other finalists get $1000, a medal, and a citation written by the panel.\nThe sculpture by Louise Nevelson dates from the 1980 awards. The $10,000 and $1000 cash prizes and autumn recognition for current-year publications date from 1984.\nAbout 200 books were nominated for the 1984 award when the single award for general nonfiction was restored.\nMultiple nonfiction categories (1964–1983)\nFor the 1963/1964 cycle, three new award categories replaced \"Nonfiction\": Arts and Letters; History and Biography; Science, Philosophy and Religion. For the next twenty years there were at least three award categories for nonfiction books marketed to adult readers and the term \"Nonfiction\" was used only 1980 to 1983 (\"General Nonfiction\", hardcover and paperback).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Scope of \"Nonfiction\" as covered in the following tables\n!timespan\n!of all\nawards\n!list of \"Nonfiction\" categories covered below\n|-\n|1964–1966\n|3 of 5\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Arts and Letters; History and Biography; Science, Philosophy and Religion\n|-\n|1967–1968\n|3 of 6\n|-\n|1969–1971\n|3 of 7\n|Arts and Letters; History and Biography; \"The Sciences\" or \"Philosophy and Religion\" alternating\n|-\n|1972–1975\n|6 of 10\n|Arts and Letters; Biography; Contemporary Affairs; History; Philosophy and Religion; The Sciences\n|-\n|1976\n|3 of 6\n|Arts and Letters; Contemporary Affairs; History and biography\n|-\n|1980\n|16 of 30+\n|Autobiography; Biography; Current Interest; General Nonfiction; History; Religion/Inspiration; Science\n|-\n|1977–1979\n|3 of 7\n|Biography and Autobiography; Contemporary Thought; History\n|-\n|1981–1983\n|8 of 20+\n|Autobiography/Biography; General Nonfiction; History; Science (each hardcover and paperback)\n|}\nRecipients\n1935–1940\nThe National Book Awards for 1935 to 1940 annually recognized the \"most distinguished\" or \"favorite\" book of General Nonfiction or simply Nonfiction. In 1935 and 1936 there was distinct award to the most distinguished Biography; both winners were autobiographies. Meanwhile, four of the six general nonfiction winners were autobiographical and one more was a biography. Furthermore, all books were eligible for the \"Bookseller Discovery\" and \"Most Original Book\" (two awards); nonfiction winners are listed here. In 1937 and 1939 alone, the New York Times reported close seconds and runners up respectively.\nThere was only one National Book Award for 1941, the Bookseller Discovery, which recognized a novel; then none until their 1950 revival for 1949 books in three categories including general Nonfiction.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+National Book Awards presented to nonfiction books, 1935–1940\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30%\" | Author\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30%\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" |\n|-style=background:LemonChiffon; color:black\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1935\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Nonfiction\n|Anne Morrow Lindbergh\n|North to the Orient\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|Vincent Sheean\n|Personal History\n|Finalist\n|\n|-style=background:LemonChiffon; color:black\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1936\n!Most Original Book\n|Della T.

NYT lists four \"close seconds\" in order Conrad Richter, Sea of Grass; Kenneth Roberts, Northwest Passage; Lin Yutang, The Importance of Living; [Leo Rosten], The Education of Hyman Kaplan. Meanwhile, the four winners are identified by award category and listed in order Fiction, Nonfiction, Bookseller Discovery, Most Original. Both Sea of Grass and Northwest Passage are historical novels, which does not fit the second-listed category Nonfiction. The Importance of Living is nonfiction and also consistent with the third-listed winner, Bookseller Discovery. Hyman Kaplan is fiction and also consistent with the fourth-listed winner, Most Original.\n|Finalist\n|\n|-style=background:LemonChiffon; color:black\n! rowspan=\"3\" |1938\n!Bookseller Discovery\n|David Fairchild\n|The World Was My Garden: Travels of a Plant Explorer\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n!Most Original Book\n|Margaret Halsey\n|With Malice Toward Some\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n!Nonfiction\n|Anne Morrow Lindbergh\n|Listen!

Their salvation with a reduced program to be determined was announced in November. The revamp was completed only next summer, with an autumn program recognizing books published during the award year (initially, preceding November to current October). There were no awards for books published in 1983 before November.\n1984 entries for the \"revamped\" awards in merely three categories were published November 1983 to October 1984; that is, approximately during the award year. Eleven finalists were announced October 17.
