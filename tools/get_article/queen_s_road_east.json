Hopewell Centre is visible in the distance.]]\n'''Queen's Road East''' () is a street in Wan Chai, in the north of Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong, connecting Admiralty in the west to Happy Valley in the east. Queen's Road East is one of the four sections of Queen's Road, and historically included Queensway.\nLocation\nQueen's Road East forks to the south from Queensway near Justice Drive, where Queensway turns into Hennessy Road. It runs along the old northern shoreline of Hong Kong Island. It ends in the east at Wong Nai Chung Road in Happy Valley.\nHistory\nThe settlement of Wan Chai began in pre-British times as a small Chinese community around the present Hung Shing Temple on Queen's Road East. The temple was probably built in 1847 and may have existed previously as a shrine. Originally built next to the shoreline, facing the sea, it is now surrounded by clusters of residential and commercial buildings, as the consequence of successive land reclamation.\nQueen's Road East was first developed into a European commercial and residential centre after the arrival of the British in 1841. It had become a mainly Chinese residential, labouring and shop-keeping community by the 1860s.\nThe eastern part of the road was cut through Morrison Hill, which formerly separated Wanchai from Happy Valley. This section was known as 'Gap Road'. That name was still in use around 1930, even though the high land to the north of the 'gap' was levelled in the 1920s and the materials used to reclaim land from the harbour, under the Praya East Reclamation Scheme.\nAlthough associated with Queen's Road Central and Queen's Road West, the name 'Queen's Road East' has been in use since at least the 1870s.\nNorth side features\nThe following list follows a west-east order along the north side of the street, including intersecting streets, buildings and other features.\nMost streets and lanes having a northern junction with Queen's Road East connect with Johnston Road, located northward. The exceptions are Anton Street, McGregor Street and Wood Road. Since Queen's Road East runs mostly along the original shoreline of Hong Kong Island, these streets have been built on early land reclamation.\nQueensway – Hennessy Road interection\nThe western end of Queens Road East originates and runs southeast from the main Queensway – Hennessy Road  artery at the point where the name changes from Queensway (to the west) to Hennsessy Road to the east.\nGenerali Tower\nGenerali Tower  is an 18-storey office building.\nIt is the first building on the northern side of the street, at nos. 6–10.\nIt was formerly Sincere Insurance Building (\nThe building was completed on 1 January 1968, with a major renovation in 2011–13, after which it was called the Generali Building.\nThe west wall is used for advertising.\nTesbury Centre\nThe Tesbury Centre  is at nos. 24–32.\nThe Tesbury Centre, a 29-storey office building, was developed in 1993 at 28 Queen's Road East.\nAnton Street\nAnton Street () is a short street connecting Queen's Road East to Queensway.\nThe street is on land that Jardine, Matheson & Co. bought from the Sisters of St Paul in 1915.\nThe 1917 annual report of the Public Works Department stated that 47 Chinese houses had been completed on M.L. 23, Praya East, Queen’s Road East, Landale and Anton Streets.\nAnton Street was named after Charles Edward Anton, a Scottish businessman who served as the 16th Director (tai-pan) of Jardine, Matheson & Co.\nSix Pacific Place\nSix Pacific Place () is located at the junction of Anton street and Queen's Road East, the sixth phase of Pacific Place.
