King, was a British poet, writer and academic.\nLife\nKing was educated at the University of Cambridge, England, and Lund University, Sweden, and held a Doctor of Literature in stylistics.  He served as Assistant Director-General in charge of Education in England. Beginning in 1943, he was an official in the British Council, serving in Europe, Persia, and Pakistan.\nIn 1966, after his first wife died, King married his second cousin, Patricia, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He later also converted to the faith. Moving to the United States, King taught English at Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah, for several years from 1971 and served as an associate director of the university's Honors Program.\nKing had an international reputation as a poet, author and lecturer.
