      "text": "# King of Bands__disambig_1\n\nKing of Bands is a compilation album by American hardcore punk band Gang Green, released in 1991.\nIt was released in December, 1991 on Roadrunner Records and contained two newly recorded tracks from two-fifths of the line up who had appeared on the previous album.\nJosh Pappe had got married and was replaced by Kevin Brooks on bass. Fritz Ericson had retired and was replaced by Mike Lucantonio on guitar. Brian Betzger left to start a pool hall and was replaced in a touring capacity by Walter Gustafson – the drummer in the band who left in 1984. Gustafson left before this album and was replaced once again, by Brian Betzger.\nThe material is evenly gleaned from previous albums: three tracks from Another Wasted Night, two from You Got It, two from the EP I81B4U, and three from their last studio album, Older... Budweiser.\nThe album's opening and closing tracks were newly recorded by the new line-up in September, 1991. These two songs were the last new songs to be created by Doherty and Co until 1997, when an EP, Back & Gacked was swiftly followed by a new album, Another Case Of Brewtality and a re-issue of their pre-Another Wasted Night material, Preschool – all on their original independent label, Taang.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Chris Doherty, except where noted.\n#\"Thunder\" – 3:05\n#\"Alcohol\" (Chuck Stilphen, Doherty) – 2:06\n#\"We'll Give It To You\" – 3:13\n#\"Bartender\" (Joe Gittleman, Doherty) – 3:18\n#\"Ballad\" (Fritz Ericson, Doherty) – 2:30\n#\"Fuck In A\" – 0:52\n#\"Just One Bullet\" (Doherty, Betzger) – 3:06\n#\"Another Wasted Night\" – 2:28\n#\"Another Bomb\" – 2:28\n#\"Put Her On Top\" – 3:43\n#\"Church Of Fun\" (Doherty, Betzger) – 3:12\n#\"Rub It In Your Face\" – 3:34\nPersonnel\n* Chris Doherty – vocals, guitar – all tracks\n* Chuck Stilphen – guitar – tracks 2, 6, and 8\n* Fritz Ericson – guitar – tracks 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11\n* Mike Lucantonio – guitar – tracks 1 and 12\n* Glen Stilphen – bass – tracks 2, 6, and 8\n* Joe Gittleman – bass – tracks 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11\n* Kevin Brooks – bass – tracks 1 and 12\n* Brian Betzger – drums – all tracks\n* Recorded 1985 – September, 1991\n* Produced by\n** Ross Humphrey – tracks 1, 6, and 12\n** Alec Peters – tracks 2 and 8\n** Thom Moore – tracks 3 and 9\n** Daniel Rey – tracks 4 and 10\n** Tom Soares – tracks 5, 7, and 11\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060822030458/http://www.taang.com/bands_ganggreen_body.html Taang Records band page]\n*[http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=gang_green Trouserpress entry for Gang Green]\n*[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/usa/ganggreen_main.html More info on Gang Green]"
