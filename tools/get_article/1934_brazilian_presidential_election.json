Unlike previous elections which had been public (with the exception of the 1891 presidential election), this election was carried out by the Constituent Assembly. The result was a predictable victory for Getúlio Vargas, who received 175 of the 248 votes. The next elections did not take place until 1945, due to the Estado Novo dictatorship period.\nResults\n|votes4=2\n|cand5=|votes5=1\n|cand6=Artur Bernardes|votes6=1\n|cand7=Plínio Salgado|votes7=1\n|cand8=|votes8=1\n|cand9=|votes9=1\n|cand10=|votes10=1\n|cand11=Paim Filho|votes11=1\n|cand12=Levi Carneiro|votes12=1\n}}\nReferences"
