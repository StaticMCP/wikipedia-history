      "text": "# Culture of Oregon\n\nThe culture of Oregon has had a diverse and distinct character from before European settlement until the modern day. Some 80 Native American tribes were living in Oregon before the establishment of European American settlements and ultimately a widespread displacement of the local indigenous tribes. Trappers and traders were the harbingers of the coming migration of Europeans. Many of these settlers traveled along the nationally renowned Oregon Trail, with estimates of around 53,000 using the trail between 1840 and 1850. Much has been written about Oregon's founding as a \"racist white utopia,\" as many original laws were passed to keep Black Americans out of the state. Indeed, in 2019 the population was still 87% white and 2% Black.\nWorld War I stimulated the shipyards and timber trades in Oregon, especially Portland, which is still an integral part of the Northwest economy. In the 1930s, New Deal programs such as the Works Projects Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps built many projects around the state, including Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood. Hydroelectric dams and roads were also built at this time, improving the quality of life of many Oregonians. This encouraged settlement, and irrigation water from the Columbia River aided agricultural development. The Bonneville Dam was a plentiful and cheap source of power, which stimulated the development of industries such as aluminum plants during World War II. Food production, shipbuilding and the lumber were also greatly enhanced by the needs of the nation during World War II.\nIn recent years, electronics and tourism have broadened its economic base. Tourism is now the state's third largest source of revenue, after lumber and agriculture. In agriculture, Oregon is one of the top producers in such crops as greenhouse and nursery products, Christmas trees, grass seed, peppermint, blackberries and filberts. Other crops produced in Oregon are wheat, potatoes, pears, onions, snap beans and sweet corn. The products of Oregon wineries are nationally known, especially the chardonnay and pinot noir from Yamhill and Washington counties. The diversity of berries produced there (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and many other varieties of cane berries) make summer an eagerly awaited season in Oregon.\nToday, there are statewide groups, such as the Oregon Cultural Trust, that raise new funds to invest in Oregon's arts, humanities and heritage. The annual Oregon State Fair is a major event which has been held since 1861. Farm, garden and floral competitions are held.\nNative American culture in Oregon\nOregon has a diverse Indigenous culture with approximately 80 Native American tribes living in Oregon before the establishment of European pioneer settlements. There are seven reservations in Oregon that belong to seven of the nine federally recognized Oregon tribes:\n*Burns Paiute Indian Colony, of the Burns Paiute Tribe: 13,738 acres (55.60&nbsp;km2) in Harney County\n*Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Reservation, of Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians is less than 10 acres (40,000 m2)\n*Coquille Reservation includes 5,400 acres (22&nbsp;km2) of land held in trust for the Coquille Tribe in and around Coos Bay, Oregon.\n*Grand Ronde Community, of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon: 11,040 acres (44.7&nbsp;km2), mostly in Yamhill County, with the rest in Polk County.\n*Siletz Reservation, of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz: 4,204 acres (17.01&nbsp;km2), 3,666 acres (14.84&nbsp;km2) of which is in Lincoln County.\n*Umatilla Reservation, of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation: 172,882 acres (699.63&nbsp;km2), mostly in Umatilla County, with the rest in Union County.\n*Warm Springs Reservation, of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs: 641,118 acres (2,594.51&nbsp;km2), mostly in Wasco County and Jefferson County, with parts in Clackamas, Marion, and Linn counties.\nArts\nMuseums\nThe Jordan Schnitzer Museum on the University of Oregon campus has been a part of Oregon's culture since it opened on June 10, 1933.

Another major art museum in Oregon is the Portland Art Museum (PAM).
