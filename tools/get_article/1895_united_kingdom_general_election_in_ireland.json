The divide between the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation and the pro-Parnellite Irish National League continued, and with only minor variation in seats.\nIn the overall election result, the Conservative–Liberal Unionist coalition beat the Liberal Party government led by the Earl of Rosebery. Lord Salisbury returned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, having previously served from 1885 to 1886, and again from 1886 to 1892.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party || rowspan=\"2\"|Leader || colspan=\"3\"|Seats || colspan=\"3\"|Votes\n|-\n!# of Seats || % of Seats || Seat Change || # of Votes || % of Votes || Vote Change\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish National Federation\n|Justin McCarthy\n|69\n|68.0\n|1\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish National League\n|John Redmond\n|12\n|10.7\n|2\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Unionist\n|Edward James Saunderson\n|18\n|17.4\n|1\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal Unionist\n|Joseph Chamberlain\n|4\n|3.9\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Nationalist\n|\n|0\n|0\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Liberal\n|\n|0\n|0\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"font-weight:bold; background:rgb(232,232,232);\"\n|colspan=3|Total\n|103\n|100%\n|\n|\n|100%\n|\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Source: B.M.
