A member of the Republican Party, Schwartz represents District 18A in south-central Minnesota, encompassing Nicollet County and parts of Blue Earth and Le Sueur Counties. She serves as the vice chair of the Higher Education Finance and Policy Committee for the 2025-2026 legislative session. She also works at a gas station her husband's family owns.\nEarly life, education and career\nErica Schwartz is Mexican-American. She grew up in southern California. When she was 15, she moved to Gaylord, Minnesota. She went to Sibley East High School, and experienced some culture shock in her first year, but became more comfortable in rural southern Minnesota with time. She was diagnosed with a brain tumor during her senior year of high school. After high school, she moved to Nicollet, Minnesota.\nWhen Schwartz was 25, her fiancé, Zack Smith, a recently returned Marine veteran, was killed in a car crash. She was pregnant at the time of his death and was a single mother until her marriage. She worked multiple jobs to support her child, including factory jobs at Taylor Corporation in North Mankato and  Schmidt’s Meat Market in Nicollet.\nShe received an associate degree from South Central College in 2019.\nMinnesota House of Representatives\nSchwartz ran in the 2024 Minnesota House of Representatives election, challenging incumbent Jeff Brand after winning the Republican primary unopposed. During the campaign, she was overheard at a fundraiser implying that Democrats were leading the country toward another Holocaust; she apologized for the comment. The district has a history of close elections and party changes, so the race drew significant funding for both candidates, including $1.25 million from outside organizations.\nOn November 5, 2025, Schwartz was the first announced Republican winner of the 134 House seats, flipping the seat by three percentage points. She was one of three Republicans to flip their seats from DFL control, ending the DFL trifecta of the previous legislature and tying the House. Her strongest margins were in Nicollet County’s rural townships and cities. In addition to winning in Kasota and her hometown of Nicollet, Schwartz pulled ahead of Brand with a significant boost from Mankato’s largest precinct in the district.\nSchwartz is the vice chair of the Higher Education Finance and Policy Committee in the 94th Minnesota Legislature and sits on the Taxes Committee and the Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee.\nAs a chief author, Schwartz has introduced legislation to designate St. Peter as the honorary capital of Minnesota, enhance penalties for motor vehicle theft, require record of domestic violence-related offense release decisions, move the agriculture department's principal offices to Blue Earth or Nicollet County, establish a Department of Direct Care and Treatment, and modify certain legal definitions related to protective orders. Additionally, she has secured $1.9 million for upgrades to the water treatment plant in Lafayette, advocated for funding North Mankato's indoor recreational facility, and supported financial assistance for children's museums in the Greater Minnesota.\nAs an author, Schwartz advocated the investigation of allegations of fraud in state programs and undisclosed legislative conflicts of interest by establishing a Commission on Governmental Efficiency and Ethics, increasing child tax credit, eliminating child credit marriage penalty and increasing credit phaseout, prohibiting the construction of schools near former landfills, providing funds for anti-human trafficking training, and establishing minimum sentences for malicious punishment of a child.\nPolitical positions\nSchwartz focused her campaign on local issues and economic concerns, avoiding national issues when possible. She said she ran for office after seeing Minnesotans' pain at the gas pump and grocery store while working at Nicollet Mart and vowed to fight for constituents' needs.\nShe supports lowering taxes on Social Security, saying, \"while some politicians see it fit to build a $730 million palace for politicians, I promise to be a strong voice for permanent tax relief at the Capitol, including the complete elimination of the tax on your hard-earned Social Security benefit.\"\nIn addition to her plans to lower taxes, Schwartz iterated her support for loosening state regulations on local schools, small businesses, and farmers.\nPersonal life\nSchwartz and her husband, Kevin, reside in Nicollet, Minnesota. They have three children from previous relationships. They manage Nicollet Mart, a gas station and convenience store.\nElectoral history\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://ericaformn.org/ Campaign website]"
