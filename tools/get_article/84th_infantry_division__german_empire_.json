The division was formed in November 1914 as the \"Division Posen 2\", part of the Posen Corps (Korps Posen), and became the 84th Infantry Division in June 1915.  It was initially formed from the garrison infantry regiments of Fortress Posen (Festung Posen).  The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nCombat chronicle\nDivision Posen 2 initially served on the Eastern Front, fighting in Poland, including at the 1914 Battle of Łódź, and then spent most of the period until mid-1915 fighting along the Rawka and Bzura Rivers. On June 2, 1915, it became the 84th Infantry Division.  It fought around Warsaw in July and August 1915 and then in the pursuit of retreating Russian forces.  From September 1915 to July 1916, it occupied the line along the Servech and Shchara Rivers.  From July 1916 to June 1917, it occupied the line along the Berezina, Olshanka and Krevljanka Rivers.  It remained there and along the Servech and Neman Rivers until the armistice on the Eastern Front.  At the end of December 1917, the division was sent to the Western Front.  It occupied the line by Verdun from January to May 1918 and then moved to the Somme region.  It remained in the line until the end of the war.  Allied intelligence rated the division as fourth class.\nOrder of battle on formation\nThe 84th Infantry Division was formed as a square division.
