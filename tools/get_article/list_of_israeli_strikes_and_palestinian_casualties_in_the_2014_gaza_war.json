The IDF calculates 2,127 killed claiming 55% were civilians and 45% militants. Israeli casualties consisted of 6 civilians (including 1 Thai national) and 66 soldiers, 5 of whom reportedly died from friendly fire. The Associated Press, examining 247 airstrikes that hit residential compounds, out of the some 5,000 Israeli bombing raids, determined that of the 844 killed, 60% or 508 were presumed civilian children (280, of whom 19 were babies and 108 preschoolers between the ages of 1 and 5), women and older men. 98 or 11% were confirmed or suspected Hamas militants. Israel's Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC) has alleged that Hamas uses children in their operations in the Gaza Strip, and that some militants killed in action were \"falsely reported\" as civilians or children.\nDay 1: Monday night–Tuesday 8 July 2014\nBy day's end Israel had struck 220 targets in Gaza and 24 people had died. 157 Gazan rockets were fired at Israel, with no casualties. A lull as Israel mulled the pros and cons of an invasion was broken when Mohammed Shaaban (24), senior commander of Hamas's military wing, was killed with two companions, Amjad Shabaan (30) and Khader al-Bashliqi (45), when his car was struck by an Israeli missile near Wehada Street in Gaza City.\n* In a strike on Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City, Ahmad Nael Mahdi (16) was killed, while two friends were wounded.\n* In a strike at al-Qarara, north of Khan Younis, Suleiman Salman Abu al-Sawaween (age unclear) was killed, and another man critically injured.\n* An airstrike targeted a tuk-tuk vehicle in the al-Shujaiyeh neighborhood in Gaza City, killing Ahmad Moussa Habib (16) and his cousin, Mohammad Habib (22).\n* An airstrike targeted a motorcycle near Abraj al-Sheikh Zayed, Jabalia, killing Fakhri Saleh Ajjouri (aka Saqie Ayesh al-Jaouri; believed to be around 22 years of age).\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Place\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|Target\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Description\n!Action\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|Origin of missile\n|-\n|8 July 2014, 15:00\n|Khan Younis\n|Odeh Ahmad Mohammad Kaware?\n|Hamas activist.\n|A missile launched by an IAF F-16 jet hit the al-Kaware (Kaware') family home. The target was a member of a family who was a Hamas activist. 8 people were killed, including 6 children. Another 28 people were wounded. It was the first of 59 incidents in which a family house was bombed. Initial accounts varied of the incident. The strike was preceded by a drone-fired warning flare, a \"Knock on the roof\" procedure, involving a small mortar shot or unarmed missile at the target. Relatives and neighbours gathered at the home to form a human shield, according to one source. Five families were evacuated after a warning missile was fired, but neighbours gathered on the roof to try and hinder the operation, In the past strikes were often aborted if civilians crowded rooftops. A third account indicated that neighbours had gathered after an initial strike to prevent a further one. The official assessment was that it was a \"tragic mistake\" based upon the belief that the home was empty. A B'tselem investigation determined that, the family was contacted by the Israeli military to leave the premises at 13:30, and they evacuated, gathering outside. At 14:50, a drone missile struck the solar water tank on the roof, and after several minutes, the family went back inside, four staying on the roof, while several were in a stairwell or courtyard when the 15:00 missile struck. After the incident, the IDF changed its initial explanation from targeting the homes of Hamas activists who carry out \"high-trajectory fire towards Israel\" to \"homes of senior activists that function as command and control headquarters\".\n*Siraj Iyad Abd al-Al (8), died later from injuries sustained)\n*Bassem Salim Kaware (10)\n*Hussein Yusef Kaware (13)\n*Muhammad Ali Kaware (13)\n*Abdallah Muhammad Kaware (12)\n*Qassem Kaware (12)\n*Amar Muhammad Judah (20)\n*Ibrahim Kaware (29)\n*Muhammad Ibrahim Kaware (50)\n|IAF\n|}\n* An airstrike destroyed a house in central Gaza, and Rashad Yassin (27), from the al-Nuseirat refugee camp, was later found dead under the rubble.\n* A missile strike on the Beit Hanoun home of Hamas military commander Raed al Atar killed al-Atar along with five other people.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Place\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|Target\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Description\n!Action\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|Origin of missile\n|-\n|8 July 2014, 23:40\n|Beit Hanoun\n|Abd al-Hafiz Hamad (30), believed to be responsible for attacks on Sderot.\n|Islamic Jihad\n|In a joint ISA-IDF operation, an airstrike hit a yard by Hafiz Hamad's home.(30), killing the target and five members of his family, and injuring two children.
