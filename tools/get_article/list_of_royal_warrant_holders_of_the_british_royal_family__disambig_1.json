A full list is available [https://www.royalwarrant.org/directory here].\nBritish royal warrants are currently granted by King Charles III to companies or tradespeople who supply goods and services. The warrant enables the supplier to advertise  that they supply to the royal family. The professions, employment agencies, party planners, the media, government departments, and \"places of refreshment or entertainment\" (such as pubs and theatres) do not qualify. The Merchandise Marks Act 1887 (50 & 51 Vict. c. 28) makes it illegal for companies to falsely claim that they have a royal warrant.\nFollowing the death of Elizabeth II and the accession of Charles III in 2022, their royal warrants became void but remained valid for up to two years. Applications for new warrants from the King and Queen opened in May 2024, taking effect in 2025.\nGrantors\n;Current\n* King Charles III (from 2024).\n** During his tenure as Prince of Wales, King Charles III granted 159 royal warrants, void but still usable for two years since his accession as king. In May 2024, King Charles III and Queen Camilla granted their first royal warrants of appointment of the new reign.\n* Queen Camilla (from 2024).\n* William, Prince of Wales (from 2026).\n* Catherine, Princess of Wales (from 2026).\n;Former\n* Queen Elizabeth II granted 686 royal warrants during her reign. Warrants that had not previously expired became void upon her death in September 2022. Warrant holders have two years to discontinue the use of her Royal Arms, but companies may apply for a warrant from King Charles III.\n* Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh granted 38 royal warrants. As in the case of his wife, these became void upon his death in April 2021, with holders having two years to discontinue the use of his royal arms.\n* King George VI\n* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother granted many royal warrants until her death in 2002.\n* King Edward VIII\n* King George V\n* Queen Mary\n* King Edward VII\n* Queen Alexandra\n* Queen Victoria\n* Prince Albert\n* King William IV\n* Queen Adelaide\n* King George IV\n* King George III\nFile:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (Tudor crown).svg|Royal Warrant by Appointment to HM The King\nFile:Coat of arms of the United Kingdom in Scotland.svg|Royal Warrant by Appointment to HM The King in Scotland\nFile: Coat of arms of Queen Camilla.svg|Royal Warrant by Appointment to HM The Queen (since 2024)\nCurrent warrants\nA downloadable list of current warrant holders and a searchable directory, kept up to date, are available from the Royal Warrant Holders Association.\nPartial table of warrants before the death of Elizabeth II\nSeveral companies that had held Royal Warrants were no longer included on the Royal Warrant of Appointment list after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!
