It participated fully in the megalithic culture of the Chalcolithic period.\nIn successive centuries it became dominant throughout western France, establishing a stable ethno-cultural border with the Danubian culture near the Rhine that remained stable for a whole millennium.\nThe Artenacian peoples are believed to be the ancestors of the historical Aquitani.\nGallery\nFile:Le grand bâtiment de l’enceinte artenacienne du Camp à Challignac.jpg|Remains of a large building at Challignac\nFile:Prospection aérienne Challignac Le Camp Vue d'ensemble de l'enceinte interne.png|Challignac settlement, central enclosure\nFile:Céramique provenant de l’enceinte artenacienne du Camp à Challignac.png\nSee also\n* Aquitani\n* Aquitanian language\n* Neolithic Europe\n* Proto-Basque\nNotes"
