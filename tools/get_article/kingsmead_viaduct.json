It carries the A10 over the River Lea, the New River and the Hertford East branch line.\nThe road was originally constructed as a trunk route by the Highways Agency as the second part of a two-phase improvement of the A10 between Ware and Cheshunt.  On 29 September 2006 the road was de-trunked, and the viaduct is now the responsibility of Hertfordshire County Council.\n]]\nMajor works\nThe expansion joints were replaced by the Highways Agency in July 2005.\nImprovements to the bridge parapets to bring them up to modern standards were carried out by Hertfordshire Council from July to September 2008.\nLocation\nThe bridge spans the Lea Valley, crossing the River Lea, the New River and the A119 road between the Rush Green Interchange near Hertford and the Westmill interchange (north-west of Ware).\nAlso running along the valley floor is the Hertford East Branch Line, which the viaduct crosses between Ware and the Hertford East terminus. The viaduct crosses the King's Meads Nature Reserve.\nReferences"
