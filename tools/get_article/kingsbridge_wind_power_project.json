Kingsbridge 1 Wind facility is located between Goderich and Kincardine, Ontario. The Kingsbridge 1 Wind facility is located on the southeast shore of Lake Huron in the township of Ashfield-Colborne-Wawanosh and consists of 22 1.8 MW Vestas V80 wind turbines with a capacity of 39.6 MW. Each tower is over 78 meters tall and weigh around 195 metric tonnes. The project consists of two phases and currently provides power to on average 12,500 homes.\nIn 2004, the first phase was awarded a generation contract by the Government of Ontario as part of its renewable energy RFP. Construction has since been completed and the project is fully operational.\nIn 2005, the second phase received a generation contract from the provincial government.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Production (MWh)\n|-\n!Year!!January!!February!!March!!April!!May!!June!!July!!August!!September!!October!!November!!December!!Total\n|-\n|2006 ||  ||  || 6,004 || 7,011 || 6,077 || 4,856 || 4,717 || 4,423 || 7,036 || 11,098 || 7,947 || 15,806 || 74,975\n|-\n|2007 || 13,365 || 14,892 || 13,290 || 10,904 || 6,811 || 5,240 || 4,305 || 4,603 || 8,019 || 11,193 || 12,454 || 13,365 || 90,184\n|-\n|2008 || 15,782 || 10,048 || 11,084 || 10,176 || 9,656 || 5,732 || 4,726 || 4,260 || 4,652 || 10,491 || 12,555 || 16,141 || 89,473\n|-\n|2009 || 11,119 || 10,943 || 10,317 || 12,645 || 9,209 || 2,984 || 2,928 || 5,956 || 4,899 || 10,166 || 9,018 || 12,364 || 80,486\n|-\n|2010 || 11,164 || 6,572 || 7,836 || 10,246 || 6,836 || 4,645 || 3,654 || 4,897 || 9,628 || 10,361 || 12,016 || 15,274 || 85,393\n|-\n|2011 || 8,975 || 12,026 || 9,155 || 10,862 || 7,435 || 5,546 || 3,229 || 2,633 || 6,041 || 8,789 || 14,781 || 11,697 || 80,168\n|-\n|2012 || 14,274 || 10,324 || 12,111 || 9,709 || 5,330 || 6,142 || 3,330 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 36,622\n|}\nSee also\n}}\n* List of wind farms in Canada.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.epcor.ca/ EPCOR], the developer.\n* [http://www.capitalpower.com/ Capital Power], the owner and operator.\n* [http://www.ontarioelectricityrfp.ca/RenewablesRFP/Index.aspx?id=15 Ontario Renewables RFP I].\n* [http://www.ontarioelectricityrfp.ca/RenewablesRFP/Index.aspx?id=28 Ontario Renewables RFP II].\n*[http://www.cns-snc.ca/OntarioElectricity \"Where is my Electricity Coming From at this Hour?
