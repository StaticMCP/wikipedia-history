Ninety students spoke English as an additional language at an early stage of development. The school had an above average proportion of students eligible for free school meals. The percentage of students identified with learning difficulties and/or disabilities was above the national average, while the number of students with a statement of special educational needs was in line with the national average.\nIn 2018, Ashcroft High School was named as one of the worst performing schools in the United Kingdom as one of the 346 facilities which fell below the Government's minimum standards for progression.\nIn September 2021 Ashcroft High School was renamed Queen Elizabeth School. This was to reflect the school gaining its highest ever exam results. The name change also honoured Queen Elizabeth II in the lead up to her Platinum Jubilee in 2022.\nThe school today\nQueen Elizabeth School is a foundation school administered by Luton Borough Council. The school serves the local areas of Crawley Green, parts of High Town and Wigmore. The school caters for students aged between 11 and 16.\nNotable former pupils\nWhilst the school was formerly known as Ashcroft High School:\n* Lewis Baker - professional footballer\n* Michael Cain - professional footballer\n* Neil Coyle - Labour and independent Member of Parliament for Bermondsey and Old Southwark\n* Matthew Harriott - professional footballer\n* Callum Reynolds - professional footballer\n* Colin Salmon - actor\n* Paul Young - singer and guitarist\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.qesluton.co.uk/index.asp School website]"
