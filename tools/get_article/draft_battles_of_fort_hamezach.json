The battle lasted for several days, beginning on 6 October 1973, resulting in the outpost being besieged, with the remaining Israeli defenders eventually surrendering and being taken prisoner. The fall of the outpost was widely publicized in Egyptian media and was etched into the Israeli and Egyptian public memory.\n| combatant2        =  Israel\n| commander1        = Salah Fadel\n| commander2        = Shlomo ArdinstDavid Turgeman\n| strength1         = Over 140 Commando Combatants\n| strength2         = 42 Soldiers\n| units2            = Nahal Paratrooper Battalion\"A\" Company of The 52nd Battalion of The 14th BrigadeYeshiva students\n| units1            = 43rd \"Thunder\" Paratrooper Battalion\n| casualties1       = Over 120 killed or wounded\n| casualties2       = 5 killed21 wounded\n| image             = File:Israeili Commander Surrendered to Egyptian Forces 1973.jpg\n| caption           = Surrender of the Hamezach Fort Soldiers to Egyptian forces\n| partof            = the Yom Kippur War\n}}\nBackground\nLocation\nMa'oz HaMezach was built on a man-made peninsula in the Gulf of Suez, directly facing Port Tewfik and the city of Suez. The outpost was surrounded on three sides by water, and its only land access was via \"Lexicon Road,\" a track that ran parallel to the canal. The area to the east consisted of marshland, limiting vehicular and foot access further.\nPrior Engagements\nDuring the War of Attrition (1967–1970), the outpost suffered heavy shelling. On 9 July 1969, an Egyptian commando force attacked a tank platoon stationed at the outpost, killing eight Israeli soldiers, wounding nine, and capturing one, who later died in captivity. In response, the IDF launched retaliatory operations, including the raid on Green Island and Operation Boxer.\nDeployment Before the War\nIn early October 1973, Ma'oz HaMezach was manned by a platoon from the Nahal Paratroopers, part of a regular army company under the command of Lieutenant Shlomo Ardinest. On the eve of the war, the outpost had 25 personnel, including soldiers from the 50th Battalion and two yeshiva students sent to assist with religious observances for Yom Kippur.\nAlthough activity across the canal increased in the weeks before the war, and high Egyptian military alert was observed, Israel did not fully mobilize. Reports of Egyptian exercises were interpreted as routine maneuvers.\nThe Battle\nInitial Attack\nAt the height of Yom Kippur in 1973 (10 Tishrei 5734), at approximately 13:40, an order was received at Hamezach outpost to assume a defensive posture in anticipation of an imminent attack. At 14:00, a formation of four Egyptian MiG-17 fighter jets flew at low altitude over the area and dropped bombs on 11 tanks from Company A of the 52nd Battalion, which were stationed at Fort \"Tzidar,\" located approximately 8 kilometers from Hamezach. The aerial strike caused only minor damage to the tanks.\nImmediately afterward, the Egyptian military launched a heavy artillery barrage that destroyed parts of the communication trenches and firing positions of the outpost, though it did not penetrate the reinforced bunkers. The bombardment lasted for approximately two hours, during which the outpost remained under sustained attack.\nHamezach outpost was under the responsibility of Brigade 14, Battalion 52, Company A. On the first day of the war, the company engaged in fierce combat against Egyptian anti-tank squads equipped with Sagger missiles and RPG-7 launchers, as well as heavy artillery and anti-tank fire from across the Suez Canal. Around 16:30, four damaged Israeli tanks arrived at the outpost, bringing wounded soldiers for treatment by the outpost physician, Dr. Nahum Verbin. With the addition of 17 armored corps personnel, the total manpower at the outpost rose to 42 soldiers.\nAt 17:30, the artillery fire subsided, and Egyptian Paratrooper Commando Battalion 43 began crossing the canal toward the outpost. Israeli Nahal infantry and armored troops opened fire on the crossing boats, successfully striking many of them. Despite the intense fire, some Egyptian forces managed to reach the eastern (Israeli-held) bank. After a short regrouping period, the Egyptians launched intermittent infantry assaults on the outpost that continued throughout the night. During these engagements, the outpost commander, Lieutenant David Turgeman, was seriously wounded. Later that evening, an Israeli tank company attempted to break through to the outpost while exchanging fire with enemy forces, but the effort failed.\nOn the morning of October 7, the Egyptian bombardment of the outpost resumed, with shells falling in the center of the compound. Egyptian commandos attempted to infiltrate the outpost. Hamezach requested armored and artillery support and reported the presence of enemy infantry inside the outpost—though this latter claim was later found to be incorrect. The request for immediate support was denied, but assurances were given that heavy reinforcements would arrive within a few hours.\nAt that time, three tank crews remained operational at the outpost, stationed in their vehicles and prepared to fire. That night, a large Egyptian assault increased the number of wounded at the outpost. A mission was launched involving one tank, which moved southward to an area of the outpost now held by Egyptian forces and attempted to fire upon them. The tank was set ablaze, and the crew bailed out but was struck by Egyptian fire. Three crew members were killed.\nThe siege of Hamezach continued into the following day. Egyptian forces maintained their attacks, including renewed attempts to breach the outpost. Israeli defenders repelled these efforts and continued to request evacuation and rescue over the communication network. Reports of neighboring outposts falling to Egyptian control, combined with relentless shelling and mounting casualties, intensified the atmosphere of despair at Hamezach. Observing enemy flags raised over nearby positions and hearing radio communications confirming the situation, the defenders realized that Hamezach was the last Bar-Lev Line outpost still under IDF control.\nNaval Rescue Attempt on October 11\nOn October 11, the IDF General Staff decided to attempt the evacuation of Israeli soldiers from the besieged Hamezach outpost by sea. The operation would be carried out by naval commandos from Unit 707, who were to be transported aboard Dabur-class patrol boats and rubber dinghies. This route was considered the only one with a reasonable chance of success at the time. The operation relied solely on Unit 707, as a ten-man team from Shayetet 13 was concurrently engaged in a raid on the harbor at Ghardaqa.\nA total of 18 Unit 707 commandos departed from Ras Sudar, transported in six rubber dinghies under the command of Major Dov Bar. They were accompanied by three Dabur patrol boats for navigation and support, commanded by Major Ami Ayalon. Southern Command informed Ze'ev Almog, then commander of the Red Sea Naval Zone, that once the force passed north of Ras Dheisa—located just north of Ras Sudar—operational control of the mission would transfer to the Southern Command’s forward command post (FOB).\nThe plan was for the dinghies, guided by the Daburim, to approach a designated landing zone approximately 800 meters from the besieged outpost. Five commandos would then swim ashore, scale the quay, and gather intelligence on enemy movements. Meanwhile, the FOB would establish communication with the defenders at the outpost via the codename “Masrek” and persuade them to leave their positions and rendezvous with the naval force sent to extract them. The defenders would be evacuated by rubber dinghies, which would approach the quay upon receiving the signal.\nSea conditions were calm and the moon was full. Near Ras Dheisa, one of the Daburim detected what was later determined to be a radar interference artifact, and approached to investigate. Meanwhile, the rubber dinghies continued advancing independently. Once out of radar range from the Daburim, Ami Ayalon instructed the dinghies to raise their radar reflectors to facilitate tracking. This action, however, exposed their position to the enemy. Egyptian radar-guided 130 mm coastal artillery, positioned on the western side of the bay, opened fire on the dinghies.\nThe shelling was highly effective and continued even after the radar reflectors were retracted. The barrage lasted between 20 and 30 minutes and was also directed toward the Daburim, which were positioned at the edge of the artillery’s effective range. At the onset of the bombardment, the force dispersed and attempted to move closer to the eastern shore to reduce the risk of casualties.\nAt 23:15, the Southern Command FOB, which had assumed operational control of the mission, ordered the force to abort the mission and return to base, assessing that the extraction could not be carried out under the circumstances.\nSurrender and Captivity\nAs the battle dragged on, the ammunition and medical supplies at the Hamezach outpost were gradually depleted. The condition of the Israeli defenders worsened, and the realization that the chances of being rescued were slim became increasingly apparent. Despite the chaos, the outpost commander, Lt. Shlomo Ardinst, continued to direct the fighting, while the outpost physician, Dr. Nahum Werbin, oversaw the bunker housing the wounded.\nOn October 12, a message was transmitted over the radio suggesting that a surrender might be considered if the outpost could no longer hold out.\nIn testimony given after the war, Dr. Werbin recounted that the idea of surrender began to take shape on the fourth day of the battle, following the failed attempt by the Israeli Navy to reach the outpost. The suggestion was transmitted to headquarters over the radio in the following terms: \"We would like you to explore the possibility of an orderly surrender.\" At that point, Commander Ardinst believed it was still too early to take such a step. He stated: \"A commander, as long as he believes he has a mission, even if he thinks the situation is desperate, must continue.\" A dispute arose between Ardinst and Dr. Werbin, centered on their professional roles—Ardinst as a military commander committed to continued resistance, and Werbin as a physician focused on preserving life.\nOn Friday, the day before the surrender, the outpost’s officers gathered in the bunker with the wounded. Commander Ardinst explained to the soldiers the possibility of surrender, to be carried out in an organized fashion under the auspices of the Red Cross. Dr. Werbin then addressed the soldiers, describing the dire condition of the wounded and the critical shortage of supplies. At the conclusion of this discussion, the soldiers unanimously agreed to surrender.\nOn the morning of October 13, the outpost received the official surrender protocol from headquarters. Lt. Shlomo Ardinst went from soldier to soldier, informing them of the decision. He later signed the surrender document in the presence of a Red Cross representative on the Egyptian side.\nPreparations for captivity were made at the outpost: classified documents and weapons were destroyed, and the remaining food and water were distributed among the soldiers. About an hour before they were to cross the Suez Canal into enemy territory, a message came over the radio. It was delivered in the name of Defense Minister Moshe Dayan and read: \"Change of orders. Surrendering is not required. You may still consider whether you want to hold on.\"\nBy midday Saturday, the outpost's soldiers crossed the canal and, in the presence of Red Cross representatives, formally surrendered to the Egyptian Army. Journalists captured the moment on camera, allowing families in Israel to identify their loved ones as prisoners of war. Thirty-seven Israeli soldiers from the outpost were taken captive by the Egyptians. The surrender was broadcast on international television networks. One of the most iconic images seared into the Israeli public's memory was that of soldier Hillel Onsdorfer, carrying the outpost’s Torah scroll as he marched into captivity.\nIn Egyptian public perception, the surrender of the Hamezach outpost—which was shown on Egyptian television—was regarded as a major milestone in Egypt’s success during the war. Mass celebrations erupted in the streets following the broadcast.\nAftermath and Legacy\nThe soldiers of Ma'oz HaMezach were taken prisoner and held in Egyptian captivity five weeks and were returned to Israel in a subsequent prisoner exchange. Some of the survivors, including Lieutenant Shlomo Ardinest, later played prominent roles in advocating for the recognition and welfare of prisoners of war.\nDuring the early days of the Yom kippur war, the Hamezach fort became a symbol of bravery in the Israeli public consciousness, as it was one of only two Bar Lev Line forts that did not fall. In 2023, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation \"Kan\" produced a war drama miniseries portraying the story of the outpost and its soldiers during the war.\nThe Israeli high command awarded Medals to several soldiers who fought at the Hamezach outpost,\nSergeant Moshe Dvora and Corporal Moshe Yitzhak Tuval, who were killed during the battle, were posthumously awarded the Chief of Staff's Medal for their actions.\nPrivate Revachil Peled, who had been sent to the outpost due to religious circumstances and lacked combat training, volunteered to assist in the fighting and was seriously wounded on the third day by an RPG was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service by the IDF.\nReferences\n:Category:Battles of the Yom Kippur War\n:Category:Yom Kippur War\n:Category:Battles involving Israel\n:Category:Battles\n:Category:Battles involving Egypt"
