The ROK Navy is the oldest service within the ROK Armed Forces. In 2015, the South Korean navy celebrated its 70th anniversary.\nSince the Korean War, the ROK Navy had concentrated its efforts on building naval forces against the North Korean navy, which has littoral naval capabilities. As South Korea's economy grew, the ROK Navy was able to locally build larger and better equipped fleets to deter aggression, to protect the sea lines of communication, and to support the nation's foreign policy. As part of its mission, the ROK Navy has engaged in several peacekeeping operations since the turn of the 21st century.\nThe ROK Navy aims to become a blue-water navy in the 2020s.[http://www.navy.mil.kr/about/oceannavy/oceannavy_5.jsp \"대양해군건설\"].

In the late 4th century during the Three Kingdoms Period, Goguryeo defeated Baekjae by operating amphibious forces of 40,000 men. In 732, the Balhae navy \"attacked the Shandong peninsula and destroyed the biggest seaport of the Tang Empire in the east – Dengzhou\". In the 9th century, Commissioner Chang Pogo of the Unified Silla established a maritime base called Cheonghaejin in an island to foster trading with China and Japan, and to eradicate pirates.\nIn 1380, the naval forces of the Goryeo Dynasty defeated 500 vessels of invading Japanese pirates by deploying shipboard guns, devised by Ch'oe Mu-sŏn, which is claimed to be the first use of shipboard guns in the naval history. In 1389 and 1419, the Korean naval force invaded Tsushima Island to suppress the Japanese pirate. In the early years of the Joseon Dynasty, the naval forces once reached its peak of 50,000 personnel due to the pirate issue.[http://www.navy.go.kr/pds/navyhistory/history_1.jsp \"역사속의 해군\"] .

In 1893, the Joseon court requested the British Consul-General to dispatch a naval officer for organizing a naval school in an attempt to modernize the navy. In September 1893, the navy school was established in Ganghwa Island. Lieutenant William H. Callwell, a retired British naval officer, and John W. Curtis of the Royal Marines, a gunnery instructor, served as instructors for 160 cadets and sailor recruits. However, the Royal Naval Academy was closed in November 1894, and the Joseon navy (i.e. Commander-in-Chief Three-Provincial Fleet) was brought to an end in 1895 due to the First Sino-Japanese War and the Gabo Reform. In 1900, the government of the Korean Empire purchased its first modern naval ship, KIS Yangmu (Hanja: 揚武), from Japan. She was originally a cargo ship called the Kachidatemaru. In 1900, the revenue cruiser, Gwangje (光濟) was delivered for the Korean maritime customs. She was built by Kawasaki Dockyard Company.
