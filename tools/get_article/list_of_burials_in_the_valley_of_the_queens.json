As the name implies, the \"Western Wadis\" are located west of the valleys of the Three Pits/Rope, and northwest of the main valley.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=8%| Number\n! Discovered\n! width=9%| Intended for\n! width=10%| Position\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Short summary\n|-style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n| WB-1\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1917 1917\n| Multi-burials\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| Multiple\n| First described by Howard Carter, this 18th Dynasty tomb consists of six shafts with multiple owners. Notable original owners include; Princess Tiaa (reburied), Prince Menkheperre, and Nebetnehat. The tomb is now closed to the public due to its remote \"dangerous\" point of entry.\n|-\n| Wadi 1-b\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1917 1917\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Wadi 1-b was first noted by Howard Carter during his survey of the Western Wadis in 1916–1917. It was later mapped and researched by Elizabeth Thomas in 1959–1960. During her visit, Thomas saw fragments of \"blue painted ware (pottery) typical of the reigns of Amenhotep III to Akhenaten\" scattered around the shaft. The additional discovery of Coptic ware in the tomb came as no surprise due to previously discovered Coptic dwelling remains in the area.\n|-style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n| Wadi A-1\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1916 1916\n| Hatshepsut\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| Queen\n| This hidden cliff tomb located  above the valley floor was originally for Queen Hatshepsut before she ascended to the throne. The tomb's intended owner was identified when Howard Carter examined a large quartzite sarcophagus (now in the Egyptian Museum) in the tomb sometime in 1916. Hatshepsut never used this tomb, and was later interred in KV20 (King's Valley). The tomb is now closed to the public due to its remote \"dangerous\" point of entry.\n|-style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n| Wadi A-2\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 Antiquity\n| Anonymous\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| Queen\n| Wadi A-2 is another \"well hidden\" cliff tomb located  above the valley floor. It was plundered in antiquity and was rediscovered by locals from the West Bank, who \"subsequently\" mentioned its location to Howard Carter (1916–1917). Émile Baraize excavated the tomb in 1921 and found a bit of gold leaf, the neck and stopper of a pottery jug, and fragments of a cosmetic jar's alabaster lid. These finds as well as a close proximity to Hatshepsut's tomb suggest that A-2 most likely belonged to an 18th Dynasty queen. The tomb is now closed to the public due to its remote \"dangerous\" point of entry.\n|-\n| Wadi A-3\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1960 1960\n| Anonymous\n|\n| This tomb has been dated to the 18th Dynasty due to its close proximity to Hatshepsut's cliff tomb (Wadi A-1). Wadi A-3 was not noted by Carter, and was later documented by Elizabeth Thomas by 1960. It's not certain whether the tomb was abandoned or whether the lower chamber is blocked by very hard debris. This open tomb is in danger of being reburied by debris falling from the cliff above and/or by flooding.\n|-\n| Wadi A-4\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1916 1916\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Wadi A-4 dates to the 18th Dynasty for the same given reason as A-3. Howard Carter first noted this tomb (1916–1917) who stated that it was probably \"open since early times\". This now remains debated as the tomb has never been fully excavated to see if it was unfinished or emptied at a later date. Wadi A-4 is also in danger of being reburied by debris falling from the cliff above and/or by flooding.\n|-\n| Wadi A-5\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 Antiquity\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Wadi A-5 dates to the 18th Dynasty for the same given reason as A-3. Howard Carter first noted this tomb (1916–1917) and speculated that it had been open since the Coptic period as he found pottery fragments that date to that time. The tomb's location was lost afterwards until 2021, when it was rediscovered, mapped, and cleared. It remains unknown if this tomb was unfinished or emptied at a later date.\n|-style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n| Wadi C-1\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 Antiquity\n| Neferure?\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| Princess\n| This cliff tomb is located  above the valley floor and was plundered in antiquity. The interior is described as \"plastered but not decorated\", and may have belonged to a princess. Howard Carter suggested Princess Neferure based on an \"account of a graffito of a Cartouche\" he had found. The tomb is now closed to the public due to its remote \"dangerous\" point of entry.\n|-\n| Wadi C-2\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 Antiquity\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Wadi C-2 was first noted by Howard Carter (1916–1917), who saw it was \"open and had been plundered\". The only feature of this tomb is a deep shaft that widens at the bottom. Every attempt to explore the bottom of the shaft has been unsuccessful due to the amount of debris that has accumulated inside.\n|-\n| Wadi C-3\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 Antiquity\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Wadi C-3 is exactly the same as C2 except for being \"shallow\" and \"open\" as opposed to \"deep\" and filled with debris. It was also plundered in antiquity as noted by Howard Carter.\n|-\n| Wadi C-4\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 2022\n| Thutmose II\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| King (Pharaoh)\n| Unnoticed until 2022, the tomb was likened by excavators to KV5 due to the extent of flood debris in the tomb. The tomb bears hallmarks of a king's burial, including blue-painted ceiling with yellow stars, the remains of an Amduat depicted on the walls and inscribed vessels bearing the king's name and Hatshesput's name as his great wife. In 2025, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the tomb to be that of Thutmose II.\n|-style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n| Wadi D-1\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1916 1916\n| Menhet, Menwi, & Merti\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| Concubines\n| Wadi D-1 is another \"well hidden\" cliff tomb located  above the valley floor. The tomb belonged to three foreign wives of Thutmes III whose names are Menhet, Menwi, and Merti. After their burial the tomb lay undisturbed until August 1916, when it was discovered by locals from the West Bank and robbed. Howard Carter was able to recover most of the loot which helped identify their original owners. This tomb is now closed to the public due to its remote \"dangerous\" point of entry.\n|-\n| Wadi D-2\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 Antiquity\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Howard Carter noted (1916-1917) that this tomb contained the graves of baboons and had already been plundered. The meaning or reason behind the baboon burials is unknown. One theory is that they may be associated with a private tomb. Wadi D-2 is now \"mostly blocked and badly eroded\", leaving its visitation status in question.\n|-\n| Wadi D-3\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0001 Antiquity\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Howard Carter noted (1916-1917) that this tomb contained the graves of baboons and had already been plundered.

Wadi D-3 is now \"mostly blocked and badly eroded\" leaving its visitation status in question.\n|-\n| Wadi D-4\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1988 1988\n| Anonymous\n|\n| Wadi D-4 was discovered and excavated by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1988. While the pit contained a \"Thutmoside Foundation deposit\", Chamber B is a subsidiary burial due to its \"careful cutting and size\". Various artifacts from the 18th Dynasty to the Roman Coptic period were discovered in both. In the time following its original purpose regular floods in the wadi deposited debris and objects from Wadi D-1 and other areas into Wadi D-4.\n|}\nSee also\n*List of burials in the Valley of the Kings\n*List of Theban tombs\n*Theban Mapping Project\nNotes\nReferences"
