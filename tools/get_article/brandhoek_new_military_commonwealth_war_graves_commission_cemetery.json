Designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield, the cemetery contains 558 burials, including 512 from the United Kingdom, 11 from Australia, 6 from Canada, and 1 from undivided India. Notably, it is the final resting place of Captain Dr. Noel Godfrey Chavasse, a double recipient of the Victoria Cross and the Military Cross, who died from wounds sustained during the battle.\nThe cemetery is situated approximately 6.5 km west of Ypres town centre, along Zevekotestraat, a road connecting Ypres to Poperinge. Visitors can access the site via the N308 road, turning onto Grote Branderstraat, then Zevekotestraat. The cemetery is located 300 meters along Zevekotestraat on the right-hand side of the road, beyond the N38 dual carriageway, which it is necessary to cross.\nAdjacent to the Brandhoek New Military Cemetery is the Brandhoek Military Cemetery, which contains 671 burials, including 602 from the United Kingdom, 4 from Australia, and 63 from Canada. This cemetery was established in May 1915 and closed in July 1917 when the New Military Cemetery was opened.\nBoth cemeteries are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, ensuring that the sacrifices of those who served are honored and remembered.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
