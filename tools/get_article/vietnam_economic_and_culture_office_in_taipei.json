Its counterpart body in Vietnam is the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Vietnam based in Hanoi.\nHistory\nThe Office was established in 1993.  This followed visits to Vietnam by the Sino-Vietnamese Industrial and Commercial Association (SVICA) and China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) in 1991, and there was also provision for a branch office being established in Kaohsiung.\nBefore 1975, South Vietnam recognised Taiwan as the Republic of China, and had an embassy in Taipei. Nguyễn Văn Kiểu, brother of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, served as minister counsellor at the embassy. He was later made ambassador. On 25 April 1975, only five days before the Fall of Saigon, Thieu flew to Taipei. In 1976, South Vietnam was reunified with the Communist-controlled North, which had maintained full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.\nSee also\n*Taiwan–Vietnam relations\n*List of diplomatic missions in Taiwan\n*List of diplomatic missions of Vietnam\nReferences"
