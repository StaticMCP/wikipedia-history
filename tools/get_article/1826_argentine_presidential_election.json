The elections were indirectly, with members of Congress forming an electoral college. Bernardino Rivadavia was the only candidate, and was elected with 35 votes in favor and three against. He was and sworn in the following day. His appointment, because a national constitution had not yet been sanctioned or approved, was questioned and viewed with suspicion by several provinces.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n*History of Argentina\n*United Provinces of South America\nNotes"
