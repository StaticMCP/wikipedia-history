It was played at Jack Nicklaus Golf Center in Mason, Ohio. The tournament was dropped when the LPGA Championship moved there in 1978. There was no tournament in 1975 due to conflict with the Ryder Cup.\nTournament highlights\n*1973: Jack Nicklaus shoots a third round 62 on his way to a six-shot victory over Lee Trevino in the inaugural version of the tournament. After the tournament was over, Nicklaus announced he would be giving all of his first place check, $25,000, to charity.\n*1974: Miller Barber notches a victory for the eighth consecutive year. His 72-hole total of 277 is good enough for a three shot win over George Johnson.\n*1976: Ben Crenshaw sinks a 14-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to beat Andy North by one shot.\n*1977: Mike Hill wins the last edition of the tournament by one shot over Tom Kite.\nWinners\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Year!!Winner!!Score!!To par!!Margin ofvictory!!Runner-up\n|-\n| 1977 ||  Mike Hill || align=center|269 || align=center|−11 || 1 stroke ||  Tom Kite\n|-\n| 1976 ||  Ben Crenshaw || align=center|271 || align=center|−9 || 1 stroke ||  Andy North\n|-\n| colspan=7 align=center|1975: No tournament\n|-\n| 1974 ||  Miller Barber || align=center|277 || align=center|−7 || 3 strokes ||  George Johnson\n|-\n| 1973 ||  Jack Nicklaus || align=center|271 || align=center|−13 || 6 strokes ||  Lee Trevino\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://66.128.148.121/cgi.pan$winners&Ohio_Kings_Island_Open&&pga?golfstats Results on golfstats.com]"
