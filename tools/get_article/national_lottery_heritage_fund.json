The current body was established as the \"Heritage Lottery Fund\" in 1994. It was re-branded as the National Lottery Heritage Fund in January 2019.\nActivities\nin Halifax, West Yorkshire|alt=]]\nThe fund's income comes from the National Lottery, which is managed by Allwyn Entertainment. Its objectives are \"to conserve the UK's diverse heritage, to encourage people to be involved in heritage and to widen access and learning\". As of 2019, it had awarded £7.9 billion to 43,000 projects.\nIn 2006, the National Lottery Heritage Fund launched the Parks for People program with the aim to revitalize historic parks and cemeteries. From 2006 to 2021, the Fund had granted £254 million to 135 projects.\nIn January 2019 it simplified its funding schemes under one banner – National Lottery Grants for Heritage – with awards from £3,000 to £5 million. Funding requests for projects over £5 million will be considered as part of two time-limited national competitions to be held in 2020–21 and 2022–23.\nIts funding routes include the Digital Skills for Heritage Fund, a £3.5m fund for grants to support digital volunteering in the heritage sector, launched in November 2021.\nStructure\nThe chair of the trustees is appointed by the Prime Minister; René Olivieri served as interim chair from January 2020 following  Sir Peter Luff's retirement at the end of 2019.
