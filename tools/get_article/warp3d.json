If the particular piece of software used the Warp3D API (enabled through a shared library), any current or newly developed hardware would be able to be used. Hyperion Entertainment developers created OpenGL subset called MiniGL sitting on top of Warp3D to ease porting of games such as Heretic II.\nAt time of its release, Warp3D provided significant speed increase over software rendering. Years later however, newer 3D APIs (e.g. TinyGL in MorphOS) offered better performance on the same hardware.\nIn 2014, it was announced that Warp3D was now jointly owned by British company A-EON Technology Ltd.  On April 1, 2015, A-EON Technology subsequently released Warp3D for RadeonHD (Southern Islands chipset).\nIn March 2016, A-EON Technology Ltd announced that they had developed the new Warp3D Nova featuring support for Shaders. Warp3D Nova was originally mentioned as planned complete rewrite and Shader-centric design in the AmigaOS 4.0 Feature List more than decade earlier. Development of the new release intentionally took some inspiration from this original Warp3D Nova plan. The pre-release version 1.15 was published on 1 May 2016 in the Enhancer Software package for AmigaOS 4. Apart from its name and being related to 3D graphics, Warp3D Nova has nothing in common with the original Warp3D.\nAlso in March 2016 A-EON Technology Ltd announced that Daniel Müßener / GoldenCode.eu had been hired to create an OpenGL ES 2 implementation on top of Warp3D Nova. The first public version 1.4 was released on 31 August 2016 as part of the Enhancer Software package version 1.1.\nRunning Requirements\nWarp3D requires the following in order to work properly\n* An AmigaOS compatible system with CyberGraphX or Picasso96, containing:\n** At least a 68040 processor with FPU for AmigaOS versions predating 4.0\n** A PowerPC CPU for AmigaOS 4.0+\n** Optionally PowerPC supported on WarpOS\n** Any of these graphics cards:\n*** CyberVision 3D\n*** CyberVision PPC\n*** BlizzardVision PPC\n*** Any 3Dfx Voodoo card\n*** ATI Radeon R100, R200\n*** ATI RadeonHD Southern Islands graphics cards\nIt also requires 3D hardware to be present, and will not run with graphics cards that are 2D only, or AGA, ECS or OCS.\nOther implementations\nAlain Thellier created open source clone called Wazp3D. MorphOS included a Warp3D implementation known as Goa3D Graphics Library developed by Nicolas Sallin.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
