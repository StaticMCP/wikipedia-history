The scope of this article is limited to the North Indian basin. During the season, systems will be designated as tropical depressions by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Since they run the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for the basin, they will assign names to tropical depressions which developed into tropical storms in the basin. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also monitors the basin, issuing unofficial bulletins for tropical cyclones which form in the basin for military interests.\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean&nbsp;— the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated ARB by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated BOB by the IMD. And, the depressions formed over the land, are abbreviated LAND by the Indian Meteorological Department.\nTimeline of events\nJanuary\nJanuary 1\n* The 2024 North Indian Ocean cyclone season officially begins.\n* No storms form in January.\nFebruary\n* No storms form in February.\nMarch\n* No storms form in March.\nApril\n* No storms form in April.\nMay\n*May 21, 05:30 IST - An upper air cyclonic circulation developed in lower tropospheric levels over the southwest Bay of Bengal (BOB) in the early morning\n*May 22, 05:30 IST - Under its influence, a low pressure area formed over southwest and adjoining westcentral BOB.\n*May 23, 08:30 IST - It lay as a well-marked low pressure area  over westcentral & adjoining south BOB.\n*May 24, 05:30 IST - It concentrated into a depression over central BOB.\n*May 25, 05:30 IST - It moved nearly northwards and intensified into a deep depression over the same region.\n*May 25, 17:30 IST - It intensified into a cyclonic storm REMAL over the north and adjoining eastcentral BOB.\n*May 26, 05:30 IST - Continuing to move nearly northwards it intensified further into a severe cyclonic storm over the North BOB.\n*May 26, 22:30 IST - May 27, 00:30 IST  - Moving in the same direction, it made landfall over Bangladesh and adjoining West Bengal coasts between Sagar Island and Khepupara close to southwest of Mongla with wind speed of 110 km/h and gusting to 135 km/h.\n*May 27, 05:30 IST - Continuing to move northwards, it weakened into a cyclonic storm over coastal Bangladesh and adjoining coastal West Bengal.\n* May 27, 14:30 IST - It gradually recurved northeastwards.\n* May 27, 20:30 IST - It weakened into a deep depression over central Bangladesh.\n*May 28, 05:30 IST - It weakened into a depression over northeast Bangladesh.\n*May 28, 17:30 IST - It weakened into a remnant low over Assam and dissipated.\nJune\n* No storms in June\nJuly\n* July 18, 08:30 IST - A low pressure area formed over central and adjoining north BOB.\n* July 18, 17:30 IST - It consolidated further into a well marked low pressure area over the same region.\n* July 19, 08:30 IST - It moved northwestwards and concentrated into a depression BOB 02 over northwest and westcentral BOB.\n* July 20, 05:30 IST - It moved west-northwestwards and was 40 km off the coast of Puri.\n* July 20, 17:30 IST - It weakened into a remnant low over the Odisha coast, near Chilika Lake and dissipated.\nAugust\n*August 02, 17:30 IST - A low-pressure area over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining Jharkhand concentrated into a depression LAND 01.\n*August 02, 23:30 IST - The depression moved west with a speed of 5 km/h and was 60 km south of Gaya.\n*August 03, 08:30 IST - Continuing to move west-northwestwards, it intensified further into a deep depression over southwest Bihar and northwest Jharkhand.\n*August 04, 08:30 IST - It moved in the same direction and lay centered over northeast Madhya Pradesh and south Uttar Pradesh.\n*August 05, 05:30 IST - It weakened back into a depression.\n*August 05, 08:30 IST - It lay centered over northeast Rajasthan, 100 km east of Ajmer.\n*August 05, 17:30 IST  - The system moved at a speed of 30 km/h and lay centered over northwest Rajasthan, 50 km south-southeast of Bikaner.\n*August 06, 08:30 IST - The system had weakened into a remnant low and dissipated.\n*August 16, 05:30 IST - A low pressure area formed over northwest B0B and adjoining areas of West Bengal and Bangladesh in the morning.\n*August 24 - It concentrated into a well-marked low pressure area over southeast Uttar Pradesh and northwest Madhya Pradesh.\n*August 25, 05:30 IST - Moving westwards, it intensified into a depression over northwest Madhya Pradesh.\n*August 25, 23:30 IST - It intensified further into a deep depression over east Rajasthan.\n*August 27 - 29 - This system moved westwards across Gujrat.\nMeanwhile, a low-pressure area had formed over central and adjoining north BOB.\n*August 30, 08:30 IST - The deep depression emerged over northeast Arabian Sea off Kachchh adjoining the Pakistan coast.
