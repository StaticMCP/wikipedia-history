Hosted by MTV VJs Downtown Julie Brown, Carolyne Heldman, Kevin Seal, Michael Tomioka, and Dweezil Zappa, the show honored the best music videos released from May 2, 1986, to May 1, 1987.\nNominations from among 644 submissions were announced in August. The MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, which recognizes the most outstanding video of a song taken from a movie soundtrack, was included for the first time. The Special Recognition award—given out every year since 1984—was presented for the last time, after which it was eliminated from the award lineup altogether. Peter Gabriel set a record for the most VMA nominations earned in a single year with twelve: he received ten nominations for \"Sledgehammer\" and two for \"Big Time\". This would go uncontested until the 2010 ceremony, when Lady Gaga received thirteen nominations. Other major nominees included Genesis, Paul Simon, Steve Winwood, U2, and Madonna. Genesis, Winwood, and U2 all received seven nominations each, for \"Land of Confusion\", \"Higher Love\", and \"With or Without You\" respectively. Simon and Madonna received six nominations apiece, split between \"The Boy in the Bubble\" and \"You Can Call Me Al\" for the former, and \"Papa Don't Preach\" and \"Open Your Heart\" for the latter.\nGabriel was the most-awarded artist at the show, winning a record ten awards, including Video of the Year and the Video Vanguard Award, with \"Sledgehammer\"—the most-nominated video of the night—which won nine of the ten awards it was in the running for; it is the most-awarded video in VMA history. He did not attend in person to collect any of his awards as he was on tour in Germany. The only other act to win multiple awards was the rock band Talking Heads, whose video for \"Wild Wild Life\" won Best Group Video and Best Video from a Film.\nBackground\nMTV announced in mid-June that the 1987 Video Music Awards would be held on September 11. The ceremony broadcast was preceded by a two-hour long Pre-Game Show segment, during which Penn & Teller highlighted the nominated videos.\nPerformances\nRun-D.M.C.'s performance at the show marked the first time that a rap act appeared on the MTV stage.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+List of musical performances in order of appearance\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n| Los Lobos\n| \"La Bamba\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Bryan Adams\n| \"Only the Strong Survive\"\"Victim of Love\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| The Bangles\n| \"Walk Like an Egyptian\"\"Walking Down Your Street\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Bon Jovi\n| \"Livin' on a Prayer\"}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Crowded House\n| \"Don't Dream It's Over\"\"Now We're Getting Somewhere\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Madonna\n| \"Causing a Commotion\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Whitesnake\n| \"Still of the Night\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Whitney Houston\n| \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\"}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| The Cars\n| \"You Are the Girl\"\"Double Trouble\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| David Bowie\n| \"Never Let Me Down\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Prince\n| \"Sign o' the Times\"\"Play in the Sunshine\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Whitney Houston\n| \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Cyndi Lauper\n| \"Change of Heart\"\"True Colors\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Run-D.M.C.
