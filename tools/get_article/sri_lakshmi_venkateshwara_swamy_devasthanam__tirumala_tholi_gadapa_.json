The temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara and serves as a prelude for pilgrims en route to Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. It is also known as Tirumala Tholi Gadapa (the first threshold to Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanam TTD). Famous for its religious harmony and cultural importance, the temple draws many pilgrims.\nHistory\nDevuni Kadapa Temple was constructed centuries ago, possibly during the Vijayanagara Empire. Mentioned in the Puranas as \"Kripavathi Kshetram,\" it is an example of Vijayanagara architecture. This temple marks the spiritual beginning of a devotee's journey to Tirumala, symbolizing the initiation of their relationship with Lord Venkateswara.\nReferences"
