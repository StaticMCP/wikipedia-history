The mill was working until the First World War and in 1924 was stripped of its machinery and house converted. The work was done by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights.\nDescription\nKing's Mead Mill is a four-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. It has a Kentish-style cap winded by a fantail. When working it had four shuttered sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft, driving three pairs of millstones. The current windshaft is a dummy, added when the mill was converted. The original windshaft is displayed at Polegate windmill.\nMillers\n*William Neve 1805 - 1839\n*Porter 1839 - 1860\n*Henry Harmer\n*1911-1914 freeman\n*Jenner - WWI\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.windmillworld.com/millid/2699.htm Windmill World] Page on Battle Windmill.\nFurther reading\n* [http://theweald.org/bk.asp?BookId=wind900&xid=A&xnm=1 Online version]"
