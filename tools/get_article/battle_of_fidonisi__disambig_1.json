It was a Russian victory.\nEvents\nOn 10 July, the Turkish fleet under Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) Hasan Pasha was seen to the NW by the Russian fleet, which had left Sevastopol under Rear-Admiral Count Voinovich (Voynovich), on 29 June, and had reached Tendra on 10 July. After three days of manoeuvering or lying becalmed in sight of one another, the fleets found themselves near the island of Fidonisi, about 100&nbsp;miles south of Kinburn.\nVoynovich formed a line on the port tack NE and then SE as the wind veered. The Turks bore up and attacked from windward just after 3 pm. The leading Russian ships, the frigates Berislav and Stryela, forced the leading Turks out of line, but were in danger of being cut off until the Russian second-in-command Fyodor Ushakov aboard Sv. Pavel closed the gap.\nHasan Pasha then attacked the leading Russian ships, while his Vice- and Rear-Admirals attacked Voynovich, but his ship damaged, Hasan himself had to leave the line and just before 5 pm the Turks withdrew.\nThe battle of Fidosini demonstrated Ushakov's high tactical abilities. The Ottoman fleet, using the advantage of speed, moved south. They had lost 1 xebec, which was sunk.\nBetween 15 and 17 July, the Russian and Turkish fleets manoeuvered to the west of the Crimea; on 18 July, the Turks had disappeared. They sailed back to Ochakov but made no attack.\nShips involved\nRussia (Count Voinovich)\n*Preobrazhenie Gospodne 66 (Преображение Господне 66)\n*Sv. Pavel 66 (Св. Павел 66)\n*Sv. Andrei 50\n*Sv.
