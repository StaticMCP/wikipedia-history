The train was embroidered by Lock's Embroiderers. Princess Anne was said to have designed many aspects of the dress herself. It was reported that Princess Anne took inspiration from court dresses worn during the Elizabethan era, and had a much simplistic design compared to prior more extravagant styles worn by other royals.\nThe dress was an embroidered \"Tudor-style\" wedding dress with a high collar and \"mediaeval\" trumpet sleeves, with white silk chiffon under sleeves edged with pearls and other jewels. Her veil was made of silk net embroidered with floral sprays, and her \"something borrowed\" was the Queen Mary Fringe tiara.\nCompared to previous royal wedding dresses, it was described as \"simplistic\" and was noted as being close to contemporary 1970s wedding fashions.\nSecond wedding\nFor her marriage to Timothy Laurence on 12 December 1992 at Crathie Kirk, Princess Anne wore a white jacket over a high-necked white midi dress.\nSee also\n* List of individual dresses\nReferences"
