Unlike the then existing Sea Gallantry Medal (SGM) (1854), the Albert Medal (AM) (1866) and the Edward Medal (EM) (1907) which each had two classes with restricted eligibility criteria, the EGM was a single class award with wide eligibility. It was instituted by King George V on 29 December 1922. In July 1937, recipients were granted the right to use the post-nominal letters \"EGM\". The EGM was superseded in 1940 by the George Cross which was also a single class award with  wide eligibility but unlike the low placed EGM on the Order of Wear, the George Cross was listed immediately after the Victoria Cross.\nThe EGM was a medal of the Order of the British Empire and like the Order itself, was divided into civil and military divisions, but unlike the British Empire Medal (BEM), officers were eligible for the medal.\nHistory\nIn 1922, the original Medal of the Order of the British Empire was discontinued and replaced by two separate awards, the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry (EGM), and the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Meritorious Service, known as the British Empire Medal. The EGM had been ranked after the SGM, AM and EM on the Order of Wear but was superseded by the George Cross in 1940.\nOn 24 September 1940 King George VI created the George Cross, to rank immediately after the Victoria Cross, to recognize gallantry not in the presence of the enemy. The EGM ceased the same day. In April 1941, it was announced that, except for honorary recipients, all living recipients and the next-of-kin of those posthumously awarded the EGM after 3 September 1939, were to exchange their insignia for the George Cross. In 1971, all living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal were deemed George Cross holders but unlike EGM recipients the exchange of their original insignia for the George Cross was optional.\nAppearance\nIt is a circular silver medal,  in diameter, with a straight suspender augmented with laurel leaves. The recipient's name was impressed on the rim. Except for the ribbon, the design of the civil and military divisions was the same.\nThe obverse showed Britannia facing right, her left and resting on a shield and right hand holding a trident, with a sun in the upper right corner. The wording \"For God and the Empire\" was inscribed round the upper side, and \"For Gallantry\" in the exergue.\nThe first reverse had the Royal Cypher surrounded by six lions.\nThe 2nd type, adopted after the accession of George VI in 1937, had the Royal Cypher with four lions, two on either side with, below, the wording \"Instituted by George V\".\nThe original ribbon was plain purple, with the addition of a thin vertical red stripe for military awards. A silver laurel branch was added diagonally to the ribbon for both types of the award in 1933, and was worn on the ribbon bar when ribbons alone were worn. The ribbon changed to rose pink with pearl grey edges in July 1937, with an addition pearl grey vertical stripe for military awards, and stayed in this version until the medal's revocation.\nStatistics\nThere were a total of 130 awards, including eight made posthumously:\n* Civil Division\t64 (3 posthumous)\n* Military Division\t62 (5 posthumous)\n* Honorary awards 4 (non-British citizens, 3 French and 1 Belgian)\nThe four honorary awards were not able to be exchanged for the George Cross. On 24 September 1940, 107 of the other 126 recipients were living and all exchanged awards. The next of kin of five deceased recipients, Herbert John (Bertie) Mahoney whose EGM award was gazetted on 23 December 1927 and the four Military Division posthumous awards gazetted after the start of World War II also exchanged awards.\nSelected recipients\nAwards of the EGM that were not exchanged for the George Cross are marked below with (*).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Empire Gallantry Medal recipients\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name !! scope=\"col\" | Rank (or Role) !! scope=\"col\" | Organisation !! scope=\"col\" | Date gazetted !! scope=\"col\" | Image\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Flying Officer || Royal Air Force || 12 April 1929||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Leading Aircraftman || Royal Air Force || 9 November 1928||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Coxswain || Cromer Lifeboat || 30 June 1924||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Mulazim (Lieutenant) || Trans-Jordan Frontier Force || 30 June 1939||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |  (*)\n| Pilot Officer || Royal Air Force (Auxiliary Air Force)|| 30 June 1939||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Coxswain || Gorleston Lifeboat || 30 June 1924 ||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Landlord, Property Owner and Sand Contractor||  || 4 June 1934||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Sub Lieutenant || Royal Navy || 14 March 1940||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Commander || Royal Navy || 23 December 1939||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Barge pilot ||  || 5 February 1937 ||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Lance Sergeant || British Army || 19 November 1935||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Chauffeur ||  || 5 December 1924||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Flight Cadet || Royal Air Force || 18 October 1929||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Corporal || Royal Air Force ||  12 April 1929||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Corporal || Women's Auxiliary Air Force || 19 July 1940||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Captain || Aus-NZ Airmail Flight || 9 July 1937 ||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Nurse || Middlesex Hospital || 2 March 1934 ||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Radio Officer || Merchant Navy || 13 October 1939 ||\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222451/http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/egm.htm Information on the Empire Gallantry Medal]\n*"
