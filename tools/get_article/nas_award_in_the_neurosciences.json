Snyder (2013)\nFor the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of chemical signaling, including opiate receptors, NO signaling, and other neurotransmitter/receptor interactions.\n* Roger A. Nicoll (2010)\nFor his seminal discoveries elucidating cellular and molecular bases for synaptic plasticity in the brain.\n* Jean-Pierre Changeux (2007)\nFor the pioneering discovery that fast-acting neurotransmitters mediate their effects through allosteric regulation of the neurotransmitter protein.\n* Brenda Milner (2004)\nFor her pioneering and seminal investigations of the functioning of the temporal lobes and other brain regions in learning, memory, and speech.\n* Seymour Benzer (2001)\nFor his pioneering contributions which have brought neurogenetics to maturity. Benzer's discoveries in fruit flies have identified specific genes contributing to behaviors of central importance.\n* Vernon B. Mountcastle (1998)\nFor his discovery of the columnar organization of the mammalian cerebral cortex and for original studies relating behavior to function of single cells in higher cortical areas.\n* Walle J. H. Nauta (1994)\nFor development of a powerful method for determining connectivity among specific brain sites and thus establishing now-classical circuits in the limbic system.\n* Paul Greengard (1991)\nFor his discovery of the central role played by neuronal phosphoproteins in normal brain function as well as in neuropsychiatric and related disorders.\n* Seymour S. Kety and Louis Sokoloff (1988)\nFor developing techniques to measure brain blood flow and metabolism -- valuable tools in the study of brain function that have major applications in clinical medicine.\nSee also\n* List of neuroscience awards\nReferences"
