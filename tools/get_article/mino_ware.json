Some kiln traces and earthenware pieces, which are in the 7th-century style, have been recovered within the territory of the city. Craftsmen around the Seto area fled during wars before the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1614) and settled in the region. They were under the protection of the lords of Toki. The pottery was founded by Katō Yosabei, whose sons also started other potteries in the area. The technical merit and artistic impression reached new heights when crockery for tea ceremony had been produced there.\nUnder the guidance of lord Furuta Oribe, the Oribe ware developed as a variation of it. Daimyō feudal lords highly admired such tea vessels, bowls, pots and utensils with unique styles of oribe. More emphasis has been put on daily necessities since the early Edo period (1603–1867).\nCertain Mino kilns also produced Ofukei ware.\nWith the introduction of mass production introduced in the Meiji period (1868–1912), Mino ware became widely available. Ceramics from the Mino region amount to around 50% of Japanese pottery produced.\nStyles\nThroughout the centuries, four styles of Mino were developed that differ from each other in appearance. These have strong connections to tea ceremony:\n* Ki-Seto ware: style is yellow.\n* Setoguro ware: style is black.\n* Shino ware: style is often grey with autumn grasses in white as a prominent theme. This result is achieved by incising through a slip of iron oxide and covering with feldspar glaze. In the oven, the fire would bring out variations in colour through the uneven glaze. Sub-styles are Muji-Shino, E-Shino, Beni-Shino, Aka-Shino, and Nezumi-Shino.\n* Oribe ware: style is green and black. Sub-styles are Ao-Oribe, So-Oribe, Aka-Oribe, Narumi-Oribe, Shino-Oribe, and Kuro-Oribe.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
