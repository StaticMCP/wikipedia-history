When the war broke out in 1914 it was based in Łomża. In June 1917, it was designated as the 4th Infantry Shock Division (4-я пехотная ударная дивизия) upon being reformed as a shock troop unit and the following month it became known as the 4th Infantry Shock Division of Death (4-я пехотная ударная дивизия смерти).\nHistory\nThe division was formed in 1806. In 1916, during World War I, the 4th Infantry Division took part in the Brusilov Offensive and was later reorganized as a \"death\" shock troop unit by General Aleksei Brusilov. It was demobilized around the time of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent unrest.\nOrganization\nRussian infantry divisions consisted of a staff, two infantry brigades, and one artillery brigade. The 4th Infantry Division was part of the 6th Army Corps as of 1914.\n*1st Brigade\n** 13th General Field Marshal Count Lacy's Belozersk Infantry Regiment\n** 14th His Majesty the King of Serbia's Olonets Infantry Regiment\n*2nd Brigade\n** 15th General Field Marshal Prince Nikita Repnin's Schlüsselburg Infantry Regiment\n** 16th Ladoga Infantry Regiment\n*4th Artillery Brigade\nKnown commanders\n{| class=wikitable\n!  || Name || From || To\n|-\n|1|| Lieutenant General Vladislav Romishevsky || 14.07.1872 || 4.11.1883\n|-\n|2|| Lieutenant General Alexander Abramov (general) || 4.11.1883 || 1.04.1884\n|-\n|3|| Lieutenant General Alexander Bozheryanov || 1.01.1886 || ?\n|-\n|4|| Lieutenant General Mikhail Samokhvalov || 11.08.1891 || after 1.01.1893\n|-\n|5|| Lieutenant General Yakov Grebenshchikov || 21.02.1896 || 26.07.1899\n|-\n|6|| Lieutenant General Ivan Fullon || 5.08.1899 || 9.03.1900\n|-\n|7|| Lieutenant General Nikolai Shatilov || 24.11.1901 || 10.12.1902\n|-\n|8|| Lieutenant General Vladimir Bukholts || 10.12.1902 || 18.04.1903\n|-\n|9|| Lieutenant General Ippolit Voishin-Mudras-Zhilinsky || 6.04.1907 || 15.05.1912\n|-\n|10|| Lieutenant General Nikolai Komarov || 7.06.1912 || 1.04.1914\n|-\n|11|| Lieutenant General Gavril Mileant || 6.09.1914 || 29.09.1915\n|}\nKnown chiefs of staff\n{| class=wikitable\n!  || Name || From || To\n|-\n|1|| Colonel Vladimir Yurovsky || 27.09.1893 || 27.07.1894\n|-\n|2|| Colonel Semyon Fyodorov || 14.08.1894 || 27.08.1900\n|-\n|3|| Colonel Vladimir Burkovsky || 12.09.1902 || 14.12.1904\n|-\n|4|| Colonel Tokarev || 1.02.1913 || ?\n|-\n|5|| Colonel Serbinovich || 1.04.1914 || ?\n|-\n|6|| Colonel Vasily Markovsky || 6.01.1915 || after 1.01.1916\n|-\n|7|| Major General Alexander Treshchenkov || 27.04.1916 || 3.01.1917\n|}\nReferences"
