Established in 2007, it is the largest international awards program for indie authors and independent publishers and is presented by the Independent Book Publishing Professionals Group.\nHistory\nThe not-for-profit  awards program was founded in 2007  by Catherine Goulet and is presented by the Independent Book Publishing Professionals Group in cooperation with co-founder Marilyn Allen of Allen O’Shea Literary Agency. The judges are professionals from the book publishing industry, including literary agents, editors, publishing executives, book reviewers, writing teachers, and authors.\nCash prizes and medals are awarded to winners and finalists ranging from $100 to $1,500, grand prize winners are also awarded a trophy, and the top books in each category are reviewed by literary agents for possible representation. The Next Generation Indie Book Awards are announced each year during BookExpo America in a catalog distributed to BookExpo attendees. Winners and Finalists are honored at a reception during BookExpo America. The awards ceremonies are held at landmark locations in New York City including the Plaza Hotel and the Harvard Club of New York City. In 2016 the ceremony was held at the Newberry Library in Chicago.\nThe Next Generation Indie Book Awards program has been said to be the 'Sundance' of the book publishing world.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Next Generation Indie Book Awards winners\n!Year\n!Category\n!Author\n!Title\n!Result\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2008\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Fiction\n|\n|Zublinka Among Women\n|First place\n|-\n|\n|The Pale Surface of Things\n|Second place\n|-\n|\n|Moondance\n|Third place\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Nonfiction\n|\n|Lines of Velocity: Words that Move from WriteGirl\n|First place\n|-\n| and Monika Mitchell Ressler\n|Spiritual Capitalism: How 9/11 Gave us Nine Spiritual Lessons of Work and Business\n|Second place\n|-\n|\n|''Who's Behind the Fairy Doors?\n|Third place\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2009\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Fiction\n|\n|BUFFALOed\n|First place\n|-\n|\n|Hunter: A Novel\n|Second place\n|-\n|\n|The Misadventures of Oliver Booth: Life in the Lap of Luxury\n|Third place\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Nonfiction\n| and Cheryl Harris Sharman\n|Nightshift NYC\n|First place\n|-\n| and Heather Chase\n|Great Peacemakers\n|Second place\n|-\n|\n|Call Me Okaasan: Adventures in Multicultural Mothering\n|Third place\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2010\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Fiction\n|\n|The Hiding Place of Thunder\n|First place\n|-\n|\n|Shaken Allegiances\n|Second place\n|-\n|\n|The Bum Magnet\n|Third place\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Nonfiction\n|\n|American Idle: A Journey Through Our Sedentary Culture\n|First place\n|-\n| and Nicole Beinstein Strait\n|Phlogs: Journey to the Heart of the Human Predicament\n|Second place\n|-\n| and Tina Proctor\n|Ophelia's Oracle: Discovering the Healthy, Happy, Self-Aware, and Confident Girl in the Mirror\n|Third place\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2011\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Fiction\n|\n|Carny: A Novel in Stories\n|First place\n|-\n| and Patrick McMenamin\n|The DeValera Deception\n|Second place\n|-\n|\n|I Can Only Give You Everything\n|Third place\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Nonfiction\n|\n|Last Chance: Preserving Life on Earth\n|First place\n|-\n| and D.
