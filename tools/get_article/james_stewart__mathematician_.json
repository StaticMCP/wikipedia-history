Stewart is best known for his series of calculus textbooks used for high school, college, and university-level courses.\nCareer\nStewart received his Master of Science at Stanford University and his doctor of philosophy from the University of Toronto in 1967. He worked for two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of London, where his research focused on harmonic and functional analysis. His books are standard textbooks in universities in many countries. One of his best-known textbooks is Calculus: Early Transcendentals (1995), a set of textbooks which is accompanied by a [http://stewartcalculus.com website] for students.\nStewart was also a violinist and a former member of the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra.\nIntegral House\nFrom 2003 to 2009 a house designed by Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe was constructed for Stewart in the Rosedale neighbourhood of Toronto at a cost of $32 million. He paid an additional $5.4 million for the existing house and lot which was torn down to make room for his new home. Called Integral House (a reference to its curved walls, and their similarity to the mathematical integral symbol), the house includes a concert hall that seats 150. Stewart has said, \"My books and my house are my twin legacies. If I hadn't commissioned the house I'm not sure what I would have spent the money on.\" Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, called the house \"one of the most important private houses built in North America in a long time.\"\nPersonal life and political activism\nStewart was gay and involved in LGBT activism. According to Joseph Clement, a documentary filmmaker who is working on a film about Stewart and Integral House, Stewart brought gay rights activist George Hislop to speak at McMaster in the early 1970s, when the LGBT liberation movement was in its infancy, and was involved in protests and demonstrations.\nDeath\nIn the summer of 2013, Stewart was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. He died on December 3, 2014, aged 73.\nHonors\nIn 2015, he was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Cross.\nPublications\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*  Article about Stewart's \"Integral House\".\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.stewartcalculus.com/media/index_about.php Stewart Calculus] Official Biography\n*[https://www.thestar.com/news/article/933017--the-house-that-math-built The house that math built] by Katie Daubs at the Toronto Star\n*[http://www.integralmanfilm.com/ Integral Man] , a documentary about Stewart and Integral House"
