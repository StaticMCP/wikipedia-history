Bashar al-Assad labeled the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood as an extremist “terror” group. It joined the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council on 3 August 2014.\nIn March 2014, the Fatiheen Brigade, Eman Brigade and Sihem al-Haq Brigade, previously affiliated with the Shields, split from the group and joined the newly formed Sham Legion alliance.\nMember groups\n* Dera al-Jabal\nSee also\n*List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
