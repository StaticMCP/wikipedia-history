It was the second most disastrous passenger airline explosion up to that time. By the next day, experts found enough evidence to declare the explosion to have been caused by sabotage. Within days intelligence sources reported an anonymous telephone call to the United States embassy in Helsinki, Finland, on December 5, 1988, warned of possible sabotage on the flight.\nNewly elected President George H. W. Bush met with victims' families in April 1989. Relatives present asked for an independent investigation of airline security which, they claimed, should have prevented the disaster. Bush promised he would look into establishing just such a commission. Relatives also complained about the State Department's poor consular services for assisting victims' family members.  This news seemed to shock the President.\nU.S. government personnel were belatedly reported to be deeply involved in the investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was working closely with its European counterparts  The Department of Justice was conducting a criminal investigation, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was investigating its internal securities procedures.\nU.S. Congressional response to the disaster came when Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ)\nintroduced Senate Resolution S. Res. 86, calling on the President to appoint a special commission \"to investigate the events surrounding the destruction of Pan Am 103\" That same day, President Bush did so.\nOfficial name\n*\"President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism\"\nEnabling authorities\n* President George H.W.

Intelligence operations are low key in importance.\n*Technology research and development of counterterrorism devices lag behind terrorists' activities.\n*Neither the State Department nor the FAA have quick response programs to give aid and assistance to the victims and families of aviation terrorism.\nRecommendations\nThe Executive Order enabling the commission required its final report to be screened for classified information.
