Children from left to right: Quentin Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt Jr., Archibald Roosevelt, Alice Longworth, Kermit Roosevelt, and Ethel Roosevelt Derby]]\nThe following people are children of U.S. presidents, including biological children, confirmed and alleged extramarital children, adopted or abducted children, stepchildren, and legal wards. Status of paternity investigation/confirmation is included with entries for alleged extramarital children. All full names (including full married names) are given. Currently there are 33 confirmed, known living presidential children, of whom the oldest is Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and the youngest is Barron Trump. Two presidential children, John Quincy Adams and George W. Bush, have become president in their own right. John Scott Harrison is the only person to be both a child of a U.S. president and a parent of another U.S. president, being a son of William Henry Harrison and the father of Benjamin Harrison. Five presidents fathered no (known, biological) children: George Washington, James Madison, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and James Buchanan. Wives of two of these presidents, Martha Washington and Dolley Madison, had children from previous marriages; Rachel Jackson had no biological children from either of her marriages. At least six presidents have had alleged or confirmed extramarital children. Several presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, John Tyler, William Henry Harrison, and Andrew Johnson, have alleged or confirmed extramarital children with enslaved women or girls who could not legally consent to or reject sexual intercourse with their enslavers because they had no legal personhood and no recourse of any kind. During the Creek War, Andrew Jackson sent three Indigenous or mixed-race babies to the Hermitage. These children have been variously described as adopted or as spoils of war.\nPresidential children have been studied individually and as a class. As individuals they are more often notable in their own right than most individuals: They disproportionately circulate among political and social leaders and the wealthier classes, and they are more likely to be scrutinized as part of celebrity culture. Additionally, as individuals they frequently have significant influence on other family members. For instance, a child may have had a significant influence on the child's parent: acting as a sounding board, or having behavioral issues that affected the parent's beliefs or performance. A number of presidential sons and wards have served their fathers as Secretary to the President of the United States. Due to a combination of nepotism, generational wealth, and the spoils system, children of presidents have often received benefit from being born into an American political family, either by dint of government appointments or other advantage in running for office.\nAs a class, the children of presidents have also occasioned significant study. Study has generally followed two paths: The issue of what access and inclusion within the circles of power does to individuals' lives, aspirations, and outcomes; and the issue of their influence on society and politics.\n18th century\nGeorge and Martha Washington\n:No biological children together.

Abolitionist Joshua Leavitt reported the information about John Tyler and Charles Tyler. The claim that Tyler had fathered multiple children with slaves was largely ignored by 19th-century historians. In addition to the Dunjees, the Brown family of Charles City County claims descent from Tyler by an enslaved concubine. Biographer Edward P. Crapol states that Tyler's white descendants are skeptical of claims by the Browns. However, per Crapol, in light of the resolution of the Hemings–Jefferson controversy in favor of Hemings descendants, \"claims that John Tyler fathered children by his slaves must be taken seriously and examined thoroughly.\"''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Child\n!
