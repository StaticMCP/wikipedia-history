In both cases the ProgReS mayoral candidates took less than 1% of the vote. However, the results were welcomed by the party as encouraging, considering the lack of resources available, as well as the fact that the party was new and had yet to make a name for itself.[http://progeturepublica.net/comunicati/progres-sui-risultati-delle-elezioni-amministrative/ ProgReS sui risultati delle elezioni amministrative » ProgReS - Progetu Repùblica]\nAt the party's first congress in August 2011, Bussa was replaced as secretary by Salvatore Acampora, while Omar Onnis was elected president.[http://www.progeturepublica.net/comunicati/nasce-progres-progetu-republica-e-subito-guinness/ Nasce ProgReS Progetu Repùblica è subito guinness » ProgReS - Progetu Repùblica][http://www.regione.sardegna.it/index.php?xsl=492&s=172610&v=2&c=1489&t=1&aclang=it-it%2Cit%3Bq%3D0.8%2Cen-us%3Bq%3D0.5%2Cen%3Bq%3D0.3 Acampora nuovo leader di Progres-Regione Autonoma della Sardegna]\nIn July 2012 Demuru and Sedda left the party over disagreements with the new leadership and the rise of Michela Murgia, a well-known writer. A year later Sedda went on to launch with Paolo Maninchedda the Party of Sardinians (PdS), a splinter from the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az).\nAt the party's second congress in December 2012, members were presented with two options for the leadership: a slate led by Franco Contu and an alternative proposal whereby each coordinator of the nine regional constituencies would have taken the role of party leader for a limited period time, thus creating a rotational leadership. Contu won and was re-elected secretary. The congress also accepted a proposal to appoint two presidents, one male and one female: Sandro Ghiani and Federica Serra.\nIn August 2013 Murgia announced she would be the party's candidate for President of Sardinia in the 2014 regional election. In November 2013 at the party's national assembly, Paolo Piras, formerly responsible for communication in party leadership, was elected secretary to replace Contu, who resigned and moved to mainland Italy for work reasons. In the forthcoming election Murgia won 10.3% of the vote, but ProgReS, which suffered from competition with two coalition partners, won 2.8% and failed to pass the 5% threshold for parties. The other two ProgReS' emanations won 2.2% and 1.8% of the vote, respectively.\nIn May 2014 at the party's third congress, Gianluca Collu was elected secretary, while Carla Carcangiu and Sebastian Madau were elected presidents. At the party's fourth congress in May 2015, Collu, Carcangiu, and Madau were confirmed in their roles.\nIn the 2019 regional election the party formed a joint list with Unidos, a centre-right separatist party, and minor groups. Unidos' leader, Mauro Pili, ran as the list's candidate for president, winning 2.3% of the vote. The list obtained 2.1% and no seats on the Regional Council.\nIn December 2020, during the party's fifth congress, Luigi Todde was elected secretary and Adriano Sollai president. Sollai would soon replace Todde as secretary.\nIn July 2021, during the party's sixth congress, Sollai was re-elected secretary and Sarah Poddighe was appointed president. Also in 2021 the party entered into a federative pact named  (It's Time) with iRS and a brand new group named  (Again).\nIn the 2024 regional election formed a joint list with iRS and obtained 1.6% of the vote and no seats in the Regional Council. After the defeat, ProgRes paused its activities.\nOrganisation\nThe party is organised into territorial activity centers (; TzdA) and the Sardinian diaspora in Europe and in the world is represented by the TzdA . ProgReS is the second party after iRS to organise and involve the Sardinian diaspora in regional politics. All party activists are members of the party's highest decision-making assembly: the National Assembly of activists.\nElectoral results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! Election year\n! Votes\n! Vote %\n!
