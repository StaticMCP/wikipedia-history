Most well-known presidential memorials, such as the Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, have a physical element.\nThere are also official presidential memorials that have a living element with only a minor physical presence. An example of a presidential living memorial is the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Located in a wing of the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., the Wilson Center has a small exhibit concerning President Wilson's life and work, but it is best known for its work to unite the world of ideas with the world of policy by supporting scholarship linked to issues of contemporary importance.  In this way the living memorial perpetuates President Wilson's legacy of scholarship linked closely to international relations.\nSimilarly, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship honors U.S. college students dedicated to public service and policy leadership, and thus may be considered a memorial with solely a living element. The Truman Scholarship is the sole federal memorial allowed to honor President Truman.\nThis can also be accomplished through the establishment of a policy institute, like the Eisenhower Institute whose mandate is to advance Eisenhower's intellectual and leadership legacies through research, public education, and public policy recommendations.\nThe James Madison Memorial Building, the third and newest building of the Library of Congress, is an example of a memorial with both living and physical elements. The building houses a memorial hall to President James Madison, but is also dedicated in memory of his 1783 proposal that the Continental Congress form an official library.\nExisting presidential memorials\nMultiple statues, homes, and other physical memorials to some presidents exist; only large structures are mentioned below:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!\n!President\n!Memorial\n!Location\n|-\n| rowspan=7 | 1\n| rowspan=7 | George Washington\n| Washington Monument || Washington, D.C.\n|-\n| Washington Monument || Baltimore, Maryland\n|-\n| Washington Monument || Boonsboro, Maryland\n|-\n| George Washington Masonic National Memorial || Alexandria, Virginia\n|-\n| Ferry Farm || Stafford County, Virginia\n|-\n| Mount Vernon || Fairfax County, Virginia\n|-\n| Washington presidential library || Fairfax County, Virginia\n|-\n| rowspan=4 | 2\n| rowspan=4 | John Adams\n| Adams National Historical Park || Quincy, Massachusetts\n|-\n| Peacefield || Quincy, Massachusetts\n|-\n| John Adams Birthplace || Quincy, Massachusetts\n|-\n| John Adams Building || Washington, D.C.\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | 3\n| rowspan=3 | Thomas Jefferson\n| Jefferson Memorial || Washington, D.C.\n|-\n| Thomas Jefferson Building || Washington, D.C.\n|-\n| Monticello || Albemarle County, Virginia\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 4\n| rowspan=2 | James Madison\n| Montpelier || Orange County, Virginia\n|-\n| James Madison Memorial Building || Washington, D.C.\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 5\n| rowspan=2 | James Monroe\n| James Monroe Law Office || Fredericksburg, Virginia\n|-\n| Highland || Albemarle County, Virginia\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 6\n| rowspan=2 | John Quincy Adams\n| John Quincy Adams Birthplace || Quincy, Massachusetts\n|-\n| Peacefield || Quincy, Massachusetts\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | 7\n| rowspan=3 | Andrew Jackson\n|Andrew Jackson Statue || Washington, D.C.\n|-\n| The Hermitage || Nashville, Tennessee\n|-\n| Andrew Jackson State Park || Lancaster, South Carolina\n|-\n| rowspan=1 | 8\n| rowspan=1 | Martin Van Buren\n| Martin Van Buren National Historic Site || Kinderhook, New York\n|-\n| rowspan=1 | 9\n| rowspan=1 | William Henry Harrison\n| Grouseland || Vincennes, Indiana\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 11\n| rowspan=2 | James K.
