It was built about 1908 and was a 44 feet, 4 inches, long, one-story frame building in the Bungalow / American Craftsman style.  It had a large overhanging hipped roof with exposed rafter ends.  It was built by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and closed in the late 1940s.  It was demolished between 1995 and 2002.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. A transportation study considered the location for a new commuter rail station along SEPTA Regional Rail's Wilmington/Newark Line during the mid-1990s.\nReferences"
