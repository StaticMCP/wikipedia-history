Situated along the island's north shore, fronting the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the park measures approximately  in length and ranges from several hundred metres to several kilometres in width. Established in 1937, the park's mandate includes the protection of many broad sand beaches, sand dunes and both freshwater wetlands and saltmarshes. The park's protected beaches provide nesting habitat for the endangered piping plover; the park has been designated a Canadian Important Bird Area.\nAn extension was added to the park in 1998 when an extensive sand dune system in Greenwich was transferred from the provincial government to Parks Canada. The Prince Edward Island National Park also includes Green Gables, a 19th century farm that was the childhood inspiration for the Anne of Green Gables novels by author Lucy Maud Montgomery, as well as Dalvay-by-the-Sea, a Victorian era mansion currently operated as an inn.\nIn 1999, the Canadian Nature Federation identified Prince Edward Island National Park as being the most endangered in the national park system, based on human impact. The park also experiences severe coastal erosion as a result of winter storms and its vulnerable shoreline.\nThe park was the subject of a short film in 2011's National Parks Project, directed by John Walker and scored by Chad Ross, Sophie Trudeau and Dale Morningstar.  Part of the Jezero crater on Mars was informally named after the park.\nWildlife\nAnimals that inhabit this national park are coyotes, red foxes, raccoons, beavers, minks, and weasels. Numerous birds roam in this park including species of various herons, ducks, owls, cranes, plovers, grouses, jays, falcons, geese, hawks, sandpipers and eagles.\nGallery\nFile:Prince Edward Island Park.JPG|Red sand beach in PEI National Park\nFile:Lake of Shining Waters - Prince Edward Island National Park (22492133101).jpg|Lake of Shining Waters\nFile:Peicoast.jpg|Coast of Prince Edward Island\nFile:Piping plover.JPG|Restricted area for nesting piping plover\nFile:Prince Edward Island National Park 01.jpg|Prince Edward Island National Park on Cavendish Beach\nFile:Prince Edward Island National Park 02.jpg|Pedestrian walk\nFile:Prince Edward Island National Park 03.jpg|Grassland\nFile:Prince Edward Island National Park 09.jpg|Prince Edward Island National Park's coast\nFile:Prince Edward Island National Park 04.jpg|Orientation table\nFile:Dunes_on_PEI.jpg|Dunes at Cavendish Beach\nFile:Green Gables Heritage Place.jpg|Green Gables\nSee also\n* National parks of Canada\n* List of national parks of Canada\n* List of parks in Prince Edward Island\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/pe/pei-ipe/index Official site at Parks Canada]"
