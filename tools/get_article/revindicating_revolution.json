When Linares Alcántara died unexpectedly from a bronchial condition in November 1878, the Constituent Assembly elected Linares Alcántara supporter José Gregorio Valera as President of the Republic.\nActions\nwas appointed Vice President, a position he refused to accept, proclaiming on 29 December 1878 the autonomy of the Carabobo state and ignoring the Valera government. The rebels recognized former President General Antonio Guzmán Blanco, who was in exile in Paris, as their supreme leader.\nCedeño, head of the Revindicator troops, led the campaign during January 1879. José Gregorio Valera tried to quell the rebellion, but was defeated in the battle of La Victoria on 6 February 1879, in which a total of 2,000 soldiers were killed or wounded. On 13 February, the Revindicator Army entered Caracas and Guzmán Blanco returned to power.\nBibliography\n* Rondón Márquez, Rafael Ángel (1952). Guzmán Blanco, el autócrata civilizador.
