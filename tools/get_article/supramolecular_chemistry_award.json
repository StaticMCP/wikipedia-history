The first award was made in 2001 and the final award in 2020 following a review of the RSC Awards structure.  It was awarded biennially.\nIn 2022 the award was revived by the RSC Macrocyclic and Supramolecular Chemistry interest group as the MASC Supramolecular Chemistry Award sponsored by Chem from Cell Press and is awarded annually.\nRecipients\n*  |event= David Parker}}\n*  |event= David A.
