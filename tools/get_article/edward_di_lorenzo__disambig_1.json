Writing for the big screen, The Idolmaker (1980) has been his greatest commercial success so far, although some consider Lady Frankenstein (1971) an artistically greater achievement.\nDi Lorenzo contributed the scripts for \"Ring Around the Moon\", \"Missing Link\" and \"Alpha Child\" for Space: 1999 while also working as a script editor.  His philosophical input for the series was also distilled into a novel White Light (1974), described by Johnny Byrne as a post-hippie version of Jonathan Livingston Seagull.\nHe taught screenwriting at the University of Southern California.\nHe died in 2023.\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20010828174646/http://www.space1999.net/~catacombs/main/crguide/vcw.html#EdwardDiLorenzo Edward di Lorenzo biography at www.space1999.net]"
