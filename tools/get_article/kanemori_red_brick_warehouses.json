They are managed and operated by Kanemori Shosen Co., Ltd.\nHistory\nThe warehouses trace their origins to 1869, when Kumashiro Watanabe from Ōita Prefecture established the Kanemori Western Goods Store in Hakodate. In 1887, he began operating commercial warehouse services, becoming Hakodate's first commercial warehouse business.\nThe warehouses suffered significant damage in the Great Hakodate Fire of 1907, which destroyed six warehouse buildings. They were quickly rebuilt using fireproof materials and completed in 1909. Unlike the Kanemori Warehouses, the Hakodate Dock Red Brick Warehouses (built in 1901) survived this fire and remain among the oldest red brick warehouse structures in the area.\nPresent day\nSince 1988, the warehouses have been converted into a commercial complex featuring shopping malls, restaurants, and event spaces. The facilities include BAY Hakodate, Hakodate History Plaza, Kanemori Western Goods Hall, and Kanemori Hall. The complex attracts 1.5 to 2 million tourists annually and has become one of Hakodate's major tourist destinations.\nSee also\n* Hakodate Dock Red Brick Warehouses\n* Hakodate\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hakodate-kanemori.com/ Official website]"
