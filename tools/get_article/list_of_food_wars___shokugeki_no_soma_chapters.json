Soma improvizes a near-meat dish that overwhelms her in taste. Later, Joichiro closes the restaurant to go on a worldwide cooking tour, and has Soma enroll in Totsuki Saryo Culinary Institute, an elite cooking academy. Erina Nakiri, the valedictorian of Totsuki's junior high and a member of Totsuki's Council of Ten Masters, presides over the transfer student entrance exam and has candidates cook an egg dish that would satisfy her. While other candidates flee because of Erina's reputation of being the nation's top food critic, Soma cooks a furikake dish that Erina discovers she really enjoys. However, because Soma is a commoner, she fails him anyway. At the school's entrance ceremony, Soma appears as the sole transfer student representative and declares he will aspire to be the top student in his class, angering his classmates, and shocking Erina. In his first class, Soma is paired with Megumi Tadokoro, a shy girl who ranked at the bottom of her class and is on academic probation.

Takumi is forced to change his recipe, pulling out his family's reserve olive oil, however, Subaru has even anticipated that move and counters it with preserved lemon zest for the win. Afterwards, Subaru plans to challenge Soma into wagering his kitchen knife in the semifinals, but Soma increases the stakes by wagering quitting being a chef against Subaru's 100 trophy knives, with the dish theme being beef stew.

Mitsuru Sotsuda discovers that Subaru had hacked his computer to get his notes on Soma. However, Soma improvizes by bringing out a number of other meats and by preparing them in different ways. Subaru's dish impresses the judges, however, Soma's dish with the mix of meats is likened to enjoying a roller coaster at an amusement park, and the judges rule in favor of Soma.

Kojiro's chefs then create their own works which have a chance of being added to the menu. Soma serves a roasted quail poele dish that he considers a chicken and egg rice bowl. Although Kojiro considers Soma's dish to be low quality, he makes his version of it to add to the menu, implying that Soma has passed.
