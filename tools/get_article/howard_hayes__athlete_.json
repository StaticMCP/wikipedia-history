He also competed in intercollegiate track for the University of Michigan.\nIn 1923, Hayes was an unsuccessful Republican nominee for a seat on the Superior Court of Cook County. He finished twenty-first place in the election, and only the first twenty finishers were elected to the court.\nHayes competed in the 800 metres.  He placed third in his first-round (semifinals) heat and did not advance to the final.\nAfter his athletic career, he became a judge on the Municipal Court of Chicago, where he pursued a 1920 contempt of court proceeding against a man who telephoned him to ask to have a case decided in the man's favor, which he believed to be the first of its kind involving the technology of telephones (as opposed to, e.g., writing a letter or having a face-to-face conversation).\nHayes died in 1937, at the age of 59.  The cause of death was suicide.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* De Wael, Herman. ''Herman's Full Olympians'': \"Athletics 1900\".  Accessed 18 March 2006.
