It was opened in Hayward in 1895 by brothers William and Joseph Hunt, who were fruit packers originally from Sebastopol, California. The Hunts initially packed local fruit, including cherries, peaches, and apricots, then added tomatoes, which became the mainstay of their business. At its height in the 1960s and 1970s, Hunt's operated three canneries in Hayward, at A, B, and C Streets; an adjacent can-making company; a pickling factory; and a glass manufacturing plant. From the 1890s until its closure in 1981, Hunt's employed a large percentage of the local population. The air around Hayward was permeated by the smell of tomatoes for three months of each year, during the canning season. The canneries closed in 1981, as there were no longer enough produce fields or fruit orchards near the cannery to make it economically viable. Much of the production was moved to the Sacramento Valley. The location of the former canneries is marked by a historic water tower with the Hayward logo.  A housing development now occupies much of the former cannery site.\nOther former businesses\nMuch of the Bay coastal territory of Hayward was turned into salt ponds, with Oliver Salt and Leslie Salt operating there. Much of this land has in recent years been returned to salt marshes. A 1983 image of the ponds appears on a 2012 US postage stamp.\n*AirLink Communications, wireless service provider; operated in Hayward until its 2007 acquisition by Sierra Wireless\n*Ball Corporation, operated an aluminum can factory until 1998; formerly owned by Reynolds Metals\n*Banchero's, large Italian restaurant, operated from 1948 to 2012\n*Chaosium, role-playing game publisher, now based in Ann Arbor, Michigan\n*ComputerLand, former franchise computer retailer\n*Etec Systems, Inc., operated in Hayward from 1970 until 2005, when it was closed by its parent company\n* Everest College campus, closed by 2015, as part of the Corinthian Colleges collapse\n* Franklin Ophthalmic Instruments\n*Hayward Daily Review, formerly published by the Alameda Newspaper Group, now consolidated into the East Bay Tribune\n* Heald College campus, closed by 2015, as part of the Corinthian Colleges collapse\n*The Holiday Bowl bowling alley, operated in south Hayward for 47 years; closed in 2005\n*Kaiser Permanente, operated a Kaiser Permanente Medical Center; closed when the Medical Center in neighboring San Leandro was completed\n* Land and Liberty, anarchist periodical; published in Hayward from 1914 to 1915\n*Mack Truck Company, manufactured trucks through the 1970s\n*MDL Information Systems, founded in 1978; acquired by Symyx Technologies in 2007\n*Mervyns, department store chain; was headquartered in Hayward until declaring bankruptcy in 2008\n*Nellcor, founded in 1981, now a brand of pulse oximetry systems sold by Covidien\n*Osborne Computer Corporation, operated a manufacturing facility in the 1980s\n*Qume, daisy wheel printer manufacturer\n*Star Reach, comic book publisher from the 1970s; run by Mike Friedrich\n*TML Studios, recording studio owned by Tesla band member Troy Luccketta, where albums by Loudness were recorded\n*The Valle Vista roller skating rink, operated for 44 years in south Hayward; closed in 2003\nReferences\nSee also\n*List of companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area"
