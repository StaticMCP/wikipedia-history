It houses the largest university collection of ethnographic material culture in Australia.\nLocation\nThe Museum is located on level 1 of the Michie Building at the St Lucia campus of The University of Queensland\nHistory\nThe Museum was formed in 1948 by Dr Lindsey Winterbotham's donation of over 1,000 objects.  The initial focus of the Museum was on the material culture of Aboriginal Australia, but swiftly broadened to incorporate a diverse range of material from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and the broader Pacific region.  Early donors to the museum included missionaries, researchers and anthropologists such as Ursula McConnel and AP Lyons.\nUnder subsequent Directors (Dr Peter Lauer, Dr Leonn Satterthwait and Dr Diana Young), the Museum developed an active exhibition program and strengthened the Museum's involvement in community engagement, research and teaching.\nCollection\nThe Museum houses over 28,000 artefacts and over 8,000 photographs. The collection includes field collections and private donations and as a whole describes mid-late 20th century intercultural engagements in Queensland and the Pacific region.\nThe Museum holds a broad range of stone artefacts from across Australia.\nThe collection includes smaller collections from southern Africa and Southeast Asia, as well as a collection of colonial surveying equipment from William Landsborough and Augustus Gregory.\nPublications\nThe museum has published several series of academic monographs, namely the \"Cultural and Historical Records of Queensland\" and the \"Occasional Papers in Anthropology,' which changed its name to: \"TEMPUS: Archaeology and Material Culture Studies in Anthropology\".
