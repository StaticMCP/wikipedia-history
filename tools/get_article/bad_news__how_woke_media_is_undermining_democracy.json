The book contends that identity politics and cultural issues have become central to media coverage, which it describes as \"catering almost exclusively to the interests of urban, upper-class liberals\". The Washington Independent Review of Books described the book as \"the most penetrating analysis\" of the current state of mainstream media.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?516229-1/bad-news Discussion with Ungar-Sargon on Bad News, hosted by the American Enterprise Institute, October 18, 2021], C-SPAN\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?515525-5/batya-ungar-sargon-bad-news-woke-media-undermining-democracy Washington Journal interview with Ungar-Sargon on Bad News, October 24, 2021], C-SPAN"
