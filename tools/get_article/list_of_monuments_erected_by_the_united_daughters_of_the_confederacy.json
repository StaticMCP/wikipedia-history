Modest in prosperity, gentile in peace, brave in battle, and undespairing in defeat, they knew no law of life but loyalty and truth and civic faith, and to these virtues they consecrated their strength.\n(North Face): These men held that the states made the union, that the Constitution is the evidence of the covenant, that the people of the State are subject to no power except as they have agreed, that free convention binds the parties to it, that there is sanctity in oaths and obligations in contracts, and in defense of these principles they mutually pledged their live, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.\n(East Face) How well they kept the faith is faintly written in the records of the armies and the history of the times.

The Confederates were falling back General Barnard Bee's South Carolina Brigade was retreating. Jackson's Virginians were standing under fire. Bee in an effort to rally his own men called out: \"See! There stands Jackson like a stone wall.\" Henceforth his brigade was known as the \"Stonewall Brigade.\"\nPoem by John G. Gittings:\n\"Jackson stands there like a stone wall,\" he said\nAs he pointed his sword across the battle-field Brigade\nThus the name—none prouder on spotless shield\nThan 'Stonewall,' the sobriquet to valor paid.\"\n|-\n| Heyward Shepherd monument\n|\n| Harpers Ferry,Potomac Street\n| Peter-Burghard Stone Company, fabricator\n| Granite\n| October 12, 1931\n| \"ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 16, 1859,/HEYWARD SHEPHERD, AN INDUSTRIOUS/AND RESPECTED COLORED FREEMAN,/WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED BY JOHN/BROWN'S RAIDERS IN PURSUANCE/OF HIS DUTIES AS AN EMPLOYEE OF/THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD/COMPANY.
