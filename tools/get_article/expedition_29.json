The expedition formally began on 16 September 2011, with the departure from the ISS of the Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft. Astronauts Satoshi Furukawa, Michael Fossum and Sergey Volkov, who had arrived at the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-02M in June 2011, began their Expedition 29 service at this time.\nSoyuz TMA-22, which brought the remaining three Expedition 29 crew members to the ISS, was originally scheduled to launch in September 2011, but due to the launch failure of the Progress M-12M resupply vehicle on 24 August, its launch was delayed to 14 November. It docked successfully with the ISS on 16 November 2011.\nExpedition 29 officially ended with the undocking of Soyuz TMA-02M on 21 November 2011. Furukawa, Fossum, and Volkov returned to Earth aboard the spacecraft, while astronauts Dan Burbank, Anton Shkaplerov, and Anatoli Ivanishin remained on the ISS as part of Expedition 30.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!First part(September 2011 to November 2011)\n!Second part(November 2011)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=2 align=center| Mike Fossum, NASAThird and last spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 1\n|colspan=2 align=center| Satoshi Furukawa, JAXAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 2\n|colspan=2 align=center| Sergei Volkov, RSASecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 3\n|\n|colspan=1 align=center| Anton Shkaplerov, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 4\n|\n|colspan=1 align=center| Anatoli Ivanishin, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 5\n|\n|colspan=1 align=center| Daniel Burbank, NASAThird and last spaceflight\n|-\n|}\n;Source: NASA\nMission highlights\nSoyuz TMA-02M launch\nThe expedition's first three crew members launched aboard Soyuz TMA-02M from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, at 21:18&nbsp;UTC on 7 June 2011. The crew consisted of Sergey Volkov (Roscosmos), Satoshi Furukawa (JAXA), and Michael Fossum (NASA). Their backups were Oleg Kononenko (Roscosmos), Donald Pettit (NASA), and André Kuipers (ESA). Soyuz TMA-02M docked successfully to the ISS on 9 June 2011, at 5:19 pm EDT.\nSoyuz TMA-22 launch\nSoyuz TMA-22 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome at 04:14&nbsp;UTC on 14 November 2011, carrying Anton Shkaplerov and Anatoli Ivanishin (Roscosmos), and Daniel Burbank (NASA). The spacecraft was placed into a  parking orbit, and docked successfully with the ISS at 5:24 am GMT on 16 November 2011.\nDeparture of Soyuz TMA-02M\nExpedition 29 concluded with the departure of Soyuz TMA-02M from the ISS at 11:00 pm GMT on 21 November 2011, carrying astronauts Fossum, Volkov and Furukawa. The spacecraft soft-landed safely (albeit on its side) in Kazakhstan at 2:26 am GMT on 22 November.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html NASA's Space Station Expeditions page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110401000215/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-29/ndxpage1.html Expedition 29 Photography]"
