Since its inception, however, the award has commonly been referred to as the AFA for Best Supporting Actor. While actors are nominated for this award by Academy members who are actors and actresses themselves, winners are selected by the AFA membership as a whole.\nHistory\nThe Best Supporting Actress category has originated with the 1st ARY Film Awards ceremony circa 2014. The Best Supporting Actress is awarded by viewers voting and known as Best Supporting Actress Viewers Choice but officially it is termed as Best Supporting Actress.\nWinners and nominees\nFor the Best Supporting Actress winner, it is decided by viewers. It is simply regarded as Best Supporting Actress as compared to the other four Jury Awards which have the \"super-fix\" of Jury. As of the first ceremony, a total of five actresses were nominated. This category is among fourteen Viewers Awards in ARY Film Awards.\nNot unlike other award shows, the award ceremony is held for the films of its previous year.\n2010s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"| Actor\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"| Film\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"| Role\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2%;\"|Ref\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2013(1st)\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Misha Shafi\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Waar\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | Laxmi\n|rowspan=5|\n|-\n| Ainy Jaffri\n| Main Hoon Shahid Afridi\n| Alisha\n|-\n| Nyla Jafri\n|Josh\n| Nusrat Bee\n|-\n| Naghma Beghum\n| Zinda Bhaag\n|  Ammi Jee\n|-\n| Mahnoor Usman\n| Siyaah\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"col\" colspan=5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2015(2nd)\n| Ayesha Khan\n| Jawani Phir Nahi Ani\n| Kubra\n|rowspan=6|\n|-\n| Sarwat Gilani\n| Jawani Phir Nahi Ani\n| Gul\n|-\n| Saba Qamar\n| Manto\n| Noor Jehan\n|-\n| Sabeeka Imam\n| Jalaibee\n| Eman\n|-\n| Janita Asma\n| Wrong No.\n| Haya\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://aryfilmawards.com/ ARY Film Awards Official website]"
