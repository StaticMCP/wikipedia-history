She was also the monarch of other Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom. Her constitutional roles in Sierra Leone were mostly delegated to the governor-general of Sierra Leone.\nHistory\nSierra Leone became an independent realm by the Sierra Leone Independence Act 1961, which transformed the British Crown Colony of Sierra Leone into an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth II became the head of state and Queen of Sierra Leone, and was represented by the governor-general who resided at the State House.\nThe Duke of Kent represented the Queen at the independence celebrations. Princess Alexandra of Kent represented the Queen at a Thanksgiving Service held in London on Sierra Leone's Independence Day. At Freetown, the Duke of Kent opened the new Parliament Building on 26 April. Sierra Leone became independent at midnight of 26-27 April and later that day the Duke took part in the State opening of Parliament, where the Duke handed over the constitutional instruments to Sir Milton Margai, which made Sierra Leone an independent nation. Later Sir Maurice Dorman, the Governor, was sworn in as the Governor-General, the Queen's representative, by Chief Justice Beoku Betts.\nThe Queen sent a message to Sierra Leoneans, in which she said:\nConstitutional role\n]]\nSierra Leone was one of the realms of the Commonwealth of Nations that shared the same person as Sovereign and head of state.\nEffective with the Sierra Leone Independence Act 1961, no British government minister could advise the sovereign on any matters pertaining to Sierra Leone, meaning that on all matters of Sierra Leone, the monarch was advised solely by Sierra Leonean ministers of the Crown. All Sierra Leonean bills required Royal assent. The Sierra Leonean monarch was represented in the country by the Governor-General of Sierra Leone, who was appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Sierra Leonean Prime Minister.\nThe Crown and Government\nThe Sierra Leonean monarch and the Sierra Leonean House of Representatives constituted the Parliament of Sierra Leone. All executive powers of Sierra Leone rested with the sovereign. All laws in Sierra Leone were enacted only with the granting of royal assent, done by the Governor-General on behalf of the sovereign. The Governor-General was also responsible for summoning, proroguing, and dissolving Parliament. The Governor-General had the power to choose and appoint the Council of Ministers and could dismiss them under his discretion. All Sierra Leonean ministers of the Crown held office at the pleasure of the Governor-General.\nThe Crown and Foreign affairs\nSierra Leonean representatives to foreign countries were accredited by the monarch in her capacity as Queen of Sierra Leone and Sierra Leonean envoys sent abroad required royal approval. The letters of credence were formally issued in the name of the monarch.\nThe Crown and the Courts\nAll Sierra Leonean judges had to swear that they would \"well and truly serve\" the monarch of Sierra Leone and \"do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of Sierra Leone without fear or favour, affection or ill will\".\nThe highest court of appeal for Sierra Leone was the Judicial Committee of the Queen's Privy Council. The monarch, and by extension the governor-general, could also grant immunity from prosecution, exercise the royal prerogative of mercy, and pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial.\nRoyal style and titles\nThe Royal Style and Titles Act, 1961 of the Sierra Leonean Parliament granted the monarch separate style and titles in her role as Queen of Sierra Leone.\nElizabeth II had the following style and titles in her role as the monarch of Sierra Leone:\n*27 April 196128 December 1961: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\n*28 December 196119 April 1971: Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Sierra Leone and of Her Other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth\nOath of allegiance\nThe oath of allegiance in Sierra Leone was:\nA person could choose to replace the word swear with the phrase solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare, and to omit the phrase so help me God.\nCultural role\n}}\nThe Crown and Honours\nWithin the Commonwealth realms, the monarch is deemed the \"fount of honour\". Similarly, the monarch, as Sovereign of Sierra Leone, conferred awards and honours in Sierra Leone in her name. Most of them were awarded on the advice of \"Her Majesty's Sierra Leone Ministers\".\nThe Crown and the Defence Force\nThe Governor-General was the Commander-in-Chief of Sierra Leone.\nThe Crown sat at the pinnacle of the Sierra Leonean Defence Force. It was reflected in the Sierra Leonean Military Forces, which were known as \"Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces\". The prefix \"Royal\" was dropped when the Sierra Leonean monarchy was abolished.\nQueen's Personal Flag for Sierra Leone\nQueen Elizabeth II had a personal flag for use in Sierra Leone. It was used for the first time when she visited the nation in 1961. The flag featured the coat of arms of Sierra Leone in banner form, which depicts a lion beneath a zigzag border, representing the Lion Mountains, after which the country was named. It also shows three torches which are meant to symbolize peace and dignity. At the base are wavy bars depicting the sea. A blue disc of the letter \"E\" crowned surrounded by a garland of gold roses defaces the flag, which is taken from the Queen's Personal Flag. The Sierra Leonean standard also served as the inspiration for the design and layout of her personal standard for Canada.\nRoyal tour of 1961\nThe Queen said in her Christmas broadcast in 1958, that she and her husband would be visiting Sierra Leone in late 1959. But later the visit was postponed, as she had become pregnant in 1959.\nQueen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, visited Sierra Leone from 25 November to 1 December 1961. They arrived in Freetown on the royal yacht Britannia, and Queen Elizabeth II Quay was so-named as a result.\nElizabeth II was welcomed as the queen of Sierra Leone and she also used a distinct Sierra Leonean flag. Colloquially, she was referred to as Mama Queen II by the people of Sierra Leone. She was given a gold key to the city of Freetown by its mayor, who wore red robes and a cocked hat. The Queen and her husband stayed at the governor-general's residence during their visit. The monarch also presented new colours to the Royal Sierra Leone Regiment at the Brookfields Stadium. The new Queen's Colour incorporated the new flag of Sierra Leone. The new colours, placed upon piled drums, were blessed by the imam of the Muslim Congress – \"In thy holy name, O Allah, most gracious, most merciful\" – by the Roman Catholic bishop of Freetown and Bo, by the president of the United Christian Council and by the Anglican bishop of Freetown.\nIn Bo, a durbar of paramount chiefs was held for the Queen at the Bo Coronation field, where chiefs and their \"Devil Dancers\" performed for the royal couple. Each paramount chief was presented to the monarch and awarded a commemorative medal.\nThe Queen and the Duke toured several places and attended a number of events, including the Bo Hospital, an agricultural show in Kenema, the iron ore in Marampa, the Sierra Leone Press and Radio, a civic reception by the Freetown City Council, a gathering of chiefs and people at Port Loko, and the Children's Rally and Citizens' Parade in Freetown. In honour of the royal visit, an entire model village was laid out, so that the Queen could see how some of the people of Sierra Leone live in villages. She and her husband also attended a divine service at the St. George's Cathedral in Freetown, where they were received by the Bishop of Sierra Leone. The Duke of Edinburgh also visited the Guma Valley, where a dam was being built. At the University of Sierra Leone, Queen Elizabeth II, being the visitor of the university, presented degrees to students, accompanied by her husband and the prime minister.| salign=right| source=Elizabeth II of Sierra Leone, 1961}}\nAt a dinner banquet, Prime Minister Milton Margai addressed the Queen and said, \"your visit means above everything else that you are more to us than a distant Head of the Commonwealth. You are indeed Our Queen and we have a special claim on your interest, sympathy and affection\". The Queen, speaking of Prime Minister Milton Margai, said, \"Sierra Leone can count herself truly fortunate, but while gaining her independence, she has found a leader wise, experienced and devoted to her people\". In Freetown, she visited the Parliament of Sierra Leone, where she received a loyal address.\nAt the end of the tour, a garden party was given by Margai at his official residence. During her departure from Sierra Leone, the Queen was presented with an indigenous Sierra Leonean diamond by Margai, as a farewell gift.\nAbolition\nThe Sierra Leonean monarchy was abolished in 1971, when the country became a republic within the Commonwealth with a president as head of state.\nSee also\n*Medals of Sierra Leone (1961–1971)\n*Sierra Leone Independence Medal\nReferences"
