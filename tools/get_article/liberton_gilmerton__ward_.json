Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it elects four Councillors.\nAs its name suggests, the ward's territory is based around the communities of Gilmerton and Liberton in the far south-east of the city's urban area up to the boundary with Midlothian, also including Alnwickhill, Burdiehouse, Craigour, Ferniehill, Fernieside, Gracemount, The Inch, Kaimes, Moredun, Mortonhall and Southhouse, forming a suburban cluster that is almost physically separate from the rest of Edinburgh. A minor 2017 boundary change in the north of the ward saw the loss of Nether Liberton village, the Cameron Toll Shopping Centre and Inch Park, but the overall population increased slightly due to housebuilding in several other areas (Heritage Grange, The Limes, Manor Wood, South Gilmerton Brae, etc.). In 2019, the ward had a population of 35,480.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Conor Snowden(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Norma M Hart(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ian Murray(Labour)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Tom Buchanan(SNP)\n|-\n!2010 by\n|rowspan=3|Bill Cook(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Nick Cook(Conservative)\n|-\n!2013 by\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Keith John Robson(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Stephanie Smith(Conservative)\n|rowspan=2|Lezley Marion Cameron(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Derek Howie(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Lesley MacInnes(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Philip Doggart(Conservative)\n|rowspan=1|Martha Mattos Coelho(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\nOn 30 July 2020, councillor Derek Howie resigned from the SNP Group to become an Independent.\n2013 by-election\nSNP councillor Tom Buchanan died on 3 April 2013.
