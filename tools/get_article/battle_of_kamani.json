The village was captured and many of its inhabitants were massacred or fled.\nEvents\nDuring the War in Abkhazia in 1992-93, the villages along the Gumista River (north and east of Sukhumi) such as Kamani, Shroma, and Achadara were mainly populated by ethnic Georgians.\nHowever, the area was very important strategically, as it enabled motorized units to reach Sukhumi, the capital of the autonomous republic. After the failed attempt to storm Sukhumi from the west, the Abkhaz formations and their allies diverted their offensive on the northern and eastern sides of Sukhumi. The Georgian National Guard, volunteer units and battalions made up by local civilians, were taken by surprise. The Georgian side did not expect any offensive from the north or eastern sides of Sukhumi district. Due to this manoeuvring, the Abkhaz and their allies cut through the Georgian front line and attacked the villages along the side of Gumista river. The Georgian side suffered many losses and the defensive line around Sukhumi was breached by the Abkhaz offensive. On July 5, Abkhaz, Russian, Armenian Bagramyan battalion and North Caucasian detachments stormed the villages of Akhalsheni, Guma and Shroma of Sukhumi district. The residents from the villages were rounded up and massacred. The last offensive took place on July 9, on the village of Kamani. Kamani was a Svan (sub-ethnic group of the Georgian people) village which also included the Kamani Monastery (named after St George) and convent (populated by priests and nuns).\nThe Georgian forces who were protecting the pathways to Kamani were annihilated early in the morning after which the main assault on the village was undertaken at 10 a.m. Within a couple of hours the village fell to Abkhaz separatists and their allies. Soon after the Abkhaz and their allies started a violent rampage against the inhabitants of Kamani.\nSee also\n*War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)\n*Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160417191141/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4V0zzmDOxE Video file capturing Kamani tragedy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160418085503/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlKMXaKr68w Video file, Father Anua before the massacre]"
