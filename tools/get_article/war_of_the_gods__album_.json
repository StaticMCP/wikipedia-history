The album was produced by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff and arranged by Bobby Martin and Lenny Pakula. Released in 1973, the album reached number 12 on the Billboard soul chart and number 110 on the pop chart. The single \"Thanks for Saving My Life\" was a top 40 hit, reaching number 37 on the pop chart and was a top-10 soul record reaching number 9. In 2012, Big Break Records remastered and reissued the album on CD with bonus tracks and new liner notes.\nRelease and critical reception\non a rocky landscape dressed in colorful garb. Like the front/outer gatefold cover, this image suggests that the music will have a transporting, other-worldly quality.]]\nA departure from Paul's previous work, War of the Gods contains only six songs, nearly all of which are extended psychedelic soul song suites fusing jazz, soul, funk, Latin, rock, and pop. In the new liner notes for the 2012 reissue, Paul calls it \"the best album I've ever done in my life.\"\nStephen McMillian recounted Paul's appearance on Soul Train to promote the album: }}\nIn addition to the hit single \"Thanks for Saving My Life,\" the album's title track was released as a white label, promo-only single in two different, shorter forms. \"War of the Gods (Part I)\" was the A-side at 5:37 while \"War of the Gods (Part II)\" was the B-side at 4:42 (PIR single AE7-1080, 1973). The A-side is included as a bonus track on the BBR 2012 reissue. Also, \"The Whole Town's Talking\" was issued as a single in the UK (PIR single S 2225, 1974) and that shortened version of the album track also appears on the 2012 reissue as does the 4:00 single version of \"I Was Married\" (PIR single 3538, 1973).\nIn 2012, Paul called the album's title track his favorite of his own songs: \"It's very spiritual, and it tells people about war. Me and Marvin Gaye were tight and he did 'What's Going On.' I said to him I have to do my version and I went for it. Things that had happened in my life had affected me, and I wanted to tell the world how important it was, how important people were and most importantly how important God was. If anything the song is even more important and relevant today. A lot of my songs have had that effect.\"\nJoe Marchese of The Second Disc provided a detailed review of the BBR reissue, concluding: \"Though War of the Gods isn't one of the singer or label's most accessible albums, it's doubtless one of the most provocative and passionate.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, except where indicated.\nSide A\n#\"I See the Light\" – (Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, Bunny Sigler)  6:13\n#\"War of the Gods\" – 10:07\nSide B\n#\"The Whole Town's Talking\" –  4:46\n#\"I Was Married\" – (Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, Cary Gilbert, Joannie Arc) – 7:19\n#\"Thanks for Saving My Life\" – 2:58\n#\"Peace Holy Peace\" – 6:53\nCD Bonus tracks (2012 reissue)\n#\"War of the Gods (Part I)\" (Single Version) – 5:37\n#\"The Whole Town's Talking\" (Single Version) – 2:45\n#\"I Was Married\" (Single Version) (Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, Cary Gilbert, Joannie Arc) – 4:00\nLater releases\nThis album was reissued on the Super Audio CD format in September 2018 by UK label Dutton Vocalion, remastered in both stereo and Surround Sound from the original analogue tapes by Michael J.
