Founded in 1890, Queen's College is the oldest private school in the Bahamas.\nHistory\nQueen's College was the successor to the Bahamas Wesleyan Propriety Institution, which had opened in 1871.\nQueen's College opened on 6 January 1890 after a committee had been formed to establish the school and Victoria Hall was built to house the new school. Mr.  Wilson was recruited from Harrogate College, England, to be the school's principal, with his wife to head up the girls' department of the school.\nThe school operated under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society. In its first year, the school started with 67 students. By 1947–48, the school's enrolment had increased to 335 pupils.\nBy the late 1960s, the school's population had grown to more than 2,000 students.\nPrincipals\nFrom 1890 to 1925, the school continued under the guidance of S. B. Wilson and his successors, including Rev. W. J. P. White (c 1902) and Rev. Leonard Edge (1903–1908).\nIn 1925, Rev Richard P. Dyer took up the appointment as headmaster, a position he which held until 1959. Dyer was succeeded by Geoffrey Litherland (1959–64), Neville Stewart (1964–71), and Hayden Middleton (1971–79).\nThe first Bahamian administrator of Queen's College, Yvonne Noronha, was appointed vice principal of the college and headmistress of the primary school in 1978. This was followed by the appointment of Charles Sweeting in 1979. Sweeting served as principal until 1993.\nVice Principal Philip Cash was appointed principal in 1993 and served until he died in June 1997. In November 1997, Andrea Gibson became the first woman principal and served until 2019. Virginia Minnis was appointed head of the early learning centre in September 1999 and was the first Bahamian to serve in this post.\nThe school's current principal is Rev Henry Knowles, who has held the position since 2019.\nCurrent structure\nQueen's College consists of three sections: the early learning centre, a primary school and a high school. The school offers Advanced Placement courses, A+ certification, Advanced Subsidiary courses, SAT II course, and MOUS (Microsoft Office User Specialist Certification) certificates.\nSports\nThe Comets, the school sporting team, has won awards in basketball, volleyball, swimming, track & field, and soccer. For years, Queen's College has placed second in the Bahamas Association of Independent Secondary Schools (BAISS) Track and Field Championship. In 2015, the Comets secured their first victory over the St. Augustine's College (SAC) Big Red Machines, who were on a 20+ year winning streak.\nAdministration\nAs of 2025:\n*Principal: Rev.
