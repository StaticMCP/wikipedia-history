Mackay, after losing to Easts, defeated Ipswich in the minor semi final and upset the Pride 20–6 in the preliminary final to qualify for their first Grand Final.\nFirst half\nEasts were the first team to get on the board in the decided when centre Junior Sa'u scored in the 9th minute. In the 25th minute, they extended their lead to eight when Mackay put a dropout out on the full, kicking a penalty goal from right in front. The Cutters finally cracked the Tigers when winger Bureta Faraimo crossed in the right corner in the 29th minute. They took the lead for the first time when Faraimo scored his second in the 32nd minute, sprinting 50 metres down the sideline after a pass from his centre Michael Morgan. The lead didn't last long, as Easts scored in the 38th minute, when Sa'u latched onto a kick that the Cutters let bounce to score his second try.\nSecond half\nMackay levelled the scores at 14-all seven minutes into the second half when winger David Milne scored in the left corner. In the 64th minute, Mackay captured their second lead of the contest when Morgan picked up a loose ball and ran 50 metres to score in the right corner. Again, the lead did not last long, as Easts' prop Mitch Garbutt muscled over to score in the 69th minute. The Cutters took a one-point lead when halfback Matt Minto slotted a field goal from 20 metres out with six minutes left in the game. Mackay sealed the win in the 79th minute when hooker Anthony Mitchell darted from dummy half to score and secure the club's first Queensland Cup premiership. Mitchell was awarded the Duncan Hall Medal for Man of Match.\nA North Queensland Cowboys feeder club, the Cutters' side featured Michael Morgan and Jason Taumalolo, who would both go on to become NRL regulars for the Cowboys and play in the club's 2015 NRL Grand Final win over the Brisbane Broncos.\nEnd-of-season awards\n* Courier Mail Medal (Best and Fairest): Cody Walker ( Easts Tigers)\n* Coach of the Year: Jason Demetriou ( Northern Pride)\n* Rookie of the Year: Cameron Munster ( Central Queensland Capras)\n* Representative Player of the Year: Nick Slyney ( Queensland Residents,  Redcliffe Dolphins)\n* '''XXXX People's Choice Award:''' Hezron Murga ( Northern Pride)\nSee also\n* Queensland Cup\n* Queensland Rugby League\nReferences"
