It was Tùng's 2013 single, \"Em của ngày hôm qua\", that helped him to reach mainstream status. Both songs earned him the monthly honors from music chart television program Favorite Song. \"Cơn mưa ngang qua\" also received a Zing Music Award for R&B Song of the Year. In 2014, he was disqualified from Favorite Song and Green Wave Award nominations due to accusations of plagiarism toward many of his songs' instrumental tracks.\nThe singer later turned to acting in the feature film Dandelion (2014), a role which gave him a respected Golden Kite Prize for Young Prominent Actor. The film's soundtrack, \"Chắc ai đó sẽ về\", and his other single \"Âm thầm bên em\", respectively won a WeChoice Award for Song of the Year and a Green Wave Award for Single of the Year. At the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards, Tùng won Best Southeast Asian Act and received Best Asian Act nomination. The three following years saw him win a prestigious Dedication Music Award for Artist of the Year in 2016, a Mnet Asian Music Award for Vietnamese Breakout Artist in 2017, another Green Wave Award for Single of the Year (for his song \"Lạc trôi\") and a WeChoice Award for Breakout Artist in 2018.\nSince 2015, Tùng has been included on the Green Wave Awards' top five Most Favorite Singers (Top Hit board) list on three consecutive occasions.

Forbes Vietnam also included Tùng in their 2018 edition of 30 Under 30 list. In addition to music and film recognition, he was given a 2017 Vietnamese Elle Style Award for Most Stylish Male Singer.
