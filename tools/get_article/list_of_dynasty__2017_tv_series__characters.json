When Fallon's machinations to separate the couple backfire and cost her a promotion, she allies with Blake's nemesis, Jeff Colby (Sam Adegoke), and strikes out on her own. Meanwhile, the arrival of Cristal's opportunistic nephew Sam (Rafael de la Fuente)—who becomes romantically involved with Fallon's wayward brother Steven (James Mackay)—threatens to expose Cristal's shady past. Watching out for the Carringtons are majordomo Anders (Alan Dale) and chauffeur Michael Culhane (Robert Christopher Riley). Later in the season, Fallon marries Liam Ridley (Adam Huber) to thwart Jeff's plot to ruin her, and Blake's ex-wife Alexis Carrington (Nicollette Sheridan), the estranged mother of Steven and Fallon, returns. Season two introduces Ana Brenda Contreras as Cristal Jennings; Maddison Brown as Anders' daughter Kirby; Sam Underwood as Adam Carrington, Blake and Alexis' eldest son; and Michael Michele as Dominique Deveraux, Blake's half-sister and the mother of Jeff and Monica Colby (Wakeema Hollis). In season three, Daniella Alonso portrays Cristal, and Elaine Hendrix plays Alexis. Season four introduces Eliza Bennett as Alexis' secret daughter by Blake, Amanda.\nThe reboot updates several elements from the 1980s original, including moving the setting from Denver, Colorado to Atlanta, Georgia; making Steven's homosexuality a nonissue to Blake; and changing gold digger Sammy Jo from a woman to a gay man. Additionally, in the new series, Blake's new wife and her nephew are Hispanic, both Michael and the Colby family are African-American, and Amanda is a lesbian.\nOverview\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Actor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"6\" | Appearances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | First\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px;\"|1\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px;\"|2\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px;\"|3\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px;\"|4\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px;\"|5\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"background-color:#ccccff;\" | Main characters\n|-\n| Elizabeth Gillies\n| Fallon Carrington\n| rowspan=\"8\" | \"I Hardly Recognized You\"\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n| Nathalie Kelley\n| Celia Machado / Cristal Flores\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| James Mackay\n| Steven Carrington\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\n|-\n| Robert Christopher Riley\n| Michael Culhane\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n| Sam Adegoke\n| Jeff Colby\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n| Rafael de la Fuente\n| Samuel \"Sammy Jo\" Jones\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n| Alan Dale\n| Joseph Anders\n| colspan=\"4\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| Grant Show\n| Blake Carrington\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n| Nicollette Sheridan\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Alexis Carrington Colby\n| \"Poor Little Rich Girl\"\n|\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Elaine Hendrix\n| \"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Ana Brenda Contreras\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Cristal Jennings Carrington\n| \"Twenty-Three Skidoo\"\n|\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Daniella Alonso\n| \"Guilt Trip To Alaska\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Maddison Brown\n| Kirby Anders\n| \"Twenty-Three Skidoo\"\n| }}\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| Sam Underwood\n| Adam Carrington\n| \"Parisian Legend Has It...\"\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| Michael Michele\n| Dominique Deveraux\n| \"New Lady in Town\"\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Adam Huber\n| Liam Ridley\n| \"Our Turn Now\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Eliza Bennett\n| Amanda Carrington\n| \"The British Are Coming\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"background-color:#ccccff;\" | Recurring characters\n|-\n| Wakeema Hollis\n| Monica Colby\n| rowspan=\"3\" | \"I Hardly Recognized You\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| Brianna Brown\n| Claudia Blaisdel\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| Nick Wechsler\n| Matthew Blaisdel\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| Elena Tovar\n| Iris Machado\n| \"Guilt is for Insecure People\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n| Michael Patrick Lane\n| Ted Dinard\n| \"Company Slut\"\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n|  Luis Fernández\n| Alejandro Raya\n| \"The Best Things in Life\"\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n| Hakeem Kae-Kazim\n| Cesil Colby\n| \"Rotten Things\"\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Brent Antonello\n| Hank Sullivan\n| \"A Line from the Past\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Katherine LaNasa\n| Ada Stone\n| \"The Butler Did It\"\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Nicole Zyana\n| Allison\n| \"How Two-Faced Can You Get\"\n|\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| Sharon Lawrence\n| Laura Van Kirk\n| \"The Butler Did It\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"1\"\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| Ken Kirby\n| Evan Tate\n| “Wild Ghost Chase”\n| colspan=2\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Kelli Barrett\n| Nadia\n| rowspan= 2|\"Mother?

She positions herself as her father's business rival, backed by Blake's nemesis Jeff Colby. Oblivious to Jeff's attraction to her, Fallon is carrying on a sexual relationship with the family chauffeur, Michael Culhane.\nCristal Flores Carrington\nCarrington Atlantic's head of public relations, Cristal Flores (Nathalie Kelley), marries Blake and immediately makes an enemy of his daughter Fallon. Cristal's married ex-lover, Matthew Blaisdel, is killed in the aftermath of a suspicious explosion, which implicates the Carringtons. Cristal—whose real name is Celia Machado—is also trying to hide certain details of her past from Blake, which is made more difficult by the arrival of her nephew Sam Jones.\nSteven Carrington\nBlake's son Steven Carrington (James Mackay) devotes himself to environmental and humanitarian causes, often in opposition to his father's business interests. He becomes romantically involved with Sam, who he soon discovers is his new stepmother Cristal's nephew.\nMichael Culhane\nBlake's chauffeur Michael Culhane (Robert Christopher Riley) is Fallon's lover and unofficial henchman; he has feelings for her which at first seem unrequited, but in losing him Fallon realizes that she loves him.\nJeff Colby\nJeff Colby (Sam Adegoke) is a high school friend of Fallon's, and Blake's former employee. He made a fortune from software he created while working for Blake, which the court ruled was his own property. Blake has never forgiven him for this \"betrayal\". Jeff finances Fallon's business venture to be close to her, but it takes a while for her to begin to see his value as a partner. In \"Trashy Little Tramp\", it is revealed that Jeff's mother Millie is Blake Carrington's half-sister.\nSam \"Sammy Jo\" Jones\nCristal's opportunistic nephew Samuel Josiah \"Sammy Jo\" Jones (Rafael de la Fuente) becomes romantically involved with Steven. Sam's presence makes Cristal nervous, as he knows her secrets.\nJoseph Anders\nStaunchly protective of the Carringtons, majordomo Joseph Anders (Alan Dale) is threatened by Cristal's presence as the new would-be mistress of the mansion, as well as her scheming nephew Sam.\nBlake Carrington\nAtlanta energy tycoon Blake Carrington (Grant Show as an adult, Jax Buresh as a teenager) marries public relations executive Cristal Flores, which lands his family at the center of a scandal when Cristal's married ex-lover Matthew Blaisdel is killed in a suspicious explosion. The marriage—and Blake's promotion of Cristal to COO of his company, Carrington Atlantic—put him at odds with his daughter Fallon, who allies herself with Blake's nemesis Jeff Colby as a business rival to her father. Blake already has a complicated relationship with his son Steven, who disapproves of his father's capitalistic politics and underhanded business tactics.\nAlexis Carrington Colby\nBlake's long absent ex-wife Alexis (Nicollette Sheridan) reappears at Thomas' funeral in \"Poor Little Rich Girl\", and she soon makes an enemy of her daughter Fallon in \"Enter Alexis\". The role was later portrayed by Elizabeth Gillies in three episodes of season two, and played by Elaine Hendrix in seasons three, four and five .\nCristal Jennings Carrington\nCristal Jennings (Ana Brenda Contreras), the woman from whom Celia Machado got her identity as Cristal, comes to Atlanta to offer her condolences to Blake in season two. The role is played by Daniella Alonso in seasons three, four and five.\nKirby Anders\nAnders's estranged daughter arrives at the Carrington manor by Sam's invitation in \"Dead Scratch\". Anders keeps Kirby (Maddison Brown) at a distance from the Carringtons in \"Twenty-Three Skidoo\", and father and daughter clash over her wild lifestyle and his mistrust.\nAdam Carrington\nAdam Carrington (Sam Underwood), Blake and Alexis's eldest son who was kidnapped as an infant, arrives in Atlanta looking to reclaim the life and family he was denied.\nDominique Deveraux\nDominique Deveraux (Michael Michele), Jeff and Monica's mother and Blake's half-sister, reappears in \"New Lady in Town\" after abandoning her family for a singing career in New York years before.\nLiam Ridley\nLiam Ridley (Adam Huber) meets and agrees to marry Fallon Carrington to thwart Jeff's plot against her. Over time, the business relationship evolves into a romantic one.\nAmanda Carrington\nAmanda Carrington (Eliza Bennett), Alexis' secret daughter by Blake who was raised by her cousin in England. She arrives in Atlanta in \"The British Are Coming\" after her adoptive mother dies, seeking answers about her biological family. Amanda is later involved in a lesbian relationship with Kirby Anders.\nRecurring\nIntroduced in season one\nMatthew Blaisdel\nMatthew Blaisdel (portrayed by Nick Wechsler) is Blake's top field engineer at Carrington Atlantic, and Cristal's former lover. Engaged to Blake, Cristal says goodbye to Matthew in \"I Hardly Recognized You\", and Fallon uses photos of their kiss to try to separate Cristal and Blake. Meanwhile, on his final job for Blake before he resigns, Matthew is injured in an explosion, and later dies. His widow, Claudia, accuses Blake of murder. The explosion is determined to have been caused by sabotage, and the Carringtons work to hide Cristal's connection to Matthew in \"Spit It Out\". Matthew's friend Willy Santiago tells Cristal that before his death, Matthew refused Blake's offer of a job transfer to China. Fallon leaks a sex tape of Cristal and Matthew in \"Private as a Circus\", and the Carringtons are cleared of wrongdoing in Matthew's death by Willy's suicide note. Confronting the Carringtons at gunpoint in \"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\", Claudia admits to setting the explosion that killed Matthew, though his death was not her intent. Claudia is subdued, and with Police Chief Stansfield's help, Blake sends Claudia to a sanitarium rather than prison. Matthew, not dead after all, visits Claudia at the facility in \"Trashy Little Tramp\", vengeful toward the Carringtons. He helps Claudia escape the sanitarium in \"Dead Scratch\", and they infiltrate the mansion. Claudia snaps and confronts Cristal with a gun. Matthew steps between them as Claudia fires, except that Matthew is a figment of her imagination, and Cristal takes the bullet.\nExecutive producer Sallie Patrick said of reimagining the character:\nClaudia Blaisdel\nMatthew's wife, Claudia Blaisdel (portrayed by Brianna Brown), is recovering from a head injury that has left her with memory loss. Distraught over Matthew's death, she accuses Blake of killing him.\nMonica Colby\nJeff's sister Monica Colby (portrayed by Wakeema Hollis) is Fallon's best friend from high school. She is initially angry with her father Cesil for the crimes that landed him in jail, and with her mother Dominique Deveraux for abandoning the family years before.\nIris Machado and Alejandro Raya\nIris Machado (portrayed by Elena Tovar) is Cristal's sister and Sam's mother, first seen in flashback in \"Guilt is for Insecure People\". After stealing a fortune in cash, she and Cristal plan to flee Venezuela. Cristal arrives at their rendezvous point, but is forced to leave alone when Iris does not show up. In the present, Cristal learns through Sam that Iris is once again on the run and needs money, but Cristal is unable to access any funds without Anders knowing. Sam arranges a robbery at the mansion to come up with the money. Another flashback in \"The Best Things in Life\" reveals that Iris' abusive boyfriend Alejandro Raya (portrayed by Luis Fernández), who is Sam's father, was responsible for Cristal's miscarriage. Her need for medical care prompted the sisters to steal the money from Iris' criminal employers. In the present, Cristal receives a threat, and Anders helps her pay off her pursuers. Blake brings Iris to Atlanta for the holidays in \"Rotten Things\". Cristal and Anders discover that Iris was behind the extortion plot, and a confrontation with her sister causes Cristal to admit to Sam that she killed his father to defend Iris. Blake later greets a business associate, Diego Callestada, who is in fact Alejandro. He reveals himself to Cristal in \"A Well-Dressed Tarantula\", threatening to expose Blake's father's past crimes if she does not help him close a deal with Carrington Atlantic. Cristal and the Carringtons—with Sam's help—turn the tables on Alejandro and Iris. After being told by Cristal that they are no longer sisters, Iris chloroforms and abducts Fallon. In \"I Answer to No Man\", Alejandro and Iris hold Fallon hostage in a warehouse. Cristal delivers the ransom alone, and is taken as a hostage as well. She eventually convinces Iris that Alejandro is bad and will only turn on her, and as Alejandro tries to strangle Cristal, Iris shoots and kills him. The sisters reconcile. Cristal sends Iris off with some cash, and tells the police she shot Alejandro in self-defense, not Iris.\nIt's revealed in the fifth season that Sam's biological father is Daniel Ruiz, a horse trainer that Iris became romantically involved with during one of her separations from Alejandro. Iris kept Sam's paternity a secret. In \"I'll Settle for a Prayer\", Fallon finds Iris living in Idaho, consumed with guilt, and brings her back to Atlanta to reconcile with Sam and a terminally ill Daniel before his death.\nTed Dinard\nTed Dinard (portrayed by Michael Patrick Lane) is Steven's ex-boyfriend from New York, who reappears in \"Company Slut\". Sober for two years and working for the Sky Conservancy Organization, Ted apologizes to Steven for the dissolution of their relationship, which included a drug-addicted Ted accepting money from Blake to leave Steven. Steven is poised to forgive Ted, but finds that Ted has slept with Sam. In \"The Best Things in Life\", a distraught Steven does a line of cocaine and calls Ted to say that he is on his way to New York to see him. Steven's grandfather Thomas drags him back to Atlanta in \"Rotten Things\", followed by Ted. Though Steven plans to travel with Ted rather than go to rehab, Ted is arrested for drug possession and faces his third strike. Blake is unable to help because Jeff and Steven coerced Police Chief Stansfield to retire. Though Steven and an impressed Thomas believe that Blake set Ted up, Jeff is actually behind it. In \"Nothing but Trouble\", Steven decides to run for city council, and lets Ted know that tales of their wild past may become public. A distraught Ted, using drugs and believing that Sam and Steven are romantically involved, stages a scuffle with Sam and leaps out of an upper story window. He is brought unconscious to the hospital in \"The Gospel According to Blake Carrington\", and at Blake's urging, Steven spins the potentially negative publicity by pretending to be Ted's grieving partner. At Ted's hospital bedside, Steven manipulates Ted's religious father, Gerard \"Gerry\" Dinard (Stephan Jones), to reclaim Sam's missing earring from Ted's belongings. Ted wakes up, but his father whisks him off to rehab before he is able to say anything to the police about his fall.\nPatrick said after the character's first appearance in November 2017, \"Ted Dinard is a character from the OG Dynasty who played a big part in season 1...So let's just say, he'll be back.\"\nLuella Culhane\nLuella Culhane (portrayed by Arnetia Walker) is the wife of James, and Michael and Evie's mother. In \"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\", she and James are under the impression that Michael is a Vice President for Carrington Atlantic. Luella and James learn the truth when meeting Fallon Carrington, Michael's longtime lover, and learn that he is in fact the Carringtons' chauffeur. Luella struggles to get in contact with Michael in \"Enter Alexis\", and she reappears in \"Don't Con a Con Artist\" when James is hospitalized after falling deathly ill. In \"Use or Be Used\", Luella encourages Fallon to stay away from Michael due to the stress regarding James' health.\nIn the second season episode, \"That Witch\", Luella is displeased to learn that Fallon and Michael are engaged despite the Carringtons' involvement in the Clark County water scandal that caused James' death. Luella ultimately approves of Fallon and Michael's impending marriage, but she threatens Fallon if she hurts Michael. Jeff calls in a favor to Blake, who has Luella and Evie robbed in \"The Sight of You\" as revenge against Michael.\nLuella reappears in the fifth season episode, \"How Did the Board Meeting Go?\", to give Michael advice about his quest for love. This advice proves successful, and Luella makes her final appearance in the series finale, \"Catch 22\", where she witnesses Michael marry Nina Fournier.\nCesil Colby\nCesil Baldwin Colby (portrayed by Hakeem Kae-Kazim) is Jeff and Monica's father. In \"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\", it is established that he is in jail. In \"Rotten Things\", Monica refuses Fallon's urging to visit him, and Cesil lashes out at Fallon. When Jeff visits, he and Cesil discuss their vendetta against Blake, who they say slept with Cesil's wife and framed him on drug charges. In \"Nothing but Trouble\", Blake tasks Anders to bribe a prison guard to stage an attack intended to prevent Cesil from being paroled. The parole board votes against his release, but Jeff sleeps with the parole commissioner, who sets Cesil free. Confined to Jeff's house with an ankle monitor in \"The Gospel According to Blake Carrington\", Cesil is compelled to go along with Jeff's plan to marry Fallon as a means to destroy Blake. However, seeing Jeff and Monica so close to Fallon and Michael at dinner sets Cesil off, and he angrily reveals to Fallon the crimes Blake has committed against the Colbys. When Fallon and Michael have left, Cesil tells Jeff that he is taking over the plot against Blake himself. In \"Our Turn Now\", the Carringtons are planning Jeff and Fallon's wedding, which is actually a diversion while they attempt to erase the data Jeff has stolen from them. Cesil refuses to attend the rehearsal, so Blake makes a personal plea to Cesil to put their differences aside and come to the wedding. The Carringtons manage to turn the tables on Jeff. A vengeful Cesil moves to confront Blake with a gun, but instead comes upon Thomas, who has a heart attack. Cesil flees at Jeff's urging, and Thomas admits to the Carringtons that Blake never had an affair, but was just covering for Thomas. As Jeff and Fallon's feud goes public in \"Poor Little Rich Girl\", Monica cuts ties with Jeff and takes guardianship of Cesil. Blake's ex-wife, Alexis, gets Cesil's house arrest extended in \"A Line From the Past\" as a way to re-fuel Jeff's vendetta against Blake. In addition, she reveals that he is a Carrington. As it turns out, Blake's closeness with Cesil's wife stemmed from the two of them being siblings rather than having an affair.\nIn the season two episode \"Crazy Lady\", it is confirmed that Cesil's house arrest has come to an end. Cesil helps Monica take care of Jeff after being poisoned in \"New Lady in Town\", the same time his ex-wife, Dominique Deveraux, returns from New York. Cesil welcomes Dominique back into the family, though Jeff and Monica are more hesitant.\nKae-Kazim was cast in November 2017.\nMelissa Daniels\nMelissa Daniels (portrayed by Kelly Rutherford) is introduced in the season one episode \"Promises You Can't Keep\" as a \"spiraling lush\" who is married to Senator Paul Daniels (portrayed by Rick Hearst). She gives Cristal advice about being married to a powerful man, noting her own husband's many infidelities. When Melissa reappears in \"Poor Little Rich Girl\", she is divorcing Paul following a scandal made public thanks to Cristal. Steven seeks help from Melissa, with whom he had an affair 10 years before, to secure an O-1 visa for Sam. Steven agrees to Melissa's demand that he have sex with her. In \"Dead Scratch\", Melissa reveals to Steven that she is pregnant with his child, moments before he is set to marry Sam.\nIn season two, Melissa's pregnancy is showing in \"Twenty-Three Skidoo\", but Steven has still not told Sam about it because Sam is mourning Cristal. In \"Ship of Vipers\", Sam and Alexis suspect that Melissa is not really pregnant, but they are proven wrong. Anders confirms that Steven is his biological child in \"The Butler Did It\". Now that she believes her baby is no longer a Carrington heir, Melissa admits that Steven is not the father.\nLearning that she is the President of the Atlanta Historical Alliance in the season three episode \"Wild Ghost Chase\", Sam faces off with Melissa, who refuses to cancel the media day she has planned for his new hotel La Mirage even though its designer was an infamous homophobe. In the fifth season episode \"Vicious Vendetta\", Sam reveals that Melissa is in the middle of her third divorce.\nRutherford's initial casting was announced in November 2017.\nMrs. Gunnerson\nMrs. Gunnerson (Natalie Karp) is the long-time cook in the Carrington manor, introduced in \"Don't Con a Con Artist\" where Blake fires her to set an example for the household staff to not serve Alexis, who recently moved into the loft above the stables. Blake's actions are condemned by both Cristal and Joseph, and Mrs. Gunnerson is rehired. Blake's love for Mrs. Gunnerson's cooking is referenced throughout the series, and she is shown directing the kitchen staff for many events set at the manor. In \"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\", Mrs. Gunnerson is among the staff that Joseph interviews to determine who is acting as a mole for the prosecution. Mrs. Gunnerson last appears in \"More Power to Her\", as the kitchen prepares for Fallon and Liam's baby shower.\nTony\nTony first appears amongst the household staff in \"Don't Con a Con Artist\" as Blake instructs his employees to not serve Alexis, who recently moved into the loft above the stables. In \"Snowflakes in Hell\", Anders approaches Tony (portrayed by Bill Barrett) about taking over as his replacement once he steps down as majordomo.\nIn \"Filthy Games\", Tony (portrayed by Chase Anderson) is revealed to be in a relationship with housekeeper Joy. Alexis uses Tony's affair as blackmail throughout \"Even Worms Can Procreate\" to do her bidding when it comes to splitting up Blake and Cristal. In \"Parisian Legend Has It...\", Tony acts as Alexis's alibi for the time of Mark Jennings' murder and Cristal's miscarriage. Though Tony suspects Alexis was involved, he remains silent out of fear.\nIn \"Guilt Trip to Alaska\", Tony is mentioned to have rescued Liam from drowning in the Carringtons' pool. Tony is among the household staff investigated by Joseph in \"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\" when there is suspicions of a mole for the District Attorney in the manor. In \"What Sorrows Are You Drowning?\", a frightened Tony warns Alexis that Cristal is questioning the day of the accident, but Alexis maintains her innocence.\nHank Sullivan\nSteven's search for his older brother Adam—kidnapped as an infant and never returned due to a trigger-happy police officer botching their exchange—leads him to Hank Sullivan (portrayed by Brent Antonello) in \"A Line from the Past\". Steven brings Hank/Adam home to Atlanta in \"Trashy Little Tramp\", where he is accepted by Alexis but rejected by Blake. Blake confides in Sam that the kidnappers cut off Adam's finger, though he never told Alexis. When it is revealed that Hank has a prosthetic finger, Blake is convinced of his identity. Hank later visits Alexis; he is actually her lover, with whom she is conspiring to amass enough Carrington Atlantic shares to seize control of the company. In \"Dead Scratch\", Hank is added to the Carrington trust along with newly-discovered Carringtons Jeff and Monica Colby, who declare their intention to force a sale of the company. Defying Alexis's orders, Hank is seduced by the money and votes with the Colbys. Cristal discovers Alexis and Hank's ruse, and he flees with Claudia.\nHank, who is the prime suspect in Cristal's murder, blackmails Alexis in \"Twenty-Three Skidoo\", threatening to expose their plan. He also reveals that he started the fire. Hank tries to sell the Rembrandt that Alexis gave him as collateral in \"Queen of Cups\", but she intervenes to keep him away from Blake. Claudia then berates Hank for his failure to get the money. In \"That Witch\", Hank cuts Claudia out of his payoff from Alexis. Realizing that Claudia is unhinged, he takes baby Matthew and leaves him on Alexis's doorstep.\nIntroduced in season two\nLaura Van Kirk\nFollowing the sudden death of her brother Max, Laura Van Kirk (portrayed by Sharon Lawrence) arrives in Atlanta in \"The Butler Did It\" to check up on her son Liam, as well as to meet her new daughter-in-law Fallon. Having suffered a nervous breakdown following the death of her first husband, Laura has spent years taking out her anger and frustration on Liam. Fallon ultimately stands up for Liam, creating conflict between the two women. Laura returns in \"This Illness of Mine\" with news that she has cancer, though this turns out to be a ruse to gain Liam's sympathy. Laura has been assisted in this by Fallon's brother Adam, with whom she has also been involved in a sexual relationship.\nIn \"Caution Never Won a War\", Laura sabotages Fallon's attempts to help Liam regain his memories of their relationship after he develops amnesia. She files for a restraining order against Fallon and remains by Liam's side in the hospital, making it impossible for Fallon to see him. In \"Something Desperate\", she works to keep Fallon away while speeding along Liam's impending wedding to Ashley, but Liam calls it off upon understanding that there is more to his forgotten life he needs to figure out on his own. It is revealed in \"Is the Next Surgery on the House?\" that Laura convinced Liam's former girlfriend Heidi to lie and say she was pregnant with his son when in reality her child belonged to Liam's father. With Liam cutting contact with his mother and pursuing his future with Fallon, Laura makes a deal with Blake to put an end to Fallon and Liam's engagement in exchange for her signing off on Carrington Atlantic being sold back to him. Though Blake double-crosses her in \"She Cancelled...\", Laura is convinced that their plan was a success, and she and Blake have sex. Laura arrives at Fallon and Liam's rehearsal dinner in \"That Unfortunate Dinner\" in hopes of making amends with Liam. Fallon reluctantly helps the two of them reconcile, but Laura's affair with Blake is exposed in the midst of Blake and Cristal's respective infidelity becoming a hot topic of discussion.\nAdam makes a deal with Laura in \"Do You Always Talk to Turtles\", agreeing to get Laura into contact with Liam in exchange for Van Kirk Industries illegally importing the secret ingredient to his new anti-aging drug. Laura needs Liam's vote at the next Van Kirk Industries board meeting to secure her place as CEO. Liam refuses to help Laura, and in turn Laura publicly shames Fallon for being unable to conceive a child. When Liam sides with Fallon, Laura declares that she is cutting him out of her will. Before holding up her end of the deal with Adam, Laura becomes disoriented from injecting too much of Adam's anti-aging drug and trips, fatally impaling herself with the heel of her shoe.\nLawrence's casting was announced in August 2018, initially meant to appear in a single episode. The character was described as \"so overpowering and manipulative that she puts Fallon's mother, Alexis, to shame.\"\nAda Stone\nIn \"The Butler Did It\", unscrupulous power broker Ada Stone (portrayed by Katherine LaNasa) blackmails Michael with information that will send Fallon to jail. Ada forces Michael into a high-stakes poker game run by a business rival to photograph documents for her in \"Snowflakes in Hell\", after which she arranges for the game to be raided by the FBI. In \"Queen of Cups\", Michael and Jeff work together against Ada, but she outmaneuvers them. Fallon and Monica's new business venture threatens Jeff and Michael's poker game in \"A Temporary Infestation\", which does not please Ada. Michael agrees to do one last job smuggling artifacts for Ada in \"A Real Instinct for the Jugular\", and talks his way out of a dangerous situation. She gives him all of her blackmail material on Fallon and a $5 million bonus, but asks him to keep working with her. In \"Crazy Lady\", Ada sets up Van Kirk Industries to be implicated in a drug smuggling operation, fully aware that Michael and Jeff would be caught in the FBI raid.\nLaNasa is the real-life wife of Grant Show, who stars as Blake.\nAshley Cunningham\nIntroduced as Liam's girlfriend in \"A Champagne Mood\", Ashley Cunningham (portrayed by Taylor Black) comes from a wealthy New York-based family who are close with the Van Kirks. Fallon follows Liam and Ashley on their ski trip to Sun Valley in \"The Sight of You\", determined to win Liam back.
