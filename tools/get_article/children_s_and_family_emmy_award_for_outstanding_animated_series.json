The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022, and is a sister category to the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Preschool Animated Series, which honors shows aimed at younger audiences.\nThe inaugural recipient of the award was Netflix series City of Ghosts. The current holder of the award is the Disney+ series Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, which won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. Animated programming aimed towards children was honored from 1985 to 2021 with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Animated Program. Following the establishment of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards, this award was discontinued.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"10%\" | Series\n! width=\"30%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n! width=\"3%\" | Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022(1st)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n|City of Ghosts\n| Elizabeth Ito (executive producer); Joanne Shen (co-executive producer); Dayla Kennedy (line producer)\n| Netflix\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| The Cuphead Show!\n| CJ Kettler, Chad Moldenhauer, Jared Moldenhauer, Dave Wasson (executive producer); Cosmo Segurson (co-executive producer); Carolyn Roach, Jackie Watson (line producers)\n| Netflix\n|-\n| The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder\n| Ralph Farquhar, Bruce W.
