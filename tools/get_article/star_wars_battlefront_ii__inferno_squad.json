The novel was published in 2017 by Del Rey Books. The story takes place immediately after the events of Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977). Inferno Squad is the second book in the Star Wars: Battlefront tie-in novel series, following Battlefront: Twilight Company. The novel follows Iden Versio, protagonist of the Star Wars Battlefront II single-player campaign. The book focuses on Inferno Squad's creation and its early missions.\nPlot summary\nThe book starts with Iden as a TIE Fighter pilot protecting the Death Star from the Rebel Alliance's starfighters at the Battle of Yavin. We then see her and other Imperials called to a secret meeting. Iden's father forms Inferno Squad, a special forces unit, and they are given a mission to recover blackmail material from an Imperial Governor. Then, they must extract a rebel that decides to side with the Galactic Empire, betraying the other rebels. After the team recovers a data chip from that mission, they go on an undercover mission to join the Dreamers, a rebel partisan group that is the sole remnant of Saw Gerrera's Rebels. Eventually, the rebel group is destroyed and Iden encounters the mysterious advisor of the group. He turns out to be Lux Bonteri, a character in the animated series The Clone Wars and former senator and friend of Saw Gererra.\nMain characters\nIden Versio serves as the main protagonist of the story while Gideon Hask, Del Meeko and Seyn Marana serve as secondary protagonists and Staven as the antagonist. Garrick Versio has a supporting role.\nPublishing\nThis book was published by Del Rey Books, a division of Penguin Random House. This book was initially released on July 25, 2017.\nReception\nMegan Crouse of Den of Geek gave the book a 3.5 out of 5 rating, and said that \"After the first half is over, the tie-in novel loses some steam, but fans [...] will probably be satisfied by the majority of the story.\" Nerdist wrote: \"I couldn’t quite cheer for the successes Inferno Squad found, but I was riveted and invested in what happened next.\" Dork Side of the Force said the novel has a handful of memorable moments and cool connections to the canon.\nSee also\n*List of Star Wars books\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtini.com/book/battlefront-ii-inferno-squad Inferno Squad on Youtini, a Star Wars book information site]\n*Inferno Squad on Wookieopedia, a Star Wars Wiki"
