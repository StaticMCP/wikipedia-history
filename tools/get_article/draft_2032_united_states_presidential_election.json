The winner of this election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2033. Voters in each state and the District of Columbia will choose electors to the Electoral College, who will then elect a president and vice president for a term of four years.\nThe presidential election will take place at the same time as elections for the U.S. Senate, House, gubernatorial, and state legislatures.\nElectoral system\nThe Electoral College elects the president and vice president of the United States, the number of electoral votes of each state is determined by the amount of senators and representatives in each state with an addition three representatives for Washington, D.C.. Almost all the states use a winner-take-all system, in which the states award all of their electors to the winner of the popular vote. The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, in which two vote are given to the winner of the popular vote, meanwhile each congressional district get's 1 vote. Elector vote are certified by state electors in December and by the U.S. Congress on January 6th. Presidential candidates are selected in a presidential primary, that are conducted through a primary election run by the state government or a caucuses run by the state parties which bind convention delegates to candidates. When a candidate does not receive a majority of votes one the first round, then a brokered convention occurs. A brokered convention can also occur if a candidate withdraws, for example, after Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 United States presidential election, a brokered convention was called and the delegates voted for Kamala Harris.\nElection Day in the United States is held on the first Tuesday that falls after the first Monday in November. The 2032 presidential election will occur on November 2, 2032.\nCandidates\nCurrently, there is no new coverage on potential 2032 candidates. This is because usually presidential candidates announce they're campaigns after the 2028 United States presidential election. But there will be notable candidates once the 2028 United States presidential election is over.\nReferences"
