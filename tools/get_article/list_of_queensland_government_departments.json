      "text": "# List of Queensland Government departments\n\nThere are 21 Queensland Government departments, each responsible for delivering a portfolio of government legislation and policy. Each portfolio area is led by a minister who is a senior member of the governing party in the state Legislative Assembly. The minister is formally appointed by the governor of Queensland on behalf of the monarch, but is appointed on the recommendation of the premier. Each government department is led by a director-general or commissioner, who reports to the responsible minister. The minister has responsibility for instituting government policy and setting the department's priorities, whereas the director-general or commissioner leads the department operationally and is employed under the state's Public Sector Act 2022.\nIn addition to departments, there are also several government-owned corporations such as the Queensland Treasury Corporation and Energy Queensland.\nList of government departments\nIn November 2024, the newly elected Crisafulli ministry introduced machinery of government changes to dissolve the former Department of Energy and Climate and restructure the remaining departments.
