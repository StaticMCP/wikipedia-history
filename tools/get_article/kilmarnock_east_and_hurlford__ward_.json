It elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 15,570 people.\nThe area has produced strong results for both Labour and the Scottish National Party (SNP) with the former holding two seats between 2007 and 2017 and the latter taking half the seats at every election.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Kilmarnock East and Hurlford was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained all of the former South New Farm Loch ward as well as parts of the former North New Farm Loch and Dean, Kilmarnock Central East, Kilmarnock Central South, Crookedholm, Moscow, Galston West and Hurlford  North and Hurlford wards. Initially, Kilmarnock East and Hurlford included the easternmost part of Kilmarnock including the neighbourhoods of New Farm Loch, Beansburn and Townholm as well as the towns of Hurlford and Crookedholm. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward's western boundary was moved east to run along the B7038 instead of the Kilmarnock Water and Craufurdland Water to take in Dean Castle Country Park.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|John Campbell(SNP)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Jim Buchannan(SNP)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Drew McIntyre(Labour)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Gordon Cree(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2017by-election\n|rowspan=2|Fiona Campbell(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Barry Douglas(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Jon Herd(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Graham Barton(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Neal Ingram(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Graham Boyd(Ind.)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 by-election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
