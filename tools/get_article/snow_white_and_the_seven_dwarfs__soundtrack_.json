The recording has been expanded and reissued numerous times following its original release in January 1938 as ''Songs from Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (with the Same Characters and Sound Effects as in the Film of That Title)''.\nSongs\nSongs not used in the film\nSongs written for the film but not used include two songs for the Dwarfs:\n*\"Music in Your Soup\"  (the accompanying sequence was completely animated, though not inked and painted, before being deleted from the film)\n*\"You're Never Too Old to Be Young\" (replaced by \"The Silly Song\")\nReleases\nOriginal release\nThe soundtrack was first issued as a collection (Victor J-8) of three 78rpm singles. Each of the singles became a Top 10 hit simultaneously in February 1938.\nTrack listing\n*Side 1: \"With a Smile and a Song\" b/w Side 2: \"Dig-a-Dig Dig / Heigh Ho\" (Victor 25735)\n*Side 3: \"I'm Wishing / One Song\" b/w Side 4: \"Whistle While You Work\" (Victor 25736)\n*Side 5: \"Dwarfs' Yodel Song\" b/w Side 6: \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" (Victor 25737)\nOther releases\nSource:\n1980s releases\n1980 - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Picture Disc LP\nDisneyland Records 3101\nSide One\n1. Overture\nI'm Wishing—Snow White\nOne Song—Prince\n2. With a Smile and a Song—Snow White\n3. Whistle While You Work—Snow White\n4. Heigh Ho—Dwarfs\nSide Two\n1. Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum—Dwarfs\n2. A Silly Song—Dwarfs\n3. Some Day My Prince Will Come—Snow White\n4. Finale\nThe first ever Snow White compact disc was officially released by Disney in 1987. The recording (first issued on LP record in 1980) was a combination of the film's soundtrack intertwined with the story narrated by Hal Smith.\nThe first CD to contain just the soundtrack (without additional narration) was a 1988 disc issued by BMG (RCA). It included the same recordings found on the original Victor 1938 shellac records but with the previously deleted lyrics from the \"Dwarfs' Yodel Song\".\n1993 reissue\nOn June 8, 1993, about three weeks before the final North American theatrical release of the film, a digitally remastered soundtrack appeared in stores. In addition to the normal songs and musical orchestration, the album also included the two deleted numbers: \"Music In Your Soup\" and \"You're Never Too Old to Be Young\". In the liner notes, dated January 1993, album producers Randy Thornton and Michael Leon shared how the digital restoration was pieced together from seven different original sources. Also included are the lyrics for each song as well as a chart showing what each of the four composers/songwriters (Frank Churchill, Larry Morey, Leigh Harline, and Paul J. Smith) contributed to the final soundtrack.\nThe 1993 CD was also sold in the Soundtrack Collector's Series. A separate cassette tape was available, too.\n1997 reissue\nIn 1997, the album was released as part of the Classic Soundtrack Series. The CD came shrink-wrapped with a round sticker placed on the outside that read, \"Digitally Remastered—Includes lyrics and artwork\". The insert booklet contained different artwork from the 1993 version but the same song lyrics. The liner notes, dated December 15, 1997, were nearly identical except for an update from producer Randy Thornton: He revealed that seven seconds of music had been omitted from the 1993 edition of \"Love's First Kiss (Finale)\" and were now included in this new disc.\n2001 digital remaster\nOn September 25, 2001, shortly before the film premiered on DVD, the digitally remastered CD was again released in the United States. Like in the previous CDs, the lyrics for each song were included with the insert booklet and there were identical liner notes, but the artwork was changed.\n2006 digital remaster and current release\nOn August 28, 2006, Walt Disney Records released what is now the current soundtrack for the classic film. Some tweaks to song titles and timings have since occurred in the digital releases.\n2006 Track Listing\n# \"Overture\"\n# \"Magic Mirror\"\n# \"I'm Wishing/One Song\"\n# \"Queen Theme\"\n# \"Far into the Forest\"\n# \"Animal Friends/ With a Smile and a Song\"\n# \"Just Like a Doll's House\"\n# \"Whistle While You Work\"\n# \"Heigh-Ho\"\n# \"Let's See What's Upstairs\"\n# \"There's Trouble a-Brewin'\"\n# \"It's a Girl\"\n# \"Hooray!
