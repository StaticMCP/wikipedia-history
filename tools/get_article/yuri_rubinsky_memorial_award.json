Yuri Rubinsky, in cooperation with the International WWW Conference Committee (iW3C2), presented the SoftQuad Award for Excellence to Doug Engelbart at the Fourth International WWW Conference in Boston in December, 1995. Following his death in January 1996, the Yuri Rubinsky Insight Foundation took up the award.
