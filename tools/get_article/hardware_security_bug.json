Such vulnerabilities are considered \"catastrophic\" by security analysts.\nSpeculative execution vulnerabilities\nStarting in 2017, a series of security vulnerabilities were found in the implementations of speculative execution on common processor architectures which effectively enabled an elevation of privileges.\nThese include:\n* Foreshadow\n* Meltdown\n* Microarchitectural Data Sampling\n* Spectre\n* SPOILER\n* Pacman\nIntel VISA\nIn 2019 researchers discovered that a manufacturer debugging mode, known as VISA, had an undocumented feature on Intel Platform Controller Hubs, which are the chipsets included on most Intel-based motherboards and which have direct memory access, which made the mode accessible with a normal motherboard possibly leading to a security vulnerability.\nSee also\n* Hardware security\n* Security bug\n* Computer security\n* Threat (computer)\nReferences\ncategory:Computer security exploits\ncategory:Hardware bugs\ncategory:Side-channel attacks"
