Eastern Washington won the first rivalry match between the two schools in 2010 with a score of 55–17. The purpose of the Dam Cup is to create a rivalry between Portland State University and Eastern Washington University and provide a sense of pride between alumni in the Portland, OR and Spokane, WA areas. Other goals include increasing attendance at events between both schools and building school spirit among each institutions' student body.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|-\n| Portland State Vikings || The Dam Cup || Dam Cup || 43 || align=center | 1986‡ || 2023, Won 47–35 || 21 || 21 || 1 ||\n|}\n‡ The Dam Cup rivalry with Portland State was officially established in 2010, but both teams have played against each other since the date listed above.\nMontana\n'''Dot's Pretzels Bowl'''\nThe Viks and the  Montana Grizzlies have played each other 46 times since the 1965 football season. Coach Bruce Barnum  and Griz coach Bobby Hauck have a friendly rivalry based in part on Hershey-owned Dot's Homestyle Pretzels. The 46 matchups are the most games Portland State has played anyone. Montana is one of Portland State's two protected Big Sky Conference rivalries (along with Northern Colorado) when the conference shifted to one division in 2022, meaning they will play every year. The University of Montana leads the all-time series 35–13 as of 2024.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|-\n| Portland State Vikings || Dot's Pretzel Bowl ||  || 48 || align=\"center\" | 1965 || 2024, Lost 28–17 || 13 || 35 || 0 ||\n|}\nIdaho State\nThe Viks and Idaho State Bengals have played each other 45 times since 1965.
