He is best known for his work at the DC Comics imprint Vertigo and the 2012–16 Irish novel series Zom-B.\nBiography\nWarren, with his brother Gary Pleece, wrote and drew three issues of a self-published comics magazine called Velocity between 1987 and 1989.  A satirical collection of stories, there were no recurring characters, but many recognisable caricatures from politics and pop culture. The fourth issue was published by Acme Press in 1990. Their first non-self-published work appeared in Escape magazine.\nWarren Pleece also collaborated with Woodrow Phoenix on Sinister Romance, a comic published by Harrier Comics. He then collaborated with Irish writer Garth Ennis on the strip True Faith, serialised in Crisis and eventually published as a trade paperback. True Faith sparked some controversy in the UK with an article in the Daily Mail due to its story being critical about Christianity.\nPleece contributed Second City Blues to the comic 2000 AD, which was a series set in a futuristic Birmingham, with teams playing a deadly sport similar to the one portrayed in the film Rollerball.\nPleece has since worked professionally mainly for DC Comics.  He began with a four-issue Vertigo series featuring the Tattooed Man and has since contributed to the Hellblazer series, The Invisibles with Grant Morrison, and Kinetic by Kelley Puckett.\nBibliography\nComics\n* \"Comics Are Really Great\" (with Gary Pleece, in A1 #2, 1989)\n* \"Leone Ryder\" (with Gary Pleece, in A1 #3, 1990)\n* \"The Numbers Game\" (with Gary Pleece, in Revolver: The Horror Special, 1990)\n*True Faith (with Garth Ennis, in Crisis #29–34 & #34–38, 1989–1990)\n*Skin Graft: The Adventures of a Tattooed Man (with Jerry Prosser, 4-issue mini-series, Vertigo, 1993)\n*Sandman Mystery Theatre #33–36 (with Steven T.
