The text-only game is based on the Indiana Jones franchise.\nGameplay\nIndiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients is a text adventure game that is not based on any of the films. The eponymous character travels to the Mexican jungle to explore the Tepotzteco Pyramid, with the purpose of getting the Mazatec Power Key before the Nazi forces, under the command of Plebinheim, get to it first.\nReception\nIn 2008, IGN ranked the game at number nine on its list of \"Top 10 Indiana Jones Games\", writing, \"While not as clever as the Zork series, Revenge of the Ancients tells a good yarn that fits nicely in the Indy oeuvre.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mobygames.com/game/indiana-jones-in-revenge-of-the-ancients Information at MobyGames]\n*"
