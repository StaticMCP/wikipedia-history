The nations involved fielded a plethora of code and cipher systems, many of the latter using rotor machines. As a result, the theoretical and practical aspects of cryptanalysis, or codebreaking, were much advanced.\nPossibly the most important codebreaking event of the war was the successful decryption by the Allies of the German \"Enigma\" Cipher.  The first break into Enigma was accomplished by Polish Cipher Bureau around 1932; the techniques and insights used were passed to the French and British Allies just before the outbreak of the war in 1939. They were substantially improved by British efforts at Bletchley Park during the war. Decryption of the Enigma Cipher allowed the Allies to read important parts of German radio traffic on important networks and was an invaluable source of military intelligence throughout the war. Intelligence from this source and other high level sources, such as  Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, was eventually called Ultra.\nA similar break into the most secure Japanese diplomatic cipher, designated Purple by the US Army Signals Intelligence Service, started before the US entered the war. Product from this source was called Magic.\nOn the other side, German code breaking in World War II achieved some notable successes cracking British naval and other ciphers.\nAustralia\n* Central Bureau\n* FRUMEL: Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne\n* Secret Intelligence Australia\nFinland\n* Finnish Defence Intelligence Agency\nFrance\n* PC Bruno\n* Hans-Thilo Schmidt\nGermany\n* Enigma machine\n* Fish (cryptography) British codename for German teleprinter ciphers\n** Lorenz cipher a Fish cipher codenamed Tunny by the British\n** Siemens and Halske T52 Geheimfernschreiber, a Fish cipher codenamed Sturgeon by the British\n* Short Weather Cipher\n* B-Dienst\n* Reservehandverfahren\n* OKW/CHI\n* Gisbert Hasenjaeger\nItaly\n* Hagelin machine\n* Enigma machine\nJapan\n* Japanese army and diplomatic codes\n* Japanese naval codes\n* PURPLE\n* JN-25\nPoland\n* Cryptanalysis of the Enigma\n* Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau)\n* Marian Rejewski\n* Jerzy Różycki\n* Henryk Zygalski\n* bomba\n*  Lacida Machine\nSoviet Union\n* 5th Department of NKVD (1941-1943), 5th Department of NKGB (1943-1945)\n** Lieutenant general Ivan Shevelyov, the head of the department\n* 8th Department of Red Army General Staff\n** Lieutenant general Piotr Belyusov, the head of the department\nSweden\n* Arne Beurling\nUnited Kingdom\n* Bletchley Park\n* Cryptanalysis of the Enigma\n* Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher\n* Far East Combined Bureau (FECB)\n* Naval Intelligence Division (NID)\n* Wireless Experimental Centre (WEC)\n* Bombe\n* Colossus computer\n* Typex\n* SYKO\n* Ultra\n* Alan Turing\n* W.
