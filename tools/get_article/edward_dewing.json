He was educated at Harrow School, before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Cambridge University against Cambridge Town Club at Parker's Piece. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge University until 1845, making eleven appearances. He first played for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in first-class matches in 1843, maintaining an association with the club until 1848. He made nineteen appearances for the MCC, scoring 223 runs at an average of 6.96 and a high score of 36. In addition to playing for Cambridge University and the MCC, Dewing also made first-class appearances for Gentlemen of England on five occasions, as well as appearing once each for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture of 1845, for England and for a Single XI in the Married v Single match of 1844. He was a founding member of I Zingari in 1845, alongside John Loraine Baldwin, the Hon. Frederick Ponsonby (later 6th Earl of Bessborough), the Hon. Spencer Ponsonby (later Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane) and Richard Penruddocke Long, who were dining at the Blenheim Hotel in London's Bond Street after a match against Harrow School.\nAfter graduating from Cambridge, he was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1847, but was never called to the bar. He served in the Suffolk Rifle Volunteers as a lieutenant from 1863&ndash;66. He later served as a justice of the peace for Suffolk and was considered to by an authority on East Anglian antiquities. He published three articles in the Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute for Archaeology and Natural History.\nDewing died in October 1899 at Nowton, Suffolk. His son, Robert, also played first-class cricket.\nWorks\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
