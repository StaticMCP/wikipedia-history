The rank given refers to that held until 1814. The list includes foreign nationals who fought in French military units.\nOverview\nNapoleon had intended the campaign on the Peninsula to be a walkover, but what he would come to call the Spanish Ulcer, ended up with him having had to send in thirteen of his maréchals (ten of whom were of the first promotion – of fourteen – and included Soult, one of only six men to have been appointed Marshal General of France in the history of France), as well as two \"honorary\" marshals, Kellermann and Lefebvre, and enter Madrid himself. Apart from the original 28,000 troops that had entered Spain under Junot, heading for Portugal, Napoleon would have to send in a further two hundred and seventy thousand men — more than half of the empire's total military strength.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
