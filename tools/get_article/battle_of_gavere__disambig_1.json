The battle ended the Revolt of Ghent with a Burgundian victory.\nBackground\nGhent was the richest, most populous, and powerful city in the Burgundian Netherlands. The battle was a consequence of Ghent's opposition against a new salt tax. When the city openly declared its rebellion, the Duke assembled an army}} from neighbouring lands, including southern Flanders, and attacked three fortifications; Schendelbeke, Poeke, and Gavere.\nSchendelbeke and Poeke were both taken with little effort and both garrisons were executed. The Burgundian army began its bombardment of Gavere on 18 July. The Ghentenaar relief army arrived on 23 July, not knowing the fort had fallen the day before. Philip, aware of the approach of the Ghentenaar army, drew up his army into battle lines. Finding Philip's army battle ready, the Ghentenaar army formed up.\nBattle\nThe battle began with an artillery exchange, a first for the Burgundian army, and due to the superior range of the Ghentenaar artillery, Philip was forced to move his cannons closer to the enemy. Once in range, the Burgundian artillery began to weaken Ghentenaar morale, and numerous Ghentenaar soldiers fled. A Ghentenaar contemporary source claims a spark ignited an open sack of gunpowder causing an explosion which caused the Ghent cannoners to rout.\nSeeing the enemy flee, the Burgundian army charged. Some Ghent soldiers regrouped to counter the charge, but their efforts were useless and casualties were high.\nAfterwards\nIt was feared the Duke would destroy the city completely, but when asked to show mercy he is said to have replied \"If I should destroy this city, who is going to build me one like it?\"\nThe battle broke the power of Ghent only temporarily, as in 1539 there would be another revolt against the high taxes under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (see Revolt of Ghent (1539)).\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n* Charles Terlinden, Histoire militaire des Belges, Brussels, La Renaissance du Livre, 1931.\nSee also\n* Loys of Gruuthuse\n* Revolt of Ghent\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620074359/http://www.gavere.be/geschiedenis/slagbijgavere.htm History of the Battle of Gavere]"
