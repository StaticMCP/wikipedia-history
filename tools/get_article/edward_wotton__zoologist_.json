Wotton was also partly responsible for [https://web.archive.org/web/20070426064644/http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/cache/toc/D254938.html Insectorum, sive, Minimorum animalium theatrum] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20060825154523/http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/moffett.html Theatre of Insects], although this was not published (as edited by Thomas Muffet) until 1634.\nBy favour of bishop Fox, he was made socius compar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, with leave to travel into Italy for three years. He attended Padua, applied himself to physic, and took the degree of doctor. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians 8 February 1528. He does not appear, as often stated, to have been physician to Henry VIII, but did serve the Duke of Norfolk and Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury. He was a fellow censor with Alban Hill in 1555.\nReferences\nExternal links"
