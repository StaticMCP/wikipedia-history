The rank can also be held by Royal Marines officers in tri-service posts, for example, Generals Sir Gordon Messenger and Sir Gwyn Jenkins, former Vice-Chiefs of the Defence Staff. It ranks above lieutenant-general and, in the Army, is subordinate to the rank of field marshal, which is now only awarded as an honorary rank.  The rank of general has a NATO-code of OF-9, and is a four-star rank.  It is equivalent to a full admiral in the Royal Navy or an air chief marshal in the Royal Air Force.\nOfficers holding the ranks of general, lieutenant-general and major-general are 'general officers' and may be addressed as 'general'.\nInsignia\nA general officer's insignia is a crossed sword and baton. This appeared on its own for the now obsolete rank of brigadier-general. A major-general has a pip over this emblem; a lieutenant-general a crown instead of a pip; and a full general both a pip and a crown.  The insignia for the highest rank, that of Field Marshal, consists of crossed batons within a wreath and surmounted by a crown.\nSee also\n}}\n*British and U.S. military ranks compared\n*British Army Other Ranks rank insignia\n*British Army officer rank insignia\n*List of British Army full generals\n*List of Royal Marines full generals\n*List of British generals and brigadiers\nReferences"
