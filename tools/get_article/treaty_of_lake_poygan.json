It was negotiated on October 18, 1848, at Lake Poygan, near Winneconne, Wisconsin.\nMost provisions of the treaty were not carried out, as in 1852 Chief Oshkosh persuaded President Millard Fillmore to permit the tribe to remain on its Wolf River lands in Wisconsin.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611065112/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=810&keyword=Treaty+of+Lake+Poygan Menominee Treaty of 1848] Some 2,500 Menominee had refused to relocate west to Minnesota.[http://www.menominee-nsn.gov/history/1800-1900/chronology.php Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin History 1800-1900 Chronology]  The Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin is federally recognized.\nReferences"
