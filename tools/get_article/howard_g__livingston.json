Livingston (February 19, 1907 – June 1, 1975) was an American politician and Florida lawyer and judge in Highlands County. He served as a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives.\nLife and career\nLivingston was born in Marshall, Texas.  He later moved to Orlando and then Sebring, Florida.\nIn Sebring in 1940 he established what is now the oldest law firm in Highlands County, Florida.  His son, James Livingston, and grandson, Robert Livingston, would go on to practice at the firm, which still operates today.\nLivingston also served as County Judge.
