The prevalence among women has been higher for many years, but is now the same as for men. Around 5% smoke occasionally.\nSweden was the only European country to achieve the WHO goal of less than 20% daily smoking prevalence among adults by year 2000. Sweden has a high level of use of smokeless tobacco, specifically a moist snuff product called 'snus', which some Swedes have used as a replacement for smoking.\nLegislation\nSmoking has been banned in all bars and restaurants since May 2005. A majority of Swedes supported the introduction of the ban. In 2019 the ban was extended to also include outdoor seating in bars and restaurants as well as public places such as playgrounds, bus stops and train stations.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences"
