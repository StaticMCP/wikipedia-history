The aim of scheduling is to preserve the country's most significant sites and monuments as far as possible in the form in which they have been inherited.\nThe process of scheduling is governed by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, which aims \"to make provision for the investigation, preservation and recording of matters of archaeological or historical interest\". The term \"scheduled monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites which have been deliberately constructed by human activity  but are not always visible above ground. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars.\nSome buildings or structures which were both scheduled and listed have had their listing designations removed to reduce the duplication.\nIn 2017 there were 8238 scheduled monuments in Scotland.\nNotable Scheduled Monuments in Glasgow\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n!
