It was fought on 19 January 1885, two days after the Battle of Abu Klea, between the British and the Mahdists. The British force under Brigadier General Sir Herbert Stewart numbered 1,200 while a large number of Mahdists, probably around 13,000–14,000 were in pursuit.\nThe British were moving to rescue General Gordon from Khartoum, and were cutting the Great Bend of the Nile, when they came under attack a short distance from rejoining the Nile.  The British formed a square, and continued moving towards the Nile, repelling all attacks until they reached the river. The British losses were 121, including Stewart, who was mortally wounded in the stomach during the course of the battle and was obliged to turn command over to Colonel Sir Charles Wilson, the intelligence officer of the column. The Mahdist losses are unknown but thought to be considerably higher.\nReferences"
