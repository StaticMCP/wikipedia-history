It is located in the southern part of the city and covers an area of 5.8&nbsp;km2. The population of this ward in 2011 was 16,705 people in 7,464 households. It is one of the five wards that form the Sheffield Heeley parliamentary constituency in the House of Commons. The districts of this ward were in the historic county of Derbyshire, but they have now been absorbed into the metropolitan borough of Sheffield, thus placing them in the ceremonial county of South Yorkshire.\nParks and recreation\nThe ward is named for Graves Park&mdash;a large park between Woodseats and Norton. This 248 acre (1&nbsp;km2) park is the largest in Sheffield, and was presented to the city by J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Graves in 1925.\nDistricts of Graves Park ward\nWoodseats/Norton Woodseats\nHistorically, Norton Woodseats () was a village that straddled Derbyshire Lane running from Four Lane Ends to Bolehill (now part of Graves Park). The name Woodseats comes from the Old English Wodesettes, which means a 'fold in a wood'. Woodseats itself was little more than a cluster of cottages around a road called 'The Dale' close to the intersection of Woodseats Road and Chesterfield Road (A61).\nNorton\nNorton () is a village, now a district of Sheffield. There has been a settlement here since, at least, Saxon times. St James' Church dates from before 1172. The grave of the sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey (7 April 1782 – 25 November 1841)&mdash;who was born in the village&mdash;can be seen just outside the church. Other significant buildings in the area include Norton Hall and Oakes Park. The non-flying RAF station, RAF Norton, was based in the area from 1939 to 1965.\nNorton Lees\nNorton Lees () is a residential suburb located to the east of Woodseats.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
