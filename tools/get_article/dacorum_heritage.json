It collects and records the history of the Borough of Dacorum, Hertfordshire, in the south of England, and aims to encourage the appreciation of the heritage of Dacorum.\nHistory\nIn 1979 the Dacorum Museum Advisory Committee (DMAC) was formed to advise Dacorum District Council on heritage matters. In September 1993 the Dacorum Heritage Trust was founded and set up an artefact collection and archive in an old fire station building behind Berkhamsted Civic Centre in 1994.\nIn 2014, DHT took on responsibility for the paper archive of the local newspaper, the Hemel Hempstead Gazette & Express.  The Trust has also been involved in the preservation of a set of rare pre-reformation religious wall paintings which were uncovered inside a 15th-century cottage at 130–136 Piccotts End. The Trust launched an appeal in 2014 to raise money to buy the row of cottages.\nIn 2017, Dacorum Heritage Trust proposed that The Bury, a Grade II* listed house in Hemel Hempstead, should be converted into a museum and art gallery for Dacorum, to display a collection of archaeological and historical artefacts from the surrounding area. The bid to the National Lottery Heritage Fund in relation to The Bury was unsuccessful and, as of December 2023, Dacorum Heritage Trust was considering a range of options for financing and delivering a new heritage centre.\nCollections\nAlthough the Trust is an Arts Council England Accredited Museum, it lacks a permanent public display space and operates as a museum store. Its collection is held in Berkhamsted and can only be visited by appointment. The museum store holds over 130,000 objects relating to the history of the local towns of Berkhamsted, Bovingdon, Chipperfield, Flamstead, Hemel Hempstead, Kings Langley, Markyate and Tring. Archaeological artefacts held by the Trust include flint tools from the Paleolithic period, fragments from Roman Villas at Boxmoor, Northchurch and Gadebridge Park; a Romano-British woman's skeleton excavated at Cow Roast, and artefacts from Kings Langley Palace. Also within the Trust's holdings is a collection of prints and engravings by the Hemel Hempstead artist Lefevre James Cranstone.\nThe Trust also holds historical exhibitions in local libraries, and publishes journals on local heritage.\nSee also\n*History of Hertfordshire\n*List of lost settlements in Hertfordshire\n*:Category:Listed buildings in Hertfordshire\nReferences"
