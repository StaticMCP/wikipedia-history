Royal Melbourne previously hosted the tournament in 1998, at which the International team had their only victory, and 2011.\nThe United States retained the cup, winning the competition 16–14. Trailing before the final day singles matches, they won six and tied four of the 12 matches.\nTeam qualification and selection\nBoth teams had 12 players. On 18 August 2019, the eight automatic qualifiers for each team were finalized.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Key\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| Top eight on points list\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| Four captain's picks\n|- style=\"background:#c1c1c1;\"\n| Not available, in top 15 of points list\n|-\n| Not picked, in top 15 of points list\n|}\nInternational team\nThe International team featured the top 8 players with the most Official World Golf Ranking points accumulated between 27 August 2018 (Dell Technologies Championship) and 18 August 2019 (BMW Championship) and four captain's picks made in early November. This was a change from 2017 when selection was based on the leading players in the Official World Golf Ranking. The number of captain's picks was also increased from two to four.\nThe final standings were:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Position!!Player!!Points\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 1 || align=left|Marc Leishman || 192.94\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 2 || align=left|Hideki Matsuyama || 187.11\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 3 || align=left|Louis Oosthuizen || 184.68\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 4 || align=left|Adam Scott || 180.30\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 5 || align=left|Abraham Ancer || 160.39\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 6 || align=left|Li Haotong || 128.63\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 7 || align=left|Pan Cheng-tsung || 125.77\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 8 || align=left|Cameron Smith || 124.17\n|- style=\"background:#c1c1c1;\"\n| 9 || align=left|Jason Day|| 120.57\n|-\n| 10 || align=left|Jazz Janewattananond || 113.86\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| 11 || align=left|Im Sung-jae || 112.04\n|-\n| 12 || align=left|Justin Harding || 109.67\n|-\n| 13 || align=left|Corey Conners || 102.34\n|-\n| 14 || align=left|Shugo Imahira || 100.47\n|- style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| 15 || align=left|An Byeong-hun || 97.26\n|}\nUnited States team\nThe United States team featured the 8 players who earned the most official FedExCup points from the 2017 BMW Championship through the 2019 BMW Championship, with points earned in the 2018–19 season counting double, and four captain's picks. Points for events in the FedEx Cup Playoffs were weighted the same as WGC events. The four captain's picks were made in early November. In 2017 only events in the 2017 calendar year counted double. As with the international team the number of captain's picks was increased from two to four.\nThe final standings were:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Position!!Player!!Points\n|- style=\"background:#c1c1c1;\"\n| 1 || align=left|Brooks Koepka || 8,310\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 2 || align=left|Justin Thomas || 6,949\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 3 || align=left|Dustin Johnson || 6,643\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 4 || align=left|Patrick Cantlay || 5,898\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 5 || align=left|Xander Schauffele || 5,753\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 6 || align=left|Webb Simpson || 5,532\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 7 || align=left|Matt Kuchar || 5,520\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| 8 || align=left|Bryson DeChambeau || 5,341\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| 9 || align=left|Tony Finau || 5,152\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| 10 || align=left|Gary Woodland || 4,964\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| 11 || align=left|Rickie Fowler || 4,678\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| 12 || align=left|Patrick Reed || 4,510\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| 13 || align=left|Tiger Woods || 3,905\n|-\n| 14 || align=left|Chez Reavie || 3,810\n|-\n| 15 || align=left|Kevin Kisner || 3,670\n|}\nTeams\nCaptains\nTiger Woods captained the U.S. team, and Ernie Els captained the International team.\nWoods chose Fred Couples, Zach Johnson and Steve Stricker as his assistants.
