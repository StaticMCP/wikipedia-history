Mahmud won decisively, killing Asadullah and 3,000 of his men.\nBackground\nOn the 19th of May 1719, a Persian force numbering about 30,000–35,000 men including an artillery train commanded by European officers advanced on Herat under Safi Quli Khan. Mohammad Zaman Khan, commanding roughly 15,000 Afghan fighters, chose to make his stand at Kafir Qala, a fortified outpost west of Herat near the frontier with Persia. Foreseeing the Persians' reliance on artillery, Asadullah placed his men behind orchard trees and in irrigation ditches to neutralize enemy fire. When the Persians commenced their bombardment, the Afghan positions held firm. As the Persian infantry advanced, they were met by concentrated flanking fire.\nAfter several hours of heavy fighting, a Persian gunner accidentally ignited a powder magazine, and the ensuing explosion engulfed the artillery park in smoke. In the confusion, Persian gunners began firing upon their own troops. Sensing the disarray, Mohammad Zaman Khan ordered a full cavalry charge. The Afghan horsemen swept through the shattered Persian lines, routing the enemy. Safi Quli Khan was slain, and according to contemporary accounts, the Persian general, realizing the battle was lost, mounted a barrel of gunpowder and blew himself up rather than be captured.\nBattle\nAsadullah Khan then set out for the Helmand and in August 1720. Asadullah Khan, leader of the Abdali Afghans attacked the fort of Farah from the Hotaks. Mahmud Hotak hearing this, gathered his men from Kandahar and met the rebel at Dilārām near Farah, The outcome of the battle remained in the balance for many hours until Asad Allah was shot in the back by a man who was settling an old score with Sultan Abdallah Khan’s family. in western Afghanistan. The battle was on favour of Mahmud Hotak and Asadullah was defeated and killed, along with 3,000 of his men.\nAftermath\nMahmud sent the head of Asadullah Khan and some of the Abdalis to Soltan Hosein as a gesture of loyalty. Shah Soltan Hosein, showing his usual simplicity and wishful thinking, accepted this ruse at face value. Mahmud Hotak would later launch an invasion of Persia. The campaign targeted the city of Kerman, a strategically vital urban center in southeastern Safavid Iran. Mahmud Hotak's forces besieged and eventually captured the city, subsequently sacking it.\nReferences"
