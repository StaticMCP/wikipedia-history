      "text": "# Grave Empire\n\nGrave Empire is a 2025 fantasy novel by Richard Swan. It is set 200 years after the Empire of the Wolf trilogy.\nReception\nThe novel received positive reviews from critics. It received a starred review from Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews. Publishers Weekly wrote that \"The worldbuilding is lush, enhanced by Swan’s rich descriptive prose, and the characters are complex. Readers won’t need to be familiar with the earlier series to be drawn in—and this promising start will leave them eager for more.\" Kirkus Reviews wrote that \"Swan actually succeeds in making his continuation seem organic, as the bittersweet ending to the first trilogy, added to his obvious acknowledgment both of real-life history’s cyclical nature and humanity’s collective tendency to forget the useful lessons of the past, make this reset seem plausible and not a mere retread of what came before.\"\nGrimdark Magazine included the book in its list of the best fantasy novels of 2025.\nReferences"
