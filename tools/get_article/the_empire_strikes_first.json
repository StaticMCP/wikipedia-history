The album is heavily influenced by the then-current Iraq War (most notably in the songs \"Atheist Peace\", \"Let Them Eat War\" and the title track) and also has some nods to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (the song title \"Boot Stamping on a Human Face Forever\" as well as the line \"you deserve Two Minute Hate\" in the title track are direct references to the book), the latter most likely inspired by the Patriot Act.\nThe album also marks the rare instance that non-members of Bad Religion received a writing credit, as Chris Wollard of Hot Water Music co-wrote two songs.\nThe song \"Social Suicide\" appears in the video games ''Tony Hawk's Project 8 and MX vs. ATV Untamed.\nRelease\nOn February 4, 2004, The Empire Strikes First'' was announced for release in a few months' time.
