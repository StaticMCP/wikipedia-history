Tunnell\n| before_party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| after_election = John Hunn\n| after_party = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 1900 Delaware gubernatorial election was held on November 6, 1900. Though Governor Ebe W. Tunnell was eligible for re-election under the newly adopted 1897 constitution, the state convention ended up nominating Peter J. Ford, a prominent businessman.\nOn the Republican side, the split from four years earlier threatened to divide the party once again. The Addicks and anti-Addicks Republicans nominated separate candidates for Governor. The anti-Addicks (or \"Regular Republicans\") nominated attorney Martin B. Burris, while the Addicks (or \"Union Republicans\") nominated Dr. George W. Marshall. Both factions, however, nominated John Hunn for Lieutenant Governor.\nThough initial negotiations between the factions failed to produce a reconciliation, a tentative agreement developed to form a joint ticket, adopting Hunn as a compromise for Governor splitting nominations for statewide offices between the two factions. Ultimately, the parties came to an agreement, and a joint ticket was nominated for the general election.\nIn the general election, Hunn ended up defeating Ford by a decisive margin, reclaiming the governorship for the Republican Party. Republicans would hold onto the office until 1936.\nGeneral election\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Delaware Senate Journal, 88th General Assembly, 1st Reg. Sess. (1901)."
