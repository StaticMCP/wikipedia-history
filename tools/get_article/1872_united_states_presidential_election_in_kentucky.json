Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nKentucky voted for the Liberal Republican candidate, Horace Greeley, over Republican candidate, Ulysses S. Grant. Greeley won Kentucky by a margin of 5.88%. However, Greeley died prior to the Electoral College meeting, meaning for Kentucky's 12 electors could vote for the candidate of their choice: eight voted for Indiana Senator Thomas Hendricks, while four voted for Greeley's running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown.\nThis is the last time a Republican won two terms without ever carrying the state.\nResults\n}}\n|evprct     = 0.00%\n}}\nFootnotes\nReferences"
