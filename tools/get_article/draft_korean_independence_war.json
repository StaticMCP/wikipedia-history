The Independence efforts ultimately culminated in the Cairo Declaration, in which the Allied powers declared that \"Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed. The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.\"\nBackground\nThe Korean Independence War was ignited by Japan’s systematic encroachment on Korean sovereignty in the early 20th century. It began with Japan undermining Korea’s economy and stripping away its diplomatic rights, followed by the imposition of the Eulsa Treaty in 1905, which turned the Korean Empire into a protectorate. Japan then dismantled Korea’s military and completed its colonial domination with the annexation of Korea in 1910.  In response, patriotic Korean fighters formed the Righteous Armies (의병), irregular militias that waged guerrilla warfare against Japanese troops and colonial police. Despite early resistance, most of these forces were suppressed or disbanded by 1913 under the weight of Japanese military pressure. Meanwhile, Korean immigrants in Hawaii, having fled the occupation, sought to continue the struggle from abroad by establishing the Korean National Army Corps. Their goal was to raise an army of 2,000 to 3,000 men to liberate the homeland.  However, the movement was ultimately dissolved in 1917 due to diplomatic pressure from both Japanese and American authorities.\nRighteous Wars\nThe Righteous Wars, or Righteous Army Uprisings, were a determined effort by Korean civilians to resist Japan’s gradual colonization of Korea. As the royal government proved unwilling, or unable, to confront foreign encroachment, civilian militias known as the Righteous Armies (의병) rose up, continuing a centuries-old tradition of popular resistance that had defended Korea against Mongol invasions, Japanese naval attacks, and Qing conquest. The immediate catalyst was the Donghak Peasant Rebellion of 1894, where hundreds of thousands of peasants demanded social reform, the abolition of slavery, and a return to Confucian principles. Though crushed, the movement influenced the adoption of the Gabo Reforms. As Japanese forces tightened their grip, the Righteous Armies launched fierce resistance, including the Battle of Namdaemun and over a hundred local engagements. While ultimately unsuccessful in halting annexation, their struggle marked the beginning of Korea’s modern armed independence movement and proved that resistance, even in defeat, could inspire future generations.\nMarch First Movement and the Establishment of the Independence Armies\nThe March First Movement was a vital action that inspired Koreans to take arms against the Japanese. Over 2 million Koreans went out in the streets to protest the Japanese occupation. The Japanese did not respond kindly as they decided to squash the protests with the Imperial Army. Around 7,000 Koreans died by the hands of the Japanese Army and nearly 47,000 arrested. The Korean people were outraged. They raised multiple armies, including the Korean Independence Army, the Korean Independence Corps, and later the Joseon Revolutionary Army and the Korean Liberation Army. These armies were the foundation to the military push to liberate Korea.\nThe First battles of the Independence Armies\nThe Independence Armies were based in Southern Manchuria in the Gando region.  They had allegedly attacked the Japanese in the Hunchun Incident, in which 13 Japanese people were killed at the Japanese Consulate in Manchuria. The Japanese Army used this as an excuse to attack the Korean Independence Armies in Manchuria. The Japanese Government asked the Republic of China and the governor of Jilin if they could attack these Korean \"Bandits\". The governor of Jilin accepted, as he was in no state to oppose the Japanese.  The Japanese poured thousands of troops into Manchuria to demolish the K.I.A.\nThe Battles of Samdunja, Fengwudong, and Cheongsan-ri\nThe Battle of Samdunja, fought in June 1920, marked the first major confrontation between the newly formed Korean Independence Army and the Japanese Imperial forces. Led by General Hong Beom-do, a former hunter turned legendary commander, the Korean forces—outnumbered, outgunned, and operating in exile, executed a daring ambush against Japanese troops and colonial police who had crossed into Manchuria. Though militarily limited in scale, the engagement resulted in a decisive Korean victory: sixty Japanese casualties against only two Korean losses. More than a tactical success, it was a psychological turning point, it proved that the Japanese were not invincible, and that disciplined resistance could yield victory.\nThe Battle of Fengwudong, also called the Battle of Bongo-dong, took place in June 1920 in Manchuria. Korean commanders Hong Beom-do and Choi Jin-dong led approximately 1,500 independence fighters who concealed themselves in the forested Bongo-dong Valley to ambush advancing Japanese forces. When roughly 500 Japanese troops entered the area, they were met with a coordinated assault that resulted in around 157 Japanese deaths and over 300 wounded. Korean casualties were minimal, with just two dead and four wounded. The engagement was a clear tactical success and became a foundational moment in Korea’s guerrilla warfare strategy during the independence movement.\nIn the fall of 1920, following Japanese setbacks in Manchuria, Japan dispatched 30,000 troops to eliminate Korean resistance forces. In response, about 3,000 Korean fighters mainly from the Independence Army and the Northern Military Administration Office retreated into the Cheongsan-ri region. Throughout early October, a series of mobile engagements unfolded as Korean forces used guerrilla tactics and the natural terrain to ambush Japanese units. Official Japanese reports claimed minimal casualties, but Korean sources estimate between 1,000 to 5,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, while Korean losses totaled around 60 dead and 90 wounded. The Battle of Cheongsan-ri is regarded as a key military achievement in Korea’s independence struggle and elevated leaders like Hong Beom-do and Kim Chwa-jin to national prominence. Although Korean forces later retreated into Soviet territory, the battle demonstrated their resilience and strategic capability against a modern imperial power.\nFree City Incident\nIn 1921, after several successful campaigns in Manchuria, the Korean Independence Army moved into Soviet-controlled territory, seeking refuge in Free City (자유시) near the Russo-Chinese border. However, Soviet authorities, concerned about relations with Japan and skeptical of Korea’s independence efforts, demanded the disarmament of Korean fighters. When the Koreans refused, conflict broke out. The Soviet Red Army, with support from pro-Soviet Korean factions, attacked the camp, resulting in nearly 1,000 Koreans being killed, wounded, or captured. This event, known as the Free City Incident, marked a major setback for the Korean independence movement, as one of its key armed forces was dismantled not by Japan, but by a former ally.\nSecond Movement and formation of New Independence Armies\nThe New Independence Armies emerged in 1929 after the Gwangju Student Independence Movement. The most notable one of these armies was the reformed Korean Independence Army of 1929. Alongside the Korean Revolutionary Army, these forces forged a vital alliance with Chinese Anti-Japanese militias to resist Imperial Japan. This united front launched a series of determined campaigns, many of them victorious, across Manchuria and northern Korea. The Korean Revolutionary Army, with its Chinese allies, engaged Japanese forces in key battles at Ssangseong Fortress, Yonglinga, Sadohaja, Donggyeongseong, Daejeonjaryeong, Heunggyeongseong, Nogudae, Tonghwa-hyeon, Pochonbo, Hujiazhuang, Mount Taihang, and Jinseobei.\nBackground of the Second Independence Movement\nThe Korean Revolutionary Army, the Korean Volunteer Army, the Korean Independence Army of 1929, and the Chinese \"Tiger Army\" all united into a singular United force after the Manchurian Incident of 1931. This United Army would fight the Japanese Imperial Army at key engagements like the Battle of Ssangseongbo and the Battle of Daejeonjaryeong.\nSsangseong Fortress, Sadohaja, and Yonglinga\nThe Battle of Yonglinga was the first battle in the Second Korean Independence War. (March 11-12) It was also the first time the Korean Independence Army and its Chinese allies fought the JIA. The United Army was untested and untrained. Even with most of the army unexperienced, the United Army planned to ambush a Japanese company of about 175 soldiers to capture Cheongeumchae, a strategically crucial area near the Japanese fortress of Sinbinhyeonhyeong. However, Japanese troops found their encampment and decided to attack the United Army. They launched a surprise attack using mortars and machine guns. However, the Revolutionary Army used their knowledge of the terrain to quickly recapture the high ground within an hour. The Japanese were forced to retreat, losing several dozen to 100 men. The K.R.A and the Chinese Volunteer Army suffered less then 20 killed and wounded.\nThe success at the Battle of Yonglinga gave the united army more confidence in their ability to stand up and fight the Japanese Imperial Army. The Korean Revolutionary Army decided to ambush the Japanese Army. In the Battle of Sadohaja, around 1,500 Korean Revolutionary Army troops supplied by the Chinese \"Tiger Army\" ambushed about 700 Japanese troops. The Koreans used a flare to signal the 2-pronged ambush of the Japanese forces on. The Japanese detachment was devastated, with heavy casualties. (exact casualties are unknown) The Koreans suffered little in the battle, casualties for the Independence Army likely not exceeding 100. The exact day of the battle is unknown, but the engagement occurred sometime in 1933.\nSsangseong Fortress (also known as Ssangseongbo) was the largest battle in the Second Korean Independence War. It saw 3,000 Korean Independence Army soldiers and over 25,000 Chinese troops fight against 3 brigades of the Manchukuo Imperial Army. In September of 1932, the Korean Revolutionary Army, led by General Ji Cheongcheon, alongside their Chinese allies, charged at the Japanese Army from multiple directions. They seized Ssangseong Fortress and captured provisions that could feed their army of nearly 30,000 for 3 months. However, the Japanese Imperial Army struck back. They attacked in November of 1932. The Japanese recaptured the Fortress, just to lose it again due to a nighttime Korean Chinese counterattack. After many days of fighting, the Japanese finally recaptured the fort. Although only a half-victory for the united armies, it showed the unity between the anti-Japanese armies. In addition, the allies captured large numbers of Japanese soldiers in the first battle.\nBattle of Heunggyeongseong, Nogudae, and Daejeonjaryeong\nThe Battle of Huenggyeongseong was another key engagement between the Korean Revolutionary Army and the Imperial Japanese and Manchukuo Armies.\nThe Battle of Daejeonjaryeong, fought in July 1933, is considered the second most important victory of the Korean Independence Armies, after the Battle of Cheongsan-ri. In this clash, about 4,500 Korean and Chinese troops spotted a Japanese–Manchukuo supply battalion of roughly 900 soldiers moving through a mountain pass. The Japanese troops were carrying mortars, machine guns, cannons, rifles, 200 wagons of military equipment, and military uniforms. Instead of confronting them directly, the allied forces took positions in the hills and forests surrounding a nearby lake, waiting for the right moment to strike. Once the Japanese began crossing the waterway, the United Forces launched their attack. Surrounded and outnumbered, the imperial troops tried to escape but suffered heavy losses. This victory boosted the morale of the Korean resistance and further pressured Japan’s hold over the region. In total, the Imperial Armies (JIA and the Manchukuo Imperial Army) suffered about 800 casualties in the confrontation while the United Army suffered only around 50 killed and wounded. The United Army also captured the mortars, machine guns, and the uniforms the Japanese were carrying. They captured 3,000 Japanese uniforms, 3 cannons, 10 mortars, 1,500 rifles, and all 200 of the supply wagons.\nReferences"
