This can be used to extend the notions of linear or algebraic independence to stable theories. These concepts were introduced by S. Shelah.\nDefinitions\nSuppose that A and B are models of some complete ω-stable theory T. If p is a type of A and q is a type of B containing p, then q is called a forking extension of p if its Morley rank is smaller, and a nonforking extension if it has the same Morley rank.\nAxioms\nLet T be a stable complete theory. The non-forking relation ≤ for types over T is the unique relation that satisfies the following axioms:\n#If p≤q then p⊂q. If f is an elementary map then p≤q if and only if fp≤fq\n#If p⊂q⊂r then p≤r if and only if p≤q and q≤r\n#If p is a type of A and A⊂B then there is some type q of B with p≤q.\n#There is a cardinal κ such that if p is a type of A then there is a subset A0 of A of cardinality less than κ so that (p|A0) ≤ p, where | stands for restriction.\n#For any p there is a cardinal λ such that there are at most λ non-contradictory types q with p≤q.\nUnicode\n*\n*\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
