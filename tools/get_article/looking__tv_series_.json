It was created by Michael Lannan, with Lannan, Andrew Haigh, David Marshall Grant, and Sarah Condon serving as executive producers. The show stars Jonathan Groff, Frankie J. Alvarez, Murray Bartlett, Lauren Weedman, Russell Tovey, and Raúl Castillo. It centers on the lives of Patrick, Agustín, and Dom—three gay men living and working in modern-day San Francisco. Looking marked HBO's first television series focused primarily on the lives of gay men.\nThe series received critical acclaim for its writing, direction, and performances, as well as for its grounded, nuanced portrayal of LGBTQ life. Ten of the show's eighteen episodes were directed by Andrew Haigh, whose naturalistic filmmaking style drew comparisons to his 2011 film Weekend and to the mumblecore movement in independent cinema.\nDespite strong critical reception, the series struggled with viewership. The second-season finale drew just 298,000 viewers, which led HBO to cancel the series after two seasons. To provide closure, the network commissioned a feature-length television film, Looking: The Movie, which premiered at the Frameline Film Festival on June 26, 2016, and later aired on HBO on July 23, 2016.\nIn retrospective rankings, Looking has been recognized for its cultural impact and storytelling. In 2019, The Guardian included the series in its list of the \"100 Greatest TV Shows of the 21st Century\". In 2022, Esquire ranked it #21 in its list of \"The Best HBO Series of All Time\".\nPremise\nSet in contemporary San Francisco, Looking follows the lives of three close friends as they navigate relationships, careers, and personal growth in the city's vibrant LGBTQ community.\nPatrick Murray, a 29-year-old video game designer, lives with his friends Dom and Agustín. Patrick is well-meaning but often naïve, and has had limited success in his romantic life. His circumstances begin to shift when he meets Richie, a charming and grounded barber from the Mission District, and is simultaneously drawn to his new boss, Kevin, who is attractive but in a committed relationship.\nDom, an aspiring restaurateur, works to realize his dream of opening his own establishment. With support from his loyal roommate, Doris, and the unexpected guidance of Lynn, a successful older entrepreneur, Dom begins taking steps toward professional independence.\nAgustín, who works as an artist's assistant, struggles with the stability of his relationship with his long-term boyfriend Frank, his creative stagnation, and his growing reliance on recreational drugs.\nThe series explores the interconnected lives of the three men as they confront questions of love, ambition, friendship, and identity in a rapidly evolving urban landscape.\nCast and characters\nMain\n* Jonathan Groff as Patrick Murray, a 29-year-old video game designer who grew up in suburban Denver in a rather conservative family who initially had a hard time accepting his sexuality when he came out to them on Thanksgiving back in 2005 while in his second year of college.\n* Frankie J.

The pilot episode was written by series creator Michael Lannan, based on his 2011 short film Lorimer, and directed by Andrew Haigh. Principal photography for the first season began in the San Francisco Bay Area on September 16, 2013, and concluded on November 7, 2013. The series premiered on January 19, 2014.\nIn February 2014, Lannan confirmed that the writers were already exploring ideas for a potential second season. This was supported by Nick Hall, HBO's director of comedy, who noted that the network was not focused solely on initial live viewership, emphasizing that total audience metrics—including On Demand and HBO Go—were also considered indicators of performance.\nOn February 26, 2014, HBO officially renewed Looking for a second season. The second season premiered on January 11, 2015.\nDespite critical acclaim, the series was canceled following its second season due to declining ratings. In response, fans launched an online petition advocating for the continuation of the show. HBO later confirmed that a feature-length film would be produced to provide closure to the series. Cast member Raúl Castillo revealed in an interview with Vulture that filming for the film was scheduled to begin in September 2015 and that the runtime would be approximately two hours. The film premiered on June 2, 2016, at the Frameline Film Festival in San Francisco and was subsequently broadcast on HBO on July 23, 2016.\nEpisodes\nList of Looking episodes}}\nReception\nCritical response\nLooking received critical acclaim throughout its run, with praise directed at its nuanced portrayal of gay life and the performances of its cast. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 90% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Funny without being obnoxious, Looking provides authentic situations that feel universal with its subtle details and top-notch performances.\" On Metacritic, the first season has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nThe second season received similarly positive reviews, earning a 77/100 score on Metacritic and an 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nEarly comparisons of the series by both critics and audiences likened it to Girls and Sex and the City due to its focus on urban friendships and relationships. However, critics later highlighted distinct tonal differences. Emily St. James of The A.V. Club noted that \"the differences between the two series go beyond the surface\". Series star Jonathan Groff acknowledged the comparisons but emphasized the show's unique tone, writing style, and visual approach: \"To be in the same breath as those shows is exciting... but the tone and writing and the style of the show is very different. And people will notice that when they see it.\"\nKeith Uhlich of the BBC described the show as \"one of the most revolutionary depictions of gay life ever on TV – and that's because it makes it totally ordinary\".\nLooking: The Movie, which served as the series finale, was also well received by critics. Rotten Tomatoes summarized the consensus as: \"Touching and profound, Looking: The Movie puts a bittersweet conclusion to the too-soon-gone HBO series with humor and hopeful tenderness, even if its structure is slightly wobbly.\" Sonia Saraiya of Variety described the film as \"moving and beautiful\", while Jon Frosch of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"essential viewing\".\nIn 2019, The Guardian ranked Looking among the \"100 Greatest TV Shows of the 21st Century\". In 2022, Esquire placed it at #21 in its list of \"The Best HBO Series of All Time\", stating, \"The series never gained a massive audience, but its reverberations are still being felt.\"\nRatings\nLooking premiered to modest viewership. According to Variety, the pilot episode drew 338,000 viewers, with total viewership rising to 606,000 when encore broadcasts were included. Despite the initial low numbers, the series experienced growth over the season. The sixth episode achieved a then-series high with 519,000 viewers, marking a 50% increase compared to the premiere. As of February 23, 2014, the series averaged approximately two million viewers weekly across all platforms.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 5%;\" | Year\n! style=\"width: 30%;\" | Award\n! style=\"width: 35%;\" | Category\n! style=\"width: 20%;\" | Nominee(s)\n! style=\"width: 10%;\" | Result\n! class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |2014\n| Attitude Awards || TV Show of the Year || Looking ||\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| Critics' Choice Television Awards|| Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series|| data-sort-value=\"Weedman, Lauren\" | Lauren Weedman||\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| EWwy Awards|| Best Actor in a Comedy Series || data-sort-value=\"Groff, Jonathan\" | Jonathan Groff||\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Imagen Awards || Best Actor || data-sort-value=\"Castillo, Raul\" | Raúl Castillo||\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor || data-sort-value=\"Alvarez, Frankie J.\" | Frankie J.
