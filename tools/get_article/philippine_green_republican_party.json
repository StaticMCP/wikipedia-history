In 2010, they again fielded national candidates and local candidates including a presidential candidate, Felix Cantal. He, together with their senatorial candidates were declared nuisance candidates. Local candidates from PGRP were however able to run in local positions in 11 provinces nationwide. However, all these candidates lost.\nIdeology and electoral history\nMany serious environmentalist and greens believe after analyzing the political agenda of the Philippine Green Republican Party that they do not share the basic green principles and agenda to merit being considered a serious and legitimate national green political party. They did not participate in the 2013 elections but they have participated in the 2016 presidential elections. They fielded Apolonia \"Polly\" Soguilon (as a substitute for the late Roy Señeres) and Diego Palomares as their standard bearers for the 2016 polls.\nReferences\nExternal links"
