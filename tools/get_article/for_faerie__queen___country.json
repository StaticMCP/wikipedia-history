Magical guilds, mystical secret societies and anarchist plots all combined to form a genuinely original setting. FFQC could be accused of being a Victorian England version of ShadowRun, but that would be unfair. Overall, the game needs more material to be complete. However, for an inventive GM willing to flesh out British society in the 1870's, the game will offer plenty of adventure and roleplaying variety. Just remember to keep a little cold iron in your pocket, and you'll be safe.\"\nReviews\n*The Unspeakable Oath #11\n*Windgeflüster (Issue 24 - Dec 1993)\n*Casus Belli #77\nReferences"
