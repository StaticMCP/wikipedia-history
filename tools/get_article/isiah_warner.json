West Professor of Surface and Analytical Chemistry and the Vice President for Strategic Initiatives at Louisiana State University. He’s also a professor at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Warner has won numerous national and international awards for chemistry and mentoring of students in the sciences. He has published over 350 refereed publications and has several patents.\nBiography\nIsiah Warner was born in Bunkie, Louisiana in 1946. He is a graduate of Southern University where he received his BS degree in chemistry. Warner received his doctorate in Analytical Chemistry from the University of Washington in 1977. Following a post-doctoral research experience, Warner started his academic career at Texas A&M University where he was the first African American Chemistry faculty, and where received tenure and promotion to associate professor. Following receipt of tenure and promotion, Warner moved his research laboratory to Emory University and was promoted to full professor in 1986. In 1992, Warner returned to Louisiana and serves as the Phillip W. West Professor of Surface and Analytical Chemistry at Louisiana State University. He retired as Professor Emeritus in December 2021, with his most recent role being the Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at LSU and serves as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.\nWarner received an honorary doctorate from Marquette University.  He has been recognized for his chemical research and mentoring. Warner was named a fellow of the American Chemical Society in 2009. He is a recipient of the NOBCChE Percy L. Julian Award.\nResearch and Mentoring\nWarner is an analytical/materials Chemist, with research focuses on fluorescence spectroscopy, organized media, and ionic liquid chemistry, particularly as applied to solid phase materials. He is known for his mentoring of Chemistry students, and focus on the advancement of women and chemists of color. He has won numerous awards for his mentoring including. He has graduated 67 PhD students from his group, including a significant number of women and minorities, helping to make Louisiana State University the leader in producing women and African American PhD students.\nPersonal life\nWarner was born in 1946 in DeQuincy, Louisiana to Humphrey and Erma Warner.
