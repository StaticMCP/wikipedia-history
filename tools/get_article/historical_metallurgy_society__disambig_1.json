The society also issues a newsletter The Crucible three times a year, and has published edited collections based on the papers given at several of its conferences in an Occasional Papers series.\nThe Historical Metallurgy Society is a company limited by guarantee (no. 1442508) and a registered charity (no. 279314).\nHistory\nIt was founded as the Historical Metallurgy Group in 1963. All aspects of the history of metals and associated materials are covered from prehistory to the present, from processes and production through technology and economics to archaeology and conservation.\nThe Historical Metallurgy Society origins were partly a response to the damage and destruction of many historically important metallurgical sites. Conservation, research and protection remain important parts of the society’s role.\nEach year the society holds a two-day conference (usually in the United Kingdom) with a program of papers covering a particular area of metallurgical interest. In addition to this, it also runs other day meetings.\nNotable Members\n*Jack Nutting\n*Ronald F.
