By 1839 it contained these chapelries, curacies or ecclesiastical parishes which eventually became civil parishes in their own right:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Daughter parish\n!

There soon was a southern exception to this. By the 1086 snapshot of the Domesday Book, Long Ditton (which included exclave Tolworth east of Hook hamlet) had a fully-fledged church likely gaining its independence around that time as recorded throughout the high medieval age and onwards. Thus, in the grant of Kingston church and Long Ditton church to Merton Priory, soon after its foundation in 1117, Long Ditton does not appear as a chapelry of Kingston.\nThe residual Church of England ecclesiastical parish essentially divides sixfold:\n*All Saints - whole riverside strip -  1 church\n*St Peter, Norbiton - 2 churches\n*St Luke - 1 church - between railway and the Kingston Academy/Wolsey park\n*Kingston Hill, St Paul - 1 church\n*Kingston upon Thames, St John the Evangelist - Penrhyn Road & The Grove southern area - 1 church\n*Kingston Vale, St John the Baptist - 1 church\nReferences"
