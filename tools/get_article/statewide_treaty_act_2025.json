In 1988, the Barunga Statement was presented to Bob Hawke which called for a treaty between Indigenous peoples and the government and Hawke supported but this did not eventuate.\nIn March 2016, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced the that the state government would commit to a treaty-making process with Indigenous peoples.\nIn July 2016, the Aboriginal Treaty Working Group was established which concluded that a representative body was needed. In late 2017, the Aboriginal Community Assembly was established which was made up of 31 members and was tasked with assessing key questions relating to a representative body such as community representation, governance and structural elements.\nIn December 2017, a Victorian Treaty Advancement Commission was established and was chaired by Jill Gallagher, the body's main tasks were to establish greater momentum for the treaty-making process and establish an Aboriginal representative body. The final report of the Treaty Advancement Commission was submitted in March 2018 and toured 30 locations to showcase their proposals.\nIn 2018, the Parliament of Victoria passed the Advancing the Treaty Process with Aboriginal Victorians Bill 2018 which formally legislated a treaty-making body.\nIn 2019, the Aboriginal representative body was established and became the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria.\nIn 2021, the state government established a truth-telling forum to be known as the Yoorrook Justice Commission.\nIn August 2022, legislation passed parliament titled the Treaty Authority and Other Treaty Elements Bill 2022 which aimed to establish the Treaty Authority to expand consultation with Indigenous peoples and act as an umpire for these negotiations.\nIn October 2022, a Treaty Negotiation Framework was set up which sets out rules and conditions for negotiating a treaty. Also in October 2022, a Self-Determination Fund was introduced which allows Aboriginal Victorians to conduct treaty negotiations on an equal standing with the state government.\nIn November 2024, treaty negotiations formally begun between the state's Indigenous populations and the state government.\nProvisions\nThe legislation creates a body named Gellung Warl which will:\n* Make the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria permanent and establish a requirement that the body be consulted by the government on new laws affecting Indigenous peoples\n* Establish Nyerna Yoorrook Telkuna that will continue the truth-telling work of the Yoorrook Justice Commission\n* Establish Nginma Ngainga Wara (translated as \"you will do\" from Wadi Wadi language) as a body that will hold the state government to account on its promises to close the gap.\nThe treaty will create a new Indigenous cultural education facility for first peoples, encourage greater use of place names that recognise Indigenous heritage and calls for greater uses of Gellung Warl in daily life. The treaty also gives Aboriginal Victorians powers to confirm or deny Aboriginal identity, manage community infrastructure and manage cultural programs.\nReactions\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk praised the legislation's enactment while stating that the agreement had the \"potential to be truly transformative\" and that \"it represents a major step towards justice and equality\".\nOther states and territories\nAlthough this is the first legislation of its kind in Australia, other states such as New South Wales have planned treaty negotiation processes with their Indigenous peoples. The Australian Capital Territory is also planning to implement a treaty with its Indigenous peoples.\nOther states and territories such as Queensland, Tasmania — though it has established truth-telling and healing commissioners — and the Northern Territory had planned to negotiate treaties with Indigenous peoples but these have been canceled. South Australia has planned a treaty negotiation process with their Indigenous peoples but they have paused that process since it is nine months until their next election, although South Australia has legislated a Voice to Parliament similar to the rejected referendum proposal in 2023. The Western Australian government has stated that they are more focused on settling native titles.\nFuture\nThe opposition Liberal and National coalition has indicated that they do not support any treaty processes and seek to repeal the legislation if they win the next election due by November 2026, instead proposing a new advisory body and a government department to more effectively manage Indigenous affairs.\nThe Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal corporation has applied to begin negotiations of a local treaty with the Victorian government. This proposal has been welcomed by minister for treaty and first peoples Natalie Hutchins.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.treatyvictoria.vic.gov.au/ About Victoria's Treaty]\n* [https://content.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-09/Negotiated-Statewide-Treaty-Subject-to-assent-05092025.pdf Statewide Treaty]"
