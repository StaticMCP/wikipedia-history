He played college football for the Purdue Boilermakers and was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL draft.\nEarly life\nEdwards attended Woodward High School in Cincinnati and was a student and a letterman in football and basketball. In football, he was a two-year starter and posted 20.0 sacks, 110 tackles, and seven forced fumbles as a senior.\nCollege career\nEdwards played college football for three years at Big Ten school Purdue University from 2003 to 2005.  In his college career, Edwards played 36 games (starting in 18).  He recorded a total of 16 sacks and received many honors including All-Freshmen team choice by The Sporting News (2003), honorable mention All-Big Ten (2004) and semifinalist for the Ted Hendricks Defensive End of the Year Award (2005).\nProfessional career\n}}\nMinnesota Vikings\nEdwards was selected as the 127th pick (fourth round) of the 2006 NFL draft. During his rookie season, he appeared in 15 of the 16 regular season games, (the most for a Vikings rookie that year) and started in 2 of the last 4 games.  He recorded 3 sacks and 10 tackles.  In 2007 Edwards had 5 sacks and 30 tackles in 12 games.  He scored one touchdown on a fumble recovery against Detroit.  On December 5, Edwards was suspended for four games by the National Football League for a violation of the league's Steroid policy.  He was not eligible to play for the remainder of the Vikings regular season. In 2008 Edwards made 55 tackles and 5 sacks as the starting left defensive end after the acquisition of Jared Allen. In 2009, Edwards had a breakout year, recording 8.5 sacks, and having a strong performance against the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round of the post-season. Edwards became a restricted free agent in the 2010 offseason due to the CBA dispute instead of an unrestricted FA as he would have been if there were a labor agreement. The Vikings gave him a first-round restricted free agent tender. He signed the tender on June 14, 2010, after deciding to miss the Vikings offseason program.\nAtlanta Falcons\nOn July 29, 2011, Edwards was signed by the Atlanta Falcons to a five-year contract for 30 million dollars with 11 million dollars guaranteed. During the Falcons' 8–1 start in 2012, Edwards was largely invisible, with most of his snaps being taken by players with much lower salaries.\nEdwards was released by the Falcons on November 12, 2012.\nNFL career statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Legend\n|-\n| Bold\n| Career high\n|}\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n!colspan=\"2\"| Games\n!colspan=\"5\"| Tackles\n!colspan=\"5\"| Interceptions\n!colspan=\"4\"| Fumbles\n|-\n!
