He is a professor of Pediatrics and Public Health at the Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine.\nHe served as the 16th editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and the JAMA Network from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2021.\nEarly life and education\nBauchner earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley and his MD from the Boston University School of Medicine.\nHe completed pediatric residency training at Boston City Hospital (now Boston Medical Center) and Yale New Haven Hospital, and was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Fellow in General Pediatrics at Yale.\nCareer\nAt Boston University and Boston Medical Center, Bauchner served as Vice-Chair of Research for the Department of Pediatrics and Chief of the Division of General Pediatrics.\nFrom 2003 to 2011, he was Editor-in-Chief of Archives of Disease in Childhood.\nEditorship of JAMA\nBauchner was appointed the 16th Editor-in-Chief of JAMA and the JAMA Network in 2011 by the American Medical Association (AMA). Under his leadership, the network expanded substantially: the “Archives” journals were renamed to “JAMA [Specialty]” journals, and several new titles were launched, including JAMA Oncology (2015), JAMA Cardiology (2016), JAMA Network Open (2018), and JAMA Health Forum (2020/2021).\nFollowing the journal renaming, the JAMA Network automated a cascading submission process, enabling manuscripts to transfer seamlessly from one journal to another—a practice that has since become common in medical publishing. He also introduced new article types, strengthened peer review and editorial standards, and modernized the journal’s print and online presence through redesigned layouts, improved accessibility, and a broader digital and multimedia strategy. Under Bauchner's editorship, JAMA's social media following grew from 19,400 in 2011 to nearly 1.2 million in 2020, while article views across the JAMA Network reached 135 million in 2020, up from 29 million in 2012.\nIn 2016, JAMA published an article on health care reform authored by sitting U.S. President Barack Obama, marking the first such publication by a sitting president. That same year, JAMA began publishing recommendation statements and evidence reports from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Bauchner also prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion, substantially increasing the representation of women, Asian, Black, and Hispanic individuals on editorial boards and among decision-making editors across the JAMA Network journals.\nControversy and resignation\nIn March 2021, JAMA faced criticism after a JAMA Network podcast and tweet questioned the existence of structural racism in medicine. Following the backlash, the AMA placed Bauchner on administrative leave pending review.\nOn June 1, 2021, the AMA announced that Bauchner would step down from his role as Editor-in-Chief effective June 30, 2021.\nThe decision followed ongoing public discussion of diversity, equity, and representation in medical publishing.\nResearch and publications\nBauchner has written and spoken widely on issues in medical publishing, including open science, data sharing, conflict of interest, the role of peer review, diversity in authorship, and the communication of medical evidence.\nHe has also addressed topics such as team science, authorship ethics, and the responsibilities of editors during public health crises.\nSelected works\nBauchner’s publications have shaped discussions on public health policy, clinical research standards, and publishing ethics. Below are some of his most-cited publications, based on citation counts from Google Scholar:\n* Bauchner H, Rivara FP. \"Death by Gun Violence - A Public Health Crisis\". JAMA. 2017;318(18):1763–1764. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.16446.\n* Bauchner H, Golub RM, Fontanarosa PB. \"Reporting and Interpretation of Randomized Clinical Trials\".

Eur J Emerg Med. 2025;32(1):1–2. doi: 10.1097/MEJ.0000000000001204.\nHonors and memberships\nBauchner was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2015.\nHe is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\nLegacy\nBauchner’s decade as JAMA’s editor-in-chief coincided with rapid changes in scientific communication, digital publishing, and global dissemination of medical information. His leadership saw both expansion of the JAMA Network and heightened scrutiny of diversity and equity in academic medicine. This period also highlighted ongoing debates in medical publishing regarding the handling of sensitive topics like structural racism, contributing to broader discussions on editorial accountability. Bauchner's continued work post-JAMA, including writings on open science and AI in publishing, underscores his enduring influence on the field.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://profiles.bu.edu/Howard.Bauchner Faculty profile at Boston University]\n* [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2780788 “To Howard Bauchner, MD, Visionary Editor in Chief of JAMA” – JAMA editorial]\n* [https://nam.edu/news-and-insights/nam-elects-80-new-members/ National Academy of Medicine member directory]"
