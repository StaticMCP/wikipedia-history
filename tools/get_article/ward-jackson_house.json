The -story wood-frame house was built sometime in the 1890s, and is a particularly fine local example of Folk Victorian architecture.  It has a busy exterior typical of Queen Anne styling, including different types of cut shingles, and has a porch with turned-spindle balustrade, and an Eastlake-style frieze.  The windows are long and narrow, giving the house a somewhat Gothic appearance.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Hempstead County, Arkansas\nReferences"
