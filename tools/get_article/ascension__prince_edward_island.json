      "text": "# Ascension, Prince Edward Island\n\nAscension (also known as Pigbrook) is a small community located mainly on Route 160 from 3 miles NE of Tignish. Ascension is within the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island, in Eastern Canada.\nThe community is home to ''Harper's Brook, a tributary to the Tignish River'', which runs from Tignish to DeBlois. It is home to approximately 130 people.\nThe name \"Ascension\" is believed to have come from the Christian doctrine account of the Ascension of Jesus after his death. The name may also be derived from the fact that the Ascension road ascends, from its starting point at Tignish to its finish in Nail Pond."
