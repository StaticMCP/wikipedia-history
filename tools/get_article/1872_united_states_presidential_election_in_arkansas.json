Voters chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nArkansas voted for the Republican candidate, President Ulysses S. Grant, over Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley. Grant won Arkansas by a margin of 4.34%. However, due to the turbulent conditions of Reconstruction, along with various irregularities and allegations of electoral fraud, Congress rejected Arkansas' six electoral votes. Neighboring Louisiana's electoral votes were also rejected.}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Arkansas\nReferences"
