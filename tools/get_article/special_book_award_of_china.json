The award recognizes foreign translators, writers, and publishers who have made significant contributions to introducing China, translating and publishing Chinese books, and promoting cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries. The awards are typically announced around the time of the Beijing International Book Fair. The prize has evolved to include two main categories: the main Special Book Award of China for experienced scholars and the Special Book Award for Young Scholars, established around 2017 to honor promising young academics and translators. As of the 18th cycle (2025), approximately 219 individuals from 63 different countries have received the award, including notable recipients such as Princeton Professor Martin Kern (2025) and Italian Sinologist Silvia Pozzi (2024).\n\"The awards are China's top publication prize that honors foreigners for making great contributions to the introduction and promotion of China, Chinese culture and Chinese publications to the world.\"\nRecipients\n2011\n* B.
