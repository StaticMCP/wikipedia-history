The previous elections produced a majority for the Conservative Party. The boundaries of many of the wards across the District were changed from the previous election.\nBoundary review\nThe 2015 election came after a boundary review. In 2011, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE) decided to review Warwick District Council, since 30% of the wards had over 10% more voters than average. According to the council, the review would \"decide how many councillors [are] right for Warwick district\" and a working party of one councillor from each political group would be set up to oversee the review process; the review was expected to cost the council £34,700. The council sought to keep a similar number of councillors in order to manage councillor workload. It was reported that consideration would be given to single-councillor wards, as well as to Warwick Gates and Chase Meadow becoming their own wards.\nThe LGBCE announced its draft plans for consultation in 2012. The plans included keeping the number of councillors at 46, having mostly two-councillor wards, and significantly redrawing ward boundaries. Comments on the proposed wards mainly focused on the areas of Bishop's Tatchbrook, Heathcote, Whitnash, and Myton. The final recommendations were released by the LGBCE in March 2013. They were enacted by the Warwick (Electoral Changes) Order 2014, a statutory instrument which was made on 8 January 2014, and came into effect at the 2015 election.\nSummary\nElection result\n6\n|seats %    = 67.4\n|votes %    = 43.3\n|votes      = 32,645\n|plus/minus = +2.5\n}}\n1\n|seats %    = 19.6\n|votes %    = 22.7\n|votes      = 17,114\n|plus/minus = -2.4\n}}\n0\n|seats %    = 6.52\n|votes %    = 3.7\n|votes      = 2,789\n|plus/minus = -0.5\n}}\n7\n|seats %    = 4.35\n|votes %    = 13.1\n|votes      = 9,876\n|plus/minus = -4.7\n}}\n1\n|seats %    = 2.17\n|votes %    = 13.4\n|votes      = 10,102\n|plus/minus = +2.2\n}}\n0\n|seats %    = 0.0\n|votes %    = 2.3\n|votes      = 1,734\n|plus/minus = +1.9\n}}\n1\n|seats %    = 0.0\n|votes %    = 1.4\n|votes      = 1,055\n|plus/minus = +0.8\n}}\n|-\nWard results\nAbbey Ward\n}}\nArden Ward\n}}\nAylesford\n}}\nBishop's Tachbrook\n}}\nBrunswick\n}}\nBudbrooke\n}}\nClarendon\n}}\nCrown\n}}\nEmscote\n}}\nLeam\n}}\nManor\n}}\nMilverton\n}}\nMyton & Heathcote\n}}\nNewbold\n}}\nPark Hill\n}}\nRadford Semele\n}}\nSaltisford\n}}\nSt. John's Ward\n}}\nStoneleigh & Cubbington\n}}\nSydenham\n}}\nWhitnash\n}}\nWoodloes\n}}\nReferences"
