The awards were broadcast live from Twitter on September 26, 2017 from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. They were hosted by YouTube star Jon Cozart. Awards for Best Comedy Series and Best Drama Series were introduced for the 2017 Streamys to put a greater emphasis on original series, and the performance awards were not split by gender as they had been in previous years in an effort to make the awards more inclusive.

Talking to The Hollywood Reporter, Cozart described his job as host as \"to dig into the Streamys and reveal the hypocrisy of the new media industry. I'm exposing us for what we are, which is a room full of narcissists with good intentions.\" According to The Hollywood Reporter, two main themes of the night were politics and diversity. Director of Brown Girls Sam Bailey praised the show for focusing on creators saying \"It really shows there is work done at home by individual people without a network behind them.\"\nSee also\n*List of Streamy Award winners\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.streamys.org Streamy Awards website]"
