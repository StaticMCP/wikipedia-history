Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe ran for re-election as an independent candidate, making him the first sitting president to run for re-election since Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015. Other prominent candidates included Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the NPP, and Namal Rajapaksa, son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.\nThe election was a three-way contest between Wickremesinghe, Premadasa and Dissanayake. For the first time in a Sri Lankan presidential election, no candidate received a majority of the vote. Dissanayake was in first place with 42%, followed by Premadasa with 33%. Incumbent president Wickremesinghe finished third, receiving only 17% of the vote. As no candidate received a majority, second preference votes were counted. The following day, Dissanayake was declared the winner with 56% of the vote after second preferences had been taken into account. He was inaugurated on 23 September.\nThe election signified a major political realignment in Sri Lanka. Dissanayake's victory was the first time a third-party candidate was elected president. This was also the first election where neither of the top two candidates were endorsed by the United National Party or the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.\nBackground\nThe last direct presidential elections held in Sri Lanka were in 2019, where SLPP candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the election in a landslide victory, defeating his main opponent Sajith Premadasa.\nRajapaksa resigned on 14 July 2022 during the 2022 Sri Lankan protests. This triggered an indirect presidential election via Parliament a week later, to elect a successor according to the Article 40 of the Constitution. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who had been appointed as Prime Minister by Rajapaksa just two months earlier, received the most votes and was sworn in as the 9th President of Sri Lanka on 21 July 2022.\nArticle 40 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka states that \"Any person so succeeding to the office of President shall hold office only for the unexpired period of the term of office of the President vacating office. President Wickremesinghe's term is due to expire on 17 November 2024.\nDiscussion surrounding the 2024 election had been a major topic since the beginning of the year. The Election Commission stated that the election had to be held between 17 September and 16 October, as required by the Constitution. On 26 July, the Election Commission issued a Gazette notification declaring that the election would be held on 21 September 2024, with nominations for candidates to be submitted by 15 August. The commission chose to hold the election on a Saturday, stating that this would help ensure a high voter turnout. On the same day, Ranil Wickremesinghe announced his candidacy for a second term as president, running as an independent candidate.\nApproximately 17 million people were eligible to vote in this election.\nRecent Sri Lankan election results\nPrior election results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n! colspan=\"13\" style=\"width:800px;\" | Election results\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 10em\"| Dates of elections\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:4px solid #9D1B25; \"| Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPFA)\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:4px solid #43894d; \"| Samagi Jana Balawegaya\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:4px solid #C4094A;\" | National People's Power\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:4px solid #ff0;\"| Tamil National Alliance\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:4px solid green;\" | United National Party\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom:4px solid grey;\"| Others\n|-  style=\"background:#e9e9e9; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| Votes\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| %\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| Votes\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| %\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| Votes\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| %\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| Votes\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| %\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| Votes\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| %\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| Votes\n! style=\"width: 4em\"| %\n|-  style=\"height:50px\"\n|style=\"border-right:5px solid #9D1B25; \"|2019 presidential election\n|style=\"font-weight:bold;\"|6,924,255\n|style=\"font-weight:bold;\"|52.25%\n|－\n|－\n|418,553\n|3.16%\n|－\n|－\n|5,564,239\n|41.99%\n|345,452\n|2.35%\n|- style=\"height:50px\"\n|style=\"border-right:5px solid #9D1B25; \"|2020 parliamentary election\n|style=\"font-weight:bold;\"|6,853,690\n|style=\"font-weight:bold;\"|59.09%\n|2,771,980\n|23.90%\n|445,958\n|3.84%\n|327,168\n|2.82%\n|249,435\n|2.15%\n|950,698\n|8.20%\n|}\nMaps\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1000px;\" |Election results map\n|-\n! 2019 presidential election\n! 2020 parliamentary election\n|-\n| style=\"width:500px;\" |\n| style=\"width:500px;\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Elected members of each electoral district or municipality, gaining the highest number of votes■ SLPFA ■ SJB ■ TNA ■ SLFP ■ EPDP ■ Other parties\n|}\nElectoral system\nType of electoral system\nThe President of Sri Lanka is elected through a system of limited ranked voting. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for the presidency. If no candidate receives more than 50% of all valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the two who received the highest number of votes are eliminated. The second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are then redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority.\nIn practice, this system had seen no use. Every presidential election since the first in 1982 had resulted in a candidate from one of the major parties or alliances winning an outright majority in the first count. Consequently, most voters choose to mark only one candidate on their ballots, and many are either unaware that they can rank multiple candidates or choose not to exercise that prerogative.\nVoting procedure\nThe Election Commission outlined the voting procedure on 30 August 2024, detailing the ranked voting system due to the multiple candidates contesting the presidential election, ensuring voters were informed on how to cast and submit their ballots. Voting began at 13,134 polling stations nationwide at 7:00 AM SLST on 21 September and closed at 4:00 PM SLST.\nPostal voting\nThe Election Commission announced the dates and locations for postal voting in a media release on 29 August 2024. This facility is available only to pre-approved officials engaged in election duties. Postal voting was conducted on 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12 September, strictly according to the provided schedule.\nBallot boxes and security systems\nDue to the larger size of the ballot papers, the Election Commission has opted to use cardboard ballot boxes instead of traditional wooden ones. These boxes will be available in three sizes. A combination of wooden and cardboard ballot boxes was used in the 2019 Sri Lankan presidential election and the 2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election.\nTo further ensure security, the government imposed a liquor ban on the weekend of 21 to 22 September and deployed more than 63,000 police officers to secure polling stations and counting centres. It also banned the holding of victory rallies or celebrations until a week after the results were announced. A nighttime curfew was also declared after the end of voting, which was lifted at noon on 22 September.\nCandidates\nBy the end of candidate registration on 15 August, the Election Commission had accepted a total of 39 applications for the presidential election, the highest number ever recorded for a presidential election in Sri Lanka. One candidate, Mohamed Illiyas, died of a heart attack prior to the election. His name on the ballot was not replaced. Despite the record number of candidates, none were female.\nMajor candidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Candidate\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\" | Political office and constituency\n!Symbol\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\" | Endorsements\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" class=\"unsortable\" ! |\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:lavender;\" |Ranil Wickremesinghe ()Independent\n| President of Sri Lanka (2022–2024)Leader of the United National Party (since 1994)Former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka (1993–1994, 2001–2004, 2015–2018, 2018–2019, 2022)\n|Gas Cylinder\n|\n* United National Party\n* Breakaway members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna\n* Ceylon Workers' Congress\n* De facto Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party\n*Eelam People's Democratic Party\n*Mahajana Eksath Peramuna\n*New Lanka Freedom Party\n*Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal\n| align=\"left\" |\n* Declared 26 July 2024\n* Relative of former President J.

These amounts that have remained unchanged since the introduction of presidential elections in 1982.\nMany of the minor candidates are accused of being proxy or dummy candidates put forward by the main contenders to maximise the benefits of candidacy, such as having two agents at every polling station, assigning counting agents, receiving free slots on state television, and gaining general media coverage.\nWithdrawn candidates\nThe following candidates initially declared their intentions to contest the election but later withdrew from the campaign.\n;Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna\n* Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 8th President of Sri Lanka (2019–2022)\n*Basil Rajapaksa, former Minister of Finance (2021–2022), former Member of Parliament (2007–2010, 2010–2015, 2021–2022)\n* Dhammika Perera, businessman, former Minister of Investment Promotion (2022), Member of Parliament (2022–2024)\n;Sri Lanka Freedom Party\n*Maithripala Sirisena, 7th President of Sri Lanka (2015–2019), Member of Parliament (1989–2015, 2020–2024)\nRejected candidates\nThe following candidate placed his deposit before the nomination date but failed to appear and submit his nomination papers.\n* Sarath Kumara Gunaratna, former Deputy Minister, former SLFP/UPFA Member of Parliament (2006–2015)\nCampaign\nPlatforms\nRanil Wickremesinghe highlighted his administration's success in resolving shortages of basic goods. Anura Kumara Dissanayake campaigned on a platform promoting economic freedoms and welfare protections for the working class. Sajith Premadasa vowed to mitigate the impact of the International Monetary Fund's restructuring programme on the poor and promised devolved political powers to the Tamil minority. Namal Rajapaksa pledged to reduce tax burdens, attributing the recent economic and political crises to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAbolition of executive presidency\nDuring the election campaign, both Dissanayake and Premadasa promised that, if elected, they would abolish the executive presidential system and return the country to a parliamentary democracy. This familiar pre-election pledge has been made by many political leaders in the past, yet none have fulfilled it.\nOn 23 September 2024, National People's Power member Sunil Handunnetti informed the media that the abolition of the executive presidency remains a priority for the government led by newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.\nDebates\nThe first presidential debate was scheduled for 7 September 2024, hosted by the March 12 Movement. Four candidates, Sajith Premadasa, Namal Rajapaksa, Dilith Jayaweera, and P. Ariyanethiran, confirmed their participation. The debate took place at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) and was broadcast live on mainstream television and social media platforms. However, despite initial confirmations, only Dilith Jayaweera attended the debate.\nElection monitors\nFollowing an invitation from the Election Commission of Sri Lanka, the European External Action Service (EEAS) of the European Union (EU) will deploy an Election Observation Mission (EOM) to observe the Presidential Election scheduled for 21 September.\nThe Election Commission further announced that representatives from 12 countries have been invited to observe the upcoming election. Among those participating are South Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Maldives, as well as a Commonwealth observer group (COG) and representatives from the Asian Election Observation Network.\nCampaign finances\nExpenditure cap and regulations\nThe Election Commission, through a Gazette notification (Gazette Extraordinary – No. 2397/66 on 16 August 2024), set an expenditure cap of Rs. 109 per voter for the 2024 presidential election. As a result, each candidate is now permitted to spend a maximum of Rs. 1.8 billion (Rs. 1,868,298,586).
