Japanese and Chinese use ox horns for the same purpose, as well as for shades of oil lamps. ||\n|-\n|}\n19th Century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || Event || style=\"width:10%\" | Reference\n|-\n|1839\n|Eduard Simon, a German apothecary, discovers polystyrene.\n|\n|-\n| 1844 ||Thomas Hancock patents the vulcanization of rubber in Britain immediately followed by Charles Goodyear in United States. ||\n|-\n| 1856 || Parkesine, the first member of the Celluloid class of compounds and considered the first man-made plastic, is patented by Alexander Parkes. ||\n|-\n| 1869 || John Wesley Hyatt discovers a method to simplify the production of celluloid, making industrial production possible.||\n|-\n| 1872 || PVC is accidentally synthesized in 1872 by German chemist Eugen Baumann. ||\n|-\n|1889 || Eastman Kodak successfully files a patent for celluloid film.\n|\n|-\n| 1890s || Galalith, a plastic derived from casein, is developed by Wilhelm Krische and Adolph Spitteler. ||\n|-\n| 1890s || Auguste Trillat discovers the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde, producing material marketed as galalith. ||\n|-\n| 1894 || Shellac phonograph records are developed and soon become an industry standard.||\n|-\n| 1898 || The German chemist Hans von Pechmann first synthesizes polyethylene while investigating diazomethane.||\n|-\n|}\n20th Century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || Event || style=\"width:10%\" | Reference\n|-\n| 1907 || Bakelite, the first fully synthetic thermoset, is reported by Leo Baekeland using phenol and formaldehyde.||\n|-\n| 1912 || After over 10 years' research, Jacques E. Brandenberger develops a method for producing cellophane and secures a patent. ||\n|-\n| 1926 || Waldo Semon and the B.F. Goodrich Company develops a method to plasticize PVC by blending it with various additives. ||\n|-\n|1930\n|Neoprene is produced for the first time at DuPont.\n|\n|-\n| 1930s || Polystyrene is first produced by BASF. ||\n|-\n| 1931 || RCA Victor introduces its vinyl-based Victrolac compound for records. Vinyl records have twice the groove density of shellac records with good sound quality. ||\n|-\n| 1933 || The first industrially practical polyethylene synthesis is discovered by Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) works in Northwich, England. ||\n|-\n|1935 || Nylon is invented and patented by DuPont.\n|\n|-\n| 1938 || Nylon is first used for bristles in toothbrushes. It features at the 1939 World's Fair and is famously used in stockings in 1940.||\n|-\n|1938 || Polytetrafluoroethylene (commonly known as teflon), discovered by Roy Plunkett at DuPont.||\n|-\n| 1941 || Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is discovered at the Calico Printers' Association in Britain. Expanded polystyrene is first produced.||\n|-\n| 1950 || DuPont begin the manufacture of polyester. ||\n|-\n| 1951 || J. Paul Hogan and Robert L. Banks from Phillips polymerize propylene for the first time to produce polypropylene. ||\n|-\n| 1953 || Polycarbonate is independently developed by Hermann Schnell at Bayer and Daniel Fox at General Electric. ||\n|-\n| 1954 || Polypropylene is discovered by Giulio Natta with production starting in 1957 ||\n|-\n| 1954 || Expanded polystyrene, used for building insulation, packaging, and cups, is invented by Dow Chemical. ||\n|-\n| 1957 || The Italian firm Montecatini begins large-scale commercial production of isotactic polypropylene. ||\n|-\n| 1960s || High-density polyethylene bottles are introduced; they will replace glass bottles in most applications. ||\n|-\n| 1965 || Kevlar is developed at DuPont by Stephanie Kwolek. ||\n|-\n| 1980s || Polyester film stock replaces cellulose acetate for photographic film and computer tapes. ||\n|-\n| 1988 || The first polymer bank notes are issued in Australia. ||\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
