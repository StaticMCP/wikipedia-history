It has smooth, powdery white bark, narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to barrel-shaped fruit.\nDescription\nEucalyptus umbrawarrensis is a tree that typically grows to a height of  and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth powdery white bark, that is pale yellow to pale pink when new. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped,  long and  wide, tapering to a petiole  long.

Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped,  long and about  wide with a conical to beaked operculum that is about half as long as the floral cup. Flowering has been observed in January and October and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to barrel-shaped capsule  long and  wide with the valves near rim level.\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus umbrawarrensis was first formally described in 1922 by Joseph Maiden in his book, A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus from specimens collected by Harald Jensen in 1916 in Umbrawarra Gorge. The specific epithet (umbrawarrensis) refers to the type location.\nDistribution and habitat\nUmbrawarra gum grows in open woodland on ridges, hills and tablelands in the Top End and Victoria River districts of the Northern Territory.\nConservation status\nThis eucalypt is classified as \"least concern\" under the Northern Territory Government Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act.\nSee also\n*List of Eucalyptus species\nReferences"
