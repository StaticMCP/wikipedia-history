Grant\n| after_party = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 1868 United States presidential election in Kentucky took place on November 3, 1868, as part of the 1868 United States presidential election. Voters chose 11 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nKentucky voted for the Democratic nominee, Horatio Seymour over the Republican nominee, Ulysses S. Grant. Seymour won the state by a margin of 49.1%.\nWith 74.55% of the popular vote, Kentucky would be Seymour's strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote. As of the 2020 presidential election, this remains the strongest-ever performance by a presidential nominee in Kentucky who had a major-party opponent since the First Party System, when Democratic-Republicans regularly routed Federalists with over 90% of the vote. It was also the last time that Clinton County or Cumberland County would vote for a Democratic presidential candidate.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nReferences"
