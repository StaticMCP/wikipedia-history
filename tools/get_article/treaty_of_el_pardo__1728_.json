The British aim was to make peace with Spain before it joined a potential alliance with Austria. However, the terms, agreed by the British Ambassador in Madrid, Benjamin Keene were considered too lenient by his superiors in London, and they were repudiated leading to the later discussions at Soissons, which lasted nearly a year.\nDespite the efforts of diplomats, a fresh war would break out between Britain and Spain in 1739, little more than a decade later.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Browning, Reed.
