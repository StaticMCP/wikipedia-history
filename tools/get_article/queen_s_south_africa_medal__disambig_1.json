Altogether twenty-six clasps were awarded, to indicate participation in particular actions and campaigns.\nInstitution\nThe Queen's South Africa Medal was instituted by Queen Victoria in 1900, for award to military personnel and civilian officials who served in South Africa during the Second Boer War from 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902.\nThree versions of the medal are known. Since the war was initially expected to be of short duration and to reach its conclusion in 1900, the first medals were struck with the years \"1899\" and \"1900\" on the reverse. Approximately fifty of these medals were awarded before it became evident that the war was going to last much longer, and both the dies and the remaining minted medals had the years machined off. The third version was minted without the years.\nThe Second Boer War\nPoor logistics and disease, combined with having to fight against a disciplined and capable enemy of excellent horsemen and marksmen who perfected guerrilla warfare, made this a hard-won medal. In addition to men often having to go without basics such as food and water, enteric fever killed several thousand and was a constant drain on manpower. The published casualty rolls run to over 50,000 names, while studies of contemporary publications and reports put the actual figure for all casualties, including caused by disease, at 97,000.\nAward criteria\nThe medal\nThe Queen's South Africa Medal was awarded to all British led forces who served in South Africa from 11 October 1899 to the end of the war on 31 May 1902. Those who qualified for the medal included members of the British Army, Royal Navy, hospital nurses colonial forces from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, as well as locally raised units from the Cape of Good Hope, the Natal and \"hensoppers\" (collaborators, literally \"hands-uppers\") from the South African Republic and Orange Free State, civilians employed in an official capacity, war correspondents, and non-enlisted men of whatever nationality who drew military pay. This included those such as the New Zealand 10th Contingent, who arrived in Durban in May 1902, but saw no fighting.\nApproximately 178,000 medals were awarded. The medal, without clasp, was awarded to nurses, members of the Royal Navy who served offshore but did not land and to the troops who guarded Boer prisoners on the island of Saint Helena. Militia troops stationed on the Mediterranean during the war were awarded the Queen's Mediterranean Medal, while Merchant Navy officers on troopships were awarded the Transport Medal.\nA separate King's South Africa Medal was instituted in 1902 by King Edward VII for those who had served in South Africa after 1 January 1902 and who had completed 18 months service in the conflict, not necessarily continuous, prior to the war's end on 1 June 1902. The King's Medal was always awarded in addition to the Queen's Medal, which continued to be awarded until the end of the war.\nClasps\nTwenty-six clasps were awarded with the Queen's South Africa Medal, indicating the actions and campaigns of the Second Boer War, the maximum awarded to any one recipient being nine. They were authorised in Army Order 94, April 1902, as amended. The clasps fall into three groups: Battle, State and Date clasps.\nBattle clasps:\nAwarded for specific actions and campaigns. Recipients could not be awarded both the \"DEFENCE\" and \"RELIEF\" clasps for Mafeking, Kimberley or Ladysmith.\nState clasps:\nFor service within a state, where no Battle clasp was awarded for a specific action within that state. The \"CAPE COLONY\" and \"NATAL\" clasps were not awarded together, with \"CAPE COLONY\" awarded where a recipient qualified for both.\nDate clasps:\nThe two date clasps (South Africa 1901 and 1902) were issued with the King's South Africa Medal, but were worn with the Queen's South Africa Medal when the recipient was ineligible for the King's Medal.\nThe clasps read upwards from the ribbon suspension, with the official order of wear based on the starting dates of the applicable battle or campaign and, in the case of the four clasps with the same starting date, the duration of the campaign. Additional clasps were occasionally issued after the medal was awarded, resulting in cases of clasps not being attached, or attached in the wrong order.

The bronze medal was awarded to non-combatant Indian troops and other non-combatant men of whatever nationality who drew military pay, although some silver medals were awarded to native troops. The suspender is attached to the medal with a claw mount and a pin through the upper edge of the medal.\n;Obverse\nThe obverse shows a crowned and veiled effigy of Queen Victoria, facing left, with the legend \"VICTORIA REGINA ET IMPERATRIX\" around the upper perimeter.\n;Reverse\nThe reverse, designed by G. W. de Saulles, shows Britannia holding the Union Flag in her left hand and a laurel wreath in her right hand. In the right background are troops marching inland from the coast. In the left background are two men-of-war, with Neptune's Trident and Britannia's shield on the ground in the foreground. Around the top perimeter are the words \"SOUTH AFRICA\". Three types of reverse exist.\n* The first medals were awarded to Lord Strathcona's Horse and bore the years \"1899\" and \"1900\" below Britannia's wreath, with the wreath almost touching the \"R\" of \"AFRICA\". Approximately fifty of these medals were awarded.\n* The years were machined off both the dies and the remaining minted medals, although 'ghost' years are sometimes still visible.\n* Subsequent mintings were done with new dies, without the years and with the wreath now almost touching the \"F\" of \"AFRICA\". This reverse was also used for the King's South Africa Medal.\nFile:Queen's South Africa Medal, 1st type reverse.jpg|Version 1, with dates 1899 and 1900\nFile:Queen's South Africa Medal, 2nd type reverse.jpg|Version 2, showing 'ghost' dates\nFile:Queen's South Africa Medal, 3rd type reverse.jpg|Version 3, a new die, with AFRICA in lower position\n;Clasps\nThe clasps were attached to the suspender and to each other in roller chain fashion with rivets. Clasps were often issued after the medal, in particular those for South Africa 1901 and 1902, with the result that they were sometimes attached with unofficial rivets, or worn loose on the ribbon.\n;Naming\nThe recipient's name and details were impressed on the rim of the medal, with some officer's medals engraved.\nAbout 1,500 medals were presented unnamed to members of Australian and New Zealand forces during the 1901 tour of those countries by the future King George V. Many were later named locally, either officially at public expense, or privately.\n;Ribbon\nThe ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with a 7 millimetres wide red band and a 4 millimetres wide dark blue band, repeated in reverse order and separated by a 10 millimetres wide orange band.\nOrder of wear\nCampaign medals and stars are not listed by name in the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, but are all grouped together as taking precedence after the Queen's Medal for Chiefs and before the Polar Medals, in order of the date of the campaign for which awarded.\nIn the order of wear of British campaign medals, the Queen's South Africa Medal takes precedence after the East and Central Africa Medal and before the Queen's Mediterranean Medal.\nThe British order of precedence of the Second Boer War campaign medals is as follows:\n* The '''Queen's South Africa Medal'''.\n* The Queen's Mediterranean Medal.\n* The Transport Medal.\n* The King's South Africa Medal.\nSouth Africa\nEven though the Republican awards for the Second Boer War, the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst and the two campaign awards, the Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog and the Lint voor Verwonding, were instituted on behalf of King George V by His Royal Highness, the Governor General of the Union of South Africa, the Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst is not listed in the British order of wear and the two campaign awards would therefore most likely also have been excluded.\nThe South African order of precedence of the Second Boer War campaign medals, in order of the date of the campaign for which awarded, is as follows:\n* The '''Queen's South Africa Medal'''.\n* The Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog.\n* The Lint voor Verwonding.\n* The King's South Africa Medal.\nOn 6 April 1952 the Union of South Africa instituted its own range of military decorations and medals. These new awards were worn before all earlier British decorations and medals awarded to South Africans, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, which still took precedence before all other awards. Of the official British campaign medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Queen's South Africa Medal took precedence as shown.\n* Preceded by the Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal.\n* Succeeded by the Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog.\nSee also\n* King's South Africa Medal\n* Cape Copper Company Medal for the Defence of O'okiep\n* Kimberley Star\nReferences"
