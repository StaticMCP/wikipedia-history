It was formed in 2009 by Doris \"Granny D\" Haddock.\nEach year it sponsors \"Rebellion\" walks to commemorate Granny D, who at the age of 88-90 walked across the United States, ending in Washington, DC, where she was arrested for reading the Declaration of Independence in the Capitol.\nIn 2017, it is providing back-office support for EqualVotesUS, an organization that intends to fight the electoral college presidential voting method in the courts. The specific goal is to eliminate the \"winner take all\" system for electoral college votes within a state.\nReferences"
