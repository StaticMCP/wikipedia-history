During the battle, the forces of all three different land armies participated: infantry, cavalry and artillery. The Cuban troops were commanded by Major Generals Antonio Maceo and Juan Rius Rivera, while the Spanish troops were led by Colonel Granados.\nThe Battle\nThe Cuban troops were lagging behind as a result of a large number of civilians that they carried with them. The fighting began around eight in the morning and lasts until around five in the afternoon when Maceo's troops are dedicated to harassing the last Spanish strongholds with the most notable stronghold being one known as El Guao, in one of the foothills of the hill known as Ceja del Negro.\nThe Spanish forces, far superior in number and military power, did not manage to win the battle, but Colonel Granados bombarded the river pass with artillery, where the Cubans were passing, causing large numbers of casualties, especially among the civilian population with the elderly being the most affected.\nAftermath\nThe victory of General Maceo in Ceja del Negro caused the Captain General of the island, Valeriano Weyler, to hasten his plans for reconcentration against the Cuban civilian population, in order to defeat the pro-independence troops, depriving them of the vital support of the peasants.\nReferences"
