Prior to its creation, the main regional film awards were the ASECAN Awards, presented by the association of Andalusian Cinematographic Writers (ASECAN). Upon the announcement of the 1st Carmen Awards, the ASECAN awards reduced the number of categories, removing the technical categories. For the 1st edition of the Carmen Awards celebrated on 30 January 2022 in Málaga, the Andalusian Film Academy opted for a polyhedric statuette made of polymer resin as a trophy. For the 2nd edition, held in Almería, the trophies were made of bronze, replacing the resin trophies.\nCeremonies\nThe following is a listing of all Carmen Awards ceremonies:\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
