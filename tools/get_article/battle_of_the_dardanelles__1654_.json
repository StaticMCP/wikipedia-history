The battle saw an Ottoman armada routing a much smaller Venetian fleet.\nBackground\nVenetian commander Giuseppe Delfino reached the mouth of the Dardanelles on 19 April after a voyage in which he lost approximately 3 ships. His fleet of 17 sailing ships, 2 galleasses and 8 galleys was not large enough or adequately prepared. Murad, the Kapudan Pasha (admiral) left Constantinople with 30 sailing ships, 6 galleasses (known in Turkey as mahons), and 40 galleys on 10 May and reached the Narrows, just above the mouth of the Dardanelles, on 15 May.\nBattle\nThe Ottoman fleet was formed into 3 lines: sailing ships first, then galleasses, then galleys. The next day Delfino attacked. His plan was for his ships to remain at anchor until the Turks passed and then to attack the rear. However, most Venetian ships sailed too soon, leaving Delfinos ship, San Giorgio grande, that of his second, Daniele Morosini, ''Aquila d'Oro, along with Orsola Bonaventura (Sebastiano Molino), Margarita, 2 galleasses and 2 galleys, without support.\nAquila d'Oro was attacked first, by a large Ottoman ship which she managed to capture, before 5 Turkish vessels came to its rescue. The Ottoman vessel ended up being burnt, leading to the burning of Aquila d'Oro, too. Morosini was taken prisoner as he tried to flee in a boat. The action became more general.\nWhen it was over, the Venetians had lost 2 ships and 1 galley burnt, 1 galley captured, as well as the leader of the galleys, Francesco Morosini, killed, and Daniele Morosini captured. Total casualties were 30 killed and about 40 wounded, although one account had higher figures. Ottoman losses were 2 sailing ships burnt, and perhaps 1 galleass and 1 galley lost.\nOrder of battle\nVenice (Giuseppe Delfino)\nSome were hired Dutch or English ships\nSan Giorgio grande (flag)\nAquila d'Oro (Dutch Gouden Arend) - Burnt\nConcordia (Dutch Eendracht)\nCasa di Nassau (Dutch Huys van Nassau)\nSan Zorzi (Giorgio) piccolo (Dutch Kleene Sint Joris)\nAquila Coronato (Dutch Kronede Arend)\nOrsola Bonaventura (English Ursula Bonaventure) - Burnt\nAnna Bonaventura (English Anne Bonaventure)\nSan Michiel\nSpirito Santo\nApollo\nMargarita\nSan Giovanni\nConte Sdrin/Conte Desdrin\nGenovese grande\nPinco Tremartino''\n2 galleasses\n8 galleys - flag galley of Francesco Morosini burnt, 1 other captured\nOttomans (Kara Murat Pasha)\n30 sailing ships - 2 burnt\n6 galleasses - 1 sunk?\n40 galleys - 1 sunk?\nReserve fleet guarding retreat of 14 sailing ships and 22 galleys\nReferences\n*\n*"
