The election was won by Moussa Toybou, who defeated Mohamed Djaanfari in the second round.\nAbout 128,000 people were eligible to vote, and there were 240 polling stations. Five candidates were qualified to contest the election: Bacar Abdou (deputy for Mutsamudu), Bastoine Soulaimane (a judge and former president of the Anjouan Court of Appeal), Mohamed Djaanfari (former vice-president of the Assembly of the Union of the Comoros), Moussa Toybou (a former minister in Said Mohamed Djohar's government) and Soundi Abdoulatuf (a French military veteran). These candidates were approved by the Constitutional Court on May 20.\nVoting for the first round on 15 June, although scheduled to begin at 7am, was delayed by an hour in the main cities, Mutsamudu and Domoni, due to the late arrival of ballot papers or electoral officials. First round turnout was placed at 42.79%.\nToybou was considered a newcomer to politics. He said that he knew \"the mechanisms to lift Anjouan out of under-development\", and he supported allowing some of those who served under Bacar to remain in administrative roles due to their experience and the need for reconciliation. He also enjoyed the support of President of Comoros Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, while Djaanfari was better known to the local population due to his prior political work.\nCampaigning for the second round began on June 21. Toybou won the run-off with 52.37% to Djaanfari's 47.63%, with a turnout of 48.98%; the results had to be validated by the Constitutional Court within three days.[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i3EOIn28SbMc_LxPiBbjWCdlw62w AFP: Toybou elected Anjouan president: interim results] Djaanfari contested the result.
