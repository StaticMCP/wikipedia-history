The Primary and Secondary campus is next to S.K.H. Wei Lun Primary School and is centred around an all purpose sports pitch. The Sixth Form campus is located in Discovery Bay's North Plaza.\nCurriculum\nThe school provides kindergarten, primary and secondary education. Students in Years 10 and 11 follow the International General Certificate of Secondary Education program and pursue A levels and BTEC qualifications in Years 12 and 13.\nDBIS was the first school in Hong Kong to introduce forest and beach schools to its early years curriculum.  It has since expanded into the primary curriculum. It was one of the first schools outside of the UK to offer the Mini and Junior Duke Awards to its primary-aged students. It also runs The Hong Kong Award for Young People (HKAYP) programme for its older students.\nThe school joined the Federation of British International Schools in Asia (FOBISIA) in 2010.\nPrincipals\n* 1983–2005 Anne-Marie Naughton\n* 2006–2014 Grant Ramsay\n* 2014–2019 Paul Tough\n* 2019–2023 Stuart Bridge\n* 2023– Marc Morris\nExternal links\n*[https://juniorduke.com Junior Duke programme]\n*[https://www.ayp.org.hk/en/ HKAYP programme]\n*[https://www.fobisia.org FOBISIA]\nReferences"
