Although no rating system for computer networking conferences exists, MobiCom is generally considered to be the best conference in these areas, and it is the fifth highest-impact venue in all of Computer Science. The quality of papers published in this conference is very high. The acceptance rate of MobiCom typically around 10%, meaning that only one tenth of all submitted papers make it through the tough peer review filter.\nAccording to SIGMOBILE, \"the MobiCom conference series serves as the premier international forum addressing networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support the symbiosis of mobile computers and wireless networks.
