      "text": "# Draft:John Samuelsen, International President, Transport Workers Union of America\n\n----\nJohn Samuelsen is the International President of the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO – America’s Fightback Union – comprising 90 Local affiliates representing 160,000 workers in all of the transportation trades, including public transit, airlines, freight and commuter rail, school bus, tour bus industry and Bikeshare. Samuelsen is a member of the Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), New York State agency tasked with overseeing the operations of the New York City Transit Authority, the Long Island Rail Road, and the Metro North Commuter Railroad.\nHe earlier was elected three times as president of TWU Local 100 in New York City, the TWU’s largest Local affiliate with more than 40,000 members primarily operating and maintaining the New York City bus and subway system.\nSamuelsen is also President of the James Connolly Irish American Labor Coalition, a leading voice among American labor leaders advocating for the reunification of Ireland.\nHe is a steadfast proponent of industrial trade  unionism, as espoused by Ireland’s martyred national war hero and trade unionist James Connolly, and the TWU’s founder, Irish rebel and immigrant to America,  Michael J. Quill.\nSince his elevation to the TWU’s highest elected position in 2017, Samuelsen has brought a renewed spirit of fight-back militancy that had been a hallmark of the union, especially in its early years.\nSamuelsen, hired in 1993 as a Trackworker for the MTA-New York City Transit Authority, first made waves as a union leader by battling MTA supervisors over track safety conditions.  His advocacy and leadership as Chairman of the 2,000-member Track Division and the lead TWU Local 100 Safety Negotiator during the union’s 2002 contract campaign, delivered overhauls of the MTA’s safety policies and protocols.\nEARLY LIFE\nJohn Samuelsen was born in September 1967, the youngest of five children to [https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/01/30/dad-of-transit-labor-leader-dead-at-83/ Warren “Bunky” Samuelsen] and [https://www.nydailynews.com/2020/07/25/theresa-samuelsen-mother-of-twu-international-president-john-samuelsen-dead-at-84-after-long-illness/ Theresa Samuelsen].  He was raised in Gerritsen Beach in Southern Brooklyn, a blue-collar enclave of modest homes and bungalows off of Jamaica Bay.\nHe graduated Nazareth Regional High School in Brooklyn and attended college briefly before dropping out.\nAs a young man, he visited his family in Derry, Ireland during a time of high tensions between the largely Catholic nationalist majority and the occupying British troops.\nSamuelsen experienced the pre-Good Friday Agreement northern counties first-hand, including the curfews, random searches, roadblocks and militarized border crossings.\nDerry was the site of a major flash point of the shooting war between the Irish Republican Army and British soldiers after 14 young men and boys were shot and killed by the occupation force during a peaceful march on Sunday January 30, 1972, to protest the British policy in the north of Ireland of arrest and imprisonment without trial of anyone suspected of republican sympathies.  The incident is remembered throughout Ireland as Bloody Sunday, or the Bogside Massacre.\nThese experiences forever framed Samuelsen's advocacy in America for a reunified Ireland, free from British occupation.\nCAREER\nTWU Local 100\nSamuelsen joined the MTA-New York City Transit Authority in 1993 as a Trackworker, repairing and replacing track beds on the vast 665 miles of track and 435 stations across the City’s subway system.  [https://www.twulocal100.org TWU Local 100], the largest transportation Local union in the world, represents all hourly workers on the City’s bus and subway system including operating and maintenance titles, as well as emerging technology titles which were organized under his tenure as Local President .\nHe picked into to a track maintenance gang in Brooklyn where supervisors often ignored standing company safety rules in a relentless push to complete overnight jobs prior to the morning rush hour. Workers who spoke up against safety violations were disciplined.\nSamuelsen was threatened with discipline for refusing to work on track adjacent to the live electrified third rail without the proper rubber mat in place to protect workers against arcing and other serious accidents that could get them killed.\nCo-workers took notice of this and other confrontations between he and supervisors over safety violations.  As a result, his co-workers elected him a shop steward before he cleared probation.  “To build respect from supervision on the ground, you first have to start winning the little battles issue by issue, boss by boss,” Samuelsen later recalled.\nHe was elected Chair of the TWU Local 100 Track Division in a local-wide election in 2000.  From 2001-2006, he served as chair of the Track Safety Committee.  From 2002–2005 he was elevated to Acting Vice President of the Maintenance of Way Department, representing nearly 8,000 workers providing essential services to NYCTA in Track, Line Equipment and Signals, Power and Structure.\nDuring that time, he also served as lead negotiator for all safety-related issues during contract bargaining between Local 100 and New York City Transit.\nIn 2005, then Local 100 President Roger Toussaint fired Samuelsen from his role as acting vice president over public opposition to Toussaint’s decision to sell the union’s longtime Union Hall on Manhattan’s upper west side in the midst of a contract battle with the MTA-NYCT.  The building was sold, netting the union $45 million, far below its market value, reflected by the fact that the buyer flipped the same building a year later for millions more.\nSamuelsen went back to his tools as a Track Inspector, where he worked nights for the next few years.\nLooking back on that period in his life, Samuelsen recalls: “I’ll never be able to repay my co-workers for the way they welcomed me back. They encouraged me not to give up on union work and prodded me to continue advocating for workers. Thanks to them, I once again began to look at life through the perspective of a rank-and-file transit worker, and I will now carry that with me forever.  Getting fired and going back to the tracks was a total blessing for me in that regard.”\nIn 2009, Samuelsen formed a slate of members and officers to challenge the incumbent slate supported by Local 100 President Roger Toussaint, who had by this time moved on to a position with the TWU International Union.  Samuelsen’s ‘Take Back Our Union’ slate promised to reunify the Local after years of disruptive infighting; to put the Local back onto a solid financial footing after millions in fines and the loss of dues checkoff in the wake of the 2005 transit strike; and to go toe-to-toe with MTA management on the job, reinstituting an aggressive approach in collecting bargaining.\nSamuelsen was elected President along with the majority of candidates from his slate.  He took office on January 1, 2010, and immediately faced a challenge from the Chair of MTA, Jay Walder, who said that the MTA could not honor the union’s arbitrated contract of an 11.3 percent raise over three years.  He claimed it was too costly for the MTA during the nation’s recessionary economy.\nHe filed and won a lawsuit in New York State Court to compel the MTA to comply with the contract.  He then led a massive fightback against Walder and New York State, who were attempting to open up the Local 100 contract and gut transit workers’ medical benefits as well as stripping them of a scheduled 3.3% wage increase.\nWalder laid off nearly 1,000 transit workers in response to Local 100’s refusal to agree to concessions. As part of the unprecedented organizing campaign battle to defend the contract, the union created a special one-time fund, paid for by Local 100 members and approved by a membership vote, to cover the cost of COBRA medical insurance for the workers targeted by Walder’s layoff. The cost of the benefits was covered until every worker was recalled to the job. Many workers began to be recalled within a matter of weeks and nearly all were back by year’s end.\nSoon after, on the heels of a relentless member driven campaign exposing him as recklessly anti-worker, Walder broke with the MTA and took a job for $2 million per year to run the transit system in Hong Kong.\nSamuelsen was reelected President of Local 100 in 2012 and 2015, each time gaining a larger share of the vote.  In 2013, he began doing double duty as President of Local 100 and as Executive Vice President of the TWU International Union.  Then on May 1, 2017, Samuelsen became  President of the TWU of America.\nDuring his Local 100 administrations, Samuelsen led two multi- faceted contract campaigns resulting in negotiated agreements with the MTA that outpaced every public sector contract in wages and benefits in the City and State, including for the first time, the uniformed services of Police, Fire and Sanitation.\nThe union achieved those goals despite a toxic bargaining atmosphere of fiscal austerity. The contracts brought home numerous breakthroughs for transit workers, including lifetime spousal health care, paid parental leave, major improvements in the MTA Bus private pension plan, consolidation of all MTA Bus depots under one collective bargaining agreement (MTA bus depots were private operations for decades until their assimilation by the state-run MTA) and reduction of the 8 ½ hour day for MTA Bus maintenance workers to 8 hours with no loss in pay.\nHe also battled City Hall by taking on and defeating New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in three highly public battles.  The union fought and beat City Hall over the unjust arrest of non-negligent Bus Operators under the Mayor’s Vision Zero initiative; waged a highly successful campaign to pry more than $2.5 billion in NYC funding for the MTA Capital Plan that directly employs thousands of NYC transit workers, and helped the Central Park horse carriage industry turn back the Mayor’s plan to dissolve this beloved tourist attraction.\nHe reinvigorated the union’s organizing department and as a result brought TWU representation to 17 new properties, including Bikeshare in New York and four other cities; the MTA contracted Access-a-Ride call center in Long Island City, School bus properties in Yonkers, and numerous technical titles at the MTA.  All in all, he helped grow the by 5,000 members to its high point in its history at 46,000.\nSamuelsen revitalized the union’s financial condition, which had been decimated by massive post 2005 transit strike fines and the loss of dues checkoff.  When he took office in 2010 barely 18,000 out of 37,000 members were in good standing.  When he left office, the union was nearly 100 percent back in good standing.  He used the union’s improved finances to purchase a new union hall in downtown Brooklyn, and he rebuilt the union’s political operation in Albany and across the five boroughs of New York City.\nTWU International\nSamuelsen succeeded Harry Lombardo upon his retirement in May 2027. He was subsequently elected as President for four-year terms at the TWU’s constitutional conventions in September 2017, September 2021 and September 2025.\nHe had previously served as the International Union’s Executive Vice President from 2013 to 2017.\nSamuelsen’s first major victory as International President was an organizing triumph among the 5,000 Flight Attendants at JetBlue Airlines, the biggest organizing victory in the entire labor movement in years.\nSince then, the union has secured two collective bargaining breakthroughs that have brought major gains in wages, benefits and work rules.\nSamuelsen also aggressively pushed through a first contract for Allegiant Airlines Flight Attendants, a group that had been organized in 2015 six years prior.  Since that first agreement, the union scored another contract in 2024 that brought the carrier’s Flight Attendants pay and benefits rivaling contracts among the legacy carriers.\nHe led a major contract victory for TWU’s major work at American Airlines, including maintenance, fleet service and technical titles.  The union had been in a fight for the contract for several years, when in May 2019, [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=363455417632139 Samuelsen confronted American’s CEORobert Isom] at a company-sponsored town-hall meeting at LaGuardia Airport.  The company had been demanding concessions despite a $3 billion profit margin and intended to ship out large portions of its maintenance work overseas.  Samuelsen told Isom at the townhall that the union had no intensions of allowing either and he promised the fight to “erupt into the bloodiest, ugliest battle that the labor movement ever saw,” unless an acceptable contract was reached through negotiation.\nWithin a year and a half, the union secured a contract that catapulted the members financially with a “best in the industry” agreement.  The agreement also stopped the carrier dead in its tracks from sending maintenance work overseas.  It was an enormous breakthrough victory for American Airlines mechanics after years of bargaining, and political and court fights. At the time Samuelsen called it a “victory in our fight against the airline industry’s addiction to sending work to foreign maintenance bases.”\nIn 2019, Samuelsen vigorously defended MTA workers NYCT, Metro North and the Long Island Railroad against accusations by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who oversees the MTA’s operations, that workers were fraudulently amassing overtime payments.  The MTA even planned to use MTA police to monitor time clocks.  Samuelsen said, “This is the type of behavior you’ve engaged in that triggers strikes of the New York City Subway System.  I’m not saying that as a threat.  That’s the truth.”\nSamuelsen raised the temperature by comparing Gov. Cuomo to then President Trump.  “There’s no evidence at all of widespread criminality.  It’s a big lie.  This is what Donald Trump does.”\nIn 2020, the Covid pandemic thrust the transportation industries into a tailspin.\nIn the snap of a finger, a thriving airline industry faced economic calamity.  Amtrak, commuter railroads, and public transportation lost up to 90 percent of their ridership in a matter of days.  These events threatened widespread loss of jobs and benefits.\nThe vast majority of TWU members are essential workers.  American cities, and our nation could not forfeit the ability to move.\nSamuelsen said at the time, “society can function with closed office buildings, with shuttered night clubs and bars, with boarded up state and national parks, but America cannot function without its transit systems, its railroads and its airlines.”\nTransportation networks, along with the health care system, became central to the nation’s ability to fight back against the virus.\nSamuelsen inserted TWU into the battle being fought behind closed doors in Washington, DC.  There was a consensus in Congress that a Covid relief package was necessary to keep the country from economic collapse.  There was no consensus on how to structure the package in the best interests of the country.\nThe TWU became a key part of the negotiations for the transportation sector to keep workers getting their paychecks, and to protect the health care benefits for members who faced furloughs.\nIn total, Congress authorized $168 billion in direct aid to the transportation industry, with the unprecedented stipulation that 100 percent of this emergency aid be used for pay and job protections.  That meant that transit, airline or rail management could use the money for only one thing – paychecks.  They were barred from using it to buy new equipment or fatten their own pockets with executive bonuses or stock buybacks.  Samuelen said, “this would never have happened without the TWU’s and the labor movement’s relentless push to force Congress to do the right thing.”\nThe union’s efforts directly stopped the furloughs of an estimated 20,000 TWU members.\nFor members who were furloughed, the union fought for the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program –  legislation that initially provided $600 a week in additional unemployment benefits, and later $300 per week more.\nThe union also addressed an oversight in the bill regarding railroad unemployment, which was initially excluded from that bill.\nSamuelsen led a fight to amend the bill to include railroad workers to provide parity with state-based unemployment programs.\nHe also fought for a clause in the relief bills guaranteeing 100 percent Federal reimbursement for COBRA costs for workers who lost health care because of Covid related-job layoffs.\nSamueslen said at the time that the pandemic made America view essential transportation workers through a different lens. “Part of the Covid legacy will always be a national acknowledgement that transportation workers are essential to the entire economic structure of America.  We in TWU always knew that our members are essential workers.  Now the entire country knows.”\nIn 2024, the union negotiated an industry leading contract for its 20,000 Flight Attendants and 15,000 Ground Workers at Southwest Airlines, as well as pacesetting accords for Railroad members at Metro North Commuter Rail in New York, and Boston’s Commuter Rail, the MBTA.\nSamuelsen has reinvigorated the International Union’s presence in Washington, DC and state capitals where the union has a significant footprint.\nHe has also upped membership enthusiasm and union resources for its voluntary action committees, including the Civil and Human Rights Committee, the TWU Veterans Committee, the Working Women’s Committee and the Future Leaders Organizing Committee.\nSamuelsen is a deep believer in organizing unorganized properties, and since he joined the International Union as Executive Vice President in 2013 and President in 2017, he has helped grow the union by 20 percent."
