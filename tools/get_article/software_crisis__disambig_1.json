The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate.\nHistory\nThe term \"software crisis\" was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. Edsger Dijkstra's 1972 Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem:\nCauses\nThe causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware and the software development process. The crisis manifested itself in several ways:\n* Projects running over-budget and/or over-time\n* Inefficient, low quality software, which often did not meet requirements\n* Unmanageable projects and difficult-to-maintain code\n* Vaporware\nThe main cause is that improvements in computing power had outpaced the ability of programmers to effectively use those capabilities. Various processes and methodologies have been developed over the last few decades to improve software quality management such as procedural programming and object-oriented programming. However, software projects that are large, complicated, poorly specified, or involve unfamiliar aspects, are still vulnerable to large, unanticipated problems.\nSee also\n* AI winter\n* List of failed and overbudget custom software projects\n* Fred Brooks\n* System accident\n* Technological singularity\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD340.PDF Edsger Dijkstra: The Humble Programmer] (PDF file, 473kB)\n* Brian Randell: [http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/ The NATO Software Engineering Conferences]\n* Markus Bautsch: Cycles of Software Crises in: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080913120558/http://www.enisa.europa.eu/doc/pdf/publications/enisa_quarterly_12_07.pdf ENISA Quarterly on Secure Software] (PDF file; 1,86MB)\n* Hoare 1996, [https://www.gwern.net/docs/math/1996-hoare.pdf \"How Did Software Get So Reliable Without Proof?\"]"
