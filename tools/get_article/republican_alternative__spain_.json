The Left Republican Party (Catalan: ''Partit Republicà d'Esquerra'', PRE) is its branch in Catalonia.\nHistory\nAR was formed by Spanish Republican Democratic Action, a faction of Republican Left and the Catalan Left-wing Republican Party. The founding congress was held in Vallecas on May 25 and 26, 2013. In its Statutes, AR is ideologically defined as left-wing, democratic, republican, radical, secular, federalist and environmentalist.\nIn the municipal elections of 2015, AR gained two local councillors, Pedro Gómez in Segorbe (Valencian Community) and Gabriel Salguero Lafuente in Montgat (Catalonia).\nReferences"
