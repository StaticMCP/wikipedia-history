His many works on botany, zoology and mycology were published between 1894 and (posthumously) 1941. Some of his books on flowers were illustrated by his daughter, Mabel Emily Step, including the 1905 pocket guide entitled Wayside and Woodland Blossoms. He also contributed to the periodical Science-Gossip: An Illustrated Monthly Record of Nature, Country Lore & Applied Science.\n''Children's Encyclopædia\nWhen Arthur Mee produced the first edition of his famous Children's Encyclopædia – initially as a fortnightly series from 1908 until 1910 – Edward Step agreed to contribute the articles on plant life. There were numerous illustrations to these, but they consisted of monochrome photographs attributed to Edward Connold.\nLocust myth\nStep created a myth of a mouse-eating grasshopper in his book 'Marvels of Insect Life'' (1915), where he wrote, \"In the British Museum (Natural History) there is a specimen of one of the largest known locusts, which was received from a missionary in the Congo Free State a few years ago, who had taken it in the act of feasting upon a mouse it had caught.... The locust in question does not confine its attention to mice; large spiders, beetles and other insects, and probably small nestling birds serve it equally for food.\" In fact no grasshopper is known to feed on mice.\nStep's views on evolution are not obvious from his books. At one point he referred to \"the wonders of Creation\". However, he wrote a chapter in the same book on the giant tortoise of the Galapagos Islands that included a reference to Charles Darwin, but without a mention of evolution. Religious examples are frequent in his books, for example, quoting Beecher's \"Of all man's works of art, a cathedral is greatest; a vast and majestic tree is greater than that\", and again, \"Thousands see in cathedral aisles the reproduction in stone of the pine-forest or the beech-wood.\"\nBibliography\nThis list of publications by Step and his co-authors is arranged in chronological order by the dates of the first editions of each work. It does not include the many revisions of his books that appeared into the 1960s.\n*Step E.
