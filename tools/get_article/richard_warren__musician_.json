He also played bass on and co-engineered the band's 2008 album Songs in A&E.\nDuring 2005 to 2006, Warren released a set of five limited edition 7\" singles under the pseudonym Modlang.\nDuring 2005 to 2009, he played guitar with both Starsailor and Soulsavers with Mark Lanegan, playing guitar on the 2009 Starsailor album All the Plans and on the Soulsavers albums ''It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land and Broken. He also co-wrote two of the songs on Broken.\nIn 2008, Warren formed The Cold Light of Day, releasing the limited edition EP Flesh and Blood in April 2009.\nIn October 2009, he left The Cold Light of Day to pursue other projects and released a solo album Laments'' in July 2010, which made it into the NME's '50 best albums of the year so far' list.\nHis next album, The Wayfarer was released on 17 October 2011.\nAn alternative 'stripped down' mix of the album was issued as a cover-mount on the autumn double edition (no.78/79) of Bucketfull of Brains and nine short films containing these 'stripped down' mixes were made to accompany the album.\nJarvis Cocker said on his BBC Radio 6 Music radio show (1 January 2012), that The Wayfarer was 'one of my fave albums that came out last year'.\nWarren's third solo album Rich Black Earth was released on 4 November 2013.\nDuring 2014, Warren worked on a project called Kings of the South Seas with Ben Nicholls (Dennis Hopper Choppers, The Full English (folk music archive)) and Evan Jenkins (Neil Cowley Trio). The album Kings of the South Seas was released on 17 November 2014.\nHe also played guitar with Samantha Crain on some of her UK shows during the summer of 2014.\nWarren's fourth solo album Disentangled was released on Hudson Records on 15 September 2017.\nFranklin, the second album by Kings of the South Seas, was released on 2 February 2018.\nThe Hybirds\nBand members\nRichard Warren, Louis Divito, Darren Sheldon\nAlbums\n*The Hybirds (Heavenly 1997 HVNLP 20CDP)\n1. \"Ball of Twine\"\n2. \"24\"\n3. \"I'm Coming Out\"\n4. \"See Me Through\"\n5. \"Call Me Blue\"\n6. \"The Only Ones\"\n7. \"Born Yesterday\"\n8. \"The Wanderers\"\n9. \"Stranded\"\n10. \"Words\"\n11. \"Suzy Parker\"\n12. \"I Feel the Weight\"\nAll songs by Richard Warren .\nProduced and mixed by Ian Grimble, except 2 produced by Richard Warren/Sebastian Lewsley, mixed by Paul Schroeder, 7 mixed by Richard Warren.
