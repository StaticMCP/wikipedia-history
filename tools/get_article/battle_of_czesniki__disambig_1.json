It was an armed engagement between the Polish reserve 39th Infantry Division and a large German detachment of the 14th Army, comprising the 27th Infantry Division and 4th Light Division.\nOutcome\nThe result of the battle was inconclusive, though the Polish units successfully forced the Germans to retreat and broke through on their way from Zamość towards the Hungarian border. However, instead of breaking through towards Hungary, the division was ordered to attack towards the besieged city of Lwów. The 39th Division reached Tomaszów Lubelski but was destroyed in the Second Battle of Tomaszów several days later.\nBoth sides suffered similar losses: approximately 200 killed and 600 wounded. The Poles took some 100 Germans prisoner and captured about 150 motor vehicles and motorcycles.\nSee also\n* List of World War II military equipment of Poland\n* List of German military equipment of World War II\nReferences\n* Krzysztof Komorowski, Boje Polski 1939, Przewodnik encyklopedyczny.\n* Zygmunt Puźniak, [https://rzeczpospolitajozefowska.wordpress.com/artykuly/kampania-wrzesniowa-na-zamojszczyznie-w-okolicach-jozefowa/  Kampania wrzesniowa na zamojszczyznie w okolicach Józefowa] II kampania wrzesniowa.
