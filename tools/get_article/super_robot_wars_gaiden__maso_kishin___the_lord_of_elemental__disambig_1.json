      "text": "# Super Robot Wars Gaiden: Masō Kishin – The Lord of Elemental__disambig_1\n\n}}\nis a tactical role-playing video game developed by Winkysoft and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan on March 22, 1996 for Super Famicom.\nThe first Super Robot Wars title to give original characters the spotlight, exclusively. This particular title follows the storyline of the Masoukishin and its cast. It is the first to feature non-superdeformed graphics, unlike most Super Robot Wars titles, and the first to feature a 45° angle view of the map (widely seen since). It is also the only regular game where a unit's elevation and the direction it is facing at the end of its turn are important. Does not include other real robot or super robot series.\nMedia\nThe game has received remakes made available via Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP under the name Super Robot Wars OG Saga: Masoukishin – The Lord of Elemental.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.suparobo.jp/srw_lineup/masoukishin/index.html The Website of the Remake]"
