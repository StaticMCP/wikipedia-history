His fans named him Shahenshah-e-Zarafat\n(), meaning The Emperor of Humor or the King of Humor.\nHe was one of the most popular and highest paid actors of the 1970s and is considered one of the greatest comedians of South Asia.\nEarly life and career\nMunawar Zarif was born on 2 February 1940 in Gujranwala, Punjab. He started his film career with a Punjabi film Dandian (1961). His breakthrough film was 1964's Hath Jori. After starting as a comedian, he was promoted to playing second leads starting with the film Parday Mein Rehnay Do (1973). Subsequently, he was cast as the lead actor in films such as Banarsi Thug (1973) and Jeera Blade (1973). Possibly his most popular role was in 1974's Naukar Wohti Da, which became a runaway hit.\nHe received his first Nigar Award in \"Special Award\" category for his performance in Ishaq Deewana (1971). He won the Nigar Award in the \"Best Comedian\" category for Baharo Phool Barsao (1972) and Zeenat (1975). He appeared in more than 300 films in the span of just 15 years from 1961 to 1976. He was well-known for his Ad-Lib dialogue delivery.\nPersonal life\nMunawar Zarif was the younger brother of comedian Mohammad Zarif (1926-1960), famous in the 50s for being the first comedian in Pakistan's cinema to play lead roles, while his other brothers Rasheed Zarif (1946-1974) and Majeed Zarif (1942-2012) were also comedians in movies. Another elder brother was Munir Zarif (1934-2014), a film and TV actor famous for his roles in serials like Sona Chandi, Aalif Laila and Ainak Wala Jin, who died in 2014.\nHe was lifelong friend of fellow comedian Ali Ejaz.\nHis only son Faisal Munawar Zarif debuted as an actor with Puttar Munawar Zareef Da in 1994, followed by other movies like Puttar Jeeray Blade Da (1996) and Khotay Sikay (1998), but he couldn't find success in the film industry, so he moved to England before relocating to Morocco after marrying a Moroccan woman, where he died in 2018 of cardiac arrest at the age of 44.\nDeath\n]]\nZarif's family announced his death in Pakistan, on 29 April 1976. He died in Lahore due to cirrhosis of the liver. He was laid to rest at Bibi Pak Daman Cemetery, Lahore.\nLegacy\nMunawar Zarif is often regarded as one of the greatest comedians ever in Pakistani films. Fellow comedian and friend Ali Ejaz recalled his ability to improvise lines on the spot and called him an 'extempore' comedian. Radio Pakistan Multan programme manager Asif Khan Khaitran reminisced about the success of Munawar Zarif and said: \"There was a time in his career when writers would develop script with Munawar Zarif's personality in mind.\" Comedian Umer Shareef called him \"Mount Everest\" of comedy and said that \"for attaining fame in the field of comedy one must follow Munwer Zareef’s School of thought.\"\nFilmography\n1960s\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
