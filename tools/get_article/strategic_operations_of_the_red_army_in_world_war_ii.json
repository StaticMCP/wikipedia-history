Such operations typically involved at least one Front – the largest military formation of the Soviet Armed Forces. The operations could be defensive, offensive, a withdrawal, an encirclement, or a siege – always conducted by at least two Services of the armed forces (the ground forces and the air forces) and often included the naval forces. In most cases the Stavka divided the strategic operations into operational phases which were large operations in their own right. In very few cases the phases were tactical, such as those requiring amphibious landings.\nIntroduction\nIn Soviet historiography, the Great Patriotic War is divided into periods:\n# First (22 June 1941 – 18 November 1942)\n# Second (19 November 1942 – 31 December 1943)\n# Third (1 January 1944 – 9 May 1945)\nThe war with Japan, the Campaign in the Far East including the Manchurian strategic offensive operation, (9 August 1945 – 2 September 1945) is seen as a separate theater of operations from the Great Patriotic War.\nDuring the course of the Second World War the Red Army carried out a number of different military operations. The scope of these operations, usually known by the major cities around which they took place, was usually termed \"operational-strategic\" or \"strategic\", depending on the scale. An \"operational-strategic\" operation was usually undertaken by at least a group of Armies or a single Front. A \"strategic\" operation usually demanded cooperation of several Fronts to achieve its objectives. In both cases the operations could last from a week to several months. strategic operations were combined into seasonal campaigns, because weather and ground conditions affected planning.\nSoviet historians disagreed on which operations to classify as strategic or front-level, and the names of operations often differed between early military studies and later official histories. In the 1960s 40 strategic operations were discussed, in the 1970s this expanded to 55, and by the beginning of the 1980s, \"more than 50.\" The six-volume official History of the Great Patriotic War, published between 1960 and 1965, and the twelve-volume History of the Second World War 1939–1945, published between 1973 and 1982, did not clarify the number of strategic operations. In an attempt to resolve the discussion, the Military-Historical Journal of the Ministry of Defense published discussions during 1985 and 1986 between military historians and military leaders about strategic operations. As a result of these discussions, a list of strategic operations was developed, and the number of troops involved and durations of the operations were specified. However, this issue was not fully resolved, as the work of the commission of Grigory Krivosheyev on Soviet casualties published in 1993 contained a slightly different list of strategic operations.\nFirst period (22 June 1941 – 18 November 1942)\nSummer–Autumn campaign of 1941 (22 June – 4 December)\n* Axis Operation Barbarossa\n*Baltic operation (1941)  22 June – 9 July
