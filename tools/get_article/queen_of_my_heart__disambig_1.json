It was released on 5 November 2001 as the first single from their third studio album, World of Our Own (2001). It was released as a double A-side single with \"When You're Looking Like That\" in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\nThe song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, giving the band their ninth UK number-one single in two and a half years. It became the 23rd-best-selling single of 2001 in the UK and received a gold sales certification in the UK for over 400,000 copies sold. It is the band's eighth-best-selling single in paid-for sales and ninth-best-selling single in combined sales in the UK as of January 2019.\nBackground\nThe song was written by John McLaughlin, Wayne Hector, Steve Robson and Steve Mac and was produced by Mac. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in B major, with Brian McFadden's, Shane Filan's, and Mark Feehily's vocals ranging from the chords of B3 to B♭5. In an interview, Kian said that the song was about a person who wants to go back to their soulmate whom they have been away from for a long time.\nDuring live performances, the song is sometimes introduced with a military-style drumbeat and features more prominent arrangements, including bagpipes, a choir, accordion, flute, and strings, lending it a richer, more cinematic texture. Following McFadden’s departure, Kian and Nicky assumed his vocal parts in subsequent renditions, maintaining the song’s signature harmonies.\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Queen of My Heart\" was directed by Max & Dania. It features the members of Westlife in a castle with Filan and Kian Egan in one room, Feehily and Nicky Byrne in another room, and McFadden sitting on the stairs alone. During the video, Nicky shaves his hair, giving himself a buzz cut. Towards the end of the video, many fans appear and surround the band members. There are two alternate starts of the video: a first view of the castle, and another with rain and a lightning strike of the place.\nTrack listings\n* UK CD1\n# \"Queen of My Heart\" (radio edit)\n# \"When You're Looking Like That\" (single remix)\n# \"Reason for Living\"\n# \"When You're Looking Like That\" (CD ROM video)\n* UK CD2\n# \"Queen of My Heart\" (radio edit)\n# \"When You're Looking Like That\" (single remix)\n# \"Interview\" (CD ROM)\n* UK cassette single\n# \"Queen of My Heart\" (radio edit)\n# \"When You're Looking Like That\" (single remix)\n* European CD single\n# \"Queen of My Heart\" (radio edit)\n# \"Reason for Living\"\nCredits and personnel\nCredits are lifted from the UK CD1 liner notes.\nRecording\n* Recorded at Olympic Studios (London)\nPersonnel\n* Steve Mac – writing, production, arrangement, mixing, piano, keyboards\n* John McLaughlin – writing\n* Steve Robson – writing\n* Wayne Hector – writing, additional backing vocals\n* Chris Laws – Pro Tools engineering, engineering, drums\n* Matt Howe – recording, mixing engineer\n* Daniel Pursey – assistant engineering\n* Quentin Guine – assistant engineering\n* Lee McCutcheon – Pro Tools engineering\n* Steve Pearce – bass\n* Frizzy Karlsson – guitars\n* Paul Gendler – guitars\n* Mae McKenna – additional backing vocals\n* Eddie Hession – accordion\n* Bob White – bagpipes\n* Gavin Wright – strings\n* Alice Holsgrove – choir\n* Christopher Baptiste – choir\n* Daniel Udy – choir\n* Hannah Baptiste – choir\n* Henry Verbi – choir\n* Laura Taylor – choir\n* Lee Raymond – choir\n* Louise Raymond – choir\n* Mathew Taylor – choir\n* Rachael Holsgrove – choir\n* Rebekah Holsgrove – choir\n* Samuel Udy – choir\n* Samuel Verbi – choir\n* Victoria Verbi – choir\n* Kim Chandler – conducting\n* Dave Arch – orchestral arrangement\n* Dick Beetham – mastering\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2001–2002)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|8\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (European Hit Radio)\n|17\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Guatemala (Notimex)\n|2\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Nicaragua (Notimex)\n|5\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100)\n|24\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Spain (Top 40 Radio)\n|align=\"center\"|28\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2001)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Ireland (IRMA)\n|14\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Hitlistan)\n|51\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|23\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2002)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Hitlistan)\n|94\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Taiwan (Hito Radio)\n|43\n|}\nCertifications and sales\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.westlife.com Official Westlife website]"
