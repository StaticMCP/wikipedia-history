In honor of Jackson, BET announced, through their website, that the awards show would be changed to honor Jackson's contributions.\nThe ceremony began with R&B group New Edition performing a mash up of Jackson 5 hits, including ABC, which gained a standing ovation from the entire audience. Throughout the event, various artists performed covers of Jackson's hit singles, such as Ne-Yo's take on \"The Lady in My Life\", Ciara's cover of \"Heal the World\", and Keke Palmer's a cappella version of \"Who's Loving You\". In addition, many award winners thanked Jackson in their acceptance speeches, such as Lil Wayne, Beyoncé, and Jamie Foxx, who stated, \"We want to celebrate this black man. He belongs to us and we shared him with everyone else.\" Foxx also paid homage by changing into multiple Michael Jackson-inspired outfits, like Jackson's silver glove and red Thriller jacket.\nTowards the end of the night, Jackson's younger sister, Janet Jackson, made an emotional, surprise appearance, stating, \"To you, Michael is an icon. To us, Michael is family and he will forever live in all of our hearts [...] On behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much, thank you so much.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bet.com/shows/bet-awards/2009.html Official website]"
