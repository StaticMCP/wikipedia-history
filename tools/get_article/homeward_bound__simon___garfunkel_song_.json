It was written by Paul Simon and produced by Bob Johnston. Simon wrote the song during his time in England, possibly while waiting for a train at Widnes railway station in the northwest of England, and though the station in question was thought to have been Widnes Central, there is a plaque commemorating this at Widnes Station.\n\"Homeward Bound\" appears on the duo's third studio album, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), although it was recorded during the sessions for their second album, Sounds of Silence and included on that album in the UK. It was their second single, the follow-up to their breakthrough hit \"The Sound of Silence\". \"Homeward Bound\" performed very well domestically, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 12 weeks. It reached number two in Canada, and was a top-five hit in the Netherlands.\nA live version of \"Homeward Bound\" is included on the 1972 compilation ''Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits. Simon and Garfunkel performed it at their 1981 reunion the Concert in Central Park.\nWriting\n\"Homeward Bound\" was written by the American songwriter Paul Simon after he returned to England in early 1964. He had previously spent time in Essex, and he became a nightly fixture at the Railway Hotel in Brentwood, beginning that April. He was reeling from his brief period in the folk scene in Greenwich Village, New York, and the recording of his first album with Art Garfunkel, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.'', which he anticipated would be a failure.\nDuring his time in England, Simon met Kathy Chitty, who was working as a ticket-taker at the club. The two quickly became close, but Simon wanted to perform in London. Following a performance in the town of Widnes, Cheshire, Simon was dropped off at Widnes railway station for a train to his next performance, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He had been missing Chitty and he began to write \"Homeward Bound\" on a scrap of paper. A plaque commemorating the song is displayed on the Widnes station platform.\nOther locations for the writing of the song have been suggested. Simon's friend Geoff Speed, with whom Simon stayed in Liverpool in September 1965, said he heard Simon writing the song when he was staying at his home. Speed then dropped him at Widnes railway station; he said it was likely that Simon wrote one verse in Liverpool and the chorus in Wigan, and finished the song at the station. In 2016, Simon said he wrote the song in a railway station near Liverpool, and said it might have been Warrington.\nChitty is mentioned in several other Simon & Garfunkel songs, most notably \"Kathy's Song\" and \"America\". In the 1969 song \"The Boxer\", Simon alludes to a railway station, a possible reference to \"Homeward Bound\".\nReception\nBillboard described the song as an \"interesting off-beat rhythm number\".  Cash Box described the single as a \"catchy, low-down blues-tinged folk-styled ode about a wanderin’ lad who is finally going back to his hometown gal\" that \"should speedily move up the hitsville path.\" Record World called it \"a haunting, sad song.\"\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
