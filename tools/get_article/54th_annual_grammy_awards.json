LL Cool J hosted the show. It was the first time in seven years that the event had an official host. Nominations were announced on November 30, 2011, on prime-time television as part of \"The GRAMMY Nominations Concert Live! – Countdown to Music's Biggest Night\", a one-hour special broadcast live on CBS from Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live. Kanye West received the most nominations with seven. Adele, Foo Fighters, and Bruno Mars each received six nominations. Lil Wayne, Skrillex, and Radiohead all earned five nominations. The nominations were criticised by many music journalists as Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy missed out on a nomination for Album of the Year despite being highly critically acclaimed and topping many end of year charts. West's album went on to win  Best Rap Album.\nA total of 78 awards were presented following the Academy's decision to restructure the Grammy Award categories. Paul McCartney received the MusiCares Person of the Year award on February 10, 2012, at the Los Angeles Convention Center, two nights prior to the Grammy telecast.\nOn February 8, 2012, the Academy announced that the 54th Grammy Pre-Telecast Ceremony would stream live internationally. The ceremony took place at the Los Angeles Convention Center and was streamed live in its entirety internationally at Grammy's official website and CBS Television Network. The ceremony was co-hosted by Dave Koz and MC Lyte. A total of 68 awards were presented in the Pre-Telecast ceremony. The official poster was designed by architect Frank Gehry.\nThe day before the ceremony, Whitney Houston died in Los Angeles, and the show's producers quickly planned a tribute in the form of Jennifer Hudson singing Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\". The awards show began with a Bruce Springsteen performance followed by an LL Cool J prayer for Whitney Houston. Adele won all of her six nominations, equalling the record for most wins by a female artist in one night, first held by Beyoncé. Adele became only the second artist in history, following Christopher Cross in 1981, to have won all four of the general field (Album of the Year, Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year) awards throughout her career. Foo Fighters and Kanye West followed with five and four awards, respectively. With his win for Best Musical Theater Album (for The Book of Mormon: Original Broadway Cast Recording), producer Scott Rudin became the 11th person to become an EGOT winner.\nRatings\nThe anticipation for the show's tributes to the late Whitney Houston greatly helped increase the ratings for the 54th Grammy Awards, which became the second highest in its history with 39.9 million viewers (trailing only behind the 1984 Grammys with 51.67 million viewers). The rating was 50% higher than in 2011. This remains the highest-rated Grammy telecast on 21st-century U.S. television.\nPre-telecast\nPerformers\n* Kim Burrell, Le'Andria Johnson, Kelly Price and Trin-I-Tee 5:7\n* Joyce DiDonato\n* Steve Earle\n* Rebirth Brass Band\n*The Civil Wars\nPresenters\n* Gerald Clayton\n* Chick Corea\n* Brandon Heath\n* Arturo O'Farrill\n* OK Go\n* Corinne Bailey Rae\n* Esperanza Spalding\n* Jimmy Jam\nMain telecast\nPerformers\nThe following performed:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n|Bruce SpringsteenThe E Street Band\n|\"We Take Care of Our Own\"\n|-\n|Bruno Mars\n|\"Runaway Baby\"\n|-\n|Alicia KeysBonnie Raitt\n|Tribute to Etta James\"A Sunday Kind of Love\"\n|-\n|Chris Brown\n|\"Turn Up the Music\"\"Beautiful People\"\n|-\n|Jason AldeanKelly Clarkson\n|\"Don't You Wanna Stay\"\n|-\n|Foo Fighters\n|\"Walk\"\n|-\n| RihannaColdplay\n|\"We Found Love\"\"Princess of China\"\"Paradise\"\n|-\n|Maroon 5Foster the PeopleThe Beach Boys\n|'''Celebrating the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary'''\"Surfer Girl\"\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\"\"Good Vibrations\"\n|-\n|Paul McCartneyDiana KrallJoe Walsh\n|\"My Valentine\"\n|-\n|The Civil Wars\n|\"Barton Hollow\"\n|-\n|Taylor Swift\n|\"Mean\"\n|-\n|Katy Perry\n|\"E.T.\"\"Part of Me\"\n|-\n|Adele\n|\"Rolling in the Deep\"\n|-\n|The Band PerryBlake SheltonGlen Campbell\n|Homage to Glen Campbell\"Gentle on My Mind\"\"Southern Nights\"\"Rhinestone Cowboy\"\n|-\n|Tony BennettCarrie Underwood\n|\"It Had to Be You\"\n|-\n|Jennifer Hudson\n|Tribute to Whitney Houston\"I Will Always Love You\"\n|-\n|Chris BrownDavid GuettaLil WayneFoo Fightersdeadmau5\n|\"I Can Only Imagine\"\"Rope\"\"Raise Your Weapon\"\n|-\n|Nicki Minaj\n|\"Roman's Revenge\" (Intro)\"Roman Holiday\"\n|-\n|Paul McCartney Bruce SpringsteenDave GrohlJoe WalshRusty AndersonBrian RayPaul WickensAbe Laboriel Jr.\n|\"Golden Slumbers\"\"Carry That Weight\"\"The End\"\n|}\n* Maceo Parker was scheduled to pay tribute to Clarence Clemons following the montage of those that had died in 2011 although his tribute was dropped in the 24 hours leading up to the awards show to make room for the Jennifer Hudson tribute to Whitney Houston.\nPresenters\n*Alicia Keys & Bonnie Raitt - Best Pop Solo Performance\n*LL Cool J - Introduces Chris Brown\n*Fergie & Marc Anthony - Best Rap Performance\n*Reba McEntire - Introduces Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson\n*Jack Black - Introduces the Foo Fighters\n*LL Cool J - Introduces Rihanna and Coldplay\n*Mario Manningham, Victor Cruz & Pauley Perrette - Best Rock Performance\n*Ryan Seacrest - Pays tribute to the Beach Boys and introduces Maroon 5, Foster the People, and the remaining members of the Beach Boys\n*Stevie Wonder - Plays Love Me Do on the harmonica and introduced Paul McCartney.\n*Common & Taraji P.
