Ten days before, all three parties agree to be merged and re-founded as a new party.\nOriginally, the party was planned to be formed as the Democratic Unified Party () on 17 February. However, on the day of the agreement, the Bareunmirae President Sohn Hak-kyu showed his objection. In addition, on 18 February, the National Election Commission did not allow the upcoming party to use the name as it sounds similar to the extra-parliamentary United Democratic Party.\nAll three parties then again signed the agreement after the leaderships of all of them decided to resign on 20 February. On 24 February, 3 parties were finally merged and officially re-founded with the current name.\nIt lost all seats in the 2020 election.\nIn the 2021 by-elections, the party President Lee Su-bong contested for the Seoul mayorship. Despite having less support than the Democratic and People Power Party candidates, he was able to appear on television debates, as the predecessor Bareunmirae Party's candidate received 19.55% of the vote in the previous mayoral election. He received 0.23% of the vote, far behind the Democratic and People Power Party candidates.\nOn 19 April 2021, the former party president Kim Jung-hwa made an announcement to quit the party, although she mentioned that she has no willingness to retire from politics.\nOn 4 May 2021, Lee Su-bong was suspended from the party for a year.\nOn February 8, 2024, Kim Jong-ki, the acting chairman of the DPP's emergency committee, declared the party's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development.\nOn March 15, the committee suggested renaming the party to \"Climate People's Democratic Party,\" in line with the party constitution. The Central Election Commission confirmed the name change on March 19. Former Chairman Seo Jin-hee was elected as the new party chairman, with Lee Seung-han, Lee Jin, and Nae-hoon as supreme committee members, and Lee Ki-hyun as the National Party Congress chairman. On March 20, Kim Jong-ki released a commentary titled \"The Climate People's Party is a party that protects life, democracy, human rights, and the livelihood of ordinary people,\" which was disseminated via media outlets. According to a court search, an appeal was lodged following the Supreme Court's 2024 decision, case number 2024 Na 2015771. Finally, on March 22, Seo Jin-hee was officially announced as the representative following the resolution from March 19, and the general secretary position was declared vacant.\nOn April 17, 2025, the party reverted to the 2018 name, Party for Democracy and Peace, in an attempt to rebrand after party leader Seo Jin-hee was charged with adultery and violating the Political Funding Act. Seo also tried to hide the fact that she was indited on charges of wasted nearly 10 billion won (US$7 million) in political funds from party members in an effort to keep her position as leader of the Party.\nPolitical position\nThe party has a support base among elderly and socially conservative Christians in the Honam region. The Democratic Peace Party, a former Honam regionalist party, strongly opposed abortion, but Minsaeng Party has no official position on abortion.\nOn the LGBT issue, MPs expressed their opposition to same-sex marriage, but criticized some socially conservative members of the Democratic Party of Korea for hostile tendencies toward LGBT people.\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Leader\n! colspan=\"3\" | Constituency\n! colspan=\"3\" | Party list\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Position\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Status\n|-\n!
