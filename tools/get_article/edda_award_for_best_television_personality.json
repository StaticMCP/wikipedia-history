The award was first presented at the 2nd Edda Awards in 2000 and has been a part of the awards every year since. The result is decided by the Icelandic public, which is able to vote for their favorite person on television online in a small time period up to the awards. In recent years the award has become highly sought after by the television nominees and they can be quite competitive towards one another up to the award ceremony.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n|-\n|2000\n|Erpur Eyvindarson\n|-\n|2001\n|Logi Bergmann Eiðsson\n|-\n|2002\n|Sveppi\n|-\n|2003\n|Gísli Marteinn Baldursson\n|-\n|2004\n|Ómar Ragnarsson\n|-\n|2005\n|Silvía Night (Silvía Nótt)\n|-\n|2006\n|Ómar Ragnarsson\n|-\n|2007\n|Egill Helgason\n|-\n|2008\n|Egill Helgason\n|-\n|2010\n|Thóra Arnórsdóttir\n|-\n|2011\n|Gísli Einarsson\n|-\n|2012\n|Jóhannes Kr.
