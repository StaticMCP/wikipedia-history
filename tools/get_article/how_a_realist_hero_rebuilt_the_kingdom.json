The story follows Kazuya Souma, a humanities-student-turned-hero as he pulls on his knowledge of political realism in order to rebuild the kingdom. A manga adaptation by Satoshi Ueda began serialization online on Overlap's Comic Gardo manga website in July 2017. Digital publisher J-Novel Club has licensed both the light novel and manga for an English release. An anime television series adaptation by J.C.Staff aired from July 2021 to April 2022.\nPlot\nKazuya Souma is a young man who is suddenly transported to another world where he is informed by Albert Elfrieden, the king of the Elfrieden Kingdom, that he is abdicating the throne to him. He is also informed that he has been betrothed to Albert's daughter, Liscia. Deciding he is going to rebuild the country's struggling economy, Kazuya gathers talented citizens who are going to help him with the reform.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n;\n: }}\n: Summoned to another world to reportedly deal with the threat of the Demon Lord's Domain, Kazuya instead finds himself with the throne of the Kingdom of Elfrieden and the hand of Liscia Elfrieden forced on him. Now acting king, Kazuya begins radical reforms in order to improve the standard of living in the kingdom. In the One Week War, Kazuya finds himself in a civil war between himself and Dukes Georg Carmine and Castor Vargas while also having to fight the Principality of Amidonia. Through a series of military strategies, Kazuya emerges victorious and annexes Amidonia (although this was unplanned on his part) to create the Unified Kingdom of Elfrieden and Amidonia, otherwise known as the Kingdom of Friedonia. He then forges a secret alliance with Empress Maria Euphoria of the Gran Chaos Empire. Although he cannot do much combat, he is capable of wielding dark magic. Before his summoning, he was an avid reader. One of his most read and quoted books is The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli.\n;\n:\n: The crown princess of the Elfrieden Kingdom and Kazuya's first fiancée, Liscia was at Kazuya's side from the very beginning. Initially dissatisfied with the unannounced engagement, Liscia soon softens and eventually develops deep feelings for Kazuya. Following the end of the One Week War, both Kazuya and Liscia affirm their love for each other, which results with the beginning of a series of nightly activities. Liscia is tolerant of Kazuya's many female admirers, even encouraging him to take more wives. However, she remains adamant about wanting to remain the first wife.\n;\n: |Emily Fajardo|Morgan Garrett}}\n: Also known as Lady Canaria of the Elfrieden Navy's Marine force, Juna is the granddaughter of Duchess Excel Walter, who was sent to spy on Kazuya when he was first announced as the new King. She is one of the five people discovered during the gathering of the Gifted People. She primarily aids Kazuya in both war and in peace by being the Prima Lorelei, Kazuya's implementation of the concept of the Japanese idol. After falling in love with Kazuya, she is secretly made into his third fiancée with the reason for withholding the fact of their betrothal is the possibility of starting riots when the commonfolk discovers that the famous idol is being wed.\n;\n: |Jad Saxton|Howard Wang|Jim Foronda}}\n: The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the Elfriedon Kingdom, Poncho is one of the five people discovered during the gathering of the Gifted People. Due to his vast knowledge of edible delicacies, he was a key player in ending the food shortages in the kingdom. Kazuya has given him the name of Ishizuka.\n;\n:\n: A member of the Mystic Wolf race and one of the five people discovered during the gathering of the Gifted People, Tomoe possesses the rare ability to speak to all manner of beasts and animals. When it was revealed that she could speak to a demon, Kazuya immediately recognized her as extremely valuable and she was adopted by Albert and Elisha Elfrieden in order to shelter her, in the process, becoming Kazuya's sister-in-law-to-be and Liscia's adoptive sister.\n;\n: |Kellen Goff}}\n: Son of the noble house of Magna and member of the Elfrieden Army under Duke Georg Carmine. He met Kazuya when the king overheard an argument between Halbert and his childhood friend Kaede Foxia. Rather than being arrested for Lese Majeste, Halbert was instead transferred to the Forbidden Army, under Kazuya's jurisdiction. The two have since become friends, and Halbert is one of the few people permitted to disregard the rules of royal etiquette with Kazuya and carry on a casual conversation. In the aftermath of the Storm Crisis, it is revealed that he and Kaede got engaged. He is also partnered with Ruby, a Red Dragon of the Star Dragon Mountain Range.\n;\n: |Anjali Kunapaneni}}\n: A member of the Mystic Fox race, Kaede is the daughter of the noble house of Foxia, and childhood friend to Halbert Magna. She is an intelligent and talented young woman, and a mage in the Forbidden Army specializing in Earth Magic. She is currently serving as a staff officer under Captain Ludwin Arcs and is Hal's direct superior, a situation that both pleases and irritates the both of them at times. Kaede cares deeply for Hal, and she spoke in his defense when the two first met Kazuya. In the aftermath of the Storm Crisis, it is revealed that she is engaged to Halbert when she chastises him for unthinkingly riding on Ruby's back.\n;\n: |Daman Mills}}\n: Captain of the Royal Guard and Commander of the Forbidden Army under the direct command of Kazuya. He is a popular man in Kazuya's royal court, but despite his looks and position, remains unattached. This is mainly due to rumors of financial trouble, as Ludwin is often seen eating the cheapest items on offer in the castle's cafeteria. He is childhood friends with Genia Maxwell, whom he regards with a brotherly affection, despite her eccentricity. After Kazuya realizes Genia's usefulness as an inventor, he and Liscia pressure Ludwin into an engagement to Genia, which he shyly accepts.\n;\n: |Steph Garrett}}\n: Last of the noble house of Maxwell, and childhood friend of Ludwin. She is an eccentric genius and self-proclaimed Overscientist, specializing in the study of technology and artifacts discovered in the various dungeons found throughout the world. Her talents have been recognized by Kazuya, and the king is currently seeking to develop and implement several of her inventions for the good of the kingdom. In order to ensure her safety and continued loyalty, Kazuya and Liscia convince Ludwin and Genia to get engaged, which Genia shows some minor affections for, but states that she was certain that it would happen someday.\n;\n:\n: A sea serpent who is over 500 years old at the time of Kazuya's summoning. Despite her age, as a member of a \"long-lived\" race she still has the appearance of a human in her mid-to-late twenties. She is the Admiral of the Kingdom of Elfrieden's Navy, based in Lagoon City of the Walter Duchy. She is the only one of the three duchies to publicly side with Kazuya during the Civil War.\n;\n:\n: A dragonewt and the General of the Kingdom of Elfrieden's Air Force. He is a loyal and skilled warrior, yet is impulsive to action. As the head of the Vargas Duchy, he opted during the Civil War to have the Air Force take a neutral stance, but publicly supported Duke Carmine with his personal members of the Air Force. In his youth, he attempted to engage in romantic relations with Duchess Excel Walter, but was rejected. He ended up marrying one of the duchess's daughters, making him her son-in-law. Though defeated and enslaved by Kazuya using a slave collar during the Civil War, Kazuya decided to spare Castor from execution for his treason.\n;\n: |Madeleine Morris}}\n: A dragonewt and daughter of Castor. She is Castor's eldest child, also having a younger brother named Carl. She is friends with Liscia from their time together at the military academy. Despite Liscia's attempts to use Carla's connection to Castor, Liscia was unable to convince both to support Kazuya during the Civil War. Carla sided with her father during the Civil War despite Castor's attempt to disinherit her along with her mother and brother as to spare her from potential treason charges. They are defeated by Kazuya, who outfits her with a slave collar that forces her to ally with him. Kazuya decided to likewise spare Carla from execution for treason, forcing her to become one of the royal families maids instead. Despite this fall from grace, she has remained in good terms with him and Liscia who still sees her as a friend regardless.\n;\n:\n: A lion-headed beastman and General of the Kingdom of Elfrieden's Army. He was a loyal vassal, a widely respected tactician, and a mentor to Liscia. However, during the Civil War, he was the public opposition to Kazuya's reign as king. It is revealed after being defeated during the Civil War that he actually supported Kazuya's decisions, but was sacrificing himself to be a rally point for Kazuya's domestic enemies within the nobility of Elfrieden. Though he would be sentenced to be executed for treason, Kazuya offered him \"poisoned wine\" to escape his sentence. Though officially dead, according to an Elfrieden news report, a leader of Kazuya's personal spy network, the Black Cats, looks suspiciously like the \"late\" duke.\n;\n: |Keith Silverstein|Caleb Yen}}\n: The former Minister of Finance of Amidonia and current Minister of Finance of Friedonia. Along with Roroa, he attempted to dissuade Gaius and Julius Amidonia from invading Elfrieden but was unsuccessful, resulting in the One Week War. Before conflict could occur, he disappeared from the Amidonian capital of Van along with Roroa and several other bureaucrats loyal to her. During the Amidonian revolution, he returned with the others and was granted his current position by Kazuya.\nPrincipality of Amidonia\n;\n:\n: The last sovereign prince of the Principality of Amidonia, Gaius Amidonia the Eighth is one of the major players during the One Week War. Having trespassed the southwestern border of Elfrieden, Gaius laid siege to the city of Altomura. In a clever plan crafted by Kazuya, Hakuya, and Georg Carmine, Elfrieden was able to outwit Gaius, forcing him to flee back into Amidonia proper. In the subsequent battle, Kazuya himself ended Gaius's life but not before Gaius instructed his son to keep the flames of vengeance burning. Gaius's death resulted in the Elfrieden occupation of Amidonia's capital city, Van.\n;\n:\n: The son of Gaius and the older brother of Roroa, Julius Amidonia is the prince who hastily inherited his post from his father prior to his death. However, after negotiations with the Gran Chaos Empire ended and Julius was given back his country to govern, rebellions soon rose up due to his ineffective and harsh leadership. Julius himself was driven out of the country, fleeing to the Empire, and with Roroa's intervention, the Principality of Amidonia was annexed into Elfrieden with the added bonus of Princess Roroa's hand in marriage.\nGran Chaos Empire\n;\n:\n: Known as the Saint, Maria is the Empress of the Gran Chaos Empire. Having held up the Declaration of Mankind's Common Front Against the Demon Race, simply, the Mankind Declaration, she is Kazuya's idealistic opposite. After the One Week War and the annexation of Amidonia, Kazuya and Maria forged a secret alliance in order to prepare for a full-on war with the Demon Lord's Domain.\n;\n:\n: The younger sister of Maria, she was the one sent by the Gran Chaos Empire to take part in the negotiations of the Kingdom of Elfrieden and the Principality of Amidonia.

After Naden's return, she was the first to decide to help Naden in order to restore her pride in herself. Despite her inability to utilize her wings in the storm, with the assistance of Halbert, she plunged into the storm and aided Naden for several moments before carrying a message to the other dragons. As during these events Halbert rode on her back, Ruby was no longer considered chaste and was contract partnered with Halbert with the blessing of the Mother Dragon.\n;\n: A white dragon and the only one that Naden considers a friend.
