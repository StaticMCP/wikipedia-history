He performed his song \"All Day\" amongst a large entourage including grime musicians Skepta, Stormzy, Krept and Konan, Jammer and Novelist. The entourage held flamethrowers and wore all black. However, his performance was repeatedly muted throughout most of the track for those watching on television due to the extreme explicit language featured within the song's lyrics, with the use of \"nigga\" being repeatedly rapped live on ITV.\nThe performance drew mixed reactions from the crowd, with presenters Ant & Dec joking about it afterwards, and divided opinions on social media; some criticising West's performance and some criticising how ITV dealt with the issue.\nMadonna incident\nMadonna was the last to perform on the night, singing a version of her song \"Living for Love\" to close the show and mark her first Brits performance in 20 years. Shortly into her performance, a problem with her costume caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage.\nShe later took to Instagram to confirm that she was uninjured, posting \"Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine\". It was later revealed that her cape was tied too tightly when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, causing her to crash to the floor and leaving the audience in shock.\nAfter several seconds, she continued the performance as planned.\nBrit Awards 2015 album\nThe Brit Awards 2015 is a compilation and box set which includes the \"63 biggest tracks from the past year\". The box set has three discs with a total of sixty-three songs by various artists.\nTrack listing\nCD 1\nCD 2\nCD 3\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! Chart (2015)\n!
