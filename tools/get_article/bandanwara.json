It consisted of twenty-one villages. It covered an area of 34,845 bighas (approximately 21,603.90 acres).\nHistory\nMokal Singh, the Maharana of Mewar, is said to have taken Ajmer and Sambhar from the Sultan of Delhi, and he granted the village of Badanwara for the maintenance of a temple of Eklingji. Chandra Sen, an ancestor of the Rao of Badanwara, succeeded his father, Maldeo, as the Rao of Marwar. He refused to acknowledge Akbar’s suzerainty and was ousted from Jodhpur by his son Udai Singh. He attempted to recover Jodhpur but failed, and thereafter resorted to pillaging in areas acquired by the Mughal armies. A grandson of Karma Sen, through his son Ugar Sen (also known as Agar Sen), came to Ajmer and was received with a feast by a Bhil who held eighty-four villages, including Bhinai. However, Karma Sen  killed his host and took possession of his host’s property. Akbar later confirmed Karma Sen in this possession.\nThe estate of Bhinai was partitioned several times, and in one generation from the founder of that estate came Udai Bhan. He granted three villages of the estate to his adopted son, Narsingh Das, for his maintenance. After his demise, his biological sons, Kesri Singh and Suraj Mal, quarrelled, and the estate of Bhinai was partitioned. Suraj Mal received ten villages in his appanage and subsequently founded Bandanwara in 1667.\nRulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n(Birth – Death)\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Note(s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Reference\n|-\n!Start date\n!End date\n|-\n|Suraj Mal I\n|\n|\n|He went to Delhi and entered the service of Aurangzeb in 1659. He rendered valuable military service and was granted the mansab of 3,500 hazari along with an elephant. Aurangzeb had Suraj Mal’s paternal estate of Bhinai partitioned between him and his brothers. Aurangzeb also granted him Ramsar and Srinagar as jagir. These two were, however, later taken away by Ajit Singh of Jodhpur, as the Thakur of Bandanwara did not go in Peshwai.\n| rowspan=\"12\" |\n|-\n|Amar Singh\n|\n|\n|He retained Bandanwara, and his younger brothers received Padlan, Jaola, Kalyanpura, Jotayan, and Amargarh.
