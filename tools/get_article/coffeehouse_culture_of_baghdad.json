Ever since their inception in the 1500s, cafés have acted as social forums and gathering grounds for friends and meetings for all ages as well as a gathering ground for intellectuals, thinkers, and personalities to discuss politics, art, literature, science, poetry, and other subjects that had a great impact on Iraq's cultural and literary life while consuming tea or coffee.\nCultural Baghdadi coffeehouses have been thriving since their demands grew in the 17th century and continued into the 20th century, especially in al-Rashid Street, which saw many of these coffeehouses materialize along the street and in the city. The majority of those coffeehouses, which bear witness to cultural, social, and political changes that have marked Iraq's modern history, have since been closed. Although many heritage and new traditional coffeehouses are still open. The most popular of these is the Shabandar Café in al-Mutanabbi Street.\nEven though the coffeehouse culture is mostly associated with and active in Baghdad, the culture is spread throughout Iraq and examples can be found such as in Sulaymaniyah, Erbil and Karbala.\nHistory\nOttoman Era (16th–19th centuries)\nAccording to Iraqi historians, the first Baghdadi coffeehouse was named \"Khan Jahan\" and was established in 1590 under Ottoman rule by Cığalazade Sinan Pasha for a man named \"Ismail Effendi\". This coffeehouse was located behind al-Mustansiriya Madrasa. From the 17th century to the mid-18th century, there was a high demand for coffeehouses in the neighborhoods of Baghdad, which is believed to be the origin of the culture surrounding these establishments. 1604 saw construction of the Hassan Pasha Café near al-Wazeer Mosque, which contributed to the spread and demands of coffeehouses.\nAlongside mosques, the coffeehouse became a meeting space, especially a secular one, and a meeting ground for military officers and the civil rulers of Baghdad. By the end of the seventeenth century, there were ten coffeehouses in Baghdad, with five being located on al-Maidan Square, mostly due to trading and military services, while the rest were either located next to the banks of the Tigris river or the souks. It was also a recruitment space for various factional groups looking for followers or support.\nCoffeehouses started to spread around the city and its outskirts. The number of coffeehouses in Baghdad reached 184, according to what was indicated by the Baghdad Code of 1882, and by 1903, the number had increased to 285. This increase called for competition between coffeehouse owners to win the largest number of customers, some owners turned to discotheques for the competition. What helped in this matter was the declaration of the Ottoman constitution in 1908 about giving relative freedoms to the religious and national communities of the states that were under the control of the Ottomans, and many of the restrictions imposed on the press were lifted. Coffeehouse competitors hired well-known Iraqi singers to play Iraqi maqam and reciters to attract customers, as well as storytellers and actors who put on fantasy shows. However, some coffeehouses developed their own performances, notably those around al-Maidan Square. Some owners went as far as hiring female dancers and singers from Egypt, and the Levant, and this recruitment was considered a shift in public social morals at the time. Some owners even altered the buildings' structures to accommodate a stage to be built. Coffeehouses also started to become crowded during the evening nights of Ramadan and games were played such as those that involved the traditional Iranian zurkhāneh.|250x250px|left]]The main material offered by the coffeehouses was hot tea in addition to coffee. Some coffeehouses offered sweets and cold drinks. Seating places in Baghdadi coffeehouses consist of sofas called \"Takhts\" which were made of wood. As for hot tea, it is served by a mug which was named \"al-Istikkan\" by the locals of Baghdad, and the tools for making tea consisted of a teapot called \"quri\", and a hot water tank with a faucet.\nEuropean traveler James Silk Buckingham documented several of these coffeehouses during his visit to Baghdad in 1819, notably the Hassan Pasha Café and al-Beiruti Café, which caught his attention due to their lights that covered the Tigris River. Buckingham also documented that coffeehouses were so common that there were already two established coffeehouses next to one of the gates of Baghdad, and that they were usually crowded mostly at night.\nTransformation post-independence of Iraq (1920s–1970s)\n's portrait can be found in many Baghdadi coffeehouses even to this day.]]\nDuring the Royal era of Iraq, coffeehouses became a phenomenon and a sign of political and literary transformation. They became places where the educated class and the pioneers of thought would sit and gather. The coffeehouse's entertainment function has shifted to artistic, poetic, political, and multi-directional intellectual meetings. Al-Rashid Street saw many of these coffeehouses such as al-Zahawi Café which was named in honor of Iraqi Poet al-Zahawi after former-Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said invited him to a meeting in it due to lack of respectable places in that period.\nIn the mid-1940s, al-Rashid Street witnessed the emergence of two new coffeehouses with unfamiliar styles to Iraqis at the time. The Brazilian Café and the Swiss Café featured European facades, thick luxurious glass, and elegant tables made of bamboo sticks, in addition to chairs specially imported from Europe and coffee machines that operated on electricity. Such coffeehouses have never been seen before in Iraq and were breathtaking at the time. Artists like Jawad Saleem and Faeq Hassan, who studied in Europe, would visit these Western-style coffeehouses, as at the time, Iraqis were much more open to foreign cultures. The coffeehouse also contributed to the idea of establishing the Union of Iraqi Writers. Al-Tahrir Square also saw another Western-style café, the Kit Kat Café. The Kit Kat café's visitors were Westernized intellectuals and liberal-leaning, and it was common to find Marxist talk in the coffeehouse.\nBy then, the coffeehouse culture had become an integral part of Baghdad's people, and a typical Iraqi environment that included all directions, ideas, and currents, along with conflicts and rivalries erupting, especially during Friday mornings and afternoons. Supporters of various poets also used to pick cafés to inhabit. Although the pioneers of the more modern and Westernized cafes did not appreciate the traditional coffeehouses that were widely spread throughout the city at the time, they were closely related to their fellow writers and artists, despite their differing intellectual visions and affiliations. Political differences of opinion and viewpoints have never divided the people of Baghdad as a whole.\nRole in Iraqi poetry\nThe 1940s witnessed a significant revival in Iraqi literature and poetry, particularly due to the poetry, fiction, and critiques written by young college students. Young poets would establish connections and gatherings, and were collectivized with each other to develop a sense of familiarity, which was unique for Iraq at the time. Coffeehouses became a venue for these meetings and were adapted as a sort of headquarters, as they provided the space needed to discuss their work and interests. Coffeehouses have historically housed poets such as the big three neo-classical Iraqi poets al-Zahawi, al-Rusafi, and al-Jawahiri, whose reputations were already established, so this movement was seen as a continuation of tradition. Open criticism and opinion discussions were also widespread, indicating the poets' and writers' exposure to improvement. These gatherings especially grew after coffeehouses started to expand in the 1950s. Due to the younger poets having little to no connections or establishments as poets, the coffeehouse was seen as a way to develop these, as well as a sort of \"workshop\" to develop one's skills. Although some poets suffered, such as poet Hussein Mardan, whose poems titled \"Naked Poems\" led to his arrest by the police.\nHussein Mardan confirmed in his writings the role of the coffeehouse in the development of that generation's work, as well as the association of different coffeehouses with different poets. For instance, the Hassan Ajami Café, located on al-Rashid Street, was associated with al-Jawahiri due to the café being his favorite, and the literary circles in Baghdad, including Mardan himself, where he noted that younger poets would meet with older poets to receive encouragement and advice. Coffeehouses were also used to write political poems to support demonstrations, such as al-Rusafi in the Arif Agha Café in the 1930s, or al-Jawahiri with the Parliament Café and the Hassan Ajami Café during the Wathbah uprisings of 1948.\nFurthermore, Jewish academic Sasson Somekh confirmed in his book Baghdad, Yesterday: The Making of an Arab Jew that he began his work after meeting Poet al-Jawahiri in the Hassan Ajami Café, which was located next to the Jewish Shamash School where Sasson used to attend when he was young. He wrote:I spent my days running back and forth between the many cafes on al-Rashid Street, which were the gathering places of young writers and artists - most of them Muslim, secular, left-wing, and all of them several years older than I was. A world of culture opened before me. Baghdad in the late 1940s was humming with literary activity and seemed poised to become the center of literature in the Arab world.However, not all poets were welcoming. An example of this can be found in al-Zahawi Cafe, which gained notoriety for its \"literary battles\" between al-Zahawi and al-Rusafi due to heated discussions that continued until al-Rusafi died in 1945. In al-Beiruti Café, traditionalist poets and writers would gather to preserve Iraqi neo-classical styles and their work. As such, they suspected the work of al-Haydari, a young poet who started to visit the coffeehouse after al-Rusafi's death, was considered a \"Western plot against the Arabic literary heritage.\"\nIn modern times (1980s–2018)\nDuring the 1990s, some coffeehouses sought to attract young customers by providing billiard table, which proved to be a major success in attracting new customers. However, this new shift was viewed with disapproval by the older generations.\nAfter the US-led invasion of Iraq, new cafés witnessed a new shift with huge sums of money being spent on their preparation, and cakes, refreshments, and juices were served in a lavish way. New café owners relied on specialists in their manufacture. These new cafés were more commercial in nature than older cafés and appeared in areas such as al-Mansour, Zayouna, and Karrada. The rise of westernization and globalization in Iraq after the invasion also lead to the decrease of many of the traditional coffeehouses around the cities along with decreasing rate of customers. Many of the remaining cafés such as al-Zahawi Café and Hassan Ajami Café are now suffering from neglect. A lot of the closed coffeehouses have also been turned into commercial stores.\nNewer cafés have also become a large concern for many Iraqis after the discovery of illegal activities such as being centers for criminal gangs, drug trafficking, human organ trafficking, prostitution, and more. The proliferation of these cafés in residential neighborhoods raised concern among families and neighborhoods and many residents noted the immoral activities but were afraid to report to the authorities out of fear of reprisals or prosecution. As of 2018, more than 60 cafés that were reported to have such activities were closed by the Iraqi authorities. Some of the cafés were even unlicensed.\nDespite this, there are many efforts and projects done by Iraqis to preserve heritage coffeehouses. Entertainment and friend gatherings have become the main activities of cafés recently and it was noted that younger generations prefer the heritage coffeehouses for their cheaper prices and more unique atmosphere compared to the newer cafés.\nThe US occupation also caused many Iraqi competencies such as physicists, mathematicians, atomic energy scientists, doctors, university professors, senior staff officers in the army, or experts in military industrialization, to flee to Syria and Jordan to escape the harsh conditions that came after the invasion.  Many of them were forced to retire due to conditions and the limited chances of ever returning to Iraq. Coffeehouses in Syria and Jordan, specifically Damascus and Amman, became meeting areas for these Iraqi experts due to their sense of isolation and limited opportunities they faced.\nTypes of Baghdadi coffeehouses\nCafés found in Baghdad are usually divided into several categories, the most notable are:\n# Passers-by coffeehouses: Usually located on main streets and squares, they are made for relaxation for locals passing by.\n# Locality coffeehouses: These coffeehouses are located within neighborhoods and act as meeting places for people living in said neighborhoods.\n# Intellectual coffeehouses: These coffeehouses are gathering grounds for intellectuals, artists, and poets and are found on al-Mutanabbi Street.\n# Athletes coffeehouses: These coffeehouses are dedicated to football players.\n# Working Class coffeehouses: As the name suggests, these coffeehouses are made for the working class and can be found all over Baghdad.\n# Specialty coffeehouses: A third wave modern cafes and pastries that emerged with passion about coffee quality.\nThere are many well-known coffeehouses around Baghdad. Due to their important role as centers of daily life, many coffeehouses hold a nostalgic significance for Iraqis, and many of them have been documented as havens for prominent poets, writers, thinkers, scholars, merchants, and other legal personalities who have been associated with these establishments. Coffeehouses of Baghdad are usually divided into two parts in terms of locations, the Western side and the Eastern side cafés. However, most cafés are located on the Eastern side.\nNotable coffeehouses on the western side\nAl-Karkh district\nAkama Café\nAl-Akama Café () was an old coffeehouse that overlooked the Tigris River directly. Named after the old profession of al-Akam, the café was founded by a man named Hassoun al-Qahwaji, who was known for his kindness, which is what gained the café its fame and its nickname \"Hassoun Café\". The café is divided into two parts: the large rooms at the beginning, which are the public rooms, and the small rooms at the end. It had four palm trees and a few oleander trees. It was frequented by writers and dignitaries from the people of Karkh. Abdullah al-Qassab, the former Iraqi Minister of Interior, was one of its patrons.\nAl-Beiruti Café\nAl-Beiruti Café () is one of the oldest surviving resting stations and heritage coffeehouses in Baghdad, dating to the 17th century. Located on the sides of the Tigris River, it contains a floating hall and is active in the evenings. People of all ages visit the coffeehouse for entertainment, and it serves as a small forum where issues related to economic, political, and other affairs are discussed regularly. In the spring of 1954, the levels of the Tigris River rose due to the abundance of rain, resulting in the flooding of the city of Baghdad and the sinking of the original coffeehouse. In 1978, the government rebuilt and reopened the café. Al-Beiruti Café has continued to provide its services to visitors and merchants since then, offering jobs to younger generations, and has also expanded to include a floating hall.\nDar al-Atraqchi\nDar al-Atraqchi Café () is a newer coffeehouse that has managed to gain popularity after successfully simulating the old Baghdadi atmosphere and avoiding any modern flavor. Opening in 2013, the café contains hundreds of rare Baghdadi and heritage antiques as well as traditional walls, carpets, and furniture. Among its antiques are handmade carpets, ancient fines, antiques, the readable Obelisk of Hammurabi, the Sumerian harp, silverware, and many more. The work companion of the owner, Sa'ad Salloum Abu Samer, confirmed that the reason for the demand for frequenting the café while it serves tea, coffee and shisha is that they are tired of modernity, western decorations, and bright lights, and have resorted to the calm atmosphere that the place provides them, as well as the old Baghdadi atmosphere.\nDar al-Atraqchi also lacks a table numbering system; instead, it has been replaced by naming each table after one of Iraq's artistic, literary, and political figures and pioneers. Among those figures are Ali al-Wardi, Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, Abd al-Razzaq al-Hasani, and many more. The coffeehouse offers its patrons singing performances every evening that include maqam and traditional songs.\nMazhar Café\nMazhar Café () is a heritage café located in the Karkh district near Haifa Street and the Ministry of Culture, and it has three entrance doors. The café is usually associated with Muhammad al-Qubanchi, whose pictures are hung on the walls of the coffeehouse, and it was a popular destination for talking about horse racing in al-Mansour district and betting on horse riders, as the owner of the café was a horse racing fan himself.\nAl-Kadhimiyya district\nHajj Sadiq Café\nHajj Sadiq Café () is an old coffeehouse located in Kadhimiya. The café is notable for being the first to introduce television during the Royal era, when no one had yet acquired televisions, regardless of their wealth. It's also a meeting spot for merchants and lawyers. During the morning on the day of the 14 July Revolution that overthrew the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq, the owner of the coffeehouse ran to the rooftop of his house near the coffeehouse with binoculars to witness the bombing of several ministries, and an unknown gunman shot him. The coffeehouse remains open in his memory.\nStar Café\nStar Café () is a meeting place for the writers, artists, and dignitaries from the Kadhimiya district and is located on the entrance of Sharif al-Radi Street.\nAl-Turath al-Sha'bi Café\n'''Al-Turath al-Sha'bi Café''' () is an old coffeehouse located in Kadhimiya.

During Ramadan, the Baghdadi game of al-Muhaibis is held, which is organized by Jassem al-Aswad, the player of al-Muhaibis. The coffeehouse has also become a meeting place for sellers of rings, precious stones, and rosaries due to its proximity to their market.\nNotable coffeehouses in the eastern side\nAl-A'dhamiyya district\nIbrahim Arab Café\nIbrahim Arab Café () was an old coffeehouse that existed in the Royal era in the A'dhamiyya district. The café was not famous in its own right but for the fame of its owner, Ibrahim Arab, who was a Baghdadi social figure renowned for creating fictional over-the-top stories that he attributed to himself, which he told to visitors who gathered around him in the coffeehouse. Such stories include how he ate most days of the week with King Faisal I, the time Adolf Hitler invited him on a tour around Germany, that time he almost destroyed Baghdad by pulling the Eastern side with a hook while fishing on the Tigris River, the time he and a drunk Nuri al-Said had lunch together and that the captain of the nobles of Baghdad did not enjoy his dinner except with Ibrahim's company. The visitors would also encourage Ibrahim to make more stories.\nAl-Nu'man Café\n'''Al-Nu'man Café''' () is a café located in al-A'dhamiyya District and owned by Nu'man Thabet. During the beginning of the US-led invasion of Iraq, former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein took a final public tour around Baghdad.

The coffeehouse was established by the Iraqi Communist Party as part of a campaign to establish cafes around Baghdad to spread its influence across. The coffeehouse was established in front of the Anjar Café, on the other side of al-Kifah Street. The coffeehouse's walls were decorated with banners that glorified Abd al-Karim Qasim and had slogans that said \"Long live the sole leader, Abd al-Karim Qasim\" and \"Long live the democratic leader Abd al-Karim Qasim\" along with framed pictures of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The influence of the communist party started to decline in the street after the leader of the Latin Cathedral of St. Joseph made a speech in which he described communists as \"anarchists.\" Eventually, the coffeehouse stopped letting in patrons with communist ideas, which led to its closure.\nArif Agha Café\nThe Arif Agha Café () was an old, well-known coffeehouse that once existed on al-Rashid Street, located opposite al-Zahawi Café and near the Haydar-Khana Mosque. The coffeehouse used to be frequented by senior employees of governmental departments, such as Yasin al-Hashemi and Hikmat Sulayman, as well as notables, such as al-Rusafi, and major merchants.

Since the 14th of July Café was established in front of the café after the revolution, the conflict between the patrons of the two cafés was characterized by an unusual pattern for the people of the locality. For example, the patrons of the Anjar Café were preparing some young men to be hostile to the pioneers of the 14th of July Café. The two conflicting groups naturally engaged in aggressive discussions, clashes, and fights, with the Islamic supporters raising Islamic slogans to spit at the communists.\nAzawi Café\nAzawi Café () is one of the oldest and most popular coffeehouses of Baghdad, located in al-Maidan Square near Mosque-Madrasa of al-Ahmadiyya.
