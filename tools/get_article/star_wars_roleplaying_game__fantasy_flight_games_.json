It consists of different standalone cross-compatible games where each one is a separate themed experience. The sourcebooks support games set from the Clone Wars era to the original Star Wars trilogy era; there is limited support for the Star Wars sequel trilogy era. Since 2020, the game line has been maintained by Asmodee's subsidiary Edge Studio.\nPublication history\nFantasy Flight Games (2012–2020)\nPrevious Star Wars roleplaying game publisher Wizards of the Coast declined to renew their license in 2010 after 11 years. At Gen Con 2011, Fantasy Flight Games announced they had acquired the license from Lucasfilm Ltd., and at the following Gen Con announcing Star Wars: Edge of the Empire for 2013, Star Wars: Age of Rebellion for 2014, and Star Wars: Force and Destiny for 2015, while releasing Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beta and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game later in the same year. These releases revealed that the new RPG was based on Jay Little's Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd edition, with the dice becoming the narrative dice system.\nAge of Rebellions beta version was released in October 2013, a beginner set released on April 25, 2014, and the final version of the game, the Age of Rebellion core rulebook, released on July 3, 2014. The third line of products, Star Wars: Force and Destiny, for playing Jedi characters, was released in beta in September 2014. In August 2018, the sourcebook Rise of the Separatists, set during the Clone Wars, was announced; it was released on May 9, 2019.\nAlso in 2018, Fantasy Flight Games published a 30th Anniversary Edition of the original Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game (1987–1999).\nIn 2020, Fantasy Flight Games announced that they were discontinuing their tabletop role-playing game lines. Parent company Asmodee then moved the Star Wars Roleplaying Game license to their subsidiary Edge Studio.\nEdge Studio (2020–present)\nIn October 2021, Edge Studio announced continued support of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game line via future reprints in phase one and new supplements in phase two. Edge Studio's RPG Manager Sam Gregor-Stewart, former lead developer of Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, \"hinted at the possibility of a new\" Star Wars roleplaying game system. However, in November 2021, Edge Studio \"told Dicebreaker that no standalone Star Wars RPGs are in development, despite the indication last month that it was working on brand new titles in the sci-fi setting\".\nIn October 2022, ComicBook.com reported that \"Asmodee has announced a new print run of several Star Wars Roleplaying Game era sourcebooks, ending a multi-year hiatus of sorts for the once-popular game\". The titles to be rereleased in November 2022 are: Dawn of the Rebellion, Rise of the Separatists, and Starships and Speeders along with the Game Master's Kits for Age of Rebellion and Edge of Empire. In December 2022, Edge Studio announced the upcoming reprint of eleven books including the Core Rulebooks for Age of the Rebellion, Edge of Empire, and Force and Destiny. The three entry level boxed sets for Age of Rebellion, Edge of the Empire, and Force and Destiny respectively are scheduled to be reprinted and released in December 2023.\nOverview\n| publisher = Fantasy Flight Games\n| date =\n| genre = Space opera\n| system = Narrative Dice System\n| web =\n| isbn = 978-1616616571\n}}\n| image = FFE-SWAgeofRebellion_cover.jpg\n| caption =\n| system = Narrative Dice System\n| genre = Space opera\n| designer = Sterling Hershey\n| web =\n| isbn = 978-1616617806\n}}\n| image = FFE-SWForce&Destiny_cover.jpg\n| caption =\n| system = Narrative Dice System\n| genre = Space opera\n| designer = Sterling Hershey\n| web =\n| isbn = 978-1633441224\n}}\nThe Star Wars Roleplaying Game is divided into various themed product lines which can be played as standalone games or as cross-compatible games:\n* Star Wars: Edge of the Empire: for playing bounty hunters, colonists, explorers, hired guns, smugglers, or technicians\n* Star Wars: Age of Rebellion: for playing rebel soldiers and freedom fighters against the Galactic Empire\n* Star Wars: Force and Destiny: for playing Force-sensitives and the last Jedi Knights under the Empire's rule\n* Star Wars: The Force Awakens: set prior to the events of the third Star Wars trilogy\n* Star Wars: Rise of the Separatists & Collapse of the Republic: set during the Clone Wars; players can be Jedi, clone troopers and even work for the Separatists\nSupported fictional eras\nStar Wars: Rise of the Separatists (2019) is set during the Clone Wars era at the beginning of the Palpatine regime. Star Wars: Collapse of the Republic (2019) is set during the second half of the Clone Wars and the waning of the Republic. Star Wars: Dawn of Rebellion (2018) is set during the ascendance of the Empire. It deals with the events at the time of the animated series Star Wars Rebels and the film Rogue One (2016), in which the Rebellion is divided into factions and is opposing the Empire just as it is consolidating its power.\nThe first three installments of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game are set within the time period of the original Star Wars trilogy. Star Wars: Edge of the Empire (2013) is set shortly after the destruction of the first Death Star, and deals with characters on the fringes of galactic space. Star Wars: Age of Rebellion (2014) is set around the time of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and allows players to join the Rebellion. Like Edge of the Empire, Star Wars: Force and Destiny (2015) is set shortly after the destruction of the first Death Star and the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi, when the force sensitives and Jedi slowly start to re-emerge in hopes of rebuilding the Jedi Order.\nThe Force Awakens Beginner Game is set during the current era depicted in the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), with the adventure provided taking place just before the events of the movie.\nGame system\nCharacteristics\nThe Characteristics are Brawn (Physical Power), Agility (Physical Precision), Intellect (Intelligence and \"Book Smarts\"), Cunning (Wisdom and \"Street Smarts\"), Willpower (Endurance and Focus), and Presence (Charisma and Attractiveness). Characteristic levels (called \"ratings\") range from a minimum Rating of 1 to a maximum Rating of 6, although there is a ceiling of 5 during character creation. Each character race has different base Characteristic ratings, though additional ratings in each attribute can be gained during or after character creation.\nThere are additional derived characteristics:\n* Strain: determines how much physical, mental or emotional stress a character can take before collapsing.\n* Wound Points: determines how much physical damage a character can take before passing out or slipping into a coma.\n* Soak: protection granted by the clothing or armor a character is wearing and/or the character's natural toughness.\n* Defense: resistance to melee and/or ranged weapon attacks and is granted by armor or certain Talents.\nTemplates\nAfter determining attributes, the player designs their character using a Species Template. Each species has different racial characteristic minimums and maximums. Each species also has additional features such as Talents or Special Abilities.\nThe player then picks a Career and then pick one of the three or more Specializations of that Career. Each Specialization grants Career Skills and a \"Specialization Tree\", which grants specialization-based Talents.\nAll the Career Skills listed under the character's Career and Specialization (whether chosen or not during character creation) can be bought for a flat point cost. The Career Skills chosen by the player from the career and specialization lists are granted their first level free during initial character creation, but cost the same as other Career Skills when buying higher levels. Characters cannot buy a new Career but may buy additional Specializations - whether they are under their Career or not. However, if a character wishes to buy another specialization, it costs less for one under their chosen Career than for one under another Career.\nThe Universal \"Careers\" are generic Specializations that can be used by any of the core games. Some allow characters from one game to crossover to the others. Force Sensitive Exile and Force Sensitive Emergent allow veteran characters from Edge of the Empire and Age of Rebellion respectively to become Force users and use the Force and Destiny game rules. Recruit allows Edge of the Empire characters to cross over to the more idealistic Age of Rebellion campaigns. They cost the same as if they were Specializations under the character's existing Career, making them cheaper and more effective than buying a Specialization under a different Career.\nSkills\nThere are three types of skills in the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. Knowledge skills cover intellectual pursuits, Combat skills cover confrontational actions, and General skills cover non-combat actions.\nThe game's rules assume that all characters have all the game system's skills at \"zero level\" if they do not have a level in it. The character's default skill level is equal to the skill's governing Characteristic score.\nPurchasing a level in a skill (called a \"rank\") makes the character an expert in it. Regular skill rolls substitute a yellow 12-sided Proficiency die for a green 8-sided Ability die per skill rank. It can also add green Ability dice if the character's skill level is higher than their attribute level. Blue 6-sided Boost Dice are added for advantageous events or if another character is helping the player character with the attempt.\nSkill rolls are opposed by rolling a pool of purple 8-sided Difficulty Dice. Depending on the complexity of the task the character is attempting, it could range from one Difficulty die for an Easy complexity task to five Difficulty dice for a Formidable complexity task. Black 6-sided Setback Dice are added for disadvantageous events.\nIf the character is being opposed by an NPC antagonist while performing a task, then the dice pool is based on the NPC's opposing skill. The Difficulty Pool is created by adding a purple Difficulty Die for each green Ability Die the NPC has in the skill and a red 12-sided Challenge Die for each yellow 12-sided Proficiency Die the NPC has in the skill. Black Setback Dice are added if another NPC is helping the antagonist NPC to hinder the player character's attempt.\nTalents\nTalents are advantages that add flavor to a character and either grant bonuses, benefit allies, remove penalties during play, or penalize adversaries. They cost experience points to buy, and must be unlocked in the order they appear on the \"Specialization Tree\". The further down the diagram, the more powerful (and expensive) the Talents become. Each Career Specialization has its own Specialization Tree. When the tree is all filled out, the character cannot buy any more talents from it. If the player wishes to obtain more Talents for their character, then they must purchase a new Career Specialization and begin filling out that Specialization Tree.\nTalents are split into two groups. \"Passive\" talents denote abilities that are considered always on and can be used for the entire duration of the session. \"Active\" talents denote abilities that require a difficulty roll to turn on prior to use, and in some cases can only be used a limited number of times in a given session. Some talents have levels and can be purchased more than once. The talent's levels stack, even if they are bought for different amounts of experience points.\nDisadvantages\nDisadvantages can be taken during character creation to offset point costs:\n* Edge of the Empire has Obligation, something the character is forced or compelled to do. The number of Player Characters in the group sets the base disadvantage number. The smaller the group, the larger the Disadvantage level that each player must bear. The Game Master rolls percentile dice at the beginning of play to see which character's disadvantage will be used during the session. The character can pay off the disadvantage with experience points in gameplay.\n* Age of Rebellion has Duty, something the character wants to do. Levels of Duty can be cashed in for Contribution levels, which establish the individual or group's rank in the Rebellion. It also can be used to grant gifts of equipment, vehicles, or resources.\n* Force and Destiny has Morality, which governs how close the Force-using character is to slipping over to the Dark Side. Unlike the other two games, Morality is governed by a character's actions during gameplay. Conflict is generated whenever they choose to perform a morally questionable action or choose to use the Dark Side of the Force in order to power their abilities. Morality cannot be 'bought' with XP, instead a player wanting to change their alignment must actually role-play a more aggressive character to turn Dark, or perform acts of compassion to become a paragon of the Light.\nMotivation is the character's guiding principle:\n* In the cynical Edge of the Empire, it is an Ambition, Cause or Relationship.\n* In the idealistic Age of Rebellion, it is a Quest, Belief or Personal Connection.\n* In Force and Destiny it is an Ambition, Cause or Faith.\nIf the player uses the character's Motivation during gameplay, they get an experience point bonus.\nDice\nand Destiny Tokens (rear) used in the game]]\nUsing the storytelling dice from their earlier Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (3rd edition) as its basis, Fantasy Flight Games tweaked the design to make a dice pool system that was more evocative of the Star Wars universe. It renamed the dice types, uses 6-, 8-, and 12-sided dice rather than 6-, 8-, and 10-sided dice, abandons the \"exploding die\" mechanic, and removes the Stance dice.\nThe narrative dice system uses seven different types of dice. They use symbols rather than numbers and are interpreted on two axes: Succeed / Fail and Lucky / Unlucky. You can succeed, but have negative complications or fail but have positive advantages.\n*Ability [green 8-sided die]: Represents the character's characteristic level (1 to 6 dice). It is used if they are using a skill to perform a task that they are untrained in.\n*Proficiency [yellow 12-sided die]: Represents the character's skill. Every rank of skill (1 to 5 dice) substitutes a Proficiency die for an Ability die.\n*Boost [light blue 6-sided die]: Used to aid a skill roll due to advantageous factors (like being assisted by an ally).\n*Difficulty [purple 8-sided die]: Used to oppose a skill roll by how difficult the task is (normally rated from 1 to 5 dice). They are also used if the task is being opposed by an untrained character and is based on their Attribute level (1 to 6 dice).\n*Challenge [red 12-sided die]: Used when a skill roll is being opposed by a skilled character with ranks in a skill. Each rank of Proficiency (1 to 5 dice) replaces a Difficulty die with a Challenge die.\n*Setback [black 6-sided die]: Used to penalize a skill roll due to disadvantageous factors.\n*Force [white 12-sided die]: Used to determine the number of Destiny Points that go into the Destiny Pool at the beginning of play. Also used for Luck rolls and the use of Force Powers.\n*Percentile [10-sided dice]: Used to roll on the Critical Injury and Critical Hit charts. They are of different colors, one representing the tens digit and the other representing the ones digit (e.g., \"0\" and \"7\" is 7, \"3\" and \"5\" is 35, and \"0\" and \"0\" is 100). They are not included in the narrative dice set, but are easily obtainable.\nThe facets contain either a blank or one of six results.\n* Success and Failure are positive and negative results on the Succeed / Fail axis. If the sum is positive, the action succeeds, but if the sum is neutral or negative, then it fails.\n* Advantage and Threat are positive and negative results on the Lucky / Unlucky axis. If the sum is positive, the action has positive side-effects (like skill bonuses or lucky breaks). If the sum is negative, then the action has negative side-effects (like penalties and complications).\n* Triumph (only found on Proficiency dice) is a Critical Success that counts as a success result and can unlock special abilities or cause critical damage in combat. Despair (only found on Challenge dice) is a Critical Failure that counts as a failure result and also causes a powerful negative effect (e.g., a firearm runs out of ammo or a vehicle breaks down during a chase). Triumphs and Despairs do not cancel each other out and are not canceled by surplus Advantages and Threats.\nDestiny Tokens\nDestiny Tokens are small round pieces that are black on one side and white on the other. They represent the party's pool of Destiny Points. They are granted based on Force Dice rolls at the beginning of each session. The Player Characters' party gets the tokens of one color and the game master gets the remaining tokens of the opposing color. White Tokens (The Light Side of the Force) are for the Good Guys. Black Tokens (The Dark Side of the Force) are for the Bad Guys. The party's affiliation determines which color they get.\nA Destiny Point can be spent to award a bonus die for a character's action, or inflict a penalty die to the opposition's effort. Destiny Points can also be used to change a situation or cancel out or re-roll an unfavorable result like a fatal hit or pivotal skill-check failure. Every time a Destiny Point is used by the party or the game master, one of their Destiny Tokens is flipped over to change its color. This flipped token can now be added to the opposite side's pool. \"The game is intended for a relatively regular flow of destiny points back and forth\".\nCombat Rules\nThe first step in combat is to figure out Initiative, which is figured by making a Cool or Vigilance skill check. The results (best to worst) indicate the order in which the characters and their adversaries act.\nThe Combat skills are Brawl, Melee, Lightsaber, Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), and Gunnery.\n* Brawl covers unarmed combat.\n* Melee covers armed combat.\n** Lightsaber covers armed combat with a Lightsaber or similar focused energy weapon (like Phase Daggers or Lightwhips). Anyone can learn to use a Lightsaber, but a character has to be a Force Sensitive in order to wield it effectively. Lightsabers use Brawn as its base attribute (like all melee weapons). However, certain Force and Destiny Talents can use Agility or even Intellect or Presence as a base.\n* Ranged (Light) are small ranged weapons that can be carried and fired with one hand.\n* Ranged (Heavy) are large ranged weapons that need to be carried by two hands.\n* Gunnery covers pintle-mounted or turreted ranged weapons, usually mounted on vehicles and starships. It also covers fixed-firing on-board weapon systems like a starfighter's laser cannons, ion cannons, and proton torpedo launchers.\nCombat modifiers are calculated using Range Bands (the approximate distance the character is from the target).\nNon-Player Characters in Combat\nIn combat the player characters have three kinds of adversaries: Minions, Rivals, and Nemeses.\n* Minions are \"nameless individuals who provide muscle to flesh out encounters\". They have group Soak and Wound Threshold ratings. Every time the damage exceeds the wound threshold, a minion \"succumbs\" and the group loses a member. If the damage doesn't exceed the threshold, the minion is fine and can continue fighting. If an individual minion takes a Critical Injury, they are incapacitated; an area-effect attack on a minion group that inflicts a Critical Injury incapacitates one minion per Critical Injury scored.\n* Rivals are named adversaries that are \"more dangerous than minions but still inferior to most Player Characters\". They act as minor antagonists and/or lieutenants to major antagonists. They suffer Wounds and Critical Injuries normally, but can die if their Wound Threshold is exceeded.\n* A Nemesis is the opposite of the character, the Big Bad Guy to their Good Guy (or vice-versa for Dark Side characters). They are usually more powerful than the character in order for them to be a challenge - not just for the character, but for the whole party. They are treated like player characters when they fight, make skill checks, and take damage. The main thing that separates a Nemesis from a Rival is that they are the major antagonist.\nReception\nFantasy Flight initially drew criticism for releasing a beta version, making people pay twice, and for the extra expense of the unusual custom dice; but reviews after launch were enthusiastic about the dice, with Game Informer saying \"In practice, this system offers tremendous flexibility to allow the players to participate in the storytelling process, rather than just waiting for the GM to respond after a die roll. The players talk together about how to interpret a roll of the dice, and shape the results to make the most exciting story. It also speaks strongly to the cinematic nature of the Star Wars universe; characters in the movies often succeed or fail along with potent side effects.\" and Penny Arcade saying \"This dice system is designed to facilitate awesome storytelling and it worked great!\" In 2022, CBR also highlighted the dice system — the article states \"the Star Wars Roleplaying Game excels in its theming and incorporates it into every part of its system. The best example of theme influencing the mechanics of SWRPG is the dice pool system. [...] While many TRPGs use their dice as a simple mechanic that adds nothing to storytelling, the Star Wars Roleplaying Game uses themed dice and group interpretation to immerse its players in the story\".\nForce and Destiny was on Popular Mechanics's 2015 \"The Ten Best Tabletop Games of 2015\" list — the article states \"there have been a lot of Star Wars role playing games over the years, and unfortunately few make the player really feel like a grounded member of the franchise universe. But that's where Star Wars: Force and Destiny shines\". Giaco Furino, in a separate review of Force and Destiny for Popular Mechanics, commented that \"this is a roleplaying game that commands your attention, and is full of fanservice and nods to the die-hards. [...] Since 2012, Fantasy Flight Games has been on a roll, creating insanely fun RPG's set in the Star Wars universe. [...] And now [...] they're putting out Star Wars: Force and Destiny, where you take on the role of wannabe Jedi and Sith, and head out into the galaxy to use the force for good and evil\". Furino highlighted that \"this game digs deep into the Star Wars mythos, but it's not so esoteric as to drive away newcomers and casual fans of the franchise. [...] While some RPG's encourage intense number crunching and data management, Force and Destiny is all about story\".\nThe 2015 Strange Assembly review of Star Wars: Force and Destiny states that \"of all the Star Wars RPG lines, Force and Destiny is arguably the most ripe for cross-line use. All three lines are, of course, designed to be fully compatible with each other, but [...] it seems less likely to have a whole group of hidden force users than, say, a Rebel cell or a cadre of smugglers\". On the mechanics of running a character from one game line in a different themed game, the review states that these characters have \"to give up something to join a group of the others [...]. This dichotomy is exemplified by the two line-specific mechanisms of EotE (Obligation) and AoR (Duty) – each is to some extent a group-based mechanic, with the group as a whole getting dragged around. The equivalent from Force and Destiny (Morality), however, is a deeply personal concept to each individual character. Just as a character can easily have both Morality and Duty/Obligation, so too can a force user built from Force and Destiny be dropped into a campaign with few or no other force users, and fit right in (indeed, that’s basically what the Force Sensitive specializations in those game lines were)\".\nDaniel Foster, in a 2020 review of Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game for FanSided, wrote that \"the most challenging thing to me as an experienced role-player was learning the new dice system. [...] My group completed the adventure in the beginner set in about two hours. [...] The game never got bogged down even as we were getting used to interpreting the dice rolls, and the included maps, markers, and stats were easily referenced while adding to the game experience\". Foster commented \"though the game predates the Disney acquisition, we did not run into any major conflicts with new canon\". He also commented that the various Star Wars Roleplaying Game \"games are sold separately, but are compatible systems, allowing a good Game Master to move their players through a campaign that could touch on any of those settings\".\nRichard Jansen-Parkes, in a review of the Dawn of Rebellion (2018) for the UK print magazine Tabletop Gaming, stated that the sourcebook is \"designed to work with all three of the subtly different rulesets released by the studio\" and \"aims to set up adventures in the early days of the Rebellion. [...] It's a time of stealth missions and sabotage rather than pitched battles, where the heroes are likely to be desperate renegades rather than superpowered warriors\". Jansen-Parkes highlighted that Dawn of Rebellion evokes the film Rogue One and the animated series Star Wars Rebels; it also includes details on running adventures inside the Death Star. Jansen-Parkes commented that \"You could potentially argue that the book is a little on the slim side – and when you cut out everything that you could probably piece together with a couple of hours on Wookiepedia it gets slimmer still. That doesn't change the fact that it's still a beautifully put-together volume. If you're looking for a new spin on roleplaying in that galaxy far, far away it's well worth a look\".\nCannibal Halfling Gaming, an ENNIE Award nominated website, reviewed both the Rise of the Separatists and the Collapse of the Republic sourcebooks in 2019 — the second review states \"if you're coming at this era of Star Wars Roleplaying cold and don't already have Rise of the Separatists, you'll be fine with just Collapse of the Republic so long as you stick to its specific era (later seasons of The Clone Wars, Revenge of the Sith), although you might feel a little squeezed for options without the Padawan, the more run-of-the-mill Clone Soldiers, and so on in certain play styles. If you're not fighting for the Republic, though, or at least not as Jedi and clones, well in that case you'll have an easier time of it. Final word: Rise of the Separatists got my curiosity, Collapse of the Republic got my attention, and together they're giving me ideas. Get one or get both, but if you're interested in playing in the twilight of the Republic, they'll be money well spent\".\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Award\n!Category\n!Product\n!Result\n! class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"|2013\n| rowspan=\"3\"|Golden Geek Award\n|RPG: Game of the Year\n|Star Wars: Edge of the Empire\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|RPG: Best Artwork & Presentation\n|Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook\n|\n|-\n|RPG: Best Supplement\n|Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game\n|\n|-\n|UK Games Expo Awards\n|Best Role-playing Game\n|Star Wars: Edge of the Empire\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2014\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Golden Geek Award\n|RPG: Game of the Year\n|Star Wars: Force and Destiny\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|RPG: Best Artwork & Presentation\n|Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|2015\n| rowspan=\"3\"|Golden Geek Award\n| rowspan=\"2\"|RPG: Best Artwork & Presentation\n|Star Wars: Force and Destiny Beginner Game\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|Star Wars: Force and Destiny Core Rulebook\n|\n|-\n|RPG: Best Supplement\n|Star Wars: Force and Destiny Game Master's Kit\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2016\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Origins Award\n|Best Role-Playing Game\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Star Wars: Force and Destiny\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|Fan Favorite Role-Playing Game\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Origins Award\n|Fan Favorite Role-Playing Game\n|Star Wars: Edge of the Empire\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nOfficial products\nStar Wars Roleplaying Game\nThese items can be used with Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion and/or Force and Destiny rules sets.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margins:auto\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Creator(s)\n!Date\n!ISBN\n!Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Boxed sets\n|-\n|Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Beginner Game\n|\n|August 2016\n|\n|The game is set before Star Wars: The Force Awakens, during the New Republic era.
