In her first MHL start on September 22, 2024, Stewart recorded a 39-save shutout in a 3–0 victory over the Grand Falls Rapids. After allowing just one goal in her following start, she was named MHL rookie of the month for September 2024. In ten games that season, she recorded a .903 save percentage.\nStewart joined the University of Wisconsin for the 2025–26 season, making her debut on October 4, 2025, halfway through the third period of a 5–0 victory over the University of Maine. In nine minutes of play, she stopped all three shots she faced.\nInternational play\n}}\nRepresenting Canada at the 2024 World U18 Championship, Stewart recorded a .950 save percentage and 0.67 goals against average, winning all three games she played. In a quarterfinal win against Switzerland, she recorded a three-save shutout.
