The stone is now located at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.\nThe stone has been dated to the Middle Ages. The Catholic Encyclopedia states the date as April 25, 1135.  Others have dated the stone between 1250 and 1333. However, as the historian Finn Gad has pointed out, the date given on the stone can be interpreted in various ways. As such, it cannot, as previously thought, be taken as evidence for the three hunters named on the stone in this region.\nInscription\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|⁓ el^likr · sikuaþs : so^n:r · ok · baan^ne : torta^r son : ¶ ⁓ ok : enriþi · os son : laukardak·in : fyrir · gakndag ¶ hloþu · ua^rda te · ok rydu : ??????\n|{} Erlingr {} Sighvats {} sonr {} ok {} Bjarni {} Þórðar sonr {} {} {} ok {} Eindriði {} Odds sonr {} laugardagin {} fyrir {} gagndag {} hlóðu {} varða þe[ssa] {} ok … {} …\n|Erlingr Sighvatrs son and Bjarni Þorðr's son and Eindriði Oddr's son, constructed these cairns the Saturday before Rogation Day, and …\n}}\nThe first line is the transcription verbatim; the second line is the normalized Old Norse version. A ^ mark indicates a bind rune; for example a^r indicates that ᛆᚱ is written as a single glyph. A ~ indicates an unspecified punctuation mark.\nUndeciphered runes\nThe six runes following the translated text are undeciphered, though they do have very close single-character components.\nThe first two and final runes appear to have two components,\na Sowilō (ᛋ) with a Mannaz (ᛘ) and/or Algiz (ᛉ) on the top and bottom.\nThe following three runes appear also to have the top and bottom Mannaz or Algiz, just with a Jēran (ᛄ) instead.\nSome believe that they are meaningless, while others believe that it contains a secret message.\nSee also\n* 1824 in archaeology\n* Greenlandic Norse\n* List of runestones\n* Cipher runes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.arild-hauge.com/gron-greenland.htm Runic inscription from Greenland] (Text only in )\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070209222056/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/vikings/Greenland.html Vikings in Greenland from MNSU EMuseum]"
