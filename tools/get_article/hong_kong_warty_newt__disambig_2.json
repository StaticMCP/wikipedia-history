Once thought to be endemic to the territory, the species has also been found in the coastal parts of Guangdong Province. It is the only Urodela living in Hong Kong.\nThis newt is considered by some naturalists as a subspecies of Paramesotriton chinensis. However, some disagree with such a classification based on the disjunctive distribution of the two, and the differences in their physical appearance and habitat preference.\nDescription\nThe snout-to-tail length of the newt is about 11 to 15&nbsp;cm. Its body colour ranges from light to dark brown, with patches of orange markings scattered on the ventral side. The patterns of the patches are unique for each individual, resembling the fingerprints of humans. Small granules can be found throughout the body. A mid-dorsal skin ridge extends backwards from the neck through the anterior third of the tail. Two dorsolateral folds are also present.\nThe head is roughly triangular. The eyes have horizontal pupils. The tail is thin and flattened, with a thin, red stripe along the ventral border. The four legs are similar in size. Four and five unwebbed digits can be found at the anterior and posterior limbs, respectively.\nAs with other newts, the tadpoles have finger-like gills around their necks, which disappear completely after metamorphosis.\nWhen threatened, it releases a toxic secretion and may also feign death, rolling onto its back and exposing its brightly coloured belly.\nIn the breeding season, the male displays by beating its tail, which develops a white or bluish stripe which is visible in dim light. Sperm is transferred to the female in a spermatophore. eggs are laid singly and are wrapped in leaves.\nConservation\nIn Hong Kong, it is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170.\nMedia\nHong Kong warty newt is featured in a short documentary Life (Cycle) of the Hong Kong Newt (2024). The film captures the full life process of the Hong Kong newt, from egg to adulthood, showcasing its natural behaviors such as courtship, egg-laying, and climbing. It also delves into the impact of urbanization on its habitat, particularly as urban development continues to reduce their living spaces. It was uploaded to YouTube in April 2024 for free public viewing.\nReferences\n*Stephen J.
