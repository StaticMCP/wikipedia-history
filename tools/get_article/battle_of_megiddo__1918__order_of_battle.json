The Entente's Egyptian Expeditionary Force, commanded by General Edmund Allenby and composed mainly of British, Indian, Australian and New Zealand troops, with a small French and Armenian contingent, cooperated with the Arab Northern Army, which was part of the Arab Revolt and was under the overall command of the Emir Feisal, in an all-out offensive against the Yıldırım Army Group, part of the army of the Ottoman Empire.\nAfter preliminary attacks beginning late on 16 September 1918, Allenby's main attack overran the Ottoman front lines on 19 September. British Indian Army and Australian mounted divisions seized objectives far behind the front line, while British and Australian aircraft crippled the Ottoman armies' headquarters and attacked retreating Ottoman troops, turning their retreat into a rout.\nMost of the Ottoman formations were destroyed by 26 September. Allenby's mounted divisions and Arab irregulars captured Damascus on 1 October. The surviving Ottoman troops were pursued to Aleppo, and the war in the Middle East ended on 31 October.\nOrder of battle\nOn 17 September 1918, the opposing armies in Palestine, Trans Jordan and Syria were deployed as follows:\nOttoman\nSource:\nYildirim Army Group (Otto Liman von Sanders)\n*Eighth Army (Jevad Pasha) — Tulkarm\n**XXII Corps (Refet Bey)\n***46th Division (Shefik Avni Bey) (recently arrived at Tyre)\n***7th Division (Nasuhi Bey)\n***20th Division (Veysel Bey)\n**Asia Korps (Oberst Gustav von Oppen) also named Left Wing Group\n***19th Division (Sami Sabit Bey)\n***16th Division (Rushdi Bey)\n***German \"Pasha II\" detachment (regiment)\n**2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division\n*Seventh Army (Mustafa Kemal Pasha) — Nablus\n**III Corps (Ismet Bey)\n***1st Division (Hans Guhr Bey)\n***11th Division (Kiazim Bey)\n**XX Corps (Ali Fuad Pasha)\n***26th Division (Mehmed Hayri Bey)\n***53rd Division (Reshad Bey)\n***German 146th Infantry Regiment\n*Fourth Army (Mersinli Djemal Pasha, \"the Lesser\") – Es Salt\n**VIII Corps (Jordan River) (Yasin Hilmi Bey, also known as Salman el-Hashimi)\n***48th Division (Âsım Bey)\n***Composite Division (Hussein Nureddin Bey)\n**II Corps (Galatali Shevket Bey)\n***Jordan Group (Amman)\n****24th Division\n****3rd Cavalry Division (Esad Bey)\n***Ma'an and Hauran detachment\n****62nd Division\n****Three composite detachments\n*43rd Division (arrived Beirut early October)\nAllied\nSource:\nEgyptian Expeditionary Force (General Edmund Allenby)\n:Chief of Staff – Lieutenant General Louis Bols\n*XXI Corps (Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin) — main attack\n**Corps Cavalry Regiment (3 mixed squadrons Yeomanry)\n**Royal Garrison Artillery (5 Heavy Batteries, 12 Siege Batteries, 6 Mountain Batteries)\n**60th Division (Major General J.S.M.
