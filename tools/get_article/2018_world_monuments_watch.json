The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, non-government organizations (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field. An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions. For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.\n2018 Watch List\nThe 2018 World Monuments Watch List of Endangered Sites was announced on October 16, 2017, by WMF President Joshua David. The 2018 Watch List highlights the threats to cultural heritage sites posed by human conflict, natural disaster, climate change, and urbanization.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
