In the Beshtamak area and on the Gundelen River Kabardian cavalry defeated the Crimeans who suffered a devastating loss as many men got cornered and massacred meanwhile the Kabardians suffered around 2,000 casualties in the battle. The remnants of the Crimeans retreated from Kabarda and Devlet IV Giray was humiliated once returning back to Crimea.\nReferences"
