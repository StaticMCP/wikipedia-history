They have been presented in various guises since then. Below is a partial list of past winners.\n2005–2017\nThe Christy Ring Cup Champion 15 Awards were presented between 2005 and 2017, during the period when the Christy Ring Cup allowed competitors direct entry to the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Unlike the All Star Awards, the 15 players selected were not chosen by position and players received nominations at the end of each game from opposing team managers. Under the selection format, the competition winner had three players honoured, while two players from each of the two semi-finalists and two players the other finalist were also recognised, in addition to one player from each of the other participating county teams. Champion 15 Awards for the Nicky Rackard Cup and Lory Meagher Cup were also awarded at various times during this period, such as in 2010, shortly after the latter's establishment.\n2005\n;Christy Ring

McDonagh Cup began in 2018, replacing the Christy Ring Cup in allowing competitors direct entry to the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. The team selected was initially referred to as \"Champion 15\", but later became \"Team of the Year\". However, that selection is also still referred to as a \"Champion 15\" by official sources.\nChampion 15 Awards continued to be given after the intent of the original was subsumed by the Joe McDonagh Cup Team of the Year. They have been presented to the players at the main Hurling All Stars event, held at the Convention Centre Dublin (such as in 2019), or, separately, at their own event (as in 2024 and 2025).\n2018\nThe 2018 Champion 15 selection excluded the Christy Ring Cup, which continued to receive its own selection for that year only. This meant it was possible to include for the first time on the main Champion 15 selection a player each from lesser teams like Cavan and Fermanagh, who were involved in the 2018 Lory Meagher Cup, and were the only two teams not to make it to the final. Fermanagh's Ryan Bogue was selected, as was Kevin Connelly for Cavan. The 2018 selection was not assigned numbers and was presented similarly to the original Christy Ring Cup Champion 15 Awards.\nDeclan Coulter (Donegal), Stephen Gillespie (Donegal), Shane Caulfield (Warwickshire) Niall McKenna (Warwickshire), Dermot Begley (Tyrone), Kevin Crawley (Monaghan), Stephen Kettle (Louth), John Casey (Longford), Declan Molloy (Leitrim), James Weir (Sligo), Gary Cadden (Sligo), Ronan Crowley (Lancashire), Edmond Kenny (Lancashire), Ryan Bogue (Fermanagh), Kevin Connelly (Cavan)\n;Christy Ring Cup Champion 15 Award winners\nPaddy McKenna (Kildare), Eanna O'Neill (Kildare), Mark Moloney (Kildare), Jack Sheridan (Kildare), Brian Regan (London), Denis O'Regan (London), Aaron Sheehan (London), John Henderson (Wicklow), Warren Kavanagh (Wicklow), Cian Waldron (Derry), Cormac O'Doherty (Derry), Daithí Sands (Down), Stephen Renaghan (Armagh), Naos Connaughton (Roscommon), David Kenny (Mayo)\n:Awarded as Joe McDonagh Cup Champion 15.\n* Edward Byrne (Carlow)\n* Brian Treacy (Carlow)\n* James Doyle (Carlow)\n* Chris Nolan (Carlow)\n* David English (Carlow)\n* Paul Doyle (Carlow)\n* Derek McNicholas (Westmeath)\n* Allan Devine (Westmeath)\n* Paul Greville (Westmeath)\n* Patrick Carroll (Westmeath)\n* Eoin Price (Westmeath)\n* Seán Weir (Kerry)\n* Ross King (Laois)\n* Neil McManus (Antrim)\n* Joey Keena (Meath)\n2019\nIn a change from previous years, the Champion 15 players were selected from 45 nominations, with journalists and referees also involved in a committee to choose the team.\nNo team was selected from those competing in the Joe McDonagh Cup in 2019, although Paddy Purcell was named as that competition's Hurler of the Year. Instead, Enda Rowland and Jack Kelly of Laois received All Star nominations.\n# Simon Doherty (Armagh)\n# Caolan Taggart (Down)\n# Keith Keoghan (Meath)\n# Enda Moreton (Leitrim)\n# James Weir
