Built about 1841, it is a prominent local example of Greek Revival, most notable as the home of author and minister Edward Everett Hale for forty years.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nDescription and history\nThe Edward Everett Hale House stands on the north side of the Roxbury Highlands, on the west side of Morley Street, a dead-end residential street a short way south of John Eliot Square.  It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a side-gable roof and a mostly clapboarded exterior.  The front facade is five bays wide, with a four-column Ionic portico projecting in front of the center three bays.  The columns rise to an entablature with a low-pitch triangular pediment.  The entablature is continued around the sides of the building.  The facade behind the portico is finished in flushboard, and the windows there have eared corner mouldings.  The main entrance, at the center of the facade, is framed by sidelight and transom windows, with a corniced architrave above.\nThe house was built about 1841 by Benjamin Kent, a local carpenter.  It was originally located at 39 Highland Street, just around the corner from its present location, and is one of Boston's finer examples of high-style Greek Revival architecture.  It was moved here sometime between 1899 and 1906 by Edward Everett Hale.  Hale, a prominent writer and minister, made this his home from 1869 until his death in 1909.\nSee also\n*Hale House, Hale's summer residence\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Boston, Massachusetts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://historicboston.org/portfolio_page/Edward-Everett-Hale-house/ Edward Everett Hale House] at Historic Boston, Inc."
