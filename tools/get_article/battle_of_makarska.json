The Slavic Narentine pirates dominated  Adriatic Sea for a long time, which was something Candiano wanted to put an end to. Candiano sent fleet to deal with the Slavic pirates, but these brought no result. However, Candiano wasn't deterred and decided to lead the expedition himself. On August 887, Venetian fleet reached Makra country town and achieved initial success, where they destroyed 5 Narentine ships.\nBattle\nOn 18 September, Narentines organised for a battle and were led by Duke Branimir. Doge Candiano had 12 well-equipped large ships at his command and was confident about his expedition. Branimir likely had a similar fleet equipment under his command, as he wouldn't have been able to stand a chance otherwise. Branimir intended to ambush the Venetian fleet and attack them when they least expected it, to avoid enormous damage from Venetian heavy artillery. The size of Branimir likely had more ships under his command.\nWith all factors taken into account, Narentines were likely aware of the movement of the Venetian fleet, which they used to their advantage. Narentines at first sent out a few ships towards Venetian fleet, as part of the ambush. The course of the battle was going in Venetian favour, until the rest of Nerentine fleet appeared and surrounded the Venetian fleet, forcing them to move in the direction of Makarska. The Venetians were in unfavourable position and were ultimately defeated.\nAftermath\nThe Venetian fleet was forced into disorganised retreat, including leaving behind Doge Candiano's body who died in battle. Doge's body was later recovered in secret by Andrew the Tribune. As a result of the defeat at Makarska, Venetians were forced to pay tribute to Narentine Slavs, including for safe passage, and recognise Narentine superiority on the Adriatic Sea for 100 years. Venetian chronicles don't mention any conflicts with Nerentines onwards until 948.\nLegacy\nIn Croatia, the victory over Venetian fleet by Branimir is celebrated annually on 18 September, as part of Croatian Navy Day.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
