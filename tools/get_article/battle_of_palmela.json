All of these positions were reconquered by the Almohads after the Battle of Alcácer do Sal in 1161, except for Alcácer, which remained in Catholic hands.\nOn February 21, 1165, Afonso I conquered the castle of Sesimbra after realizing that the fortification was poorly defended.\nThe Almohad governor of Badajoz, the largest and most powerful Muslim city in the west of the peninsula, as soon as he learned of what had happened, left for the region to reconquer the castle with a large detachment of soldiers, including knights and pawns. However, the Muslims advanced in poor order. Upon learning of the governor's approach, the Portuguese king took to the field and defeated him in battle near Palmela. Following the battle, Palmela surrendered.\nIn the same year of the conquest of Sesimbra, the battle of Palmela and the occupation of Palmela took place, Évora was also conquered by Gerald the Fearless.\nSee also\n* Portugal in the Middle Ages\n* Portugal in the Reconquista\nReferences"
