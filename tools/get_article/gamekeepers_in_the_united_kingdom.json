Today, some three thousand full-time gamekeepers are employed in the UK, compared to as many as 25,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, there are many people who spend their leisure time and money rearing game and maintaining habitats on their own small shoots.\nThere are several variations in gamekeeping:\n* Stalkers: keepers who specialise in the stealthy pursuit of deer, mainly in the uplands of Scotland.\n* Lowland keepers: rearing pheasant and partridge and managing lowland habitats.\n* Upland keepers: managing moorland for grouse in upland areas.\n* Gillie/river keepers: keepers who manage rivers such as the River Spey for trout and salmon.\ning of heather, one of the countryside management duties of gamekeepers]]\nThe most senior individual dealing with wildlife on a particular estate is often called the head keeper or head stalker.\nGamekeepers and country sports enthusiasts hold that gamekeeping is an essential part of countryside conservation. Two thirds of the UK rural landmass is managed for shooting. The shooting industry creates £1.6 billion. £250 million is spent on conservation as a result of shooting.\nTraining\nSome colleges in the UK now offer courses in gamekeeping up to and including diploma level. Two of these include the Northern School of Game and Wildlife at Newton Rigg College, Cumbria and Myerscough College, Lancashire.\nThe Elmwood Campus of Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) in Cupar, Fife is Scotland's main gamekeeping college. The main campus for attaining both NC and HNC levels in gamekeepeing for south Scotland is borders college. Easton and Otley college: Easton Campus also provides a course on gamekeeping level 2 and 3.\nScottish Gamekeepers Association\nIn 1997, as a result of months of adverse media criticism of gamekeepers, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) was formed with a goal of promoting the work of gamekeepers and developing training in the area of law and best practices in the field of game management. The SGA chairman is Alex Hogg, a gamekeeper from Scotland.\nThe National Gamekeepers' Organisation\nIn 1997, the National Gamekeepers' Organisation (NGO) was set up for the same reasons and in addition they felt that the main shooting association was not representing the keepers properly. The NGO now has some 15,000 members. The NGO run industry-based training for keepers and were the first organisation to react to EU legislation with regard to game meat hygiene, producing a course for experienced keepers and stalkers which had approval from the Food Standards Agency. The NGO continue to promote gamekeeping, stalking, shooting, and fishing. Its chairman is Lindsay Waddell, a gamekeeper from Co. Durham. The NGO also have dedicated moorland and deer branches.\nCriticism\nThe League Against Cruel Sports estimates some 12,300 wild mammals and birds are killed on UK shooting estates every day and sees gamekeepers as playing a key role in the destruction of wildlife. On the other hand, the shooting industry says that gamekeepers are vital wildlife conservation workers in the countryside. The National Gamekeeper's Organisation (NGO) claims that nine times as much of the British countryside is looked after by gamekeepers as is in nature reserves and National Parks.\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has criticised the persecution of birds of prey on some shooting estates. 68% of those convicted of raptor persecution are gamekeepers. \"We’ve seen evidence linking gamekeepers to bird of prey persecution, and moorlands empty of raptors imply that much more illegal killing goes on undetected\".\nIn fiction\n* Alec Scudder in Maurice by E.
