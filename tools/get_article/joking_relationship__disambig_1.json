Two main variations are described: an asymmetrical relationship where one party is required to take no offence at constant teasing or mocking by the other, and a symmetrical relationship where each party makes fun at the other's expense.\nThe joking relationship is an interaction that mediates and stabilizes social relationships where there is tension, competition, or potential conflict, such as between in-laws and between clans and tribes.\nJoking relationships can also exist between nations. Writing on the joking relationships between the Scandinavian countries, sociologist Peter Gundelach states, \"Joking relationships are social relations where citizens of two nations tease one another by employing stereotypes. Therefore a joking relationship can only be established between nations that are somehow related to each other.\"\nExtent\nWhile first documented academically by Radcliffe-Brown in the 1920s, this type of relationship is now understood to be very widespread across societies in general. In West Africa, particularly in Mali, it is regarded as a centuries-old cultural institution known as sanankuya.\nJoking relationships existed among the Tio people (in Republic of Congo) between members of the opposite sex and same generation, and between grandmothers and grandchildren.\nAntithesis\nThis type of relationship contrasts strongly with societies where so-called avoidance speech or \"mother-in-law\" language is imposed to minimise interaction between the two parties, as in many Australian Aboriginal languages. Donald F. Thomson's article The Joking Relationship and Organized Obscenity in North Queensland gives an in-depth discussion of a number of societies where these two speech styles co-exist. The joking relationships which are most unconstrained and free are between classificatory Father's Father and Son's Son—which appears to be the same situation as in the Plains cultures of North America.\nSee also\n* Dozens (game)\n* Ethnic joke\nSources\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070510193252/http://www.answers.com/topic/alfred-radcliffe-brown Alfred Radcliffe-Brown Biography] from Answers.com"
