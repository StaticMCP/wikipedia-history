The school closed down in 2003.\nThe school motto Ex pulvere palma means (loosely): \"out of the dust (of competition) (comes) the palm\" (of victory)\nHistory\nThe school, which was located on London Road site was opened in 1857 with buildings designed by builder Decimus Burton. Consisting of only one schoolroom originally, the school later built a library, head master's house later to house the school office, and head master's office.\nIn 1890, an adjoining gymnasium was added, with above it a large projection room. 1906 meant the erection of, along the Dominie Cross Road, several ‘temporary’ buildings, which included the so-called \"Tin Tab\".\nIn 1912, the school pupils, like those of many other schools of the day, donated monies to fund dogs for the 1912 Arctic expedition of Robert Falcon Scott.\nThe Fives Court was gifted in 1924 in the memory of William Eyre a fallen World War 1 casualty. In 1926 a new block of classrooms was opened containing the first library. The iron guttering still bears that date in 2019.\nFile:1924 fives court in 2016 (GM).jpg|The fives court in 2016 before its redevelopment repaint\nFile:2016 12 New Block King Edwward VI School Retford (GM).jpg|The 1926 extension, a \"New Block\" in its time, photographed in 2016.\nFile:2003 KEGS G.Moss gym later dinning hall.jpg|King Edward VI Grammar School dining hall\nIn 1937, a new Assembly hall was added.\nPre-War\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|-\n!
