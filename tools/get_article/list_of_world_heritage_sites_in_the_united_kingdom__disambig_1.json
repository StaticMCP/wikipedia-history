Greater London is home to the cultural sites of Maritime Greenwich, Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, Tower of London, and Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey including Saint Margaret's Church.The sites of Gough Island (South Atlantic), Henderson Island (South Pacific), St George, Bermuda, and Gorham's Cave (Gibraltar) are not shown on the map.\n|float = right\n|label =\n|width = 330\n|places =\n}}\n}}\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty are defined as natural heritage. The United Kingdom ratified the convention on 29 May 1984, making its sites eligible for inclusion on the list.\nThere are 35 World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories. Out of these sites, one site is located in both England and Scotland (the Frontiers of the Roman Empire), eighteen are exclusively in England, seven in Scotland, four in Wales, two in Northern Ireland, and one in each of the overseas territories of Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Pitcairn Islands, and Saint Helena. The first sites in the UK to be inscribed on the World Heritage List were Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast; Durham Castle and Cathedral; Ironbridge Gorge; Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey; Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites; and the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd in 1986. The most recent site listed was Gracehill, as a part of transnational site Moravian Church Settlements, in 2024. Among the 35 sites, 29 are listed for their cultural significance, five for their natural significance, and one, St Kilda, for both. In addition, there are five sites on the tentative list. The UK has served on the World Heritage Committee once.\nThree sites are transnational and are shared with other countries. Frontiers of the Roman Empire is shared with Germany, the Great Spa Towns of Europe with six European countries, and Moravian Church Settlements with Denmark, Germany, and the United States. In 2012, the World Heritage Committee added Liverpool– Maritime Mercantile City to the List of World Heritage in Danger, citing threats to the site's integrity from planned urban development projects. The site, originally listed in 2004 for its cultural significance, was eventually removed from the list in 2021, making it one of the only three sites in the world to have been removed from the World Heritage Site register.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i to vi are cultural, and vii to x are natural.\nTransnational site|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast\n|\n| County Antrim, Northern Ireland\n| 1986\n| 369bis; vii, viii (natural)\n| The landscape with thousands of basalt columns was created by volcanic activity in the Tertiary, around 60 million years ago. The resulting land formations on one hand inspired legends of giants and on the other hand influenced the development of Earth sciences over the last 300 years. A minor boundary modification of the site took place in 2016.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Durham Castle and Cathedral\n|\n| Durham, England\n| 1986\n| 370bis; ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| Durham Cathedral (pictured), built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, is a prominent example of Norman architecture in England and vaulting of the cathedral was part of the advent of Gothic architecture. The cathedral houses relics of St Cuthbert and Bede and was a centre of a Benedictine monastic community. The Norman castle was the residence of the Durham prince-bishops. A minor boundary modification of the site took place in 2008.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ironbridge Gorge\n|\n| Shropshire, England\n| 1986\n| 371; i, ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| In the early 18th century, Ironbridge Gorge was an early site of the Industrial Revolution. A blast furnace built by Abraham Darby I in Coalbrookdale was the first to use coke to smelt iron. Today, the industrial heritage is well preserved, with mines, manufacturing plants, workers houses, and transport systems. The Iron Bridge (pictured), constructed in 1779 by Abraham Darby III, was world's first metal bridge.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey\n|\n| North Yorkshire, England\n| 1986\n| 372bis; i, iv (cultural)\n| The estate comprises 18th century landscaped gardens, historic buildings, water features, and parks. The garden is an outstanding example of an English garden. Buildings in the park include the ruins of the 12th century Fountains Abbey (a former Cistercian monastery, pictured) and the Victorian Gothic St Mary's church. A minor boundary modification of the site took place in 2012.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites\n|\n| Wiltshire, England\n| 1986\n| 373bis; i, ii, iii (cultural)\n| This site comprises a series of megalithic monuments that were created by Neolithic and Bronze Age societies around 3700 to 1600 BCE. Stonehenge (pictured) is the world's most architecturally sophisticated prehistoric stone circle while Avebury has the world's largest stone circle and Silbury Hill, a large artificial mound. The sites provide an insight into the culture, technology, and astronomical knowledge of the societies that created them. A minor boundary modification of the site took place in 2008.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd\n|\n| Four sites in north Wales\n| 1986\n| 374; i, iii, iv (cultural)\n| During the reign of Edward I of England (1272–1307), a series of castles were constructed in Wales with the purpose of subduing the population and establishing English colonies in the region. Four castles are listed: Beaumaris (pictured), Caernarfon, Conwy, and Harlech. These castles are considered the pinnacle of military architecture by military historians.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | St Kilda\n|\n| Outer Hebrides, Scotland\n| 1986\n| 387ter; iii, v, vii, ix, x (mixed)\n| The remote archipelago of volcanic origin was shaped by weathering and glaciation that produced a dramatic landscape with high cliffs. The islands are important habitat for seabirds such as the northern gannet, Atlantic puffin, and northern fulmar, who nest there in large numbers. Initially listed for its natural significance, the site was expanded in 2004 and 2005 to account for its cultural significance. The islands were inhabited for at least two millennia, with people subsisting in extreme climate on products of birds and sheep farming. Their activities resulted in a specific cultural landscape with houses, enclosures, and storage structures. The last permanent inhabitants left the islands in 1930.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Blenheim Palace\n|\n| Oxfordshire, England\n| 1987\n| 425; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The residence of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, was designed by architects John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor in the early 18th century. The associated park was landscaped by Capability Brown. The palace celebrated victory over the French and is significant for establishing English romantic architecture as a separate entity from French classical architecture. It was also the home of Sir Winston Churchill.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey including Saint Margaret's Church\n|\n| Greater London, England\n| 1987\n| 426bis; i, ii, iv (cultural)\n| The buildings comprising this site are deeply connected to the British monarchy. The medieval Westminster Abbey, with representative stages of the Gothic architecture, is the place where British monarchs are crowned, married, and buried. The Westminster Palace (pictured), the seat of the Parliament, was rebuilt after 1840 in the neo-Gothic style, with the iconic Big Ben (Elizabeth Tower). St Margaret's Church is the parish church and was built in the Perpendicular Gothic style.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | City of Bath\n|\n| Somerset, England\n| 1987\n| 428; i, ii, iv (cultural)\n| Bath was founded in the 1st century CE under the Romans who used it as a spa. The Roman Baths (pictured) are still preserved. It was a centre for wool industry in the Middle Ages, the Bath Abbey dates to that period. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the city was developed by Georgian architects who constructed architectural ensembles such as the Circus and the Royal Crescent. Bath is also a part of a separate transnational site The Great Spa Towns of Europe.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#E0F0FF;\" | Frontiers of the Roman Empire\n|\n| Sites in England and Scotland\n| 1987\n| 430ter; ii, ii, iv (cultural)\n| Limes was a defense system, delimiting the borders of the Roman Empire that reached its peak in the 2nd century CE. Today, there are remains of the walls, forts, ditches, watchtowers, and civilian settlements. Hadrian's Wall (pictured), constructed , was listed in 1987. The Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes in today's Germany was added to the site in 2005 and the Antonine Wall, the construction of which started in 142 CE, was added in 2008. These three fortification systems demonstrate the sophistication of Roman miitary engineering and were influential in the following historical periods.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Henderson Island\n|\n| Pitcairn Islands\n| 1988\n| 487; vii, x (natural)\n| The largest of the Pitcairn Islands is an uplifted coral atoll in the South Pacific. Due to being unsuitable for agriculture and with little fresh water, is has remained uninhabited and thus largely untouched by human impact. For a tropical island of its size, it has a remarkable biological diversity, with numerous endemic animal and plant species, including four species of land birds. It is also an important nesting site for seabirds. The island provides insight into evolution and speciation of flora and fauna in an island environment.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tower of London\n|\n| Greater London, England\n| 1988\n| 488; ii, iv (cultural)\n| Commissioned by William the Conqueror following the Norman conquest of England, the Tower of London is a symbol of power and an example of Norman military architecture that spread across England. Additions in the following centuries made the castle one of the most influential buildings of its kind in England. The White Tower, the centre of the fortress, is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Canterbury Cathedral, St Augustine's Abbey, and St Martin's Church\n|\n| Kent, England\n| 1988\n| 496; i, ii, vi (cultural)\n| St Martin's Church is the oldest church in England. The church and St Augustine's Abbey, today in ruins, were founded during the early stages of the introduction of Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons, in the late 6th century. The cathedral (pictured) exhibits Romanesque and early Gothic architecture, and is the seat of the Church of England. It saw partial rebuilding after a fire in 1174.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old and New Towns of Edinburgh\n|\n| Edinburgh, Scotland\n| 1995\n| 728; ii, iv (cultural)\n| Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland since the 15th century, comprises two distinct districts. The medieval Old Town located on a ridge and dominated by the Edinburgh Castle (pictured) and preserves the old street layout. Important historical buildings include St Giles' Cathedral and Holyrood Palace. The New Town was built in the Georgian era in the 18th and 19th centuries. The carefully planned layout of the urban ensembles had major influence on urban planning in Europe and beyond,\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gough and Inaccessible Islands\n|\n| Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n| 1995\n| 740bis; vii, v (natural)\n| The two islands in the Southern Atlantic Ocean are eroded remains of ancient volcanoes. They represent some of the least disturbed cool temperate island ecosystems in that part of the world and are especially important for seabirds that nest there in colonies. There are also some endemic species of land birds and numerous endemic plant species. Gough Island Wildlife Reserve was independently listed in 1995, Inaccessible Island was added in 2004.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maritime Greenwich\n|\n| Greater London, England\n| 1997\n| 795; i, ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| Greenwich has some of the first examples of Palladian architecture in England, including the Queen's House by Inigo Jones, and buildings designed by Christopher Wren (the Old Royal Naval College pictured).
