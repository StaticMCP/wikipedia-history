In previous years, to be eligible for the Gothams, a film's budget couldn't exceed $35 million. \"We're excited to include more voices from around the globe by expanding eligibility for the many brilliant international films and filmmakers who deserve to be in consideration this year,\" said Jeffrey Sharp, executive director of the Gotham Film & Media Institute. \"Additionally, with shifting budgets, we've decided to eliminate arbitrary budget caps for submission eligibility – first instituted over a decade ago – to broaden our reach in terms of recognition and accessibility to the wider community,\" he concluded.\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n, Best Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Best Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Performance winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" role=\"presentation\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Past Lives\n** Passages\n** Reality\n** Showing Up\n** A Thousand and One\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Anatomy of a Fall – Justine Triet and Arthur Harari'\n** All of Us Strangers – Andrew Haigh\n** May December – Samy Burch; story by Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik\n** R.M.N. – Cristian Mungiu\n** The Zone of Interest – Jonathan Glazer\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Four Daughters\n** 20 Days in Mariupol\n** Against the Tide\n** Apolonia, Apolonia\n** Our Body\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Anatomy of a Fall\n** All of Us Strangers\n** Poor Things\n** Tótem\n** The Zone of Interest\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'A.
