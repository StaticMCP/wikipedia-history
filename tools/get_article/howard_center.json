Howard Center collaborates with many community partners and is a United Way of Northwest Vermont-funded agency.\nServices and supports are community-based and provided in more than 60 locations, including area schools, hospitals, emergency rooms, and client homes, in addition to Howard Center offices and residential homes.

Howard Center also operates outreach teams in Burlington and the surrounding communities.\nSpecialized programs\nThe organization operates three therapeutic schools:\n* The Baird School, Burlington, provides an alternative educational environment for children ages 5–15 in grades K-8.\n* Jean Garvin School in Williston provides a therapeutic educational program offering learning opportunities to inspire personal change and well-being for adolescents, ages 12–8 in grades 7–12.\n* Fay Honey Knopp Memorial School in the city of Rutland is a licensed school that provides educational, therapeutic, and transition services to residents of HowardCenter's Park Street Program for adolescent males with sexual harming behaviors.\n* School Services: Howard Center's School Services Program helps children ages 3 to 22—and their families—who face a broad range of challenges that may impact learning and school behavior.\n* Howard Center supports clients in recovery from substance use.\nWhen the Chittenden Clinic was established in 2002, it was the first medication assisted treatment clinic for opioid addiction in Vermont.
