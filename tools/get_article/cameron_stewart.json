      "text": "# Cameron Stewart\n\nCameron Stewart (born 1975) is a Canadian comic book creator. He first came to prominence when he collaborated as an illustrator with writer Grant Morrison, and he went on to illustrate Catwoman and co-write Batgirl. He won Eisner and Shuster Awards for his self-published mystery web comic Sin Titulo, and received an Eisner nomination for The Other Side (written by Jason Aaron).\nEarly life\nStewart was born in Canada to British parents.\nCareer\nStewart began working for DC around 2000, inking the last half of Deadenders, written by Ed Brubaker and penciled by Warren Pleece. In 2002 he started work on Brubaker's run on Catwoman.\nIn 2004 he illustrated Seaguy, a 3-issue series written by Grant Morrison. The team followed this the next year with the 4-issue Seven Soldiers: Guardian. Stewart and Morrison returned to Seaguy with Seaguy: Slaves of Mickey Eye in 2009. Stewart continued his collaboration with Morrison, illustrating issues #7–9 and #16 of Batman and Robin in 2010, and an issue of Morrison's Multiversity limited series.\nBeginning in 2006, he collaborated with writer Jason Aaron on The Other Side, a serialized graphic novel about the Vietnam War, published by Vertigo. The series was nominated in 2007 for an Eisner Award for Best Limited Series.\nStewart worked on a variety of smaller projects. He illustrated The Apocalypstix, written by Ray Fawkes and published by Oni Press in 2008. With Karl Kerschl he co-wrote and co-drew the 2011 miniseries ''Assassin's Creed: The Fall'', based on the Assassin's Creed video game series. He also worked on four issues of the SuicideGirls comic book in 2011.\nAway from the major comics publishers, Stewart wrote, illustrated Sin Titulo (Untitled in Spanish), a black and white crime story which he self-published online from 2007 to 2012. The comic received a 2009 Joe Shuster Award for Webcomics, and the 2010 Eisner Award for Best Digital Comic. It was later published in print by Dark Horse Comics.\nIn 2014, when Gail Simone left Batgirl, Stewart took over writing the series and was joined by co-writer Brenden Fletcher, artist Babs Tarr, and colorist Jordie Bellaire. After the series ended in 2016, the team of Stewart, Fletcher and Tarr collaborated on Motor Crush, published by Image Comics.\nStewart illustrated two sequels to the novel Fight Club, written by author Chuck Palahniuk. Fight Club 2 was published in 2015, and Fight Club 3 was published in 2019. In early 2020, Stewart worked again with Brubaker to contribute a 12-page story titled \"The Art of Picking a Lock\" to DC Comics' Catwoman 80th Anniversary 100-Page Super Spectacular #1.\nControversy\nIn June 2020, Stewart was accused by multiple people of predatory sexual behavior. At the time the events happened, the accusers were much younger fans, friends or aspiring artists in their teens and early twenties, and Stewart was in his mid to late thirties. The accusers said that he used his status as a professional artist to get them to trust him, while all along this was a pretext for his real intent of making sexual advances, or grooming. Polygon reported that \"according to some corroborating voices [...] Stewart's reputation for this behavior was widely known in Toronto's close-knit comics community\".\nIn response to this, DC dropped Stewart from an unannounced project he was working on. W. Maxwell Prince and Martin Morazzo, creators of the Image Comics series Ice Cream Man, canceled Stewart's variant cover to the next issue of the series.\nBibliography\nInterior work\n*Superman Adventures (DC Comics):\n** \"22 Stories in a Single Bound\" (with Mark Millar, among other artists, in #41, 2000)\n** \"Four-Point Perspective\" (with Dan Slott, in #57, 2001)\n*The Invisibles vol. 3 #2: \"The Moment of the Blitz\" (with Grant Morrison, among other artists, Vertigo, 2000)\n*The Dreaming #51: \"Second Sight\" (inks on Christian Højgaard, written by Caitlin R.
