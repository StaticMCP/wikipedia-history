Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. However, one elector did not vote and another elector was not chosen because an election district failed to submit returns, resulting in only 10 electoral votes being submitted.\nVirginia unanimously voted for nonpartisan candidate and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army George Washington. The total popular vote is composed of 3,337 for Federalist electors and 456 for Anti-Federalist electors, all of whom were supportive of Washington. The total number of votes is incomplete.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1788-1789 United States presidential election in Virginia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent\n| George Washington\n| align=\"right\" | 3,793\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 10\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 3,793\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 10\n|-\n|}\nElectors\nThe following served as electors: -\n* John Pride - previously voted against ratification of the Constitution.\n* John Harvie\n* Zachariah Johnston - Augusta County, Botetourt County, Bourbon County, Fayette County, Greenbrier County, Jefferson County, Lincoln County, Madison County, Mercer County, Montgomery County, Nelson County, Pendleton County, Rockbridge County, Rockingham County, Russell County, Shenandoah County, Washington County\n* John Roane - one of the three Clinton electors\n* David Stuart\n* William Fitzhugh\n* Anthony Walke, Princess Anne Co.\n* Patrick Henry - previously voted against ratification of the Constitution.\n* Edward Stevens\n* Warner Lewis – did not attend the electoral college meeting.\n* James Wood\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Virginia\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*"
