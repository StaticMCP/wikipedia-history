They can be found in various cultural and religious symbolic materials all around Asia, specifically in South, Southeast Asia and distinctly in East Asian cultures (Chinese folk-religion).  He is known in many different names across Asia depending on the local language such as, Ryūō in Japanese. (Korean Dragon, Indian Dragon, Vietnamese Dragon and more)\nHe can manipulate and control the weather, move seasons and bring rainfall with his divine power at his own will, thus, he is regarded as the dispenser of rain, divine ruler of the Seas, rivers and water bodies,  commanding over all bodies of water.  He is the collective personification of the ancient concept of the lóng in Chinese culture and Nāgarāja in Indian culture. It is described that they have their own under-water palace and a royal court system of their own.\nThere are also the cosmological \"Dragon Kings of the Four Seas\" ().\nBesides being a water deity, the Dragon God frequently also serves as a territorial tutelary deity, similarly to Tudigong \"Lord of the Earth\" and Houtu \"Queen of the Earth\".\nOrigins\nSerpent like creatures have been regarded as core part of Asian culture since 7000–5000 BCE (Neolithic period) at least. Numerous Serpent like crafts, marks and designs have been discovered in many archeological sites from south, southeast and east asia (Notably from ancient archeological sites of China and India), which proves that the serpent/naga/dragon symbolically has been part of the local folklores, rituals and festivals in these areas from a really long time. As time has passed the Dragon culture has been adapted and shifted in various forms, terms, tales and cultures through generation around these regions and the folk-religious cultures.\nSingular Dragon King\nThe Dragon King has been regarded as holding dominion over all bodies of water,}} and the dispenser of rain, in rituals practiced into the modern era in China. One of his epithets is Dragon King of Wells and Springs.\nRainmaking rituals\nDragon processions have been held on the fifth and sixth moon of the lunisolar calendar all over China, especially on the 13th day of the sixth moon, held to be the Dragon King's birthday, as ritualized supplication to the deity to make rain. In Changli County, Hebei Province a procession of sorts carried an image of the Dragon King in a basket and made circuit around nearby villages, and the participants would put out in front of their house a piece of yellow paper calligraphed with the text: \"The position [=tablet] of the Dragon King of the Four Seas , Five Lakes, Eight Rivers and Nine Streams\", sprinkle it with water using willow withes, and burning incense next to it. This ritual was practiced in North of China into the 20th century.\nIn the past, there used to be Dragon King miao shrines all over China, for the folk to engage in the worship of dragon kings, villages in farm countries would conduct rites dedicated to the Dragon Kings seeking rain.\nIn the Indian Subcontinent, South and South-east Asia, Naga/Dragon worship is an ancient tradition often associated with rainfall and fertility, particularly during the monsoon season through offerings incense, milk, turmeric, and flowers in Nāga shrines, temples, carved stones (Nāga stones) or more elaborate structures. Naga worship predates Vedic traditions and was later integrated into Hinduism, Buddhism, Shamanism and Jainism. There is a Hindu festival Naga panchami dedicated to serpent deities. There are numerous Serpent/Dragon deities and numerous temples or shrines dedicated to them such as Sagara, Varuna is also one of the oldest deities, often depicted as the God of the oceans, rivers, and all water bodies.  People offer prayers and other offerings for rainmaking rituals and agriculture.\nIn Japan, rainmaking rituals, one of these is known as \"amagoi\" (雨乞い) which has been practiced for centuries for rain during the times of drought. These rainmaking rituals varied and often involve Shinto and Buddhist ceremonies, with prayers, offerings and symbolic actions aimed to influence weather patterns and please the heaven. The water-related deities and dragons are central to these rituals.  Many Japanese Shinto shrines have dragon imagery which are dedicated to the dragon god, reflecting their importance in the religion.\nIn Korea, Dragons are rather worshiped through folk beliefs and rituals. Yongwang is honored in village rituals, mainly in fishing communities.  Prayers are offered for successful catches and safe voyages, rain and agriculture. Buddhist monks would sometimes burn their forearms or fingers in supplication for rain. In ancient Korea, rainmaking rituals were called \"Giuje\" (祈雨祭) which used to be performed during times of drought to invoke rain. These rituals varied and involved both government officials and commoners.  It also included Buddhist monks and female shamans to perform the rituals. In one of the rituals named \"Seokcheok-dongja\" (石尺童子), children would torment a lizard (symbolizing a dragon) in the belief that it would induce the dragon to bring rain.\nAs Protector\nDragon or Naga also symbolically represents good luck and protection in the Asian culture. They symbolize wisdom, strength, and good fortune, embodying a fierce compassion that safeguards the sacred knowledge and maintains cosmic balance. In religion, they are revered as powerful protectors of the Dharma and the teachings.\nDragons/Nagas stand guard at all Buddhist temples throughout Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Malaysia.  In Indonesia, Nagas are often depicted battling garuḍas. Carved nāga art and sculptures are found as stairs railings in bridges or stairs, such as those found in Balinese temples, Ubud monkey forest, and Taman Sari in Yogyakarta. (Main article Nāga)\nMoreover, nāgas are sometimes linked to medicine due to the symbolizing of knowledge, wisdom and protection. The nāgas can also be founded substituting the snakes in either Rod of Asclepius or Caduceus of several medical field's symbols. In legends, Nāga Vasuki is present in the legend of the Samudra Manthana, in which Dhanvantari (god of Ayurveda, Asian traditional medicine or alchemist) and amrita (the elixir of eternal life) were churned from the Ocean of Milk by him.\nDaoist pantheon\nWithin the Daoist pantheon, the Dragon King is regarded the zoomorphic representation of the yang masculine power of generation. The dragon king is the king of the dragons and he also controls all of the creatures in the sea. The dragon king gets his orders from the Jade Emperor.(Main article Chinese Dragon)\nDragon Kings of the Five Regions\n(North/Winter)|boxstyle_BLK= background-color: #000 ;color: white}}\n(West/Autumn)|boxstyle_WH= background-color: #fff ;color: black|YEL=Yellow Dragon(Center/Summer's end)|boxstyle_YEL= background-color: yellow ;color: black |BLU=Blue/Green Dragon(East/Spring)|boxstyle_BLU= background-color:#00f ;color: white}}\n(South/Summer)|boxstyle_RED= background-color: #f00 ;color: black}}\n}}\nHistorically there arose a cult of the Five Dragon Kings. The name  is registered in Daoist scripture from the Tang dynasty, found in the Dunhuang caves. Veneration of chthonic dragon god(s) of the five directions still persists today in southern areas, such as Canton and Fujian. It has also been conflated with the cult of Lord Earth, Tugong (Tudigong), and inscriptions on tablets invoke the  in rituals current in Southeast Asia (Vietnam).\nDescription\nThe Azure Dragon or Blue-Green Dragon (), or Green Dragon (), is the Dragon God of the east, and of the essence of spring. Azure Dragon is associated as the Dragon King of the East sea, Ao Guang.\nThe Red Dragon ( or , literally \"Cinnabar Dragon\", \"Vermilion Dragon\") is the Dragon God of the south and of the essence of summer. The Red Dragon is associated as the Dragon king of the South sea, Ao Qin.\nThe White Dragon () is the Dragon God of the west and the essence of autumn. The White Dragon is associated as the Dragon King of the West sea, Ao Run.\nThe Yellow Dragon () is the Dragon God of the center, associated with (late) summer.}} Yellow Dragon is directly associated as Jade Emperor and Yellow Emperor, it is considered that the mythical Emperor is the reincarnation of the Yellow Dragon.\nThe Black Dragon (), also called \"Dark Dragon\" or \"Mysterious Dragon\" (), is the Dragon God of the north and the essence of winter. The Black Dragon is associated as the Dragon King of the North sea, Ao Shun.\nBroad history\nfrom Baoning Temple in Shanxi, China.]]\n.}}}}]]\nDragons of the Five Regions/Directions existed in Chinese custom, established by the Former Han period(200BCE) (Cf. §Origins below). The same concept couched in \"dragon king\"  (longwang) terminology from \"dragon\" was centuries later, the term \"dragon king\" being imported from India (Sanskrit naga-raja), vis Buddhism, introduced during 1st century CE the Later Han.\nThe five \"Dragon Kings\" which were correlated with the Five Colors and Five Directions are attested uniquely in one work among Buddhist scriptures (), called the  early 4th century. It gives the names of the for the dragon kings of the five colors and five directions.}} Attributed to Po-Srimitra, it is a pretended translation, or \"apocryphal sutra\" (post-canonical text), but its influence on later rituals (relating to entombment) is not dismissable.\nThe dragon king cult was most active around the Sui-Tang dynasty, according to one scholar, but another observes that the cult spread farther afield with the backing of Song dynasty monarchs who built Dragon King Temples (or rather Taoist shrines), and Emperor Huizong of Song (12th century) conferred investiture upon them as local kings. But the dragon king and other spell incantations came to be discouraged in Buddhism within China, because they were based on eclectic (apocryphal) sutras and the emphasis grew for the orthodox sutras, or put another way, the quinary system (based on number 5) was being superseded by the number 8 or number 12 being held more sacred.\nDuring the Tang period, the dragon kings were also regarded as guardians that safeguard homes and pacify tombs, in conjunction with the worship of Lord Earth.. The spell invokes the white and black dragon kings, and three by name, but the names don't really match those given by the .}} Buddhist rainmaking rituals were also learned during Tang dynasty China.\nThe concept was transmitted to Japan alongside Vajrayana Buddhism, and also practiced as rites in  during the Heian Period.\nFive dragons\n;(Origins)\nThe idea of associating the five directions/regions () with the five colors is found in Confucian classic text, }}\nThe Huainanzi (2nd cent. BC) describes the five colored dragons (azure/green, red, white, black, yellow)  and their associations (Chapter 4: Terrestrial Forms), as well as the placement of sacred beasts in the five directions (the Four Symbols beasts, dragon, tiger, bird, tortoise in the four cardinal directions and the yellow dragon.\nAnd the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals attributed to Dong Zhongshu (2nd cent. BC) describes the ritual involving five colored dragons.\nAttestations of Five Dragon Kings\nConsecration Sutra\nThe apocryphal  (early 4th century, attributed to Po-Srimitra ), which purports to be Buddhist teachings but in fact incorporates elements of Chinese traditional belief,: .}} associates five dragon kings with five colored dragons with five directions, as aforementioned.\nThe text gives the personal names of the kings. To the east is the Blue Dragon Spirit King () named , with 49 dragon kings under him, with 70 myriad myllion lesser dragons, mountain spirits, and assorted  demons as minions. The thrust of this scripture is that in everywhere in every direction, there are the minions causing poisonings and ailments, and their lord the dragon kings must be beseeched in prayer to bring relief. In the south is the Red Dragon Spirit King named , in the west the White, called , in the north the Black, called  and at center the Yellow, called , with different numbers subordinate dragon kings, with minion hordes of lesser dragons and other beings.\nThough connection of poison to rainmaking may not be obvious, it has been suggested that this poison-banishing sutra could have viably been read as a replacement in the execution of the ritual to pray for rain (, ), in Japan. A medieval commentary (, copied 1310) has reasoned that since the Great Peacock (Mahāmāyūrī) sūtra mandates one to chant dragon names in order to detoxify, so shall offerings made to dragon lead to \"sweet rain\".\nDivine Incantations Scripture\nThe  (\"five position\") dragon kings are also attested in the , though not explicitly under the collective name of \"five position dragon kings\", but individually as \"Eastern Direction's Blue Emperor Blue Dragon King ()\", and so forth. It gives a laundry list of dragon kings by different names, stating that spells to cause rain can be performed by invoking dragon kings.\nRitual process\nAn ancient procedural instruction for invoking five-colored dragons to conduct rainmaking rites occurs in the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals, under its \"Seeking Rain\" chapter (originally 2nd century B.C.). It prescribes earthenware figurines of greater and lesser dragons of a specific color according to season, namely blue-green, red, yellow, white, black, depending on whether it was spring, summer, late summer (), autumn, or winter. And these figures were to be placed upon the alter at the assigned position/direction (east, south, center, west, or north)..}}\nThis Chinese folk rain ritual later became incorporated into Daoism. The rituals were codified into Daoist scripture or Buddhist sūtras in the post-Later Han () period, but Dragon King worship did not come into ascendancy until the Sui-Tang dynasties. The rain rituals in Esoteric Buddhism in the Tang dynasty was actually an adaptation of indigenous Chinese dragon worship and rainmaking beliefs, rather than pure Buddhism.\nAs a point of illustration, a comparison can be made against Buddhist procedures for rainmaking during the Tang dynasty. The rainmaking tract in Atikūṭa 's translated , (Book 11, under the chapter for ) prescribes an altar to be built, with mud figures of dragon kings placed on the four sides, and numerous mud-made lesser dragons arranged within and without the altar.'s edited work   quotes from this sutra: \"As the Collected Dhāraṇī Sūtras, 11 states, this altar should have a single-walled and four-gated boundary be made around its field. And on the East gate of the altar, the gate officer should be crafted out of mud, in the embodiment of the dragon king \".}}\nDragon Kings of the Four Seas\n, Hainan.]]\nEach one of the four Dragon Kings of the Four Seas () is associated with a body of water corresponding to one of the four cardinal directions and natural boundaries of China: the East Sea (corresponding to the East China Sea also, parts of the Pacific), the South Sea (corresponding to the South China Sea, West Philippines Sea ), the West Sea (The Qinghai Lake sometimes also, Indian Ocean , Bay of Bengal and beyond), and the North Sea (Lake Baikal , Sea of Japan, and also the Arctic Ocean).\nThey appear in the classical novels like The Investiture of the Gods and Journey to the West. In Ramayana Ocean King Varuna(Ao-Run) assists Rama to create the Ram-setu.\nIn Fengshen Yanyi and Journey to the West where each of them has a proper name, and they share the surname Ao (, meaning \"playing\" or \"proud\"). The origin of their family name, Ao (敖), however, remains unclear. The names of the Dragon Kings also vary according to the stories they are featured in.\nDragon of the Eastern Sea\nHis proper name is Ao Guang ( or ), and he is the patron of the East China Sea. He is often directly associated as the Dragon King Sagara.\nDragon of the Western Sea\nHis proper names are Ao Run (), Ao Jun () or Aó Jí (). He is the patron of Qinghai Lake, sometimes also the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and beyond. Naga king Varuna is associated as him many times due to relations with Chinese Western Religion.\nDragon of the Southern Sea\nHe is the patron of the South China Sea, West Philippine Sea and his proper name is Ao Qin ().\nDragon of the Northern Sea\nHis proper names are Ao Shun () or Ao Ming (), and his body of water is Lake Baikal, Sea of Japan sometimes also, the Arctic Ocean.\nWorship of the Dragon God\nWorship of the Dragon God is celebrated throughout China with sacrifices and processions during the fifth and sixth moons, and especially on the date of his birthday the thirteenth day of the sixth moon. A folk religious movement of associations of good-doing in modern Hebei is primarily devoted to a generic Dragon God whose icon is a tablet with his name inscribed on it, utilized in a ritual known as the \"movement of the Dragon Tablet\". The Dragon God is traditionally venerated with dragon boat racing.\nIn coastal regions of China, Korea, Vietnam, traditional legends and worshipping of whales (whale gods) have been referred to Dragon Kings after the arrival of Buddhism.\nBuddhism\n\"There were eight dragon kings, the dragon king Nanda, the dragon king Upananda, the dragon king Sagara, the dragon king Vasuki, the dragon king Takshaka, the dragon king Anavatapta, the dragon king Manasvin, the dragon king Utpalaka, each with several hundreds of thousands of followers.\"  - Dragon King Sutra\nIn chapter 12 of the Lotus Sutra(Devadatta), The eight-year-old daughter(Longnü) of the dragon king Sagara (Ao-Guang) attained Enlightenment after offering a jewel to Buddha Sakyamuni, hearing Bodhisattva Manjushri and Avalokiteśvara(Bodhisattva Guanyin) preach the sutra in place of her father. In the Budhhist folk tale Complete Tale of Avalokiteśvara and the Southern Seas, the third son of the Dragon king was accidentally captured by a fisherman and later saved by Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. To show her gratitude for saving her brother, Longnü offers the \"Pearl of light\" to Avalokiteśvara and became a disciple of him and soon later Longnü attained Niravana.\nTibetan Buddhism, the nāgas are the followers of Virūpākṣa (Pāli: Virūpakkha), one of the Four Heavenly Kings who guards the western direction. They act as guards upon Mount Sumeru, protecting the dēvas of Trāyastriṃśa from attacks by the asuras. (Main article Nāgaraja, Virūpākṣa)\nApalāla (Pali, Sanskrit) is a water-dwelling Nāga-king in Buddhist mythology. The story of conversion to Buddhism by the Buddha (Pali: Apalāladamana) can be found in Buddhist texts such as Samantapāsādikā and Divyāvadāna.\nSome Buddhist traditions describe a figure named Duo-luo-shi-qi, or Talasikhin, as a Dragon King who resides in a palace located in a pond near the legendary kingdom of Ketumati. It is said that at midnight, he would drizzle in this pond to cleanse himself of dust.\nBuddhist literature features a Nāga King named Dhṛtarāṣṭra(Sanskrit; Pali: Dhataraṭṭha), he is one of the four Heavenly kings who guards the east. He was the father of Gautama Buddha in a past life when Budhha was bodhisattva named Bhūridatta. He is mentioned in Buddhist texts Bhūridatta Jātaka, the Mahamayuri Vidyarajni Sutra  and the Mahāmegha Sūtra.\nArtistic depictions\nFile:三星堆-青铜龙_Sanxingdui_bronze_Chinese_dragon.jpg|Bronze dragon from Sanxingdui, Shang dynasty, China. 1000 BCE\nFile:Naga King Sculpture.jpg|High relief sculpture of Naga couple, from Ajanta Cave #19, Maharashtra, India. 500–1000 BCE\nFile:Dragon_Pendant,_Eastern_Zhou_dynasty_or_Warring_States_period,_c_4th_3rd_century_BC.jpg|Jade dragon pendants, Zhou dynasty, China. 200–1000 BCE\nFile:大天后宮四海龍王神像.jpg|The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas at the Grand Matsu Temple in Tainan.\nFile:安平開臺天后宮四海龍王.jpg|The four Dragon Kings at the Temple of Mazu in Anping, Tainan.\nFile:Dragon image roof ryutakuji.jpg|Dragon at Ryūtaku-ji Temple structure, Japan.\nFile:National Museum Vietnamese History 3.jpg|A Lý dynasty terracotta dragon's head, Vietnam.\nFile:Dragon King.jpg|A wooden sculpture of a Dragon King from Japan's Izumo district, it is believed to belong to a group of more than twenty Shinto deities (Kami).\nFile:Dragon king ryu-oo horyuji.jpg|Ryū-ō 竜王 (Dragon King) Sanskrit = Naga-Raja, 7th Century, Hōryū-ji Temple, Japan.\nFile:Censer phoenix.jpg|Censer of leaping carp transforming into dragon.

It was first performed by Kūkai in the year 824 at Shinsen'en, according to legend, but the first occasion probably took place historically in the year 875, then a second time in 891. The rain ritual came to be performed regularly.\nThe  ritual used two mandalas that featured dragon kings. The Great Mandala that was hung up was of a design that centered around Sakyamuni Buddha, surrounded by the , the ten thousand dragon kings, Bodhisattvas (based on the , \"Scripture of [Summoning] Great Clouds and Petitioning for Rain\"). The other one was a \"spread-out mandala\" ( ) laid flat out on its back, and depicted five dragon kings, which were one-, three-, five-, seven-, and nine-headed (based on the Collected Dhāraṇī Sūtras).\nAlso, there was the \"Five Dragons Festival/ritual\" ( ) that was performed by  or yin-yang masters. The oldest mention of this in literature is from Fusō Ryakuki, the entry of Engi 2/902AD, 17th day of the 6th moon. Sometimes, the performance of the rain ritual by Esoteric Buddhists (shōugyōhō) would be followed in succession by the Five Dragons Ritual from the . The Five Dragon rites performed by the onmyōji or yin yang masters had their heyday around the 10–11th centuries. There are mokkan, or inscribed wooden tablets, used in these rites that have been unearthed (e.g., from an 8–10th century site and a 9th-century site).\nIn Japan, there also developed a legend that the primordial being Banko (Pangu of Chinese myth) sired the Five Dragon Kings, who were invoked in the ritual texts or  read in Shinto or Onmyōdō rites, but the five beings later began to be seen less as monsters and more as wise princes.\nDragon Kings of Bhutan\nAlso the Kings of Bhutan are called the Dragon King as Bhutan in its native language is known as Drukyul which translates as \"The Land of Dragon\". Thus, while kings of Bhutan are known as Druk Gyalpo meaning Dragon King (Bhutan), the Bhutanese people call themselves the Drukpa, meaning \"people of Druk (Bhutan)\". Present King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is the 5th Dragon King.\nSee also\n* Chinese dragon\n* Dragon king theory\n* Lạc Long Quân\n* Nagaraja\n* Nāga\n* ''Prince Nezha's Triumph Against Dragon King\n* Shenlong (神龍)\n* Tianlong (天龍)\n* Typhoon Longwang\n* Watatsumi\n* Ryūjin\n* Wǔfāng Shàngdì - \"Highest Deities of the Five Regions\"\n* Yinglong\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nCitations\nTakeshi Suzuki (2007) \"Ryūō shinkō 竜王信仰\" Sekai daihyakkajiten, Heibonsha; [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E7%AB%9C%E7%8E%8B%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%B0-1215805 竜王信仰] Sekai daihyakkajiten, 2nd. ed., via Kotobank\n|author=Liu An |author-link=Liu An |translator1=John S.
