They formerly competed in the Norwegian Eliteserien of the Norges Amerikanske Idretters Forbund, and the European Federation of American Football tournaments.\nThe club was founded in 1986 and prior to 1992, the team was known as the Westside Vikings. In 2010, the club moved to its current home ground Frogner Stadion.\nThe Vikings have won 8 total national championship titles (trailing only the Vålerenga Trolls, who have 10). The Vikings had the most players (9) on the NoAFF 15th Anniversary All-Star Team (named in 2002). The team also has fierce rivalries with the Vålerenga Trolls, which is the longest rivalry in the NoAFF and in recent years the Eidsvoll 1814s.\nThe Vikings' top international achievement is their 12–6 2000 EFAF EuroCup Championship Game appearance against the London O's in Brussels, a game the Vikings lost 12–6.\nHistory\nThe Vikings were founded in Oslo in September 1986 by a group of friends who had previously played for the Ris, Ullern and Oslo Commerce School high school teams. The founding name of the club was the Westside Vikings, and they immediately entered competition in the then new, three-team Norwegian American Football Federation league, joining the Vålerenga Trolls and the Kolbotn Kodiaks.\nBefore the 2024 season, the Vikings left the Norwegian League and joined the Swedish Superserien.\nResults\nIn 1990, 1991 and 1992 the Vikings won three consecutive National Championships under coach Mark Troop. They lost the National Championship game to the Trolls in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, before they reclaimed the National Championship in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2002.\nThe Vikings senior team have made it to the championship game in all of its years of existence except in 2003 and 2004, when the team did not make the playoffs.\nIn 2008 they did not make it to the EFL quarter finals, after losing against Coventry Cassidy Jets.\nIn 2011 Oslo Vikings again reclaimed the National Championship under head coach Marques Anderson. In 2012, the Oslo Vikings won their 9th National Championship.\nFrom 2016 to 2019 the Vikings won four consecutive National Championships.\nThe Vikings won back-to-back National Championships in 2022 and 2023 before moving to the Swedish Superserien.\nChampionships\nLeague\n*Eliteserien (Norwegian National Championship)\n**Winners (14): 1990, 1991, 1992, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2023\n**Runners-up: 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2022\nCup\n*EFAF EuroCup\n**Winners: 0\n**Runners-up: 1999\nOrganization\nThe Oslo Vikings are members of the Norwegian National Federation of Sports and the European Federation of American Football through their membership in the Norwegian American Football and Cheerleading Federation.
