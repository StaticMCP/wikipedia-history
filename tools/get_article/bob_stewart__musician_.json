He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in music education from the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts and a Master of Education from Lehman College.\nCareer\nStewart taught music in Pennsylvania public schools and at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School in New York City. He is now a professor at the Juilliard School and is a distinguished lecturer at Lehman College.\nStewart has toured and recorded with such artists as Charles Mingus, Gil Evans, Carla Bley, Muhal Richard Abrams, David Murray, Taj Mahal, Dizzy Gillespie, McCoy Tyner, Freddie Hubbard, Don Cherry, Nicholas Payton, Wynton Marsalis, Charlie Haden, Lester Bowie, Bill Frisell, Globe Unity Orchestra and many others in the United States, Europe, and Eastern Asia.\nHe was a frequent collaborator with saxophonist Arthur Blythe from the 1970s into the early 2000s, often taking the place of the string bass that traditionally supports a jazz ensemble. In their review of Blythe's album Lenox Avenue Breakdown, the editors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz called Stewart's title track solo \"one of the few genuinely important tuba statements in jazz.\"\nDiscography\nAs leader\n*1987: First Line (JMT)\n*1988: ''Goin' Home (JMT)\n*2000: Then & Now (Postcards) with Taj Majal, Carlos Ward, Steve Turre, and Graham Haynes\n*2008: Heavy Metal Duo: Work Songs and Other Spirituals\nAs sideman\n'With Ahmed Abdullah's Diaspora and Francisco Mora Catlett's AfroHORN'\n* Jazz: A Music of the Spirit (Amedian, 2019)\nWith Ray Anderson\n*It Just So Happens (Enja, 1987)\nWith Arthur Blythe\n*Metamorphosis (1977)\n*The Grip (1977)\n*Bush Baby (1978)\n*Lenox Avenue Breakdown (Columbia, 1979)\n*Illusions (1980)\n*Blythe Spirit (1981)\n*Elaborations (1982)\n*Light Blue: Arthur Blythe Plays Thelonious Monk (1983)\n*Hipmotism (Enja, 1991)\n*Night Song (Clarity, 1997)\n*Spirits in the Field (Savant, 2000)\n*Focus (Savant, 2002)\n*Exhale (Savant, 2003)\nWith Henry Butler\n*The Village (1987, Impulse!)\nWith Uri Caine\n*The Sidewalks of New York: Tin Pan Alley (Winter & Winter, 1999)\n*The Goldberg Variations (Winter & Winter, 2000)\nWith Don Cherry\n*Multikuti (A&M, 1990)\nWith Gil Evans\n*There Comes a Time (RCA, 1975)\n*Priestess (Antilles, 1977 [1983])\n*Gil Evans Live at the Royal Festival Hall London 1978 (RCA, 1979)\nWith Bill Frisell\n*Rambler\nWith Dizzy Gillespie and Machito\n*Afro-Cuban Jazz Moods (Pablo, 1975)\nWith Howard Johnson and Gravity\n* Gravity!!!
