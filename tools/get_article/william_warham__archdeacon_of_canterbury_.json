His predecessor Hugh Peynthwyn died on 25 July 1504 but William did not officiate as archdeacon at his uncle's enthronement in 1505 and so was probably not appointed until after the enthronement.\nWilliam Warham was probably educated, like his uncle, at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. He must have trained as a canon lawyer, in view of his duties as archdeacon and the books which survive from his library.\nArchdeacon of Canterbury\nAs archdeacon, he was the archbishop's senior administrator, both in ecclesiastical matters and at the national political level where he took part in diplomatic missions for King Henry VIII, often in association with Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.\nAlthough he was not a priest (acquiring a papal dispensation to allow him to hold his offices), he accumulated many additional benefices and offices, including:\n* 1511: rector of Orpington;\n* 1515&ndash;1516: St Paul's Cathedral: prebendary of Brownswood; from 1516 to his death prebendary of Newingham;\n* 1516&ndash;1557: Exeter Cathedral: canon;\n* 1516: rector of Hayes near Croydon;\n* 1520&ndash;1532: provost of the College of Wingham;\n* 1526&ndash;1527: vicar of Shoreham, Kent;\n* 1527&ndash;1532: rector of Wrotham, Kent;\n* 1532&ndash;1537: rector of Harrow-on-the-Hill, in Middlesex;\n*\nHe is also on record as being the patron of the Poor Priests Hospital, Canterbury, with the church of St Mary (1528), and as patron of Westhithe (1531), and of St Clement's, Sandwich, (1531).\nLater career\nFollowing his uncle's death, he resigned the archdeaconry and some of his Kentish benefices and moved to Middlesex. He appears to have occupied an important residence at St George's Chapel, Windsor.\nFrom about 1537, he had a licence to be non-resident and went abroad, apparently on government intelligence business.\nWilliam Warham died in October 1557, according to the dates of appointment of his successors to the canonries of St Paul's and Exeter.\nReferences"
