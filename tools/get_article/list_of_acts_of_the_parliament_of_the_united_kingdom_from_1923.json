For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n13 & 14 Geo. 5\nThe second session of the 32nd Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 13 February 1923 until 16 November 1923.\nNo private acts were passed during this session.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 13 & 14 Geo. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and section seventeen of the Pharmacy Act, 1868, and to prescribe the method of calculating percentages in liquid preparations for the purpose of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908, and the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920.|note4= }}\n|  and the Poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1921.|note4= }}\n|  and any enactment amending that Act, until the thirty-first day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-three.|note4= }}\n|  applies, and bond investment business.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  to provide for the employment of special constables in connection with Naval, Military and Air Force yards and stations; and to remove certain limitations on the appointment of special constables in Scotland.}}\n|  }}\n|  with respect to the effect of notices to increase rent given thereunder; and for purposes consequential thereon.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n-\n|\n|  and for purposes in connection therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Chamberlain Act|public|24|31-07-1923|repealed=y|An Act to amend the enactments relating to the Housing of the Working Classes (including the amendment and revocation of building byelaws), Town Planning and the Acquisition of Small Dwellings.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and any enactment amending that Act, and to make provision as to the rent and recovery of possession of premises in certain cases after the expiry of that Act, and for purposes in connection therewith.|note4= }}\n|\n|  and for purposes connected therewith.}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Acts amending that Act, and to amend the law with respect to employers' liability insurance, the notification of accidents, first aid, and ambulance.|note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to the William Brown Nimmo Charitable Trust.|po1=William Brown Nimmo Charitable Trust Order 1923|}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  relating to Poole Harbour.|po1=Poole Harbour Order 1923|}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to Bradford Corporation Trolley Vehicles.|note4=|po1=Bradford Corporation (Trolley Vehicles) Order 1922|}}\n|  relating to the Buchanan Trust.|po1=Buchanan Trust Order 1923|Provisional Order to re-incorporate the Governors of the Buchanan Trust; to confer further powers on the Governors of the Trust; to provide for the management of its affairs; and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Fraserburgh Harbour.|note4=|po1=Fraserburgh Harbour Order 1923|Provisional Order for enabling the Provost Magistrates and Councillors of the Burgh of Fraserburgh in the County of Aberdeen to guarantee repayment of money lent to the Fraserburgh Harbour Commissioners by the Treasury; and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to the Royal Glasgow Asylum for the Blind.|po1=South West of Scotland Blind Asylum Order 1923|Provisional Order to vest in the Corporation of the City of Glasgow the Royal Glasgow Asylum for the Blind for the purposes of a joint scheme for the administration of the Blind Persons Act, 1920; and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to the Airdrie, Coatbridge, and District Water Board.|po1=Airdrie, Coatbridge and District Water Board Order 1923|}}\n|  relating to Glasgow Corporation.|po1=Glasgow Corporation Order 1923|}}\n|  relating to Greenock Corporation.|po1=Greenock Corporation Order 1923|}}\n|  relating to North Berwick Burgh Extension.|po1=North Berwick Burgh Extension Order 1923|}}\n|\n| |po1=Scheme for the application or management of the Charity called or known as Henry Lucas's Hospital at Wokingham in the County of Berks founded by Will dated 11th June 1663 and regulated by Letters Patent dated 18th January 18 Car.
