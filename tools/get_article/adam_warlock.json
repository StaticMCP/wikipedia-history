      "text": "# Adam Warlock\n\nAdam Warlock is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #66–67 (cover-dates September 1967 and October 1967) created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, originally named Him. The character would later be significantly developed by Roy Thomas and Jim Starlin. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has starred in the titles Marvel Premiere and Strange Tales as well as five eponymous volumes and several related limited series.\nAdam Warlock is artificially created on Earth by the Enclave to be a perfect being and the next evolution of humanity. Originally known only as \"Him\", he learned of his creators' intentions and rebelled against them to seek a new destiny. Eventually coming across the High Evolutionary, the rechristened Adam Warlock ultimately becomes a hero of the universe, chiefly protecting it from threats such as Thanos, the Universal Church of Truth, and his evil counterpart, the Magus. He is also frequently the bearer of the Soul Stone, one of the fabled Infinity Gems (now called Infinity Stones). The character also serves as the leader of the Infinity Watch and a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, specializing as the latter's cosmic sorcerer and occult expert.\nAdam Warlock has been adapted in various forms of media, including animated television series and video games, and was portrayed by Will Poulter in his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).\nPublication history\n1960s to 1970s\nThe character's origin was shown in Fantastic Four #66 (September 1967) in a story written by Stan Lee and pencilled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby. The character also appeared in Fantastic Four #67 (October 1967) and Thor #163–166 (April–July 1969). Because his role in the Fantastic Four story was minor, sources disagree on which issue is the character's true first appearance. Writer and then editor-in-chief Roy Thomas and penciler Gil Kane significantly revamped Him as Adam Warlock in Marvel Premiere #1 (April 1972).\nIn 2009, Thomas explained he had been a fan of the soundtrack to the musical Jesus Christ Superstar and sought to bring the story to comic books in a superhero context: \"Yes, I had some trepidation about the Christ parallels, but I hoped there would be little outcry if I handled it tastefully, since I was not really making any serious statement on religion... at least not overtly.\"\nChoosing to use a preexisting character while keeping the series locale separate from mainstream Marvel Earth, Thomas created Counter-Earth, a new planet generated from a chunk of Earth and set in orbit on the opposite side of the sun. Thomas and Kane collaborated on the costume, with the red tunic and golden lightning bolt as their homage to Fawcett Comics' 1940s–1950s character Captain Marvel.\nThe story continued in the series The Power of Warlock, which ran eight issues (August 1972October 1973), with some plotlines concluded in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #176–178 (June–August 1974).\nIn a 2009 retrospective survey of the character, writer Karen Walker said the series\n#1 (April 1972). Debut of Him as Adam Warlock. Cover art by Gil Kane and Dan Adkins.]]\nWriter-artist Jim Starlin revived Warlock in Strange Tales #178–181 (February–August 1975). Warlock's adventures became more cosmic in scope as Starlin took the character through an extended storyline referred to as \"The Magus Saga\".\nThe reimagined title continued the numbering of The Power of Warlock and began with Warlock #9 (October 1975) and ran seven issues. The bimonthly series was initially written and drawn by Starlin, but was eventually co-penciled and inked by Steve Leialoha. Some plot threads were concluded in Marvel Team-Up #55 (March 1977), Avengers Annual #7 (November 1977) and Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (December 1977).\nStarlin, in a 2009 interview, recalled,\nArtist Alan Weiss recalled in a 2006 interview there was a \"lost\" Adam Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the Jonathan Swift novel ''Gulliver's Travels. Portions of it were printed in the second volume of Marvel Masterworks: Warlock''. The remainder of the artwork was lost in a New York City taxicab in 1976.\nWarlock's adventures were reprinted, with new Starlin covers, in the six-issue \"Special Edition\" limited series Warlock vol. 2 (December 1982May 1983). This reprint series was itself reprinted, with yet another set of new Starlin covers, as Warlock vol. 3 (May–October 1992).\nAlthough regarded as deceased at the time, Warlock made a brief appearance in Marvel Two-in-One #63 (May 1980).\nModern iterations\nEleven years later, Starlin revived the character and two members of his supporting cast in the miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet #1–6 (July–December 1991). This plot development was a continuation of a larger storyline that began with the resurrection of Thanos in Silver Surfer vol. 3 #34 (February 1990).\nFollowing the events of The Infinity Gauntlet, Warlock and several compatriots starred in the series Warlock and the Infinity Watch. Initially written by Starlin and drawn by Angel Medina, it ran 42 issues (February 1992August 1995). Its plots tied directly into the limited series Infinity War (June–November 1992) and Infinity Crusade (June–December 1993).\nWarlock starred in several limited series, including Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection #1–4 (March–June 1993); The Warlock Chronicles #1–8 (July 1993February 1994); and Warlock vol. 4, #1–4 (November 1998February 1999), by writer-penciler Tom Lyle. The character was featured in the intercompany crossovers between Marvel Comics and the Malibu Comics \"Ultraverse\" in the one-shot Rune / Silver Surfer (April 1995 in indicia, June 1995 on cover); Rune vol. 2, #1–7 (September 1995April 1996), and the two-issue Ultraverse Unlimited (June and September 1996).\nFollowing the unrelated 1999–2000 series Warlock vol. 5, featuring the alien cybernetic character Warlock of the New Mutants team, Adam Warlock co-starred with Thanos in the limited series The Infinity Abyss #1–6 (August–October 2002); Marvel Universe: The End #1–6 (May–August 2003; first four issues biweekly); and Thanos #1–6 (December 2003April 2004). A version of the character starred in the four-issue limited series Warlock vol. 6 (November 2004February 2005), by writer Greg Pak and artist Charlie Adlard. After appearances in Annihilation Conquest: Quasar #1–4 (September–December 2007) and Annihilation: Conquest #1–6 (November 2007April 2008), he was a key character in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #1–25 (July 2008April 2010), The Thanos Imperative #1 (June 2010) and the Ignition one-shot (May 2010).\nThe character appeared in Thanos Annual #1 (July 2014), and in the original graphic novels Thanos: The Infinity Revelation (August 2014) and Thanos: The Infinity Relativity (June 2015), written by Jim Starlin; Warlock appeared in the graphic novel Thanos: The Infinity Finale as well as in the connected mini-series The Infinity Entity (both published in 2016), also written by Starlin.\nTimeline\nTimeline of comics starring Warlock or wrapping up storylines from his ended series.\n_Resurrection\nid:chronicles value:black       legend:Warlock_Chronicles\nLineData=\nlayer:back\nBarData=\nbar:thomas    text:Thomas/Friedrich\nbar:starlin   text:Starlin\nbar:arcudi    text:Arcudi/Ashford\nbar:lyle      text:Lyle\nbar:pak       text:Pak\nPlotData=\nalign:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 width:25 shift:(0,-5)\nwidth:20\ncolor:premiere\nbar:thomas  from:start        till:05/01/1972  text:1–2     shift:(5,-5)\ncolor:warlock\nbar:thomas  from:08/01/1972   till:10/01/1973 text:1–8      shift:(0,-10)\nbar:starlin from:10/01/1975   till:11/01/1976 text:9–15     shift:(0,-10)\nbar:lyle    from:11/01/1998   till:02/01/1999 text:1–4\nbar:pak     from:11/01/2004   till:02/01/2005 text:1–4\ncolor:hulk\nbar:thomas  from:06/01/1974   till:08/01/1974 text:176–178  shift:(0,0)\ncolor:tales\nbar:starlin  from:02/01/1975   till:08/01/1975 text:178–181 shift:(0,0)\ncolor:teamup\nbar:starlin  from:03/01/1977   till:03/01/1977 text:55      shift:(2,-5)\ncolor:avengers\nbar:starlin  from:11/01/1977   till:11/01/1977 text:7       shift:(-3,-10)\ncolor:twoinone\nbar:starlin  from:12/01/1977   till:12/01/1977 text:2       shift:(5,0)\ncolor:watch\nbar:starlin  from:02/01/1991   till:08/01/1994 text:1–31    shift:(-5,0)   textcolor:white width:25\ncolor:watch\nbar:arcudi   from:09/01/1994   till:08/01/1995 text:32–42   shift:(2,-5)    textcolor:white\ncolor:surfer\nbar:starlin  from:03/01/1993   till:06/01/1993 text:1–4     shift:(0,-10)  textcolor:white\ncolor:chronicles\nbar:starlin  from:07/01/1993   till:02/01/1994 text:1–8     shift:(0,0)    textcolor:white\n}}\nFictional character biography\nFirst incarnation: Him, Counter Earth, and first death\nScientists on Earth calling themselves the Enclave created an artificial, perfect human who initially calls himself \"Him\". After rebelling against his creators, and having a conflict with Thor, Him decides to leave Earth and travels into space. He encounters the High Evolutionary who gives him the name \"Warlock\". The High Evolutionary requests Warlock's help in saving the artificially created planet Counter-Earth from the evil Man-Beast and gives Warlock the green Soul Gem (also referred to as the \"Soul Jewel\"), which allows Warlock to capture souls of other beings. When he arrives on Counter-Earth, Warlock is given the name \"Adam\" by four teenagers who befriend him. After the Man-Beast's defeat, Warlock leaves Counter-Earth to find a new purpose.\nIn his travels through space, Warlock encounters the Universal Church of Truth, an intergalactic religious organization led by the corrupt Magus. Warlock allies with Pip the Troll, the assassin Gamora, and Thanos of Titan to oppose the Magus. Eventually, Warlock discovers that the Magus is a future version of himself who traveled back in time after being driven insane by the Soul Gem's use. Warlock chooses to alter his timeline by visiting himself a few months into the future and steals his own soul to prevent the Magus from ever existing. Warlock then continues his journeys, knowing he has seen his own death but not knowing exactly when it will happen.\nWhen the Stranger attempts to steal Warlock's Soul Gem, Warlock learns about five other related gems. Thanos gains possession of these gems with the intention of destroying Earth's sun. When Thanos causes mortal harm to Pip and Gamora, Warlock takes their souls to end their suffering. Warlock then enlists the aid of the Avengers, Captain Marvel and Moondragon to stop Thanos. During the battle, Warlock's younger self appears and takes the older Warlock's soul. Inside the gem, Adam is reunited with Pip, Gamora and others in a utopia known as Soul World. Warlock's soul is temporarily freed from the Soul Gem, allowing him to turn Thanos to stone and save Earth.\nSecond incarnation: Infinity Watch and second death\nThanos (after being resurrected) once again collects the Infinity Gems into the Infinity Gauntlet, capturing the Silver Surfer and Drax the Destroyer in the Soul Gem for opposing him. In Soul Gem's world, the Silver Surfer meets Adam Warlock and convinces him that his help is needed again to defeat Thanos. Warlock agrees and Pip and Gamora decide to accompany him. Warlock transmits himself and his two friends into new bodies and leads a group of Earth's superheroes, defeating Thanos. Warlock obtains the Infinity Gauntlet, being a near-supreme being of the universe. The cosmic Living Tribunal decides that Warlock cannot be trusted to keep the Infinity Gauntlet and instructs him to divide the gems among other beings of Warlock's choosing. Warlock keeps the Soul Gem for himself and gives one gem each to Pip, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Moondragon, and the reformed Thanos. Warlock dubs the group the Infinity Watch.\nDuring Warlock's temporary possession of the Infinity Gauntlet, he purged good and evil from his being, leaving him entirely a creature of logic. His good and evil aspects take on lives as two new physical beings — the evil half is a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half is a woman calling herself the Goddess. When they threaten the universe, Warlock defeats them with the aid of the Watch and other superheroes, absorbing them into the Soul Gem.\nThe Infinity Watch disbands when the Infinity Gems are stolen by Rune, a vampire from a parallel universe. Warlock pursues Rune, recovering the gems and returning to his native universe.\nWarlock plays a role in protecting the universe several more times, including threats from clones of Thanos, the Heart of the Universe, and the interdimensional being Hunger.\nThird Incarnation: Annihilation Conquest, Guardians of Galaxy, Infinity Revelation, etc.\n\"Annihilation: Conquest\"\nIn the 2007-2008 \"Annihilation: Conquest\" storyline, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell later seek Warlock's help to free the alien Kree from the invading Phalanx. Once the Phalanx is defeated, Warlock joins the newly formed Guardians of the Galaxy. While with the Guardians, Warlock attempts to repair damage to the spacetime continuum, which causes him to be the Magus again. Once again leading the Universal Church of Truth, the Magus allies himself with Lord Mar-Vell, but is killed when he fails a mission. The Universal Church of Truth resurrects the Magus as a child, but he is quickly captured and imprisoned by the Annihilators. His cocoon remains under the Annihilators' watch.\nThe Infinity Revelation\nWhile on a new quest, Thanos encounters Warlock's soul in Death's domain. It follows Thanos back to the living world, where it regains human form. Warlock accompanies Thanos on a journey as their universe merges with another one. Due to the convergence, Warlock is retroactively replaced by his counterpart from the other universe.\nExtremely disgruntled by the experience, the new Warlock left Thanos to ponder his situation, and he eventually ended up on \"New Krall\" acting as a gladiator in a fighting pit. Thanos receives a message through time/space from his omnipotent former self to seek this new Adam Warlock who is now unnaturally more powerful than before. Agreeing, Thanos first seeks Pip the Troll to teleport to New Krall and then contacts Gamora to also go to Adam, as they both are his closest friends and can keep him from doing any damage to the universe. During this time Annihilus begins a re-invasion of the Positive Zone searching for an immense power source that turns out to be Adam himself and launches a devastating siege on New Krall. The Shi'ar, led by Gladiator (also looking for the power source), appear and Annihilus, now with the power of the Hulk and a new fear projection ability, defeats them. Pip swiftly teleports Adam, Gamora, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and himself back to the Guardians' ship to safety and are joined by Thanos, where they discover the universe that Adam created was not destroyed, but became a part of him and has given him the power of Eternity and Infinity.\nThanos enhances Pip's abilities to teleport the ship to Annihilus' empire to stop Annihilus once and for all, but are overwhelmed by Annihilus, who teleports Thanos into limbo and takes Adam prisoner (by placing a neural disruptor on him), forcing the Guardians to retreat. Pip stays behind, stating Adam is his only friend and he will not abandon him. The comatose Adam is placed into Annihilus' ship's power source to use him as battery. Pip, after hiding on Annihilus' ship for three months, finds the comatose Adam and launches a rescue mission, killing his guards and striking Adam repeatedly to waken him. Finally awakening, Adam unconsciously destroys the universe and is left floating in a void. Panicking, Adam calls out for Thanos and wills him back into existence. Thanos then proposes to Adam a plan to beseech the One Above All to recreate the universe. The One Above All agrees, on the condition Adam act as the universe's new Living Tribunal. Adam and Thanos restore the universes and immediately kill Annihilus and his fleet, ending his threat once and for all. Finally, on Thanos' request, the \"new\" Living Tribunal resurrects the original Adam Warlock from the point he was killed moments before the convergence took place.\nThe true Adam, alive again, decides to take Thanos' advice to go back to \"the existence that is his\". He immediately goes to Pip the Troll, who runs to his friend with open arms, and they return to their old life of adventure.\nInfinity Quest\nFor reasons unknown, Adam finds himself within the Soul World where he is approached by an aspect of himself that reveals that the Infinity Stones are coming together once more which will ensure a calamity. This encounter is soon revealed to be one of many nightmares that are plaguing Adam so he travels to the Soul World again where he meets an aspect of Gamora's soul that remained trapped there after she left long ago. Despite her pleas for him to release her from it, Adam denied being capable of doing so claiming he does not recognize her altogether and that he no longer possesses the Soul Gem. Escaping the Soul World, Warlock emerged from his cocoon in the world of the living, where he was greeted by Kang the Conqueror.\nInfinity Conflict\nIn Thanos: The Infinity Conflict, when Adam senses that something is not right, he and Pip go to confront Thanos who then kills Adam in the blink of an eye. After reviving in Chandilar, Adam and Pip go to an abandoned ancient planet containing old temples. Here Adam is again killed by a rocket launched by Thanos. After another resurrection he and Pip go to Titan and encounter Eros. However, he is yet again killed by Thanos via another missile. He is then revived in the presence of the Living Tribunal who informs Adam that Thanos has gotten his universe's Astral Regulator and used it to absorb the various Cosmic Beings to become reality. The Living Tribunal tasks Adam to follow the necessary steps to stop Thanos. While travelling to the Astral Plane, Adam encountered his past versions who warns Adam about the result of what he is about to do. He confronts Eros and Pip who were about to kill the infant Thanos and warns them that if Thanos died then Magus would be able to take over reality. They then return to the present where he kills Eros who then returns to life after being rejected by Mistress Death now existing outside the norm, just like Adam and Thanos, which is essential to defeat Thanos.\nIn Thanos: The Infinity Ending, after the future omnipotent Thanos absorbed the Living Tribunal and the Above-All-Others, Adam, Starfox and Pip realizing that they were too late escape, except for Adam who confronts Thanos before being banished by the omnipresent being within himself. Adam went to Kang the Conqueror's ship where he sought to use his time-traveling technology to find a way to defeat Thanos, and realized that Thanos' inexperience is the key to his defeat. After waking Kang from the stasis he was put by Thanos, Adam decides to enter Thanos' psyche. However, before he could proceed he is confronted by his past selves who did not want Adam to sacrifice himself. Being unwilling to let Thanos kill himself and take all existences with him, Adam battles his past selves, eventually using the Soul Stone of one of the Adams to kill them. After that he enters Thanos' psyche where he saw different memories through portals, and eventually came across Hunger and manipulates the being into attacking the past future omnipotent Thanos. Still travelling through different portals, he finally came across the present Thanos who had been trapped within his future omnipotent self and Eros with Pip who try to free Thanos, but were discovered. After that Adam tells Thanos that the only way to defeat his future omnipotent self and get free was trust. Then as the future omnipotent Thanos was about to end everything, Adam had Kang prevent Eros to proceed with his plan allowing Eros to evade capture. This causes present Thanos to take control of his powers and reset everything prior to the machinations of his future self who ceases to exist. Finding himself outside everything Adam was rescued by Kang and informed the Conqueror on what had transpired. Before returning to normality, Adam asked Kang to go on one final time travel to retrieve the green soul stone.\nInfinity Countdown\nDuring the \"Infinity Countdown\" storyline, Adam Warlock realizes that he is at an unspecified time with Kang the Conqueror, who, with some convincing, shows a recap of Warlock's history until finally revealing that the Infinity Stones are once more being gathered and shows a vision of the future – which Kang calls \"Infinity's End\"in which an unseen calamity has befallen the universe after the Infinity Stones were reunited. Kang also reveals to Warlock that they had tried to prevent the current outcome 112 times, but now Kang decides another course of action: he will send Warlock to retrieve the Soul Stone in exchange for Warlock giving him the Time Stone. Warlock reluctantly agrees as he explains that he hopes keeping the two gems apart will prevent disaster. Warlock arrives in ancient Egypt, where he meets the pharaoh Rama Tut, an earlier version of Kang. Rama Tut shows Warlock where he can find the Soul Stone in the future, in the hands of Warlock's \"dark reflection\" the Magus. Rama Tut then seals Warlock in a tomb where he will awaken thousands of years in the future with a chance to claim the Soul Stone. Rama Tut's guards, under his orders, commit suicide by poisoning, as Rama Tut claims that no one can know of the plot. Warlock and Kang the Conqueror ambush the Guardians of the Galaxy during their trip to the planet Oblitus. Gamora attempted to take the Soul Gem from Warlock. When Drax the Destroyer held onto the Soul Gem, he discovered that the Soulworld inside is corrupted. Drax knocked out Gamora and made off with Warlock and Kang the Conqueror. As the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy do not want to help Gamora pursue Warlock and Kang the Conqueror, she went off on her own. Warlock is among the Infinity Gem holders contacted by Doctor Strange, who states that they must reform the Infinity Watch to safeguard the Infinity Gems from such calamities like Thanos.\nInfinity Wars\nDuring the Infinity Wars storyline, Adam Warlock senses the corruption of the Soulworld and enlists Doctor Strange to help deal with the corruption in Soulworld. While dealing with a Souleater, it is revealed that Doctor Strange has the Time Gem. Doctor Strange tries to get Adam to give up the Soul Infinity Gem. Before leaving, Adam warns Doctor Strange that Kang the Conqueror is not the only person looking for the Infinity Gems. Adam Warlock saves a cyclist during a time freeze when he, Drax the Destroyer, and Iron Lad show up. Doctor Strange gathers Star-Lord, Adam, Black Widow's clone, Captain Marvel, and Turk Barrett (who has Bullseye, Sandman, Spot, Tombstone, and Typhoid Mary in his company) in Central Park where Doctor Strange discovers that Thanos is dead. As Gamora in her Requiem alias uses the Reality Gem to partially fuse Captain America and Doctor Strange to get the Mind Gem and the Time Gem, Gamora beheads Adam. As Loki, Emma Frost, Hulk, Ant-Man, Ms. Marvel, and Kang the Conqueror gather together, they find Adam and suggest they exit the Soulworld only for Adam to declare that they need to defeat Devondra first. This causes them to round up Arachknight (a combination of Spider-Man and Moon Knight), Ghost Panther (a combination of Ghost Rider and Black Panther), Green Widow (a combination of Black Widow and She-Hulk), Iron Hammer (a combination of Iron Man and Thor), Man-Thing-Thang-Thoom (a combination of Man-Thing and Fin Fang Foom), Moon Squirrel (a combination of Moon Girl and Squirrel Girl) and Tippysaurus (a combination of Tippy-Toe and Devil Dinosaur), Soldier Supreme (a combination of Captain America and Doctor Strange), Weapon Hex (a combination of Scarlet Witch and X-23), and Fantastic Two members Mister Invisible (a combination of Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman) and Hot Rocks (a combination of Human Torch and Thing) as well as a saxophone-playing version of Drax the Destroyer.\nLoki's group and the warped heroes are fighting Devondra as Adam Warlock and Soldier Supreme arrive with the latter stating that he does not want to be unmade. Adam states that if they can defeat Devondra, Warp World will still exist, though Loki's group will have to use the Infinity Gems to confront Gamora outside. Soldier Supreme notices that Devondra keeps regenerating as Adam finds that Gamora and the alternate Phylla-Vel and Moondragon are now in the Soul Gem. After some talking with Soldier Supreme, Adam plans to copy the souls in Warp World to bring them and Devondra into the real world as Hulk punches Devondra into the hole leading to the real world. Adam returns the Guardians of the Galaxy to their normal state while separating Drax's Destroyer half from his Arthur Douglas half. Once the copies are made with the help of the Infinity Gems, Emma Frost begins to wipe the memories of the incident to avoid unrest as Drax meets the alternate version of his daughter. After Devondra is defeated, Adam grabs the Time Gem, freezes time, and states that the Infinity Gems must decide the outcome. After time resumes, Star-Lord notices that Gamora is gone as Adam sent her to a location so that she can redeem herself. Later on, Adam is staring at the stars in the desert and draws a symbol in the sand claiming that a part of him is missing.\nPowers and abilities\nAdam Warlock is regarded as an artificially created cosmic being whose existence represents a potential pinnacle of human evolution and cosmic origins influenced by greater powers. Within the Marvel Multiverse, he is recognized as belonging to the higher echelons of powerful beings. As a significant cosmic being, the character possesses recuperative powers that manifest through the creation of a cocoon. This cocoon serves to preserve the character, regenerate injuries, and facilitate his resurrection. Furthermore, he possesses immortality, although he can be physically killed, his soul and spirit cannot be permanently extinguished or claimed by the entity known as Death. Warlock is recognized as an astral outsider, rendering his actions, presence, and future impervious to perception by others through magical or cosmic methods.\nIn all his incarnations, Warlock consistently possesses artificial genetic structure that results in bone and muscle tissue denser than that of a typical human, granting him superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. Additionally, his multi-compartmental brain provides him with ultra senses, which grant him heightened levels of both cosmic and mystical awareness. Warlock's body can also tap into cosmic energies to enhance his physical abilities.\nEnergy manipulation\nOne of the prominent abilities possessed by Adam Warlock is the manipulation of various forms of energy. As the character evolves, his energy manipulation powers grow stronger with each resurrection, granting him access to new energies to manipulate over time. In one of his more recent versions, the character's manipulation abilities underwent a substantial increase, granting him the capacity to directly absorb energies from others and manipulate the energies within their bodies, effectively neutralizing their abilities. These formidable powers played a crucial role in his triumph over both Quasar and Silver Surfer on one occasion.\n* Metaphysical quantum energy: In the character's incarnation that followed the Annihilation: Conquest storyline, he is recognized for his manipulation of a unique form of energy, commonly referred to as Quantum Magic and Cosmic Sorcery in other media. Referred to as a \"Quantum Mage,\" this magical practice allows him to manifest magical effects by utilizing the available energies and power in his surroundings, as well as employing \"conjured psi-llables.\" This grants him spell-casting abilities, energy manipulation abilities,  time manipulation powers, and various other capabilities. These abilities were bestowed upon him to address the task of repairing reality in response to the future predicament caused by the expansion of the Fault into the Cancerverse, an event that occurred during his appearance in the Guardians of the Galaxy (2008) series.\n* Cosmic energy: In most incarnations, Warlock can manipulate cosmic energies, utilizing them for a range of purposes including healing, projecting energy blasts, and decreasing gravity to facilitate flight. These abilities are later facilitated by the character's employment of \"quantum magic\".\n* Magical energies: In line with his name, Warlock acquired proficiency in magic, bestowing upon him spiritual powers. He possesses spiritual abilities that are distinct from the Soul Gem, enabling him to revive himself and other beings by transforming deceased bodies. Additionally, the character demonstrates the capability to conduct exorcisms, perceive the aura and soul of individuals, and display a high level of resistance against soul-manipulating powers employed by others. These magical abilities were later replaced by the character's employment of \"quantum magic\", which allowed for the same powers at a wider breadth.\nEquipment\n* Soul Gem: The Soul Gem possesses a consciousness of its own and demonstrates a vampiric hunger for the life energies of organic beings. It contains an idyllic pocket universe that hosts all the souls the Gem has ever taken. Using the Gem, Adam Warlock has demonstrated the power to devolve the followers of Man-Beast into the animals from which they evolved, as well as revert the Brute into Counter-Earth Reed Richards.\nReception\nThroughout the character's publication history, Warlock has garnered a dedicated following and achieved cult favorite status. This recognition can be attributed to his notable presence and the revamp of his character by Jim Starlin in the 1970s, as well as his significant involvement in the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.\nOther versions\nThe Magus\nThe Magus, from Strange Tales #181 (August 1975). Art by Jim Starlin.\nThere have been three incarnations of the Magus (), all of whom are the dark aspect of Adam Warlock.\nThe original Magus is an older, evil Adam Warlock who has traveled to the past and rules a religious empire called the Universal Church of Truth. To ensure his own creation, he guides his younger self through a series of actions that will result in him becoming the Magus. With the aid of Thanos, Warlock alters his future by killing his future self before he can evolve into the Magus, destroying the Magus's timeline and erasing him from existence.\nWhen Warlock acquires the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels good and evil from his soul, unintentionally giving them corporeal forms. The evil half names himself the Magus and attempts to gain the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. He fails when the Infinity Watch trick him into claiming the Gauntlet when the Reality Gem has been replaced by a powerless replica, creating a subtle flaw in the Gauntlet's powers that allows his enemies to overpower him, leaving the Magus to be sealed away in the Soul Gem by Warlock. Since he is only part of a soul, he cannot interact with the other inhabitants of Soul World and exists only as a phantom. The Magus escapes the Soul Gem in an immaterial form, absorbing the life energies of others to regain tangibility. He is defeated by Genis-Vell and reverts to an ethereal entity. The Magus retaliates by wounding Genis' friend Moondragon and claiming she is destined to become his slave.\nWarlock becomes a third version of Magus when he repairs damage to the spacetime continuum. This Magus works for the evil Lord Mar-Vell and is killed when he fails a mission. The Universal Church of Truth resurrects him as a child, who is then imprisoned by the Annihilators.\nThe Magus later seeks to gather the Infinity Stones with the intention of destroying the universe, but is killed during his search. During the \"Infinity Wars\" storyline, Gamora finds a younger version of Magus inside, who tells her he was sent by a \"friend\".\nThe Goddess\nThe Goddess is the embodiment of Adam Warlock's goodness, created when he uses the Infinity Gauntlet to remove the quality from himself. She appears as a central figure in the 1993 limited series Infinity Crusade. She assembles a collection of Cosmic Cubes and forges them into a Cosmic Egg. Using its power, she recreates Counter-Earth, dubbing it Paradise Omega. Embarking on a crusade to eliminate sin, the Goddess uses telepathy to control spiritual beings across the universe, recruiting them to her cause. When Warlock and Earth's other heroes learn of her plan to destroy all sin by destroying anything capable of sin, they rally against her.
