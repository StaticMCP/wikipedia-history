The \"Best Foreign Language Film\" category was not created until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented a non-competitive Honorary Award for the best foreign language films released in the United States with 1950 biopic Genghis Khan was the only film to be submitted.\nAs of 2025, the Philippines has submitted thirty-five films, but none of them were nominated.\nHistory\nThe Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP) appoints a committee to choose one film among those released that year to be submitted as the Philippines's official entry to the Academy for a nomination for \"Best International Feature Film\" the following year. The chosen films, along with their English subtitles, are sent to the Academy, where they are screened for the jury. The 1950 biopic Genghis Khan was the first and only Philippine film submitted for consideration for the Honorary Foreign Language Film award, the precursor to the current category, but no award was given to the film or any non-English language films at this feat.\nFrom 1956 until the establishment of the FAP in 1981, only four films were submitted for consideration: Child of Sorrow (1956), The Moises Padilla Story (1961), Because of a Flower (1967), and Ganito Kami Noon... Paano Kayo Ngayon? (1976). After the FAP was founded, the Philippines submitted Of the Flesh in 1984 and This Is My Country in 1985, but made no further submissions until 1995's Harvest Home. Since then, the FAP has submitted a film in most years. No film was submitted in 2005; Leo Martinez, the director general of the FAP, revealed that the organization had not received an invitation from the Academy. In 2021, the FAP controversially chose not to send an entry as they lacked government funding due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFilmmakers Marilou Diaz-Abaya and Gil Portes have each represented the Philippines three times in this category, the most for any director, and including two consecutive films each: Diaz Abaya in 1997 and 1998, and Portes in 2001 and 2002. Brillante Mendoza, a recipient of the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, directed the 2016 and 2020 submissions. Three films starring John Arcilla have been submitted by the Philippines.}} Joel Torre has co-starred in three films that were entries in 1984, 1985, and 2000. Two of Judy Ann Santos's films, including Ploning (2008), which she produced and starred in, have been submitted. Angel Aquino, Sid Lucero, Phillip Salvador, Vilma Santos, and Jomari Yllana have each represented the Philippines twice as actors in the category.\nCarl Joseph Papa's The Missing and 's And So It Begins marked the first animated and documentary films, respectively, to be submitted as the Philippine entry in two consecutive years.\nSubmissions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders \" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year(Ceremony)\n! scope=\"col\" | Film title used in nomination\n! scope=\"col\" | Original title\n! scope=\"col\" width=16%| Director\n! scope=\"col\" width=12%| Result\n|-\n! 1956(29th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1961(34th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1967(40th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1976(49th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1984(57th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1985(58th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1995(68th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1996(69th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1997(70th)\n| Miracles\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|-\n! 1998(71st)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 1999(72nd)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2000(73rd)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2001(74th)\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|-\n! 2002(75th)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2003(76th)\n| ''The '70s''\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2004(77th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n!2006(79th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2007(80th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2008(81st)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2009(82nd)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2010(83rd)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2011(84th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2012(85th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2013(86th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2014(87th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2015(88th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2016(89th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2017(90th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2018(91st)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2019(92nd)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2020(93rd)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2022(95th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2023(96th)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2024(97th)\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2025(98th)\n|\n|\n| Lav Diaz\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of countries by number of Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film\n* List of Academy Award winners and nominees for Best International Feature Film\n* List of Academy Award–winning foreign-language films\n* Cinema of the Philippines\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://oscars.org/ Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]  official website"
