It was built in 1924 and is a bronze sculpture on a tiered granite base.  The lower part of the sculpture is composed of four life-sized figures of a Native American, a Frenchman, a Scottish soldier, and an American.  They symbolize the four groups whose military exploits are part of Ticonderoga's past. The second part is the artist Charles Keck's (1875–1951) interpretation of Liberty.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nReferences"
