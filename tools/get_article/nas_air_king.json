Only one was built but in 1928 it was revised to carry two passengers and was more successful, with over twenty produced.\nDesign and development\nThe Air King Model 26 was a single bay biplane with wings of rectangular plan, though with rounded, steel tube tips. The rest of the wing structure was a mixture of spruce and ash, with all wing surfaces fabric-covered. Because its upper and lower wings were interchangeable, the span of the upper one was only about 90% that of the lower, the latter mounted on the lower fuselage. They were braced together by inward-leaning, N-form interplane struts with  of stagger and supported over the fuselage on short, outward-leaning cabane struts, an inverted V forwards and a single strut aft on each side. Only the lower wing was set with dihedral (2.5°). Ailerons on upper and lower wings were externally interconnected though, unusually, port and starboard pairs could be separately controlled.\nThe fuselage was a fabric-covered, trussed steel tube structure with the readily available Curtiss OX-5 water-cooled V-8 under a rather pointed cowling in the nose. Its honeycomb radiator was mounted under the upper wing. There were two wide, open cockpits, each with a bench seat for two. The tail surfaces were very angular and constructed from dural, with a tailplane externally braced to the fin and fuselage. Its control surfaces were broad chord; the elevators had a deep cut-out for rudder movement.\nThe Air King's fixed undercarriage was conventional for its time, its wheels on a single axle mounted on short, vertical legs with trailing drag struts attached to the lower fuselage and a rear tailskid.\nThe date of the Air King's first flight in uncertain but it had been completed by January 1927. No more four-seaters were built but in early 1928 the prototype reappeared as the Model 28 with a smaller rear cockpit seating only the pilot. The engine cowling was cleaned up, totally enclosing the OX-5, and the cabane struts revised with a forward single strut and a transverse V aft on each side. It had a wider track, split axle undercarriage with longer main legs from mid-fuselage. The vertical tail was also modified, with the external bracing removed and a rounded fin and rudder. It was  shorter but its other dimensions were unchanged, as, largely, was the performance. Slightly cheaper, this two passenger version proved more popular and twenty-three were completed.\nVariants\n;Model 26: 1926 first prototype, three passengers.\n;Model 28: 1928 two passenger version with cleaned-up engine cowling and new, two axle wider track undercarriage. 23 built.\nSpecifications (Air King Model 26)\n|height m=\n|height ft=8\n|height in=8\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight lb=1095\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n*Useful load:\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Curtiss OX-5\n|eng1 type=water-cooled V-8\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=90\n|eng1 note=\n|power original=\n|more power=\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=Hartzell Propeller\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop dia note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=99\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=85\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=400\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling ft=17000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ftmin=550\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n*Landing speed:\n}}\nReferences\n}}"
