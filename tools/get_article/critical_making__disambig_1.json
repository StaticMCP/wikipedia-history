It was invented to bridge the gap between creative, physical, and conceptual exploration. The term \"critical making\" was popularized by Matt Ratto, an associate professor at the University of Toronto. Ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as a way \"to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique.\"\nHistory of Critical Making\nMatt Ratto and Critical Making at University of Toronto\nMatt Ratto coined the term in 2008 to describe his workshop activities that linked conceptual reflection and technical making. This concept explores how learning is influenced by the learner's participation towards creating and/or making things within a technological context. Ratto's first publication to use the term was in 2009. Ratto believes that critical making enhances the shared experience in both theoretical and practical understandings of critical socio-technical issues. However, critical making should not be reviewed as design, but rather as a type of practice. The quality of a critical making lab is evaluated based on the physical \"making\" process, regardless of the quality of the final material production. The main focus of critical making is an open design, developing a critical perspective on the current institutions, practices, and norms of society.\nThe Critical Making Lab was founded by Matt Ratto in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. The Critical Making Lab has the mission to enhance collaboration, communication, and practice-based engagement in critical making.\nEric Paulos and Critical Making at UC Berkeley\nIn 2012, Eric Paulos launched [http://make.berkeley.edu Critical Making as a studio course at UC Berkeley]. This Critical Making course was designed to operationalize and critique the practice of “making” through both foundational literature and hands-on studio culture. As hybrid practitioners, students develop fluency in readily collaging and incorporating a variety of physical materials and protocols into their practice. With design research as a lens, students envision and create future computational experiences that critically explore social and culturally relevant technological themes such as community, privacy, environment, education, economics, energy, food, biology, democracy, activism, healthcare, social justice, etc. The course has been offered continuously since 2012 and featured publicly at showcases and exhibitions, including Maker Faire as well as other public venues.  Selected projects are archived online on the course [http://make.berkeley.edu/showcase.html website].\nGarnet Hertz and Critical Making at UC Irvine and Emily Carr University\nIn 2012, Garnet Hertz adopted the term for a series of ten handmade booklets titled \"Critical Making,\" published in 2012 when he was working at University of California Irvine. It explores how hands-on productive work can extend critical reflection on technology and society. It works to blend and extend the fields of design, contemporary art, DIY/craft, and technological development. In this project, 70 different authors - including Norman White, Julian Bleecker, Dunne & Raby, Daniel Charny, Albert Borgmann, Golan Levin, Matt Ratto, Natalie Jeremijenko, McKenzie Wark, Paul Dourish, Mitch Altman, Dale Dougherty, Mark Pauline, Scott Snibbe, Reed Ghazala and others - reflected on the term and critical responses to the maker movement. Generally speaking, Hertz's use of the term critical making is focused around studio production and the creation of objects as \"things to think with\".\nHertz's project consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews, and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorized the information into specific topics, thereby producing multiple booklets. The project also stemmed from a specific disappointment of Make partnering with the US military through DARPA funding in 2012. Many opposed this move, including Mitch Altman, and Hertz's project worked to explore the mixture of making, technology, politics and ethics - as well as bringing the fields of critical design and media arts into conversation with maker culture.\nIn 2014, Hertz founded \"The Studio for Critical Making\" at Emily Carr University of Art and Design as Canada Research Chair in Design and Media Arts. The facility \"explores how humanities-based modes of critical inquiry – like the arts and ethics – can be directly applied to building more engaging product concepts and information technologies. The lab works to replace the traditional engineering goals of efficiency, speed, or usability with more complex cultural, social, and human-oriented values. The end result is a technology that is more culturally relevant, socially engaged, and personalized.\"\nJohn Maeda and Critical Making at Rhode Island School of Design\nIn 2012, John Maeda began using the term while at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD): first as a title for their strategic plan for 2012-2017 and next as part of the title of an edited collection titled \"The Art of Critical Making: Rhode Island School of Design on Creative Practice\" published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Other individuals who use the term critical making to orient their work include Amaranth Borsuk (University of Washington-Bothell), Jentery Sayers (University of Victoria), Roger Whitson (Washington State University), Kari Kraus (University of Maryland), Amy Papaelias (SUNY-New Paltz), and Jessica Barness (Kent State University).\nNancy Mauro-Flude and Critical Making at Contemporary Art Tasmania\n'Networked Art Forms and Tactical Magick Faerie Circuits' was a series of events inspired by critical making and computer subculture curated and devised by Nancy Mauro-Flude in collaboration, in lutruwita Tasmania, at Contemporary Art Tasmania (CAT), and on the Internet, from 31 May-30 June 2013. A cohort of artists, programmers and thinkers from the frontline of the critical maker aesthetic, remotely and locally, linking through live streaming of artist talks, workshops, exhibitions, performances, podcasts, and interview broadcasts, Internet relay chat [https://sister0.hotglue.me/radio successively compiled into an online archive].\nA durational event that included symposia, exhibitions, performances, workshops and social gatherings. Collaborating with community Edge Radio, and Island Magazine, NAF:TMFC was also a satellite program of the 19th ISEA International International Symposium on Electronic Art. It brought together Australian and International artists and educators whose work responds to the emergent conditions of a networked world; a realm increasingly transmitted through fiber and code, this included Matthew Fuller, Florian Cramer, Josephine Bosma, Mez Breeze, Julian Oliver, Danja Vasliev, Constant Dullart, Jeff Malpas, Doll Yoko, Linda Dement, and Rosa Menkman. The project which formed the closing exhibition which was programmed as Notorious R + D as a part of the inaugural Dark Mofo festival. The event received [https://www.realtime.org.au/cracking-the-technology-case/ critical acclaim] such as: \"Perhaps it is appropriate that I review NAF:TMFC because it sits just outside my comfort zone....the heart, the ritual, the idea of frailty, are returned to technology, seem to capture the spirit of the endeavour. They hold something I can grasp or identify with. And with time, exploring the exhibition in a near empty gallery, I see that the collected works cultivate potential for play and discovery—qualities that chip away at the white noise and allow for a singular experience.\"\nParticipants were encouraged to adopt a feminist and holistic approach to digital literacy, using various aesthetic tools and means to explore systems through critical making and [https://runway.org.au/interrupts-arent-hidden-experiential-prototyping-miss-despoina/ experiential prototyping] that enable insightful experiences in an increasingly data driven existence.\nConcepts Related to Critical Making\nSpeculative Design and Critical Making\nAccording to DiSalvo and Lukens, \"Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and expression, over usability, usefulness or desirability. A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future-oriented. However, this should not be mistaken as being fantasy-like sense, suggesting that it is \"unreal\" and therefore dismissible (DiSalvo and Lukens, 2009).\"\nThe term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines, including visionary or futurist forms of architecture, design fiction, and critical design or design for debate instead of referring to a specific movement or style. More than just diagrams of unbuilt structures, the speculative design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture, technology, and the built environment (Lukens and DiSalvo, 2012, p.&nbsp;25). Practitioners of speculative design engage in design as a sort of provocation, one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long-term implications of technology. These practices also integrate pairs of concerns that are traditionally separate, such as fact and fiction, science and art, and commerce and academia. This provocation extends to questions about design itself.\nSee also\n*Adversarial design\n*Critical technical practice\n*Critical thinking\n*Critical design\n*Speculative design\n*Maker culture\n*Technology\n*Arduino\n*3D Printing\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.arduino.cc/ Arduino]\n* [https://opendesignnow.org/index.php/article/critical-making-matt-ratto/ Open Design Now]\n* [http://flashgamer.com/arduino/comments/raspberry-pi-or-arduino Raspberry Pi or Arduino]\n* [http://make.berkeley.edu Critical Making - Paulos Syllabus (Berkeley)]\n* [https://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/ Critical Making - Hertz (2012)]\n* [http://research.ecuad.ca/criticalmaking/ The Studio for Critical Making (Emily Carr University of Art and Design)]\n*\n* [https://runway.org.au/interrupts-arent-hidden-experiential-prototyping-miss-despoina/ Nancy Mauro-Flude: Interrupts aren’t hidden Experiential Prototyping ]"
