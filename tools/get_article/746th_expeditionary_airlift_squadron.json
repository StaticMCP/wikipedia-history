It is assigned to Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed.  Most recently, it operated Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in theater airlift missions as part of the Global War on Terrorism.\nThe squadron was first activated as the 746th Bombardment Squadron in June 1943.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, where it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany.   It earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its combat operations.  Following V-E Day, the squadron returned to the United States and began reorganizing as a very heavy bomber unit, but after the Japanese surrender, was inactivated in October 1945.\nThe squadron was reactivated in the reserve in 1947, but does not appear to have been fully equipped or manned.  It was activated again in 1952 as the 746th Troop Carrier Squadron, when the 456th Troop Carrier Group replaced the 435th Troop Carrier Group, a reserve group that had been mobilized for the Korean War.  It operated from Japan with elements of United States Air Force Security Service, performing special reconnaissance missions, until returning to the United States for inactivation in 1958.\nIt was converted to provisional status as the 746th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron in 2002.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nThe squadron was first activated on 1 June 1943 as the 746th Bombardment Squadron at Wendover Field, Utah, where it was one of the four original squadrons of the 456th Bombardment Group and received its initial cadre.  Shortly thereafter the squadron moved to Gowen Field, Idaho and began to train with Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers.  It completed its training in December 1943 after which it began moving to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.\nThe squadron arrived in theater at Cerignola Airfield on 11 January 1944 and later that month moved to its combat station of Stornara Airfield, Italy.  The squadron commenced combat operations the following month, primarily engaging in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany.  Its early operations were conducted against airfields, aircraft factories, and railroad bridges in Italy, Austria and Romania. On 10 May 1944, the squadron targeted a manufacturing center at Wiener Neustadt, Austria, but adverse weather caused most of the attacking force to turn back before reaching the target.  The 746th and the rest of the 456th Group proceeded to attack the target despite heavy interceptor opposition that was able to concentrate on defending against the group's Liberators.  Its actions in this operation earned the squadron its first Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC).\nLater, the squadron expanded its operations to include attacks on locomotive manufacturing plants, oil refineries, oil storage facilities and viaducts in France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and on the Balkan peninsula.  On 2 July 1944, the squadron experienced severe fighter attacks while bombing oil facilities at Budapest, Hungary, for which it was awarded a second DUC.\nDuring this time, the squadron was occasionally diverted from its strategic mission to carry out air support and air interdiction missions.  From July through August 1944, it helped set the conditions for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France.  In the spring of 1945, it supported Operation Grapeshot, the offensive by the United States Fifth Army and British Eighth Army against remaining German forces in northern Italy.\nFollowing V-E Day, the squadron airlifted supplies to airfields in northern Italy.  It returned to the United States in July and began to reorganize as a very heavy bomber unit in preparation for operations in the Pacific. However, with the surrender of Japan, the squadron was inactivated on 17 October 1945.\nAir Force reserve\nThe squadron was reactivated as a reserve unit in July 1947, under Air Defense Command (ADC) at McChord Field, Washington, where its training was supervised by ADC's 406th AAF Base Unit (later the 2345th Air Force Reserve Training Center).  It was nominally a very heavy bomber unit, but according to air force historian Maurer Maurer, the squadron does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped with operational aircraft while a reserve unit.  In 1948 Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC.  President Truman’s reduced 1949 defense budget required reductions in the number of units in the Air Force.  ConAC also reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system in June 1949.  As a result, the squadron was inactivated and its personnel and equipment were transferred to elements of the 302d Troop Carrier Wing, which was activated simultaneously.\nTroop carrier operations\nIn 1952, the squadron was redesignated the 746th Troop Carrier Squadron and activated at Miami International Airport, Florida, where it replaced the 78th Troop Carrier Squadron, a reserve unit that had been mobilized for the Korean War and which was returning to reserve status.  The squadron and its Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars moved to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina in August 1953.  It participated in numerous military exercises in the United States and overseas, primarily with airborne forces of the United States Army.\nIn March 1955, the 456th Troop Carrier Wing reorganized, and the squadron was assigned directly to wing headquarters as the 456th Group. All wing support organizations were inactivated at this time, while the squadron formed a detachment with eight C-119L aircraft.  In October, the squadron moved with the wing to Shiroi Air Base, Japan, but the flying detachments of the wing were located at various points between Okinawa and Alaska.  The squadron took part in Project Drag Net, recovering instrument packages from high altitude research or reconnaissance balloons.  The project was terminated in May 1956 due to its low success rate, although the squadron earned an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its participation.  The squadron returned to the United States and Ardmore Air Force Base, Oklahoma, where it was inactivated in July 1956 and its assets transferred to the 341st Troop Carrier Squadron.\nAir expeditionary unit\nThe squadron was converted to provisional status as the 746th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron in 2002.  It was activated in 2004 as a Lockheed C-130 Hercules airlift squadron as part of the Global War on Terrorism.  It is a \"rainbow\" unit, composed of crews and planes from active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard units.  The squadron, as recently as 2017 was responsible for transporting personnel and materiel to support Operation Inherent Resolve.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 746th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 14 May 1943\n: Activated on 1 June 1943\n: Redesignated 746th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy c. 5 March 1944\n: Redesignated 746th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy on 5 August 1945\n: Inactivated on 17 October 1945\n* Activated in the reserve on 12 July 1947\n: Inactivated on 27 June 1949\n* Redesignated 746th Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium on 15 October 1952\n: Activated on 1 December 1952\n: Inactivated on 9 July 1956\n* Redesignated 746th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron converted to a provisional unit on 12 June 2002\n: Activated 2004\nAssignments\n* 456th Bombardment Group, 1 June 1943 – 17 October 1945\n* 456th Bombardment Group, 12 July 1947 – 27 June 1949\n* 456th Troop Carrier Group, 1 December 1952\n* 456th Troop Carrier Wing, 1 March 1955 – 9 July 1956\n* Air Mobility Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 12 June 2002\n* Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 19 March 2003\n:: 379th Expeditionary Operations Group, c. 2004 – present\nStations\n* Wendover Field, Utah, 1 June 1943\n* Gowen Field, Idaho, 14 July 1943\n* Bruning Army Air Field, Nebraska, 2 August 1943\n* Kearns Army Air Base, Utah, 9 September 1943\n* Muroc Army Air Field, California, 2 October–4 December 1943\n* Cerignola Airfield, Italy, 11 January 1944\n* Stornara Airfield, Italy, 25 January 1944 – 19 July 1945\n* Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, 1 August 1945\n* Smoky Hill Army Air Field, Kansas, 17 August-17 October 1945\n* McChord Field (later McChord Air Force Base), Washington, 12 July 1947 – 27 June 1949\n* Miami International Airport, Florida, 1 December 1952\n* Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, 15 August 1953\n* Shiroi Air Base, Japan, 10 November 1955\n* Ardmore Air Force Base, Oklahoma, 17 May–9 July 1956\n* Al Udeid Air Base, c. 2004 – present\nAircraft\n* Consolidated B-24 Liberator, 1943–1945\n* Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 1945\n* Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, 1952–1956\n* Lockheed C-130 Hercules, 2004 – present\n|award_image4=AF MUA\n|award_name4=Air Force Meritorious Unit Award\n|award_date4=1 June 2010 – 31 May 2011\n|award_notes4=746th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron\n|award_image5=AF MUA\n|award_name5=Air Force Meritorious Unit Award\n|award_date5=1 June 2011 – 31 May 2012\n|award_notes5=746th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron\n|award_image6=AF MUA\n|award_name6=Air Force Meritorious Unit Award\n|award_date6=1 June 2015 – 31 May 2016\n|award_notes6=746th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron\n|award_image7=AF OUA w/ v\n|award_name7=Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \"V\" Device\n|award_date7=6 May 2003 – 31 August 2003\n|award_notes7=746th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron\n|award_image8=AF OUA\n|award_name8=Air Force Outstanding Unit Award\n|award_date8=1 April 1955 – 20 March 1956\n|award_notes8=746th Troop Carrier Squadron\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
