      "text": "# Draft:Ying Yu (Han dynasty)\n\nYing Yu (d. 218) courtesy name Zizheng was an official during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.\nLife and career\nYing Yu was born in Nanyang Commandery, Jing Province. He was said to have a straight stature, great strength, and an innate sense of benevolence and righteousness.\nIn 218, Ying Yu was serving under Grand Administrator of Nanyang Dongli Gun (東里袞) as an Officer of Merit of the commandery at Wan. The people of Wan suffered due to forced labour, and so in the winter, officers Hou Yin (侯音) and Wei Kai (衛開) were joined by mountain bandits and incited a revolt at Wan. They quickly took over the city and captured Dongli Gun, then attempted to call upon Liu Bei's general Guan Yu in the south for support. Ying Yu was able to rescue Dongli Gun and alone the two were able to slip out of the castle. Upon realizing Dongli Gun's escape, Hou Yin sent out riders that were able to catch up to Dongli Gun and Ying Yu about ten li away from Wan. The riders attempted to shoot Dongli Gun with arrows, but Ying Yu used his body as a shield and he was injured in seven different places. As the rebels proceeded to capture Dongli Gun, Ying Yu persuaded them to not harm Dongli Gun and the rebels indeed followed Ying Yu's words by not binding Dongli Gun. Ying Yu subsequently died from his wounds.\nDongli Gun was again set free with the help of Ying Yu's successor Zong Ziqing (宗子卿), and joined forces with Cao Ren, who was stationed with an army at Fan Castle to defend against incursions by Guan Yu. Cao Ren brought his army upon Wan and after three more months, Hou Yin and Wei Kai were defeated and executed. Cao Ren submitted a memorial to the government detailing Ying Yu's deeds and also conducted sacrificial rites to his ancestors. Hearing of Ying Yu's actions, Cao Cao greatly lamented Ying Yu's death, and later he built a gate at the entrance of Ying Yu's home village in his honour. He further bestowed one thousand bushels of grain to the village.\nIn 258, in an imperial edict, Wei Emperor Cao Mao instructed Minister over the Masses Zheng Chong (鄭沖) to appoint Ying Yu's grandson, Ying Lun (應倫), to a government position to repay Ying Yu's service.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Chen, Shou (3rd century).
