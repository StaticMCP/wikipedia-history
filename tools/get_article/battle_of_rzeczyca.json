Mirski used deception, bribing a local peasant who convinced the Cossacks that only scattered Lithuanian troops were nearby.\nWhen the Cossacks entered a village near Rzeczyca, Lithuanian dragoons, infantry, and reiters attacked them from hiding, completely destroying Głowacki's unit. Głowacki himself was captured and executed, although there are uncertain reports regarding his execution, as a Cossack regiment under his command was later seen marching with Chmielnicki's army towards Zbaraż. The victory was credited to the Lithuanian Field Hetman Janusz Radziwiłł, Radziwiłł was praised in the anonymous Song of Battle.\nReferences"
