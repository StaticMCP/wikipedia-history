It contains 12 historic buildings and 3 structures. The packing house is in a state of abandoned decay and has not been in operation since 1983.\nDescription\nThe 20-acre site  is situated off of U.S. Route 17 between Lake Winona Road and Ridgewood Avenue. It is bordered by the CSX railroad line on the southwest. It consists of a packing house with a distinctive saw tooth roof. Behind this building stands a barn, blacksmith shop, machinery house, a steam and dynamo building and 10 other structures.\nHistory\nTheodore Strawn, a native of Illinois, settled in West Volusia County and started an orange packing operation in 1882. In 1921, the original packing house burned and a metal structure with an iconic sawtooth roof was constructed to replace it. The walls were built from stamped copper alloy steel panels, and designed to be fireproof.\nThe packing house was closed down after a destructive freeze on Christmas 1983. That year, the orange trees were killed down to the stump, according to John Strawn, the grandson of Theodore Strawn, the site's founder.\nThe site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993, along with a sawmill and some additional Strawn agricultural buildings about a mile away.\nThe site has been heavily vandalized and looted over the years since it closed, in spite of no trespassing signs and a fence around the facility. In 2008 a fire destroyed the machine shop. In 2010, a fire destroyed a 40-foot by 50-foot outbuilding and damaged two others.\nThe site, even in its dilapidated condition, is of significant historical importance, as it depicts the early development of the citrus industry in Florida. It has been on The Florida Trust for Historic Preservation's list of Florida's Eleven Most Endangered Historic Sites since 2007.  It is listed as endangered by the Volusia County Historic Preservation Board.\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Volusia/districts.html Volusia County listings]\n* [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com National Register of Historic Places]\n* [http://www.stateofflorida.com/Portal/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=110 State of Florida Historic Places]"
