He served as an imam at several mosques in Australia before he came out as gay.\nSince 2014, he has run the underground LGBT support group Marhaba ('welcome' in Arabic) and says he was ostracised by the Muslim community because of his sexual orientation, and intended to open Australia's first mosque which was open to the LGBT community. That year, he spoke at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.\nSee also\n* Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed\n* Muhsin Hendricks\n* Mullah Taha\n* Daayiee Abdullah\nReferences"
