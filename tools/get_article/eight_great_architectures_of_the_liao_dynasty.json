Buddhism during the Liao dynasty was influenced by the Tang dynasty, as Buddhist relics were relocated to the Hebei vassal state for safekeeping following Emperor Wuzong of Tang's suppression of Buddhism. This relocation facilitated the growth of Buddhism in the Khitan ethnic settlements. While many buildings from the Liao dynasty were destroyed in conflicts, a select few Buddhist structures have been preserved, with the \"Eight Great Architectures of the Liao Dynasty\" serving as notable examples. Despite their initial construction during the Liao dynasty, these buildings have undergone various degrees of restoration or reconstruction in subsequent eras. They are all designated as the most significant immovable cultural relics in China and are classified as major cultural heritage sites under national-level protection.\nTable\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px\" scope=\"col\" | Picture\n! scope=\"col\" | Place\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Introduction\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Wenshu Hall of Geyuan Temple\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" | Laiyuan County, Hebei Province\n| The Wenshu Hall of Geyuan Temple, originally constructed in 966, has undergone multiple reconstructions over the years.
