The Warriors play their home games at the Haverhill Valley Forum in Haverhill, Massachusetts.\nHistory\nThe Valley Jr. Warriors were originally founded as a member of the Eastern Junior Hockey League (EJHL) in 1996. The team saw a modest amount of success in the league, making several postseason appearances over the years. In 2013, several league members announced that they were leaving to form a separate junior league. The remaining teams, which included Valley, dissolved the EJHL and formed a new circuit called the Eastern Hockey League (EHL). After a few years, the league augmented its structure by adding a lower level for under-19 players that would serve as a feeder system for the primary clubs that operated at full junior level (under-20). Valley's second team was founded in 2015 in what was then called the elite division while the main club operated in the Premier league. After a bit of rearranging, the top level reverted to being called 'Eastern Hockey League' (EHL) while the second tier became 'Eastern Hockey League Premier' (EHLP). Both teams continue to operate in their respective levels as of 2025.\nSeason-by-season records\nPrimary\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Season !! GP !! W !! L !! T !!
