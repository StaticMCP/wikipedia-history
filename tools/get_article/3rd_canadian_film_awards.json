The ceremony was hosted by Mary Pickford.\nThis year, the selection process was changed; specialized judging panels assessed theatrical, non-theatrical and amateur entries, and judges were given more detailed instructions. Due to budget constraints, the physical prizes were printed certificates.\nAt the dinner before the awards presentation, Fred Dillon of the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association presented Dominion archivist Dr. William Kaye Lamb with a letter from Thomas Edison. In the letter, dated May 1, 1894, Edison thanked Ottawa businessmen George Holland and Andrew Holland for successfully using his Kinetoscope (the precursor of the projector) to exhibit a film. Pickford, a director of the Edison Pioneers, received a copy of the letter for presentation to the Edison Museum in New Jersey.\nWinners\n*Film of the Year: Not awarded\n*Theatrical Short: Après le bagne (After Prison, What?) — National Film Board of Canada, Gil LaRoche producer, Ron Weyman director\n*Non-Theatrical, Open: Feelings of Depression — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, Stanley Jackson director\n::Honourable Mention: The Oyster-Man — National Film Board of Canada, Michael Spencer producer, Julian Biggs and Jean Palardy directors\n*Amateur: Not awarded\n::Honourable Mention: Parking on This Side — University of Toronto Film Society, Michel Sanouillet director\n::Honourable mention: Frontiersman — Crawley Films, Emmanuel J.
