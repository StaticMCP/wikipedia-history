Local Patriots banded together to defend the area against a raid by Loyalist and indigenous forces. The engagement ended in defeat for the Patriots, and considerable brutality followed the battle. It was not until October 1778 that the commanding officer of Fort Wyoming (Wilkes-Barre) felt the area safe enough to return and begin recovery of the bodies.\nMemorial\nThe remains were gathered and interred in a common grave, only to be exhumed at public ceremonies in 1832 — ceremonies attended by some of the then elderly survivors of the battle. In 1833, the bones were re-interred in a vault under the present monument.\nEach year, beginning in 1878 for the 100th anniversary of the battle, a commemorative ceremony is held on the grounds of the monument. The ceremony is sponsored by the Wyoming Commemorative Association. Ownership of the monument is held by the Wyoming Monument Association, originally formed as the Ladies Monumental Association.\nOn August 2, 2008, the monument was struck by lightning, causing some damage and putting the monument in need of repairs. In 2010, the restoration began and the monument, completely repaired and restored, was rededicated at the annual celebration of the Wyoming Commemorative Association in 2011.\nGallery\nWyoming Monument.jpg|Photo of the Monument circa 1910\nWyoming Monument 2.jpg|Sketch of the Wyoming Monument circa 1860\nWyoming Battle Monument.jpg|The monument at night\nWyoming Monument Cannons mouth LuzCo PA.JPG|Mouth of one of the cannons at the monument\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Carterat Former President Jimmy Carter speaks at Wyoming Monument on May 28, 2013 (archived on C-SPAN)]"
