Gabriel, fearing that Alpha will retaliate, insists that the prisoner receive medical treatment. On the roof, Lydia says that the prisoner has been trained to avoid harsh interrogation, and instead suggests to Carol to show him the value of life within Alexandria to turn him. Carol offers the man sandwiches but he spits them back at her. Carol and Daryl revert to a more harsh interrogation, but Carol pauses after hearing him praise Alpha for sacrificing Lydia. Carol realizes that the Whisperers, outside of Alpha, do not know about Lydia's safety, and considers using her as a pawn to reveal Alpha's lies to the Whisperer. Carol goes to get Lydia to see the prisoner but discovers that he died shortly before their arrival. Dante discovers that the medical kit being used to treat the prisoner's wounds contained hemlock, which was mistakenly given to him; Siddiq blames himself, as he realizes that he accidentally added the hemlock to the bag due to his fatigue.\nMeanwhile, Aaron continues to meet with Gamma at their boundary, hoping to bond with her. Gamma tells him she is an only child. She later goes back to the Whisperers camp, where Alpha questions her, and then ritualistically whips her arm. Alpha then says she believes in Gamma, and tells her that Aaron is tempting her with lies.\nAfter seeing Dante burying one of the older infected women that he had grown close to, Siddiq attempts to commit suicide by drowning himself, but is rescued by Rosita. As they talk, Siddiq has a realization and rushes to test the water supply, discovering it to be contaminated; he blames himself for failing to notice.\nDespite Daryl's strong opposition, Carol takes Lydia to see the Whisperers, and that night comes across one of Aaron and Gamma's meetings, where Gamma has taken Aaron at knifepoint to demand more intel. Carol and Lydia rush forward. Upon seeing Lydia, Gamma panics and runs away; when Lydia discovers that Carol simply used her as a pawn, she flees as well. Carol and Aaron are forced to retreat as walkers approach.\nAfter decontaminating the water supply, Dante tries to cheer up a depressed Siddiq, reassuring him that what happened wasn't his fault. While doing so, Dante then makes a strange verbal tic which causes Siddiq to have another lucid dream, in which he remembers one of the Whisperers' making the same tic during the decapitation of several fair attendees. He realizes that Dante is a Whisperer agent who helped Alpha sneak into the Kingdom's fair and capture the victims. He moves to attack Dante, but Dante gets the upper hand and is able to subdue and choke him to death.\nProduction\n, directed his third episode for the series.]]\nThis episode marks the death of Siddiq played by Avi Nash.
