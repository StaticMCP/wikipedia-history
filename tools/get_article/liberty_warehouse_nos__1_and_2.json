It was built in two sections in 1938 and in 1948.  Together it was an expansive frame structure on a brick foundation with low-pitched, front-gabled roofs supported by massive timber columns.  The last loose-leaf tobacco auctions were held in downtown Durham in the 1980s.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. In May 2011 a portion of the roof collapsed and demolition of the building began in July 2014.\nReferences"
