PlaToLoCo integrates and collects the output of five different state-of-the-art tools for discovering LCRs and provides functional annotations such as domain detection, transmembrane segment prediction, and calculation of amino acid frequencies. Furthermore, the union or intersection of the results of the search on a query sequence can be obtained.\nA Neural Network webserver, named LCR-hound has been developed to predict the function of prokaryotic and eukaryotic LCRs, based on their amino acid or di-amino acid (bigram) content.\nReferences"
