It was made possible politically by the French loss of Artois and Flanders. Administratively, a chancellery and tribunal was established at Mechelen which for the first time had as its jurisdiction \"the Netherlands\" exclusively.\nThe treaty resulted in a significant shift of territories from the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle to the Burgundian Circle. The newly formed administrative division of the empire now united all Burgundian territories, which were no longer subject to the Reichskammergericht.\nTo compensate for its territorial gain, the Burgundian Circle was now obliged to pay taxes equivalent to those of two prince-electorates, and in war taxes towards the Turkish Wars even equivalent to three prince-electorates.\nTo ensure that the Burgundian territory now united in the Burgundian Circle would remain under a single administration, Charles V in the following year promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 which declared the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands a single indivisible possession not to be divided in future inheritance.|group=\"note\"}}\n|}\nMap gallery\n| image2            = Map of the Imperial Circles (1560)-en.svg\n| width2            = 300\n| caption2          = Imperial Circles in 1560.\n| image3            = Charles I and V empire.png\n| width3            = 328\n| caption3          = Possessions of emperor Charles V  1550.\n| image4            = Spanish Netherlands.svg\n| width4            = 244\n| caption4          = The Low Countries in 1560.\n| image5            = Habsburgse Nederlanden 1555.svg\n| width5            = 224\n| caption5          = The Low Countries in 1555.\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nPrimary sources\n*  (Latin and German)\n*\nScholarly literature\n*\n*\n*"
