Theatre Ventures is the live show, stageplay and musical production arm of Warner Bros. Discovery. The company forms a part of Warner Bros., one of the major business segments of Warner Bros. Discovery. Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures is led by Mark Kaufman.\nFounded in 2003, to develop and produce plays and musicals based on the Warner Bros. library. The first production by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures was a musical adaptation of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles entitled Lestat which entered development in 2003 and opened in 2006.\nHistory\nWarner Bros. Theatre Ventures was formed in May 2003 by Gregg Maday, to focus on making stage adaptations of the Warner Bros. film library. Warner Bros. had considered creating a division to produce live stage shows after witnessing Disney's success with bringing Beauty and the Beast to Broadway. Maday brought in Broadway producer Emanuel Azenberg as a consultant, and the first production they started working on was one about Batman. The music was written by Jim Steinman, with a book by David Ives, originally Tim Burton expressed interest in directing the Broadway show. But after Dance of the Vampires by Steinman and Ives flopped on Broadway, Warner Bros. pulled the plug on the Batman musical.\nWarner Bros. received an offer from Linda Woolverton and Robert Jess Roth, the writer and director of the Beauty and the Beast musical. The two of them wanted to work with songwriters Elton John and Bernie Taupin on a new musical based on Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles. \"When you are starting something, and you get offered the two people who had worked on Beauty and the Beast, Elton John and Bernie Taupin on their first Broadway partnership, and Anne Rice, who has extraordinary success as a novelist, as package, it was really difficult to say 'no' to that, even if I wanted to,\" Maday explained.\nProduction on Lestat started in November of 2003. Lestat premiered at the Curran Theatre, San Francisco, California on December 17, 2005 and closed on January 29, 2006. The musical opened on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on March 25, 2006 and closed on May 28, 2006, after 33 previews and 39 performances.\nThe next venture into Broadway was not until 2009, with Elf.
