His father, Hukmaram Harshwal, a fighter with Mahatma Ghandi in the war for independence, had died when Harshwal was one and a half years old, leaving the family dependent on relatives for existence.  These were the years when famine was sweeping the country.\nDespite his family's poverty, Harshwal excelled in school and was admitted to the University of Rajisthan in Bombay.  When he graduated from college, he went back to Dankoli and, without any means of supporting himself, immediately started visiting prominent people in the village, asking if he could take care of their accounting for them.  In less than a year, he had created a successful practice that started his first accounting business.\nAfter developing his thriving Indian business, he decided to take a holiday in the United States.  Exploring the business climate in the U.S. during his visit, he decided that more opportunity existed in a country without all the regulatory burdens placed on businesses in India.  He returned home and closed his accounting practice there and became an immigrant to the United States.\nHis experience as an immigrant was not an easy one, however.  He had trouble finding a job as an auditor even though he quickly passed his CPA exams and had significant Indian business experience.  He finally landed a position with a small American Indian owned firm that served tribes and tribal organizations.\nAfter several years working for that firm, he received a contract from Navajo Technical College in New Mexico and launched [https://www.harshwal.com Harshwal LLC].  He also became a U.S. citizenship during the same period.\nHarshwal LLC started out as a small CPA firm that primarily served the American Indian market for accounting services in the southwest with its headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Just a few years after its founding, however, it began to expand into the California market for non-profit and governmental accounting services and started to grow.  A Native American partner was identified and the American Indian business was spun off into [https://www.bluearrowcpa.com Blue Arrow LLC] with Sanwar Harswal taking a minority ownership position.  Harshwal LLC then relocated its headquarters to San Diego, California, continuing its Albuquerque office, and started expanding its business throughout the United States, specializing in non-profit clients and government agencies.\nThen, in 2021 during a trip back to India, Harshwal met with old friends, former clients of his Indian accounting firm, and government officials.  He had already started hiring Indian accountants and training them on U.S. accounting practices and laws in order to decrease the costs of operating in the U.S.  While in India, he decided to start [https://www.harshwalconsulting.com/ Harshwal Advisory LLC] that would expand his outsourcing operations.\nDuring the same period, he started to expand the effort to create Artificial Intelligence, robotic, and advanced analytics software for auditors and accountants that, he believed, would have an international market.  Using both the outsourcing and advanced technology development as a rationale, he and his sons, who had become partners in the various enterprises now operated by Harshwal, began building a major office complex in Jaipur, India.\nToday the Harshwal group of companies has become a leading CPA outsourcing firm primarily serving other CPA firms in the United States and AI developer that has clients in both the U.S. and India.\nReferences"
