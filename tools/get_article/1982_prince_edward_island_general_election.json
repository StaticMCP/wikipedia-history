In the same year, the Liberals selected future premier Joe Ghiz as their leader. Lee called an early election (traditionally elections in PEI are held every four years) in which a few seats changed hands, but the overall count stayed the same as in 1979.\nThis election also marked the lowest point in popular support for the New Democrats on PEI, who were led by an interim leader.\nParty standings\n{| style=\"width:55%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#9999FF; width:65.63%;\" | 21\n| style=\"background:#EA6D6A; width:34.37%;\" | 11\n|-\n| PC\n| Liberal\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1979\n!Elected\n!Change\n!#\n!%\n!Change\n|\n|James Lee\n! align=right|21\n! align=right|21\n| align=right|-\n! align=right|71,274\n! align=right|53.7%\n| align=right|+0.4%\n|Liberal\n|Joe Ghiz\n| align=right|11\n| align=right|11\n| align=right|-\n| align=right|60,771\n| align=right|45.8%\n| align=right|+0.5%\n|\n|David Burke (interim)\n| align=right|0\n| align=right|0\n| align=right|-\n| align=right|629\n| align=right|0.5%\n| align=right|-0.8%\n|-\n|}\n|53.72}}\n|45.80}}\n|0.47}}}}|65.63}}\n|34.37}}}}\nMembers elected\nThe Legislature of Prince Edward Island had two levels of membership from 1893 to 1996 - Assemblymen and Councillors. This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district. Before 1963, Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district, but afterward they were elected in the same manner as Assemblymen.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
