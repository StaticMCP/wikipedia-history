Originally published by Puffin Books in 1984, the title is the seventh gamebook in the Fighting Fantasy series. It was later republished by Wizard Books in 2002. A digital version developed by Tin Man Games was released for Android and iOS.\nRules\nStory\nThe player takes the role of an adventurer tasked with stopping the Lizard King and freeing the human slaves captured by his army. Gameplay takes the form of a campaign: battling Lizard Men and various other monsters across the island whilst collecting information as to the Lizard King's weakness, which will be required during the final confrontation.\nReception\nMarcus L. Rowland reviewed Island of the Lizard King for the May 1984 issue of White Dwarf, rating the title 8 out of a possible 10. Rowland claimed that Island of the Lizard King \"seemed to contain more monsters and less traps than others in the series, and most of the traps seemed to be fair\", concluding that this was \"probably the toughest adventure of this series, since few options allow the adventurer to avoid a fight\".\nReviews\n*School Library Journal (April 1985)\nIn other media\nA digital version developed by Tin Man Games is available for Android and iOS.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.fightingfantasygamebooks.com/ Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks] - the official website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100610065902/http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/wizard/ Wizard Books] - the Publisher's site"
