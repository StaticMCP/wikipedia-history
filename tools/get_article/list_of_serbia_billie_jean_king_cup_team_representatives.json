      "text": "# List of Serbia Billie Jean King Cup team representatives\n\nThis is a list of tennis players who have represented the Serbia Billie Jean King Cup team in an official Billie Jean King Cup match. Also included are those who played for the Yugoslavia Fed Cup team or the Serbia and Montenegro Fed Cup team. Serbia are considered a direct successor of both those teams and share their historical records. The player's win–loss record is their combined total, so may include ties played for Serbia while they were known as their previous names. For players who have competed for other nations, only matches played under the Serbian or its previous team flags are included. Players are ordered by the team they debuted for.\nKey\nLists are correct as of 12 April 2025, after the tie against the Croatia.\nSerbia (2007–present)\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=font-size:97%\n!width=200|Player\n!width=100|W–L(Total)\n!width=100|W–L(Singles)\n!width=100|W–L(Doubles)\n!width=50|Ties\n!width=100|Debut\n|-\n| ||0–1||0–0||0–1||1||2025\n|-\n| ||1–2||1–1||0–1||2||2025\n|-\n| ||1–3||1–0||0–3||3||2024\n|-\n| ||0–3||0–0||0–3||3||2024\n|-\n|  ||9–8||9–6||0–2||15||2023\n|-\n|  ||8–12||6–8||2–4||16||2022\n|-\n|  ||0–1||0–1||0–0||1||2022\n|-\n|  ||1–4||0–1||1–3||4||2022\n|-\n|  ||3–5||0–0||3–5||8||2022\n|-\n| ||0–1||0–0||0–1||1||2022\n|-\n|  ||12–8||7–3||5–5||14||2018\n|-\n|  ||4–6||2–3||2–3||7||2017\n|-\n|  ||0–3||0–0||0–3||3||2017\n|-\n|  ||14–10||9–5||5–5||15||2015\n|-\n|  ||11–12||2–8||9–4||15||2014\n|-\n|  ||2–3||0–2||2–1||3||2014\n|-\n| ||2–4||1–3||1–1||3||2013\n|-\n|  ||28–14||15–8||13–6||28||2011\n|-\n|  ||6–11||4–9||2–2||8||2010\n|-\n|  ||0–3||0–1||0–2||2||2008\n|-\n|  ||2–2||1–2||1–0||3||2007\n|-\n|}\nSerbia & Montenegro (1995–2006)\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=font-size:97%\n!width=200|Player\n!width=100|W–L(Total)\n!width=100|W–L(Singles)\n!width=100|W–L(Doubles)\n!width=50|Ties\n!width=100|Debut\n|-\n|  ||4–1||1–0||3–1||4||2006\n|-\n|  ||20–9||17–7||3–2||17||2006\n|-\n|  ||3–6||3–2||0–4||7||2005\n|-\n|  ||2–1||2–1||0–0||3||2004\n|-\n|  ||9–10||3–6||6–4||15||2004\n|-\n|  ||1–1||0–0||1–1||2||2002\n|-\n|  ||34–16||27–11||7–5||31||2001\n|-\n|  ||0–3||0–3||0–0||3||1999\n|-\n|  ||0–3||0–0||0–3||3||1999\n|-\n|  ||0–1||0–0||0–1||1||1998\n|-\n|  ||1–1||0–1||1–0||2||1998\n|-\n|  ||6–0||1–0||5–0||5||1997\n|-\n|  ||8–9||7–5||1–4||12||1996\n|-\n|  ||33–19||18–8||15–11||37||1995\n|-\n|  ||15–8||6–5||9–3||18||1995\n|-\n|  ||8–2||1–0||7–2||9||1995\n|-\n|}\nSFR Yugoslavia (1969–1992)\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=font-size:97%\n!width=200|Player\n!width=100|W–L(Total)\n!width=100|W–L(Singles)\n!width=100|W–L(Doubles)\n!width=50|Ties\n!width=100|Debut\n|-\n|  ||6–6||5–4||1–2||9||1992\n|-\n|  ||4–8||2–5||2–3||7||1991\n|-\n|  ||4–3||3–1||1–2||4||1990\n|-\n|  ||5–12||4–9||1–3||13||1989\n|-\n|  ||0–4||0–3||0–1||3||1988\n|-\n|  ||4–7||3–5||1–2||8||1986\n|-\n|  ||4–1||0–0||4–1||5||1985\n|-\n|  ||30–13||15–8||15–5||24||1981\n|-\n|  ||13–12||5–5||8–7||15||1979\n|-\n|  ||0–2||0–1||0–1||1||1979\n|-\n|  ||2–2||1–1||1–1||2||1978\n|-\n|  ||0–1||0–0||0–1||1||1976\n|-\n|  ||1–4||1–2||0–2||3||1975\n|-\n|  ||19–18||10–8||9–10||24||1973\n|-\n|  ||0–4||0–2||0–2||2||1973\n|-\n|  ||0–1||0–0||0–1||1||1970\n|-\n|  ||0–4||0–2||0–2||2||1969\n|-\n|  ||0–2||0–2||0–0||2||1969\n|-\n|  ||0–1||0–0||0–1||1||1969\n|-\n|}\nHeart Award\nThe following players have received the Billie Jean King Cup Heart Award, an initiative by the International Tennis Federation, for representing their country with distinction, showing exceptional courage on court, and demonstrating outstanding commitment to their team during the Billie Jean King Cup.\n* 2018: Europe/Africa Zone Group I: Olga Danilović\n* 2012: World Group semifinals: Jelena Janković (2/2)\n* 2011: World Group / World Group II first round: Bojana Jovanovski Petrović\n* 2010: World Group / World Group II first round: Jelena Janković (1/2)\nNotes\nReferences"
