The areas where these award funds are to be spent include but are not limited to areas of experimental psychology, the topics of sensation, perception, motivation, emotion, learning, memory, cognition, language, and action. The award preference is given to experimental work with a quantitative approach or experimental research seeking physiological explanations.\nRecipients\nSource: [http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/troland-research-awards.html NAS]\n* Evelina Fedorenko (2025) for groundbreaking contributions and insights into the language network in the human brain.\n* Nicholas Turk-Browne (2025) for pioneering contributions advancing our understanding of learning and memory in the human brain.\n* Christopher Harvey (2024)\n* Jennifer Trueblood (2024)\n:: For her contributions to computational models of decision making.\n* Tim Buschman (2023)\n::For his groundbreaking insights into the neural mechanisms of cognitive control.\n* Catherine Hartley (2023)\n:: For her pioneering contributions to the understanding of the adolescent mind and brain.\n* Roozbeh Kiani (2022)\n::For his seminal contributions to understanding visually-based decisions.\n* Leah Somerville (2022)\n::For her pioneering research on how brain development shapes psychological functioning from childhood to adulthood.\n* Michael J.
