It is the fifth installment of the crossover series Warriors Orochi, a combination of the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series. The game was released in Japan on September 27, 2018, and in North America and Europe in October.\nAn updated version, titled Warriors Orochi 4: Ultimate (known in Japan as , was released in Japan on December 19, 2019, and was released in North America and Europe on February 14, 2020.\nGameplay\nAs with the previous iterations, the player is given control of a three-man team consisting of characters from the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series. Each character has a class type that determines their ability: Power, Speed, and Technique; the Wonder type introduced in Warriors Orochi 3 has been removed. New to the series is the concept of magic and Sacred Treasures, techniques that allow characters to perform special feats to overcome enemies. These depend on a specific category that is separate from the class system, and are performed by holding down the right shoulder button and pressing either the normal, charge, or musou attack buttons, the latter two requiring a special magic gauge, and the last also requiring half of a player's musou gauge. As such, these replace the type actions from the previous games. Because of this, characters from the Dynasty Warriors series lack their second musou attack, but retain the ability to perform an aerial musou attack, and characters from the Samurai Warriors series lack their special attacks, but retain the ability to perform hyper attacks.  The ability to mount a horse remains in Warriors Orochi 4, and is performed by holding down the right shoulder button and pressing the jump button.\nThe Awakening mechanic from Dynasty Warriors 8 and Musou Gokui mechanic from Samurai Warriors 4 are unified in Warriors Orochi 4, and may only be activated by obtaining a rare powerup during gameplay and pressing the left analog stick; when playing with only a single Joy-Con on the Nintendo Switch, this is instead activated by pressing both SL and SR, as the left analog stick alone is normally mapped to the character switch functionality. Only one character from a team may use this at a given time, though the character activating it need not be the character that obtained the powerup, and players may still switch characters while the mode is active. Once activated, the character may perform their Rage attack, consistent with both Dynasty Warriors 8 and Samurai Warriors 4. Characters central to the story are, once the relevant portions of the story are cleared, given a \"deification\" form based on figures from Greek or Norse mythology, which will be in effect while Awakening or Musou Gokui is in effect, strengthening their various other actions in the process.\nAs with previous games, most stages in Warriors Orochi 4 are taken from either earlier installments of the Warriors Orochi series, or the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors source games, with a minimal amount of original stages, reskinned to suit the theme of Warriors Orochi 4. New to this game are mashup stages where one part of a stage is taken from Dynasty Warriors and another part is taken from Samurai Warriors; for example, the Baidi Castle stage from Dynasty Warriors 8 has the upper portion taken from the Oshi Castle stage from Samurai Warriors 4.\nThe game features several multiplayer options, including a three-versus-three competitive multiplayer mode.\nPlot\nFollowing the events of Warriors Orochi 3, the heroes of the Three Kingdoms and Sengoku period return to their time, having forgotten all their exploits in the dimensional world. Meanwhile, Zeus, the king of Olympus, decides to bring them back for an unclear purpose. His son, Perseus, weary of Zeus' constant meddling of mortal affairs, decides to steal his eight Ouroboros bracelets, made from the hair of Medusa and containing a godly power, and contact the mortals, only to end up causing them to be scattered across the world.\nSubsequently, the heroes are divided into four factions, each with a bracelet wielder. Perseus leads the first one, which includes Naotora Ii, Guan Yinping, and Yukimura Sanada, each controlling the power of Aphrodite, Freya, and Tyr, respectively. The second is led by the Mystic Nuwa and includes Nobunaga Oda, who controls the power of Izanagi. The third is led by Zeus' children, Ares and Athena, and includes Zhao Yun, Mitsunari Ishida, and Cao Pi, each controlling the power of Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon, respectively. The final faction includes Da Ji and Lu Bu, who wields the power of Thor. The first two factions link up, as Nobunaga and Nuwa had only wanted to test the mantle of their adversary. Yukimura forms a bond with Perseus, while Ares is revealed to have earned the loyalty of Cao Pi and Hideyoshi Toyotomi, whom he mistakenly thinks is a bracelet wielder, by promising them worldly power, but they realize that he has no intention of keeping it.\nPerseus eventually unmasks himself as Loki, a servant of Odin, the king of Asgard, who secretly leads Da Ji's faction. He deliberately scattered the bracelets so the heroes could channel their godly power, therefore stabilizing the world enough for Odin to enact his plan: summoning the God of Destruction, the world's will taking the form of Orochi, so he can grow Yggdrasil and create a weapon powerful enough to destroy the universe and start it with a clean slate. Odin offers Ares, frustrated by Zeus' inaction, a chance to depose his father. When the heroes finally defeat Zeus, who admits that he only wanted to spar with them, Ares snaps and kills him, absorbing his power and declaring himself the new king of Olympus.\nA distraught Athena joins the heroes to prevent Odin from completing his plan. After a series of battles, Odin becomes impatient of Ares' failure to contain the coalition and steals Zeus' power from him. To atone for his actions, Ares chooses to sacrifice a part of his life force to resurrect his father. Meanwhile, the God of Destruction's arrival unexpectedly resurrects the real Orochi, who assists the heroes to kill him before being killed himself. The heroes, however, are too late to stop Odin from growing Yggdrasil. At the last minute, Loki turns on Odin and causes Yggdrasil to weaken, having had a change of heart and wanting to avenge his fallen friends, who were killed by Odin during Ragnarok. An enraged Odin kills Loki, only to perish at the hands of the heroes.\nThe victory is short-lived, however, as the toll of Orochi's and the God of Destruction's deaths have split apart the balance of the world. The Olympians and the Mystics band together to send the heroes back to their time. The heroes once again lose the memories of their exploits, though they retain a sense that there are beings watching them from above.\nUltimate\nThe new story in Ultimate follows an alternate timeline which diverges from the original game's story shortly before the confrontation between the God of Destruction and Orochi. There are three new chapters: Chapter 6, Chapter 7, and the Final Chapter, the latter two having separate endings.\nIn Chapter 6, Loki abandons Odin's cause earlier and reunites with Yukimura. They meet Gaia, the Earth's personification, who appears as a disembodied voice. It is revealed that Loki and Gaia were working together with the real Perseus to deceive Odin, but Loki had to kill Perseus to gain Odin's trust. Recalling the Earth's memories, Gaia learns that Odin's soul is tied to Yggdrasil, so they have to return it back to the tree if they want to stop Odin for good. Throughout the campaign, Loki admits that Perseus' soul was shattered when he killed him, giving Gaia an idea to gather them all so they may be able to resurrect him.\nIn Chapter 7, alongside the two, the heroes are joined by Hades, ruler of the underworld. Hades explains that he was the person responsible for saving Odin's soul after Ragnarok. During the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VV5hHagKW0 fight against the God of Destruction], Zeus and Hades channel his power to Gaia, giving her a new body. Eventually, Hades regains Odin's soul and returns it back to the tree, enabling the heroes to kill Odin before the gods send the heroes back to their world.\nMeanwhile, the Final Chapter is unlocked by gathering all fragments of Perseus' soul scattered in previous battles. The chapter begins right before the final battle with Odin in Chapter 7. A resurrected Perseus tells the heroes that Hades is the mastermind behind Odin's plan to create Yggdrasil: Hades had sent Odin to work towards Yggdrasil so he could snatch it and empower himself, giving him the means to depose Zeus as king of Olympus. Gaia and Kaguya work together to send the heroes back in time and save Odin from Hades. Through the former, they learn that to stop Hades, they will have to release Odin's soul from Yggdrasil. The heroes travel to the underworld to retrieve the Bident, a weapon capable of severing a soul from the tree. During the final confrontation, Hades taunts Odin that he has foreseen the latter's death, which will happen only if he regains his soul. Despite this, Odin retakes his soul anyway, enabling the others to defeat Hades and forcing him back to the underworld. While the others leave Yggdrasil as it begins collapsing, Odin chooses to remain behind, promising Loki that he will survive somehow. The battle with Hades done, Loki, the Olympians, and the Mystics bid the heroes farewell before returning them back to their world.\nCharacters\nThe original game features 170 playable characters. With the exception of the collaboration characters from other franchises, all playable characters from Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate return.

His voice actor is Hiro Shimono.\n* Ares (Speed): The Greek god of war and Zeus' son. Prideful and arrogant, he loathes humans and detests his father's tendency to live among them.
