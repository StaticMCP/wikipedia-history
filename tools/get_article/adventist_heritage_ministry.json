Shortly after its founding the organization adopted the motto, \"The Past With a Future.\"\nHistory\nThe organization did not come under church ownership until 1988.\nIn 1984 AHM purchased  that was originally part of William Miller's farm in Low Hampton, New York. Included in this purchase was William Miller's house built in 1815 and nearby Ascension Rock, where local Millerites are reported to have waited for Christ's return on October 22, 1844. In 1985 the organization published the first issue of its periodical, the AHP Bulletin, containing updates and mailed to the organizations supporters.\nIn 1989 AHM purchased  near Port Gibson, New York. Three years later the organization purchased a barn that originally belonged to Luther Edson, Hiram Edson's father, dismantled it, and transported it to the Edson farm to be re-erected there.\nIn 1994 the organization's name was formally changed to \"Adventist Heritage Ministry\" and initial plans were laid for the development of a Historic Adventist Village consisting of nearly a three block area that included the home of James and Ellen White, the home of Deacon John and Betsey White, the Loughborough property, and the surrounding area.\nIn 2005 the organization purchased the home of Joseph Bates in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.\nThe organization is governed by a board of trustees elected by their constituent organization, the Ellen G. White Estate board of trustees.\nBoard Chairs: Lawrence E. Crandall, 1981-1988; Robert L. Dale, 1988-1997; James R. Nix, 1997-present.\nPresidents: Lawrence E. Crandall, 1981-1991; James R.
