The Monument Class Descriptions were created by English Heritage as part of the Monuments Protection Programme.\nBecause archaeological remains are seldom good subjects for rigorous classification, these monument classes are regarded as provisional. However, they provide a good basis for beginning to understand the variability of the archaeological record in England.\nPrehistoric Monuments\nEarly Prehistoric Monuments\n* Avenues (multi-period)\n* Bank Barrows (multi-period)\n* Bowl Barrows (multi-period)\n* Causewayed Enclosures\n* Concentric Stone Circles\n* Cup and Ring Marked Stones (multi-period)\n* Cursus\n* D-Shaped Barrows\n* Enclosed Cremation Cemeteries (multi-period)\n* Entrance Graves (multi-period)\n* Flint Mines\n* Four Poster Stone Circles (multi-period)\n* Henge Enclosures\n* Henges\n* Hengiform Monuments\n* Inhumation Cemeteries (Prehistoric) (multi-period)\n* Large Irregular Stone Circles (multi-period)\n* Large Regular Stone Circles (multi-period)\n* Long Barrows\n* Long Mortuary Enclosures\n* Long Mounds\n* Monumental Mounds\n* Oval Barrows\n* Pit Circles\n* Pond Barrows\n* Round Barrow Cemeteries (multi-period)\n* Simple Passage Graves\n* Standing Stones (multi-period)\n* Stone Alignments (multi-period)\n* Stone Axe Factories (multi-period)\n* Timber Circles\n* Tor Cairns\nBronze Age\n* Avenues (multi-period)\n* Bank Barrows (multi-period)\n* Bell Barrows\n* Bowl Barrows (multi-period)\n* Burnt Mounds\n* Cairnfields\n* Clothes Line Enclosures (multi-period)\n* Coaxial Field Systems (multi-period) -
