The awards are presented at regional gala ceremonies throughout the year, culminating in a Grand Final event.\nHistory\nThe World Travel Awards were founded by Graham E. Cooke. The first ceremony was held in Los Angeles, California, and the programme has since expanded into a series of regional events staged across Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Middle East, followed by a Grand Final.\nIn 2010, The Independent reported that London had been named \"World’s Leading Destination\" at the awards, while other categories recognised Etihad Airways and the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai.\nIn 2023, The Independent reported that the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin was named \"Europe’s Leading Tourist Attraction\" at the World Travel Awards, with organisers noting that the awards had been running for 30 years and had been referred to as the \"Oscars of the travel industry\".\nCategories\nThe programme features hundreds of categories, covering sectors such as:\n* Airlines and airports\n* Hotels, resorts and villas\n* Destination marketing organisations\n* Tour operators and travel agencies\n* Cruise lines and ports\n* Travel technology providers\nCategories are periodically revised to reflect changes and trends in the industry, such as sustainable tourism and eco-hospitality.\nVoting and selection\nNominations are drawn from previous winners, industry recommendations and vetted entries.
