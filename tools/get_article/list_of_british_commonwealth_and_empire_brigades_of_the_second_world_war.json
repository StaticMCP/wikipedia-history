At the time, despite their multi-national composition, such formations were often referred as \"British\".\nThe territories and peoples comprising many countries mentioned below have changed since the war; in some cases the names of countries have changed or do not correspond to modern country names.\nIn the list below:\n* \"formed from\" indicates that a brigade was created in part from another unit and;\n* \"formerly\" indicates a simple unit/name change.\nAustralia\n*1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade\n*1st Armoured Brigade\n*2nd Armoured Brigade\n*3rd Army Tank Brigade\n*4th Armoured Brigade\n*6th
