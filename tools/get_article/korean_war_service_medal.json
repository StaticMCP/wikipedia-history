The Taeguk symbol is not worn on the center of the suspension ribbon of the original medal or the suspension ribbon of the crossed bullets medal. The Taeguk symbol is only on the center of the service ribbon.\nCriteria\nThe South Korean government specifies the eligibility period and criteria. Only the South Korean-provided medal is approved by the US government to meet the US criteria for wear on military uniforms.\nIn order to wear the medal and ribbon personnel must have:\n*served between the outbreak of hostilities, June 25, 1950, and the date the armistice was signed, July 27, 1953:\n*been on permanent assignment or on temporary duty for 30 consecutive days or 60 non-consecutive days, and\n*performed their duty within the territorial limits of Korea, in the waters immediately adjacent thereto or in aerial flight over Korea participating in actual combat operations or in support of combat operations.\nOrder of precedence\nThe order of precedence for non-US service medals and ribbons is determined by date of approval. The Republic of Korea War Service Medal (August 20, 1999) should be worn after the Kuwait Liberation Medal (March 16, 1995). For the majority of Korean War veterans, the medal will be worn after the United Nations Service Medal, or the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal if they served during that conflict.\nForeign acceptance\nAustralia\nOn April 6, 2017, the Korean War Service Medal was authorized for acceptance and approved for wear, by the Governor-General of Australia. This approval came after the efforts of the  Australian Council of Korea Veterans Associations to get the South Korean government to extend a new offer for the government of Australia to accept. Veterans who meet the eligibility criteria may obtain the medals from private medal dealers.\nNew Zealand\nOn April 23, 2001, the Korean War Service Medal was authorized for distribution and wear by service members of the British Commonwealth forces including the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF).\nUnited States\nveteran in 2009.]]\nWhile a number of countries accepted the medal, at the time of the Korean War Service Medal's presentation to UN troops the United States of America declined to award the medal to US soldiers.  This was based on regulations of the time which curtailed the acceptance and wear of foreign decorations on US military uniforms; the US Congress changed the law on May 8, 1954.  Although subsequently some veterans attempted to have the award accepted, the Korean War Service Medal faded into history after the war and was not heard of again until 1996.  At that time the Army noted that it could find no record that the South Korean government ever offered the medal to the Department of Defense.  This was technically true since the original offer was made to the United Nations Command. The Army took the position that unless the South Korean government resurrected their original offer, it was \"not in a position to officially recognize or approve acceptance of the medal.\" Although some photographs show the Korean War Service Medal displayed with a Taeguk on the suspension ribbon of the medal, this is not authorized and indicates that it is a photo of a reproduction medal.\nOn August 20, 1999, Francis M. Rush Jr., Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army authorized the Korean War Service Medal for distribution and wear by service members of the United States military.  The task of issuing the medal was assigned to Randolph Air Force Base while the National Personnel Records Center was responsible for providing documentation to verify eligibility and updating military records to show receipt of the award.\nOn May 13, 2000, the South Korean government announced it would provide the medal at no cost to eligible Korean War veterans for the years 2000 to 2003 (50th anniversary of Korean War, 1950 to 1953). The two governments held 50th anniversary ceremonies during that time period. The U.S. Air Force was the designated agency to receive and designate the medals.\n50th anniversary medals\nThe 50th anniversary of the Korean War: The blue boxes for the medal from South Korea has written in English, \"Korean War Service Medal\", the reverse side of the enclosed medal is inscribed in Korean writing, \"6.25 Incident Participation Medal\".\nSee also\n*List of military decorations\n*Awards and decorations of the United States military\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://koreanwar60.com Korean War 60th Anniversary Site]"
