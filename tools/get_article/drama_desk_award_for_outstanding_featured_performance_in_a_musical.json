From 1975 to 2022, acting awards were presented in eight categories: separate categories by gender; further divided by lead or featured performer; producing four acting awards each for plays and musicals.\nIn 2023, the Drama Desk organization announced that, starting with that year's awards, the eight acting categories had been retired and replaced with four gender neutral categories with twice the winners and nominees: separate categories by lead or featured performer; producing two acting categories each for plays and musicals. The former awards for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical and Featured Actress in a Musical were merged to create this Outstanding Featured Performance in a Musical category.\nWinners and nominees\n;Key\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Year\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Actor\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Title\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Character\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Ref.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"11\" |2023\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Kevin Del Aguila\n|Some Like It Hot\n|Osgood Fielding III\n|rowspan=10|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Alex Newell\n|Shucked\n|Lulu\n|-\n|Kevin Cahoon\n|Shucked\n|Peanut\n|-\n|Robyn Hurder\n|A Beautiful Noise\n|Marcia Murphey\n|-\n|Mark Jacoby\n|A Beautiful Noise\n|Neil Diamond (Now)\n|-\n|Tarra Conner Jones\n|White Girl in Danger\n|Nell Gibbs\n|-\n|Julia Lester\n|Into the Woods\n|Little Red Riding Hood\n|-\n|Daniel Radcliffe\n|Merrily We Roll Along\n|Charley Kringas\n|-\n|Phillipa Soo\n|Into the Woods\n|Cinderella\n|-\n|Mare Winningham\n|A Man of No Importance\n|Lilly Byrne\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n! rowspan=\"10\" |2024\n|Kecia Lewis\n|'Hell's Kitchen\n|Miss Liza Jane\n|rowspan=10|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Bebe Neuwirth\n|Cabaret\n|Fräulein Schneider'\n|-\n|Shoshana Bean\n|''Hell's Kitchen\n|Jersey\n|-\n|Natalie Venetia Belcon\n|Buena Vista Social Club\n|Omara Portuondo\n|-\n|Dorian Harewood\n|The Notebook\n|Older Noah Calhoun\n|-\n|Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer\n|Spamalot\n|Lady of the Lake\n|-\n|Steven Pasquale\n|Teeth''\n|Pastor Bill O'Keefe\n|-\n|Maryann Plunkett\n|The Notebook\n|Older Allison \"Allie\" Calhoun\n|-\n|Thom Sesma\n|Dead Outlaw\n|Thomas Noguchi\n|-\n|Emily Skinner\n|Suffs\n|Alva Belmont / Phoebe Burn\n|-\n! rowspan=13| 2025\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Brooks Ashmanskas\n| Smash\n| Nigel\n|rowspan=12|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n| Jak Malone\n| Operation Mincemeat\n| Hester Leggatt & others\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n| Michael Urie\n| Once Upon a Mattress\n| Prince Dauntless\n|-\n| Nicholas Barasch\n| Pirates!
