It is the philosophical view of determinism applied to the process or direction by which history unfolds. Historical determinism places the cause of the event behind it.\nThe concept of determinism appeared in the 19th century. The main idea is that certain factors determine the existence of humans and therefore limit the scope of their free will. In history, this is an approach that holds that history is intrinsically meaningful. Used as a pejorative, it is normally meant to designate a rigid finalist or mechanist conception of historical unfolding that makes the future appear as an inevitable and predetermined result of the past.\nSee also\n* Determinism\n* Dialectical materialism\n* Economic determinism\n* Environmental determinism\n* Free will\n* Geographic determinism\n* Hegelianism\n* Historical materialism\n* Marxism\n* Myth of progress\n* Technological determinism\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
