      "text": "# 2024 Minnesota Vikings season\n\n| AP All-pros =\n| uniform         = File:Vikings 2024 Vapor Fuse.png\n| shortnavlink    = Vikings seasons\n}}\nThe 2024 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 64th in the National Football League (NFL), their ninth playing their home games at U.S. Bank Stadium, their 20th under the ownership of Zygi Wilf and their third under the head coach/general manager tandem of Kevin O'Connell and Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. The Vikings improved on their 7–10 record from 2023 after a Week 11 win over the Tennessee Titans and made the playoffs after a one-year absence.\nFor the first time since 2017, quarterback Kirk Cousins was not on the roster, as he signed with the Atlanta Falcons in the offseason. As such, the team was in a rebuilding year with very low expectations. Despite this, the Vikings started 11–2 for the first time since 2009, anchored by a stout defensive unit and strong performance by quarterback Sam Darnold, which helped to clinch a playoff berth when the Seattle Seahawks lost to the Green Bay Packers in Week 15. After their win against the Packers in Week 17, the Vikings achieved their first season with at least 14 wins since going 15–1 in 1998. However, the Vikings ended their season with two blowout losses: first to the division rival Detroit Lions in their Week 18 game, which clinched the 1st seed for the Lions, then to the rival Los Angeles Rams in the wild card round, which eliminated the Vikings from the playoffs. All four of the team's losses this season happened at the hands of the Lions and the Rams during back-to-back weeks. The Vikings became the first 14–win wild card team in NFL history. The fourteen wins set an all-time record for wins for a team that failed to reach the Divisional Round of the playoffs in the Super Bowl era.\nOn June 6, 2024, the Vikings unveiled their new \"Winter Warrior\" uniform, which is all-white and features the first white helmet in franchise history.\nThe team's first round pick this season, J. J. McCarthy, missed the season after getting surgery on a knee injury he acquired during a preseason game.\nOffseason\nPlayers lost\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Player\n!style=\"\"| New team\n!style=\"\"| Date\n|-\n| RB\n| Alexander Mattison\n| Las Vegas Raiders\n| Released on March 4\n|-\n| DE\n| Dean Lowry\n| Pittsburgh Steelers\n| Released on March 12\n|-\n| OT\n| Hakeem Adeniji\n| Cleveland Browns\n| Signed on March 13\n|-\n| QB\n| Kirk Cousins\n| Atlanta Falcons\n| Signed on March 13\n|-\n| DE\n| Marcus Davenport\n| Detroit Lions\n| Signed on March 13\n|-\n| LB\n| Jordan Hicks\n| Cleveland Browns\n| Signed on March 13\n|-\n| LB\n| D.
