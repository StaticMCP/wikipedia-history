The ground was originally named the \"James Burke Reserve\" but was later named Western Park after a vote by tenants.\nWestern Park was recently included in the Baw Baw Shire's 'Warragul Outdoor Recreational Plan' which involves upgrades of the facilities and sporting arenas.\nAn electronic scoreboard was installed in May 2011, allowing both football and cricket clubs to display a range of information, statistics and advertising to spectators.\nA new BMX track at Western Park was opened in October 2011. The new track was designed with the advice of former junior BMX World Champion Ashley McCutcheon.\nFour new lighting towers were erected in April 2012. The towers satisfy AFL Victoria's lighting standards, which makes playing football matches at the ground at night now a possibility.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bawbawshire.vic.gov.au/ Baw Baw Shire]\n*[http://warragulfnc.vcfl.com.au/ Warragul Football Club]\n*[http://www.sportingpulse.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-6159-80492-0-0 Warragul Industrials Football Club]\n*[http://westernparkcc.vic.cricket.com.au/ Western Park Cricket Club]\n*[http://westernpark.bmxa.com.au/ Western Park BMX Club]\nReferences"
