The chase draws bounty hunters from across the galaxy and drags the player characters through locales like the Mos Eisley Cantina and the perilous Jundland Wastes.\n*\"Riders of the Maelstrom\" dumps the party onto a star-cruiser teeming with corruption. What begins as luxury soon turns into danger, as imperial Moffs conspire and pirates strike, plunging the characters into high-stakes espionage.\n*\"Death in the Undercity\" unfolds on the Mon Calamari homeworld, where a vital floating city is targeted by sabotage. After a botched shuttle approach and a politically charged double murder accusation, the PCs must unravel a conspiracy and dodge a lynch mob.\nReception\nAndrew Rilstone reviewed Star Wars Classic Adventures Volume Three for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall, and stated that \"Chases, explosions, far-fetched locations, a fair smattering of double-crossing and intrigue. These scenarios recapture the flavour of the Star Wars movies well. They're very well explained, if a bit too contrived. Good value for any Star Wars referee.\"\nReviews\n*Dragon #234 (Oct., 1996)\nReferences"
