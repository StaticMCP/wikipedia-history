A branch of the Ohio and Erie Canal, it was completed in 1843 and operated until its decline in the late 1800s, playing a significant role in the development of the coal and salt industries in the region.\nRoute and construction\nThe canal began in Carroll, where it split from the Ohio and Erie Canal. From there, it paralleled the Hocking River southeast through Lancaster, Logan, and Nelsonville, terminating near Athens. The route stretched approximately 56 miles (90 km), with over 26 locks constructed to manage elevation changes.\nConstruction began in the late 1830s and was completed by 1843. Labor was provided primarily by local workers and Irish immigrants, and much of the infrastructure was built using cut stone and timber. Canal boats were drawn by mules or horses along adjacent towpaths.\nEconomic role\nThe Hocking Canal served as a crucial transportation route for the coal, salt, pig iron, and agricultural products of the Hocking Valley. Towns like Logan and Nelsonville grew rapidly due to the availability of this waterway, which allowed bulk materials to be shipped northward to Columbus and the Ohio and Erie Canal system.\nIn addition to goods, the canal supported the movement of people and contributed to the region's development in the mid-19th century. Salt furnaces near Chauncey and coal mining in Nelsonville depended heavily on the canal during its peak years.\nDecline and abandonment\nThe rise of the railroad, particularly the Hocking Valley Railway, began to undercut the canal's relevance by the 1870s. Flooding along the Hocking River caused repeated damage to canal infrastructure, and by the 1880s, repair costs exceeded revenues.\nCommercial use declined steadily, and by 1890 the canal was officially abandoned. Some segments were filled in, others were left to erode or overtaken by vegetation. Rail and road development later replaced most of the original route.\nSurviving remnants and legacy\nDespite its closure, several portions of the Hocking Canal remain visible today.\nLock 19 (Sheep Pen Lock)\nLock #19, located just west of Nelsonville in eastern Starr Township, is one of the most intact structures. It features a stone-lined chamber and is preserved as part of a roadside park.\n*\nHaydenville Lock and Culvert\nNear Haydenville, a surviving lock and culvert built of cut stone remain visible off the old U.S. Route 33. These features have been documented by the Southeast Ohio History Center for their intact 19th-century masonry.\n*\nOld Town Creek Aqueduct (Logan)\nA preserved aqueduct crosses Old Town Creek in Logan. It features a cut-stone arch and submerged 1830s oak timbers still intact beneath the water. The site is maintained as part of Aqueduct Park.\n*\nCanal towpaths and trails\nSections of the original towpath and canal bed have been incorporated into modern recreational trails, particularly the Old Town Creek Trail in Logan, which runs parallel to the historic alignment for about one mile.\n*\nIn the Nelsonville–Athens corridor, the Hockhocking Adena Bikeway follows portions of the former canal route.\n*\nCultural impact\nSome canal stones were reused in public works projects, including WPA-era bleachers in Nelsonville’s Glouster Memorial Park. Wetlands along the old canal bed now support wildlife such as beavers and herons.\n*\nLost infrastructure\nThe last visible traces of the canal in Athens were removed in 1983 to make way for a residential development. Many other sections on private land have disappeared due to erosion, farming, or construction.\nSee also\n* Ohio and Erie Canal\n* Hocking River\n* List of canals in the United States\nExternal links\n* [https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Hocking_Canal Ohio History Central: Hocking Canal]\n* [https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=12628 Historical Marker Database: Hocking Canal Marker]"
