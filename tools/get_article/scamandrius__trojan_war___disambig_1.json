He appears in the Iliad, the 8th-century BC epic poem written by Homer.\nFamily\nThe Trojan Scamandrius was the son of a man named Strophius by an unnamed mother.\nMythology\nBefore the war, Scamandrius was trained in archery by the hunting goddess Artemis herself, and with her guidance he excelled in the use of bow and arrow. Scamandrius fought in the Trojan War on the Trojan side, and was slain in battle during the ninth year of the war by Menelaus, the husband of Helen, who struck him with his spear in the back as Scamandrius ran away. He fell on his face and died.\nSee also\n* Rhesus of Thrace\n* Orion\n* Meriones\n* Scamander\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Homer, The Iliad with an English Translation by A.T.
