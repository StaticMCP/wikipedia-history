The route, which is signed east-west, runs from DE&nbsp;4 adjacent to the Christiana Hospital in Christiana southeast to DE&nbsp;273 near Hares Corner. The road passes through suburban areas between Wilmington and Newark, intersecting DE&nbsp;7 and Interstate&nbsp;95 (I-95) in Christiana and DE&nbsp;37 near the Wilmington Airport. Churchmans Road was originally a county road that was paved in the 1930s and realigned twice in the 1950s. DE&nbsp;58 was designated onto it in the 1980s.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;58 begins at an intersection with DE&nbsp;4 in Christiana. Past this intersection, the road continues northwest as Delaware Park Boulevard to provide access to Delaware Park – which consists of a Thoroughbred horse racetrack, casino, and golf course – and the Churchmans Crossing station on SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line that runs along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line. From DE&nbsp;4, DE&nbsp;58 heads east on Churchmans Road, a four-lane divided highway. The route passes to the north of Christiana Hospital and runs through commercial development before coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the DE&nbsp;7 freeway a short distance north of the northern terminus of DE&nbsp;1 at the I-95 (Delaware Turnpike) interchange. Just east of that interchange, DE&nbsp;58 forms the southern border of the Stanton Campus of Delaware Technical Community College. The route crosses over I-95 (Delaware Turnpike), where there is a ramp from I-95 southbound to DE&nbsp;58. This is the only direct ramp between DE&nbsp;58 and I-95, as all other access between the two routes must be made via DE&nbsp;7.\nPast I-95, DE&nbsp;58 becomes a two-lane undivided road and heads to the southeast through residential areas, crossing the Christina River. The route curves south through commercial development, widening back into a four-lane divided highway and intersecting DE&nbsp;37. Past the intersection with DE&nbsp;37, DE&nbsp;58 continues southeast as a two-lane undivided road and skirts the southwestern edge of Wilmington Airport. The route passes through light industrial development and reaches its terminus at DE&nbsp;273 near Hares Corner.\nDE&nbsp;58 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 26,430&nbsp;vehicles at the DE&nbsp;1/DE&nbsp;7 interchange to a low of 10,203&nbsp;vehicles at the DE&nbsp;37 intersection.\nHistory\nChurchmans Road existed as a county road by 1920. The entire road was paved by 1936. Churchmans Road originally ran from DE&nbsp;4 near Christiana to U.S. Route&nbsp;13 north of Hares Corner.  By 1952, the current alignment of Churchmans Road was constructed around the west side of Wilmington Airport from north of Airport Road to DE&nbsp;273 near Hares Corner, with a portion of the original road southeast of Airport Road being removed; the two pieces of the former alignment that remained are now Old Churchmans Road. The current alignment of Churchmans Road west of DE&nbsp;7 was built two years later, with the former alignment now Old Churchmans Road. DE&nbsp;58 was designated onto its current alignment in 1985. In 1999, the intersection at DE&nbsp;7 was converted into an interchange in a $25 million construction project. In 2003, construction began on a new bridge carrying DE&nbsp;58 over I-95 to replace the previous bridge, which was over 40 years old and experienced deterioration. Construction of the new bridge, which cost $17 million, was originally planned to be finished in fall 2005 but completion was delayed to fall 2006. The new bridge carrying DE&nbsp;58 over I-95 was built to accommodate future widening of I-95. Between May&nbsp;2005 and June&nbsp;2006, the portion of DE&nbsp;58 at the intersection with DE&nbsp;37 was reconstructed and widened into a divided highway as part of a $8.6 million project that also reconstructed and widened DE&nbsp;37 along Airport Road between DE&nbsp;58 and Commons Boulevard.\nMajor intersections\nMileposts run from east to west.\n|notes=Western terminus\n}}\n|notes=DE&nbsp;7 exit&nbsp;166; access to Delaware Tech\n}}\n|notes=Ramp from I-95 south to DE&nbsp;58; I-95 exit&nbsp;4B\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-058/ DE&nbsp;58 at AARoads.com]"
