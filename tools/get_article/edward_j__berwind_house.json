The structure was designed by Nathan Clark Mellen, with interiors by Jules Allard and sculptor Louis Ardisson.\nThe mansion was constructed in 1886 for the coal baron Edward J. Berwind, whose company Berwind-White supplied most of the coal used by the US Navy at the time, as well as most of the East Coast railroads and IRT subway trains in New York City. The interiors of the house have been considered one of the grandest in New York City, comparable to the main reading room of the New York Public Library.\nThe mansion was sold to the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences in 1945, then became the headquarters for the American Heart Association until 1978 when it was reconverted to residential use with a new penthouse. Other past tenants include Donna Summer, who lived on the main floor for a few years.\nGallery\nFile:Edward_J_Berwind_House_Fifth_Avenue_facade.jpg|Fifth Avenue facade facing Central Park\nFile:Edward J Berwind House second story window detail.jpg|Second story windows above the main entry\nFile:Edward J Berwind House entry arch.jpg|Oblique view of the main entry arch\nFile:Edward_J_Berwind_House_corbel_detail.jpg|Detail view of corbels on the 64th Street facade\nFile:Berwind house 2 E64th St patio jeh.jpg|Sidewalk moat, 64th Street side\nFile:Edward_J_Berwind_House_moat_railing.jpg|Sidewalk moat railing next to the main entry\nFile:Edward_J_Berwind_House_entry_pier.jpg|Carved stone pier at the main entry\nSee also\n*The Elms (Newport, Rhode Island), Berwind's summer mansion\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
