The series is about battlefields which are visited by Holmes, and is also about the corresponding battles. The series covers twelve battles. Both the first and the second series are about battles fought by British or English forces (sometimes with foreign allies). Nine of these were fought against German, French or Norman forces. The other three are from British or English civil wars.\nThe first series is about six battles fought in the region sometimes called the fatal avenue in the north of France and the south of Belgium. The second series is about six battles fought in the British Isles, and, in the case of Dunkirk, in the English Channel.\nThe series included descriptions of the battles, the events leading up to them and the events resulting from them, and the battlefields.\nEpisodes\nSeries One (1996)\nThis series is by BBC Bristol.\n# Agincourt (1415) (26 July 1996)\n# Waterloo (1815) (2 August 1996)\n# Mons and Le Cateau (1914) (9 August 1996)\n# The Somme (1916) (16 August 1996)\n# Arras (1940) (23 August 1996)\n# Operation Goodwood (1944) (30 August 1996)\nSeries Two (1997)\n# Hastings (1066) (14 November 1997)\n# Bosworth Field (1485) (21 November 1997)\n# Naseby (1645) (28 November 1997)\n# The Boyne (1690) (5 December 1997)\n# Dunkirk (1940) (12 December 1997)\n# The Blitz (1940–41) (19 December 1997)\nBooks\nBBC Books published a book, written by Holmes, to accompany each series:\n*War Walks: From Agincourt to Normandy, published in 1996, accompanies the first series.
