The Supreme Soviet was a unicameral institution and it consisted of 250 deputies (440 deputies before 1990). Deputies served five-year terms, but this was changed to four-year terms in 1978. The first multiparty elections were held on October 28, 1990, during the 1990 Georgian Supreme Soviet election. This was the first time that the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR began to exercise state power. For most of its history, the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR was dominated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Georgia.\nConvocations\n* 1st Convocation (1938–1946)\n* 2nd Convocation (1947–1950)\n* 3rd Convocation (1951–1954)\n* 4th Convocation (1955–1959)\n* 5th Convocation (1959–1962)\n* 6th Convocation (1963–1966)\n* 7th Convocation (1967–1970)\n* 8th Convocation (1971–1974)\n* 9th Convocation (1975–1979)\n* 10th Convocation (1980–1984)\n* 11th Convocation (1985–1989)\n* 12th Convocation (1990–1992), as the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia\nChairperson of the Supreme Soviet\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Picture\n! width=\"150\" |Name\n! width=\"150\" |Took office\n! width=\"150\" |Left office\n! width=\"150\" |Political party\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |Chairperson of the Supreme Soviet\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |1\n|\n|Joseph Kochlamazashvili\n(1906–1969)\n|8 July 1938\n|24 March 1947\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |2\n|\n|Vasily Gogua\n(1908–1967)\n|26 March 1947\n|26 March 1948\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |3\n|\n|Archil Gigoshvili\n(1907–1969)\n|26 March 1948\n|18 April 1951\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |4\n|\n|Mikhail Lelashvili\n(1910-?)\n|18 April 1951\n|6 April 1952\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |5\n|\n|Givi Javakhishvili\n(1912–1985)\n|6 April 1952\n|15 April 1953\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |6\n|\n|Archil Georgadze\n(1896-?)\n|15 April 1953\n|1954\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |7\n|\n|Victor Kupradze\n(1903–1985)\n|1954\n|26 April 1963\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |8\n|\n|Rafael Dvali\n(1909–1985)\n|26 April 1963\n|12 July 1971\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |9\n|\n|Irakli Abashidze\n(1909–1992)\n|12 July 1971\n|14 November 1990\n|CPSU\n|}\nChairperson of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet\nSee also\n* Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union\n* Supreme Soviet\n* Georgian SSR\nReferences"
