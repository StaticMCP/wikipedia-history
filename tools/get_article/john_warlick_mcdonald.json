Track One Diplomacy is State to State Diplomacy. But he and Diamond held that there were several other practical types of Diplomacy which could strengthen the relationships of peoples and governments, these included business to business, religious group to religious group, academic group diplomacy, professional peace building diplomacy, activism, research, training, and philanthropy. Subsequent tracks of Diplomacy have been added to include women's groups, sports and the arts.\nThroughout its 25 years, IMTD's mission embraced a wide range of peace building activities from a peace-building soccer/football tour throughout contested Kashmir, to water sharing agreements crafted by engineers between states which were technically at war, to conflict resolution training and reconciliation efforts around the world. Working tirelessly deep into his nineties, Ambassador McDonald and staff worked from their offices in Arlington, Virginia and traveled wherever their expertise was sought throughout the world.\nAwards\nMcDonald was a 1994 nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2009, he received the Peacemaker Award from the Association for Conflict Resolution.\nMcDonald received honorary degrees from Salisbury University, St. John's University, Teikyo University and Mount Mercy University.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4669880/gmu-au-conflict-resolution-fields Appearances] on C-SPAN"
