The kingdom existed from the 3rd to the 1st century BC.  Rome established it as a client kingdom after the Second Punic War and annexed it, first in 46 BC and again in 25 BC after a brief period of restored independence under King Juba II (30 BC–25 BC).\nList of kings\nLegendary kings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Reign\n!Notes\n!Image\n|-\n|Atlas\n|12th Century BC\n|King of Libya\n|\n|-\n|Iarbas\n|9th Century BC\n|King that welcomed Queen dido of Carthage and allowed establishment of the city of carthage, 814 BC\n|\n|}\nKings of the Massylii (Eastern Numidia)\nThe last ruler of the Massylii conquered the Masaesyli and created the unified Numidian kingdom.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Reign\n!Notes\n!Image\n|-\n|Madghis\n|4th Century BC\n|King of Numidia of which the mosoleum of Medghacen was named after\n|\n|-\n|Zelalsen\n|3rd early Century BC\n|Unknown, possibly shuphet\n|\n|-\n|Gala\n|late 3rd Century BC\n|father of Massinissa ,died 207 BCE\n|\n|-\n|Ozalces\n|207-206 BCE\n|Took over the throne of Gala after his death.\n|\n|-\n|Capussa\n|206–206 BCE\n|Took over Numidia in a coup d'état against Ozalces\n|\n|-\n|Lacumazes\n|206–206 BCE\n|Took over Numidia in a coup d'état against Capussa\n|\n|-\n|Masinissa\n|206–148 BCE\n|Unifier of Numidia, He Unified Massylia and Masaessylia, his kingdom starts east from the Emporia in Libya and ended west on the shores of the atlantic.\n|\n|}\nKings of the Masaesyli (Western Numidia)\n*Syphax (bef. 215–202)\n*Vermina (202–???)\n*Archobarzane (???–c. 157)\nKings of Numidia\ndedicated to \"Mikiwsan (= Micipsa), king of the Massyli\"]]\nThe three sons of Massinissa originally shared the kingdom, dividing responsibility. Micipsa later tried the same thing with his three heirs, but the result was a civil war. The Roman Republic defeated Numidia during the Jugurthine War. Gauda thus succeeded to a reduced Numidian kingdom. He divided the kingdom geographically between his two sons, establishing two different lines of Numidian kings. They were briefly displaced by a certain Hiarbas, but Roman intervention restored them.\n*Massinissa I (202–148)\n*Micipsa (148–118), son of Massinissa\n*Gulussa (148–145), son of Massinissa\n*Mastanabal (148–14?), son of Massinissa\n*Hiempsal I  (118–117), son of Micipsa\n*Adherbal (118–112), son of Micipsa\n*Jugurtha  (118–105), son of Mastanabal\n*Gauda  (105–88), son of Mastanabal\n*Hiarbas (??–81)\nEastern Numidia\nThis was the main Numidian kingdom after 81.\n*Hiempsal II (88–60), son of Gauda\n*Juba I (60–46), son of Hiempsal II\nAnnexed to Rome as province Africa Nova (46–30).\n*Juba II (30–25), son of Juba I\nAnnexed to Rome as province Africa Proconsularis (25 BCE - 193 CE).\nWestern Numidia\nThis was a much smaller chiefdom than Eastern Numidia\n*Masteabar (88–81)\n*Massinissa II (81–46)\n*Sittius (46–44), a Roman mercenary leader\n*Arabio (44–40)\nAnnexed to Rome as part of province Africa Nova (40–30).\n*Juba II (30–25), son of Juba I\nAnnexed to the Kingdom of Mauretania (25 BCE - 40 CE).\nReferences"
