It is a pavilion-style villa which can be booked as holiday accommodation.\nThe original colonial bungalow was built in the northern outskirts of Mirissa, on a steep cliff that forms the eastern coast of Weligama Bay. It was used by J. R. Jayewardene and his family on their holidays. It was burnt down in 1987 during the early days of the JVP Insurrection, following the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.\nIn 1997 Jayewardene's grandson, Pradeep, commissioned architect and family friend, Geoffrey Bawa, to rebuild the family holiday home. The main residence, a rectangular structure  long and  wide, is located on the crest of the hill which rises above the bay\nReferences"
