Under the political guidance of Lord Delamere they sought to ensure that colonial policy suited the interests of these White settlers. However, with a certain amount of migration from the sub-continent of India, then under British rule, the racial exclusivity of the prime areas for settling came into dispute, and in 1923 Lord Devonshire issued the Devonshire Declaration.\nColonial Development and Welfare Act 1940\nIn 1942 the provisions of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1940 (3 & 4 Geo. 6. c. 40) were used initially to fund the British Colonial Research Committee. Later the Colonial Social Science Research Council which was set up in 1944. The act provided for £5 million per year for development and £500,000 per year for research.\nColonial Development and Welfare Act 1945\nThe Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1945 (8 & 9 Geo. 6. c. 20) provided a significant extension of the 1940 act. The financing made available was increased to £120&nbsp;million for all purposes to be spent between 1946 and 1956.\nReferences"
