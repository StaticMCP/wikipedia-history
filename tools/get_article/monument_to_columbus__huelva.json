It is a work by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.\nFunded via a popular subscription in the United States channeled by the Columbus Memorial Fund Inc., the monument, 37-metre high, was built from 1927 to 1929. Erected on the Punta del Sebo, the confluence of the Tinto and Odiel rivers, it was inaugurated on 21 April 1929, during a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Miguel Primo de Rivera and the US ambassador Ogden H. Hammond.\nThe sculpted man (leaning on a Tau cross) is sometimes described as representing a friar from La Rábida, yet it originally was described (including by the author herself) as a statue of Christopher Columbus.\nIt consists of a mortar structure covered by ashlar masonry (calcarenite).\nSee also\n* List of monuments and memorials to Christopher Columbus\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
