The corps was formed on mobilization of the German Army in August 1914 and dissolved 23 January 1915 as the onset of trench warfare in the west negated the requirement for large cavalry formations.  It was commanded throughout its existence by  Georg von der Marwitz.\nCombat chronicle\nInitially on the Western Front with the 2nd, 4th and 9th Cavalry Divisions preceding the 1st and 2nd Armies.
