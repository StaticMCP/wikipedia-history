Abd al-Rahman III had gathered a large army of caliphal fighters, with the help of the Andalusi governor of Zaragoza, Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Tujibi. The Leonese king Ramiro II led the counterattack with an army constituted of his own troops, those of Castile under Count Fernán González, and the Navarrese under García Sánchez I.\nMoorish witnesses chronicle a spectacular eclipse of the sun that took place on the first day of the battle:\n}}\nThe battle lasted some days, with the allied Christian troops emerging victorious and routing the Cordovan forces. Furtun ibn Muhammad al-Tawil, wali of Huesca, withheld his troops from the battle. He was hunted down near Calatayud by Salama ibn Ahmad ibn Salama, taken to Córdoba, and crucified in front of its Al-Qasr.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
