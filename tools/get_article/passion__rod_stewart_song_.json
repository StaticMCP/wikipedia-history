It was the lead single and biggest hit from the album, reaching number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, number two in Canada, and a sizeable hit across Europe. The song was also released as a 12-inch promotional single with an extended running time of 7:30.\nBackground\n\"Passion\" describes the ubiquity of the phenomenon, delineating its universality by listing many of the people, places, and situations in which it is found. Passion is described as a powerful but dangerous essential motivator, being so compelling that it is prone to sometimes break outside the boundaries of loving relationships. 'Hear it on the radio' and 'read it in the papers' speaks of the potentially disruptive power of unleashed desire.\nReception\nBillboard wrote \"This up-tempo number has strong pop orchestration effectively pitted against Stewart's throaty vocals\" and that the song has a \"catchy\" hook.  Record World said that the song has \"menacing guitar runs,  percussion fever & [Stewart's] vocal parchment.\"\nPersonnel\n*Rod Stewart – lead and backing vocals\n*Jim Cregan – guitar\n*Gary Grainger – guitar\n*Phil Chen – bass\n*Kevin Savigar – keyboards, synthesizers\n*Carmine Appice – drums, Roland CR-78 programming\n*Paulinho da Costa – percussion\nChart performance\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1980–1981)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|Canada (RPM)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|South Africa (Springbok)\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|US Cash Box Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|US Record World\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|-\n|Zimbabwe (ZIMA)\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1980)\n!Position\n|-\n|Belgium (Ultratop Flanders)\n|align=\"center\"|88\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1981)\n!Position\n|-\n|Canada (RPM)\n|align=\"center\"|22\n|-\n|Italy (FIMI)\n|align=\"center\"|49\n|-\n|South Africa\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|38\n|-\n|US Cash Box\n|align=\"center\"|51\n|}\nPopular culture\n*\"Passion\" was prominently featured in the 1984 drama film New York Nights (later known as ''Shackin' Up'').\nReferences"
