World War II was a global war that was under way by 1939 and ended in 1945. On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany, which aimed to dominate Europe, attacked Belgium as part of their war with France. By 28 May 1940 the Belgian mainland had surrendered to German forces, although the colony of Belgian Congo remained independent throughout the war. Belgian power was not restored until final Axis collapse in late 1944. This list covers the equipment of the Belgian Army and the Force Publique of Belgian Congo, but not the Free Belgian Forces or Belgian mainland forces after October 1944, which was equipped completely by foreign forces.\nKnives and bayonets\n*Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife\nSmall arms\nPistols\n*Browning Hi-Power (Pistole Automatique Browning GP 35)\n*FN Model 1910\n*FN Model 1922\n*FN Model 1900\n*FN Model 1903\n*FN Model 1905\n*FN Baby Browning\n*Colt M1903 Pocket Hammerless\n*Ruby M1915\nRevolvers\n*Nagant M1895\n*MAS Modele 1892\n*Smith & Wesson No. 3\n*Webley Bulldog\n*Pieper M1893\nAutomatic pistols and submachine guns\n*MP 28 (Pieper Bayard mle 1934) 1.500-1.811\n*MP 18\n*STEN Mk II\nRifles\n*Mauser Model 1889 (often modernized to Model 1889/36 version)\n* Belgian Mauser Model 1935\n* Mauser Model 1893\n* Lebel M1886/93\n* Mauser Gewehr 98\n* Lee-Enfield\n* Mosin-Nagant M1891/30\n* Winchester M1894\n*Mauser K98AZ (Given in reparation payments to Belgium post WW1 and issued to reserve units)\nGrenades and grenade launchers\n* Mills bomb\nMachine guns\nInfantry and dual-purpose machine guns\n* Fusil-mitrailleur Mle 1930 Browning Belgian licensed version of the American BAR M1918A2\n* MG 08/15\n* Hotchkiss M1909\n* Chauchat M1915\n* Lewis\n* Browning M1919\nHeavy machine guns\n* Vickers\n* Maxim M1911\n* MG 08\n* Hotchkiss M1914\n* Colt-Browning M1895/14\nVehicle and aircraft machine guns\n* Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun\n* Fusil-mitrailleur 1930 (on T-13 and some T-15)\nArtillery\nInfantry mortars\n*\n* 70mm van Deuren mortar\n*Stokes mortar (81mm, also fortress version)\nHeavy mortars & rocket launchers\n*[http://www.passioncompassion1418.com/Canons/ImagesCanons/Belgique/Minen/FCDelattreStChamondMRABruxelles.html 142mm Delattre mortar] -
