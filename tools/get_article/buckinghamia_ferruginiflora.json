Although the tree's differences from its congener had been known since the 1970s, it was only formally described by Donald Foreman and Bernard Hyland in 1988 in the journal Muelleria.\nDescription\nThe species grows naturally up to about  in height. It has branchlets which are often hairy; leaves  long,  wide; buds, shoots and flower structures with dense ferruginous (rusty coloured) hairs. The flowers form compound inflorescences  long; individual flowers are creamy brown, with dense rusty hairs on the tepals' outer surfaces; the styles are shorter () than those of B. celsissima (). The fruit follicles are  long; the seeds flat with a small wing.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe species is restricted to the area between Bloomfield and the Daintree River, in mature lowland and upland rainforest, with an altitudinal range from sea level to 350&nbsp;m.\n}}"
