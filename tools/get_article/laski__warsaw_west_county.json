It is located at the southern border of the Kampinos Forest and is a notable resort, with 1,600 permanent inhabitants (1998).\nThe village is notable for its resort, hospital and schools for blind people run by Towarzystwo Opieki nad Ociemniałymi founded by countess Róża Czacka, and the Franciscan friars. In addition, a shelter for lone mothers run by Towarzystwo Pomocy im. Adama Chmielowskiego is located there. Near the blinded institute a wooden chapel is located (built in 1925), one of the most notable architectural monuments of the area.
