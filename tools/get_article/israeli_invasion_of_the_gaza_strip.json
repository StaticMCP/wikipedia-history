Starting on 7 October 2023, immediately after the Hamas-led attack on Israel, Israel began bombing the Gaza Strip. On 13 October, Israel began ground operations in the Gaza Strip, and on 27 October, a full-scale invasion was launched. Israel's campaign has four stated goals: to destroy Hamas, to free the hostages, to ensure Hamas no longer poses a threat to Israel, and to return displaced residents of Northern Israel. More than a year after the invasion, fighting in the Gaza Strip halted for two months with the implementation of a ceasefire on 19 January 2025. Another ceasefire went into effect in October 2025, as phase 1 of a multi-phase peace plan.\nBy April 2025, the Gaza Ministry of Health had reported that at least 50,500 people in the Gaza Strip had died—1 out of every 44 people—averaging 93 deaths per day. Most of the victims are civilians, of whom at least half are women and children. In October 2025, the Gaza Ministry of Health stated that more than 68,500 people have been killed since the war began. Compared to other recent global conflicts, the numbers of known deaths of journalists, humanitarian and health workers, and children are among the highest. Thousands of more dead bodies are thought to be under the rubble of destroyed buildings. A study in The Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths due to traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a larger potential death toll when \"indirect\" deaths are included. As of January 2025, a comparable estimate for traumatic injury deaths would be around 80,000. The number of injured is greater than 100,000; Gaza has the most child amputees per capita in the world. On 22 October 2025, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor released a report stating that in the Gaza strip \"more than 270,000 people, around 12 per cent of the population, have been killed, injured, or detained since 7 October 2023\".\nA severe humanitarian crisis has developed, with healthcare on the brink of collapse, shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel due to the blockade, electricity and communications blackouts, and the UN warning of potential famine. It was widely reported that there is \"no safe place in Gaza\", as Israel struck areas it had previously told Palestinians to evacuate to. Nearly all 2.3 million Gazans have been internally displaced and 250,000 to 500,000 Israelis were internally displaced, while Israel has detained thousands of Palestinians and said it lost 353 additional soldiers in its invasion as of 13 October 2024. By mid-December, Israel had dropped 29,000 munitions on Gaza, destroying or damaging 70 percent of homes, destroying hundreds of cultural landmarks, and damaging dozens of cemeteries. Experts say that the scale and pace of destruction in Gaza is among the most severe in recent history.\nThe widespread civilian deaths have led to accusations of war crimes against both Israel and Hamas. As a result of the invasion, South Africa instituted proceedings against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), charging that Israel was committing genocide and requesting that the ICJ render provisional measures of protection. Various experts and human rights organizations have also characterized the events in Gaza as genocide. Other accusations include the deliberate targeting of civilians and starving the population of Gaza by Israel, and the use of human shields and holding of Israeli hostages by Hamas.\nBackground\nAfter Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 which saw a minimum of 1,139 largely non-combatant individuals killed, Israel declared war against Hamas. Israel moved to mobilize 300,000 reservists and began to move armor close to the border with the Gaza Strip in the aftermath. Included in the amassing of armor were Namer armored personnel carriers and Merkava tanks.\nBefore the raids, Israel had told the UN that the more than a million people living in the north half of the Gaza Strip should evacuate within a 24-hour window. In response, Hamas instructed those residents to stay put. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had urged around 1.1&nbsp;million civilians to leave North Gaza so they would not be hurt or caught in crossfire, and Israeli officials said that the window was left at 24-hours to reduce the time for Hamas to conduct military preparation in the area. Aid groups said the time window was too short to evacuate one million people, and lack of electricity in Gaza made it difficult for electronic communications about the evacuation to reach Gazans. Israel dropped leaflets in Gaza City containing the evacuation order, in addition to electronic communications.\nOn 21 October 2023, the Israeli army dropped more leaflets in Gaza with the message: \"Urgent warning! To the residents of Gaza: your presence to the North of Wadi Gaza is putting your lives at risk. Anyone who chooses not to evacuate from the North of the Gaza Strip to the South of the Gaza Strip may be identified as a partner in a terrorist organization.\"\nRaids inside Gaza\nOn 13 October 2023, the IDF sent armored vehicles and infantry into the Gaza Strip, stating that their goals were to attack Hamas fighters and to rescue hostages that had been abducted to Gaza by Hamas. The operation, according to Israeli officials, was not part of a larger and widely anticipated ground invasion, but rather a raid in which troops only temporarily enter the Gaza Strip. The IDF confirmed the same day that Israeli remains were located and retrieved in the Gaza Strip.\nAnother raid, headed by the Givati Brigade and the 162nd Armoured Division, took place between 25 and 26 October and was the largest offensive so far, including tanks, other vehicles and IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers. A follow-up raid took place the next night in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City.\nOctober–November 2023: invasion begins\nOctober 2023\n27 October\nInternet and mobile phone services in Gaza were nearly cut off. On the evening of 27 October, the IDF launched a large-scale ground assault on the towns of Beit Hanoun and Bureij in the Gaza Strip. Shayetet 13, a commando unit of the Israeli Navy, carried out a strike on Hamas naval forces overnight. An Israeli Skylark II drone was shot down on the Gaza Strip.\n28 October\nIsrael said that the units deployed inside the Gaza Strip the previous night were still on the ground, which marked the beginning of the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. The IDF announced it was \"expanding ground operations\" in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military reissued a call to Gaza residents to evacuate the north as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the \"second phase of the war has begun\".\nThe IDF advanced on three fronts: from the northeast near Beit Hanoun, from the northwest near Beit Lahia, and from the east near Juhor ad-Dik.\n29 October\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), described as \"deeply concerning\" reports from the Palestine Red Crescent Society with smoke and dust, prompting staff to give breathing masks to some patients. Around 14,000 civilians were believed to be sheltering in or near the hospital. The al-Quds hospital had received an urgent evacuation warning along with a notice that it was \"going to be bombarded\". He reiterated that it was \"impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives\". Israeli airstrikes targeted the area around the hospital, filling parts of the building. Associated Press reported that Israeli airstrikes also destroyed roads leading to the Al-Shifa hospital, making it increasingly difficult to reach. Later in the day, Hamas said that Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli tanks in Salah al-Din Street in Gaza and forced the IDF to retreat. The Institute for the Study of War also said that Israel withdrew from the road.\n30 October\nThe IDF blocked the Salah al-Din Road, a major thoroughfare connecting the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip. Israeli tanks were also seen in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City. A local resident told AFP that the Israelis \"have cut the Salah al-Din road and are firing at any vehicle that tries to go along it.\" Witnesses reported, and a video showed, an Israeli tank firing on a taxi with a white flag on its roof that had attempted to turn around. An Israeli military spokesman said \"The IDF was not shown any proof that this is a civilian car and there's no information on who is inside.\" A kidnapped IDF private was freed the same day in an operation headed by the IDF, with assistance from Shin Bet and Mossad. In northwest Gaza, the Al-Qassam Brigades and the DFLP's National Resistance Brigades engaged Israeli forces, and the National Resistance Brigades bombarded Israeli vehicles with heavy mortar shells.\nNovember 2023\n1 November\nIDF reported the deaths of 16 soldiers, 15 inside Gaza and one outside of Palestinian territory.\nOn 2 November, IDF had completely surrounded Gaza City, which began the siege of Gaza City. Al-Qassam Brigades showed footage of the destruction of an Israeli Merkava tank after its fighters used an Al-Yassin 105mm rocket-propelled grenade to neutralize its Trophy protection system.\n4 November\nA UNRWA spokeswoman confirmed reports that Israel had conducted an airstrike against a United Nations-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, the attack killed 15 people and wounded dozens more. According to UNRWA, at least one strike hit the schoolyard, where displaced families had set up their tents. The Gaza Ministry of Health said another Israeli missile strike on the entrance to the Nasser Children's Hospital killed two women. According to White House officials, efforts to evacuate foreign nationals through the Rafah border crossing were temporarily hindered by Hamas's refusal to allow anyone to leave, until a certain number of its own wounded were also allowed to leave. Hamas said that within the last two days they had destroyed 24 Israeli vehicles, including a tank, an APC, and a bulldozer with anti-armour weapons.\nTurkey recalled its ambassador to Israel \"in view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians, and Israel's refusal (to accept) a ceasefire.\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters he held Netanyahu personally responsible for civilian deaths in Gaza and said that he was \"no longer someone we can talk to\".\nAbu Obaida, the spokesperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, reported that due to Israeli air strikes, the bodies of 23 missing Israeli hostages were buried under the rubble.\n5 November\nIDF reported that 29 soldiers had been killed, and one severely wounded, during the fighting in the Gaza Strip.\n6 November\nIsraeli missile attacks targeted the Nasser Medical Complex in Gaza City, hitting the Al-Nasser Children's Hospital, eight people were killed and dozens more were injured according to Al Jazeera. Human Rights Watch called for a weapons embargo against both Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, accusing them of committing war crimes against civilians.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Biden administration was planning to send $320&nbsp;million worth of \"Spice Family Gliding Bomb Assemblies\", a type of precision guided weapon fired by warplanes, to Israel. Under the deal, weapons manufacturer Rafael USA would send the bombs to its Israeli parent Rafael Advanced Defense Systems for use by the Israeli defense ministry.\n10 November\nNetanyahu said the IDF would control Gaza after the war and rejected proposals to establish an international force in the strip.\n11 November\nFour IDF soldiersa major, a sergeant major, and two master sergeantswere killed and other four were wounded after a tunnel exploded in their vicinity near Beit Hanoun. All casualties were from the 697th battalion of the 551st Reserve Brigade Arrows of Fire.\n13 November\nThe IDF published a video which they said showed that Hamas had a facility under Al-Rantisi Hospital, and that Israeli hostages were likely hidden there. The video showed, among others, a stash of weapons and explosives; what appears to be a motorbike with a bullet hole on its side; and water, ventilation and sewage infrastructure that the IDF said were improvised in preparation of coming hostages.\nAccording to The New York Times, the origins of the weapons shown in the video could not be independently verified.\nCharles Lister, Director of the Counterterrorism and Extremism Program at the Middle East Institute, said the IDF footage \"clearly indicated\" that the basement was a bomb shelter. Mohammed Zarqout, a local official responsible for Gaza's hospitals, said the basement was a shelter for women and children.\nThe IDF also presented a calendar that they said was found under the hospital marking the days since 7 October, with the title \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\". Israel said the calendar was a list \"where every terrorist writes his name\", but fluent Arabic speakers called this claim \"propaganda\", and that the words in Arabic only spelled out the days of the week.\n14 November\nThe New York Times published a report by its Visual Investigations team contradicting claims by the IDF that civilian deaths and damage at the al-Shifa Hospital had been caused by stray Palestinian projectiles. The report concluded instead, \"some of the munitions were likely fired by Israeli forces\", based on video and satellite evidence and an examination of weapons fragments collected and verified by The Times and analyzed by experts. Moreover, two of the most severe strikes analyzed by The Times hit upper floors of the maternity ward and did not appear to be aimed at underground infrastructure. \"Israel's assertion that Al-Shifa was actually hit by a Palestinian projectile echoed similar – and unresolved – claims and counterclaims following munitions that hit the courtyard of another Gaza hospital, Al-Ahli, nearly a month ago. The evidence reviewed by The Times from Al-Shifa points more directly to strikes by Israel – whether on purpose or by accident is unclear,\" the report said. The IDF has said that it is targeting Al Shifa Hospital due to its use by Hamas, and that there is a command center underneath the facility, with U.S. officials stating that their intelligence confirms Israel's conclusions that Hamas is operating out of hospitals in Gaza. A day earlier, the EU issued a joint declaration condemning Hamas for its use of hospitals and civilians as \"human shields\" in Gaza. A number of countries and international organizations condemned what they called Hamas' use of hospitals and civilians as human shields.\nIDF soldiers carried boxes into al-Shifa, labeled in English and Arabic as \"medical supplies\" and \"baby food\". In an interview with Al Jazeera, an emergency room employee said that Israel \"did not bring any aid or supplies\", while another contact within the hospital told the BBC that Israeli soldiers had supplied water to elderly patients. Several hours later, the IDF said it had found weapons in al-Shifa, indicating the presence of a command center. The IDF released a video that it said showed grenades, automatic weapons and flak jackets recovered from the hospital. John Kirby, a U.S. government official, said that the U.S. remained confident in its previous assessment that a Hamas military compound exists under the hospital.\nIn response, Mouin Rabbani, a Middle East analyst, said, \"Israeli forces have invaded Shifa Hospital and been inside it for 12 full hours – having refused any independent party to accompany them – and now we're supposed to believe that there were Hamas militants in there being pursued by the Israeli military but they somehow left their weapons behind?\" Political analyst Marwan Bishara said: \"It's kind of baffling. Why would Hamas leave the guns and not anything else?\" Jeremy Scahill said, \"I've seen more guns in the homes of ordinary Americans than in this purported Hamas Pentagon under al-Shifa Hospital.\"\nThe next day Israeli forces demolished the Hamas parliament building in Gaza City.\n16 November\nNetanyahu had said in an interview with CBS that the Israeli government had \"strong indications\" that hostages were in al-Shifa, which was one of the reasons they entered the hospital. It was reported that the body of Yehudit Weiss, a 65-year-old woman who was kidnapped from Be'eri kibbutz, was found in a building near the hospital.\nResidents in parts of southern Gaza reportedly received evacuation notices, sparking concerns over an expansion of the invasion. A fuel shortage was widely reported to have caused a shutdown of all internet and phone networks in the Gaza Strip, according to its two primary telecom providers Jawwal and Paltel.\n17 November\nInternet and telecom services were restored after Israel reportedly agreed to allow the delivery of 140,000 liters of fuel into the Gaza Strip every two days following a request by the U.S. to do so, consisting of 20,000 liters to be delivered to Jawwal and Paltel to maintain telecom and internet service and 120,000 liters for water desalination, sewage pumping, food production and hospitals. It was reported that the body of Noa Marciano, a 19-year-old soldier who was taken captive on 7 October, was found in a building near al-Shifa hospital.\n18 November\nIsraeli strikes killed more than 80 people in Jabalia refugee camp.\nA World Health Organization team visited the al-Shifa hospital amid reports that the Israeli army commander sent patients away with an Agence France-Presse journalist reportedly witnessing the departure of patients and displaced persons from the hospital.\nJordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi said that Arab troops would not go into Gaza to assume control after the war.\n19 November\nThe IDF released footage of an underground tunnel under al-Shifa. The tunnel, which is 160 meters long and 10 meters deep, passes directly under the Qatari building of the hospital; it has air-conditioned rooms, bathrooms, a kitchenette, electricity connections and communication infrastructure, and is protected by a blast door. The IDF also released CCTV footage that appears to show two of the hostages being led in the hospital's corridors, as well as Hamas and stolen IDF vehicles in its courtyard. During the 1980s, Israel expanded the hospital with functional basements for maintenance and administration purposes; and a network of tunnels was part of this construction. According to Israel, Hamas eventually appropriated the complex, then expanded it with its own system of tunnels and bunkers.\nMultiple sources concluded that evidence did not demonstrate the use of the tunnels by Hamas as a command center.\nA group of 31 premature babies were evacuated from al-Shifa hospital to southern Gaza.\nThe White House denied reporting from The Washington Post that a Qatari brokered five-day ceasefire deal had been reached. The deal would have included a five-day ceasefire in exchange for the stepwise release of female and child hostages in small groups. The U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"We have not reached a deal yet, but we continue to work hard to get to a deal\".\n20 November\nIDF tanks completely surrounded the Indonesia Hospital in Gaza after heavy fire using artillery weapons against it, around 12 Palestinians were killed in clashes around the hospital according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Around 700 people, including the injured and medical staff, were inside the facility when the IDF surrounded it. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) saying he was \"appalled\" by the Israeli forces and their actions against the Indonesia Hospital by keeping the injured and medical staff inside the building while besieging it.\nOn 20 November the IDF released video footage of what appears to be a weapons manufacturing facility hidden behind a false wall inside the basement of a mosque in Zeitoun, Gaza. IDF soldiers also discovered weapons, explosive devices, a drone, and a vertical tunnel shaft inside the building.\n21 November\nThe IDF moved its frontline to encircle the Jabaliya refugee camp where they are battling Palestinian militants and attempting to control with IDF forces getting more equipment for the attack.\n22 November\nIsrael and Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire agreement, providing for a four-day \"pause\" or \"lull\" in hostilities, to allow for the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza. The deal also provided for the release of approximately 150 Palestinian women and children incarcerated by Israel. The agreement was approved by the Israeli cabinet in the early hours of the day; in a statement, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office stated Israel's intention to continue the war.\nAccording to Hamas, in addition to the truce and prisoner exchange, the deal also involved Israel halting all air sorties over southern Gaza and maintaining a daily six-hour daytime no-fly window over northern Gaza, in addition to the entry of hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, medical and fuel supplies into the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government said that the truce would be extended by one day for every additional 10 hostages released by Hamas. The deal was brokered by Egypt and Qatar, and Egyptian state media announced the truce will enter into effect on the morning of 23 November. Qatari Foreign Affairs minister Mohamed Bin Mubarak Al-Khulaifi, whom Reuters referred to as \"Qatar's chief negotiator in ceasefire talks,\" stated his hope that the truce \"will be a seed to a bigger agreement and a permanent cease of fire...That's our intention.\"\nThe IDF released video footage from Sheikh Zayed, an area which is home to many senior members of Hamas. According to the IDF the footage shows a rocket launcher situated near a school, and an armament-laden truck used in the 7 October attack parked in the courtyard of a mosque.\nNovember–December 2023: ceasefire\n23 November\nThe IDF released footage showing a weapons cache hidden under a child's bed, which it said belonged to the child of a senior Hamas official.\n24 November\nHamas released 13 Israeli hostages, 10 Thai nationals, and one Filipino captive. Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners. The IDF also revised the number of hostages held in Gaza to 236.\n25 November\nHamas released 13 Israeli and four foreign hostages after a seven-hour delay from their agreed time. Hamas was accused of violating the deal after not having released a mother with her child.\n26 November\nHamas released 17 hostages, including 14 Israelis and three Thai nationals. Israel also released 39 teenage Palestinian prisoners.\n27 November\nQatar announced that an agreement between Israel and Hamas to extend the truce by two days had been reached.\n28 November\nBoth Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce. The IDF reported that several soldiers sustained minor injuries following an attack by Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip by three explosive devices that it said were detonated near its forces at two different locations, while Hamas said it had engaged Israel in a \"field clash\" that it said was instigated by Israel. Turkish media and Muhammad al-Hindi, Deputy Secretary-General of the PIJ, confirmed that Al-Quds Brigade soldiers held and released civilian women and children to the Red Cross.\n29 November\nHamas released 12 hostages, 10 of them Israeli and two of them Thai nationals. Afterwards, Israel released 30 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas continued to deny the International Committee of the Red Cross access to the remaining hostages.\n30 November\nHamas released two more hostages as the truce, which was supposed to end minutes later, was extended by another day. An Israeli Skylark II drone was reported shot down on central Gaza. The remains were recorded by Palestinian media.\nDecember 2023 – January 2025: invasion continues\nDecember 2023\n1 December\nThe IDF said on 18 November that it was expanding offensive operations toward Jabalia city in the northern Gaza Strip.\n2 December\nduring the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, November 2023]]\nPalestinian militants led by Saraya al Quds resisted the Israeli penetration into the northwestern front towards Jabalia, engaging soldiers in urban warfare throughout the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhoods. Al Qassam launched 3 loitering munitions to target Israeli forces throughout northern Gaza. They also targeted Israeli soldiers in Beit Hanoun, firing at groups, normally holed up in buildings with rockets. An IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozer was also targeted by Palestinian rockets at Juhor ad-Dik. PFLP militants targeted the Gaza envelope with rockets and mortar shelling.\n3 December\nIsraeli forces in Northern Gaza were subject to heavy attacks, led by Al-Qassam Brigades. In Sheikh Radwan, Israeli soldiers were trapped in a booby-trapped tunnel then shelled by Palestinian mortar fire. Three vehicles were targeted by Saraya al Quds with small arms and tandem-charged RPGs.\nThe next day, Israeli forces demolished the Palace of Justice in south Gaza City, a significant structure that housed the Palestinian Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the Court of First Instance, and the Magistrate.\n8 December\nKhan Yunis and Central Gaza axis\nIsraeli forces begun to enter Khan Yunis, reporting the most violent fighting in the entire war with the Israeli 7th Brigade engaged in a multi-hour complex attack on Palestinian militias.\nAl-Qassam brigades displayed a shift to more sophisticated battle tactics, including rigging houses to detonate when entered by Israeli soldiers. Primary relying on rockets, damage was inflicted on Israeli vehicles while Saraya al Quds, DFLP, and PFLP shelled advancing forces with mortar fire. The IDF conducted land and sea raids on central Gaza, specifically Deir al-Balah to destroy militant command posts.\nSiege of Gaza City\nIsraeli sources reported stiff resistance by Palestinian militants in Shujaiyya, in southern Gaza city, as the 188th Brigade was sent to fight in the neighbourhood.\nQassem Brigades targeted vehicles with RPGs Sheikh Radwan and Zaytoun, while Saraya al Quds militants claimed two tandem-charged RPG and grenade attacks on Israeli forces on advancing axes in the Shujaiya and Zaytoun neighborhoods. Attempts to close in on Jabalia have resulted in significant Israeli casualties, with the IDF acknowledging Gadi Eizenkot's son been eliminated fighting in the northern Gaza Strip on 7 December. The Qassam Brigades claimed that its militants killed the soldier when they detonated an IED on a tunnel door on the eastward line of advance into Jabalia.\nIn a video publicised by Saraya Al Quds, three militants take positions within the ruins of an urban centre in Gaza, as a Merkava arrives, firing at the militants with its machine guns. They then shoot from three positions with multiple rockets, overriding the Trophy system and destroying the tank. A fighter can be seen rejoicing, exclaiming that the tank had \"caught fire\"\n10 December\nThe Times of Israel announced that 6 IDF soldiers were killed in fighting in the southern Gaza strip, after Hamas militants detonated an IED targeting the Israeli 5th Brigade's 8111st Battalion forces in Khan Younis. Israeli forces announced that they conducted airstrikes and helicopter strikes in response and eliminated several Hamas militants.\n12 December\nIsrael announced that a further 10 IDF soldiers had been killed in the fighting in the Gaza Strip, including a Colonel and 7 other soldiers of the Golani Brigade, that were killed in the Shuja'iyya area of Gaza after Hamas militants ambushed them.\n15 December\nThe IDF released a statement announcing that they had killed three of their own hostages by friendly fire. According to the Israeli military, they \"mistakenly identified three Israeli hostages as a threat\" during operations in Shuja'iyya and subsequently fired at them, killing them. According to an Israeli military official on 16 December, the three hostages were shirtless and were carrying \"a stick with a white cloth on it\" when an Israeli soldier, who declared them to be \"terrorists\" after feeling \"threatened\", opened fire, killing two hostages and injuring the third, who was killed by Israeli reinforcements.\n18 December\nIsrael announced the deaths of 7 IDF soldiers, mostly killed in the fighting in the southern Gaza strip. Bringing the Israeli death toll to 53 since 1 December. The IDF said it was facing tough opposition in Gaza.\n24 December\nIsrael announced that 15 IDF soldiers had been killed in heavy fighting in Gaza in the 23–24 December period, including six killed when a Namer APC was hit by an anti-tank missile. The IDF also said it have killed Hamas' chief of supplies.\nIsrael also withdrew from Beit Hanoun amidst heavy fighting with various Palestinian armed groups. Returning civilians to the ruins of the town reported that no vehicles were in sight. Israeli forces continue to shell the city.\n30 December\nMilitants engaged Israeli vehicles in the Khan Yunis axis of the invasion. In an episode a tank is targeted by a rocket, tearing off a plate which lands near the militant demonstrating the capabilities of the Yassin 105 rockets against the Merkava's APS. Another fighter erupts from a tunnel, ambushing a tank in an unusual strategy recorded during the invasion where the militants sneak up to the vehicle and place and IED on them from zero distance. A Caterpillar Caterpillar D9 bulldozer is also targeted, setting it on fire.\nJanuary 2024\n6 January\nThe IDF said it had completed the dismantlement of Hamas's \"military framework\" in the northern Gaza Strip as it moved to attack Hamas forces in Central Gaza. The Institute for the Study of War warned that does not mean that Hamas forces are entirely eradicated and could reconstitute themselves.\n11 January\nThe IDF said it had discovered over a thousand tunnel shafts in Gaza City alone with the majority being small sized and thus easily destroyed but larger tunnels needing complex engineering and demolition operations. Israeli security officials conceded that they had an underestimated the scale of Gaza's tunnels and that they have destroyed less than half of them so far. IDF described the change in Hamas tactics in Northern Gaza after the dismantling of its command structure as going into \"guerrilla mode\".\n16 January\nThe ISW reported that the Palestinian militias were likely re-entering areas of the northern Gaza Strip where Israeli forces previously operated.\n17 January\nUnder U.S. pressure Israel continued withdrawing thousands of troops from Gaza despite concerns from Israeli officials of a possible surge in militant activity. According to IDF sources, Palestinian militants began launching rocket attacks from areas where IDF forces withdrew.\n18 January\nBy 18 January, the IDF said that Hamas had begun to rebuild its armies in the occupied parts of Northern Gaza.

On 19 March, the IDF announced the operation publicly, and partially recaptured the center of the Netzarim Corridor. The recapture of the corridor prevented Palestinians from moving between Gaza's northern and southern sections. On 20 March, Israeli forces resumed the Rafah offensive without warning the residents of Rafah.\nApril–May 2025: expansion to seize large areas\nOn April 2, Defense Minister Israel Katz announced a major expansion of Israel's offensive operation in the Gaza Strip, with the stated intention to seize \"large areas\" of Palestinian territory.

''Ha'aretz'' reported that \"within days, fewer than half the number of soldiers stationed in Gaza prior to the opening of hostilities with Iran are expected to remain.\" Subsequently, Israel said it now considered Iran Israel's primary war front and Gaza a secondary front.\nThe withdrawal of some forces from Gaza resulted in Hamas making gains in Gaza, re-establishing control over areas near the Zikim beach from the IDF due to reduced troop numbers.\nResumption of fighting in Gaza\nOn 19 June, Hamas repelled an Israeli incursion into the Zana region of Khan Yunis, and in an unusual interaction, a group of Hamas militants escorted an Israeli Namer APC as it withdrew from the area, taunting it with gunshots.\nOn 24 June, in Khan Younis, a Hamas militant behind Israeli front lines noticed an APC had its roof hatch open. Infiltrating the vicinity despite Israeli troop presence, the militant climbed atop the APC before lobbing an explosive device inside, killing all of its seven occupants.\nOn 7 July, five IDF soldiers were killed and another 14 wounded after an attack by Hamas operatives using roadside bombs in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza.\nOn 9 July, Hamas said its forces had attempted to capture an Israeli soldier, but due to \"battlefield conditions\", did not capture him and instead killed him.

This does not prevent government ministers from boasting of terms that are pleasing to the right ear, 'the IDF is occupying,' despite the distance between this statement and reality.\"\nIsraeli occupancy of Gaza City\nOn 8 August 2025, the Israeli security cabinet approved a plan to occupy Gaza City. The plan drew international condemnation from the UN, Germany, the EU president, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and China. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called it \"a disaster that will lead to many more disasters.\" Germany said it would suspend the approval of arms exports to Israel in response to the plan, and Norway said it would re-evaluate its sovereign wealth fund's investments in Israel.\nOn 13 August 2025, Israeli forces launched a massive aerial bombardment of Gaza City, with 123 people killed in all of Gaza, amid reports that the Israeli Army is about to enter the city.\nOn 20 August 2025, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz approved the takeover of Gaza City and named the operation \"Gideon's Chariots II\".\nCasualties\nCivilian casualties\nThe Gaza Strip has faced massive civilian casualties during the invasion. At least 31,000 Palestinians were reportedly killed between 27 October and 10 March, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Many were children; almost half of the people in Gaza are under 14 years old. In December 2023, UNICEF called Gaza \"the most dangerous place to be a child\".\nMost civilian deaths during the invasion were caused by airstrikes with many killed during the strikes on Jabalia, Fakhoora school, Maghazi. Civilians have also been killed by Israeli soldier fire or shelling by tanks, in both reported and verified incidents. Though the Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, civilian death rates have been estimated by outside sources. A study from the Open University of Israel found that at least 61% of the Palestinians killed were civilians, and noted that the civilian to combatant death ratio was higher than the average from all wars in the second half of the 20th century. Despite international skepticism, Israeli sources including IDF officials have deemed the Gaza health ministry's death toll accurate.\nA Doctors Without Borders video shared by Amnesty International head Agnès Callamard said, \"This brutal annihilation of an entire populations health system stretches beyond what humanitarian aid can fix.\" On 4 December, Red Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric Egger visited the Gaza Strip, stating, \"The things I saw there are beyond anything that anyone should be in a position to describe.\" On 10 December, Bushra Khalidi, an expert with Oxfam, said the situation was no longer \"just a catastrophe, it's apocalyptic.\"\nThe reported number of casualties from the Gaza Health Ministry have been deemed reliable by Israeli Intelligence, and has been supported by independent investigation of the reporting.\nEffects on children\nUNICEF spokesperson Toby Fricker said, \"There is no safe place for children anywhere across the strip right now.\" UNICEF: Children were disproportionately impacted by Israel's attack on Gaza. On 13 November, UNICEF said more than 700,000 children in Gaza were displaced. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said displaced children were suffering, due to power outages, lack of basic essentials, and \"scenes of pain and fear.\" The executive director of UNICEF, toured Gaza on 15 November, stating many children were buried under rubble and lacking medical care. The head of pediatrics at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, said that due to lack of clean water, he was witnessing the \"most serious epidemic of gastroenteritis\" among children he had ever seen.\nMilitary casualties\nIsraeli\nThe Israeli Army suffered heavy casualties during the invasion. By 16 June 2025, 431 soldiers had been killed and more than 2,668 were injured, per Israel. Among the deaths, 29 were due to friendly fire incidents and accidents. In a single episode in November 2023, the destruction of an armoured personnel carrier with anti-tank missiles killed nine soldiers. On 12 December, 10 IDF soldiers were killed in an ambush at Shuja'iyya. The bloodiest day so far was 22 January 2024, when 24 IDF soldiers were killed after an attack on a tank rigged with explosives. The casualties surpass those of previous IDF invasions of the Gaza Strip, such as Operation Protective Edge and Operation Cast Lead, in which 67 and 6 people were killed, respectively.\nOn 4 August 2024, Yedioth Ahronoth reported that at least 10,000 Israeli soldiers had been killed or wounded while fighting in Gaza and that about 1,000 more are physically or mentally wounded every month. in March 2025, former IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon said the total number of killed and wounded soldiers was 15,000.\nAt least five Israeli soldiers were killed in battle in Israeli territory after the Gaza invasion, four in a rocket attack on 5 May 2024 and one during an infiltration into south Israel by Hamas militants on 6 June. The Qassam brigades also captured an Israeli soldier stationed at Juhor ad-Dik, but he was likely killed during the operation.\nPalestinian\nOn 13 January 2024, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor estimated that since the beginning of the war, over 2,500 Palestinians killed had been combatants, of whom 1,542 died during the Israeli invasion.\nOn 21 January 2024, U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal that the IDF eliminated 20 to 30% of Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. But that was short for their aim of eliminating the group. According to IDF reports, 9,000 Hamas militants were killed, 8,000 more were wounded and unable to return to battle, and another 2,300 were arrested, removing 48–60% of Hamas's forces from the battlefield. But it also noted that the rate of Hamas deaths was falling as Hamas reduced head-on assaults against the IDF and became more reliant on underground tunnels.\nIn advance of ground operations on 7 October, Israel assassinated Hamas commanders throughout Gaza, including Ali Al Qadi and Ayman Nofal.\nDuring the invasion of the Gaza strip, Palestinians fighting against the Israeli occupation damaged or destroyed a large number of Israeli tanks, causing a shortage of both tanks and ammunition for the IDF.\nOn 22 October 2025, he Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor released a report stating that in the Gaza strip \"more than 270,000 people, around 12 per cent of the population, have been killed, injured, or detained since 7 October 2023\".\nStrategy\nIsraeli strategy\nbefore invasion of the Gaza Strip]]\nOn 29 October, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant said he expected the \"second stage of the war\" to last \"months\". Subsequent phases are expected to be the removal of small pockets of resistance, and, finally, withdrawal from Gaza.\nEven after Israeli troops entered the Gaza Strip and began to maintain a persistent physical presence in the region beginning on 27 October, Israel's military had adopted a strategy of referring to the invasion as \"operations\" and \"raids\" rather than an \"invasion\". According to the Associated Press, this communications strategy was undertaken to preserve operational flexibility and to keep hostile forces guessing as to Israel's military plans. The United States has urged Israel to avoid a full-scale invasion and to instead conduct \"surgical\" operations to avoid casualties and a regional escalation. Israeli military sources said there were over 20,000 IDF troops in Gaza as of 31 October.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will have overall security responsibility over the Gaza Strip for an indefinite period following the war. European Commission president Von der Leyen said there should be no long-term Israeli security presence in Gaza, and suggested a UN mandated peace force as a possibility; while U.S. President Joe Biden said, \"When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution.\" On 11 November, Netanyahu widened the split with the U.S. over postwar governance, saying that he was against the Palestinian Authority having a role there.\nOn 12 November 2023, Israeli security cabinet member Avi Dichter described Israeli strategy in northern Gaza as \"Nakba 2023\".\nWhen the IDF initiated Operation Gideon's Chariots under the leadership of the newly appointed Chief of Staff, Eyal Zamir. It marked a phase during which, the systematic destruction of infrastructure became an explicit component of official military policy and was implemented with increased intensity. Notably, private contractors have been engaged in the operation.\nHamas strategy\nThe military strategies employed by Hamas have historically encompassed a blend of conventional and insurgent tactics. As a result of the war, the group has shifted \"back into a guerrilla fighting force\", employing the use of hit-and-run operations and operating in smaller cells of fighters, aiming to demonstrate that they are capable of continuing to fight a prolonged war. Hamas's strategy also relies on the underground tunnel system, which can be used as shelter for Hamas militants and leaders, storing weapons, and detaining hostages.\nSources close to Hamas leadership said that they counted on the international pressure for Israel to end the siege due to mounting civilian casualties and achieve a ceasefire. According to Eliot A. Cohen, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, Hamas's theory of victory is that its attacks, together with strikes by Hezbollah and Iran and the uprising in the West Bank  will cause Israel to collapse. Cohen said that \"[i]n Hamas’s view, Israeli counterattacks on Gaza, which will inevitably kill many civilians, contribute to its objectives because they undermine support for Israel abroad.\" John Spencer of the Modern War Institute at West Point said that Hamas strategy is based on gaining time for international pressure on Israel to stop its operations.\nAllegations of using civilians as human shields\nSome, including Israel, have accused Hamas of deliberately using Palestinian civilians as human shields. Such claims have been disputed.\nOne reason Hamas militants allegedly use civilians as human shields is to \"shield\" military targets from Israeli attacks. But Ben Burgis argues that Israel is obviously \"more than willing to bomb civilian targets\", making it unlikely Hamas would see much point in using human shields.\nIn February 2024, Forensic Architecture (FA) examined the evidence that Israel provided at the ICJ regarding Hamas's alleged use of civilian facilities for military use. FA said that much of the Israeli evidence was misleading or false.\nCharges of war crimes\nDuring the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, numerous viral videos showed Israeli soldiers committing war crimes. A series of videos in mid-December 2023 showed IDF troops burning food, vandalizing a shop, and ransacking private homes. The Euro-Med Monitor recorded instances where soldiers deliberately stole civilians' assets, including laptops, gold, and large quantities of cash. Euro-Med Monitor also reported on soldiers recorded harassing corpses, dragging them, urinating on them, and amputating them. In a social media post, the Council on American–Islamic Relations condemned a video of an Israeli soldier stating, \"Maybe I killed a girl, she was 12, but I'm looking for a baby.\" On 2 January 2024, Palestinian diplomat Laith Arafeh condemned reports that Israeli soldiers kidnapped a baby from Gaza. On 24 February, a video went viral of an IDF soldier setting a residential neighborhood on fire while saying, \"A little BBQ is great fun\".\nOn 11 February, the Saudi Foreign Ministry stated Israel's planned invasion of Rafah was part of a \"continued violation of international law and international humanitarian law\".\nICJ genocide case\nDuring the invasion of the Gaza Strip, South Africa argued that Israel was guilty of committing a genocide in Gaza and instituted proceedings against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). South Africa's submission placed the charges in the broader context of Israel's conduct towards Palestinians, including claims of 75 years of apartheid, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the 16-year blockade of the Gaza Strip. South Africa requested that the ICJ render provisional measures of protection.\nDestruction and plundering\nBy early 2024, Israeli forces had destroyed more than half of Gaza's houses, at least a third of its tree cover and farmland, most of its schools, all 12 of its universities, hundreds of cultural landmarks, and dozens of cemeteries.\nCultural heritage\nIsraeli attacks in the Gaza Strip Over have destroyed or damaged 100 landmarks, according to a report by Heritage for Peace. The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which both Palestinians and Israelis agreed to, protects sites of cultural heritage. According to the Israeli NGO Emek Shaveh, hundreds of ancient sites, historic monuments, museums and archives have been damaged or destroyed since the war started. Of the 325 registered archeological and ancient sites, 200 were destroyed by the Israeli army by January 2024, according to the Gaza Government Media office, along with an estimated 90 million shekels ($24.5 million), gold, and artifacts stolen by IDF soldiers.\nThe Great Mosque of Gaza was left with only the minaret standing. Sites that have been damaged or destroyed include Rafah Museum, Al Qarara Cultural Museum, Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, Hamam al-Sammara, and Tell el-Ajjul. The Church of Saint Porphyrius, the world's third-oldest church, was damaged in an airstrike, as was the Saint Hilarion Monastery. The Byzantine Church of Jabalia, dating from the 5th century and restored in 2022, was destroyed. The destruction of Gaza City's public library and central archives have been compared to the 1992 attacks on the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All universities in the Gaza Strip were bombed by Israeli forces, including the destruction of Al-Israa University and its museum containing several thousand rare artifacts.\nIt was reported in January 2024 that Israel Antiquities Authority Director Eli Askozido had shared photos on his official Instagram account of reportedly stolen artifacts from Gaza that had been stored in a warehouse. The post was later deleted and Askozido posted a statement claiming his department had been called in only to document the items, and that they had not been brought to Israel.\nHomes\nBy 7 December 2023, more than one third of homes in Gaza were destroyed by Israel, leading to charges of domicide, referring to the mass destruction of dwellings. Although the term is accepted in academia, it is yet to be defined in international law. Videos posted by IDF soldiers to social media have shown them breaking into Palestinian homes that had been evacuated or destroyed and looting valuables and or daily items. The Euro Med Human Rights Monitor has reported widespread looting by IDF troops in where they stole assets and money from Palestinian citizens, including items like computers and jewelry. According to a legal researcher at the Ramallah-based human rights organization Al-Haq, Israeli authorities have justified the looting as that the items and money are somehow belongs to Hamas, while others have claimed it shows intentional destruction of property and collective punishment.\nCommunications\nDirect Israeli attacks on telecommunications infrastructure, electricity blockades, and fuel shortages have caused the near-total collapse of Gaza's largest cell network providers. Lack of internet access has prevented Gazan citizens from communicating with loved ones, learning of IDF operations, and identifying areas most exposed to bombing and possible escape routes. The blackouts have also impeded emergency services, making it more difficult to find and access the injured, and have impeded humanitarian aid agencies and journalists. By December 2023, 200,000 Gazans (about 10% of the population) had received internet access through an eSIM provided by Connecting Humanity.\nDesecration of cemeteries\nOn 14 December 2023, The New York Times reported that Israeli forces had damaged or destroyed at least six cemeteries in Gaza, and on 20 January 2024, CNN reported that Israeli forces had desecrated at least 16 cemeteries, turning some into military outposts. Forensic Architecture reported on 19 December 2023 that Israel had destroyed one of Gaza's most important archaeological sites, near al-Shati refugee camp.\nAbuse and humiliation of detainees\nVideo evidence surfaced of what Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor called a \"flagrant violation of international laws related to the protection of civilians\". Israeli soldiers were shown dragging and assaulting detainees in Yatta, Hebron. Many of the detainees had been stripped naked, had both their arms and feet bound, been beaten with the butts of rifles, and trampled. Additional video evidence depicts Israeli soldiers transporting Palestinians from Ofer prison, all of whom are blindfolded and stripped naked. In another video an Israeli soldier uploaded, a blindfolded and bound Palestinian is shown kneeling on the ground. The soldier taunts him in Arabic, telling him \"صباح الخير يا قحبة\" (Good morning, whore) before repeatedly kicking and spitting on him. On 11 December, Human Rights Watch director Omar Shakir said the blindfolding and stripping of Palestinian detainees represented a war crime.\nOn 20 December 2023, Amnesty International called for an investigation into mass detentions, disappearances, inhumane treatment, and detainee deaths. In February 2024, the BBC published a report detailing documented instances of Israeli soldiers abusing and humiliating Palestinian detainees, which Mark Ellis, an expert on international criminal tribunals, said showed possible violations of laws regarding prisoners of war. After the IDF dismissed one of the reservists shown in the video, Sir Geoffrey Nice, an expert on war crimes, said a wider investigation was needed. In March 2024, the United Nations said that Israel had detained and tortured its employees in Gaza, extracting forced confessions. A Bellingcat analysis found instances of a collection of images and videos showing the IDF degrading Palestinian detainees, which Queen’s University Belfast war crimes professor Luke Moffett said showed potential war crimes. CNN reported that an Israeli military base in the Negev desert functions as a detention center for Palestinians. In July 2024, Amnesty International said Israel should end the indefinite detention of Palestinian prisoners without trial, calling it a \"flagrant violation of international law\".\nSexual violence\nOn 19 February 2024, a report co-authored by Francesca Albanese and Reem Alsalem, United Nations special rapporteurs, urged an inquiry into allegations of serious human rights violations against Palestinian women and girls in Gaza and the West Bank by Israeli forces. The allegations involve rape and sexual violence. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a press release on 19 February, citing those claims and referring to photos allegedly taken by Israeli troops showing female detainees in degrading circumstances posted online. In an interview, Alsalem said the allegations were based on \"reasonably credible information\" and cited Euro-Med Monitor as their source.\nThe report said: \"Palestinian women and girls in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped\". In response, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State said, \"Civilians and detainees must be treated humanely, and in accordance with international humanitarian law.\" Physicians for Human Rights-Israel also described the sexual humiliation of detainees, including sexual insults and urination on prisoners. The Palestinian Prisoner's Society said men had been subjected to severe sexual assault, including attempted rape and violating strip searches.\nA June 2024 The New York Times investigation detailed allegations that Israeli interrogators in the Sde Teiman detention camp had inserted hot metal sticks into detainees' anuses. One detainee reportedly died from the resultant injuries. An April 2024 Haaretz investigation found that prisoners in Ktzi'ot Prison were routinely stripped, humiliated, and deliberately struck in the testicles while undergoing naked checks with a metal detector. In August 2024, video emerged from the same detention camp depicting the gang rape of a prisoner. At the same time, Ibrahim Salem, who appeared in one of the first leaked photos from Sde Teiman, was released after being held there for 52 days without charge. He reported widespread torture, including by medical staff, as well as electrocution during interrogations, sexual abuse, constant beatings, forced stripping, genital grabbing, and frequent rapes committed by both male and female soldiers. Children were also raped. In one instance, a prisoner in his 40s was handcuffed and forced to bend over a desk while a female soldier inserted her fingers and other objects into his rectum. If the prisoner moved, a male soldier in front of him beat him and compelled him to remain in place. According to Salem, \"Most of the prisoners will come out with rectal injuries [caused by the sexual assault].\" In an interview with CNN, Salem said that Palestinians are transported \"like animals\" to Israeli prisons on trucks, and described being hit in the genitals with metal detectors and raped with a baton. He said: \"You’re exposing your body to male and female soldiers who harass you and touch you with objects on your sensitive parts. They hit you on your butt, pull you by the hair, call you obscenities\".\nReem Alsalem, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, criticized the underreporting of sexual violence against Palestinians, saying: \"Rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide! It must stop!\"\nSave the Children reported receiving credible reports of sexual violence from children who had been detained by the IDF. The UN also related similar reports, calling it unacceptable.\nReactions\nIran\nAccording to Al Jazeera English, on 15 October, \"Iran warned Israel of regional escalation if the Israeli military [entered] Gaza for a ground invasion\". Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said that if efforts to stop Israeli attacks in Gaza failed, it was increasingly likely that \"other fronts [would] be opened\".\nUnited Kingdom\nOn 20 May 2025, the United Kingdom suspended free trade negotiations due to the Israeli military expansion in Gaza; Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the suspension in the House of Commons, saying that the events in Gaza were damaging Britain’s relations with Israel.\nUnited States\nIn an interview aired on 15 October, U.S. President Joe Biden said it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again but that eliminating Hezbollah in the north and Hamas in the south is \"a necessary requirement\". U.S. officials said the Biden administration advised Israel to delay the ground invasion of Gaza to allow more time for hostage negotiations.\nFormer CIA director David Petraeus warned that a ground offensive in Gaza \"could be Mogadishu on steroids very quickly.\"\nEgypt\nOn 25 October, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi warned that a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip would cause \"many, many civilian casualties\". On 6 February, the Egyptian government expressed fears that an Israeli ground invasion of Rafah could push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to try to flee across the border into Egypt.\nSaudi Arabia\nOn 27 October, Saudi officials strongly cautioned the United States that an Israeli ground operation in Gaza could have devastating consequences for the Middle East.\nIsraeli public\nOn 19 October, a poll by the Israeli newspaper Maariv found that 65% of Israelis supported a ground invasion and 21% opposed it. In comparison, according to a poll conducted for Israel's Maariv newspaper on 25 and 26 October, only 29% of Israelis supported an immediate large-scale ground offensive into the Gaza Strip. Maariv said that \"It is almost certain that the developments on the matter of the hostages, which is now topping the agenda, have had a great impact on this shift.\" According to a survey carried out by the Hebrew University on 7–9 December on the post-war handling of Gaza 56% of Israelis opposed the annexation of Gaza with only 33% in favor while 11% were uncertain. When questioned on who should administer Gaza in the immediate post-war period 23% of Israelis supported a coalition of moderate Arab states, 22% for Israeli military rule, 18% for an international force take charge of the territory, 18% for Israel annexing Gaza and 11% support for the return of the Palestinian Authority. (see also Proposed Israeli resettlement of the Gaza Strip)\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, that represents the families of kidnapped Israelis, complained that no one had explained \"whether the ground operation endangers the well-being of the 229 hostages\". MK Ahmad Tibi said Israel's invasion of Rafah would be a war crime.\nPalestinians\nPalestinians in Gaza reacted most strongly to the violence they experienced at the hands of IDF soldiers during the invasion, with one man whose brother was killed by an Israel sniper stating, \"This is not an occupation. This is an enemy who kills without a reason.\" One woman who had evacuated from northern to central then southern Gaza said, \"Let the Israelis kill us all; let them ethnically cleanse what remains of the Palestinians.\" Another woman who had remained in Gaza City and was sheltering at al-Shifa Hospital, said in February 2024, \"Our houses were destroyed. Our children were killed. Where should we go? The shooting must stop so we can find a place to live.\"\nOn 6 February, West Bank politician Mustafa Barghouti said, \"Any military operations in Rafah – with its limited space and crowdedness with over 1.5 million Palestinians displaced by the Israeli army – would lead to brutal massacres unprecedented in modern history.\" Palestinians in Rafah feared a permanent displacement like 1948. On 10 February, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the impending Israeli invasion of Rafah would create \"another Nakba, which will push the whole region into endless wars\". Hanan Ashrawi said, \"We are in the midst of a genocide\" in Gaza.\nInternational organizations\nIn advance of an expected ground invasion of Rafah, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, \"Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences.\" The UN General Assembly President Dennis Francis said, \"I am shocked and deeply dismayed by the news of an Israeli military offensive into the south of the Gaza Strip. I join the Secretary-General in pleading on behalf of the multitudes of innocent civilians with nowhere safe to go\".\nSave the Children asked: \"Where is there left for the population to go? They have been already moved from the north of Gaza, from the central areas of Gaza – moved around like pieces on a chess board to achieve military objectives. There is nowhere left for them to move.\" The Norwegian Refugee Council said, \"An expansion of hostilities could turn Rafah into a zone of bloodshed and destruction that people won't be able to escape. There is nowhere left for people to flee to.\" Omar Shakir, the Human Rights Watch director for Israel and Palestine said, \"There's nowhere safe to go in Gaza. The ICJ has ordered Israel to prevent genocide. The [international] community should act to prevent further atrocities.\"\nAl Mezan Center said, \"The international community must act now to halt the ground invasion of Rafah.\" The Carter Center said, \"Ordering this new wave of displacement of Palestinians will further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis\". Catherine M. Russell, the president of UNICEF, said, \"Some 1.3M civilians are pushed into a corner, living on streets or shelters. They must be protected. They have nowhere safe to go\".\nSee also\n* List of invasions in the 21st century\n* List of military engagements during the Gaza war\n* Outline of the Gaza war\n* Population statistics for Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip\n* Timeline of the Gaza war\n* United States support for Israel in the Gaza war\nNotes\nReferences"
