His boss told reporters that his capture was due to false denunciations from a jealous rival, whose sons worked as interpreters for the Americans, and that he had tried to tell the Americans he should be set free—without success.\nWrit of habeas corpus\nKhan had a writ of habeas corpus, Swat Khan v. Bush, filed on his behalf in Maryland in 2005.\nHe was represented by James Wyda and Martin Bahl, Federal Public Defenders in Maryland.\nRepatriation\nKhan was transferred to Afghanistan on October 11, 2006.\nMcClatchy interview\nOn June 15, 2008, the McClatchy News Service published articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo detainees. Khan was one of the interviewees.\nTom Lasseter, the lead McClatchy reporter, wrote that while his Tribunal President ruled that even though he had offered their phone numbers the witnesses he requested were not 'reasonably available' but McClatchy reporters \"had little trouble\" phoning one of them, his boss Mohammed Mustafa, at the Afghan Interior Ministry. Mustafa confirmed that Khan had been falsely denounced by a rival in the Afghan security services.\nKhan spoke about being beaten in Bagram, and being hung from the ceiling by his wrists in an isolation cell.\nKhan described attempting suicide twice in Guantanamo. Following his repatriation, the Governor of his province offered him another position as a police officer, but he declined.\nSee also\n* Bagram torture and prisoner abuse\n* Guantanamo Bay detention camp suicide attempts\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/the-guantanamo-files-website-extras-12-the-last-of-the-afghans-part-two/ The Guantánamo Files: Website Extras (12) – The Last of the Afghans (Part Two)] Andy Worthington"
