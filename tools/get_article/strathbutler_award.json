It was first awarded in 1991 as an annual prize of $10,000, which increased to $15,000 in 2005. In 2011 it became a biennial award with a value of $25,000, the highest for any visual art prize in New Brunswick.\nThe Strathbutler is awarded by the Sheila Hugh Mackay Foundation, which was founded in 1987 by the New Brunswick philanthropist in order to promote the visual arts and fine crafts. A native of Saint John, Mackay lived from the mid 1980s in a cottage on her family's Rothesay estate, which was called Strathnaver. The cottage having been previously occupied by a man named Butler, she called her house Strathbutler, and later gave the name to her foundation's first art prize.\nThe Strathbutler Award recipients are chosen by jury. Once informed of the jury's choice, Mackay personally called the winners to congratulate them, and presented them with their awards, accompanied by a poem of her own composition, at a gala. Mackay died in 2004.\nSince 2015 award recipients have received an \"iconic presentation piece\" in the form of a sterling silver and copper knife designed by 2006 Strathbutler laureate Brigitte Clavette. The design is based on the Mackay family crest and named Manu forti (with a strong hand), after the family's motto.\nRecipients\n*1991 John Hooper\n*1992 Tom Smith\n*1993 Peter Powning\n*1994 Kathy Hooper\n*1995 Nel Oudemans\n*1996 :fr:Marie Hélène Allain\n*1997 Freeman Patterson\n*1998 :fr:Roméo Savoie\n*1999 Suzanne Hill\n*2000 Rick Burns\n*2001 Gerard Collins\n*2002 Gordon Dunphy\n*2003 Thaddeus Holownia\n*2004 Janice Wright Cheney\n*2005 André Lapointe\n*2006 Brigitte Clavette\n*2007 Dan Steeves\n*2008 Anna Torma\n*2009 David Umholtz\n*2010 Linda Rae Dornan\n*2011 Herzl Kashetsky\n*2013 Susan Vida Judah\n*2015 Paul Mathieson\n*2017 Herménégilde Chiasson\n*2019 Bruce Gray\n*2021 Mathieu Léger\n*2023 John Murchie\nReferences"
