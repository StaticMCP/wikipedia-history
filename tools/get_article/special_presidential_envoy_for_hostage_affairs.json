      "text": "# Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs\n\nThe special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, or more formally the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, was established in 2015, by an executive order pertaining to the recovery of U.S. hostages held by non-state actors and of U.S. citizens wrongfully detained by foreign states. The Special Presidential Envoy leads and coordinates activities across the Executive Branch to bring home those Americans. The position was created in 2015 during the Obama administration.\nIn February 2020, President Trump announced his intention to appoint Roger D. Carstens as the next special presidential envoy.\nIn January of 2021, incoming President Joseph R. Biden and incoming Secretary of State Antony Blinken requested that Roger Carstens stay on into the Biden administration.\nDuring Trump's second presidential transition, he nominated Adam Boehler to that position, but he withdrew after it was leaked that he met Hamas representatives in Qatar.\nList of special presidential envoys\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Officeholder\n!Term start\n!Term end\n!Tenure length\n!President\n|-\n|1\n|Jim O'Brien\n|August 28, 2015\n|January 20, 2017\n|\n|Barack Obama\n|-\n|2\n|Robert C.
