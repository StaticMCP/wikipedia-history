In addition, the music video was released on the VHS music video compilation Digital Hardcore Videos. One of the videos was a collection of live footage of the band spliced with the song, while the other showcased an office filled with workers being transformed into a faceless, insane violence mob that attacks each other while the band tortures, on video sent to the office manager, a random faceless office worker. In the end, the office workers manifest the TV monitor screens similar to the Teletubbies on their stomachs and are sent to be \"reeducated\" by their employer. This video aired on MTV for several months before being pulled due to concerns over the violence featured in it.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Alec Empire – production, writing, performance\n*Carl Crack – performance\n*Hanin Elias – writing, performance\n*Nic Endo – performance\n*Steve Rooke – mastering\n*Andy Wallace – mixing on \"Revolution Action\"\n*Dave Sardy – mixing on \"No Success (Digital Hardcore Remix)\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discogs.com/release/120935 CD entry at discogs.com]\n*[http://www.discogs.com/release/36538 12\" vinyl entry at discogs.com]\n*[http://www.discogs.com/release/319576 cassette entry at discogs.com]"
