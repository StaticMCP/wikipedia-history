Of the 105 original Gatchaman episodes, 85 were used in the Battle of the Planets adaptation, produced by Sandy Frank Entertainment. The adaptation was generally faithful to the plot and character development of the original Gatchaman series, but significant additions and reductions were made in order to increase appeal to the North American television market of the late 1970s, as well as avoid controversy from parents; these included the removal of elements of graphic violence and profanity.\nIt was the most successful anime series in the United States during the 1970s, airing on 100 network affiliates during after-school hours by 1979. As of June 2013, Sentai Filmworks have licensed the Gatchaman franchise. An oft-delayed CGI film based on the franchise, Gatchaman, last slated for a 2011 release from Warner Bros., was officially canceled in June 2011. However, a live-action Gatchaman feature film was released in Japan in August 2013. As of 2018, the series has been made available for streaming on Hidive.\nHistory\nIn April 1977, TV producer Sandy Frank attended the MIP-TV conference in Cannes. It was here Frank first encountered the Japanese animation Gatchaman from producer Tatsunoko Production run by the Yoshida brothers. Frank committed to a Western release after seeing how successful the film Star Wars was in May 1977.\nBattle of the Planets is the title of the American adaptation of this series created by Frank. New footage was authorized and Frank hired writers to add dialogue to fit the look of the animation, without reference to original scripts. Of the 105 original Gatchaman episodes, the adaptation used 85.\nPlot\nBattle of the Planets cast five young people as G-Force, consisting of Mark, Jason, Princess, Keyop, and Tiny. G-Force protects Earth from the planet Spectra and other attacks from beyond space. The most prominent field commander of the Spectra forces was a villainous, masked individual known as Zoltar. Zoltar would receive his orders directly from a being he would refer to as the \"Luminous One.\" The Luminous One would appear as a ghost-like, disembodied, floating head. While the Luminous One's origins were not explained on the show, it is clear he is the ruler of Spectra and its invading armies.\nThe main ship of the G-Force team was called the Phoenix, which could carry, transport, and deploy four smaller vehicles, each operated by one team member. The four vehicles included a futuristic race car with various hidden weapons driven by Jason; this vehicle was concealed within the Phoenix's nosecone. The \"galacti-cycle,\" a futuristic motorcycle Princess rode, was stored within the left-wing capsule of the Phoenix. Keyop's \"Space Bubble,\" an all-terrain, tank-like vehicle capable of VTOL as well as being a submersible craft, was held in the right storage capsule of the Phoenix. And lastly, a futuristic jet fighter Mark pilots was stored in the top rear section of the Phoenix command island structure, and which used its tail fin to make up the center tail fin of the Phoenix. The fifth crew member, Tiny, was assigned to pilot the Phoenix rather than one of the detachable craft.\nA regularly featured plot device was the transformation of the Phoenix into a flaming bird-shaped craft able to handle virtually any exceptional situation for a brief period by essentially turning itself into pure energy called the Fiery Phoenix. The Phoenix primary weapon was a supply of rockets called \"TBX missiles\" in the series. It also occasionally flaunted a powerful solar-powered energy blaster, although the team had the misfortune of choosing very cloudy days to use it.\nThe G-Force team themselves would use a combination of martial arts skills, ninja-like weapons, and their \"cerebonic\" powers to dispatch hordes of enemy soldiers and overcome other obstacles. Their bird-like costumes include wing-like capes that could fan out and function nearly identically to parachutes and/or wingsuits, enabling the G-Force members to drift or glide down to safety from heights that would otherwise prove fatal.\nThe G-Force members stay in contact through a wrist-band communicator device which also serves as a way for them to change or \"transmute\" instantly from their civilian clothes into their G-Force uniforms, and back again. Other weapons seen displayed by various team members include Mark's sonic boomerang, a bird-shaped boomerang with razor-sharp wings; Jason's and Tiny's multi-purpose gadget guns, which can be outfitted with grappling hook and line, drill bits, etc.; and Keyop's and Princess's yo-yo bombs, which could be used as bolas, darts, and explosive devices. Other weapons include feathers with a sharpened steel quill that could be used as deadly throwing darts and mini-grenades shaped like ball bearings with spike studs.\nKey changes in the adaptation\nThe Battle of the Planets adaptation differs significantly from Gatchaman. The difference is due to heavy editing made to make the show appealing to the audience in the United States by removing controversial elements (i.e. graphic violence, profanity, and a gender changing mutant) while adding elements reminiscent of the feature film Star Wars, which was popular at the time. In fact, the name \"Battle of the Planets\" was an attempt to associate itself with the popularity of Star Wars. While the original Gatchaman was earthbound, dark-toned, and environmentally themed, the adaptation morphed it into a less violent outer space show with robot characters, although some environmental themes were kept, and this is also why the other planets to which G-Force traveled on missions looked very much like Earth. Setting, violence, objectionable language, and certain character fatalities were altered or eliminated by cutting scenes, dubbing, and explanatory voice-overs (for instance, claiming that the city had been evacuated before a battle scene that would show the incidental destruction of buildings and houses, as well as explaining away the destruction of the Earth armies and air forces as being robot tanks and fighter planes).\nOne of the most notable changes in the BotP adaptation involves the character Keyop (Jinpei in Gatchaman), who picked up a bizarre verbal tic of stuttering, chirping, and burbling every time he started to speak. There was a longstanding fan rumor that this was done because the original character spoke using much profanity and that Keyop's excess mouth motion would cover up deleting the words. This was not true, as demonstrated by the existence of an unedited Gatchaman version released by ADV Films in the US, in which Jinpei rarely, if ever, used profanity. The in-story explanation for Keyop's unique manner of speech is that he is an artificial life form with a speech impediment because of slightly defective genetic engineering.\nThe main villain, known as Zoltar in BotP, had an unusual background due to the gender changing mutant nature of the original Berg Katse character. In an episode where Katse's female half was featured (BotP title: \"The Galaxy Girls\"), she was introduced as a separate character, Zoltar's sister, for BotP. (A hint of her actual nature was retained in the name she used when masquerading as a human, Mala Latroz—\"Latroz\" is an anagram of \"Zoltar.\")\nTo compensate for the other differences, a robot named 7-Zark-7—who watched over G-Force from their base, Center Neptune—performed explanatory voiceovers and light comic relief, which not only padded the time lost from editing but also filled in the gaps in the storyline. This device bears the influence of contemporary Star Wars film, with 7-Zark-7 having a visual appearance not dissimilar from R2-D2, and a somewhat camp personality in the style of C-3PO. Notionally, 7-Zark-7 ran the undersea monitoring station Center Neptune, from where he received information regarding incoming threats to Earth and relayed that information to G-Force. Zark and other added characters, such as 1-Rover-1, Zark's robotic dog (who could hover from one side of the control room to the other by spinning his tail like a propeller, Muttley-style) and Susan (the early-warning computer whose sultry feminine voice often sent Zark into ecstasy) added to the cartoon's youth appeal. Some additional footage was also animated showing G-Force members Mark and Princess (using their Gatchaman model sheets) interacting with Zark, as well putting an image of Mark on a video screen in the control room, helping his addition blend more smoothly into the existing Gatchaman footage (although there is a clear difference in quality between the Zark and the Gatchaman animation).\nCharacter variations\n;Team variations in different versions\n{| class=wikitable\n|- valign=bottom\n!

It followed the plot of the original Gatchaman much more faithfully than Battle of the Planets because of this. Missing was Hoyt Curtin's original score. New voice acting was used.\nTwo soundtrack albums and several DVDs have been released.\nThe two Japanese follow-up series, Gatchaman II and Gatchaman Fighter, were combined into 65 episodes and released as the Saban-produced show Eagle Riders. All 65 episodes aired in Australia, but in the United States, only 13 episodes were aired.\nTV movie\nA TV movie called Battle of the Planets: The Movie was made by Gallerie International Films and Sandy Frank Film Syndication. David Bret Egen was the voice of 7-Zark-7. Several episodes were compiled to create a new storyline that contained violence as well as deaths. It was considered for an uncut remake of Battle of the Planets, but was scrapped when plans changed, as Frank began focusing efforts on arranging an uncut dub of Gatchaman instead.\nComic books\nBattle of the Planets was also released in comic book form, originally by Gold Key Comics, but later revamped by Top Cow Productions. Among the Top Cow comic books was Battle of the Planets: Princess, written by David Wohl with art by Wilson Tortosa, released in 2002. A Battle of the Planets comic strip ran in the British TV Comic. The TV Comic issues which feature the Battle of the Planets strip run from #1530 (17 April 1981) to #1671 (30 December 1983). TV Comic also reprinted some of the Gold Key stories for two Battle of the Planets holiday specials and one TV Comic holiday special. There was also a Battle of the Planets Annual which reprinted some of the Gold Key stories.\nVoice cast\nApart from the pilot episode, Battle of the Planets featured a generic end credits sequence which only credited the regular cast, Alan Young, Casey Kasem, Janet Waldo, Ronnie Schell, Keye Luke and Alan Dinehart. But in addition to the regulars, several uncredited 'guest' performers voiced secondary characters in many of the episodes. These included Takayo Fischer, William Woodson (who was also the announcer for the opening titles, episode previews and trailers), Frank Maxwell, Edward Andrews, Wendy Young (daughter of Alan Young), and David Jolliffe (who also voiced Jason in the pilot). The pilot episode featured a different end credits sequence which also credited Jolliffe, William Woodson and Alan Oppenheimer. It is unclear which character Oppenheimer voiced in the episode (it may have been Gorok, the episode's villain; or it may have been Chief Anderson, who was cut from the final version of the episode), and he never worked on the series again.\nRegular Cast:\n*Alan Young as 7-Zark-7, Keyop, additional voices\n*Casey Kasem as Mark, additional voices\n*Ronnie Schell as Jason (regular voice), Tiny (episode 1), additional voices\n*Keye Luke as Zoltar, the Spirit, Cronos, additional voices\n*Janet Waldo as Princess, Susan, additional voices\n*Alan Dinehart as Tiny (regular voice), Anderson, additional voices\nAdditional voices provided by:\n*David Jolliffe Jason (episode 1), additional voices\n*William Woodson announcer, additional voices\n*Alan Oppenheimer additional voices, episode 1 only\n*Edward Andrews additional voices (uncredited)\n*Takayo Fischer additional voices (uncredited)\n*Frank Maxwell additional voices (uncredited)\n*Wendy Young additional voices (uncredited)\nEpisodes\nSoundtrack\n;Battle of the Planets track listing\n#Main Theme – Title Card\n#Dramatic Curtain\n#Ready Room\n#Alien Trap\n#BP-Mysterioso 4 – BP-Mysterioso 3 – BP-Mysterioso 2\n#BP-Teenage Mysterioso\n#Love In The Afterburner\n#7-Zark-7's Song – Zarks Theme Alt – Zark Disco\n#Keyops 1 – Robot Hijinks\n#Firefight\n#BP-Orion Cue #1 – Orion 4 – BP-Orion Runs\n#Alien Planet\n#Two Monsters – Star Fight\n#Alien Trouble – More Alien Trouble\n#Space On Fire\n#Phoenix Raising\n#BP-108\n#BP-101 Alt – The Robot's Dog\n#BP-Sneak-Up – BP-Bad Guys\n#Return To The Alien Planet\n#BP-600 – BP600 A\n#BP-101 – BP-106 – BP-107 – BP-2002\n#Come Out, Come Out\n#BP-105 – BP-2001\n#Melting Jets\n#BP-Dialogue – BP-2025 – BP-Mysterious – BP-2020 – BP-2002\n#The Chief Alien Shows Up - Victory\n#Main Title With Voice Over\n#Emblem G\n#Spectra Visions\n#Like The Phoenix\n#Coral Reef\n#Crescent Moon\n#Holding Up A Shad\n#Zoltar, Fastening The Armor\n#Fighter G\n#Red Illusion\n#The Earth Is Alone!\n#A Vow To The Sky\n#Countdown\n#Fighting Phoenix\n#Space Chase\n#BP-1 Zark's Theme\n#Alien Planet\n#BP-1000\n#Space Mummy Trailer\n#Space Serpent Trailer\n#The Ghost Ship Of Planet Mir Trailer\n#The Luminous One (Promo Spot)\n#G-Force Vs.

Aimed at the 6-11 male demographic, the project was conceived when d-rights expressed interest in Nelvana rebooting the franchise following the success of the second generation of Beyblade. No new information on the project has surfaced since 2016 and has since been scrapped as Nelvana's parent company Corus Entertainment removed the press release from their official website.\nLive-action film\nIt was announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con that Joe and Anthony Russo are producing a live-action Battle of the Planets film through their production company, AGBO, with the possibility of directing. On July 22, 2021, it was announced the duo have brought Daniel Casey to write the script. In a video interview with AP Entertainment on July 1, 2022, Joe Russo said they are still working on the movie.\nFurther reading\n* G-Force: Animated (TwoMorrows Publishing: )\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
