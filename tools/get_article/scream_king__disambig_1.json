Scream queen is the equivalent for women. Notable scream king examples include Patrick Wilson, Vincent Price, Bill Skarsgård, Reggie Bannister, Bruce Campbell, Robert Englund, Corey Feldman, Daniel Kaluuya, Evan Peters, Kyle Gallner, Bill Moseley, Justin Long, Finn Wolfhard and Finn Wittrock.\nDefinition\nThe term \"scream king\" has been used to refer to male leading actors who have made their name through taking on leading roles in horror movies as a \"final guy\" character. Rachel Roth defines the rise of the \"scream kings\" as a result of moving away from formulas where men are typically cast as monsters for a female character to fight off and female actresses being cast less as victims and sometimes as the monster or villain themselves. Roth cites Bruce Campbell as an early example of a scream king for his role in the Evil Dead franchise. Campbell has also been referred to as \"the definitive scream king.\"\nAnother notable early example of a scream king would be Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.\nRyan Heffernan from Dread Central states \"A scream king is an actor that doesn’t merely work in genre cinema on occasion or by chance but a fella that does so deliberately and proudly embraces his horror credentials.\" Scream kings may branch out and work in other areas but gentlemen of this ilk always find their way back to the horror space when the right project comes along.\nHowever, Tony Todd's crowning achievement as one of the all-time great scream kings though comes from his role in the Candyman (1992) films, playing the eponymous villain haunting the infamous Cabrini-Green housing projects in Chicago. Showing that you don't have to be the final guy to be a scream king but can earn the title through being influential as a horror villain.\nHistory\nBeginnings (1920s-1960s)\nDonald Sutherland earned the title of scream king for his appearances in Castle of the Living Dead, ''Don't Look Now, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978).\n1970s\nReggie Bannister has been given the title for starring in every Phantasm film, Bloody Bloody Bible Camp, Wishmaster, Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation, and The Mangler Reborn.
