His postwar career included success as a businessman, and a return to aviation as a civilian inspector and auditor for the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II.\nGrange graduated from the American Curtiss Flying School in September 1915 and joined the Royal Naval Air Service. He served in 1 Wing on the French coast, and scored his first victory there by destroying a seaplane on 25 September 1916. He moved on to 8 Naval Squadron. On 4 January 1917, while flying Sopwith Pup no. N1594, he destroyed an Albatros D.II and drove two others down out of control. Three days later, he sent another D.II down out of control, but was wounded in the process. He was returned to England, and served as an instructor for the rest of the war.\nHonors and awards\nDistinguished Service Cross (DSC)\nFlight Lieut.
