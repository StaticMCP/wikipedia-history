Released by Parrot Records in 1971 (PAS 71047), it was the first album released after the departure of guitarist Lonesome Dave, drummer Roger Earl, and bassist Tony Stevens, who all went on to form the more successful rock band Foghat. This left Kim Simmonds as the only remaining member. Simmonds recruited a new line-up of members, predominantly members of the previous line-up of the blues band Chicken Shack, which had undergone a seismic change in membership similar to that which had affected Savoy Brown, which, in turn, ushered in a new sound for the band.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n# \"Tell Mama\" (Paul Raymond, Kim Simmonds) – 5:15\n# \"I Can't Get Next To You\" (Barrett Strong, Norman Whitfield) – 6:35\n# \"Let It Rock\" (Raymond, Simmonds) – 3:07\n# \"Time Does Tell\" (Simmonds) – 5:29\nSide two\n# \"Street Corner Talking\" (Simmonds) – 4:00\n# \"All I Can Do\" (Raymond, Simmonds) – 10:54\n# \"Wang Dang Doodle\" (Willie Dixon) – 7:15\nBonus track on 1991 CD reissue\n\"Tell Mama\" (Raymond, Simmonds) – 3:07 (single version)\nPersonnel\nSavoy Brown\n* Dave Walker – vocals\n* Kim Simmonds – lead guitar\n* Paul Raymond – keyboards; guitar (track 1); vocals (track 3)\n* Andy Silvester – bass guitar\n* Dave Bidwell – drums\nProduction\n* Neil Slaven – producer\n* George Chkiantz – engineer\n* Rod Thear – assistant engineer\n* Sam Feldman – mastering (side two of original issue)\n* Anthony Hawkins – remastering (1991 CD)\n* John Tracy – liner notes, coordination, compilation, research (CD)\n* David Anstey – cover illustration\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
