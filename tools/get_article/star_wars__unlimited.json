Its first set, Spark of Rebellion, was released on March 8, 2024. It includes a wide variety of unique art on the cards instead of using film stills. Like many other TCGs, it borrows design elements from Magic: The Gathering, and also shares design elements with Disney Lorcana. Similar to Magic, there are different formats within Unlimited, and some cards can get suspended to create game balance. In November 2024, the Boba Fett leader was suspended for representing more than half of the winners at competitive events.\nGameplay\nThe main way to play Star Wars: Unlimited is called Premier, where two players compete against each other in a best-of-three format. Each player needs a deck consisting of at least 50 cards plus a leader and a base card. To win one of the three games, a player needs to destroy their opponent's base.\nCard types\nThere are seven types of cards that can be played:\n* Leader - represents a key figure from the Star Wars universe, such as Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker. The card is double-sided and begins the game in play on its undeployed side, in which it restricted to using its unique ability. Over the course of the game it can be flipped over and be deployed as unit. Each deck must have exactly one leader card.\n* Base - a card that starts the game in play and has around 30 health points (HP). If the HP of a base drops to zero, the respective player loses the game. Some bases also have an ability. Each deck must have exactly one base card.\n* Unit - represents a character, creature or vehicle. Units are divided into ground and space units. A unit can be used to attack units of the same type or the opponent's base. Each unit has a Power value (how much damage does it deal when attacking), an HP value (how much damage can it take before leaving the board) and an optional text, specifying keywords, traits and abilities.\n* Upgrade - a card that is attached to a unit to provide some form of bonus or penalty.\n* Event - a single-use effect that is triggered when played.\n* Token Unit - a unit that is not part of the deck, but is deployed by another card.\n* Token Upgrade - an upgrade that is not included in the deck, but is generated by another card.\nAspects\nEach card has one or two aspects. The aspects of each card that is played must be covered by the aspects of that player's leader and base card. If that is not the case, the player needs to pay two extra resources per aspect that is not covered. There is a total of 6 aspects:\n* Heroism (white) - features heroes from the Star Wars universe and is usually paired with another aspect.\n* Villainy (black) - features villains from the Star Wars universe and is usually paired with another aspect.\n* Aggression (red) - focuses on a fast and risk-involved playstyle.\n* Command (green) - centers around the fast accumulation of resources and the deployment of many units.\n* Cunning (yellow) - focuses on disrupting the opponent.\n* Vigilance (blue) - favors a defensive approach and taking control of the pace of the battle.\nExpansions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!Set name\n!Set code\n!Release date\n!Size\n!Theme\n|-\n|1\n|Spark of Rebellion\n|SOR\n|March 8, 2024\n|252\n|\"the conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance\"\n|-\n|2\n|Shadows of the Galaxy\n|SHD\n|July 12, 2024\n|262\n|\"the smugglers, scoundrels, and scavengers of the Outer Rim, with particular emphasis on bounty hunters\"\n|-\n|3\n|Twilight of the Republic\n|TWI\n|November 8, 2024\n|257\n|\"the military conflicts between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, featuring the heroes and villains that fought throughout the Clone Wars\"\n|-\n|4\n|Jump to Lightspeed\n|JTL\n|March 14, 2025\n|257\n|\"starships, pilots, and epic space battles\"\n|-\n|5\n|Legends of the Force\n|LOF\n|July 11, 2025\n|264\n|\"Force users, such as Jedi, Sith, and more\"\n|-\n|6\n|Secrets of Power\n|SEC\n|November 7, 2025\n|264\n|\"operatives, officials, saboteurs and schemers\"\n|-\n|7\n|A Lawless Time\n|\n|2026\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Ashes of the Empire\n|\n|2026\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Homeworlds\n|\n|2026\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nCompetitive play\nThe first major tournament, the Galactic Championship, took place at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States from July 25 to 27, 2025.\nReception\nStar Wars: Unlimited was largely well received on its release. Jam Walker from GamesHub praised the game system by describing it as \"[feeling] enormously rewarding, and satisfying in its depth\". Charlie Hall from Polygon agreed, highlighting the mechanical aspect of the game. While Matt Thrower from IGN complemented the \"fast-moving, blow-trading turn structure\", he also felt that the game was not living up to its now defunct predecessor Star Wars: Destiny. Matt Jarvis from Dicebreaker concluded that the gameplay was \"passable but ultimately unremarkable\", expressing doubt about Unlimited's ability to compete with well-established rivals, like Magic: The Gathering and the Pokémon Trading Card Game, as well as newer TCGs such as Disney Lorcana, which had launched a year earlier. Walker also felt uncertain about the game's future due to the recent track record of Fantasy Flight Games.\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n*[https://starwarsunlimited.com/ Official website]\n*"
