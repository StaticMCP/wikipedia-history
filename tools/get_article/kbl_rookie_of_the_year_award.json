Both foreign and domestic players who meet the criteria are eligible to be nominated for the award.\nEligibility\nDomestic players must be in their first two seasons and have played at least 50% of the 54 league games. Foreign players with experience in overseas leagues may be considered for nomination but must have less than a year of playing experience in a professional team.\nHistory\nFrom the 1997–98 season to the 2011–12 seasons, the KBL rookie draft took place in January or February, towards the end of the season. Rookies only began their first season with a professional team in October of the same calendar year, when the KBL season began. The draft was eventually moved closer to the beginning of the professional season.\nIn terms of award eligibility, the term \"rookie\" (Korean: 신인) previously only applied to players in their first year as a professional. With the rise of foreign import players and increasing competition among domestic players for spots on the first team, concerns arose over the fact that few first-year players clocked up enough playing time to qualify for the award and players who were only able to break into the first team during their second or third year as a professional. Prior to the 2020–21 season, the KBL announced that eligibility for the award would be extended to players in their first two years and foreign players.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#CFECEC; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| ^\n|Denotes player who is still active in the KBL\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"|\n|Denotes player whose team won the KBL Championship that year\n|-\n|Player(in italic text)\n|Denotes player who has also won the KBL Most Valuable Player Award\n|-\n|Team (X)\n|Denotes the number of times a player from this team had won at that time\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Season (sortable), Player (sortable), Position (sortable), Nationality (sortable) and Team (sortable)\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Season\n!scope=\"col\"| Player\n!scope=\"col\"| Position\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n|-\n| 1997–98\n| Joo Hee-jung\n| Guard\n| Wonju Naray Blue Bird\n|-\n| 1998–99\n| Shin Ki-sung\n| Guard\n| Wonju Naray Blue Bird (2)\n|-\n| 1999–00\n| Kim Sung-chul\n| Forward\n| Anyang SBS Stars\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| 2000–01\n| Lee Kyu-sup\n| Forward\n| Suwon Samsung Thunders\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| 2001–02\n| Kim Seung-hyun\n| Guard\n| Daegu Tongyang Orions\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| 2002–03\n| Kim Joo-sung\n| Forward\n| Wonju TG Xers (3)\n|-\n| 2003–04\n| Lee Hyun-ho\n| Forward\n| Seoul Samsung Thunders (2)\n|-\n| 2004–05\n| Yang Dong-geun\n| Guard\n| Ulsan Mobis Phoebus\n|-\n| 2005–06\n| Bang Seung-yoon\n| Forward\n| Seoul SK Knights\n|-\n| 2006–07\n| Lee Hyun-min\n| Guard\n| Changwon LG Sakers\n|-\n| 2007–08\n| Kim Tae-sul\n| Guard\n| Seoul SK Knights (2)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| 2008–09\n| Ha Seung-jin\n| Center\n| Jeonju KCC Egis\n|-\n| 2009–10\n| Park Sung-jin\n| Guard\n| Incheon Electroland Elephants\n|-\n| 2010–11\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Park Chan-hee^\n| Guard\n| Anyang KGC (2)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| 2011–12\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Oh Se-keun^\n| Center\n| Anyang KGC (3)\n|-\n| 2012–13\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Choi Boo-kyung^\n| Forward\n| Seoul SK Knights (3)\n|-\n| 2013–14\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Kim Jong-kyu^\n| Center\n| Changwon LG Sakers (2)\n|-\n| 2014–15\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Lee Seoung-hyun^\n| Forward\n| Goyang Orions (2)\n|-\n| 2015–16\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Jung Seong-woo^\n| Guard\n| Changwon LG Sakers (3)\n|-\n| 2016–17\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Kang Sang-jae^\n| Forward\n| Incheon Electroland Elephants (2)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| 2017–18\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Ahn Young-joon^\n| Forward\n| Seoul SK Knights (4)\n|-\n| 2018–19\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Byeon Jun-hyung^\n| Guard\n| Anyang KGC (4)\n|-\n| 2019–20}}\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Kim Hoon^\n| Forward\n| Wonju DB Promy (4)\n|-\n| 2020–21\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Oh Jae-hyun^\n| Guard\n| Seoul SK Knights (5)\n|-\n| 2021-22\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Lee Woo-suk^\n| Guard\n| Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus (2)\n|-\n| 2022-23\n| RJ Abarrientos^\n| Guard\n| Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus (3)\n|-\n| 2024–25\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| JD Cagulangan\n| Guard\n| Suwon KT Sonicboom\n|}\nTeams\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
