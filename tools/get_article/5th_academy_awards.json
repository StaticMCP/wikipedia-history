Films screened in Los Angeles between August 1, 1931, and July 31, 1932, were eligible to receive awards. Walt Disney created a short animated film for the banquet, Parade of the Award Nominees.\nGrand Hotel became the only Best Picture winner to be nominated for Best Picture and nothing else. It was the second of six films to date to win Best Picture without a Best Director nomination, preceded by Wings and followed by Driving Miss Daisy, Argo, Green Book, and CODA; and the third of seven to win without a screenwriting nomination.\nThis was the first of three Oscars in which two films not nominated for Best Picture received more nominations than the winner (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Guardsman). This happened again at the 25th and 79th Academy Awards.\nThis year saw the introduction of short film awards, with Best Short Subject, Cartoon winner Flowers and Trees becoming the first color film to win an Oscar.\nThere was a tie for Best Actor, the first event in Academy history. Fredric March had led Wallace Beery in the balloting by only one vote, and the rules (later changed) said that the leader and runner-up could both be considered winners if they were only 3 votes apart. This left the Academy short one Oscar. By winning Best Actor for The Champ, as well as starring in Grand Hotel, Wallace Beery is one of only two performers to date to appear in a Best Picture-winning film and win an acting Oscar for a different Best Picture nominee in the same year.\nThis was the last ceremony to date in which no film won more than two Oscars.\nWinners and nominees\nAwards\nNominees were announced on October 12, 1932.
