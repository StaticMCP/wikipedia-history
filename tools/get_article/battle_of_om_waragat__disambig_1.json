The battle saw a smaller Egyptian-led force under Governor-General Rudolf von Slatin suffer heavy losses against numerically superior Mahdist insurgents. While not a pivotal battle of the war, the defeat at Om Waragat significantly weakened Slatin's control over the region and contributed to his eventual surrender to the Mahdists.\nThe Battle\nSlatin’s force moved through Darfur, with a mix of regulars (“Bazingers” etc.), allied local forces, Black troops, some freed slaves employed regularly, and tribal auxiliaries.\nSlatin was suffering from illness (fever) during the campaign.\nOn the march, they reached a place called Om Waragat, and were moving across soft, boggy moorland. The terrain was difficult, with areas of mire or swamp, which impeded movement, The rear guard was the first to be engaged—Mahdist forces brought a surprise attack. The rear guard fired a volley but did not have time to reload before being overwhelmed by a rush of attackers, Slatin tried to respond: he ordered reserves, sounded bugles to regroup, had the square formation adopt certain measures (e.g. “lie down”) to prevent further penetration. He personally moved toward threatened sectors (left flank, rear) to try to stabilize the situation, After Slatin lost 800 men just in the first 20 minutes of the battle\nThe Mahdist fighters, many of whom were lightly armed (rifles, weapons less uniformly modern), used speed and numbers, taking advantage of terrain and possibly surprise. Slatin’s force was overrun or pressed so hard that the square formation was breached in places.\nAftermath\nSlatin’s defeat significantly weakened Egyptian authority in Darfur. Control over the region slipped much more into Mahdist hands, making further military operations more difficult for the Egyptians.\nFor Slatin personally, this defeat diminished his position and contributed to the pressures that later surrounded his role and his struggles to maintain control in the region.\nReferences"
