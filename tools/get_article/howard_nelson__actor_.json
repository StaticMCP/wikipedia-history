Cast both in comedy roles and as \"heavies\" due to his muscular appearance, Nelson's most regular employer was close personal friend Harrison Marks. For many years Nelson worked in Marks' studio in Farringdon. As well as being a regular in Marks' softcore films (The Nine Ages of Nakedness, Come Play With Me), Nelson also appeared in several of Marks' 8mm glamour films. Nelson also made several non-sexual appearances in various blue films made by Marks, usually wearing elaborate disguises such as dark glasses and/or a blonde wig. In 1978 he appeared on the cover of Forum magazine (Vol.10, No.11). He also featured as a \"spanking milkman\" in the second issue of New Janus (circa 1982), a corporal punishment magazine that Marks edited.\nLatterly, Howard worked for a time at Lovejoy’s Bookshop, and was occasionally spotted around the Charing Cross area. He died of natural causes at his South London home in December 2007, in February 2009 the Metropolitan Police launched an appeal to find any of his surviving relatives.\nPartial filmography\n*    Pattern of Evil (1967)....Arthur Vanderhorn\n*    Macabre (8mm glamour short, filmed September 1968)\n*    The Nine Ages of Nakedness (1969) - Sir Rupert (segment \"The Cavaliers\")\n*    Secrets of Sex (1969)....
