Unlike some of his ancestors, he dedicated to developing economy and increasing his exchequer, instead of expanding territory or conquering others through wars.\nAccording to one account carried by the Records of the Grand Historian, King Gong of Zhou once did initiate a war and destroyed the State of Mi. When he was touring in State of Mi, he saw three extremely beautiful women and commanded Mi's lord to find them out and send them to his own palace. But the lord of the state took the three extremely beautiful women as his own concubines, which irritated King Gong. So he invaded this state and sentenced that lord to death.\nAfter 15 years reign, he passed the throne to his son King Yì of Zhou and departed peacefully in his own palace.\nFamily\nQueens:\n* Wang Gui, of the Gui clan ()\nSons:\n* Crown Prince Jian (; 899–892 BC), ruled as King Yì of Zhou from 899–892 BC\nSee also\n* Family tree of Chinese monarchs (ancient)\nSources"
