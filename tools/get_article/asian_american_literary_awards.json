The awards include a set of honors for excellence in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, chosen by a panel of literary and academic judges; a Members' Choice Award, voted on by the Workshop's members from the list of that year's entries; and a Lifetime Achievement Award. To be eligible, a book must be written by someone of Asian descent living in the United States and published first in English; entries are actively solicited by the Workshop.\nList of winners\n''* = Member's Choice Award\n;1998\n*Mei-mei Berssenbrugge – Endocrinology\n*Lois-Ann Yamanaka – Blu's Hanging\n;1999\n*Susan Choi – The Foreign Student\n*Arthur Sze – The Redshifting Web: Poems 1970–98\n;2000\n*Eric Gamalinda – Zero Gravity\n*Chang-rae Lee – A Gesture Life\n*Bino Realuyo* – Umbrella Country\n;2001\n*Ha Jin – The Bridegroom and Other Stories\n*Eugene Gloria – Drivers at the Short Time Motel: Poems\n*Akhil Sharma – An Obedient Father\n*Nick Carbo* – Secret Asian Man\n;2002\n*Alexander Chee – Edinburgh\n*Luis H.
