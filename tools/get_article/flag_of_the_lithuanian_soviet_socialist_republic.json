It was a red flag with the national name and a hammer and sickle in the upper canton. The flag in use from 1953 to 1988 was a red flag with the golden hammer and sickle and a gold-bordered red star in its upper canton with a white thin stripe and green thick band on the bottom.\nHistory\nDuring the Lithuanian–Soviet War, the pro-Soviet forces used a plain red flag that was adopted by the short-lived Lithuanian SSR (1918–1919) and Lithuanian–Belorussia SSR puppet states.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, the newly established Lithuanian SSR adopted a new national flag on 30 July 1940. The flag was red with the Latin characters LIETUVOS TSR (Lithuanian SSR in the Lithuanian language) in gold sans-serif typeface in the upper canton, and a gold hammer and sickle below the text.\nOn 15 July 1953, a new flag was adopted. It was modified to meet the new requirements for all flags of the Soviet socialist republics. The top red portion took  of the width and incorporated the mandatory hammer and sickle and red star. The bottom part could be customized by each republic. Lithuania added a narrow white ( of the width) and a larger green ( of the width) strips. The green and white stripes thus represented the country's wide fields and forests, which serve the country's agricultural and forestry industries.\nOn 18 November 1988, the tricolour of Lithuania was adopted as the flag of the SSR, even before Lithuania declared independence in March 1990. The Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, inspired by pro-independence Sąjūdis, amended the constitution and adopted the tricolour flag of Lithuania that was used during the interwar years.\nLegal status\nSince Lithuania banned Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008, raising or otherwise using the Lithuanian SSR flag in public is illegal.\nSee also\n* Emblem of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic\n* Flag of Lithuania\nReferences\n}}"
