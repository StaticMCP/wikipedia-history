The Left and other allies of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) such as Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) announced their support on Patil's candidature. Shiv Sena, an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also supported Patil's candidature.

It consists of a website and a PDF booklet (titled \"Presidential Election 2007\"), created by the BJP under the banner of Project India. Both contain the party's allegation in the form of a compilation of articles from various media. While announcing the website at a press conference, the BJP party general secretary Arun Jaitley also distributed a printed form of the booklet and described it as a compilation of articles / editorials from newspapers on the Presidential contest.\nThe stated objective of the site is to \"educate the people about Pratibha Patil, the nominee of UPA and Indian left for Indian presidential election scheduled on 19 July 2007\". To support this, the website consists of various sections like 'Cartoon,' 'Pratibhaspeak' and 'UPA Doublespeak' and includes links to video clippings and articles that refer to the various allegations levelled against Pratibha Patil.\nThe website declares :\nBJP leader Arun Jaitley talking to news-persons called the website a \"campaign to provide an informed choice to the electorate (the electoral college)\". \"The voter has a right to the information about the candidate he is voting for. This effort is intended for an informed choice of the electorate,\" Jaitley said.\nArun Jaitley did not respond when asked what would happen to the right of information when people are \"informed\" only about one of the two presidential candidates. He said the website would vanish after 21 July, when the presidential election result will be out.\nHowever, the website can still be viewed via archive.org\nAn INC spokesperson commented:\nBJP division\nThe Times of India  BJP leaders had initially looked divided over supporting this campaign against Pratibha Patil. Party chief Rajnath Singh seemed reluctant to be drawn into a \"personal attack\" while senior party leader L. K. Advani spoke at length on the \"pliant President\" issue at the party's national executive last month. Daily News and Analysis also reported on the apparent differences among senior leaders on this campaign and had this quote:\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n! MPs\n! MLAs\n!
