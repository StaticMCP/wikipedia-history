It was the largest plane of the canal and also one of only three double-track planes. The plane tender's house is now the Jim and Mary Lee Morris Canal Museum. The interaction of the Lopatcong Creek with the canal resulted in building an overflow and waste weir downstream of the inclined plane.\nGallery\nFile:Morris Canal, Inclined Plane 9 West, Port Warren, NJ - looking east.jpg|View looking toward the summit of Inclined Plane 9 West of the Morris Canal\nFile:Inclined Plane 9 West near port Warren from HABS.png|Similar view from the Historic American Engineering Record\nFile:Morris Canal, Inclined Plane 9 West, Port Warren, NJ - plane summit.jpg|Cables on sleeper stones at the summit\nFile:Port Warren, NJ - Morris Canal Overflow and Waste Weir.jpg|Overflow and waste weir site\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
