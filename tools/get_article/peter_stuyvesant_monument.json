It is located at Journal Square district of Jersey City, New Jersey. The statue of Stuyvesant by J. Massey Rhind was originally installed in 1913 at Bergen Square. The statue and pedestal were unceremoniously removed in 2010. In 2014, the statue was restored and placed at nearby park in anticipation that a new pedestal would be built at the original location.\nSignificance\nBergen Square and surrounding streets are the site of what is considered to be the oldest chartered municipality in the state of New Jersey, which at the time was part of the province of New Netherland. While the area had been settled as early as the 1630s, first charter was granted by the Director-General of New Netherland, Petrus Stuyvesant in 1660 as Bergen. In 1683, became it became Bergen Township.\nOriginal dedication\nA statue of Stuyvesant by J. Massey Rhind was situated on Bergen Square to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the establishment of Bergen.
