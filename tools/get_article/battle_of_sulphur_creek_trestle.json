Forrest's Confederate forces moved towards Athens. That evening the Confederate forces gained control of the town, and the Union forces had retreated within Fort Henderson.\nThe Confederate forces began an artillery barrage on the morning of the 24th.  In a personal meeting, Forrest convinced the Union commander, Colonel Wallace Campbell, that the Confederate forces numbered 8,000-10,000.  Campbell surrendered the fort and its garrison\naround noon.\nShortly after the garrison had surrendered, reinforcements consisting of about 350 men from the 18th Michigan and 102nd Ohio, commanded by Jonas Elliott, arrived by train from Decatur.  After suffering casualties of one-third their total personnel, these forces surrendered.\nSulphur Creek Trestle (September 25)\nAfter defeating the Union forces in Athens, Forrest moved north along the railroad with the intent to destroy a strategic trestle at Sulphur Creek, six miles north of Athens.  A fortification, two blockhouses, and a force of 1,000 Union soldiers defended the trestle.\nOn the morning of the 25th, the Confederate forces began an artillery bombardment of the fort.  The fortification had been built below the summits of adjacent hills, and thus provided little defense against the bombardment. 200 Union soldiers were killed, including the\ncommander, Colonel William Hopkins Lathrop. By noon, George Spalding had surrendered the remaining 800 soldiers. There were no reported Confederate losses.\nAftermath\nThe Union prisoners were transferred to Confederate prisons. Many of these prisoners died on April 27, 1865, when the steamboat Sultana sank while transporting them home.\nNotes\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130102173042/http://home.olemiss.edu/~cmprice/cavalry/battle.html] 20th (Russell's) Tennessee Cavalry, CSA\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108182931/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/CWSACReportAlabamaUpdate.pdf Update to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields - State of Alabama]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/unionarmyhistory06madi/unionarmyhistory06madi_djvu.txt]\n* http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/sources/recordView.cfm?Content=077/0514\n* Limestone County Historical Society, Historical Marker Text for \"Battle of Sulphur Creek Trestle\". http://www.marker.limestonecountyhistoricalsociety.org/html/sulphur_battle.html .
