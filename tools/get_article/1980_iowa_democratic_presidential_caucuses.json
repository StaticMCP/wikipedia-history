Although the January 21 precinct caucuses did not directly elect any delegates to the national convention, they were the first test of strength in the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries. President Jimmy Carter won the caucuses against U.S. senator Ted Kennedy, securing roughly 57 percent of the delegates elected to county conventions later in the year.\nCarter ultimately received 31 of the 60 pledged delegates from Iowa.\nBackground\nIn 1976, a strong showing in the Iowa precinct caucuses by former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter raised his profile from obscurity into contention for the Democratic nomination; after winning a series of primaries in other states, he was nominated at the 1976 Democratic National Convention and defeated incumbent president Gerald Ford in the fall election.\nProcedure\nThe Iowa precinct caucuses were held on January 21, in order to elect delegates to the county conventions. The March 8 county conventions elected delegates to state and congressional district conventions. On April 19, the district conventions met to elect 34 of the state's 60 delegates to the 1980 Democratic National Convention. On June 14, the state convention met to elect the remaining 16 national convention delegates.\nAlthough the precinct caucuses did not directly elect any delegates, they were the first test of strength in the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries.\nResults\nIncumbent President Jimmy Carter won by 31 delegates while U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy received 23 delegates. Uncommitted delegates won 418 and ultimately, 2 national convention delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!District\n!Carter\n!Kennedy\n!Uncommitted\n|-\n|1\n|62.4%\n|30.0%\n|7.5%\n|-\n|2\n|55.4%\n|35.3%\n|9.2%\n|-\n|3\n|58.7%\n|31.2%\n|10.1%\n|-\n|4\n|55.7%\n|36.0%\n|8.3%\n|-\n|5\n|61.2%\n|28.3%\n|10.4%\n|-\n|6\n|62.2%\n|25.5%\n|12.3%\n|}\nSee also\n* 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 1980 United States presidential election\n* 1980 Democratic National Convention\n* 1980 Republican National Convention\nReferences"
