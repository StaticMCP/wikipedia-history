In many cases, the values of items are estimates made on the spot by the cast members, and are not necessarily actual profits or losses. Some of the episodes were not aired in the order that they were filmed. Therefore, the * column in each season's episode list indicates the sequential order of that episode.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan = \"2\"|\n!rowspan =
