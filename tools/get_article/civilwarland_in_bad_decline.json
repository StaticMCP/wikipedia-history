McInerney also said, \"Quite unexpectedly, between guffaws, you find yourself moved. Mr. Saunders is one of those rare writers who can effortlessly blend satire and sentiment\", particularly praising the story \"Offloading for Mrs. Schwartz\".\nA reviewer for Kirkus Reviews wrote that the \"politics of scarcity are brilliantly fictionalized in these smart and understated stories\". Novelist Thomas Pynchon also saw in Saunders a vital new voice in American fiction: \"An astoundingly tuned voice—graceful, dark, authentic, and funny—telling just the kinds of stories we need to get us through these times.”\nIn Publishers Weekly, conversely, a reviewer lauded Saunders as having a rich vision and \"occasionally heart-melting prose\", but stated that there is little difference in voice to distinguish one story from another. Richard Eder wrote in the Los Angeles Times that \"Saunders can be wickedly ingenious and very funny. He takes a conversational line and disrupts it into comic disquiet. [...] Saunders is an imaginative ironist and an inventive absurdist\". However, Eder also argued that the author has a weaker sense of moral engagement than satirists like George Orwell and Jonathan Swift, as well as too little narration, with the critic billing \"Bounty\" as \"a series of scenes set one beside the other without much sense of development\".\nAwards, honors and other appearances\n* Two stories from the collection received the National Magazine Award for Fiction: \"The 400-Pound CEO\" in 1994, and \"Bounty\" in 1996.\nReferences"
