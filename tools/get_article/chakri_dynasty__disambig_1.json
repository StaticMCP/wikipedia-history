The head of the house is the king, who is head of state. The family has ruled Thailand since the founding of the Rattanakosin era and the city of Bangkok in 1782; following the end of Taksin's reign, when the capital of Siam shifted to Bangkok. The royal house was founded by Rama I, an Ayutthaya military leader.\nPrior to his accession to the throne, Rama I held for years the title Chakri, the civil chancellor. In founding the dynasty, the king himself chose \"Chakri\" as the name for it. The emblem of the house is composed of the discus (Chakra) and the trident (Trishula), the celestial weapons of the gods Vishnu and Shiva, of whom the Thai sovereign is seen as an incarnation.\nIn terms of lineage, King Rama IV stated in his royal correspondence that the ancestry of the Chakri dynasty was not purely Thai but of mixed Mon and Chinese descent. According to historian Edward van Roy, Kosa Pan was the son of Phraya Kiat, a Mon noble who supported Naresuan during the fourth Burmese–Siamese War, and , said to be a daughter of King Ekathotsarot and the wet nurse of Phetracha and Prince Narai, both future kings of Siam. Through his son Khunthong, Kosa Pan was a great-great-grandfather of King Rama I, the founder of the Chakri dynasty. His elder brother, Lek, held the post of foreign minister before him. Somdet Phra Pathom Boromma Mahachanok (Thongdee), meanwhile, was the father of King Phutthayotfa Chulalok. Some theories further propose that the dynasty may descend from King Naresuan the Great of Ayutthaya, which—if correct—would link it by blood to the Phra Ruang dynasty of the Sukhothai.\nThe current head of the house is Vajiralongkorn who was proclaimed king on 1 December 2016, but has reigned with retroactive effect since 13 October 2016 after the death of his father Bhumibol Adulyadej. The house's current seat is the Grand Palace. On Saturday, 4 May 2019, the coronation of Vajiralongkorn, with the traditional ceremony, occurred in Bangkok.\nRoyal family\nand Mom Sangwan (later the Princess Mother).]]\nin Bangkok, the dynastic seat and official residence of the dynasty.]]\nThe present royal family of Thailand belongs to the House of Mahidol (; ), a cadet branch of the Chakri dynasty. The House was founded by Prince Mahidol Adulyadej (1891–1929) and Princess Srinagarindra (1900–1995). The Prince was a son of King Chulalongkorn and his wife Queen Savang Vadhana. The Prince was also the half-brother of both King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok. After the death of King Ananda Mahidol (Prince Mahidol's elder son), King Bhumibol Adulyadej (the Prince's younger son) ascended the throne in 1946. In 1949 the King married his first cousin once removed, Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara (a daughter of Mom Chao Nakkhatra Mangala Kitiyakara, a grandson of King Chulalongkorn). Bhumibol was succeeded by his son Vajiralongkorn officially on 13 October 2016, but was proclaimed King on 1 December 2016.\nMembers\nThis is a list of current members of the royal family:\n* The King and Queen (the sovereign and his wife)\n** The Princess Rajasarini Siribajra (the King's eldest daughter)\n** Princess Sirivannavari (the King's youngest daughter)\n** Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti (the King's youngest son and heir presumptive)\n;Descendants of Rama IX\n* Princess Ubol Ratana (the King's elder sister)\n* The Princess Royal (the King's younger sister)\n* The Princess Srisavangavadhana (the King's younger sister)\n** Princess Siriba Chudhabhorn (the King's niece)\n** Princess Aditayadorn Kitikhun (the King's niece)\n;Descendants of Rama V\n* The Princess Suddhanarinatha (the King's ex-wife and maternal first cousin)\n* Prince Chalermsuk Yugala (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\nOther members\n;Descendants of Rama V\n* Prince Navabarn Yugala (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n* Prince Dighambara Yugala (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n* Prince Chatrichalerm Yugala (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n* Prince Chulcherm Yugala (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n* Princess Nobhadol Chalermsri Yugala (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n;Descendants of Rama IV\n* Prince Charunridhidej Jayankura (the King's paternal half-first cousin twice removed)\n* Princess Uthaikanya Bhanubandhu (the King's paternal second cousin once removed)\nOther noble relatives\n* Royal Noble Consort Sineenatha Bilaskalayani (the King's concubine)\n* Sujarinee Vivacharawongse (the King's ex-wife and Princess Sirivannavari's mother)\n** Juthavachara Vivacharawongse and Riya Gough (the King's eldest son & daughter-in-law)\n** Vacharaesorn Vivacharawongse (the King's second son)\n** Chakriwat Vivacharawongse (the King's third son)\n** Vatchrawee Vivacharawongse (the King's fourth son)\n* Dame Srirasmi Suwadee (the King's ex-wife and Prince Dipangkorn's mother)\n;Descendants of Rama IX\n* Peter Ladd Jensen (Princess Ubol Ratana's ex-husband)\n** Dame Ploypailin Jensen and David Wheeler (the King's niece & nephew-in-law)\n*** Maximus Wheeler (the King's grandnephew)\n*** Leonardo Wheeler (the King's grandnephew)\n*** Alexandra Wheeler (the King's grandniece)\n** Dame Sirikitiya Jensen (the King's niece)\n* Virayudh Tishyasarin (the Princess Srisavangavadhana's ex-husband)\n;Descendants of Mahidol Adulyadej\n* Dame Dhasanawalaya and Sinthu Sornsongkram (the King's paternal first cousin and her husband)\n** Jitat and Jessica Sornsongkram (the King's paternal first cousin once removed and his wife)\n*** Jerrica Sornsongkram (the King's paternal first cousin twice removed)\n*** Jaylanie Sornsongkram (the King's paternal first cousin twice removed)\n*** Jaylina Sornsongkram (the King's paternal first cousin twice removed)\n;Descendants of Rama V\n* Induratana Paribatra (the King's paternal half-first cousin once removed)\n* Dame Wutchaloem Vudhijaya (the King's paternal half-first cousin once removed)\n* Phanuma Yugala (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n* Sisawangwong Bunyachittradun (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n* Phumaripihrom Schell and Jean-Marie Schell (the King's paternal half-second cousin and her husband)\n* Patthamanarangsi Senanarong (the King's paternal half-second cousin)\n* Dame Busba Sathanapong (the King's maternal aunt)\n* The Hon.

Until 1885 every Chakri monarch had appointed a prince to this office. The Uprarat and his miniature court would reside at the Front Palace (วังหน้า) (a palace complex to the north of the Grand Palace, now the site of the Bangkok National Museum). By tradition the Uparat was designated the heir to the throne, however only Prince Itsarasunthon was able to ascend the throne as King Phutthaloetla Naphalai. The office was extremely prestigious and carried with it almost equal status to the king, this can be seen in Prince Chutamani (younger brother of King Mongkut), who was elevated to Vice King Pinklao in 1851 (he carried with him the styles and titles of a King). The office was abolished by King Chulalongkorn when his Uparat and cousin Prince Wichaichan died. He then declared his oldest son the crown prince of Siam, but not Uparat.\n{|style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"80\" |Portrait!!width=27%|Name!!width=15%|Birth!!width=15%|Relationship to Monarch!!width=15%|Reign!!width=15%|Coronation!!width=15%|Death!!width=15%|Monarch\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#fffaf0;\"|His Royal Highness Prince Maha Sura Singhanat\n||1 November 1744Ayutthaya\n||Younger brother\n||17823 November 1803\n||1782\n||3 November 1803Burapha Phimuk Hall, Front Palace(aged )\n| rowspan=2  |Rama I\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#fffaf0;\"|His Royal Highness Prince  Krommaluang Itsarasunthon\n||24 February 1767Amphawa\n||Second son\n||15 March 18077 September 1809(acceded to throne as Rama II)()\n||15 March 1807\n||21 July 1824Phaisan Thaksin Hall, Grand Palace(aged )\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#fffaf0;\"|His Majesty Royal Highness Prince Maha Senanurak\n||29 March 1773Thonburi\n||Younger brother\n||22 September 180916 July 1817()\n||22 September 1809\n||16 July 1817Wayusathan Amaret Hall, Front Palace(aged )\n||Rama II\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#fffaf0;\"|His Majesty Royal Prince Sakdiphonlasep\n||21 October 1785Grand Palace\n||Uncle\n||18241 May 1832\n||13 September 1824\n||1 May 1832Front Palace(aged )\n||Rama III\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#fffaf0;\"|His Majesty King Pinklao\n||4 September 1808Thonburi Palace\n||Younger brother\n||2 April 18517 January 1866()\n||25 May 1851\n||7 January 1866Wongchan Hall, Front Palace(aged )\n||Rama IV\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#fffaf0;\"|Krom PhrarajawangBowon Wichaichan\n||6 September 1838Thonburi Palace\n||First cousin\n||2 October 186828 August 1885()\n||25 November 1868\n||28 August 1885Bowon Boriwat Hall, Front Palace(aged )\n||Rama V\n|}\nRear Palace\nKrom Phrarajawang Boworn Sathan Phimuk (กรมพระราชวังบวรสถานพิมุข), or the Rear Palace, was another office inherited from the Kingdom of Ayutthaya.

The title was copied directly from the Western tradition. Since then, there have only been three crown princes. The most recent crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn, was invested with the title in 1972 and became King in 2016.
