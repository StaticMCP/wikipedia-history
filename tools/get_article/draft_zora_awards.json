Established in 2025 as a rebranding of the genre awards of the annual Hurston/Wright Legacy Awards, the Zora Awards continue the Foundation’s mission to support and honor Black writers around the world.\nThe renaming of the awards coincided with the Foundation’s 35th anniversary and was carried out in partnership with the Zora Neale Hurston Trust, highlighting Hurston’s enduring literary influence. The change also included an increase in the prize for debut fiction to $20,000, underscoring the Foundation’s commitment to emerging authors.\nAlthough 2025 marks the first year of the Zora Awards, all prior winners of the genre-specific Hurston/Wright Legacy Awards are now retroactively recognized as Zora Award recipients, maintaining historical continuity in honoring Black literary achievement.\n= History =\nLegacy Awards (2001–2024)\nThe Hurston/Wright Legacy Awards were introduced in 2001 as the first national awards in the United States presented to Black writers by a national organization of Black writers. These awards recognized literary excellence in four categories: fiction, debut fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, with winners and finalists selected by juries of established authors. Every October, the awards were presented at a ceremony organized by the Hurston/Wright Foundation, which was founded in 1990 by Marita Golden and Clyde McElvene to support the careers of Black writers.\nOver the years, the Legacy Awards became one of the most prestigious platforms for honoring Black literary achievement. Notable winners include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Purple Hibiscus), Colson Whitehead (The Underground Railroad) , Imani Perry (May We Forever Stand) , and Claudia Rankine (Citizen: An American Lyric) . These four competitive categories now form the basis of what are retroactively recognized as Zora Awards, excluding separate merit awards such as the North Star Award and Ella Baker Award, which are not included in this reclassification.\nRenaming to “Zora Awards” in 2025\nIn April 2025, the Hurston/Wright Foundation announced that the Legacy Awards would be renamed the Zora Awards to coincide with the Foundation’s 35th anniversary and in partnership with the Zora Neale Hurston Trust, in recognition of Hurston’s enduring literary legacy. The rebranding included the introduction of a US $20,000 prize for the debut fiction category, funded by an anonymous donor, while retaining the four primary categories of fiction, debut fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\nThe first ceremony under the Zora Awards title is scheduled for October 17, 2025, in Washington, D.C., with finalists expected to be announced in August 2025. Although 2025 marks the first awards presented under the new name, all previous winners of the four Legacy Award categories from 2001 to 2024 are now recognized as Zora Award recipients.\n= Award categories =\nThe Zora Awards are presented in four competitive literary categories. These categories directly continue the structure of the Hurston/Wright Legacy Awards, which began in 2001 as the first national awards program dedicated to honoring published Black writers across genres. The rebranding to the Zora Awards in 2025 retained the same categories, while retroactively recognizing all past winners of the Legacy Awards in these genres as Zora Award recipients.\nZora Award for General Fiction\nThe Zora Award for General Fiction is presented annually for excellence in fiction by a Black author. This category historically formed the centerpiece of the Legacy Awards program, showcasing some of the most prominent voices in literature. Notable past winners include Colson Whitehead for The Underground Railroad (2017) , James Hannaham for Delicious Foods (2016) , and Percival Everett for The Trees (2022), reflecting both literary innovation and cultural resonance.\nIn addition to winners, the category has also recognized a wide range of finalists whose works represent a breadth of narrative styles and thematic approaches. This category has been instrumental in highlighting fiction that engages with Black identity, social justice, and experimental literary form, maintaining its importance under the Zora Awards framework.\nZora Award for Debut Fiction\nThe Zora Award for Debut Fiction honors outstanding first works of fiction, establishing a platform for emerging writers to gain national recognition. Since its inception, this category has introduced writers such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Purple Hibiscus, 2004), Jeffrey Colvin (Africaville, 2020), and Meron Hadero (A Down Home Meal for These Difficult Times, 2023).\nUnder the 2025 rebranding, this category received a substantial prize enhancement, with winners now awarded US $20,000 to provide meaningful support for their early literary careers. This expansion underscores the Zora Awards’ commitment to fostering new voices and reflects the Foundation’s mission to invest in the next generation of Black writers.\nZora Award for Nonfiction\nThe Zora Award for Nonfiction encompasses a broad spectrum of nonfiction genres, including memoir, historical writing, social commentary, political analysis, and biography. Prominent past winners include Imani Perry for May We Forever Stand (2019) and Albert Woodfox for Solitary: My Story of Transformation and Hope (2020), works that exemplify the intellectual and cultural significance of the category.\nThis award recognizes the power of nonfiction not only to document but also to critically examine Black experiences globally. The inclusion of subcategories such as historical and political nonfiction under the Legacy Awards has been maintained within the Zora Awards to ensure continuity in celebrating this literary diversity.\nZora Award for Poetry\nThe Zora Award for Poetry celebrates poetic excellence by Black writers and has honored some of the most acclaimed poets of the 21st century. Past winners include Claudia Rankine (Citizen: An American Lyric, 2015) , Terrance Hayes (American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin, 2019) , and Shara McCallum (No Ruined Stone, 2022) , each of whom has contributed significantly to contemporary poetry.\nThis category continues to highlight poets whose work engages with language, identity, and cultural history. The Zora Award for Poetry affirms the central role of poetry in shaping Black literary traditions and will remain a cornerstone of the rebranded awards.\n= Winners and finalists =\nRetrospective Legacy Award winners (2001–2024)\nAlthough the Zora Awards will be officially presented for the first time in 2025, all past winners and finalists in the four competitive categories of the Hurston/Wright Legacy Awards (fiction, debut fiction, nonfiction, and poetry) are now retroactively recognized as Zora Award recipients.\nFiction\nContemplative fiction\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" |Contemplative fiction winners\n|-\n|Year\n|Author\n|Work\n|Ref.\n|-\n|2005\n|Tracy Price-Thompson\n|''A Woman's Worth\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Clyde W.

Commentators noted that the rebranding to the Zora Awards provides the program with a stronger cultural identity by directly invoking Zora Neale Hurston’s legacy, thereby strengthening its symbolic resonance within the literary community.[20]\nLisandra Green, trustee of the Zora Neale Hurston Trust, expressed strong support for the name change, describing it as a tribute that “preserves, promotes, and protects Hurston’s incredible legacy worldwide” while expanding the visibility of Black literary excellence on a national stage.\nThe introduction of a US $20,000 prize for the debut fiction category was also welcomed by critics and writers alike as an important step in providing material support to emerging voices. Publishers Weekly and other outlets noted that this expansion underscores the Foundation’s commitment to fostering new talent and ensuring that the awards remain a vital platform for future generations of Black writers.\nThe rebranding has been widely interpreted as both an acknowledgment of the awards’ historical impact and a forward-looking measure designed to position the Zora Awards as a premier national literary honor.\n= Governance and judging =\nThe Zora Awards continue to follow the judging structure originally established under the Hurston/Wright Legacy Awards. Each year, the Hurston/Wright Foundation oversees a juried competition in which panels of acclaimed writers are selected to review submissions and determine nominees, finalists, and winners in the four award categories: fiction, debut fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\nThe judging process remains anonymous and is intended to uphold fairness, integrity, and literary excellence. The Hurston/Wright Foundation’s board of directors retains administrative oversight of the awards, ensuring continuity between the Legacy Awards and the Zora Awards while preserving the program’s longstanding reputation for rigorous evaluation and professional standards.\n= Relationship to Hurston/Wright Merit Awards =\nThe Hurston/Wright Merit Awards are a separate group of honorary recognitions conferred by the Hurston/Wright Foundation during its annual awards ceremony.  These honors include:\n* The North Star Award, which pays tribute to the significance of the North Star as a symbol of freedom for enslaved Africans and is given to writers or cultural figures whose work or service functions as a beacon of inspiration for the Black literary community.\n* The Ella Baker Award, named after the civil rights leader, which recognizes writers or arts activists whose work has made an exceptional contribution to advancing social justice.\n* The Madam C. J. Walker Award, named for the pioneering entrepreneur and philanthropist, which honors individuals or organizations that have demonstrated outstanding innovation in supporting and sustaining Black literature.\nAlthough these Merit Awards are presented at the same ceremony as the Zora Awards, they remain separate from the competitive literary categories of fiction, debut fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. Unlike the Zora Awards, which are determined through a juried competition, the Merit Awards are conferred by the Foundation’s board of directors to recognize lifetime achievement, advocacy, or institutional contributions rather than specific published works.[23]\nWith the introduction of the Zora Awards in 2025, the Hurston/Wright Foundation reaffirmed that the Merit Awards would continue to coexist alongside the rebranded genre prizes. This structure allows the annual event both to celebrate individual books through the Zora Awards and to acknowledge the broader cultural and institutional forces that shape Black literature through the Merit Awards.\n= Ceremony =\nThe Zora Awards ceremony, like its predecessor, the Hurston/Wright Legacy Awards, is held annually in Washington, D.C. on the third Friday in October. The event is organized by the Hurston/Wright Foundation and brings together writers, publishers, educators, and members of the literary community to honor the year’s finalists and winners.\nThe ceremony typically begins with the announcement of finalists in August, providing an opportunity for public and media attention on the shortlisted authors prior to the awards presentation in October. For 2025, the inaugural Zora Awards ceremony is scheduled for October 17, 2025, marking the official debut of the awards under their new name.\nThe program traditionally includes the presentation of the four competitive Zora Awards categories—fiction, debut fiction, nonfiction, and poetry—along with the Hurston/Wright Merit Awards, such as the North Star Award, Ella Baker Award, and Madam C. J. Walker Award.[23]\nAlthough the specific host for the 2025 ceremony has not been publicly announced, past ceremonies have featured prominent figures in Black literature and media as hosts, reflecting the event’s cultural significance and its role as a gathering point for the literary community.\n= See also =\n·      Hurston/Wright Legacy Award\n·      Hurston/Wright Foundation\n= References ="
