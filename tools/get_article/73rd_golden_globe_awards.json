Writing for The Washington Post, Hank Stuever heavily criticised the ceremony saying, \"We ask for the worst, so we get the worst\", and went on to say \"Gervais acted like he was the one being made to suffer, but truly this misery is shared all around.\" Daniel D'Addario of Times also felt that the show was a \"bore\" and said, \"By the Globes' own standard, this year's show felt unbearably bogged down.\" However, The New York Times James Poniewozik reviewed the ceremony moderately saying: \"A well-run, fun Globes — privileged people toasting their terrific success with bottomless Moët — is its own corrective to Hollywood self-seriousness. Whereas the planned transgression of this one was less a stiff shot than small beer.\" The ceremony was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy/Variety (Music, Awards, Tributes) – Specials, but lost out to ''Triumph's Election Special 2016''.\nRatings\nThe ceremony averaged a Nielsen 5.5 ratings/13 share, and was watched by 18.5 million viewers. The ratings was an eleven percent decline from the previous ceremony's viewership of 19.3 million, the second highest in a decade.\nSee also\n* 21st Critics' Choice Awards\n* 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 36th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 69th British Academy Film Awards\n* 88th Academy Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160106093915/http://goldenglobe2016.com/ Golden Globes 2016]\n*\n*"
