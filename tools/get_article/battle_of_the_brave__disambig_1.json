Right now the local authorities have discovered illegal affairs of his recently inherited company and they hold him responsible.\nFrançois hides in the woods among friendly Indians and lets them deliver a letter to Marie-Loup.

The priest tells Marie-Loup she had been forsaken by François and persuades her to marry Xavier. The desperate Marie-Loup complies with the ceremony but then refuses Xavier his conjugal rights.\nAfter she has done so for weeks, Xavier visits François in his hideout. He blames his rival for his misfortune and following a fierce fight he leaves him for dead. On his return to Marie-Loup the still furious Xavier utters threats. He does not survive this day.\nXavier's comrades refuse to accept Xavier's death as an accident. Marie-Loup gets accused of murder and witchcraft. François fails to save her and only gets himself arrested.
