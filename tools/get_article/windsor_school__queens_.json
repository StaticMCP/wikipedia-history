It is a day school for local and international students.\nThe school certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to issue the Form I-20, which gives a student the opportunity to apply for a F-1 Visa. It is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and is a member of the New York State Association of Independent Schools (NYSAIS) and NY Parents League.\nThe academic program includes Advanced Placement (AP) classes, many electives in English and Social Sciences, and the opportunity for students to join the school's top-ranked New York Mathematics League math team.  The art department offers students the opportunity to take Advanced Placement (AP) Studio Art: Drawing or 2-D Design, in addition to creative crafts and experimental art electives.\nThe athletics department includes soccer, tennis, basketball, and track and field.  The school's athletes compete in the Metro League, which comprises private schools throughout the New York City metropolitan area.\nDuring the 1990s Windsor topped the NYS Math League, tying Stuyvesant and Christ the King. They also have had the highest average ACT scores. The founder, Martin A Cohen taught at Queens College and authored the plastic \"Study Guides\" that covered mathematics. Both Cohen (mathematics) and Co-founder Phillip A Stewart (social studies) were department heads at Bayside High School when student AND teacher turmoil drove them to go on their own. The Free Synagogue of Flushing underwent turmoil of its own and split off to form Young Israel of Fresh Meadows, whereby their newly built school building was vacant during the day, giving Windsor an inexpensive new building to rent at a very low rate. Early on, Windsor School faced issues with labor organizers (199 N.L.R.B. 457 1972) and so would only hire teachers for one year at a time. Windsor's founders were closely aligned with the school discipline movement of Howard Hurwitz and Genevieve Sanchez-Klein, the latter having worked for Cohen and run for Assembly in Bayside. (See The Best of Hurwitz on Education, 1991). Windsor also donated heavily to the Flushing Boys Club and so was allowed to use the facilities for gym classes two afternoons a week. Cohen would love to preach his teaching methods, even to students and strangers. He often confided he could afford to pay competitive salaries but not benefits. So, he developed a superb teacher training method and was bursting with pride about his former teachers becoming department head and principals elsewhere - as they, too were his students. A former student who went on to study for the MBA in the Ivy Leagues remarked that everything Tom Peters wrote in \"In Search of Excellence\", was practiced by Windsor.\nReferences"
