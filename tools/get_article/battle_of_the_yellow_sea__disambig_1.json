In the Russian Navy, it was referred to as the Battle of 10 August. The battle foiled an attempt by the Russian fleet at Lüshunkou (Port Arthur) to break out and form up with the Vladivostok squadron, forcing them to return to port. Four days later, the Battle off Ulsan similarly ended the Vladivostok group's sortie, forcing both fleets to remain at anchor.\nBackground\nThe Imperial Russian Navy's First Pacific Squadron (Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft) had been trapped in Lüshunkou (Port Arthur) since the Imperial Japanese Navy blockade began on 8 February 1904 with the Battle of Port Arthur. In July and early August, as the Imperial Japanese Army laid siege to Port Arthur, relations between Vitgeft and the Russian Viceroy Yevgeni Alekseyev soured. Alekseyev, a former admiral, favored an aggressive sortie so as to enable the First Pacific Squadron to link up with the Vladivostok Squadron to create a naval force powerful enough to challenge the Japanese fleet. Admiral Vitgeft believed in a fleet in being, which simply stayed at anchor, while at the same time contributing some of his weaponry to the Siege of Port Arthur as the safest course to follow.\nAlthough passive, Vitgeft's preference was actually more in keeping with the Russian Navy's doctrine, which was building up strength (waiting for the arrival of the Baltic Fleet, also known as the 2nd Pacific Squadron), and then engaging the Japanese navy in decisive battle. After several exchanges of letters in which both insisted on their demand, Alexeyev turned to Tsar Nicholas II, who replied to him by telegraph: \"I fully share your opinion that it is important for the squadron to break through quickly from Port Arthur to Vladivostok.\" After Alexeyev had warned Withöft of the possible legal consequences if he did not comply with the Tsar's order, Vitgeft finally yielded.\nPrelude\nMost of the ships' guns that were still in working order were hastily replaced; but even after recovering everything that could be salvaged from the batteries ashore, as well as the guns of the ships that were to remain at Port Arthur, the squadron was still short one 304 mm, ten 106 mm and twelve 12-pounder guns when it encountered the Japanese fleet. The work of replacing the armament and preparing for sea was fraught with difficulties as the Japanese bombarded the harbor. The Russian fleet consisted of the ships of the line Tsesarevich, Vitgeft's flagship, Retvizan, Pobeda, Peresvet, Sevastopol and Poltava as well as the four protected cruisers Askold, Pallada, Diana and Nowik and 14 torpedo boats. The Japanese ships under Admiral Tōgō were part of the 1st Fleet (第一艦隊, Dai-ichi Kantai) and were composed of the 1st Division consisting of Mikasa, Asahi, Fuji and Shikishima, plus the armored cruisers Nisshin and Kasuga detached from the 5th Division , the 3rd Division (Vice Admiral Dewa Shigetō) consisting of Yakumo, Chitose, Kasagi and Takasago, the 5th Division (Rear Admiral Yamada) consisting of Matsushima, Itsukushima and Hashidate, the 6th Division (Rear Admiral Togo) consisting of Akashi, Suma, Chiyoda, Idzumi, and Akitsushima. In addition, Admiral Tōgō had 18 destroyers and 29 torpedo boats at his disposal.\nBattle\nOpening moves\nOn the morning of , Vitgeft's squadron left the port of Port Arthur to break through the Japanese blockade and head for Vladivostok. At 9:00 a.m., the entire fleet slowly sailed out to sea, initially in line abeam to clear the shipping channel of mines, following a course along the coast of the Shandong Peninsula. By 10:30, the Russian fleet had reached open sea, whereupon half of the torpedo boats returned to Port Arthur while the fleet took a southeasterly course and proceeded at a speed of . In the meantime, both fleets approached on a converging course and at about 11:30 the two main fleets came into view, only dimly visible through the thin haze. The leading ships were now about twelve nautical miles apart. The  led the Japanese fleet, followed by , , ,  and  in line ahead. As soon as they were directly in front of the enemy line, Admiral Tōgō had his ships simultaneously turn to port so that the Russian fleet was behind them.\nDuring this time, Admiral Dewa's four cruisers (Chitose, Takasago, Yakumo and Kasagi) came into view, fast approaching from the south at , and Tōgō attempted to squeeze Admiral Vitgeft's fleet between the two advancing columns. Just after 13:00, Tōgō attempted to cross Vitgeft's T and commenced firing his main batteries from the extreme range of more than .\nVitgeft, with the battleship Retvizan, returned fire, but the range was excessive for both sides and no hits were scored. Tōgō had miscalculated his speed when trying to cross the T and Vitgeft simply made a quick turn to port, maintained his speed, and increased his range from Tōgō's fleet. Within minutes, Vitgeft was again headed for the open sea and Tōgō's pincer move had failed, as Admiral Dewa's cruisers had to turn quickly to avoid Tōgō's battleline, and thus broke contact without having fired a shot. As Tōgō observed Vitgeft's battleline swiftly move past his own in opposite directions, he quickly ordered each warship to turn about individually, which put his cruisers into the lead, but now parallel with Vitgeft's battle line.\nAt about 13:25, and again at a range of over , Tōgō's battleships opened fire on Vitgeft's flagship and Retvizan, hitting the latter 12 times. By about 13:30 the Russian flagship had returned fire, knocking out Tōgō's wireless communications with two  shell direct hits at this extreme range. For nearly half an hour the two battleship fleets pounded each other, slowly closing their range, until by 14:05 they reached about , at which time both fleets let loose with their secondary  guns. As the fleets continued to pound each other with all available guns, Tōgō's flagship was beginning to feel its wounds, and he tried to turn his vessel a bit, due to the hits she was taking (she ended up being hit 20 times), and urgently tried to have his cruisers engage the Russian battleline. But with his radio shot out, he had to rely on flag signals and radio relays from accompanying warships.\nStern chases\nThe Japanese cruisers had re-established contact with the Russian battleline, but were quickly driven off by their 305&nbsp;mm gunfire. Both battlefleets were maintaining about , but again, Vitgeft had managed to get past Tōgō, and the Japanese were forced to commence a stern chase. By 14:45 the Japanese flagship had closed to within about  of the trailing battleship Poltava, which had been unable to maintain her fleet's speed of  due to engine trouble. Mikasa and Asahi soon began to pound Poltava, scoring several hits. Admiral Ukhtomsky in the battleship Peresvet observed the plight of Poltava and ordered his division to fall back and help Poltava, and they began concentrating their gunfire onto Mikasa and Asahi. With Admiral Ukhtomsky's division firing, coupled with Poltava rejoining of the fight, Mikasa and Asahi began taking too many hits, and upon the urging of his chief of staff, Tōgō used his superior speed to break contact, race ahead of Vitgeft's fleet, and try to re-establish contact again under more favorable conditions. By 15:20 the range was opened and the firing ceased.\nAs the battleships had broken contact, Admiral Dewa with his cruisers attempted to get into action, when suddenly the Russian battleships opened up on him. At about 15:40 one  shell hit Dewa's armored cruiser, , from a range of over , which was well out of range of his  guns. Admiral Dewa decided against having his four Japanese cruisers engage with any Russian battleships. By this time, only Tōgō's six warships (four battleships and two armored cruisers) were chasing Vitgeft's 10 warships (six battleships and four cruisers).With darkness only three hours away, Admiral Vitgeft believed that he had outranged Admiral Tōgō, and would lose him totally when darkness came. Tōgō knew this too, and ordered a  speed to catch up to the tail end of Vitgeft's fleet. By 17:35 hours Tōgō's warships had closed to within  of the again-lagging battleship Poltava, and opened fire upon her.\nAdmiral Dewa also showed up with his cruisers, and Tōgō ordered all battleships and cruisers to shell Poltava, hoping to at least sink one Russian battleship. However, the commanding officer of Poltava, Captain Ivan P. Uspenskiy, and his crewmen scored several hits on Admiral Tōgō's flagship. At this time, the Shimose shells loaded inside the  guns began detonating prematurely inside the hot gun barrels; knocking out of action one  gun on Shikishima at 17:45, and two  barrels on Asahi at 18:10 hours. By 18:30, Tōgō had only 11 of his original 16  still in action.\nHand-off\nAlthough the range had dropped to about 3 miles, the secondary batteries of 155 and 203&nbsp;mm guns were still ineffective, and Poltava and Peresvet, although heavily damaged, were still with the Russian battleline. By 18:30, Tōgō was still having trouble controlling his battleship's gunfire; Shikishima and Asahi were blasting away at the crippled Poltava, Fuji was shooting at Pobeda and Peresvet, while the flagship Mikasa was duelling with the Russian flagship Tsesarevich. No IJN warships were shooting at the Russian battleships Retvizan and Sevastopol, which allowed them to freely blast away at Mikasa. With darkness only 30 minutes away, the Japanese flagship Mikasa almost no longer combat effective, and Russian gunfire seemingly becoming more accurate and effective with each cannon shot; the flagship signaled to Asahi to take over (known as a battle handoff) the shooting upon the lead Russian battleship. Within 10 minutes of being relieved by Asahi, Admiral Tōgō fired a 305&nbsp;mm salvo into the Russian flagship Tsesarevich, instantly killing Admiral Vitgeft and his immediate staff, and jamming the flagship's steering wheel. The explosion had wedged the wheel into a port turn, sharp enough so that Tsesarevich heeled over 12 degrees. Retvizan, which was unaware of the situation on the flagship, followed in her wake. \"By the time Pobeda arrived at the turning point, Tsesarevich had swung around 180 degrees and was heading back into her own line. With no signal to indicate what had happened, the other ships were unaware that Tsesarevich was not only out of control and without its admiral, but was actually without anyone at all in command.\"\nCharge of Retvizan\nPrince Pavel Ukhtomsky of the battleship Peresvet soon realized that the flagship was out of action, and attempted to gain control of the Russian squadron. But a Japanese shell, falling wide, cut the foremast of Peresvet, preventing the signal flags from being hoisted as usual; they had to be hoisted along the bridge instead. Being thus almost hidden from view, the signal apparently was only seen on Sevastopol; no other Russian capital ships followed Ukhtomsky's lead.\nAt the same time Captain Eduard Schensnovich commanding Retvizan, immediately turned his battleship towards Tōgō's battleline, charging directly into it with all weapons firing, despite being down by the bow from battle damage. Tōgō's battleline shifted their fire onto Retvizan as the range dropped to less than three miles. There were so many shell splashes surrounding the charging battleship, that Japanese gunners were unable to adjust their fire. However, as Tōgō's battleships were running low on 305&nbsp;mm shells, and many of his main guns were out of action, he decided to play it safe, and with the Russian squadron scattered, he turned the fight over to his cruisers and destroyers.\nAs Tōgō's ships began their turn, they fired a final salvo, hitting the enemy battleship with several shells, one of which seriously wounded Captain Schensnovich in the stomach. Retvizan laid smoke and also began to turn away, but the battleship had effectively ended the duel between the opposing pre-dreadnoughts, and had saved the flagship from destruction. There was little choice but to give up the attempt to reach Vladivostok and to return to Port Arthur. Even this proved impossible to coordinate, and many ships wandered off on their own.\nTwo hours later, the bulk of the Russian fleet returned to the relative safety of Port Arthur. Five battleships, a cruiser and ten destroyers made it back. The damaged Tsesarevich and three escorting destroyers sailed to Kiaochou, where they were interned by German authorities. The cruiser Askold and another destroyer sailed to Shanghai and were likewise interned by Chinese authorities. The cruiser Diana escaped to Saigon, where it was interned by the French. Only the small cruiser Novik sailed east around the Japanese home islands to try to reach Vladivostok. On 20 August, Japanese cruisers forced the ship aground at Sakhalin, where it was destroyed by the crew after engaging the Japanese at the Battle of Korsakov.\nAnalysis\nThe Battle of the Yellow Sea was naval history's first major confrontation between modern steel battleship fleets, so with the exception of Admiral Tōgō's 20-minute duel with Russian Admiral Stark's battleships at Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, both Vitgeft and Tōgō were new to fighting modern steel battleship fleet actions.\nAlthough Admiral Oskar Starck had been replaced by Admiral Stepan Makarov shortly after the Port Arthur battle, Makarov in turn was replaced by Vitgeft, following Makarov's death in April 1904, when his battleship  blew up and sank in the Yellow Sea, after striking mines. Had Admiral Starck remained in command at the time of the Yellow Sea battle, Admirals Tōgō and Starck would have met on equal terms, both retaining about equal combat experience in battleship fleet actions. But the naval force that Tōgō was to meet at Tsushima the following year was not the same type of battle fleet that he engaged at the Yellow Sea either. Though Admiral Vitgeft was new, many of his men were not, most of them were veterans of Far East duty, with some of them veterans of the 1900 Boxer Rebellion in China; thus they were a highly experienced fighting force.\nRangefinders and gunnery\nDuring the late 1890s, it was thought that around  would be the norm for battleship engagements due to the limitations of the gun sights and rangefinders available at the time, even though the  guns usually mounted to battleships of the period had a considerably longer range. In the Yellow Sea engagement, the Russian battleships had Lugeol rangefinders with a range of , while Japanese pre-dreadnoughts had the latest (1903) Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders, which had a range of . As a result, the naval world was quite surprised after the Yellow Sea combatants opened fire upon one another and scored hits while still over  apart.\nThe Yellow Sea engagement lasted some 6 to 7 hours, with about 4 of those hours being direct combat. During those nearly four hours of fighting, roughly 7,382 rounds were expended by both sides, ranging in size from 155 to 305&nbsp;mm shells. Of those 7,382 shells fired, approximately 5,956 had been from 155&nbsp;mm guns; 3,592 from the Imperial Japanese Navy, and 2,364 from the Imperial Russian Navy. 307 203&nbsp;mm shells had been fired by the Japanese Navy and none by the Russian fleet. Admiral Vitgeft's fleet had expended 224 254&nbsp;mm shells compared to Tōgō's 33 shells. The long range gunnery duel that had commenced at a range of over 8 miles, and which began with 305&nbsp;mm main gun fire, ended with 305&nbsp;mm gun fire in near darkness, during which time 862 305&nbsp;mm main gun rounds were fired; 259 from the Russian battleships, and 603 from the Japanese battleships.\nBattle damage and casualties\nThe nearly seven hours of naval combat coupled with the estimated 7,382 fired shells had produced a hit rate of 1.7%. Schensnovich charged his battleship into Admiral Tōgō's battleline, thus ending the battleship fleet duel and saving the Russian flagship from destruction. Schensnovich later died from his wounds received in January 1911, at the age of 57.\nDamage and casualties included the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=col| Battleship\n! scope=col style=\"width:110px;\"| Primary armament\n! scope=col style=\"width:80px;\"| Waterline armor (inches)\n! scope=col| Year launched\n! scope=col| Builder\n! scope=col| Damage sustained\n! scope=col| Casualties\n|-\n| , (Flagship)\n| 4 × 12-inch guns 12 × 6-inch guns\n|\n| 1901\n| Toulon, France\n| 13 305&nbsp;mm gun hits and two 203&nbsp;mm hits || 12 crewmen killed and 47 crewmen wounded.

The other units were scattered in the darkness and sought out neutral ports, where they were interned until the end of the war. The heavily damaged battleship Zessarewitsch (Tsesarevich) arrived at Tsingtau with the three Kit-class destroyers Besposchtschadni, Besschumni and Besstraschni, where the ships were interned by the German authorities. Novik also stopped briefly at Tsingtau, but left again to attempt to reach Vladivostok according to the original plan. She was confronted by Japanese cruisers off Korsakow and finally sank herself off Sakhalin. The damaged Askold, flagship of Rear Admiral Reitzenstein, who commanded the cruisers, sailed to Shanghai, where the destroyer Grosowoi, which had initially accompanied Diana, also arrived later. Both were interned by China under Japanese pressure until peace was concluded with Japan. Diana sailed via Haiphong to Saigon until 23 August, where the ship was interned. The torpedo boat Ryeshitelni, which had sailed for Chifu, was confiscated by the Japanese after neither disarmament nor the intention to return to sea were apparent there.\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*  |volume=I |publisher=His Majesty’s Stationery Office |location=London |date=1910 |oclc=770006305}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  |title=International law topics and discussions, 1905 |year=1906 |publisher=Naval War College Government Printing Office |location=Washington |oclc=}}\n* }}\nFurther reading\n*\n*  revised and expanded edition of \"The War of the Rising Sun and Tumbling Bear\" (1988/1991)\n*\n*\n*\n*"
