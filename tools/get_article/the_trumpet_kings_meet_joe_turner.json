Often, the jazzers pushed Turner to fresh rhythmic heights of traditional 12-bar iambic pentameter. But just as typically, his incisive vocal work also inspired gritty, more soulful thoughts from the household-named horn players.\"\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Joe Turner except as indicated\n# \"Mornin', Noon and Night\" – 4:13\n# \"I Know You Love Me Baby\" – 15:48\n# \"TV Mama\" – 13:57\n# \"'Tain't Nobody's Bizness If I Do\" (Porter Grainger, Everett Robins) – 7:35\nPersonnel\n*Big Joe Turner – vocals\n*Dizzy Gillespie, Roy Eldridge, Harry \"Sweets\" Edison, Clark Terry  – trumpet\n*Pee Wee Crayton – guitar\n*Jimmy Robins – piano\n*Chuck Norris – bass\n*Washington Rucker – drums\nReferences"
