Hayes\n|after_party  = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 1876 United States presidential election in South Carolina took place on November 7, 1876, as part of the 1876 United States presidential election. Voters chose 7 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nSouth Carolina voted for the Republican nominee, Rutherford B. Hayes, over the Democratic nominee, Samuel J. Tilden. Hayes won the state by a very narrow margin of 0.48%, only 889 votes. Events such as the Hamburg massacre served to dissuade many Republican voters. This would be the last time a Republican presidential candidate would win South Carolina until Barry Goldwater carried the state in 1964.\nThe results here, along with Florida and Louisiana, were strongly disputed due to the suppression of African-American voters in the state. The results in this state were determined through the Compromise of 1877, which awarded Hayes South Carolina and the election. Had Tilden won South Carolina, he would have won the election.\nDue to Jim Crow laws disenfranchising many Black voters as well as some poor white voters, the total vote count of 182,683 votes cast in this election would not be surpassed until 1952, 76 years later, after the poll tax had been repealed. In fact, between 1884 and 1928, the total vote did not even pass 100,000.\nThe election in South Carolina was the oddest of the ones in Louisiana, Florida, and the other disputed state Oregon because the results showed over 101% of all registered voters turned out to vote for President.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
