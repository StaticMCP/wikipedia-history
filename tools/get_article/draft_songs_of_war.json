      "text": "# Draft:Songs of War\n\nSongs of War is a Minecraft-based fantasy animation series created by Black Plasma Studios, now Squared Media, and directed by David R. B. The series was released in 2019 and 2020 and has since garnered a large following despite being discontinued since 2020.\nProduction\nThe idea for something like Songs of War began to circulate around Black Plasma Studios in 2011, but they could not decide on a game to utilize until 2015. David says work began in late 2015, when he first began making Minecraft animations. He streamed the creation of the world in WorldPainter on his personal channel in December 2015. Building presumably began straight after this, and writing and skin/weapon design possibly also began in 2015.\nA lot of the set design on the world was done in 2016 by the SoW build team, and was later showcased in a video on 9 October. Production continued as normal and the script and world were mostly completed, so animation began. David started recruiting other animators to help with some scenes in January, upon realising that animating all of it himself would take too long.\nCast\nMain Cast\n* Carl G. Brooks as Thalleous Sendaris and Galleous Sendaris\n* Lucas Webley as Tygren\n* Tom Aglio as Senn\n* Stephen J. Pena as Lucan\n* Elissa \"Yuriastellise\" Woo as Abbigail\n* Allison Seils as Niika\n* Jackson Trent as Igneous\nRelease\nOn 4 August, the first reveal trailer was released, showing Tygren Voltaris, a Song, The End, a dragon egg and redesigned undead as cryptic hints for the plot. This trailer was likely only made for the 3&nbsp;million subscriber special. On 16 November, the second trailer was released, showing the plot in much more detail and featuring dialogue from several characters. On 23 November, Episode 1 was officially released, with the Behind-the-Scenes video following soon after. A mid-season break took place between Episodes 5 and 6, to transition from releasing episodes every 2 weeks to every week. The final episode of Season 1 was released on March 28, followed by the full movie on April 11. The series and full movie are still available on YouTube.\nEpisodes\n* Episode One: November 23, 2019\n* Episode Two: December 7, 2019\n* Episode Three: December 21, 2019\n* Episode Four: January 4, 2020\n* Episode Five: January 18, 2020\n* Episode Six: February 29, 2020\n* Episode Seven: March 7, 2020\n* Episode Eight: March 14, 2020\n* Episode Nine: March 21, 2020\n* Episode Ten: March 28, 2020\n* Full Movie: April 11, 2020\nViewership\nThe series can be considered a massive success on YouTube. The series received a lot of attention especially since the episodes were released just as the COVID-19 Pandemic caused most to remain home and utilise online methods of communication and entertainment. The series is rated 8.6/10 on IMDb. As of July, 2025, the series has garnered over 86&nbsp;million views on YouTube (with the full movie included).\nCancellation\nOn June 14, 2020, it was officially announced by Black Plasma Studios that the planned Seasons 2 and 3 were cancelled. The decision was made due to a variety of reasons from financial strains as well as the sheer time and energy needed to produce the 20 episodes to complete the series. However, in 2025, a spinoff series was announced by Black Plasma Studios who since 2023 has rebranded to Squared Media following the stepping down of David R.B.\nReferences"
