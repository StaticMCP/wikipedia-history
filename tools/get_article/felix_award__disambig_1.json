The idea belonged to the first president of ADISQ, Gilles Talbot. The award trophy was created by Marc-André Parisé.\nThe awards are named in honour of Quebec songwriter Félix Leclerc.\nIn contrast to the Juno Awards, whose nominations are based partially on record sales, nominations and winners of the Félix are decided by ADISQ members. The awards are given during an annual ceremony \"Gala de l'ADISQ\". Among the categories are Best-selling album, Best album (in various music genres), Songwriter of the year, Composer of the year, Song of the year, Male/Female singer of the year, Discovery of the year, Show of the year, etc.\nThe awards have sometimes been controversial. In 1983, songwriter Luc Plamondon attracted controversy by using his acceptance speech to denounce copyright law. In 1991, Céline Dion publicly refused the Félix for anglophone artist of the year for her English-language album Unison, not considering herself an anglophone artist. Instead she suggested to ADISQ to create a new award category for an artist who achieved the most success internationally. The next year such category was indeed created : Most successful artist performing in a language other than French (\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ceremony\n!width=\"15%\"|Date\n!Hosts\n|-\n|1st Felix Awards\n|September 23, 1979\n|Dominique Michel, Denise Filiatrault\n|-\n|2nd Felix Awards\n|October 5, 1980\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|3rd Felix Awards\n|October 4, 1981\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|4th Felix Awards\n|October 3, 1982\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|5th Felix Awards\n|October 30, 1983\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|6th Felix Awards\n|October 28, 1984\n|Jean-Pierre Ferland\n|-\n|7th Felix Awards\n|October 27, 1985\n|Jean-Guy Moreau\n|-\n|8th Felix Awards\n|October 26, 1986\n|Serge Thériault, Claude Meunier\n|-\n|9th Felix Awards\n|October 25, 1987\n|André-Philippe Gagnon\n|-\n|10th Felix Awards\n|October 23, 1988\n|Denise Filiatrault, Dominique Michel, Yvon Deschamps, Jean-Pierre Ferland, Jean-Guy Moreau, Serge Thériault, Claude Meunier, André-Philippe Gagnon\n|-\n|11th Felix Awards\n|October 15, 1989\n|Michel Rivard\n|-\n|12th Felix Awards\n|October 21, 1990\n|Michel Rivard\n|-\n|13th Felix Awards\n|October 14, 1991\n|René Simard\n|-\n|14th Felix Awards\n|October 18, 1992\n|René Simard\n|-\n|15th Felix Awards\n|October 17, 1993\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|16th Felix Awards\n|October 16, 1994\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|17th Felix Awards\n|November 5, 1995\n|Patrick Huard\n|-\n|18th Felix Awards\n|November 3, 1996\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|19th Felix Awards\n|October 26, 1997\n|Yvon Deschamps\n|-\n|20th Felix Awards\n|November 1, 1998\n|Céline Dion, René Simard, Jean-Pierre Ferland, André-Philippe Gagnon\n|-\n|21st Felix Awards\n|October 31, 1999\n|Véronique Cloutier\n|-\n|22nd Felix Awards\n|November 4, 2000\n|Guy A.
