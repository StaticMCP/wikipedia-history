Russell Award is presented annually by the\nLimnogeology Division of the Geological Society of America for major achievements in limnogeology--broadly defined and including limnogeology, limnology and paleolimnology--through contributions in research, teaching and service.   The award is named in honor of geologist Israel C. Russell (1852–1906), a leading pioneer\nin geomorphology and glacial geology. Russell's seminal work on pluvial stages of Lake Lahontan\nand Mono Lake (later named pluvial \"Lake Russell\" in recognition of his work) utilized field observations of shoreline deposits, sediments preserved in outcrop, terraces, and moraines to infer lake basin history and may be considered to be the first limnogeological studies.\nRussell was employed as a United States Geological Survey geologist for much of his career, continuing as a seasonal employee even after he joined\nthe faculty of the University of Michigan. He was serving as President\nof the Geological Society of America at the time of his death.\nAward winners\nSource:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year!!Name!!Affiliation\n|-\n|2010||William Last\n|University of Manitoba\n|-\n|2011||W.
