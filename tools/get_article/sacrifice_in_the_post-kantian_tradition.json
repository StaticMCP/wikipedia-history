In other words, this conception of sacrifice can be seen in the works of most of the thinkers of the post-Kantian tradition.\nBubbio argues that the very possibility of a “realm of reason” made up by values and norms depends on the recognition of “the other” as another human being. Particularly he emphasizes the reciprocal connection of the Hegel's recognition-theoretic approach and his emphasis on kenotic sacrifice, both of which are evidence of his belonging to perspectivism. Bubbio takes this kind of perspectivism as a fundamental feature of the post-Kantian tradition.\nReception\nSacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition was reviewed by the philosophers Gianni Vattimo, Chris Fleming, Mark Alznauer, and Patrick Stokes.\nVattimo writes: \"… Bubbio’s book is an important philosophical work: not only as an excellent analysis of sacrifice in the post-Kantian tradition but also—and perhaps especially—because it confronts what is more alive in contemporary philosophy in a clear and productive way.\"\nFleming writes: \"Bubbio’s particular talent is for re-excavating the history of Western philosophy and asking us to see anew things that we have read before.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5889-sacrifice-in-the-post-kantian-t.aspx Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition]"
