The  monument is administered by the National Park Service.\nat Tule Springs Fossil Beds NM]]\nThe national monument is located in the Upper Las Vegas Wash and protects part of the Tule Springs.  The wash area also includes several patches of the rare Las Vegas bear poppy. The land was designated after a local campaign to permanently protect the landscape as a national monument.\nPaleontology\nPaleontology studies began at Tule Springs in 1933 when the bones of a Columbian mammoth were discovered by quarry workers. Other fossils found at the site include Camelops, ground sloth, dire wolf, Teratornis, Smilodon Fatalis and American lion, and range from 7,000 to 250,000 years old.\nLegislation\nThe Tule Springs Fossil Beds passed both houses of Congress in December 2014 and signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 19, 2014, under Section 3092(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2015.\nHiking and trails\nThe Tule Springs Fossil Beds have two official and temporary trails.  One is the Tule Springs loop, a flat 1.7-mile loop around the first fossil bed, and the second is the Tule Springs long loop, a 2.3-mile loop around the entire fossil bed, which has the hiker climbing over the fossil bed.  These trails are accessible at the north end of N. Durango Drive.\nSee also\n* List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nps.gov/tusk/index.htm Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument]\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/ruggybear/albums/72157716935968812 Photo gallery from the Monument], free Creative Commons photos."
