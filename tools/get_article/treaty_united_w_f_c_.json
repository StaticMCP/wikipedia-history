The club was founded in 2020 in the place of Limerick W.F.C. following their financial collapse. They play in the League of Ireland Premier Division, the top tier of football in Ireland, and play their home matches at the Markets Field, the same ground as their predecessors.\nHistory\nFollowing the liquidation of Limerick F.C., the idea of a new team in Limerick arose. At first, it was to be called Limerick United but was forced to be changed due to the threat of legal action from Limerick FC, because they had previously had that name. The club name refers to Limerick's nickname of the Treaty City, due to the 1691 Treaty of Limerick and Treaty Stone. Treaty United was confirmed as the name, and the women's team was ready to enter the 2020 Women's National League season and the men's in the 2020 League of Ireland First Division, but the men's team pulled out of the 2020 season. The women's team, however, was ready for the season but had to wait until August because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They started their season on 8 August 2020 against reigning champions Peamount United, losing 5–0.\nPlayers\nCurrent squad\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://treatyunitedfc.com/womens-senior/ Senior women's squad] on the Treaty United FC site\n* [https://treatyunitedfc.com/womens_fixtures/  Senior women's fixtures] on the Treaty United FC site"
