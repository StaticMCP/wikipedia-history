On the right wing were 6,000 Sipahis and Karaman Governor Hüsrev Pasha. On the left wing were 4,000 to 6,000, mostly irregular Kurdish cavalry. The plan was to defend against the Safavid cavalry with firepower, as in the Battle of Chaldıran, and then counterattack with cavalry after the enemy's formation was broken.\nSafavids\nUstaclu Kara Han divided his army into two and took the left wing himself. He gave the Baghdad Governor Kangırıl Sultan to the right wing. Realizing that he would not be able to face the Ottoman artillery and the Janissaries with rifles, Kara Han intended to repel the wing cavalry and take the center in a pincer.\nReferences"
