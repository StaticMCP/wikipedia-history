      "text": "# Aboriginal cultures of Western Australia\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the land now known as Western Australia was home to a diverse range of traditional Australian Aboriginal cultures, spread across numerous language groups, many of which remain today.\nThe border delimiting Western Australia from South Australia and the Northern Territory was drawn by the British colonists, at the 129th meridian east, without regard to the boundaries of existing Aboriginal groups. Consequently Aboriginal cultural groupings are not limited by it; some \"Western Australian\" Aboriginal groups extend across the border into other states.\nCulture groups\nGrouping the various peoples of Western Australia, the largest of these groups being called \"culture blocs\", is a subjective endeavour often done by anthropologists. Groupings have been made that do not reflect how the Aboriginal peoples included in the groupings saw themselves, one example being the \"aggregation of clan groups in north-east Arnhem Land who lack a single name for themselves\", but whom Warner collectively labels the \"Murngin\".\nIn Western Australia, some large cultural blocs that are well attested are: Noongar, Western Desert cultural bloc, Kimberley peoples and Yamatji. Of these, Noongar and Yamatji are (at least post-colonisation) often self-identified, with the former being a cultural system that has existed prior to colonisation. Western Desert cultural bloc refers to a dialect continuum which contains many communities that before colonisation recognised \"their own dialectical affiliations, and [had] no overall term for themselves\". The Kimberley peoples are a collection of smaller cultural blocs in the region.\nKimberley region\nThe Kimberley region is linguistically complex, containing around 27 languages in 5 language groups. It is also one of the major rock art regions of Australia, as well as being a trading focus of pearl shell, shields, myths, rituals and body paint patterns.\nDue to the region's rugged terrain and distance from coloniser population centres, it was one of the last areas to be colonised; graziers began moving in in the 1880s. Colonisation was resisted in \"drawn-out guerilla warfare\" but many massacres still occurred. It was only in the 1920s, after the Forrest River massacre, that public outcry resulted in Aboriginal people being treated in a \"less brutal\" manner.\nAboriginal divers were often central to the region's pearling industry in the 19th century, this being a \"major platform for black-white relations\".\nThe peak Indigenous body in the region is the Kimberley Land Council.\nNoongar region\nThe Noongar people's homeland is the southwest corner of Western Australia. Dialects of the Noongar language were spoken across the region, estimates of the number of dialects range from 3 to 15.\nThe Noongar people exhibit a distinct material culture. Traditionally this includes wearing stitched kangaroo skin as an adaptation to the cool, moist winter climate, or using a particular style of axe and saw-like knife. Also constructed were temporary but waterproof semicircular dome huts made with a framework of tied branches and paperbark or grass-tree thatch.\nIntensive contact with Europeans began in 1825 with the founding of a military base at Mammang Koort (King George Sound) and with the subsequent colonisation of the Swan River area from 1829. By 1840, seven massacres had taken place; this includes the Pinjarra massacre, where fifteen to eighty Pinjarup Noongar people were killed. Pushed off their lands, Aboriginal communities survived around small towns in the southwest while maintaining familial ties across the region.\nIn 2022, the Noongar people began to be represented by six organisations known as \"Noongar Regional Corporations\", each representing a different region within Noongar Country. The South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council, previously the peak native title representative of the region, transitioned to provide administrative, corporate and financial services to the six Noongar Regional Corporations.\nWestern Desert region\nThe Western Desert cultural bloc covers much of Western Australia, as well as parts of South Australia and the Northern Territory, occupying area of approximately . The Western Desert language is a dialect continuum that extends over much of the region.\nA region of low rainfall and temporary rivers. Its aridity was a limiting factor on population densities, with areas of sandy desert potentially varying as low as one person per  to one person per  in regions with more permanent water sources. People would gather at permanent water sources in summer and spread out after rain. Waterholes are prominent features of the stories, songs and paintings of the peoples of the region.\nMission stations and pastoral properties greatly affected the Desert peoples who moved into them, creating large population centres, a number of which have come under Aboriginal control. There has also been an extensive outstation movement.\nYamatji region\nOriginally a Wajarri word for , it has become a general name for Aboriginal people from the northwestthe Murchison and Gascoyne districtsof Western Australia.\nThe peak representative body in the region is the Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation, which also represents those in the Pilbara.\nDrainage basins and culture blocs\nAustralia's major drainage basins have been found to correspond with the main culture blocs. This has been explained as a result of the basins' margins being poor in plant, animal and water resources; consequently there is less cultural exchange on their margins than in their interiors. Simultaneously, drainage basins are not understood to be a strong indicator of historical or social similarities, and are instead one of many elements used in the analysis of social and cultural dynamics.\nThere is also some correspondence between the traditional boundaries of language groups and Australia's bioregions.\nIdentity systems found in Western Australia\nIn moiety systems, members of the community take one of two identities, these being based on the identity/moiety of a parent and are known as filial moieties. In matrifilial moieties, the identity of the mother is adopted, while the identity of the father is adopted in patrifilial moieties. Moieties often shared the name of an animal or plant, these becoming one of a person's totems. There are also generational moieties, where, in addition to their filial moiety, a person has the moiety of their grandparents.\nIn general, moiety systems promoted marriage between certain identities. In patrifilial and matrifilial moieties, a person was meant to marry someone of the opposite moiety (exogamy). While in generational moieties, a person was meant to marry someone of the same moiety (endogamy). }} Land and water could also be classified by patrifilial moiety and peoples' roles in ceremonies could be determined by their moieties.\nNoongar\nMany of the Noongar peoples divided themselves into filial moieties named  (western corella people) and  (Australian raven people). being the Noongar name for the western corella,  for Australian raven and  for , , . }}\nIn the southwest, some groups were matrifilial and others were patrifilial. While knowledge of the full system of social categorisation over the entire region has been lost, according to anthropologist Ian Keen the Mineng at King George Sound people were matrifilial.\nFieldwork and interviews conducted in the early 2000s and mid-to-late 2010s has found that while knowledge of an original moiety system is limited, belief in totems remains strong and are a part of contemporary Noongar belief. The moiety system seems to have been replaced by a system that prohibits marriage between close family members, continues to promote totemic exogamy and which has \"ideal marriage\" rules.\nYamatji\n:* Nganda type: Patrilineal totemic local descent groups, no moieties or sections.

Includes Umedi, Wungemi, Worora, Wunumbul\nImpact of colonisation\nAboriginal traditional cultures have been greatly impacted since the colonisation of Australia began. During the late 19th and early 20th century it was assumed that Aboriginal Australians were a dying race and would eventually disappear.\nWhile Aboriginal populations in Western Australia did decline until the 1930s, they have since increased. Today, all Aboriginal cultures have been impacted by degrees of marginalisation and exclusion from participation in the dominant culture of Australia. This has resulted in higher than average rates of infant mortality, and lower life expectancy, education and rates of employment.\n191 Aboriginal languages have been documented in Western Australia, but  only 31 were spoken.\nSee also\n* Aboriginal history of Western Australia\n*Timeline of Aboriginal history of Western Australia\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n* |title=AustLang |url=https://collection.aiatsis.gov.au/austlang/search?search_api_views_fulltext=&field_centroid_latlon_op=-&field_centroid_latlon=&field_state_territory=WA&field_al_status=All |website=AIATSIS Collection |access-date=5 January 2024}}\n*\n* |year=2025 |title=Connection to Country |url=https://www.noongarculture.org.au/connection-to-country/ |website=Kaartdijin Noongar |publisher=South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council |access-date=25 April 2025 }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* |title=Noongar Lore |url=https://www.noongarculture.org.au/noongar-lore/ |website=Kaartdijin Noongar |access-date=5 October 2025}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* |last1=Ryan |first1=Lyndall |last2=Debenham |first2=Jennifer |last3=Pascoe |first3=Bill |last4=Smith |first4=Robyn |last5=Owen |first5=Chris |last6=Richards |first6=Jonathan |last7=Gilbert |first7=Stephanie |last8=Anders |first8=Robert J |last9=Usher |first9=Kaine |last10=Price |first10=Daniel |last11=Newley |first11=Jack |last12=Brown |first12=Mark |last13=Craig |first13=Hugh |year=2017–2025 |title=Pinjarra Massacre |website=Colonial Frontier Massacres, Australia, 1780 to 1930 |publisher=University of Newcastle |location=Newcastle |url=https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/detail.php?r=887 |access-date=2025-10-04 }}\n* |last1=Ryan |first1=Lyndall |last2=Debenham |first2=Jennifer |last3=Pascoe |first3=Bill |last4=Smith |first4=Robyn |last5=Owen |first5=Chris |last6=Richards |first6=Jonathan |last7=Gilbert |first7=Stephanie |last8=Anders |first8=Robert J |last9=Usher |first9=Kaine |last10=Price |first10=Daniel |last11=Newley |first11=Jack |last12=Brown |first12=Mark |last13=Craig |first13=Hugh |year=2017–2025 |title=Map |website=Colonial Frontier Massacres, Australia, 1780 to 1930 |publisher=University of Newcastle |location=Newcastle |url=https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/map.php |access-date=2025-10-04 }}\n*\nFurther reading\n*Bates, Daisy (1985) The native tribes of Western Australia (edited by Isobel White).
