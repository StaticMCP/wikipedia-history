Voters chose 3 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nAlaska was won by incumbent President George W. Bush by a 25.6% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all leading news organizations considered this a state Bush would win, or otherwise considered as a safe red state. It has voted for a Republican presidential nominee in every presidential election since statehood, except for 1964. As of the 2024 presidential election, this is the most recent time a presidential candidate has received over 60% of the vote in Alaska, as well as the last time that Bethel, Kusilvak, Yakutat, and Nome Census Areas voted for the Republican candidate.\nPrimaries\n*2004 Alaska Democratic presidential primary\nCampaign\nPredictions\nThere were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election.

This district, an at-large district because it covers the entire state, is thus equivalent to the statewide election results.\n{|class=wikitable\n! District\n! Bush\n! Kerry\n!

Alaska is allocated 3 electors because it has 1 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All were pledged to and voted for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.\n# Gloria J. Tokar\n# Frederick H. Hahn\n# Roberly R. Waldron\nSee also\n*United States presidential elections in Alaska\nReferences"
