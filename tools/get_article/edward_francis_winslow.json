Winslow participated in numerous Union Army campaigns of the Army of the Tennessee, including the siege of Vicksburg.\nEarly life\nWinslow was born on September 28, 1837, to his parents Stephen Winslow and Elizabeth Bass, in Augusta, Maine. Winslow was a descendant to Kenelm Winslow, an English pilgrim who traveled to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1629. Winslow was educated in the common schools of Augusta during his childhood. In the spring of 1856, Winslow traveled to Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where he entered the mercantile business.\nAmerican Civil War\nIn the fall of 1861, the American Civil War began, and Winslow enlisted as captain of Company F of the 4th Iowa Cavalry Regiment on October 14, 1861, being commissioned on October 24. On January 3, 1863, Winslow was promoted to major of the regiment. Winslow participated in the siege of Vicksburg, where he was posted to the rear of the siege lines to protect the army from Joseph E. Johnston's Confederate forces near Jackson, Mississippi. Winslow was promoted colonel of the 4th Iowa on July 4. For the next year, he commanded cavalry brigades in the Army of the Tennessee, being engaged in the battles of Meridian, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo. In October 1864, he commanded the 4th Brigade in Alfred Pleasonton's cavalry division during Price's Missouri Raid. He was wounded at the Battle of Westport, and command of his brigade passed to Frederick Benteen. A few days later, he returned to the field in command of a brigade in James H. Wilson's cavalry corps and fought at the battles of Selma and Columbus. After Union troops seized Columbus, he was placed in command of the city, where he led the destruction of the ironclad ram CSS Jackson (CSS Muscogee), as well as the arsenal, the armory, and many factories. Winslow received a brevet promotion to brigadier general, dated December 12, 1864. On April 16, 1865, Winslow commanded the 3rd Iowa Cavalry and 4th Iowa Cavalry in an assault during the Battle of Columbus, which is considered by many to be the last battle of the Civil War.\n}}\nSources\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\nSee also\n* Bradley Winslow, distant cousin who also served as a colonel in the Civil War and was also brevetted Brigadier General\n* Cleveland Winslow, distant cousin who also served as a colonel in the Civil War\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://aspace.lib.uiowa.edu/repositories/2/resources/412 Edward Francis Winslow's] papers are housed at the University of Iowa Libraries Special Collections & Archives"
