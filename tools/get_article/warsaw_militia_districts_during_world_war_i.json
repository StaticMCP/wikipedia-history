Through this expansion the territory of the city of Warsaw increased from 32.73 square kilometres to 114.83 square kilometres.\nIn 1908 Warsaw had been divided into circuits. The original 1908 circuits had their borders changed a number of times before World War I. As the German authorities reorganized the city administration, they converted the 15 existing circuits into Militia Districts (Commissariats I-XV) whilst creating 11 Militia Districts in the newly integrated areas of the city (Commissariats XVI-XXVI).\nReferences"
