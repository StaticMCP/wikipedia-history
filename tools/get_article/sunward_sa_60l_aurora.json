The aircraft is intended to be supplied as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.\nDesign and development\nThe Aurora was designed to comply with the US light-sport aircraft rules. It features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft's  span wing has a rectangular planform and employs flaps. The standard engine available is the Austrian-made  Rotax 912ULS four-stroke powerplant.\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China granted the design a type design approval in mid-2013.\nBayerl et al. note that the Aurora closely resembles the Fly Synthesis Texan, but that the manufacturer claims the Aurora is an original design.\nThe aircraft can be equipped for banner-towing, aerial photography and has an airshow smoke generation system available.\nIn July 2014 the company announced an improved version, the SA 60V, with an upgraded engines installation using Austrian, rather than Chinese components and an IFR capable instrument panel.\nThe design was added to the Federal Aviation Administration's list of approved special light-sport aircraft on 20 August 2019.\nOperational history\nReviewer Marino Boric described the design in a 2015 review as \"stylish\" and \"elegant\".\nVariants\n;SA 60L\n:Original model\n;SA 60V\n:Upgraded model with engine installation improvements and IFR instrumentation\nSpecifications (SA 60L Aurora)\n|prime units?=met\n|genhide=\n|crew=one\n|capacity=one passenger\n|length m=6.9\n|length ft=\n|length in=\n|length note=\n|span m=8.6\n|span ft=\n|span in=\n|span note=\n|height m=2.5\n|height ft=\n|height in=\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=11.8\n|wing area sqft=\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=340\n|empty weight lb=\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=600\n|gross weight lb=\n|gross weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Rotax 912ULS\n|eng1 type=four cylinder, liquid and air-cooled, four stroke aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=75\n|eng1 hp=\n|prop blade number=\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=220\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=73\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=270\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=1200\n|range miles=\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=4000\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=5.5\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=50.8\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=*Garmin Aero500\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
