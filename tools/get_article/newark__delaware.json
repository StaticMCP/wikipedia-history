It is located  west-southwest of Wilmington. According to the 2010 census, the population of the city is 31,454. The University of Delaware is located here. The city constitutes part of the Delaware Valley, and the Philadelphia metropolitan area.\nHistory\nNewark was founded in 1694 by Scots-Irish and Welsh settlers. It was officially established in 1758 when it received a charter from George II of Great Britain.\nSchools have played a significant role in the history of Newark. A grammar school, founded by Francis Alison in 1743, moved from New London, Pennsylvania to Newark in 1765, becoming the Newark Academy. Among the first graduates of the school were three signers of the Declaration of Independence: George Read, Thomas McKean, and James Smith. Two of these, Read and McKean, went on to have schools named after them in the state of Delaware: George Read Middle School and Thomas McKean High School.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, British and American forces clashed outside Newark at the Battle of Cooch's Bridge. Tradition holds that the Battle of Cooch's Bridge was the first instance of the Stars and Stripes being flown in battle.\nThe state granted a charter to a new school in 1833, which was called Newark College. Newark Academy and Newark College joined together in the following year, becoming Delaware College. The school was forced to close in 1859, but was resuscitated eleven years later under the Morrill Act when it became a joint venture between the State of Delaware and the school's board of Ttustees. In 1913, under the legislative Act, Delaware College came into sole ownership of the State of Delaware. The school was renamed the University of Delaware in 1921.\nNewark received a license from King George II to hold semi-annual fairs and weekly markets for agricultural exchange in 1758. A paper mill, the first sizable industrial venture in Newark, was created around 1798. This mill, eventually known as the Curtis Paper Mill, was the oldest paper mill in the United States until its closing in 1997. Methodists built the first church in 1812, and the railroad arrived in 1837.\nOne of Newark's major sources of employment and revenue was the Chrysler Newark Assembly plant, which was built in 1951. Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley worked as an assembly-line worker at the plant during his short stint in Delaware in the 1960s. Originally constructed to build tanks for the US Army, the plant was 3.4 million square feet in size. It employed 1,100 employees in 2008, which was down from 2,115 in 2005. This turn was due largely to the decline in sales of the Durango and Aspen vehicle models that were being produced. The plant stood for more than 50 years, providing jobs and revenue to the state of Delaware. The factory produced a wide variety of automobile models during its run. The plant was closed in late 2008 due to the recession and limited demand for larger cars.\nGeography\nNewark is located directly east of the Maryland state line, adjacent to the unincorporated community of Fair Hill, and is less than one mile south of the tripoint where Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania meet, known as The Wedge.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Originally surrounded by farmland, Newark is now surrounded by housing developments in some directions, although farmland remains just over the state lines in Maryland and Pennsylvania. To the north and west are small hills, but south and east of the city, the land is flat (part of Newark falls in the Piedmont geological region, and part of the city is in the Coastal Plain geological region, as is the majority of the land in the State of Delaware).\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Newark has a humid subtropical climate (abbreviated Cfa on climate maps). Summers are hot and humid, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Winters are moderate-to-cold, with occasional snow in December, January, and February. Newark averages more than 220 frost-free days. The hardiness zone is 7a.\n}}\nDemographics\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2021 ACS racial makeup\n!Census year\n!2021 ACS\n|-\n|White\n|68.2%\n|-\n|Black\n|8.5%\n|-\n|Asian\n|7.8%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino\n|11.1%\n|-\n|2 or more\n|3.7%\n|}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 28,547 people, 8,989 households, and 4,494 families residing in the city.
