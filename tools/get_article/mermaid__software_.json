Created by Knut Sveidqvist in 2014, the project originated from a need to simplify diagram creation in documentation workflows after experiencing issues with proprietary software file formats.\nFeatures\nMermaid allows users to create various types of diagrams using a Markdown-like syntax, including:\n* Flowcharts\n* Sequence diagrams\n* Class diagrams\n* State diagrams\n* Gantt charts\n* Entity–relationship diagrams\nThe software provides both text-based and visual editing interfaces, allowing users to switch between the two modes. Users can create diagrams through the Mermaid Live Editor, a web-based tool that provides real-time preview capabilities without requiring local installation.\nIntegration\nMermaid is supported natively by several platforms and services:\n* Azure DevOps (in project wikis)\n* GitHub (in Markdown files)\n* Gitea\n* GitLab\n* Joplin\n* Tuleap\n* Notion\n* Obsidian\n* Quarto\nDevelopment\nAs of 2024, the project is developed under both open-source and commercial models. The core functionality remains open-source under the MIT License, while a commercial offering called Mermaid Chart provides additional features and hosted services. The open-source project has garnered significant community engagement, with over 74,000 GitHub stars and 6,800 forks as of early 2025.\nIn March 2024, the commercial entity raised $7.5 million in seed funding from investors including Open Core Ventures, Sequoia, and Microsoft's M12 fund.\nRecognition\nThe project received the JS Open Source Award in 2019 for \"The Most Exciting Use of Technology.\"\nSee also\n* PlantUML\n* Graphviz\n* Microsoft Visio\n* Lucidchart\nReferences"
