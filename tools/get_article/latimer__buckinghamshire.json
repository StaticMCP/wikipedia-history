It is within the civil parish of Latimer and Ley Hill (known as simply Latimer until 2013), which also includes the village of Ley Hill and the hamlet of Tyler's Hill.\nHistory\nLatimer was originally joined with the adjacent village of Chenies.  Both were anciently called Isenhampstead, at a time when there was a royal palace in the vicinity.  However, in the reign of King Edward III of England the lands were split between two manorial barons: Thomas Cheyne in the village that later became known as 'Chenies', and William Latimer in this village. Latimer came into possession of the manor in 1326.\nAt the time of the English Civil War Latimer belonged to the Earl of Devonshire.  When Charles I was captured by the Parliamentarian forces he was brought to Latimer on his way to London.\nThe triangular village green has two memorials. The first is a memorial to men who fought and died during the Boer War in South Africa. The base consists of local pudding-stones with the names of the 132 men inscribed on an obelisk of granite.  It was officially unveiled by Lady Chesham on 4 July 1903. The other memorial to a horse called Villebois; a black charger which Lord Chesham brought back from South Africa. It died in February 1911 and a cairn of local pudding-stones was put up in memory in June 1912.\nBuildings\nLatimer House is an historic country house, the former home of Lord Chesham. It was used in the Second World War for interrogating German defectors and prisoners. It is now De Vere Latimer Estate, owned by De Vere hotels.\nThe small village includes 17th- and 18th-century cottages around the triangular village green with a pump on it. The church of St Mary Magdelane was rebuilt by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1867. The rectory was built in the 18th century in grey and red brick.\nIn Ley Hill there is a common and a Methodist Chapel. Tyler's Hill is also in Latimer & Ley Hill parish and includes St George's Anglican Church.  The graveyard at Tyler's Hill which serves Ley Hill and Tyler's Hill is run by Latimer and Ley Hill parish council.\nRailway\nChalfont & Latimer station is situated in nearby Little Chalfont on the Chiltern Line with London Underground services between Baker Street and Amersham, and Chiltern services to Aylesbury and Marylebone.\nCultural references\nLatimer was the location used in the Department S episode, \"The Pied Piper of Hambledown\", first aired on 30 September 1969.\nThe village green also features in an episode of the original Randall & Hopkirk deceased....Also in an episode of (Inspector) Morse\nReferences\nExternal links"
