In March 1949, a Security Review Branch was established within the newly created Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as the Department's first operational security review function. By April 1949 this function was consolidated as the first operational activity in OSD. The restrictive and review functions of DOPSR trace back to the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1950s during the Cold War, and limits placed on some intelligence officials. The United States Supreme Court has only considered DOPSR and the pre-publication system once, in Snepp v. United States, involving journalist and former CIA official Frank Snepp.\nRole and mission\nDOPSR manages the Department's security and prepublication review program, reviewing written materials prior to public release to ensure no information damaging to national security is disclosed. The legality of the DOPSR program is based upon non-disclosure agreements signed by government officials who are given access to classified information.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://www.esd.whs.mil/DOPSR/ Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review] official website."
