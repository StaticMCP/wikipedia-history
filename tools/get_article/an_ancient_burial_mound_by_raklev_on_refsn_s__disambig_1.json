The painting is executed in the national romantic tradition, as advocated by Niels Laurits Høyen.\nIn the foreground is the painting's central motif, a tumulus. The painting uses this very prominent figure, a giant mound that pushes the image background back, to give great depth to the painting.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.thorvaldsensmuseum.dk/samlingerne/vaerk/B255 www.thorvaldsensmuseum.dk]"
