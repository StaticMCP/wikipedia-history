Khovansky would retreat, only to return on 16 October with a larger army (12,000 people, 18 artillery pieces). On 3 November, a Polish relief force of about 14,000 under king John II Casimir of Poland and regimentarz Stefan Czarniecki arrived, and on 4 November surprised the Russian forces by assaulting their camp. The Russian army was defeated, and the Poles captured all of their artillery.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of kushliki\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Kushliki"
