This branch was also referred to historically as the Chinese Army and the Nationalist Chinese Army during and after World War II and the 1949 retreat.\nSince the Chinese Civil War, no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed between the Republic of China regime and the communist regime, so as the final line of defense against a possible invasion by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the primary focus of the ROCA is on defense and counterattack against amphibious assault and urban warfare.\nOrganization\n, the incumbent commander of the ROC Army]]\nThe ROC Army's current operational strength includes three armies, five corps. As of 2005, the Army's 35 brigades include 25 infantry brigades, five armoured brigades and three mechanized infantry brigades. All infantry brigades stood down and transferred to Reserve Command after 2005.\nThis update reflects the ROCA order of battle at the conclusion of the Jinjing Restructuring Plan in 2008.\nA new type of unit called defense team () is being introduced. These are formed by elements of de-activated brigades under each area defense command. The strength of a defense team may vary from one or more reinforced battalions, making it roughly equal to a regiment. The team CO is usually a full colonel.\nIn the event of war most of the high command would retreat to underground bunkers, tunnel complexes, and command posts.\nRepublic of China Army Command Headquarters\n: The ROC Army CHQ  () is headed by a 3-star general and is responsible for overall command of all ROC Army assets. Army GHQ is subordinate to the Chief of the General Staff (military), the Minister of National Defense (civilian) and the ROC President.\n:* Internal Units: Personnel, Combat Readiness and Training,

commission and a bachelor's degree.\nIn 2025 the Army opened a dedicated unmanned aerial vehicle training center. The center is located in Tainan and offers training to both operational and support personal.\nHistory\nThe Army of the Nationalist Chinese regime\nNational Martyrs' Shrine in Taipei]]\nThe Republic of China Army originated from the National Revolutionary Army of the Nationalist Chinese regime, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang (KMT) in 1924, when the Whampoa Military Academy was established with Soviet military assistance.\nWhampoa Military Academy, which was presided by Chiang Kai-shek, was tasked with the objective of training a professional Chinese revolutionary army () to unify China during the Warlord Era. It participated in the Northern Expedition, the Second Sino-Japanese War (during World War II) and the Chinese Civil War before withdrawing of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949.\nRetreat to Taiwan\nAfter 1949, the ROC Army has participated in combat operations on Kinmen and the Dachen Archipelago against the PLA in the Battle of Kuningtou, and in the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. In addition to these major conflicts, ROCA commandos were regularly sent to raid the Fujian and Guangdong coasts. Until the 1970s, the stated mission of the Army was to retake the mainland from the People's Republic of China. Following the lifting of martial law in 1987 and the democratization of the 1990s, the mission of the ROC Army has been shifted to the defense of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu from a PLA invasion.\nModern Era\nWith the reduction of the size of the ROC armed forces in recent years, the Army has endured the largest number of cutbacks as ROC military doctrine has begun to emphasize the importance of offshore engagement with the Navy and Air Force. Subsequent to this shift in emphasis, the ROC Navy and Air Force have taken precedence over the ROC Army in defense doctrine and weapons procurement. Recent short-term goals in the Army include acquisition and development of joint command and control systems, advanced attack helicopters and armored vehicles, multiple launch rocket system and field air defense systems. The Army is also in the process of transitioning to an all volunteer force.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Army chemical warfare units were used to disinfect public areas and to do spot disinfections around known disease clusters. In January 2021 the 33rd Chemical Warfare Group was deployed to Taoyuan City to deal with a cluster of infections around a hospital there.\nEquipment\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the Republic of China Army launched several upgrade programmes to replace outdated equipment with more advanced weapons, also increasing its emphasis on forces that could be rapidly deployed and were suited for combat in Taiwan's heavily urbanized environment. Orders were placed with the United States for M60A3 Patton tanks, M109A5 \"Paladin\" howitzers and AH-1W SuperCobra attack helicopters, as well as updating existing equipment.\nAlong with the other ROC military branches, the ROC Army has extensive experience in the construction and utilization of tunnels and bases gained during the People's Republic of China's bombardments of Kinmen and Matsu during the Cold War and many facilities are rumoured to be located underground in undisclosed locations.\nThe U.S. Government announced on October 3, 2008, that it plans to sell $6.5 billion worth of arms to Taiwan ending the freeze of arms sales to Taiwan. Amongst other things, the plans include $2.532 billion worth of 30 AH-64D Apache Longbow Block III Attack helicopters with night-vision sensors, radar, 173 Stinger Block I air-to-air missiles and 1000 AGM-114L Hellfire missiles. and 182 Javelin missiles will also be available with 20 Javelin command launchers and is estimated to cost $47 million.\nOn January 29, 2010, US Government announced 5 notifications to US Congress for arms sales to Taiwan. Of the total 6.392 billion US dollars in the 5 announcements, ROC Army will receive 60 UH-60M and other related things for cost of 3.1 Billion.\nAviation Assets\nIn July 2007 it was reported that the ROC Army would request the purchase of 30 AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters from the US in the 2008 defence budget. In October 2015 it was announced that 9 AH-64E had been grounded due to oxidation of components in the helicopters' tail rotor gearboxes and comprehensive safety checks were made on all Apaches.  The 2008 defense budget also listed a request for 60 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters as a partial replacement for the UH-1Hs currently in service.\nMain battle tanks\nAn ROCA M60A3 TTS main battle tank\nAs of 2019, the ROC army has 480 M60A3s, 450 CM11s (modified M48 turrets mated to M60 chassis), and 250 CM12s (CM-11 turrets mated to M48 hulls). The design and technology used in the tanks date back to the 1940s and 1950s, including their 105mm rifled gun and utilizing traditional steel armor plating rather than composite materials used in modern armored fighting vehicles. It is expected that the majority of the ROC Army's armored units would continue to be equipped with legacy tanks in upgraded form after the army acquires the newer modern tanks. As of 2015, some CM11 tanks are observed to be upgraded with explosive reactive armor around the turret and hull.\nIn October 2017, Taiwan announced an upgrade program for 450 M60A3s consisting of replacing the main gun with a new 120&nbsp;mm weapon, as well as upgrading the ballistics computer, turret hydraulics, and other systems. Testing and evaluation are expected to be completed in 2019 and application of new features to start in 2020. However, in July 2018 the Ministry of National Defense renewed its interest in acquiring Abrams, and had set aside US$990 million to purchase 108 M1A2s while modernization of existing M60A3s in service continues.\nOn June 7, 2019, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense confirmed that Taiwan has signed a $2 billion weapons deal with the Trump administration, which includes a purchase of 108 M1A2T (M1A2C export variant for Taiwan) Abrams battle tanks. Taiwanese defense officials intend to use the M1A2T Abrams battle tank to replace its army's M60A3 and M48H CM11 tanks. On July 8, 2019, the U.S. State Department approved the sale of new M1A2T Abrams tanks to Taiwan despite criticism and protest of the deal from the People's Republic of China (PRC). The deal includes 122 M2 Mounted Machine Guns, 216 M240 machine guns, 14 M88A2 HERCULES vehicles, and 16 M1070A1 Heavy Equipment Transporters. General Dynamics Land Systems will build the tanks at Anniston Army Depot, Alabama, and at Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio. The final signing of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) was confirmed on December 21, 2019. The tanks represent the first sale of new tanks to the ROC Army in decades from the US. Surplus M1A1 tanks were previously rejected by previous US administrations, including George W. Bush in 2001. Current ROC tanks include used M60A3 tanks and locally manufactured M48 tanks in which the initial variants were first produced between the 1950s and 1960s. The first batch of 38 tanks were received on December 16, 2024, with the remaining tanks to be delivered in two more batches, the second one in 2025 and the final one in 2026.\nSome criticisms were made of these M1 Abrams purchases, some analysts expressed that Taiwan's terrain and some of its bridges and roads are unsuitable for the 60-tonne M1A2. However, Taiwan's current tanks have older 105-millimeter rifled guns that may not be able to readily penetrate the frontal armor of modern People's Liberation Army (PLA) Type 96 and Type 99 tanks, which can easily penetrate the Patton's old-fashioned steel armor with their smoothbore 125mm ZPT-98 main gun. The M1A2T tank's 120mm gun is capable of destroying PLA tanks without reliance on anti-tank missiles. Moreover, tanks can be used as mobile reserves for counterattacks against PLA beach landings, which was successful during the Battle of Guningtou. ROC Army Chief of Staff, Yang Hai-ming, said that China's best tank, the heavy Type 99 tank, would not be able to be transported in an amphibious invasion during a potential war with Taiwan and the PLA would have to rely on the much lighter 20-ton Type 63A tanks. Due to this logistics issue for the PLA there is less concern about the M1A2T tanks having to deal with China's most modern tanks during an amphibious invasion.\nInfantry vehicles\nThe CM-32 armoured vehicle, currently under production (mobile-gun platform variant is shown)\nCM-32 Yunpao, an 8x8 armoured personnel carrier locally manufactured, will replace ageing M113s and V-150 armoured vehicles. It is a modular vehicle platform capable of accepting various configurations for specific combat requirements. As of 2019, an IFV version of Yunpao armed with Orbital ATK 30mm Mk44 Bushmaster II cannons, CM-34, is planned for production. Production of a version with a 105-mm assault gun, which is modeled on that of the CM-11 Brave Tiger main battle tank, is also scheduled to be completed by 2023.\nAir defense\nLong and medium range air defense systems are operated by the Republic of China Air Force with the Army assuming much of the SHORAD mission. The most modern air defense system of the Army is the US-made Avenger.\nThe ROCA is in the process of fielding the Surface-to-Air TC-2 medium range air defense system. Development of a surface launched TC-2 began with the ROCN in 1994.\nOn June 7, 2019, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense confirmed that Taiwan has signed a $2 billion weapons deal with the Trump administration, which includes a purchase of \"250 surface-to-air Stinger missile systems.\" Taiwan's ROC Army already has 2,223 Stinger missile systems.\nArtillery\nOn September 23, 2019, former Defense Minister Yen De-fa () confirmed the Republic of China Armed Forces has requested the purchase of M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers from the United States. On August 4, 2021, the Biden administration approved a potential $750 million sale of 40 M109A6 self-propelled howitzers and other supporting equipment, including up to 1,698 kits for precision-guided munitions. However, the M109A6 is reportedly delayed until 2026 or later due to crowded production line forcing the Republic of China Armed Forces to look for alternatives. As of March 2023, the Republic of China Armed Forces is reportedly attempting to acquire hundreds of missile trucks and self-propelled howitzers from the Czech Republic.\nAs of 2019, the ROC Army's current tube artillery in service consists of M109A2 and M109A5 systems, 8 inch M110A2 self-propelled howitzers and 155mm M114 towed howitzers. These systems have exceeded their service life with the oldest being the M114, which has been in service for 68 years, while the youngest artillery system, the M109A5, has been in service for 21 years. The last artillery system that entered service is the M109A5s, which are ordered in 1996 and taken delivery in 1998.\nThe ROC Army also maintains a large force of rocket artillery vehicles. There are a handful of Kung Feng VI 117mm rocket launchers still in service, but these are being phased out in favour of the more capable RT-2000. Testing is underway for long-range rockets capable of being fired by the RT-2000 from Taiwan and reaching inland targets on the Chinese mainland. In 2021, Taiwan purchased 11 M142  High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) from the U.S. to be delivered in 2024, along with the first batch of M1A2T Abrams tanks. A second order of 18 HIMARS is expected to be delivered in 2026.\nGallery\nFile:07.10 總統視導「M1A2T新式戰車換裝訓練」 -54645185729.jpg|M1A2T tanks\nFile:ROCA Special Force Team Line up at Armor School 20130302.jpg|ROC Army sharpshooter team\nFile:ROCAFrogman ARB 04.jpg|ROC Army 101st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion Training during Amphibious Landing Exercise\nFile:Frogman.jpg|A military frogman of the 101st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion\nFile:Chemical Safety Persons Cleaning Truck Display at Armor School Right Rear View 20130302.jpg|Chemical Safety Persons Cleaning Truck\nFile:ROCA Emergency Command Car Display at Chengkungling Rear View 20131012.jpg|ROCA Emergency Command Car\nFile:ROCA Microwave Broadcasting Van Display at Chengkungling Ground Rear Right View 20131012.jpg|ROCA Microwave Broadcasting Van (Ford F250 chassis)\nFile:TRA Nanzih Station by billy1125 (4).jpg|Military equipment on a train\nFile:ROCA Satellite Telecommunication Vehicle 20111105.jpg|ROCA Satellite Telecommunication Vehicle (Ford E-Series van)\nFile:ROCA Mobile Water Filter Truck 20120602a.jpg|ROCA Mobile Water Filter Truck (Mercedes-Benz Actros chassis)\nFile:MAN 35ton Heavy Transporter Display in Chengkungling 20111009a.jpg|MAN 35ton Heavy Transporter\nFile:ROCA Special Assault Vehicle Display at CKS Memorial Hall Square Front Left View 20140607.jpg|ROCA Special Assault Vehicle\nFile:ROCA Type 97 NBC Detect Truck Display at No.11 Pier of Zhongzheng Naval Base 20130504a.jpg|ROCA Type 97 NBC Detection (Daimler Truck Unimog) Truck\nFile:ROCA AH-1W Display at Hukou Camp 20111105a.jpg|ROCA AH-1W\nFile:ROCA UH-1H 379 Taking off from ROCMA Ground 20140531.jpg|An ROCA UH-1H 379 taking off from ROCMA Ground\nFile:03.30 「臺北市106年全民防衛暨2017臺北世界大學運動會災害防救及金華演習」，演練空、地立體攻堅 33578031842 d989f4acd4 o.jpg|UH-60M\nFile:Type 86 carbine.jpg|Type 86 carbine\nFile:Generator of T-82 20mm Twin Cannon 20121013.jpg|Generator of T-82 20mm Twin Cannon\nFile:Engineering Equitment of Center Taiwan Resverse Training Center Display in Chengkungling Ground 20121006.jpg|Engineering Equitment of Center Taiwan Reserve Training Center\nFile:LAADS Housed in S-280 Shelter on Truck 20120211.jpg|LAADS Housed in S-280 Shelter on Truck\nFile:ROCA Double-modes Infrared Biological Detector Display at Tainan AFB Apron 20130810.jpg|ROCA Double-modes Infrared Biological Detector\nFile:T4-86 Light Sterilizer with Bath Screen Display at Armor School 20130302.jpg|T4-86 Light Sterilizer with Bath Screen\nFile:Taipei Taiwan Presidential-Office-Building-10.jpg|Wire dispenser\nFile:Visitors with ROCA Officer Photoing above Engineering Bridge 20121006.jpg|Visitors with ROCA Officer Photoing above Engineering Bridge\nFile:Military Light Tactical Vehicle Type B Display at ROCMA Ground 20160604a.jpg|Military Light Tactical Vehicle Type B\nFile:ROCA M88A1 RV Display in CCK Air Base 20111112a.jpg|ROCA M88A1 RV\nFile:ROCA Point Defense Array Radar System Truck Display at Chengkungling Ground 20150606c.jpg|CS/MPQ-90 on a Navistar 7000 series truck\nFile:Bistatic Radar Passive Receiver System Display at Military Academy Ground 20140531a.jpg|Bistatic Radar Passive Receiver System Display at Military Academy Ground\nFile:陸劍二野戰防空飛彈系統.jpg|Ground based Sky Sword 2 battery\nFile:CM-32 Yunpao APC Display at Hsinchu AFB 20151121a.jpg|CM-32 APC\nFile:馬英九總統視導CM-34 30公厘機砲裝步戰鬥車.jpg|CM-32, 30mm Bushmaster cannon armed variant of the CM-32\nFile:ROCA OH-58D 636 Taking off from ROCMA Ground 20140531a.jpg|OH-58D Kiowa scout helicopter\nSee also\n* Republic of China Army rank insignia\n* Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)\n* Republic of China Armed Forces\n** Republic of China Navy\n*** Republic of China Marine Corps\n** Republic of China Air Force\n** Republic of China Military Police\n* Orders, decorations, and medals of the Republic of China\n* Political status of Taiwan\n* Santikhiri, a town in Thailand settled by remnants of the 93rd Division\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://army.mnd.gov.tw/Pages/index.aspx ROC Army webpage]"
