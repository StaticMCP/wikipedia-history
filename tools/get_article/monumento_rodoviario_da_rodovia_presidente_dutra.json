It was registered as cultural heritage on 27 August 1990. The Portinari panels were removed in October 2000, restored in 2001, and are now on display at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.\nA public civil action to restore the structure was filed by the Federal Public Ministry of Volta Redonda in October 2015.
