The eponymous founder of the dynasty was Godred Crovan, who appeared from obscurity in the late 11th century, before his takeover of the Isle of Man and Dublin. The dynasty was of Gaelic-Scandinavian origin, descending from a branch of the Uí Ímair, a dominant kindred in the Irish Sea region which first appears on record in the late 9th century.\nLeading members of the Crovan dynasty formed marriage-alliances with the Irish and Norwegian kings, as well as Hebridean, Gallovidian, and Anglo-Norman lords, and possibly Welsh princes as well. Surrounded by sometimes threatening English, Norwegian and Scottish monarchs, and various warlords from the western seaboard of Scotland, the leading members of the dynasty at times tactfully recognised the overlordship of certain kings of Norway and England, and even the Papacy. The military might of the dynasty were their fleets of galleys, and their forces battled in Ireland, the Hebrides, Wales, and the Isle of Man. The importance of the galley to the sea-Kings of the Crovan dynasty is illustrated in its implementation upon seals that certain members are known to have used.\nAlex Woolf believes the Clann Somhairle can be regarded as a female line cadet branch of the Crovan dynasty.\nAfter Somerled's coup, the Crovan dynasty were temporarily deposed from all except the Isle of Man, and Dublin. On Somerled's death, they were allowed to inherit part of the realm : Lewis, Harris, and Skye.\nDynasts\n*Godred Crovan, died 1095\n*Logmann, d. 1103, son of Godfred\n*Olaf, d. 1153, son of Godfred\n*Godred, d. 1187, son of Olaf, who lost most of the Kingdom to Somerled's family\n*Reginald,  1164, son of Olaf, half-brother of Godred, he and successors ruled only in Northern Isles\n*Godred, restored\n*Reginald, d. 1229, son of Godred\n*Olaf the Black, s. 1237, son of Godred, half-brother of Reginald\n*Godred, d. 1231, son of Reginald\n*Harald, d. 1248, son of Olaf\n*Reginald, d. 1249, son of Olaf\n*Harald,  1249, son of Godred\n*Magnus, died 1265, son of Olaf\nIn Magnus's lifetime, Ewan MacDougall, a descendant of Somerled, was appointed king of the Hebrides by Haakon, the Norwegian king.
