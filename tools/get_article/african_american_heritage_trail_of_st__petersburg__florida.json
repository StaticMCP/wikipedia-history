Both trails start at the Dr. Carter G. Woodson African American Museum.\nHistory\nThe Deuces, as 22nd Street South came to be known, used to be the commercial hub for the African American community in St. Petersburg during the Jim Crow era. The area was negatively impacted by projects such as interstate I-175 but it is experiencing a period of revival and investment. Deuces Live is a 501(c)3 non-profit “created to revive and revitalize this historic neighborhood where Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday played, famous African-American baseball stars stayed and the black residents of St. Petersburg lived, worked and worshiped.” The City of St. Petersburg has also invested in the neighborhood with its Deuces Rising Project, which envisions a “welcoming gateway, housing that is affordable, new parks, and an infusion of resources that encourage private businesses to thrive.”\nSites\nThe trail along 22nd Street South focuses on \"Community, Culture, and Commerce,\" while the trail along 9th Ave South focuses on \"Faith, Family, and Education.\"\nThe sites along the trail include:\n* Manhattan Casino\n* Fannye Ayer Ponder House\n* the Royal Theater\n* historic Mercy Hospital\n* statue of Elder Jordan\nGallery\nFile:Evara Health at the former historic Mercy Hospital.jpg|Evara Health at the former historic Mercy Hospital, once the only hospital that treated African Americans in St. Petersburg.\nReferences"
