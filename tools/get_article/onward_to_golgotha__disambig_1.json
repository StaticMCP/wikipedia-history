It was re-released in October 2006 with a bonus DVD of live performances. Decibel added the album to their hall of fame. To celebrate being added to the hall of fame, it was re-released on 180 gram vinyl, but limited to only 1,000 copies.\nMusic\nIn response to the increasing commercial success of death metal in the early 1990s, the members of Incantation \"were hell-bent on driving [the genre] back into darker underground regions where it had originally arisen from in the mid-to-late ’80s with bands like Possessed, Celtic Frost, Bathory and Death,\" according to Scott Koerber of  Decibel. Hence, the sound on Onward to Golgotha has been characterized by a \"morbid, funereal atmosphere\", drawing influence from black metal and doom metal. Scott Koerber of Decibel described the album's sound as utilizing \"swarming guitars, blasting darkness and crushing doom\" guided by a \"warlike, blackened death metal pace, with abstract leads and pinch harmonics illuminating the tangled mass.\" Greg Prato of AllMusic described the album as \"the sound of being swallowed whole into the bowels of hell\" and \"death metal at its most extreme.\"\nIncantation guitarist John McEntee cited the 1985 album Seven Churches by Possessed as a major influence on Onward to Golgotha.\nReception and legacy\nGreg Prato of AllMusic gave the album three and a half stars out of five. He wrote: \"Onward to Golgotha does not let up one iota in its intensity -- evidenced in the vocal growls, manic riffing, and wicked drumbeats -- from beginning to end. Take a gander at some of the song titles. [...] Any question of how brutal it all must sound? Didn't think so.\"\nIn 2021, Tom Morgan of Invisible Oranges wrote: \"The whole aesthetic of Onward To Golgotha is in fact so well-realised that it has come to define the sonic parameters of ‘old school death metal’ in our collective imaginations. Although Incantation and Relapse’s relationship would eventually turn sour, Onward To Golgotha is an undeniable genre masterpiece – the very first released by the then-fledgling label.\"\nTrack listing\n;DVD\n;Cell Block Show\n#  \"Entrentment of Evil\"\n#  \"Deliverance of Horrific Prophecies\"\n#  \"Unholy Massacre\"\n#  \"Devoured Death\"\n#  \"Blasphemous Cremation\"\n#  \"Profanation\"\n#  \"Golgotha\"\n;Studio 1 Show\n#  \"Devoured Death\"\n#  \"Entrentment of Evil\"\n#  \"Bleeding Torment (Necrophagia Cover)\"\n#  \"Deliverance of Horrific Prophecies\"\n;Flashes Show\n#  \"Deliverance of Horrific Prophecies\"\n#  \"Devoured Death\"\n#  \"Rotting Spiritual Embodiment\"\n#  \"Unholy Massacre\"\n#  \"Blasphemous Cremation\"\n#  \"Christening the Afterbirth\"\n#  \"Profanation\"\nCredits\n*Craig Pillard – guitar, vocals\n*John McEntee – lead guitar\n*Jim Roe – drums\n*Ronny Deo – bass\n*Steve Evetts – producer, engineer\n*Dave Shirk – mastering\n*Miran Kim – cover artwork\nReferences\nSources\n* http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/11/24/dont-forget-to-be-thank-for-fear-emptiness-decibel/\nExternal links"
