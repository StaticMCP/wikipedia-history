      "text": "# List of Courage the Cowardly Dog characters\n\nThis is a list of characters from the Cartoon Network animated series, Courage the Cowardly Dog.\nMain characters\nCourage\n:Voiced by Howard Hoffman (pilot) and Marty Grabstein (series; \"The Fog of Courage\"; Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog)\nCourage is the titular character and protagonist of the series. He is a kind yet easily frightened pink-furred beagle dog who was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were sent into outer space, but was adopted by Muriel Bagge. Her husband Eustace regularly mistreats him. Ironically, given his name and often expressing his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks, Courage is a genuine hero who goes to great lengths to protect his owners. Despite his injuries, some of which are quite brutal, episodes usually end with Courage rewarded in some way due to his determination, selfless nature, willingness to face adversity squarely, and/or pure luck. Courage is also very clever and resourceful when the situation demands it, outsmarting the villains most of the time. He also often displays super strength, carrying Muriel and Eustace with relative ease. Aiding him in saving the day is a self-aware, sarcastic, and seemingly omniscient computer that he keeps in the attic. He got his name when Muriel found him as a puppy alone in an alley and remarked that he must be quite brave to be there by himself.\nMuriel Bagge\n:Voiced by Howard Hoffman (pilot), Thea White (series; \"The Fog of Courage\"; Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog), and Kath Soucie (Little Muriel)\nMuriel Bagge is Courage's owner and Eustace's wife. She is a plump, kind, hardworking Scottish elderly woman who took Courage in when he was an abandoned puppy. Muriel often carries a rolling pin that she hits Eustace with whenever he harasses Courage. She also likes tea and usually tends to her garden, as well as being an accomplished sitar player. Muriel also has a great fondness for cooking; however, her recipes tend to include an excessive amount of vinegar, much to the distaste of both her dog and husband. Most of all, she loves sitting in her rocking chair with Courage on her lap and watching television. Due to her kindness and sweet nature, Muriel is an easy (and often attractive) target for villains. The crossover movie Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog was White’s final role before she died of liver cancer in 2021.\nEustace Bagge\n:Voiced by Howard Hoffman (pilot), Lionel Wilson (Episodes 1–33), Arthur Anderson (Episodes 34–52), Wallace Shawn (\"The Fog of Courage\"), and Jeff Bergman (Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog)\nEustace Bagge is Muriel's husband. He is a skinny, selfish, greedy, cynical, and sarcastic elderly man who is obsessed with his vintage truck. Eustace wears glasses identical in appearance to Muriel's. His brown hat shields his glistening bald head. Eustace is the current owner of the farmhouse, which was previously owned by his now-deceased brother Horst. Eustace regularly yells at Courage and calls him a \"Stupid dog!\" He regularly dismisses Muriel as well, but he still does love his wife, as evidenced by his concern for her well-being in a few episodes, like \"The Demon in the Mattress\".\nLionel Wilson originally voiced the character, but left midway through the third season due to illness (and eventually died five months after the show ended) and was replaced by Arthur Anderson. However, many vocals and sounds of grunts, laughs, screams and catchphrases from Wilson have been used while Anderson was recording. In the 2014 short titled The Fog of Courage, Wallace Shawn replaced Anderson as the voice of Eustace. In the crossover special with Scooby-Doo, Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog, veteran voice actor Jeff Bergman plays Eustace.\nSupporting characters\nComputer\n:Voiced by Simon Prebble (series), Paul Schoeffler (\"The Fog of Courage\"), and Jeff Bergman (Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog)\nThe computer, which speaks with a British accent, gives Courage advice on how to deal with crazy situations. Located in the farmhouse attic, it's very cynical and sarcastic towards Courage, and has a habit of regularly cracking jokes in any situation. It also appears to often provide Courage with sarcastic and unhelpful advice, but it's nevertheless supportive of him.\nDr. Vindaloo\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nDr. Vindaloo is an Indian doctor with a thick accent, whom Eustace and Muriel see when something is wrong. He is one of the few characters in the series who can perfectly understand what Courage is trying to say. He diagnoses his patients as not having serious problems or that there is nothing that he can do, but has, on occasion, been a great help. He often quotes “There’s nothing to worry about. Nothing at all. But, there's nothing I can do.” when questioned about certain health conditions or situations.\nShirley the Medium\n:Voiced by Mary Testa\nShirley the Medium is a small green Chihuahua garbed as a stereotypical Gypsy fortune-teller who resides in a dilapidated caravan. She has a strong dislike of Eustace (whom she always refers to as \"the stupid one\") because of his greed and selfishness. Due to this she often places Eustace under curses to get him to be a better person. Shirley is one of Courage's three confidants, the others being the Computer and Dr. Vindaloo, and helps him occasionally by casting and reciting spells and playing the saxophone in-between verses.\nMajor villains\nKatz\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nKatz is a sadistic red tabby cat with a British accent. He is Courage's nemesis and the show's most recurring antagonist, though Muriel and Eustace consistently fail to recognize him. He specializes in scam businesses and is extremely sadistic. Many of his businesses involve torturing or outright killing his customers; for example, in \"Night at the Katz Motel,\" he fed his motel residents to flesh-eating spiders, and in \"Klub Katz,\" he transformed the vacationers into machines to fight for him gladiator-style. In \"Katz Under the Sea\" he invites visitors to a submarine, distracting them with a performer and attempts to blow up the vessel using TNT. All of his businesses enforce a strict \"No Dogs Allowed\" policy, forcing Courage to sneak in. He often challenges Courage to ironically banal games such as wall-ball and staring contests, which Courage invariably loses; nevertheless, he is always defeated in the end. Unlike the rest of the show's villains, he is frequently accompanied by his own theme, which consists of a sinister hip-hop beat.\nSilhouette Maker\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nSilhouette Maker is an old man who made paper versions of Eustace and Muriel at a stall at his fair. His sole appearance was as the former main antagonist in \"Profiles in Courage\".\nLe Quack\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nLe Quack is a French-accented duck con-artist who first appears early in the show's first season, in which he has a fake amnesia-specialist license; he comes to the Bagges' house when Muriel suffers from amnesia. Since then, he frequently returns and manages to dupe Courage's owners into helping him commit crime sprees. Le Quack is also shown to be capable of escaping custody such as when he was first arrested, crashing the police car in the process, and later causing a fire at prison.\nDi Lung\n:Voiced by Tim Chi Ly\nDi Lung is a Chinese inventor who first appears in the episode \"Hothead\". He is very inconsiderate and rude and usually gets caught in the middle of the chaos happening in Nowhere, prompting him to shout his catchphrase of \"Watch where you're going, ya fool!\", which is a running gag in the series, because he uses said phrase hypocritically, when he is clearly in the wrong despite blaming the other person. He is the inventor of Mecha Courage. Di Lung also has two aunts: one good and one bad, who are both the Empresses of China; thus, this could make him royalty.\nMa Bagge\n:Voiced by Billie Lou Watt\nMa Bagge is the mother of Eustace and Horst and Muriel's mother-in-law, who shares a love-hate relationship with the former, usually calling him \"Stupid Boy\". She lives in a trailer and is the widow of Icket Bagge (Eustace’s father). Like Eustace, she is actually bald but wears a wig and looks almost identical to her son, but much shorter, along with being insecure due to being bald, but she does have her teeth. It is learned that Ma and Horst's ill treatment was part of Eustace's negative personality. She tends to treat Courage kindly whenever Eustace is around, possibly because she knows it annoys him, though she also has a love-hate relationship with Courage and calls him a \"stupid dog\" just like Eustace does. She's also the owner of Growth Industries, a company that produces wigs and experiments on certain people with a rare blood type, one that Muriel has.\nBenton Tarantella and Errol Von Volkheim\n:Voiced by Peter Fernandez (Benton) and Paul Schoeffler (Errol)\nBenton Tarantella (a pun of Quentin Tarantino) and Errol Von Volkheim (a pun of Erich Von Stroheim and Errol Flynn) are a zombified duo of film directors. In \"Everyone Wants to Direct\", they would pose as ordinary movie producers to lure unsuspecting victims to their fates, killing them in the process as part of their ‘film’.\nTarantella returns in the episode, \"Angry Nasty People\", where he uses his camera to capture Eustace's nastiness towards Courage and Muriel, creating another version of Eustace named \"Mr. Nasty.\"\nBuschwick\n:Voiced by Andre Sogliuzzo\nBuschwick (though he bans people from calling him that, insisting everybody refer to him as simply \"Schwick\") is a human-sized cockroach who comes from a New York City neighborhood of the same name. He appears in the episode \"Courage in the Big Stinkin' City\" and invites the Bagges backstage at Radio City Music Hall that is close to Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, New York, luring Muriel with the promise of rehearsing for a sitar concert which was a prize that she won in a contest and deceiving Eustace into thinking that he will get hot dogs. The insect sends Courage to retrieve a package, threatening to sentence Muriel to be a victim of an unseen monster behind a locked door if he does not receive the package before curtain time. He then adds that the police better be left out, which also results in Muriel's demise. Although the dog recovers the package, Schwick finds that its contents are damaged, infuriating him to the point of releasing his pet from its cage. The creature eats Eustace, but Courage and Muriel attend the concert while Schwick is arrested by a New York City Police Department police officer.\nBuschwick's pet\n'''Buschwick's pet is a creature that is trapped behind a mousehole door in his rehearsal room. The unseen animal is responsible for the demise of previous visitors who entered the room (their bones are visible inside) and he warns Courage to recover his package before the curtain rises, without involving law enforcement, otherwise, he will release the monster on Muriel. Courage acquires the item, but the insect finds that the contents are damaged, causing him to release the creature which attempts to kill Muriel. Courage and Muriel escape unharmed, but the creature devours Eustace. The series producer has since confirmed that the animal is in fact a hamster.\nThe Chicken from Outer Space\n:Voiced by Howard Hoffman\nThe Chicken from Outer Space''' is the show's first villain, introduced by the pilot episode of the same name. His eggs are unlike regular chicken eggs as they have red spots with a red yolk, are mutagenic and whoever eats them will turn into one. In his first appearance, he tries to take over the farm, he lays eggs in the chicken coop which are eaten by Eustace, and ends up being shot by his laser gun, turning into a headless roast chicken. He later returns in \"The Revenge of The Chicken from Outer Space\" where he wants to use a plunger to rip off Courage's head and put it on his roasted body. He ends up ripping off Eustace's head and tries to destroy Courage but is then blown up in his spaceship when a rocket blasts into it. In \"Son of the Chicken from Outer Space\", his three-headed son is sent to Earth to avenge him and kill Courage. Unfortunately, like their father, they are no match for the timid dog and fear that they will never be able to go home until Courage is dead. Feeling sympathy for them, Courage helps them by taking fake pictures to make it look like they succeeded in killing him and fooling their mother into thinking that their mission was a success.\nSnowman\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nSnowman is a talking snowman believed to be the last of his kind due to global warming. In his first appearance, he tries to steal Eustace and Muriel's \"anti-melting\" gene. He returns in the episode \"The Snowman's Revenge\" where he turns the farmhouse into the West Pole and freezes Courage and his owners, however, he reveals how he lost his home and friends. After Courage restores his homeland and his friends, he returns home to reunite with them. He has a voice pattern like that of the Scottish actor Sean Connery.\nCajun Fox\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nCajun Fox is an orange sunglass-wearing fox obsessed with cooking who appears in \"Cajun Granny Stew\" and \"Ball of Revenge\". He kidnaps Muriel to make a stew, using her as the final ingredient, but he ends up falling into the pot of stew himself when Courage falls on top of him and Muriel just as he is about to throw Muriel into the pot.\nFreaky Fred\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nFreaky Fred is Muriel's nephew who was sent to the \"home for freaky barbers\", due to his obsession with cutting the hair of people or animals to the point that they are bald. He speaks in poems and rhymes often repeating the word ‘naughty’ when describing certain situations. His other catchphrase is 'Courage...'.\nThe Clutching Foot\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler & Arnold Stang\nThe Clutching Foot is a foot fungus that Eustace contracts before mutating into a sentient being. It resembles a giant purple left foot with heads for toes and acts as if it were a stereotypical criminal mob, with the big toe as the kingpin, and the smaller toes as his goons. It orders Courage to carry out crimes during the episode. It is later defeated when Courage licks it after researching and finding that its main weakness is dog saliva.\nDr. Gerbil\n:Voiced by Guy Paul\nDr. Gerbil is a gerbil who speaks with a Southern accent, who has gone mad due to being experimented on and being trapped by his previous owners. He is now a mad scientist, who performs strange experiments on humans with homemade cosmetic products, because he believes that he needs to exact revenge on humans for what they do to animals.\nDr. Žalost\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nDr. Žalost is \"the greatest unhappy scientist who ever lived\" who lives in a giant, moving tower. He lives with his assistant, Rat, whom he constantly asks for a hug. He demands 33⅓ billion dollars from the city of Nowhere to fund his \"Unhappy Cannonball\" project, only to be brushed off by the city's officials as a scam artist. In retaliation, Žalost attacks the city by firing unhappy cannonballs from his mobile tower, making the citizens of the city depressed and unproductive. Despite receiving his money in the end, he refuses to return the inhabitants of the city to normal, as he is jealous of the happiness of others. He then turns his attention towards the Bagge family, determined to inflict sadness and depression on all of the inhabitants of Nowhere. His name Žalost is a word of Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, or Slovenian origin meaning \"sorrow\" or \"sadness\".\nThe Goose God\n:Voiced by Paul Schoeffler\nThe Goose God is a goose who came down from the heavens to search for the woman of his dreams, and ended up falling in love with Muriel, whom he competed with Courage and Eustace to make his wife and queen (even though Eustace is completely unaware this is happening). He later falls for Eustace's truck after hearing it honk. He has made cameos in various other episodes (usually lying on top of the truck).\nJeeves Weevil\n:Voiced by Michael Allinson\nJeeves Weevil is a human-sized, polite, blood-sucking weevil who wears a blue tuxedo and hat. When the Bagges accidentally run him over with their truck and injure him, he is accepted into their home. While a seeming gentleman, he begins to suck the life out of the ever-oblivious Muriel and Eustace. He does not suck out dogs' lives, so Courage is unharmed. He succeeds at sucking out Eustace's life.\nKing of Flan\n:Voiced by Jorge Pupo\nKing of Flan is an overweight man with a Spanish accent and the proprietor of a company that makes flan. He produces a TV commercial that uses hypnotism to attract customers, all of whom become morbidly obese after eating too much flan. Courage comes to stop The King of Flan from broadcasting on all the networks and causes The King to accidentally hypnotize himself. The company is located at 1 Flan Drive in Flansville, Kansas.\nKing Ghidorah\nThis is a 3-headed dragon that is not a true villain but is present in 'Courage in the Big Stinkin' City' as a creature hidden behind a door inside an apartment block that Courage enters to search for Schwick's pack. It is presumably a reference to the Godzilla franchise.\nKing Ramses\n:Voiced by series creator John R. Dilworth\nKing Ramses is the ghost of a pharaoh from ancient Egypt. Two cat grave robbers steal a slab (decorated with images of King Ramses and pictures corresponding to each of his three curses) from his tomb and flee to Nowhere, but Ramses appears and demands the return of his slab. They refuse, so Ramses summons a swarm of locusts. He later attacks the farm when Courage finds the slab and Eustace refuses to return it after discovering it is worth a fortune, summoning a flood of water, a loud record player, and locusts. Eustace finally gives in and Courage throws the slab out of the house. After Eustace reclaims it, Ramses unleashes one final curse that imprisons Eustace in the slab as punishment for his greed as it is returned to Ramses's crypt the next day.\nMayan Baker\nVoiced by Daniel Oreskes\nMayan Baker, who appeared in the episode \"Courage Meets the Mummy\", is the reanimated corpse of a Mayan royal baker. In ancient times, the baker served cookies to the Mayan princess until she falsely accused him of stealing cookies and selling them to villagers for money, but the thief was really her trusted royal poobah. Thousands of years later, Professor Frith accidentally resurrected the Mummy. After attacking him, the Mummy decided to take revenge against Eustace and Muriel. He mistakes them for the princess and poobah. With some setbacks, the Mummy finally arrives at the farm where Courage hypnotizes Eustace and Muriel into thinking they are the Mayan Princess and the Poobah. After recreating the situation from thousands of years earlier, Courage surmised that the Baker was framed by the Poobah. Satisfied, the Mummy decides to return to his tomb to eternally rest in peace when Muriel gives him Eustace's polka-dotted blanket for his entombment.\nMad Dog\n:Voiced by Peter Fernandez\nMad Dog is a Doberman and the fierce leader of an evil dog-gang who began dating Bunny until Courage came to her rescue. He is shown to be possessive and abusive towards Bunny to the point of forcing her to not see her best friend Kitty, as he will bury both of them if they are seen together.\nMecha Courage\nVoiced by John R. Dilworth\nMecha Courage is a robotic version of Courage that was created by Di Lung in an attempt to prove that he has created a dog that is superior to Courage in every way. Mecha Courage resembles a mini-dome, colored pink with a purple underside and tail, on wheels, with a red, blinking light for a nose.\nMr. Nasty\n:Voiced by Arthur Anderson\nMr. Nasty is a character created by Benton Tarantella from Eustace's true evil essence. He is similar to Eustace (both in identity and personality), only with sunglasses in place of his eyeglasses, blue skin, and a deeper voice. After Mr. Nasty is brought into existence, he co-stars in Tarantella's reality TV show Angry Nasty People alongside Eustace, in which they both mistreat Courage and Muriel.\nMustafa al Bacterius\n:Voiced by Arnold Stang\nMustafa al Bacterius is a parasitic alien who appears in \"Mission to the Sun\". When Courage and the Bagges are sent on a mission to prevent the Sun from burning out, Bacterius attempts to sabotage their mission by firstly infecting and controlling Muriel's mind, and then using her to destroy their spaceship. Eventually, he is sucked out of the ship through the toilet and infects Eustace at the end of the episode.\nThe Queen of the Black Puddle\n:Voiced by Ruth Williamson\nThe Queen of the Black Puddle is an otherworldly siren temptress who resides within a supernatural black puddle. Her sinister goals are to seduce men gradually until she eventually manages to guide them to her puddle, where she eats them. She appeared in the episode of the same name where she successfully manages to charm Eustace and almost succeeds in devouring him, but Courage triumphs over her and escapes back to the surface with Eustace. At the episode's end, when Courage is bathing, a canine version of the Queen of the Black Puddle appears from the bath water, leaving Courage confused and puzzled. She later returns as part of a large villain supergroup to get rid of Courage in the episode “Ball of Revenge”.\nKing Kong\nVoiced by Paul Schoeffler\nKing Kong is a large ape who appears in the episode \"1,000 Years of Courage\". When Courage and his owners are sent to a future Earth inhabited by talking banana people, the Big Ape poses as the Banana God to devour the banana people, while his nephew disguises himself as a benevolent sovereign. After the episode, both monkeys are musicians for the banana people.\nCruel Veterinarian\n:Voiced by George Hall\nCruel Veterinarian is the overarching antagonist and main antagonist of the episode, \"Remembrance of Courage Past\". He is responsible for separating Courage from his parents as a puppy under the guise of a veterinary consultation. Manipulating Courage’s parents into talking with him privately, he traps them and locks them in a rocket ship as part of a twisted experiment to breed \"space dogs.\" Courage tries to save them but is chased off by the vet and helplessly watches as his parents are launched into space.\nYears later, a still-traumatized Courage is taken to the same veterinarian by Muriel and Eustace. Recognizing the vet, Courage uncovers his sinister plan to repeat the experiment—this time with him as the subject. The vet traps Courage in a rocket and, when discovered, also captures Muriel and Eustace to prevent them from exposing his operation. He proclaims his belief in breeding dogs in space as the future of canine evolution. However, Courage thwarts the plan, rescues his owners, and traps the vet in the rocket instead. The rocket launches with the vet aboard, seemingly ending his cruelty.\nIn the episode's conclusion, the vet's rocket crash-lands on a distant planet where the dogs from his previous experiments, including Courage’s parents, have survived. Realizing his experiment failed, the vet nervously laughs before the vengeful dogs drag him off-screen and presumably maul him to death. His screams of pain mark his fitting end.\nThe Empress\n:Voiced by Winnie Chaffee\nThe Empress is the aunt of Di Lung, and she appeared in \"Squatting Tiger, Hidden Dog\", where her source of power (a magic silkworm) is dying and needs the bones of someone truly innocent to recharge it. She tries to steal Muriel's bones, but is stopped by Courage and the Empress' twin sister (who is good and is the true Empress). The Bad Empress made a cameo appearance in \"Aqua Farmer\".\nThe Great Fusilli\n:Voiced by Jim Cummings\nThe Great Fusilli is an Italian alligator devoted to theater arts who turns people into puppets so that they cannot leave his show. He is defeated when he mistakes Courage for a ghost and falls off the balcony and becomes a marionette himself, but not before changing Eustace and Muriel.\nThe Shadow\n:Voiced by Dennis Predovic\nThe Shadow is the living shadow that can change his shape and appearance. In the episode \"The Shadow of Courage\", he becomes free after a cruel old miser had collapsed and passed away in his laboratory, he later terrorizes the people of Nowhere by frightening them but was forced to retreat to the Bagge estate during a lightning storm where he began scaring both Courage and Eustace. Eventually, Courage decides to confront him he reveals that he never wanted to be like the old man and wants to become a movie star, Courage then takes the Shadow to see the night sky where he can become an actual star, happy with this revelation he waved goodbye to Courage and jumped into the cosmos, turning into a new star.\nThe Shark\nThis is a monster that is, like Ghidorah, not truly antagonistic but is also seen in 'Courage in the Big Stinkin' City' hidden behind an apartment door that Courage opens when searching for Schwick's package. This is presumably a reference to the Jaws movie.\nThe Weremole\nThe Weremole is a mole similar to a werewolf but much smaller, yet just as fierce. It has a taste for rabbits and people and if a person is bitten by the weremole, they become one themselves. Its bite does not affect other creatures. The only way to reverse the transformation is to feed one of the weremole's hairs to the victim. The weremole bites Muriel on the hand and when the moon is full she transforms into a weremole. Courage and Eustace team up realizing that they are in more trouble than they thought. Courage and Eustace defeat Muriel when Courage drops one of the original weremole's hairs in Muriel's mouth, and Muriel returns to normal.\nThe Windmill Vandals\nThe Windmill Vandals are a group of 4 horsebacked Vandals who once plagued the land of Nowhere. The farmer who once lived in the farmhouse where the Bagge family now resides constructed the windmill next to the farmhouse, and inscribed several runes, one on each blade of the windmill, to keep the Vandals away. In the episode in which they appear, the windmill breaks, and the Vandals appear as wraiths to come and destroy the farmhouse (even though there were other instances where the windmill was damaged throughout the show and the Vandals did not appear). The mill is repaired and broken several times, until finally it is fully fixed, and the Vandals banished forever more.\nViolin girl\nThe violin girl is a third occupant residing inside Schwick's apartment where the package he orders Courage to retrieve is also situated. While not directly terrorising the protagonists, the girl initially has her back to Courage, but then turns and intimidates him with a scary face. However, she is later seen with a normal face, implying that she can terrify people when it suits her needs.\nRobot Randy\n:Voiced by Todd Stashwick\nRobot Randy is an outcast from a distant planet populated by gigantic violent robots. He is sent to conquer Earth to redeem his honor. Once on the planet, he enslaves Eustace, Muriel, and Courage, forcing them to build statues of him. However, he is internally conflicted, as he does not wish to hurt others, but instead to whittle reindeer. Courage challenges Randy in a competition to save the Bagges. When Courage wins, Randy releases them and returns to his planet, where he is accepted for his carving skills. His voice is based on Christopher Walken.\nThe Evil Eggplants\n: Voiced by Jason Antoon and Don Peoples\nThe Evil Eggplants are a group of talking eggplants that live under the Bagges' farm and are led by a large, deep purple eggplant and his dumb sidekick. They spy on the farm through a periscope placed in an eggplant Muriel grows. They decide to attack the farm because they are not getting enough water and because Muriel harvests the eggplant with the periscope, angering them because they believe it is unjust to eat eggplants. The eggplants take Muriel captive for her treatment of the eggplant, but Courage eventually saves her and floods the chasing army of eggplants, causing them to take root and leave the farm alone. This episode is the only time the eggplants make an appearance.\nEliza and Elisa Stitch\n: Voiced by Fran Brill\nEliza and Elisa Stitch are a pair of conjoined twin sisters who attempt to be immortal by sewing other women's souls into a quilt.

She only appears in the episode \"So in Louvre Are We Two\".\nThe Thinker\n: Voiced by Rod P. Houston\nThe Thinker is the masterpiece of Auguste Rodin who goes on a date with Mona Lisa during the episode.

He also only appears in the episode \"So in Louvre Are We Two\".\nConway the Contaminationist\n: Voiced by Peter Fernandez\nConway the Contaminationist is an elderly man claiming to be 193 years old, who also claims that a filthy environment is \"better\" and \"healthier\" than a clean one (\"Out with the good air, in with the bad\").

Not much is known about his parents or even their names during the series, although Courage's father was called Henry during one of the flashbacks, as they were seen only in the episode \"Remembrance of Courage Past\" centering on flashbacks to his parents in the veterinarian's office, where Courage last saw his parents. They were launched into space by the Cruel Veterinarian. Courage avoided a similar fate by escaping through a garbage chute, where he was found by Muriel. The Cruel Veterinarian was trapped (by Courage, during the vet's failed attempts to send him, Muriel and Eustace into space) in the rocket, and was launched in space, crash-landing on the planet where Courage's parents and other dogs resided.\nIn the prequel pilot Before Courage, their names were revealed to be Noble and Hope.\nKitty and Bunny\nVoiced by Barbara McCulloh & Lori Ann Mahl\nKitty and Bunny are a female cat and a rabbit who are girlfriends. They appeared in the episode \"The Mask\" where Bunny is held captive by her abusive boyfriend Mad Dog and Kitty tries to save her, unintentionally getting help from Courage even though he's kept in the dark about the situation and is terrified of Kitty. At the start of the episode, Kitty obscures her face with a mask and believes that all dogs are evil; as a result, she physically attacks Courage several times while staying at the Bagge house. Courage attempts to steal her favorite mouse toy in retaliation and runs away with it, but has a change of heart upon learning the truth about Kitty’s past and that the mouse was a gift from Bunny. Courage later rescues Bunny and defeats Mad Dog and his gang. Bunny kisses Courage on the cheek and Kitty awaits Bunny at the Amtrak passenger train's rear, where they both reunite. Bunny tells Kitty that Courage saved her life. Kitty then admits that she had been wrong about dogs and helps Bunny onto a train she was on. The two thank Courage and ride off together.

He is mentioned in the episodes \"The Sandwhale Strikes\" and \"Mother's Day\". His appearance is very close to Eustace's, except he has a beard. He was very brave and big; as Ma quotes, \"You [Eustace] couldn't fill his shoes!\". This is no exaggeration, as his shoes were rather huge compared to his son. It is unknown how his relationship with Eustace was, whether he treated Eustace poorly like Horst and Ma or he treated Eustace with respect.\nThe Duck Brothers\n:Voiced by Will Ryan\nThe Duck Brothers are three space ducks who are brothers.

Eustace then considers it a threat and decides to chop the tree down and Courage has to defend it for three days to cure Muriel. Although Eustace had a bit of sympathy, he chose to cut it down anyway despite its warnings of what would happen if he did. After the tree has been cut down and before it dies, it tells Courage how to cure Muriel. The tree had the last laugh against Eustace as the episode ended with Eustace's head swollen up just like Muriel's had been in retaliation for cutting it down.\nCarmen the Serpent\nVoiced by Vima Bauer\nCarmen the Serpent is a monstrous, one-eyed sea serpent who lives in the Evil River, and is \"evil\" according to a sea captain.
