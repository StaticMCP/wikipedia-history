King and written by him, along with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who together used the pseudonym Elmo Glick. According to King, the title is derived from, and was inspired by, a spiritual written by Sam Cooke and J. W. Alexander called \"Stand by Me Father\", recorded by the Soul Stirrers with Johnnie Taylor singing lead.\n\"Stand by Me\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 1986 film Stand by Me, and a corresponding music video, featuring King along with actors River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton, was released to promote the film. The song was also featured in a 1987 European commercial of Levi's 501 jeans, contributing to greater success in Europe. In 2012, its royalties were estimated to have topped $22.8 million (£17 million), making it the sixth highest-earning song of its era. Fifty percent of the royalties were paid to King. In 2015, King's original version was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", just under five weeks before his death. Later in the year, the 2015 lineup of the Drifters recorded it in tribute.\nThere have been over 400 recorded versions of the song, performed by many artists, notably Otis Redding, John Lennon, Demis Roussos, Muhammad Ali, 4 the Cause, Tracy Chapman, musicians of the Playing for Change project, Florence and the Machine, Weezer, and the Kingdom Choir. In 2018 it was performed by Maria José, former member of the band Kabah.\nWriting and recording\n(pictured in 1990s) originally sang the song, becoming a hit in the US in 1961 and again in 1986.]]\nIn 1960, Ben E. King was inspired to update the early 20th-century gospel hymn \"Stand by Me\" by Charles Albert Tindley, which was based on Psalm 46, \"will not we fear, though the Earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.\" According to the documentary ''History of Rock 'n' Roll'', King had no intention of recording the song himself. King had written it for the Drifters, who passed on recording it. After the \"Spanish Harlem\" recording session in 1960, King had some studio time left over. The session's producers, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, asked if he had any more songs. King played it on the piano for them. They liked it and called the studio musicians back in to record it.\nStoller recalls it differently:\nI remember arriving at our office as Jerry and Ben were working on lyrics for a new song. King had the beginnings of a melody that he was singing a cappella. I went to the piano and worked up the harmonies, developing a bass pattern that became the signature of the song. Ben and Jerry quickly finished the lyrics....\nIn another interview, Stoller said:\nBen E. had the beginnings of a song—both words and music. He worked on the lyrics together with Jerry, and I added elements to the music, particularly the bass line. To some degree, it's based on a gospel song called \"Lord Stand by Me\". I have a feeling that Jerry and Ben E. were inspired by it. Ben, of course, had a strong background in church music. He's a 50% writer on the song, and Jerry and I are 25% each.... When I walked in, Jerry and Ben E. were working on the lyrics to a song. They were at an old oak desk we had in the office. Jerry was sitting behind it, and Benny was sitting on the top. They looked up and said they were writing a song. I said, \"Let me hear it.\" ... Ben began to sing the song a cappella. I went over to the upright piano and found the chord changes behind the melody he was singing. It was in the key of A. Then I created a bass line. Jerry said, \"Man that's it!\" We used my bass pattern for a starting point and, later, we used it as the basis for the string arrangement created by Stanley Applebaum.\nThe personnel on the song included Romeo Penque on sax, Ernie Hayes on piano, Al Caiola and Charles McCracken on guitars, Lloyd Trotman on double bass, Phil Kraus on percussion, and Gary Chester on drums, plus a wordless mixed chorus and strings. Songwriting credits on the single were shown as King and Elmo Glick—a pseudonym used by Leiber and Stoller.\nStructure\nThe song uses a version of the common chord progression now called the '50s progression, which has been called the Stand by Me' changes\" after the song.\nRelease and reception\nKing's record went to number 1 on the R&B charts and was a Top Ten hit on the US charts twice—in its original release, entering the Billboard chart on May 13, 1961 and peaking at number 4 on June 16, 1961, and a 1986 re-release coinciding with its use as the theme song for the film of the same name following its appearance in the film, when it peaked at number 9 on December 20, 1986 – January 3, 1987. The song is also heard in the televised advertisement of Levi's 501 jeans. In the commercial, a man wearing a black denim jeans is able to enter a nightclub whose policy is \"no blue jeans\". \"Stand by Me\" also topped the charts in Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom upon its re-release. In the latter country, the song topped the UK Singles Chart in January 1987, mostly because of the jeans TV commercial, originally peaking at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart on its original release in Britain in 1961. Originally \"Stand by Me\"  was not released on an album until it had been out as a single for over a year, eventually appearing on King's ''Don't Play That Song! album in 1962.\n\"Stand by Me\" was ranked 122nd on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1999, BMI named it as the fourth most-performed song of the 20th century, with about seven million performances. On March 27, 2012, the Songwriters Hall of Fame announced that the song would receive its 2012 Towering Song Award and that King would be honored with the 2012 Towering Performance Award for his recording of it. In February 2019, the Smooth Radio network in the United Kingdom called it one \"of the best love songs of the 1960s\".\n\"Stand by Me\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.\nChart performance\nFor the year-end charts in the US, the song was the number 63 song of 1961 and number 67 of 1987.\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+1961 weekly chart performance for \"Stand by Me\"\n!Chart (1961)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada (CHUM Hit Parade)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot R&B Sides (Billboard'')\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"Stand by Me\" upon being used in the film of the same name\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1986–1987)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|82\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada (RPM)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+2022 weekly chart performance for \"Stand by Me\"\n!Chart (2022)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+Annual chart performance for \"Stand by Me\"\n!Chart (1986–1987)\n!Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop Flanders 1987)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|79\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Canada (RPM 1986)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|68\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Canada (RPM 1987)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|58\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|European Hot 100 Singles (1987)\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 1987)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|91\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100 1987)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|84\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (OCC 1987)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|US Top Pop Singles (Billboard 1987)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|67\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|West Germany (Official German Charts 1987)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21\n|}\nCertifications and sales\n}}\nJohn Lennon version\n| label         = Apple\n| producer      = John Lennon\n| prev_title    = Number 9 Dream\n| prev_year     = 1974\n| next_title    = (Just Like) Starting Over\n| next_year     = 1980\n| misc          = }}\n}}\nin summer 1975]]\nJohn Lennon recorded his version of the song for his 1975 album ''Rock 'n' Roll''. Lennon's remake became a single three weeks after the album's release and was his last hit prior to his five-year retirement from the music industry. Lennon filmed a performance of the song for The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1975.  Cash Box said of it that \"John's serenading guitar chords herald this bright new production of one of rockdom's favorites,\" and that it displays Lennon's \"magical, mysterious voice...at his finest.\"\nOn the week of May 3, 1975, this version was in its second of two weeks at the peak position number 20 on the US Hot 100, right in front of King's comeback hit \"Supernatural Thing – Part I\" at number 21.  Both tunes fell off the top 40 the next week and off the chart the week after that. Lennon's version stayed on top 100 of the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks, peaking at number 30 on its fourth week on the week of May 18–24, 1975. It peaked at number 13 on Canada's RPM Top Singles chart on the week ending May 3, 1975 and stayed on the peak position the following week. It peaked at number 11 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart on the week of July 14, 1975.\nThe single's B-side track is \"Move Over Ms. L\", initially intended for Lennon's previous album Walls and Bridges but was cut from the final lineup due to his dissatisfaction with his early takes. Keith Moon covered \"Move Over Ms. L\" for his 1975 solo album Two Sides of the Moon.\nBefore the parent album's official release, during Lennon's March 1974 sessions with Harry Nilsson for Nilsson's album Pussy Cats, Lennon recorded two takes of the song in collaboration with former Beatles member Paul McCartney. McCartney performed on the drums; Lennon on guitar. The unreleased recordings would eventually be included in a bootleg album ''A Toot and a Snore in '74.\nBillboard'' regarded Lennon's version as \"the best version since the original.\" Pitchfork writer Marc Hogan found Lennon's version \"more affecting (just barely)\" than the original due to the \"acoustic guitar and Lennon's fervent vocals\". A 2007 book The Words and Music of John Lennon by Ben Urish and Ken Bielen called Lennon's version one of the \"stronger\" tracks of the album. Journalist and book author Robert Webb in 2013 called this version one of the \"greatest cover versions\".\nPersonnel\nPersonnel per John Lennon Website\n* John Lennon – vocals, acoustic guitar\n* Jesse Ed Davis, Peter Jameson – electric guitar\n* Eddie Mottau – acoustic guitar\n* Ken Ascher – piano\n* Klaus Voormann – bass guitar\n* Joseph Temperly, Frank Vicari – saxophone\n* Dennis Morouse – tenor saxophone\n* Jim Keltner – drums\n* Arthur Jenkins – percussion\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1975)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|German Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|US Cashbox Top 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|}\nMickey Gilley version\n| label         = Epic\n| producer      = Jim Ed Norman\n| prev_title    = True Love Ways\n| prev_year     = 1980\n| next_title    = That's All That Matters\n| next_year     = 1980\n}}\nMickey Gilley released his version of the song in 1980, and it was included in the movie Urban Cowboy.

Ridley died eight months later.\nJohnson was inspired to film Ridley's performance and another thirty-six musicians' individual performances of the song \"around the world\" and then mix the clips into one music video. The music video was featured in an October 2008 episode of Bill Moyers Journal, where Johnson was promoting the documentary film Playing for Change: Peace Through Music, which includes the music video and was shown as part of the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. The music video was uploaded via the Playing for Change YouTube channel in November 2008, garnering more than 10&nbsp;million views in May 2009. The total amount of views of the YouTube video increased to more than 24&nbsp;million in December 2010, 30&nbsp;million in March 2011, 40 million in March 2012, 50&nbsp;million in some time between 2012 and 2014, 60&nbsp;million in 2014, 74&nbsp;million in May 2015, 100&nbsp;million in 2017, 140&nbsp;(or 142)&nbsp;million in March 2020, and 190&nbsp;million in November 2023.\nThe musicians' performance of the song would be later included in their 2009 debut album Songs Around the World. The debut album has nine other tracks, comes with the seven-track bonus DVD, and sold about 26,000 units on its first week, 85% of sales from online sales and \"nontraditional retail stores (including Starbucks locations)\" and 25% from outside the United States.\nPrince Royce version\n|label=Top Stop Music\n|producer=Sergio George, Eduardo Aguilar\n|prev_title=\n|prev_year=\n|next_title=Corazón Sin Cara\n|next_year=2010\n|misc=}}\n}}\nPrince Royce recorded a bachata version of the song as his debut single, changing parts of the lyrics into Spanish.

The critical and popular response was very positive, with James Christopher Monger of AllMusic praising Chapman's \"emotionally pitch-perfect, spotlight-stealing rendition\" of the song. Monger further said:With just her voice and an electric guitar, she managed to simultaneously bring the house down and build it back up again, which is no small feat, even for an artist who has proven herself time and again to be a powerful yet always benevolent force of nature. A recording of that live performance was released as the final track of Chapman's Greatest Hits the same year.\n|recorded=\n|studio=\n|venue=\n|genre=\n|length=\n|label=Island\n|producer=Benjamin Nelson\n|prev_title=Wish That You Were Here\n|prev_year=2016\n|next_title=Sky Full of Song\n|next_year=2018\n|misc=}}\n}}\nFlorence and the Machine recorded the song for the soundtrack and trailer of Final Fantasy XV in 2016.
