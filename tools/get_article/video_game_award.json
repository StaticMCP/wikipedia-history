Most video game awards are given out on an annual basis, celebrating the best games of the previous year.

In addition, many video game publications supply their own end of the year awards.\nVideo game industry awards\nBAFTA Gaming Awards\nThe British Academy Games Awards were launched in 2004 by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) to recognize video games.

A committee of about 300 members selected from the video game industry then review the submitted games and provide nominations to the various categories. A smaller committee of about fifteen members then create a shortlist of nominees for each category, including honorable mentions. These nominees are then expected to present at booth space for the IGF during the GDC event, with the developers given discounts for attending the conference.
