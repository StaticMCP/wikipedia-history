For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n10 Edw. 7 & 1 Geo. 5\nThe 29th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 15 February 1910 until 28 November 1910.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 10 Edw. 7, 10 Ed. 7, 10 E. 7, 10 Ed. 7 & 1 Geo. 5, 10 E. 7 & 1 G. 5 or 10 E. 7 & 1 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\nand the Appropriation Act, 1909, and to suspend in part the payment of the New Sinking Fund.|note4= }}\n|  and for other purposes incidental to that redemption.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |public|8|29-04-1910|maintained=y|repealed=n|archived=y|An Act to grant certain Duties of Customs and Inland Revenue (including Excise), to alter other Duties, and to amend the Law relating to Customs and Inland Revenue (including Excise), and to make other financial provisions.}}\n| |public|9|17-06-1910|repealed=y|archived=y|An Act to apply a sum out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand nine hundred and eleven.|note4= }}\n-\n| or the Police Superannuation (Scotland) Act 1910|public|10|26-07-1910|repealed=y|archived=y|An Act to amend the Police (Scotland) Act, 1890.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  with respect to the right of Aldermen to vote in the Election of Aldermen and Mayor.|note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| }}\n|\n-\n|  with respect to way-going valuations.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|   as a Company limited by shares to convert existing stock of the Company into shares and increase the capital of the Company to convert the Globe Six per Cent.
