Alphonse Ouimet, felt the need to assure the audience that videotape would not surpass film in importance to the CBC. Television, now occupying filmmakers' attention, brought about a consistent rise in revenue. Its newfound significance prompted the introduction of new CFA awards for TV, with the CBC clinching all the eligible awards.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: Universe — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer.
