It began as the MTV Movie Awards in 1992, when its first edition was held, and adopted its current name in 2017, beginning with its 26th edition.\nThe awards ceremony has traditionally been tied to the start of the summer blockbuster season for the film industry, and since the launch of the television awards, the opening of that industry's awards season. The nominees are decided by producers and executives at MTV. The winners are then decided by the general public. Presently, voting is done only through an official MTV Movie & TV Awards voting website. Winners are presented with the \"Golden Popcorn\" statue made by New-York-firm Society Awards.\nThe 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards were the most recent as the event was not held in 2024 or 2025.\nProduction process\nFor much of its history, the ceremony was recorded for later broadcast, unlike the MTV Video Music Awards, which are usually live, but not live-to-tape, where the ceremony occurred in chronological order with appropriate edits. This meant that the ceremony was recorded out of order with the host segments recorded all at the start, followed by the musical performances and then award presentations, where those artists and actors nominated could choose to stay only for their award category and then depart after, with a seat filler filling their seat before or afterwards. After 2006, when Survivor producer Mark Burnett (who took over duties from Joel Gallen for the 2007 awards) took over production duties, it began to be broadcast live most years, though since 2017, it has been recorded live-to-tape, with a one or two-day delay before airing.\nSince 2007, polls for several awards have been voted on through MTV's web and social media presences.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 awards were cancelled. Internally, the network had discussed a permanent move of the ceremony to December, which would place it in the early portion of awards season before the Golden Globe Awards. Instead, MTV aired a Vanessa Hudgens-hosted clip show, MTV Movie & TV Awards: Greatest of All Time, on December 6, 2020, which featured highlights from past ceremonies and highlighted notable moments from film and television since the 1980s.\nThe network stated that it aimed to hold a larger, weekend-long ceremony in 2021. On March 11, 2021, MTV announced that the 2021 MTV Movie & TV Awards would be held on May 16 and 17, 2021, with the first night focusing on films and scripted television, and a new, second night (MTV Movie & TV Awards: Unscripted) focusing exclusively on awards in reality television. The 2022 ceremony maintained the split format, but with both segments airing back-to-back on a single night. The 2023 ceremony was originally to be hosted by Drew Barrymore, but Barrymore and other planned guests dropped out in solidarity with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. As a result, the in-person ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a pre-recorded virtual ceremony with no host. In May 2024, MTV cancelled the 2024 edition, and in March 2025, they cancelled the 2025 edition.\nAward categories\nCurrent awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Category !! Year(s) !!

This may include sound and video montages, replacing some of the original cast with other actors (commonly, the hosts of each year's show) generally mocking the scenes of that film. The diversity of the spoofs can vary greatly, from one dialogue (such as in 2005) to several long scenes, including fighting and action sequences (2003).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ MTV Movie Awards Film Spoofs by Year\n|-\n!| Year\n! width=350 | Film\n!| Starring\n!| Watch\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1993\n| Basic Instinct\n| Florence Henderson Barry Williams Christopher Knight  Susan Olsen\n|\n|-\n| A Few Good Men\n| Florence Henderson Barry Williams Christopher Knight\n|\n|-\n| The Bodyguard\n| Florence Henderson Barry Williams\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1994\n| The Fugitive\n| The Monkey Troupe\n|\n|-\n| Jurassic Park\n| Charlton Heston The Monkey Troupe\n|\n|-\n| The Piano\n| The Monkey Troupe\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 1995\n| Speed\n| Danny Bonaduce Shirley Jones Dave Madden\n|\n|-\n| Pulp Fiction\n| Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs Robert Hegyes Ron Palillo\n|\n|-\n| Dumb and Dumber\n| Sherman Hemsley Isabel Sanford Franklin Cover\n|\n|-\n| Interview with the Vampire\n| Frank Gorshin Adam West\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 1996\n| Twister\n| Ben Stiller Janeane Garofalo Jay Leno\n|\n|-\n| Braveheart\n| Bob NewhartJack RileyPeter BonerzBill Daily\n|\n|-\n| Clueless\n| The Golden Girls\n|\n|-\n| Seven\n| William Shatner (in all three key roles)\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1997\n| The Lost World: Jurassic Park\n| Vince Vaughn Ben Stiller Mike Myers Janeane Garofalo  Jay Leno\n|\n|-\n| Romeo + Juliet\n| Mike Myers as Austin Powers  Jenny McCarthy\n|\n|-\n| Scream\n| Mike Myers Drew Barrymore\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1998\n| Godzilla, Taxi (combined in one video)\n| Christopher Lloyd (as Jim Ignatowski) Samuel L.
