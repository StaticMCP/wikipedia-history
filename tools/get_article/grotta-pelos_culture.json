Specifically, it is the period that marks the beginning of the so-called Cycladic culture and spans the Neolithic period in the late 4th millennium BC (ca. 3300 BC), continuing in the Bronze Age to about 2700 BC.\nThe term was coined by Colin Renfrew, who named it after the sites of Grotta and Pelos on the Cycladic islands of Naxos and Milos, respectively. Other archaeologists prefer a \"chronological\" dating system and refer to this period as the Early Cycladic I (ECI).\nSee also\n*Keros-Syros culture\n*Kastri culture\n*Phylakopi I culture\n*History of the Cyclades\n*Cycladic art\nExternal links\n*[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=67 The Chronology and Terminology of Aegean Prehistory] , Dartmouth Aegean prehistoric archaeology\nReferences"
