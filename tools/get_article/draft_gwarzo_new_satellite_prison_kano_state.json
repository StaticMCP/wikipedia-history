These facilities serve local areas and are usually smaller than central jails.  In January 2018, the National Stakeholders Committee on Prisons Reform and Decongestion, in partnership with the Kano State Ministry of Justice, secured the release of 368 convicts from several prisons in Kano State, including Gwarzo Satellite Prison.  Inmates who had been held for long periods of time without being given a trial or who were unable to pay penalties were included in this program, which sought to alleviate prison overpopulation.\nReferences"
