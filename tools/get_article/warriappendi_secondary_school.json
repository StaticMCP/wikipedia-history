Established in the early to mid 1980s by community members Leila Rankine and her sister Veronica Brodie, the school has undergone several moves. It opened its new building in Thebarton on 3 November 2025, at which time there are  around 80 students enrolled. There is space for growth, to accommodate up to 150 students.\nHistory\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, teachers and parents found that mainstream South Australian schools were not suitable for all children, especially a large group of Aboriginal children who lived in the south-eastern corner of Adelaide city centre. Leila Rankine (1992–1993) and her sister Veronica Brodie (1941–2007) are regarded as the founders of the school as it was by their efforts that it was established. They also contributed to its ongoing development through subsequent moves.\nThe Department of Education rented a room from the Church of England in Moore street, at the location of the St Mary Magdalene's Church, which was called the South-East Corner School for a while. In mid-1980, a new school, the Moore Street Alternative School, was established on the site. This was a co-educational secondary school for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students who were not doing well in mainstream schools. Greg Winner was appointed as principal, and around 30 students enrolled at the school initially.\nThe building was in poor condition, so the Education Department obtained 25 Naldera Street in Glandore, which at different times in its history been the site of Edwardstown Girls Reformatory (1891–1898); Edwardstown Industrial School (1898–1949); Glandore Industrial School (1949–1958); Glandore Children's Home (1958–1966); renamed Glandore Boys' Home in 1966, eventually being closed on 4 February 1973.}} Staff and programs were developed on this site.\nA new home was found for it on the site of the Richmond Infant School on South Road, Marleston, in February 1983, when it was renamed Warriappendi.}} and in consultation with Kaurna people. The word Warriappendi means \"to seek\" or \"searching for\" in the Kaurna language, and marked the first time that Kaurna people themselves had chosen ta Kaurna word for public naming purposes.\nIn February 2025, Warriappendi Secondary School relocated to a new site in John Street, Thebarton, due to the River Torrens to Darlington road-building project.\nDescription and governance\nWarriappendi Secondary School is a high school for Aboriginal students, located at 7 Ann Nelson Drive, Thebarton.  around 80 students are enrolled at the school. , Craig Bailey is principal of the school.\nThe school accommodates up to 150 students, and includes spaces for yarning, cultural learning, drama and music, as well as STEM laboratories, a library, a commercial kitchen, visual and digital arts spaces, and a  gymnasium.\nBuilding\nThe new building, which opened on 3 November 2025, was designed by JPE Design Studio and built by BADGE Constructions, in consultation with the school community and with employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers in mind.\nA large mural, titled Foundation of the Future, was painted at the front entrance of the school by Aboriginal artist Scott Rathman. According to Rathman, the design \"represents the school community's journey, recognising the foundations laid at the old school site that shape the present and building new foundations at the new site for future generations.. The central spiral symbolises continuous growth through learning with pathways reflecting the diverse journeys, all interconnected, strengthening our shared experiences and developing community...\".\nPrograms\nAt Warriappendi, a program was developed using sport to help students learn about their cultures and histories. This has been taken up by other schools, and the South Australian Aboriginal Sports Training Academy (SAASTA) was established in 2005. Warriappendi is a member of the academy.\nSee also\n*Tauondi Aboriginal College, an independent college in Port Adelaide\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
