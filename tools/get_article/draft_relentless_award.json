Established in 2015 in honor of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, the playwriting award celebrates works that are challenging, fearless, passionate, and relentlessly truthful, reflecting Hoffman's commitment to truth in theater. It offers the largest cash prize in American theater for an unproduced play, providing $50,000 as of 2024, along with developmental support.\nThe Relentless Musical Award, introduced in 2022 to honor both Hoffman and composer Adam Schlesinger, extends similar recognition to unproduced musicals with a $65,000 prize. Since its inception the award has been instrumental in launching careers, with winners achieving Pulitzer Prize finals, Obie Awards, and major productions.\nHistory\nThe Relentless Award and the American Playwriting Foundation were founded in 2015 by writer David Bar Katz, using funds he won in a settlement of his libel lawsuit against The National Enquirer. The tabloid, discovering that Katz was the last friend Hoffman had texted and was the person to discover him, became the target of their mistaken reporting, since they had contacted the wrong 'David Katz' who made false claims about their sexual relationship and drug use. Katz channeled the settlement into creating the award to honor Hoffman's legacy of supporting playwrights and pursuing truthful storytelling in theater.\nThe Relentless Musical Award was launched in 2022, honoring Adam Schlesinger, (known for his work on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Fountains of Wayne) who had been an Artistic Advisor for the founding of the initial award in honor of Hoffman. Shayok Misha Chowdhury and Laura Grill Jaye won the inaugural 2022 Relentless Musical Award for their work, “How the White Girl Got Her Spots and Other 90s Trivia.”\nSelection process\nThe process is blind - Entries are evaluated anonymously by a committee of distinguished theater professionals. The criteria emphasize works that challenge conventions, exhibit fearlessness, exude passion, and pursue relentless truth, mirroring Hoffman's artistic ethos.\nThe selection committee consists of prominent theater artists, chosen because of their connection to either Hoffman or Schlesinger. Past and current judges for the playwriting award include\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

Winners shared a $45,000 prize pool and had their works performed at Theatre Row in New York by the Relentless Theater Company, featuring actors such as David Corenswet, Vincent D'Onofrio, Tavi Gevinson, and Hari Nef.\nImpact\nThe New York Times has highlighted the awards role in fostering \"relentlessly truthful\" works. “People on the lookout for fierce talent and boldly adventuresome plays have learned to take a cue from the Relentless Award.” Lynn Nottage, a judge, noted: “At a moment when the impulse of young writers is to craft plays that are small, tidy and producible, the Relentless Award celebrates writing that disrupts, that is messy, that is ambitious and that reaches for the impossible.”  Aleshea Harris, the 2016 winner for Is God Is, has speaking on the award's personal impact: \"The Relentless Award gave me the confidence to continue writing in my unique voice, knowing that there are people who value bold, truthful storytelling.\"\nNotable accomplishments of Relentless Winners:\n* Sarah DeLappe's The Wolves (2015): Pulitzer finalist, Obie for ensemble, over 500 productions worldwide, premiered at Lincoln Center.\n* Clare Barron's Dance Nation (2015): Pulitzer finalist, premiered at Playwrights Horizons, praised for its bold exploration of adolescence.\n* Aleshea Harris's Is God Is (2016): Four Obie Awards, productions at Soho Rep and Royal Court Theatre, upcoming feature film.\n* Harrison David Rivers' The Bandaged Place (2018): Premiered at Roundabout Theatre Company, addressing trauma and healing.\nReferences"
