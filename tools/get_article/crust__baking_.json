It may also include milk, sugar, or other ingredients that contribute to the taste or texture. An egg or milk wash can be used to decorate the outside, as well as coarse sugar. A crust contributes to a pastry.\nThe ratio of ingredients and mixing method determines the texture of the crust. If the flour is not well mixed with the shortening, then water can bind to the available flour causing the gluten protein matrix to become over developed. This would result in a tough crust, as opposed to a flaky crust, which is more desirable.\nDepending on the type of pastry, the crust can be baked before it is filled, or in baked (baked together with the filling). In pies, two different types of crust exist: one-crust pie and two-crust pie. A two-crust pie can have either a complete upper crust, a lattice top, or any of a variety of other decorative tops.\nTypes\nIn baking there are many types of crusts and doughs for these crusts depending on what you are trying to achieve. In pastries there are five different types of dough you can use as the crust; flaky, shortcrust, puff, choux and filo.\n;Flaky: Flaky crust is a delicate crust but very easy to make. Flaky crust can be used for sweet and savory treats. An example of a flaky crust is it can be used as the crust for a quiche.\n;Shortcrust: Shortcrust is a thicker crust. It is good for thicker treats like cookies.\n;Puff: Puff pastry crust is similar to flaky crust but is slightly lighter and may possibly be layered. Puff pastry is good for bakers and is what makes things like a chocolate croissant.\n;Choux: Choux is kind of like a shell when finished. It is also known for being paired with cream. Choux is good for things like eclairs or cannolis.\n;Filo: Filo is very delicate and similar to puff. Filo is used in a lot of savory Greek foods like spanokopita.\nPies also use different types of crust depending on the flavor and idea a person is going for. There are eight main types of pie crust; Flaky, Tender, Hot Water, Sweet crust, Crostata, Creamcheese, Cornmeal, graham cracker or other cookie type, and Rough puff. Any of these crusts could work for any pie but the tastes are slightly different. When making a pie, a crust should be chosen which one will taste the best and hold in the filling.\nSee also\n* Graham cracker crust – a pie crust made from crushed crackers\n* Maillard reaction\nReferences"
