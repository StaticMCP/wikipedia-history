It connects the German city of Bad Säckingen with the village of Stein in Switzerland. The covered bridge spans  over the Hochrhein and is the longest roofed wooden bridge in Europe. The bridge is listed as a national registered monument in Switzerland (Kulturgut von nationaler Bedeutung im Kanton Aargau).\nThe bridge was built in 1272 and was destroyed several times (1570, 1633, 1678). The current bridge was completed in 1700. Originally a road bridge, the bridge is now only open for pedestrians since the Fridolinsbrücke (Swiss name: Rheinbrücke Stein) was opened in 1979 for road traffic.\nFile:120827-Bad-Säckingen-04.jpg|inside\nFile:120827-Bad-Säckingen-03.jpg|Entrance in Switzerland\nFile:120827-Bad-Säckingen-05.jpg|Entrance in Switzerland\nFile:120827-Bad-Säckingen-06.jpg|The boundary line in the middle of the Rhine\nSee also\n*List of bridges over the Rhine\n* List of bridges in Germany\n* List of bridges in Switzerland\n* List of international bridges\n*Other big wooden bridges in Switzerland\n**Kapellbrücke\n**Auguetbrücke\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
