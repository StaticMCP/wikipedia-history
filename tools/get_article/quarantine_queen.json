Inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, the album was written, recorded, and produced by Hall in the week leading up to its release on April 29, 2020. A music video was released for \"Mask, Gloves, Soap, Scrubs\" the same day.\nComposition\nThe EP features six songs about life in the age of COVID-19. The first track is \"Mas(k)ot\", a spoof on \"Bootylicious\" by Destiny's Child that calls out all the events that have been cancelled because of the virus. It features a cheerleading theme and features Jerry Harris from the Netflix series Cheer. \"Tiktok\" is about the app of the same name. \"Meow\" is about the television program Tiger King, notable for its popularity during the pandemic. \"Mask, Gloves, Soap, Scrubs\", is a parody of Hall's song \"Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels\" from Haus Party, Pt. 1\nFollowing the arrest of Jerry Harris in September 2020 for allegedly soliciting sex from minors, the track Mas(k)ot was removed from all streaming platforms and download stores.\nTrack listing\n| total_length = 18:35\n| title1 = Mas(k)ot\n| note1 = featuring Jerry Harris\n| length1 = 2:56\n| title2 = Werk Out\n| length2 = 3:32\n| title3 = Rent\n| length3 = 2:55\n| title4 = Tiktok\n| length4 = 2:07\n| title5 = Meow\n| note5 = featuring Rhea Litre\n| length5 = 3:04\n| title6 = Mask, Gloves, Soap, Scrubs\n| length6 = 3:58\n}}\nReferences"
