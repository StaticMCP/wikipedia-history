In it, McCarthy looked at various spiritual practices from across the globe, looking at both long standing traditional beliefs as well as 'alternate' religions which began to flourish in the 1990s. He met a variety of practitioners and participated in their rituals. It ran for three series, with the first two series focusing on practitioners located in the British Isles. The second series looked more at Christian and Pagan sects, including the Fellowship of Isis and the Golden Dawn. The third series saw him looking at world traditional beliefs like Australian Aboriginal beliefs and Hawaiian religion.\nBefore going on what would be referred to as a \"spiritual journey\", McCarthy said \"I've taken on the role of everyman, I'm like lots of people who have given up religion and never replaced it with anything else.\"\nEpisodes\nA complete list of episodes.
