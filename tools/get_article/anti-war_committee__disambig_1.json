The Anti-War Committee grew out of the Twin Cities chapter of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), which had been active since the early 1980s.\nMission and focus\nThe mission of the Anti-War Committee is to organize a broad-based movement which stands in solidarity with those communities, here and abroad who are adversely affected by U.S. foreign policies. Its members believe that the U.S. government has no right to intervene, militarily, economically or politically, in the affairs of independent nations. The Anti-War Committee calls for immediate withdrawal of all coalition troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, and has collaborated with other groups to organize protests toward that goal.\nThe Anti-War Committee was the first organization to apply for permits and announce plans to protest at the 2008 Republican National Convention, which was held in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nOn September 24, 2010, the Anti-War Committee's office was raided by the FBI. Several of its leading members also had their homes raided by the FBI. The Anti-War Committee is being investigated for \"material support for terrorism\". The AWC feels they are being targeted by the FBI for their solidarity work with Palestine and Colombia and were a part of founding the Committee to Stop FBI Repression nationally to defend their right to organize and protest.\nCoalitions and other issues\nThe Anti-War Committee participates in the Iraq Peace Action Coalition (IPAC) now called the Minnesota Peace Action Coalition. The AWC also concerns itself with other issues, such as supporting striking unions, such as during the Northwest Airlines Mechanics strike in 2005-2006; and participating in the immigrant rights protests of 2006.\nSee also\n*Junkyard Empire\n* List of anti-war organizations\nMedia coverage\n*[http://www.fightbacknews.org/2008/09/anti-war-march-challenges-mccain-on-day-4-of-rnc.htm Anti-war march challenges McCain on last day of RNC: Crowd repeatedly tear gassed, 396 arrested as police pull out all stops to prevent anti-war march from reaching Xcel Center] Fight Back!
