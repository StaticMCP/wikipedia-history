The Fazakerley North ward was created as a single-member ward from the northern quarter of the former Fazakerley ward. The ward boundaries follow the Kirkby branch of the Northern Line, the southern edge of Aintree Racecourse, Warbreck Moor, Hall Lane, Longmoor Lane, and Higher Lane.}}\n§Helen Stephens was a re-standing councillor for Fazakerley ward.\nReferences"
