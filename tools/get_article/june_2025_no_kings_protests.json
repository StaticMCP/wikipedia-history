Protests took place on June14, 2025 (labeled as No Kings Day by the participants), on the same day as the U.S. Army 250th Anniversary Parade and Trump's 79th birthday. Further No Kings protests took place on October 18, 2025.\nOrganizers estimated that more than five million people participated in more than 2,100 cities and towns, including the flagship event in Philadelphia. More protests took place in the U.S. territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, and in 20 foreign countries, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, and in Europe. In countries with constitutional monarchies such as Canada and the United Kingdom, the alternate \"Dictators\" or \"Tyrants\" titles were favored over \"Kings\" to avoid confusion with anti-monarchic movements; Hawaii did the same to avoid confusion with a King Kamehameha Day parade held on the same day.\nBackground\n, White House social media posted an image depicting Trump as a king, and Trump and his allies referred to him with monarchical terminology and claims of divine legitimacy.]]\nThe No Kings protests were organized by Indivisible and other progressive organizations as part of a coalition of more than 200 groups, including 50501, the Third Act Movement, American Federation of Teachers, Social Security Works, Communications Workers of America, American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen and MoveOn. The event aimed to protest the policies and actions of the Donald Trump administration, including his purported fascist tendencies and associated democratic backsliding in the United States. Its name and theme reflect Trump's own contention that he is a \"king\" and several posts by his administration that depict him as a monarch.\nIndivisible's Ezra Levin told MSNBC,\n}}\nThe June 14 demonstrations built on previous nationwide \"No Kings\" protests, notably the nationwide \"No Kings on Presidents Day\" event on February 17, and others on April 19. They also followed other protests of Trump and his second-term policies, involving dozens of smaller protests against his mass-deportation efforts – including a weeks-long series of protests in Los Angeles,}} to which the president had responded by deploying the California National Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps.\nThe date of the No Kings protest was chosen to coincide with the U.S. Army 250th Anniversary Parade, which was also Trump's 79th birthday, and which critics argued politicized the military and mimicked displays typically seen in authoritarian regimes. No official No Kings protests were held in Washington, D.C., where the Army parade took place, \"to keep the focus on contrast, and not give the Trump administration an opportunity to stoke and then put the focus on conflict\", said Indivisible's Leah Greenberg.\nTrump publicly opposed the demonstrations. \"I don't feel like a king\", he said, adding a threat to people who protest at the parade in DC: \"For those people that want to protest, they're going to be met with very big force.\"\nIndivisible Abroad, the collective of recognized Indivisible international chapters for Americans abroad, primarily led international organizing for No Kings / No Tyrants events around the world. Democrats Abroad also organized solidarity protests internationally in response to the national day of action called for by the No Kings organizers.\nBecause many countries have monarchs as heads of state, some events were labeled as \"No Tyrants\" demonstrations instead, to keep focus of protests on the Trump Administration, with the message of \"We reject authoritarianism. We reject fear. We reject tyrants.\"\nTurnout\nOrganizers estimated that more than five million people participated in more than 2,100 cities and towns across the country, according to statements by No Kings and the American Civil Liberties Union, a co-sponsor of the protests. Politico estimated turnout in the millions and described them as the largest coordinated protests since the start of the second Trump administration.\nA crowdsourcing effort to tally participation was led by data journalist G. Elliott Morris, who wrote on June 15 that \"back-of-the-envelope math\" put total attendance \"somewhere in the 4–6 million people range. That means roughly 1.2–1.8% of the U.S. population attended a No Kings Day event somewhere in the country yesterday.\" According to The Guardian, one estimate suggests that this was among the biggest ever single-day protests in US history.\nProtests by U.S. state\nAlabama\nIn Mobile, where organizers reported receiving threats ahead of the rally, an estimated crowd of 2,000 people gathered.
