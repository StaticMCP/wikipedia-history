One of its two prominent plant communities is a dense coastal dune shrubland composed of medium shrubs, such as coast wattle and coast beard-heath, above a ground cover of grasses, herbs and sedges.  The other is a mosaic of aquatic herbland, coastal saltmarsh and damp saline pasture, composed of species such as beaded glasswort, creeping brookweed, shiny swamp-mat, buck's-horn plantain and fat-hen.\nBirds\nThe site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a breeding population of hooded plovers and serves as a wintering site for orange-bellied parrots.\nReferences"
