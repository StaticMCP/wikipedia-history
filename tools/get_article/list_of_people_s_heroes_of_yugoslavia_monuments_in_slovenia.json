Many busts and memorials were built in honor of each People's hero. Each of them usually had a bust in his birthplace or at the place of his death. Most of these monuments are built in figurative style, but some of them were completely abstract, for example, monument of Ivo Lola Ribar, built at Glamoč field in 1962.\nMonument list\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Name\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Josip Broz Tito\n|Velenje,\nSlovenia\n|Dedicated to Josip Broz Tito, leader of the People's liberation struggle, a triple People's hero of Yugoslavia and the president of SFR Yugoslavia (1953–1980).\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Edvard Kardelj\n|Ljubljana,\nSlovenia\n|Designed by Drago Tršar, built in 1981.\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Boris Kidrič\n|Ljubljana,\nSlovenia\n|Built in 1959.\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Boris Kidrič\n|Maribor, Slovenia\n|Designed by Stojan Batič, built in 1963.\n|-\n|\n|Monument of Anton Tomšič - Tone\n|Ljubljana, Slovenia\n|Designed by Boris Kalin.\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Franc Rozman – Stane\n|Novo Mesto,\nSlovenia\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Jakob Molek - Mohor\n|Kamnik, Slovenia\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Majda Vrhovnik\n|Ljubljana, Slovenia\n|Designed by Stojan Batič, built in 1961.\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Janko Premrl\n|Slovenia\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bust of Josip Broz Tito\n|Ljubljana, Slovenia\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*List of People's Heroes of Yugoslavia monuments\n*List of People's Heroes of Yugoslavia monuments in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n*List of People's Heroes of Yugoslavia monuments in North Macedonia\n*List of People's Heroes of Yugoslavia monuments in Serbia\n*List of Yugoslav World War II monuments and memorials\n*List of World War II monuments and memorials in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n*List of World War II monuments and memorials in Croatia\n*List of World War II monuments and memorials in North Macedonia\n*List of World War II monuments and memorials in Serbia\n*List of World War II monuments and memorials in Slovenia"
