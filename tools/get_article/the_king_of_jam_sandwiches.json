Sometimes his dad would wake him up in the middle of the night to talk about dying. He would at times leave without telling Robbie where he's going. Once he was gone for more than a week.  Robbie was terrified of being left alone but could tell no one, fearing even more that he could be placed in foster care if anyone knew.\nThis all changes when Robbie is asked to show Harmony, a new student, and a  tough fast talking foster child, around school. On day one, she punches him in the face.  After realizing they both have a lot in common, they become close friends.  Robbie is however unsure whether he can trust her enough to share his secret.\nAwards\nThe King of Jam Sandwiches won the 2020 Governor General’s Literary Award for Young People's Literature – Text.\nReception\nThe novel was generally well received.  Deborah Dundas of the Toronto Star writes,  \"He provides an intimate and hopeful perspective and a glimpse into a world we rarely see closely enough to understand.\"  In the weekly Canadian Review of Materials, Teresa Iaizz from the Toronto Public Library finds it, \"written in a nonjudgmental and compassionate way\", \"allows children to better understand a very serious topic.\" Amanda Toth at the School Library Journal writes, \"Highly recommended for most middle grade sections.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
