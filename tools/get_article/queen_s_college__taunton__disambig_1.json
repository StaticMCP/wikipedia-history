It is a day/boarding school for pupils aged 0–18. The school incorporates nursery, pre-prep, prep, and senior schools. The current Head of College is Julian Noad. Henry Matthews is headmaster of Queen's College Prep School.\nHistory\nFirst known as the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute, Queen's College was established by the Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1843. Originally located in the Norman Castle in the town centre, the school opened with 34 pupils on 12 July 1843.\nUnder the headship of Thomas Sibly (1813-1892) the school outgrew the old school classrooms and so a new building was commissioned in 1845 in the Trull area. Due to the increasing popularity of the school, they were forced to vacate the castle premises in 1847 and move into the new building before it was finished. The current school building is a symmetrical Tudor Gothic building built by Giles and Gane in 1845 and has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. The original school site consisted of the main school building and upper playing fields. Since then the buildings have expanded, with the bridge and library (now known as the Old Music Room) being added to the school in the 1920s. This addition was built in commemoration, along with the obelisk on the front lawn, for those who served in the First World War.\nPresent day\nThe school sits in approximately  of grounds.\nSince the 1970s the school has been co-educational with both female and male boarding houses being present on the school grounds.  In 2016 the school appointed their first female head teacher, Lorraine Earps. Earps was replaced by Julian Noad on 12 August 2021.\nThe school is part of the Methodist Independent Schools Trust.\nNotable former pupils\nFormer pupils are known as Old Queenians, and include:\n* Ben Ackland, Irish cricketer\n* Augustus Molade Akiwumi, former Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana and justice of the Supreme Court of Ghana\n* Tom Austen, English actor, known for his television appearances portraying Jasper Frost on The Royals and Guy Hopkins on Grantchester\n* John Baron, Conservative Party MP\n* Sir Robert Bond, prime minister of Newfoundland 1900–1909\n* Richard Browning, inventor of a \"jet suit\"; founder and chief test pilot of 'Gravity Industries'\n* Arthur Henry Reginald Buller, mycologist and President of the Royal Society of Canada\n* Matthew Clay, 2006 Commonwealth Games Gold Medallist in Swimming\n* Carrie Davis, Radio 1 sports analyst\n* Sir Nicholas Barton \"Nick\" Harvey, Liberal Democrat MP\n* Sir Robert Hart&nbsp;— Inspector-General of China's Imperial Maritime Customs Service 1863–1907\n* Arthur Henderson, British Labour politician, Baron Rowley of Rowley Regis, Secretary of State for Air 1947–1951\n* Peter Honess, Oscar-nominated, BAFTA award-winning Hollywood film editor (L.
