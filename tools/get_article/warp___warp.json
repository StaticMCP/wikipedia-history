It was released by Rock-Ola in North America as Warp Warp. The game was ported to the Sord M5 and MSX. A sequel, Warpman, was released in 1985 for the Family Computer with additional enemy types, power-ups, and improved graphics and sound.\nGameplay\nThe player controls a \"Monster Fighter\", who must destroy tongue-sticking aliens named \"Berobero\" (a Japanese onomatopoeic word for licking) on two different screens, the free-movement Space World and the obstacle-filled Maze World. Controls consist of a four-position joystick and a button.\nBerobero appear at the corners of the screen and begin to move around randomly, changing color and increasing in value as they approach the center. In Space World, the player can shoot and destroy them by pressing the button, while avoiding the bullets that the Berobero fire back. Destroying three consecutive Berobero of the same color causes a bonus alien to appear, which can be shot for extra points. In Maze World, the player must press the button to set time-delay bombs and catch the Berobero in their explosions; the length of the delay is set by holding the button down. The Berobero do not fire at the player on this screen, and no bonus aliens will appear; however, the player can score extra points by destroying multiple Berobero with one bomb.\nTwo horizontal bars at the center of the screen constitute the Warp Zone, which flashes on occasion to indicate that it is active (with the Katakana text  in the Japanese version or the English text \"WARP\" in the US versions). On either screen, stepping into the Warp Zone while it is active will immediately transport the player to the other one. Once all Berobero in a level have been destroyed, as indicated by counters in the corners of the screen, a new one begins in Space World.\nOne life is lost whenever the player touches a monster or alien, is hit by a bullet, or gets caught in a bomb explosion. The game ends when all lives are lost.\nReception\n| TILT = 3/20 (MSX)\n| rev1 = MSX Club Magazine\n| rev1Score = 8.5/10\n}}\nIn a retrospective review, AllGame compared its gameplay to Wizard of Wor and Bomberman, describing it as \"an obscure but endearing maze shooter\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
