The body is 8–12 mm long, and the dorsal side is black with white hair spots. The species occurs across a large part of mainland Australia. It is a kleptoparasite, using bees from the Amegilla genus as hosts.\nTaxonomy\nThe Waroona cuckoo bee was first described by American entomologist Theodore D. A. Cockerell, who named it Crocisa waroonensis in 1913. He named it after the town of Waroona in Western Australia, which is where the holotype was found. The species was re-described as Thyreus waroonensis by Dutch entomologist Maurits Lieftinck in 1962.\nDescription\nThe body is 8–12mm long and the forewings are 7.5–10mm long. The dorsal side is black with white hair spots. The forewings are translucent near the body and smoky black over the distal half. The hindwings are mostly translucent, but gradually darkening over the tips.\nThe overall appearance is similar to T. caeruleopunctatus, but T. waroonensis has longer and more slender antennae.\nDistribution and habitat\nThis species occurs across a large part of mainland Australia, and it has also been recorded on Rottnest Island.\nBehaviour and ecology\nThyreus waroonensis is kleptoparasitic, with some Amegilla species serving as the hosts. When the host bee is absent, the Waroona cuckoo bee enters the Amegilla nest and bites a small hole in the cap of a freshly sealed cell. She then places an egg near the host egg and repairs the hole in the cell. The T. waroonensis larva has enlarged mandibles which it uses to kill the host egg and eat the cell provisions. It is believed the Amegilla host species include A. chlorocyanea and A. calva.\nThyreus waroonensis has been observed collecting nectar from the flowers of various species, including Eucalyptus and Melaleuca.\nReferences"
