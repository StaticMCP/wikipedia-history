It is a -story, stuccoed stone Pennsylvania farmhouse built in five stages.  The earliest stages dates to about 1780 and 1795.  Later modifications occurred by 1838, in about 1889 with its remodeling to the Queen Anne style, then about 1910. It features a wraparound porch with turned supports, spindlework, and round brackets. The house was adapted for use as a restaurant in 1948. Also on the property is a contributing -story, stone and frame bank barn with a gable roof.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.\nReferences"
