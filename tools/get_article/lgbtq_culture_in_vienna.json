Vienna is considered Austria's queer capital, with several LGBTQIA+ spaces, organisations and a history of LGBTQIA+ activism going back to the late 19th century.\nHistory of LGBT culture of Vienna\nLate 19th century and early 20th century\nin 2019]]\nVienna was an important city for progressive thinkers and researchers around sexuality in the late 19th century. Austrian-Hungarian activist and author Karl Maria Kertbeny, who coined the terms homosexuality and heterosexuality, was socialized in the Viennese arts scene. Psychialist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, who was an influence on Magnus Hirschfeld's activities in Berlin, was active in Vienna. Eugen Steinach was important in developing the first sex reassignment surgery, also with Hirschfeld.\nVienna had a vibrant gay and lesbian culture in the Interwar period during the time of Red Vienna, when the Social Democratic Party had unilateral control of the city. LGBT people were criminalised, but still several LGBT spaces existed. An example in literature is Grete von Urbanitzky who was a Viennese-based author. In 1927, she published her novel Der Wilde Garten that dealt with theme of lesbian love. The novel was later censored and burned by the Nazis in 1935.\nIn 1930, Vienna hosted the Weltliga für Sexualreform, a conference around progressive approaches to sexuality founded by queer activist and researcher Magnus Hirschfeld, with 2000 people participating.\nVienna during National Socialism\nLaws against gay and lesbians were strengthened after the Austria annexion to Germany in 1938, which had a devastating effect on the LGBT culture of the city. Both men and women were prosecuted. Men could be sent into concentration camps and forced labor. Women, while less targeted, could also be sent to camps for \"asocial\" behavior. As homosexuality was still illegal after the war, it was difficult for queer people to be recognized as victims. The book The Men with the Pink Triangles about Viennese concentration camp survivor Josef Kohout's is one of the most important documents of gay persecution during National Socialism.\n1960s-1980s : New movements\nAfter the decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1971, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the queer movement started being more and more active in Vienna. In January 1980, HOSI Wien was founded as the first queer organisation in Austria, first only run by gay men, from 1981 on together with lesbian women. Activists around HOSI Wien organised the first gay pride of Vienna taking place in 1982 and a protest for the lack of recognition of gay and lesbian victims of National Socialism that took place in 1988.\nThe squatting scene became an important part of the queer movement of the city in the early 1980s. This part of the movement criticized HOSI Wien for being too inefficient in their approach. In 1982, queer activists occupied an empty building in the 5th district and turned it into the LGBT center Rosa Lila Villa. Activists from Rosa Lila Villa staged a nude protest during the New Year's concert at Wiener Musikverein in 1982, demanding gay liberation.\nThe AIDS crisis\nThe first wave of the AIDS epidemic in Vienna started in 1983 and at this time there were already a lot of victims. Reinhard Brandstater, the vicepresident of the hospital, reached out to three experts: Cristian Kunz, director of virology of the University of Vienna, Klaus Wolff, director of the first university dermatological clinical, and Alois Stacher, the city counsellor for public health. When they decided to publish an informative brochure on AIDS, the city council covered all the costs and helped for its distribution. This city was the first one in Europe to do so.\nGeography\nThe Naschmarkt area in Vienna, that connects the 4th and the 6th district of the city, is a gay village. In this area one can find mainly gay bars, clubs and gay saunas.\nDemographics\nAccording to some estimates, around 5-10% of Vienna's population identify as LGBT+ (90.000 to 180.000 people).\nPolitics\nQueerphobia in Vienna\nQueerphobia in Vienna was quite prominent years ago due to laws related to the criminalisation of homosexuality. Nowadays, Vienna can be considered as a relatively safe city for queer people. However, there are still some prominent homophobic and queerphobic attacks. The Austrian Green MEP Ulrike Lunacek was a victim of an acid attack during a Pride parade in Vienna. And in 2015, a Lesbian couple was thrown out of traditional coffeehouse Café Prückel for kissing in public, which led to a protest with over 1000 attendees.\nCity politics\nVienna has traditionally been more progressive than the rest of Austria. Some first anti-discrimination laws were passed in 1996 and 1997, and activism already had garnered the support of then-mayor Gertrude Fröhlich-Sandner as early as 1982, when homosexuality was still not supported politically widely in the country. In 1998, the city established the Viennese Anti-Discrimination Unit for Gay, Lesbian and transgender issues (Wiener Antidiskriminierungsstelle), which works with a five-year action plan. The purpose was to bring up LGBT topics into all the different levels of administration, but also to mainstream LGBT issues among the Viennese public.\nThe city has introduced rainbow crossings, rainbow benches, the flagging of public buildings and pedestrian crossing symbols.  The city transport including trams and subways can be seen displaying rainbow flags and supportive messages such as \"We ride with Pride\" during the Pride Month. In 2015, the city of Vienna introduced traffic lights with same-sex couples before hosting the Eurovision Song Contest that year, which attracted media attention internationally. The official website of Vienna city has a guide for LGBT+ visitors with detailed information about the city's queer and queer-friendly spaces.\nIn 2016, the city of Vienna started handing out honorary awards to LGBT activists: Helmut Graupner received the Ehrenzeichen für Verdienste um das Land Wien award in 2016.\nThe city has a memorial for gay concentration camp survivors, most notably Josef Kohout, situated in Heinz-Heger-Park. There is also a monument to the victims of persecution of homosexuals in the Nazi era in Resselpark.\nIn December 2014, Vienna joined the Rainbow Cities Network by declaring itself a Human Rights City. Vienna became a fast-track city in the fight against HIV/AIDS in June 2017.\nInstitutions and Media\nLGBT associations\nin August 2021]]\nHOSI Wien\nHOSI Wien (Homosexual Initiative Vienna) is the oldest Austrian Lesbian and Gay organization, founded in 1979.

They have created a self-help group for \"trans and trans\" parents who want to have children, have organized different counselling and support workshops.\nHealth institutions\nEven if in Vienna everyone has the same legal right to access healthcare, LGBT people might still face discrimination. In order to fight against that, some associations have been created to give access to healthcare for LGBT people.\n* AIDS-Hilfe, a non-profit association that seeks to reduce the number oh HIV infections and to help infected people to live with the diseases.\n* Diversity Care Wien, a support organization for people with HIV that provide home-car for older and disabled people.

In 2015, a special HIV edition was published aimed at raising awareness about the virus. In order to help break the stigma surrounding HIV, the ink used to print the magazine was mixed with blood pigments of three HIV positive blood donors. The aim was to convey that it is as safe to make physical contact with an HIV+ person as it is to touch that magazine edition. The edition managed to reach more than 40 million people through media coverage and the idea won international awards.\nRecreation and culture\nFilm festivals\nVienna is home to a number of queer film festivals. The most important between 1994 and 2017 was Identities Queer Film Festival, which took place bi-annually. It was founded by Barbara Reumüller under the association DV8-Film and was part of Viennale, Vienna's biggest film festival, from 1996 to 2001. Filmcasino, a cinema in the 5th district, was one of its primary venues. Identities came to an end in 2017 due to lack of funding.\nAfter Identities was discontinued, Gabi Frimberger, then head of the FrauenFilmTag Wien, Dagmar Fink, and Katja Wiederspahn in 2019 decided to create Queertactics - Queer_Feminist Film Festival.
