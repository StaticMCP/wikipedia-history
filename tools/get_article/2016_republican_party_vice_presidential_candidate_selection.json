Pence formally won the vice presidential nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention on July 19. The Trump–Pence ticket would go on to defeat the Clinton–Kaine ticket in the 2016 presidential election but ultimately lost to the Biden–Harris ticket in 2020.\nVetting process and selection\nPresumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump turned his attention towards selecting a running mate after he became the presumptive nominee on May 4, 2016. Trump's rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Governor John Kasich of Ohio, had begun their vice-presidential vetting processes by April 2016, but both dropped out from the race after the Indiana primary. Cruz had selected businesswoman Carly Fiorina. The vetting process begins with a thorough examination of public records, such as speeches and campaign finance reports. This is followed by a \"full vet,\" in which potential vice presidential nominees are asked to submit detailed tax returns and medical records, and answer extensive questionnaires. Attorney Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. led the vetting process for the Trump campaign. Then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort presented Trump with a list of sixteen names in mid-May, and, starting in June, the Trump campaign began vetting six individuals.\nFinal selection\nOn May 10, 2016, Trump told the Associated Press that he had narrowed his list of potential running mates to \"five or six people\" with a background in politics, as opposed to the military or business. However, on July 6, Trump stated that \"about\" ten people remained in the running as potential running mate selections. In mid-June, Eli Stokols and Burgess Everett of Politico reported that Trump's shortlist included Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, former Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, and Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma. A June 30 report in The Washington Post also included Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Joni Ernst of Iowa, as well as Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, as individuals still being considered for the ticket. The Trump campaign also strongly considered Governor John Kasich of Ohio, considering him the \"perfect choice,\" but Kasich refused to be considered for the ticket (or endorse the Trump campaign). In early July, Corker and Ernst both declined to be considered as Trump's running mate. Meanwhile, Trump stated that he was considering two military generals for the position, including retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. On July 12, NBC News reported that Trump was planning to formally introduce his eventual pick on July 15, though \"it's not clear whether or not the identity of the pick could be released or could leak earlier in the week.\" The same article reported that he had narrowed his list down to Christie, Gingrich, and Pence.\nShortlist\nChris Christie at Southern Republican Leadership Conference (SRLC), Oklahoma City, OK May 2015 by Michael Vadon 127 (3x4 crop).jpg|\nFile:Newt Gingrich (16055210273) (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Mike Pence February 2015.jpg|\nMedia speculation on possible selections\nMembers of Congress\nFile:Kelly Ayotte, Official Portrait, 112th Congress 1.jpg|\nFile:Marsha Blackburn (16480914188) (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Senator Scott Brown at NH FITN 2016 by Michael Vadon 12 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Richard Burr official portrait (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Bob Corker official Senate photo (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Ted Cruz February 2015.jpg|\nFile:Joni Ernst Official photo portrait 114th Congress (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Rob Portman official portrait (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Shelley Moore Capito official Senate photo (cropped 2).jpg|\nFile:Cathy McMorris Rodgers official photo (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Marco Rubio by Gage Skidmore 8 (cropped).jpg| a 2016 presidential candidate}}\nFile:Tim Scott, official portrait, 113th Congress (cropped 2).jpg|}}\nFile:Jeff Sessions, official portrait (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:John Thune 117th Congress portrait (cropped).jpg|\nGovernors\nFile:Charlie Baker official portrait (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Jan Brewer by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|}}\nFile:Governor Phil Bryant (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Nathan Deal, April 25, 2017 (cropped2).jpg|\nFile:Governor Mary Fallin May 2015 (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Nikki Haley IMG 7865 (26850251111) (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Governor Bill Haslam crop.jpg|\nFile:Jon Huntsman Jr. 2016.jpg|Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah (2005–2009), a 2012 presidential candidate\nFile:Asa Hutchinson 2019.jpg|\nFile:Bobby Jindal August 2015.jpg|Bobby Jindal of Louisiana (2008–2016), a 2016 presidential candidate\nFile:John Kasich (24618295175) (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Governor NewMexico (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Sarah Palin (16672078851) (cropped2).jpg|\nFile:Gov.

Trump had planned to officially announce his choice on July 15 at 11&nbsp;am. ET, in Manhattan, but, following a terrorist attack in Promenade des Anglais, Nice, France, announced the day prior that he would postpone the announcement. On the morning of July 15, Trump announced via Twitter his choice of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate. Trump made the formal announcement at a news conference at 11 a.m. on July 16. Pence had been running for re-election as Governor of Indiana, but Indiana law prevented him from appearing on the election ballot twice, so Pence suspended his gubernatorial campaign. Within the Trump campaign, Pence emerged as a potential running mate in May due to the backing of senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Paul Manafort. CNN reported that multiple sources told them that Trump had second thoughts on the Pence pick and attempted to pick Christie instead, though the Trump campaign denied those reports. Following the selection, The New York Times noted that Pence is a \"sturdy and predictable politician\" who has a strong appeal to the Christian right. On July 19, the second night of the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence won the vice presidential nomination by acclamation.\nSee also\n*Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign\n*2016 Republican Party presidential candidates\n*2016 Republican Party presidential primaries\n*2016 Republican National Convention\n*2016 United States presidential election\n*List of United States major party presidential tickets\nReferences"
