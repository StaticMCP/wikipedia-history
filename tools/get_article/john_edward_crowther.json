      "text": "# John Edward Crowther\n\nJohn Edward Crowther (1863–1931) was a businessman and philanthropist who ran a large operation based at Bank Bottom Mill and made a number of charitable donations to the village and people of Marsden, West Riding of Yorkshire.\nEarly life\nCrowther was born in 1863 in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the son of John Crowther, a clothier (c1820-1865) and his wife Martha. He had, four brothers, Joseph, William, Elon Crowther, all of whom would go into the mill business.\nCareer\nCrowther owned and ran the family company John Edward Crowther Ltd based at Bank Bottom Mill, which in the early part of the 20th century was one of the largest cloth producing mills owned by a single individual in the world.\nHe was responsible for a number of charitable donations to the town of Marsden, such as the purchase and donation of an ambulance in 1912. After the Great War, in 1930, Crowther donated land for the clubhouse of the local chapter of the British Legion. He also helped to maintain a curate at the parish church and helped pay for the peal of bells in the church tower.\nDeath and legacy\nOn 7 April 1930 his wife died. In 1931 the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression caused the mill to work short time, and on 4 July 1931 Crowther took his own life. When he was cremated on 8 July, the mills in Marsden closed, shops shut and drew their blinds, and flags flew at half mast on the mills and other buildings in the town.\nThe company that bears his name, John Edward Crowther Ltd, remains in business today, manufacturing textiles and also dealing in real estate.\nNotes\nFurther reading\n* Armstrong, Thomas; The Crowthers of Bankdam, HarperCollins (1991).\n* Marsden History Group, Marsden – Then and Now: A Photographic Journey,\n* Pearson, Irene E., Marsden Through the Ages, (1984),\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140825014020/http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/misc/miscellany.html www.marsdenhistory.co.uk] Retrieved 4 January 2014\n*[http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/people/crowther-family Crowthers at Marsden History] Retrieved 30 December 2018\n* [http://www.examiner.co.uk/lifestyle/picture-week-john-crowther-mill-4952959 \"Picture of the Week: John Crowther mill memories in the shadow of the moors\"], Huddersfield Daily Examiner, 24 May 2012.
