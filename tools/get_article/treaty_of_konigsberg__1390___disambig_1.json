The 31-member or 30-member delegation from seven Samogitian regions (Ariogala, Kaltinėnai, Knituva, Kražiai, Medingėnai, Raseiniai, and Viduklė) arrived to Königsberg around the pentecost. They promised their loyalty to \"their king\" Vytautas and guaranteed trade freedom for the Knights in Samogitia. The Knights gifted the nobles with food and clothes.\nVytautas the Great waged a civil against his cousin Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. In order to secure Teutonic support in the civil war, Vytautas signed the Treaty of Lyck and granted Samogitia up to the Nevėžis River to the Knights on January 19, 1390. Samogitia was important for the Knights as this territory physically separated them from uniting with the Livonian Order in the north. Support of Samogitians was crucial to Vytautas as it was the only guarantee that the Treaty of Lyck would be carried out. However, Vytautas betrayed the Knights when in 1392 he reconciled with his cousin Jogaila and signed the Ostrów Agreement. Samogitia was not ceded to the Knights until the Treaty of Salynas in 1398. The treaty and the 30 names of Samogitian nobles are important for the study of personal names in pagan Lithuania.\nList of Samogitian nobles\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! # || Reconstructed name || Recorded name || Where from || Notes\n|-\n| 1|| Asteika || Hosteike || Raseiniai ||\n|-\n| 2|| Bimantas, Bymantas || Bimunt || Viduklė ||\n|-\n| 3|| Daukša || Dawchs || Kaltinėnai ||\n|-\n| 4|| Dirkštelis || Dirkstel || Medininkai ||\n|-\n| 5|| Dramutis || Dramutte || Ariogala || In 1401, with his son witnessed the Union of Vilnius and Radom\n|-\n| 6|| Eikutis || Eycutte || Kražiai || In 1419, he was a court official in Medininkai\n|-\n| 7|| Eimantas || Eymund || Kaltinėnai ||\n|-\n| 8|| Einorius, Einoras || Eynur || Kražiai ||\n|-\n| 9|| Eivildas, Eiviltas || Eywild Eynuren bruder || Kražiai || In 1413, received Ciołek coat of arms according to the Union of Horodło\n|-\n| 10|| Erimas || Erim || Ariogala ||\n|-\n| 11|| Gelvonas || Gelwan || Viduklė ||\n|-\n| 12|| Getas, Gedas || Getez || Kražiai ||\n|-\n| 13|| Gineitis || Gineth || Ariogala ||  In 1413, received Zaremba coat of arms according to the Union of Horodło; in 1433, served as elder of Kaunas\n|-\n| 14|| Jodeika, Joteikis || Jotheke || Ariogala ||\n|-\n| 15|| Klausigaila || Clawssegail || Raseiniai || Active during the Samogitian uprising of 1409; testified to Benedict Makrai regarding the Samogitian border in 1413\n|-\n| 16|| Mazbutas || Maisebuth || Medininkai ||\n|-\n| 17|| Pamplys || Pampli || Knituva ||\n|-\n| 18|| Ragelis || Ragel || Kaltinėnai ||\n|-\n| 19|| Ramontas, Ramavydas || Ramomt, Ramouit || Kražiai ||\n|-\n| 20|| Rėkutis || Roeukutte || Medininkai ||\n|-\n| 21|| Skutas || Skutez || Kaltinėnai ||\n|-\n| 22|| Skvaibutis || Sqwaybuth || Kaltinėnai ||\n|-\n| 23|| Sungaila, Surgaila || Sungail || Viduklė || Might be identical to Sungalo who testified in the Council of Constance in 1416 and was later killed by the Knights\n|-\n| 24|| Surtenis, Surtinis || Surthen || Viduklė ||\n|-\n| 25|| Tyla, Tylenis || Tilen || Kaltinėnai ||\n|-\n| 26|| Vidas, Vydas || Wide || Kražiai ||\n|-\n| 27|| Vilaudis, Vyliaudas || Wilawde || Ariogala ||\n|-\n| 28|| Zundys || Sunde || Ariogala ||\n|-\n| 29|| Žaudys || Zawden || Raseiniai ||\n|-\n| 30|| Žilpa || Zilpe || Knituva ||\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
