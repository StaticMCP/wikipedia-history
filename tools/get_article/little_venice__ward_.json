      "text": "# Little Venice (ward)\n\nLittle Venice is an electoral ward of the City of Westminster. The population at the 2021 Census was 10,366. The ward covers the area south of Maida Vale and north of Paddington, bound by the Westway, Edgware Road and Grand Union Canal. The Regent's Canal runs through the ward to Little Venice basin, and it is served by Warwick Avenue station on the Bakerloo line, in addition to several bus routes running through the area. There are three primary schools, St Joseph's RC Primary School, St Saviour's C of E Primary School, and Ark Paddington Green Primary Academy, and one GP surgery in the ward.\nThe locality known as Little Venice was largely represented by the original Maida Vale ward, created in 1964, which elected five councillors. For the May 1978 election, the ward was split into two: Maida Vale and Little Venice, each electing three councillors. There were minor boundary changes in 2002 and 2022.\nThe ward currently returns three councillors to Westminster City Council, with an election every four years. At the last election in May 2022, two candidates from the Conservative Party and one from the Labour Party were elected to represent the ward. Since 2024, the ward has formed part of the Queen's Park and Maida Vale parliamentary constituency, having previously been in the abolished Westminster North seat. The Member of Parliament representing the ward is Georgia Gould (Labour).\nCouncillors\nThree councillors represent Little Venice ward. Notable councillors include Melvyn Caplan, leader of Westminster City Council (1995 to 2000) and deputy leader (until 2021), Jonathan Lord, MP for Woking and deputy leader of Westminster Council (1998 to 2000), Nick St Aubyn, former MP for Guildford (1997 to 2001), and Anne Weyman, vice-chair of Britain for Europe.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Election\n! colspan=\"2\" |Councillor\n! colspan=\"2\" |Councillor\n! colspan=\"2\" |Councillor\n|-\n|2022\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Lorraine Dean (Con)\n|rowspan=9; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=9|Melvyn Caplan (Con)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Sara Hassan (Lab)\n|-\n|2018\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Matthew Charles Green (Con)\n|-\n|2014\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Ian Adams (Con)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n||Barbara Jolanda Arzymanow (Con)\n|-\n|2010\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Margaret Doyle (Con)\n|-\n|2006\n|-\n|2002\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Barbara Schmeling (Con)\n|-\n|1998\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Jonathan Lord (Con)\n|-\n|1994\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Julia Hunt (Con)\n|-\n|1990\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Anthony Alford (Con)\n|-\n|1986\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Isla Robertson (Lab)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Helen Goldfarb (Lab)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|David Obaze (Lab)\n|-\n|1982\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Robin Walker (Con)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Nick St Aubyn (Con)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Ian Walker (Con)\n|-\n|1978\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Stephen Molyneux (Lab)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Anne Weyman (Lab)\n| style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Christopher Bulford (Lab)\n|-\n|}\nElection results\nLike the other wards of Westminster, Little Venice is represented by three councillors on Westminster City Council.
