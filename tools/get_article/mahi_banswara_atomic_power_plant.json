On 9 May 2025, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board gave permission for the project.\nPrime minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the plant on September the 25th, 2025 during his visit to Rajasthan. The first unit will commence construction soon thereafter and is expected to be operational in six and a half years according to sources.\nHistory\nNestled in the tribal areas of Rajasthan, the Mahi Banswara project aims to kick start the region by providing jobs and investment opportunity and alleviating the power shortage in the state. The plant construction was scheduled for 2024 and will be jointly developed by NTPC and NPCIL. Along with Chutka Nuclear Power Plant, NTPC aims to generate 3500 MW of electricity from nuclear sources.\nOn 9 May 2025 the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board of India published siting consent for the proposed plant.\nOn 25th September 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone at the site, during his visit to Banswara district of Rajasthan. All the clearances have been granted, and the construction is expected to begin in late 2025.\nDesign and specification\nThe proposed 700 MW IPHWR-700 reactors are indigenous and similar to the ones in operation at Kakrapar Atomic Power Station (KAPP-3 &4) and Rajasthan unit 8 and the unit currently under construction in Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPP-8).\nCost and economics\nThe plant is jointly built by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited, the project is estimated to cost . The project is a part of the fleet mode reactor program of the Government of India under which 10 indigenous  IPHWR-700 reactors are being built and the goal of 100 GWe nuclear capacity till 2047. The construction is to be started in 2025 and planned to be competed within 4-5 year.\nUnits\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Phase\n! rowspan=\"2\" |UnitNo.\n! colspan=\"2\" |Reactor\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Status\n! colspan=\"2\" |Capacity in MWe\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Construction start\n! rowspan=\"2\" |First criticality\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Grid Connection\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Commercial operation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Closure\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Notes\n|-\n!
