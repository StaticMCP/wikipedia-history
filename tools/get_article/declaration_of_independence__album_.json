It was released on August 7, 2012 through Average Joe's Entertainment Group. The album includes the singles \"Answer to No One,\" \"Back\" and \"Drivin' Around Song.\"\nReviews\nAn uncredited review from the Associated Press was favorable, saying that \"Ford not only illustrates that country music can continue to draw on other contemporary musical styles, he also shows that modern-era rednecks can mix with the rest of the world, too.\" Bobby Peacock of Roughstock rated it four stars out of five, similarly saying that it \"finds him once again bridging the gap between two diametrically opposite genres with skill.\" Giving it three-and-a-half stars out of five, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic compared the sound to Kid Rock, saying that Ford had \"swagger\" and \"bravado\". Sam Gazdziak of Country Standard Time gave a mixed review, praising \"All In\" and \"Way Too Early\" as the countriest-sounding, and calling \"Angels & Demuns\" a standout, but criticizing some of the songs' themes by saying that \"The 'country pride' songs dominate, and there are so many of them saying essentially the same thing that they become indistinguishable.\" As of Oct. 28,2012 the album has sold 106,000 copies.\nTrack listing\n| length1=3:32\n| title2          = Drivin' Around Song\n| note2           = with Jason Aldean\n| writer2 =\n| length2=3:40\n| title3          = All In\n| note3           = with Kix Brooks\n| writer3 =\n| length3=3:16\n| title4          = Ain't Out of the Woods\n| note4           = with Montgomery Gentry\n| writer4 = Ford\n| length4=3:04\n| title5          = Lucky\n| note5           = with Jonathan Singleton\n| writer5 =\n| length5=3:09\n| title6          = Back\n| note6           = with Jake Owen\n| writer6 =\n| length6=4:02\n| title7          = Dancin' While Intoxicated (DWI)\n| note7           = with LoCash Cowboys and Redneck Social Club\n| writer7 =\n| length7=3:55\n| title8          = It's All\n| note8           = with Jeffrey Steele\n| length8=3:43\n| writer8 =\n| title9          = Hugh Damn Right\n| note9           = with Laura Bell Bundy\n| writer9 =\n| length9=3:43\n| title10         = Room at the Bar\n| note10          = with Corey Smith\n| writer10 =\n| length10=3:19\n| title11         = All of My Tomorrows\n| note11          = with Russell Dickerson\n| writer11 =\n| length11=3:09\n| title12         = Happy in Hell\n| note12          = with Wanya Morris\n| writer12 = Ford\n| length12=3:58\n| title13         = 50/50\n| writer13 =\n| length13=2:50\n| title14         = Way Too Early\n| note14          = with Darius Rucker\n| writer14 =\n| length14=2:46\n| title15         = Angels & Demuns\n| note15          = with Lamar Williams, Jr.\n| writer15 =\n| length15=6:38\n}}\nProduction\nProducer: Dann Huff: Tracks 2, 5, 8 and 11\nProducer: Mike Hartnett and Corey Smith: Track 10\nProducer: Phive Starr: Tracks 7 and 12\nProducer: Shannon Houchins: Tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 14 and 15\nMixing: Billy Decker: Tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15\nMixing: Justin Niebank: Tracks 2, 5, 8 and 11\nMixing: Phive Starr: Track 7\nMixing: Billy Hume: Track 10\nMastering - Noah Gordon\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2012)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2012)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard)\n| 45\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Independent Albums (Billboard)\n| 24\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard)\n| 53\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Single\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| US Country\n! width=\"45\"| US Country Airplay\n! width=\"45\"| US\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2012\n| align=\"left\"| \"Answer to No One\" (with JJ Lawhorn)\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| \"Back\" (with Jake Owen)\n| 40\n| 50\n| —\n|-\n| 2013\n| align=\"left\"| \"Drivin' Around Song\" (with Jason Aldean)\n| 41\n| 56\n| 106\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
