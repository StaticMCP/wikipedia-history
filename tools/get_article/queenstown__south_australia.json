An Alberton West office was renamed Queenstown East in 1948, then Queenstown in 1966 before closing in 1976.\nThe District Council of Queenstown and Alberton was established in 1864, bringing dedicated local government to the residents of the two townships either side of the new Port Road. In 1898 this council was absorbed by the Corporate Town of Port Adelaide.\nThe former Whittaker Memorial Primitive Methodist Church, later the Queenstown Church of Christ, at 193-195 Port Road, is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.\nReferences\nfr:Queenstown (Cap-Oriental)"
