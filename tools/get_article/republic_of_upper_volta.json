Before becoming autonomous, it had been part of the French Union as the French Upper Volta. On 5 August 1960, it gained full independence from France. On 4 August 1984, it changed its name to Burkina Faso.\nEtymology\nin Upper Volta]]\nThe name Upper Volta indicated that the country contains the upper part of the Volta River.\nHistory\nUpper Volta obtained independence on 5 August 1960, with Maurice Yaméogo of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) becoming the country's first president. A constitution was ratified the same year, establishing presidential elections by direct universal suffrage and a National Assembly, both with five-year terms. Shortly after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV-RDA. He had shown a deep authoritarian streak even before becoming president. Between the time he became prime minister of Upper Volta while it was still a French colony and independence two years later, opposition parties were subjected to increased harassment.\nOn 3 January 1966, Yaméogo was overthrown in a coup d'état led by army chief Sangoulé Lamizana. Although multiparty democracy was nominally restored four years later, Lamizana dominated the country's politics until he was himself overthrown in 1980.\nAfter a series of short-term presidencies, Thomas Sankara then came to power through yet another military coup d'état on 4 August 1983. After the coup, he formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Under the direction of Sankara, the country changed its name on 4 August 1984, from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which means \"Land of Incorruptible People\".\nPolitics\nFrom 1958 to 1960, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a high commissioner:\n*Max Berthet (11 December 1958 to February 1959),\n*Paul Masson (February 1959 to 5 August 1960).\nFrom 1971 to 1987, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a prime minister:\n*Gérard Kango Ouédraogo (13 February 1971 to 8 February 1974)\n*Thomas Sankara (4 August 1983 to 14 October 1987)\nSymbols\nFlag\nThe colours of the national flag corresponded to the names of the Volta's three main tributaries: the Black Volta, the White Volta and the Red Volta.\nNational Hymn\nIn French:\nFière Volta de mes aieux,\nTon soleil ardent et glorieux\n''Te revêt d'or et de fierté\nÔ Reine drapée de loyauté !\nNous te ferons et plus forte, et plus belle\nÀ ton amour nous resterons fidèles\nEt nos cœurs vibrant de fierté\nAcclameront ta beauté\nVers l'horizon lève les yeux\nFrémis aux accents tumultueux\nDe tes fiers enfants tous dressés\nPromesses d'avenir caressées\nLe travail de ton sol brûlant\nSans fin trempera les cœurs ardents,\nEt les vertus de tes enfants\nLe ceindront d'un diadème triomphant.\nQue Dieu te garde en sa bonté,\nQue du bonheur de ton sol aimé,\nL'Amour des frères soit la clé,\nHonneur, Unité et Liberté.''\nIn English:\nProud Volta of my ancestors,\nYour ardent and glorious sun\nTakes you with gold and pride\nO Queen draped with loyalty!\nWe will make you stronger and more beautiful\nTo your love we will remain faithful\nAnd our hearts vibrant with pride\nWill acclaim your beauty\nTowards the horizon look up\nFrisks with the tumultuous accents\nOf your proud children all trained\nCaressed promises of future\nThe work of your burning ground\nEndless will soak the ardent hearts,\nAnd the virtues of your children\nThe girdle of a triumphant diadem.\nMay God keep you in his goodness,\nMay the happiness of your beloved soil,\nThe love of the brethren be the key,\nHonor, Unity and Freedom.\nThis anthem was replaced in 1984 by a new anthem, the Ditanyè.\nCultural references\nDuring the 1960s, the Soviet Union was sometimes derisively referred to as \"Upper Volta with rockets\", coined by a journalist Xan Smiley, referencing USSR's disproportion of defence sector over relatively undeveloped civilian economy.\nSee also\n*History of Burkina Faso\n*List of governors of Upper Volta\n*List of heads of state of Burkina Faso\n*List of heads of government of Burkina Faso\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR6s6HECTPk Le president Maurice Yamego]-a documentary in French about the first President of Upper Volta, Maurice Yamégo"
