In the , Felton South had a population of 78 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the south-west by the Condamine River and to the north-west by Hodgson Creek.\nThe Toowoomba Karara Road enters the locality from the north-west (Felton) and exits the locality to the south (Ellangowan).\nThe land use is predominantly crop growing with some grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the pastoral run name, which was named by pastoralist Charles Mallard  in the early 1840s after his English birthplace.\nFelton South State School opened in 1929. On Wednesday 5 March 1947, the school was burned down in a fire. The teacher Miss P. Pulbrook and the 14 students of the school used a cottage provided by Mr P. J. Kelleher as temporary premises. Less than two weeks later, the cottage was also burned down, leading to the belief that the fires were deliberately started. While an official inquiry decided the fires were deliberately lit, no suspects were identified. The school closed circa 1952. It was on the western side of the Toowoomba Karara Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Felton South had a population of 65 people.\nIn the , Felton South had a population of 78 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Felton South.
