The dynasty began in the mid-nineteenth century with Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman of Bohush, the eldest grandson of Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhyn, and was based in that town until 1951, when his great-grandson, Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman of Bohush-Tel Aviv, moved the dynasty to Tel Aviv. In 1987 the Bohush beis medrash was transferred to Bnei Brak, where the dynasty is led today by Rabbi Yaakov Mendel Friedman, a great-great-grandson of the first Bohusher Rebbe.\nRabbi Yaakov Mendel leads his court at 12 Rechov Chaggai, a few doors away from the original Kloyz in Bnei Brak. He leads it with a fire and a passion. Since he took on the mantle of leadership, the Hasidus has expanded tremendously with three yeshivos, two kollels, and communities all over Israel, in The United States, Antwerp and London.\nBohush is one of the branches of the Ruzhiner dynasty, together with Boyan, Chortkov, Husiatyn, Sadigura, and Shtefanesht.\nLineage\n* Rebbe Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhin (born October 5, 1796, at Ruzhyn, died October 9, 1851, at Sadhora), the\n** Rebbe Shalom Yosef Friedman of Sadigura (born 1812 at Ruzhin, died September 8, 1851, at Leipzig), eldest son of Rebbe Yisrael\n*** Rebbe Yitzchok Friedman, first rebbe of Bohush (born December 7, 1834, at Buhuşi, died August 19, 1896, at Buhuşi), son of Rebbe Shalom Yosef.
