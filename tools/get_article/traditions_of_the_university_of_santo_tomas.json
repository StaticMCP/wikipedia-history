      "text": "# Traditions of the University of Santo Tomas\n\nThe University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines marks a variety of traditions largely influenced by the Spanish and Filipino Dominican culture. Many are annual events, such as religious assemblies marking the start and end of the academic year, a welcome walk for new students, as well as intercollege sport competitions and talent exhibitions. Christmas is celebrated in a month-long festivities culminated by the UST Paskuhan. Many Roman Catholic feast days are also celebrated.\nCatholic traditions\n's installation as the 96th Rector Magnificus at the 2012 Misa de Apertura]]\nMisa de Apertura\nAs a catholic university, UST opens each school year with the Mass of the Holy Spirit called as Misa de Apertura.  The mass is usually officiated by a bishop, concelebrated by the Prior Provincial of the Dominican Province of the Philippines, the Rector of the university, and priests of the Priory of St. Thomas Aquinas, and clergy studying or teaching in the university. The opening of the school year is formally declared by the Apostolic Nuncio or his delegate, in consonance with the status of UST as a pontifical university.\nIn 2012, apostolic nuncio to the Philippines, archbishop Giuseppe Pinto, led the mass and the opening rites of the school year.\nDiscurso de Apertura\nThe Discurso de Apertura or the inaugural lecture consists of a scientific discussion delivered by a professor or dean at the formal opening of the school year. The lecturer assigned in the preparation of the academic paper is appointed by the rector of the university a few months prior to the opening of each school year.\nThe Discurso traces its roots back to Lectio Prima, or first lecture. It was a conference practiced by the Dominican houses of studies to start the school year based on the UST statutes drafted by the Dominican priest Juan Amador in 1785. The first Discurso was held on July 16, 1866, as an annual event. It was temporarily discontinued in 1929 when Don Nicanor Cortez failed to write his dissertation. Twelve years after, the tradition was brought back with Fr. Angel de Blas, a psychologist, as the speaker. It was again discontinued in 1942 at the break out of World War II, and resumed later on in 1946.\nIn 2011, professor Regalado Trota-Jose, archivist of the university, presented documents from the archives regarding the life of the national hero José Rizal in UST.\nReplacing the lecture of Discurso de Apertura in 2012 and 2016 were the inaugural addresses of Herminio V. Dagohoy as the ninety-sixth rector (first and second terms) of the university. The Discurso was omitted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center\"\n|+ Discurso de Apertura in recent years\n|-\n!width='15%' | Year\n!!width='35%' | Lecturer\n!!width='45%' | Topic\n!!width='5%' | Ref.\n|-\n|  2000\n|  Amado Dimayuga,  Dean, UST Faculty of Civil Law\n|  Judicial Bar Council and the importance of refining  the process of appointing court judges\n|\n|-\n|  2001\n|  Luis Ferrer,  Dean, UST College of Architecture\n|  Focus on building \"humane communities\"\n|\n|-\n|  2002\n|  Jaime de los Santos,  Assistant Dean, UST College of Fine Arts and Design\n|  Creative instinct\n|\n|-\n|  2003\n|  Raul Sinico,  Dean, UST Conservatory of Music\n|  \"Music: Raising the Level of Listening Appreciation\"\n|\n|-\n|  2004\n|  Rolando Lopez, M.D.  Dean, UST Faculty of Medicine and Surgery\n|  Value of spirituality on students\n|\n|-\n|  2005\n|  Jeanette Loanzon,  Dean, UST College of Commerce\n|  Economic revolution\n|\n|-\n|  2006\n|  Glenda Vargas,  Dean, UST College of Nursing\n|  Exodus of Filipino nurses\n|\n|-\n|  2007\n|  Jose Ireneo,  Dean, UST AMV College of Accountancy\n|  Governance and internal controls in businesses\n|\n|-\n|  2008\n|  Rev.

In 2011, the yearlong Quadricentennial celebration formally opened on the same day as the feast. It has also been a tradition that the results of the UST Entrance Examination (USTET) for incoming freshmen are released on January 28.\n* Feast of St. Dominic de Guzman - August 8\n* Feast of St. Catherine of Alexandria - November 25\n* Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8&nbsp;– In the feast day of 2010, 24,000 students and university staff formed the Q Rosary, or a human rosary formation in the campus grounds. The event is part of the Quadricentennial festivities and an attempt to enter the Guinness World Records for forming the largest living rosary. However, the university decided to drop the bid due to lack of time to process.\nChristmas celebration\nThe university starts the Christmas festivities with opening of the campus lights and the UST Christmas Concert. The UST Christmas Concert features talents from the UST Conservatory of Music, UST Singers, Coro Tomasino, Liturgikon, Conservatory Chorus Class, and the UST Symphony Orchestra. Traditional Filipino and foreign Christmas classics are performed in the event. At the end of every concert, the UST Symphony Orchestra and performers lead the audience in singing some songs such as \"Ang Pasko ay Sumapit.\"\nThe Christmas Concert Gala began in 2003 when the UST secretary-general Fr. Isidro Abaño, O.P., envisioned a musical concert that would bring together world-class Thomasian talents who would perform for UST students, faculty, alumni, friends, and benefactors. Initially, the concert helped raise funds for the various projects of the university, such as scholarship grants of the students of the UST Conservatory of Music, but since 2008, it has also contributed in UST's heritage-conservation efforts. Maricris Zobel, socialite and an art patroness, has been the co-chair of the organizing committee since then. Proceeds of the Christmas Gala has been allotted for the victims of typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng in 2009, restoration of various paintings, and construction of the UST Museum of Arts and Sciences Hall of Visual Arts in 2011.\nVarious organizations like the Belo Medical Group, the San Miguel Corporation, the Enrique Zobel group of companies, and the Singapore Airlines have become presenters of the event. In 2010, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs hosted the opening of the concert and the Lumina Pandit, an exhibit for the quadricentennial festivities.\nAt the ninth Christmas Concert Gala on December 1, 2011, the newly installed Martyr's Carillon at the façade of the Santisimo Rosario Parish was rung by the Professor Raul Suñico, Dean of the UST Conservatory of Music.\nPaskuhan\nPrimered by the Eucharistic Celebration, the Paskuhan is the Thomasian way of celebrating Christmas. It is one of the most awaited events of the year showcasing different performances from different student organizations, and live bands, which is complemented with an extravagant show of pyrotechny.\nIn the 2011 celebration, the crowd was estimated at 100,000.\nBaccalaureate Mass\nThe Baccalaureate Mass for the graduating students is led by the Rector of the university. The mass is followed by the Ceremony of the Light and the Sending-off Rites. The Sending-off Rites is a processional march from the UST Grandstand to the back of the Arch of the Centuries.\nThe Mass takes place in the UST Grandstand traditionally. In 2016, however, the university decided to hold it in the Quadricentennial Pavilion because of the inclement weather. In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Baccalaureate Mass was livestreamed from the Santisimo Rosario Parish. In 2022, the in-person Baccalaureate Mass returned and was celebrated over a period of two days for batches 2022 (June 3, 2022), 2021 and 2020 (June 4, 2022) .\nSchool spirit\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#FAFAD2; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 30%\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\nUniversity of Santo Tomas Hymn (full version)\n|-\n|\n: Seat of Aquinas, majestic enduring\n: the storms of the ages.\n: Shrine of our ancient fathers,\n: Carved in these isles domain.\n: This is the castle imperious.\n: This is the home of our sages.\n: Blessed by the Cross of the angels,\n: Gift of our Mother Spain!\n: Deep in her echoing chambers\n: Flames of eternal yearning\n: Cast their benignant shadows\n: athwart this beloved land.\n: Keeping the torches of freedom\n: and heave forever burning.\n: Deep in the heart led by the Saviour's command.\n: God of all nations\n: Merciful Lord of our restless being,\n: Sweep with your golden lilies;\n: This fountain of purest light;\n: Trace with the sails of the galleons\n: the dream beyond our seeing\n: Touch with the flame of your kindness\n: the gloom of our darkest night.\n: Keep us in beauty and truth and virtues\n: impassioned embrace\n: Ever your valiant legions\n: Imbued with unending grace!\n|}\nAlma mater\nThe UST Hymn is the alma mater song of the University of Santo Tomas. The lyrics were written by Dr. Jose Ma. Hernandez to music composed by the UST Conservatory of Music's first director, Dean Julio Esteban Anguita, and orchestrated by Manuel P. Maramba, O.S.B. Today, only the chorus of the original hymn is being sung and being played.\nThomasian Welcome Walk\nThe Thomasian Welcome Walk (TWW) is an annual university event that uniquely welcomes new students to the university. Freshmen from all the colleges, including the high school, pass under historic Arch of the Centuries from the España Boulevard side and walk towards the UST Main Building. It symbolizes the linkage between incoming freshmen and their predecessors in the university. The first Walk took place on June 14, 2002, known before as \"The Rites of Passage\".\nROARientation\nUniversity events\nThere are various university-wide events, among others are:\n* Pautakan&nbsp;– A quiz bee among different colleges and faculties. Established in 1977\n* Thomasian Youth Ambassador and Ambassadress – The annual intercollegiate search highlights the values in the Thomasian identity of compassion, competence, and commitment organized by the UST Student Organizations Coordinating Council (UST SOCC).\n* Himig Tomasino - Annual competition of the different collegiate chorale groups of the university organized by the UST Student Organizations Coordinating Council (UST SOCC).\nThe USTv Awards\nThe USTv Awards or The USTv Students’ Choice Awards is an annual awarding ceremony. It honors television programs and personalities that promote Thomasian values and the teachings of the Catholic Church. Established in 2005, the USTv Awards is the first student award- giving body in the Philippines. In 2014, 35,000 students were expected to participate in voting.\nFireworks\nUST began having pyromusical shows in the opening of the Quadricentennial Celebration on January 27, 2011. It was also the first time the Philippines saw a multi-position pyromusical event when the fireworks were launched from the UST Grandstand and Santisimo Rosario Parish. In the Neo-Centennial Celebration in January 2012, the university was also the first to set up a pyromusical in four different structures and buildings. The music and choreography of all the pyromusical events are arranged by Don Miguel Villarosa and the technicals and set-up are done by John Oliver Zeng, alumni of the UST College of Fine Arts and Design. The fireworks of all the pyromusical events are provided by Dragon Fireworks, a local fireworks manufacturer.\nThe pyromusical display has become one of the most anticipated events during the Paskuhan festivities attracting alumni, visitors, and local media coverage.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"40%\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center\"\n|+ List of events with pyromusical display\n|-\n!width='25%' | Date\n!!width='70%' | Event\n!!width='5%' | Ref.\n|-\n|  January 27, 2011\n|  Quattromondial Monument unveiling  Q Grand Program\n|\n|-\n|  January 28, 2011\n|  One@400: Q Grand Alumni Homecoming Dinner\n|\n|-\n|  March 25, 2011\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2011\n|\n|-\n|  December 16, 2011\n|  Paskuhan 2011\n|\n|-\n|  January 27, 2012\n|  Neo-Centennial Celebration\n|\n|-\n|  March 23, 2012\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2012\n|\n|-\n|  December 21, 2012\n|  Paskuhan 2012\n|\n|-\n|  March 19, 2013\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2013\n|\n|-\n|  March 21, 2014\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2014\n|\n|-\n|  December 11, 2014\n|  Paskuhan 2014\n|\n|-\n|  May 15, 2015\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2015\n|\n|-\n|  December 18, 2015\n|  Paskuhan 2015\n|\n|-\n|  May 20, 2016\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2016\n|\n|-\n|  September 4, 2016\n| UAAP Season 79 Opening Ceremonies\n|\n|-\n|  December 16, 2016\n|  Paskuhan 2016\n|\n|-\n|  May 19, 2017\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2017\n|\n|-\n|  May 20, 2017\n| UAAP Season 79 Closing Ceremonies\n|\n|-\n|  December 20, 2017\n|  Paskuhan 2017\n|\n|-\n|  May 24, 2018\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2018\n|\n|-\n|  December 21, 2018\n|  Paskuhan 2018\n|\n|-\n|  May 25, 2019\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2019\n|\n|-\n|  December 19, 2022\n|  Paskuhan 2022\n|\n|-\n|  May 30, 2023\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2023\n|\n|-\n|  December 21, 2023\n|  Paskuhan 2023\n|\n|-\n|  May 31, 2024\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2024\n|\n|-\n|  December 20, 2024\n|  Paskuhan 2024\n|\n|-\n|  May 31, 2025\n|  Baccalaureate Mass 2025\n|\n|-\n|  September 19, 2025\n|  UAAP Season 88 Opening Ceremonies\n|\n|-\n|  December 19, 2025\n|  Paskuhan 2025\n|\n|-\n|}\nClass valedictorians in recent years\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"40%\" style=\"font-size: 95% style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width='20%'  | Year\n! width='50%' | Valedictorian's College and Program\n! width='20%' | General Weighted Average\n! width='10%' | Ref.\n|-\n|  2006\n|  Arts and Letters  Communication Arts\n|  1.17\n|\n|-\n|  2007\n|  Engineering  Electrical Engineering\n|  1.15\n|\n|-\n|  2008\n|  Science  Biology\n|  1.092\n|\n|-\n|  2009\n|  Pharmacy  Medical Technology\n|  1.16\n|\n|-\n|  2010\n|  Pharmacy\n|  1.12\n|\n|-\n|  2011\n|  Tourism and Hospitality Management  Hotel and Restaurant Management\n|  1.12\n|\n|-\n|  2013\n|  Pharmacy  Pharmacy\n|  1.069\n|\n|-\n|  2014\n|  Tourism and Hospitality Management  Travel Management\n|  1.089\n|\n|-\n|  2015\n|  Sacred Theology\n|\n|\n|-\n|  2016\n|  Pharmacy  Clinical Pharmacy\n|  1.121\n|\n|-\n|  2017\n|  Pharmacy  Medical Technology\n|  1.059\n|\n|-\n|  2018\n|  Tourism and Hospitality Management  Travel Management\n|  1.111\n|\n|-\n|  2019\n|  Philosophy  Philosophy and  AB Classical Major in Philosophy\n|  1.126\n|\n|-\n|  2020\n|  Sacred Theology  Sacred Theology\n|  1.167\n|\n|-\n|}\nSports\nUST's official mascot is the Growling Tiger.

The UST Grandstand stage and the Martyrs' Monument have floor designs that feature a sun.\nArch of the Centuries\nIt has been a superstition that crossing the Arch of the Centuries while still studying in the university would result in a delay of graduation. Another legend says that crossing the arch at midnight will make someone time travel to the Spanish era.\nHeight of the Main Building\nThere is an unwritten rule among Thomasian architects that no structure will be higher than the cross of the Main Building. However, many new buildings built since 2000 such as the Beato Angelico Building, Quadricentennial Pavilion, Buenaventura G. Paredes, O.P Building, and the new UST Hospital Building have shadowed the edifice.\nMiguel de Benavides statue\nUniversity in other languages\n*The university on its third centennial: El Tricentenario\n*Previous names of the faculties and colleges: Facultad de Teología, Facultad de Cánones, Facultad de Derecho Civil, Facultades de Medicina y Farmacia, Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Facultad de Ingeniería, and Colegio de Bellas Artes\n*Latin name: Pontificia et Regalis Sancti Thomæ Aquinatis Universitas Manilana (Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, Manila)\n*Motto: Veritas in Caritate (Truth in Charity)\n*Main Building: Tria Haec (\"This Three\") statues at the Main Building (Faith, Hope and Charity; Three Virtues of St. Paul)\n*In the Miguel de Benavides Library cornice: \"Has tenebrae cingunt mentis caligine terras Hoc Sancti Thomae Universitates Opus: Lumina Pandit\" (\"Darkness covers this land in a mental mist.

It is attended by representatives from the Commission on Higher Education, Church hierarchy, academic institutions, members of the diplomatic corps, alumni, and the students. One of the highlights of ceremony is the bestowal of the Rector's Collar and two ceremonial maces.\nIn 2012 and 2016, the installation of Rev. Herminio Dagohoy, O.P., for his inaugural and second term respectively, replaced the Discurso de Apertura. In 2021, Rev. Fr. Richard G. Ang, OP was installed as the 97th Rector of the University of Santo Tomas, and will be re-installed for a second four-year term in September 2024.\nUST at 500\nThe UST Neo-Centennial Celebration in January 2012 is a week-long festivity that marked the countdown to 500 years. At the end of the pyromusical display on January 27, 2012, \"UST 500\" was spelled out using indoor fireworks atop the Main Building.\nThe Varsitarian Neo-centennial magazine supplement released in June 2012 was entitled \"Toward 500\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_events&Itemid=106 The University of Santo Tomas - Events]\nde:University of Santo Tomas\ntl:University of Santo Tomas"
