The album features ex-Black N' Blue vocalist Jaime St. James who replaced Jani Lane in 2004. Lane left the band due to personal and business disagreements and thus, Born Again is the first Warrant album not to feature him on lead vocals.\nProduction and marketing\nThe album was produced by producer and engineer Pat Regan (Kiss, Deep Purple, Mr. Big, L.A. Guns) and also features the return of original members, lead guitarist Joey Allen and drummer Steven Sweet.\nThe track \"Bourbon County Line\" was released as the album's lead single, followed by the second single \"Dirty Jack\".\nReception\nThe album received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the band's return to a traditional hard rock sound.  Hard Rock Hideout said that the album was Warrant's best since Dog Eat Dog, and that \"the whole vibe of this [album] sounds like Warrant in their heyday\".  Allmusic said that while Born Again did not \"stretch the boundaries,\" it was nevertheless a \"superb set of hard rock songs that sound and feel better than most music from the '80s\" and praised the band's willingness to keep \"consistency and faith in the original concept\" of their music.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Warrant\n*Jaime St. James - Lead vocals\n*Joey Allen - Lead guitar, Backing vocals\n*Erik Turner - Rhythm guitar, Backing vocals\n*Jerry Dixon - Bass, Backing vocals\n*Steven Sweet - Drums, Backing vocals\n;Additional personnel\n*Pat Regan - Keyboards\nBorn Again: Delvis Video Diaries\nMusic videos were shot for all the songs on the Warrant album Born Again.
