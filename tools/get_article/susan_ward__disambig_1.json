She made her film debut in the 1997 sequel, Poison Ivy: The New Seduction, before appearing in films, including, The In Crowd (2000), Going Greek (2001), Shallow Hal (2001) and Wild Things 2 (2004). She is perhaps best known for her roles as Meg Cummings in the entire run of soap opera, Sunset Beach (1997–1999), and as Chloe Kmetko in the series, Make It or Break It (2009–2011).\nEarly years\nWard was born and raised in Monroe, Louisiana. She is the daughter of detective Eddie Ward and Emily Sue Ward, a nurse and associate professor. Ward began modeling at age 13, leaving school and moving to New York City to do so. She attended Northeast Louisiana University for one year before pursuing her acting career.\nCareer\nWard made her acting debut appearing in the ABC daytime soap opera All My Children in 1995. The following year, she was a regular cast member on the short-lived NBC teen drama Malibu Shores, produced by Aaron Spelling. She made guest appearances on Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess and had secondary role in the erotic thriller film Poison Ivy: The New Seduction.\nIn late 1996, Ward was cast as virginal Meg Cummings on the Aaron Spelling's NBC soap opera Sunset Beach, which aired from 1997 to 1999. In 1999, she turned to films, and starred as the psychotic Brittany Foster in the 2000 teen thriller The In Crowd. The movie was a commercial disappointment in theaters, but found some success on cable and home video. The following year, Ward played a supporting role in the Farrelly Brothers movie Shallow Hal. She has also acted in numerous other direct-to-DVD movies, and has made guest appearances in various TV shows, most notably Friends.\nIn 2009, she landed the role Chloe Kmetko, mother of a young gymnast, on the ABC Family drama series Make It or Break It. She was part of the main cast during the show's first two seasons.\nPersonal life\nOn June 4, 2005, Ward married David C. Robinson, the vice president of Morgan Creek Productions, the movie studio that produced The In Crowd. They met when he cast her as the film lead in 1999. Dr. Wayne Keltner, a friend of the bride, performed the ceremony. She no longer acts and raises her son with Robinson in North Carolina.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
