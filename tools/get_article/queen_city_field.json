However, the expansion was cancelled in 2025 due to environmental concerns.\nThe stadium is an anchor tenant of Buffalo Color Park, a 21-acre remediated brownfield site that also includes the Heritage Discovery Center and The Powerhouse. It formerly housed Medaille University athletics events before the school's closure in 2023.\nHistory\nConstruction and opening, 2018&ndash;2020\nin Buffalo, New York, ca. 1908.]]\nJon M. Williams, founder of environmental remediation company Ontario Specialty Contracting and real estate company South Buffalo Development, originally purchased the site in a 2009 tax foreclosure auction. He contributed $3.5 million to Honeywell's $20 million cleanup of the property, and received $6.6 million in brownfield tax credits from the State of New York. The 21 acre brownfield site was formerly occupied by coal tar dye manufacturer Schoellkopf, Hartford & Hanna Company, and Williams constructed Buffalo Color Park on its grounds.\nMedaille Sports Complex opened in 2019 as the anchor tenant of Buffalo Color Park, and the $4 million facility served as home of Medaille University's athletic teams. The 5 acre complex originally consisted of a dual-purpose artificial turf field for lacrosse and soccer, along with a  building that housed locker rooms and training facilities. Medaille's small campus did not allow space for outdoor sports, and they had previously rented both All-High Stadium and Dobson Field for lacrosse and soccer games.\nClosure due to air pollution, 2021\nMedaille University was forced to close the venue in 2021 due to health concerns for athletes and spectators, citing sulfur dioxide emissions from the neighboring PVS Chemicals plant. PVS Chemicals was sued by Medaille that same year after they ignored a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation order to shut down their plant. Remediation ordered by the state later brought air quality back to acceptable levels.\nExpansion and reopening, 2022&ndash;2023\nA $7.5 million expansion was completed in 2022, adding playing surfaces for baseball, softball, and field hockey on 7 acres of previously unused land. Medaille University resumed playing at the venue for their 2022 athletic season.\nMedaille closed in 2023, which was attributed in part to debt the school owed from stadium construction and their 15-year lease with the venue.\nDaemen University utilized the venue for their inaugural lacrosse season in 2023, then moved to Coyer Field.\nSecond expansion and cancellation, 2025\n, a prior project of SixFive Stadium Experience]]\nA $10 million expansion of the newly renamed Queen City Field was to be completed in 2026 to host Buffalo Pro Soccer, a team competing in the USL Championship and USL Super League. The expansion would have been be privately funded by Buffalo Color Park owner Jon M. Williams along with Buffalo Pro Soccer's ownership group, which includes Buffalo Bills player Reid Ferguson.\nThe site selection by Buffalo Pro Soccer was criticized due to the property's environmental history and distance from downtown Buffalo. Buffalo Pro Soccer's favored site choice of the former Buffalo News headquarters on Washington Street would have cost $40 million and required $20 million in public funding. United Steelworkers Local 8823, which represents the workers of PVS Chemicals, opposed the stadium's expansion.\nPVS Chemicals released a statement criticizing the expansion plans:\nModular construction was to be utilized to quickly complete the renovation, with the parts manufactured by SixFive Stadium Experience. SixFive Stadium Experience previously manufactured Willoughby Community Park for Vancouver FC of the Canadian Premier League.\nCapacity of the expanded venue would have been 7,600, and with USL implementing promotion and relegation beginning in 2027, it would have been expandable to 15,000 should Buffalo Pro Soccer have earned promotion to USL Division One. The baseball and softball diamonds that were added in 2022 would have been removed as part of the expansion, while the complex's other playing surfaces would have been retained as practice fields.\nLocal politicians hoped the stadium would have spawned a new entertainment district within the city's Valley neighborhood, along with the nearby OnCore Golf ShotClub Social driving range that was to open in 2026.\nThe expansion was cancelled by Buffalo Pro Soccer on July 3, 2025, announcing they had terminated their land lease with Jon M. Williams due to environmental concerns.\nTransportation access\nQueen City Field is located within one mile of the Smith Street exit (Exit 4) of Interstate 190 (northbound and southbound).\nNiagara Frontier Transportation Authority maintains the Seneca & Babcock bus stop a half-mile north of the venue, providing local service on Route 15 from the Valley neighborhood to downtown Buffalo (northbound) and West Seneca (southbound).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n}}"
