Emperor Peak is situated in the Taku Range of the Juneau Icefield,  north of Juneau, and  south-southwest of Taku Towers, on land managed by Tongass National Forest. The Taku Range is a north–south trending ridge on the edge of the Taku Glacier. This mountain was named in 1964 by members of the Juneau Icefield Research Project, and officially adopted in 1965 by the U.S. Geological Survey.&nbsp;\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Emperor Peak is located in a subpolar oceanic climate zone, with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Coast Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20&nbsp;°C with wind chill factors below −30&nbsp;°C. The month of July offers the most favorable weather to view or climb Emperor Peak.&nbsp;\nGallery\nFile:Taku Towers and Emperor Peak.jpg|Emperor Peak (left) with Taku Towers centered\nFile:Taku Towers with Emperor Peak.jpg|Taku Towers with Emperor Peak (right)\nSee also\n}}\n*List of mountain peaks of Alaska\n*Geography of Alaska\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Emperor Peak: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/sinnokrak/4274812637/in/album-72157623087847175/ Flickr photo]\n* Emperor Peak [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-5846057/United%20States/Alaska/Juneau%20City%20and%20Borough/Emperor%20Peak weather forecast]\n* Emperor Peak from north with Taku Towers: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/singularoutdoor/3915554974/in/photolist-6Y1f5w-7Gvytd-7Gvtrs-8Ypzs-poZpcB-YNLgvD-8Ypp2-5dbHbq-7vPhLJ-Yq9tv3-2DZrEZ-8Ypp3-fL5QRv-8Ypp4-pmWtCE-7vKxDX-5TQXse-bDF2CT-5TVgij-p7uhGE-6XWdTp-a4DGdi-odBss9-7vQnm7-8YoT7-p7vf6N-dYYgy5-2iHfEz-5M2eR1-2hC8Xm-8LuspF-acUTZ5-YNP2JV-adPxnF-6XWdHg-8Ypu4-tXjWr6-p7uwXc-Yq9Gz9-8YoXW-6FqkXR-5TFSUp-2cxNDC7-eJJnik-7vKs48-p7viwq-8Ypee-edtma9-EaG3n-8YoKR Flickr photo]"
