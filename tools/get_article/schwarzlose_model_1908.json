It has no slide, instead the mechanism is operated by the barrel being projected forward due to the gas pressure and the friction of the bullet passing through the bore, the compressed recoil spring drives the barrel back, stripping the top cartridge from the magazine, chambering the round, and pressing the cartridge head against the standing breech, which is part of the frame.\nSee also\n* Hino Komuro M1908 Pistol\n* Schwarzlose MG M.07/12\n* Steyr Mannlicher M1894\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090603093046/http://www.gunsworld.com/gun_pistols/schwarzlose.htm Archive.org]\n* [http://www.hunt101.com/data/500/Schwarzlose_001.jpg Hunt 101.com]\n* [http://www.hunt101.com/data/500/Schwarzlose_002.jpg Hunt 101.com]\n* [http://www.hunt101.com/data/500/Schwarzlose_003.jpg Hunt 101.com]\n* [http://www.hunt101.com/data/500/Schwarzlose_004.jpg Hunt 101.com]"
