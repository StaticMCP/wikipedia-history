Consequently, to this pact of federation, Ossorio was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in his home region Campania and his seat in the IdV caucus.\nOn 20 September 2007, Ossorio announced that the Democratic Republicans were joining the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) alongside fellow ex-PRI members of the European Republicans Movement (MRE).\nIn 2010 the party returned into the PRI's fold.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
