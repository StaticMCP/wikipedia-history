The awards should be similar in stature to the Governor General Awards for Literature, and they should raise standards in film and radio, help Canadians understand the work of Canadian artists and broadcasters, and recognize Canadian creative effort.\nIt was eventually agreed that there would be Canadian Radio Awards, and Canadian Film Awards, and that the physical prizes would be Canadian paintings. For the first awards presentations, twenty-eight short films and one full-length film were entered. The prize to each winner was an original painting by a Canadian artist, valued at $50.00. The ceremony, which took place at Ottawa's Little Elgin Theatre, was hosted by politician Robert Winters.\nWinners\n*Film of the Year: 'The Loon's Necklace — Crawley Films, F.R.
