Blabbermouth.net stated that \"Wage War's evolution shows on \"Stigma\" with lead single \"Magnetic\". This is a soft, ethereal song, which is unusual for the band and gives a nod to contemporaries Bad Omens and Sleep Token. \"Magnetic\" has pop vocals, with heavy effects on Briton Bond's vocal lines, and rich guitars, making this a very pop-friendly song. It's also the most mainstream-sounding song these guys have released to date.\" Jake Richardson of Kerrang! stated that \"The ominous, atmospheric dancehall vibes of opener The Show's About to Start quickly give way to the chunky riffs of guitarists Cody Quistad and Seth Blake, and from there on out, the band deliver 10 tracks of unrelenting metalcore might\".\nComposition\nStigma has been described as metalcore with electronic, pop, and hip hop elements.\nTrack listing\n| length1       = 3:17\n| title2        = Self Sacrifice\n| writer2       =\n| length2       = 2:57\n| title3        = Magnetic\n| writer3       =\n| length3       = 3:13\n| title4        = Nail5\n| writer4       =\n| length4       = 2:34\n| title5        = Blur\n| writer5       =\n| length5       = 3:02\n| title6        = Tombstone\n| writer6       =\n| length6       = 2:58\n| title7        = Happy Hunting\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 2:59\n| title8        = Hellbent\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 3:05\n| title9        = In My Blood\n| writer9       =\n| length9       = 2:58\n| title10       = Is This How It Ends?\n| writer10      =\n| length10      = 3:59\n| total_length  = 31:02\n}}\nPersonnel\nWage War\n* Briton Bond – lead vocals, engineering\n* Seth Blake – lead guitar, backing vocals, engineering\n* Cody Quistad – rhythm guitar, clean vocals, production, engineering\n* Chris Gaylord – bass guitar, backing vocals, engineering\n* Stephen Kluesener – drums, engineering\nAdditional personnel\n* Drew Fulk – production\n* Zakk Cervini – mixing\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Stigma\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
