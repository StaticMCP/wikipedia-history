The sub-plot was also condemned by Action For Aids, a Singaporean non-governmental organisation \"dedicated to fighting HIV/AIDS infection\", who stated that \"The portrayal of gay men as paedophiles further perpetuates falsehoods that create further suffering among an already marginalised and stigmatised population.\" A second sub-plot involving parents, portrayed by Kym Ng and Brandon Wong, worrying about the sexual orientation of their son, portrayed by Benjamin Tan, and behaving in a homophobic manner, was also criticised.\nIn response to the criticism, Mediacorp issued an apology, stating that it had \"no intention to disrespect or discriminate against the LGBTQ community in the drama\". A spokesperson for the company stated that the first sub-plot was meant to \"encourage young people to be aware of potential dangers and not be afraid to speak up and protect themselves\", and that the second sub-plot was meant to \" depict the real life struggles some parents face in communicating with their children on topics such as relationships and sexual orientation\".\nInternet\nSingapore has particularly established LGBTQ portals owing to its high Internet penetration rates and the restriction on LGBT content in print and broadcast media.\n*Blowing Wind Gay Forum is an online discussion forum for gay men in Singapore started in 1997 to discuss any issues which concern them.
