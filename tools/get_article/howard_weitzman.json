Simpson, and John DeLorean.\nWeitzman was a founding partner at Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump LLP (KWIKA), a boutique litigation firm in Santa Monica, California.\nEducation\nWeitzman completed his B.A. degree at the University of Southern California (1962) and  his J.D. degree at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law (1965). He was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1966.\nEarly career\nWeitzman taught trial advocacy at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law for 12 years.\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Weitzman served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Operations for Universal Studios, where he was responsible for corporate restructuring.\nLegal career\nFor a time, Weitzman was a Certified Specialist in Criminal Law (the State Bar of California Board of Legal Specialization).
