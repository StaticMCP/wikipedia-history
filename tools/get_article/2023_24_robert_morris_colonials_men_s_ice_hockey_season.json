The Colonials represented Robert Morris University, played their home games at the Clearview Arena and were coached by Derek Schooley in his 18th season.\nSeason\nWith the team returning to the ice for the first time in over two years, the team accomplished its primary objective for the year simply by existing. There were few, if any, expectations for the team that still had to learn how to work together. Predictably, both the offense and defense were weak but neither were embarrassingly so; the Colonials averaged more than 2 goals per game despite suffering through a terrible stretch in the middle of the season. The team's porous defense surrendered an average of almost 40 shots per game and Robert Morris was routinely outshot throughout the season. While starter Chad Veltri faced an daunting task in most games, he did give the Colonials a chance to win on most nights. The Niagara transfer stopped well more than 90% of the shots he faced and led the nation in saves per game.\nAs the season progressed, Robert Morris was consistently ranked among the worst teams, but that didn't stop the Colonials from producing a few highlights. The shutout of Bowling Green in just their second game back was a welcome relief for the fans who hadn't seen the program win since 2021. While their road trip to Minneapolis resulted in two losses, RMU's defense stood strong against the highly-ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers. The best moment of the year, however, was probably the team's first playoff game. The RMU power play scored twice to give the team a 2-goal lead over Bentley entering the third period. While Robert Morris was unable to hold the lead, they still had a chance to win in overtime. Just before the end of the extra session, Cameron Garvey intercepted a pass behind the Falcons' cage and wrapped the puck around to score the winning goal. The team was unable to parlay their upset victory into any further success, but that did not detract from their successful return.\nOff of the ice, the team had two very positive developments over the course of the year. The first was a deal struck with SportsNet Pittsburgh to broadcast select games for both the men's and women's teams. Not only would this increase the visibility of the program, but the additional funds would help to stability the program. Towards the end of the season, the university announced plans for a new $28 million arena and were seeking to have some of the cost offset by the state. While estimates put the completion for the project approximately three years away, the plans themselves demonstrated that the school was now expecting to keep its ice hockey team around for the foreseeable future.\nDepartures\nNote: All departures occurred after the 2020–21 season.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Justin Addamo || Forward ||  || Transferred to Rensselaer\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Garrett Clegg || Forward ||  || Transferred to Oswego State\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Reid Cooper || Goaltender ||  || Transferred to Curry\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Matt Guerra || Forward ||  || Transferred to Holy Cross\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Santeri Hartikainen || Forward ||  || Transferred to American International\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Kyler Head || Forward ||  || Transferred to Mercyhurst\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Grant Hebert || Forward ||  || Transferred to Maine\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Randy Hernández || Forward ||  || Transferred to Canisius\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Nick Jenny || Defenseman ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Roman Kraemer || Forward ||  || Left program (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Brian Kramer || Defenseman ||  || Transferred to American International\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| David Lafrance || Defenseman ||  || Returned to juniors (Halifax Mooseheads)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Nick Lalonde || Forward ||  || Left program (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Geoffrey Lawson || Forward ||  || Left program (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Tyler Love || Defenseman ||  || Transferred to Wisconsin–Eau Claire\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Dyllan Lubbesmeyer || Goaltender ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Brendon Michaelian || Defenseman ||  || Transferred to Ferris State\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Nick Prkusic || Forward ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Nolan Schaeffer || Forward ||  || Left program (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Aidan Spellacy || Forward ||  || Transferred to St. Cloud State\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Bradley Stonnell || Defenseman ||  || Transferred to Wisconsin–Superior\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Jordan Timmons || Forward ||  || Transferred to Long Island\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Darcy Walsh || Forward ||  || Left program (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Quinn Warmuth || Defenseman ||  || Transferred to Oswego State\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Noah West || Goaltender ||  || Transferred to Michigan\n|}\nRecruiting\nDue to the team being dormant for two years, the vast majority of the roster is made up of players new to the program.
