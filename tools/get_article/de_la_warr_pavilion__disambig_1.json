It is sometimes claimed to be the first major Modernist public building in Britain.\nIn 2005, after an extensive restoration, the De La Warr Pavilion reopened as a contemporary arts centre, encompassing one of the largest galleries on the south coast of England.\nOn 18 February 2022, the bandstand, added early in the 21st century, was destroyed by strong winds from Storm Eunice.\nHistory\n, 1998]]\nThe new seafront building was the result of an architectural competition initiated by Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr, after whom the building was named.\nThe 9th Earl, a committed socialist and Mayor of Bexhill, persuaded Bexhill council to develop the site as a public building. The competition was announced in the ''Architects' Journal'' in February 1934, with a programme that specified an entertainment hall to seat at least 1,500 people; a 200-seat restaurant; a reading room; and a lounge. Initially, the budget for the project was limited to £50,000, although this was later raised to £80,000. Run by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the competition attracted over 230 entrants, many of them practising in the Modernist style.\nThe architects selected for the project, Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff, were leading figures in the Modern Movement. The aesthetics employed in the International Style proved especially suited to the building, tending towards streamlined, industrially-influenced designs, often with expansive metal-framed windows, and eschewing traditional brick and stonework in favour of concrete and steel construction. Amongst the building's most innovative features was its use of a welded steel frame construction, pioneered by structural engineer Felix Samuely. Construction of the De La Warr Pavilion began in January 1935. The building was opened on 12 December of the same year by the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth).\nDuring World War II, the De La Warr Pavilion was used by the military. Bexhill and Sussex in general were vulnerable if the Germans decided to mount an invasion (Operation Sea Lion). Amongst those who served at the pavilion during the war was Spike Milligan, later a noted comedian. The building suffered minor damage to its foundations when the Metropole hotel adjacent to the building's western side was destroyed by German bombers.\nAfter the War, management of the pavilion was taken over by Bexhill Corporation (which later became Rother District Council). In the 1970s and 1980s, changes were made to the building, many of which were inconsistent with its original design and aesthetic. Lack of funds also resulted in an ongoing degradation of the building's fabric. It was used as a venue for indoor car boot sales and the exterior lost its original signage.\nIn 1986, the De La Warr Pavilion was granted a Grade I listed building status, essentially protecting the building from further inappropriate alteration. 1989 saw the formation of the Pavilion Trust, a group dedicated to protecting and restoring the building. Playwright David Hare notioned that the site be used as an art gallery as opposed to an expected privatised redevelopment. In 2002, after a long application process, the De La Warr Pavilion was granted £6&nbsp;million by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, to restore the building and turn it into a contemporary arts centre. Work began in 2004 on the De La Warr Pavilion's regeneration and a transfer of the building's ownership from Rother District Council to the De La Warr Pavilion Charitable Trust. On 15 October 2005, after an 18-month long extensive programme of restoration, the De La Warr Pavilion officially reopened as a contemporary arts centre, encompassing one of the largest galleries on the south coast of England.\nA small collection of archival materials related to the De La Warr Pavilion is collected in the Serge Chermayeff Papers held by the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York City.\nQuotes\nDirectors\n]]\nFor Rother District Council\n*(date needed)–1999: Caroline Collier\n*1999–2011: Alan Haydon\nDe La Warr Pavilion Charitable Trust\n*2003–2011: Alan Haydon\n*2011–present: Stewart Drew\nHonorary patrons\n*President: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall\n*Earl and Countess De La Warr\n*Eddie Izzard\n*Jill Theis\n*Richard Sykes\n*Antony Gormley\n*Ivan Chermayeff\nSee also\n* Saltdean Lido\n* Embassy Court\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
