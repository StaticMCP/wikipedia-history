The battle took place during the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition, a filibustering campaign which took place during the Mexican War of Independence.\nThe combatants\nThe battle involved the Republican Army of the North (RAN), which was led by filibusters Samuel Kemper (who had been involved in an 1804 rebellion in Florida), Augustus Magee, and Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara, the expedition's leader, fighting against the Spanish Royalist forces commanded by Manuel María de Salcedo, Governor of the province of Texas, and Simón de Herrera, the governor of Nuevo León.\nThe RAN comprised Anglo-Americans, Mexicans and Indigenous Indians. The group also had some help from the United States,\nBackground\nIn 1812 the RAN crossed over the Sabine River from Louisiana into Texas.   Flying a green flag, they captured the town of Nacogdoches on August 7, 1812.  They quickly marched to Goliad, where they captured the Presidio La Bahía.  Kemper became a commander of the force upon the death of Colonel Magee there.\nFrom November 13, 1812, to February 19, 1813, Goliad was besieged when the Royalist army finally arrived to confront them.  Unable to defeat the Republican Army, however, the Royalists were forced to retreat to San Antonio in March, 1813.  Kemper and the RAN, numbering about 900 men, pursued.\nThe battle\nThe Royalist force, numbering 1,500 men, planned to ambush the RAN from a ridge which overlooked Rosillo Creek near its confluence with Salado Creek, approximately nine miles southeast of San Antonio de Bexar.  Their trap failed when they were detected by the Republican forces, who defeated them in less than an hour.  At a cost of six men, the Republican Army killed 100 to 330 Royalists and captured materiel including six cannon and 1,500 horses.\nAftermath\nThe Royalists retreated to San Antonio where they surrendered to the Republican Army on April 1. Two days later Salcedo, Herrera, and 12 others were executed by the victors.  On April 6 the Republican Army issued a draft declaration of independence.\nLocation\nA granite marker was erected in 1936 to commemorate this battle, but a discovery made in 2015 indicates this location may be incorrect. The battle actually probably took place under the part of I-410 that is about 4500 feet due west of the intersection of Hildebrand Road, S WW White Road and Cacias Road.\nSee also\n* History of Texas\nReferences\nSources\n* \"The Sons of the Republic of Texas\" By Thomas B.
