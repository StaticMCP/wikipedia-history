They were historically the simplest form of outdoor footwear (sandals of any type were not worn indoors). , due to their cheap and rustic nature, are considered to be a very informal type of footwear, and are not worn with formal kimono. They are typically worn with  socks, and are woven so that the wearer's toes generally protrude slightly over the edge of the shoe.\nwere once common footwear in Japan. There are records of  in the Heian period (794–1185 CE), with the possibility of  having existed before this time. In the Edo period (1603–1867 CE), geta were worn in cities, but anyone making a long journey wore . They were also worn for energetic or prolonged labour. Their light weight and grip were valued.\nIn modern-day Japan,  are worn by Buddhist monks, and by some fishers of mountain streams. Zori and geta are worn far more commonly by the general population.\nConstruction\nFile:Home Made Shoes in Japan (1914-09 by Elstner Hilton) (borders cropped).jpg| were traditionally made in the home, as shown here (September 1914).

As  could be homemade from cheap materials, and many people learned how to make them in childhood, that was not a problem.  could also be cheaply bought. Travellers carried a supply and discarded them when they were worn out.\nMaterials\nFile:Waraji on tatami.jpg| woven entirely from rice straw (somewhat finer straw, and more tightly packed, than the festival zori above)\nFile:Waraji 1.JPG| with two different-coloured fibers for the warp and weft.

Long straw (not broken by the processing methods) must be beaten to soften the fibers before use. Most other ropemaking fibers can also be used, such as cotton, hemp, palm fibers, or even strips of rag. The straps of the  might be covered, often with paper. Cardboard soles are used on some modern commercial designs.\nTying\nFile:Kyoto Gion Matsuri J09 130.jpg|These  are made as in the instructions above, but two small loops are woven on each side (instead of one big foot-crossing loop), and the leftover-warp loops at the heel are retained.

This is a sandal of fine rice-straw matting and normally has no separate sole. But varieties of it, made of woven rushes of various kinds or of bamboo-sheath, are commonly soled with coiled hemp-rope (asaura-zōri), with wistaria-stems, (fujiura-zōri), or with wood in lateral sections (zōri-geta or itatsuke-zōri). A superior variety, known as setta, has a raw-hide sole with (sic)'' iron heel-piece.The zōri is kept on by means of two thick soft cords (hanao) of twisted cotton or paper, covered with leather or cloth, issuing from each side near the heel and uniting with a short, thinner piece which passes between, and is gripped by, the first and second toes. Rush zōri with very thick tapering cords of straw-rope covered with white paper or cotton are known as fuku-zōri. In modern times the hanao do not come so far back as in former days; the sandal itself is also a little shorter, instead of being slightly longer, than the foot (translator did not translate the full book text, but from the acknowledgements of vol 1 it sounds as if some of his translations might be incorporated into the work. Volume 1 came out in 1919, volume 2 in 1920. Note the work is in the public domain, therefore the fulltext is not copyright)}}\n}}\nExternal links"
