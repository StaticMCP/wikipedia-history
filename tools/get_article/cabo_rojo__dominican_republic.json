More specifically, it belongs to Pedernales Province, the southernmost province of the country.\nThis part of the country is known for its bauxite mines and its beautiful beaches like Bahía de las Águilas and Cabo Rojo.  The area is being rapidly changed as a major cruise ship port opened here in 2024.\nReferences\nhttp://www.mi-rd.com/Provincias/Pedernales/Pedernales.htm"
