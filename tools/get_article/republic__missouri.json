As of the 2020 census, the city's population was 18,750. In 2019, its population was 16,938, making it the second largest city in Greene County in the U.S. state of Missouri. It is also the fourth largest city in the Springfield, Missouri, Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory\nEarly settlement in southwest Greene County centered on the community of Little York.  When the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad built a line through the area in the early 1870s, Little York was not on the route.  Settlement moved two miles away to Brookline which was on the rail line's route.\nAnother group of settlers decided to take up residency at another area along the tracks just four miles southwest of Brookline.  This village eventually became known as Republic, and was incorporated in 1871  While the railroad did go through Republic, there initially was no switch or depot located in the city.  A public subscription of $1000 raised the funds to build a depot in the city.  Subsequent growth is attributed to the depot's completion.\nConsolidation with Village of Brookline\nIn 2005, the cities of Republic and Brookline consolidated as Missouri State laws allow after a vote of the residents of both communities approved the consolidation with Republic taking over all aspects of city government. Originally, Brookline was to retain its own identity, but the city limit signs have since been changed to Republic's. However, according to Section I (b) of the Intergovernmental Agreement:\n\"Name of Consolidated Municipality - The name of the consolidated municipality shall be \"City of Republic.\"  To help preserve the identity of the Village, the City will place signs with text “Village of Brookline” at the current corporate limits of the Village.  Placement of signage is subject to State sign regulations when placed in State right-of-way. The City of Republic will work with the United States Postal Service to help preserve the history and operation of the Brookline Station Post Office.\nWhile the Village of Brookline no longer exists as an independent, incorporated community, the post office and associated ZIP Code of 65619 remain in operation.  In addition, BNSF Railway continues to designate Brookline as a station point on its network map and system timetables.\nGeography\nRepublic is located at  (37.121652, -93.471440).
