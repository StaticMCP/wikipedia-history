The company was mostly a one-man operation, run by the founder, Howard Renner. The boats were built one at a time, with only 12 examples completed.\nDesign\nThe Heritage 20 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with extensive wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig; a spooned, raked stem; a raised counter, angled transom; a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel. It displaces  and carries  of lead ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of  with the standard keel.\nThe boat is fitted with a Westerbeke diesel engine or a small  outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds  and the fresh water tank also has a capacity of .\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin and two straight settee berths in the main cabin. The galley is located on both sides, just aft of the bow cabin. The galley is equipped with a sink. The head is located in the bilge, down in the extra-wide long keel. Cabin headroom is .\nFor sailing downwind the design may be equipped with a symmetrical spinnaker. The design has a hull speed of .\nOperational history\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"the most unusual feature of the Heritage 20 is her extra-wide keel, big enough to contain a marine toilet (though we wonder how the waste is pumped uphill to a seacock without backflow, in the good old days before the advent of holding tanks). Best features: Perhaps it is no accident that the Heritage's shape bears a strong resemblance to the beauteous profiles of John Alden's designs, since her designer worked in the Alden office. Her curved stem and stern counter could be right out of an Alden style book. Pretty! Despite her shallow draft and tall rig, Heritage will probably sail better than her comp[etitor]s, none of which is deeper; her high SA/D will make her relatively faster in light air. Worst features: Even with the trick cabin sole, there's not much room below. Big and tall people beware!\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20210513143349/http://www.davidhazy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heritage.jpg Photo of a Heritage 20 with the designer at the helm]"
