Te Winkle, and a priest-king of ancient Shu by Chinese archaeologists.]]\nClothing in ancient Shu refers to clothing worn in the Ancient Kingdom of Shu (1046 BC? – , modern-day Chengdu Plain, Sichuan). Archaeological finds in Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have provided the best source of information on ancient Shu costume. Shu clothing's right over left lapel closing () was considered \"very strange\" by Yang Xiong, a 1st-century BC author from Pi County, Chengdu, as in contrast to contemporary Chinese Western Han clothing's left over right lapel closing ().\nOverview\nThe large bronze figure uncovered at Sanxingdui wears a crown-like headdress and three layers of robes of fancy design, which are referred to as the \"royal dress\" of ancient Shu by Chinese archaeologists. The outer garment with short sleeves is covered with intricately designed patterns of birds and mythical creatures. The middle garment is mostly hidden for being the shortest of the three, with its V-shaped neckline visible. The longest inner garment with tight long sleeves is partially visible from the back, which has a swallow-tailed hem.\nThe most common clothing worn by those bronze figures comprises a tight jacket, or a close-fitting, usually knee length tunic with a belt, and a pair of tight pants. The jackets are mostly plain and simple without decoration, while the tunics have linear geometric patterns, albeit much less intricate compared to the \"royal dress\". One exception is the jacket worn by a bronze figure with an animal-form headdress, decorated with motifs, according to Li Laiyu, resembling cloud and lightning.\nGallery\nFile:三星堆出土青铜大立人像, 2017-09-17.jpg|Large bronze figure from Sanxingdui\nFile:金沙遗址文物 Jinsha Bronze Man.jpg|Bronze figurine from Jinsha\nFile:Ancient Altar, Bronze, Sanxingdui 2.jpg|Bronze altar with male figures wearing belted tunics, Sanxingdui\nFile:Sanxingdui Oct 2007 518.jpg|Female figures carved on jade blade, Sanxingdui\nFile:Bronze Figures, Sanxingdui.jpg|Bronze figurines wearing plain jackets and tight pants, Sanxingdui\nFile:Muzeo Sanxingdui 58.jpg|Bronze figurines wearing belted tunics, Sanxingdui\nSee also\n* Ba–Shu culture\n* Clothing in the ancient world\n* Shu embroidery\n* Tocharian clothing\nReferences"
