Cariou then decided to begin using the toxic material to create photographs he has named petrography.\n* He began experimenting with the new medium with assistance from Dr. Dusan Stulik, a senior research scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute.\n* Cariou uses a specific medium of petroleum and sunlight in his photography “Petrography is literally petroleum-photography:  the creation of images through the interaction of sunlight and the heavy petroleum product known as bitumen, which is the main source of the vast supplies of oil in Canada’s Athabasca tar sands region”.\nReferences"
