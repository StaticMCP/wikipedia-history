The contributing elements of the complex include a vernacular Greek Revival style farmhouse, two barns (one with silo), a carriage house, a corncrib, a smoke house, a stone retaining wall, and a hitching post.  The farmhouse consists of a two-story, three-bay wide, sidehall plan main block built in 1832, with a 1 1/2 story side wing added in 1852.  A rear kitchen wing was added in 1986.  The main barn was built in 1852.  The complex is representative of rural agrarian farmsteads of the 19th and early-20th centuries in the Finger Lakes Region.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nReferences"
