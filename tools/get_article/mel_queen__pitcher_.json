From 1942 through 1952, he played for the New York Yankees and Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Maxwell, Pennsylvania, he batted and threw right-handed.\nIn an eight-season career, Queen posted a 27–40 record with 328 strikeouts and a 5.09 ERA in 556 innings pitched. His best season was in 1951 when he led the National League pitchers with a 6.58 SO/9 (123 SO in 168 IP).\nOn August 27, 1951, Queen became a notable footnote in baseball history when he was thrown out by two feet at first base by strong-armed Brooklyn Dodger outfielder Carl Furillo after Queen had apparently singled into right field.\nHis son, Melvin Douglas Queen, was an MLB outfielder-turned-pitcher who played with the Reds and Angels and also coached and managed for the Toronto Blue Jays.\nQueen died in Fort Smith, Arkansas, at the age of 64.\nSee also\n*List of second-generation Major League Baseball players\nReferences\nExternal links"
