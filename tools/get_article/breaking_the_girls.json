As they grow closer, the tension between them turns sexual, and then to something deeper. However, when only one of the women goes through with it and begins to set the other up to be framed for murder, she realizes if she's going to stay out of jail, she's going to have to come up with a plot just as twisted of her own.\nCast\n*Agnes Bruckner as Sara Ryan\n*Madeline Zima as Alex Layton\n*Shawn Ashmore as Eric Nolan\n*Kate Levering as Nina Layton\n*Shanna Collins as Brooke Potter\n*Davenia McFadden as Detective Ross\n*Tiya Sircar as Piper Sperling\n*Melanie Mayron as Annie\n*Manish Dayal as Tim\n*Billy Mayo as Jones\n*Sam Anderson as Professor Nolan\n*John Stockwell as David Layton\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 10% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 4.74/10.
