On several occasions, there were instances of mass escapes.\n2003\nOn October 11, 2003, nearly 30 prisoners held near Kandahar managed to escape. Some reporters suggested they were actually released.\n2005\nIn July 2005, Omar al-Faruq, the highest-ranked prisoner at the base and one of the highest-ranked al-Qaeda officers ever captured, escaped along with Libyan Abu Yahya al-Libi, Saudi Muhammad Jafar Jamal al-Kahtani and Syrian Abdullah Hashimi.\nAll four prisoners had been individually found guilty of various acts of belligerence, and thus assigned to \"Cell 119\" in the days before the escape, the only cell set apart from the rest – though obstructed from guards' view.\nOn the night of July 15, the prisoners were all accounted for at the 01:50 headcount. Then, they picked the lock of the cell, changed out of their prison uniforms, sneaked into the main camp area and crawled over a damaged wall and crossed a Soviet-era minefield to meet a getaway vehicle.\nAfter their disappearance was noted at the 03:45 headcount, a massive manhunt, including the use of helicopters, was dispatched, though they didn't manage to find any of the escapees. A military police officer was initially suspected of aiding their escape, but was cleared.\nInitial reports from the U.S. military gave different names for the escapees, and included a reference to Libyan Hasan Qayad, who had appeared in a video giving a sermon on the end of Ramadan 4 November 2005.\nPentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman spoke to the press stating that this \"clearly wasn't the US military's finest hour\".\nOn 18 October, Kahtani released a videotape in Pakistan, detailing the escape and pledging further attacks against Saudi Arabia and United States.\nAl-Faruq was killed by British soldiers in Iraq in September 2006. Al-Kahtani was recaptured in Afghanistan in November 2006. Hashimi was killed in an airstrike in Afghanistan in July 2008. Al-Libi was killed in a drone strike in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan in June 2012. Consequently, all the escapees have since been captured or killed.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
