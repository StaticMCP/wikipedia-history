He attended the common schools in that community until age 13, when he went west to the Wisconsin Territory.  He first came to Janesville, Wisconsin, when there were just two families residing there, and he attended the first school taught at that settlement.  He went on to study the medical profession under Dr. Samuel Nichols in Janesville.  He then went to Chicago to further his studies under Dr. Charles V. Dyer, and subsequently attended Rush Medical College in Chicago, graduating in 1849.\nHe initially established a medical practice at Lodi, in Columbia County, Wisconsin, but, at the request of his brother, abandoned his medical practice in 1851 to come to Albany, Wisconsin, in Green County, to work in the milling and mercantile business until 1870.\nPolitically, Warren identified with the Whig Party and joined many other northern Whigs in the new Republican Party when it was established.  On the Republican Party ticket, Warren was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate from Green County in 1857, serving in the 11th and 12th Wisconsin legislatures.  After leaving office, he served as chief clerk of the Senate for the next three terms.\nIn 1862, he was collector of internal revenue at Albany by President Abraham Lincoln, and held that office for seven years.  He owned a carriage service and was a major mail contractor, operating over one hundred mail routes.\nAround 1885, he began to suffer from dementia and was sent to the sanitarium at Palmyra, Wisconsin.  He died there in August 1901.\nPersonal life and family\nJohn Holden Warren was a descendant of the New England Warrens.  His father fought in the War of 1812 and his grandfather fought in the American Revolutionary War.\nJohn Holden Warren married Mary Louise Nichols, the daughter of his first medical instructor, Dr. Samuel Nichols.
