In 2009, she finished as runner-up in the seventh and final Australian Idol, and was noted for her high-energy performances and vast vocal range. In 2013, The Daily Telegraph named Warner one of Australia's most accomplished songwriters. Warner's songwriting credits total over 11 times platinum in worldwide sales. Hayley co-wrote Grammy nominated artist Tori Kelly's single \"Hollow\", which was released 3 November 2015. After moving to Los Angeles, Warner signed a worldwide publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music in 2015.\nLife and career\nEarly life\nAs a young child, Warner was incredibly passionate about sports and set her sights on becoming the best, but at the age of seven, she was diagnosed with Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease which stripped her of her sporting dreams and forced her to learn to walk again. Through her struggle, music quickly became her therapy and true calling. When she was just twelve years old she started her first band, Cloud 9. From the ages of twelve to sixteen, she performed at 500 different venues around Australia.\n2009–2022: Australian Idol & songwriting\nIn 2009, Warner auditioned for and ultimately placed second on the seventh season of Australian Idol.\nWarner signed to Sony Music immediately after finale, and released her debut \"Good Day\" in December 2009. The song peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified gold. This was followed by \"Hands Off\" single and EP.\nIn 2012, she signed a worldwide publishing deal with Sony ATV and began collaborating with songwriter and producers all around the world.\nWarner co-wrote \"Good Night\" which was chosen by Sony Records to be the first single for The X Factor Australia season 3 winner Reece Mastin. \"Good Night\" reached No. 1 in both Australia and New Zealand, and achieved 5 times Platinum accreditation in Australia and Platinum sales in New Zealand. \"Good Night\" is the fastest selling digital single by an artist signed to Sony Music Australia in history. She then teamed up with Mastin and co-wrote his second single \"Shut Up & Kiss Me\" which reached No. 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart and achieved platinum sales in Australia and No. 1 with Gold sales in New Zealand. She also co-wrote \"Set Me on Fire\" which was chosen for season 4 contestant Bella Ferraro. The single was released in December 2012, and debuted at No. 36 on the ARIA Singles Chart. She co-wrote \"Freedom\" for artist Stan Walker that was selected for a three-year TV advertising campaign for The Salvation Army in Australia and New Zealand. She co-wrote with Tina Arena for her ninth studio album Reset. The album was released in October 2013, and spent 18 weeks in the ARIA Top 50 including debuting No. 4. Her co-written single \"Still Running\" was translated to French for the European release of the album. Her song, \"Once\" was recorded by Angy for her 2013 album Drama Queen. In 2013, she co-wrote the two runner-up singles for X Factor Australia contestants Taylor Henderson and Jai Waetford.

In 2015, she released \"Closure\".\n2022–present:I Think I Saw the Moon\nIn April 2024, Warner released the EP I Think I Saw the Moon. It featured five singles released between 2022 and 2024. The EP was made at Warner's house with her friend Tom Jordan. Warner said \"As the EP evolved, we wrote all those songs in a row and never wrote anything else. It was only those five songs. Our strike rate was insane, and we knew we were on to something.\"\nDiscography\nExtended plays\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! Title\n!
