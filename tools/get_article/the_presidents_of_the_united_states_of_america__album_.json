Columbia Records signed the band shortly after its release to handle increased distribution for the album.\nReleased during the grunge and punk music breakthrough-era, the album produced four singles—\"Kitty\", \"Lump\", \"Peaches\" and \"Dune Buggy\"—helping the group gain mainstream popularity. The Presidents of the United States of America received positive reviews, and has been certified triple Platinum by the RIAA.\nBackground and recording\nChris Ballew and Dave Dederer met while attending The Bush School in Seattle. In the 1980s and early 1990s they collaborated on various musical projects.  Ballew returned to Seattle in the summer of 1993, and he and Dederer formed what would become The Presidents of the United States of America that autumn.  Initially a drummerless duo, they performed a half-dozen or so shows in late 1993 as \"The Lo-Fis\", \"The Dynamic Duo\", and \"Pure Frosting.\" Ballew eventually came upon the name \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\" Shortly after settling on their name, Ballew and Dederer added drummer Jason Finn. In early December 1993, the band played their first show as a trio at The Romper Room in Seattle. At the time, Finn was also the drummer in the band Love Battery, who had recently changed record labels from Sub Pop to Atlas Records, an A&M subsidiary.\nIn early 1994, The Presidents recorded a 10-song cassette, Froggystyle, at Laundry Room Studios. The band sold the cassette at shows in 1994. Finn also sold the cassette from behind the bar of Seattle's legendary Comet Tavern, where he tended bar.\nIn 1994, the Presidents signed with the tiny Seattle label PopLlama Records and released their self-titled debut in the following year, featuring several remixed tracks from Froggystyle. The band also released a limited edition blue vinyl 7-inch single, \"Fuck California\", on C/Z Records. Columbia Records signed the band shortly thereafter and re-released the album in late July 1995. Driven by the singles \"Lump\", \"Peaches\", and \"Kitty\", their debut album proved to be a smash, eventually selling over three million copies.\nComposition\nCritics praised the band's catchy, humorous, and self-deprecating songs, which were a major departure from the grunge/post-grunge sound present on the airwaves. The album received Grammy nominations in 1995 and 1996.  Though \"Peaches\" met the most critical success, the band credits \"Lump\" as their favorite single. The song's strange lyrics came from a dream that Ballew had while fighting pneumonia. The antibiotics he was taking caused an allergic reaction that produced several consecutive nights of wild and crazy dreams. The lyrics for \"Peaches\" were written about a crush Ballew used to have on a girl. According to him, she had a peach tree in the front of her yard, and when he finally summoned the courage to go talk to her, he stood under the tree and smashed peaches in his fist until he decided not to talk to her.\nPackaging and release\nOriginally, the album was released in March 1995 on the independent Seattle label, PopLlama Records. This version of the album was noticeably different than other subsequent releases. The inside cover featured a picture of the band with Bill Clinton, who was the president of the United States at the time. The CD looked like a food inspection stamp. \"Feather Pluckn\" included a verse which was an homage of the Beatles' \"I've Got a Feeling\". The PopLlama release was also pressed on yellow vinyl with two bonus tracks. After the band signed to Columbia Records, the album was re-released on July 25, 1995. This version's inside cover featured a picture of the band members painted in red, white and blue in multiple pictures. The CD looks like a vinyl record label. All of the songs were re-mixed, and \"Feather Pluckn\" lost the \"I've Got a Feeling\" verse.\nIn 2004, the band independently re-released the album as a Ten Year Super Bonus Special Anniversary Edition. It featured 13 bonus tracks, including B-sides and demos, and (except for the Australian release) a bonus DVD of music videos and performance footage. This version features the food inspection stamp-like design that originally appeared on the 1995 edition. The insert picture features a collage of band performances. In addition, the liner notes were slightly updated. In 2008, the album was re-released on CD for a final time by the band's then-current label, Fugitive Recordings, minus the bonus tracks.\nIn February 2020, the group announced a vinyl reissue via Kickstarter.\nReception\nCommercial performance\nThe Presidents of the United States of America peaked at number six on the Billboard 200. As of 1997, the album has shipped over three million copies and has been certified triple platinum.\nCritical reception\n| rev2      = ''Christgau's Consumer Guide\n| rev2score =\n| rev3      = Drowned in Sound\n| rev3score = 8/10\n| rev4      = Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev4score =\n| rev5      = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev5score = D\n| rev6      = NME\n| rev6score = 7/10\n| rev7      = Q\n| rev7score =\n| rev8      = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev8score =\n| rev9      = Select\n| rev9score =\n}}\nCritical reception to The Presidents of the United States of America was mostly positive. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic retrospectively wrote that \"their quirky take on punk-pop did help expand the palette of MTV and alternative radio, and make their oddball singles part of the enduring sound of the era.\"\nTrack listing\nTen Year Super Bonus Special Anniversary Edition bonus tracks\n14–17 also appear on various editions of the \"Peaches\" single.  20–24 and 26 are performed entirely by Chris Ballew.\nTen Year Super Bonus Special Anniversary Edition Super Bonus Thrillpack DVD\nThe DVD also includes a commentary track by the band.\nPersonnel\n;The Presidents of the United States of America\n*Chris Ballew – vocals, two-string basitar\n*Dave Dederer – three-string guitbass, vocals\n*Jason Finn – no-string drums, backing vocals\n;Additional musician\n*Kim Thayil – guitar on \"Naked and Famous\"\n;Technical (PopLlama edition)\n*Conrad Uno – co-producer, engineer (tracks 2–4, 6–9, 11–12), mastering\n*Chris Ballew – co-producer\n*Dave Dederer – co-producer, front cover photo\n*Barrett Jones – engineer (tracks 1, 5, 10, 13)\n*Pete Gerrald – mastering\n*Mark Guenther – second engineer\n*Art Chantry – design\n*San Pacific International – sculptures\n*Lance Mercer – back cover photo\n;Additional technical credits (Columbia edition)\n*David Kahne – mixing (tracks 3–4, 6, 8, 10–11, 13)\n*Steve Culp – mix engineer (tracks 3–4, 6, 8, 10–11, 13)\n*Wally Traugott – mastering\n*Doug Erb – design update\n*Marty Temme – tray card photo\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1995–1996)\n!Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|Canada Albums (The Record)\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|US Billboard 200\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard)\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1995)\n!Position\n|-\n|US Billboard 200\n|align=\"center\"|185\n|-\n!Chart (1996)\n!Position\n|-\n|Australia (ARIA)\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|US Billboard'' 200\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
