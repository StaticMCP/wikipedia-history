Prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Imperial Iran sent a single film in 1977.\nAs of 2025, Iran has been nominated three times, winning twice for Asghar Farhadi's A Separation (2011) and The Salesman (2016). While Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven (1997) was the first Iranian film to be nominated for the award., won the award twice for director of A Separation (2011) and The Salesman (2013).]]\nHistory\nControversies\nOn 24 September 2012, the film A Cube of Sugar was selected as the Iranian entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards. However, on the same day the head of Iran's government controlled cinema agency called for a boycott of the Oscars due to the Innocence of Muslims video on YouTube that originated in the United States. Reuters reported that Iran's Culture and Islamic Guidance Minister Mohammad Hosseini had confirmed that Iran would boycott.\nPolitical persecution of filmmakers\nSince its Revolution, Iran has only submitted films considered adequate with the regime's Islamic law, banning several productions, arresting filmmakers and actors, and thus making impossible for them to participate in the category selection process. Despite being persecuted, many filmmakers have been shooting illegally in Iran in partnership with international production companies and international crew members (producers, editors, cinematographers), allowing other countries to selected the film as its official entry.\nIn 2024, Germany submitted for the first time a film not in the German language, the Iranian co-produced The Seed of the Sacred Fig by Mohammad Rasoulof, which follows the anti-regime 2022–2023 protests in Iran. Rasoulof himself was persecuted and incarcerated several times, until fleeing to Germany few weeks after wrapping the film's production. The film was nominated in the category.\nIn 2025, even though France is well known for its protection of the local cinema industry, the country submitted an Iranian co-production in Persian for the first time: It Was Just an Accident by Jafar Panahi, which follows the political repression in Iran and the social paranoia created by it. Panahi, also persecuted and incarcerated several times, made the film without official filming permission from the Iranian authorities. Although the filmmaker was allowed for the first time in more than twenty years to leave Iran, for the film world premiere at Cannes where it won the Palme d'Or, the production didn't receive the government approval to be screened in Iranian cinemas.\nAlso in at least twelve occasions, films made by Iranian directors represented other countries: I Love Vienna (Austria), Persepolis (France), For a Moment, Freedom (Austria), Baba Joon (Israel), Utopia (Afghanistan), Under the Shadow (United Kingdom), Parting (Afghanistan), Yeva (Armenia), Border (Sweden), Holy Spider (Denmark) and Winners (United Kingdom).\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nThe Iranian nominee is selected each fall by a committee appointed by the Farabi Cinematic Foundation. Despite poor relations with the United States, Iran has participated in the US-based competition since 1994, missing only one year. They attempted to withdraw their 1995 submission The White Balloon after sending it to Hollywood, but AMPAS refused to accept the withdrawal.\nSix of the submitted films were directed by Majid Majidi and five of them were directed by Asghar Farhadi.\nAll selected films were primarily in Persian, except for Ghobadi's two Kurdish language films and Farhadi's The Past which was in French.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Iran for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!

The movement came after numerous controversies regarding country unclear submission process were raised by popular opinion and filmmakers.\nEven though the new formal process was established, the Iranian submission committee continued to snub political films released without permission in international film festivals during 2025, such as: It Was Just an Accident by Jafar Panahi, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk by Sepideh Farsi, Cutting Through Rocks by Sara Khaki and Mohammadreza Eyni, Between Dreams and Hope by Farnoosh Samadi, Divine Comedy by Ali Asgari, Inside Amir by Amir Azizi and Past Future Continuous by Morteza Ahmadvand and Firouzeh Khosrovani.\nSaeed Roustayi, once arrested for premiering Leila's Brothers at Cannes without permission, had his new film Woman and Child (which also premiered at Cannes) shortlisted, but was ultimately snubbed.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Films\n|-\n!2025\n|Call Me Ziba · The Old Bachelor · Raha · Woman and Child''\n|}\nSee also\n*List of Iranian Academy Award winners and nominees\n*List of Academy Award winners and nominees for Best International Feature Film\n*List of Academy Award-winning foreign language films\n*Cinema of Iran\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080707023727/http://www.oscars.org/awardsdatabase/ The Official Academy Awards Database]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080622050250/http://www.oscars.org/impc_site2/index.html The Motion Picture Credits Database]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/ IMDb Academy Awards Page]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/list/dxdEtQ28AuQ/ IMDb list of submitted films]"
