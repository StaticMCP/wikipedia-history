It was released on 26 April 1993 by Mute and Sire as the second single from their eighth studio album, Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993). The song reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and matched the success of the previous single \"I Feel You\" on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it reached one. The B-side is \"My Joy\", the only exclusive B-side from the Songs of Faith and Devotion album, and is a rock track in the vein of \"I Feel You\".\nThe 7-inch version of \"Walking in My Shoes\" is not the same as the one on Songs of Faith and Devotion. The sound has been made more noisy and dirty, especially the drums in the verse, and the intro has been shortened. When performed live, elements of the \"Grungy Gonads\" mix are used in an extended intro and throughout the song. The song was cited by then-member Alan Wilder to be his favourite song from the album together with \"In Your Room\". Its music video was directed by Anton Corbijn.\nRelease and commercial reception\n\"Walking in My Shoes\" was released on 26 April 1993 in the United Kingdom. The single failed to reach the UK top 10 or the US top 40; nevertheless, the song became a top ten hit in some countries of Continental Europe, and became a recurring song during the live performances of the band since 1993. The song peaked number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100. On the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, it peaked number one for a week.\nU2 lead singer Bono listed the song on his \"60 Songs That Saved My Life\" playlist.\nCritical reception\nDavid Fricke from Melody Maker wrote: Walking in My Shoes' is better neo-Bowie than we've heard in some time, a long-distance 'Heroes' knockoff via the group's own 'Enjoy the Silence' complete with hints of Robert Fripp's skysaw guitar.\" Sam Wood from Philadelphia Inquirer felt that the song, \"with its moody minor-key melody and burbling bass-line reminiscent of early Simple Minds, adapts an ancient Native American proverb to create an anthemic plea for compassion\". Andrew Harrison from Select named it the best track of the album, noting its \"intensified, pulsating downward spiral\". Leesa Daniels from Smash Hits gave it three out of five, adding: \"The great thing about the 'Mode is their songs always have a chorus that's easy to sing along to. That's the case here, although for a change it does take a few listens to get the hang of it. The song is very atmospheric in a black-and-white-grainy-film for the video kind of way. Lovely.\"\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for \"Walking in My Shoes\" was directed by Dutch photographer, film director and music video director Anton Corbijn. At the beginning of the second verse, there is a shot of Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Alan Wilder with naked women on their laps. This was removed in the MTV version in the US and replaced with footage of the three band members standing still, alone, from earlier in the video. The uncut version has appeared on The Videos 86>98, Devotional, The Best of, Volume 1 and Video Singles Collection DVDs. The video visuals are recognizably inspired to Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder paintings.\nLive performances\nDepeche Mode performed \"Walking in My Shoes\" live during their 2017–18 Global Spirit Tour. The song was accompanied by a narrative video about a transgender musician getting dressed in the morning and going to perform at a bar.\nTrack listings\nAll songs were written by Martin Gore.\n* UK CD single\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (seven inch mix) – 4:59\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads mix) – 6:24\n# \"My Joy\" (seven inch mix) – 3:57\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide mix) – 5:11\n* UK limited-edition CD and 12-inch single\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (extended twelve inch mix) – 6:54\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet mix) – 6:35\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic mix) – 6:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale mix) – 4:54\n* UK 12-inch single\n:A1. \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads mix) – 6:24\n:A2. \"Walking in My Shoes\" (seven inch mix) – 4:59\n:B1. \"My Joy\" (seven inch mix) – 3:57\n:B2. \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide mix) – 5:11\n:* Note: The Japanese CD single switches tracks A1 and A2.\n* UK and US cassette single; US 7-inch single\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" – 4:59\n# \"My Joy\" – 3:57\n* US 12-inch and maxi-cassette single\n:A1. \"Walking in My Shoes\" (extended twelve inch mix) – 6:53\n:A2. \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet mix edit) – 6:10\n:A3. \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads mix) – 6:24\n:B1. \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic mix) – 6:11\n:B2. \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale mix) – 4:54\n:B3. \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide mix) – 5:12\n* US maxi-CD single\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (seven inch mix) – 4:59\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads mix) – 6:24\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet mix) – 6:10\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide mix) – 5:12\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (extended twelve inch mix) – 6:53\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic mix) – 6:11\n# \"My Joy\" – 3:58\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale mix) – 4:54\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1993)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n| 74\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark (IFPI)\n| 5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (European Hit Radio)\n| 7\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista)\n| 7\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Greece (IFPI)\n| 7\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)\n| 7\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Portugal (AFP)\n| 3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Spain (AFYVE)\n| 6\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Indie (Music Week)\n|align=center|1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100\n| 66\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1993)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 93\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Topplistan)\n| 89\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Modern Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n| 9\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n|rowspan=\"2\"|26 April 1993\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Mute\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japan\n|1 May 1993\n|CD\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Number one modern rock hits of 1993\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://archives.depechemode.com/discography/singles/29_walkinginmyshoes.html Single information from the official Depeche Mode web site]\n* [http://www.allmusic.com/album/walking-in-my-shoes-mw0000619096 AllMusic review]"
