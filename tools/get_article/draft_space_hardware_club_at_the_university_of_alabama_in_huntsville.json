Founded informally through balloon and rocketry projects as early as 2006 and formalized in the mid-2010s, the club provides undergraduate and graduate students hands-on experience in designing, building, testing, and launching spaceflight hardware.\nSHC is one of the largest and most active engineering student groups at UAH, with membership typically ranging from 100 to nearly 300 students. Unlike many university rocketry or CubeSat teams, the club charges no dues and covers nearly all project and travel costs through grants from NASA, the [https://spacegrant.org/ Alabama Space Grant Consortium], and private donors. It regularly fields multiple teams in international competitions such as the [https://cansatcompetition.com/ CanSat Competition] (where it has repeatedly swept the top U.S. spots) and the University Rover Challenge, and participates in NASA’s RockOn/[https://www.nasa.gov/wallops/stem/rocksat/ RockSat-X] program for suborbital payloads.\nThe club also conducts extensive STEM outreach across northern Alabama, including live contacts with astronauts aboard the International Space Station through the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) program.\nHistory\nSHC traces its roots to student rocketry and ballooning activities at UAH dating back to at least 2006 (with initial founding uncertain), with the BalloonSat program launching over 150 high-altitude balloons since then. The club formalized and grew significantly in the 2010s, launching its first CubeSat, ChargerSat-1, in 2013 as part of NASA's [https://www.nasa.gov/missions/small-satellite-missions/elana/ ELaNa] program aboard a Minotaur I rocket. The SHC \"One Month\" program was presented in March 2016 at an ASEE Conference located in San Francisco, CA\nEarly achievements included strong performances in competitions like the CanSat Competition and high-powered rocketry events. By the 2020s, SHC expanded into liquid propulsion (Tartarus project, started 2017), Mars rover challenges, and NASA-funded sounding rocket payloads. In 2022, the club sent its first payload to suborbital space in nearly a decade via NASA's RockOn/RockSat program. A subset group, TERMINUS Spaceflight Research Group (formed 2021), has focused on advanced tether deployment experiments for NASA launches.\nThe club has no membership dues and covers most project costs, including travel, through grants—making it uniquely accessible for propulsion and space hardware research at the undergraduate level.\nAchievements\n* Competitions: Multiple top placements in International CanSat Competition (e.g., strong 2023 finishes with young teams); 18th internationally/8th nationally in 2023 University Rover Challenge; 1st in U.S./2nd overall in earlier CanSat events; AIAA regional awards (2017).\n* Spaceflights: ChargerSat-1 (2013 orbital CubeSat); Multiple suborbital payloads (2022, 2024 via NASA RockSat); High-altitude balloons for atmospheric research.\n* Research/Outreach: HELEN gamma-ray detector; ARISS ISS contacts; NASA-funded anti-coincidence shields for X-ray telescopes; STEM education for thousands of K-12 students.\nProjects\nThe Space Hardware Club supports many projects for its members.\nLiquid Rocketry\nTartarus, the liquid rocketry project of the Space Hardware Club at UAH, is a longstanding project of the club. It published a paper on the design of a test stand for a bipropellant liquid rocketry test stand.\nCanSat Competition\nThe Space Hardware Club competes in the annual international [https://cansatcompetition.com/ CanSat Competition] sponsored by the American Astronautical Society (AAS) and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, regularly fielding multiple teams.  The table below lists all publicly covered top placements. Most notably in 2022, the club's teams placed 1st, 2nd and 3rd in the competition.  The club sends 1-3 CanSat's to the competition each year.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Team name(s)\n!International placement\n!National (U.S.) placement\n!Notes\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Ref(s)\n|-\n|2008\n|Unknown\n|— (of 40)\n|2nd (of 20)\n|Early national competition in Amarillo, Texas; soil-temperature mission\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Wind Charger,\nBlackout\n|3rd,\n7th\n|1st,\n2nd\n|Top U.S. team overall; both teams primarily freshmen/sophomores\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|GroundPounder,\nSunStreaker,\nSkyHammer\n|2nd,\n10th,\n11th\n|1st,\n6th,\n7th\n|67 registered teams; rare sky-facing stabilization achieved\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Spaceshot,\nStar Saber,\nHighwire\n|8th,\n13th,\n16th\n|1st,\n2nd,\n3rd\n|All-freshman/sophomore teams; first CanSat experience for most members\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|Obsidian,\nFull Tilt,\nAfterburner\n|1st,\n5th,\n6th\n|1st,\n2nd,\n3rd\n|Freshman/sophomore-heavy teams outperformed most senior/graduate teams\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|Shockwave,\nSnapdragon,\nMoonRacer\n|2nd,\n—,\n—\n|1st,\n3rd,\n4th\n|Scored >98% in design reviews; competition held in Monterey, Virginia\n|\n|}\nUniversity Rover Challenge\nThe club's Mars rover team, known as ASTRA (Autonomous Space Technology for Robotic Applications), competes annually in the University Rover Challenge (URC), organized by The Mars Society and held at the Mars Desert Research Station in southern Utah.\nASTRA designs, builds, and operates a fully autonomous rover capable of performing extreme-terrain traversal, equipment servicing, science experimentation, and sample-return tasks. The team typically consists of 20–30 undergraduate students from multiple engineering disciplines and is part of the club's broader AutoSat Program.\nNotable results include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!International placement\n!U.S. placement\n!Notes\n|-\n|2023\n|18th (of 38)\n|8th\n|First appearance in several years; youngest team in the finals\n|-\n|2024\n|8th (of ~40)\n|5th\n|Significant redesign including a new robotic arm; competed against teams from Poland, Canada, India, and Egypt\n|}\nThe 2024 rover featured a six-wheeled rocker-bogie suspension, a five-degree-of-freedom manipulator arm, and autonomous navigation software. Funding for travel and components is provided through the Alabama Space Grant Consortium and private donations, with no membership fees required.\nCubeSat\nThe club's CubeSat project called Terminus sent a CubeSat to space on June 24, 2022 atop a Terrier OrionSounding Rocket.  The project was completely extra-curricular and designed completely by students.  The payload was approximately the size of a dinner plate with sensors like Accelerometers, Gyroscopes, a Geiger counter, temperature sensors, and more.\nOrganization and Funding\nSHC is advised by UAH faculty such as Dr. Gang Wang and Dr. Richard Tantaris. It receives support from the UAH College of Engineering, Alabama Space Grant Consortium, NASA, and donors. The club maintains labs in the UAH Engineering Building and accesses facilities like the Severe Weather Institute – Radar & Lightning Laboratories (SWIRLL).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.uah.edu/charger-union/organizations/space-hardware-club SHC listing] on UAH ChargerConnect\n* [https://cansatcompetition.com/ CanSat Competition] – annual international competition\n* [https://www.marsociety.org/university-rover-challenge/ University Rover Challenge] – Mars rover competition\n:Category:Education"
