It is given by the Governor of Indiana under their own criteria, and there is no official record kept of all previous recipients.\nThe award was first created by Governor Ralph F. Gates to compete with the Kentucky Colonel title, with the first two Sagamores being Robert A. Taft and Simeon Willis. The title was later given to those who had contributed to Indiana life: several recipients have been associated with Indiana University (IU), with former president Herman B Wells receiving the award six times. Other recipients have included astronauts (Gus Grissom), athletes (Michael Brinegar, Ray LeBlanc), comedians (David Letterman), musicians (Willie Nelson), and presidents (George H. W. Bush).\nAt least one fictional character has been the recipient of an award, being Garfield (creator Jim Davis received an award four years prior).\nRecipients\nAwarded under Ralph F.
