Traditional students are contrasted with non-traditional students.\nIn the United States, it is used to refer to undergraduate students under 25 years old who enroll directly from high school, attend full-time, and do not have major life and work responsibilities (e.g., full-time job or dependents). However these days around 75% of undergrads have at least 1 nontraditional characteristic.\nIt is frequently observed that traditional higher education programs and policies are geared toward, and the outcome of, the previous era when traditional students were the main market for higher education.\nReferences"
