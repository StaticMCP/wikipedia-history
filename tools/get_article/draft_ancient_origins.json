It is published by Stella Novus Ltd and has been in operation since at least 2011.\nThe platform was created with the aim of highlighting recent archaeological discoveries and peer-reviewed research, while also presenting alternative perspectives in science, archaeology, mythology, religion, and world history. Ancient Origins promotes itself as the only “Pop Archaeology” site that combines scientific research with out-of-the-box approaches.\nThe content covers explorations of ancient civilizations, investigations of historical sites, analysis of artifacts, myths, legends, and mysterious events from antiquity that remain unresolved. Beyond articles, it also offers an image gallery, a digital magazine titled Ancient Origins Magazine, a premium edition with exclusive content, history tours, and e-book packages for its members.\nAncient Origins is published by Stella Novus Ltd, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. The team is led by co-founder and managing director Dr. Ioannis (John) Syrigos, who has a background in computer engineering and artificial intelligence and has personally explored sites such as Tayos Cave in Ecuador and Ciudad Perdida in Colombia. Other key figures include marketing, development, and editorial staff working on both the website and the magazine. Co-founder Joanna Gillan played a major role for ten years as co-owner and editor, writing articles that were cited by international media outlets such as The New York Times and The Guardian. The editorial board also includes numerous guest authors—researchers and academics in fields such as archaeology, anthropology, and biblical history—who contribute to the site's global coverage.\nThe platform extends beyond its website with Ancient Origins Magazine, a digital publication that features exclusive interviews, in-depth articles, puzzles, and traditional recipes. An Android mobile application also provides access to articles, premium features, e-books, webinars, and members-only content. The app has received a rating of around 4.4 with more than 50,000 downloads as of November 2024.\nAccording to Media Bias/Fact Check, Ancient Origins has positioned itself since 2011 as a platform reporting on ancient history and human development. However, the site has not been without criticism. A discussion in the subreddit r/AskAnthropology argued that most of its articles are reposted material with commercial intent, while a smaller portion was described as pseudoscience, blending legitimate research with unfounded speculation.\nReferences"
