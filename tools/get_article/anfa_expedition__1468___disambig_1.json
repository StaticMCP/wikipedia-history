It imported fine silk clothes, gold and silver currency from Granada, and featured a high number of merchants and noble residences. According to Leo Africanus, ships departed from its harbour to raid the coasts of the Iberian peninsula.\nWishing to distinguish himself through a feat of arms, Duke Ferdinand of Beja and of Viseu, heir of Prince Henry the Navigator, Duke of Beja and of Viseu and governor of both the Order of Santiago and Order of Christ, accepted to fulfill the desire of King Afonso V to destroy the city and neutralize the threat it posed. Duke Ferdinand was experienced in the African theater, and had already previously distinguished himself fighting at Alcácer Ceguer and Tangier.\nBefore attacking the city, Duke Fernando dispatched a fidalgo of his houselhold, knight of Santiago and alcaide-mor of Sines Estevão da Gama (father of Vasco da Gama) to spy the city disguised as a fig merchant. Gama duly fulfilled his mission, observing the defenses of the city as he sold a cargo of figs from Algarve across the city. The exact numbers involved in the expedition are not known but may have involved as many as 10 000 men and about 50 ships.\nAs the Portuguese fleet approached the city, the inhabitants evacuated it and fled to Rabat and Salé. The city was then sacked and almost completely demolished by the Portuguese army, some sources stating the Portuguese encountered little resistance, others none at all. In the words of Leo Africanus:\nAnfa remained abandoned for three centuries. The region of Anfa would again be attacked by the Portuguese in 1487.\nSee also\n*Portuguese conquest of Ceuta\n*Conquest of Asilah\n*Portuguese Asilah\n*Portuguese Tangier\nReferences"
