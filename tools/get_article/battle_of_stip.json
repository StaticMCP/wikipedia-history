The battle ended in victory for the Austrians, the Ottomans suffered heavy losses of about 2,000 dead, and were forced to retreat.\nBackground\nAfter setting Skopje on fire, the Austrians continued to make breakthroughs deep into Macedonia, whose task was to observe the area in order to prevent and disrupt the concentration of enemy forces. One such breakthrough was made by Prince Johann George von Holstein, who took command of Enea Silvio Piccolomini's troops after he died of cholera.\nBattle\nLearning that the Turkish army had concentrated in Štip, he decided to smash it and drive it out of the city with a swift attack. Leaving their camp near the Kumanovo village of Orizari, Johan Georg von Holstein's Austrian troops arrived in Štip at dawn on November 10, 1689. This was the fiercest and largest clash between the Austrian and Ottoman armies on Macedonian territory. The battle ended in a convincing victory for the Habsburg monarchy.\nThe Ottomans were completely smashed. Leaving behind some 2,000 dead, they were forced to retreat. The Austrians set the city on fire and returned to Kosovo, carrying a substantial cargo of several thousand barrels of goods. Returning, they smashed another Turkish reconnaissance unit of 300 men.\nAftermath\nAfter two years, in 1691, the city was reconquered by the Ottomans. The city suffered severe damage. Due to the destruction, Štip could not recover until the 19th century.\nSee also\n* Skopje fire of 1689\n* Great Turkish War\n* Enea Silvio Piccolomini\nReferences\nSources\n* [https://eprints.ugd.edu.mk/23133/1/18-Shtit%20za%20UGD.pdf eprints.ugd.edu.mk]\n* [https://stip.gov.mk/istorija-na-gradot/ History of the city – Municipality of Stip]\n* Municipality of Stip, STIP - TOURIST INFORMANT, With map of the city.
