She married Suro and bore him nine sons. Two of them kept her surname and became the forefathers of a Heo lineage. Her tomb is a tumulus that is  high. There are various buildings and stone monuments surrounding the tomb. The tomb's area was enlarged in 1446, during the reign of Sejong the Great. The tomb was robbed by the Japanese during the 1592–1598 Imjin War. It was repaired in 1641.
