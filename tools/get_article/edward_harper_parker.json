On his return to England he ended his career as a university professor.\nBiography\nHe was educated at the Royal Institution School, Liverpool, and became a barrister of the Middle Temple. He intended to engage in the tea trade, studied Chinese, and from 1869 to 1871, in the character of student interpreter, he traveled in Mongolia, and afterwards served at the British consulates in Wenzhou, Fuzan, and Shanghai, and traveled in Oceania, Eastern Asia, and North America. He retired from the consular service in 1895, became reader in Chinese at University College, Liverpool, in 1896, and in 1901 was appointed to a chair in Chinese at Owens College, Manchester. This chair was part-time and he held it until his death.\nIntellectual contributions\nIn his day, he was well known as a popular interpreter of current and historical events. But his greatest contribution historically may turn out to be an unusual outlook on colloquial Chinese language. He identified, most significantly, \"characterless words\" in Cantonese and Hakka, among other dialect groups. Chinese historical linguistics, as practiced both natively and among Westerners, did not begin taking these words seriously until almost the present day.\nWorks\n* Comparative Chinese Family Law (1879)\n* [https://archive.org/details/chineseaccountof00parkrich Chinese Account of the Opium War (1888)]\n* ''China's Relations with Foreigners (1888)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=HQbVAAAAMAAJ Up the Yangtsze (1892)]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8G1AAAAIAAJ Burma (1893)]\n* [https://archive.org/details/athousandyearst01parkgoog A Thousand Years of the Tartars (1895)] [https://books.google.com/books?id=qykPAAAAYAAJ]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=k8BCAAAAIAAJ The life, labours and doctrines of Confucius (1897)]\n* China (1901)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=eF9HAAAAYAAJ John Chinaman (1901)]\n* [https://archive.org/details/chinapastandpre01parkgoog China, Past and Present (1903)]\n* [https://archive.org/details/chinaandreligio01parkgoog China and Religion (1905)]\n* [https://archive.org/details/ancientchinasim00parkgoog Ancient China Simplified (1908)] [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6624] [http://www.authorama.com/ancient-china-simplified-1.html] [https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Ancient-China-Simplified1/] [https://archive.org/stream/ancientchinasimp00park/ancientchinasimp00park_djvu.txt]\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000399523 Studies in Chinese Religion] (1910)\n* [https://archive.org/details/chinaherhistory01parkgoog China, her history, diplomacy, and commerce: from the earliest times to the present day'' (1917)][https://archive.org/details/chinaherhistory02parkgoog] [https://books.google.com/books?id=8LM2AAAAMAAJ]\nReferences\n;Attribution\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
