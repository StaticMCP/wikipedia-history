After delay by the First World War, construction was completed in 1921. Although at  of water it was smaller than the other royals, it had its own entrance from the Thames through a lock and bascule bridge. The dock could berth liners as large as the .  At its western end was a large graving dock (since filled in) and machine shop used for ship repairs by Harland & Wolff. From the 1960s onwards, the King George V Dock experienced a steady decline – as did all of London's other docks – as the shipping industry adopted containerisation, which effectively moved traffic downstream to Tilbury. It finally closed to commercial traffic along with the other Royal Docks in 1981.\nRedevelopment in the late 20th century included the construction of London City Airport which was built on the north bank of the dock with a single runway and completed in 1987. King George V station on the London City Airport branch of the Docklands Light Railway, which opened in December 2005, is named after the dock.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
