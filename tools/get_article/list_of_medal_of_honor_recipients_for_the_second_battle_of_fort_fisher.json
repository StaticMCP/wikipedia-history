Sometimes referred to as the \"Gibraltar of the South\" and the last major coastal stronghold of the Confederacy, Fort Fisher had tremendous strategic value during the war.  The Medal of Honor was awarded to 54 Union servicemen for their actions during this battle.\nThe Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously.\nRecipients\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n! Name\n! Service\n! Rank\n! Date of action\n!
