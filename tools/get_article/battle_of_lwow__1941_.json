On 24 June the 1st company of the regiment prevented the mass escape from Lvov Prison No. 1. Also, the soldiers of the regiment defended the city from the actions of looters, OUN members and Nazi saboteurs. From 29 to 30 June 1941 the regiment’s battalion covered the withdrawal of units of the 6th army from Lviv and then departed along the route -Bóbrka-Rohatyn-Kozova-Tarnopol under the direct influence of the Luftwaffe.\nImmediately after the departure of the Red Army, NKVD troops and border guards, the massacre of Lviv professors and Lviv pogrom was organized, and then the ghetto and concentration camps began to form under the leadership of the German administration by the Ukrainian auxiliary police, formed from the OUN marching groups.\nThe city was liberated from the Nazis three years later, in the summer of 1944, during the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive.\nSee also\n* Lwów Ghetto\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germans-capture-lvov-and-slaughter-ensues Germans capture Lvov—and slaughter ensues]\n* [http://mil.ru/winner_may/history/more.htm?id=10638542 The initial period of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945]"
