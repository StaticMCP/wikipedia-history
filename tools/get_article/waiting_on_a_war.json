It was released as the third single off of their tenth album Medicine at Midnight.\nBackground\nThe song was first released on January 14, 2021, as the third single from their tenth studio album, Medicine at Midnight, after \"Shame Shame\" and \"No Son of Mine\". The date was chosen to celebrate frontman Dave Grohl's 52nd birthday. The band debuted the song live on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on the same date.\nComposition and lyrics\n\"Waiting on a War\" is an \"aching\" folk rock ballad, that starts as acoustic pop rock, but transitions into 1970s hard rock on the outro. Most of the song is composed primarily of Grohl singing over an acoustic guitar, bass, and drums, and strings, before building in intensity in its second half, and moving into an energetic, full-band rock sound with electric guitars for the last minute. The song was noted to have a more traditional Foo Fighters sound than prior singles from the album.\nLyrically, the song was described as the Foo Fighters' modern approach to a \"Give Peace a Chance\" type song, with Grohl pondering the possibility of a dark future. The lyrical content was inspired by bleak conversation Grohl had had with his own daughter Harper Grohl, in 2019, which reminded him of his own worries about the world:  Grohl later explained that he himself had feared the effect of the Cold War while growing up in Washington DC. Upon the completion of the song, Grohl felt it was one of the best songs the band had ever written.\nMusic video\nA music video directed by Paola Kudacki was released for the song on January 19, 2021. It features the band performing mixed with cinematic shots of young people whose carefree outlook on life is threatened by ominous-looking adults who have brown paper bags over their heads.\nReception\nRolling Stone singled the song out as the standout track on Medicine at Midnight.\nPersonnel\nFoo Fighters\n* Dave Grohl – lead vocals, acoustic guitar, production\n* Taylor Hawkins – drums, production\n* Rami Jaffee – keyboards, production\n* Nate Mendel – bass guitar, production\n* Chris Shiflett – guitar, production\n* Pat Smear – guitar, production\nAdditional Personnel\n* Omar Hakim - percussion\n* Greg Kurstin – production\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Waiting on a War\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2021)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia Digital Tracks (ARIA)\n| 33\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Czech Republic Modern Rock (IFPI)\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Iceland (RÚV)\n| 11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard Japan)\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Switzerland Airplay (Schweizer Hitparade)\n| 98\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Year-end chart performance for \"Waiting on a War\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2021)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard)\n| 79\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Rock Airplay (Billboard)\n| 9\n|}\nAwards\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Award\n!Results\n|-\n|2022\n|Grammy Award for Best Rock Song\n|\n|}\nReferences"
