He was educated at a private school in Greenwich, and then at Exeter grammar school. At age 20 he returned to Calcutta.\nAfter working as a journalist for some years, Watts went to Australia in search of an elder brother who had gone to the gold-diggings. After an unsuccessful venture in mining, he joined the staff of the Melbourne Argus, and became its editor in 1859.\nBack in England, Watts worked for a short-lived Liberal newspaper at York, where he contracted smallpox. He moved on to London, and around 1868 joined the Standard, acting as leader-writer and sub-editor in the colonial and literary departments. At this period he was also home correspondent for the Melbourne Argus.\nWatts occupied rooms in Pall Mall before settling at 52 Bedford Gardens, Campden Hill. He was an original member of the Savile Club, and visited Spain with his friend Carlisle Macartney. Unmarried, he died of cancer on 7 November 1904.\nWorks\nWatts is best known for his translation of Don Quixote (1888; revised edit. 1895), begun in collaboration with Alexander James Duffield. The first edition contained \"a new life\" of Miguel de Cervantes, whom he idealised, which was expanded and issued separately in 1895.\nHe also wrote the biographical sketch Life of Miguel de Cervantes for the \"Great Writers series\" (1891), an essay on Francisco de Quevedo for an English edition of Pablo de Segovia, illustrated by Daniel Vierge (1892), and Spain (1893) for the \"Story of the Nations\" series.\nHe was a contributor to the Westminster Review, Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Blackwood's Magazine,Fraser's Magazine, Saturday Review, and St. James's Gazette''.\nNotes\nAttribution"
