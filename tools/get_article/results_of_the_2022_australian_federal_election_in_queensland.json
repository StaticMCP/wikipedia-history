Queensland is a conservative state federally (despite having an incumbent Labor government) and Labor has only won Queensland's two-party-preferred vote in three of the 21 federal elections since 1949: 1951, 1990 and 2007. In 2007, the Labor Party had a leader from Queensland, Kevin Rudd. Labor did, however, increase both its first-preference vote and its two-party-preferred vote statewide.\nWhile the LNP's primary vote decreased and Labor's slightly increased, Labor still had a lower primary vote in Queensland than any other state or territory except Tasmania.\nThe fact that the Coalition won more seats in Queensland than Labor is due to the fact that Queensland, unlike most other states, has more people outside its state capital (Brisbane) than inside it, despite Brisbane being by far the largest city in Queensland. The Coalition is dominant in regional Australia (particularly regional New South Wales and Queensland) and the outer-suburbs, while Labor is dominant in the inner-city.\nDespite Queensland being generally more conservative than other states, the Greens managed to win three inner-city seats in Brisbane: two from the LNP (Brisbane and Ryan) and one from Labor (Griffith). However, these were the only seats that changed hands. Notably, there were also no teal independents that ran in any Queensland seats, unlike most other states (i.e New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory).\nRegional Queensland on the other hand remained unchanged. The LNP still holds every Queensland seat outside Brisbane except Kennedy, which is held by Bob Katter, the founder of the conservative Katter's Australian Party (KAP).\nOne Nation's vote, although decreased since the last election, was slightly higher than it was at the 2020 Queensland state election, at 7.49%.\nReferences"
