As a vocalist, he is known for his powerful and wide-ranging countertenor singing voice, in particular his far-reaching falsetto screams. He is the lead vocalist and lyricist for both Mercyful Fate and the eponymous King Diamond. He also plays keyboards and guitars on studio recordings but uses live shows to focus solely on his vocal performance. Diamond is renowned for his dark lyrical content and his story concepts. He is also known for his distinctive shock stage persona (in particular his black and white facepaint). He has been an influence for other rock and metal artists, including Metallica, Slayer and Cradle of Filth.\nCareer\nEarly days\nKing Diamond's first heavy rock band was called Brainstorm (1974–76), with Jeanette Blum (Jean Blue) on vocals and bass, Michael Frohn (Mike West) on guitar and Jes Jacobsen (Jesse James) on drums. Diamond left Brainstorm and began singing with local Danish hard rock band Black Rose. He began experimenting with horror-themed theatrics and shaping a malevolent quasi-Satanic stage persona. He left Black Rose and joined the punk-metal band Brats, where he met Hank Shermann. The two were soon asked to help Michael Denner (also formerly a member of Brats) with his own project, Danger Zone. This band included Timi Hansen, and the musicians would join with Diamond in 1980 to become Mercyful Fate.\nMercyful Fate\nFollowing Mercyful Fate's 1984 release of ''Don't Break the Oath'' and the subsequent tour (which saw them play in the U.S. for the first time), Diamond split ways with Mercyful Fate. With him, he took two of his bandmates (Hansen and Denner) to pursue a solo career under his own name.\nMercyful Fate reunited in 1992 (while Diamond simultaneously continued his solo career) and recorded five more studio albums. In 1999, Diamond and Hank Shermann performed the song \"Evil\" live with Metallica. This performance also featured Diamond without his famous makeup.\nIn 2000, Diamond decided to put Mercyful Fate on hold and continue on with his solo career.\nOn 1 August 2019 Mercyful Fate announced a reunion and an accompanying European tour. Then 3 years later on June 2, 2022, Mercyful Fate performed their first live show since 1999 in Hanover as part of a European tour, where they debuted a brand new song titled \"The Jackal of Salzbur.\" King Diamond also confirmed that the band was actively working on a new album. However in January of 2025 the bands Bass player Becky Baldwin stated that the new Mercyful Fate album was not expected to be released before 2025, due to King Diamond's focus on his namesake band's upcoming thirteenth studio album.\nKing Diamond\nAfter Mercyful Fate broke up, King Diamond, along with Michael Denner and Timi Hansen, formed the eponymous King Diamond band in 1985. Fatal Portrait, the band's first full-length studio album, was released on 14 March 1986, through Roadrunner Records. Their second album Abigail, was released on 29 May 1987 was the first concept album based on an original story by Diamond. Following some line up changes another concept album, \"Them\" charted at number 38 on the Swedish album chart, number 65 on the Dutch album chart, and at number 89 on the Billboard 200, making it King Diamond's highest charting album in the U.S. to date. Diamonds album a continuation of the storyline from \"Them\", Conspiracy was the first King Diamond album to be recorded in the United States and was released in 1989. The next album The Eye was released the following year in 1990, however King Diamond reunited with Mercyful Fate in 1992 where he would then balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 1990s. After recording and touring with Mercyful Fate, King Diamond reformed his eponymous band in 1994. Released on 1 October 1996, The Graveyard saw King Diamond return to writing concept albums this was then followed by 1998Voodoo. Then when Mercyful Fate was put on hold in 1999, King Diamond began recording the album House of God at the Nomad Recording Studio in Carrollton, Texas.\nIn 2001, King Diamond worked out a deal with the band Usurper to sing backup vocals on the song \"Necronemesis\" in exchange for them shifting their recording schedule around to accommodate the recording of Abigail II: The Revenge. In 2003 King Diamond released their eleventh album The Puppet Master, the album also featured additional vocals from Diamond's wife Livia Zita. In 2004, Diamond contributed vocals to \"Sweet Dreams\", the final track on the album of Dave Grohl's heavy metal side project Probot. In late 2005, Diamond appeared on the Roadrunner United – The All-Star Sessions album, contributing vocals for his song \"In the Fire\", which featured multiple Roadrunner Records musicians (past and present) working together to create individual songs. Diamond also guested on the Cradle of Filth song \"Devil Woman\" in late 2005.\nIn April 2006, Diamond reunited with Mikkey Dee (Motörhead drummer) at a sold-out gig at Kåren in Gothenburg, Sweden. In 2001 he referred to Dee as \"one of the best drummers of all time and that's something that has bothered us since he left.\"\nDiamond released his album Give Me Your Soul... Please, on 26 June 2007. The band received a Grammy nomination in the \"Best Metal Performance\" category for the track \"Never Ending Hill\".\nHe was forced to cancel a United States tour due to a herniated disk, causing severe back pain, which puts him in intense pain almost all of the time. He attributes the problem to the long stressful hours spent working on the album.\nDiamond made an appearance at Ozzfest on 9 August 2008 at Frisco, Texas alongside Metallica, performing a medley of Mercyful Fate songs previously released on Metallica's Garage Inc. album. He also performed a cover of the Pantera song \"A New Level\" with Vinnie Paul, Scott Ian, Max Cavalera, and Nick Bowcott.\nIn 2009, Diamond was revealed to be a playable character for the rhythm game Guitar Hero: Metallica, appearing with Mercyful Fate's song \"Evil\". The player must complete the song on any instrument and any difficulty to unlock the character.\nOn 29 November 2010, Diamond was taken to the hospital, where doctors discovered several blockages in his arteries due to his heavy smoking habit. They determined that he had had several heart attacks and that he needed triple-bypass surgery, during which time he was medically dead for five hours. The surgery was performed successfully and on 11 December 2010 it was announced that he was at home recovering. All his musical projects were placed on hold.\nOn 7 December 2011, Diamond appeared on stage with Metallica at the Fillmore in San Francisco to celebrate Metallica's 30th anniversary.\nIn June 2012, Diamond performed his comeback concert at Sweden Rock Festival.\nOn Saturday 8 September 2012, Diamond appeared along with Mark Tremonti on VH1 Classic's That Metal Show discussing his surgery and various details about upcoming events.\nHe appeared on Volbeat's 2013 album, Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies, providing guest vocals on the track \"Room 24\". This collaboration resulted in another Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. In August 2013 Diamond performed at Open Air Bloodstock Festival, UK.\nSlayer was chosen to headline the 2015 Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival. The bands HELLYEAH, King Diamond, The Devil Wears Prada, Thy Art Is Murder, Jungle Rot, Sister Sin, Sworn In, Shattered Sun, Feed Her To The Sharks, Code Orange and Kissing Candice also participated in the Rockstar Tour.\nIn 2018, King Diamond began work on its thirteenth studio album, which would be divided into two parts to connect with its theme. The first part of the series was later revealed to be titled The Institute; the title has since been changed to ''Saint Lucifer's Hospital 1920. Originally intended for release in 2020, it faced multiple delays before its planned release in 2026. This delay was in part due to Diamond taking his time on perfecting new material by both the King Diamond band and the reunited Mercyful Fate.\nIn November of 2025 Diamond was honored by the Danish Arts Foundation and was given the lifetime honour for his \"very special efforts and contributions to Danish art and cultural life.\" In addition Diamond will receive a yearly 189,000 Danish Krona (about $26,000) grant from the foundation for the rest of his life.\nOther media\nDiamond was a special celebrity guest star in four episodes of the Warner Bros. adult-oriented cartoon Metalocalypse as the Blues Devil, Ronald von Moldenberg, a fast food manager, and one of the Klokateers in 2006 on Adult Swim.\nArtistry\nDiamond is known for his falsetto singing voice. He is known for creating conceptual works that feature recurring stories that include the supernatural, horror, fate and death. His lyrics have been described as a \"gothic horror romance in metal form, delivered with technical precision and theatrical grandeur.\" Diamond has stated he has loved of horror films since his youth when he would watch Frankenstein and Dracula'' with his parents; these films have also played a part in his lyrical style. Diamond said that when he first joined Mercyful Fate, he lived in a apartment that \"turned out to be truly haunted.\" He stated in a interview with Blabbermouth.net: \"Many of the things that are written in the lyrics have been taken straight as they happened from these real experiences.\" In that same interview, he stated that a lot of his lyrics are drawn from real life, but some come from his imagination: \"To make a story flow, you change some of the things that you've experienced. When an album is done and I read through all the lyrics, I get a little uneasy when I see how much of myself I've put into the stories. But then again, I know that no one's going to know unless I tell them exactly what's what, and I'm certainly not going to do that. But it's drawn from everywhere.\"\nDiamond cites Arthur Brown, David Byron, Alice Cooper, Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan, Ozzy Osbourne and Robert Plant as his primary influences. According to Diamond's biography on his official website, the first two albums he bought were Deep Purple's Fireball and Black Sabbath's Master of Reality.\nStage presence\nOn stage, Diamond uses a microphone stand consisting of a femur bone and a tibia bone in the shape of a cross. He previously used a human skull, called Melissa, on stage. In the mid-1980s Melissa was stolen after a performance in the Netherlands. Diamond is also known for his Corpse paint and has changed the design of his make-up often over the years. With Conspiracy, he wore a mesh of black and white line war paint, with some red \"blood\" made to look like a wound coming out of his forehead. With his album The Puppet Master, he used very little white and mainly had black crosses and inverted crosses going up and down his face. Diamond is also known for his onstage performance Brave Worlds described his stage presence stating \"On stage, he transforms the concert into a dark theatre – a ritual where gothic tales, horrific characters and symbolic scenography merge. His distinctive \"corpsepaint\" and his microphone holder, an inverted cross made of human bones, make him an iconic figure.\"\nPersonal life\nDiamond is married to Livia Zita, a Hungarian-born singer who has made appearances as a backup vocalist on the albums The Puppet Master and Give Me Your Soul...Please, as well as during live performances. She is also his business partner, and is currently working with him to compile old footage for two planned DVD releases of King Diamond and Mercyful Fate live performances. She also helped him make remastered editions of the King Diamond albums ''The Spider's Lullabye, The Graveyard, Voodoo and House of God. In 2017, they became parents to a son, Byron, born in March. In a 2016 interview with Metal Hammer'' Diamond revealed that following his health scare he has given up smoking and started living a healthier life style, which he has credited to helping improve his singing voice. Some of Diamonds interest include Formula One and Football, growing up he played for the youth squad of Danish club called Hvidovre IF but he stopped playing once he went to college and started getting involved in music.\nDiamond follows LaVeyan Satanism, which he does not see as a religion, but a philosophy by which he lived even before reading occultist Anton LaVey's The Satanic Bible. Michael Moynihan calls him \"one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic Metal who was more than just a poseur using a devilish image for shock value\". Diamond has expressed concern that religion has led so many people to kill and destroy each other. He stated that he cannot comprehend why religion has caused so much death and destruction when it is logically impossible to prove the presence or absence of any deity. He states that he has reached a point in his life where he has completely given up believing in anything religious.\nLegacy\nMetallica released an 11-minute medley of five Mercyful Fate songs on their 1998 Garage Inc. cover album.
