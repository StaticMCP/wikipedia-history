It emerged during the later stages of a major revolt against Spanish rule that had begun in July 1647, initially led by figures such as Masaniello and Giulio Genoino against the administration of King Philip IV of Spain and his viceroy, the Duke of Arcos.\nAfter the Republic's proclamation, Henry II of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, arrived in November 1647 and became its most prominent leader, eventually styled as Doge. He partly based his claim to leadership on his descent from the former King of Naples, René I of Anjou.\nReflecting its complex political identity, the Republic was known by several names, including  (\"Royal Republic\") and  (\"Most Serene Republic of this Kingdom of Naples\"). The title \"Serenissima\" was likely adopted in conscious comparison to the Republic of Venice. The Republic's coat of arms featured a red shield displaying the motto S.P.Q.N. (), in imitation of the Roman motto S.P.Q.R. (, \"The Senate and the People of Rome\"); thus, the Neapolitan phrase meant \"The Senate and People of Naples\". During the Duke of Guise's leadership, his personal coat of arms was sometimes displayed in conjunction with the Republic's shield.\nHistory\n. Museo di San Martino.]]\nSince 1504, the Kingdom of Naples had been ruled by the Spanish monarchy, initially through the Crown of Aragon, via appointed viceroys. During the first half of the 17th century, Naples experienced a severe economic crisis, part of a broader downturn affecting much of Europe. This crisis in Naples was exacerbated by a viceregal government largely indifferent to local welfare, primarily focused on financing the series of continent-wide wars Spain was engaged in.\nAlthough the forces of Viceroy Don Rodrigo Ponce de León, Duke of Arcos, had suppressed Masaniello's revolt (July 1647) and restored order in most of the city, strong discontent remained. When a fleet led by John of Austria the Younger, an illegitimate son of King Philip IV of Spain, arrived and bombarded the city in October 1647—ostensibly \"to soothe the last insurgents\"—a new revolt erupted. This phase of the revolt was not merely an uprising of the  (Neapolitan commoners) against the ruling elite; led by the gunsmith Gennaro Annese, it took on a distinctly anti-Spanish character, aimed squarely against Philip IV's rule.\nThe rebels expelled the viceroy's forces, and on October 22, 1647, Gennaro Annese proclaimed the Neapolitan Republic. The Republic's leaders sought French support and invited Henri II de Lorraine, Duke of Guise, to lead the new state. The Duke of Guise, who was in Rome at the time, accepted the offer, driven by personal ambition, his family's historical claims to Naples, and the desire to reinstate French influence in southern Italy, which had been absent for roughly two centuries. On November 15, 1647, Guise landed in Naples and assumed leadership of the Republic.\nFrom its inception, the Neapolitan Republic faced formidable challenges. Spanish forces held the strategic castles overlooking the city, while loyalist city and the nobility dominated the provinces from their base in Aversa, thereby controlling Naples' crucial supply lines. Although the Duke of Guise managed to capture Aversa in early 1648, this victory did little to improve the Republic's strategic position or secure its supply lines. Meanwhile, Philip IV's forces, commanded again by John of Austria and later the Count of Oñate, pursued a strategy combining military containment with the deployment of spies and agents within Naples to exploit internal divisions and encourage defections among the rebels.\nOn April 5, 1648, the Duke of Guise, reportedly betrayed by counsellors in the pay of Philip IV, attempted a military sortie. The attempt failed, leading to Guise's capture and the swift collapse of the city's remaining defenses; Spanish forces re-entered Naples, effectively ending the Republic. Gennaro Annese, the former rebel leader, was subsequently arrested and executed on June 20, 1648, in Naples' Piazza del Mercato.\nOn June 4, 1648, a French fleet of approximately 40 ships hoping to reignite the rebellion appeared, but the exhausted Neapolitan populace did not rise against the restored Spanish control. An attempted French landing on the nearby island of Procida was repulsed by Spanish forces which forced the fleet to withdraw. A second, more powerful French fleet, commanded by Thomas of Savoy, arrived in the Gulf of Naples on August 4, 1648. This expedition succeeded in capturing Procida. However, after Spanish naval forces repelled French actions near Ischia, Pozzuoli, and Salerno, the fleet abandoned hope of taking Naples and departed.\nOn June 3, 1649, further riots broke out in Naples, but they were quickly suppressed by Spanish authorities, aided by the population's general weariness with conflict.\nSee also\n* Neapolitan Revolt of 1647\n* History of Naples\n* List of Neapolitan viceroys\nReferences"
