It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) at least once every five years by the first-past-the-post electoral system.\nFurther to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. Subject to boundary changes including the addition of the community of Cottingham, as a consequence, it was replaced by Kingston upon Hull North and Cottingham, first contested in the 2024 general election.\nBoundaries\n|frame=yes|text=Map of boundaries 2010-2024}}\n1950–1955: The County Borough of Hull wards of Beverley, Newland, Park, and University.\n1955–1974: The County Borough of Hull wards of Beverley, Botanic, Newland, Paragon, Park, University, and West Central.\n1983–2010:  The City of Hull wards of Avenue, Beverley, Newland, Noddle Hill, Orchard Park, Stoneferry, and University.\n2010–2024:  The City of Hull wards of Avenue, Beverley, Bransholme East, Bransholme West, Bricknell, Kings Park, Newland, Orchard Park and Greenwood, and University.\nConstituency profile\nThis constituency covered the northern part of Hull.
