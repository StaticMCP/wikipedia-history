The first job titles to appear were from the era of the First Egyptian Dynasty, shortly after the invention of writing.\nDetails\nTitles and jobs continued until the Roman period, and each person of high rank was interested in mentioning the titles and jobs that he performed during his life in his tomb, usually on a stone plaque placed in or in front of his tomb. That is why many ancient Egyptian titles are recorded on monuments, temples, and statues. They indicate the job or jobs of their owner.\nJobs diversified and multiplied with the development of ancient Egyptian civilization, indicating the development of the governmental system and administrative systems in Egypt since ancient times. Titles indicate official jobs in the state and the work that a person performed during his life. They were a source of pride in life, and to ensure resurrection and access to eternal life after death.\nList\nA list gives several important governmental positions in ancient Egypt in alphabetical order. We know of several thousand of these titles, but some are mentioned only once, and a few are mentioned several times. and these are the ones we present in this list. These titles were of great importance in the administration of the ancient Egyptian state and they explain to us the social structure in ancient Egypt and the system of government and its change over time.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%; border: 2px solid gray;\"\n|-\n!
