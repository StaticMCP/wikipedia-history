Hội Phục Việt changed its name several times and eventually changed to Tân Việt Revolutionary Party (July 1928).\nTân Việt Revolutionary Party gathered young intellectuals and patriotic petty bourgeois youth, operating mainly in Annam. Born and operating while the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League was thriving, the theories of Marxism–Leninism had a great influence, Tân Việt Revolutionary Party attracted a lot of patriotic young people to participate.\nDuring its operation, the party split into two left-wing and right-wing (nationalist) tendencies. In the end, the leftist tendency to embrace communism prevailed. Some members were transferred to study at the Revolutionary Youth League (founded in November 1925, led by Hồ Chí Minh), actively preparing for the establishment of a new party following the path of the Communist Party of Vietnam.\nInternal factional conflict weakened the party. In 1929 the communists broke away, reforming as the Indochinese Communist League (Đông Dương Cộng sản Liên đoàn) which was one of the three communist groups of 1929-1930 which formed the base of the Vietnamese Communist Party. The rest of the party was dissolved in 1930, after a police crackdown banned it.\nSee also\n* Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League\n* Indochinese Communist League\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
