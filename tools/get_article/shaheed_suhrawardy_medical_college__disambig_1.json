However, on 1 June 2009, the name of the medical college was changed to Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College.\nCampus\nThere are separate hostels for boys and girls.

Despite the addition of new hostels, living conditions remain overcrowded.\nAcademics\nShaheed Suhrawardy Medical College is affiliated with the University of Dhaka.

Notable venues include:\n* Lecture Gallery 3 and Lecture Gallery 4, located on the second floor of the college building,\n* The Auditorium and Multipurpose Room on the fourth floor of the college building,\n* The Hospital Gallery on the fifth floor of the hospital building.\nMost departments also have their own classrooms, which vary in quality; some are well-furnished while others are simpler. These departmental classrooms are used for tutorial and practical classes.\nFrom the third year onward, students attend ward classes, OT classes, evening classes as part of their clinical training.\nStudents undergo regular assessment through daily item examinations up to the third phase. Some subjects include card finals and term final examinations, culminating in professional examinations at the end of each phase. Clinical subjects also include ward finals and block finals.\nIn addition, students participate in various academic tours, such as day tours, RFST (Residential Field Site Training), study tours, and rag tours, organized according to their phase and subjects.\nLibraries & Reading Rooms\nThere are two main libraries: one located on the first floor of the college building and the other on the fifth floor of the hospital building. The college library is open to all but access is primarily prioritized according to seniority. The hospital library serves as the intern library. Additionally, many departments maintain their own libraries for teaching staff and trainees.\nTwo reading rooms are available; however, both are reported to be in poor condition with respect to cleanliness and accommodation. The reading room on the first floor is primarily dedicated to senior students, including some who graduated in previous years, while the reading room on the second floor is open to all students.\nCafeteria & Canteen\n# The Hostel Cafeteria serves regular meals to students living in the hostels. There have been some complaints regarding food quality and staff attitude.\n# Tasty Treat, located on the ground floor of the college building, offers hygienic and quality food, although at a higher price.\n# Hospital Canteen 1 is situated on the ground floor of the hospital. It is open to all and provides reasonably priced meals. Since it serves patients and their families, it can be busy at times.\n# Hospital Canteen 2 is located on the fifth floor of the hospital and offers similar services to the ground floor canteen. It is also open to all.\nMosque\nThere are multiple mosques located on the campus. Notable examples include a mosque on the third floor of the college building, another on the first floor of the hospital building beside the canteen, and the prominent '''ShSMC Boys' Hostel Jame Masjid'''.\nThe ShSMC Boys' Hostel Jame Masjid stands as a testament to the determination of students and the generosity of donors, including some teachers and community members. Although its construction faced significant opposition from the authorities due to legal concerns, the mosque remains in place and has become even more prominent over time. Students continue to express their gratitude to several former leaders of political student groups who played a key role in raising funds and supporting the mosque's establishment.\nExtracurricular activities\nEach and every year the students celebrate the national days by performing cultural programme.
