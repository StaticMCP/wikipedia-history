NoE’s primary function is to work as an ambassador to businesses and therefore attract targeted inward investment to the North of England region.\nNoE provides a link between businesses considering European expansion or relocation and resources in North England. Once a company makes the decision to expand or relocate into North England, NoE’s function changes to be a bridge for that transition, working to connect new inward investment companies with the people, resources, funding and more to help minimize risk and increase profitability. Some of the planning services that NoE provides to potential inward investment companies include: industry trends analysis, recruitment and training assistance, matching skills provision to employer needs, site location assistance, legal/customs/taxation information, introductions to private funding, links to academia, as well as UK and region specific economic and market information.\nWith several offices located throughout the U.S. and Canada NoE targets specific industries that would benefit from the infrastructure in place in the UK.  These specific industries include:  Life Sciences [http://www.northengland.com/industries/1/Life-Sciences.php], Energy and Environment [http://www.northengland.com/industries/3/Energy-and-Environment.php], IT and Media [http://www.northengland.com/industries/5/IT-and-Media.php], Advanced Engineering [http://www.northengland.com/industries/2/Advanced-Engineering.php], and Professional Services [http://www.northengland.com/industries/4/Professional-Services.php].\nNoE was established under the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980045_en_1 Regional Development Agencies Act 1998], all of which were formally launched in eight English regions on 1 April 1999. It is funded from six Government departments:\n*Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform;\n*Department for Communities and Local Government;\n*Department for Culture, Media and Sport;\n*Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs;\n*Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills;\n*UK Trade & Investment\nEach RDA is led by a Chair and a Board of 15 people. The RDA Chairs meet regularly with each other and with Government ministers to advise on national policy. They provide a regional perspective informed by work on the ground with partners and by the extensive consultations they hold in the regions. RDAs help central government ensure that local conditions and local needs are fully taken into account when they draw up national policy.\nThe Region\nThe North England region encompasses the cities of Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Sunderland. The North is considered by many to be one of the most culturally dynamic regions in the UK, with an identity separate from that of the rest of England. The underlying structural changes occurring in the North England economy has been impressive. Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield and Liverpool have all outpaced UK national economic growth. The Northwest has a projected £111 billion economy (the 12th largest in Europe),while the Northeast's economy has an annual turnover of £4bn. Healthcare, life sciences, advanced engineering, business and financial services, multimedia and energy are all significant contributors to North England's economic infrastructure. Some of the Region's Top Industries include: Life Sciences [http://www.northengland.com/industries/1/Life-Sciences.php], Energy and Environment [http://www.northengland.com/industries/3/Energy-and-Environment.php], IT and Media [http://www.northengland.com/industries/5/IT-and-Media.php], Advanced Engineering [http://www.northengland.com/industries/2/Advanced-Engineering.php], and Professional Services [http://www.northengland.com/industries/4/Professional-Services.php].\nBoard Members in the Region\nSimon Goon - Chairman\nPatrick Kendall- ONE Northeast\nSarah Kemp- NWDA\nJohn Cunliffe- NWDA\nKristen Hirst- NOE\nUniversities in the Region\nUniversity of Bradford\nUniversity of Huddersfield\nUniversity of Hull\nThe University of Law\nUniversity of Leeds\nLeeds Beckett University\nLeeds Trinity University\nUniversity of Sheffield\nSheffield Hallam University\nUniversity of York\nYork St John University\nNewcastle University[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/]\nNorthumbria University[http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/]\nDurham University[http://www.dur.ac.uk/]\nLancaster University[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/]\nLiverpool John Moores University[http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/]\nUniversity of Liverpool[http://www.liv.ac.uk/]\nUniversity of Salford[http://www.salford.ac.uk/]\nUniversity of Bolton[http://www.bolton.ac.uk/]\nUniversity of Cumbria[https://web.archive.org/web/20140922044314/http://www.cumbria.ac.uk/Home.aspx]\nUniversity of Sunderland[http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/]\nUniversity of Manchester[http://www.manchester.ac.uk/]\nInward Investment and North England\nInward investment is the injection of money from an external source into a region, in order to purchase capital goods for a branch of a corporation to locate or develop its presence in the region. Foreign firms are a catalyst for better economic performance. For one thing, they invest more, employ more skilled people and are more productive. Careful consideration should be given to the costs and benefits of attracting inward investors. When locating a business, inward investors seek:\n*A stable macro-economic climate\n*stable political and regulatory environment\n*Market access and open competition\n*A welcoming environment\n*Available sites and/or premises\n*Appropriate, available and reliable utilities and transportation\n*Available skilled workforce\n*Available local suppliers and resources\n*Appropriate education, training and research facilities\n*A good quality of life\n*Manageable regulation and taxation systems\n*Incentive schemes\nForeign firms continue to see the UK as an attractive place for business expansion or business relocation; it is the number one gateway to Europe giving easy access to the 27 member states of the European Union, the world's largest single market, with its population of nearly 500 million. The UK government recently reported that the United States remains the primary source for inward investment in the United Kingdom, accounting for 50 percent of all projects, followed by Germany, Canada, Japan, and France. According to UK Trade and Investment, (UKTI), more than 1,200 overseas companies chose to invest in the UK in 2007, making it the best year ever for inward investment. More than 45,000 new jobs were created last year by companies launching in the UK or expanding existing operations while 58,000 jobs were safeguarded, with US firms accounting for 30% of all new investments during the year.\nIn North England, energy and world-leading R&D, 4.7 million skilled employees, of which 1.7 million work in science and technology, and quality of life, including low cost of living, has made this region a logical choice for companies seeking to expand or relocate their operations overseas.
