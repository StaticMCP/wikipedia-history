Now a private residence, it is a Category C listed building, dating to around 1859. Its first proprietor was Mrs Urquhart.\nA building known as the Kirn Inn was on the site by 1837. The inn was renamed after the accession of Queen Victoria in that year, and it appears in the Valuation Roll for 1859 under its later name.\nThe hotel was expanded in 1904, the work carried out by Boston, Menzies and Morton.\nGallery\nFile:Ornate building at Kirn - geograph.org.uk - 838003.jpg|The building's northeastern corner, at Queen's Gardens\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB44187 KIRN, THE QUEEN'S HOTEL] - Historic Environment Scotland\n*[https://canmore.org.uk/site/232806/dunoon-marine-parade-the-queens-hotel Dunoon, Marine Parade, The Queen's Hotel] - Canmore.org.uk\n*[https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-baJq8B-p8mQ/Vi4JXuoewzI/AAAAAAACZ9g/TuD5LO2QiXE/s1600/Old%2BPhotograph%2BQueen%2527s%2BHotel%2BKirn%2BScotland.JPG A photo of the Queen's Hotel in its heyday]"
