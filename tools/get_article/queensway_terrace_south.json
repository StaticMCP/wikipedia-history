The borders are to the east Southwood Drive, to the south Baseline Road, Queensway (Highway 417) to the north and Greenbank Road to the west. Along with next-door Ridgeview, the neighbourhood is part of the Queensway Terrace South Ridgeview Community Association.\nThe community was established in the early 1960s along with Ridgeview, Parkway Park, Redwood and Qualicum.\nOn the west side of Pinecrest Road there are townhouses and a couple of high rise condominiums.\nIt is home to Pinecrest Public School and Pinecrest Shopping Centre.
