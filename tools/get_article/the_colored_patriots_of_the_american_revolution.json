It was published in 1855 by Robert F. Wallcut. It focuses on African-American soldiers during the American Revolution and the War of 1812.  It details \"the services of the Colored Patriots of the revolution\".\nAmong other patriots mentioned are Crispus Attucks, the first person killed in the Boston Massacre; Peter Salem, who was instrumental in the victory at Bunker Hill; and Prince Whipple, who participated in George Washington's noted crossing of the Delaware.\nThe Colored Patriots of the American Revolution is considered by some to be the first history book by and about African Americans that is based on written documentation.\nSummary\nIn 1851, William Cooper Nell, an African-American author, wrote the history Services of Colored Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812. It became a standard resource for African-American studies. A few years later, Nell wrote The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution, which also became standard reading. It was commonly taught in schools during that time.\nNell said in the conclusion about the goals of his book: \"If others fail to appreciate the merit of the colored man, let us cherish the deserted shrine.  The names which others neglect should only be the more sacredly our care.\"\nContents\nThe book is 396 pages long, organized into 18 chapters. It includes sketches of several \"Distinguished Colored Persons,\" as well as an Introduction by American abolitionist and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of the popular novel ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (1852).\nIntroduction\nIn her Introduction, Mrs. Stowe says the book was intended to highlight American Patriots who had been \"all but forgotten\" and to help reduce prejudices of both whites and blacks toward African Americans. She says that African Americans had been enslaved in the colonies and their laws \"oftener oppressed than protected. Bravery, under such circumstances, has a peculiar beauty and merit.\"\nShe concludes, \"And their white brothers in reading may remember, that generosity, disinterested courage and bravery, are of not particular race and complexion, and that the image of the Heavenly Father may be reflected alike by all. Each record of worth in this oppressed and despised should be pondered, for it is by many such that the cruel and unjust public sentiment, which has so long proscribed them, may be reversed, and full opportunities given them to take rank among the nations of the earth.\"\nChapter I - Massachusetts\nThe first chapter focuses on Massachusetts patriots, such as Crispus Attucks who is considered the first casualty of the American Revolution.
