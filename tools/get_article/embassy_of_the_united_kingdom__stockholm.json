The current embassy building located at Skarpögatan 6-8, was opened in 1967 and was designed by the architect William S. Bryant. Since 2018, the building has also housed the New Zealand Embassy to Sweden.\nThe British Ambassador's residence, which was built between 1914 and 1915 and was designed by Richard Allison, is located in the same area as the embassy, at Laboratoriegatan 8.
