Each season, one poll evaluates the various National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) football teams and ranks them. Coaches from each of the football conferences are members of a selection panel, with conferences receiving one vote for every four member teams. Sometimes referred to as the football ratings or the '''NAIA Coaches' Poll''', the poll is generally conducted once during the preseason and after each week of play during the regular season.\nOnce the regular season is completed, the NAIA will conduct a playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll will be taken after completion of the series of playoff games, collectively referred to as the 2020 NAIA Football National Championship.\nThe Top 25 was determined by compiling points for each vote. A team received 25 points for each first-place vote, 24 for second-place and so on through the list. The highest and lowest ranking for each team (counting zero for ballots with no votes for a team) were disregarded. To obtain the final tally, each team's ranking was recalculated with an additional point added to each team for every ballot (including discounted ballots) that includes the team.\nAs an example, if there were 17 voting panelists, and one team is a unanimous choice for the highest ranking, then that team would receive 25 points * 15 ballots (disregard 2 ballots) + 17 points (one for each ballot cast) = 392 points.\nTeams that received only one point in the ballot were not considered “receiving votes.”\nPoll release dates\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, modifications to the playing season and associated polls and release dates were made. Some teams were able to compete and complete their seasons in the fall of 2020; however, a large portion of the NAIA season was delayed until the spring of 2021.\nNo spring or preseason polls were released for the 2020 season; the first poll was released after the spring playing season was underway.\nFollowing is a complete schedule of 2020 poll release dates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

is being contested to determine the winner of the 2020 NAIA Football National Championship. Teams were selected to the field of participants through a two-tiered selection process.\nFirst, any conference champion ranked in the  final regular-season Coaches' Poll received an automatic bid into the tourney field. This was a modification (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) to the normal requirement that a champion needed to finish in the top 20 positions to receive an automatic invitation.\nAfter the automatic bids were granted, any open positions in the field were filled with at-large invitations. These at-large entries were granted to the highest ranked teams who were not conference champions, with some ranked teams omitted due to lack of playing a minimum number of conference games.\nIn 2020, there were 12 NAIA conferences (or divisions within large conferences) who had champions that were part of the selection process for the automatic invitations. The 12 eligible conferences for the 2020 season were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Conference\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Division\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Frontier Conference                   ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Great Plains Athletic Conference      ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Heart of America Athletic Conference  || North\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Heart of America Athletic Conference  || South\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-South Conference                  || Appalachian\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-South Conference                  || Bluegrass\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-South Conference                  || Sun\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-States Football Association       || Mideast\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Mid-States Football Association       || Midwest\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| North Star Athletic Association       ||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| Sooner Athletic Conference            ||\n|}\nBased on the Poll 5 (April 11) Coaches' Poll, the following teams (12 champions and 4 at-large teams) made up the 2020 playoff field:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Rank\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Conference/division\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Invitation type\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1 || Morningside (IA) || Great Plains || Automatic - 1\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 2 || Grand View (IA) || Heart of America / North || Automatic - 2\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 3 || Lindsey Wilson (KY)|| Mid-South / Bluegrass || Automatic - 3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 4 || Keiser (FL) || Mid-South / Sun || Automatic - 4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 5 || Concordia (MI) || Mid-States / Mideast || Automatic - 5\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 6 || Northwestern (IA) || Great Plains || At-large - 1\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 7 || Baker (KS) || Heart of America / South || Automatic - 6\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 8 || Reinhardt (GA) || Mid-South / Appalachian || Automatic - 7\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 9 || Marian (IN) || Mid-States / Mideast || At-large - 2\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 10 || Dickinson State (ND) || North Star ||  Automatic - 8\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 11 || Olivet Nazarene (IL) || Mid-States / Midwest || Automatic - 9\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 12 || Arizona Christian || Sooner || Automatic - 10\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 13 || Bethel (KS) || Kansas Collegiate || Automatic - 11\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 14 || Georgetown (KY) || Mid-South / Bluegrass || At-large - 3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 15 || College of Idaho || Frontier || (Not enough games)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 16 || Benedictine (KS) || Heart of America / South || (Not enough games)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 17 || Saint Francis (IN) || Mid-States / Mideast || (Not enough games)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 18 || Dordt (IA) || Great Plains || At-large - 4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 19 || Avila (MO) || Kansas Collegiate || (No bids available)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 20 || Roosevelt (IL) || Mid-States / Midwest || (No bids available)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 21 || Eastern Oregon || Frontier || (Did not qualify)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 22 || Carroll (MT) || Frontier || Automatic - 12\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 23 || Ottawa (AZ) || Sooner || (Did not qualify)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 24 || Southwestern (KS) || Kansas Collegiate || (Did not qualify)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 25 || Kansas Wesleyan || Kansas Collegiate || (Did not qualify)\n|}\nAfter the tournament participants were determined, the top 8 seeds were granted first round home games. The lone exception was #5 Concordia (MI), who played an away game due to restrictions in Michigan caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Opponents were generally determined based on the oft-used tournament protocol that pairs highest seeds with lowest seeds: #1 vs. the lowest seeded entry (usually #16), #2 vs. the second-lowest seeded entry (usually #15), #3 vs. the third-lowest seeded entry (usually #14), etc. This alignment was then tweaked, for geographic and travel considerations, by the tournament selection officials to determine the announced first-round pairings.\nThe first round tournament match-ups, finalized and announced on Sunday, April 11\n, were:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Rank\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Visitor\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Rank\n!style=\"background:#00ff00; color:black;\" |Home\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #22 || Carroll (MT) || at || #1 || Morningside (IA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #18 || Dordt (IA) || at || #2 || Grand View (IA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #13 || Bethel (KS) || at || #3 || Lindsey Wilson (KY)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #12 || Arizona Christian || at || #4 || Keiser (FL)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #5 || Concordia (MI) || at || #14 || Georgetown (KY)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #10 || Dickinson State (ND) || at ||#6 || Northwestern (IA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #11 || Olivet Nazarene (IL) || at || #7 || Baker (KS)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| #9 || Marian (IN) || at || #8 || Reinhardt  (GA)\n|}\nLeading vote-getters\nSince the inception of the Coaches' Poll in 1999, the #1 ranking in the various weekly polls has been held by only a select group of teams. Through Poll 5 of the 2020 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nThere has been only one tie for the leading vote-getter in a weekly poll. In 2015, Southern Oregon was tied with Marian (IN) in the preseason poll.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||57 (6)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||55 (3)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Morningside (IA)||45 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||25 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||24 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Saint Francis (IN)||21 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||14 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||5 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||4 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||2\n|}\nReferences"
