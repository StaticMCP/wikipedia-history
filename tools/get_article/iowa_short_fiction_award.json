It has been described as \"a respected prize\" by the Chicago Tribune, and The New York Times considered it \"among the most prestigious literary prizes America offers.\"\nThe award was founded by the University of Iowa Press in 1969, and has been continuously presented to a writer of short stories each year since. In 1988, a companion award called the John Simmons Short Fiction Award, named for the original director of the University of Iowa Press, was instituted. Both the Iowa Short Fiction Award and the John Simmons Short Fiction Award are juried through the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and winning books are published by the University of Iowa Press.\nSelect stories from winning entries are included in The Iowa Award: The Best Stories from Twenty Years and The Iowa Award: The Best Stories, 1991-2000, with selections by American author Frank Conroy.\nWinners of the Iowa Short Fiction Award by year\n* 2022: Stories No One Hopes Are About Them by A.
