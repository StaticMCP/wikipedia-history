From 1973 to 1975, Edwards served on HMS Endurance while it patrolled Falklands territorial waters. He was attached to the Special Air Service in 1982 during the Falklands War.\nIn 1982 Edwards retired from the armed forces and bought a farm on West Falkland with his wife, Norma (a Falkland Islander and former member of the Legislative Council).
