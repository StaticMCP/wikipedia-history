This was the first year that winners were announced at an in-person ceremony instead of being listed only in an issue of AARP the Magazine. The ceremony was hosted by Angela Lansbury and Shelley Berman at the Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles on February 7, 2006. Capote won Best Movie for Grownups, and David Strathairn won the award for Breakaway Accomplishment for Good Night, and Good Luck.\nThis was the last year that the AARP gave out awards for television (in the Best TV Movie category) until 2020. It was the first year an award was given for Best Comedy for Grownups.\nAwards\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Capote\n** Cinderella Man\n** Crash\n** Good Night, and Good Luck\n** Walk the Line\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Steven Spielberg&nbsp;– Munich'\n** Woody Allen&nbsp;- Match Point\n** Ron Howard&nbsp;- Cinderella Man\n** Ang Lee&nbsp;- Brokeback Mountain\n** Fernando Meirelles&nbsp;- The Constant Gardener\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Jeff Daniels&nbsp;- The Squid and the Whale'\n** Anthony Hopkins&nbsp;- ''The World's Fastest Indian\n** Kurt Russell&nbsp;- Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story\n** Nathan Lane&nbsp;- The Producers\n** Tom Wilkinson&nbsp;- Separate Lies\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Joan Plowright&nbsp;- Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont'\n** Judi Dench&nbsp;- Ladies in Lavender\n** Shirley MacLaine&nbsp;- In Her Shoes\n** Meryl Streep&nbsp;- Prime\n** Liv Ullmann&nbsp;- Saraband\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana&nbsp;- Brokeback Mountain'\n** Pedro Almodóvar&nbsp;- Bad Education\n** Paul Haggis&nbsp;- Crash\n** Jim Jarmusch&nbsp;- Broken Flowers\n** Sally Potter&nbsp;- Yes\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Cinderella Man\n** Good Night, and Good Luck\n** North Country\n** Capote\n** Munich\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story\n** Because of Winn-Dixie\n** In Her Shoes\n** Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont\n** The Squid and the Whale\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Craig T.
