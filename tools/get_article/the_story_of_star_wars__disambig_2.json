The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston, and was narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne. The script was adapted by E. Jack Kaplan and Cheryl Gard-Wornson. The album was released on 20th Century Fox Records (T-550) and came with an illustrated 16-page souvenir photo book.\nThe original film became a hit in the days before home video, so for many fans at the time, this album was the closest to owning a copy of the film they could revisit whenever they wanted.
