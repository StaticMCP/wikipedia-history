The post ranks immediately below the Vice President of Malawi. The current deputy vice president of Malawi is Enock Chihana. The position is appointed by the President and assists in the execution of governmental duties. The position also serves political and representational duties, especially in coalition contexts.\nConstitutional basis\nThe Constitution of Malawi grants the President power to appoint a Second Vice President. The office serves to provide balance in governance, usually used to strengthen political alliances and broaden representation within the executive.\nHistory\nThe office of Second Vice President was created in 1994 under the new multiparty constitutional framework, during the presidency of Bakili Muluzi. It was used in various administrations, though at times controversial or under debate for redundancy or constitutional clarity.\nIn September 2025, following general elections, Peter Mutharika won the presidency and officially sworn in as President. On 5 October 2025, he appointed Enoch Chihana as the Second Vice President. Chihana is a leader of the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), which entered into a political alliance with Mutharika’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ahead of the elections.\nDuties and functions\nThe duties of the Second Vice President include assisting the President and first Vice President in assigned tasks, representing the government at functions, and helping in coordination of governmental programs when delegated. The exact responsibilities are mostly defined by the President and may vary depending on political agreements, coalition arrangements, or specific needs of the administration.\nList of Second Vice Presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!
