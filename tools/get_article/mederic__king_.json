Mederic spent much time in Gaul, where he was introduced to ancient Greek culture. Because of this influence, Mederic gave his son Agenaric the name Serapio, after the Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis.\nReferences\n*Dieter Geuenich: Geschichte der Alemannen (Kohlhammer-Urban-Taschenbücher. 575). 2., überarbeitete Auflage.
