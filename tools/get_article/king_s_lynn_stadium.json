It currently hosts BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Car Racing, Banger racing, motorcycle speedway and is also a former greyhound racing track.\nOrigins\nThe stadium was constructed in 1951 on the west side of Saddlebow Road, adjacent to a poultry farm. It originally opened for greyhound racing.\nStock car racing\nSince 1955 it has hosted BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Car Racing, for which it has hosted World Final events for in 2007, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2019. It is set to hold the World Final again in September 2020 with this year's winner Tom Harris defending his title.\nSpeedway\nThe stadium has been the home of the King's Lynn Stars speedway team since 1965. It hosted the Final of the 1984 European (World) Under-21 Championship won by England's Marvyn Cox.\nThe shale-surfaced track is  long and is surrounded by a solid steel plate fence and like most international speedway venues, the fences in the turns are protected by an air fence.\nSidecar Speedway\nThree-wheeled motorcycle racing has been a regular visitor to Saddlebow Road over the years, the most prodigious event being the World Cup (The Gold Trophy). It was hosted in 2008 and won by Australian's Darrrin Treloar & Justin Plaisted.\nGreyhound racing\nIndependent greyhound racing (not affiliated to the sport's governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) began on 27 August 1951. It is believed that greyhound racing at the stadium ended in 1966.\nOther uses\nOther short oval formulas such as Banger racing also appear regularly at the track and the stadium also hosts drifting and stunt events.\nReferences"
