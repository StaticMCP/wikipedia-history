The club was founded in 1945. The club colours are green and white.\nThe men's association football team plays in the III liga, the fourth tier of Polish football.\nThe team reached the third round of the 1962–63 Polish Cup, the second round of the 1964–65 and 1977–78 Polish Cups, the round of 16 in the 1978–79 Polish Cup, the third round in 1984–85 and the second round in 1985–86. The team famously eliminated Śląsk Wrocław in their 1978–79 cup run.
