The Vendéens emerged triumphant, repelling the Republicans' assault on the town of Chemillé.\nPrelude\nOn April 9, 1793, representatives on mission,  and Richard, ordered General Jean-François Berruyer, the commander of the Republican forces in Angers, to launch an offensive against the insurgent territories. Despite his initial reluctance, due to his belief that the troops under his command were not yet numerous enough, Berruyer complied.\nOn April 10, the troops from Angers commenced their journey, divided into three corps. The initial contingent, under the command of  and comprising 4,000 soldiers, was tasked with following the Loire. The second contingent, which was directly commanded by Berruyer and Duhoux de Hauterive, also consisted of 4,000 men and set off from Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay, marching towards Chemillé. The third corps, under the command of  and comprising between 5,000 and 8,000 men, was tasked with capturing Coron and Vezins. Additionally, Quétineau's 3,000-strong force stationed at Bressuire was ordered to advance on Les Aubiers, to threaten the Vendéens on their right flank.\nBerruyer divided his corps into two columns. The first, commanded by himself and seconded by Menou and Mangin, was to attack Chemillé directly from the north. The second, commanded by Duhoux, passed through La Jumellière, where they routed a post of 600 to 700 Vendéens. On the way, the Republican soldiers burned a village and massacred several inhabitants at Pont-Barré.\nThe battle\nOn April 11 at noon, troops under the command of Berruyer arrived in front of Chemillé. The Vendéens, under the command of Maurice d'Elbée and Jacques Cathelineau, had established their position along the main road and behind the Hyrome River. The insurgents had fortified the small town. All the bridges crossing the river had been destroyed, and a trench and a redoubt, armed with cannons, had been constructed to cut off the main road from Angers. Additionally, the  had been crenelated: it was surrounded by an earthen embankment, and loopholes had been cut into the walls.\nBerruyer designated Menou as the commanding officer for the right flank, while he assumed the role of the commanding officer for the left flank. Subsequently, the Republicans initiated an offensive maneuver and crossed the river. In the center, the gendarmes of the 35th Division initially succeeded in capturing an artillery battery. However, the assault was eventually repelled, and the demoralized volunteers were compelled to retreat across the Hyrome. However, Duhoux's forces arrived as reinforcements to support Menou. A new assault was launched, and this time the Republicans were successful in pushing back the Vendéen lines, capturing the fortifications, and taking position in the Saint-Pierre Church square. Five cannons were seized, one of which was spiked and thrown into the river. As night fell, the town became the scene of confused hand-to-hand combat.\nThe prisoners of war, who had been bound together and placed in the front line as human shields, exploited the prevailing chaos to flee towards the lines held by the Republicans. However, in the absence of sufficient light, volunteers misinterpreted this movement as an enemy attack and fled. In the Saint-Pierre square, combatants entrenched in the church persisted in their resistance, and one insurgent detonated a munitions cache, further intensifying the Patriots' panic. D'Elbée, observing the disorder in the Republican ranks, initiated a counterattack. Ultimately, General Berruyer ordered a retreat and withdrew to Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay, where he arrived at midnight.\nBy the evening of April 11, Chemillé remained under the control of the Vendéens. The battle, which lasted approximately ten hours, concluded with the Vendéens maintaining their hold on the town.\nCasualties\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities, General Berruyer and Representative  posited that the insurgents had sustained approximately 600 casualties. On April 13, Representative Richard, acting on behalf of the commissioners of the Convention, presented a report on the battle in the departments of Maine-et-Loire and Sarthe. The report indicated that 15 Republican soldiers had been killed, while the insurgents had lost between 500 and 600 men. Additionally, 133 Patriots were freed, and six cannons were captured.|author=Letter signed by the representative Richard}}}} Refractory priest Jacques Cantiteau claimed to have seen in \"official papers\" that 1,500 Republicans had been neutralized at Chemillé, but this figure is likely an exaggeration. In 1840, military historian Patu-Deschautschamps provided a revised tally, noting 15 Republicans killed, including two officers, and 60 wounded. He reported that the Vendéens suffered losses estimated between 200 and 300 men. Patu-Deschautschamps also confirmed the liberation of 133 prisoners and the capture of five cannons by the Republicans.\nMoreover, approximately 400 members of the Republican Party were captured.\nA 2007 study by Manuel Jobar revealed that insurgents from Chemillé experienced significant losses, with approximately 10% of the 602 recorded insurgents being killed during the battle.\nAmong the casualties of the battle were the Republican Adjutant-General Mangin and the Vendéen leader . General Charles Duhoux de Hauterive was wounded in the leg.\nD'Elbée's Pater Noster\nFollowing the conclusion of hostilities, combatants from Vendée assembled in front of Chemillé's church, demanding the execution of the Republican prisoners detained there. General d'Elbée arrived on the scene amidst the assembled crowd, attempting to pacify the situation. At his behest, the men assumed a kneeling posture and eventually asked them to recite the Pater Noster, which they did. However, when they reached the words \"forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\", d'Elbée interrupted them, stating, \"Stop! Do not lie to God! You dare ask Him to forgive you as you forgive others while you are ready to take revenge on your enemies!\" These words provoked no protest, and the prisoners were thus spared. This episode became known as \"''Le Pater d'Elbée''\" (d'Elbée's Pater Noster\").\nAftermath\nIn his April 12 report, General Berruyer expressed discontent with the conduct of the volunteers, accusing them of cowardice. Furthermore, he expressed concern about the inadequate provisions and equipment available to the volunteers, stating, \"I must reiterate that I cannot rely on the volunteers' capabilities. The majority of them are equipped with substandard hunting rifles, lacking even the basic addition of a bayonet. Additionally, only a small fraction possess a fundamental understanding of weaponry. If I were to have at my disposal four battalions comparable to the 35th Gendarmerie Division, I would be confident in achieving success. However, I will continue to emphasize the critical necessity of putting an end to the disturbances currently plaguing this country.\"\nThe Vendéens' triumph at Chemillé proved to be ephemeral. On the same day, Bonchamps was vanquished by Gauvilliers at Le Mesnil-en-Vallée, while Stofflet was  at Coron by . Facing threats on their flanks and rapidly depleting ammunition supplies, D'Elbée and Cathelineau were compelled to initiate a strategic withdrawal. By the evening of April 12, all Angevin forces had regrouped at Beaupréau. According to Bonchamps' counsel, the Vendéen leaders resolved to withdraw to Tiffauges. On April 13, Berruyer's forces occupied Chemillé. Subsequently, on April 17, Cholet was recaptured by the Republicans. However, Berruyer erred in failing to pursue the Anjou army. Preoccupied with the condition of his troops, he was unaware that the insurgents were in an even more disadvantageous position.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
