It was the place where Baba Guru Nanak stayed and met Hamza Ghaus, a famous saint of Sialkot. The berry tree under which Guru Nanak stayed is still present. The gurdwara was built by Natha Singh and it includes a garden, a pool and residential rooms. The gurdwara was damaged in the wake of the Babari Masjid dispute. There used to be a very high temple which was razed to ground when it was demolished by an unruly mob.\nThe gurdwara was renovated during the 2010s and opened for pilgrims.\nGallery\nFile:View Of Gurudwara Beri Sahib Sialkot Punjab Pakistan.jpg|alt=View Of Gurudwara Beri Sahib|A view Of Gurudwara Beri Sahib\nFile:Bairi Sahib Tree at Gurudwara Beri Sahib Sialkot Punjab Pakistan.jpg|alt=Bairi Sahib Tree at Gurudwara Beri Sahib|Bairi Sahib Tree at Gurudwara Beri Sahib\nFile:Main Deewan Hall view Gurudwara Beri Sahib Sialkot Punjab Pakistan.jpg|Main Deewan Hall at Gurudwara Beri Sahib\nFile:Parkash Asthan Gurudwara Beri Sahib Sialkot Punjab Pakistan.jpg|Parkash Asthan at Gurudwara Beri Sahib\nFile:Sewa Plate at Gurdwara Beri Sahib Sialkot Punjab Pakistan.jpg|Sewa Plate at Gurdwara Beri Sahib\nFile:Nishan Sahib Gurudwara Beri Sahib Sialkot Punjab Pakistan.jpg|Nishan Sahib at Gurudwara Beri Sahib\nSee also\n* Sialkot\nReferences"
