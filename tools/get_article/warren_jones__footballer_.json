For most of his time at Carlton he was their second choice ruckman with Mike Fitzpatrick being their first choice, meaning that Jones often started games on the bench including in their 1982 premiership team. He later suffered from a bout of glandular fever which stalled his career and in 1986 he crossed to St Kilda where he played for three more years.\nExternal links\n*\n*"
