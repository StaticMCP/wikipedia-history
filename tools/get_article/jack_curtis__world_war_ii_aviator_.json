Curtis (July 26, 1923 &ndash; May 24, 2009) was a B-24 navigator during World War II who spent over eight months as a prisoner of war. His exploits were chronicled, along with those of his friend and fellow POW, Lawrence Jenkins, in the 2007 book, ''Eagles' Wings, An Uncommon Story of World War II'', by Andrew Layton.\nBiography\nA lifelong resident of Battle Creek, Jack Curtis was born on\nJuly 26, 1923. He left his night-time job at Kellogg's to enlist\nin the Army Air Corps when World War II broke out.\nAssigned to Aviation Cadet school, Curtis would become a\nNavigator on B-24 \"Liberators\" with the 376th Bomb Group,\nstationed in Southern Italy.\nBy late 1944, Jack had become a seasoned combat veteran\nwith more than 30 successful bombing missions to his credit.\nHowever, it was the 31st that would prove to be his most\nmemorable. While flying over Marburg, Yugoslavia, his\naircraft took a mortal hit that killed seven of its eleven\ncrewmembers. Jack escaped, but not without great injury.\nHis left femur was shattered by shrapnel, and the\nharrowing parachute jump only served to compound his wounds.\nAfter being captured by a German infantry detachment, Curtis would spend eight months\nin various Austrian prison facilities. He was finally liberated and sent back to the United\nStates where he would receive medical care at Percy Jones Army Hospital in his hometown\nof Battle Creek. Among the close friends he made as a patient there were future US Senators\nBob Dole and Daniel Inouye.\nFollowing the war, Curtis graduated from\nAlbion College and returned to his job at Kellogg's.\nhe eventually retired as an executive of industrial\nrelations after 43 years of service. Mr. Curtis was\nalso involved with many volunteer and service\norganizations including the Southwest Michigan\nFood Bank, of which he is a founder.\nCaptain Curtis's military awards and decorations\ninclude the Purple Heart, the Air Medal (with 6\nOak Leaf Clusters), the POW Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the ETO Campaign\nMedal (with 7 Battle Stars), the World War II Victory Medal and the British POW Medal.\nReferences\n* Layton, Andrew. \"Eagles' Wings: An Uncommon Story of World War II\".
