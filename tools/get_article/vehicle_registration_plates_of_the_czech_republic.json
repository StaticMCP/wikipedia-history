In this system, the first letter from the left represents the region (kraj), and this is combined with numbers issued in series from 1x0 0001, where x is the letter representing the region.\n{|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|}\nBy 2009, Prague (A) has reached the combination 9x9 9999 in its respective series; consequently it then started issuing plates which included a two-letter combination in the format 1xa 0000 to 9xa 9999, where x is the regional letter and a is a letter in alphabetical order (so that 1AA 9999 is followed by 1AB 0000, and so on). Shortly after that the Central-Bohemian region came. As of the beginning of the summer 2014, the South Moravian (B) and Moravian-Silesian in the November, lastly in April 2019 the Usti region. Regions were also issuing registration marks with two-letter combinations.\n{|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|}\nIn mid-2023, the serial of new license plates issued in the Prague region added a letter.\n{|\n|-\n|\n|}\nMotorcycle plates have the 2-line format 1x 0001, where x is the letter representing the region.\n{|\n|-\n|\n|}\nSince 2004 with the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, a blue European strip with the letters CZ and European stars have been added.\nAs of 1 January 2015, registration numbers are not changed if the owner of a vehicle moves to another region or if the vehicle is re-registered to a new owner residing in a different region. New numbers (with the corresponding code of the region of re-registration) are assigned only in the case of damage, loss, or theft of a registration plate.\nSince 2017 custom (\"personalized\") plates have been available, against payment of a special fee of 5 000 CZK (around 222 USD) per plate, i.e for a car it would cost 10 000 CZK and for a motorcycle 5 000 CZK. These have the format XXX-XXXXX (i.e. they have one more character than ordinary plates) and must contain at least one number. The letters G, CH, O, Q and W may not be used. The license plate cannot contain any abusive or offensive words.\nRegional letters\nMap of the Czech Republic with regions (coded)\nThe letter used to represent each region is derived from its Regional capital, with the exception of the Central Bohemian Region (whose capital, Prague, is a separate region in its own right). Typically, this is the first letter in the name, but sometimes a different letter is used to ensure only one region uses a given letter or to avoid the letter O due to it resembling the number 0.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Code !!Region !!Czech Name||Regional capital\n|-\n|A (01) ||Capital City Prague ||Hlavní město PrAha||Prague\n|-\n|B (02) ||South Moravia ||Jihomoravský kraj||Brno\n|-\n|C (03) ||South Bohemia ||Jihočeský kraj||České Budějovice\n|-\n|E (04) ||Pardubice ||Pardubický kraj||PardubicE\n|-\n|H (05) ||Hradec Králové ||KrálovéHradecký kraj||Hradec Králové\n|-\n|J (06) ||Highland (Vysočina) Region ||Kraj Vysočina||Jihlava\n|-\n|K (07) ||Karlovy Vary ||Karlovarský kraj||Karlovy Vary\n|-\n|L (08) ||Liberec ||Liberecký kraj||Liberec\n|-\n|M (09) ||Olomouc ||OloMoucký kraj||OloMouc\n|-\n|P (10) ||Plzeň ||Plzeňský kraj||Plzeň\n|-\n|S (11) ||Central Bohemia ||Středočeský kraj||Prague\n|-\n|T (12) ||Moravia-Silesia ||Moravskoslezský kraj||OsTrava\n|-\n|U (13) ||Ústí nad Labem ||Ústecký kraj||Ústí nad Labem\n|-\n|Z (14) ||Zlín ||Zlínský kraj||Zlín\n|-\n|V ||colspan=3|Historic vehicles (From 2006 they have a format of NNV XXXX, where NN means the number code, V the letter V and X a serial number)\n|-\n|Numbers ||colspan=3|Military vehicles, and diplomatic corps\n|}\nHistory\n1932 - 1954\nThis system was introduced in Czechoslovakia in 1932.

After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Republic introduced a new system of car registration plates in 1997 while the Czech Republic kept issuing the old one until 2001.  In the old system, the two first letters represented the district (okres). Registrations in Prague began with A, while the vehicles used by the government had registration plates beginning with AA.\n*Composition (older form: 1960–1984):\nXX-NN-NN or XXX-NN-NN\n*Composition (newer form: 1984–2001):\nXX NN-NN or XXX NN-NN\n(X = letters, N = numbers.)\nCommercially used vehicles and heavy goods vehicle had a yellow background.

Foreigners (Czechoslovakia) used same plates as DC plates except they did not use the DD or XX codes, and non-diplomatic personnel used a XX code instead. Since 2001 the yellow on blue plates have been replaced by plates with blue letters on a white background.\nOthers\nCommercial vehicles of have black letters with a yellow background, military have numbers only, rentals have red letters on a white background (discontinued), historic vehicles use green letters on a white background (always using \"V\" as a prefix), trailers have the district codes put in the middle (99 XXX-99 or 99 XX-99) and technical embassies use red letters on a yellow background (discontinued).\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://archive.today/20130122042134/http://www.diplomaticplates.com/cms/index.php/cd-plate-collection/26-cd-collection/100-czech-republic Diplomatic license plate]\n* [http://matriculasdelmundo.com/repcheca.html Czech Republic license plates, pictures and images]\n* [https://platesmania.com/cz/ License plates of the Czech Republic]"
