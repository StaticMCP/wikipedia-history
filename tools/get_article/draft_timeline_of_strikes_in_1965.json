This can include wildcat strikes, which are done without union authorisation, and slowdown strikes, where workers reduce their productivity while still carrying out minimal working duties. It is usually a response to employee grievances, such as low pay or poor working conditions. Strikes can also occur to demonstrate solidarity with workers in other workplaces or pressure governments to change policies.\nTimeline\nContinuing strikes from 1964\n* 1964–65 Mexican Medical Movement\n* 1964–1965 Scripto strike\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\n* Tulare labor camps rent strike\nApril\nMay\n* 1965 Danish beer strike\n* 1965 Wyandotte Chemical strike, 7-month strike by Wyandotte Chemical workers in the United States.\nJune\nJuly\n* 1965 Canada Post strike, wildcat strike by postal workers in Canada, represented by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, for the right of public sector workers to take strike action.\nAugust\n* 1965 Colombian teachers' strike, 10-day strike by teachers in Colombia over pay.\nSeptember\n* Delano grape strike\n* 1965 Malaysian forestry strike\nOctober\n* 1965 Chilean copper strike, 31-day wildcat strike by copper miners in Chile.\n* 1965 Uruguayan general strikes\nNovember\n* 1965 British Guiana sugar strike, 2-week strike by sugar workers in British Guiana.\nDecember\n* 1965 Dominican sugar strike\nStatistics\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there were 23,3 million working days lost to work stoppages in the United States in 1965, including 268 work stoppages involving at least 1000 workers, of which 21 involved at least 10 000 workers.\nReferences"
