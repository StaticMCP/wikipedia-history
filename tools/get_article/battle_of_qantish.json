The battle was fought between the forces of Caliph Muhammad II of Córdoba and his general Wadih al-Siqlabi against those of Prince Sulayman ibn al-Hakam, whose army was primarily composed of Berbers of al-Andalus who had been persecuted by the caliph and the people of Córdoba. Sulayman was allied with Castilian forces led by Sancho García of Castile, Count of Castile.\nThe battle ended in a decisive victory for Sulayman ibn al-Hakam and his ally Sancho García. Muhammad II fled after suffering a crushing defeat by the Berbers. Estimates of the Córdoban troops killed range from 10,000 to 30,000. On 8 November 1009, Sulayman and the Berbers entered Córdoba in triumph and sacked the city. Sulayman was then installed on the throne by Zawi ibn Ziri and was proclaimed caliph with the honorific title \"al-Musta'in\" given by Zawi.\nReferences"
