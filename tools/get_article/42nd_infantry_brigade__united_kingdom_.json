This is unlikely: The Times History of the War in South Africa 1899–1902 and the Army Lists of the period show no brigades numbered higher than 23rd (see List of British Army formations during the Second Boer War). Volunteer Infantry Brigades (similar to the 1980s' regional HQs) existed in the Volunteer Force from 1888, but these were unnumbered, and did not see active service before World War I. On the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908 those in North West England were incorporated in the East and West Lancashire Divisions. When these received numbers in 1915 as the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division and 55th (West Lancashire) Division, the brigades were numbered from 125th upwards.}} It was formed in August 1914 as part of  Kitchener's Army, and was assigned to the 14th (Light) Division, serving on the Western Front. It was reformed in World War II for line of communication and deception purposes. As 42 (North West) Brigade it became a regional headquarters from 1982 to 2017.\nWorld War I\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. Army Order No 324 of 21 August authorised six new infantry divisions to be formed from these recruits, which became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. The senior of these division was to be 8th (Light) Division composed of battalions drawn from light infantry and rifle regiments of the British Army, with three brigades numbered 23rd, 24th and 25th. This formation began assembling at Aldershot. However, it soon emerged that sufficient Regular Army battalions would be brought back from overseas garrisons to form an additional division: this became 8th Division, and the Kitchener division was renumbered on 14 September as the 14th (Light) Division, its brigades becoming 41st, 42nd and 43rd.\nOrder of Battle\nThe brigade was composed as follows:\n* 5th (Service) Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry – left division 16 June 1918\n* 5th (Service) Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry – disbanded 3 February 1918\n* 9th (Service) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps – left division 16 June 1918\n* 9th (Service) Battalion, Rifle Brigade – left division 16 June 1918\n* 42nd Company, Machine Gun Corps – formed by 24 February 1916; joined 14th Divisional MG Battalion March1918\n* 42nd Trench Mortar Battery – formed at Arras on 15 April 1916; broken up as infantry reinforcements by 14 April 1918\nFollowing massive casualties during the German spring offensive all infantry battalions of 14th (L) Division were reduced to training cadres (TCs) in April. Various other units were attached to the division during May to work on the Lillers–Steenbecque–Morbecque defence line. The division then proceeded from Boulogne to Brookwood and Cowshott Camp in England on 17 June to be reconstituted with TCs brought up to strength with troops of medical category B. 42nd Brigade was then composed as follows:\n* 6th (Wiltshire Yeomanry) Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment – formerly in 58th Bde, 19th (Western) Division; TC joined at Boulogne 16 June 1918, on 18 June absorbed 9th Battalion Dorsetshire Regiment (formed at Aldeburgh 1 June 1918)\n* 16th (Service) Battalion, Manchester Regiment (1st City) – formerly in 90th Bde, 30th Division; TC joined at Boulogne 16 June 1918; on 21 June absorbed 29th Battalion, Manchester Regiment (formed at North Walsham 1 June 1918)\n* 14th (Service) Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders – formerly in 120th Bde, 40th Division; TC joined at Boulogne 16 June 1918; on 21 June absorbed 17th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (formed at Deal 1 June 1918)\n* 42nd Trench Mortar Battery – reformed in England June 1918\nService\n14th (Light) Division crossed to France in May 1915 and completed its concentration around Watten, north-west of Saint-Omer, by 25 May.
