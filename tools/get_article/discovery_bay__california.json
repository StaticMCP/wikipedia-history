It is located in the San Francisco Bay Area. As of 2020, its population was 15,358, a 15% percent gain from 13,352 at the 2010 census.\nDiscovery Bay was originally a waterfront community built on a network of man-made dikes, surrounded by fresh water, except for the southeast quadrant, which comprises the golf course of Discovery Bay Country Club. Some homes have private docks with access to the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. Newer developments have been added on former agricultural land to the west of the initial town-site. Road access is via California State Route 4.\nHistory\nDiscovery Bay began as a planned community in 1964, and originally designated as \"Riverside\" and \"River Lake.\" It was built on land known as the Byron Tract, which was previously used for growing barley and potatoes. In 1968, Jurgen Lunding led an effort to give the community its current name.\nIn July 2007, Discovery Bay received its own ZIP code: 94505.  Formerly, it had shared 94514 with Byron. The ensuing celebration included a paddle boat raft-up that set a world record.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which  of it is land and  of it (19.5%) is water.\nGovernment\nDiscovery Bay is one of the unincorporated areas in California that has a community services district (CSD), a special district that provides some basic services that are usually provided by the county. The primary duties of the area's community services district, known as The Town of Discovery Bay Community Services District, are handling water, sewer, landscaping and recreation. The CSD Board has five members who are elected by community residents. While the CSD Board has no land use or zoning authority, the CSD can advise the county on decisions related to police and fire services, residential and commercial development, and more.\nIn December 2016, the CSD Board announced that Discovery Bay resident Mike Davies would become the general manager of CSD, effective January 3, 2017. He would replace the interim manager, Catherine Kutsuris. Davies had served as a police officer in Brentwood, California, including five years as chief of police there. Retiring from Brentwood Police Department in 2006, he was hired at the California Police Officers Standards and Training organization in Sacramento.\nDemographics\n}}\nDiscovery Bay first appeared as a census designated place in the 1980 United States census.\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Discovery Bay had a population of 15,358.
