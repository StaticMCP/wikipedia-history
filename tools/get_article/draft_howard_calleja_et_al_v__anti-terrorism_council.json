Howard Calleja et al. v. Anti-Terrorism Council, G.R. No. 252578 (2020), was one of the landmark cases filed before the Supreme Court of the Philippines challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 11479, also known as the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020. The petitioners argued that the law violated fundamental constitutional rights, including freedom of speech, due process, and protection against warrantless arrests.\nThe case was among the first of several petitions filed by various groups, including lawyers, academics, and human rights advocates, seeking to nullify provisions of the controversial law. Although the Supreme Court upheld most of the law, it struck down certain provisions as unconstitutional, marking a significant development in Philippine jurisprudence on national security and civil liberties.\nBackground\nThe case of Howard Calleja et al. v. Executive Secretary et, al arose from the enactment of Republic Act No. 11479, also known as the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 3, 2020. The law aimed to strengthen the Philippines’ counterterrorism framework by replacing the Human Security Act of 2007. However, it was met with widespread opposition from various sectors, including lawyers, human rights advocates, academics, journalists, and civil society organizations, due to its alleged overbroad and vague provisions.\nCritics argued that the law granted excessive powers to the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC), a body composed of executive officials, to designate individuals or groups as terrorists without due process. Provisions allowing prolonged detention without judicial warrant and vague definitions of terrorism were also points of contention. Petitioners claimed that these provisions violated constitutional guarantees such as freedom of speech, the right to due process, and protection against warrantless arrests.\nHoward Calleja, a lawyer and civic leader, led the first petition filed before the Supreme Court on July 6, 2020. This was followed by numerous other petitions, bringing the total to 37, making it one of the most contested laws in Philippine history. The petitions were consolidated, and oral arguments began on February 2, 2021.\nThe case drew significant public attention, with protests and statements from international organizations, including the United Nations and Amnesty International, calling for the repeal of the law. Supporters of the law, including government officials, argued that it was a necessary tool to combat terrorism and ensure national security.\nThe Supreme Court ultimately upheld most provisions of the law in its December 2021 decision but declared unconstitutional parts of Section 4 and Section 25. Section 4’s provision on acts intended to cause harm to the public was struck down for being overbroad and infringing on freedom of speech. Section 25’s second mode of designation, which allowed designations based on requests by other jurisdictions, was also invalidated.\nThe Petitioners\nA total of 37 petitions were filed before the Supreme Court of the Philippines.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Citation\n!Petition\n|-\n|G.R.

Petitioners included lawyers, activists, labor unions, and other civil society groups. They argued that the law’s vague provisions could lead to abuse and violations of fundamental rights.\nDuring the hearings, petitioners argued that the law’s definition of terrorism was overly broad and vague, potentially criminalizing legitimate acts of dissent and freedom of expression. The government, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, defended the law, asserting that it was necessary to combat terrorism and protect national security.\nThe oral arguments spanned several months, with petitioners and respondents presenting their cases on various constitutional questions, including surveillance, detention without a warrant, and the powers of the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC).\nSupreme Court Decision\nReaction and Impact\nSignificance of the Case\nSee Also\nReferences"
