He started slowly with Fremantle, playing only three goalless games in 1995, but impressed in 1996 by kicking the most goals for Fremantle and being awarded an AFL rising star nomination in round 14.  The following year saw a continuation of his good goalkicking form, with a second consecutive goalkicking award for Fremantle, including a career-best 7 goals in a 100-point loss against Collingwood.\nDespite kicking a goal in each of his 11 games in 1998, he was traded to the Western Bulldogs for the 1999 season.  At the Bulldogs he often played in the backline and had three successful seasons between 2000 and 2002.  In 2003 he went to Hawthorn but only managed 2 games before announcing his retirement from AFL football.\nHe returned to the WAFL in 2004, but switched to East Fremantle, rather than returning to Claremont before retiring from professional football at the end of 2005.\nKingsley was awarded the official AFL Goal of the Year for 2000 with a running goal which began in the defensive 50.\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080726114605/http://www.waflonline.com.au/players/player.php?playerID=2022 WAFL Player Profile]"
