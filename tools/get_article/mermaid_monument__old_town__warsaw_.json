The contemporary sculpture is a 2008 replica, with the original, designed by Konstanty Hegel and unveiled in 1855, currently being held in the nearby Museum of Warsaw. The work depicts the Mermaid of Warsaw, a symbol of the city, and its folklore patron. She is shown as a melusine emerging out of turbulent waters, with a spiral tail, and holding a sword in her right hand high above her head, and a shield in her left hand, near her chest.\nHistory\nThe sculpture was designed by Konstanty Hegel, and manufactured in Karol Juliusz Minter's workshop. By 7 August 1855 it was placed in the centre of the Old Town Marek Place. It became part of a fountain built as part of a newly-opened city water supply system, placed on an artificial rock formation, in the middle of a basin.\nMade from zinc, the sculpture depicts the Mermaid of Warsaw, a symbol of the city, and its folklore patron. She is shown as a melusine emerging out of turbulent waters, with a spiral tail, and holding a sword in her right hand high above her head, and a shield in her left hand, near her chest. The design of the sculptures was met with criticism. The sculpture is credited with further popularising the mermaid as the city symbol, and influencing later designs of its coat of arms.\nIn 1913, following the closure of the market place, the fountain was renovated and given a form of a octagonal fountain basin with 26 stone polls around it, connected with iron chains, with the statue placed on a sandstone pedestal. It was removed in 1928, and the sculpture was placed in a warehouse. A year later, it was moved to the Syrena Warsaw rowing sports club centre at 8 Solec Street. It was placed on a sandstone pedestal, sourced from the deconstructed St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.\nThe monument survived the Second World War, however it was greatly damaged during the Warsaw Uprising. It was restored after the war, in the Bracia Łopieńscy workshops. It included attaching new sword, left arm and shield, and patching over 50 bullet holes. To reinforce its zinc structure, the sculpture was covered in posphor bronze.\nIn 1951, the statue was placed in the Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły Park near Solec Street. In January 1969, it was vandalised with its surface being damaged and the sword ripped off. In July 1972, it was renovated and placed at escarpment of the former Marshal Tower, within the northern interior corner of the city walls. There, it was vandalised several more times. It was restored again between 1985 and 1986, and covered in a layer of bronze. It was removed from there in 1994.\nFollowing the renovations, it was unvailed at its original location at the Old Town Market Place, on 12 December 1999. It was placed on a new pedestal, designed by  Anna Jarnuszkiewicz, Krystian Jarnuszkiewicz, Jan Mazur, and Maria Mazur.\nIn May 2008, the sculpture was replaced with a replica, while the original was moved to the Museum of Warsaw.\nCharacteristics\nThe sculpture is made from zinc and depicts the Mermaid of Warsaw, a symbol of the city, and its folklore patron. She is shown as a nude melusine emerging out of turbulent waters, with a spiral tail, and holding a sword in her right hand high above her head, and a shield in her left hand, near her chest. It is 180&nbsp;cm tall, 119&nbsp;cm wide, and 120&nbsp;cm long. The sculpture is placed on a pedestal, in the centre of the Old Town Market Place. It is a 2008 replica, with the original dating to 1855 being in a collection of the Museum of Warsaw.\nGallery\nFile:Rybek Starego Miasta w Warszawie przed 1914.jpg|The Old Town Market Place, including the Mermaid Monument, in 1908.\nFile:Syrenka stalus2.jpg|The Mermaid Monument at the Old Town Market Place in around 1920.\nFile:Pomnik Syrenki u wylotu ulicy Zagórnej.jpg|The statue at the Syrena Warsaw sports club centre in the 1930s.\nFile:Pomnik Syreny przy Wieży Marszałkowskiej.jpg|The statue next to the city walls in the 1970s.\nFile:Rzeźba Syreny Muzeum Warszawy 2018.jpg|The original statue in the Museum of Warsaw in 2018.\nFile:Pomnik Syreny i strona Dekerta Rynek Starego Miasta w Warszawie 2020.jpg|The replica of the statue in 2020.\nSee also\n* Mermaid Monument (Powiśle), another sculpture in the city dedicated to the Mermaid of Warsaw\nReferences"
