It was an average Atlantic hurricane season in which eleven named storms formed. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1980 and ended November&nbsp;30, 1980. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most Atlantic systems form. Even so, Tropical Depression One did not form until July&nbsp;17. The season's final storm, Hurricane Karl, dissipated on November&nbsp;28.\nThe season produced fourteen tropical depressions, of which 12 intensified into tropical storms, four became hurricanes and two became major hurricanes. The only significant storm during the season was Hurricane Allen, a long-lived Cape Verde-type hurricane that became one of the strongest hurricanes recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the earliest Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale ever recorded, a record that stood until Hurricane Emily during the 2005 season. Allen reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of  with a minimum barometric pressure of 899&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.55&nbsp;inHg).\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.\nTimeline\nJune\n;June 1\n* The 1980 Atlantic hurricane season officially
