It resulted in victory for Kassa, allowing him to eventually become crowned as Emperor of Ethiopia.\nThis battle has been noted by some as one of the first 'truly modern' battles in Ethiopian history, given that the tactics used by Kassa of Tigray revolved around the use of gunpowder weaponry.\nReferences"
