Also known as \"The King's Daughters and Sons\" or \"IOKDS,\" the organization's mission statement is derived from the Bible's Mark 10, verse 45: “Not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” Its stated objective is: \"The development of Spiritual Life and Stimulation of Christian Activity.\"\nWith a roster of between 3,500 and 4,000 members as of 2018, the majority of whom reside in Canada or the United States, its members have been active supporting hospitals, homes for the elderly, thrift shops, and child care centers, as well as in providing scholarships for people in the health fields, those mastering in divinity, and to Native Americans.\nThe organization is divided into \"Circles\" of three or more members; a state or province wide group of \"Circles\" are called \"Branches\". The organization at one time had \"Unions\" and \"Chapters\".\nThe Order was based in New York City until 1972, when it moved to its current residence at Chautauqua, New York.\nHistory\nEstablished in New York City, New York in 1886 with a membership of ten founding women who were active with Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches in the area, the International Order of The King's Daughters and Sons held its first meeting on January 13 of that year at the New York City home of Margaret McDonald Bottome (1825–1906), a leader in the Methodist church who had become known for her hosting of Bible study sessions and other salons. Bottome reportedly was inspired to host the meeting by Edward Everett Hale, a Unitarian minister who had risen to nationwide prominence as an abolitionist and writer for the Atlantic Monthly prior to the American Civil War, and had then achieved wider name recognition through his establishment and promotion of \"Lend-A-Hand\" clubs across America — the motto of which became \"Look up and not down, look forward and not back, look out and not in, and lend a hand.\"\nInvited by Bottome to attend that initial meeting were eight of the organization's other nine founding members: Mary Lowe Dickinson, Mrs. C. DePeyster Field, Helen Hammersley, Mrs. Theo. Irving, Georgia Libby, Mary F. Payson, Mrs. J. F. Ruggles, and Susan B. Schenck. Isabella Charles Davis also became one of the organization's first ten members. As new chapters were formed, each was allowed to choose its own service mission and initially referred to as a \"Ten\" rather than a \"chapter\" — a designation which was later changed to \"Circle.\"\nElected as president of the organization, Bottome held that post until her death in 1906. Irving has been credited as the founding member who suggested the organization's name, \"The King's Daughters.\" Dickinson, who was appointed as the organization's general secretary in 1887 and then held that post for the remainder of her life, launched and became editor of the group's magazine, The Silver Cross, in 1888, and also penned the lyrics for the group's hymn, Lead Now as Forth We Go, which were set to the music of Nearer My God to Thee. In addition to helping to raise the profile of The King's Daughters and Sons via articles published in newspapers across the United States and lectures before audiences at such venues as the Dansville Water Cure, Dickinson was later also elected president of the National Council of Women of the United States.\nMembership quickly grew to 50,000 women and expanded from chapters across the United States to include circles in countries across the globe. One of America's earliest chapters was the Lend-A-Hand Club in Davenport, Iowa. Offering a safe environment to socialize for women living and working away from their homes, the club was an affiliate of Hale's Lend-A-Hand network, and operated from various locations throughout its history, including a department store in the city's downtown area. As the club grew, so did its amenities, which included a bath and shower area, cafeteria, gymnasium, laundry, parlor, and reading rooms. Arts and crafts programs were offered as were lecture series on women's topics. By 1922, club leaders had raised enough money to construct the organization's own facility, a building which was located on South Main Street across from the Dillon Memorial. Housed here from the time of the building's completion until the club's closing during the 1960s, the club presented lectures addressing women's suffrage and workplace issues, and offered members access to dormitory rooms and a swimming pool.\nAfter men and boys began requesting admission in 1887, the organization began expanding its membership base further and, in 1891, changed its name to The King's Daughters and Sons. By 1896, Canada's chapter had grown to 6,000 members with 26 branches in the United States. Circles had also been formed in Europe, Japan, China, Syria and India.\nIn 1909, the organization's state board of directors in Ohio built Rock Ledge Inn as a summer school for its members. In addition to providing religion classes, the facility offered respite opportunities.\nIn October 1911, the organization's Connecticut chapter held its 16th annual convention in Bridgeport at that city's First M.E. Church. Among those in attendance were the international organization's president and general secretary, Kate Bond and Mary Lowe Dickinson.\nThe international organization then hosted its first general convention in Louisville, Kentucky in 1912 By 1914, the organization's Ohio board of directors had begun charging members $6 per week for members to stay at the group's Rock Ledge Inn. In 1935, the board launched a junior camp for girls 12 and up to participate in archery, nature studies and other activities.\nIn 1972, the organization moved its headquarters from New York City to Chautauqua, New York.\nIn 2018, the organization closed its thrift store in Moline, Illinois, which was reportedly one of the longest running resale operations in the Quad-Cities region of the United States. The store, which launched in 1927, had relocated several times until finding a home, during the 1960s, in the city's Berglund Building on 1321 5th Avenue in Moline. The organization's first Quad-Cities group was founded by Katherine Deere Butterworth, a granddaughter of John Deere.\nMotto and symbol\nAccording to Sue Buck, who penned a brief history about the group, leaders of the organization adopted a small, silver Maltese cross as the badge to be worn by members, and chose the words \"In His Name\" as the phrase members would use as their \"watchword.\" The organization's motto was derived from the motto adopted by Edward Everett Hale's Lend-A-Hand Clubs, and remains:\nLook up and not down,\nLook forward and not back,\nLook out and not in, And lend a hand.\nNotable people\n* Jennie Casseday\n* Mary Lowe Dickinson\n* Sarah E.
