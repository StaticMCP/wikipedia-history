It depicts a scene from 23 January 1264 when Louis IX of France presided over the Mise of Amiens, a settlement between Henry III of England and his rebellious barons led by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. The attempted mediation ultimately failed, leading to the Second Barons' War.\nThe painting was commissioned by Louis XVIII as a design for a planned tapestry for the throne room at the Tuileries Palace. It was part of a policy of producing art celebrating France's royal history during the Bourbon Restoration following the final abdication of Napoleon in 1815. It was displayed at the Salon of 1822 held at the Louvre in Paris.  It is now in the Salles des Croisades at the Palace of Versailles.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Chaudonneret, Marie-Claude.
