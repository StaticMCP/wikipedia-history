It was Taiwan's first direct presidential election, officially the Republic of China. In the previous eight elections, the president and vice president had been chosen in a ballot of the deputies of the National Assembly, in accordance with the 1947 constitution. These were the first free and direct elections in the history of Taiwan.\nLee Teng-hui was re-elected President, and Lien Chan as Vice President. Lee stood as the candidate for the ruling Kuomintang. He won a majority of 54% of the votes cast. His election followed missile tests by the People's Republic of China (PRC). These attempted to intimidate and discourage the Taiwanese electorate from supporting Lee; however, the tactic backfired. Voter turnout was 76.0%.\nCandidates\nThe ruling Kuomintang nominated President Lee Teng-hui in August 1995 at its 14th Party Congress after plans to institute a closed primary system by his opponents were thwarted. As his running mate, Lee chose Lien Chan, who had attempted to resign as Premier of the Republic of China, to join Lee's ticket. Lee did not accept Lien's resignation, as Lien's potential successors to the premiership stood little chance of legislative confirmation. After the election, the Judicial Yuan allowed Lien to keep both posts.\nThe opposition Democratic Progressive Party conducted an extensive nomination process: the presidential candidate was selected after two rounds of voting and fifty public debates between the two finalists. Hsu Hsin-liang, Lin Yi-hsiung, You Ching, and Peng Ming-min contended for this position. The seventy-two-year-old Peng emerged victorious and nominated legislator Frank Hsieh as his running mate. Peng opposed trade with mainland China unless the PRC promised to \"treat Taiwan as an equal.\" Though he argued that the One-China policy would lead to another February 28 Incident, he took the position that Taiwan was already de facto independent, so a formal declaration of Taiwan independence was unnecessary unless the PRC attacked. However, Peng rejected unification with the mainland outright, describing the notion as \"suicide\" and \"self-destruction.\"\nFormer Taiwan Provincial Governor Lin Yang-kang ran independently with former Premier Hau Pei-tsun as his running mate. After the pair registered as candidates, they were endorsed by the New Party. Both Lin and Hau were expelled from the Kuomintang on 13 December 1995. They supported the One-China principle and favored opening direct links with the mainland. They argued that the KMT, led by Lee, had abandoned all attempts at unification.\nA second independent ticket consisted of former Control Yuan President Chen Li-an for President and Control Yuan member Wang Ching-feng for Vice President. Chen Li-an, the son of former Premier and Vice President Chen Cheng, used his Buddhist background (lay leader of the Fo Guang Shan order) and stressed moral purity and honest government. He walked wearing a farmer's straw hat for eighteen days to spread his views.\nFormer Taipei mayor Kao Yu-shu declared an end to his candidacy in January 1996. Feminist writer Shih Chi-ching also bid for the presidency, selecting Wu Yue-chen as her vice president. However, Shih and Wu's campaign ended after the Judicial Yuan ruled against them, finding that the ticket failed to meet the endorsement quota. Mudslinging was rampant between the remaining four presidential tickets. The KMT claimed that the Taiwanese mafia had amputated Peng's arm to recoup gambling debts. However, Peng had lost his arm in an American air raid on Nagasaki during World War II. Independent candidate Lin Yang-kang alleged that Lee Teng-hui was a member of the Chinese Communist Party, which he denied at the time, but later admitted involvement in a 2002 interview. The Kuomintang's website was also subject to cyberattacks. Chen Li-an criticized every other candidate for their advanced age.\n1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis\nFrom March 8 to March 15, the People's Liberation Army sent ballistic missiles  within  (just inside the ROC's territorial waters) off the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung. This action was intended to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate into voting against Lee and Peng, which Beijing branded \"absolutely identical in attempting to divide the motherland.\" Similarly, Chen Li-an warned, \"If you vote for Lee Teng-hui, you are choosing war.\" The crisis ended when two U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups were positioned near Taiwan.\nLee, who told his people to resist \"state terrorism,\" was seen as a strong leader who could negotiate with the PRC. Because of this, many constituents from southern Taiwan who favored independence voted for him. One Taipei newspaper, United Daily News, reported that up to 14 to 15 percent of Lee's 54% vote share came from DPP supporters.\nResults\nBy administrative division\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: auto; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #AAAAAA solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; line-height: 1em; text-align: right;\"\n!
