Their vassals began to adopt the title of king and were functionally independent of any other power.\nPeriodization\nThere is no agreed upon starting point for the Warring States period. According to one definition, it began in 481 BC when the House of Tian eliminated the House of Jiang and usurped the throne of Qi. Another defines the start as the Battle of Jinyang in 453 BC when the lords of Han, Zhao, and Wei eliminated the Lord of Zhi, thereby becoming the most powerful families in the state of Jin. Although the Usurpation of Qi by Tian and Partition of Jin are the two most salient political events used to determine the boundary between the two halves of the Eastern Zhou, other starting points for the Warring States period include the death of Confucius in 479 BC, the accession of King Yuan of Zhou in 476 or 475 BC, or the formal recognition by King Weilie of Zhou of the rulers of Han, Zhao, and Wei as vassal lords in 403 BC. Not all historians will accept a single year as a clean cutoff date, and some will choose arbitrarily.\nPartition of Jin (453–376 BC)\nIn the beginning of the 5th century BC, the state of Jin was dominated by five noble houses. In 453 BC, the three houses of Han, Zhao, and Wei defeated their rivals at the Battle of Jinyang and began the tripartite division of the old state of Jin. In 424 BC, they mutually recognized each other's independence; however, it was not until 403 BC when King Weilie of Zhou recognized this political reality and bestowed upon them the title of hou. In 376 BC, they formally divided the territory of Jin between themselves.\nPartition of Zhou (441 BC)\nIn 441, King Ai of Zhou was killed by his brother Shuxi, who became King Si of Zhou. King Si was killed five months later by his brother Wei, who became King Kao of Zhou. Fearing another usurpation, King Kao decided to split the territory of Zhou in half, with his brother, Prince Jie, ruling as the Duke Huan of Henan in Wangcheng (present-day Xi'an), while he himself resided in Gong or Chengzhou (present-day Luoyang). During the reign of King Xian of Zhou (r. 369-320 BC), Duke Hui declared independence for West Zhou, formally dividing Zhou into two territories. This bipartite situation persisted until 314, when King Nan of Zhou moved back to Wangcheng in West Zhou. In 256, the state of Qin annexed West Zhou and demoted King Nan. The remnants of West Zhou fled to East Zhou where they proclaimed Duke Wen as king. East Zhou's army was defeated by the Qin in 251 and was annexed two years later, ending the Zhou dynasty.\nRise and decline of Wei (424–341 BC)\nUnder the reign of Marquess Wen of Wei and Marquess Wu of Wei, the state of Wei expanded in all directions. In 408, Wei conquered Zhongshan and its generals Li Kui and Wu Qi dealt several defeats to the forces of Qin. In 405, Zhao, Wei, and Han defeated the army of Qi, capturing thousands of chariots and soldiers. In 402, the Three Jins defeated a Chu army at Shengqiu and again in 391 destroyed a Chu army at Daliang. Although a succession struggle in Wei allowed Zhongshan to regain its independence in 380, Wei had become the strongest power in China, attacking the states of Song, Wey, Han, and Zhao. The Qin returned in 366 and defeated Wei and Han at the Battle of Luoyin. Han and Zhao had a falling out, resulting in their defeat by Wei forces under Gongshu Cuo at the Battle of River Kuai. In 353, Wei sacked the capital of Zhao, Handan, but was then defeated in battle at Guiling by the state of Qi.\nIn 344, Marquis Hui of Wei invited other rulers to Mengjin under the pretense of paying tribute to the Zhou king. At the same time he proclaimed himself king. Wei's power did not last much longer. In 342, its army was ambushed at the Battle of Maling (Fanxian) by the army of Qi led by Tian Ji and Sun Bin. Soon after, Wei also lost its advantage in the west against a resurgent Qin under Shang Yang, who saw the return of previously lost territories and even forced Wei to shift its capital further east to Daliang.\nQin ascendant (356–257 BC)\nUnder the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin (r. 361–338 BC) and the implementation of Shang Yang's reforms, Qin became a major military power in China. Shang Yang's reforms emphasized agriculture and war over all other occupations. In Shang Yang's eyes, only tillers and soldiers were deserving of ranks and offices, while merchants, artisans, and intellectuals should be barred from official careers.\n|The Book of Lord Shang}}\nAfter Wei's disastrous defeat at the Battle of Maling in 342, Shang Yang invited the Wei general Gongzi Ang for a meeting, during which he arrested Gongzi Ang and destroyed his army. Qin went on to defeat Wei again in 339 at the Battle of Anmen and in 333 at the Battle of Diaoyin.\nIn 325, Duke Huiwen (r. 338–311 BC) declared himself king. Supreme commander Gongsun Yan defected to Wei and opposed Qin's rise by forging an alliance with Zhao, Han, Yan, and Chu. Together they attacked Qin in 318, but were defeated at the Battle of Xiuyu. Qin came to be known as the \"wolf\" from the west, carrying out annual attacks on neighboring peoples. In 316, Qin took advantage of a quarrel between the states of Ba, Shu, and Ju to their southwest, and annexed them, although normal commanderies would not be instituted until 285. In 312, Qin defeated the Chu army at Huayang and Lantian. In 308, Qin killed 60,000 Han troops. Chu lost another battle in 300, forcing King Huai of Chu to visit Qin for negotiations. He was imprisoned and died in captivity. Only a new alliance between Qi, Wei, and Han initiated by Lord Mengchang was able to drive Qin back to the eastern border at Hangu Pass.\nThe Qin returned again in 293 under the leadership of Bai Qi. His troops defeated the armies of Han and Wei at the Battle of Yique, allegedly killing 260,000 enemy soldiers. In 280, Qin forces advanced on Chu in three directions. In 278, Bai Qi took the city of Yan from Chu and followed that up a year later by taking Ying, the Chu capital. In 275, Marquis Rang led Qin forces to victory against Han, Wei, and Qi, killing 40,000 troops. In 272, Bai Qi defeated Zhao and Wei at Huayang, allegedly killing 150,000 enemy soldiers. At the same time Qin forces annexed the Yiqu on their northwestern border, transforming their territory into the commanderies of Longxi, Beidi, and Shang. However, in 270, Qin forces were defeated by the Zhao General Lian Po at Eyu, halting their advance for the moment.\nIn 265, Qin invaded Han and cut off 17 districts from Shangdang. The king of Han decided to cede those to Qin, but the local governor refused and instead defected to Zhao.\nIn 260, Qin and Zhao stood deadlocked in a stalemate at Changping. In 259, King Xiaocheng of Zhao became impatient was persuaded that his general Lian Po was avoiding combat. He recalled Lian Po and replaced him with a less experienced commander, Zhao Kuo, who immediately ordered his forces to attack the Qin. Bai Qi cut off the enemy supply line and surrounded them. After 46 days, the Zhao army was on the brink of starvation. Zhao Kuo made a final attempt to break out but was killed in the assault. The Battle of Changping ended with the surrender of Zhao forces; however, the Qin buried them alive, reportedly killing 400,000 enemy soldiers. Zhao never recovered this loss. Due to Bai Qi's immense success, high minister Fan Ju grew jealous and persuaded the king to slow down the pace of military operations. Two years later, the Qin army was defeated by relief forces from Wei and Chu at the siege of Handan, the capital of Zhao. Bai Qi feigned sickness and refused to lead the siege due to Fan Ju's machinations at court. In response, Fan Ju suggested demoting Bai Qi to a common soldier. Bai Qi committed suicide while on his way back to the capital.\nDukes to kings (344–325 BC)\nIn 344, Marquis Hui of Wei became the first ruler of the Warring States to proclaim himself king. However, it was not until 325, when Duke Huiwen of Qin declared himself king, that the other rulers joined in unison and also declared themselves kings.\nRise and fall of Song (318–286 BC)\nIn 318, Lord Yan of Song declared himself King Kang of Song. King Kang embarked on campaigns of conquest against its neighbors, conquering Xue and Teng in 297, and was even able to defeat the forces of Qi, Chu, and Wei in battle. In 286, these three states formed an alliance and defeated Song, splitting its territory between themselves.\nYan-Qi conflict (314–281 BC)\nIn 314, a succession in Yan incited King Xuan of Qi to invade Yan. However, Qi was ultimately forced to withdraw two years later. In 284, Yan successfully invaded Qi and annexed all its territory except for Ju and Jimo. In 281, Qi counterattacked by driving cows with burning tails into the Yan camp and defeated them.\nZhao adopts cavalry (306 BC)\nIn the mid to late 4th century BC, the state of Zhao adopted cavalry tactics from the northern nomads. Using their new cavalry forces, Zhao conquered Zhongshan in 306. Zhao general Li Mu went on to successfully defeat the Xiongnu several times after he took control of Zhao's frontier forces in 265.\n|Nicola Di Cosmo}}\nChu conquest of Lu (255 BC)\nIn 255, Chu annexed Lu.\nQin conquest of Zhao (236–222 BC)\nIn 236, Qin allied with Yan against Zhao. Qin forces under Wang Jian and Huan Yi attacked Zhao forces under Li Mu and Hu Zhe from the rear. Meanwhile, Zhao general Pang Nuan faced off against the Yan army. In 234, Qin forces dealt a defeat to Zhao at Pingyang; however, Qin suffered a loss the year after when Li Mu forced Huan Yi to flee to Yan. The Qin attacked again in 232 but they were defeated again at Fanwu. In 229, a drought severely weakened Zhao, inciting Qin to take advantage of the situation and invade. Wang Jian also successfully infiltrated the Zhao court and bribed the high dignitary Guo Kai to accuse Li Mu of rebellion. King Youmiu had Li Mu executed and replaced with Zhao Cong and Yan Ju. Not soon thereafter, the Zhao capital of Handan fell to Wang Jian. Zhao remnants fled to Dai Commandery and Zhao Jia ruled there as the king of Dai until the Qin general Wang Ben eliminated them in 222.\nQin conquest of Han (230–226 BC)\nIn 230, Han submitted to Qin. Rebellions by Han nobility lasted until 226 when the last Han monarch, King An of Han, was executed.\nQin conquest of Yan (227–222 BC)\nIn 227, Crown Prince Dan of Yan had the head of Huan Yi, who fled battle against the Zhao general Li Mu, delivered back to Qin under the guise of appeasement. When presenting the head to the Qin King Ying Zheng, the emissary Jing Ke attempted to assassinate him but failed. In retaliation, Qin generals Wang Jian and Xin Sheng attacked and defeated Yan and Dai forces at River Yi. King Xi of Yan executed Crown Prince Dan to mollify Qin, but Yan was conquered anyway in 222, after Qin had finished the campaign against Chu.\nQin conquest of Wei (225 BC)\nIn 225, Qin general Wang Ben diverted the Yellow River to flood Daliang. King Jia of Wei was captured and Qin annexed Wei.\nQin conquest of Chu (225–222 BC)\nat its height]]\nIn 225, Qin generals Li Xin and Meng Tian led a 200,000 strong army against Chu. General Wang Jian believed that only a 600,000 strong army would be able to overcome Chu, but Li Xin argued that it was doable with only 200,000. While Li Xin scored several initial victories, the Chu general Xiang Yan, for the most part just avoided battle and attacked the Qin commandery of Nanyang instead. Overcome with confidence, Li Xin was unprepared when Xiang Yan returned, and was defeated. The Qin returned to Chu in 224 with an army of 600,000 under Wang Jian. The two sides entered a stalemate in the region of Chen, but the Chu King Fuchu was eager to achieve victory, and commanded Xiang Yan to attack the Qin army. When the attack failed and Xiang Yan was forced to retreat, the Qin attacked in earnest and annihilated the Chu forces. Shouchun fell soon after.\nQin conquest of Qi (221 BC)\nKing Jian of Qi did not prepare for the Qin invasion. Wang Ben had previously bribed the Qi counselor Hou Sheng to neglect the army and not to support the other states militarily. It was said that when the Qin finally invaded Qi in 221, King Jian surrendered without a fight. When the Qin army took Linzi, the people displayed no sign of resistance. Ying Zheng declared himself Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty.\nQin's campaign against the Xiongnu (215 BC)\nIn 215 BC, Qin general Meng Tian led a 300,000 strong army against the Xiongnu in the Ordos region and evicted them from the area. Meng Tian then had walls erected, stretching from Lintao to Liaodong, a distance of some ten thousand li.\nAn inscription erected at Mt. Jieshi in the same year says this of Qin Shi Huang:\n}}\nQin campaign against the Yue tribes (214 BC)\nIn 214 BC, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Lingqu Canal, which in its completion stretched 2,000 kilometers north to south, linking the Xiang River and Li River. The new canal allowed the Qin to send armies and colonists south to conquer the Baiyue, annexing lands stretching from Fujian to Guangdong.\nShang Yang's reforms\n, 350 BC]]\nThe rapid growth of Qin's military began with the adoption of Shang Yang's Legalist reforms beginning in 361 BC. Shang Yang was originally a minor official in the state of Wei, but failed to gain recognition there and defected to Qin in 361 BC. Shang Yang personally led the Qin army to wage war on his native homeland and recovered territory previously lost to Wei. This forced Wei to shift its capital eastward to Daliang in 340 BC. After the death of Duke Xiao of Qin in 338 BC, Shang Yang was accused of treason and killed.\nShang Yang's reforms encompassed a broad ranging overhaul of Qin society which centralized political power and geared society towards greater agricultural efficiency and mass military conscription.\n|John S. Major}}\nPolitics\nIn 350 BC, Shang Yang reorganized Qin into 31 counties, each administered by a centrally appointed magistrate.\nAgriculture\nShang Yang reduced the power of hereditary landholders by replacing labor services with taxation. The well field system under which peasants cultivated plots of land for their overlords was abolished. Peasants were given the right to sell and buy farmland to entice resettlement from neighboring populations.\nLaw\nPillars were erected at the capital to promulgate new laws, which emphasized that \"The punishments did not spare the strong and great\" and meritorious service would be rewarded.\nGroup responsibility\nThe population was divided into units of five or ten families, within which all members were responsible for each other's actions.\n|The Book of Lord Shang}}\nShang Yang also sought to weaken family solidarity by applying double taxes to households with two or more adult males living together. In 350 BC, he outright forbade fathers and adult sons or brothers from cohabiting with one another.\nRanks\nShang Yang created a system of eighteen ranks, each gained through slaying one enemy, which conferred benefits such as tax and labor exemptions or land and office. However, later in 243 BC, ranks could also be gained by contributing grain to the government.\nStandardization\nWeights and measures were standardized to facilitate governance.\nMilitary ideology\n|The Book of Lord Shang}}\nAll males were expected to perform military service as part of their tax obligation. At the age of 16, males were called up for military training in their locality for one year, then they spent another year of training at the capital. However, only one male per family was liable to be called up for military training at any one time in order to ensure they still had enough men to produce crops. After that they were discharged to return home and farm with a scheduled military review every three years.\nFormations\n]]\n|''Sun Bin's Art of War''}}\nSun Bin advised deploying long weapons on the front lines, short weapons behind, and with support from archers. Square formations were suited to level ground, round formations to rugged ground, pointed formation when facing higher ground, and a square formation with wings when enveloping a battle line. Sun Bin also provides a general guideline for some formations to follow:\n*Square formations should be sparse in the center, thick at the sides, and especially strong in the back.\n*Dispersed formations are for when there is little armour and manpower, so that a formation appears strong and firm. By setting up banners, flags, sharpened weapons at the edges, and arraying numerous small groups to advance and retreat, one can intimidate the enemy.\n*Dense formations should have troops travelling in close quarters with enough room to wield weapons properly and not injure each other. It should be tightly woven and contain no gaps.\n*Awl formations should be thick at the base and sharp at the edges.\n*Hook formations should have a front line that is straight with wings that are curved.\n*Dark wing formations must be well ordered and use many flags and insignia, so that when they all move at once, the foot soldiers cause an immense racket.\nChariots and cavalry\n.]]\n]]\n|Derk Bodde}}\nCavalry was first adopted by the state of Zhao at the end of the 4th century BC. King Wuling of Zhao ordered his soldiers to wear rider jackets and trousers like the barbarians. Horsemen acted as scouts or raiders and were deployed in battle along with chariots. Sun Bin recommended arraying the chariots and cavalry in three units, one on either flank, and one in the back. Even so, cavalry only played a tertiary role in Warring States warfare, and chariots remained the preferred mobile force on flat terrain. The Qin chose the strongest and tallest men for their cavalry and chariot forces while short men wen given spears and halberds.\nFile:THorseChineseChariot400BCE.jpg|Warring States chariot diagram\nFile:Replica di un carro bronzeo (n.1) della dinastia qin al sito imperiale di xi'an.jpg|Qin dynasty chariot from the Terracotta Army\nFile:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - China-7255.jpg|Qin charioteer\nFile:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - China-7254.jpg|Standing charioteer\nFile:Qin bronze chariot two.jpg|Qin chariot\nFile:Xian China Terracotta-Army-Museum-05.jpg|Kneeling charioteer\nArmour\nTerracotta Army soldier wearing lamellar armour]]\nIn the 4th century BC, rhinoceros armour was still used. In the following passage Guan Zhong advises Duke Huan of Qi to convert punishments to armour and weapons:\n|Guan Zhong}}\nLamellar armour\nLamellar armour of leather, bronze, and iron appeared by the mid-4th century BC. Lamellar consisted of individual armour pieces that were either riveted or laced together to form a suit of armour. Iron helmets constructed with multiple pieces of iron lamellae began to replace the one piece bronze helmets of old. One sample discovered in Yi county, Hebei Province, was composed of 89 lamellae. The average dimensions of the lamellae pieces were 5&nbsp;cm x 4&nbsp;cm.\nIn the 3rd century BC, both iron weapons and armour became more common. According to the Xunzi, \"the hard iron spears of Wan (宛) [a city in Chu, near modern Nanyang (南陽), Henan] are as cruel as wasps and scorpions.\" Iron weapons also gave Chinese armies an edge over barbarians. Han Fei recounts that during a battle with the Gonggong (共工) tribe, \"the iron-tipped lances reached the enemy, and those without strong helmets and armour were injured.\" As a result of the increasing effectiveness of iron weapons and armour, shields and axes became less common. The efficiency of crossbows, however, outpaced any progress in defensive armour. It was considered a common occurrence in ancient China for commoners or peasants to kill a lord with a well aimed crossbow bolt, regardless of whatever armour he might have been wearing at the time.\n|Han Fei}}\nArmour was mostly restricted to elite guard units and each state distributed armour in their own ways. The state of Chu favorited elite armoured crossbow units known for their endurance, and were capable of marching 160&nbsp;km 'without resting.' Wei's elite forces, the Wei Wuzu, were capable of marching over 40&nbsp;km in one day while wearing heavy armour, a helmet, two swords, a halberd, a large crossbow with 50 bolts, and three days worth of rations. Those who met these standards earned an exemption from corvée labor and taxes for their entire family.\nAccording to Su Qin, the state of Han made the best weapons, capable of cleaving through the strongest armour, shields, leather boots, and helmets. Their soldiers wore iron facemasks.\nBy the end of the 3rd century BC, at least a few horsemen wore armour of some kind.\nFile:Zhou Bronze Helmet, c. 8th C.

Qin soldiers sometimes threw off their armour and engaged in fast charges. Qin armour usually used rectangular lamellae pieces with dimensions of 7.5&nbsp;cm x 8.5&nbsp;cm and 10.5&nbsp;cm x 7.8&nbsp;cm. Dimensions of lamellae used for charioteer armour varies between the upper body, lower body, and arms. Lamellae on the upper body were 7&nbsp;cm x 6&nbsp;cm, the lower body 9&nbsp;cm x 6.5&nbsp;cm, and arms 4-7.5&nbsp;cm x 4&nbsp;cm. Lamellae pieces on cavalrymen were 8&nbsp;cm x 5.7&nbsp;cm. A complete set of Qin armour, judging by the finds in the Terracotta Army consisted of 250 to 612 lamellae pieces in total, not including the helmet.\nSix groups of armour have been identified in the Terracotta Army corresponding to rank and military division. Ordinary soldiers are outfitted with no armour at all, cavalrymen with armour that covered the chest, armed infantrymen with armour covering the torso and shoulders, low-ranking officers with armour using large lamellae piece, middle-ranking officers with shorter armour covering the torso and waist or just the breast, but with decorations such as ribbons, and high-ranking officers with a distinctive coat showing torso armour and ribbons to signify their status. No soldiers have been found wearing a helmet or holding a shield. The high-ranking officer wears a pheasant-tail headdress while a middle ranking officer wears a long flat cap. Both armed infantrymen and cavalrymen have soft caps, but while the infantry cap accommodates the top knot, the cap for cavalrymen is flat and tied below the chin.\nThere is some evidence that armour for horses might have existed for Qin cavalry judging by 300 lamellae pieces too large for human use.\nSwords and polearms\ndagger-axe (ge)]]\njians]]\nIron and steel swords of 80 to 100&nbsp;cm in length appeared during the mid Warring States period in the states of Chu, Han, and Yan. The majority of weapons were still made of bronze but iron and steel weapons were starting to become more common. By the end of the 3rd century BC, the Chinese had learned how to produce quench-hardened steel swords, relegating bronze swords to ceremonial pieces. According to the Xunzi, the city of Wan in the state of Chu made the best steel weapons. After Chu was conquered by Qin, ironworkers were forcibly relocated there to work the local iron industry.\nBy the end of the 4th century BC, dagger-axes with spearheads began to appear, essentially becoming a halberd. Spears and halberds came in two general sizes. One about 2.8 m long and the other around 5.5 m, or what would be considered a pike in western terminology. According to Wu Qi, tall men were given bows and arrows while short men spears and halberds.\nThe Zhan Guo Ce states that the state of Han made the best weapons, capable of cleaving through the strongest armour, shields, leather boots, and helmets.\nSword dances are mentioned shortly after the end of the Qin dynasty. Swords up to 110&nbsp;cm in length began to appear.\nFile:Eastern Zhou Bronze Ge Dagger-axe.jpg|Dagger-axe, Eastern Zhou\nFile:Bronze halberd, Warring States period, Jingmen Museum.jpg|Warring States halberd (ji)\nFile:Warring States Bronze Pi.jpg|Warring States lance (pi)\nFile:Bronze weapons, Marquis Yi’s Tomb of Zeng State, Warring States, Hubei Museum1.jpg|Mace spear from the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng\nFile:Eastern Zhou Bronze Cudgel.jpg|Bronze cudgel, Eastern Zhou\nFile:Qin bronze swords.jpg|Qin jians\nCrossbow\n]]\n, 4th century BC.]]\nIn terms of archaeological evidence, crossbow trigger locks made of cast bronze have been found in China dating to around 650 BC. They have also been found in Tombs 3 and 12 at Qufu, Shandong, previously the capital of Lu, and date to 6th century BC. Bronze crossbow bolts dating from the mid-5th century BC have been found at a Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Jiangling County, Hubei Province. Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, Hunan Province, and date to mid-4th century BC. It's possible that these early crossbows used spherical pellets for ammunition. A Western-Han mathematician and music theorist, Jing Fang (78-37 BC), compared the moon to the shape of a round crossbow bullet. Zhuangzi also mentions crossbow bullets.\nThe earliest Chinese documents mentioning a crossbow were texts from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC attributed to the followers of Mozi. This source refers to the use of a giant crossbow between the 6th and 5th centuries BC, corresponding to the late Spring and Autumn period. Sun Tzu's The Art of War (first appearance dated between 500 BC to 300 BC) refers to the characteristics and use of crossbows in chapters 5 and 12 respectively, and compares a drawn crossbow to 'might.'\nThe state of Chu favoured Elite armoured crossbowmen known for their endurance, and were capable of marching 160&nbsp;km 'without resting.' Wei's elite forces, the Wei Wuzu, were capable of marching over 40&nbsp;-50&nbsp;km in one day while wearing heavy armour, equipped with a large crossbow with 50 bolts, a helmet, two swords, a halberd and three days worth of rations. Those who met these standards earned an exemption from corvée labor and taxes for their entire family.\nRepeating crossbow\n|Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China}}\nAccording to the Wu-Yue Chunqiu (history of the Wu-Yue War), written in the Eastern Han dynasty, the repeating crossbow was invented during the Warring States period by a Mr. Qin from the State of Chu. This is corroborated by the earliest archaeological evidence of repeating crossbows, which was excavated from a Chu burial site at Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei Province, and has been dated to the 4th century BC, during the Warring States period (475 - 220 BC). Unlike repeating crossbows of later eras, the ancient double shot repeating crossbow uses a pistol grip and a rear pulling mechanism for arming. The Ming repeating crossbow uses an arming mechanism which requires its user to push a rear lever upwards and downwards back and forth. Although hand held repeating crossbows were generally weak and required additional poison, probably Aconitine, for lethality, much larger mounted versions appeared during the Ming dynasty.\nThe invention of the repeating crossbow has often been attributed to Zhuge Liang but he in fact had nothing to do with it. This misconception is based on a record attributing improvements to the multiple bolt crossbows to him.\nMounted crossbow\nLarge mounted crossbows known as \"bed crossbows\" were used as early as the Warring States period. Mozi described them as defensive weapons placed on top the battlements. The Mohist siege crossbow was described as a humongous device with frameworks taller than a man and shooting arrows with cords attached so that they could be pulled back.  By the Han dynasty, crossbows were used as mobile field artillery and known as \"Military Strong Carts\". Around the 5th century AD, multiple bows were combined together to increase draw weight and length, thus creating the double and triple bow crossbows. Tang versions of this weapon are stated to have obtained a range of 1,160 yards, which is supported by Ata-Malik Juvayni on the use of similar weapons by the Mongols in 1256.\nMultiple bolt crossbow\nThe multiple bolt crossbow appeared around the late 4th century BC. A passage dated to 320 BC states that it was mounted on a three-wheeled carriage and stationed on the ramparts. The crossbow was drawn using a treadle and shot 10 foot long arrows. Other drawing mechanisms such as winches and oxen were also used. Later on pedal release triggers were also used. Although this weapon was able to discharge multiple bolts, it was at the cost of reduced accuracy since the further the arrow was from the center of the bow string, the more off center its trajectory would be. It had a maximum range of 500 yards.\nWhen Qin Shi Huang's magicians failed to get in touch with \"spirits and immortals of the marvellous islands of the Eastern Sea\", they excused themselves by saying large monsters blocked their way. Qin Shi Huang personally went out with a multiple bolt crossbow to see these monsters for himself. He found no monsters but killed a big fish.\nSiege equipment\n.]]\nWarring States siege equipment consisted of siege ladders, siege towers, and the traction trebuchet. The traction trebuchet, also referred to as a mangonel in some sources, is an artillery weapon which derives from manpower its motive force, and was probably used by the Mohists starting from the 4th century BC. Descriptions of it can be found in the Mojing (compiled in the 4th century BC). It consisted of an arm and sling mounted on a wooden frame, sometimes with wheels. Attached to one end of the arm were pulling ropes for men to power the weapon. Trebuchets mounted on wheels were said to have needed 200 men to pull each of them. In Chapter 14 of the Mojing, the traction trebuchet is described hurling hollowed out logs filled with burning charcoal at enemy troops. Mobile siege towers have been used in China since the 6th century BC. They were often called overlook carts, assault carts, or some combination of the two. A typical mobile siege tower was five stories tall mounted on axles with two wheels on each side. The tower was pushed forward by men on the lowest storey or pulled by horses and oxen.\nThe king of Wu mentioned it in a passage comparing land armies to the navy.\n|King of Wu (514 - 496 BC)}}\nArmy sizes\n]]\nThe army sizes given by the Records of the Grand Historian for the Warring States are almost certainly highly inflated. At several points it gives army figures upwards of several hundred thousand for both Qin and its enemies, each of which would be larger than the entire army mobilized by the Han dynasty at its height, which ranged from around 130,000 to 300,000 under Emperor Wu of Han.\n|Chris Peers}}\nGallery\nFile:Qin_Terra_Cotta_Armored_Sleeves.jpg\nFile:Group of terracotta warriors at Xian.jpg|Qin soldiers\nFile:Xian 2006 5-53.jpg|Qin standing archer\nFile:Pacific Science Center Seattle - Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor Exhibition 1.jpg|Qin kneeling archer\nFile:China.Terracotta statues021.jpg|Qin officer\nFile:2015-09-22-124242 - Terrakotta-Armee, Halle 2.jpg|Qin general\nFile:Terracotta Army A.JPG|Qin arrows\nSee also\n*Qin's wars of unification\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Ancient Chinese Armies: 1500-200BC C.J.
