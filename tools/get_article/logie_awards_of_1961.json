Jimmy Edwards from the BBC series Whack-O! was the Master of Ceremonies. The Awards presentation was televised in a half-hour live broadcast on ABN-2, Sydney, with delayed broadcast on ABC stations in other capital cities during the following week.\nThis was the first year that the awards were known as the Logie Awards, after having been coined by Star of the Year recipient Graham Kennedy the previous year, to honour the Scottish engineer and innovator who contributed to the development of television as a practical medium, John Logie Baird.
