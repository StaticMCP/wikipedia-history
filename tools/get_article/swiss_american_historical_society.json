According to the Society's website, it was established \"to promote the study of the Swiss in America, of Swiss–American relations, of Swiss immigration to the United States, and of American interest in Swiss history and culture.\" Currently, the society unites not only people with these interests, but also those who seek to do genealogical research.\nThe society publishes the Swiss American Historical Society Review three times a year and meets annually, the location rotating between Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York.\nWith members primarily in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland, the SAHS fosters contact between both sides of the Atlantic and serves as a link between Swiss Americans, Swiss, and Americans in an effort to promote cultural awareness and mutual understanding.\nHistory\nThe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw the establishment of a number of historical societies in the United States, representing various immigrant groups. Amidst this proliferation of immigrant historical societies, Swiss Americans and those interested in them and their history had by the 1920s become disillusioned at \"the fact that every outstanding person of Swiss origin was claimed by some other nation.” Among these were Ernest A. Kübler, Bruno Bachmann, and August Rüedy, who on July 4, 1927, founded the Swiss American Historical Society in Chicago. By December the organization had been incorporated into the State of Illinois.\nThe Society immediately set forth to prepare and publish several works increasing awareness of the Swiss in the United States. However, due to several factors, including the Great Depression throughout the 1930s, the Society began to decline in membership and activity. By 1937, only 48 due-paying members remained. Anti-German sentiment in the forties did little to help the Society's standing. The Society continued mostly dormant throughout the forties and fifties.\nSince 1963\nBeginning in 1963, with the involvement of Dr. Lukas F. Burckhardt, SAHS member and cultural counselor at the Embassy of Switzerland in Washington, Alfred Zehnder, Ambassador of Switzerland to the United States, and Heinz K. Meier, the Society began to be revitalized. By 1965, plans had been established to put out several newsletters per year, to present scholarly papers at their one business meeting per year, and to resume publishing work such as they had started at the Society’s beginning.\nIn 1979 the organization published an introductory guide to Swiss genealogy to facilitate research for those interested in Swiss family history.\nAfter the 1970s, the Society’s newsletter became increasingly more scholarly, and in 1990 became the Swiss American Historical Society Review, seen by the Society as a voice-giving instrument for Swiss Americans. The Review is currently published three times a year, in February, June, and November. The journal includes book reviews, articles of interest to Swiss Americans, and summaries of Society proceedings.\nIn addition to the Review, the Society has published thirty books; two more are in preparation.\nThe Society meets annually, with meetings rotating between Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York. Presentations at meetings explore a variety of topics related to the history of Swiss-American immigrants.\nSelected book publications\nProminent Americans of Swiss Origins, 1932.\nThe Swiss in the United States, 1940.\nRudolf Aschmann, Memoirs of a Swiss Officer in the American Civil War, 1972.\nPaul A.
