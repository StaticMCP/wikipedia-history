It was the largest earthquake to occur in the instrumental area in the Caribbean. It generated a tsunami that was observed as far as New Jersey. A total of 1,790 deaths were reported.\nTectonic setting\nThe Dominican Republic is located on the eastern part of Hispaniola, which is the site of a complex tectonic environment. The North American plate undergoes subduction below the Caribbean plate. In addition, the seismically active strike-slip Septentrional–Oriente fault zone runs through the northern part of the island. It has been estimated that the fault accumulates about  of strain every year. Major earthquakes (M>=7) have occurred in the northeastern Caribbean at least eleven times over the past 250 years, at least five of which have been located on the megathrust.\nEarthquake\nThe earthquake occurred on August 4 at 13:51 AST with an epicenter near the coast of Samaná Province in the northern Dominican Republic. The mainshock measured 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale; 8.1 on the surface-wave magnitude scale, and originated at a depth of . It was caused by movement on a northeast-dipping thrust fault striking northwest.\nAt least 63 aftershocks followed the largest earthquake including a magnitude 7.0 event that struck the coast on August 8. These aftershocks were distributed offshore along a west–northwest trending zone measuring . Several aftershocks with focal depths greater than  delineate a south or southwest dipping plate that is subducted beneath the region.\nA tsunami was generated by the initial earthquake and caused widespread devastation across Hispaniola. The tsunami was observed in much of the Caribbean and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Maximum tsunami heights exceeded  in several locations, with a height of  observed at Playa Boca Nueva, although it was likely associated with splash-up. A small tsunami was also recorded by tide gauges at San Juan in Puerto Rico, Bermuda and in the United States at Daytona Beach, Florida and Atlantic City, New Jersey. Approximately 1,790 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami.\nSee also\n* List of earthquakes in 1946\n* List of earthquakes in the Dominican Republic\n* List of earthquakes in the Caribbean\nReferences\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
