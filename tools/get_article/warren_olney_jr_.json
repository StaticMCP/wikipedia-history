Olney Sr. co-founded the Sierra Club in his law office with naturalist John Muir, and others, but was later expelled from the organization because he supported the flooding of Hetch Hetchy Valley to supply water to San Francisco.

In 1891, he was graduated with an A.B. at the University of California, Berkeley, where he played on the football team.

His clients included Western Pacific Railroad. From 1911 to 1919, he was counsel for the regents of the University of California. Beginning July 1, 1932, he served as president of the alumni association for two years, and thus sat as a regent.\nOlney was appointed Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court by Governor William Stephens, and served from March 1919 to July 1921. In November 1920, he was re-elected but left the court after a time to resume private practice with McCutchen, Olney, Mannon, and Greene (1921-1939)(later known as McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen and then Bingham McCutchen, until its collapse in 2014).\nIn 1930 to 1932, he was a special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States in antitrust litigation concerning the Radio Corporation of America.\nBar and civic activities\nIn 1917, Olney had charge of registration in California for the draft for World War I.

From 1935 to 1937, he was a member of the U.S. Supreme Court's advisory committee on rules of civil procedure for U.S. District Courts.\nPersonal life\nIn 1899 he married Mary M.
