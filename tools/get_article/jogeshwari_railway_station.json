The station lies on the Western line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network between Andheri and Ram Mandir railway stations. On 29 March 2018 Harbour line was extended from Mumbai CSMT to Goregaon.\nHistory\nJogeshwari railway station was opened after 1930/31. In the 1950s, the yard at Bombay Central (now Mumbai Central) was remodelled, in an attempt to provide additional stabling and washing facilities for coaches. The grass yard situated north of the Terminus was shifted to Jogeshwari to create space for the remodelled yard.\nOn 2 December 1961, two additional platforms were inaugurated at Jogeshwari by the then Union Defence minister, Krishna Menon. This helped, in part, to transform the rail-level platform station that was gradually developing into a modern station. New additions included a new platform that was 675 ft long, and 20 ft wide, having a 300 ft cantilever covering on the Down line (local). An island platform was also provided, being 675 ft long, and 35 ft wide, serving both the Up and Down lines. A waiting hall was provided for passengers, and coverings were installed on the entire FoB. Further, the pan-type lavatory on the island platform was converted to flush-type, and additionally, a seven-seat lavatory block of the flush-type was also added.\nDuring the inauguration, it was highlighted by the railways that the amenities available on the suburban railway then, were fit for the volumes of traffic prevalent several decades earlier. It was stated that the railways were attentive to the needs of the public, and several new facilities were being planned at various suburban stations.\nPlatforms\nJogeshwari Station has 6 platforms, of which the two for the Harbour line are constructed towards the north of main platforms. It also features an island platform,  in length.\nGallery\nFile:Jogeshwari railway station - Entrance.jpg|Jogeshwari railway station - Entrance\nFile:Jogeshwari railway stationː View from FoB.jpg|Jogeshwari railway stationː View from FoB\nFile:Jogeshwari Station.jpg|Jogeshwari Station Platform Board\nReferences"
