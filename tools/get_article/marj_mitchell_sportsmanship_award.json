When Scott Paper took over sponsorship of the Canadian Women's Curling Championship in 1982, they decided to present an annual award for sportsmanship.  From 1982 to 1997, the award had a different name each year, as the convention was to name the annual award after an individual from the host region who exemplified sportsmanship and dedication to curling.  In 1998, the decision was made to honour Marj Mitchell each year.  Mitchell curled for Saskatchewan and captured the national and world championships in 1982.  Mitchell died of cancer in 1983.\nScotties Tournament of Hearts Sportsmanship Award winners prior to 1998\nPrior to 1998, the Sportsmanship award at the Scotties Tournament of Hearts was named after a notable individual in the curling community where the tournament was held that year.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Player\n! scope=\"col\"| Team\n! scope=\"col\"| Award Name\n|-\n| 1982 || Carol Thompson ||  || Joyce McKee Award\n|-\n| 1983 || Penny LaRocque ||  || Ina Hansen Award\n|-\n| 1984 || Yvonne Smith ||  || Elizabeth MacDonald Award\n|-\n| 1985 || Cathy Dillon ||  || Lura McLuckie Award\n|-\n| 1986 || Mabel Thompson ||  || Jo Wallace Award\n|-\n| 1987 || Kim Duck ||  || Myrna McQuarrie Award\n|-\n| 1988 || Mary Baird ||  || Caroline Ball Award\n|-\n| 1989 || Heidi Hanlon ||  || Sylvia Fedoruk Award\n|-\n| 1990 || Jackie-Rae Greening ||  || Lee Tobin Award\n|-\n| 1991 || Alison Goring ||  || Vera Pezer Award\n|-\n| 1992 || Heidi Hanlon||  || Joyce Myers Award\n|-\n| 1993 || Laurie Allen ||  || Mabel Mitchell Award\n|-\n| 1994 || Patti McKnight ||  || Effie Hezzelwood Award\n|-\n| 1995 || Alison Goring ||  || Bob Stewart Award\n|-\n| 1996 || Stephanie Marchand ||  || Arline Wilson Award\n|-\n| 1997 || Alison Goring ||  || Diana Doe Award\n|}\nWinners of the Marj Mitchell Sportsmanship Award\nStarting in 1998, the Sportsmanship Award at the annual Scotties Tournament of Hearts was permanently renamed the Marj Mitchell Sportsmanship Award in honour of Mitchell, a Saskatchewan curler who died of cancer in 1983.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Player\n! scope=\"col\"| Team\n|-\n| 1998 || Anne Merklinger ||\n|-\n| 1999 || Jane Arseneau ||\n|-\n| 2000 || Anne Merklinger ||\n|-\n| 2001 || Jane Arseneau||\n|-\n| 2002 || Meredith Doyle ||\n|-\n| 2003 || Anne Dunn ||\n|-\n| 2004 || Sherry Anderson ||\n|-\n| 2005 || Stefanie Richard ||\n|-\n| 2006 || Kelly Scott ||\n|-\n| 2007 || Stefanie Clark ||\n|-\n| 2008 || Stefanie Clark ||\n|-\n| 2009 ||Cori Bartel ||\n|-\n| 2010 || Kelly Scott ||\n|-\n| 2011 || Cathy Overton-Clapham ||\n|-\n| 2012 || Amanda Gates ||\n|-\n| 2013 ||  Sasha Carter ||\n|-\n| 2014 || Sherry Anderson ||\n|-\n| 2015 || Sherry Anderson  ||\n|-\n| 2016 || Ashley Howard ||\n|-\n| 2017 || Kerry Galusha ||\n|-\n| 2018 || Sherry Anderson ||\n|-\n| 2019 || Sarah Potts ||\n|-\n| 2020 || Rachelle Brown ||\n|-\n| 2021 || Laurie St-Georges ||\n|-\n| 2022 || Karlee Everist ||\n|-\n| 2023 || Kerry Galusha ||\n|-\n| 2024 || Danielle Inglis ||  (Inglis)\n|-\n| 2025 || Nancy Martin ||\n|}\nReferences"
