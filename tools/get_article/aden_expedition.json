Following Britain's decision to invade the Port of Aden as a coaling station for the steamers sailing the new Suez-Bombay route, the Sultan of Lahej, who owned Aden, resisted, which led to a series of skirmishes between the two sides. In response to the incidents, a small force of warships and soldiers of the East India Company were sent to Arabia. The expedition succeeded in defeating the Arab defenders, who held the fortress on Sira Island, and occupied the nearby port of Aden.\nOrder of battle\nRoyal Navy:\n*, frigate (28 guns)\n*, sloop (18 guns)\n*, brig (18 guns)\n*, schooner (5 guns)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nSee also\n*Punitive expedition\n*Nukapu Expedition\n*Johanna Expedition"
