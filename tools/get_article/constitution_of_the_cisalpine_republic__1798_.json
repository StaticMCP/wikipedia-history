It came into effect just after a French golpe on 31 August 1798, replacing the 1797 Constitution.\nNapoleon had gone to Egypt, so the new French general Guillaume Brune managed to impose his friends to the Milanese administration.\nThe local French ambassador appointed a new government, and a new Parliament reduced to 40 and 80 members for each house. Even the departments were enlarged and reduced from 20 to 11.\nThis constitution lasted only a year, ending when war resumed and Austria conquered Milan, restoring the monarchy.\nSee also\n*Statuto Albertino\n*Constitution of Italy\n*Constitution of Italy (1802)\n*Constitution of the Cisalpine Republic (1797)\n*Constitutional Statute of Italy\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dircost.unito.it/cs/docs/cisalpina1.htm Text of the Constitution]"
