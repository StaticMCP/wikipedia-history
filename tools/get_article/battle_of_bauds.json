      "text": "# Battle of Bauds\n\nBattle of Bauds was fought in 962 in an area known as the Bauds, south of Findochty and west of Cullen near Portknockie, Scotland between Scotland, under King Indulf, and Norse pirates. The Vikings had been raiding and burning through Scotland, and had won numerous skirmishes against the Scots, including the Battle of Dollar. However, in this battle, the Norsemen were defeated. Afterwards, Norse control in Scotland fell apart. However, Indulf was killed in the battle.\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*George Bruce. ''Harbottle's Dictionary of Battles''.
