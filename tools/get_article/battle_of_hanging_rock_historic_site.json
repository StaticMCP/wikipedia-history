As part of a series of strongholds planned to maintain the British position in South Carolina, an outpost was established at Hanging Rock in 1780. The importance of this post was in its strategic location on the road from Camden to Charlotte. The first American attack on the post occurred on July 30, 1780, led by Major William Richardson Davie, with 40 dragoons and 40 mounted riflemen.  On August 6, 1780, and after three hours of fighting, many of General Thomas Sumter’s men were unable to continue the battle. It was agreed to plunder the British camp and depart.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\nAs of mid-2023, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have preserved 172 acres of the battlefield.\nReferences"
