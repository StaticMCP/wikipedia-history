In the , Bulimba had a population of 7,623 people.\nGeography\nBulimba is located  north-east of the CBD on the southern bank of the Brisbane River, but it is  by road.\nToponymy\nBulimba is reportedly a Yugarapul word used meaning 'place of the magpie lark'. The same word is the origin of the nearby Bulimba Creek, and of the Bulimba Reach on which the suburb is located. The leader, Bilin Bilin, has his name based upon the magpie lark, or the pee-wee.\nHistory\nBulimba was originally inhabited by the Yuggara people, who have lived in the area for at least 20,000 years.\nIn the 1820s, Bulimba was called Toogoolawah and was settled as a farming district, with residential subdivision commencing in the 1880s land boom.\nIn 1862, a Baptist church opened in Bulimba.

It was subsequently renamed Bulimba State School.\nDavid McConnell of Bulimba House held the first religious services in his home. A Primitive Methodist congregation was formed and met \"in the shade of a large tree which stood midway between the Bulimba Ferry and the site of the present church\". The Primitive Methodist Church was built in 1866, opening on Good Friday, 30 March 1866. It was the first church in the district. Growing suburban development in the area required a larger church, so a two-storey addition was added to the front of the church in 1926 as part of the church's 60th year celebrations, with the upper storey extending the existing church, while the lower storey was used as a hall and kindergarten. With the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, it became the present Bulimba Uniting Church.\nIn September 1884, 39 subdivided allotments of \"Amos Estate\" were advertised to be auctioned by Hooker, Son and Elliot.

Each tree was dedicated to a Bulimba serviceman, and labeled with plaques. The plaques and many of the trees are no longer there, however the Brisbane City Council and Bulimba District Historical Society are currently working on a project to replace the honour board, and plaques for those servicemen who bravely fought.\nIn September 1906, the opening of the Dalgety's new wool and grain store in Newstead meant many locals were employed.\nUntil around 1910, the area on the opposite (north) side of the Brisbane River was also called Bulimba, that area since being called Teneriffe or New Farm.\nIn December 1911, several building sites of \"Bulimba Hill Estate\" were advertised to be auctioned by Albert E.
