It was ported later to the Amiga.\nGameplay\nThe player is a criminal who has stolen a spaceship and encounters an evil alien race called Myrons that are about to destroy Earth. The objective is to destroy all alien power stations before they energise and blow up Earth. The game features 16-directional scrolling and 10 levels linked by warp tunnels. The spaceship has two weapons: a light laser used for weaker enemies and a more powerful blaster weapon used for armoured enemies. The game has an energy system where the ship's limited amount of energy can be focused on either weapons, fuel, or shields.\n| ASM = 9/12 (ST)8/12 (Amiga)\n| STAction = 54%\n| STFormat = 20%\n}}\nAktueller Software Markt gave a positive review, praising the graphics, sound, and gameplay. Amiga Action said: \"The graphics and sound are nothing to amaze you, and the game becomes very boring after just a few hour's  play.\" ST Action noted: \"the gameplay relies more on luck than skill, making for a very repetitive and irksome game.\" ST Format summarized: \"Warp plays like someone discovered a really neat way of getting the ST to perform smooth scrolling, and in their haste to show it off to effects-hungry ST gameplayers, forgot to bolt on the game.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
