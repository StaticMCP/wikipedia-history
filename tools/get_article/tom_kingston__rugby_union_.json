His usual position is outside centre or wing. He signed on to play for the Melbourne Rebels in 2014.\nEarly life\nKingston first started playing Rugby in Hong Kong and when his family returned to Australia he played junior rugby for the Mosman Whales before moving to play for the Manly Roos. He showed promise in his junior rugby career while at St Aloysius' College. His performances earned him selection in the Australian U16 Merit Side in 2007. Despite impressing selectors as a 17-year-old, Kingston missed out on playing for the Australian Schoolboys side in 2008, following a collarbone injury. He was selected in 2009 and earned four caps for his country.\nRugby career\nIn 2011 he made his debut for the New South Wales Waratahs, and later that year was selected in the Australian Under 20s side to play in the 2011 IRB Junior World Championship in Italy.\nHe was also selected for the Australian Sevens side in 2011, but had to forgo the opportunity to tour due to his commitments with the Waratahs.\nKingston became a regular for the Waratahs in 2012. On the back of strong performances, he was named in the media as a potential candidate for the Wallabies but did not gain selection. In late May 2013, he signed a two-year deal to join the Melbourne Rebels, starting in the 2014 Super Rugby season.\nHe competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nSuper Rugby statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:90%; font-size:95%; width:70%;\"\n|-\n!
