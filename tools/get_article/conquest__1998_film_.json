Thirty-two-year-old Pincer Bedier (Lothaire Bluteau), the French-Canadian manager of the only bank branch in the town, dreams of reviving the town and its only cash crop, the edible pea pods of the Caragana bush. Daisy MacDonald (Tara Fitzgerald), a young, beautiful and mysterious English or Australian woman, happens into town in her bright red Alfa Romeo sports car and when it stalls, finds herself stranded indefinitely until the needed parts can be shipped in. Her presence invigorates the town and its inhabitants and romance develops between her and the young banker, while the older inhabitants catch his vision of the future.\nConquest was shown at the 1998 Montreal World Film Festival. In 1999 Monique Mercure won the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, that of Grace Gallagher. Conquest has been shown on the Showtime network in the United States.\nPlot summary\nCast\n* Lothaire Bluteau as Pincer Bedier\n* Tara Fitzgerald as Daisy MacDonald\n* Monique Mercure as Grace Gallagher\n* David Fox as Carl Gallagher\n* Eugene Lipinski as Glenn Boychuk\n* Daniel MacDonald as Erwin Boychuk\n* Quyen Hua as My Lang\n* John Bourgeois as Morley\n* Susan Williamson as Margaret\n* Chrisse Bornstein as Dorothy\n* Jean Freeman as Betty\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
