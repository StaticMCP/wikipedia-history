To properly create such a draft page, please see the articles  ‘Your First Article’,  ‘Referencing for Beginners’ and  ‘Easier Referencing for Beginners’. In short, \"notability\" requires reliable sources about the subject, rather than by the subject.\nThe image used likely breaches copyright, which Wikipedia takes seriously, so should be removed unless clear evidence of its legal use is provided. If it is indeed the draft's author's \"Own work\" then the author clearly knows the subject and has a conflict of interest that must be declared (see details below). It seems highly unlikely that it is the draft's author's \"Own work\", unless the author is also a professional photographer, but no such evidence has been provided.\nPlease note that some of the references are not formatted correctly (see  Introduction to referencing with VisualEditor and  Wikipedia’s Manual of Style for help).\nThank you for declaring your conflict of interest. Please note that if you have not already done so, you must also declare your COI on your Talk page (to see instructions on how to do this please click the link). Given the conflict, the review of the page needs to be handled with care, mindful of the higher bar set by pages produced in circumstances of conflict of interest. Such pages typically may read too much like a promotional CV or advertorial, which Wikipedia is not; and/or contain prose that is not of a standard appropriate for an encyclopaedia (also see WP:PEACOCK and WP:NPV).\nPlease familiarise yourself with these pages before amending the draft. If you feel you can meet these requirements, then please make the necessary amendments before resubmitting the page.\nIt would help our volunteer reviewers by identifying, on the draft's talk page, the WP:THREE best sources that establish notability of the subject.\nIt would also be helpful if you could please identify with specificity, exactly which criteria you believe the page meets (eg \"I think the page now meets WP:ANYBIO criteria #3, because XXXXX\").\nOnce you have implemented these suggestions, you may also wish to leave a note for me on my talk page, including the name of the draft page, and I would be happy to reassess.

Schwartz was a third-grade elementary school teacher who created the first educational program named STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), as well as the first 501{C}{3} not-for-profit corporation named STEM in the United States.\nEarly Life and Education:\nBeverly Schwartz was born on December 21, 1950, in Albany, NY.  She grew up in Latham, NY, attending the North Colonie School District, graduating from Shaker High School in 1969..  She received a B.S. Degree in Social Sciences, with a minor in Education, in 1973 from Russell Sage College in Troy, New York. In 1976, she received a Master’s degree in Special Education from the same institution.  In 1994, she obtained a M.S. Degree in Educational Administration from the State University of New York at Albany, with a thesis titled: “Educational Collaborative Partnerships”.\nSTEM Program development:\nIn 1987 the New York State Department of Education announced a new hands-on science curriculum for the elementary level grades. The state planned on selecting the grades that would be tested at the end of the school year.  The test would be designed using hands-on stations that would have students demonstrate their knowledge of the subject areas that were in the elementary curriculum.  For example, students would demonstrate how to make an electrical circuit.\nHaving no experience with hands-on science and no equipment to help teach what the state was now requiring.  Ms. Schwartz approached a science demonstrator at RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) in Troy, NY and asked to borrow equipment, as well as for volunteer RPI students to assist in the creation of the hands-on lessons for her classroom that would correlate with the new N.Y. State hands on curriculum.\nMs. Schwartz used a thematic approach in her classroom that integrated all of the other subjects that the state required.  Mathematics, Reading, Social Studies, writing skills, public speaking, and other subjects were incorporated in daily lessons using the science theme of the unit that was being taught.  Working with the RPI volunteers, students watched demonstrations, performed hands-on group activities, built individual student projects, and went to other classrooms to explain how they created their projects. Field trips to RPI and area businesses were also included to see real-world applications for subjects studied.  Parents and experts were also invited to the classroom to help Ms. Schwartz and the RPI students with their lessons and projects.\nAfter the initial launch in the third-grade classroom, the program was disseminated to other classrooms in School 14 in Troy, NY.  As a result, Ms. Schwartz earned the 1990 Christa McAuliffe Award for New York State. The STEM program was filmed by NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw, narrated by Ann Curry, and presented by Jane Pauley on November 27, 1990.  Originally named “Learn Tech”, Ms. Schwartz renamed the program “STEM” in 1990.\nProgram expansion and community involvement:\nAfter winning the award, Ms. Schwartz was asked in 1990 by the Eastern New York Technical Council of Upstate New York if she would expand her STEM program and form a STEM board for four counties in the state of New York: Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer, and Saratoga. The society helped design science kits to go along with the NY State curriculum for the schools and raised money to build them for mentors to use in area classrooms.  There was no cost for teachers and students to use STEM programming their classroom.\nThe STEM board discussed that in the future new jobs would be created in the fields of STEM.  These jobs would need qualified people to fill these jobs. Ms. Schwartz and the STEM board reached out to women in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics to become STEM Mentors. The STEM board decided to encourage women as well as men working in the fields of STEM to become mentors for this reason. The women would act as role models for girls in the classrooms by demonstrating and doing hands-on activities and projects.  The woman would also be able to discuss their careers and encourage girls to consider going to college and choosing a career in a STEM field.\nThe STEM board after the first year evaluated the program and found educators found the STEM program made a positive difference their student’s learning experiences as well as meeting the new New York State curriculum.  The STEM board decided that to meet the demand of educators wanting to use STEM programs and to create kits for mentors to use, more funding was necessary.  As a result, the STEM program became a 501(C)(3) not-for-profit corporation in the state of New York . This allowed STEM to receive different types of funding from N.Y. State state, the federal government and businesses. The STEM corporation existed from 1992 to 2007.\nSTEM added yearly Science Fairs for all schools that used STEM for grades K-12.  Students were able to display and discuss how they built their projects.\nIn 1993, Ms. Schwartz coauthored, along with Lisa DePaulo (Henkel) and Mildred A. Stahl, An Educator’s Guidebook for the exhibit at the State University at Albany Art Museum, The Atmosphere: Art, Native Wisdom and Science.\nAwards:\n1990: Awarded a 1990 Christa McAuliffe Award for creating the STEM program in Troy, New York. The award was given by the United States Department of Education and the Christa Corrigan McAuliffe Center for Education and Teaching Excellence.\n1995. Citizen of the Year. Capital District Chapter, New York State Society of Professional Engineers. This award recognizes a non-engineer who made an outstanding contribution related to the goals of the engineering profession.\n2005. Jefferson Award for Public Service. Capital District, Albany, New York.\n2025: On May 9, 2025, Beverly P. Schwartz received a New York State Assembly Citation presented by New York State Assemblyman Phillip Steck for the creation of STEM and her contributions to STEM and education as a whole.  Beverly Schwartz was recognized for having the first 501(C)(3) not-for-profit corporation in New York State named STEM.\n2025: Also on May 9, 2025, Ms. Schwartz received a Congressional Commendation from the Congress of the  United States, presented by Congressman Paul Tonko of New York for the creation of the Science, Technology , Engineering, & Mathematics program – STEM. ​​​​\nReferences"
