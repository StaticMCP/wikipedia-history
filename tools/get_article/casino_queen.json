It is owned by Gaming and Leisure Properties and operated by Bally's Corporation.\nIt is still nominally a riverboat casino, but moved onto land in 2007. The gaming floor floats on a basin filled with 340,000 gallons of water, but the rest of the property's amenities are built on dry land.\nHistory\nIllinois enacted a riverboat casino law in 1990 authorizing licenses for ten casinos to open around the state. One of the licenses was guaranteed to East St. Louis, in an effort to help the financially troubled city. The group that would ultimately open the Casino Queen, led by real estate developer Bill Koman, submitted its proposal to the Illinois Gaming Board in January 1992. With no other proposals before the board, Koman's group was awarded the license in May 1992.\nThe Casino Queen opened on June 23, 1993. It was viewed positively by most city officials and residents, as the struggling city desperately needed both a revenue source and employment opportunities for its residents. Casino Queen originally operated on a boat called the White Star One.\nConstruction of a hotel began in 1998. The 157-room hotel, built at a cost of $15 million, opened in January 2000.\nChanged regulations led to the casino to be moved inland in 2007, but the gaming floor would still be required to float on water. To meet the requirements, the casino building has a basin filled with  of water on which the gaming floor was placed. The move inland also allowed the casino to add 10,000 additional square feet of gaming space. In 2014, the White Star One was auctioned off and sold for $600,000. Casino Queen has generated over $160 million for the city of East St. Louis between 1993 and 2009.\nIn 2012, Koman and his partners sold the Casino Queen for $170 million to a newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which would steer the casino's profits into the retirement accounts of participating employees. In 2014, to pay down debt taken on to finance the purchase, the ESOP sold the real estate of the Casino Queen to Gaming and Leisure Properties for $140 million, leasing it back for $14 million per year.\nIn 2020, the casino struck a deal with sports betting provider DraftKings to rebrand the property as DraftKings at Casino Queen. As part of the rebranding, the property will undergo a $10 million renovation that will replace the property's current restaurants and buffet with a full sportsbook, a new all-day restaurant, and a food court with three new quick-service options. The casino will also be integrated into DraftKings' mobile betting app, and also reached an agreement with Fairmount Park Racetrack in nearby Collinsville to operate slots and table games on their property, although sports betting competitor FanDuel has the track's sports-betting license.\nIn 2025, the casino's parent company merged with Bally's Corporation.\nProperty information\nThe casino includes both 1,100 slots and 34 table games in its 38,000 square feet of gaming space. Per Illinois law and unlike neighboring Missouri casinos, it is not open 24 hours a day.\nDining options include: the Bridgeway restaurant, the 3 Woks Noodle Bar restaurant, a That Chickn' Place chicken stand, QBar and Front Street Coffee.\nBoth a 157-room hotel and a 133-space RV Park are located on the Casino Queen property.\nThe East Riverfront station of the MetroLink light rail system is located directly next to the casino property.\nSee also\n*List of casinos in Illinois\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
