It represents the Ommegang in Antwerp.  As it was probably painted between 1644 and 1654, this composition was possibly the inspiration for the various interpretations of the subject, which Flemish artists such as Erasmus de Bie and Alexander van Bredael painted at a later date.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
