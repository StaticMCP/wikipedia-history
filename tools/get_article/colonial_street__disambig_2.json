The street set has a long history, spanning over 60 years of movies and television. From 2004 to 2012, it was used in the filming of the TV series Desperate Housewives, in which the street was known as Wisteria Lane. After the production of Desperate Housewives ended, the street underwent a small makeover to remove aspects of Wisteria Lane, so that it could be used in other productions. , most of the iconic white fencing and wisteria has been removed. Colonial Street has since been used for the NBC comedy About a Boy and the NBC series Telenovela, featuring Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria.\nHistory\nIn 1988, Colonial Street was overhauled for Tom Hanks comedy ''The 'Burbs. The old Leave It to Beaver home was removed. Following the movie, the homes were rearranged again so Circle Drive was connected once again.\nAmong the most noticeable changes were the removals of a church facade, seen on Murder She Wrote'', in order to make room for Edie's house, and of the so-called Colonial Mansion, which was replaced by a park.\nWisteria Lane\nABC show Desperate Housewives (2006)]]\nWisteria Lane is a fictional street, appearing in the American television series Desperate Housewives.\nBuildings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=7 | Colonial Street\n|-\n! rowspan=3 |  Building Number\n! rowspan=3 | Image\n! rowspan=3 |  Name\n! rowspan=3 |  Lifespan\n! colspan=3 | Productions\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Non Desperate Housewives\n! colspan=2 |  Desperate Housewives\n|-\n!
