The format was to be pair-against-pair. Culbertson laid down a bet of $5,000 and Lenz $1,000 (but the winnings to go to charity in any case).\nThe match attracted a mass audience, being front-page news across the world and widely reported on the radio; the term \"Bridge Battle of the Century\" was used in contemporary reporting. NBC aired a fifteen-minute radio broadcast on the match each night.\nThe first part of the match was played at the Chatham Hotel, in the Culbertson's apartment. The second part was played in the newly opened Waldorf-Astoria. Chief referee was Alfred Gruenther, a lieutenant instructor at West Point and bridge expert (and later Supreme Allied Commander Europe). Ely Culbertson's primary partner was his wife Josephine Culbertson (nowadays considered by some to have been a stronger player than her husband); she played 88 of the 150 rubbers. Ely Culbertson's other partners were Theodore Lightner, Waldemar von Zedtwitz, Howard Schenken, and Michael Gottlieb. Lenz chose as his partner emerging great Oswald Jacoby, but Jacoby quit about two-thirds of the way through the match, being dissatisfied with Lenz's play. Winfield Liggett was Lenz's partner for the remainder of the match. According to Gruenther, what chiefly upset Jacoby was that Lenz often criticised his play when (in his opinion) it was Lenz who had made the mistake. An example occurred in the 97th rubber, when after one hand Lenz criticised Jacoby's defence. Jacoby retorted that he had made a play that \"only twelve experts in the country would understand, and unfortunately Mr Lenz did not appear, at that particular moment, to be one of them\".\nThe match was for 150 rubbers and ran from December 1931 into January 1932. Lenz and Jacoby led through 43 rubbers, but then fell behind. Jacoby quit after the 103rd rubber. Culbertson built up a lead that grew to 20,535; Lenz made up some of that gap but still finished 8,980 behind.\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
