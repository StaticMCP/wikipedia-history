The battle occurred during the Gunboat War, itself part of the Napoleonic Wars. In the battle, two British frigates captured or destroyed three or four Dano-Norwegian gunboats. The Danish-Norwegian and British accounts of the battle differ.\nDanish-Norwegian account\nThe Dano-Norwegian Navy had based three gun-schooners Odin, Thor, and Balder, and the gun-barge Cort Adeler at the pilot station on Silda. However, only Thor and Balder, plus a third, smaller gunboat, were involved in the battle.\nOn 23 July the British frigates , Captain Richard Byron, and , Captain William Ferris, launched their assault. One of the Dano-Norwegian boats was able to hit at least one of the British boats, killing several British soldiers. Still, the British captured the station. The crew of one of the Dano-Norwegian boats scuttled their vessel and escaped. The British took the other two captured vessels as prizes and sent their crews as prisoner of war in England. The British also captured merchantmen moored in the vicinity.\nBritish account\nBelvidera and Nemesis were sailing close in-shore of Studtland, Norway. On the evening of 22 July a boat from Belvidera scouting a deep bay sighted three Dano-Norwegian gun-vessels. The next morning seven boats from the two frigates entered the creek and cut out the two larger Dano-Norwegian vessels. The British suffered no casualties, though the Norwegians lost four men killed.\nThe two larger vessels, Balder  and Thor, commanded by Lieutenants Dahlreup and Rasmusen, were schooner-rigged. Each mounted two long 24-pounder guns and six 6-pounder howitzers and had a crew of 45 men. The third gun-vessel, Gunboat No. 5, was of a smaller class; she carried one long 24-pounder and had a crew of 25 men. Her crew ran her up a fiord where they abandoned her; the decision was then made to burn her.\nThe British prize money reckoning refers to three vessels, Balder, Thor, and Fortuna. Fortuna may have been a merchant vessel seized at the time.\nAftermath\nThe local Norwegian commander, vicar Gabriel Heiberg, failed to alert other Dano-Norwegian naval vessels nearby that could have helped repel the attack. He also later issued an order to keep out of the way to avoid combat, an action for which he later underwent a court-martial.\nFootnotes\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n* [http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_sogn_og_fjordane/fylkesleksikon/3406633.html An article on the event from nrk.no]\n* [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~anders/books/Fra_Krigens_Tid/Stadt.html Some contemporary reports]"
