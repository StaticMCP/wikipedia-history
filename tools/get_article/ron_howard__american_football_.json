He played college basketball for the Seattle Chieftans (now Redhawks).\nEarly years\nHoward attended Pasco High School for three years. He played football, basketball, and track for Pasco High School. As a senior, Howard averaged 23.7 points per game while leading the basketball team to a 25–1 record, with its only loss coming in the state championship game to Snohomish High School, 53 to 51 in overtime. He was a high school All-American in basketball and All-conference in football as a tight end (he also played defensive back).\nHe accepted a basketball scholarship from Seattle University, where he was a two-year starter at forward. He finished his career averaging 9.2 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.\nIn 2006, he was inducted into the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career\nDallas Cowboys\nHoward was a basketball player who had never played a down of college football, but he signed as an undrafted free agent in 1974 with the Dallas Cowboys, declining an offer to play professional basketball in France. Howard played primarily tight end, the position at which he had been an all-conference high school player, and his signing is considered a prime example of the innovative personnel decisions the Cowboys were renowned for at the time.\nIn his two years with the team he earned the nickname \"Dr. W.\" for his hitting as the wedge buster in the special teams unit. In Super Bowl X, he played a quarter in place of injured starter Jean Fugett and also forced a fumble with a hit on Donnie Shell.\nSeattle Seahawks\nThe Seattle Seahawks selected him from the Cowboys roster in the 1976 NFL expansion draft. He became the first starting tight end in franchise history, posting 37 receptions (second on the team) for 422 yards (third on the team).\nHis 37 receptions in 1976 was a team record for tight ends that lasted 26 years until it was broken by Itula Mili in 2002. He played three seasons for the Seahawks, before plantar fasciitis in both feet limited his production and was eventually waived on August 9, 1979. He finished with 72 receptions for 850 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nBuffalo Bills\nIn 1979, he signed with the Buffalo Bills, but only played in one game. He was released in 1980.\nPersonal life\nHoward spent ten years as an ironworker in skyscraper construction. During this time, he helped build the Columbia Tower, the tallest building in Seattle. He once was a student teacher and gym class instructor at Asa Mercer Junior High School in Seattle. He currently works at Aki Kurose Middle School Academy, also in Seattle, as its assistant principal.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://wiaa.com/ardisplay.aspx?ID=361 WIAA Hall of Fame bio]\n*[https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/20010218/blai18/teaching-keeps-howard-at-the-top-of-lifes-game Teaching keeps Howard at the top of life's game]"
