According to some sources, it was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Sheikh Hasina, while to others it was Ziaur Rahman, the husband of Khaleda Zia. There has been widespread violence due to this rivalry.\nAftermath\nUse of the term declined as Sheikh Hasina remained in power after becoming prime minister once more in 2009, while Zia was placed under arrest. Hasina fled the nation on August 5, 2024 during the July Revolution, and Zia was later freed.\nCurrent Situation\nExpert prediction says the longstanding political rivalry in near to an end after the July Uprising. Sheik Hasina is now in an self imposed exile in India while Khaleda Zia is aged and facing several health issues. Both leaders of the political party are now nearly 80.
