He established a dargah there and preached Islam to the local population. Shamsuddin Sabzwari died in 1276 in Multan, where his mausoleum is located. The Urs of Shamsuddin Sabzwari takes place in June of each year.\nMausoleum and Urs\nThe mausoleum of Shamsuddin Sabzwari Multani is located on the high bank of the Ravi river. The shrine was built by his grandson in 1330. The tomb is square,  in height and surmounted by a hemispherical dome. It is decorated with ornamental glazed tiles.\nCompositions\nIn the closing lines of one of his Punjabi compositions, Pīr Shams emphasizes that his ginān is addressed to the world of spirits. He advises his listeners to fight and overcome their constantly changing minds so their spirits can be enlightened by his teachings. Failure to understand the deeper meaning of the gināns will cause the 'entire life of that heedless one [to be] lost'.\nSee also\n* Mausoleums of Multan\nReferences"
