      "text": "# Draft:Warren H. Diamond\n\nWarren Diamond was a wealthy pharmacist, philanthropist, and gambling czar in Dallas from the late 19th century until his death in 1932. Known by some as being one Benny Binion's criminal mentors, Diamond was also known for being the prolific dice game operator who popularized taking no limit bets.\nEarly Years\nWarren Diamond was born March 22, 1877 in Dallas Texas. As a young boy he worked as a delivery boy for Will Aperson's drugstore. At the time, in addition to selling medicine, drugstores in Dallas were known for selling games of gambling and organizing back-room card games. Soon, Diamond would be promoted to card dealer and then later the dice dealer for Aperson's back-room gambling operation. As Diamond began gambling on his own outside of Aperson's operation, he slowly built his bankroll, and started adding people to his own operation.\nCasino Years\nYears later (1912) , while running a small gambling operation on Camp street near downtown Dallas, Diamond was arrested for keeping premises for the purposes of gambling and received 2 years of jail time at Huntsville State penitentiary. Diamond was conditionally pardoned by Governor Oscar Branch Colquitt and upon his return to Dallas he grew his operation and set up shop in the St. George Hotel. Over the course of his career Diamond was most known for \"fading the shooter\" while playing craps, essentially taking the other side of the shooters bet, and allowing his customers to wager no limit bets. His operation got large enough for him to purchase a large mansion in Highland Park, exclusive imported vehicles, and it is rumored that he was fading shooters who were able to bet $80,000-176,000 on a single dice roll.\nDeath\nAfter experiencing frequent health issues, Warren Diamond was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. In 1932, after abruptly leaving the St. Paul Sanitarium, he ended his life in the home he shared with his wife Nellie on 4224 Armstrong Parkway.\nReferences"
