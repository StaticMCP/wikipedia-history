Macedonian forces launched a large-scale offensive in Nikuštak on 27 June 2001.\nBackground\nShortly before the battle, NLA rebels were evacuated to Nikuštak, after the Battle of Aračinovo.\nBattle\nOn 27 July, the NLA launched an attack on Macedonian army positions at Umin Dol, located just east of Nikuštak. The NLA reportedly had used mortars, snipers, and automatic fire upon the Macedonian forces. A few hours later, the Macedonian Army initiated an offensive and employed various weapons, including artillery and tanks, to combat the NLA in Nikuštak.\nOn 28 June, Kosovo Force soldiers apprehended 90 suspected NLA rebels along Kosovo's border region with Macedonia, who had arrived from Nikuštak. This action was taken following NATO's decision to deploy 3000 soldiers to Macedonia to resolve the conflict and restore peace.\nFighting continued, and on 2 July, as part of the offensive, Macedonian forces fired 80 rockets at NLA positions within the village.\nOn 4 July, there were clashes near the village, where according to the Macedonian army, the militants were regrouping.\nOn 5 July, a nationwide ceasefire deal was reached between the NLA and the Macedonian government under the auspice of NATO. The NLA retained control over Nikuštak.\nAftermath\nAs a result of the Macedonian shelling and heavy fighting, the village was heavily damaged, while the Nikuštak mosque was destroyed. The rebels in Nikuštak were disarmed by NATO in late August after a peace deal was reached. In December, the Macedonian police restored their presence in the village with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's assistance.\nReferences"
