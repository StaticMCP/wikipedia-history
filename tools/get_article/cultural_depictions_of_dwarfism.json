Several of the issues pertain to these agencies presenting characters with dwarfism as fantastical, abnormal, or unusual. Most roles available for actors with dwarfism are limited to “dwarf, pygmies, elves, munchkin, and monster [characters]”. This has been extremely harmful to the treatment of little people in public life which has been highlighted through the lived experiences of people with dwarfism. In an interview, a little person noted that “they [little people in entertainment] were either funny or scary; and that’s how people reacted towards [them]; constantly: [they were] either funny or scary”. Another barrier that little people face, specifically actors, is that goals to stop perpetuating stereotypes through limiting casting them for fantastical roles, has decreased acting opportunities and visibility for little people.\nSnow White (2025 film)\nThe live-action adaptation of the Disney film, Snow White, has received backlash and praise for its portrayal of the seven dwarfs using CGI. Well-known actor with dwarfism, Peter Dinklage, says that casting a latina actress for Snow White, but “still telling the story of the seven dwarfs who live in the cave [is] backwards”. Erin Pritchard, a professor at The London School of Economics, who has dwarfism, says that the production’s commitment to diversifying the seven dwarfs by varying their races, genders, and height, gives her hope that representations of little people in the media are changing.\nWonka (2023 film)\nWonka, an adaptation of the 1971 film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, has received negative feedback for casting a non-disabled, average height actor as an Oompa Loompa, and using technology to make him shorter. Criticisms of portraying Oompa Loompas in this way included not only the perpetuation of stereotypes—little people as fantastical creatures, but some people with dwarfism felt it further restricted the opportunities dwarf actors have.\nUnharmful depictions\nLittle people feel they are best represented in the media when portrayed as a typical person who has responsibilities and obligations similar to most people and not a fantastical character or someone to laugh at. People with dwarfism are depicted in this way commonly in reality TV shows or documentaries; however, there are some fictional series that cast little people as characters that are not centered around the disability.\nEastEnders (TV series)\nEastenders is a fictional soap opera in the UK that had cast a little person as one of the school teachers. The portrayal of the little person—where the character did not depend on whether the actor had dwarfism or not—emphasized that little people are “just like anyone else in society”. This was a progressive depiction of little people in the media as it signaled a shift away from a fantastical perception of dwarfs.\nReferences"
