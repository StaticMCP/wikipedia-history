Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nAccording to the 54th Grammy Awards guideline the category was \"for albums containing at least 51% playing time of new vocal or instrumental blues recordings\".\nThis award combined the previous categories for Best Contemporary Blues Album and Best Traditional Blues Album, which both existed between 1983 and 2011. The Recording Academy decided to create this new category for 2012 upon stating there were \"challenges in distinguishing between... Contemporary and Traditional Blues\".\nIn 2017 the distinction between contemporary and traditional blues albums was reinstated. Both categories returned, while the Best Blues Album category was discontinued.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Performing artist(s)\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Work\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Nominees\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012\n| Tedeschi Trucks Band\n| Revelator\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2013\n| Dr. John\n| Locked Down\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014\n| Ben Harper with Charlie Musselwhite\n| Get Up!\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015\n| Johnny Winter\n| Step Back\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016\n| Buddy Guy\n| Born to Play Guitar\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nSee also\n*List of Grammy Award categories\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.grammy.com Official Site of the Grammy Awards]"
