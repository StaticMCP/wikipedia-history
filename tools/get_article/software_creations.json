The company was established in 1985 by Richard Kay. They were primarily known for their video games based on movie and comic licences like Marvel Comics, Cutthroat Island, Disney's Beauty and the Beast and the original titles Plok!, Solstice, and its sequel Equinox.\nHistory\nAccording to Richard Kay, Software Creations began in 1986 when Steve Ruddy responded to an advertisement he had placed in the Manchester Evening News: |Richard Kay|Retro Gamer}}\nMost of these early games were ports of budget titles to other platforms such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, Atari ST, NES and the Game Boy. The company's breakthrough game was the Commodore 64 version of the arcade hit Bubble Bobble, a conversion which won critical acclaim and commercial success, and led to Software Creations being asked to do many more ports of popular arcade games. By this time the company had grown to include brothers Mike, Tim, and Geoff Follin, and artist Mark Wilson.\nAn early demo of Solstice won Software Creations a contract with Nintendo, leading to some high-profile NES and Super NES games.\nDuring the mid-1990s, Software Creations was responsible for the development of sound tools used in the creation of music for the Nintendo 64 and its development systems.\nOn 1 May 2002 Acclaim announced that they had acquired Software Creations, which was renamed Acclaim Studios Manchester. At the time, Software Creations had approximately 70 employees. Acclaim Studios Manchester was closed as part of Acclaim Studios and all of its development facilities on 27 August 2004.\nRod Cousens and Barry Jafrato, who served as chief executive officer and head of publishing for Acclaim, respectively, announced in September 2004 that they were planning to create Exclaim as a new video game publisher with the help of Europlay Capital Advisers. Exclaim was set to acquire and reinstantiate Acclaim's two UK studios, namely Manchester and Cheltenham, and re-employ their roughly 160 previous members. Exclaim's opening was expected on 11 October, however, Cousen's ownership over the two studios was challenged by Acclaim's liquidator, Allan Mendelsohn, leaving the UK staff in a state of limbo. A successor to Acclaim Studios Manchester, SilverBack Studios, was founded by Jon Oldham in April 2005 and employed 15 former Acclaim Studios Manchester staff.\nGames\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ As Software Creations\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Platforms\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1988\n| ''Aigina's Prophecy\n| Commodore 64\n|-\n| Bionic Commando\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 1989\n| Ghouls 'n Ghosts\n|-\n| Plotting\n| Amiga, Atari ST\n|-\n| World Games\n| rowspan=\"11\"| NES\n|-\n| Sky Shark\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1990\n| Magic Johnson's Fast Break\n|-\n| Target: Renegade\n|-\n| Solstice\n|-\n| Pictionary\n|-\n| Silver Surfer\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 1991\n| Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n|-\n| The NewZealand Story\n|-\n| Wolverine\n|-\n| Tom and Jerry (and Tuffy)\n|-\n| Altered Space\n| Game Boy\n|-\n| Gauntlet III: The Final Quest\n| Amiga, Atari ST\n|-\n| Treasure Master\n| rowspan=\"2\" | NES\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1992\n| Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n|-\n| Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge\n| Super NES, Genesis, Game Gear\n|-\n| Double Dragon 3: The Arcade Game\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Genesis\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 1993\n| Blaster Master 2\n|-\n| Disney's Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Quest\n|-\n| Disney's Beauty and the Beast: Roar of the Beast\n|-\n| Plok!\n| Genesis (cancelled), Super NES\n|-\n| The Incredible Crash Dummies\n| NES, Game Boy\n|-\n| Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends\n| NES (cancelled), Super NES\n|-\n| Equinox (Solstice 2)\n| Super NES\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1994\n| Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Genesis, Super NES\n|-\n| The Tick\n|-\n| Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball\n| Super NES\n|-\n| The Simpsons: Bart and the Beanstalk\n| Game Boy\n|-\n| Tin Star\n| Super NES\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1995\n| Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety\n| Genesis, Super NES\n|-\n| Foreman for Real\n| Super NES\n|-\n| Mortal Kombat 3\n| Game Boy, Game Gear, Master System\n|-\n| 1996\n| Cutthroat Island\n| Super NES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1997\n| Hexen: Beyond Heretic\n| Nintendo 64\n|-\n| Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98\n| Nintendo 64, PlayStation\n|-\n| 1998\n| The Rugrats Movie\n| Game Boy, Game Boy Color\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1999\n| Carmageddon 64\n| Nintendo 64\n|-\n| NASCAR 2000\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Game Boy Color\n|-\n| Boarder Zone\n|-\n| Rugrats: Time Travelers\n|-\n| Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2000\n| Nicktoons Racing\n| Windows, PlayStation, Arcade\n|-\n| NASCAR Racers\n| Windows\n|-\n| Rugrats in Paris: The Movie\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Game Boy Color\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2001\n| The Simpsons: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror\n|-\n| Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Game Boy Advance\n|-\n| Rugrats: Castle Capers\n|-\n| 2023\n| Moto-X\n| Super NES\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| Barbie: Vacation Adventure\n| Super NES, Genesis\n|-\n| Spiral Saga\n| PlayStation\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ As Creations\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Platforms\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 2002\n| The Ripping Friends\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Game Boy Advance\n|-\n| All-Star Baseball 2003\n|-\n| 2002 FIFA World Cup\n| GameCube, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox\n|-\n| Stuart Little 2\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Game Boy Advance\n|-\n| Super Monkey Ball Jr.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ As Acclaim Studios Manchester\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Platforms\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2003\n| Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance\n| PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox\n|-\n| All-Star Baseball 2004\n| Game Boy Advance\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| Interview with a Made Man\n| PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox\n|-\n| ATV Quad Power Racing 3''\n| PlayStation 2, Xbox\n|}\nReferences"
