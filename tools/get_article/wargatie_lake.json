Wargatie Lake also supports a large population of the northern leopard frog, a Species of Special Concern in Canada; the lake is believed to provide an overwintering habitat for the frogs.\nHydronymy\nThe lake was named for the family of Onofrey Wargatie, whose 1910 homestead was located nearby. Members of the family were deaf-mute, leading to the original name, Dummy Lake. In 2000, the derogatory name was rescinded and replaced with the current name, which \"commemorates the family more appropriately.\"\n}}\nBibliography\n*  |url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/rncan-nrcan/M86-3-1999.pdf}}\n*  |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/geographicalname0000unse }}"
