She has the saint say, \"Oh, subjects rebellious, Oh Venta depraved/ When once we are buried you think we are dead/ But behold me Immortal. --By vice you're enslaved/ You have sinn'd & must suffer...Ye cannot but know my command o'er July,/ Henceforward I'll triumph in shewing my powers,/ Shift your race as you will it shall never be dry/ The curse upon Venta is July in showers.\" Jane Austen died three days after writing this poem, and was shortly thereafter buried in St. Swithin's Cathedral, Winchester.\n* \"St Swithin's Day\", a song by Billy Bragg from the 1984 album Brewing Up with Billy Bragg\n* In The Sopranos episode House Arrest, Junior Soprano asks Bobby in reference to him getting his garbage disposal fixed, ''\"When? St. Swithun's Day?\"''\n* Bart refers to \"St Swithin's Day\" in a play he wrote in \"Bart of Darkness,\" Season 6, Episode 1 of The Simpsons.\n* \"St. Swithun's\" is the Wayne Foundation funded-orphanage that raised the orphan patrolman John Blake in The Dark Knight Rises.  The naming of an orphanage after St. Swithun is a reference to his restoring \"broken eggs\" in regards to \"broken children\".\n* In David Nicholls novel One Day, each chapter covers the lives of two protagonists on St Swithin's Day every year over a twenty year period.\n* The Barony of St. Swithin's Bog, a chapter of the Society for Creative Anachronism based in Johnstown, PA, was named after the saint.\nReferences"
