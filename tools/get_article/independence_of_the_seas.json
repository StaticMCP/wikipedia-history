The captain notified Royal Caribbean, which transferred NOK600,000 to cover port fees in less than an hour. The ship was then allowed to depart.\nOn December 11, 2017, 332 of 5,547 passengers became sick with a gastrointestinal illness (believed to be norovirus-related) after the ship had departed from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for a five-night Caribbean cruise.
