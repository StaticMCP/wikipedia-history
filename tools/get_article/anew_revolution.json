The band released a five-track self-released EP in 2005 featuring the tracks \"Cave In\", \"Rise\", \"Let Go\", \"Saddest Song\", and \"Pieces\". In 2007 the band recorded several tracks performed at a live show held at The Machine Shop in Flint, Michigan, and released a four-track CD which included new tracks \"Bite My Tongue\", \"Savior\", and \"Blister & Burn\". Anew Revolution officially signed a worldwide record deal with Koch Records in late August 2007.\nRise (2008–2010)\nOn April 15, 2008, ANR released their first full-length album, Rise, produced by Mudrock (Godsmack, Avenged Sevenfold). Tighter, heavier and more dynamic than the previous recordings, Rise features crowd favorites such as \"Done\", \"Rise\", \"Generation\".\niMerica (2010–2012)\nAnew Revolution released their second studio record entitled iMerica May 18, 2010, via E1 Music. Produced by Ben Schigel, a musician, record producer and vocalist from the band Switched who has produced for such bands as Drowning Pool, Walls of Jericho, Chimaira and many more. This album was a graduation, of sorts, for Anew Revolution, Salvaggio saying, \"We always project ourselves as an intense, driving band live. When we first started, we were finding our identity, from the EP to the first album, which was us finding our pocket. The birth of this album is where we are going to go and we know we can keep going\". iMerica featured a darker side to ANR with the crowd anthem \"Head Against The Wall\", and intense, darker sounding tracks like \"Crucify\" and \"Social Suicide\"\nNew music (2012–2014)\nIn May 2012, Anew Revolution started a Kickstarter campaign to finance a new studio album, videos, artworks and other costs without having to rely on record labels. Surpassing their initial goal of $3,000 they raised a total amount of $5,352.\nIn July 2012, rewards were sent to Kickstarter backers including the new acoustic EP Unplugged, several unreleased tracks and autographed merchandise. The unreleased songs included \"Blister & Burn\", \"Creep\", \"Bite My Tongue\" as well as \"Dead and Crazy\".\nOn November 10, 2013, ANR announced to release their new album in 2014. On August 4, 2014, the band reported to have finished work on new songs. Four songs were distributed digitally by email to Kickstarter backers only.\n# \"Crazy\" – 3:11\n# \"Slow\" – 3:51\n# \"My Reality\" – 3:17\n# \"Haunt\" – 3:48\nTo date, there has not been word about a public release or hard copies.
