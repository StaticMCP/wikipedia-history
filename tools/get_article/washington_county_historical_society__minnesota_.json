Its mission is to collect, preserve, and share the history of Washington County, Minnesota.\nHistory\nAn article in the Stillwater Daily Sun of December 17, 1881, first proposed the idea of a Stillwater Historical Society, emphasizing the importance of establishing it promptly to facilitate its future work.

The Washington County Historical Society operated from a room at the Stillwater Public Library, collecting county-wide documents, photos, and family histories.\nIn 1941, the Society purchased the Warden's House Museum in Stillwater from the state, one of the state's oldest buildings and its second oldest continuously operating house museum. The Society also acquired the Hay Lake School in 1974, the Johannes Erickson Log House in the early 1980s. All three buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic family-owned Boutwell Cemetery was purchased in 1978.\nIn 1996, the Society undertook the reconstruction of the Carriage House that originally stood behind the Warden's House. By 2001, climate control had been added, allowing for the safe storage of the textile collection and archives in the new facility.\nThe most recent project involved the opening of the new Washington County Heritage Center in Stillwater, Minnesota.

The Heritage Center explores both the history of Stillwater and the broader story of Washington County and the St. Croix Valley.\nWhile not itself a historic structure, the repurposed building offered the expansive space needed for exhibits and visitor amenities.
