The Cossacks destroyed a powerful garrison.\nPrelude\nHetman Petro Sahaidachny likely set out from Zaporozhian Sich in June 1618, leading about 20,000 Zaporozhians. Earlier, some Cossack regiments, under the guise of preparing for an expedition, entered the Kiev Voivodeship and severely plundered its inhabitants. Only the threat of using the crown's troops against them made the unruly Cossacks stop the rapes.\nBattle\nThe first Russian city that the Zaporozhians attacked was Livny. Cossacks of Petro Sahaidachny suddenly attacked the city on July 7, Saturday. His defenders tried to resist. Local voivodes Nikita Cherkassky and Pyotr Danilov even led their warriors on a sortie that proved fatal for them: P. Danilov was killed, and N. Cherkassky was captured. By one o'clock in the afternoon, Livny fell. After capturing Livny, the Zaporozhians killed or captured nearly all local residents and then settled in the fortress and in the surrounding settlements. On July 10, the Cossacks left Livny, preparing to march on other Russian cities.\nNotes\nReferences"
