Several members of the Ohio General Assembly were accused of taking bribes in 1911. Turner and Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan investigated.

He won election November 4, 1940, to the two remaining years of the term, and re-election in 1942 and 1948 to six year terms.\nTurner served until his death September 13, 1950, after suffering a stroke.
