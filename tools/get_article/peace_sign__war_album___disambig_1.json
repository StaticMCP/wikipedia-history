      "text": "# Peace Sign (War album)__disambig_1\n\n☮ is an album by War, released on Avenue Records (distributed by Rhino Records) in 1994.  Its title is a graphic of the peace symbol.  It is often referred to as Peace Sign, the title of the first track, though arguably it could also be called Peace, the antonym of the group's name.  It was released as a CD and also as a double LP, the latter containing an extra track titled \"Africa\", and a shorter version of \"Peace Sign\".\nThis was their first non-compilation album in over a decade, during which time the group had toured sporadically.  Most living original members appeared on the album, B.B. Dickerson (bass) being the only exception; but Lee Oskar (harmonica) is not credited as a group member, and only makes a guest appearance on two songs.  Another former member Pat Rizzo (saxophone) also makes a guest appearance on the same songs where Oskar appears.  Some of the official members of this album's nine-person lineup made somewhat minimal contributions: Ron Hammon is only credited with providing \"drum fills\" on two songs, while Rae Valentine is mainly credited with \"music programming\".  Only five group members contributed to more than half of the songs, and Lonnie Jordan (keyboards) is the only one who plays on every song (Valentine contributing music programming to all but one).  The album carries a dedication to War's deceased members, Papa Dee Allen (congas) and Charles Miller (saxophone).\nThis album's lineup toured to promote the album, then broke up in 1996 when most of the original members wished to gain independence from producer Jerry Goldstein, who owned the group's name, and created a new group called Lowrider Band.  Goldstein then created a new version of War with Lonnie Jordan as the only remaining original member.\nA 12-inch single was released with four versions of \"Peace Sign\".  Another track, \"I'm the One (Who Understands)\", is a re-recording of a song from The Music Band (1979).  José Feliciano makes a guest appearance on \"East L.A.\".\nTrack listing\nSide one\n#\"Peace Sign\" (Howard E.
