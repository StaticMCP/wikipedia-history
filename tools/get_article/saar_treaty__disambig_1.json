The treaty was signed in Luxembourg on 27 October 1956, by foreign ministers Heinrich von Brentano of West Germany and Christian Pineau of France, following the Saar Statute referendum on 23 October 1955, which resulted in a majority vote against the Saar Statute.\nAfter the Landtag declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), the incorporation of the Saarland was finalised on 1 January 1957. Both involved parties agreed on an economic transition period through 1959, during which the Saarland remained under French control.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.verfassungen.de/de/saar/vertrag56.htm Saar Treaty]\n* [http://www.cvce.eu/en/collections/unit-content/-/unit/02bb76df-d066-4c08-a58a-d4686a3e68ff/556cb8ea-3962-4e8c-9b1d-397f4f769404 The Saar question] on CVCE website"
