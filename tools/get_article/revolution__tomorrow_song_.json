It was first released as a single in the UK by Parlophone in September 1967. The song also appeared on the group's self-titled album Tomorrow in February 1968. \"Revolution\" was written by Keith Alan Hopkins (better known as Keith West) and Steve Howe. It failed to break the music charts.\nSeveral different recordings of the song have been released by Tomorrow. The 1999 CD reissue of Tomorrow also includes a previously unreleased studio demo recording of the song. This version does not have the orchestral overdubs but instead has some phasing effects not heard in the later recording. Both were recorded at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London in mid 1967. Tomorrow performed this song for John Peel's radio show on the BBC, and there is also a live recording on the album 50 Minute Technicolor Dream.\nAllMusic writer Richie Unterberger called \"Revolution\" an \"infectious hippie anthem\".\nReferences"
