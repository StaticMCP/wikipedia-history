      "text": "# Warhammer Army Book\n\nThe following is a list of Army Books and Supplements for the various armies released for the Games Workshop Warhammer Fantasy Battle game.\nAn Army Book in the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop wargame, is a rules supplement containing information concerning a particular army, environment, or worldwide campaign.\nArmy Books for particular armies were introduced for the fourth edition of the game (prior to that all armies were included in the main rulebook). The sixth edition rendered these obsolete. Until superseded by newer versions, the 6th edition and later books remain valid for the newer editions of Warhammer.\nGames Workshop has also released various expansions over the years, including a siege rules supplement and campaign expansions.  Expansions and Supplements may or may not be valid over multiple editions, though generally they cycle similarly to the Army Books.\nAn Army Book normally contains:\n* Background - Information about the race and its place in the Warhammer world. This includes artwork, short stories, maps, timelines and copies of fictional documents.\n* Bestiary - A list of the units, characters and war machines that can be chosen for use in a battle. This includes their characteristic values, information on their weapon options, and any limitations on their use, as well as background information on each unit. An Army's special magic lore (if applicable) and special magic items are listed here.\n* Hobby section - Information on collecting, building and painting an army from the army book. This features outstanding example models painted by the Games Workshop 'Eavy Metal Team as well as Games Workshop's Army Painters and veteran hobbyists.\n* Army List - Each entry from the bestiary is arranged by type (Lord, Hero, Core, Special, Rare) and given a points value, with more powerful units costing more points, so that battles are fought between balanced armies.  Options and costs are listed here.\nCurrent Books\nWarhammer: The Old World\nIn January 2024 Warhammer Fantasy Battle was rebranded as Warhammer: The Old World\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=center\n|- style=\"color:white; background:#8A2BE2;\"\n|Army||ISBN||Release Date\n|-\n|Arcane Journal: Beastmen Brayherds\n|\n|June 2025\n|-\n||Arcane Journal: Wood Elf Realms||||June 2025\n|-\n||Arcane Journal: High Elf Realms||||March 2025\n|-\n|Arcane Journal: Empire of Man||||January 2025\n|-\n|Arcane Journal: Warriors of Chaos||||September 2024\n|-\n|Arcane Journal: Dwarfen Mountain Holds||||August 2024\n|-\n|Arcane Journal: Orc & Goblin Tribes||||May 2024\n|-\n|Arcane Journal: Tomb Kings of Khemri||||January 2024\n|-\n|Arcane Journal: Kingdom of Bretonnia||||January 2024\n|-\n|Forces of Fantasy||||January 2024\n|-\n|Ravening Hordes||||January 2024\n|}\nPrevious Edition Warhammer Army Books\nStarting with the 4th edition rules, individual Army books were published for various races and realms of the Warhammer world that had coinciding miniatures armies to play the Warhammer Fantasy Battles tabletop game.
