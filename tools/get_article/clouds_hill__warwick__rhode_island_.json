Its stand on the estate formerly known as Cedar Hill, a country estate built 1871-77 as a wedding present for Elizabeth Ives Slater Reed by her father, William S. Slater.  The main mansion, designed by noted Providence architect William R. Walker, is a large Gothic Revival structure and one of his few surviving large-scale residential designs.  The Slaters and Reeds, prominent industrial textile magnates in Rhode Island, adorned the property with high quality Victorian-era workmanship, including a distinctive Egyptian-themed room.  The estate, occupied by four generations of Reed descendants, was converted to a museum in 2004 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.  The Clouds Hill Victorian House Museum is open by appointment, or when events are scheduled.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Rhode Island\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Kent County, Rhode Island\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cloudshill.org Official Website]\nReferences"
