Cass won the state with a margin of 1.60%. As of 2024, this is the last election in which Morgan County, now part of West Virginia, voted for the Democratic candidate.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | United States presidential election in Virginia, 1848\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Lewis Cass\n| align=\"right\" | 46,739\n| align=\"right\" | 50.80%\n| align=\"right\" | 17\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0C862; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Whig\n| Zachary Taylor\n| align=\"right\" | 45,265\n| align=\"right\" | 49.20%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 92,004\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 17\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
