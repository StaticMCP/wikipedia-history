Debuting in the Port Adelaide Football Club's inaugural 1997 AFL side, Kingsley was known as a consistent defender/midfielder.\nHe struggled in 2003, coming close to being delisted, but improved his form and cemented a spot during 2004, being a premiership player that year after working his way back into the side.\n2005 saw another consistent season from Kingsley, however, he played just five games in 2006, which cast doubts over his career. In his fifth game in Round 22, he injured his anterior cruciate ligament, which forced his retirement. He said in The Age on 12 September 2006, that he had hoped to continue playing in 2007 before the injury.\nKingsley played a total of 170 games and kicked a total of 47 goals for Port Adelaide from 1997 until 2006, and was a member of the Port Adelaide premiership side in 2004.\nCoaching career\nAssistant coaching (2007–2022)\nIn 2007, Kingsley became an assistant coach at Port Adelaide, a position in which he stayed in until the end of 2010. He then joined St Kilda at the end of the 2010 season as an assistant coach, staying at the club until 2018 before joining  as an assistant coach in 2019.\nGreater Western Sydney senior coach (2023–present)\nKingsley was appointed senior coach of  on 22 August 2022. Kingsley replaced GWS caretaker senior coach Mark McVeigh, who coached the Giants after Leon Cameron stepped down in the middle of the 2022 season.\nHis first match in charge, in round one, 2023, saw the Giants come from 31 points down to defeat  by 16 points, while losing three players to game-ending injuries, in a match played in 36-degree heat. Despite having a win-loss record of 3-7 after round 10, the Giants won 8 of their last 10 matches to finish seventh and earn Kingsley a finals berth in his first year as coach. The Giants defeated  by 24 points in an elimination final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in what was also the club's first final at the ground since the 2019 Grand Final; this was followed by a win over  by 23 points at Adelaide Oval which saw them advance to a preliminary final where they eventually lost to  by one point at the MCG.
