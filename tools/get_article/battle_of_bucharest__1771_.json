It occurred when the Ottomans tried to recapture Bucharest from the Russians.\nIn the summer of 1771, Russia launched an offensive against the Turkish positions along the Danube, attacking Giurgiu, but this turned out to be unsuccessful and the initiative in actions passed to the Ottomans.\nBy autumn, Ottoman forces along the Danube were ready to invade Wallachia, where the Russians had a limited number of soldiers. Nevertheless, they were defeated in the subsequent battle of Bucharest and retreated.\nBackground\nPrevious events\nIn the winter of 1771, the Russians invaded the right bank of the Danube and occupied the city of Giurgiu, leaving a small garrison there. This garrison could not resist the siege of the Turks in May and surrendered the city. The new commander of the Bucharest division, Reinhold Essen, tried to recapture the city in August, though unsuccessfully due to his small force.\nPlans and forces of the parties\nThe Ottomans assembled an army of between 37,000 and 48,000 to completely occupy Wallachia. They were to be opposed by one division under the command of  which had 13,000 men available.\nBattle\nGeneral Reinhold Essen arranged his infantry in three squares between which he placed the cavalry.  The Turks were slowly advancing towards the Russian positions and Essen himself ordered an attack. The Ottomans, who did not expect the attack of the Russian troops, were confused, but then counterattacked with their cavalry. Part of their forces moved from the front, and the others began to carry out a flank raid on Bucharest, which was left almost without cover. Having bypassed the positions of Essen, the Turkish cavalry crossed to the left bank of the Dâmbovița River and rushed towards Bucharest. This maneuver was noticed in a timely manner. Shortly thereafter, a detachment of Ivan Gudovich with artillery repulsed the attack of the Turkish cavalry. Having secured himself from the left flank, Essen attacked the Turkish retrenchment with three squares. In the course of a joint infantry and cavalry attack supported by artillery, as well as a detour from the left flank of Kantemir, the Turkish infantry was knocked out of the fortification and fled.\nAftermath\nThe Russians casualties were 55 dead and 199 wounded, whereas the Turkish casualties were 2,000 dead and 350 prisoners, of which 200 were Serbs, Bulgarians and Bosniaks. Despite the victory, Essen was unable to organize a normal pursuit to inflict even more damage, but he was able to march all the way to Giurgiu, which he had unsuccessfully stormed earlier. The Russians took 50 guns in the city and occupies it.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
