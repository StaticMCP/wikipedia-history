Sieur de La Vérendrye built the first fur trading post on the site (Fort Rouge), which was later abandoned. The French traded in the area for several decades before Hudson's Bay Company traders arrived.\n*1767 – The first English traders visited the area about the year 1767.\n19th century\n*1800s – Lord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century.\n*1809 – Fort Gibraltar was built by the North West Company.\n*1812 – Fort Douglas was built by the Hudson's Bay Company.\n*1818 – The Catholic Church sent two missionaries, Norbert Provencher and Sévère Dumoulin, to the forks of the Assiniboine River and the Red River of the North. Their objective was to establish a permanent mission and to convert local Indigenous peoples.\n*1821 – The Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company ended their long rivalry with a merger. The two companies fought fiercely over trade in the area, and each destroyed some of the other's forts throughout several battles.\n*1822 – Fort Gibraltar, at the site of present-day Winnipeg, was renamed Fort Garry and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company.\n*1826 – 1826 Red River flood destroys Fort Gibraltar, and it was not rebuilt until 1835. The fort was the residence of the Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company for many years.\n*1869–70 – Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and the newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the rebellion. This rebellion led directly to the Manitoba Act and Manitoba's entry into the Confederation as Canada's fifth province in 1870.\n*1873 – On November 8, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city.\n*1874 – On January 5, Francis Evans Cornish, former mayor of London, Ontario, defeated Winnipeg Free Press editor and owner William F. Luxton by a margin of 383 votes to 179. There were only 382 eligible voters in the city at the time, but property owners were allowed to vote in every civic poll in which they owned property. Until 1955, mayors could only serve one term. City government consisted of 13 aldermen and one mayor; this number of elected officials remained constant until 1920.\n*1875 – Construction of a new City Hall commenced.

The Manitoba Legislature was built in the neoclassical style that is common to many other North American state and provincial legislative buildings of the 19th century and early 20th century.
