Its governor was Mao Zemin, the younger brother of Mao Zedong. It was involved in providing mortgage, loaning, saving, billing, and government bond services, and was responsible for issuing banknotes and coins in the CCP's controlled territory from 1932 to 1937.\nHistory\nThe bank was established in Ruijin, Jiangxi, on 1 February 1932. From 1935 to 1936 it was gradually moved to Shanbei along with the Red Army and renamed to the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank – Northwest Branch.
