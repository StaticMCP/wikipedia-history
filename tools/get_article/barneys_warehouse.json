Barneys Warehouse was owned by Barneys New York and began in 1970 as a semi-annual sale that offered large discounts on designer clothing. Barneys Warehouse had 11 brick and mortar stores and launched an e-commerce [http://www.barneyswarehouse.com/ website] in 2013. Barneys Warehouse offered deals up to 75% off retail prices from luxury designers such as Marni, Derek Lam, Proenza Schouler, Rag & Bone, Chloé, Isabel Marant, John Varvatos, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Marc by Marc Jacobs. Barneys Warehouse closed following the 2019 bankruptcy of Barneys New York.\nThe First Barneys Warehouse Sale\nIn August 1970, the idea for the first Barneys Warehouse Sale was born. To generate both extra revenue and advertising, as well as to move through inventory, Barneys would host a clearance event in the   first floor of the warehouse building in Chelsea. The first sale ran from September 8, 1970 to September 12, 1970.\nThe advertising for the first Barneys Warehouse Sale put a focus on the need to sell the past season's inventory. This was to excite customers about the new merchandise that would eventually take the old inventory's place. Advertisements also promoted that only certain quantities were available for specific designers.\nOn September 8, the first day of the Barneys Warehouse Sale, a full-page advertisement with the headline \"Don't Go to Work Today\" ran in both The New York Times and The New York Daily News.\nThere were many radio advertisements throughout the course of the sale, and these changed by the day to portray a sense of urgency to the potential customers.\nThe first Barneys Warehouse Sale sold over 30,000 units of designer clothing, served approximately 20,000 customers, and generated $1,108,500 in sales.\nThe Transition\nIn September 1971, the Barneys Second Annual Warehouse Sale was held. To promote the second sale, advertisements portrayed the great designer deals that customers were able to receive at the first sale. In 1995, the first Barneys New York Outlet opened.\nThe semi-annual Barneys Warehouse Sale was held for 42 consecutive years at the Chelsea warehouse location. The Barneys Warehouse Sale expanded to other markets such as Chicago and Los Angeles.
