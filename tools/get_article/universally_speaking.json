It was the fourth and final single from the album and was released solely in Europe and Australia in mid-2003. The track was also included on their live album Red Hot Chili Peppers Live in Hyde Park and their Greatest Hits album.\nSong information\nXFM online said \"Universally Speaking\" is a \"fairly upbeat rock ode\" and Rolling Stone said it was \"Beatlesque psychedelia\". The cover for the single is the same as the cover of the By the Way album, except the colors are reverted to normal.\nMusic video\nThe video for the song features Dave Sheridan, who plays a deranged concertgoer who attempts to return a book to vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who left the book in his taxi in the video to \"By the Way\". After numerous failed attempts, he successfully returns the book to the frontman by going on stage while the band performs Suck My Kiss. The book he is returning to Kiedis is \"Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs\", which is the biography of Darby Crash, the late frontman for the late-1970s punk band the Germs and was written by Brendan Mullen. The music video was directed by longtime friend Dick Rude who also directed the video for \"Catholic School Girls Rule\" and the live DVD Off the Map.\nLive performances\n\"Universally Speaking\" was performed regularly on the By the Way Tour. However, it was dropped for the Stadium Arcadium Tour before making a comeback on the I'm with You World Tour. It has since been performed regularly.\nCover version\nIn July 2021, singer-songwriter Ava Maybee, who is the daughter of drummer Chad Smith, posted a cover version of \"Universally Speaking\" to her Instagram page.\nTrack listings\nCD version 1\n# \"Universally Speaking\" (John Frusciante single mix) – 4:18\n# \"By the Way\" (live acoustic) – 4:59\n# \"Don't Forget Me\" (live) – 5:07\nCD version 2\n# \"Universally Speaking\" (John Frusciante single mix) – 4:20\n# \"Slowly Deeply\" (previously unreleased) – 2:40\n# \"Universally Speaking\" (enhanced video)\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2003 weekly chart performance for \"Universally Speaking\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2003)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=row|Croatia International Airplay (Top lista)\n|6\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|89\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nMonthly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2025 monthly chart performance for \"Universally Speaking\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Russia Streaming (TopHit)\n| 94\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release history and formats for \"Universally Speaking\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|June 16, 2003\n|rowspan=\"2\"|CD\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Warner Bros.\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n|July 7, 2003\n|align=\"center\"|\n|}\nReferences"
