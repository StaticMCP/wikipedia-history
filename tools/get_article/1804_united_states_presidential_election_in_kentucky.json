Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. Kentucky had gained four electors compared to the previous election in 1800.\nKentucky cast eight electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent President Thomas Jefferson over the Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Jefferson's running mate George Clinton from New York. The state was divided into two electoral districts with four electors each, whereupon each district's voters chose the electors.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1804 United States presidential election in Kentucky\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| Thomas Jefferson (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 5,080\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Federalist\n| Charles Cotesworth Pinckney\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n| align=\"right\" | 0.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 5,080\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nReferences"
