The first ever award was presented to Baby D, in the Best Dance Act category. The inaugural awards were broadcast by Carlton Television from London's Connaught Rooms.\nIn 2009, the ceremony was held for the first time in Glasgow. Prior to that, it had been held in London. In 2011, the ceremony returned for a second time to Scotland. The awards then moved to Leeds for the first time in 2015 and returned there in 2017 before going on hiatus the following year. In 2020 it was confirmed it would be returning later that year, however for the first time ever it would be live streamed on YouTube. For the first time, Sheffield hosted in 2024 with Newcastle announced as the 2025 host city. In September 2025, Manchester was announced as next year's host city.\nAcross its history, the MOBOs have been broadcast on Channel 4, BBC Television, ITV2, Channel 5 and BET before returning to the BBC in 2020.\nCeremonies\nThe ceremony was first broadcast regionally on Carlton Television from 1996 to 1997, before airing nationwide on Channel 4 from 1998 until 2003. From 2004 to 2013, they were aired by the BBC; beginning in 2006, the show aired live on BBC Three, and highlights aired on BBC One.\nIn 2014, the BBC dropped the MOBO Awards, and the ceremony moved to ITV under a three-year deal, airing on ITV2 with same-night highlights on ITV.\nIn 2017, the ceremony moved to Channel 5 and BET.\nIn 2018, the MOBO Organisation announced that the ceremony would take a one-year hiatus in order to plan a \"bigger, revamped show\" in 2019. However, the show did not materialise, with organisers now planning to hold the ceremony in 2020 instead; Kanya King stated that there would be \"positive changes\" to the show, and that they would be \"returning with even more determination and energy to support and boost our culture wherever we can.\"\nTable summary\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

In 2003, a boycott effort emerged after the American pop musicians Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera won the awards for Best R&B Act and Best Video respectively. The Independent described the wins as being the result of the \"white appropriation of black music\". A MOBO spokesperson defended their presence, stating that the awards were designed to honour achievements in music of black origin, regardless of the ethnicity of their performers, and cited the increasing worldwide growth of urban music at the time.\nIn 2006, DJ and music journalist Bigger wrote that the presentation had been \"veering away from its concept of rewarding music of black origin\" as early as its third edition, noting its increasing dominance by American acts at the expense of domestic acts. He argued that the show had become \"little more than a pat on the back and a jolly boys' outing for major labels and American acts.\"\nIn 2011, Lanre Bakare wrote in The Guardian that the show was being affected by the music industry's dilution of the distinctive black music scene, promoting it to mainstream audiences as popular music (including \"manufactured\", U.S.-style hip-hop and R&B). In the column, it was noted that Labrinth had criticized the nominations of Conor Maynard and Ed Sheeran for awards, while Charlie Dark of Attica Blues argued that the MOBOs needed to promote innovation in black music, and \"shouldn't be an annual event where everyone pats themselves on the back for very small advances that they've made, when they are powerful enough to bring real change. If they don't adapt, artists who aren't interested in commercial pop and being put in musical boxes will just do their own thing.\"\nIn 2020, English rock duo Nova Twins wrote an open letter on Twitter addressed to the MOBOs concerning the lack of a Rock/Alternative category, despite the fact that many POC have contributed to the evolution of rock music, and still are to this day, and hoping \"that a Rock/Alternative category will be added to the MOBO (Music of Black Origin) Awards in 2021, recognising the POC contributors to the genre\". The MOBOS later replied on Twitter that \"the MOBO Awards Judging Panel have actually discussed this and ... will continue to review potential category expansions for future Award ceremonies.\"\nSee also\n*British Black music\n*UK gospel\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7WAX3zRmR0 Kanya King talks about setting up the MOBO awards].
