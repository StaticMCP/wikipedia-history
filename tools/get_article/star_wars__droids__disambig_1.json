It focuses on the exploits of droids R2-D2 and  between the events of Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. The series was produced by Nelvana on behalf of Lucasfilm and broadcast on ABC from September 7, 1985 to June 7, 1986, with its sister series Ewoks (as part of The Ewoks and Droids Adventure Hour).\nThe series ran for one season of 13 half-hour episodes; an hour-long special broadcast in 1986 serves as the finale.\nThe opening theme, \"In Trouble Again\", was performed by Stewart Copeland of the Police. During their adventures, the droids find themselves in the service of successive new masters. The original trilogy characters Boba Fett and IG-88 appear in one episode apiece.\nPremise\nDroids follows the adventures of R2-D2 and  as they face off against gangsters, criminals, pirates, bounty hunters, the Galactic Empire and other threats. During their adventures, the droids find themselves in the service of successive new masters and in difficult situations as a result.\nThe series was retroactively placed two years after Revenge of the Sith and fifteen years before the events of A New Hope. In the latter film,  tells Luke Skywalker that his and R2-D2's \"last master was Captain Antilles.\" The droids are placed in Antilles' care by Bail Organa at the end of Revenge of the Sith, creating an apparent continuity error. This is explained by the droids being accidentally separated from Antilles during the events of the animated series.\nCast and characters\nSeries Cast\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO\n* Jan Austin as Auren Yomm\n* Long John Baldry as Proto-1 and The Great Heep\n* Melleny Brown as Darva\n* Donny Burns as Zebulon Dak and Kleb Zellock\n* George Buza as Boba Fett and Doodnik\n* Graeme Campbell as Lord Toda and Admiral Screed\n* Milan Cheylov as Jann Tosh\n* Rob Cowan as Gaff and Krox\n* Jamie Dick as Coby Toda\n* Lesleh Donaldson as Kea Moll\n* Cree Summer Francks as Princess Gerrin\n* Don Francks as Kybo Ren and Governor Koong\n* Maurice Godin as Tig Fromm\n* Marvin Goldhar as Vlix\n* Graham Haley as BL-17\n* Dan Hennessey as Jord Dusat, Uncle Gundy, Vinga, Yorpo, Captain Cag, and Announcer\n* Pam Hyatt as Bola Yomm\n* Taborah Johnson as Jessica Meade\n* Michael Kirby as Sise Fromm and Bun-Dingo\n* Michel LeFebvre as Kez-Iba and Mon-Julpa\n* Peter MacNeill as Nilz Yomm\n* J.

Several episodes were written by Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt. Hanho Heung-Up Co. was the Korean studio hired to animate the series.\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC bought the rights to broadcast the series in its entirety between 1986 and 1991 as part of its Children's BBC programming strand. The entire series was shown twice within this time (in 1986 and 1988 to coincide with the full release of the Star Wars trilogy as well as Droids on VHS). The Great Heep only made one showing in 1989 on the BBC's Saturday morning children's show Going Live! — it was split into two parts over two weeks. Different episodes from different cycles were also screened across the five-year licence, with the Trigon cycle being shown in full in early 1991 on another BBC Saturday morning children's show called The 8:15 from Manchester.\nThe opening theme, \"In Trouble Again\", was performed by Stewart Copeland of the Police and written by him and Derek Holt.\nThe series was broadcast in the U.S. on ABC with its sister series Ewoks (as part of The Ewoks and Droids Adventure Hour). It debuted in 1985 as part of a fitness special hosted by Tony Danza and live-action versions of the droids. It ran for one season of 13 half-hour episodes; an hour-long special broadcast in 1986 serves as the finale. Droids and Ewoks were later shown in reruns on Sci-Fi Channel's Cartoon Quest in 1996, although somewhat edited for time.\nIn the UK, this series, along with Ewoks, was released on VHS as part of a promotion with Dairylea Cheese. Families could send in empty packages of the cheese and in return get one of six VHS tapes. These videotapes are now rare and sought after amongst collectors.\nEpisodes\nOver the course of the series, the droids team up with three different sets of masters. The series falls into three cycles or arcs; the droids usually run into their new masters at the beginning of each, and at the end are forced to leave.\nThe Great Heep, a 48-minute television special following the series, is set before the final arc.\n|ShortSummary    = After being jettisoned over the deserts of Ingo by an unscrupulous former master, C-3PO and R2-D2 are taken in by speeder bike racers Jord Dusat and Thall Joben. Kea Moll sees them accidentally cross a restricted zone, and helps protect them from several deadly droids. One of gangster Tig Fromm's droids kidnaps Jord, and the droids assist Thall and Kea in rescuing Jord from Fromm's secret base, destroying much of his droid army in the process.\n|LineColor       = 87CEEB\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = After C-3PO lets the hyperdrive of Kea's starship float away into space, he, R2-D2, Jord, and Thall stay with Kea and her mother, Demma, on Annoo while trying to secure a new hyperdrive. The droids discover that Kea is a member of the Rebel Alliance. While Jord stays with Demma, Thall, Kea and the droids sneak onto the Fromm gang's ship in order to infiltrate the secret base on Ingo. There, they capture the Trigon One, a weaponized satellite created by the Fromm gang to take over the galactic quadrant.\n|LineColor       = 87CEEB\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = After the Fromm gang raids the speeder shop on Ingo and captures Thall, Kea and the droids, Tig reveals that he has kidnapped Jord and Demma, refusing to release them unless Thall reveals the location of the Trigon One. Thall does so, but the group is imprisoned with Jord—until the droids outsmart the guard. When Tig pilots the space weapon back to the base of his father, Sise, he discovers that its controls have been sabotaged and programmed to crash into the base. Jord goes to commandeer an escape ship while Thall and Kea rescue Demma, and the droids do what they can to help.\n|LineColor       = 87CEEB\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team goes to Boonta to take part in a speeder race, but is pursued by the Fromm gang and forced to crash land. Sise hires Boba Fett to help exact his revenge, despite Jabba the Hutt having placed a bounty on the crimelord. Tig plants a thermal detonator on the White Witch, and Fett chases Thall into the race. In the melee, the explosive is used to destroy Fett's speeder. The despondent bounty hunter rounds up the Fromms to take to Jabba. Thall, Jord and Kea are offered careers with a speeder corporation, but refuse when they realize that R2-D2 and  would have to be reprogrammed. The droids leave their masters so they can take the job.\n|LineColor       = 87CEEB\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = C-3PO, R2-D2, and their new master, Jann Tosh, befriend a mysterious alien disguised as a droid. Captured by crimelord Kleb Zellock, they are forced to mine , a valuable unstable mineral used in proton torpedoes, which Zellock plans to sell to the Empire. In the mines they meet Sollag, who identifies their friend as Mon Julpa, Prince of the Tammuz-an. Together they defeat the crimelord and escape the mines before they are destroyed in a  explosion.\n|LineColor       = 87CEEB\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The droids, Jann, Mon Julpa, and Sollag, along with freighter pilot Jessica Meade, travel to Tammuz-an to thwart Ko Zatec-Cha, an evil vizier with ambitions to seize the throne of the planet Tammuz-an. To achieve his sinister plans, Zatec-Cha hires bounty hunter IG-88 to capture Mon Julpa and his royal scepter, but the heroes manage to recover it, and Mon Julpa is made king of Tammuz-an.\n|LineColor       = 87CEEB\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = While delivering fuel to Tammuz-an, Jann, Jessica, and the droids are captured by the pirate Kybo Ren-Cha. Aboard his stolen Star Destroyer, Kybo Ren takes them to the water planet Tarnoonga. After the heroes escape a giant sea monster, Jann and the droids distract the pirates by going after a decoy while Jessica recaptures the real fuel. After Jann and the droids escape, Mon Julpa sends forces to capture Ren.\n|LineColor     = 87CEEB\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Kybo Ren is freed and he kidnaps Gerin, the daughter of Lord Toda, Mon Julpa's political rival. The droids, Jann, and Jessica go to the planet Bogden to rescue Gerin before Mon Julpa is handed over as ransom. Ren's men arrive with Julpa, but Lord Toda and a squad of Tammuz-an soldiers have smuggled aboard Ren's own ship. Ren is sent back to prison and an alliance is forged between Julpa and Toda.

Two action figures, Boba Fett and A-wing Pilot, were repackaged figures from the main Star Wars line. The toy line was canceled after the first group of 12 figures due to decreasing popularity with Star Wars. In 1987 and then 1988, Glasslite of Brazil issued remaining Kenner stock and produced a very limited run of remaining Return of the Jedi and Droids toys from a sell off. Certain vehicles, mini-rigs and action figures were issued by the company in new packaging. The character Vlix (Tig Fromm's henchman) was an action figure exclusive from unused molds by Kenner. Like the remainder of the Glasslite line, very few were made, even less were sold and most were recycled due to the failing economy when money was tight across the country. Vlix was the most valuable Star Wars action figure (at about $6,000 carded or $1,200 loose), until a Fett figure sold for £69,000 ($USD 92,000) at an auction.\nBetween 1985 and 1987, a number of episodes were adapted into children's storybooks.\nA computer game was released in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 by Mastertronic.\nIn 2021, for Lucasfilm's 50th anniversary, Hasbro released a Target-exclusive line of action figures based on the series, featuring the titular droid duo and Boba Fett. Fett was also released as a larger Black Series figure.\nComic book series\nIn 1986, Marvel's Star Comics imprint published a Star Wars: Droids comic series spun off from the cartoon. The  series ran for eight issues. Four issues and issue 5's cover of the series were drawn by John Romita, Sr. The \"Lost in Time\" crossover story from Droids #4 was continued in an issue of Ewoks. The last three issues are part of an arc recounting the original Star Wars film from the droids' point of view. Additionally, Spanish comics publisher Editorial Gepsa produced two-page Droids comics as part of an anthology series.\nOther Star Wars comics subtitled Droids have featured C-3PO and R2-D2, but not in direct connection with the series.\nHome media\nAlmost all episodes of the series (except \"Coby and the Starhunters\") were released on VHS in the 1980s and 1990s, most notably the UK PAL releases over four cassettes (Droids 1–3 and The Great Heep), which had the opening sequences and credits edited out. In 1996, Rick McCallum produced The Pirates and the Prince, a direct-to-video film compiled from four episodes. In late 2004, McCallum and Lucasfilm produced a DVD titled Star Wars: Animated Adventures – Droids, which featured The Pirates and the Prince and Treasure of the Hidden Planet, a new compilation film including narration from Mungo Baobab (voiced by Alex Lindsay). This was released by 20th Century Fox in 2005. Both titles included some soundtrack changes.\nOn April 2, 2021, it was announced that the entire series would be released on Disney+ later in 2021. All 13 episodes, along with the special, were added on June 18, 2021.\nReception\nAccording to David Perlmutter, compared with Ewoks, Droids \"was rudimentary, with short enough story lines for as many as four narratives in a single episode. Obviously, neither Lucas nor the animation studio had enough faith in the characters to trust them as anything other than second bananas.\" SyFy Wire writes that \"Droids struggles to find a way to make the duo's live-action antics as entertaining on the small screen as they are on the silver one; the show tries to serve up a very, very kid-friendly take on that galaxy far, far away and it doesn't always hit the mark.\" ComicBook.com calls it a \"must-watch\".\nLegacy\nBen Burtt wrote liner notes for the Shadows of the Empire soundtrack, which referenced the Roonstones he had written about in Droids; Burtt made a cameo appearance in Episode I – The Phantom Menace, and named his character after the Baobabs. Several references to the animated series are made in the prequels, such as the Boonta Eve Classic in The Phantom Menace, the planet Bogden and a four-armed cook in Attack of the Clones, and General Grievous' wheel bike design in Revenge of the Sith.\nGenndy Tartakovsky gave C-3PO moving, expressive eyes in Clone Wars (2003) to pay homage to his previous animated appearances in Nelvana's Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) and Droids. While Droids was excluded in the 2014 rebranding of Star Wars canon, recurring villain Admiral Screed—whom A Guide to the Star Wars Universe describes as \"the Emperor's right-hand man during the early days of the Empire\"—makes appearances in canon novels such as Tarkin (2014) and Aftermath: Life Debt (2016). Additionally, possible sources of inspiration for sequel trilogy main characters Rey and Kylo Ren have been noticed.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Star Wars: Droids 1985, George Lucas, Ben Burtt\n* Star Wars Insider #27\n* A Guide to the Star Wars Universe\n* The Star Wars Encyclopedia by Stephen J.
