The Portuguese were victorious.\nThe battle\nSometime after late May or early June, Portuguese command at Malacca received reports that an Acehnese armada had been spotted within the Langat River. Anticipating that the Acehnese intended to attack the city, the captain of Malacca Gaspar de Melo de Sampaio tasked Dom Francisco Coutinho to seek out the fleet and destroy it, with 15 half-galleys.\nThe Portuguese found the Acehnese ships heavily fortified by the banks of Langat River. Nevertheless, Coutinho moved his oarships into the river and after firing a salvo of artillery and muskety grappled and boarded the Acehnese vessels closest of the mouth of the river. At the end of a stiff struggle, having suffered heavy losses, the Acehnese lost or abandoned almost all of their ships, 3000 men killed, captured or missing, and 800 guns captured by the Portuguese.\nSee also\n* Battle of Duyon River\n* Battle of Jambi\nReferences"
