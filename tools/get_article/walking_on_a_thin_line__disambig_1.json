It was released on 3 February 2003 by BMG. Title of the album comes from a line in the song \"Kiss the Dawn\".\nThe album reached #1 on the German album charts and was certified gold for shipping 100,000 copies. Lead single \"You Can't Stop Me\" peaked at #10 in Germany.\nBackground\nRecording Walking on a Thin Line went slow and was delayed multiple times. In the 2005 documentary Planet of the Apes, Dennis Poschwatta said that the band \"made the mistake of going [into the studio] with unfinished songs. That’s why it took a year to write and create this record.\" At the time of the release of \"You Can't Stop Me\" it was still unclear what the album title would be. Despite all that, Sandra Nasić called the album her favorite, saying she considered it \"the most mature thing [Guano Apes had] done\" and that they'd \"essentially achieved what [she] was aiming for\".\n\"Diokhan\" is one of the oldest songs on the album: a demo version of this song was recorded as early as 1994, and was later included on the compilation album Lost (T)apes.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Sandra Nasić - vocals\n* Henning Rümenapp - guitars\n* Stefan Ude - bass\n* Dennis Poschwatta - drums, vocals\nAdditional musicians\n* Roland Peil – Percussion\nCredits\n* Artwork – Friedel\n* Engineer, mixing – Clemens Matznick\n* Additional engineers – Ben Hertel, Jan Helle, Philsen Hoppen, Tom Fein\n* Drumcare engineer – Rossi Rossberg\n* Mastering – Ian Cooper\n* Photography – Dirk Schelpmeier\n* Producer – Fabio Trentini, Guano Apes\n* Additional Vocal Production Producer – Artemis Gounaki, Sandra Nasic\n* Programming – Dirk Riegner, G-Ball\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n| 35\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
