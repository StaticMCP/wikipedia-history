He most likely reigned during late 13th century-early 14th century. the Azizan dynasty were originally Yezidis but converted to Sunni Islam by 14th century. according to Sharafkhan Bitlisi, The Azizanids claimed to be decscandant of an Umayyad caliph by the name of \"Khalid ibn Walid\" , via a son of his named Sulayman. However, There's no Umayyad caliph with the name Khalid ibn Walid; perhaps Sharafkhan meant Yazid III Walid, nicknamed Abu Khalid.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
