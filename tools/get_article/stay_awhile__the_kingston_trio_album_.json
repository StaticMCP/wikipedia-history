It was their second release on the Decca label. It continued their downward slide in the charts, reaching number 126 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. The single \"Yes I Can Feel It\" b/w \"Stay Awhile\" did not chart.\nReception\n| rev2      = Record Mirror\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nAllmusic critic Bruce Eder, in reviewing the reissue, praised the album, writing \"This was a pretty strong album to begin with... It's all surprisingly memorable, coming out of a period in which the Trio's records simply weren't selling... The result is a CD every bit as good, and perhaps better than many of the group's classic Capitol sides.\nReissues\n*Stay Awhile was reissued on a remastered CD in 1994 on the Folk Era label.
