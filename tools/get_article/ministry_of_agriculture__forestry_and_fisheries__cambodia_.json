The land concessions are to be used for agro-industrial, forestry, tourism and constructional projects, even though larger parts of the land are wildlife protections or national parks even (See Cardamom Mountains for example). The vast majority of the Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) have in fact been issued in violation of Cambodia's 2001 Land Law and its Subdecree on ELCs and are therefore illegal.\nThe landsales has been perceived by observers, to be the result of extensive land grabbing and corruption within the judicial system, ministries and government bureaucracy of Cambodia. It has stirred serious unrest across the country, within recent years.\nMinisters\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\"|Portrait\n!rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|Name\n!colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|Tenure\n!rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|Party\n|-\n!From\n!To\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; color:white\" |\n|\n|Chan Sarun\n|30 November 1998\n|23 September 2013\n|CPP\nChhea Song ( ឈា សុង)\n|30 November 1998\n30 September 2003 Mr\nCambodian People Party (CPP)\n! style=\"background-color:; color:white\" |\n|\n|Ouk Rabun\n|24 September 2013\n|5 April 2016\n|CPP\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; color:white\" |\n|\n|Veng Sakhon\n|5 April 2016\n|8 October 2022\n|CPP\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; color:white\" |\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|Aun PornmonirothActing\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|8 October 2022\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|17 October 2022\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"| CPP\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; color:white\" |\n|\n|Dith Tina\n|17 October 2022\n|Present\n|CPP\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Agriculture in Cambodia\n* Deforestation in Cambodia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090125144552/http://www.maff.gov.kh/eng/ Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081222134952/http://www.maff.gov.kh/eng/aboutus.html Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries - Ministry directory]\n*[http://www.forestry.gov.kh/ Forestry Administration, home page]"
