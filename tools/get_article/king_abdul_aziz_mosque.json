Construction of the mosque was financed by the Government of Saudi Arabia and named after its first monarch. Completed in 1981, it is one of the first Spanish mosques built in the modern time.\nAlong with the Fuengirola Mosque and Malaga Mosque, the Marbella Mosque was financed by the Government of Saudi Arabia, and is therefore a part of the Salafi school of thought, a movement dominant in Saudi Arabia. The construction was ordered by Prince Salman in honor of King Fahd, who was a frequenter of Marbella.\nThe building is an example of Andalusian-inspired contemporary Arabic architecture. Built by Córdoban architect Juan Mora, it holds over 800 people and consists of housing for the imam, a library and gardens.\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in Spain\n* List of mosques in Spain\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
