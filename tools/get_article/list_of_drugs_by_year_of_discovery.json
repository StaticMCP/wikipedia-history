In the modern era, plant-based drugs have been isolated, purified and synthesised anew. Synthesis of drugs has led to novel drugs, including those that have not existed before in nature, particularly drugs based on known drugs which have been modified by chemical or biological processes.\nAntiquity\nPrehistory\nArchaeological evidence indicates that the use of medicinal plants dates back to the Paleolithic age.\n4th millennium BCE\nIn ancient Egypt, herbs are mentioned in Egyptian medical papyri, depicted in tomb illustrations, or on rare occasions found in medical jars containing trace amounts of herbs. Medical recipes from 4000 BCE were for liquid preparations rather than solids. In the 4th millennium BCE, Soma (drink) and Haoma are named, but is not clear what ingredients were used to prepare them.\n3rd millennium BCE\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Discovery !!

Stilbenoids (e.g. rhaponticin), which may lower blood glucose levels. Flavanol glucosides (e.g. (−)-catechin-7-O-glucoside) which may be cytoprotective.\n|-\n|}\n2nd millennium BCE\nWritten around 1600 BCE, the Edwin Smith Papyrus describes the use of many herbal drugs. The Ebers Papyrus – one of the most important medical papyri of ancient Egypt – was written around 1550 BCE, and covers more than 700 drugs, mainly of plant origin. The first references to pills were found on papyri in ancient Egypt, and contained bread dough, honey, or grease. Medicinal ingredients such as plant powders or spices were mixed in and formed by hand to make little balls, or pills. The papyri also describe how to prepare herbal teas, poultices, ointments, eye drops, suppositories, enemas, laxatives, etc. Aloe vera was used in the 2nd millennium BCE.\n1st millennium BCE\nIn Greece, Theophrastus of Eresos wrote Historia Plantarum in the 4th century BCE. Seeds likely used for herbalism have been found in archaeological sites of Bronze Age China dating from the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 BCE–c. 1046 BCE). Over a hundred of the 224 drugs mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing – an early Chinese medical text – are herbs. Herbs also commonly featured in the medicine of ancient India, where the principal treatment for diseases was diet.\nOpioids are among the world's oldest known drugs. Use of the opium poppy for medical, recreational, and religious purposes can be traced to the 4th century BCE, when Hippocrates wrote about it for its analgesic properties, stating, \"Divinum opus est sedare dolores.\" (\"Divine work is the easing of pain\")\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Morphine binds to and activates Mu opioid receptors and is analgesic. Opium also contains isoquinolines (e.g. papaverine and noscapine).\n|-\n|}\n1st century CE\nIn ancient Greece, pills were known as  (\"something to be swallowed\"). Pliny the Elder, who lived from 23 to 79 CE, first gave a name to what we now call pills, calling them . Pliny also wrote Naturalis Historia a collection of 38 books and the first pharmacopoea.\nPedanius Dioscorides wrote De Materia Medica (c. 40 – 90 CE); this book dominated the area of drug knowledge for some 1500 years until the 1600s.\nJojoba was used in the 1st millennium CE.\n2nd century CE\nAelius Galenus wrote more than 11 books about drugs, also use terra sigillata with kaolinite and goats blood to produce tablets.\nPost-classical to Early modern\nDrugs developed in the post-classical (circa 500 to 1450) or early modern eras (circa 1453 to 1789).\n6th–11th century CE\nIn middle age ointments were a common dosage form.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Drugs mentioned by Avicenna include agaric, scammony and euphorbium. The latex of Euphorbia resinifera contains resiniferatoxin, an ultra potent capsaicin analog.  Desensitization to resiniferatoxin is tested in clinical trials to treat neuropathic pain.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year of discovery !!

Paracelsus discovered that the alkaloids in opium are far more soluble in alcohol than water. Having experimented with various opium concoctions, Paracelsus came across a specific tincture of opium that was of considerable use in reducing pain. He called this preparation laudanum.\nFor over a thousand years South American indigenous peoples have chewed Erythroxylon coca leaves, which contain alkaloids such as cocaine. Coca leaf remains have been found with ancient Peruvian mummies. There is also evidence coca leaves were used as an anesthetic. In 1569, Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes described the indigenous peoples' practice of chewing a mixture of tobacco and coca leaves to induce \"great contentment\".\n1400s Nicotine (Tobacco)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1747, James Lind, surgeon of HMS Salisbury, conducted the first clinical trial ever recorded, on it he studied how citrus fruit were capable of curing scurvy.\nModern\n19th century CE\nIn the 1830s chemist Justus von Liebig began the synthesis of organic molecules, stating that \"The production of all organic substances no longer belongs just to living organisms.\"  In 1832 produced chloral hydrate, the first synthetic sleeping drug. In 1833 French chemist Anselme Payen was the first to discover an enzyme, diastase. In 1834, François Mothes and Joseph Dublanc created a method to produce a single-piece gelatin capsule that was sealed with a drop of gelatin solution. In 1853 Alexander Wood was the first physician that used hypodermic needle to dispense drugs via Injections. In 1858 Dr. M. Sales Giron invented the first pressurized inhaler.\nAmphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, when it was independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties. Shortly after amphetamine, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Three decades later, in 1919, methamphetamine hydrochloride was synthesized by pharmacologist Akira Ogata via reduction of ephedrine using red phosphorus and iodine.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year of discovery !! rowspan=\"2\" | Name of the drug !! colspan=\"2\" | Synthesis mechanism !! rowspan=\"2\" | Year that was Patented !! rowspan=\"2\" | Governmental approval !! rowspan=\"2\" | Patented expired\n|-\n!Synthesis discoverer\n!Year\n|-\n| 1803–1805||Morphine||Gates synthesis\n|1952\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n| 1820 ||Quinine (isolation) ||Woodward and Doering\n|1944\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n|1830s\n|Santonin\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1832 ||Chloral hydrate||Justus von Liebig\n|1832\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n| 1833 ||Diastase||\n|  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|1853\n|Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin)\n|\n|1899\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1875 ||Phenylhydrazine||Hermann Emil Fischer\n|1875\n| 1875 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1877 ||Paracetamol||Harmon Northrop Morse\n|1877\n| 1950 ||  || 2007\n|-\n| 1877 ||Mannitol||Julije Domac\n|1877\n| 1950 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1880 ||Phenazone, \"the mother of modern Antipyretics\" ||Ludwig Knorr\n|1880\n| 1880 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1885 ||Ephedrine||Nagai Nagayoshi\n|1885\n| 1885 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1890 ||Benzocaine||August Bischler\n|1895\n| 1895 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1895 ||Quinazoline||August Bischler\n|1895\n| 1895 ||  ||\n|-\n|1887\n|Amphetamine\n|Lazăr Edeleanu\n|1887\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|1893\n|Methamphetamine\n|Nagai Nagayoshi\n|1893\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n20th century CE\nIn 1901 Jōkichi Takamine isolated and synthesized the first hormone, Adrenaline. In 1907 Alfred Bertheim synthesized Arsphenamine, the first man-made antibiotic. In 1927 Erik Rotheim patented the first aerosol spray can. In 1933 Robert Pauli Scherer created a method to develop softgels.\nWilliam Roberts studies about penicillin were continued by Alexander Fleming, who in 1928 concluded that penicillin had an antibiotic effect. In 1944 Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain mass-produced penicillin. In 1948 Raymond P. Ahlquist published his seminal work where he divided adrenoceptors into α- and β-adrenoceptor subtypes, this allowed a better understanding of drugs mechanisms of action.\nIn 1987, after Montreal Protocol, CFC inhalers were phased out and HFA inhalers replace them. In 1987 CRISPR technique was discovered by Yoshizumi Ishino that in the next century would be used for genome editing.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year of discovery !! Name of the drug !!

Another field beneficed by Human Genome Project is pharmacogenetics, that is the study of inherited genetic differences in drug metabolic pathways which can affect individual responses to drugs, both in terms of therapeutic effect as well as adverse effects.\nHumane genome study also allowed to identify which genes are responsible of illness, and to develop drugs for rare diseases and also treatment of illness through gene therapy. In 2015 a simplified form of CRISPR edition was used in humans with Cas9, and also was used an even more simple method, Cas12a that prevent genetic damage from viruses. These advances are improving personalized medicine and allowing precision medicine.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year of discovery !! Name of the drug !!
