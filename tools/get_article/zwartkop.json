Several of the suburbs like Erasmia, Elardus Park, Zwartkop and Doornkloof were named after the original owners of the land and their properties. The suburb of Zwartkop lies within the boundaries of the original farm by the same name.\nTransport\nZwartkop is bordered by both the N1 and N14 highways allowing quick access by car.
