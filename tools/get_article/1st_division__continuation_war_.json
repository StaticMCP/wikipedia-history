Before the onset of the war, one of its component regiments, Infantry Regiment 14, was transferred to the Åland islands under the command of the navy as part of Operation Kilpapurjehdus. The 14th regiment was replaced by Infantry Regiment 60.\nDuring the war, the 1st Division took part in the invasion of East Karelia as a component of the Finnish VII Corps that captured the city of Petrozavodsk. Later in the war, the division was transferred to the II Corps.\nNotable members\n* Lauri Törni\nSee also\n* List of Finnish divisions in the Continuation War\n* Finnish 1st Division (Winter War)\nNotes\nReferences\n* Leskinen, Jari, and Antti Juutilainen, eds.
