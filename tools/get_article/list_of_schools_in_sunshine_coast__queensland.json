Prior to 2015, the Queensland education system consisted of primary schools, which accommodated students from Kindergarten to Year 7 (ages 5–13), and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 8 to 12 (ages 12–18). However, from 2015, Year 7 became the first year of high school.\nState schools\nState primary schools\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Suburb\n! LGA\n! Opened\n!Coords\n!

Prior to the 1970s, most schools were founded by religious institutes, but with the decrease in membership of these institutes, together with major reforms inside the church, lay teachers and administrators began to take over the schools, a process which completed by approximately 1990.\nSchools in the Sunshine Coast region are administered by the Catholic Education Office, Archdiocese of Brisbane. The CEO is supported by the Queensland Catholic Education Commission, which is responsible for coordinating administration, curriculum and policy across the Catholic school system. Preference for enrolment is given to Catholic students from the parish or local area, although non-Catholic students are admitted if room is available.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n!
