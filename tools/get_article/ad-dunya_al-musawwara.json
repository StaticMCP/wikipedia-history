It was released by the well-known publishing house Dar al-Hilal that was also responsible for the publications of al-Fukaha, Kull Shayʾ and Al Musawwar. The magazine consisted of seven volumes with a total of 228 issues which were published weekly.\nThe magazine did not only focus on Egyptian and international events, but also illustrations pursuing a cultural focus. A considerable number of cartoons, photographs and high-quality illustrations increased the readership vastly, even among illiterates. In the course of this novel phase regarding the Egyptian media landscape, al-Dunya al-Musawwara seized on new topics, such as fashion, sports, culture, and tourism, and offered a great commercial platform to popular products of that time.\nReferences"
