Her books include ''The Good News Club: The Christian Right's Stealth Assault on America's Children (2012), The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism (2020), which also served as the basis for the documentary film God & Country (2024); and Money Lies and God: Inside the Movement to Destroy American Democracy.'' which in 2025 the New York Times called \"as an eerily prescient guide to the phantasmagoria of our political moment.\"\nCareer\nAs a writer and speaker, Stewart has shown interest in controversies over religious freedom and the separation of church and state. She has also written about public and science education, public funding of faith-based initiatives, anti-LGBT initiatives on the state level, faith-based political organizing, the U.S. Supreme Court, homeschooling, and bullying in schools in the U.S.\nStewart began her journalism career working for investigative reporter Wayne Barrett at The Village Voice. Since 2011, she has been an op-ed contributor to The New York Times, writing more than 20 columns. In a March 2020 op-ed, she linked the slow federal response to the country's coronavirus outbreak to President Trump's connections to the far right and anti-science conservatives.\nStewart has contributed pieces to The Guardian, and has written for The American Prospect, George Washington University's History News Network, The Nation, Reuters, The Atlantic, The New Republic,The Daily Beast, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, The New York Observer, Santa Barbara Magazine, The New York Review of Books, and Religion Dispatches.\nIn 2012, after seeing that group's involvement in her children's public school, Stewart wrote ''The Good News Club: The Christian Right's Stealth Assault on America's Children. Kirkus described it as \"[c]ompelling investigative journalism about an undercovered phenomenon.\" Alexander Heffner of the Minnesota Star Tribune wrote that the book \"exposes the violation of church and state in schools\", calling it \"an important work\" and \"a fascinating exposé\", and Stewart \"a great digger for facts\" and \"a respectful narrator.\"\nIn March 2020, Stewart published The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism, which outlines the decentralized Christian nationalist movement in the U.S. and its grabs for power, linking it to historical movements against abolition, the New Deal, and civil rights. It was reviewed in Foreign Affairs and was excerpted in the New York Review of Books and partially adapted in The New Republic''. The Washington Post called it \"required reading for anyone who wants to map the continuing erosion of our already fragile wall between church and state\". David Austin Walsh in The Baffler wrote that Stewart neglected key right-wing evangelical figures such as Gerald L.K. Smith but that their \"absence...is not a fatal omission.\" She was interviewed on The Brian Lehrer Show, The Majority Report, and for Salon and Sojourners. Power Worshippers also served as the basis for God & Country (2024), a documentary film directed by Dan Partland and produced by Rob Reiner.\nPersonal life\nStewart was born in Boston, Massachusetts.
