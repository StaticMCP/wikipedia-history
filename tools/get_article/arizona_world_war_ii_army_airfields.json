However, the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nAir Transport Command\n* Coolidge Army Air Field,  southeast of Coolidge\n: Now: Coolidge Municipal Airport\n* Winslow Municipal Airport, Winslow\n: Now: Winslow–Lindbergh Regional Airport\nFourth Air Force\n* Davis–Monthan Field, Tucson\n: 32nd Air Base Squadron / 32nd Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; 20 April 1941–1 April 1944\n: 233rd Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Very Heavy)(Second AF); 1 April 1944–16 November 1945\n: Now:  Davis–Monthan Air Force Base\n:* Sahuarita Flight Strip  ( east of Sahuarita)\n:: Aux to Davis–Monthan AAF\n:: Now: S.
