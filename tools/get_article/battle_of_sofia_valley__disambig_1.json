After prolonged and fierce sieges many fortresses fell: the town of Diampol, managed to resist for a prolongued time against the forces led by Timurtash, however, the defenders of the fortress werè eventually forced to surrender because of food shortage. The Ottomans conquered most of the Rhodopes, Kostenets, Ihtiman, and Samokov.\nAfter the conquest of Bitola, Lala Şahin planned to seize Sofia but before he could reach the city, the Ottomans encroached with the Bulgarians on the Sofia Valley. In the bloody clash both sides suffered heavy casualties, but the Ottomans were repulsed and forced to retreat.
