He was a member of the Banu Abs tribe.\nUrwah Bin Al-ward is a heroic outlaw in Arabic folklore who, according to legend, was a highly skilled archer and swordsman (Robin Hood’s character adapted from Urwah ibn alward’s character) Ewrah bin Al-Ward Al-Absi – the noble ragamuffin – a brave knight, polite, out of law, a supporter of the poor, poet of Abs, Arabic knight and a generous ragamuffin. He was stealing to feed the poor, he was called “ragamuffin’s loop”, because he was collecting and direct them if they failed in their invasions. He had a remarkable skill in shooting arrows.\nLife\nLittle is known about his life, but he had a reputation for being \"the most generous of the ancient Arabs.\"\nPoetry\nUrwa was the most prolific of the su'luk poets.  Yaqub Ibn as-Sikkit wrote a commentary on his poetic diwan.  His most famous poem is preserved in the Asma'iyyat.  Some of his poetry expresses his love for Salma, his estranged wife who he divorced while drunk.  When he recovered, he fell into despair at what he had done.  His diwan was edited by Theodor Nöldeke, who published it as Die Gedichte des Urwa ibn Alward in 1864.\nReferences\nRené Basset: Le Dîwân de ‘Orwa ben el Ward. Traduit et annoté par René Basset.
