It is celebrated in Kyrgyzstan annually on August 31, the anniversary of its declaration of independence in 1991.\nHistory\nOn August 31, 1991, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan adopted a law on the \"Declaration on State Independence of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan\".  Because of this, the Kyrgyz Republic was declared an independent state. Kyrgyzstan officially adhered to the principles of international law, and cooperation between peoples. In 1993, the first constitution was adopted, which has changed several times in 20 years. In the years since independence, Kyrgyzstan has had two revolutions, each putting the first two Presidents of Kyrgyzstan in exile in Russia and Belarus respectively.\nAnnual mass event\nAnnually, a mass cultural event is held on Ala-Too Square, which is attended by thousands of spectators as well as high ranking politicians. It is held in the presence of the President of Kyrgyzstan, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Supreme Council, and Mayor of Bishkek as well as other politicians from the Supreme Council and former presidents and prime ministers. Normally, a theatrical prologue of historical figures who contributed to the establishment of Kyrgyz statehood is shown. The president usually delivers a speech to those present after the entrance of the National colours (the Flag of Kyrgyzstan) and the performance of the Mamlekettik Gimni (National Anthem) by a choir and symphonic orchestra. Kyrgyz pop stars as well as traditional dance ensembles perform during this event.\nBishkek military parade\nA military parade on August 31 is held every 5 years in Bishkek on Ala-Too Square in honor of  Independence Day. Smaller military parades are also held in other cities in Kyrgyzstan (such as Osh, and Jalal-Abad).\nThe parade commander gives the order to commence the parade of the Bishkek Garrison at 10:00 am. The Minister of Defense (or on some occasions the Chief of the General Staff) arrives on the square and is greeted by the parade commander (usually the Bishkek Garrison commander), who informs the minister that the parade is now ready for inspection. The minister then inspects the troops on the square in the following manner:\n::Minister: ''Hello Comrades of the (states formation's name)Formation: Greetings Comrade Minister of Defence!Minister: Congratulations on the occasion of the anniversary of the independence of the Kyrgyz Republic!\nAfter he inspects the troops and disembarks from the vehicle and reports to the President of Kyrgyzstan in their position as Commander in Chief on the status of the parade. After this is done, the president delivers an address on the holiday. After the speech, the Mamlekettik Gimni'' (National Anthem) is performed by the Band of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Kyrgyzstan. After the performance of the national anthem, the commander of the parade gives the command to begin the parade. The parade formations and military equipment of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan then  march on the square, saluting to their Commander in Chief as they march past the central tribune.\nList of parades\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! width=\"90\" |Year\n! width=\"120\" |President of Kyrgyzstan\n! width=\"100\" |Parade commander\n! width=\"90\" |Parade inspector\n! width=\"550\" |Notes\n|-\n|1992\n|Askar Akayev\n|\n|\n|Celebrated the 1st anniversary of independence.\n|-\n|1996\n|Askar Akayev\n|Colonel Esen Topoev\n|Colonel General Myrzakan Subanov\n|Celebrated the 5th anniversary of independence.\n|-\n|2001\n|Askar Akayev\n|\n|Army General Esen Topoev\n|Celebrated the 10th anniversary of independence.\n|-\n|2005\n|Kurmanbek Bakiyev\n|\n||Lieutenant General Ismail Isakov\n|Celebrated the 14th anniversary of independence.\n|-\n|2006\n|Kurmanbek Bakiyev\n|Major General Boris Yugai\n|Lieutenant General Ismail Isakov\n|Celebrated the 15th anniversary of independence.\n|-\n|2011\n|Roza Otunbayeva\n|Colonel Taalaibek Omuraliev\n|Major General Abibilla Kudayberdiev\n|Celebrated the 20th anniversary of independence. 1,700 soldiers participated in some form, which costed the government around 18 million Kyrgyzstani soms ($258,235 USD).
