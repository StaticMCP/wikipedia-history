They are regarded as the most prestigious and significant awards in the comic industry and often referred to as the industry's equivalent of the Academy Awards.\nThe first Eisners were conferred in 1988, for works published in 1987. The Eisner Awards ceremony has been held at San Diego Comic-Con every year since 1991. The awards are named in honor of pioneering cartoonist and writer Will Eisner, who was a regular participant in the ceremony until his death in 2005.\nThe nominations in each category are generated by a five- to six-member jury, then voted on by comic book professionals. The jury often consists of at least one comics retailer, one librarian (since 2005), and one academic researcher, among other comic experts. , awards are presented in 32 categories.\nHistory\nThe Eisner Awards and Harvey Awards were first conferred in 1988, both created in response to the discontinuation of the Kirby Awards in 1987. Dave Olbrich started the non-profit organization.\nThere was no Eisner Awards ceremony, or awards distributed, in 1990, due to widespread balloting mix-ups. The previous administrator, Dave Olbrich, left the position, and Jackie Estrada has been the award administrator since 1990. The Eisner Awards ceremony has been held at San Diego Comic-Con every year since 1991.\nIn 2006, it was announced that the archives of the Eisner Awards would be housed at the James Branch Cabell Library of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia.\nCategories\nAwards are currently presented in 32 categories for works published in the previous year.\nCurrent\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ List of current Eisner Award categories\n!
