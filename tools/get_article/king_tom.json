Lettsome as \"a very fine fellow, so far as dress goes, for he generally has variegated bright colours; his hat is immensely large, and the whole flap covered with gold lace, of which he is very proud. His palace is, however equal to a hut.\"\nLettsome also stated that he was at one time father-in-law of Henry Smeathman.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
