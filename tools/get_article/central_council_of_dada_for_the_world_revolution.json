When this revolution was crushed and Liebknecht and Luxemburg killed, the Dadas continued to seek power through democratic means. They were present at the Weimar Congress but remained relatively politically powerless throughout the era of the Weimar Republic, during which time they did gain some infamy for their direct action campaigns and artistic innovations.\nIn Berlin in 1919, the group outlined the Dadaist ideas of radical communism.\nMembers included: Johannes Baader, Raoul Hausmann, Tristan Tzara, George Grosz, Marcel Janco, Hans Arp, Franz Jung, Eugen Ernst, A.R. Meyer and Richard Huelsenbeck. Their shocking political tactics and social antics influenced many later counter-cultural movements, such as the Youth International Party and the punk rock movement.\nReferences\nLinks and Sources\n*[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=7775 Dada: Art as weapon against establishment]\n*[http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors3/mavertext.html Avant-garde of terror]"
