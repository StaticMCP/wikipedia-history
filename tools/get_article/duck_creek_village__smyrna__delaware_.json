It encompasses three contributing buildings that are the remnants of a mid-18th century community.  They are the two-story, five-bay, brick former miller's house known as \"The Lindens;\" a one-story, plank house with a steep gable roof; and a former grist mill measuring 80 feet by 100 feet.   In 1998 and 1999, the Duck Creek Historical Society disassembled and moved the plank house to the rear yard of the Smyrna Museum Complex.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20130216200210/http://smyrnamuseum.com/2.html The Smyrna Museum Complex website]"
