This article treats the runestone that refer to people who took part in voyages abroad, in western Europe, and stones that mention men who were Viking warriors and/or died while travelling in the West. However, it is likely that all of them do not mention men who took part in pillaging. The inscriptions were all engraved in Old Norse with the Younger Futhark. The runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none. Sweden has as many as between 1,700 and 2,500 depending on definition. The Swedish district of Uppland has the highest concentration with as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone, whereas Södermanland is second with 391.\nThe largest group consists of 30 stones that mention England, and they are treated separately in the article England runestones. The runestones that talk of voyages to eastern Europe, the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East are treated separately in the article Varangian runestones and its subarticles.\nThe most notable of the Viking runestones is the Kjula Runestone in Södermanland, Sweden, and it contains a poem in Old Norse in the metre fornyrðislag that refers to the extensive warfare of a man called \"Spear\":\n{|\n|\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n|\n:who had been\n:in the west,\n:broken down and fought\n:in townships.\n:He knew all\n:the journey's fortresses.\n|\n|}\nBelow follows a presentation of the runestones based on the Rundata project. The transcriptions into Old Norse are in the Swedish and Danish dialect to facilitate comparison with the inscriptions, while the English translation provided by Rundata gives the names in the de facto standard dialect (the Icelandic and Norwegian dialect):\nUppland\nU 349\nThis runestone located at Odenslunda was documented during the Swedish runestone surveys in the 17th century, but has since disappeared. It is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK. This is considered to be the oldest style, and is used for inscriptions with runic text bands that have straight ends without any attached serpent or beast heads.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|[uikitil × uk × usur -...u × risa × stin × þina * iftiʀ × ustin × faþ... … ...þan × on furs × uti × miþ × ala × skibin × kuþ × ialbi × (a)t]\n|Vikætill {} ok {} Ossurr [let]u {} ræisa {} stæin {} þenna {} æftiʀ {} Øystæin, {} fað[ur] … [go]ðan. {} Hann fors {} uti {} með {} alla {} skipan. {} Guð {} hialpi {} and.\n|\"Véketill and Ôzurr had this stone raised in memory of Eysteinn, … good father.

It appears to be raised in memory of a man who died in the retinue of the Viking chieftain Freygeirr. Pr 1 is also known as Ringerike style, and this classification is used for inscriptions which depicts the serpent heads attached to the runic text bands in profile, but the serpents or beasts are not as elongated and stylized as in the Urnes style.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|biurn : auk : stnfriþ : litu : arisa s--n : afti : kisila : han : uti : fial : i liþi : frekis *\n|Biorn {} ok {} Stæinfrið {} letu {} ræisa s[tæi]n {} æftiʀ {} Gisla. {} Hann {} uti {} fioll {} i liði {} Frøygæiʀs(?). {}\n|\"Bjôrn and Steinfríðr had the stone raised in memory of Gísli.

In the 17th century this stone was found by one of Johannes Bureus' assistants and it was part of the wall of a manor house. After having been lost for 100 years it was rediscovered in the mid-19th century.\nThe stone is of high notability because it was raised in memory of one of the members of the Dano-English kings' personal guard, the Þingalið, consisting of elite warriors who mostly came from Scandinavia. This elite unit existed between 1016 and 1066. Another runestone raised in memory of a man who died in the same retinue is found in Södermanland, the Råby Runestone.\nThe Kolsta runestone is carved in runestone style Pr3, and it is not older than the mid-11th century as indicated by the use of dotted runes and the use of the ansuz rune for the o phoneme.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|' sterkar * auk ' hioruarþr ' letu * reisa * þensa * stein at ' faþur sin keir(a) ' sum ' uestr ' sat ' i þikaliþi * kuþ hialbi salu\n|{} Stærkarr {} ok {} Hiorvarðr {} letu {} ræisa {} þennsa {} stæin at {} faður sinn Gæiʀa, {} sum {} vestr {} sat {} i þingaliði. {} Guð hialpi salu.\n|\"Styrkárr and Hjôrvarðr had this stone raised in memory of their father Geiri, who sat in the Assembly's retinue in the west.

Part of the stone was later found in a wall of a shed at a courtyard and another below a cottage. The courtyard along with several nearby houses were later destroyed in 1880. The stone is now considered to be lost. It is classified as possibly being in runestone style RAK and was raised in memory of a son who died in the west.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|[lafʀ * raisþi * stain * þansi : iftiʀ * sulfu * sun sin : han uarþ : uastr * tauþr]\n|Olafʀ {} ræisþi {} stæin {} þannsi {} æftiʀ {} Sylfu/Solfu, {} sun sinn. {} Hann varð {} vestr {} dauðr.\n|\"Ólafr raised this stone in memory of Sylfa/Solfa, his son.

It is located in Kjula at the old road between Eskilstuna and Strängnäs, which was also the location for the local assembly.\nIt tells of a man called Spjót (\"spear\") who had taken part in extensive warfare in western Europe. It is held to have been raised by the same aristocratic family as the Ramsund carving nearby and the Bro Runestone in Uppland. Several Scandinavian authorities such as Sophus Bugge, Erik Brate, and Elias Wessén have discussed the runestone and how extensive the warfare of Spjót could have been. Spjót, meaning \"Spear\", is a unique name and it may have been a name he earned as a warrior.\nThe text uses the term vestarla for \"in the west\" without specifying a location. Four other Viking runestones similarly use this term, Sö 137, Sö 164, Sö 173, and Sm 51.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|alrikʀ ¤ raisti ¤ stain × sun × siriþaʀ × at × sin faþur × sbiut ×× saʀ × uisitaula × um × uaʀit : hafþi × burg × um brutna : i : auk × um barþa +× firþ × han × kar(s)aʀ + kuni + alaʀ ×\n|Alrikʀ {} ræisti {} stæin, {} sunn {} Sigriðaʀ, {} at {} sinn faður {} Spiut, {} saʀ {} vestarla {} um {} vaʀit {} hafði, {} borg {} um brutna {} i {} ok {} um barða, {} færð {} hann {} karsaʀ {} kunni {} allaʀ. {}\n|\"Alríkr, Sigríðr's son, raised the stone in memory of his father Spjót, who had been in the west, broken down and fought in townships.

The ornamentation is a ship where the mast is an artful cross. It is the only runestone with both text and iconography that refer to a ship. It was raised in memory of a man who took part in an expedition to the west where he was buried, and refers to him heroically in alliterative verse or prose. This runestone is attributed to a runemaster named Traen.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|kuþbirn : uti : þaiʀ r(a)isþu : stan þansi : at : kuþmar : f(a)þur : sin : stuþ : triki:l(a) : i * stafn skibi : likʀ uistarla uf huln sar tu :\n|Guðbiorn, {} Oddi, {} þæiʀ ræisþu {} stæin þannsi {} at {} Guðmar, {} faður {} sinn. {} Stoð {} drængila {} i {} stafn skipi, {} liggʀ vestarla of hulinn(?), saʀ do. {}\n|\"Guðbjôrn (and) Oddi, they raised this stone in memory of Guðmarr, their father.

Two of them are runestones called Sö 173 and Sö 374, of which the last one has a cross. Both inscriptions are from the 11th century and tell of the same family. They probably refer to Viking expeditions both westwards and eastwards. Sö 173 is one of only two (the other one is U 802) known runestones whose ornamentation contain runic animal heads in both bird perspective (Fp) and profile perspective (Pr).\nThe location was first described by Lukas Gabb during the nationwide revision of pre-historic monuments that took place in the 17th century. In a paddock at the state owned homestead of Tystberga there was a flat stone lying with runes and next to it there was another flat stone that was leaning. In addition, there was a large square stone surrounded with rows of smaller stones, which Gadd described as a \"fairly large cemetery\". Not far from the stones, there were also two giant passage graves, about 20 paces long.\nThere is a depiction of the cross-less stone from the 17th century, made by Johan Hadorph and Johan Peringskiöld. This depiction has helped scholars reconstruct the parts that are damaged today. The runestone was raised anew by Richard Dybeck in 1864. In 1936, Ivar Schnell examined the stone, and he noted that there was a large stone next to it. When this stone was raised, they discovered that it was also a runestone, and it was probably the one that had been previously described by Lukas Gadd as the \"square stone\". In the vicinity, Schnell found a destroyed stone without runes which probably was the leaning stone described by Gadd. Since they would hinder agriculture, the three stones were re-erected at a distance of 60 metres, at the side of the road. The stone circle and the other monuments described by Gadd could not be found anymore.\nRegarding the names of the sponsors of the stone, the runes mani can be interpreted in two ways, since runic texts never repeat two runes consecutively. One possibility is that it refers to Máni, the moon, and the other alternative is the male name Manni which is derived from maðr (\"man\"). The runes mus:kia are more challenging and the older interpretation that it was Mus-Gea is nowadays rejected. It is probably a nominalization of myskia which means \"darken\" as during sunset, and one scholar has suggested that it could mean \"sunset\" and \"twilight\" and refer to e.g. a hair colour. A second theory is that the name refers to the animal bat. It is also disputed whether it is a man's name or a woman's name, but most scholars think that it refers to a woman. The name Myskia appears in a second runic inscription, Sö 13 from Gatstugan, and it may refer to the same person. The inscription echos the m-runes () from the sponsors' names in the shape of the tongues of the two serpents.\nThe last part of the cross-less inscription is both unusual and partly problematic. The word ystarla could without context be interpreted as both \"westwards\" and \"eastwards\", but since an austarla appears later in the inscription, it is agreed that ystarla means \"westwards\". It is unusual, but not unique, that the y-rune () represents the v phoneme. An additional reason for this interpretation is the fact that it would allow the last part of the inscription to be interpreted as a poem in the meter fornyrðislag. This would explain the use of the rune since vestarla permits alliteration with . It is not known whether he refers to Hróðgeirr (Roger) or Holmsteinn, but most think that it is Holmsteinn who had been westwards. The plural ending -u in the verb form dou shows that both Hróðgeirr and Holmsteinn died in the Ingvar expedition.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold |number=A\n|mus:kia : a(u)[k :] (m)an(i) : litu : rasa : ku[(m)(l) : þausi : at : b]ruþur * (s)in : hr(u)þkaiʀ * auk : faþur sin hulm:stain *\n|Myskia {} ok {} Manni/Mani {} letu {} ræisa {} kumbl {} þausi {} at {} broður {} sinn {} Hroðgæiʀ {} ok {} faður sinn Holmstæin. {}\n|\"Myskja and Manni/Máni had these monuments raised in memory of their brother Hróðgeirr and their father Holmsteinn.\"\n}}\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold |number=B\n|* han hafþi * ystarla u(m) : uaʀit * lenki : tuu : a:ustarla : meþ : inkuari\n|{} Hann hafði {} vestarla um {} vaʀit {} længi, {} dou {} austarla {} með {} Ingvari.\n|\"He had long been in the west; died in the east with Ingvarr.\"\n}}\nSö 217\nThis runestone in runestone style Fp is located in Sorunda. It is raised in memory of a father who died in a war expedition led by a commander named Guðvé. Erik Brate argues that it was the same expedition as the one mentioned on the Grinda Runestone and where the targets are reported to have been England and Saxony.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|+ suertikr : nuk + kari : auk : kuþmutr : auk : skari : auk : knutr : raistu : stain : þena : aftiʀ : utruk * faþur : sin : is fel * i liþi : kuþuis +\n|{} Sværtingʀ {} ok {} Kari {} ok {} Guðmundr {} ok {} Skari {} ok {} Knutr {} ræistu {} stæin {} þenna {} æftiʀ {} Otrygg, {} faður {} sinn, {} es fell {} i liði {} Guðvis. {}\n|\"Svertingr and Kári and Guðmundr and Skári and Knútr raised this stone in memory of Ótryggr, their father, who fell in Guðvé's retinue.\"\n}}\nSö 260\nThis runestone is located in Södra Beteby, and it may be one of the Hakon Jarl Runestones. It is not only the stone that has been found on the farm, but also a hoard of several hundred English coins. More Anglo-Saxon pennies of this period have been found in Sweden than in England due to the Danegelds.\nOmeljan Pritsak argues that this Hakon is the same as the one who is mentioned on the Bro Runestone and whose son Ulf was in the west, i.e. in England. This Swedish Hakon Jarl would then actually be the Norwegian Hákon Eiríksson.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|… … ...a : stin : eftiʀ : ierunt : sun : sia : aʀ * uaʀ : uestþr : meþ ulfi : suni * hakunar *\n|… … [ræis]a {} stæin {} æftiʀ {} Iarund, {} sun {} sinn, {} eʀ {} vaʀ {} vestr {} með Ulfi, {} syni {} Hakonaʀ. {}\n|\"… … raise the stone in memory of Jôrundr, his son, who was in the west with Ulfr, Hákon's son.\"\n}}\nSö 319\nThis runestone was found in Sannerby, but was moved to the park of the manor house Stäringe, where it is now raised beside the runestone Sö 320.

The engraved side had been facing inwards. The stone was raised next to the entrance to the church. It is in light red granite and it is 1.84 m tall (1.55 m above the soil) and 84&nbsp;cm wide. The length of the runes is between 12 and 15&nbsp;cm. It was raised by Hákon in memory of his son Gunnarr and both men are also known from the runestone Ög 162 at Gunnar's bridge located about one-half km north of the church. The inscription on Ög 162 relates that Hákon named the bridge in memory of his son Gunnarr. The runestone which was discovered at the church was probably the main memorial, but it reports that at least two memorials had been raised in Gunnarr's memory. It is consequently likely that both runestones formed a twinned memorial at Gunnar's bridge, and they were probably made by the same runemaster.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|hakun + raiþi × kuml × þausi × eftiʀ × kunar + sun × sin × han × uarþ × taurþ × uastr +\n|Hakon {} ræisþi {} kumbl {} þausi {} æftiʀ {} Gunnar, {} sun {} sinn. {} Hann {} varð {} dauðr {} vestr. {}\n|\"Hákon raised these monuments in memory of Gunnarr, his son.

Colloquially known as \"the stone of Toki the viking\" (Toke Vikings sten), it is raised by a man who entitled himself \"the Viking\" and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr2, which is also known as Ringerike style. It was discovered in 1813 under plaster in the wall of the cathedral. The inscription starts at the head of the serpent, and the inscription is carved in the circular band that follows the sides of the stone until it reaches the x. The prayer is read from bottom-up in the right hand rectangle. The runes tyki are found above the serpent's head in the central rectangle, whereas the runes uikikr are found in the left-hand rectangle. The epithet Viking indicates that Tóki had taken part in Viking expeditions and it was probably used to distinguish him from other men named Tóki in the region.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|-u(k)i tyki × uikikr reisti * stein * e(f)tir : kunar : sun : kirims × kuþ healbi sel hans\n|[T]oki, Toki {} Vikingʀ, ræisti {} stæin {} æftiʀ {} Gunnar, {} sun {} Grims. {} Guð hialpi salu hans!\n|\"Tóki, Tóki the Viking, raised the stone in memory of Gunnarr, Grímr's son.

It was raised in memory of Özurr who was in the service of a king named Harald, who was probably the English king Harold Harefoot. Serving as a skipari or \"seaman\" on the king's longship was a great honour and Özurr was consequently part of the king's retinue, the þingalið. Other runestones unsing the title skipari include DR 82 in Sønder Vinge, DR 218 in Tågerup, DR 275 in Solberga, DR 363 in Sturkö, DR 379 in Ny Larsker, Sö 171 in Esta, and Sö 335 in Ärja. On this runestone, the runemaster used a bind rune to combine the s-rune and k-rune in skipari. According to a local tradition, \"ancient coins\" were once found near the stone, and these coins were possibly Özur's payment from his service in England.\nkibari : hrhls : kunuks\n|Tumi/Tummi/Domi {} ræisti {} stæin {} þannsi {} æftiʀ {} Assur, {} broður {} sinn, {} þann {} eʀ {} vaʀ {} skipari {} Haralds {} kunungs.\n|\"Tumi/Tummi/Dómi raised this stone in memory of Ôzurr, his brother, he who was King Haraldr's seaman.\"\n}}\nSm 51\nThis runestone is located near the old exterior wall of the cemetery of the church of Forsheda. It was discovered in 1866 during the rebuilding of the church.

The stone was discovered in 1988 while conducting excavation for a grave at the church cemetery, and was then moved to the church tower. It is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3 and was raised in memory of a man who died when travelling in the west with vikingum or the Vikings. The inscription is considered to be an early use of the plural form of the word Vikings in Sweden, although it is also used on U 617 at Bro and on the Viking runestone DR 216 from Denmark.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|uatar : auk … hilkaiʀ : raistu : stain : iftir … hailka … f-þur : sin : hn : uahʀ -istr : farin miþ uikikum\n|Hvatarr {} ok {} Hæilgæiʀʀ(?) {} ræistu {} stæin {} aftiʀ {} Hæilga, {} f[a]ður {} sinn. {} Hann {} var [v]estr {} farinn með vikingum.\n|\"Hvatarr and Heilgeirr(?) raised the stone in memory of Helgi, their father.

It is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK. Although the runic text has been damaged, it describes the relationship between the men using the word felaga or \"partner,\" which is related to félag, a mercantile partnership or financial joint venture.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold |number=A\n|...usti : auk : kunar : ...u : stina : þasi : aiftiʀ : kn... ¶ … ...biurn : filaka : si(n)(-)\n|Tosti(?) {} ok {} Gunnar {} … {} stena {} þæssi {} æftiʀ {} … {} [ok] ...biorn, {} felaga {} sin[a].\n|\"Tosti(?) and Gunnarr … these stones in memory of … [and] ...-bjôrn, their partners.\"\n}}\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold |number=B\n|: þiʀ : trikaʀ : uaʀu : u--(-) --isiʀ : i * uikiku\n|{} Þeʀ {} drængiaʀ {} waʀu {} w[iþa] [un]esiʀ {} i {} wikingu.\n|\"These valiant men were widely renowned on Viking raids.\"\n}}\nDR 334\nThis runestone is carved in runestone style RAK and is part of the Västra Strö monument, which has five standing stones and two runestones, DR 334 and DR 335. The monument was in good shape when documented by Ole Worm in 1643, but a survey in 1876 found that all of the stones had fallen except one. The monument was restored in 1932 by the Lund Kulturen. The inscription on DR 334 is considered to have been carved by the same runemaster who did DR 335, which memorializes a deceased ship owner. Both memorial runestones were also sponsored by the same man, Faðir, who on DR 334 memorializes his deceased brother Ôzurr, who died  or on a Viking raid or expedition. It has been suggested that all three men may have participated on this raid or expedition.\nThe stone is known locally as the Västra Ströstenen 1.\n{{fs interlinear |lang=non |indent=2 |spacing=0.5 |class1=bold\n|faþiʀ : lit : hukua : runaʀ : þisi : uftiʀ : osur : bruþur : sin : is : nur : uarþ : tuþr : i : uikiku :\n|Faþiʀ {} let {} hoggwa {} runaʀ {} þæssi {} æftiʀ {} Azur, {} broþur {} sin, {} æs {} nor {} warþ {} døþr {} i {} wikingu. {}\n|\"Faðir had these runes cut in memory of Ôzurr, his brother, who died in the north on a Viking raid.\"\n}}\nDenmark\nDR 216\nThis runestone originates from Tirsted on the island of Lolland, Denmark. It is the earliest native Scandinavian document that mentions Sweden together with the runestones DR 344 and Sö Fv1948;289. It is raised in memory of a Viking who died in Sweden and according to one reading, he fought in the retinue of Freygeirr.
