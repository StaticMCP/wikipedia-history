During his work as an historian, he dealt in many of his studies with topics concerning economic history and used statistical methodologies, among others. Some of the themes he studied the most were monetary colonialism in the Mediterranean, the role of colonialism in the poverty of colonized peoples, and the history of Sardinia under foreign colonizers. His studies, in contrast to the previous idea of a \"civilization\" coming from outside, led him to consider Sardinia as one of the oldest colonies in the world, and to consider what was called its \"immobility\" as a consequence of such colonization.\n}}}}\nFurthermore, he was the author of one of the first censuses of the abandoned villages and villages of Sardinia. His research has made it possible to bring the European methodologies of the period, and especially the French ones, into Sardinian historiography.\nPublications\nThis is a partial list of John Day's publications:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* John Day, Europa dal '400 al '600: fonti e problemi, Atti del convegno internazionale (in Italian), Milan, 1983,  pp.&nbsp;241–249.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
