WCO has its regional offices in New York City, Seoul, and Beijing.\nMission\nWorld Culture Open believes in using culture to promote peace, because \"countries and cultures often divided by politics can easily and frequently unite over the arts, humanitarianism and health.\" Based on this belief, WCO works to promote cultural diversity around the world and create an open platform for intercultural exchange and collaboration. WCO \"…dreams of a global community where cultural diversity is truly fostered and appreciated by all everywhere.\"\nHistory\nIn early 2000, few like-minded people conceived a notion of having a \"cultural olympic.\" They thought of using cultural competition as a way to bring different people-groups together to promote peace, just like how the original Olympic games use sport competition to promote peace.\nOn 2003, professionals and leaders of various fields from 40 different countries around the world gathered in Washington D.C. for an international convention. Participants of the convention agreed on the necessity of an organization that can lead the concerted efforts for transcending borders and people-groups by using culture. This led to the launch of World Culture Open.\nTimeline\n* First WCO Award awarded to Dr.José Antonio Abreu of El Sistema, 2004\n*WCO Global Festival, New York City & Seoul, 2004\n*WCO International Choral Festival in support of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO)’s Telefood Campaign, New York, 2005\n*Pan-African Dance Festival, in partnership with the Ministry of Sports and Culture, Kigali, Rwanda, 2006\n*WCO International Conference on Creative Economy for Development, co-organized with the UNDP/South-South Cooperation, Kigali, Rwanda, 2006\n*UN Global Youth Leadership Summit, in partnership with the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace (UNOSDP), United Nations, New York City, 2006\n*Youth United Against Malaria Concert, United Nations, New York City, 2006\n*Cultural Exchange Concert Series Beijing, China; Mongolia; Korea; and Tokyo, Japan; 2009-2010\n*Japan Earthquake Relief Charity Concert, Iwate, Japan, 2011\n*C!TALK Beijing, China 2012–present\nWCO’s work\nWCO's activities are primarily focused around the following three areas.\nCreative sharing\n*C!HERE Movement: C!HERE Movement transforms empty spaces in the city into cultural activation open to the public. These spaces can be of any shape and sizes, including storefronts, office meeting rooms, theater stages, a few tables at a café, or even private backyards. Space owners wishing to create good will for the public and contribute to the cultural vitality of the community may give their space for a certain time period, for certain time slots on a regular basis, or they may also donate the space to be used as a dedicated C!HERE space. The spaces will then be transformed into new cultural spaces, offering many artists and cultural practitioners the opportunity to showcase and share their work and letting the public have a greater exposure to a wide spectrum of artistic and cultural experiences. Since the launch of the C!HERE movement in 2001, more than 60,000 people have participated.\n*WCO Creative Sharing Campaign (C!TALK): In 2012, WCO's regional office in Beijing began holding bimonthly cultural events and programs like concerts, lectures, and exhibitions for the public. The project brings together the showcase of various cultural artists and organizations at free of charge.
