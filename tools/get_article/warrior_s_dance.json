It also contains beat samples from \"Let The Warriors Dance\" by Addis Posse.\nThe digital single was released on 17 April in Australia, exclusively on iTunes, although only the \"Edit\" version with none of the remixes is also available. When released on iTunes Australia, the song was titled incorrectly and the download was actually a song from Placebo. However, this was later corrected.\nThe song peaked at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song was used in the soundtrack of the game Colin McRae: DiRT 2.\nRemixes\nThree remix versions of \"Warrior's Dance\" are being sold on the Prodigy's store, as digital downloads in MP3 format. An extra remix is exclusive to iTunes.\nTrack list\nCD single\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (edit) – 2:55\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (South Central remix) – 5:40\n12\" vinyl\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (Benga remix) – 4:45\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (South Central remix) – 5:40\nDownloads\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (edit) – 2:55\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (Album Version) – 5:13\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (South Central remix) – 5:40\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (Benga remix) – 4:45\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (Kicks Like A Mule remix) – 5:09\niTunes downloads\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (edit) – 2:56\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (album version) – 5:14\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (South Central remix) – 5:41\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (Benga remix) – 4:46\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (Future Funk Squad's 'Rave Soldier' mix) – 5:33\n#\"Warrior's Dance\" (Kicks Like A Mule remix) – 5:10\nMusic video\nThe music video was posted on the band's Myspace and YouTube pages on 3 April 2009, after being postponed from an exclusive broadcast on Channel 4 the week before. It was directed by Corin Hardy.\nIt uses a mix of puppetry and stop-frame animation, with three humanoid cigarette packets branded with various Prodigy logos (representing the three members of the band) starting a miniature rave within a pub with other cigarette packages, eventually causing a fire on top of a table. The three Prodigy cigarette boxes then leave, leaving the rest of the dancing cigarette packages to continue burning. A man enters the pub to open up the next morning, puzzled to find all the burnt cardboard remains. Cigarette boxes contain the message \"Smoking is harmful to your health\" in Ukrainian language (\"Куріння шкодить вашому здоров'ю\").\nThe video won an award at the 2009 Rushes Soho Shorts Film Festival for best music video.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2009)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Austrian Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|54\n|-\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|44\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2009)\n!Position\n|-\n|UK Singles (OCC)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|87\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
