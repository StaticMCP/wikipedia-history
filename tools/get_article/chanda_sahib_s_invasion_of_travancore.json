In the event, the Carnatic Sultanate invaded the Kingdom of Travancore, resulting in the Carnatic forces defeating the Travancore army led by Ramayyan Dalawa.\nChanda Sahib occupied Travancore territories such as Nagarcoil, Suchindram and Kottar. Marthanda Varma, the Travancore King, offered presents to Dost Ali Khan, the Nawab of the Carnatic Sultanate. Dost Ali Khan accepted the presents and gave the territories back to Travancore.\nBackground\nMarthanda Varma ruled the Kingdom of Travancore from 1729 to 1758. His reign saw conflicts with the Dutch East India Company. Meanwhile, the Carnatic Sultanate was under the rule of Nawab Dost Ali Khan, with Chanda Sahib serving as the Nawab's General and also his son-in-law.\nIn March 1740, Dost Ali Khan, the Nawab of Arcot, dispatched Chanda Sahib and Baba Sahib to conquer certain territories on behalf of his son, Safdar Ali Khan. Chanda Sahib and Safdar Ali Khan advanced towards Travancore with the Carnatic army, eventually reaching its territories. The Travancore army, already engaged in conflicts with the Dutch in another region, struggled to focus on repelling the Sultanate's invasion.\nChanda Sahib's forces achieved a successful invasion of Travancore's territories, capturing places like Nagercoil, Suchindram, and Kottar. The Travancore forces, led by Ramayyan Dalawa, suffered defeat, and Chanda Sahib's army captured Tovala..\nAftermath\nFollowing the invasion, Marthanda Varma offered 120,000 gold coins and 6 elephants to Dost Ali Khan, who accepted the presents and gave the territories back to Marthanda Varma.\nSee also\n*Battle of Colachel\nReferences"
