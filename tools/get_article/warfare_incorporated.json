In 2014 the game became open-sourced and freeware under the name Hostile Takeover.\nPlot\nWarfare Incorporated is set in a future ruled by super corporations engaged in no-holds-barred competition for the resources of the galaxy. The game focuses on two specific corporations (ACME and OMNI), who are fighting over the newly discovered planet Icarus, which holds a great wealth of galaxite, a rare and valuable mineral needed for teleportation. Players take the role of Andy Whitmore, a junior executive at the underdog ACME Exploration Corporation, who discovered Icarus. The player must attempt to work their way up the corporate ladder by mining the planet and finding missing security specialist Gordon Fox. Over the course of the game, ACME discovers mysterious alien technologies, such as a machine that can duplicate objects, as well as a new enemy for humanity.\nGameplay\nThe game has similar gameplay to Command & Conquer and StarCraft, but it combines elements of both. It was one of the first applications for PDA to feature Bluetooth and Wi-Fi multiplayer support.\nOnline Gameplay\nPlayers have the option to play online multiplayer as well as campaign, using a variety of maps designed by Spiffcode Inc. Users may also download custom-made maps created by other users. Players can either decide to make an account in order to qualify for leaderboards or to play anonymously.\nMap Editor\nPlayers can create and publish their own maps with Spiffcode's desktop-based mission editor, \"M\". The latest version of the map editor was released in 2009.\nDevelopment\nWarfare Incorporated was developed by Spiffcode and published by Handmark for Palm OS, Pocket PC, PDAs and Tapwave Zodiac in 2003. In 2008, it was ported to iOS devices. In July 2014 the game's source code and content got open-sourced with the BSD license under the name Hostile Takeover on GitHub.
