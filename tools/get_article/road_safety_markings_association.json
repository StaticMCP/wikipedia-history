Initially based in Charlwood, Surrey, it had offices in Bury, Greater Manchester from 1998 to 2006, prior to setting up offices and a national training centre in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.\nFunction\nAs a trade association RSMA represents and promotes the legitimate business interests of the UK road marking sector (it has provided evidence to the House of Commons Transport Select Committee, for example). It also provides specialist services to member organisations, and undertakes research and marketing activities to identify the safety and economic benefits of road markings use - many of which are made from thermoplastics. For example, in 2014, an RSMA survey found that 52% of markings on motorways, 42% on dual carriageways, and 48% on single carriageways, all needed replacing immediately or imminently.\nThe RSMA publishes specialist trade publications including Top Marks (circulated to over 8000 industry specialists), and member publication (and e-publication) On the Line.\nIt offers industry training to companies and local authorities via its NHA subsidiary, established in 2007. As part of this, it runs the Specialist Applied-Skills Programme (SAP).\nStructure\nThe RSMA has representative committees specialising in health and safety, and technical issues.\nMembership\nRSMA has 65 members throughout the UK and Europe.\nSee also\n]]\n* Road signs in the United Kingdom\n* Highways Agency\n* Road Safety Foundation\n* Highway Code (first published in 1934)\n* Institute of Highway Engineers\n* Living Streets (UK)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rsma.co.uk RSMA]\n* [http://hiconfed.com/index.htm Highway Industries Confederation]\n* [http://www.nhasolutions.co.uk NHA]\n* [http://www.roadsafetycontracts.com Road Safety Contracts]"
