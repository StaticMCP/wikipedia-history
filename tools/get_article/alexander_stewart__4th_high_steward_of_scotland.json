He also seems to have made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain and in honour of the saint baptised his eldest surviving son James, a name rare before then in Scotland. In 1255 he appears as one of the Regents of Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. He commanded the Scottish army at Largs in October 1263, successfully defending Scotland against attempted invasion by King Haakon IV of Norway. It appears to have been in his time that the Stewarts acquired the lordship of the Cowal Peninsula, with their castle at Dunoon. He is recorded as playing a prominent part in affairs during the reign of Alexander, being referred to as senescallus Scotie (steward of Scotland) instead of the older dapifer regis Scotie (steward of the king of Scotland), so indicating that he held a major office of state that was significant nationally rather than just being a courtier in the royal household.\nHe died in 1282, and was succeeded by his son James.\nFamily\nHis wife is said to have been named Jean, and they had four documented children:\n*James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland\n*Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll\n*Elizabeth Stewart, who married Sir William le Hardi, Lord of Douglas.\n*Hawise Stewart, who married John de Soules\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Lauder-Frost, Gregory, F.S.A.Scot., \"East Anglian Stewarts\" in The Scottish Genealogist, Dec.2004, vol.LI, no.4., pps:151-161.\n*\n*\n*Nisbet, Alexander, 1722.
