He was later transferred to the British Protectorate of the Federated Malay States. Clifford arrived in Malaya in 1883, aged 17.\nHe first became a cadet in the State of Perak. During his twenty years there and on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula in Pahang, Clifford socialised with the local Malays and studied their language and culture deeply. He came to sympathise strongly with and admire certain aspects of the traditional indigenous cultures, while recognising that their transformation as a consequence of the colonial project which he served was inevitable. He was a Government agent of Pahang (1887-1888), Superintendent of Ulu Pahang (1889), served as British Resident at Pahang, 1896–1900 and 1901–1903, and Governor of North Borneo, 1900–1901.\nIn 1903, he left Malaya to take the post of Colonial Secretary of Trinidad and Tobago. Later he was appointed Governor of British Ceylon (1907-1912), Governor of the Gold Coast, 1912–1919, Nigeria, 1919–1925, and Ceylon, 1925–1927. During his service in Malaya and afterwards he wrote numerous stories, reflections and novels primarily about Malayan life, many of them imbued with an ambivalent nostalgia. His last posting was, for him, a welcome return to the Malaya he loved, as Governor of the Straits Settlements and British High Commissioner in Malaya, where he served from 1927 until 1929, after which Lady Clifford's ill-health forced his retirement. Alongside his other books he wrote Farther India (the book title itself is referencing an old term referring to Southeast Asia) which chronicles European explorations and discoveries in Southeast Asia.\nPersonal life\nOn 15 April 1896, Clifford married Minna à Beckett, the only child of Gilbert Arthur à Beckett. Before her death on 14 January 1907, they had one son and two daughters:\n* Hugh Gilbert Francis Clifford (1897–1916), who was killed on 1 July 1916, on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, aged 19.\n* Mary Agnes Philippa Clifford (1898–1978), who married Maj.-Gen. Sir Noel Galway Holmes, a son of Capt. Harry W. Holmes, in 1920.\n* Monica Elizabeth Mary Clifford (1903–1965), who married Maj. Cecil Edward Trafford, son of Edward Southwell Trafford and Hon. Eleanor Mary Petre (a daughter of the 12th Baron Petre), in 1925. After his death, she married Maj. Richard Desiré Girouard, a son of Maj.-Gen. Sir Edward Percy Cranwell Girouard and widower of Blanche Girouard ( Lady Blanche Beresford), in 1952.\nOn 24 September 1910 Clifford remarried, to Elizabeth Lydia Rosabelle Bonham, CBE, daughter of Edward Bonham of Bramling, Kent, a British consul. A Catholic, she was the widow of Henry Philip Ducarel de la Pasture of Llandogo Priory, Monmouthshire. Clifford thus became stepfather to E. M. Delafield, author of the Provincial Lady'' series.\nClifford died peacefully on 18 December 1941 in his native Roehampton. His widow, Elizabeth, died on 30 October 1945.\nLegacy\nSeveral schools in Malaysia are named Clifford School in his honour, such as;\n* SK Clifford, Kuala Lipis\n* SMK Clifford, Kuala Lipis\n* SK Clifford, Kuala Kangsar\n* SMK Clifford, Kuala Kangsar\nClifford Pier in Singapore was built between 1927 and 1933, and was named after Sir Hugh Clifford when he was the former Governor of the Straits Settlements between 1927 and 1930. It was opened on 3 June 1933.\nIn popular culture\nClifford is briefly referred to in V. S. Naipaul's The Mimic Men. Though he was Colonial Secretary of Trinidad and Tobago (second in command to the Governor), in the book he is named as a former Governor of Isabella, a fictitious Caribbean island based on Trinidad.\nHonours\nClifford was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1909, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 1921 Birthday Honours, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1926.\nPublications\n*A Dictionary of the Malay Language (1894–1902). Co-authored with Frank Swettenham, the dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter 'G' as by then it had been made redundant by the publication of R.J.
