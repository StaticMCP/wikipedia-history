In 1988, the school graduated its first class of 22 seniors, attending classes in a 12-room school building. By the fall of 1988, Queen Creek High had 387 students. Two years later, its principal retired in an uproar over the alteration of the low grades of 50 students. The fast-growing school, housed in a former elementary school with additional portable classroom buildings, was approved in 1999 to move to a new site at Signal Butte and Ocotillo roads The new school opened in 2002 and allowed Queen Creek's middle school to absorb the former high school site.\nIn November 2012, their football team won the Division III state championship with an undefeated 14–0 season.\nThe Queen Creek Unified School District opened a second high school, Eastmark High School, in 2019, with the northern portion of the district being zoned into the new school.\nNotable alumni\n*Jacob Berry, baseball player\n*Kody Funderburk, baseball player\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
