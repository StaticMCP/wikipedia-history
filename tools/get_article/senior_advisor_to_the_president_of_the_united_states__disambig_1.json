Senior advisors to the president do not have formal government decision making authority, but they can have significant influence over decisions. Their role is to provide strategic advice, analysis, and recommendations to the president on key issues.\nWhite House senior advisors are senior members of the White House Office. The title has been formally used since 1993.\nResponsibilities\nOver time, a senior advisor has had responsibility for the following groups:\nWhite House departments (previously headed by a senior advisor in past administrations)\n* White House Office of Strategic Initiatives\n* Office of American Innovation\n* White House Office of Political Affairs\n* Oval Office Operations\n* White House Office on Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation\n* White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs\n* White House Office of Public Engagement\n* White House Office of Communications\n* White House Office of Press Operations\n* American Rescue Plan / COVID-19 Relief\n* White House Office of the Staff Secretary\n* White House Office of Infrastructure Implementation Coordination\nPrior administrations\nIn prior administrations before 1993, the position of \"senior advisor\" was a title used for various other purposes. Numerous examples of the position also exist throughout the executive departments and in the branch's independent agencies. For example, the Food and Drug Administration includes a position with the title Senior Advisor for Science; the Department of the Interior has a position with the title Senior Advisor for Alaskan Affairs.\nExamples of people who had the responsibilities and/or influence of a senior advisor without the title included Edward M. House (to Woodrow Wilson) and Louis Howe (to Franklin D. Roosevelt)\nList of senior advisors to the president\nSenior advisors to Bill Clinton\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Senior Advisor\n!Portfolio\n!Term of office\n!Party\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n|\n|Rahm Emanuel\n|Political AffairsStrategic PlanningPolicy\n|January 20, 1993 – November 7, 1998\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Democratic\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n|\n|George Stephanopoulos\n|Strategic PlanningPolicy\n|June 7, 1993 – December 10, 1996\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n|\n|Sidney Blumenthal\n|Political AffairsCommunicationsPolicy\n|August 19, 1997 – January 20, 2001\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n|\n|Doug Sosnik\n|Political AffairsStrategic PlanningPolicy\n|November 7, 1998 – January 20, 2001\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n|\n|Joel Johnson\n|CommunicationsPolicy\n|May 20, 1999 – January 20, 2001\n|-\n|}\nSenior advisors to George W.
