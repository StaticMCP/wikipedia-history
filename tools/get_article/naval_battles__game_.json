      "text": "# Naval Battles (game)\n\nNaval Battles (full title — Naval Battles:  World War II on the High Seas) is a turn-based, card-driven wargame based on naval combat during World War II.  Designed by Dan Verssen and published by Phalanx Games, the game is playable by 2 or more players, each commanding a fleet with the objective of sinking a certain amount of their opponents' ships.\nEach player arranges an initial fleet, with each ship represented by a card.  A reserve fleet is also arranged available to join the battle later as needed.  Additionally, there is a deck of action cards the player draws from.  In the process of their turn, a player plays cards to fire weapons and take other actions.  Attack actions are usually related to a specific type of weapon mount, as detailed on the ship card.  To use the attack card, the player must have a ship with the appropriate weapon mount listed.  Cards may also be played by other players to defend their ships from attack.\nShips represented\n*\n** Aircraft Carriers\n*** Commandant Teste\n** Battleships\n*** Courbet\n*** France\n*** Jean Bart\n*** Paris\n*** Richelieu\n** Cruisers\n*** Colbert\n*** Foch\n*** La Galissonnière\n*** Suffren\n** Destroyers\n*** Mogador\n*** Volta\n** Submarine\n*** Saphir\n*\n** Aircraft Carrier\n*** Graf Zeppelin\n** Battleships\n*** Bismarck\n*** Gneisenau\n*** Scharnhorst\n*** Tirpitz\n** Cruisers\n*** Admiral Hipper\n*** Prinz Eugen\n** Destroyers\n*** Erich Giese\n*** Schnellboot\n*** T13\n*** T61\n** Submarines\n*** Type IXA\n*** Type XXI\n*\n** Battleships\n*** Andrea Doria\n*** Conte de Cavour\n*** Littorio\n*** Vittorio Veneto\n** Cruisers\n*** Capitani Romani\n*** Fiume\n*** Gorizia\n*** Muzio Attendolo\n*** Raimondo Montecuccoli\n*** Zara\n** Destroyers\n*** Aliseo\n*** Ciclone\n** Submarine\n*** Adua\n*\n** Aircraft carriers\n*** Hiryū\n*** Shōhō\n** Battleships\n*** Nagato\n*** Yamato\n** Cruisers\n*** Aoba\n*** Kashii\n*** Kashima\n*** Katori\n*** Mikuma\n*** Mogami\n** Destroyers\n*** Kagero\n*** Shimakaze\n** Submarines\n*** I-174\n*\n** Aircraft carrier\n***\n** Battleships\n***\n***\n***\n** Cruisers\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n** Destroyers\n***\n***\n***\n** Submarine\n***\n*\n** Aircraft carriers\n***\n***\n** Battleships\n***\n***\n***\n***\n** Cruisers\n***\n***\n***\n** Destroyers\n***\n***\n***\n** Submarines\n***\nExternal links\n*"
