(Breasted notes that his work covers only ancient “historical documents”, and generally does not include ancient Egyptian literature, religious writings, or texts on science, mathematics, or medicine.)\n* Volume I, The First to the Seventeenth Dynasties\n* Volume II, The Eighteenth Dynasty\n* Volume III, The Nineteenth Dynasty\n* Volume IV, The Twentieth to the Twenty-Sixth Dynasties\n* Volume V, Indices\nIt was part of a proposed three-part set of translations of original texts by different authors, which at the time were difficult to find:\n* History of Egypt (five volumes)\n* History of Assyria (two volumes)\n* History of Mesopotamia\nOnly the first two collections — those from Egypt and Assyria — were published.\nReferences"
