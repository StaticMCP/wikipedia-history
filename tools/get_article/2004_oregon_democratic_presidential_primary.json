Bush in the general election. By the time of the May 18 primary, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry had already attained enough delegates to ensure his nomination, and most other candidates had dropped out of the race.\nCampaign\nAlthough Kerry had already secured the nomination, Kucinich spent weeks actively campaigning in the state, making public appearances and running TV ads. He hoped that a successful showing in Oregon would influence Kerry to adopt more liberal issue positions. Kucinich's best showings in the primary had been in the Hawaii and Alaska caucuses, having won over a quarter of the vote in each.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |2004 Oregon Democratic presidential primary\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Pledgeddelegates\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |John Kerry\n|289,804\n|78.63\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |40\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Dennis Kucinich\n|60,019\n|16.29\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Write-ins\n|10,150\n|2.75\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Lyndon LaRouche\n|8,571\n|2.33\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total\n!368,544\n!100%\n!46\n|}\nAnalysis\nAlthough the Oregon primary coincided with primaries in Kentucky and Arkansas, analysts were especially interested in the results in Oregon, as the state was expected to be a battleground in the general election. The Los Angeles Times quoted an Oregon pollster who interpreted the results as an indication that \"Democrats will stomach a lot to get rid of George Bush this year\", regardless of their feelings about Kerry.\nReferences"
