After a first attempt to relieve Paris had been checked at the battle of Bapaume, the French were planning another relief effort.\nVon Goeben marched his army north and met the irregular French army under General Louis Faidherbe near Saint-Quentin. On 19 January the Prussians attacked and decisively defeated the French forces. The same day General Trochu attempted a breakout of Paris but it too was defeated. No other significant attempts would be made to lift the siege of Paris.\nSources\n* ''Compton's Home Library:'' Battles of the World\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027102801/http://geocities.com/fpwar1870/history.html  History of the Franco Prussian War]"
