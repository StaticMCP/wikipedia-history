He may have been one of the most consequential Alameda County Sheriffs due to his attempts to incorporate rehabilitation into incarceration. He also sought to improve law enforcement training and professionalization in his department and the Northern California region. He established the original Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center near Dublin in 1947.\nEarly life\nGleason was born in Johnstown, New York on August 31, 1893. He attended school there and played baseball while in high school. His family moved to Oakland in 1909.\nEarly adulthood\nAccording to some sources, Gleason played semi-pro baseball until 1917. He enlisted in the Navy that year and served in several locations, including aboard the  and  (ID 2168). He left service in 1920. He completed service as a Chief Boatswain’s Mate.\nGleason played professional baseball with the Pittsburg Pirates and St. Louis Browns from 1920 through 1922. Another newspaper article said he had played with “several minor league teams, and in 1923, an injured knee put him on the shelf for all time.\"\nIn late 1922, he returned to Oakland and found a position with the Oakland Tribune. He later became the manager of the Circulation Department for the paper. He married Anne Ziehn in 1928. In 1936, he resigned and became a deputy sheriff in Alameda County.\nThroughout the 1930s he was prominent in veterans’ organizations and Republican Party activities.\nLaw enforcement career\nGleason joined the Sheriff’s Office as a deputy and served in several positions. A 1941 article noted that Gleason “… has served in virtually all departments of the sheriff’s office, his most recent assignment being bailiff in Superior Judge John D. Murphy’s Court.\" Gleason was appointed by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors as Under-Sheriff on July 1, 1940, in part to support ailing Sheriff Mchael B. Driver. In November Sheriff Driver resigned due to ill health. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors appointed Gleason as Sheriff on November 28, 1940.\nDuring the next 22 years, Gleason easily won re-election. During his tenure, he was credited with several accomplishments. He negotiated the transfer of a former US Navy Disciplinary Barracks to replace the former county jail. He established the Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center in 1947, which eventually incorporated innovations including a women’s division, clinics for alcoholics and drug addicts, and the first full-time county prison chaplain. For a time, Santa Rita was considered one of the state’s most well-run county jails. Rehabilitation efforts included a fully functioning farm whose efforts provided goods and services that offset a majority of the county jail’s cost. Other accomplishments included establishing the first county crime laboratory, the first introduction of two-person patrol cars with two-way radio communication to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, establishing a 40 hour work week for field deputies, hiring the first African American deputy sheriff, promoting the first African American captain, and promoting the first woman captain. Gleason also helped organize the first peace officers’ training school in Northern California. He was the President, National Sheriff’s Association, for the 1956/57 and 1957/58 terms.\nGleason retired on January 1, 1963. He was succeeded as sheriff by Frank Madigan.\nDeath\nGleason died on March 4, 1967.\nReferences"
