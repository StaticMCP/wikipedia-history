In 2007, Sri Lanka were scheduled to compete in the Asia/Oceania Zone Group II in Christchurch, New Zealand, but, together with Syria, withdrew because of a terrorist threat. After competing in 2008, Sri Lanka were listed for the 2009 Asia/Oceania Zone Group II, but did not take part.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
