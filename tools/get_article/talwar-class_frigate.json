The Talwar-class guided missile frigates are the improved versions of the Krivak III-class (Project 1135) frigates used by the Russian Coast Guard. The design has been further developed as the  for the Russian Navy.\nDesigned by Severnoye Design Bureau, the first batch of ships were built by Baltic Shipyard and the second and third batch by Yantar Shipyard. Preceded by the Brahmaputra-class frigates, the Talwar-class frigates are said to have semi-stealth features and better armament. The Indian Navy currently operates eight of these ships and two more are under construction at the Goa Shipyard in India.\nHistory\nBatch-I\nOn 17 November 1997, Russia and India signed a $1 billion contract, for three Krivak III-class multi-purpose frigates. The Indian Navy wanted to fill the gap created by the decommissioning of the s until the Project 17-class frigates entered service.\nAfter the signing of the contract, Severnoye Design Bureau began a detail design layout and the shipbuilder, Baltisky Zavod of St. Petersburg, began preparations for their construction. The project involved around 130 suppliers from Russia, India, Britain, Germany, Denmark, Belarus, Ukraine and other countries including over 30 St. Petersburg-based naval design organizations and institutes.\nThe first frigate, INS Talwar was delivered in May 2002. The second, INS Trishul, was delivered in November 2002 and the third, INS Tabar, in May 2003. The Russian firm delayed the delivery of three frigates by 13 months, 7 months and 11 months respectively. The contract stipulated the levy of liquidated damages for the delays and the same worked out to the equivalent of 38.5 million. This was yet to be recovered as of December 2005.\nBatch-II\nThe Government of India signed a follow-on contract for the purchase of three additional frigates on 14 July 2006. These ships will be built at Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad. The first frigate was scheduled for delivery in April 2011. These ships will feature BrahMos supersonic anti-ship cruise missile instead of the Klub-N/3M54TE missile system which was provided to the Talwar, Trishul and Tabar frigates.\nBatch-III\nIn July 2012, India Today reported the start of talks about purchasing three additional Talwar-class frigates (No.7 to No.9). In March 2016, it was reported that India and Russia are still negotiating the purchase of the additional ships.\nIn September 2016, it was reported that India would acquire two s from Russia and remaining two will be built in India. These frigates are based on the Talwar class and were to be commissioned into the Russian Navy, but after the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war, Ukraine refused to supply any more engines for the Russian ships. As of then, only two of the six have been commissioned by Russia. In August 2017, the Indian Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) cleared a proposal of  to buy two gas turbines from Zorya-Mashproekt in Ukraine for the s being built in Russia. Each M7N1 system includes two DT59 top speed (boost) gas turbines, two DS71 cruise turbines, two R063, one R1063 reduction gears and its control system. It can provide a total power output of . The powerplants were delivered to Kaliningrad Shipyard in late 2020 to early 2021.\nIn October 2018, Indian Ministry of Defence signed a deal for  for procuring two s, Admiral Butakov (renamed INS Tushil) and Admiral Istomin (renamed INS Tamala). The two frigates was scheduled to be delivered to Indian Navy by 2022. The last frigate, the former Admiral Kornilov, is to be sold abroad. (Total: 3 ships built for the Russian Navy, 3 ships under construction for sale abroad).\nOn 11 March 2024, reports emerged that INS Tushil, being built by Yantar Shipyard has started sea trials. The initial Pennant number is 435. In April 2024, a report suggested that INS Tushil will be delivered to India in September 2024 whereas INS Tamala will be handed over in February 2025. The timeline is on track as of July 2024. As of July 2024, to conduct acceptance trials for the two frigates being built in Yantar shipyard, a team of around 200 personnel of the Indian Navy are in Russia. It was reported in September 2024 that INS Tushil is to be commissioned by 2024-end. INS Tushil was commissioned by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on 9 December 2024 during a formal visit to Russia. The frigate was handed over to the Indian crew of over 200 officers and sailors at Kaliningrad Shipyard.\nThe latter INS Tamal is to be delivered in early 2025. As of February 2025, INS Tamal is to be commissioned in early June 2025 following delivery acceptance trials.\nOn 20 March 2025, the Defence Acquisition Council approved the procurement of Shtil-1 missiles for the upgraded Talwar-class frigates.\nThe Indian Navy commissioned INS Tamal in Russia on 1 July 2025. The commissioning ceremony was presided over by Vice Admiral Sanjay Jasjit Singh, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Naval Command of the Indian Navy, in the presence of many high-ranking Indian and Russian government and defence officials.\nBatch-IV\nA contract, worth , was signed between Rosoboronexport and Goa Shipyard for the construction of 2 frigates under license on 20 November 2018. The two frigates will be armed with BrahMos missile system and will include a host of Indian equipment and will be delivered by 2027. The contract for the two ships was awarded to Goa Shipyard Limited by the Government of India on 30 January 2019. The two frigates being built at Goa Shipyard will boast much higher indigenous content and will be named Triput class frigate. The new class of ship will feature BHEL-manufactured OTO Melara 76 mm gun instead of its Russian counterpart, along with other Indian weapon and sensors.\nIn September 2021, India ordered two sets of modified M7N2E units for Batch-4 frigates at the coast of $100 million which has upgrades like microprocessor control system and a power output of , higher than previous subclasses. The powerplants are scheduled to be delivered by December 2022 and July 2023, respectively.\nOn 23 July 2024, INS Triput was launched by GSL shipyard. As of then, the delivery of INS Triput is expected in 2026 and the next ship shall be delivered after 6 months of the former.\nAs of February 2025, the last ship of the class was to be launched within few months and the schedules were on track.\nOn 20 March 2025, the Defence Acquisition Council approved the procurement of Shtil-1 missiles for the upgraded Talwar-class frigates.\nThe last of the locally produced Talwar-class frigate, Tavasya, was launched at Goa Shipyard on 22 March 2025.\nDesign and description\n, UK.]]\nThe Severnoye Design Bureau developed the Project 1135.6 vessel using an earlier Project 1135.1 design, which dated back to the early 1980s. The ship's redesigned topside and hull has a considerably reduced radar cross-section. While the superstructure sides are sloped and relatively clean, the very cluttered topside of the ship cannot be remotely described as having any signature reducing features. These frigates will be the first Indian Navy warships to incorporate some stealth features. The ship's hull is characterized by outward flare and tumblehome, while the superstructure (which forms a continuous junction with the hull) has a large fixed tumblehome angle.\nPower plant\nThe Talwars features the Zorya designed and Mashproekt (Ukraine) manufactured M7N.1E gas turbine plant which comprises two DS-71 cruise turbines and two DT-59 boost turbines in two engine rooms. The cruising component consists of two DS-71 gas-turbine engines, each rated at  in forward running, and  in reverse. Two cruising RO63 two-speed gearboxes and one cruising R1063 auxiliary gearbox which makes it possible to use any of the cruising engines to drive both propeller shafts. A boost component with two DT-59.1 gas-turbine engines, each rated at  forward running,  in reverse and two RO58 single-speed reduction gearboxes. The four gas turbines are mounted on isolated cradles which minimize their contact with the hull and thereby considerably reduce the transmission of her vibration and sound.\nElectrical power is provided by four 1&nbsp;MW Wärtsilä WCM-1000 generator sets with Cummins KTA50G3 engines and Kirloskar 1&nbsp;MV AC generators. The contract for the generators was signed with Wärtsilä Denmark.\nFlight deck\nThe Talwar class can accommodate one Ka-28 Helix-A antisubmarine helicopter or one Ka-31 Helix-B airborne early warning helicopter which can provide over-the-horizon targeting. The vessel can also embark the navalised variant of the indigenous HAL Dhruv.\nArmament\nThe frigates are armed with a new 3M-54 Klub anti-ship system with a vertical missile launcher, Shtil-1 multi-channel medium-range surface-to-air missile system (an export version of the SA-N-12 \"Grizzly\"), a Kashtan anti-aircraft missile and artillery system, a RBU-6000 depth charge launcher and Puma-Universal artillery system. These ships are designed to carry and operate one heavy duty helicopter.\nOverview\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Batch I\n!Batch II\n!Batch III\n!Batch IV\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#e3e9e9;\" |\n|-\n|8 × VLS launched Klub, anti-ship cruise missiles\n| colspan=\"3\" |8 × VLS launched BrahMos, anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#e3e9e9;\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |1 × Shtil-1 single-arm surface-to-air missile launcher (24 missiles)\n| colspan=\"2\" |2 × 12-cell Shtil-1 vertical launching system (VLS) surface-to-air missiles\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |8 × Igla-1E (SA-16) MANPADS based point-defence surface-to-air missile system\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#e3e9e9;\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n* 1 × A-190E 100 mm naval gun [All; except INS Trishul (F43)]\n* 1 × OTO Melara 76 mm naval gun [INS Trishul (F43)]\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n* 2 × AK-630 CIWS [All; except INS Talwar (F40) and INS Tabar (F44)]\n* 2 × Kashtan CIWS [INS Talwar (F40) and INS Tabar (F44)]\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#e3e9e9;\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n* 2 × twin 533mm DTA-53-11356 torpedo tubes\n* 1 × RBU-6000 (RPK-8) rocket launcher\n|}\nPrimary weapon\nIn the main strike role, an eight-cell 3S14E vertical missile launcher is fitted, which accommodates the 3M-54E Klub-N anti-ship missile developed by the Novator Design Bureau. The Agat Research and Production Enterprise has supplied the 3R14N-11356 shipborne fire-control system associated with the Klub-N. The 3M-54E Klub is an  long missile using active radar guidance with a range of . It is a three-stage missile in which the terminal stage reaches supersonic velocity (Mach 2.9) when it is approximately  from its target.\nThe later batches of 7 ships (Teg onwards) are fitted with the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, which has a range of  and a cruising speed of Mach 2.8 throughout its flight.\nIn May 2015, the Defence Acquisition Council of the Indian Ministry of Defence cleared the procurement of nine systems of BrahMos cruise missiles to equip the first batch of Talwar-class frigates as well as three of the s at a cost of . By 2024, the Klub missile launchers on INS Talwar and INS Tabar of the first batch was replaced by BrahMos-capable UVLM launchers while the same change for INS Trishul yet to be done.\nAir defence\nThe Shtil-1 SAM system with a 3S-90 single rail missile launcher is fitted forward of the bridge and is armed with the 9M317 (SA-N-12 \"Grizzly\", navalised SA-17) missile. 24 missiles are carried in a magazine located below deck. Guidance and target illumination for these missiles is provided by four MR-90 Orekh (NATO: Front Dome) radars, which are connected to a command and control post. The SA-N-12 missile uses a combination of inertial guidance and semi-active radar homing to its maximum range of . The  blast-fragmentation warhead is triggered by a radar proximity fuze. The missile's control system and warhead can be adjusted to a specific target following target recognition, which increases hit probability. Eight Igla-1E (SA-16) portable air defence missiles are also carried.\nHowever, the configuration of Shtil-1 missiles were changed into vertical launching system (VLS) with an enhanced range of  for Batch-3 and Batch-4 frigates. The single rail launchers were replaced by two 12 (2×6)-missile launcher configuration.\nMain gun\nOne 100&nbsp;mm A-190E gun is fitted forward for use against ship and shore based targets The A-190(E) uses a lightweight gun mount with an automatic gun and fuze setter. Fire control is provided by the 5P-10E Puma FCS. The gun can fire 60 rounds a minute out to a range of . The weight of each shell is .\nBy 2023, INS Trishul had her 100mm gun replaced by a OTO Melara 76 mm SRGM (Super Rapid Gun Mount) paired with BEL Lynx-U2 FCS naval gun after her refit. The other ships of the class may be similarly modified.\nThe gun features higher automation of fire preparation and control and employs advanced guided and rocket-assisted long-range and enhanced-lethality projectiles fitted with dual-mode impact/proximity fuzes. Together with the use of the muzzle velocity meter, it is designed to produce increased combat capability. In addition, the gun turret features stealth technology to minimize the radar signature of a ship.\nClose-in weapon system (CIWS)\nFor the CIWS role, two Kashtan air defence gun and missile systems are used. Each system consists of two GSh-30k (AO-18K) six-barreled 30&nbsp;mm Gatling guns, fed by a link-less mechanism, and two SA-N-11 (navalised variant of the 9M311, SA-19) SAM clusters. The system also includes a storing and reloading system to keep 32 SAMs in container-launchers in the vessel's under-deck spaces. The later batches of 7 ships (Teg onwards) are fitted with the AK-630 system, replacing the Kashtan system in the earlier ships. After her mid-life refit, INS Trishul has also been fitted with the AK-630 in place of the Kashtan system.\nAnti-submarine warfare\nThe ships carry the RPK-8 system, which uses a 12-barrelled RBU-6000 ASW rocket launcher to fire the 212&nbsp;mm 90R anti-submarine rocket or RGB-60 depth charges. The firing range is from , and the depth of engagement is up to .\nTwo twin 533&nbsp;mm DTA-53-11356 fixed torpedo tube launchers are fitted amidships and fire the SET-65E/53-65KE torpedoes. The Purga anti-submarine fire-control system provides control for both the RBU-6000 and DTA-53 launchers.\nElectronics and sensors\nRadar\n*Surface search: One 3Ts-25E Garpun-B radar at I-band frequency, using both active and passive channels, provides long-range surface target designation. One MR-212/201-1 radar at I-band frequency is used for navigation and a separate Kelvin Hughes Nucleus-2 6000A radar set is used for short-range navigation and surface surveillance. Also fitted with a Ladoga-ME-11356 inertial navigation and stabilisation suite supplied by Elektropribor.\n*Air/surface search: One Fregat M2EM (NATO: Top Plate) 3D circular scan radar at E-band frequency, provides target indication to the Shtil-1 missile system. Featuring continuous electronically scanned arrays, the radar rotates at 12 or 6 rpm and has an instrumented range to 300&nbsp;km.\n*Fire control: Features a Ratep JSC 5P-10E Puma fire control system, consisting of a phased array and target tracking radar along with laser and TV devices. The system, fitted above the bridge deck, features in-flight course correction updates via data links, has a maximum detection range of 60&nbsp;km, operates autonomously and is capable of automatically locking on to four targets and tracking them.\nSonar\nAccording to some reports, the APSOH (Advanced Panoramic Sonar Hull) hull-mounted sonar is fitted on the vessels. The APSOH sonar performs active ranging, passive listening, auto tracking of targets and classification. Other reports indicate that the BEL HUMSA (Hull Mounted Sonar Array) sonar is fitted. The HUMSA is a panoramic medium-range active/passive sonar system developed by the Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory (NPOL).\nInformation released from the Severnoye Design Bureau (SDB) indicate that French towed array sonars (TAS) are also fitted. This is very plausible given that many Indian Navy ships now use French TAS, however INS Talwar shows no signs of such a system. The vessel may also have a Russian SSN-137 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) with NATO reporting name Steer Hide, providing active search with medium frequency, and the sonar might be license produced in India with Indian designation SSSN-113.\nCountermeasures\nThe frigate features the Russian-made TK-25E-5 integrated electronic warfare suite, which comprises a wideband electronic support measures system that has antenna arrays mounted in the superstructure and a multimode jammer. Four KT-216 decoy launchers, forming part of the PK-10 system, are fitted for soft-kill defence. A total of 120 120mm chaff and infrared decoy rounds are carried on board.\nSome ships of the class including INS Tabar have had their TK-25E-5 ESM suites replaced with BEL manufactured Varuna ESM systems with their distinctive circular housing located above the Fregat radar.\nCombat data system\n*The Trebovaniye-M combat information and control platform is a fully distributed combat management system. It controls all platforms of attack and defence weapons, independently generates combat missions based on situation analysis, determines optimal number of missile firings, displays information on the state of ship-borne weaponry and transmits data to protection systems.\n*Interconnected via an Ethernet LAN, Trebovaniye-M features eight T-171 full-colour operator workstations (with 18-inch colour flat panel displays) and three central T-162 servers. Individual items of combat system equipment interface to Trebovaniye-M via T-119 and T-190 bus interface units. Raw radar data is received through a T-181 data reception unit.\nShips of the class\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Pennant\n!Builder\n!Laid Down\n!Launched\n!Commissioned\n!Status\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Batch 1\n|-\n|\n| F40\n| rowspan=3|Baltic Shipyard\n| 10 March 1999\n| 12 May 2000\n| 18 June 2003\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Active\n|-\n|\n| F43\n| 24 September 1999\n| 24 November 2000\n| 25 June 2003\n|-\n|\n| F44\n| 26 May 2000\n| 25 May 2001\n| 19 April 2004\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Batch 2\n|-\n|\n| F45\n| rowspan=3|Yantar Shipyard\n| July 2007\n| 27 November 2009\n| 27 April 2012\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Active\n|-\n|\n| F50\n| November 2007\n| 23 June 2010\n| 9 November 2012\n|-\n|\n| F51\n| 11 June 2008\n| 25 May 2011\n| 29 June 2013\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Batch 3\n|-\n|\n|F70\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Yantar Shipyard\n| 13 July 2013\n| 28 October 2021\n|9 December 2024\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Active\n|-\n| Tamal\n|F71\n| 15 November 2013\n| 24 February 2022\n|1 July 2025\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Batch 4\n|-\n| Triput\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Goa Shipyard\n| 29 January 2021\n| 23 July 2024\n| October 2026 (exp.)\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Launched\n|-\n| Tavasya\n|\n| 18 June 2021\n| 22 March 2025\n| 2027 (exp.)\n|}\nSee also\n* List of active Indian Navy ships\n* Future ships of the Indian Navy\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Ships/Active/180-Talwar-Class.html Talwar Class – Bharat Rakshak]\n*[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Ships/Future/189-Frigate.html Modified Krivak III Class – Bharat Rakshak]\n*[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/d-talwar.htm Talwar Class – Global Security]\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20101130065246/http://russian-ships.info/eng/warships/project_11356.htm All Talwar Class Frigates – Complete Ship List]"
