Until in 1972, few of the Hong Kong youths made an expensive trip to Paris to meet with the exiled Chinese Trotskyists. Few of the returnees such as John Shum and Ng Chung-yin left the Seventies Biweekly dominated by anarchists, and established a Trotskyist youth group called Revolutionary International League. It later took the name Socialist League and changed its name into Revolutionary Marxist League in 1975.\nThe league published periodicals such as Combat Bulletin and aligned themselves with the International Majority Tendency of the United Secretariat. In 1975 it became the Chinese section of the Fourth International, together with another long-existing Trotskyist group the Revolutionary Communist Party.\nThe well-known Legislative Council member since 2004, \"Longhair\" Leung Kwok-hung was an active member of the league. After the league was disbanded in 1991, he became active member of another socialist group called April Fifth Action.\nSee also\n* April Fifth Action\n* League of Social Democrats\nReferences"
