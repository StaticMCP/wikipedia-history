      "text": "# 2018 Nepalese presidential election\n\nThe third presidential election of Nepal was held on 13 March 2018. As a new election law was developed (which is foreseen by the Constitution of Nepal) and as, due to the Nepalese election in 2017, an electoral college could be established, the election took place three years after the previous presidential elections despite the presidential term of office actually being set at 5 years. The President was elected by an electoral college composed of the members of federal parliament and provincial assemblies. The total number of voters was thus 880, however the 331 members of Federal Parliament have a vote weight of 79, while the 549 members of Provincial Assemblies have a vote weight of 48. In total 862 lawmakers participated in the election leading to a turnout of 97.95%.\nElectoral college\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | align=\"center\"\n|-\n!Party\n!Pratinidhi Sabha votes\n!Rastriya Sabha votes\n!Pradesh Sabha votes\n!Total votes\n!Percentage\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|CPN (Unified Marxist-Leninist)\n|9,559\n|2,133\n|11,664\n|23,356\n|44.43%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Nepali Congress\n|4,997\n|1,027\n|5,424\n|11,448\n|21.78%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|CPN (Maoist Centre)\n|4,187\n|948\n|5,184\n|10,319\n|19.63%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal\n|1,264\n|158\n|1,776\n|3,198\n|6.08%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Rastriya Janata Party Nepal\n|1,343\n|158\n|1,344\n|2,845\n|5.41%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Rastriya Janamorcha\n|79\n|0\n|192\n|271\n|0.52%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Rastriya Prajatantra Party\n|79\n|0\n|144\n|223\n|0.42%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Naya Shakti Party, Nepal\n|79\n|0\n|144\n|223\n|0.42%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Nepal Mazdoor Kisan Party\n|79\n|0\n|96\n|175\n|0.33%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Bibeksheel Sajha Party\n|0\n|0\n|144\n|144\n|0.27%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Sanghiya Loktantrik Rastriya Manch\n|0\n|0\n|48\n|48\n|0.09%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Democratic)\n|0\n|0\n|48\n|48\n|0.09%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Nepal Federal Socialist Party\n|0\n|0\n|48\n|48\n|0.09%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Independents\n|79\n|0\n|144\n|223\n|0.42%\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Total\n!21,745\n!4,424\n!26,400\n!52,569\n!100%\n|}\nCandidates\nCommunist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Name\n!Born\n!Current or previous positions\n!Province\n!Announced\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Ref\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Kovind\" |\nBidya Devi Bhandari\n|Bhojpur, Province No. 1\n| data-sort-value=\"Governor\" |Member of the Legislature Parliament of Nepal (2013–2015)\nMinister of Defence (2009–2011)\nMinister of Population and Environment (1997)\nMember of the House of Representatives from Kathmandu 2 (1994–2002)\nMember of the House of Representatives from Kathmandu 1 (1993–1994)\n|Province No. 1\n|7 March 2018\n|\n|}\nNepali Congress\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Name\n!Born\n!Current or previous positions\n!Province\n!Announced\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Ref\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Kumar\" |Kumari Laxmi Rai\n|Bhojpur, Province No. 1\n| data-sort-value=\"Speaker\" |Member of the Legislature Parliament of Nepal (2013–2018)\n|Province No. 1\n|7 March 2018\n|\n|}\nResults\nBhandari's election was supported by her own party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and coalition partner Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) as well as Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal, Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, Rastriya Janamorcha and Rastriya Prajatantra Party.\nBidhya Devi Bhandari received 245 votes of federal members, and 415 from provincial ones, resulting in 39,275 weighted votes.
