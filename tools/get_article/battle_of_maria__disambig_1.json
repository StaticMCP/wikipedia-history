Though the Spanish right wing was crushed, the rest of Blake's army got away in fairly good order after abandoning most of its artillery. María de Huerva is located  southwest of Zaragoza, Spain. The action occurred during the Peninsular War which was part of the larger struggle known as the Napoleonic Wars.\nAftermath\nThe Spanish campaign in early 1809 proceeded with the French advance in Catalonia in the Battle of Belchite.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
