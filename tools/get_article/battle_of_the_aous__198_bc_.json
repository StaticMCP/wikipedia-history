The Roman forces were led by Titus Quinctius Flamininus and the Macedonian ones were led by Philip V.\nThe Macedonian army encamped behind a pass in an unassailable position. A local shepherd guided the Romans to a secret path that took them behind the Macedonian position. Flaminius led his troops through this secret path and attacked the Macedonians from the rear, rendering their position untenable and inflicting some 2,000 casualties. Philip's army retreated with the survivors, and the two commanders would meet again at Cynoscephalae the following year, where the Romans would triumph again and end the war.\nReferences"
