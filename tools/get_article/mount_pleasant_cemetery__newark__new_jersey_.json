It occupies approximately 40 acres (162,000 m2) and was designed by Horace Baldwin.\nThe cemetery is listed on both the New Jersey Register (ID #1284, since 1987) and the National Register of Historic Places (Reference #87000836, since 1988).\nThe graves of some of Newark's most eminent citizens are within Mount Pleasant Cemetery.  The cemetery is dominated by the marble mausoleum of John Fairfield Dryden, the founder of Prudential Financial.
