The Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales and Scottish Environment Protection Agency all undertake location specific flood warning activities for communities at risk depending upon the scale of flood risk, technical challenges and investment needed to deliver a reliable service.\nPrior to issuing a flood warning consideration is given to:\n* the needs of communities to activate emergency response plans\n* the nature of the catchment or coastline and the lead time that may be provided\n* meteorological observations and forecast information on rainfall and coastal water levels\n* hydrological observations and flood forecasts\n* reference to thresholds of historic or forecast flood levels\nDissemination of flood warnings has moved towards a service whereby those at risk can pre-register to receive warnings by phone, email or text message from an automatic system, Floodline. Both warnings and updates about current conditions are also carried by local radio stations. In addition, live updates are carried by the Environment Agency's website, showing which locations have flood warnings in place and the severity of these warnings.\nThere is currently no flood warning system in Northern Ireland, but the Met Office does issue weather warnings. Flood risk management is the responsibility of Rivers Agency in Northern Ireland. Consideration will be given to the introduction of a warning system as part of the implementation of the EU Floods directive.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, a flash flood watch is issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) when weather conditions are favorable for very heavy rain that could cause flooding or flash flooding. A watch does not mean that flooding is occurring, only that weather conditions have created or will create a significant risk for it. If flooding occurs, a flood warning or flash flood warning would be issued, and immediate action should be taken. A flood warning or flash flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or already occurring. When flood warnings are issued, it means that area waterways will likely soon be in flood. Not all flood watches suggest that large-scale flooding, such as during landfalling tropical cyclones, is possible.\nIn the United States, the National Weather Service issues flood watches and warnings for large-scale, gradual river flooding. Watches are issued when flooding is possible or expected within 12–48 hours, and warnings are issued when flooding over a large area or river flooding is imminent or occurring. Both can be issued on a county-by-county basis or for specific rivers or points along a river. When rapid flooding from heavy rain or a dam failure is expected, flash flood watches and warnings are issued.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, dissemination of flood warnings is covered by Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) code FLW, which is used by the U.S. Emergency Alert System and NOAA Weather Radio network and in Canada's Weatheradio Canada network.\n\"Flood statements\" are issued by the National Weather Service to inform the public of flooding along major streams in which there is not a serious threat to life or property. They may also follow a flood warning to give later information.\nExample of a flood warning\nThe following is an example of a \"Flood Warning.\" The Sabine River is used as an example:\n394\nWGUS44 KSHV 070219 RRA\nFLWSHV\nBULLETIN - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED\nFlood Warning\nNational Weather Service Shreveport LA\n819 PM CST Wed Jan 6 2021\n...The National Weather Service in Shreveport LA has issued a Flood\nWarning for the following rivers in Texas...\nSabine River Near Hawkins affecting Wood, Smith and Upshur\nCounties.\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\nDo not drive cars through flooded areas.\nCaution is urged when walking near riverbanks.\nA Flood Warning means that flooding is imminent or occurring.

It includes more than 200 real-time stream stage sensors that feed data into the Iowa Flood Information System where data can be viewed, online, by disaster management staff and the general public. The stream stage sensors, mounted on bridges and culverts, use ultrasonic sensors to monitor stream and river levels. The Iowa Flood Information System is considered \"one of the best in the country\", according to the Washington Post.\nAustralia\ncouncil advising people of a flood watch warning.]]\nIn Australia, flood warnings are handled by the Bureau Of Meteorology as well as local councils. The method of distributing the warning can vary but is usually transmitted by radio, social media and dedicated apps.\nIn other countries\nIn Canada, a heavy rainfall warning, which indicates rainfall amounts that could produce flooding are expected, has basically the same meaning as a flood watch.\nIn Europe, there is the European Flood Awareness System and the commercial product including app and data services [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jacobs.floodalert&pli=1 FloodAlert].\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.riversagencyni.gov.uk/ Flood Risk Management in Northern Ireland]  at riversagencyni.gov.uk"
