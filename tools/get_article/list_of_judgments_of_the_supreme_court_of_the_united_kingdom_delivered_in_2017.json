Judges are treated as having concurred in another's judgment when they either formally attach themselves to the judgment of another or speak only to acknowledge their concurrence with one or more judges. Any judgment which reaches a conclusion which differs from the majority on one or more major points of the appeal has been treated as dissent.\nAll dates are for 2017 unless expressly stated otherwise.\n2017 case summaries\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=center\n!width=1200px| Case name\n!width=420px| Citation\n!width=200px| Date\n!width=250px| Legal subject\n!width=1200px| Summary of decision\n|-\n| Rahmatullah (No 2) v Ministry of Defence\n| [2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/1.html UKSC 1]\n| 17 January\n| Crown Proceedings Act 1947\n|\n|-\n| Abd Ali Hameed Al-Waheed v Ministry of Defence\n| [2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/2.html UKSC 2]\n| 17 January\n| Constitutional law\n| Detention\n|-\n| Belhaj v Straw\n| [2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/3.html UKSC 3]\n| 17 January\n| International law\n| Act of state doctrine\n|-\n| FirstGroup Plc v Paulley\n| [2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/4.html UKSC 4]\n| 18 January\n| Discrimination law\n| A bus company's duty to provide wheelchair space under the Equality Act 2010.\n|-\n| R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union\n| [2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html UKSC 5]\n| 24 January\n| Constitutional law\n| An Act of Parliament, not the Royal Prerogative, was required to send notification under TEU article 50 to negotiate leaving the EU because this would withdraw rights under Acts of Parliament.
