Three attended the University of Edinburgh, three the University of Glasgow,  two Mason Science College, a predecessor institution of the University of Birmingham, and one &ndash; the incumbent prime minister Keir Starmer &ndash; the University of Leeds. John Major was (as of ) the last of the eight living prime ministers who did not attend university after leaving secondary education. A number of the prime ministers who attended university never graduated. Oxford gained its 29th prime-ministerial alumnus when Liz Truss  succeeded Boris Johnson in September 2022, and its 30th &ndash; and fifth consecutive &ndash; a month later in Rishi Sunak. Starmer followed his undergraduate degree at Leeds with a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree at Oxford.\nTwenty prime ministers were schooled at Eton College, of whom nine were educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, including all three who held office between 1880 and 1902 (Gladstone, Salisbury, Rosebery). Seven were educated at Harrow School and six at Westminster School. Rishi Sunak was the second to be educated at Winchester College. Eleven prime ministers to date have been educated at only non-fee-paying schools; these include all five who held office between 1964 and 1997 (Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher, Major). Theresa May was educated at both independent and grammar schools. Three did not receive (primary or secondary) school education and were homeschooled during childhood.\nSixteen Prime ministers trained as barristers at the Inns of Court, including 12 at Lincoln's Inn (although not all were called to the bar). Two (Wellington and Churchill) completed officer training at military academies.\nAlthough William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath (in 1746) and James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave (in 1757) briefly attempted to form governments, neither is usually counted as prime minister. They are not listed below.\nFile:JohnStuartBute.jpg|The Earl of Bute (Groningen & Leiden): the first prime minister to graduate from a university outside the UK\nFile:William Pitt the Younger 2 cropped.jpg|William Pitt the Younger (Pembroke, Cambridge): home schooled; went to Cambridge aged 14, graduated at 17, MP at 21, prime minister at 24.
