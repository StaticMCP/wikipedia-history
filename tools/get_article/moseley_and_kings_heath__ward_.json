The Committee comprises the two elected Ward Councillors for the area together with the Member of Parliament for the Hall Green, Moseley and King's Heath, Sparkbrook, and Springfield  constituency, Roger Godsiff, of which the ward is part. However, meetings are well attended with all of those in attendance not only debating the issues of concern to them but voting on policy.\nThe Ward Committee works with The Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Advisory Board – a grouping of representatives from local groups and organisations – as a kind of executive for the full Ward Committee.\nMoseley and Kings Heath Ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer with the current holder of the title being Muna Masood.\nDemographics\nThe 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 24,273 people living in the ward. 31.0% (7,520) are of an ethnic minority compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. White Irish are excluded from these figures, however.\nTransport\nThe Alcester Road (A435) passes through the ward and is major route linking the city centre with Redditch and the M40. The A445 and A4040 (Outer Ring Road) are also major roads in the area. Bus routes serving the area are the Number 1, Number 11, Number 35 and Number 50, operated by National Express West Midlands.\nThe Camp Hill railway line passes through the area however there are no railway stations on it. The area was served by Moseley railway station (opened 1867) and Kings Heath railway station (opened 1840), which were located on the line, however, these were both closed in 1941 along with the other stations on the line.\nA reopening of the line has been considered by Birmingham City Council. A feasibility study has concluded that there is a strong economic case for reopening stations at Moseley, Kings Heath and in Hazelwell/ Stirchley. There was a recommendation against opening a railway station at Balsall Heath as it is close to the city centre, however, the report only looked at potential journeys from Balsall Heath going to the city centre and did not take into account people who want to travel to Balsall Heath from districts around the city.\nPlaces of interest\nThe ward covers two conservation areas; Moseley Village and St Agnes. These two areas include many larger residential properties reflecting the affluence of the areas. Other areas in the ward are disadvantaged though.\nThere are several open spaces within the ward including Cannon Hill Park in Moseley, Kings Heath Park and the private Moseley Park. Within Cannon Hill Park is mac (Midlands Art Centre) which is a non-profits art centre. Other places of interest include Moseley Golf Course and the gardens of Highbury Hall.\nKings Heath and Moseley Village serve as shopping centres for the ward. Kings Heath Library serves the area and hosts a monthly local history group.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/moseleykingsheath Birmingham City Council: Moseley and Kings Heath Ward]\nWard Description\nThe ward covers an area of {} Birmingham, including the districts of {}.\nWard Demographics (from the census of 2001)\nWard history\nThe ward was created in {}, with the boundaries being unaltered until {}.\nParliamentary Representation\nThe ward has been part of Birmingham {} constituency.\nPolitics\nElection results\n2000s\n1990s\n1980s\n1970s\n1960s\n1950s\n1940s"
