His father was Owen Owens, tenant of the farm, and his wife Mary Jones, who had two more sons, and three daughters.\nEdward Owen left for Patagonia on 20 April 1874 from Liverpool, on the Hipparchus ship along with other 49 Welsh passengers originating from different parts of Wales, including Aberdare, Cardigan, Ruthin and Ffestiniog. Arriving in Chubut in Patagonia, as most immigrant farmers, they were transferred 100 hectares of land in the area of Drofa Dulog in the lower Chubut River valley between the villages of Gaiman and Trelew.\nSee also\n* Y Wladfa\nReferences"
