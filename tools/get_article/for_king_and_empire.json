War breaks out, and Australia responds to the call; in fact some of her fighters have already returned from the fight. Among the returned heroes is Captain Gerald Berkley, who is in love with Sylvia, but Berkely has a rival in the form of Lieutenant Sydney Bolton, also an enemy in Sidney's cousin, Graham. Sydney Bolton endeavors to secure Sylvia's hand and fortune in order to redeem his own financial position. He forces a quarrel on Berkely, but gets the worst of it. Sylvia is decoyed to Bolton's home, and while there witnesses a murder of which her lover is later accused. Her evidence saves him, but Graham Bolton, knowing that Gerald is again ordered to the front, seeks to prove the charge. Complications, tragedy, and sensation follow, but the supposed murder is finally cleared up, and the play concludes with the prospect of peace and happiness.\"\nReferences"
