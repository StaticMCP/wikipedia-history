It is part of the D Line Extension project, in Los Angeles, California. Construction started in 2018 as part of Section 2 of the extension project. It is slated to open in Spring 2027.\nThe station was known as Century City/Constellation station during planning and early construction. From late 2022 to early 2023, Metro conducted six months of public outreach and engagement with local stakeholders, the general public, and Metro riders to determine the best name for the station. Most participants preferred the shortened name \"Century City\" over \"Century City/Constellation.\" This data, combined with the shortened name aligning with Metro's Property Naming Policy, led Metro staff to suggest to its board of directors that they adopt the shortened name for the station, which was approved at the July 18, 2024, board meeting.\nThe station will include public art with works by Eddie Rodolfo Aparicio, Sarah Cain, Phùng Huynh, Oscar \"Nimexica\" Magallanes, and Analia Saban.\nCentury City Center is currently under construction above the station.\nAttractions\n* Westfield Century City\n* One Tower\n* Constellation Place (formerly the MGM Tower) – Headquarters of Houlihan Lokey, ICM Partners, and International Lease Finance Corporation.\n* John Paul Mitchell Systems headquarters\n* Century Plaza Towers\n* Century City Center\n* Fairmont Century Plaza\n* Fox Plaza Tower\n* Fox Broadcasting Studios\n* 20th Century Studios\n* Beverly Hills High School\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.metro.net/projects/westside/ Transit Agency Information]"
