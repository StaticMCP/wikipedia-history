It is a suburb of Tallaght, the county town of South Dublin\nLocation\nThe area is bordered by the M50 motorway to the NE; the Belgard Road to the SW; N7 to the NW; Katherine Tynan Road to the SE. The latter is named for writer Katherine Tynan (1859–1931), who lived in the area. Historically a part of the hinterland of Clondalkin village yet lying inside the Parish of Tallaght, the Kingswood area is now divided by the Ballymount Road, with roughly two thirds in Dublin 24, and the remainder, west of the road, in Dublin 22, and therefore served by different garda stations.\nAmenities\nKingswood has a number of shops, a pub, a pharmacy, community centre, a church and two community centres. The community centres host several community groups, and the scout hall of the 158th Castleview Scout Group is nearby. The Catholic parish church is shared with Kilnamanagh.\nSchools in the area include St Kilian's Junior School (founded in 1979), and St Kilian's Senior School (founded in 1986). Kingswood Community College, also known as Coláiste Pobail Coill an Rí and opened in September 2016, is a secondary school which (as of 2019) had an enrollment of 524 pupils.\nTransport\ntram at Kingswood stop]]\nKingswood Luas stop is on the Luas Red Line, with services to Tallaght/Saggart and The Point/Connolly. Dublin Bus route 56a also serves Kingswood.\nSport\nThe local association football (soccer) club, Kingswood Castle FC, was founded in 2013. This club, which plays in black and green kits, uses Ballymount Park as a home pitch.\nSt Killians GAA Club merged with St. Kevins GAA Club in Kilnamanagh in 1998.\nReferences"
