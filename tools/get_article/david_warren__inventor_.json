He was born on a remote mission station on Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory, the first white child born on the island. He was educated at Launceston Church Grammar School and Trinity Grammar School, New South Wales. His father died in the crash of the de Havilland D.H.86 Miss Hobart over the Bass Strait in 1934.\nHe earned a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours from the University of Sydney, a PhD in fuels and energy from Imperial College London, a Diploma of Imperial College, and a Diploma of Education from the University of Melbourne.\nCareer\n;Summary\n*1944–46 – Teacher of mathematics and chemistry, Geelong Grammar School, Victoria.\n*1947–48 – Lecturer in chemistry, University of Sydney.\n*1948–51 – Scientific Officer, Woomera Rocket Range and Imperial College, London.\n*1952–83 – Principal Research Scientist, Aeronautical Research Laboratories, Melbourne, (now part of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation).\n*1981–82 – Scientific Adviser (Energy) to the Victorian State Parliament.\nFrom 1952 to 1983, David Warren served at what is now the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne ultimately attaining the role of principal research scientist. It was there, while investigating the 1953 crash of the world’s first commercial jet airliner — the Comet — that David conceived the idea of the cockpit voice recorder. The catalyst: a miniature voice recorder he saw at a trade show.\nAs he later reflected, “If a businessman had been using one of these in the plane and we could find it in the wreckage and play it back, we'd say, ‘We know what caused this.’” Captured audio—ambient sounds, spoken words, mechanical anomalies—could yield direct insight into a disaster’s origin.\nAt the time, devices existed to log certain flight parameters, but they were single-use, lacked voice capability, and were unsuitable for standard commercial operations. David’s innovation introduced magnetic tape, enabling continuous erasure and re-recording—a functional leap that made the device viable for routine aviation use. More crucially, his addition of cockpit audio extended the scope of black box data beyond instruments. In many cases, it was not the crew’s final words but incidental sounds—alarms, engine noise, even silence—that cracked the code of fatal crashes. David’s voice recorder didn’t just preserve memory—it changed the very grammar of accident investigation.\nCommittees, honours, awards and recognition\nWarren was the chair of the Combustion Institute (Aust & NZ Section) for 25 years (1958–83), the founding chair of the Morris Minor Car Club of Victoria (1977-2002), as well as committee member of the Chemical Society, the Institute of Fuel, and the Australian Institute of Energy.\nWarren received many awards and honours, including The Australian Institute of Energy Medal (1999), the Hartnett Medal of the Royal Society of the Arts (2000), the Centenary Medal (2001), the Lawrence Hargrave Award of the Royal Aeronautical Society (2001), Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) (2002), and the ICAO Edward Warner Award (2016).\nRecognition\nIn November 2008, Qantas named one of their Airbus A380s after Warren in honour of his services to aviation.\nWarren died on 19 July 2010, aged 85, in Melbourne. He was buried in a casket bearing the label \"Flight Recorder Inventor; Do Not Open\" (a play off of the \"FLIGHT RECORDER DO NOT OPEN\" label on his recorders).\nIn June 2012, the ACT Government named a road, David Warren Road, in the suburb of Hume.\nDavid Warren was inducted into the Australian Aviation Hall of Fame on 16 November 2013.\nOn 25 March 2014, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation renamed their Canberra headquarters the \"David Warren Building\".\nOn 20 March 2021, Google showed a Doodle on its home page in some countries for David Warren's 96th birthday.\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n*[http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/page/3384/ Biography at Defence Science and Technology Organisation]\n*[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-49012771 This little-known inventor has probably saved your life.
