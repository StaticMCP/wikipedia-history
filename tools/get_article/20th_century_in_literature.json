After 1960, the somewhat malleable term \"contemporary literature\" widely appears.\nAlthough these terms (modern, contemporary and postmodern) are generally applicable to and stem from Western literary history, scholars often use them in reference to Asian, Latin American and African literatures. Non-western writers, in particular in Postcolonial literature, have been at the forefront of literary evolution during the twentieth century.\nTechnological advances facilitated lower production cost for books, coupled with rising populations and literacy rates, which resulted in a significant rise in production of popular literature and trivial literature, comparable to the similar developments in music. The division of \"popular literature\" and \"high literature\" in the 20th century is overlapped by genres such as detectives or science fiction, despite being largely ignored by mainstream literary criticism for most of the century. These genres developed their own establishments and critical awards; these include the Nebula Award (since 1965), the British Fantasy Award (since 1971) or the Mythopoeic Awards (since 1971).\nTowards the end of the 20th century, electronic literature grew in importance in light of the development of hypertext and later the World Wide Web.\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded annually throughout the century (with the exception of 1914, 1918, 1935 and 1940–1943), the first laureate (1901) being Sully Prudhomme. The New York Times Best Seller list has been published since 1942.\nThe best-selling literary works of the 20th century are estimated to be The Lord of the Rings (1954/55, 150 million copies), Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince, 1943, 140 million copies), ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997, 120 million copies) and And Then There Were None (1939, 115 million copies).\nThe Lord of the Rings was also voted \"book of the century\" in various surveys.\nPerry Rhodan (1961 to present) proclaimed as the best-selling book series, with an estimated total of 1 billion copies sold.\n1901–1918\nThe Fin de siècle movement of the Belle Époque'' persisted into the 20th century, but was brutally cut short with the outbreak of World War I (an effect depicted e.g. in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, published 1924). The Dada movement of 1916–1920 was at least in part a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war; the movement heralded the Surrealism movement of the 1920s.\n1900\n* Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad (Poland, England)\n* The Knights of the Cross by Henryk Sienkiewicz (Poland)\nGenre fiction\n* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L.
