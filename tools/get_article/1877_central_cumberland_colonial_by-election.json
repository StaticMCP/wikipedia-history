Long was appointed Colonial Treasurer, and Lackey was appointed Minister of Justice and Public Instruction. Such ministerial by-elections were usually uncontested however on this occasion, only Thomas Garrett (Camden) and Ezekiel Baker (Goldfields South) were unopposed. While the other ministers, John Robertson (West Sydney), John Davies (East Sydney) and Edward Combes (Orange) were opposed, all were re-elected.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!
