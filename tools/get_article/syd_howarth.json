He is probably best remembered for his two spells in non-League football with Merthyr Tyrdfil.\nClub career\nA centre forward and occasional left half, Tucker began his career with Welsh lower league clubs Barry Town and Aberaman Athletic. He came to prominence as part of Merthyr Tydfil's 1947–48 Southern League-winning squad and transferred to First Division club Aston Villa for a £6500 fee in June 1948. He appeared sparingly in League football for Aston Villa, Swansea Town and Walsall, before returning to Merthyr Tydfil in 1953, with whom he won a second Southern League championship. Tucker was posthumously inducted into the club's Hall of Fame in 2012.\nInternational career\nHowarth was picked to represent Wales, but was prevented from being capped by his father, as he had been born in Bristol, England.\nPersonal life\nTucker was the son of professional footballer Tommy Howarth and was born in Bristol, England. He moved to Newport, Wales with his family 10 after his birth. He joined the Royal Air Force at age 17 served in South Africa, Malta and Palestine during the Second World War. He died in November 2004, after being admitted for treatment on a leg ulcer at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Aston Villa\n|1948–49\n|First Division\n|7\n|2\n|1\n|0\n|8\n|2\n|-\n|1949–50\n|First Division\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!8\n!2\n!1\n!0\n!9\n!2\n|}\nHonours\nMerthyr Tydfil\n* Southern League: 1947–48, 1953–54\nIndividual\n* Merthyr Town Hall of Fame\nReferences"
