The battle started when Minamoto no Yukiie attempted a sneak attack across the Sunomata River against his enemies during the night. He found Taira no Tomomori and his army directly opposite his, along the Sunomata River, near the borders of Owari and Mino provinces.\nThe Minamoto warriors waded across, but their ambush failed when the Taira clan could distinguish dry friend from soaking, dripping wet foe, even in the pitch dark of night. Yukiie and a number of other surviving Minamoto were forced back across the river.\nAfter crossing the river, the Minamoto went to the Yahagi River in Mikawa Province, but the Taira chased after them.\nSee also\n*List of Japanese battles\nReferences"
