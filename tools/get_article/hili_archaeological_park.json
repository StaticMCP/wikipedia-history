Other remains include settlements, tombs, and a falaj dating from the Iron Age. Some of the site is located outside the park in a protected area. Finds from the site can be seen in the Al Ain National Museum in central Al Ain. The Hili Grand Tomb is a tower measuring  in diameter that has been reconstructed. The tombs belong to the Umm al-Nar culture.\nIn May 2019 the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism reported that fingerprints about 3000 years old were found at Hili II. They apparently belonged to craftsmen who constructed a wall at the site.\nSee also\n* Al Ain Oasis\n* Tawam (region)\n** Al-Buraimi\n* Archaeological Sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn\n* Hafit period\n* Ibri\n* List of Ancient Settlements in the UAE\n* Qattara Oasis\n* Rumailah, UAE\nReferences"
