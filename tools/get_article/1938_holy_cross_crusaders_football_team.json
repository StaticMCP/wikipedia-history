The Crusaders were led by sixth-year head coach Eddie Anderson and played their home games at Fitton Field in Worcester, Massachusetts. Holy Cross's sole loss on the year came on a road trip to Carnegie Tech, where a missed extra point by the Crusaders prevented the tie. They finished ninth in the final AP poll, the best finish in the Crusaders' history.\nSchedule\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Fitton Field\n| site_cityst = Worcester, MA\n| score = 46–13\n}}\n|\n|\n| }}\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\nReferences"
