Cruz (Philippines), Rashika El Ridi (Egypt), Ms Irina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO, and Günter Blobel, Nobel Prize in Medicine 1999.]]\nThe '''L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science International Awards''', created in 1998, aim to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress. The awards are a result of a partnership between the Foundation of the French company L'Oréal and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and carry a grant of $100,000 USD for each laureate. This award is also known as the L'Oréal-UNESCO Women in Science Awards.\nEach year an international jury awards five laureates, selecting one from each of the following regions:\n* Africa and the Arab States.\n* Asia and the Pacific\n* Europe\n* Latin America and the Caribbean\n* North America (since 2000)\nEligibility requirements alternate every other year based on scientific discipline with laureates in life sciences recognized in even years and laureates in physical sciences, mathematics and computer science recognized in odd years (since 2003).\nThe same partnership awards the '''UNESCO-L'Oréal International Fellowships', providing up to $40,000 USD in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects. The Fellowship awards began in 2000 with a one-year award of US$20,000 and offered ten awards until 2003. In 2003, the number of awards increased to 15 and then in 2006, the grant period extended to two years and the amount of the award increased to US$40,000. In 2015, the name Rising Talent Grants'' was implemented.\nAs of 2023, 7 L'Oréal-UNESCO laureates have won also a Nobel Prize, these are: Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard in Physiology or Medicine (1995 - unlike the others, she had won the Nobel Prize before receiving this International Award), Elizabeth Blackburn in Physiology or Medicine (2008), Ada Yonath in Chemistry (2009), Emmanuelle Charpentier in Chemistry (2020), Jennifer Doudna in Chemistry (2020), Katalin Karikó in Physiology or Medicine (2023) and Anne L'Huillier in Physics (2023).\nRecipients\nwas the 2016 Laureate for Africa and the Arab States]]\nLegend:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |Year\n!Laureate for\n!Name\n!Nationality\n!scope = col class = unsortable | Credentials\n!scope = col class = unsortable | Recognized for (her)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |1998\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #C8E6C9;\" |LS\n|Africa and the Arab States\n|Grace Oladunni Taylor\n|\n|Biochemist, scholar, university professor.\n|contributions to epidemiology cardio vascular disease in Africa\n|-\n|Asia and the Pacific\n|Myeong-Hee Yu\n|\n|Researcher and professor on micro Biological Sciences at Korean Institute of Science and Technology.\n|discoveries of protein folding and its relationship to human pathology\n|-\n|Europe\n|Pascale Cossart\n|\n|Professor at Bacteria-Cell interaction Unit, Institut Pasteur\n|elucidation of the mechanisms whereby pathogenic bacteria subvert immune defenses\n|-\n|Latin America and the Caribbean\n|Gloria Montenegro\n|\n|Professor of botany at the Faculty of Agronomy and Forestry Sciences Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile\n|efforts to apply modern science to the protection of plant ecosystems\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2000\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"background-color: #C8E6C9;\" |LS\n|Africa and the Arab States\n|Valerie Mizrahi\n|\n|Researching at Molecular Mycobacteriology Research Unit, National Health Sciences Laboratory Service and University of the Witwatersrand\n|contributions to the fight against tuberculosis and other infectious diseases\n|-\n|Asia and the Pacific\n|Tsuneko Okazaki\n|\n|Professor of Molecular Biological Sciences at the Institute of Comprehensive Medical Science, Fujita Health Sciences University\n|discovery of the molecular mechanism of retrograde DNA replication\n|-\n|Europe\n|Margarita Salas\n|\n|\n|fundamental contributions to our understanding of DNA replication\n|-\n|Latin America and the Caribbean\n|Eugenia María del Pino Veintimilla\n|\n|Professor of developmental Biological Sciences at Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador\n|original investigations on the Biology of marsupial tree frogs and her efforts on behalf of conservation in the Galapagos Islands.\n|-\n| rowspan=2 |North America\n|Joanne Chory\n| rowspan=2 |\n|Professor and Director Plant Molecular and Cellular Biological Sciences Laboratory Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator\n|elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the response of plant organisms to light\n|-\n|Thressa Campbell Stadtman\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |2001\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"background-color: #C8E6C9;\" |LS\n| Africa and the Arab States\n|Adeyinka Gladys Falusi\n|\n|Professor of haematology at Institute for Medical Research & Training of the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan\n|molecular-genetic identification and classification of hereditary blood diseases in Africa\n|-\n|Asia and the Pacific\n|Suzanne Cory\n|\n|Professor at The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research\n|contributions to our understanding of the genetic basis of human lymphoma and other cancerous conditions\n|-\n|Europe\n|Anne McLaren\n|\n|\n|discoveries in reproductive Biology, which have paved the way to human assisted reproduction\n|-\n|Latin America and the Caribbean\n|Mayana Zatz\n|\n|Professor of genetics University of São Paulo\n|contributions to the pathology, diagnosis and management of hereditary\n|-\n|North America\n|Joan Steitz\n|\n|Professor of molecular Biological Sciences at Yale University\n|discoveries of the structure, biological functions and pathological implications of small RNA molecules\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2002\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"background-color: #C8E6C9;\" |LS\n|Africa and the Arab States\n|Nagwa Meguid\n|\n|Researcher at the National Research Centre, Cairo\n|systematic genetic investigations of Down syndrome and other neurological conditions in the Mediterranean region\n|-\n|Asia and the Pacific\n|Indira Nath\n|\n|Professor at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi - Former Founder Head of Department of Biotechnology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences\n|fundamental contributions to the pathogeny, prevention and treatment of leprosy\n|-\n| rowspan=2 |Europe\n|Mary Osborn\n|\n|International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biological Sciences (IUBMB).
