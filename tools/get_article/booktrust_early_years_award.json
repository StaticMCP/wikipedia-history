It was administered by Booktrust, an independent charity that promotes books and reading; from 1999 to 2004. The Booktrust Early Years Awards was sponsored by the supermarket chain Sainsbury's with its last award give in 2010.\nAs of 2005 there were three categories: the Baby Book Award, the Pre-School Award, and the Best Emerging Illustrator Award. The winners in each category received £2000 with the Emerging Illustrator also receiving a specially commissioned award. The publishers of the winning books were given awards too.\nHonorees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Booktrust Early Years Award winners and shortlists\n!Year\n!Category\n!Author/Illustrator\n!Title\n!Publisher\n!Result\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |1999\n! rowspan=\"6\" |N/A\n|\n|Tickle, Tickle\n|Walker Books\n|Winner\n|-\n|\n|Woof!\n|Macmillan Children's Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Humpty Dumpty and Other Nursery Rhymes\n|Macmillan Children's Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Anthea Sieveking\n|Find My Cake!\n|Frances Lincoln\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Peek-a-Boo!\n|Dutton Children's Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|\n|Macmillan Children's Books\n|Shortlist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!2000\n!N/A\n|\n|Boo Barney\n|Orchard Books\n|Winner\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2001\n! rowspan=\"6\" |N/A\n|\n|Baby Faces\n|Baby Campbell\n|Winner\n|-\n|\n|Where, Oh Where, is Baby Bear?\n|Little Orchard\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|''If You're Happy and You Know It...''\n|Child's Play\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|''Baby's Very First Book: Farm\n|Baby Campbell\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Kate Merritt\n|Peekaboo Baby!\n|Ladybird\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Sleepyhead\n|Baby Campbell\n|Shortlist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!2002\n!N/A\n|\n|Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes''\n|Child's Play\n|Winner\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2003\n! rowspan=\"6\" |N/A\n|\n|Happy Dog, Sad Dog\n|Little Tiger Press\n|Winner\n|-\n|\n|Goodnight, Poppy Cat\n|Campbell Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Baby Activity Centre\n|Priddy Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Baby Fun: Five in the Bed\n|Dorling Kindersley\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Rachel Wells\n|''That's Not My Bear\n|Usborne Publishing\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Fiona Macmillan\n|Baby Boo!\n|Templar\n|Shortlist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2004\n!Baby Book\n| and Mike Jolley\n|I Love You!\n|Templar\n|Winner\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!New Illustrator\n|\n|Polly and the North Star''\n|Orion\n|Winner\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!Pre-School\n|, illus. by Axel Scheffler\n|\n|Macmillan Children's Books\n|Winner\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"16\" |2005\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Baby Book\n|\n|''Poppy Cat's Farm\n|Campbell Books\n|Winner\n|-\n|\n|Can You Cuddle Like a Koala?\n|Little Orchard\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Not So Loud, Oliver!\n|Little Orchard\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Look at Me!\n|Chrysalis Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|No Bed Without Ted\n|Bloomsbury\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Bathtime Peekaboo!\n|Dorling Kindersley\n|Shortlist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" |New Illustrator\n|\n|\n|Little Tiger Press\n|Winner\n|-\n|, written by Alec Sillifant\n|Little Green Monsters\n|Meadowside\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|, written by Rachel Elliot\n|Eric the Liontamer\n|Meadowside\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Russell the Sheep''\n|HarperCollins Children's\n|Shortlist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Pre-School\n|\n|The Very Dizzy Dinosaur\n|Little Tiger Press\n|Winner\n|-\n|\n|''Duck's Key Where Can it be?''\n|HarperCollins Children's\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Pond Goose\n|Oxford University Press\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|My Friend Gorilla\n|Mathew Price Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Lindsey Gardiner\n|Doing the Animal Bop\n|Oxford University Press\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Chris Fisher\n|\n|Oxford University Press\n|Shortlist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"22\" |2006\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Baby Book\n|\n|How Do You Feel?\n|HarperCollins Children's\n|Winner\n|-\n| and Kate Merritt\n|Night, Night, Baby\n|Ladybird\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Paul Howard\n|Look at You!\n|Walker Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Peek-a-Boo!\n|Child’s Play\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|\n|Clackety-Clacks: Bee\n|Campbell Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n| and Catherine-Anne MacKinnon\n|Sleepy Baby\n|Usborne\n|Shortlist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" |Emerging Illustrator\n|\n|Augustus and His Smile\n|Little Tiger Press\n|Winner\n|-\n|\n|I Love My Mummy\n|Boxer Books\n|Shortlist\n|-\n|, written by Beth Shoshan\n|If Big Can...
