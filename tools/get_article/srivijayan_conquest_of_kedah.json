However, their position was influenced by Kedah and Melayu.  Srivijaya was a centre of Buddhism on Nusantara. Leaders planned to invade Kedah and conquer the Malay Peninsula.\nConquest\nIn 682 CE, Srivijayan fleets launched raids at Malacca strait. Many Kedahan and Malay ships were destroyed or suffered heavy damage. After raiding Malayan–Kedah fleets, they started to invade Kedah. Kedah was supported by many local parties but they could not counter the invasion. Srivijayan forces plundered the town of Kedah, capturing many weapons, and destroyed local parties' headquarters in Kedah. The King of Kedah decided to surrender as many of his forces suffered heavy casualties.\nAftermath\nThe conquest gained many territories and maintained many strategic ports. Srivijaya positions were strengthened and marked the rise of the Shailendra dynasty, unifying Medang Kingdom and Srivijaya. It also led to the great war against the Javanese kingdom of Mataram.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
