In 1989, the categories were revised and awards in these new categories conferred for the award year of 1988. It was also in this year that nominations for some categories were introduced for the very first time. Since 2016, the awards have been primarily focussed on home-grown output, with Fargo, the final winner of the International category in 2015. In 2023, the number of award categories stood at 30.\nControversies\nIn February 2017 broadcaster Piers Morgan pulled out as host after only three days, citing a public campaign branding him as damaging and inappropriate for the event.\nJudging\nThe RTS Programme Awards winners are selected not by public vote but decided via judging panels composed of industry experts and professionals. In 2016 the make up of the judging panels was adjusted to include more women and people from minority backgrounds. From approximately 200 jurors, 52% were now female and 27% from BAME backgrounds. The move towards more diversity came in the wake of the #OscarsSoWhite campaign. At the time of the 2020 awards, the overall jury composition was 56% female and 32% came from BAME backgrounds.\nWinners: 1998–present\n2025 winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Presented: 25 March 2025 – Host: Tom Allen\n! width=\"20%\" | Award\n! width=\"40%\" | Winners\n! width=\"40%\" | Nominees\n|-\n|Outstanding Achievement Award\n|Claudia Winkleman\n|–\n|-\n|Judges' Award\n|Ruth Jones and James Corden\n|–\n|-\n| Arts\n|My Sexual Abuse: The Sitcom (Channel 4)\n|\n* In My Own Words: Alison Lapper (BBC)\n* Camden (Disney+)\n|-\n| Breakthrough Award\n|Josh Tedeku – Boarders (BBC)\n|\n* Michelle de Swarte – Spent (BBC)\n* Bethany Asher – Sherwood (BBC)\n|-\n| Children's Programme\n|''Quentin Blake's Box of Treasures (BBC)\n|\n* Dodo (Sky Kids)\n* BMX All Stars (BBC)\n|-\n| Comedy Drama\n|Alma's Not Normal (BBC)\n|\n* Boarders (BBC)\n* Ludwig (BBC)\n|-\n| Comedy Entertainment\n|Junior Taskmaster (Channel 4)\n|\n* Have I Got News for You (BBC)\n* Sorry, I Didn't Know (ITV1)\n|-\n| Comedy Performance: Female\n|Sophie Willan – Alma's Not Normal (BBC)\n|\n* Aimee Lou Wood – Daddy Issues (BBC)\n* Michelle de Swarte – Spent (BBC)\n|-\n| Comedy Performance: Male\n|Oliver Savell – Changing Ends (ITV1)\n|\n* Jim Howick – Here We Go (BBC)\n* Nabhaan Rizwan – Kaos (Netflix)\n|-\n| Daytime Programme\n|Loose Women (ITV1)\n|\n* Clive Myrie's Caribbean Adventure (BBC)\n* BBC Breakfast (BBC)\n|-\n| Documentary Series\n|The Push: Murder on the Cliff (Channel 4)\n|\n* To Catch a Copper (Channel 4)\n* On Thin Ice: Putin v Greenpeace (BBC)\n|-\n| Drama Series\n|Industry (BBC and HBO)\n|\n* Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light (BBC and Masterpiece)\n* Supacell (Netflix)\n|-\n| Entertainment\n|The Traitors (BBC)\n|\n* Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway (ITV1)\n* RuPaul's Drag Race UK (BBC)\n|-\n| Entertainment Performance\n|Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway (ITV1)\n|\n* Steven Frayne – Miracles (Sky Max)\n* Claudia Winkleman – The Traitors (BBC)\n|-\n| Formatted Popular Factual\n|Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams on Tour (BBC)\n|\n* The Jury: Murder Trial (Channel 4)\n* The Martin Lewis Money Show Live (ITV1)\n|-\n| History\n|Atomic People (BBC)\n|\n* Miners' Strike 1984: The Battle for Britain (Channel 4)\n* Helmand: Tour of Duty (BBC)\n|-\n| Leading Actor: Female\n|Anna Maxwell Martin – Until I Kill You (ITV1)\n|\n* Ambika Mod – One Day (Netflix)\n* Monica Dolan – Mr Bates vs The Post Office (ITV1)\n|-\n| Leading Actor: Male\n|Lennie James – Mr Loverman (BBC)\n|\n* Adeel Akhtar – Showtrial (BBC)\n* Ben Whishaw – Black Doves (Netflix)\n|-\n| Limited Series and Single Drama\n|This Town (Netflix)\n|\n* Mr Bates vs The Post Office (ITV1)\n* Breathtaking (ITV1)\n|-\n| Live Event\n|D Day 80: Tribute to the Fallen (BBC)\n|\n* Coldplay at Glastonbury 2024 (BBC)\n* The Martin Lewis Money Show Live – Budget Special (ITV1)\n|-\n| Presenter\n|Liz Carr – Better Off Dead?
