The founder and first Editor-in-Chief was Professor Antoni Knot (1904-1982).\nUntil 2018, the journal was published by the Wrocław Society of History Enthusiasts [Wrocławskie Towarzystwo Miłośników Historii], which is the Wrocław chapter of the Polish Historical Society [Polskie Towarzystwo Historyczne].\nSince 2019, the journal is published and owned by the University of Wrocław. Current Editor-in-Chief (since 2024) is Tomasz Głowiński PhD, professor of the University of Wrocław.\nAims and scope\n„Śląski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sobótka” is a scientific journal, which is an important place for the presentation of scientific views, discussions, and exchange of ideas. The journal is a well-established and recognizable periodical in the scientific communities of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany.\nFrom the very beginning, the journal was closely dedicated to research on the history of Silesia and neighbouring regions. Importantly, the pages of the journal are also open to other topics, and the current Editorial Board wishes to maintain this tradition. Thus, The \"Ś.K.H. Sobótka” publishes materials relating to research on the history of Central and Eastern Europe, with particular emphasis on Silesia. In addition, each issue contains space for the so‑called universalia — studies and historical materials of a different nature, unrelated to the main scope. The journal publishes texts in the following languages: Polish, Czech, English and German.  All articles published in \"Ś.K.H. Sobótka\" are reviewed at least twice in accordance with the double blind principle.\nThe journal was awarded scientific merit points by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. It is also indexed in: Erih Plus, CEEOL, ICI Journals Master List, The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities (CEJSH), BazHum Science Library.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
