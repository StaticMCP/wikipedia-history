Initiated in 2004, the SESAR project is the technological arm of the EU's Single European Sky initiative to integrate EU Member States' ATM systems. Bringing together the EU, Eurocontrol, and more than 50 organisations covering the entire aviation value chain, including drones, this European partnership is investing more than EUR 1.6 billion between now and 2030 to accelerate, through research and innovation, the delivery of an inclusive, resilient and sustainable Digital European Sky.\nOverview\nAdvancing innovations applied today in the digital economy will result in a radical transformation of Europe’s aviation infrastructure, making air transport smarter, more sustainable, connected and accessible to all. Transforming the infrastructure that supports European aviation cannot be done by any one organisation or country. It requires close collaboration between all the stakeholders that contribute to it, from the European and national decision-makers that regulate it, the organisations and staff that operate it, to the academic and industry stakeholders that research, design and manufacture it. A public-private partnership that is strongly linked to policy and regulation through an institutional partnership offers the best means to coordinate all the stakeholders, pooling the critical mass of resources and expertise needed to deliver the Digital European Sky.\nThe SESAR 3 JU builds on the work and achievements of earlier SESAR research and innovation programmes (SESAR 1 and SESAR 2020), but seeks to accelerate the market uptake of innovative solutions through a portfolio of demonstrators and a fast-track mechanism. The partnership acts as a catalyst for speeding up the transition towards a green, climate neutral and digital Europe, and for making European industry more resilient and competitive.\nThe research programme of the SESAR JU is designed as an innovation pipeline, made up of exploratory research, industrial research and validation and Digital Sky Demonstrators, where ideas are transformed into tangible solutions. These are underpinned by an innovation and market uptake fast-track to get things moving! Calls related to the programme are launched within the framework of the EU’s Horizon Europe or Connecting Europe Facility funding programmes. These are open to private and public ‘for-profit’ and ‘not-for-profit’ organisations, including large enterprises and SMEs, research and technology organisations (RTOs), universities, associations, and any other type of legal entity interested in the SESAR 3 JU’s activities.\nLegal basis\nThe SESAR Joint 3 Undertaking, was created under Community law  on 21 November 2021.\nFunding and budget\nThe SESAR 3 JU is co-funded by the European Union through the Horizon Europe research and innovation programme and industry as follows:\n• Horizon Europe - EUR 600 million\n• Eurocontrol – up to EUR 500 million (in-kind and financial contributions)\n• Industry - EUR 500 million minimum (in-kind and financial contributions) In addition, the Digital European Sky programme will benefit from funding for its demonstrators from the Connecting Europe Facility (in coordination with European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency) to the value of at least EUR 200 million.\nMembers\n* Aeroporti di Roma\n* AENA\n* Paris Aéroport\n* Air France\n* Air Navigation Services Czech Republic (ANS CR)\n* Airbus SAS\n* Airtel ATN Limited\n* Alliance for New Mobility Europe (AME)\n* Athens International Airport\n* Austro Control\n* Brussels Airport Company\n* Boeing\n* BULATSA\n* Centro Italiano Ricerche Aerospaziali (C.I.R.A.)\n* Croatia Control\n* Deutsche Lufthansa\n* Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.
