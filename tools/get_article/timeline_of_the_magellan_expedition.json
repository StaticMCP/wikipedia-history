It was a Spanish expedition that sailed from Seville in 1519 under the initial command of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese sailor, and completed in 1522 by Spanish Basque navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano.\nThe initial goal of the voyage was to secure time to explore the possibility of a southwestern passage around South America to China and the Spice Islands (now part of Indonesia). After crossing the Atlantic, wintering in Patagonia, and suppressing a mutiny, the expedition found and transited the Straits of Magellan in 1520. After crossing the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines, Magellan was killed during a raid on the Mactan chief Lapulapu in 1521. The ship Victoria under Juan Sebastian Elcanowho began the expedition as a boatswain took command of the expedition and sailed into the open Indian Ocean, avoided landing in South Africa despite the resulting starvation, and bluffed his way into resupply at the Cape Verde Islands before completing the first circumnavigation on 6 September 1522. Of the initial 270 crew members, only 18  sailors completed the entire journey.\nTimeline\n1494\n* June 7: The Treaty of Tordesillas amends a series of earlier papal bulls to divide the newly discovered territories of the world between the Spanish and Portuguese Empires 370leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. Importantly, it provides for a Portuguese monopoly on trade around Africa but leaves open the possibility of Spanish exploration further west to the antimeridian of the division.\n1514\n* Magellan was intent on finding a route to the Spice Islands. Accused of unlawfully trading with the Moors, the Portuguese king denied Magellan permission to embark on Portuguese adventures\n1518\n* Magellan moves to Seville, the seat of the Casa de Contratación. He secures an audience with the new Habsburg king CharlesI (later emperor CharlesV of the Holy Roman Empire) and his mother and co-monarch Joanna at Aranjuez.\n* March 22: Charles issues the  approving the expedition under both Magellan and Ruy Faleiro, giving Magellan power of 'rope and knife' over the men and authority over newly discovered lands, and establishing a division of the profits upon its success. It is not expected at the time that the expedition would continue west into Portuguese territory to complete a circumnavigation. Magellan becomes a Spanish subject as part of the arrangement.\n1519\n* April 19: Charles issues the expedition's letters patent, repeating his previous grants, naming Magellan and Faleiro captains general, and directing them to seek spices in the Moluccas.\n* August 10:  Departure from Seville down the Guadalquivir River to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, where the ships underwent further repairs, preparation, and provisioning.\n* September 20: Departure from Sanlúcar de Barrameda.\n* September 26 October 3: Stopping in the Canary Islands to take in provisions.\n* November 29: Fleet reaches the vicinity of Cape St. Augustine.\n* December 13: Entering the bay of Rio de Janeiro.\n* December 27: Departure from Rio de Janeiro.\n1520\n* January 10: Cape Santa María.

Louis de Mendoza killed, followed by the execution of De Quesada and marooning of De Cartagena. Alvaro de Mesquita becomes the captain of the San Antonio and Duarte Barbosa of the Victoria.\n* End of April: Santiago is sent on a mission to find the passage. The ship is caught in a storm and wrecked. Survivors return to Puerto San Julián.

The ship arrives in Spain on May 21, 1521.\n* November 28: The fleet leaves the strait and enters the Pacific Ocean.\n** When out in the Pacific, some of the crew get scurvy.\n1521\n* January 24 or 2528: Landfall on an uninhabited island, which Magellan names St Paul's (probably Puka-Puka). They stay for a few days before continuing on.\n* March 6: Arrival at Guam and encounters with the Chamorro people.\n* March 16: Sighting of Zamal (Samar), one of the Philippine Islands. They landed on the uninhabited island of Humunu (Homonhon) where they encountered fishermen from the nearby island of Zuluan (Suluan).
