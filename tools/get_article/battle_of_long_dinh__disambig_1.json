Agents subsequently confirmed the information.\nOperation\nAt 07:30 on 26 February an airborne battalion, two marine battalions, an M113 troop, two Civil Guard companies, and naval craft encircled the suspect area. The government troops then converged, cutting their way through heavy vegetation. Contact began almost immediately, but major fighting did not commence until 13:00. Artillery and fighter-bombers hit the VC as the force advanced and U.S. helicopters flew a ranger battalion into a blocking position. At 18:30, the 514th Battalion charged the 1st\nMarine Battalion in a mangrove swamp. Two companies held in heavy fighting, but a third company broke, allowing the VC to escape. Operations on subsequent days failed to regain contact.\nAftermath\nThe South Vietnamese lost 19 killed, 40 wounded, and one missing. 89 VC were killed and took two captured and a further 22 suspects were detained. In a rare imposition of\naccountability, the South Vietnamese demoted to the rank of private three officers in the Marine company that had fled the battle.\nReferences"
