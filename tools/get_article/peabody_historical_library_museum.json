It is located in the Downtown Historic District of Peabody, Kansas.  The building has state significance because it was the first free tax-supported library in Kansas.\nHistory\nLibrary\nThe city of Peabody was named in 1871 after F.H. Peabody, of Boston, formerly vice-president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway company. In May 1874, Mr. Peabody visited the new city, at which time he announced he would donate money for a library building, furniture, books, periodicals and landscaping if the Peabody township would secure four lots for the site.  The contract for construction was awarded in early 1875, and the library was opened to the public in June; in February 1876 the state legislature authorized the township to levy a tax to support the library.  The structure housed the library facilities until 1914.\nMoved\nIn 1914, the library was moved, and the Peabody Township Carnegie Library was constructed on the original location.  The building was initially moved to the Peabody City Park, then later it was moved to south of the old Peabody Grade School near the railroad tracks.  It was restored in 1927.  The building was used for club meetings and stood idle for a number of years.\nMuseum\nIn 1960, while planning for the 1961 Kansas centennial celebration, local citizens organized to move the structure to a lot near its original location (east of the Carnegie library).  The old library building was converted and dedicated as a museum on July 3, 1961.\nHours\nAs of 2011, it is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day on the 1st and 3rd Saturday of each month and each federal holiday (Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day).  The hours are 1 pm to 3 pm on each of these days.\nGallery\nImage:Fountain next to W.H. Morgan House in Peabody, Kansas.jpg|Fountain next to W.H. Morgan House (immediate right), W.H.
