The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting member, Liberal MP Michael MacKellar on 18 February 1994, from the safe Liberal seat. The writ for the by-election was issued on the same day.\nThe by-election was won by Liberal candidate Tony Abbott who served as the Prime Minister of Australia from 18 September 2013 to 15 September 2015. Abbott would hold the seat for 25 years until he would lose the seat to teal independent Zali Steggall.\nThe Warringah by-election was held on the same day as the Mackellar by-election triggered by the resignation of sitting Liberal member Jim Carlton.\nDuring the by-elections in Mackellar and Warringah, the maverick far-right Labor MP Graeme Campbell urged electors to vote for Australians Against Further Immigration. Labor did not field a candidate in either by-election.\nUnsuccessful candidates for Liberal preselection included former NSW Liberal leader John Dowd, future MP Peter King, and future senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.\nResults\nSee also\n* List of Australian federal by-elections\nReferences"
