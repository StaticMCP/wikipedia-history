Jones gives readers a perspective on Zora Neale Hurston's influence as a writer and how she chose to reveal herself through her writings. Through the stories of country folks, farmers, factory workers, and more, Hurston explores every capacity of the human experience. Jones also explains how Zora Neale Hurston shares her sense of humor with her audiences. An important aspect of Zora Neale Hurston's writings, according to Jones, is that even the happiest and funniest characters still get the blues. Jones describes how Hurston shares all walks of life through parents, lovers, children, spouses, and friends. Jones also explains how Hurston found inspiration from her hometown of Eatonville, Florida and made no attempts to hide its identity. Hurston loved her hometown and her writings are both love letters and testimonies to where she grew up. According to Jones, Hurston's stories are timeless as she portrays people with underlying power that they must find within themselves. Jones describes how Alice Walker found Zora Neale Hurston's grave and how Hurston was a victim of racism and sexism.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction to Zora Neale Hurston's, Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick, dated October 22, 2019, was written by Genevieve West.

Grant begins his review by explaining how eight of the short stories from Hurston's collection are recovered from the Harlem Renaissance anecdotes from the 1920s and 1930s. Grant goes on to provide examples and analysis as to how specific tales such as Sweat, and The Country in the Woman, support Hurston's theme of \"feisty women\" overcoming abusive men in their lives. Grant also explains how Muttsy, and In Under the Bridge, are examples of Hurston's critique of relationships and the treatment of women. Grant also highlights how Hurston brings attention to themes of self-loathing and \"deference to whites that pervade black communities.\" Additionally, Grant points out how jealousy is a frequent theme in Hurston's tales as she warns readers of its effects. Lastly, Colin Grant also addresses how the editor chose not to change the original grammatical idiosyncrasies of Hurston's writings. Hurston wrote in a way that is reflective of the Floridian vernacular of her hometown, Eatonville, which Grant claims adds \"an edge\" to the tales.\nAdditionally, Jabari Asim says in his article, \"The Harlem Renaissance Through Zora Neale Hurston's Eyes,\" for The New York Times how Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick paved the way for Zora Neale Hurston's status as an icon. The short stories are presented in the order they were written, showing her growth as an author as she created more works. Asim commends Hurston for finding humor in the midst of tragedy, but acknowledges how this humor could become confusing for uninformed audiences. Asim highlights how Hurston creates characters who survive in the midst of mayhem, navigate the feelings of love, and face obstacles. There is a \"willingness to live\" in Hurston's characters as she shared the stories of everyday black people doing normal, mundane things.\nReferences"
