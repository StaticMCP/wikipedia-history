Nevada voters chose three electors of the Electoral College, two of whom voted for president and vice president.\nNevada voted in its first ever presidential election in 1864, having become the 36th state just eight days before the election (on October 31). The state was won by the National Union candidate, incumbent Republican President Abraham Lincoln of Illinois and his running mate former Senator and Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. They defeated the Democratic candidate, 4th Commanding General of the United States Army George B. McClellan of New Jersey and his running mate Representative George H. Pendleton of Ohio. Lincoln won the state by a margin of 19.68%.\nDue to one of the electors, Addison Peck, getting snowbound and there being no law to replace him, this election is one of three occasions where only two electoral votes were cast by a state or district in a presidential election: the others were in Mississippi in 1820, as one of the state's three electors died before the Electoral College convened and there was insufficient time to find a replacement, and the District of Columbia in 2000, as one of the district's three electors abstained.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General Election Results\n! colspan=2|Party\n!
