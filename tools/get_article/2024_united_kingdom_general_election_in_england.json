Due to population growth, England elected 10 more MPs than in 2019. The North East, North West, and West Midlands lost seats, while the East Midlands, East, London, South East, and South West gained seats.\nAnalysis\nThe Labour Party won the majority of seats in England for the first time since 2005, with a net gain of 166 seats for a total of 348. Labour won the most seats in every region of England for the first time, Labour also won the most votes in all but two regions, coming second behind the Conservatives in South East England and third behind the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in South West England. Every Labour gain in England was from the Conservatives compared to 2019, this does not include seats that Labour lost due to defections and by-elections during the Parliament but regained in this election, such as Rochdale from the Workers Party. Labour's seven losses were all in England, five to independents including former leader Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North, one to the Green Party in Bristol Central and one to the Conservative Party in Leicester East. The Co-operative Party, which is in an electoral pact with Labour, won 38 seats, its best ever showing in England. All of its candidates and MP's are labelled as Labour-Co-op, and simply included in Labour's total.\nThe Conservative Party had their worst ever result in England, being reduced to 116 seats following a net loss of 229. The Conservatives lost the majority of their seats in every region of England, and lost most of their 'red wall' seats which they had gained from Labour in 2019, for example only one Conservative MP was elected in North East England (Stockton West), and only three Conservative MPs were elected in North West England. Nearly a third of Conservative losses in England were to the Liberal Democrats, particularly in South East England and South West England. Both Reform UK and the Green Party also gained from the Conservatives. Liz Truss lost her own seat of South West Norfolk to Labour. The only Conservative gain in England was Leicester East, where a split Labour vote between the official Labour candidate and former Labour MPs Claudia Webbe and Keith Vaz depressed the Labour vote.\nThe Liberal Democrats had their best ever result in England, and the best result for any liberal party in England since 1923, they won 65 seats, 59 gains from 2019. Every Liberal Democrat gain was from the Conservatives, and were mainly in the south of England. The Liberal Democrats came second in terms of votes and seats in South West England, outpolling Labour on votes and the Conservatives on seats. The only regions in England without any Liberal Democrat MPs are East Midlands and North East England.\nReform UK won five seats, all in England, three in East of England and two in East Midlands, all five were gains from the Conservatives. Party leader Nigel Farage was elected in Clacton, former leader Richard Tice was elected in Boston and Skegness, and Lee Anderson who had defected from the Conservatives, was re-elected in Ashfield, the other two Reform seats were Great Yarmouth (Rupert Lowe) and South Basildon and East Thurrock (James McMurdock). All five seats were strongly pro-Brexit, each voting more than 70% to Leave in 2016. Reform finished in third place in terms of votes in East of England, North East England (just 0.4% behind the Conservatives), North West England, East Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire and The Humber. Most of the seats where Reform UK came second were in England, particularly in the north behind Labour and ahead of the Conservatives.\nThe Green Party had their best ever result. They won four seats, Siân Berry defended Brighton Pavilion after Caroline Lucas did not stand again, while co-leader Carla Denyer gained Bristol Central from Labour, co-leader Adrian Ramsay gained Waveney Valley from the Conservatives, and Ellie Chowns gained North Herefordshire from the Conservatives. The Green Party therefore has MPs across four English regions: one each in East of England, South East England, South West England and West Midlands. The Green Party also came second in many safe Labour seats for the first time, including most seats in central London, and every other seat in Bristol.\nFive independent MPs were elected in England, the highest number of independent MPs since 1945. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn held his seat in Islington North, after being expelled from the party. The other four independent gains were in previously safe Labour seats: Blackburn, Birmingham Perry Barr, Dewsbury and Batley and Leicester South. Each constituency had a large Muslim population, and these independents were elected in opposition to Labour's stance on the Israel-Gaza war.\nThe Workers Party lost their 1-seat, that they had won in a by-election a few months prior to the general election.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party\n! colspan=\"5\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" | Aggregate votes\n|-\n!
