It took place outside Japanese territorial waters, near the Japanese island of Amami Ōshima, in the East China Sea on 22 December 2001.\nThe encounter ended in the sinking of the North Korean vessel and the loss of its fifteen crew, which had survived the initial sinking but were left to drown.  The Japanese authorities later announced the vessel to have been a spy craft. Though the encounter took place outside Japanese territorial waters, the vessels were within the exclusive economic zone, an area extending  from Japanese land, within which Japan can claim exclusive rights to fishing and mineral resources.\nBackground\nAn unidentified ship was spotted in Japanese waters on 21 December 2001. The armed trawler was detected by a communications station in Kikaijima, Kagoshima, which was under control of the Japanese Defense Intelligence Headquarters.\nIn 1999, another North Korean vessel encountered by the Japanese Coast Guard was claimed by Japan to have been a spy craft, though North Korea denied it.\nBattle\nEarly the following morning, the ship was chased by four Japanese Coast Guard vessels, who ordered it to halt, and fired 25 warning shots upon the ship when those orders were ignored. A six-hour firefight ensued, in which over 1,000 machine gun rounds were fired by both sides; the North Korean crew were said to have wielded shoulder-held rocket launchers.\nThe North Korean trawler was meanwhile hit by a number of  rounds. Several explosions not directly related to Japanese attacks rocked the ship before it was sunk. According to The Guardian, \"fifteen survivors were seen clinging to a buoy in heavy seas, but the Japanese ships were ordered to ignore them because of fears that they would use force to resist capture\". Two bodies were recovered, thirteen more persons were declared missing and presumed dead several days later.\nThe Special Boarding Unit was mobilized to board the ship, but did not do so as they had to wait for official orders from the Japanese Defense Agency. The ship sank before such orders arrived.\nAftermath\n{|\n|Ship name=Changyu 3705\n|Ship out of service=10 December 2001\n|Ship stricken=\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship honors=\n|Ship fate=Sunk by Japan Coast Guard\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship propulsion=4 Russian High-Speed Diesel Engines\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship range=1,200nm (2,200 km)\n|Ship complement=10\n|Ship armament=14.5mm anti-aircraft gun\n|Ship notes=Bow and super structure similar to a long-liner, but with a hard chined V-bottom hull and a hidden well deck in the stern.\n}}\n|}\nIn 2003 the trawler was raised by the Japanese to confirm its origin and intentions. Inspection of the hull determined it was of North Korean origin and most likely an infiltration and spy vessel. It was revealed that the vessel was camouflaged as a Chinese or Japanese fishing boat and that it could reach a speed of , far faster than any commercial trawler. The ship also contained a hidden double-hatch located in the stern to be used as an exit door for speedboats.\nOnce the inspections were completed, the hull was displayed at the Japanese Coast Guard Museum Yokohama in Yokohama, where the trawler became a popular tourist attraction. The Nippon Foundation proposed to the JCG to keep the damaged hull to educate the public instead of scrapping it.\nAmong the items found in the trawler include anti-aircraft guns, a B-10 recoilless rifle, a SA-16 MANPAD, RPG-7s, a PKM machine gun and Type 88 assault rifles.\nSee also\n* Fushin-sen – Battle of Amami-Ōshima is one of the most notable Fushin-sen type of incidents\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*"
