The Cougars, led by first year head coach Jon Harris, played their home games at the Vadalabene Center as members of the West Division of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). They finished the season 6–22, 3–13 in OVC play to finish in fifth place in the west division. They failed to qualify for the OVC tournament.\nOff-season\nA nationwide search for a new head coach began in March, 2015, and on April 3, Edwardsville native Jon Harris, an assistant coach for the California Golden Bears was introduced as the new Cougars head coach. Harris announced the addition of assistant coaches Kent Williams and Tarrence Crump on April 24. On May 28, Charles \"Bubba\" Wells was also added to the staff.\nPreseason\nSix players, all of whom saw major playing time, return from the 12–16 team of 2014–15. One recruit from high school signed by previous coach Lennox Forrester joined the team in addition to others recruited by new coach Harris and his staff, including three transfers from Southern Illinois junior colleges (one from local Lewis & Clark), a transferring graduate student with remaining eligibility, and a transfer who will be eligible after the semester break. Missing from the mix is Donovine Stewart, last season's leader in minutes played, assists, and steals and #2 in scoring and rebounding, who graduated with a year of eligibility remaining and was said to have been contacted about transferring by Illinois, Minnesota, USC, and others, with Illinois having requested his transcripts; Stewart eventually transferred to Portland State but sat out the PSU @ SIUE game on December 12.\nSeason\nThe 2015–16 season will begin in mid-November, 2015.\nAlthough the final schedule was not released until August 2, SIUE's non-conference opponents for the upcoming campaign were announced in May.
