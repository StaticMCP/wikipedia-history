It then became relatively hard to find, until ''\"the master tapes mysteriously appeared on Chemikal Underground's doorstep\".  The album was re-released on the Chemikal Underground label in 2001, with an additional two tracks forming the basis for a second CD of Mogwai Fear Satan remixes, from My Bloody Valentine, and μ-Ziq. In 1998, the album was licensed by Eye-Q to the now defunct label, Jetset.  The version Jetset released contained all of the Mogwai Fear Satan remixes on a second disc.\nTrack listing\nThe following corresponds to the 1998 double CD release.
