It is part of the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin.\nBrûlé Lake has five unnamed inflows: one at the east; one at the southeast; one at the south; one at the west; and one at the north. The primary outflow is an unnamed creek at the north which heads in the direction of Jocko Lake, which flows via the Jocko River and the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River.\nThe Ontario Northland Railway runs along the northeast shore of the lake; the railway passes through the community of Jocko about  north of the lake.\nSee also\n*List of lakes in Ontario\nReferences"
