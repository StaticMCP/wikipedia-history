They were the first contested elections held in the country since 1979, and only the fourth contested elections of any sort since the country gained independence in 1957.\nJerry Rawlings, who had led the country since taking power in a 1981 coup, had grudgingly agreed to hold multiparty elections earlier in the year. Rawlings ran as the candidate of the Progressive Alliance, which included his National Democratic Congress, and won 58.4% of the vote, enough to win without the need for a runoff. Voter turnout was 50.2%.\nThe opposition accused Rawlings and his supporters of engaging in massive fraud, including ballot-box stuffing and altering results after they were certified. Nonetheless, international observers pronounced the elections free and fair.\nResults\nReferences"
