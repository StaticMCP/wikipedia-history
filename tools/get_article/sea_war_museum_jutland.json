It is about the Battle of Jutland, which took place during World War I, on 31 May 1916. Attached to the museum is the Jutland Memorial Park, which commemorates the 8,645 sailors from both the United Kingdom and Germany who died in the battle.\nMuseum exhibitions\nThe museum includes the following:\n*British and German U-boats\n* The Battle of Jutland\n* The Battle of Heligoland Bight\n* The Battle of Dogger Bank\n* The air war over the North Sea\n* RMS Lusitania and U-20 exhibition\n* Seamine exhibition\n* Torpedo exhibition\n* Marine archaeology\nThe Sea War Museum Jutland not only tells the story about the Battle of Jutland but also about four years of war, which was fought on, above and below the surface of the sea. It was four brutal years with submarines and zeppelins, with mine war and destroyer war, with trade war and cruiser war. Men fought and died in the cold waves of the North Sea, and in reality, the war might have been decided here. Whoever controlled the sea-lanes to England would also win the war, and the North Sea consequently came to play a crucial role.\nThe museum also holds some artifacts from the German U-boat U-20, which was famous for its role in the sinking of the Lusitania. The U-20 ran aground near the Danish coast and the conning tower of the U-20 is now on display at the Sea War Museum.\nWar memorial\nJutland Memorial Park is a memorial park in Thyborøn, Jutland, Denmark.\nOne of the world's largest sea battles took place between 31 May and 1 June 1916 during World War I. 250 warships were engaged in battle, in this test of strength between the British Royal Navy and the German Kaiserliche Kriegsmarine. 25 ships were sunk during the battle and more than 8,600 sailors lives were lost.\nThe goal of this memorial park is to bring its victims to light and to remember those who died during the battle. In doing so, this will create one of the largest war memorial, located on the west coast of Jutland close to where the battle took place.\nThe memorial consist of 26 granite blocks, which commemorates each ship sunk in the battle, and one for casualties on other ships. Currently,  300 white statues makes the death of the sailors. In the future, the hope is to raise the necessary funding to have 8,645 statues, one for each sailor.\nThe memorial was opened on the day of the hundredth anniversary of the battle. The event was hosted by the Royal Navy Admiral John Jellicoe's grandson, Nicolas Jellicoe, and by Kaiserliche Kriegsmarines Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer's great-grandson, Reinhard Scheer.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.jutlandbattlememorial.com/english.html Jutland Memorial Park]"
