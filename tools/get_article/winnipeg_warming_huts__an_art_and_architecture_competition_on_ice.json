The competition features art installations submitted by various artists and architects that are placed along the frozen Red River and Assiniboine River for the community to enjoy. The Warming Huts are the product of a recurring exercise in design and construction that takes place on the frozen rivers of Winnipeg every winter with limitless design variations allowing a lot of freedom for concept exploration.\nHistory\nThe competition was first established in 2009 by Sputnik Architecture Inc. with the main purpose of attracting the public back to the downtown section of Winnipeg, especially during the cold winter months. The location of the competition was chosen because of its importance to Canadian history. The Forks Historic Site was used mainly during two time periods, 5600 BC - 1000 BC and 500 AD - 2000 AD, as a route to transport and trade goods at its location in the junction of the Red and Assiniboine River. The river was commonly used by many Indigenous peoples, the most common group being Algonquin peoples.\nCompetition guidelines\nThe installations should follow the themes of engaging the effects of solar radiation, wind chill, and the snow shifting the landscapes. The three winning designs will be chosen by a blind jury based on their inventive use of materials, ability to provide shelter, poetics of assembly and form, integration with the environment, and simplicity of construction. The design has to be durable or reliable in order to withstand the elements of the Winnipeg winters.\nPast artists and architects\nThe Warming Huts have been designed and built with the participation of significant designers and artists from around the world. These installations include works from Frank Gehry, Anish Kapoor, Étienne Gaboury, and Patkau Architects. Works from the first decade of the Warming Huts are documented in the book \"Warming Huts: a decade + of art and architecture on ice\".\nPast installations\nEvery year three winners are chosen by the blind jury.
