      "text": "# Torriani Award\n\nThe Torriani Award is given annually by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) to an ice hockey player with an \"outstanding career from non-top hockey nation\". It was inaugurated in 2015, and is awarded alongside the annual IIHF Hall of Fame induction ceremony at the Ice Hockey World Championships. It is named for Bibi Torriani, who played internationally for the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team. Recipients of the Torriani Award are inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame into their own category, separate from other players, referees and builders.\nWhen the award was first announced, IIHF president René Fasel was quoted as saying; \"we wanted to create a trophy which honours players for a great international career irrespective of where they played. Nowadays, with NHL players and international players often being the same, we feel that there are so many top players to honour. Still, we wanted to ensure we recognized players who didn’t necessarily win Olympic and World Championship medals but who still had remarkable careers. As a result, we created the Torriani Award, and Lucio Topatigh is a very worthy first recipient\".\nRecipients\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year!!Recipient!!Nation!!International accomplishments\n|-\n|2015\n|\n|\n|Played for the Italy men's national team from 1990 until 2002, and again at the 2006 Winter Olympics where he was the oldest on the team.\n|-\n|2016\n|\n|\n|Played 187 games for the Hungary men's national team, helping the team gained promotion to the Ice Hockey World Championships top tier.\n|-\n|2017\n|\n|}}\n|Played for the Great Britain men's national team at 11 Ice Hockey World Championships, was the first British player drafted by a National Hockey League team.\n|-\n|2018\n|\n|\n|Played 256 games for the Denmark men's national team at 17 Ice Hockey World Championships.\n|-\n|2019\n|\n|\n|Played for the Bulgaria men's national team at 28 Ice Hockey World Championships, and three IIHF Inline Hockey World Championships with the Bulgaria men's national inline hockey team, then retired from international play at age 51.\n|-\n|2020/2022}}\n|\n|\n|Played for the Netherlands ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics, and served as captain of the Netherlands men's national ice hockey team from 1982 to 1993.
