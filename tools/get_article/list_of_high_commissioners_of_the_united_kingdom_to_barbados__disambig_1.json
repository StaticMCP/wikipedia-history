Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.\nThe high commission in Barbados also covers several other Commonwealth countries in the Eastern Caribbean:\n* Antigua and Barbuda (since June 2008);\n* The Commonwealth of Dominica;\n* Grenada (since 2006);\n* The Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis (passed from Antigua to Barbados in June 2008);\n* Saint Lucia;\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (since 2007).\nList of heads of mission\nHigh commissioners to Barbados\n* 1966–1970: John S.
