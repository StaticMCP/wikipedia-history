Like the previous MSG (Messenger of God) films, this too is a propaganda piece made by the subject of the said propaganda, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh himself\". Mihir Bhanage of The Times of India gave it 1.5 stars out of 5, describing the film as indicative of Singh's self-obsession. Bhanage wrote, \"It takes guts to roll out such preachy and glorified films, but the saga continues with a devil-may-care attitude.\"\nAnshu Lal of Firstpost described the film as \"horrible\". Specific criticism was centered on problems in storytelling, such as the use of pop-up video. Lal wrote, \"Because without that pop-up, how would the poor audience comprehend the concept of background narration, right?\" Lal also criticised the plot, the acting, and the cartoonish nature of the film. Namrata Thakker of Rediff.com gave it half star out of 5, and wrote that it is only for die-hard fans of Singh's. Aakash Karkare of Scroll.in wrote that movie is every bit as terrible as you expect it to be.\nBox office\nAccording to The Times of India the film collected approximately 32 million in its first weekend with an estimated total of 46 million after five days.
