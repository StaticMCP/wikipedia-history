It is  down the line from London Charing Cross. The station is operated by Southeastern but is also served by trains operated by Southern.\nHistory\nThe station building and house, still in existence today, were constructed in 1851 by the South Eastern Railway (SER). The competing London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) trains were not allowed to stop here until December 1870. Between 1851 and 1882, it was named Gensing Station.  The two companies maintained separate booking offices until 1923 when they both became part of the Southern Railway. The station is constructed in a narrow valley with higher ground east and west, so that trains arrive and depart either end of the platform through tunnels. This restricts the number of carriages which have direct access to the platform to 8 cars.\nServices\nServices at St Leonards Warrior Square are operated by Southern and Southeastern.\nThe typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:\nSouthern\n* 1 tph to  via\n* 1 tph to  (semi-fast)\n* 1 tph to  (stopping)\n* 2 tph to  of which 1 continue to\n* 1 tph to\nDuring the peak hours and on Saturdays, the station is also served by an additional hourly semi-fast service between Brighton and Ore.\nSouthern services at St Leonards Warrior Square are operated using  EMUs and  DMUs.\nSoutheastern\n* 2 tph to London Charing Cross via  (1 semi-fast, 1 stopping)\n* 2 tph to\nSoutheastern also operate a number of peak hour services to London Cannon Street and .\nSoutheastern services at St Leonards Warrior Square are operated using  EMUs.\n|rows2=2}}\nor |route=Southeastern|next=|col= }}\n|col=}}\nReferences\nExternal links"
