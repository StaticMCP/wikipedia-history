Tice was the third of the Vikings' six head coaches to be promoted from within the team's coaching ranks but the first to have actually played for the team.\nThis for the first time since 1989, Cris Carter was not on the opening day roster.\nThe Vikings lost their opening game in Chicago 27–23 after surrendering a 20–10 halftime lead, and ended up going 0–4 before their bye week. Results improved after the bye, but they ultimately went 6–6 in their remaining games, including a three-game winning streak to end the season. They finished the season with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs for the second year in a row.\nSecond-year running back Michael Bennett enjoyed a successful year, rushing for 1,296 yards, resulting in a Pro Bowl selection at the end of the season. After losing Cris Carter to retirement, Randy Moss had a career-high 106 receptions, but only had 7 touchdowns.\nAfter the season, Derrick Alexander retired.\nOffseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Additions || Subtractions\n|-\n|WR Derrick Alexander (Chiefs) || T Brad Badger (Raiders)\n|-\n|WR D'Wayne Bates (Bears) || P Mitch Berger (Rams)\n|-\n|LB Greg Biekert (Raiders) || WR Cris Carter (Dolphins)\n|-\n|CB Corey Chavous (Cardinals) || CB Dale Carter (Saints)\n|-\n|LB Henri Crockett (Falcons) || WR Jake Reed (Saints)\n|-\n|DE Kenny Mixon (Dolphins) || LB Kailee Wong (Texans)\n|-\n|P Kyle Richardson (Ravens) || WR Troy Walters (Colts)\n|-\n|FS Ronnie Bradford (Falcons) || FS Robert Griffith (Browns)\n|-\n|DE Lorenzo Bromell (Dolphins) || CB Robert Tate (Ravens)\n|-\n|TE Hunter Goodwin (Dolphins) || CB Kenny Wright (Texans)\n|-\n|DE Chuck Wiley (Falcons) ||\n|}\n2002 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 2002 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Overall\n|-\n!1||7\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Bryant McKinnie||Offensive tackle||Miami (FL)||\n|-\n!2||38\n|Raonall Smith||Linebacker||Washington State||\n|-\n!3||70\n|Willie Offord||Safety||South Carolina||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|4||105\n|Brian Williams||Cornerback||NC State||\n|-\n!132\n|Ed Ta'amu||Guard||Utah||Compensatory pick\n|-\n!5||141\n|colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Cleveland Browns\n|-\n!6||177\n|Nick Rogers||Linebacker||Georgia Tech||\n|-\n!7||218\n|Chad Beasley||Offensive tackle||Virginia Tech||\n|}\nNotes:\nUndrafted free agents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2002 undrafted free agents of note\n!Player\n!Position\n!College\n|-\n|Jack Brewer\n|Safety\n|Minnesota\n|-\n|Kelly Campbell\n|Wide receiver\n|Georgia Tech\n|-\n|Nick Davis\n|Wide receiver\n|Wisconsin\n|-\n|Shaun Hill\n|Quarterback\n|Maryland\n|-\n|Max Yates\n|Linebacker\n|Marshall\n|}\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
