Created as Anderston/City in 2007, it returned four council members, using the single transferable vote system. The same criteria applied in 2012. For the 2017 Glasgow City Council election, the boundaries were changed, the ward slightly decreased in size (although slightly increased in population) and was renamed Anderston/City/Yorkhill, still returning four councillors.\nBoundaries\nThe ward covers Glasgow city centre and the Merchant City which contain many office and retail premises but also some residential buildings, and also includes the more heavily populated areas of Cowcaddens, Garnethill and Townhead north of the city centre, along with the campuses of both the University of Strathclyde and Glasgow Caledonian University, with the M8 motorway being the northern boundary and High Street the eastern. The River Clyde forms the southern border of the ward, which stretches west through Anderston, Finnieston, Kelvinhaugh and Yorkhill to the River Kelvin.\nThe Kelvingrove residential area to the north of Finnieston lies within the ward, but Kelvingrove Park and the Park District which were also originally included in 2007 were reassigned to Hillhead ward in 2017. At that time the small Ladywell neighbourhood and the grounds of Glasgow Royal Infirmary were reassigned to a new Dennistoun ward. 'Yorkhill' was added to the name to better reflect the distribution of population, with most of the ward's residents living in areas west of Anderston.\nThe ethnic makeup of the Anderston/City/Yorkhill ward using the 2011 census population statistics was:\n*75.9% White Scottish / British / Irish / Other\n*18.1% Asian (mainly Chinese)\n*2.8% Black (mainly African)\n*3% Mixed / Other Ethnic Group\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|Philip Braat(Labour)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Gordon Matheson(Labour)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n||Craig MacKay(SNP)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Nina Baker(Green)\n|-\n!2012\n||Martin John Docherty(SNP)\n|-\n!2015 by\n|rowspan=4|Eva Bolander(SNP)\n|-\n!2016 by\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Angus Millar(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Christy Mearns(Green)\n|-\n!2022\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Election\n2022 Glasgow City Council election\n2017 Election\n2017 Glasgow City Council election\n2012 Election\n2012 Glasgow City Council election\n2015 by-election\nOn 14 May 2015, SNP Cllr Martin Docherty resigned his after having been elected as an MP for the constituency of West Dunbartonshire.
