Osborne (1732) was a decision of the Court of King's Bench upholding an indictment, based either on libel or breach of the peace, for publishing a pamphlet claiming that the Portuguese Jews in London had burned alive a Jewish woman and her child born of a Christian father. The decision was reported in three case reports, each with varying details.\nWorks cited\n* Joseph Tanenhaus, \"Group Libel\""
