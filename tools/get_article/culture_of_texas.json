It is considered diverse,encompassing many different subcultures. It includes regional and cultural influences from the German Texans, Tejanos, Cajuns, Irish, African American, and White Anglo-Southern communities established before the republic era and statehood.\nTexas is divided into five major regions; East Texas, Central Texas, North Texas, South Texas, and West Texas. These regions are defined by urban centers and varying cultural characteristics. The Texas Triangle, formed by Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio, is an interstate corridor between the three major Texan cities closest to the geographic center, each representing distinct cultural areas.\nTexas is bordered by the western prairies, the Deep South, and Mexico, incorporating Hispanic, African and Anglo traditions. Texas also includes communities with origins in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mexico, Southern African American and White Southern populations, as well as Native Americans. Texas is placed in the Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau.\nAgriculture\nTexas has the most farms and the highest acreage in the United States. The state is ranked  for revenue generated from total livestock and livestock products. It is ranked  for total agricultural revenue, behind California. At $7.4 billion, or 56.7 percent of Texas's annual agricultural cash receipts, beef cattle production represents the largest single segment of Texan agriculture. This is followed by cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broiler chickens at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent).\nTexas produces the most cattle, horses, sheep, goats, wool, mohair, and hay in the United States. The state also produces the most cotton in the United States, which is the number one crop grown in the state in terms of value. The state also grows significant amounts of cereal crops and produce.\nRanch and cowboy culture\nTexas holds a strong ranching tradition which has had significant influence on American cowboy culture, particularly in rodeo. The state is strongly associated with the image of the cowboy shown in westerns and in country music, for which it is known for both nationally and internationally. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular topic in pop culture, seen in media such as the TV series Dallas.\nRodeo\nIn 1997, House Concurrent Resolution No. 21 was adopted by the 75th Legislature of the State of Texas, declaring rodeo as the official sport of Texas. The annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the world's largest known rodeo. It is held over 20 days, from late February through early March. The event begins with trail rides that originate from several points throughout the state, all of which convene at NRG Park for a barbecue cook-off.

The Texas Folklore Society is the second-oldest folklore organization continually functioning in the United States.

Many renowned musicians' origins are in Houston including Lyle Lovett, Beyoncé, Clint Black, The Crusaders, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Kenny Rogers as well as groups including D.R.I., Helstar, La Mafia, the Geto Boys, and ZZ Top.  The Houston Symphony and Houston Grand Opera are both attractions of the Houston Theater District.\nBeyond Austin and Houston, other regions of Texas also contribute richly to the state’s musical identity. San Antonio, with its deep Mexican-American roots, is known for nurturing Tejano and conjunto music, blending traditional Mexican folk with modern influences. In the Panhandle and West Texas, artists like Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison helped pioneer early rock and roll, with Lubbock and El Paso continuing to serve as creative hubs for emerging talent.

The traditionalistic views want the social hierarchy and norms to remain the same and influence policies such as same sex marriage and abortion. These views have also contributed to the low voter turnout experienced in Texas, since Texas has a history of voter suppression, with it being cited as being viewed as an economic perk. Individualistic views focus on yourself or your immediate family or friends. This contributes to lower taxes and lack of income tax.\nOther\nThe Texas Folklife Festival is an annual event sponsored by the University of Texas at San Antonio's Institute of Texan Cultures celebrating the many ethnicities represented in the population of the state of Texas. Thousands attend the three-day event each year, which features food, crafts, music, and dances from ethnic groups that immigrated to Texas.\nA 2015 report by non-profit organization Mission:  Readiness found that 73% of military-aged youth in Texas were physically ineligible for military service due to issues with obesity and ill-health, a rate much higher than the national average.\nSee also\n* Institute of Texan Cultures\n* List of people from Texas\n* List of Texas state symbols\n* Languages of Texas, including Texas German\n* Texas Institute of Letters\nReferences"
