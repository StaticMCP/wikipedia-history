It was the first time the Presidents Cup was played in Asia.\nThe United States won for the sixth successive time with a 15–14 victory over the International team, tied with the 1996 Presidents Cup (16–15) for the narrowest margin of victory.\nCourse layout\nJack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!align=\"left\"|Hole!!1!!2!!3!!4!!5!!6!!7!!8!!9!!Out!!10!!11!!12!!13!!14!!15!!16!!17!!18!!In!!Total\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|Yards||426||424||591||396||170||471||560||234||452||3,724||435||430||463||207||361||572||477||202||542||3,689||7,413\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|Par||4||4||5||4||3||4||5||3||4||36||4||4||4||3||4||5||4||3||5||36||72\n|}\nFormat\nThe format changed from previous Cup play. The first two days consisted of five matches of foursomes and five matches of fourball. The third day consisted of four matches of foursomes and four matches of fourball. The host team captain decided the order, fourball vs. foursomes, on the first three days. On the fourth and final day, twelve singles matches were played. 30 matches were played in all. All matches that are all-square after 18 holes scored  point for each team.\nEach member of the teams had to play in a minimum of two matches in the first three days, a reduction from the three match minimum from 2003 to 2013.\nTeam qualification and selection\nBoth teams had 12 players.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Key\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| Top ten on points list\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| Two captain's picks\n|- style=\"background:#c1c1c1;\"\n| Not available, in top 15 of points list\n|-\n| Not picked, in top 15 of points list\n|}\nInternational team\nThe International team featured the top 10 players in the Official World Golf Ranking at the conclusion of the 2015 Deutsche Bank Championship on 7 September and two captain's picks.

Phil Mickelson has appeared in all eleven Presidents Cups. Host country South Korea was represented with vice captain K. J. Choi, Danny Lee (who plays as a New Zealander, but was born in South Korea), and Bae Sang-moon in his last competition before his military obligation. Bill Haas was chosen for his third Presidents Cup, the most for an American without a Ryder Cup appearance.\nThursday's foursomes matches\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ddffdd;\"\n! width=160| International\n!

Overall\n! 4\n|}\nFriday's fourball matches\nThe American pairing of Zach Johnson and Phil Mickelson were penalised 1 hole after Mickelson played a harder ball at the par 5 7th hole, in contravention to a \"one-ball condition\". The one-ball condition states that a player must use the same type of ball throughout his round. The one-ball condition was in place for the fourball matches, although not for the foursomes. After his tee shot, Mickelson was incorrectly informed by a rules official that he was disqualified from the hole and Mickelson picked up his ball. The correct penalty was a loss of 1 hole, which was adjusted to the state of the match after the 7th hole. However, it was then too late for Mickelson, who could have played out the 7th hole. Jason Day won the 7th hole with a birdie 4. The match had been all square after 6 holes but, with the International pair winning the 7th hole and with the 1 hole penalty, the International pair became 2 up after 7 holes. The match ended up all square.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ddffdd;\"\n! width=160| International\n!

American Bill Haas, the son of team captain Jay Haas, clinched the victory on the final hole of the final match. With Haas 1 up, Bae needed to win the 18th to halve the match and the Presidents Cup. Bae mishit his third shot, a chip, and then missed his fourth shot. Haas then hit his third shot, from a bunker, to 6 feet and Bae conceded the match. Earlier Branden Grace has won his singles match, becoming only the fifth player to win five matches in a Presidents Cup match.
