Once established, the museum began accepting visitors in 2021. Since its founding, the museum and society have participated in educational initiatives, conservation efforts, and contribute expertise relating to Canadian nuclear history.\nExhibits and collections\nThe museum features exhibits highlighting:\n* The history of the Chalk River Laboratories.\n* The development of CANDU reactors.\n* The contributions of Indigenous communities in the region.\n* Artifacts from the early days of nuclear research in Canada.\n* Books, pamphlets, and reports relating to Canadian nuclear research.\n* Interviews with pioneers of the Canadian nuclear industry.\n* Photographs, maps, and drawings from the early development of Chalk River Labs.\nSee also\n* Nuclear power in Canada\n* Atomic Energy of Canada Limited\n* Chalk River Laboratories\n* Whiteshell Laboratories\n* Montreal Laboratory\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
