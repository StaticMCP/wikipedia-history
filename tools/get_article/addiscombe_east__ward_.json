The ward replaced the former Ashburton Ward, which covered the Ashburton area, as well as covering the main retail area of Addiscombe, the Stroud Green, Tollgate and Longheath Garden estates, and large parts of northern Shirley. The population of the former ward at the 2011 Census was 14,721.\nThe ward currently forms part of the Croydon Central constituency, which is one of the most marginal in the country. In 2015, only 165 votes separated the Conservatives and Labour.\nThe ward returns two councillors every four years to Croydon Council. At the 2018 London local elections Maddie Henson and Jeet Bains were elected. They were both re-elected at the 2022 London local elections.\nList of Councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election\n!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!! Party\n!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!
