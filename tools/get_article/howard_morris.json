He was best known for his role in The Andy Griffith Show as Ernest T. Bass, and as \"Uncle Goopy\" in a celebrated comedy sketch on Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows (1954). He did voices for television shows such as The Flintstones (1962–1965), The Jetsons (1962–1987), The Atom Ant Show (1965–1966), and Garfield and Friends (1988–1994).\nLife and career\nMorris was born to a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, the son of Hugo and Elsie (née Theobald) Morris. His father was a rubber company executive. Morris attended New York University on a dramatic arts scholarship.\nDuring World War II, he was assigned to a United States Army Special Services unit where he was the First Sergeant. Maurice Evans was the company commander and Carl Reiner and Werner Klemperer were soldiers in the unit. Based in Honolulu, the unit entertained American troops throughout the Pacific.\nHe came to prominence in appearances on Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows (a live sketch comedy series appearing weekly in the United States, from 1950 to 1954). In April 1954, Morris joined Caesar and Carl Reiner in \"This Is Your Story,\" an 11-minute takeoff on Ralph Edwards's This Is Your Life. Morris claimed it was his favorite sketch role.\nAs The New Yorker's David Margolick wrote in 2014,\n}}\nThis opinion was shared by The New York Times  and Hollywood.com, among others. Conan O'Brien tweeted in 2014, \"Saw this Sid Caesar sketch when I was a kid. It made me want to make people laugh.\" Billy Crystal later called it a defining early influence: \"That's how I used to go to bed. I'd grab my dad's leg, and he'd drag me to bed like Sid Caesar.\" The sketch can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQBlEnsylI0 here], Morris enters at the 4:14 mark. He also appeared twice in 1957 in episodes of the short-lived NBC comedy/variety show The Polly Bergen Show. He notably played the wily and over-the-top mountain man character Ernest T. Bass on The Andy Griffith Show. Also, he played George, the TV mechanic in the episode, \"Andy and Helen Have Their Day.\" (He had lampooned southern accents while in the army at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.)\nHe starred in one of the more comical early hour-long Twilight Zone episodes, \"I Dream of Genie.\" Other roles included that of Elmer Kelp in The Nutty Professor, a movie studio clerk in the short film Star Spangled Salesman, and an art appraiser in an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show.\nHe also appeared in several Broadway shows including the highly regarded 1960 revival of ''Finian's Rainbow as Og the leprechaun opposite Bobby Howes as Finian. He played the role of Schmidlap in Way... Way Out and appeared in the movie, Boys' Night Out (1962).\nVoice acting\nMorris was first heard in animated cartoons in the early 1960s. He and Allan Melvin teamed up for a 50-episode King Features Syndicate series, Beetle Bailey'', for which he and Melvin co-wrote a number of episodes. He provided the voices for Gene Deitch's Academy Award-winning Munro, about a four-year-old boy who was drafted into the Army.\nBeginning in 1962, Morris played a variety of voices in many Hanna-Barbera series including The Jetsons as Jet Screamer who sang the \"Eep opp ork ah ah!\" song, (said to be Morris' first work for Hanna-Barbera) and The Flintstones. He was the original voice of Atom Ant and provided the voice of Mr. Peebles in The Magilla Gorilla Show, teaming up again with Allan Melvin who performed the voice for Magilla. In another series, Morris was heard as the voice of Breezly Bruin which was similar in tone with the Bill Scott vocalization of Bullwinkle. Morris had a disagreement with Joseph Barbera prior to production of the 1966–1967 season of Magilla Gorilla and Atom Ant and all of his voices were recast, mostly using Don Messick. Years later, the two men reconciled and Morris was back doing those voices and others. He also lent his voice to Forsythe \"Jughead\" Jones on Filmation's series The Archies through the life of the franchise, 1968–1977. Moreover, he was the voice of Leonard Blush, \"The Masked Singer\" - he had a skin condition - as well as the regular voice of the Mount Pilot radio station's host on The Andy Griffith Show.\nMorris also voiced the characters Professor Icenstein and Luigi La Bounci in the animated series Galaxy High. He voiced Mayor McCheese and later the Hamburglar (taking over for Larry Storch in 1986) in McDonaldland ad campaign for McDonald's, which Morris also directed. He provided the voice of Wade Duck in the U.S. Acres segments of Garfield and Friends, and voiced Webbly in ''Bobby's World and Flem in Cow & Chicken. Morris supplied the voice of the koala in TV commercials for Qantas from 1967 through 1992 (saying the tagline, \"I hate Qantas\"), and voiced \"Gopher\" in the Disney featurettes Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree and Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day''. Also in 1989, he voiced a French gangster cat named Monte De Zar (Fat Cat's Cousin) in an episode of Disney's ''Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers episode \"Le Purrfect Crime\".\nHe also voiced Squawk in 1992’s Tom and Jerry: The Movie\nVoice directing\nWhile Morris continued to make himself available for voice and sound effect roles, he also began a new career in voice directing. Among the projects he directed are Police Academy, Richie Rich, Bionic Six, Goin' Coconuts, Pole Position, Galaxy High, The Snorks, The Mighty Orbots, Rose Petal Place, The Dogfather, Dragon's Lair, Tom and Jerry: The Movie, Turbo Teen, Little Clowns of Happytown, Space Stars, and Kidd Video.\nDirecting and later career\nMorris directed some episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, Gomer Pyle, Hogan's Heroes, The Dick Van Dyke Show, the black and white pilot episode of Get Smart and later, episodes of One Day at a Time, Bewitched, and single episodes of many other comedy shows. He directed Doris Day in her final film, With Six You Get Eggroll (1968). Other films he directed were Don't Drink the Water (1969) and Who's Minding the Mint?'' (1967).\nMel Brooks occasionally cast Morris in his films. For example, he played Brooks' mentor psychiatrist Dr. Lilloman in the comedy High Anxiety (1977), the emperor's court spokesman (\"Here, wash this!\") in History of the World, Part I (1981), and played a bum named Sailor living in the streets in Life Stinks (1991).\nIn 1984, he played Dr. Zidell in Splash, a film directed by Ron Howard (the two had first worked together on The Andy Griffith Show). He worked with his old friend and trouping partner Sid Caesar as nervous Jewish tailors in the 1998 movie of Ray Bradbury's The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit.\nHe appeared on \"The Love Boat\" (S8 E13) as \"has been\" comedian Billy Banks in a Christmas-themed vignette \"Santa, Santa, Santa\" which aired on 12/15/1984. In 1986, he reprised his famous role as Ernest T. Bass in the highly-rated television movie Return to Mayberry. In 1989, he guest starred on Murder, She Wrote. From 1997 to 1999, he voiced Flem on Cow and Chicken.\nPersonal life\nMorris was married and divorced five times. He was first married to Mary Helen McGowan from 1945 to 1962. He married his second wife, Dolores A. Wylie, later in 1962; the marriage lasted until 1977 when they divorced. During their marriage, Morris appeared as Ernest T. Bass in a 1964 episode of The Andy Griffith Show in which a party is hosted by a “Mrs. Wiley.” He had three daughters and a son, along with three grandchildren.\nDeath\nOn May 21, 2005, Morris died of congestive heart failure, at the age of 85. At his funeral, the \"Uncle Goopy\" sketch was shown; among the eulogizers was Carl Reiner, who praised Morris's ability to improvise. He is entombed in Laurel Gardens Wall crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\nFilmography\nFilm\n*Munro (1961) – narrator\n*Boys Night Out (1962) – Howard McIllenny\n*40 Pounds of Trouble (1962) – Julius\n*The Nutty Professor (1963) – Elmer Kelp\n*Loopy DeLoop (Habit Rabbit) (1963, Short) – Raymond (voice)\n*Fluffy (1965) – Sweeney\n*Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966, Short) – Gopher (voice)\n*Alice of Wonderland in Paris (1966) – The Frowning Prince / King (segment \"The Frowning Prince\") / Grand Wizard (voice)\n*Way...Way Out (1966) – Schmidlap\n*The Big Mouth (1967) – Cameo Role (uncredited)\n*With Six You Get Eggroll (1968) – Hippie in Police Station (uncredited)\n*Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968, Short) – Gopher (voice)\n*''Don't Drink the Water (1969) – Getaway Pilot (uncredited)\n*The Comic (1969) – Pedestrian Gag Man in Love Honor and Oh Boy (uncredited)\n*Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies'' (1972) – Franklin 'Frankie' Frankenstein / Wolfgang 'Wolfie' Wolfman / Mummy / \"Hauntleroy\" (voice)\n*Ten from Your Show of Shows (1973)\n*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) – Gopher (voice) (archive footage)\n*High Anxiety (1977) – Professor Lilloman\n*History of the World, Part I (1981) – Court Spokesman (The Roman Empire)\n*Splash (1984) – Dr. Zidell\n*Return to Mayberry (1986, TV Movie) – Ernest T.
