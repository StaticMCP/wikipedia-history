It is one of Warsaw's chief examples of the Neoclassical-style, featuring large statues of the Atlantes at the entrance.\nHistory\nThe original palace was built by  Ludwik Tyszkiewicz, a Field Hetman of Lithuania. Construction began in 1785, initially to plans by Stanisław Zawadzki, and was finished in 1792 in the Neoclassical style, to a design by Jan Chrystian Kamsetzer. In 1840, the palace was bought by the Potocki family.\nDuring the interwar period, the building was home to Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego and later to the Polish Academy of Literature. Burned in 1944, the palace was rebuilt after World War II and is now a property of Warsaw University.\nThe palace's relatively modest west façade, on Krakowskie Przedmieście, is embellished with some fine stuccowork. The central balcony is supported by four elegant stone Atlantes carved in 1787 by André Le Brun.\nGallery\nImage:Powrót wojsk polskich 1830.JPG|\nImage:Varsovia (Polonia) Warszawa (Polska). 82.jpg|, 2023\nImage:Tyszkiewicz Palace street facade, Warsaw, Poland 01.jpg|\nImage:Pałac Tyszkiewiczów w Warszawie - wejście główne.jpg|\nSee also\n* Holy Cross Church\n* Presidential Palace\n* Kazimierz Palace\nNotes\nExternal links\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20080229070402/http://www.ewarszawa.com/przewodnik/obiekt/index.php?id=96 Pałac Tyszkiewiczów]"
