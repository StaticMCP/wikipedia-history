Shattered Empire was announced in August 2015, to be written by Rucka with art by Checchetto. Set immediately after Return of the Jedi, the comic focuses on A-wing pilot Shara Bey but features classic characters Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and Lando in supporting roles. Shara and her husband, Kes Dameron, are the parents of Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, introduced in the 2015 film The Force Awakens. In creating the story, Rucka collaborated with Rayne Roberts, Kiri Hart, Pablo Hidalgo, and Leland Chee of the Lucasfilm Story Group. The four-part limited series was published by Marvel Comics between September 9 and October 21, 2015.\nReception\nJoshua Yehl of IGN praised Rucka's \"honest and charming dialogue\" and called Checchetto's artwork \"rather spectacular\", noting that \"Shattered Empire delivers a more steady and hard-edged story than any of Marvel’s other Star Wars comics.\" Sean Keane of New York Daily News wrote that Rucka \"does an amazing job of highlighting the intimate moments in a big storyline\". He added that \"Checchetto proves adept at depicting both large battles and more intimate moments, with an expressive style. The new characters, both human and non-human, are well-designed and visually distinctive.\"\nLegacy\nThe series introduced Operation Cinder, a contingency attack carried out by the Empire against its own worlds in the event of Emperor Palpatine's death, including his home world of Naboo (as depicted in the series). The operation was later depicted in the novel ''Aftermath: Empire's End (2017) and the video game Star Wars: Battlefront&nbsp;II (2017), as well being referenced in a season two episode of The Mandalorian'' (2020).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
