In the , Flaxton had a population of 992 people.\nHistory\nThe locality is named after Flaxton Hall Farm in the fens of Eastern England.  Joseph Dixon, who originally grew sugarcane at Buderim, selected land at Flaxton in 1882.  From 1892 the land was cleared so bananas and citrus fruit could be farmed.\nLocal residents began to lobby for a school in 1921 with Mr J. C. Dixon senior donating a  parcel of land on the main range road with panoramic views to the coast. Having been advised that a state school built by the government would be unlikely, the residents decided to raise the funds locally to build a provisional school which could also be used as a public hall outside of school hours. A stump-capping ceremony was held on 8 October 1921. Flaxton Provisional School opened in February 1922. It closed in 1967. It was at 360-362 Flaxton Drive ().\nA fruit-packing shed which could process the district's entire harvest was opened 1931.  A sawmill operated for more than 20 years before being burned down in 1956.\nOn 21 March 1970, the Minister for Tourism, John Herbert, officially opened the Flaxton Model Village display which was built and operated by Mr and Mrs Malcolm Bradley. The model village had one-twelfth scale replicas of old English buildings, including a castle, water mill, church, market square etc. There were also life-sized replicas used as a theatre, cafe, and shop etc.\nDemographics\nIn the , Flaxton had a population of 931 people.\nIn the , Flaxton had a population of 992 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Flaxton.
