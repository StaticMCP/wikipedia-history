The awards were first introduced in 1968 and were initially titled the Program Excellence Awards. However, in 1977 the name was changed. The Iris Awards are the only national award meant to honor quality local television programming. From 1968 to 1997, the awards were presented at the annual NATPE Conference and Exhibition. After 1997, the awards were presented at a special ceremony in Los Angeles, California.\nNATPE’s Iris Awards were created to recognize executives, program producers, creators, talent, and importantly content that makes a significant impact on the industry and culture.\nSee also\n* List of American television awards\nReferences"
