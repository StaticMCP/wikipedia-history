The vote took place at the Chung-Shan Building in Yangmingshan, Taipei. Incumbent President Lee Teng-hui was elected, with Secretary-General to the President Lee Yuan-tsu as the Vice President. It was the last indirect presidential election in Taiwan.\nOverview\nIncumbent president Lee Teng-hui served as vice president under Chiang Ching-kuo before he succeeded Chiang, who died in office in 1988. After Chiang's death, the struggle between different factions in the Kuomintang surfaced for Chiang's successor. While Lee Teng-hui and Lee Yuan-tsu received nominations from the party in February 1990, a ticket of Lin Yang-kang and Chiang Wei-kuo was also pushed forward by the other factions until Lin decided not to run on March 9.\nThe main opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, launched a campaign for the direct election of the president, illegally nominating activist Huang Hua as their presidential candidate. The Wild Lily student movement led by National Taiwan University students also called for direct elections of the president and vice president and new popular elections for all representatives in the National Assembly. After the election, Lee abolished the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion and pushed for the full democratization.\nElectors\nThe election was conducted by the National Assembly in its meeting place Chung-Shan Building in Yangmingshan, Taipei.
