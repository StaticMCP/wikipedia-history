He is Emeritus Professor of Medieval History at Keele University and editor of The Cambridge History of Iran: The Timurid and Safavid Periods.\nHis main research interests are on the relations between the Mongols and the Latin West between 1220 and 1410, and he has written extensively on the topic, exploring the concepts of medieval Europe, the Crusades, medieval Russia and the Mongols, especially the clash of cultures, and the interconnectedness of legends such as that of Prester John.\nAcademic career\nGraduating from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1971, he was awarded a PhD from Cambridge in 1977 for the thesis \"The Mongols and India, 1221–1351\". In 1979 he was appointed lecturer in history at Keele University, becoming a senior lecturer in 1991. He was awarded a personal chair in medieval history in 2002.\nResearch\nHis 1999 book The Delhi Sultanate was described by a reviewer as amongst the most distinguished works on the medieval Islamic world in our time  and was scheduled for translation into Arabic. In this book, the geographical extent of his scholarship, his linguistic skills, and his extensive knowledge of medieval Islamic geography enabled him to compress into a single volume a nuanced assessment which was rooted in close textual analysis and a mastery of the linguistic problems presented by his sources, reminiscent of the research of Simon Digby. His latest book on the Mongols and the Islamic World has been described as a work of great erudition which demonstrates Peter Jackson's life-long understanding of both the Muslim and the European sources for the history of the Mongols.\nJackson also held a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship. In 2011 he retired as Professor Emeritus, and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2012.\nBooks\n* The Fall of the Ghurid Dynasty (chapter) in \"Studies in Honour of Clifford Edmund Bosworth, Volume II\", Brill 1998, .\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* From Genghis Khan to Tamerlane: The Reawakening of Mongol Asia. 2024.
