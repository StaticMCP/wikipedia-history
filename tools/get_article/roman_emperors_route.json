The project's name is derived from the fact that 17 Roman emperors were born within the current borders of Serbia, the second country after Italy itself. The sites include the important Roman cities of Sirmium, Felix Romuliana (which is a UNESCO World Heritage site) and Naissus. The project is regarded as one of the largest archeological and tourism projects in Serbia, and the project board is guided and financed by the Serbian Ministry of Economy and Regional Development and Ministry of Culture. It is regarded as one of the national brands of Serbia.\nSites\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|--\n!style=background:#FFDEAD;| Image\n!style=background:#FFDEAD;| Location\n!style=background:#FFDEAD;| Notes\n|-\n| || Sirmium || Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica, Vojvodina province, Serbia) was a city of ancient Roman Pannonia.
