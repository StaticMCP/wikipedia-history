He served in several conflicts, including the Spanish–American War and World War I, and he received the Army Distinguished Service Medal and numerous other awards for his role in them.\nMilitary career\nEly was born in Independence, Iowa, on November 23, 1867, the son of Eugene Hanson Ely and Julia Lamb Ely. After attending various local schools he entered the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York in 1887, from where he graduated from there over four years later. His classmates included Andrew Hero Jr., James Francis McIndoe, John W. Heavey, John Jewsbury Bradley and Edwin B. Winans, all future general officers. He was commissioned into the 22nd Infantry Regiment.\nAfter serving in Montana, North Dakota, and Nebraska, Ely became a professor of Military Science and Tactics at the University of Iowa, serving in this position from 1897 to 1898. During the Spanish–American War, Ely reported to his regiment at Camp Wikoff and then served in the Philippines from 1899 to 1901. In addition to commanding General Frederick Funston's mounted scouts, Ely served as a regimental and district adjutant in Luzon. He received his first Silver Star due to his efforts in the Philippines.\nEly graduated from the Infantry and Cavalry School in July 1905 and the Staff College in July 1906. He attended the German Army Maneuvers in 1906, and he again served in the Philippines from 1907 to 1912. Ely twice commanded Company K of the 26th Infantry.\nEly served with Funston on the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914. He graduated from a course at the United States Army War College in May 1916.\non Captain Howard R. MacAdams of the 5th Division's 7th Engineer Regiment, Esch, Luxembourg, December 30, 1918.]]\nFrom July 20 to August 24, 1917, Ely served as the Provost-marshal of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) of World War I. He commanded the 28th Infantry Regiment until his promotion to the rank of brigadier general in 1918, when he assumed command of the 3rd Brigade from Major General Edward Mann Lewis, who was promoted to command the 30th Division.\n, at the War Department, May 1927.

Ely, commandant of the Army War College.]]\nOn October 1, 1918, he was promoted to major general, even though his permanent rank was only lieutenant colonel. Starting on November 18, 1918, a week after the Armistice with Germany, Ely assumed command of the 2nd Division and then the 5th Division shortly afterwards. For his actions in the war, he received another Silver Star as well as the Distinguished Service Cross and the Army Distinguished Service Medal. He also received the Legion of Honour and five Croix de Guerres from the French.\nAfter returning to the U.S., Ely reverted to his permanent rank of lieutenant colonel on July 19, 1919. He was promoted to colonel on February 16, 1920, and graduated from a second course at the Army War College in July 1920. Promoted to brigadier general, Ely commanded the 3rd Brigade again from September 1920 to March 1921. He then served as the Commandant of the United States Army Command and General Staff College from August 1921 to 1923. After his permanent promotion to major general in 1923, Ely became the commandant of the Army War College, a position he served in until 1927. His last assignment was at Second Corps Area on Governors Island in New York.  In 1925, he published a report that was highly critical of black soldiers in World War I and recommended the army continue to keep them in segregated units.\nEly retired on November 10, 1931, after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64. He died on April 28, 1958, in Atlantic Beach, Florida. Ely is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n|-\n|-"
