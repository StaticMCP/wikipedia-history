Built in 1922, the school was made to accommodate all children grades 1 through 8 despite its small size. The then two room school was later rebuilt in 1975 and because of the population growth in Halifax, it is now only a primary school (Primary through the sixth grade). Classes in Rockingham are offered both in English and French.\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.rockingham.ednet.ns.ca/index%20pages/history.htm History of Rockingham]"
