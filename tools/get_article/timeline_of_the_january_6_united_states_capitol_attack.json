      "text": "# Timeline of the January 6 United States Capitol attack\n\nThe following article is a broad timeline of the course of events surrounding the attack on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, by rioters supporting United States President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol after assembling on the Ellipse of the Capitol complex for a rally headlined as the \"Save America March\".\nAt the rally, Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, and several Republican members of Congress addressed the crowd and repeated Donald Trump's false claims that electoral fraud affected the 2020 election outcome. In his hour-long speech, President Trump suggested marching towards the Capitol, assuring his audience he would be with them, to demand that Congress \"only count the electors who have been lawfully slated\", and \"peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\". Towards his conclusion, he said \"we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\nThe demonstrations turned violent with attendees breaching multiple police perimeters; assaulting Capitol police officers; and occupying, vandalizing, and ransacking parts of the building for several hours. Four people died that day: rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer; two died of heart conditions; another died of an amphetamine intoxication. The next day, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick died after suffering two strokes, having been physically attacked and pepper sprayed during the riot.\nAll times are specified or approximated in Eastern Time, or UTC-5:00.\nPreceding events\nJuly–October 2020\n* July 30: Trump casts skepticism on mail-in ballots at a press briefing. \"I don't want to see [a term like 'projected winner']...a week after November 3rd or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election,\" he says. He adds: \"I want an election and a result much, much more than you.\"\n* September 23: Asked at a press briefing if he'll commit to a peaceful transfer of power, Trump responds: \"The ballots are a disaster…Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very — we'll have a very peaceful — there won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control.\"\n* September 29: During a presidential debate, Trump orders members of the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by.\" This direction by the President is well-received by the Proud Boys, and white nationalist men begin to join in record numbers. Their membership will triple by January 6.\n* October 31: Steve Bannon explains to associates that Trump has a \"strategy\": \"What Trump's gonna do is just declare victory. Right? He's gonna declare victory. But that doesn't mean he's a winner. He's just gonna 'say' he's a winner.\"\nNovember 2020\n* November 3:\n** Election Day.3 in person or by mail, with the earliest state starting on September4.}}\n** On Election Night, 15–20 people in the White House move to the Green Room where Trump will wait for results. One of these people tells Trump loudly that the election was stolen. Others say: \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, just let's go out and say there's still time, we need to do this count, we'll see you in the morning\", as recalled by a guest in the residential part of the White House who spoke to investigators.\n* November 4:\n** Trump addresses supporters at the White House and references the ongoing count of ballots, alleging an attempt to \"disenfranchise\" people who voted for him. He declares: \"We won't stand for it ... We'll be going to the US Supreme Court; we want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at 4 in the morning, and add them to the list ... We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\"\n** A Trump campaign employee learns that the ongoing vote count at TCF Center in Detroit suggests that Biden has won that region. The campaign employee texts an attorney and suggests rioting at the center; around that time, Trump supporters approach the center, challenging the vote count, according to prosecutors in December 2023.\n* November 5:\n** Roger Stone dictates a message saying that \"any legislative body\" that has \"overwhelming evidence of fraud\" can choose their own electors to cast Electoral College votes.\n** Trump falsely claims that illegitimate ballots were dumped at a vote counting center in Detroit.\n* November 7:\n** The Associated Press, Fox News, and the other major networks call Pennsylvania for Biden, thus putting him above the required 270 electoral votes to be named President-elect.\n** Senior staffers on the Trump campaign tell Trump that unless the election results are flipped in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, an event they assign only a 5–10% chance, he has lost.\n** Kenneth Chesebro tweeted (through an anonymous Twitter account) that \"the big picture\" was that \"Trump doesn't have to get courts to declare him the winner of the vote. He just needs to convince Republican legislatures that the election was systematically rigged, but it's impossible to run it again, so they should appoint electors instead.\"\n* November 9:\n** Trump fires Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and replaces him with Christopher C. Miller as acting Secretary.\n** Oath Keepers member Jessica Watkins sends text messages inviting people to the Oath Keepers' basic training in Ohio. One message says, \"I need you fighting fit by innaugeration.\"\n* November 10: Reacting to the firings of Esper and other top officials, CIA Director Gina Haspel privately tells Chair of the Joint Chiefs Milley that \"we are on the way to a right-wing coup\".\n* November 13:\n** Trump's campaign manager tells him that a claim that many non-citizens have voted in Arizona is a false rumor.\n** Trump campaign attorneys concede in court that he did not win Arizona. This means he has lost the election for the presidency.\n* November 14:\n** Trump announces that he is putting Rudy Giuliani in charge of challenging the election results.\n** Over 10,000 people gather in Freedom Plaza for the Million MAGA March in support of Trump's election fraud claims. Speakers include Alex Jones and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump circles Freedom Plaza in his motorcade. Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters are in attendance. Proud Boys skirmish with counter-protesters throughout the day. At least 20 people are arrested and two D.C. police officers are injured.\n** That evening, Trump praises his supporters who fought with counter-protesters. Near midnight, a massive \"TRUMP LAW AND ORDER\" banner is laid atop Black Lives Matter Plaza, then moved close to the White House.\n* November 16:\n** Sidney Powell wrote that allegations against a voting machine company must be added to lawsuits in Georgia and Pennsylvania, alleging fraud that \"REQUIRES THE ENTIRE ELECTION TO BE SET ASIDE\".\n** In an internal communication with a Fox News producer, Tucker Carlson said he didn't believe the election fraud claims as presented by Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani. \"Sidney Powell is lying,\" Carlson said, calling her \"dangerous as hell\" and \"a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy.\" Three days later, he wrote in an article that \"we took Sidney Powell seriously... We've always respected her work and we simply wanted to see the details. ... So we invited Sidney Powell on the show. ... But she never sent us any evidence... When we checked with others around the Trump campaign ... they also told us Powell had never given them any evidence... We are certainly hopeful that she will [provide it].\" He added that \"this country will not be united\" until everyone agreed on whether fraud had occurred.\n* November 17: At a meeting of the Wayne County, Michigan, election board, canvassers Monica Palmer and William Hartmann initially refuse to certify Biden's victory, but faced with public opposition to their choice, they back down. At 9:53&nbsp;p.m. and 10:04&nbsp;p.m., with Trump on the line, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel calls Palmer's phone. Hartmann is also on the call. Trump tells the canvassers they'll look \"terrible\" if they certify the election results. McDaniel promises them: \"we will get you attorneys.\" (Palmer publicly acknowledges the call at the time, but the recording is not published until three years later.)\n* November 18:\n** Palmer and Hartmann try to take back their support for certification. Their request is denied.\n** Kenneth Chesebro sends his first memo on strategy.\n* November 21: Women for America First files a permit application for a rally at the Lincoln Memorial on December 12. The group's original application for a rally in Freedom Plaza was denied because of inauguration preparations.\n* November 22: Trump and Giuliani call the Arizona House Speaker and make false claims of election fraud.\n* November 23: White House Counsel Pat Cipollone tells U.S. attorney general Bill Barr that Trump wants to speak to him. It is the first time Barr has met face-to-face with Trump since the election. The U.S. Attorneys' Offices had searched for fraud for two weeks and found none. In the meeting, Trump maintains falsehoods about the election. Barr tells Trump that his claims of sweeping fraud are \"just not meritorious\" and \"not panning out.\" Barr reminds Trump that DOJ \"is not an extension of your legal team.\" After the meeting, Mark Meadows tells Barr that he believes Trump \"knows that there's a limit to how far he can take this.\" However, over the next week, Barr comes to believe that Trump is \"maneuvering\" in his meetings with state legislators. (Barr will have two more face-to-face meetings with Trump.)\n* November 25: Trump tweeted in favor of suing the governor of Georgia for election fraud, despite previously admitting in private that Powell sounded \"crazy\". Sidney Powell then filed the lawsuit.\nDecember 2020\n* December 1:\n** Giuliani meets with the Arizona House Speaker. Asked for evidence of election fraud, Giuliani says roughly: \"We don't have the evidence, but we have lots of theories.\"\n** U.S. attorney general Bill Barr says, in an interview published on this day by the Associated Press, that there is no evidence of election fraud on a scale that would change the election outcome. When Trump hears that Barr has publicly contradicted him, he is so angry that he throws his lunch at the wall, according to a White House aide's testimony to the January 6 house committee on June 28, 2022. Trump and Barr meet in person for the second time since the election. Trump \"was as mad as I've ever seen him,\" Barr later recalls. Barr offers to resign, and Trump accepts, but White House lawyers Pat Cipollone and Eric Herschmann follow Barr into the parking lot to persuade him otherwise. Barr ends up staying on for two more weeks.\n* December 2:\n** Facebook disbands its Civic Integrity team, including the Group Task Force, after employees' vocal internal complaints about lack of action leaked and caused embarrassment. This slows enforcement against Facebook Groups and users spreading election misinformation and calling for political violence. The company also drops other emergency measures put in place for the election season.\n** On Facebook, Trump posts his speech about election fraud.\n* December 3: Giuliani organized a presentation to the Georgia state senate, intending to persuade the senators to invalidate the real electors. Trump tweeted that it was \"blockbuster testimony\".\n* December 6: Kenneth Chesebro sends his second memo on strategy. In it, he explains the fake electors scheme to the Trump campaign. He acknowledges it is primarily a tactic to buy time to overturn the election in court, as the fake electors themselves would probably be overturned by the Supreme Court.\n* December 7:\n** The Arizona Republican Party asks supporters whether they are willing to give their lives fighting over the election results. Responding to Ali Alexander [@ali], who tweeted, \"I am willing to give my life for this fight.\"\n** Sidney Powell's lawsuit against Georgia was dismissed.\n** Rudy Giuliani attempts to send this text message: \"So I need you to pass a joint resolution from the legislature that states the election is in dispute, there's an ongoing investigation by the legislature, and the Electors sent by Governor Whitmer are not the official electors of the state of Michigan and do not fall within the Safe Harbor deadline under Michigan law.\" Because he had entered an incorrect number, the message did not send.\n* December 8:\n** Trump campaign lawyer Jack Wilenchik emailed Trump campaign strategist Boris Epshteyn to explain the fake electors scheme. Wilenchik wrote: \"We would just be sending in 'fake' electoral votes to Pence so that 'someone' in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the 'fake' votes should be counted.\" Wilenchik helped organize the fake electors from Arizona. In a later email, adding a smiley face emoji, Wilenchik acknowledged that the term \"alternative\" sounded better than \"fake.\"\n** Trump called the Georgia attorney general to pressure him.\n** One of Trump's senior campaign advisors expressed frustration that Giuliani's claims were unsubstantiated. \"[I]t's tough to own any of this\", he wrote in an email, \"when it's all just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership.\"\n** General Michael Flynn receives a presidential pardon. He would later participate in the D.C. events on January 5.\n* December 9: Kenneth Chesebro sends his third memo on strategy.\n* December 10: At a Georgia House hearing, Giuliani falsely accused Ruby Freeman and Wandrea' ArShaye Moss of misconduct.\n* December 12:\n** Proud Boys march through Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C., in advance of the pro-Trump rally scheduled later in the day.\n** Pro-Trump rallies in Washington, D.C., attract thousands of Trump supporters protesting the election results, including numerous Proud Boys. Speakers include Michael Flynn, Sebastian Gorka, Alex Jones, podcaster David Harris Jr., Nick Fuentes, Mike Lindell and Oath Keeper's leader Stewart Rhodes. Jones says, \"Joe Biden is a globalist, and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.\" Fuentes gets the crowd to chant, \"Destroy the GOP! Destroy the GOP!\" Flynn tells the crowd that he is certain that Trump will be the next President. Rhodes calls on Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, and warns that not doing so would lead to a \"much more bloody war.\" Trump flies over the crowd several times in Marine One and tweets his appreciation for their support.\n** Violent clashes throughout the day between Proud Boys and counter-protesters lead to 33 arrests, including for assault on a police officer. That night, Proud Boy members vandalize four churches and burn a Black Lives Matter banner.\n** Kenneth Chesebro proposes to Matt Morgan and Mike Roman that they add legal language to all seven fake elector certificates to protect the fake electors who are named there. Roman texts Chesebro: \"Fuck these guys.\" The language is added only to the certificates for Pennsylvania and New Mexico.\n* December 13: A political consultant joins a phone call with Rudy Giuliani and a senior campaign advisor for Trump. (This call is later mentioned in the 2023 indictment of Trump. A New York Times report tries to identify the unnamed consultant as Boris Epshteyn.) In late evening, Chesebro emails Rudy Giuliani and others with a proposal for Pence to recuse himself from certifying the election results. Saying he \"lost the several-page memo I had nearly finished due to a reboot on the hotel computer\" and does not want to waste more time, he briefly summarizes his proposal. (The U.S. House select committee on the January 6 attack will later conclude that Chesebro drafted this strategy \"upon request from Trump Campaign official Boris Epshteyn.\")\n* December 14:\n** Biden wins the Electoral College vote.\n** Trump electors for Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all of which Biden won in the election, cast purported electoral votes for Trump. The \"votes\" cast by the pro-Trump \"alternate electors\" have no legal standing. The pro-Trump groups in five states sent their fake electoral votes to the National Archives, but the National Archives did not forward these to Congress, because under the Electoral Count Act, only slates certified by the states are forward to Congress.\n** One America News releases a video about Trump's reelection efforts with a voiceover stating, \"Supporters of President Trump are continuing to fight for four more years, storming the nation's capital to participate in dueling rallies.\"\n** Attorney General William Barr tells Trump he will resign. It is their third and final face-to-face meeting since the election. Trump accepts his resignation, and it is publicly announced. Barr recommends, as his replacement, Jeffrey A. Rosen as Acting Attorney General and Richard Donoghue as deputy. Trump accepts these suggestions and begins to pressure Rosen and Donoghue to investigate the election.\n* December 15:\n** The Trump campaign mails a certificate with the names of the fake electors for Michigan. (Three weeks later, the post office tracking will continue to say \"in transit\".)\n** Trump summoned incoming acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and incoming acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, who explained to him that Giuliani's claims of fraud at the State Farm Arena in Georgia were false.\n* December 16: The national council of \"The Three Percenters – Original\" group, one of the largest Three Percenter militias, issues a statement alleging that \"there was widespread fraud perpetrated against the American people.\" The statement continues,\n** A luncheon at Trump International Hotel results in a draft Executive Order. The order would direct the Secretary of Defense to immediately seize voting machines and would establish Sidney Powell as a \"Special Counsel\" empowered to \"oversee this operation and institute all criminal and civil proceedings \".\n* December 17: Rep. Paul Gosar claims that Trump won Arizona because of the alleged data theft of 700,000 votes.\n* December 18:\n** Unscheduled meeting between Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn, and Patrick Byrne (\"outside group\") and Trump. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone joins immediately upon learning of it. The outside group advances Flynn's proposal that the president declare martial law and (according to Eric Herschmann's recollection) suggests that Venezuela meddled in the election. Trump, contrary to his advisors' opinions, suggests naming Powell as a special counsel to investigate alleged election fraud. The two camps are \"shouting at each other, throwing insults at each other\" (according to Derek Lyons, former White House staff secretary). The meeting shifts to Yellow Oval and breaks up after midnight. Mark Meadows escorts Giuliani so he won't \"wander back into the mansion\".\n** Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville put out a statement: \"There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of an American election.\" In response, Trump aide Jonny McEntee wrote a note: \"[Acting Defense Secretary] Chris Miller spoke to both of them and anticipates no more statements coming out. (If another happens, he will fire them).\" Though this note was torn up, the House select committee later recovered it.\n** To reserve a room for January 6, 2021 at Trump's D.C. hotel, customers will pay at least $476.\n* December 19:\n**1:42&nbsp;a.m. – Trump announces the January 6 rally on Twitter, stating: \"Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election.

Mo Brooks (R-Ala.),  Brooks told Politico there are plans to challenge the results in six states, said total debate time could clock in at around 18 hours. That means the vote-counting process could bleed into the wee hours of Jan. 7. Attendees include Vice President Mike Pence, Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl.), Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tx.) Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).\n* December 22:\n** Oath Keepers' Florida chapter leader Kelly Meggs writes on Facebook \"Trump said It's gonna be wild!!!!!!!\", adding \"It's gonna be wild!!!!!!!

He would later participate in the D.C. events of January 5.\n* December 23:\n** Phil Waldron texted Mark Meadows, informing him that an Arizona judge had dismissed a lawsuit in which GOP lawmakers demanded access to voting machines. Waldron acknowledged that his opponents might try to \"delay\" him from accessing the machines. Meadows replied: \"Pathetic\".\n** Roger Stone receives a presidential pardon. He would later participate in the DC events of January 5.\n** John Eastman wrote a memo on January 6 strategy proposing that \"Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected ...The main thing here is that Pence should do this without asking for permission...\" At 1:32&nbsp;p.m., Eastman emailed Trump's assistant asking to speak to the president about \"strategic thinking.\" Five minutes later, the White House called Eastman; the call lasted nearly 23 minutes.\n** Trump tweeted an allegation that Georgia officials were deliberately hiding evidence of fraud.\n* December 24: Pence wrote himself a note: \"Not feeling like I should attend electoral count. Too many questions, too many doubts, too hurtful to my friend [Trump]. Therefore I'm not going to participate in certification of election.\"\n* December 25: Pence called Trump to wish him a merry Christmas. Trump changed the subject, asking Pence to reject electoral votes on January 6, to which Pence objected. Pence admonished Trump: \"You know [that] I don't think I have the authority to change the [election] outcome\". (The line appeared in Pence's memoir with a comma after \"you know\", implying that the phrase was merely conversational; Pence told prosecutors that the comma should not have been printed.)\n* December 27:\n** In a phone call, discussing the allegations about State Farm Arena in Georgia, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue remind Trump that \"DOJ can't and won't snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election.\" They say they have reviewed video and interviewed witnesses, yet there is no evidence of fraud. Trump replies: \"Just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the R[epublican] Congressmen\".\n** President Trump promotes the January 6 rally on Twitter.\n* December 28:\n** Jeffrey Clark drafts a letter to Georgia's governor and leaders of the Georgia House and Senate. The letter asks the Georgia General Assembly to call a \"special session\" to consider claims of election irregularities, decide who \"won the most legal votes,\" and \"take whatever action is necessary to ensure that one of the slates of Electors cast on December 14 will be accepted by Congress on January 6.\" Pat Cipollone warns Trump that the letter will \"damage everyone who touches it. And we should have nothing to do with that letter.\" Rosen and Donoghue refuse to sign the letter, and it is not sent. (It is later mentioned in ethics charges filed against Clark on July 19, 2022.)\n* December 30:\n** President Trump again announces the date of the January 6 rally on Twitter.\n** The domain name MarchtoSaveAmerica.com is registered.\n** A popular far-right YouTuber posted a video in which he said he anticipated over a million \"armed Americans\" would be in the streets for a \"red wedding\" on January 6, a reference to a fictional massacre in Game of Thrones.\n** Senator Mike Lee texts Trump advisor Cleta Mitchell, opposing the January 6 plan as \"a dangerous idea ... for the republic itself … [w]ill you please explain to me how this doesn't create a slippery slope problem for all future presidential elections?\"\n* December 31:\n** By this date, the wildprotest.com website settles on a protest location just northeast of the Capitol building. On New Year's Eve, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser requests a limited national guard deployment as downtown merchants began boarding up their businesses.\n** The Berkeley Research Group, hired by the Trump campaign to investigate whether there had been voter fraud, had found nothing, and at some point during the last few days of December, they reported this to Trump and Meadows on a conference call.\n** Trump signs his fraud allegations in his lawsuit against Georgia, and Eastman helps him file it, even though Eastman acknowledges in an email that Trump knows some of these allegations are false.\n** To reserve a room for January 6, 2021 at Trump's D.C. hotel, customers are shown a price of $8,000.\nFriday, January 1, 2021\n* National Park Service grants a permit for a First Amendment rally \"March for Trump\" at The Ellipse to Women for America First (chaired by Amy Kremer, co-founder of Women for Trump), with an estimated attendance of 5,000.\n* Trump tweets the date and time of the January 6 rally.

The permit notes that there is no march associated with the event.\n* In a heated Oval Office meeting, Trump pushes his plan to install Jeffrey Clark as head of DOJ. (Clark, the top energy lawyer at DOJ, supports Trump's claims of election fraud.) Officials from the DOJ and White House tell Trump they do not support this plan, and some issue ultimatums: Acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen, his deputy Richard Donoghue, and Office of Legal Counsel head Steven Engel all threaten to resign if Trump installs Clark.\n* Clark discusses the scheme with deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin. Philbin warns him that Trump can't simply seize power, as Americans will riot. Clark replies that the Insurrection Act could be used to quell the protests.\n* Pence asked the Senate parliamentarian if there were any other electors whose votes he should consider during the certification. (In August 2023, Pence told NBC that he asked her this because he had heard \"rumors...in the newspaper\" of alternate electors and that he \"doesn't recall\" if the White House had directly informed him of the scheme.)\nMonday, January 4, 2021\n* In the morning, John Eastman calls the Arizona House Speaker, admitting he's unfamiliar with the local \"facts on the ground\" yet urging the Arizona House Speaker to use the state legislature to decertify the real electors and \"let the courts sort it out.\"\n* USCP COP Sund asks Senate Sergeant at Arms (SSAA) Michael Stenger and House Sergeant at Arms (HSAA) Paul Irving for authority to have National Guard to assist with security for the January 6, 2021, event based on briefing with law enforcement partners and revised intelligence\n* COP Sund's request is denied.

Troops would need to be sworn in as USCP.\n* Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio is arrested in D.C. and charged for burning a Black Lives Matter banner on December 12 and possession of two high capacity firearm magazines that were in his possession at the time of his arrest.\n*\n* Rally organizer Kylie Kremer (daughter of Amy Kremer) texted MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell: \"This stays only between us, we are having a second stage at the Supreme Court again after the ellipse. POTUS is going to have us march there/the Capitol. It cannot get out about the second stage because people will try and set up another and Sabotage it. It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but the POTUS is going to just call for it 'unexpectedly.' If anyone tells you otherwise, it's not accurate info. Only myself and [name of White House liaison, redacted by Inspector General for the Interior Department] know full story of what is actually happening and we are having to appease many people by saying certain things.\"\n* The National Park Service forecast the protest crowd size at 15,000. (Nearly three years later, the Interior Department's Inspector General concluded that Kylie Kremer's group Women for America First had lied to NPS, falsely claiming there would be no march. The Inspector General also concluded that NPS failed to inspect the site, keep photographs documenting what the site originally looked like before the demonstration, advise that backpacks and bags were prohibited, and review WFAF's safety documentation.)\n* 1:41 p.m.: Mickael Damelincourt, managing director of Trump's D.C. hotel, tweets: \"Looking forward to seeing many of you this week…\"\n* 3:30&nbsp;p.m.: Trump campaign lawyer Matt Morgan emails Kenneth Chesebro to ask if Congress has received all the documents for the slates of fake electors. Chesebro replies that he should ask campaign official Mike Roman. At 4:55, Morgan resends the inquiry to Chesebro and Roman. Roman replies that the Michigan document has not arrived yet and that he plans to use a \"courier tomorrow\". Morgan replies at 8:41 that they may \"need to enlist the help of a legislator who can deliver to the appropriate place(s)\" and that they should discuss it with Rudy Giuliani \"to make sure this gets done the way he wants.\" Chesebro tells Roman to \"write Jim Troupis and have him check immediately with [Senator] Ron Johnson\" whether a courier may give the documents to a Johnson staffer who can give them to Pence. At 11:29, Roman tells them that a staffer in Wisconsin should take a morning flight from Chicago to Washington. Roman offers to go to the Washington airport to receive the documents from the courier and bring them to a Johnson staffer; Chesebro replies that he can do this. He advises not to \"wait until morning of 6th\". At 11:49, Roman updates Chesebro: \"You need Michigan and Wisconsin. So you'll be picking up 2\". At 11:54, he adds that Chesebro will need to take them to \"2 separate people.\"\n* Pence took notes at a meeting, recording that Trump repeated false claims such as that he \"won every state by 100,000 of votes\" and that there were \"205,000 votes more in PA than voters.\" These notes were revealed in the federal indictment of Trump.\n* Representative Liz Cheney is accidentally included on a call between Trump's allies, and she listens as they plot to convince Pence to obstruct or delay the vote count.\nTuesday, January 5, 2021\n* Shortly after midnight, former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan texts Liz Cheney: \"I worry he [Pence] breaks but think he will not.\"\n* 8:57&nbsp;a.m.: Steve Bannon calls Trump. They speak for 11 minutes.\n* After the phone call, Bannon addresses his podcast audience: \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. We're on ... the point of attack ... strap in.\"\n* Anika Collier Navaroli, a member of Twitter's safety team, says on an internal call: \"I am very concerned about what happens tomorrow, especially given what we have been seeing. For months we have been allowing folks to maintain and say on the platform that they're locked and loaded, that they're ready to shoot people, that they're ready to commit violence.\" (She later testifies that Twitter was reluctant to suspend Trump because he was one of their most powerful and popular users.)\n* After 10 a.m. in Washington, a Wisconsin GOP official lands with the fake elector documents for that state. Around 1 p.m., Trump campaign aide Michael Brown (whose flight has been booked and paid for by the Trump campaign) lands with the Michigan certificates. Both individuals are scheduled to go to the Trump International Hotel in Washington to give the documents to Chesebro. Chesebro and Brown together walk to the Longworth Office Building and hand off the documents to a staffer for a Pennsylvania GOP lawmaker (either for Rep. Scott Perry or Rep. Mike Kelly).\n* In the morning, thousands of Trump supporters gather at Freedom Plaza near the White House in advance of planned protests against the certification of Joe Biden as President-elect. The first rally is the March to Save America from 1–2 p.m., then Stop the Steal from 3:30–5:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by the Eighty Percent Coalition from 5:00–8:30&nbsp;p.m.\n* Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund holds a teleconference with top law enforcement and military officials from D.C., including the FBI, U.S. Secret Service and the National Guard; Sund later wrote no entity provided any intelligence indicating that there would be a coordinated violent attack on the United States Capitol by thousands of well-equipped armed insurrectionists.\n* U.S. House Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) holds a teleconference with Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund and House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving; Sund tells Lofgren that the National Guard is on standby and that Capitol Police are well-staffed and prepared for the protests.\n* After speaking with Representative Lofgren, Sund reiterates to Representative Tim Ryan (D-OH) that Capitol Police are prepared.\n* D.C. National Guard Commanding Major General William J. Walker receives new orders from Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy stating that he must seek approval from McCarthy and Defense secretary Miller before preparing to respond to a civil disturbance.

It said: \"On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all – in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence. 'No legislative act,' wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78, 'contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.' The court in Hubbard v. Lowe reinforced this truth: 'That an unconstitutional statute is not a law at all is a proposition no longer open to discussion.' 226 F. 135, 137 (SDNY 1915), appeal dismissed, 242 U.S. 654 (1916). Following this rationale, an unconstitutionally appointed elector, like an unconstitutionally enacted statute, is no elector at all.\"\n* Pipe bombs were placed outside the Washington, D.C., offices of the RNC and DNC national headquarters between 7:30–8:30&nbsp;p.m., according to the FBI. The bombs were found the next day. Surveillance video shows a suspect who, , remained unidentified.\n* Trump made several calls to his associates at the Willard Hotel, where a command center or \"war room\" had been established in a set of rooms and suites. Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Bannon, Eastman, and Boris Epshteyn led the team. Michael Flynn, Roger Stone and Bernard Kerik were also present. Trump called to tell them that Pence was refusing the Pence Card strategy that Eastman had proposed earlier in the day in an Oval Office meeting. He discussed ways to delay the certification in order to get alternate slates of electors for Trump sent to Congress, as he, Giuliani and Eastman had discussed by conference call with 300 state legislators on January 2. Trump discussed some topics only with lawyers at the Willard so as to preserve the confidentiality afforded by attorney-client privilege.\n* 9:46&nbsp;p.m.: Steve Bannon calls Trump. They speak for 6 minutes.\n* 10:00&nbsp;p.m.: Kayleigh McEnany texts Elliot Gaiser at approximately this time, asking him whether Pence has the power to object to the election results. She later told the January 6th committee that she was curious about this possibility because, earlier that day or the day before, she had overheard Trump discussing it in the Oval Office with an outside attorney (whom she believed was John Eastman) on speakerphone, while Corey Lewandowski listened in person in the Oval Office.\nAttack on the Capitol\nAt noon, Trump began an over one-hour speech at the Ellipse, encouraging protesters to march to the U.S. Capitol. At 12:49&nbsp;p.m., Capitol Police responded to reports of an explosive device, later identified as a pipe bomb. At 12:53&nbsp;p.m., eighteen minutes before Trump's speech ended, rioters overran police on the west perimeter of restricted Capitol grounds. At 2:13&nbsp;p.m., rioters first gained entry to the interior of the Capitol after smashing windows on the Senate wing near S139.\nAt 2:44&nbsp;p.m., a Capitol Police officer inside the Speaker's Lobby adjacent to the House chambers shot and killed rioter Ashli Babbitt as she climbed through a broken window of a barricaded door. Minutes later, Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam activated all available assets of the State of Virginia including the Virginia National Guard to aid the U.S. Capitol, although the Department of Defense still had not authorized it. By 3:15&nbsp;p.m., assets from Virginia began rolling into D.C.\nAn hour later, at 4:17 p.m, a video of Trump was uploaded to Twitter in which he instructed \"you have to go home now.\" Fifteen minutes later, Secretary Miller authorized the D.C. National Guard to actually deploy.\nWednesday, January 6, 2021\nEarly morning (before 9:00 a.m.)\n* 1:00&nbsp;a.m.: Trump tweets: \"If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency.\"\n* 1:13a.m.: Ali Alexander, Stop the Steal organizer, tweets \"First official day of the rebellion.\"\n* 3:23a.m.: Ron Watkins, imageboard administrator and prominent QAnon figure, posts a tweet accusing Vice President Mike Pence of orchestrating a coup against Trump.

According to Newsweek, \"Six times as many protestors—as many as 120,000—would show up on the Mall on January 6, according to classified numbers still not released by the Secret Service and the FBI but seen by Newsweek.\"\n* 9:52&nbsp;a.m.: Trump has a 26-minute phone call with speechwriter Stephen Miller about his planned speech for the Save America Rally later that day.\n10:00 a.m.\n* 10:00&nbsp;a.m.: Before this time, White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato informs Trump that authorities have spotted armed individuals at the crowd gathering at the Ellipse. Ornato explained to Trump that some of his supporters \"have weapons that they don't want confiscated by the Secret Service\" and thus they refused to pass through the magnetometers and had not drawn close to the Ellipse where Trump was scheduled to speak at 11&nbsp;a.m.\n* 10:15&nbsp;a.m.: Around this time, Tony Ornato, along with Cassidy Hutchinson, who was an aide to Mark Meadows, inform Meadows about the armed Trump supporters.\n* 10:30a.m.: Benjamin Philips splits from his group to park, not reuniting but later dying from a stroke at George Washington University Hospital.\n* 10:30a.m.: 200–300 Proud Boys started their march down the National Mall towards the U.S. Capitol.\n* 10:47a.m.: Rudy Giuliani begins a speech in which he calls for \"trial by combat\".\n* 10:58a.m.: A Proud Boys contingent leaves the rally and marches toward the Capitol Building. (According to later testimony, a \"couple of hundred\" Proud Boys began walking east, \"down the Mall...towards the Capitol\" at approximately 10:30&nbsp;a.m.)\n11:00 a.m.\n* 11:00a.m.: The Ellipse, located south of the White House, is filled with Trump supporters.\n* 11:06&nbsp;a.m.: \"There is no official record of President Trump receiving or placing a call between 11:06 a.m. and 6:54 p.m.,\" Representative Elaine Luria stated at a public hearing a year later. (The start time of the absence has also been reported as 11:17&nbsp;a.m.) However, still later, prosecutors said they had obtained data from a cell phone Trump was using on the day of the attack, including when he was using Twitter and what other websites he visited.\n* 11:23&nbsp;a.m.: According to the final report of the House committee: \"Three men in fatigues from Broward County, Florida brandished AR-15s in front of MPD officers on 14th Street and Independence Avenue. MPD advised over the radio that one individual was possibly armed with a 'Glock' at Fourteenth Street and Constitution Avenue, and another was possibly armed with a 'rifle' at Fifteenth Street and Constitution Avenue around 11:23 a.m.\"\n* 11:30a.m.:\n** Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher C. Miller participates in a tabletop exercise on Department of Defense contingency response options for the D.C. protests.\n** The motorcade of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris arrives at DNC headquarters, passing through its garage.

That was because about half of his 53,000 supporters refused to be screened for weapons by passing through the magnetometers and thus had not entered the area. Trump yelled (as Cassidy Hutchinson would later testify): \"I don't [fucking] care that they have weapons. They're not here to hurt me. Take the [fucking] mags away. Let my people in. They can march to the Capitol from here. Take the [fucking] mags away.\"\n* 11:57&nbsp;a.m.: President Trump begins his over one-hour speech. He repeats allegations that the election was stolen, criticizes Vice President Mike Pence by name a half-dozen times (though this wasn't part of his prepared remarks), accuses fellow Republicans of not doing enough to back up his allegations, and states that he will walk with the crowd to the Capitol.\neast of the Capitol makes the White power gesture at 11:54a.m.]]\n12:00p.m.\n* 12:00p.m.:\n** A Federal Protective Service briefing email reports that about 300 Proud Boys are at the Capitol, a man in a tree near the Ellipse is holding what looks like a rifle, and some of the 25,000 people around the White House are hiding bags in bushes.

This threw Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards backwards; she was briefly knocked unconscious. Some protesters immediately follow toward the Capitol, while others, at least initially, remain behind and admonish the others: \"Don't do it. You're breaking the law.\"\n* 12:57p.m.: Federal Protective Service officers report that the Capitol Police barricade on the west side of the Capitol building has been breached by a large group.

Irving and Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael C. Stenger to declare an emergency and call for deployment of the National Guard. Irving and Stenger state that they will forward the request up their chains of command. Soon afterwards, aides to Congressional leaders arrive in Stenger's office and are outraged to learn that he has not yet called for any reinforcement. Phone records obtained at the Senate Hearings reflect that Sund first reached out to Irving to request the National Guard at 12:58&nbsp;p.m. on the day of the attack. Sund then called the Senate sergeant-at-arms at the time, Michael Stenger, at 1:05&nbsp;p.m. Sund repeated his request in a call at 1:28&nbsp;p.m. and then again at 1:34&nbsp;p.m., 1:39&nbsp;p.m. and 1:45&nbsp;p.m. that day.

As Trump later recalled for journalist Jonathan Karl: \"I was going to [go to the Capitol] and then the Secret Service said, 'You can't.'\" The Secret Service drives him back to the White House against his wishes. Upon being denied transportation to the Capitol, Trump behaved angrily, according to multiple witnesses who testified for the House committee. However, according to the driver (in his testimony nearly two years later), Trump \"never grabbed the steering wheel. I didn't see him, you know, lunge to try to get into the front seat at all.\"\n* 1:19&nbsp;p.m.: Trump's motorcade arrives at the White House.\n* 1:21&nbsp;p.m.:\n** Trump enters the White House.\n** \"The Presidential Daily Diary...contains no information for the period between 1:21 p.m. and 4:03 p.m.,\" Rep. Elaine Luria stated at a public hearing a year later. \"The chief White House photographer wanted to take pictures because it was, in her words, 'very important for his archives and for history.' But she was told, 'no photographs.'\"\nTrump watches TV (1:25–4:03 p.m.)\nA White House employee breaks the news to Trump that a TV network did not broadcast the entirety of his speech in favor of footage of the Capitol riot. When the employee tells him (roughly) \"they're rioting down there at the Capitol,\" Trump says (roughly) \"Oh, really?\" and asks to see it on TV. As they walk to the Oval Dining Room, the employee takes off Trump's \"outer coat,\" brings the TV into the dining room, rewinds it to the beginning of Trump's speech rather than the live coverage, and hands Trump the remote. The employee leaves briefly and returns with a Diet Coke, at which time Trump is still watching the TV coverage. (As told by the White House employee when interviewed by the January 6 House select committee.)\nAccording to the final report of the January 6 House select committee:\"Here's what President Trump did during the 187 minutes between the end of his speech and when he finally told rioters to go home: For hours, he watched the attack from his TV screen. His channel of choice was Fox News. He issued a few tweets, some on his own inclination and some only at the repeated behest of his daughter and other trusted advisors. He made several phone calls, some to his personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, some to Members of Congress about continuing their objections to the electoral certification, even though the attack was well underway.\nHere's what President Trump did not do: He did not call any relevant law enforcement agency to ensure they were working to quell the violence. He did not call the Secretary of Defense; he did not call the Attorney General; he did not call the Secretary of Homeland Security. And for hours on end, he refused the repeated requests—from nearly everyone who talked to him—to simply tell the mob to go home.\"Trump's aides confirmed that he watched the television coverage, but Trump himself has refused to admit doing so. Two months after the attack on the Capitol, he told journalist Jonathan Karl: \"When I get back [to the White House], I saw—I wanted to go back [to the Capitol]. I was thinking about going back during the problem to stop the problem, doing it myself. Secret Service didn't like that idea too much.\"\n* 1:25&nbsp;p.m.:\n** Trump enters the Oval Office private dining room and stays there, watching Fox News, until after 4 p.m. (Three months later, Trump acknowledged to a journalist that the Capitol police \"did lose control\" of the mob, but he claimed he did not hear of the attack while in meetings with his chief of staff and instead learned of it \"afterwards, and ... on the late side\" upon turning on the television.)\n** White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham texts First Lady Melania Trump: \"Do you want to tweet that peaceful protests are the right of every American, but there is no place for lawlessness and violence?\" She immediately responds: \"No\". (Melania Trump didn't tweet at all on the day of the attack, and did not tweet to condemn the violence until five days later.)\n* 1:26p.m.: U.S. Capitol Police order evacuation of at least two buildings in the Capitol complex, including the Cannon House Office Building and the Madison Building of the Library of Congress.\n* 1:30p.m.:\n** Capitol Police are overwhelmed and retreat up the steps of the Capitol.

The official who wrote this, when later interviewed by the January 6 House committee, explained the second comment: \"The members of the VP detail at this time were starting to fear for their own lives...we came very close to either Service having to use lethal options or worse....they're screaming and saying things like 'say goodbye to the family'.\" (The committee did not reveal the official's name.)\n** Cassidy Hutchinson overhears Trump repeatedly use the word \"hang\" in a conversation with Mark Meadows prior to his tweet about Pence.\n** President Trump tweets \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\" When Twitter reinstated Trump's account in November 2022, this tweet was gone. The U.S. House select committee investigating January 6 wrote that this tweet \"inflamed and exacerbated the mob violence\"; this assessment was part of the committee's criminal referral of Trump for insurrection. Similarly, the committee wrote in its final report: \"Immediately after this tweet, the crowds both inside and outside of the Capitol building violently surged forward. Outside the building, within ten minutes thousands of rioters overran the line on the west side of the Capitol that was being held by the Metropolitan Police Force's Civil Disturbance Unit, the first time in history of the DC Metro Police that such a security line had ever been broken.\" Within an hour after this tweet, Pat Cipollone complained to Mark Meadows that \"we need to do something more. They're literally calling for the Vice President to be [fucking] hung.\" Meadows suggested that there was nothing to do, given that Trump \"thinks Mike deserves it.\" At some point, Nick Luna, an aide, comes into the dining room and informs Trump that Pence has been moved for his safety. Luna later tells the House select committee that he did not recall how Trump responded, and he tells federal investigators that Trump responded: \"So what?\"\n* 2:25p.m.:\n** Army Secretary McCarthy ordered staff to prepare movement of the emergency reaction force, which could be ready in 20 minutes, to the Capitol.\n** Over the next three minutes, \"rioters breached the East Rotunda doors, other rioters breached the police line in the Capitol Crypt, Vice President Pence had to be evacuated from his Senate office, and Rep.

Gen. Walker. As the DCNG does not report to a governor, but to the President, Maj. Gen. Walker patched in the Office of the Secretary of the Army, noting that he would need Pentagon authorization to deploy. Lt. Gen. Walter E. Piatt, director of the Army Staff, noted that the Pentagon needed Capitol Police authorization to step onto Capitol grounds. Sund began describing the breach by rioters but the call became unintelligible as multiple people began asking questions at the same time. Metro Police Chief Robert Contee asked for clarification from Capitol Police Chief Sund: \"Steve, are you requesting National Guard assistance at the Capitol?\" to which Chief Sund replied, \"I am making urgent, urgent, immediate request for National Guard assistance.\" According to Sund, Lt. Gen. Piatt said, \"I don't like the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background\", and that he prefer that the Guard relieve police posts around D.C. to allow police to deploy to the Capitol. Sund pleaded with Lt. Gen. Piatt to send the Guard, but Lt. Gen. Piatt said only Army Secretary McCarthy had the authority to approve such a request and he could not recommend that Secretary McCarthy approve the request for assistance directly to the Capitol. The D.C. officials were subsequently described as \"flabbergasted\" at this message. McCarthy would later state that he was not in this conference call because he was already entering a meeting with senior Department leadership. Piatt contests this description of the call, denying that he talked about visuals and stating that he stayed on the conference call while senior Defense Department officials were meeting. The Army falsely denied for two weeks that Lt. Gen. Charles A. Flynn—the Army deputy chief of staff for operations, plans and training—was in this call. His brother Michael Flynn, a retired Trump National Security Advisor, had pledged an oath to the QAnon conspiracy theory, though there are no indications that Lt. Gen. Flynn shares his brother's beliefs.\n* 2:26p.m.:\n** Trump calls Senator Mike Lee (R–UT), having misdialed Senator Tommy Tuberville (R–AL).

Did we go back into session?\" Someone replies: \"We did go back into session, but now apparently everybody on the floor is putting on tear gas masks to prepare for a breach.\" Pelosi, seeming not to have understood a key phrase, asks the person to repeat it. The person reiterates: \"Tear gas masks.\" Pelosi turns and says to someone else: \"Do you believe this?\"\n** Capitol Police radio: \"We need an area for the House members.

Fear of being removed from power by the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was one motivation for Trump to seek the \"cover\" of this speech, according to Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony before the January 6 house committee. He made \"multiple stops and starts\", requesting Diet Cokes during the recording, in contrast to his usual method of \"one or two takes, call it a day\", White House chief photographer Shealah Craighead testified to the House committee.
