The opposition, who had demanded the elections be postponed, and planned to boycott them (but reversed their decision a few hours before voting began), described the result as illegal. Foreign observers were also critical of the elections, particularly regarding the issues of candidate registration, media access and voting irregularities, including multiple voting.\nTurnout was reported to be 99% of the 2,866,578 registered voters.\nResults\nReferences"
