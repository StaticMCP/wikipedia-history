For 78 consecutive years (from 1935 until 2013), the ward was represented by a succession of five members of the Cullerton family. The Cullerton family have been prominent in Chicago and Illinois politics for decades, beginning with Edward Cullerton who held seats on the council for 48 years during the 19th and 20th centuries. His tenure combined with the 38th ward Cullerton aldermen mean that the family held seats on the council for a period of 126 years. The first Cullerton to represent the 78th ward was P. J. Cullerton, the grandnephew of Edward Cullerton. He established a long-lasting political partnership between the Cullertons and the Daley family. When he left the council to become Cook County assessor, Mayor Richard J. Daley appointed his brother, William J. Cullerton, to the seat. After William J. Cullerton died in office, Daley appointed his son Thomas W. Cullerton to the seat. After Thomas W. Cullerton died in office, Mayor Richard M. Daley (son of the elder Daley) appointed his son-in-law Thomas R. Allen to the seat. After Allen left the council to take a judgeship on the Circuit Court of Cook County, the younger Daley appointed Timothy Cullerton (son of Thomas W. Cullerton, and brother-in-law of Allen) to the seat. Cullerton retired in 2013, and Nicholas Sposato became the first alderman from the ward since 1935 not to be a member of the Cullerton family.\nLocation\nThe ward represents the northwest side of Chicago.\nAlderpersons\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"|Alderperson\n!scope=\"col\"|Term in office\n!scope=\"col\"|Party\n!scope=\"col\"|Notes\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|1\n|\n|bgcolor=\"\" |&nbsp;\n!scope=\"row\"|Max Adamowski\n|&ndash;July 16, 1929\n|Democratic\n|prior to 1923, had represented the 22nd ward since 1916; died in office\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|2\n|\n|bgcolor=\"\" |&nbsp;\n!scope=\"row\"|Frank H.
