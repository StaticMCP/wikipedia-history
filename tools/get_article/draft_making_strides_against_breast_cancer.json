The events are held annually in communities across the United States, typically during October, which is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\nHistory\nThe first Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk took place in 1993 in Boston, Massachusetts. What began as a local fundraiser has since grown into a nationwide movement. Today, hundreds of walks are held each year across the country, drawing participation from survivors, caregivers, volunteers, and corporate teams.\nPurpose and Mission\nThe primary goals of Making Strides Against Breast Cancer are to:\n* Raise awareness about breast cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.\n* Generate funds to support the American Cancer Society’s breast cancer research and programs.\n* Provide a space for communities to honor survivors, remember those lost, and take collective action toward ending breast cancer.\nFundraising and Impact\nParticipants raise money individually or as part of a team. Funds support:\n* Breast cancer research funded by the ACS.\n* Free patient services such as a 24/7 cancer helpline, transportation, and lodging for treatment.\n* Advocacy efforts to improve access to healthcare and promote public policies supporting patients and survivors.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, Making Strides events have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars since the program’s inception.\nEvent Format\nMaking Strides walks are typically 3–5 miles in length and are open to participants of all ages. Unlike competitive races, these walks emphasize community engagement, support, and awareness. Many events feature survivor celebrations, live entertainment, educational booths, and “Survivor Villages.”\nNational Partnerships\nThe American Cancer Society partners with corporations, media outlets, and local sponsors to expand the reach and impact of Making Strides. Some events recognize top fundraisers, known as \"Pacesetters,\" and feature local dignitaries or survivor speakers.\nSee also\n* American Cancer Society\n* Relay For Life\n* Breast Cancer Awareness Month\nReferences"
