These include individual honor awards, unit honor awards, service awards, training ribbons and qualification insignia. NOAA Corps awards and decorations include:\nNOAA Corps Insignia\nCommand insignia\nThere are three NOAA Command insignia: NOAA Command-at-Sea, NOAA Small-Craft-Command, and NOAA Chief-of-Party.\n* NOAA Command-at-Sea Insignia is a gold-colored pin consisting of a triangle superimposed on anchor flukes and an unfurled commissioning pennant showing six triangles.  The NOAA Command-at-Sea insignia is authorized for incumbents serving under orders designating them in command of Class 1 through Class 5 NOAA commissioned vessels.  A NOAA Corps officer who previously successfully held command (but is not currently in command) of a NOAA commissioned vessel for at least six months during which the vessel was engaged for at least four months in operations at sea, is authorized to wear the Command-at-Sea insignia.\n* NOAA Small-Craft-Command Insignia is a bronze-colored insignia, of the same design and sizes as the Command-at-Sea insignia.  NOAA Corps officers not qualifying for the Command-at-Sea insignia but serving under orders designating them as officer-in-charge or in command of NOAA vessels, greater than 50 feet in length up through Class 6, may wear the Small-Craft-Command insignia.  An officer must have been in charge of or held command for at least six months during which the vessel spent four months in field operations, may wear the Small-Craft-Command insignia.  This insignia is not worn when the Command-at-Sea insignia is authorized.\n* NOAA Chief-of-Party Insignia is a gold-colored pin consisting of a raised equilateral triangle.  NOAA Chief-of-Party Insignia is authorized for incumbents serving in assignments designating them as Chief-of-Party or equivalent.  A NOAA Corps officer who has previously served in an assignment as Chief-of-Party, or equivalent, for at least six months during which the unit was engaged for at least four months in field operations may wear the Chief-of-Party insignia.\nFor each of the three Command insignia, eligibility to wear them is not attained by a NOAA Corps officer being temporarily or acting in command due to absence, illness or transfer of the designated commanding officer, for periods of less than six continuous months.\nAn incumbent officer wears insignia centered 1/4&nbsp;inch above the right breast pocket or pocket flap.  When a name tag or ribbon bars are worn on the right breast, the insignia is centered 1/4&nbsp;inch above them.

Only one post-tour command insignia may be worn; the choice of insignia is at the individual's discretion.  When wearing two qualification insignia, the command insignia is worn 1/4&nbsp;inch below the secondary insignia, or on uniforms with pocket flaps, 1/4&nbsp;inch below the flap.\nQualification insignia\nNOAA Corps officers who have qualified as aviators, divers, submariners, parachutists, &c., or are otherwise entitled to wear a qualification insignia at their discretion.

NOAA Corps officers qualified as NOAA divers may wear the NOAA diver insignia after authorization by the Director of the NOAA Corps.\nNOAA Corps officers with multiple qualifications may wear two insignia, placing one in the primary position and one in the secondary position.  Only one insignia from any qualification category (i.e., diver, aviator, etc.) is authorized for wear at the same time.\nWhen wearing the insignia with ribbon bars or medals, the primary insignia is centered above ribbon bars or medals with the lower edge of the device 1/4-inch above the top row of ribbon bars or medals.  The secondary insignia is centered below ribbon bars with the top of the device 1/4&nbsp;inch below the top of the pocket or pocket flap, or centered below medals with the top of the device 1/4&nbsp;inch below the lowest row of medals.\nWithout ribbon bars or medals, the primary insignia is centered above the left pocket with the lower edge of the device 1/4&nbsp;inch above the top of the pocket.

Like NOAA Corps personnel today, Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officers, as well as other Coast and Geodetic Survey personnel such as civilian ship's officers and crew members, were eligible for the Department of Commerce awards described above, as well as awards such as the above-mentioned Colbert and Karo Medals and the awards and decorations of other uniformed services with which they served. However, although the Coast and Geodetic Survey traced its history to 1807, it had no awards of its own until 21 July 1945, when President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9590, authorizing six awards in recognition of Coast and Geodetic Survey service during World War II, the national emergency preceding it, or its aftermath.\nFor budgetary reasons, Executive Order 9590 established the awards as ribbons only, but it also authorized the United States Secretary of Commerce to \"provide and issue an appropriate medal, with suitable appurtenances, to the recipient of any ribbon at such time as he may determine, and when necessary funds are available therefore.\" However, it was not until after the United States Congress passed the Merchant Marine Decorations and Medals Act in 1988 that NOAA, as the Coast and Geodetic Survey's successor organization, took action to create a medal for each of the awards. Later in 1988, via NOAA Corps Bulletin 880401, NOAA authorized medals to supplement the ribbons previously awarded. Although obsolete, the six Coast and Geodetic Survey medals are part of the history and heritage of NOAA and the NOAA Corps:\n* Coast and Geodetic Survey Distinguished Service Medal  Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who distinguished himself by outstanding conduct or service in the line of duty between 8 September 1939 and 28 April 1952.\n* Coast and Geodetic Survey Meritorious Service Medal  Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who rendered service of a meritorious character between 8 September 1939 and 28 April 1952 but not of such an outstanding character as would warrant an award of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Distinguished Service Ribbon.\n* Coast and Geodetic Survey Good Conduct Medal  Awarded to enlisted members of the crews of Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels for exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity during service between 8 September 1939 and 28 April 1952.\n* Coast and Geodetic Survey Defense Service Medal  Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who served at any time during the period between 8 September 1939 and 6 December 1941.\n* Coast and Geodetic Survey Atlantic War Zone Medal Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who served outside the continental limits of the United States in the Atlantic War Zone between 7 December 1941 and 8 November 1945.\n* Coast and Geodetic Survey Pacific War Zone Medal Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who served outside the continental limits of the United States in the Pacific War Zone between 7 December 1941 and 2 March 1946.\nSee also\n*Uniformed services of the United States\n*National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps\n*United States Coast and Geodetic Survey\n*Military badges of the United States\n*Awards and decorations of the United States military\n*Obsolete badges of the United States military\nReferences"
