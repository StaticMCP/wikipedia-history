For much of his career he was known as Kid Brodie and did not ride under his birth name.\nCareer summary\nCole first appeared at the age of three in a short British Pathe film titled Child Motorcyclist 1948.\nCole began riding speedway in 1961 for the Wolverhampton Wolves when he was 17. Because he was still at Wolverhampton Grammar School at the time he rode under the nom de plume \"Kid Bodie\" so that the school would not find out. He also used the nom de plume because he had been a mascot for the Wolverhampton and Birmingham teams in the early 1950s and did not want this to be known at the time. The following year he transferred to Stoke and rode for the Potters until he broke his arm in 1963. In 1964-1965 he rode for the Long Eaton Archers. In 1966 he joined the Cradley Heathens for a year. He then had six years with the King's Lynn Stars before rejoining Cradley for two seasons in 1973–1974. He qualified for and rode in the 1969 World Final at Wembley.\nHe also rode in three British Championship finals from 1969 to 1971 and won the New Zealand Championship in Christchurch in 1967. He regularly rode in New Zealand and Australia during the English winter months and represented England in team contests in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. At retirement he had earned 10 international caps for the England national speedway team and 1 cap for Great Britain. With no Welsh national team, Welsh riders were eligible to ride for England.\nAfter retiring from speedway he moved to live in Sydney. He graduated with a teaching degree in 1978 and taught at Sydney Grammar Prep School until his retirement in 2003.\nWorld Final Appearances\n* 1969 –  London, Wembley Stadium – 16th – 1 pt\nReferences"
