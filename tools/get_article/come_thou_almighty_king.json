In this leaflet, the hymn had five verses of seven lines each, and was titled \"An Hymn to the Trinity.\" The leaflet also contained the hymn \"Jesus, Let Thy Pitying Eye\" by Charles Wesley, and because of this hymnologist Daniel Sedgwick attributed \"Come Thou Almighty King\" to Wesley as well. However, there is no record of this hymn in any of Wesley's collections of hymns, nor is there any hymn known to be Wesley's that uses the same meter as this hymn does (6,6,4,6,6,6,4).\nTune\nThe text is metrically adapted to the then new British royal anthem and was initially sung with its tune.\nPresently, \"Come Thou Almighty King\" is usually sung to the tune \"Italian Hymn\" (also called \"Moscow\" or \"Trinity\"), which was written as a musical setting for this hymn by Felice Giardini at the request of Countess Selina Shirley. This hymn tune along with three others of Giardini's were first published in Martin Madan's Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, 1769.\n>\n}\n\\new Staff { \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\set Staff.midiInstrument = \"church organ\"\n\\relative c'\n>\n}\n>> >>\n\\layout { indent = #0 }\n\\midi { \\tempo 4 = 90 }\nLyrics (1783)\nCome, thou Almighty King,\nHelp us thy name to sing,\nHelp us to praise!\nFather all glorious,\nO'er all victorious!\nCome and reign over us,\nAntient of days!\nJesus our Lord, arise,\nScatter our enemies,\nAnd make them fall!\nLet thine Almighty aid\nOur sure defence be made,\nOur souls on thee be stay'd;\nLord hear our call!\nCome, thou incarnate word,\nGird on thy mighty sword —\nOur pray'r attend!\nCome! and thy people bless,\nAnd give thy word success,\nSpirit of holiness\nOn us descend!\nCome, holy Comforter,\nThy sacred witness bear,\nIn this glad hour!\nThou who Almighty art,\nNow rule in ev'ry heart,\nAnd ne'er from us depart.\nSpirit of pow'r.\nTo the great one in three\nEternal praises be\nHence — evermore!\nHis sov'reign Majesty\nMay we in glory see,\nAnd to eternity\nLove and adore!\nReferences\nExternal links"
