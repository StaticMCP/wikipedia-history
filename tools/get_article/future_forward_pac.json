It was the Kamala Harris campaign's main Super PAC and leading fundraising vehicle in the 2024 presidential election.\nDescription\nThe organization is led by Chauncey McLean, who formerly worked for the Obama campaign. When the PAC was formed in 2020, the Biden campaign initially worried that it was created to support the Trump campaign. It later became apparent that the PAC had instead raised $100m for Biden campaign ads, mostly from Silicon Valley-based donors. When Guy Cecil stepped down from leading the Priorities USA PAC in March 2024, the Biden campaign communicated to donors that Future Forward should be the new target for large donations.\nAfter Biden withdrew from the election, the PAC shifted its messaging to the 2024 Kamala Harris presidential campaign. It raised over $700 million, conducted millions of voter surveys, and produced thousands of ads. Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates both reportedly donated $50 million to the PAC. Gates' donation was made to the Future Forward USA Action arm of Future Forward, which does not disclose its donors. It is notable for its secrecy, and its deeply analytical approach.\nPollster David Shor, the former Biden adviser Anita Dunn, and Kara Swisher, a former New York Times opinion columnist have been described as Future Forward operatives.\nReferences"
