It serves as the soundtrack to the duo's audio comedy (described as a \"wireless drama\" by Costello), entitled The True Story of the Coward Brothers. Its plot sees Costello and Burnett, as Howard and Henry Coward, respectively, playing \"a trans-Atlantic pair of con men who may or may not be blood relatives.\"\nBackground\nCostello and Burnett have a history of collaboration, dating back to the 1985 single \"The People's Limousine\", the first release to be credited to \"The Coward Brothers\".  The Coward Brothers were also the credited producers of Costello's 1987 single \"Blue Chair\".  Without using the \"Coward Brothers\" identity, Costello and Burnett also collaborated on the production of Costello's albums King of America (1986) and Spike (1989), and Burnett has produced Costello's albums Secret, Profane & Sugarcane (2009) and National Ransom (2010), as well as producing work by The New Basement Tapes which featured Costello as a member.  Costello has also contributed to Burnett's albums as a co-songwriter of selected tracks.\nThe album was released in tandem with the radio play The True Story of the Coward Brothers on Audible. In addition to Burnett and Costello, the play features Christopher Guest, Rhea Seehorn, and Harry Shearer, among others.\nTrack listing\n| length1 = 2:26\n| title2 = Like Licorice\n| writer2 = Costello\n| length2 = 1:58\n| title3 = My Baby Just Squeals (You Heel)\n| writer3 = Costello\n| length3 = 3:08\n| title4 = The Devil's Wife\n| writer4 =\n| length4 = 4:43\n| title5 = Tipsy Woman\n| writer5 = Costello\n| length5 = 4:26\n| title6 = My Baby Just Purrs (You're Mine, Not Hers)\n| writer6 = Costello\n| length6 = 2:32\n| title7 = My Baby Just Whistles (Here Comes the Missiles)\n| writer7 = Costello\n| length7 = 1:50\n| title8 = World Serious\n| writer8 =\n| length8 = 3:00\n| title9 = Early Shirley\n| writer9 = Costello\n| length9 = 2:34\n| title10 = Yesteryear Is Near\n| writer10 = Costello\n| length10 = 1:43\n| title11 = Birkenhead Girl\n| writer11 = Costello\n| length11 = 3:16\n| title12 = Smoke-Ring Angel\n| writer12 =\n| length12 = 1:55\n| title13 = Wooden Woman\n| writer13 =\n| length13 = 2:33\n| title14 = (I Don't Want Your) Lyndon Johnson\n| writer14 = Costello\n| length14 = 2:24\n| title15 = Lotta Money\n| writer15 =\n| length15 = 4:34\n| title16 = Pure Bubblegum\n| writer16 = Costello\n| length16 = 3:29\n| title17 = Cathy Come Home\n| writer17 = Costello\n| length17 = 3:11\n| title18 = Bygones\n| writer18 = Burnett\n| length18 = 1:41\n| title19 = Row Me Once\n| writer19 =\n| length19 = 2:41\n| title20 = Clown Around Town\n| writer20 = Costello\n| length20 = 3:22\n| total_length = 57:27\n}}\nNote: Writing credits refer to Burnett and Costello by their character names (Henry and Howard Coward, respectively).
