The name is probably intended to invite comparison to King John's Castle, Limerick.\nThere are some original mullioned windows still present but most were replaced with 18th-century windows.\nIt was granted to Henry Billingsley in 1588, and to Thomas Browne in 1604. In 1645 it was used as an arsenal by James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven's troops during the Irish Confederate Wars, and was a military hospital in 1651.\nThe tower was renovated in the 18th/19th century and was used as a blacksmith's workshop.\nBuilding\nA four-storey tower house with some original mullioned windows. It is vaulted above the ground floor and the front and back walls were removed so that the castle is pierced by a large Gothic arch.\nReferences"
