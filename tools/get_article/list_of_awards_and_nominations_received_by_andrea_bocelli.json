Since winning the Newcomers section of the Sanremo Music Festival, in 1994, he has sold over 80 million albums worldwide, making him the biggest-selling singer in the history of Classical music.\nIn 1998, he was named one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People. In 1999, his nomination for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards marked the first time a classical artist had been nominated in the category, since Leontyne Price, in 1961. The Prayer, his duet with Celine Dion for the animated film, The Quest for Camelot, won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. With the release of his classical album, Sacred Arias, Bocelli captured a listing in the Guinness Book of World Records, as he simultaneously held the No. 1, 2 and 3 positions on the U.S. Classical albums charts. The next three-and-a-half years followed with Bocelli holding permanent residency at the No. 1 spot. Six of his albums have since reached the Top 10 on the Billboard 200, and a record-setting 8, have topped the classical albums charts in the United States.\nWith 5 million units sold worldwide, Sacred Arias became the biggest-selling classical album by a solo artist of all time, and with over 20 million copies sold worldwide, his 1997 pop album, Romanza, became the best-selling album by an Italian artist of any genre in history, as well as the best-selling album by a foreign artist in Canada, and a number of other countries in Europe and Latin America. The album's first single, \"Time to Say Goodbye\", topped charts all across Europe, including Germany, where it stayed at the top of the charts for fourteen consecutive weeks, breaking the all-time sales record, with over 3 million copies sold in the country. The single went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. He is widely regarded as the most popular Italian and classical singer in the world.\nIn 2006, Bocelli was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, and on March 2, 2010, he was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nHonorifics\n*  Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Grande Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana) awarded in Rome, on March 4, 2006.\n*  Grand Officer of  the Order of Merit of Duarte, Sánchez and Mella by the President of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernández in 2009, for his contributions to International art and culture.\n*   Golden Medal for Merits of Serbia awarded on 22 July 2022 in Belgrade.\n*  Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for his contribution to live theater, at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard, in 2010.\n*  Knight of the Civil Order of Savoy by Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy in 2025.\nAwards\nBambi Awards\n* Bambi Award in 1997.\nBillboard Latin Music Awards\n* Bocelli has won a total of 2 Billboard Latin Music Awards from 4 nominations.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2007 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Amor || Latin Pop Album of the Year, Male ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| 2014 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Pasión || Latin Pop Album of the Year ||\n|-\n| Andrea Bocelli || Latin Pop Albums Artist of the Year, Solo ||\n|-\n| Andrea Bocelli || Lifetime Achievement Award ||\n|-\n|}\nClassical Brit Awards\nBocelli has won 6 Classical BRITS, including the Outstanding Contribution to Music award in 2002, and has received 13 nominations.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| 2000 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andrea Bocelli || Male Artist of the Year ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Aria: The Opera Album || Album of the Year ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Sacred Arias || Album of the Year ||\n|-\n|| Best Selling Classical Album ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2001 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Verdi || Rover Album of the Year ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2002 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andrea Bocelli || Outstanding Contribution to Music ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| 2003 || style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"| Sentimento || Male Artist of the Year ||\n|-\n|| Album of the Year ||\n|-\n|| Best Selling Classical Album ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2009 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Incanto || NS&I Album of the Year ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| 2012 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andrea Bocelli || International Artist of the Year ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Concerto: One Night in Central Park || Male Artist of the Year ||\n|-\n|| Album of the Year  ||\n|-\nECHO Awards\nBocelli received an ECHO music award for in 1997.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1997 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Time to Say Goodbye\" || Single of the Year ||\n|-\n|}\nECHO Klassik Awards\n* Bocelli has won a total of 3 ECHO Klassik awards.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1997 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Viaggio Italiano || Best seller of the year ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1998 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Aria: The Opera Album || Best selling classical album ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2000 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Sacred Arias || Best seller of the year ||\n|-\n|}\nEmmy Awards\n* Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Classical Music-Dance Program for the 2000 Great Performances program, Andrea Bocelli: Sacred Arias in 2000.\nGoldene Europa Awards\n* Goldene Europa for classical music in 2000.\nGoldene Kamera Awards\n* Goldene Kamera award in the \"Music & Entertainment\" category 2002.\n, March 2, 2010, on Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, California.]]\nGrammy Awards\nBocelli has been nominated six times for a Grammy Award.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1999 ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andrea Bocelli || Best New Artist ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2000 ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Sogno || Best Male Pop Vocal Performance ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"The Prayer\" || Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2017 ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cinema || Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2020 ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Sì || Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album ||\n|-\nLatin Grammy Awards\n* Bocelli has been nominated a total of 6 Latin Grammy Awards\n|-\n| 2006 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Amor || Best Male Pop Vocal Album ||\n|-\n| 2008 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Vive ya!
