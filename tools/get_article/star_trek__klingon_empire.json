The series was published by Pocket Books from 2003 to 2008.\nOriginally published as Star Trek: 'I.K.S. Gorkon'.\nProduction\nFollowing positive reaction to his novel Diplomatic Implausibility (2001), DeCandido was curious if there was sufficient interest in a Klingon-centric series. In Voyages of Imagination (2009) by Jeff Ayers, DeCandido said \"Pocket Books … was willing to take a chance.\" He had \"already set it up\" in Diplomatic Implausibility and The Brave and the Bold, Book Two (2002), so he \"took it forward\" with two novels. A third novel followed in 2005.\nIn 2008, the series was relaunched as Klingon Empire. The scope of A Burning House expanded the setting beyond the crew aboard the Gorkon.\nMembers of Gorkon crew appear in the Destiny (2008) miniseries, by David Mack, and in A Singular Destiny (2008), by DeCandido.\nOnly one relaunch novel has been published, though representatives of Simon & Schuster suggested new 'Klingon' novels were forthcoming as late as 2012. DeCandido explained in numerous interviews he has not queried new novels for the series since he submitted the un-related short story \"The Unhappy Ones\", later collected in Seven Deadly Sins (2010).\nFlagship\nThe  is a Qang-class, or Chancellor-class, war cruiser named for Chancellor Gorkon first introduced in The Undiscovered Country (1991). The cruiser is  in length, and carries a complement of over 2,000 crew. When launched, the Gorkon, was among the first of the Qang-class cruisers in service.\nA Good Day to Die (2003) begins sometime after Chancellor Martok ordered the Gorkon to the Kavrot Sector—an unexplored region of space—with the objective of finding new planets to conquer for the glory of the Empire.\nCaptain Klag, captain of the Gorkon, was introduced in The Next Generation episode \"A Matter of Honor\".\nNovels\nAll novels written by Keith DeCandido.\nI.K.S.
