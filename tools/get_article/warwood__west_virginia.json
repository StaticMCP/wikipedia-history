It lies at an elevation of 673&nbsp;feet (205&nbsp;m). Warwood was named for the Warwood Tool Company. Founded by Henry Warwood of Martins Ferry, Ohio in 1854, the company was sold to Daniel L. Heiskell in 1892 and moved to a location four miles north of Wheeling. The Warwood Tool Company remains in existence to this day.[https://books.google.com/books?id=G43kOop0fMUC&dq=Warwood+tool+company+history&pg=PA25]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, a large number of Greek immigrants predominantly from the island of Karpathos settled in Warwood to work in the coal mines. Among Warwood natives of Karpathian descent is the noted Greek Orthodox theologian John G. Panagiotou.\nGlenns Run, a tributary to the Ohio River, joins here.\nSee also\n*List of cities and towns along the Ohio River\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
