He was successful, but only by a very narrow margin, which dissipated over the course of the parliament.\nIn Northern Ireland, the United Ulster Unionist Council continued to support an arrangement between the Ulster Unionist Party, the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party and the Democratic Unionist Party not to contest against each other in their joint opposition to the Sunningdale Agreement, while former Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner led the new Unionist Party of Northern Ireland in favour of a coalition-based executive under the Agreement. Enoch Powell, formerly an MP for Wolverhampton South West from 1959 to February 1974, was elected for South Down. Powell had left the Conservative Party in opposition to the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities.\nOn the nationalist side, the SDLP held its seat in Belfast West, and stood aside in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, allowing for the defeat of UUP leader Harry West by Independent Nationalist Frank Maguire.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+Results\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! colspan=\"5\" |Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" |Aggregate Votes\n|-\n!
