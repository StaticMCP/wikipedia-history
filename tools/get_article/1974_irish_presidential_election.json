Childers. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh was elected unopposed as the fifth president of Ireland.\nNomination process\nChilders died on 17 November 1974. On 21 November, the Minister for Local Government issued a ministerial order setting 3 December as the date for close of nominations and 18 December as the date of the election.\nUnder Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president could be nominated by:\n*at least twenty of the 204 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or\n*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs.\nAgreed candidate\nInitially all parties privately agreed to nominate the late president's widow, Rita Childers. Before she was informed of the plan, however, a mix-up led to the collapse of the arrangement. A partially deaf Fine Gael Teachta Dála, identified in some reports as Tom O'Donnell, confirmed the secret arrangement upon mishearing a journalist's question asking about the decision of a local council's nomination of Childers as president, having assumed that the cross-party decision was made public. Fianna Fáil leader Jack Lynch, thinking the party was set up, subsequently withdrew from the agreement and nominated Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh instead. The parties agreed to the new arrangement due to a number of external factors, including a sluggish economy and The Troubles.\n|candidate  = Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh\n|party      = Independent politician (Ireland)\n|nominator  = Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Party\n}}\nÓ Dálaigh was inaugurated as president on Thursday, 19 December 1974.\nReferences"
