Austrian troops which were due to chaos still listening to orders from Pest government also involved in the battle. Battle ended in Slovak victory.\nPrelude\nOn September 19, 1848, Slovak volunteers began to fight against the Hungarian revolution. On the same day, volunteer units occupied Myjava. At the People's Assembly in Myjava, Štúr declared obedience to the Hungarian government and its authorities on behalf of the Slovak National Council and declared the independence (autonomy) of Slovakia within Hungary. At the same time, he called on Slovaks to fight for national and social rights. In his speech, Hurban called for the erasure of the borders between Slovakia and Moravia, \"because in the old days it was all one common homeland of the fraternal Slavic nations\". In Myjava, the Slovak National Council settled in the house of the widow of the evangelical priest Koléniová. While staying in Myjava, there was an incident with the hundredth of the imperial regiment, whose commander called on the volunteers to leave the city. However, the rebels raided the imperial barracks and disarmed the soldiers. It turned out that the expedition would also have to face imperial troops, whose subordination on the territory of Hungary was not clear.The core of the expedition, including the SNC, then moved to Brezová pod Bradlom on September 21. One day after battle happenend.\nBattle\nFirst Attack\nFrom Hradiště pod Vrátnom, Vojnić advanced with the Wallmoden troops, with about 250 men. In the Pri Valche valley, they met the rebel guard. The guard's position was strengthened in an interesting way - by flooding the meadows around the Valchy mill by stopping the mill stream. After the arrival of the Slovak team, led by Janeček and Štefanovič, the Wallmoden troops stopped fighting and retreated towards Hradiště.\nSecond Attack\nAnother unit that advanced from Vrboviec to Brezová was the 11th hundred of the Ceccopier regiment under the command of Captain Kotulinský (about 150 men). As soon as the Ceccopiers approached from Bukovec through Kršiačky at 8 a.m., they were spotted by the rebel guards. They, not waiting for reinforcements, insufficiently armed with scythes, flails, sabres and only to a lesser extent with rifles, attacked the 11th hundred precisely at the place of the mound on Prietržská Road. After the arrival of the rebel reinforcements led by Bakowski's hundred, the 11th hundred and the guard stationed behind it retreated towards Senica and around 9 a.m. the attack was over.\nThird Atttack\nShortly after that, an attack also began from a third party. From Vrbové, the 8th hundred of the Ceccopier regiment (100-120 men) advanced under the command of Captain Saussay. Two Slovak hundreds (Štefanovičov and Bakowski) were sent against them, and the Ceccopiers surrendered without a fight near the Štefovci hill. From Vrbové, the guardsmen, led by the sub-prefect of the Nitra seat Ocskay (100-120 men), also set out against the rebels. After 3 p.m., the guardsmen were defeated at the site of today's Brezov dam, and their escape stopped only in Hlohovec.\nAftermath\nReferences"
