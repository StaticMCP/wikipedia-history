Keith, and  published by FASA.\nPlot summary\nAction Aboard: Adventures on the King Richard is a supplement presenting character descriptions and game statistics, with adventure ideas and outlines so that gamemasters can devise scenarios for player characters to be used aboard the 5000-ton King Richard luxury liner.\nPublication history\nAction Aboard: Adventures on the King Richard was written by Bill Paley, with art by Kevin Siembieda, and was published in 1981 by FASA as a digest-sized 48-page book with a two-color map.\nReception\nWilliam A. Barton reviewed Action Aboard: Adventures on the King Richard in The Space Gamer No. 47. Barton commented that \"Overall, Action Aboard is quite well done and should provide many hours of adventure for Traveller players who can appreciate several different types of scenarios.\"\nDoug Houseman reviewed Action Aboard for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"Action Aboard is by far the best new adventure for Traveller available to the GM. Other FASA adventures offer almost as much to the GM, but this adventure offers so many possibilities that one can apply not only to the Traveller system but to almost any other science-fiction role-playing system on the market.\"\nBob McWilliams reviewed Action Aboard for White Dwarf #31, giving it an overall rating of 5 out of 10 for the novice, and 6 for the expert, and stated that \"Well produced and with plenty going on, the designers have provided referees with as much help as can be fitted in booklets of this size, gone into detail at points in the adventure where it's necessary and not filled out with 'chrome'.\"\nReviews\n*Polyhedron #75\nSee also\n*I.S.C.V.: King Richard - Deck plans for use with this product\n*List of Traveller books\nReferences"
