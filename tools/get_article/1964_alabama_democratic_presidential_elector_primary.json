In 1960, Alabama was the only state where both presidential electors and DNC delegates were elected by popular vote. Instead of every candidate running in an at-large election, each candidate ran for a designated place, with the highest-placing candidates in each place receiving the nomination.\nThe election resulted in the nomination of ten unpledged electors not loyal to the national Democratic Party. Alabama was the only state in which Lyndon B. Johnson or electors pledged to him did not appear on the general election ballot in 1964.\nElectoral slates\nUnpledged electors\nThe following candidates were recruited to serve as unpledged electors:\n*Place 1: James Allen, 17th and 20th Lieutenant Governor of Alabama (1951–1955, 1963–1967)\n*Place 2: Edmund Blair, newspaper publisher and independent elector in 1960\n*Place 3: Albert Brewer, 58th Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives (1963–1967)\n*Place 4: Albert H.
