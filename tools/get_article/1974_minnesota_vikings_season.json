They won the NFC Central with a 10–4 record, before defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 30–14 in the NFC divisional playoff game, followed by a 14–10 win over the Los Angeles Rams to claim their second consecutive NFC championship. The Vikings then lost 16–6 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl IX at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana, becoming the first team to lose consecutive Super Bowls.\nOffseason\n1974 draft\n{|\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1974 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 1 || 17\n| Fred McNeill || Linebacker || UCLA || From Falcons\n|-\n! 25\n| Steve Riley || Offensive tackle || USC ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 2 || 29\n| John Holland || Wide receiver || Tennessee State || From Chargers\n|-\n! 51\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Matt Blair || Linebacker || Iowa State ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3 || 64\n| Steve Craig || Tight end || Northwestern || From Packers via Chargers\n|-\n! 77\n| Scott Anderson || Center || Missouri ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 4 || 86\n| Mike Townsend || Defensive back || Notre Dame || from Saints\n|-\n! 103\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Cincinnati Bengals ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 5 || 120\n| Jim Ferguson || Defensive back || Stanford || From Broncos\n|-\n! 128\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles || From Rams\n|-\n! 129\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Baltimore Colts ||\n|-\n! 6 || 155\n| Mark Kellar || Running back || Northern Illinois ||\n|-\n! 7 || 181\n| Fred Tabron || Running back || Southwest Missouri State ||\n|-\n! 8 || 207\n| Berl Simmons || Placekicker || TCU ||\n|-\n! 9 || 232\n| Sam McCullum || Wide receiver || Montana State ||\n|-\n! 10 || 259\n| Barry Reed || Running back || Peru State ||\n|-\n! 11 || 285\n| Dave Boone || Defensive end || Eastern Michigan ||\n|-\n! 12 || 311\n| Randy Poltl || Defensive back || Stanford ||\n|-\n! 13 || 337\n| Gary Keller || Defensive tackle || Utah ||\n|-\n! 14 || 363\n| Alan Dixon || Running back || Harding ||\n|-\n! 15 || 389\n| Kurt Wachtler || Defensive tackle || St. John's ||\n|-\n! 16 || 415\n| John Goebel || Running back || St. Thomas (MN) ||\n|-\n! 17 || 441\n| Earl Garrett || Defensive back || Boston State ||\n|}\nNotes\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists =\n|Practice Squad =\n}}\nPreseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

On their first possession of the game, St. Louis drove to the Vikings 35-yard line, but lost the ball on a failed 4th-and-1 conversion attempt. St. Louis eventually got onto the scoreboard first with quarterback Jim Hart's 13-yard touchdown pass to receiver Earl Thomas, but Minnesota countered when quarterback Fran Tarkenton completed a 16-yard touchdown pass to John Gilliam. The 7–7 tie would last till the end of the half. The Cardinals had a chance to take the lead with a 56-yard drive to the Vikings 6-yard line, but Jim Bakken missed a 23-yard field goal attempt as time expired.\nOn the third play of the second half, Vikings defensive back Jeff Wright intercepted a pass from Hart and returned it 18 yards to set up Fred Cox's 37-yard field goal, giving his team a 10–7 lead. Exactly 60 seconds later, on the Cardinals' ensuing drive, Terry Metcalf lost a fumble while being leveled by Vikings linemen Alan Page and Carl Eller. Cornerback Nate Wright picked up the loose ball and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown that increased Minnesota's lead to 17–7. A few minutes later, Tarkenton finished off a 16-point quarter with a 38-yard touchdown pass to Gilliam. In the fourth quarter, Vikings running back Chuck Foreman, who finished the game with 114 rushing yards and 5 receptions for 54 yards, recorded a 4-yard touchdown run to give Minnesota a 30–7 lead. By the time Metcalf rushed for an 11-yard fourth-quarter touchdown, the game was already out of reach for the Cardinals.\nNFC Championship Game: vs. Los Angeles Rams\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=NFC Championship Game: Los Angeles Rams at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|road=Rams\n|R1=0|R2=3|R3=0|R4=7\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=0|H2=7|H3=0|H4=7\n|date=December 29\n|stadium=Metropolitan Stadium, Bloomington, Minnesota\n|time=12:00 p.m. CST\n|weather=Sunny,\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=Pat Summerall, Tom Brookshier and Bart Starr\n|attendance=48,444\n|referee=Tommy Bell\n|reference=[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197412290min.htm Pro-Football-Reference.com]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*No scoring plays.\nSecond quarter\n*MIN – Jim Lash 29-yard pass from Fran Tarkenton (Fred Cox kick).

After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton threw a 29-yard touchdown to Jim Lash. Rams kicker David Ray later added a 27-yard field goal to cut the lead to 7–3 before halftime. In the third quarter, Los Angeles advanced the ball from their own 1-yard line to the Minnesota 1-yard line. The big play on the drive was a 73-yard pass play to Harold Jackson, who was finally pushed out of bounds at the Vikings 2 by safety Jeff Wright. With the ball inside the one-yard line, Rams guard Tom Mack was controversially called for illegal procedure (replays showed Mack did not move). Moved back to the six-yard line, the Rams were forced to pass for a touchdown on third down but the pass was deflected and Vikings linebacker Wally Hilgenberg intercepted the ball in the end zone for a touchback. Minnesota then went on a 15-play drive that took almost eight minutes off the clock to score on Dave Osborn's 4-yard touchdown run. With 7:15 left to play in the game, the Rams then cut the deficit to 14–10 with Harold Jackson's 44-yard touchdown reception. Then after forcing the Vikings to punt, Los Angeles drove to the Minnesota 45-yard line. But a third down sack forced the Rams to punt again and the Vikings kept the ball to run out the clock.\nSuper Bowl IX: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Super Bowl IX: Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=January 12, 1975\n|time=2:00&nbsp;pm CST\n|road=Steelers\n|R1=0 |R2=2 |R3=7 |R4=7\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=0 |H2=0 |H3=0 |H4=6\n|stadium=Tulane Stadium, New Orleans, Louisiana\n|attendance=80,997\n|weather=Overcast,\n|referee=Bernie Ulman\n|TV=NBC\n|TVAnnouncers=Curt Gowdy, Al DeRogatis, and Don Meredith\n|reference=[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197501120min.htm Pro-Football-Reference.com]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*No scoring plays.\nSecond quarter\n*PIT – Fran Tarkenton sacked in the end zone by Dwight White for a safety.
