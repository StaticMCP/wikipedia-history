      "text": "# William Edward Butler\n\n\"]]\nWilliam Edward Butler (1790–1882) was a pioneer settler of western Tennessee and a kinsman of President Andrew Jackson. The son of Revolutionary War officer Thomas Butler, he married Jackson's niece and ward Martha Thompson \"Patsy\" Hays, sister of Stockley Donelson Hays and Samuel Jackson Hays. Butler served as a \"surgeon of the 2nd Tennessee Regiment under Andrew Jackson\" in the War of 1812.\nButler ran against Davy Crockett in 1821 for a seat in the Tennessee General Assembly. Butler was at that time known as \"one of the wealthiest, most public—spirited, aristocratic, and hospitable men of Jackson, Tennessee.\" Crockett won, partly because he handed out whiskey and tobacco to voters, partly on public policy and charisma, and partly because he appealed to the proletariat with stump speech descriptions of Butler's fine lifestyle including luxurious carpets, such that \"every day he walks on truck finer than any gowns your wives or your daughters, in all their lives, ever wore!\"\nOne history states, \"The Butlers were very wealthy and owned a racetrack and many fine horses.\" Jackson and Butler discussed horses in their correspondence; Butler's track was located where the National Guard Armory stood in Jackson in 1946. Butler is considered by some to have been the founder of Jackson, Tennessee.\nSee also\n* Wards of Andrew Jackson\nReferences\nSources\n*"
