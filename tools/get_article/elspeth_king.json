Her parents were William and Christina (born Cowie) King and she attended Beath High School in Fife. She studied Medieval History at University of St Andrews, graduating with First Class Honours. She went on to complete a post-graduate course in Museum Studies at University of Leicester.\nIn 1974, King joined the People's Palace in Glasgow as a curator, and remained there for the next sixteen years. During her tenure exhibitions such as Scotland Sober and Free, the 150th anniversary of the Temperance Movement, and the exhibition her colleague and romantic partner Michael Donnelly curated from his own collection of stained glass in 1981, gained record attendances. The People's Palace won European Museum of the Year in 1981 and the British Museum of the Year award in 1983. King championed the inclusion of objects that were not traditional items for museums. She defended her inclusion of Billy Connolly's Banana Boots that he first wore in 1975. They became one of the museum's most popular items. She felt that they represented Glasgow's irreverence.\nHer pet cat Smudge became very well known in Glasgow during her time working there.\nIn 1990, King was passed over for the civic post of keeper of social history. This decision was considered controversial by many, and was the subject of an appeal under the council's grievance process.\nKing left Glasgow to take on the role of director of the Dunfermline Heritage Trust, where she helped to oversee the restoration as a heritage centre of Abbot House, the oldest secular building in the town.\nIn 1994, King joined the Smith Art Gallery Museum in Stirling as its first director, where she remained until her retirement in August 2018. The museum had been threatened with closure earlier in the year due to funding cuts. However, a petition was mounted to combat this decision and gained over 7000 signatures after which the museum received a reprieve.\nKing died on 1 November 2025, at the age of 76.\nHonours\nKing was made an Honorary Doctor of the University of Stirling in 2005 for her \"outstanding work in developing Scottish museums and in promoting Scottish history and culture\".\nWritten works\n* ''The Scottish Women's Suffrage Movement / ... compiled by Elspeth King to accompany the Government sponsored \"Right to Vote\" exhibition organised to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act, from 9 September- 7 October 1978.
