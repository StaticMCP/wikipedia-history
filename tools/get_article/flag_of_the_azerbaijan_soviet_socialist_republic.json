On 12 March 1922, the Azerbaijan SSR united with the Georgian SSR and the Armenian SSR under the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR), that was split again into these three republics in 1936.\n1920\n|Azerbaijansovietrep1920-1921.svg| 1920–1921\n|Flag of Azerbaijan SSR (1921-1922).svg| 1921–1922\n|Flag of Azerbaijan 1922 (2).svg| 1922–1924\n}}\nIn 1937, a golden hammer and sickle was added in the top left-hand corner, with beneath the Latin characters AzSSR in a serif font in place of the Cyrillic characters. A third version was issued in 1940s, and had AzSSR substituted by its Cyrillic version АзССР.\nThe last version of the flag was adopted by the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 October 1952. It was the flag of the Soviet Union, with a horizontal blue band on the bottom fourth. The 1952 flag was discarded on 5 February 1991, when the flag of Azerbaijan SSR based on the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was re-introduced.\n1924-1927\n|Flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (1927-1931).svg| 1927-1931\n|Flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (1931-1937).svg| 1931-1937\n|Flag AzSSR.svg| 1937–1940\n|Flag АзССР.svg| 1940–1952\n|Flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (1952–1956).svg| 1952–1956 (early variant)\n|Flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.svg| 1952–1991\n|File:Flag of Azerbaijan (1991–2013).svg| 1991, as flag of the Republic of Azerbaijan\n}}\nNotes\nSee also\n*Flag of the Soviet Union\n*Flag of Azerbaijan\n*Coat of Arms of Azerbaijan\nReferences"
