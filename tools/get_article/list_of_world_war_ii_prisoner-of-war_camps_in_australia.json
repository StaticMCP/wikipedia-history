Prisoners of war were also sent to Australia from other Allied countries for internment in Australia.\nInternment camps were established for three reasons – to prevent residents from assisting Australia's enemies, to appease public opinion and to house overseas internees sent to Australia for the duration of the war. Unlike World War I, the initial aim of internment was to identify and intern those who posed a particular threat to the safety or defence of the country. As the war progressed, however, this policy changed and Japanese residents were interned en masse. In the later years of the war, Germans and Italians were also interned on the basis of nationality, particularly those living in the north of Australia. In all, just over 20 per cent of all Italians resident in Australia were interned.\nDuring World War II, Australia interned about 7000 residents, including more than 1500 British nationals. A further 8000 people were sent to Australia to be interned after being detained overseas by Australia's allies. At its peak in 1942, more than 12,000 people were interned in Australia.\nNew South Wales\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Camp\n!Place\n|-\n|6\n|Hay\n|-\n|7\n|Hay\n|-\n|8\n|Hay\n|-\n|9\n|Oberon\n|-\n|11\n|Glen Innes\n|-\n|12\n|Cowra\n|-\n|15\n|Yanco\n|-\n|\n|Liverpool Prisoners Of War and Internment Camp\n|-\n|\n|Bathurst Internment Camp at Bathurst Civil Gaol\n|-\n|\n|Long Bay Civil Gaol\n|-\n|\n|Long Bay State Reformatory\n|-\n|\n|Orange Temporary Internment Camp\n|-\n|\n|Peat Island Civil Reformatory\n|-\n|}\nQueensland\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Camp\n!Place\n|-\n|\n|Gaythorne Prisoners of War and Internment Camp\n|-\n|\n|Chinese Camp at Bulimba shipyard, Brisbane for Native Labour Company\n|-\n|\n|Enoggera Temporary Internment and POW Camp\n|-\n|\n|North Ward POW Compound\n|-\n|\n|Stuart Prison, Stuart, Townsville\n|-\n|\n|Thompson's Point POW camp (unsubstantiated)\n|-\n|}\nSouth Australia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Camp\n!Place\n|-\n|17\n|Sandy Creek Internment and POW Camp\n|-\n|9\n|Loveday\n|-\n|10\n|Loveday\n|-\n|14\n|Loveday\n|-\n|\n|Cook POW Labour Camp No. 3 POW Labour Detachment (actually HQ only for six camps)\n|-\n|\n|Gladstone Civil Gaol\n|-\n|\n|Katarapko Wood Camp\n|-\n|\n|Keswick Temporary Internment and Transit Camp\n|-\n|\n|Nangwarry Wood Camp\n|-\n|\n|Moorook West Wood Camp\n|-\n|\n|Wandillo, Prisoner of War Hostel\n|-\n|\n|Woolenook Wood Camp\n|-\n|}\nTasmania\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Camp\n!Place\n|-\n|18\n|Brighton\n|-\n|}\nVictoria\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Camp\n!Place\n|-\n|1\n|Tatura\n|-\n|2\n|Tatura\n|-\n|3\n|Rushworth\n|-\n|4\n|Rushworth\n|-\n|5\n|Myrtleford CTT\n|-d4\n|6\n|Graytown POW Camp\n|-\n|13\n|Murchison\n|-\n|19\n|Tatura\n|-\n|\n|Camp Darley\n|-\n|\n|Camp Pell - Victoria (part of Australian Army Camp)\n|-\n|\n|Dhurringile Internment and POW Camp (Tatura, Victoria)\n|-\n|\n|Green Mill Temporary Internment Camp  (Melbourne, Victoria)\n|-\n|\n|Rowville Internment Camp\n|}\nWestern Australia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Camp\n!Place\n|-\n|11\n|Harvey Internment Camp\n|-\n|16\n|Marrinup POW Camp\n|-\n|\n|No. 11 Detention Barracks Fremantle Prison\n|-\n|W20\n|Jarrahdale POW Camp\n|-\n|\n|No 8 Prisoner of War Labour Detachment from No 13 camp, Victoria\n|-\n|\n|North Dandalup Work Camp\n|-\n|\n|Northam POW Camp\n|-\n|\n|Northcliffe POW Camp\n|-\n|\n|Parkeston Transit and Detention Camp\n|-\n|\n|Rottnest Island POW Hostel\n|-\n|\n|Wembley POW Camp\n|-\n|\n|Woodman Point Internment Camp\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828191324/http://users.mcmedia.com.au/~kneefam/ Tatura World War 2 Wartime Camps & Irrigation Museum]\n*[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/enemyathome/ The Enemy At Home – Germans In World War One Australia] (online exhibition)\n*[http://www.lovedayproject.com/about/ Loveday Project] (research project about Japanese civilians interned in Australia)\n*  CC-By-SA"
