While the manga is not a one-to-one adaptation of the film, it broadly incorporates its major plot points; Saito has commented that she regards the manga as a more direct story, while the film is more thematic and abstract. As the manga was published in a special edition of Bessatsu Shōjo Comic aimed at a josei audience (older teenage girls and adult women), it maintains a more mature tone relative to the original Revolutionary Girl Utena manga and anime. An English-language translation of the manga licensed by Viz Media was serialized in Animerica Extra before being published as a collected volume by Viz on November 11, 2004.\n) January 10, 2018 ()\n| OriginalISBN    = 4-09-136089-0 |ISBN_note=() ()\n| LicensedRelDate = November 11, 2004\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1591165002\n}}\nRevolutionary Girl Utena: After the Revolution\nOn May 20, 2017, Shogakukan announced that the first chapter of an Utena sequel series written and illustrated by Saito, Revolutionary Girl Utena: After the Revolution, would be published in the September issue of its monthly josei manga magazine Flowers. Two additional chapters were published in the March and May 2018 issues. Released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the release of the anime series, After the Revolution depicts the lives of the primary cast 20 years after the events of the original series. Shogakukan collected all three chapters into a single tankōbon volume on May 10, 2018. An English-language translation of After the Revolution was published by Viz Media on October 6, 2020\nReferences\n}}"
