The office of President was established in 1991, replacing the position of Chairperson of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR, which had existed since 1925. The president is directly elected for a term of seven years, by citizens of Uzbekistan who have reached 18 years of age.\nIslam Karimov was the only President of Uzbekistan for 25 years following the establishment of the office; he won three consecutive elections which many consider to have been rigged. The third election was the most controversial since he had been elected twice and the current Constitution stipulated a maximum of two terms. The official explanation was that his first term in office, of five years, was under the previous Constitution and did not count towards the new limit. He died in office on 2 September 2016. A joint session of both houses of the Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan appointed Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev as interim President on 8 September 2016. In December 2016, Mirziyoyev was elected President in a popular vote, though international observers described the election as not free and fair, due to restrictions on media reporting and ballot stuffing.\nElection\nQualifications\nThe Constitution of Uzbekistan requires that a presidential candidate be at least 35 years old, be fluent in speaking the state language (Uzbek), and have resided for at least ten years in the territory of Uzbekistan.\nOn taking office, the president must take the following oath, stipulated by Article 92 of the constitution, at a sitting of the Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan:\nThe president places his hand on the Constitution of Uzbekistan as well as the Quran when they take the oath of office.\nElectoral law\nThe constitution states that the officeholder shall be elected by citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot.\nRole\nThe Constitution of Uzbekistan lays out the duties and powers of the President of the Republic, which in detail are:\n# To guarantee observance of rights and freedoms of citizens, the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Uzbekistan;\n# To take the necessary measures for the protection of the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and implementation of decisions regarding its national-state structure;\n# To represent the Republic of Uzbekistan within the country and in international relations;\n# To conduct negotiations and sign treaties and agreements for the Republic, and ensure the observance of the treaties and agreements negotiated by the Republic and obligations assumed by it;\n# To receive letters of credence and recall from diplomatic and other representatives accredited to him/her;\n# To present to the Senate of the Oliy Majlis (parliament) nominees for appointment as diplomatic and other representatives of the Republic of Uzbekistan to foreign states;\n# To present to the Oliy Majlis of Uzbekistan annual reports on major matters of social and economic life, home and foreign policies of the country;\n# To form the office of executive authority and direct it; ensure interaction of the supreme bodies of authority and administration of the Republic; form and abolish ministries, state committees and other bodies of state administration with subsequent submission of decrees on these matters for approval by the chambers of the Oliy Majlis;\n# To present to the Senate a nominee for election to the post of Chairperson of the Senate;\n# To present for consideration and approval by the chambers of the Oliy Majlis a nominee for the office of Prime Minister, and relieve the Prime Minister of that post;\n# To approve, on the nomination of the Prime Minister, members of the Cabinet of Ministers, and relieve them of their posts;\n# To appoint a Procurator-General and deputies, subject to approval by the Senate, and relieve them of their posts;\n# To present to the Senate nominees for the posts of Chairperson and judges of the Constitutional Court, Chairperson and judges of the Supreme Court, Chairperson and judges of the Higher Economic Court, Chairperson of the Board of the Central Bank, and Chairperson of the State Committee for the Protection of Nature;\n# To appoint judges of regional, inter-district, district, city, martial and economic courts, and relieve them of their posts;\n# To appoint and relieve khokims of regions and the city of Tashkent of their posts with their subsequent approval by relevant Kenghashes of people’s deputies.
