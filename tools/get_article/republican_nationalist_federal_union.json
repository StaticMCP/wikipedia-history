UFNR) was a left-republican political party formed in 1910 in Catalonia by the Republican Nationalist Centre and republican elements from the late Catalan Solidarity.\nIn 1914, UFNR signed a deal with the Radical Republican Party (PRR), the \"Pact of San Gervasio\", seeking to challenge the political hegemony of Regionalist League in Barcelona, but the alliance's poor results led to its disestablishment in 1917.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
