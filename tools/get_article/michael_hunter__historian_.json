Neville Prize\n}}\nMichael Cyril William Hunter  (born 1949) is emeritus professor of history in the department of history, classics and archaeology and a fellow of Birkbeck, University of London.  Hunter is interested in the culture of early modern England.  He specialises in the history of science in seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England, particularly the work of Robert Boyle. In Noel Malcolm's judgement, Hunter \"has done more for Boyle studies than anyone before him (or, one might almost say, than all previous Boyle scholars put together)\".\nEducation\nHunter read history at Jesus College, University of Cambridge, England from 1968 to 1972. He then attended Worcester College, Oxford, where he received a DPhil.\nCareer\nAfter a brief stay at the University of Reading Hunter joined Birkbeck, University of London in 1976.\nHunter's first monograph focused on the English antiquary and natural philosopher John Aubrey. Since then he has written extensively on the history of science and intellectual thought in England during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, in particular the Royal Society.\nHis most substantial scholarly achievement is his edition of Boyle's Works (with Edward Davis, 14 vols, 1999–2000) and Correspondence (with Antonio Clericuzio and Lawrence Principe, 6 vols, 2001).\nFrom 2006 to 2009 Hunter directed the creation of a digital library focusing on British printed images before 1700.\nHe received the 2011 Roy G. Neville Prize from the Chemical Heritage Foundation for his biographical work Boyle: Between God and Science. He also received the 2011 Robert Latham medal from the Samuel Pepys Club. In his honour, when he retired in 2013, the Birkbeck Early Modern Society held a conference on \"Science, Magic and Religion in the Early Modern Period\".\nHunter has been a wary defender of his turf, with scholars Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer observing he has been \"consistently hostile\" to their more recent work on Robert Boyle.\nPersonal life\nHunter is a motorcycle enthusiast who likes two-stroke racing bikes.  He lives in Hastings, East Sussex.\nWorks\nOther academic books include:\n*[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/n7 John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning].
