      "text": "# Big Whiskey & the GrooGrux King\n\n}}\nBig Whiskey & the GrooGrux King is the seventh studio album by the American rock band Dave Matthews Band, which was released by RCA Records on June 2, 2009.\nIt is the band's first release since the death of saxophonist LeRoi Moore, and it is their last album to feature Moore. Guitarist Tim Reynolds played on the album, marking his first recording with DMB since 1998's Before These Crowded Streets. Rashawn Ross makes his first appearance on a DMB studio album since joining as a regular touring member in 2006 as well as Jeff Coffin, who has taken Moore's role since June 2008. The album was the first to be produced by Rob Cavallo.\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 424,000 copies in its first week of release. This marked the group's fifth consecutive studio album to open with a sales week of at least 400,000 copies.\nExactly six months after its release, Big Whiskey & the GrooGrux King was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Rock Album and Album of the Year, but lost to Green Day's 21st Century Breakdown and Taylor Swift's Fearless, respectively.\nRecording\nWork on the album began in November 2007 at Haunted Hollow in Charlottesville, Virginia. Production moved to Seattle, Washington in February 2008 at Studio Litho, and continued from October to December 2008 at Studio X. In January 2009 the sessions that would complete the album began at Piety Street Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nThe album was originally slated to be released on April 14, 2009, but it was moved to June 2. The title of the album was announced on February 26, 2009.\nThe album cover artwork and all the liner note artwork was hand drawn by Dave Matthews. Matthews said he \"had good fun making it.\" The cover illustration featured a drawing of his recently deceased bandmate LeRoi Moore. Dave's original idea for the cover was not to depict LeRoi but to simply illustrate a Mardi Gras scene. As Dave worked on the art he found that the face of the character in the center gradually began looking more and more like LeRoi until it morphed into his likeness.\nThe album cover was fully revealed on April 13.  In the previous four days, sections of the cover were slowly revealed; the cover was divided into nine pieces and revealed one piece a day for the first several days, and then several pieces the last two days before the final reveal.  The art was ultimately revealed by shuffling the pieces in a digital sliding puzzle, where the person has to rearrange the puzzle correctly.  Once correct, the center piece was revealed to show the full picture.\nTitle\nIn an April 2009 interview with MTV, Dave Matthews and Carter Beauford described the origins of the two-pronged name of the album.\nBeauford described the word \"GrooGrux\" as not only a nickname for LeRoi Moore, but also a nickname for himself, Tim Reynolds, and former collaborator Tim Wicks. Beauford said the made-up word was used to describe the \"vibe\" and \"energy\" of their \"wild-sounding rhythms\" they made when they started playing music together. Beauford also mentioned that Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard and violinist Boyd Tinsley were now graduates of \"The GrooGrux Academy.\"\nMatthews said the origins of \"Big Whiskey\" came from a chance encounter with a local New Orleans drunk during a photo shoot for the new album. When the band was shooting promotional photos outside of Preservation Hall in the French Quarter of New Orleans, they encountered a local man playing harmonica who was asking tourists for money so he could buy \"a big whiskey.\" Lessard gave Matthews a $20 bill to hand the man, who walked off in celebration. Trumpet player Rashawn Ross then suggested the phrase for the title of the album, which Matthews liked because people would not have to call the album by the more difficult to say \"GrooGrux\".\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = The A.V.

The pass was active from April 21, 2009 until September 22, 2009, and tracks were automatically downloaded as they became available.  On September 9, with the release of iTunes 9, came the Big Whiskey LP, where one can play the music while reading the lyrics, as well as new art by Dave Matthews.\nPersonnel\nDave Matthews Band\n*Carter Beauford – drums, percussion\n*Stefan Lessard – bass guitar\n*Dave Matthews – guitar, vocals\n*LeRoi Moore – saxophone\n*Boyd Tinsley – violin\nFeatured musicians\n*Tim Reynolds – guitar\n*Rashawn Ross – trumpet\n*Jeff Coffin – saxophone\nAdditional musicians\n*Danny Barnes – banjo\n*Rob Cavallo – occasional organ and piano\n*Joe Lawlor – additional guitar\n*Jamie Muhoberac – keyboards, organ\n*Tim Pierce – additional guitar\n*Roger Joseph Manning Jr. – keyboards\n*Mr. Okra – produce vendor\n*Strings\n**Joel Derouin – concertmaster\n**Charlie Bisharat, Jacqueline Brand, Roberto Cani, Susan Chatman, Mario de Leon, Alan Grunfeld, Gerardo Hilera, Sharon Jackson, Natalie Leggett, Sid Page, Alyssa Park, Vladimir Polimatidi, Michele Richards, Philip Vaiman, Josefina Vergara, Laurence Greenfield, Miwako Watanabe – violin\n**Andrew Duckles , Robert Brophy, Victoria Miskolczy, Karen Elaine, Matt Funes, Darrin McCann – viola\n**Steve Richards , Chris Ermacoff, Suzie Katayama , Armen Ksajikian, Dane Little, George Kim Scholes, Rudolph Stein – cello\n**Nico Abondolo , Timothy Eckert – bass\nProduction\n*Rob Cavallo – producer\n*Doug McKean – engineer\n*Lars Fox, Dan Chase – Pro Tools engineers\n*Wesley Fontenot, Rob Evans, Floyd Reitsma, Sam Hofstedt, Josh Evans, Paul Suarez, Steve Rea, Russ Waugh, Aaron Walk – assistant engineers\n*David Campbell – string arrangements and conducting (6, 8, 12)\n*Chris Lord-Alge – mixing (1, 2)\n*Doug McKean – mixing (3-13)\n*Keith Armstrong, Nik Karpen – assistant mix engineers (1, 2)\n*Brad Townsend – additional mix engineering (1, 2)\n*Ted Jensen – mastering\n*Henry Luniewski – drum tech\n*Jerry Johnson – drum and saxophone tech\n*Craig Baker – guitar tech\n*Erik Porter – bass and violin tech\n*Dave Matthews – illustration and art direction\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Chart performance for Big Whiskey & the GrooGrux King\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2009)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|64\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
