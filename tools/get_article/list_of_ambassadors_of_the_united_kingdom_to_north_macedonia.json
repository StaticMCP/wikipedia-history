The British embassy in Skopje was opened on that day. The naming dispute was resolved in February 2019 when the country became the Republic of North Macedonia.\nAmbassadors\n*1993&ndash;1997: Tony Millson\n*1997&ndash;2001: Mark Dickinson\n*2001&ndash;2004: George Edgar\n*2004&ndash;2007: Robert Chatterton Dickson\n*2007&ndash;2010: Andrew Key\n*2010&ndash;2014: Christopher Yvon\n*2014&ndash;2018: Charles Garrett\n*2018-2022; Rachel Galloway\n*2022-current; Matthew Lawson\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/macedonia UK and Macedonia], gov.uk"
