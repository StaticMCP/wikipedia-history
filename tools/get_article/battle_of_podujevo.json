These events started after the death of a policeman who was killed by KLA militants in the area.\nBattle\nThe Battle occurred between 23–27 December 1998. Yugoslav forces had the goal of destroying the ZOLL (Operative Zone of Llap) headquarters of the KLA. Before reaching the village of the ZOLL headquarters, the Yugoslav forces were met with strong resistance of the KLA at Tabe. On December 25th, KLA fighters ambushed a police car in the village of Zakut in the Podujevo municipality and in the city centre, explosives were hurled at the homes of local Serbian police officers. Fighting in Podujevo continued until December 27, when Yugoslav Army (VJ) forces secured the town following the withdrawal of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). On the same day, Yugoslav police attempted to capture Llapashtica, but were ambushed by KLA fighters en route. The KLA reportedly used 120-millimeter mortars, destroying two armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and wounding three officers. Although Yugoslav police repelled the ambush, the KLA held their positions in the village. Diplomats indicated that the KLA in Llapashtica was also open to negotiations. According to international monitors who contributed to Operation Eagle Eye, this battle shattered a ceasefire called on by foreign forces. At the conclusion of the fighting, the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission monitored a convoy of Yugoslav Army vehicles.\nReferences"
