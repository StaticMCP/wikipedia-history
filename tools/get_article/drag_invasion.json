It follows the phenomenon of the arrival in Lima of the drag queens from the reality show RuPaul's Drag Race in 2017. It is the first film of Castro's documentary trilogy about LGBTIQ+ in Peru following Salir del clóset (2022) and Lima Is Burning (2023).\nSynopsis\nIn 2017, dozens of drag queens from the international competition reality show RuPaul's Drag Race arrived in Lima, Peru and sold out each of their performances. This is the chronicle of an unsuspected phenomenon that mobilized and empowered the LGBT+ community, in a country that is still extremely conservative, religious and homophobic.\nCast\n* Tany de la Riva\n* Georgia Hart\n* Sandra Picciotti\n* Renzo Sáenz\n* Oliver Ramos\n* Carola Gutiérrez\nRelease\nDrag Invasion had its world premiere on November 19, 2020, at the 6th University of Lima Film Week, then screened on December 4, 2020, at Cinestesia, on May 27, 2021, at the 31st Inside Out Film Festival, on October 16, 2021, at the New York LGBTQ+ Film Festival, and at the beginning of March 2023 at the 26th Málaga Film Festival in the Latam Focus section, which paid tribute to Peru as a special guest country.
