He was foaled in 1952, and throughout his racing career in the 1960s he was owned by Jim Reade. He was usually ridden by George Small, and after the 1962 season was trained by Tim Forster. He raced in point-to-points and hunter 'chases; to be eligible for these races, he was qualified with the Old Berkshire Hunt. During his career, Baulking Green drew attention to the tiny village of Baulking, Oxfordshire (until 1974 part of Berkshire).\nCareer record\n*1961 2213 10-3&nbsp;lb\n*1962 f1f1(disq)111 11-10&nbsp;lb 3rd top-rated hunter chaser\n*1964 b11112 11-13&nbsp;lb 2nd top-rated hunter chaser\n*1965 1111 12-2&nbsp;lb champion hunter chaser\n*1966 1u111 12-0&nbsp;lb champion hunter chaser\n*1967 11f1f 12-0&nbsp;lb joint champion hunter chaser\n*1968 2 11-7&nbsp;lb 6th top-rated hunter chaser\n*1969 7 11-1st\nGeoffrey Sale (from whose annual publication Hunter Chasers & Point-to-Pointer the above is taken) wrote in the 1968 annual that Baulking Green was “just about the most gallant animal that ever looked through a bridle”.\nSale wrote of Baulking Green’s last race: “Broke down behind What A Myth at Newbury (on three legs from two out but would not be pulled up).
