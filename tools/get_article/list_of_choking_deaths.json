V. Soong (76), former premier of Republic of China\n* 1978: Dingle Foot (72), well known British politician and brother to future Labour Party Leader Michael Foot died in a Hong Kong hotel after choking on bone in a chicken sandwich.\n* 1980: John Bonham (32), Led Zeppelin drummer.  Bonham had consumed around 40 shots (1–1.4 litres) of 40% ABV vodka in a 24 hour period, after which he vomited and choked (a condition known as pulmonary aspiration). The finding was accidental death.\n* 1980: Bon Scott (33) the lead vocalist and lyricist of the hard rock band AC/DC The official report of the coroner concluded that Scott had died of \"acute alcohol poisoning (which made him choke to death on his own vomit)\" and classified it as \"Death by misadventure\".\n* 1981: Christy Brown (49)\n* 2009: Christopher Nolan (43), Irish poet and author.\n* 2015: Praful Bidwai (66), Indian journalist and activist, died by choking on food on 23 June 2015 at a conference in Amsterdam.\n* 2017: American rapper Prodigy (42) of Mobb Deep, died by accidental choking.\n* 2024: Venezuelan olympic track cyclist Daniela Larreal (50), died by choking on food  in Las Vegas, on 11 August 2024.\nIn popular culture\n* Singer Cass Elliot did not die from choking on a ham sandwich, as has been alleged.\n* In the mockumentary film This is Spinal Tap, the band's former drummer, Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs, is said to have died after he \"choked on vomit\" and that \"it was actually someone else’s vomit\". (This is almost certainly a parody of the deaths of real-life rock stars John Bonham and Bon Scott, as cited above.)\nReferences"
