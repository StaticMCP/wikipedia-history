On April 2, it was then postponed again with a new date to be determined later. By May, it was rescheduled for July 12.\nThe Puerto Rico primary is an open primary, with the territory awarding 59 delegates, of which 51 are pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nRepublican primary\nThe Republican Party of Puerto Rico held an online poll of party leaders on June 5, 2020, in lieu of an actual primary, awarding all 23 of its pledged delegates to the 2020 Republican National Convention to incumbent President Donald Trump.\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/PR-D The Green Papers Democratic Party delegate allocation summary]\n*[https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/PR-R The Green Papers Republican Party delegate allocation summary]\n*[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yVPe23muQE-V6RGBlAA8zz9VJRIaggG4/view Puerto Rico Democratic Party delegate selection plan]"
