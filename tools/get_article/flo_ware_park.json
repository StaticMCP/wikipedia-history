It was named for Flo Ware in 1982.\nDescription and history\nThe 21,600-square-foot park is located at the southeast corner of 28th Avenue South and South Jackson Street. The city purchased the land for $46,000 in 1969, and the park was named after the African-American community activist Flo Ware in 1982.\nThe park has a playground, a half basketball court, benches, and a lawn. The entrance has a sculpture inspired by Ware with the phrases \"build community\" and \"get involved\". Among murals at the park is Find Yourself Outside, which depicts \"Black people in a Pacific Northwest landscape swimming, paddleboarding, dancing, camping, and exploring the urban outdoors\", according to the South Seattle Emerald.\nFile:Seattle, WA (August 2024) - 65.jpg|Sculpture at entrance\nFile:Seattle, WA (August 2024) - 66.jpg|Playground\nFile:Seattle, WA (August 2024) - 67.jpg|Sign about Flo Ware\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Seattle Parks and Recreation"
