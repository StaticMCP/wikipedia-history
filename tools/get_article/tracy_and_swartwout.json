His paternal grandmother Martha Sherman Evarts and maternal grandmother Mary Evarts were the sisters of William M. Evarts. Evarts Tracey graduated from Yale in 1890.\nEgerton Swartwout (1870–1943) was the first son of Satterlee Swartwout and Charlotte Elizabeth Edgerton (daughter of Ohio Representative Alfred Peck Edgerton). Swartwout graduated from Yale University in 1891.\nBoth Swartwout and Tracy had trained and worked as draftsmen with the renowned firm, McKim, Mead and White.\nFrom 1904-1909, Tracy and Swartwout were joined by architect James Riely Gordon, forming the firm Gordon, Tracy & Swartwout.\nIn 1909-1912 the firm was joined by Electus Darwin Litchfield, a graduate of the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and the Stevens Institute of Technology. The firm was at this time named Tracy, Swartwout & Litchfield.\nEvarts Tracy died January 31, 1922, in France, of chronic myocarditis. Egerton Swartwout continued working on his own after Evarts Tracy's death.\nBuildings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Date\n! Name\n! Image\n! Location\n!
