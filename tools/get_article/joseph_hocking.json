      "text": "# Joseph Hocking\n\nJoseph Hocking (7 November 1860&nbsp;– 4 March 1937) was a Cornish novelist and United Methodist Free Church minister.\nLife\nHocking was born at St Stephen-in-Brannel, Cornwall, to James Hocking, part-owner of a tin mine, and his wife Elizabeth (Kitto) Hocking.\nIn 1884, he was ordained as a Methodist minister. Working in different parts of England over the next few years, he wrote his first novel, Harry Penhale - The Trial of his Faith, while in London in 1887. He regarded fiction as a highly effective medium for conveying his Christian message to the public, and combined his writing with his church duties, until ill health forced him to resign from the ministry in 1909. His last pastoral charge was the large and important United Free Church at Woodford, Essex, which he was instrumental in having rebuilt by the advanced arts and crafts architect, Charles Harrison Townsend.\nOn his recovery, he found himself a much sought-after preacher across Britain, and he travelled extensively in the Middle East.\nHe continued to write, and over the course of his career, he was the author of nearly 100 books. Although largely forgotten now, he was tremendously popular in his day.\nHe died in St Ives, Cornwall, and was survived by his wife, Annie, who he had married in 1887, and four daughters, three of whom become published novelists in their own right (Anne Hocking, Elizabeth Nisot and Joan Shill). A son, Cuthbert, was killed in World War I].\nThrough his mother he was related to the biblical scholar John Kitto. His brother was Silas Hocking (1850–1935), a novelist and Methodist minister, and his sister, Salome Hocking (1859–1927), was also a novelist.\nHocking features as one of the main characters in the 2009 play Surfing Tommies by Cornish playwright, Alan M. Kent.\nJoseph Hocking's ashes were buried in the churchyard of St Stephen-in-Brannel.\nSelected works\n*Harry Penhale, the Trial of his Faith (1887)\n*Gideon Strong, Plebeian (1888)\n*Jabez Easterbrook: a Religious Novel (1890)\n*The Weapons of Mystery (1890)\n*Elrad the Hic: a Romance of the Sea of Galilee (1890)\n*Zillah: A Romance (1892)\n*Ishmael Pengelly, an Outcast (1893)\n*The Story of Andrew Fairfax (1893)\n*The Monk of Mar-Saba (1894)\n*The Mist on the Moors: a Romance of North Cornwall (1895)\n*Fields of Fair Renown (1896)\n*And Shall Trelawney Die? and, The Mist on the Moors: being Romances of the Parish of Altarnun in Cornwall (1897)\n*The Birthright: being the Adventurous History of Jaspar Pennington (1897)\n*Mistress Nancy Molesworth: a Tale of Adventure  (1898)\n*The Scarlet Woman; a Novel (1899)\n*The Purple Robe (1900)\n*The Madness of David Baring (1900)\n*''O'er Moor and Fen: a Tale of Methodist Life in Lancashire (1901)\n*Lest We Forget (1901)\n*Greater Love: a Cornish Romance (1902)\n*A Flame of Fire (1903)\n*Follow the gleam: a Tale of the time of Oliver Cromwell (1903) A Historical novel about the English Civil War\n*Esau and St. Issey (1904)\n*The Coming of the King (1904)\n*Roger Trewinion (1905)\n*The Chariots of the Lord (1905)\n*The Man who Rose Again (1906)\n*The Woman of Babylon (1907)\n*''A Strong Man's Vow (1907)\n*The Trampled Cross (1907)\n*The Soul of Dominic Wildthorne (1908)\n*The Sword of the Lord: a Romance of the Time of Martin Luther (1909)\n*The Prince of This World (1910)\n*The Wilderness (1911)\n*The Jesuit (1911)\n*The Bells of St Ia (1911)\n*Is Home Rule Rome Rule?
