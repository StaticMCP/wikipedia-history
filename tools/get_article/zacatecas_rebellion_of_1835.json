The governor himself, Francisco García Salinas, led an army of about 4,000 men against the government. To end the rebels, President Santa Anna in person went to fight, leaving the presidency in charge of General Miguel Barragán.\nGarcía Salinas was defeated in the Battle of Zacatecas (1835). Santa Anna allowed his troops to loot the city, then, and as punishment for the rebellion, the state of Zacatecas lost part of its territory, which formed the state of Aguascalientes.\nThis military action removed the final obstacles to centralism and led to the constitution of December 30, 1835, known as Siete Leyes, which limited the right to vote and removed the political and financial autonomy previously held by Mexican states.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
