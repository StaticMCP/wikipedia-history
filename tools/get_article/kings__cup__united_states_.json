Both teams joined the second-tier league (then known as the United Soccer League) in 2015. Like the cities of both clubs, the rivalry takes its name from King Louis of France, (though not the same one – Louisville is named after Louis XVI while St. Louis after Louis IX,) which also explains the presence of the fleur-de-lis in both city flags and both teams' crests.\nThe rivalry officially began in both clubs' inaugural match as STLFC traveled to Louisville for their opening match in the 2015 USL season. LouCity won the match 2–0, setting the tone for the rivalry, with STLFC only winning twice as of July 18, 2020, and only earning one USL Playoffs appearance against LouCity's two USL titles. Their second match a month and a half later in St. Louis cemented the rivalry status with a 3–3 shootout that included eight yellow cards.\nDue to financial challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming creation of St. Louis City SC in Major League Soccer, STLFC folded after the 2020 season. Their final game was the only Kings' Cup playoff match, won by LouCity by the same 2–0 scoreline as the very first match in Louisville.\nA renewal of the rivalry has occurred, starting in 2022 when St Louis City SC's reserve team began play with the Division 3 league MLS Next Pro. The two clubs faced off in a pre-season match on March 5, 2022, in St. Louis as well as in the third round of the 2023 U.S. Open Cup. Future preseason or U.S. Open Cup matches between St Louis City SC and Louisville City FC are expected.\nAll-time results\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!width=15|#\n!width=120|Date\n!width=80|Competition\n!width=110|Venue\n!width=120|Home team\n!width=35|Score\n!width=120|Away team\n!width=360|Goalscorers\n!width=30|Attendance\n|-\n|1.||March 28, 2015|| USL ||Louisville Slugger Field|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|2–0|| Saint Louis ||(H) Rasmussen, Adams(A)||6,067\n|-\n|2.||May 24, 2015|| USL ||World Wide Technology Soccer Park|| Saint Louis ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#dddddd;\"|3–3|| Louisville||(H) Lynch, Ambersley, Gaul(A) Fondy x2, Polak||4,783\n|-\n|3.||May 30, 2015|| USL ||Louisville Slugger Field|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#dddddd;\"|1–1|| Saint Louis ||(H) Dacres(A) Renken||7,185\n|-\n|4.||Sept.19, 2015|| USL ||World Wide Technology Soccer Park|| Saint Louis ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#00b000;\"|2–1|| Louisville||(H) Hardware, Bryce(A) McCabe||5,662\n|-\n|5.||May 14, 2016|| USL ||Louisville Slugger Field|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|2–0|| Saint Louis ||(H) Davis, Lancaster(A)||6,067\n|-\n|6.||Sept.17, 2016|| USL ||World Wide Technology Soccer Park|| Saint Louis ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|1–5|| Louisville ||(H) Roberts(A) Dacres, Lancaster, Rasmussen x2, Ilić||6,004\n|-\n|7.||March 25, 2017|| USL ||Louisville Slugger Field|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#dddddd;\"|0–0|| Saint Louis ||(H)(A)||6,758\n|-\n|8.||July 22, 2017|| USL ||World Wide Technology Soccer Park|| Saint Louis ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|1–4|| Louisville ||(H) Jackson(A) Jimenez, Craig, Spencer, Lancaster||4,310\n|-\n|*||March 10, 2018|| friendly ||Arad McCutchan Stadium(Evansville, Indiana|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#dddddd;\"|1–1|| Saint Louis ||(H) McCabe(A) own goal||\n|-\n|9.||May 23, 2018|| US Open Cup ||Lynn Stadium|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|1–0|| Saint Louis ||(H) Totsch(A)||2,008\n|-\n|10.||May 18, 2019|| USL Champ. ||Louisville Slugger Field|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#dddddd;\"|0–0|| Saint Louis ||(H)(A)||9,688\n|-\n|11.||Oct.5, 2019|| USL Champ. ||World Wide Technology Soccer Park|| Saint Louis ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|0–1|| Louisville ||(H)(A) Rasmussen||4,512\n|-\n|12.||July 18, 2020|| USL Champ. ||Lynn Family Stadium|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#00b000;\"|0–1|| Saint Louis ||(H)(A) Blackwood||4,850\n|-\n|13.||August 29, 2020|| USL Champ. ||West Community Stadium|| Saint Louis ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#dddddd;\"|1–1|| Louisville ||(H) Samb(A) Totsch||0\n|-\n|14.||Sept.12, 2020|| USL Champ. ||Lynn Family Stadium|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|3–0|| Saint Louis ||(H) Hoppenot, Lancaster, Johnson(A)||4,852\n|-\n|15.||Sept. 26, 2020|| USL Champ. ||West Community Stadium|| Saint Louis ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|0–1|| Louisville ||(H)(A) Williams||0\n|-\n|*||Oct. 17, 2020|| USL Champ.playoffs ||Lynn Family Stadium|| Louisville ||style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f00ff;\"|2–0|| Saint Louis ||(H) Lancaster, own goal(A)|| 4,900\n|}\nOverall statistics\nThere have been a total of 16 competitive games (including 1 playoff match not counted toward the Kings' Cup points system) and 1 friendly between Louisville City FC and Saint Louis FC. LouCity has won 9 competitive matches (including the playoff victory) and drawn 5, with 2 wins for STLFC.\nThe largest victory in the series was a 5–1 victory for LouCity at STLFC's World Wide Technology Soccer Park.

Goal difference will serve as the first tiebreaker if the teams are tied on points, and away goals will be the second tiebreaker. If the teams are still tied after that, then the holder from the prior season keeps the Cup.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Winner\n!

The Coopers of Louisville helped convince Orlando City owners that Louisville would be a worthy landing spot for Orlando's USL franchise when the main Orlando team moved to MLS. The Louligans of St. Louis formed to support AC St. Louis and have supported a large number of professional and amateur St. Louis-area soccer teams. The two SGs decided to form the \"rivalry\" as their inaugural season in USL began as a way to make things fun between expansion partners that happened to be in relatively close geographic proximity, granting the rivalry a \"frenemy\" status. The two SGs have worked together to raise money for charity as well.\nReferences"
