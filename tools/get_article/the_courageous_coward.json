Foreign born Rei (Aoki) arrives in Chinatown and wins his heart. He goes to college to finish his law studies, leaving Rei to await his return. Rei is led to believe that she should become Americanized to please him on his return, so she learns the way of the cabarets in the company of Tom Kirby (McDonald), son of ward boss Big Bill Kirby (Hernandez).  Suki returns and is disappointed. Rei finally consents to elope with Tom, leaving Suki lost to her. A murder is committed and Suki prosecutes a suspect almost to the point of conviction when Tom confesses his guilt to him. When Suki refuses to go forward with the case, he is branded a coward and disgraced, with only Rei believing in him. At length Tom confesses to the murder and prepares to stand trial, his confession clearing Suki and leaving him free to marry Rei.\nCast\n*Sessue Hayakawa as Suki Iota\n*Tsuru Aoki as Rei Oaki\n*Toyo Fujita as Tangi\n*George Hernandez as Big Bill Kirby\n*Francis McDonald as Tom Kirby (credited as Francis J.
