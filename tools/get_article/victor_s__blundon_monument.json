They were the parents of Caroline Hyam and Mary Blundon.\nFrances Blundon was born in Loudoun County, Virginia on April 14, 1867. His training as an apprentice and journeyman carpenter prepared him for a career in home building. Working as an independent builder starting in 1892 his company built approximately 700 homes in D.C. during the first ten years of his career. He often worked alongside his brother, Joseph, who lived with other members of the Blundon family in their Georgetown home. On January 5, 1893 he married Mary Schnebel (born in Virginia, August, 1873) and they gave birth to two sons: Francis Edward and Victor Sylvester. Both eventually became salesmen for the elder Blundon's company.\nFrances Blundon built many houses in the D.C. area, primarily in the Northwest area of Washington in areas such as Bloomingdale. His brother, Robert Blundon, also worked in real estate sales, who lived with the family in the early 1900s. In their home in the 100 block of W Street, NW, they had a live-in African-American chauffeur named Frank Payner and an African-American live-in cook named Hattie Clement. This house is now owned by the Soul Saving Center Church of God. Frances Blundon's early career was with a construction firm with two other men called Blundon, O'Brian & Belt, Inc. Located at 1220 G. Street, NW, they specialized in real estate, insurance and loans.\nFrances and Mary frequented steamship vacations traveling to locations such as Bermuda in 1926. Eventually, the family moved (along with their two unmarried sons) to a 50-acre farm on Georgia Avenue in Forest Glen, Maryland in 1918 and continued to live there into the 1930s. The farm sat on property once in the Getty family. This grave depicts Victor Blundon with his beloved Irish setter.\nCondition\nThis sculpture was surveyed in 1994 for its condition and it was described as \"well maintained.\"\nSee also\n* List of public art in Washington, D.C.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0000073.htm Monument on DC Memorials]"
