Warrick joined Seven Brisbane as a newsreader in 1976 and served in the position until his retirement in 2001, including a role as co-presenter of 13 years opposite Kay McGrath. In 1991, prison escapee Harold John McSweeney surrendered to Warrick and a television helicopter crew on the Queensland Darling Downs, purportedly to avoid being shot by the Queensland Police. Warrick hosted the game show The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime in 1999—before the program was taken over by sports journalist Sandy Roberts. Warrick was also a regular host on the Australian documentary series The World Around Us. In 1994, Warrick was awarded the OAM for \"services to the media, to environment, and to the community\".\nHe died aged 76 on 11 May 2021 following a five-year battle with dementia.\nReferences"
