      "text": "# 1954 West German presidential election\n\nAn indirect presidential election (officially the 2nd Federal Convention) was held in West Germany on 17 July 1954. The government parties and the opposition SPD renominated incumbent Theodor Heuss. Against his wishes, the Communist Party of Germany nominated Alfred Weber. Heuss was reelected on the first ballot with about 85% of the vote.\nComposition of the Federal Convention\nThe president is elected by the Federal Convention consisting of all the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of delegates representing the states. These are divided proportionally by population to each state, and each state's delegation is divided among the political parties represented in its parliament so as to reflect the partisan proportions in the parliament.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:20px; margin-top:0;\"\n|+ By party\n|-\n!
