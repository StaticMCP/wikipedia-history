It holds a biennial world conference and connects cities from different parts of the world. The League also acts as a think tank for bilateral cooperation, mutual learning and best practices. It aims to strengthen affiliations between historic cities to exchange knowledge, deepen mutual understanding and build on the common foundations.\nAs of December 2014, the league was composed of 119  members from 66 countries and regions. It is in partnership with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, International Council on Monuments and Sites and the Organization of World Heritage Cities.\nThe League consists of 71 historic cities from 50 different countries, and in 2008, it was joined by Gongju (Korea), Lviv and Odesa (Ukraine), Minsk (Belarus), and Osmangazi (Turkey).\nThe purpose of the LHC, according to its statutes, is to guarantee eternal peace for future generations, to deepen human understanding through cross-national education, and to support the development of historical cities through education with the aim of promoting human understanding across national borders. The 'League of Historical Cities' is an international organization dedicated to developing and carrying out projects on an international level that are in line with its established objectives.\nWorld Conference of Historical Cities\nThe league holds a biennial world conference.\n# Kyoto 1987 \"Historical Cities in the 21st Century – Tradition and Creativity -\"\n# Florence 1988 \"Historical Cities in the Future of Mankind\"\n# Barcelona 1991 \"The Memories of and Futures of Cities\"\n# Kyoto 1994 \"In Quest of the Wisdom of Historical Cities\"\n# Xi'an 1996 \"Revival of Historical Cities\"\n# Kraków 1998 \"Heritage and Development of Historical Cities\"\n# Montpellier 2000 \"History of Value\"\n# Montreal 2003 \"Conserving and Developing – How?
