Ivan the Terrible supported Temroqwa's goal to extend his power inside Circassia and to unify the lands of Circassians under his reign. Temroqwa established a fort in Mozdok that enabled the Circassian and Russian forces to perform joint training. Ossetian and Ingushetian lands, as well as the Turkic people, became subjects of the Kabardian raising power. Temroqwa’s expansion extended towards the Georgian kingdoms in the south.\nWar\nIn 1551, on the orders of the Ottoman Sultan, the Crimean Khan Sahib Giray undertook a campaign against the Circassians. The Crimean Tatars defeated the Hatuqway army and devastated the Bzhedug lands.\nIn 1553, A large Crimean Tatar horde led by Khan Devlet Giray entered the Kabardian lands. Huge destruction was made. However, the Crimeans could not gain a foothold in Kabarda, the Kabardians expelled them. In 1554, Devlet Giray led a new campaign against Kabarda.\nIn 1555, the Crimean horde \"with all its might\" attacked Circassians again. In repulsing the enemy, the Kabardians managed to inflict great damage on Khan Devlet Gerai, who retreated.\nIn 1556, the Crimean Khan Devlet Giray at the head of the Tatar horde moved again to Kabarda. Kabardians, warned in advance, met the enemy on the outskirts of their borders. Khan Devlet Giray was forced to retreat.\nIn 1556 Temroqwa led counterattack campaign against the Tatars. He managed to expel the Tatars from the Circassian lands and to chase the fleeing troops until Taman Peninsula. There, Temroqwa established the city which is now known as Temryuk.\nAftermath\nIn 1569, in an attempt to push back the Russian forces, Tatar-Ottoman joint troops attacked the city of Astrakhan in the Khanate of Kazan. The joint troops were annihilated by a sudden attack from Temroqwa. Temroqwa kept his advance until north of the Don and established the city of known today as Novocherkassk (New Circassia) near Rostov.\nReferences"
