The party is led by chair Mary Jane Truemper. Its headquarters is located in Lincoln. It is currently the dominant party in the state, controlling all of Nebraska's three U.S. House seats, both U.S. Senate seats, the state legislature, and the governorship.\nParty history\nAfter 1860, Republicans dominated state elections in Nebraska for 30 years. The state has been strongly Republican during presidential elections.\nAs a result of a referendum in 1934, Nebraska has the United States' only unicameral legislature, known as the Nebraska Unicameral. All representatives are officially nonpartisan. Despite this, Republicans have held a majority in the state legislature for several decades.\nPolitical campaigns\nIn December 2009, the party organized a nationwide effort to unseat Democratic Senator Ben Nelson in 2012 under the theme \"Give Ben The Boot\".\nFor the 2024 United States elections, the state party made the unorthodox decision to support none of Nebraska's five incumbents throughout the primary season. The party endorsed opponents to Don Bacon, Adrian Smith and Pete Ricketts and did not endorse Deb Fischer nor Mike Flood in their races. All incumbents prevailed by large margins in their primary races; the closest was Bacon with a 24-point difference.\nCurrent elected officials\nThe Nebraska Republican Party currently controls all six statewide offices, both of the state's U.S. Senate seats, and all of the state's U.S. House seats.\nMembers of Congress\nU.S. Senate\nFile:Sen.
