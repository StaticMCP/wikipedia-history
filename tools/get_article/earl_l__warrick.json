He earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree in 1943 from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh.\nCareer\nWarrick joined Dow Corning in 1943.  In the early days of World War II, while investigating methods for producing synthetic rubber, Warrick combined silicone oil with boric oxide.  This resulted in a pliable, elastic, nontoxic substance that was not suitable as a rubber substitute.  Its potential as a toy was recognized by a toy store owner and was successfully marketing as Silly Putty. Warrick played a central role in the invention and development of silicone rubber. He later managed an operation that produced silicon for microchips. He retired from Corning in 1976, having produced 44 patents.  In retirement, he twice served as acting dean of the School of Science, Engineering and Technology at Saginaw Valley State University in Midland, Michigan.\nDeath\nWarrick died in his home in Loma Linda, California, at the age of 91 on November 15, 2002.\nExternal links\n*\n*\nReferences"
