The expedition began on 11 October 2009, with Frank de Winne becoming the first ESA astronaut to command a space mission.\nThe handover between Expedition 20 and Expedition 21 required three Soyuz vehicles being docked to the station at the same time, the first time this has occurred.\nSoyuz TMA-16 brought the final members of Expedition 21 to the ISS, along with space tourist Guy Laliberté. Laliberté returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-14 with two members of Expedition 20 on 11 October 2009.\nNicole P. Stott was the last ISS expedition crew member to fly on the Space Shuttle. She returned to Earth aboard STS-129 in November 2009.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!First Part(October to November 2009)\n!Second Part(November to December 2009)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=3 align=center| Frank De Winne, ESASecond and last spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 1\n|colspan=3 align=center| Roman Romanenko, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 2\n|colspan=3 align=center| Robert Thirsk, CSASecond and last Spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 3\n|align=center colspan=3| Jeffrey N.
