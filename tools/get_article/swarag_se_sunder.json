The primary plot of the movie is similar to Meri Bhabhi (1969) directed by Khalid Akhtar. The film is a remake of the Telugu film Thalli Prema. It was one of the highest grossing movies of Hindi films in 1986.\nPlot\nThe film begins in a village where Sarpanch Vijay Kumar Choudhary, an honorable, is lively with his ideal wife Laxmi and younger brother Ravi, who adores the couple as a deity. Since Vijay dedicated his time to the amelioration of the village and oversees Lakshmi, they are childless. Milawat Ram, who holds a grocery store, conducts malpractice when Vijay starts up a government store that begrudges him. Parallelly, Pannalal, the malevolent brother-in-law of Milawat Ram, avenges since Vijay has knitted his son with a needy girl. In tandem, Ravi loves and marries Lalita, a benevolent daughter of Milawat Ram. Laxmi and Lalita are cordial, and they build a merry world. The two conceive and deliver at once when Laxmi is blessed with a baby boy, but Lalita goes through a miscarriage. During that plight, Vijay and Lakshmi sacrifice their one to safeguard Lalita, which Ravi, too, unbeknownst. After that, friction arises in the family, signifying the split. Herein, Milawat Ram and Pannalal are in cahoots and instigate Ravi to seek his share when Lalita prompts him. Listening to it, Vijay collapses and surrenders totality to Ravi and quits. Ravi is disgusted by Lalita but learns that Pannalal coerces her to seize the kid. Thus, Vijay and Ravi cease Pannalal, safeguarding the boy when Milawat Ram reforms. At last, Ravi and Lalita affirm that they know the truth and return the child to Vijay and Laxmi. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note.\nCast\n*Jeetendra as Vijay Choudhary\n*Mithun Chakraborty as Ravi Choudhary\n*Jaya Prada as Laxmi Choudhury\n*Padmini Kolhapure as Lalita Choudhary\n*Prem Chopra as Pannalal\n*Kader Khan as Milawatram\n*Asrani as Meowalal Kannu Saraswat\n*Satyendra Kapoor as Rahim Chacha\n*Bharat Bhushan as Dr. Shiraz\n*Shoma Anand\n*Aruna Irani as Phoolmati\n*Shubha Khote as Bandharlekha\n*Neeta Mehta as Dr. Leelavathi\n* Kartar Singh Sikh man in the village crowd\nSoundtrack\nThe music for the film was composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!
