It was a moderate hit, reaching number 12 on the UK Singles Chart, number 23 in Canada, and number 34 in the United States on the U.S. pop singles chart.\nIt was the group's final single with drummer John Steel, who left shortly after its release. He was replaced by Barry Jenkins, who would go on to play with Eric Burdon and the Animals.\nBackground\nThe song is very loosely based on a prison work chant entitled \"Rosie,\" attributed to C. B. and Axe Gang, that was collected by musicologist Alan Lomax and released in his album Popular Songbook. As a result, the Animals' interpretation is credited to John and Alan Lomax with Eric Burdon and Chas Chandler.\nReception\nCash Box described the single as a \"raunchy, pulsating blues-soaked plea in which a rejected fella begs his ex-girlfriend to return to him.\"\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1966)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Canada\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|-\n|UK Singles (The Official Charts Company)\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|34\n|}\nCover versions\n*In 2001, Eric Burdon released a live cover on Official Live Bootleg 2000.\n* Japanese group sounds band The Mops covered the song on their 1968 album Psychedelic Sound in Japan.

It was not only their sole UK Top 40 hit, but also a concert staple of the band for years and is included on their Live Album.\n* The Ann Arbor, Michigan-based 1960s garage rock band The Rationals covered the song in a medley with Smokestack Lightning.
