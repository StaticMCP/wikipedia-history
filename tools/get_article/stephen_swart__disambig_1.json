He began his professional career with British team, ANC-Halfords and rode the 1987 Tour de France with them. After the ANC team folded later that year, he rode for American teams.\nWith the Motorola team, he participated in the 1994 and 1995 Tour de France. He won the Herald Sun Tour (Australia) and the Tour of Canada.\nSwart's older brother, Jack, was a top amateur cyclist.\nIn the 1986 Commonwealth Games he competed in the 4000m team pursuit, the team came second for silver; and in the 4000m individual pursuit.\nDoping and cheating revelations\nPrompted by his son's taking up racing, Swart spoke up about doping in cycling. He described Lance Armstrong, his Motorola teammate, as one of the strongest advocates of doping when the team decided to dope.  “He was the instigator,” Swart told Sports Illustrated. “It was his words that pushed us toward doing it.”  Swart also described his own doping.\nWhen he initially made his disclosures, he was vilified and called a loser. Later, in 2012, he was named the 'New Zealander of the Year' for having told the truth.\nSwart also testified, under oath in 2006, that he was paid $50,000 to lose a race, by Armstrong.\nMajor results\n;1988\n: 8th Fleche Hesbignonne\n: 9th Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan\n;1989\n: 7th Philly Cycling Classic\n;1991\n: 6th Thrift Drug Classic\n;1992\n: 1st  National Criterium Championships\n: 1st Stage 3 Tour of the Adirondacks\n: 2nd Overall Celestial Bicycle Classic\n::1st Stages 1 & 2\n: 5th Overall Herald Sun Tour\n::1st Stages 10 & 11\n;1993\n: 1st Stage 11 Herald Sun Tour\n;1994\n: 9th Wincanton Classic\n;1995\n: 4th Overall Tour of Luxembourg\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|colspan=19 align=\"center\"|Grand Tour general classification results timeline\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Grand Tour\n! scope=\"col\" | 1987\n! scope=\"col\" | 1988\n! scope=\"col\" | 1989\n! scope=\"col\" | 1990\n! scope=\"col\" | 1991\n! scope=\"col\" | 1992\n! scope=\"col\" | 1993\n! scope=\"col\" | 1994\n! scope=\"col\" | 1995\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\" |  Giro d'Italia\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\" |  Tour de France\n| DNF\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| 112\n| 109\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\" |  Vuelta a España\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|}\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*"
