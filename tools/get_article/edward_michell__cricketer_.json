He was educated at Harrow School, where he played for the school cricket team. Michell later made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Hampshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Southampton in 1880. Batting once in the match, he was dismissed for 7 runs in Hampshire's only innings by Robert Clayton, with Hampshire winning the match by an innings and 38 runs. He later emigrated to New Zealand, where he died at Cranmer Square in Christchurch on 5 May 1900. His brother, Charles, was also a first-class cricketer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
