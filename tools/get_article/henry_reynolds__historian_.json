He was the first academic historian to advocate for Indigenous land rights, becoming known with his first major work, The Other Side of the Frontier (1981).\nEarly life and education\nHenry Reynolds was born in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1938, the son of John Reynolds, who was a journalist who wrote the first biography of Edmund Barton.\nHe attended Hobart High School.\nFollowing this, he attended the University of Tasmania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in History in 1960, later gaining a Master of Arts in 1964.\nCareer\nReynolds taught in secondary schools in Australia and England.\nHe joined the academic staff at Townsville University College (later James Cook University) in 1966 to teach. In the 1970s, he undertook an oral history project. He served as associate professor of history and politics from 1982 until his retirement in 1998.\nIn 2000 Reynolds became professorial fellow at the University of Tasmania in Launceston.\n, Reynolds was Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Tasmania.\nHistorical research and publications\nThe Other Side of the Frontier, published in 1981, was ground-breaking in that it was the first major work by an historian to write Australian history from an Aboriginal perspective.\nIn many books and academic articles Reynolds has sought to explain his view of the high level of violence and conflict involved in the colonisation of Australia, and the Aboriginal resistance to numerous massacres of Indigenous people. Reynolds, along with many other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 Europeans and at least 20,000 Aboriginal Australians were killed directly in the frontier violence, and many more Aboriginal peoples died indirectly through the introduction of European diseases and starvation caused by being forced from their productive tribal lands.\nGeoffrey Blainey and Keith Windschuttle categorise his approach as a black armband view of Australian history. In 2002, Windschuttle, in his book ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803–1847, disputed whether the colonial settlers of Australia committed widespread genocide against Indigenous Australians, and accused Reynolds of misrepresenting, inventing, or exaggerating evidence. Subsequently, in Whitewash: on Keith Windschuttle's fabrication of Aboriginal history'' (2003; edited by Robert Manne), it was argued that Windschuttle failed to meet the criteria that he used to assess \"orthodox historians\" and his accusations were thus flawed.\nFriendship with Eddie Mabo\nReynolds struck up a friendship with Eddie Mabo, who was employed as a groundsman and gardener at James Cook University from 1967 to 1975. Reynolds, as well as his wife Margaret, were supporters of the Black Community School in South Townsville, which Mabo was instrumental in establishing, and which operated from 1973 to 1985. The Reynolds', as respected members of the Townsville academic community, publicly defended the school when it came under attack from the local Townsville Daily Bulletin newspaper as well as some local politicians in September 1973.\nIn his book ''Why Weren't We Told?'', Reynolds describes the talks they had regarding Mabo's people's rights to their lands, on Murray Island, in the Torres Strait. Reynolds writes:\nEddie [...] would often talk about his village and about his own land, which he assured us would always be there when he returned because everyone knew it belonged to his family. His face shone when he talked of his village and his land.\nSo intense and so obvious was his attachment to his land that I began to worry about whether he had any idea at all about his legal circumstances. [...] I said something like: \"You know how you've been telling us about your land and how everyone knows it's Mabo land? Don't you realise that nobody actually owns land on Murray Island? It's all crown land.\"\nHe was stunned. [...] How could the whitefellas question something so obvious as his ownership of his land?\nReynolds looked into the issue of Indigenous land ownership in international law, and encouraged Mabo to take the matter to court. \"It was there over the sandwiches and tea that the first step was taken which led to the Mabo judgement in June 1992\". Mabo then talked to lawyers, and Reynolds \"had little to do with the case itself from that time\", although he and Mabo remained friends until the latter's death in January 1992. Reynolds' 1970s oral history project however contributed to the High Court's recognition of land rights.\nOther activities\nIn September 2022, Reynolds appeared with filmmaker Rachel Perkins at a National Press Club of Australia address, soon after the airing of Perkins' SBS Television series, The Australian Wars.\nAwards and honours\nHenry Reynolds has received the following awards and honours:\n*1970–71 British Council Travelling Scholarship\n*1982 Ernest Scott Historical Prize for The Other Side of the Frontier\n*1986 Harold White Fellowship, National Library of Australia\n*1988 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Arts Award for The Law of the Land\n*1996 Australian Book Council Award: the Banjo Award for non-fiction\n*1998 Doctor of Letters (honoris causa), University of Tasmania\n*1999 Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (FASSA)\n*1999 Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA)\n*1999 Human Rights Commission Arts Non-Fiction Award\n*2000 Queensland Premier's Literary Awards Literary Work Advancing Public Debate – the Harry Williams Award for ''Why Weren't We Told?''\n*2000 Australian Humanist of the Year Award\n*2008: With Professor Marilyn Lake, Queensland Premier's Literary Awards History Book Award for Drawing the Global Colour Line\n*2009: With Marilyn Lake, the non-fiction category of the Prime Minister's Literary Awards for Drawing the Global Colour Line\n* 2012: Honorary Doctor of Letters from James Cook University\nConference\nIn tribute to Reynolds' seventieth year, the conference Race, Nation, History: A Conference in Honour of Henry Reynolds was held in August 2008.
