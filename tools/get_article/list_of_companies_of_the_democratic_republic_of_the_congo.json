It is the second largest country in Africa by area and the eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 120 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most populous officially Francophone country.\nSparsely populated in relation to its area, the country is home to a vast potential of natural resources and mineral wealth, its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US$24 trillion, yet the economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has declined drastically since the mid-1980s. At the time of its independence in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa; it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive. Since then, however, corruption, war and political instability have been a severe detriment to further growth, today leaving DRC with the world's lowest GDP per capita.\nNotable firms\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark taxonomy. Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.\n| Financials\n| Banks\n| Kinshasa\n| 1909\n| Commercial bank\n}}\nFile:Head office of ONATRA in Kinshasa (east of boulevard du 30 juin).jpg|Office National des Transports head office in Kinshasa\nFile:Regideso RDC.jpg|Regideso building in Kinshasa\nFile:First train in Kindu, DRC.jpg|Congo Railway's first train arrives in Kindu in 2004 after the rehabilitation of the line\nFile:CAA Boeing 727 Potters-1.jpg|A Compagnie Africaine d'Aviation Boeing 727 freighter aircraft departing Goma International Airport (2006)\nFile:Korongo Airlines Boeing 737-300 Wadman.jpg|A Korongo Airlines Boeing 737-300.
