It was constructed on a grand scale, symbolising its importance as the main terminus of the Jamaica railways. It has prominent arcades on both levels of the east entrance end. Victorian cast iron brackets support the roof overhang on the trackside. It has sash windows on the ground and upper floors.\nIt was opened in 1845 and closed in 1992. It provided rail services to Montego Bay, Port Antonio, Ewarton and Frankfield. In addition to the station and its single platform there were extensive sidings, engine sheds, engine repair works, a roundhouse, a turntable, a traverser and a connection to the nearby railway piers.\nOne source claims it was \"utterly destroyed\" in the 1907 Kingston earthquake. However, in 2003 it was reported as being in \"very good condition\" and needing only \"minor repairs\".\nIt is on the list of designated National Heritage Sites in Jamaica.\nSee also\n*Railway stations in Jamaica\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://wikimapia.org/#lat=18.0011367&lon=-76.9520187&z=18&l=0&m=b&v=8 Aerial view].\n*Photos:\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708110109/http://www.bwiphilately.com/jamrwy/i/King1905.jpg Kingston railway station c1905].\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708110114/http://www.bwiphilately.com/jamrwy/i/King2000.jpg Kingston railway station c2000].\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708110118/http://www.bwiphilately.com/jamrwy/Collection/Kingston/ticket02.jpg Front and back of a used first class Kingston to Montego Bay passenger ticket of 1968].\n**[http://www.bwiphilately.com/jamrwy/i/tikimg.jpg Front and back of a used second class Kingston to Spanish Town passenger ticket of 1949]."
