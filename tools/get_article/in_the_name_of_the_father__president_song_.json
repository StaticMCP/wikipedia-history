It was released on 15 May 2025 and serves as the opening track for the EP King of Terrors.\nComposition and lyrics\nThe song was the first song written by the artist, in December 2023, and is about his anxiety and struggles with religion and God. Lyrically, the song was inspired Dylan Thomas’s poem \"Do not go gentle into that good night.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"In the Name of the Father\" was released the day after the single's release on 16 May 2025. The music video is set inside a hotel, involving the eponymous frontman President who performs the song alongside the rest of the band, all wearing tuxedos. This is overlaid by several scenes intercut of President performing throughout the hotel, while the video uses heavy neon lights and the lyrical content is flashed throughout the video.\nLive performances\nThe band performed \"In the Name of the Father\" during their live debut at Download Festival on 15 June 2025.\nTrack listing\nCritical reception\nLouder Sound's  Dannii Leivers described the track as \"a thrilling slab of metalcore\" with \"a lofty chorus\" but noted a \"divisive level of autotune\" in its vocal production.\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n* The President –  production, composition\n* Zakk Cervini – mixing\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"In the Name of the Father\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)\n| 50\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles Sales (OCC)\n| 52\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Indie (OCC)\n| 41\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)\n| 19\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Hard Rock Songs (Billboard)\n| 14\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders unsortable\"\n|+ Release history and formats for \"In the Name of the Father\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Format\n! scope=\"col\" | Label\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various\n| 15 May 2025\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Kings of Terrors / ADA\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| 25 July 2025\n| Vinyl\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nReferences"
