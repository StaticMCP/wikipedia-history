A Grade II listed building, standing on the northern side of Main Street, it dates to 1767.\nThe inn was built by John Pratt, a local man who had made his fortune as a horse jockey at Newmarket Racecourse. John and Joseph Lodge purchased the pub in 1800.\nAll Creatures Great and Small\nThe pub doubled as Darrowby's Drovers Arms in the BBC television series All Creatures Great and Small (1978–1990). Photographs on its interior walls showed the cast drinking at the establishment during downtime.\nThe Drovers was made out to be located beside the church in the early series, as evidenced in the episode \"The Name of the Game\". \"It was fun to design the Drovers, which later on they did on location in Askrigg,\" explained designer David Crozier. \"But in the early days these scenes were all done at Pebble Mill.\"\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Askrigg\nGallery\nFile:Kings Arms, Askrigg, July 2011.jpg|The pub's main entrance in 2011, including a sign for W.
