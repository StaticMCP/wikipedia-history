A spin-off from the Japanese reality series Sasuke, it is hosted by Matt Iseman, Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, and Zuri Hall. This season, both Qualifying and Semifinals were entirely held in Universal City in Los Angeles, while the National Finals returned to its usual spot in Las Vegas.\nThis season set a new record with 8 competitors all advancing to Stage 4, and also crowned the third grand prize winner in Vance Walker, who not only became the fifth ninja to achieve \"Total Victory\", but had previously won American Ninja Warrior Junior twice. In the same season, Daniel Gil became the fourth ninja to achieve total victory, but completed the rope climb slower than Walker.\nThe season was officially announced by NBC in late March 2023, though the applications were being accepted from November 19, 2022, until December 16, 2022. The full list of competitors was published on March 15, 2023. Filming for qualifiers moved to Los Angeles, California, where the semifinals remained. Filming for national finals remained in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nFilming for the season began on March 15, 2023, and wrapped in early May 2023.\nObstacles\nThe qualifying course starts from Pole Vault and ends on Warped Wall. For this season, to get one attempt for the Mega Wall, which was increased to 18.5 feet high, contestants must finish the course in less than 1 minute and 20 seconds; a contestant who completes the Mega Wall still gets an immediate reward of $10,000 (promoted by Wells Fargo). Standing next to the main course is a new segment, \"The Runoffs\", which replaces the Power Tower but follows the same structure: it features four obstacles, with two copies of them located alongside each other. The two male contestants and two female contestants in the last two places on the leaderboard run it side by side for the last spot in the semifinals.\nIn the semifinals, two contestants will run against each other, side-by-side, on the previously installed Runoffs course with Slingshot and Rope Climb added as a last two obstacles. At the end of the night, the two fastest finishers will run on a Safety Pass course, which replaces some of the obstacles from Semifinals with other ones. The winner receives a Safety Pass which allows for a do-over of stage 1 in the National Finals if he or she fails.\nDenotes obstacles created by fans for the Obstacle Design Challenge.\nQualifying\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Event\n! colspan=\"6\" |Obstacles\n! colspan=\"1\"|Finish under 1:20\n|-\n!Course 1\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Pole Vault\n|Rollercoaster\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Domino Effect\n| rowspan=\"2\" |The Getaway\n|Lasso Launch\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Warped Wall\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Mega Wall\n|-\n!Course 2\n|Greased Lightning\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n!Course 3\n|Rollercoaster\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Log Runner\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Kite Surfer\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n!Course 4\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Greased Lightning\n|bgcolor=\"lightblue\"|The Cubes\n|-\n!Course 5\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Domino Effect\n|rowspan=\"2\"|The Getaway\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n!Course 6\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Rollercoaster\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Lasso Launch\n|-\n!Course 7\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Log Runner\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Kite Surfer\n|-\n!Course 8\n|Greased Lightning\n|bgcolor=\"lightblue\"|Mutant Mayhem\n|}\nRunoffs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Event\n! colspan=\"4\" |Obstacles\n|-\n!Course 1\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Home Run\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spring Forward\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Beehive\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hopscotch\n|-\n!Course 2\n|-\n!Course 3\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Flying Shelf Grab\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Sideways\n|-\n!Course 4\n|-\n!Course 5\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Spring Forward\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Hopscotch\n|-\n!Course 6\n|-\n!Course 7\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Flying Shelf Grab\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Sideways\n|-\n!Course 8\n|}\nSemifinals\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Event\n! colspan=\"6\" |Obstacles\n|-\n!Course 1\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Home Run\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Spring Forward\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Beehive\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Hopscotch\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Slingshot\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Rope Climb\n|-\n!Course 2\n|-\n!Course 3\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Flying Shelf Grab\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sideways\n|-\n!Course 4\n|}\nSafety Pass Race\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Event\n! colspan=\"6\" |Obstacles\n|-\n!Course 1\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Home Run\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Flying Shelf Grab\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Wingnuts\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Sideways\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Spin Hopper\n| rowspan=\"4\"|Rope Climb\n|-\n!Course 2\n|-\n!Course 3\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Beehive\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Slingshot\n|-\n!Course 4\n|}\nNational Finals\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"1\" | Stage\n! colspan=\"9\" | Obstacles\n! colspan=\"1\" | Time Limit\n|-\n!

In a major change from past seasons, the number of semifinalists has been reduced, and men and women have completely separate leaderboards. The top 11 men and top 3 women advance to the semifinals immediately, while the next two men (12th/13th place) and the next two women (4th/5th place) compete head-to-head in \"The Runoffs\" for the final spots.\n: Denotes expanded course (Mega Wall) finishes\n: Denotes runoff winners who advanced to semifinals\n: Denotes rookie contestants\nCourse 1\nThe first night of qualifying featured two rounds that were held in order. 5 competitors completed Course 1; only two of the competitors managed to finish the course faster than 1 minute and 20 seconds, but neither were able to successfully scale the Mega Wall. In the runoffs, Ramcis Valdez beat Alan Connealy (who made his first appearance since season 9) for the last men's spot, while Taylor Johnson beat Avery Glantz for the last women's spot. New obstacles included the Pole Vault, The Getaway, Lasso Launch, and Home Run in the runoff course. In an emotional moment, Brian Kretsch (who is one of only two competitors to appear in every single season) once again fell on a balance obstacle in the qualifying course (in this case, Domino Effect), and in his post-run interview, he hinted at a possible retirement from competition, citing his continued inability to clear balance obstacles.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Top 13 Men\n!width=\"5\"|Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Luke Dillon\n|01:18.68\n|Finished\n|-\n|2\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Noah Meunier\n|01:19.91\n|Finished\n|-\n|3\n|Jay Lewis\n|01:24.09\n|Finished\n|-\n|4\n|James McGrath\n|01:33.06\n|Finished\n|-\n|5\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Kevin Rodriguez\n|01:39.79\n|Finished\n|-\n|6\n|Najee Richardson\n|00:40.32\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|7\n|Evan Andrews\n|00:40.77\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|8\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Mazeiah Andrade\n|01:03.50\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|9\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Noah Jones\n|01:07.03\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|10\n|Verdale Benson\n|01:15.15\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|11\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Evan Bomengen\n|01:41.85\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|12\n|Alan Connealy\n|00:15.70\n|Domino Effect\n|-\n|13\n|style=\"background-color:#E5AA70\"|Ramcis Valdez\n|00:17.05\n|Domino Effect\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"display: inline-table;\"\n|+\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Addy Herman\n|01:00.23\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|2\n|Casey Rothschild\n|01:07.24\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|3\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Emily Gardiner\n|01:31.73\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|4\n|style=\"background-color:#E5AA70\"|Taylor Johnson\n|01:35.35\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|5\n|Avery Glantz\n|00:32.20\n|Domino Effect\n|}\nCourse 2\nCourse 2 occurred on the same night as the first qualifying, with 6 competitors finishing it.

Firefighter Brandon Mears, one half of the duo called the \"Towers of Power\", returned after missing last season and announced that he would be making his final run on the course, but ultimately failed on Greased Lightning.

Former American Ninja Warrior Junior contestant Taylor Greene competed on the main course for the first time after turning 15 and became the first and only woman to clear the qualifying course this season. Two veterans, Jackson Twait and Donovan Metoyer, tried to run the course speedily to get a chance to try the Mega Wall, but both failed with the latter being eliminated after he fell on Domino Effect.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Top 13 Men\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Kaden Lebsack\n|01:16.83\n|Finished\n|-\n|2\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Barry Boyd\n|01:42.21\n|Finished\n|-\n|3\n|Max Feinberg\n|01:46.60\n|Finished\n|-\n|4\n|Scott Behrends\n|02:03.93\n|Finished\n|-\n|5\n|Tyler Yamauchi\n|01:45.06\n|Warped Wall\n|-\n|6\n|Jackson Twait\n|00:46.03\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n|7\n|Ben Behrends\n|00:58.16\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n|8\n|Derrick Pavoni\n|00:58.39\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n|9\n|Chris DiGangi\n|01:09.63\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n|10\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Cade Perkins\n|01:22.08\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n|11\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Jawon Turner\n|01:49.43\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n|12\n|Drew Marinelli\n|00:33.94\n|The Getaway\n|-\n|13\n|style=\"background-color:#E5AA70\"|James Wilson\n|00:37.58\n|The Getaway\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Taylor Greene\n|02:28.40\n|Finished\n|-\n|2\n|Maggie Owen\n|01:44.80\n|Ring the Bells\n|-\n|3\n|style=\"background-color:#FA8072\"|Riley Porter\n|00:03.77\n|Greased Lightning\n|-\n|4\n|style=\"background-color:#E5AA70\"|Ally Tippetts Wooton\n|00:03.85\n|Greased Lightning\n|-\n|5\n|Kyndal McKenzie\n|\n|Greased Lightning\n|}\nCourse 6\nCourse 6 was completed by 6 competitors.

Other notable competitors included West Side Story visual effects designer Daniel Novarro, who received encouragement from two of the film's stars, Rachel Zegler and Josh Rivera, before the start of his run (Novarro was ultimately defeated in the runoffs by police officer John Uga), and veteran Nate Tackett, who advanced to the semi-finals after receiving encouragement from his cousin, legendary country music singer Crystal Gayle.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Top 13 Men\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Elliot Revak\n|01:05:92\n|Finished\n|-\n|2\n|Josiah Pippel\n|01:22.45\n|Finished\n|-\n|3\n|Jonathan Godbout\n|01:40.65\n|Finished\n|-\n|4\n|Joe Moravsky\n|00:35.88\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|5\n|Matt D'Amico\n|00:40.47\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|6\n|David Campbell\n|00:54.59\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|7\n|Ibrahim Hayek\n|00:59.09\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|8\n|Austin Baron\n|01:35.46\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|9\n|Alex Goodwin\n|00:21.04\n|The Getaway\n|-\n|10\n|Jamie Rahn\n|00:21.61\n|The Getaway\n|-\n|11\n|Nate Tackett\n|00:27.33\n|The Getaway\n|-\n|12\n|style=\"background-color:#E5AA70\"|John Uga\n|00:28.94\n|The Getaway\n|-\n|13\n|Daniel Novarro\n|00:21.51\n|Domino Effect\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Abby Clark\n|01:35.92\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|2\n|Rachel Degutz\n|01:51.77\n|Lasso Launch\n|-\n|3\n|Michelle Warnky Buurma\n|00:28.21\n|Domino Effect\n|-\n|4\n|Amy Harski\n|00:04.17\n|Rollercoaster\n|-\n|5\n|style=\"background-color:#E5AA70\"|Brittney Durant\n|00:05.22\n|Rollercoaster\n|}\nCourse 7\nCourse 7 was completed by only two competitors, with two-time American Ninja Warrior Junior champion Vance Walker taking the top time after failing to hit a single buzzer in the previous season.

This season, a new format was introduced to the semifinals in which competitors race head-to-head in pairs. They are seeded based on the overall results in the leaderboard table which is created by merging 2 leaderboards from qualifying courses with the same obstacles. During the races, all the winners and the two losers who reached the farthest obstacle in the least amount of time advanced to the National Finals, unless more than two losers finished the semi-final course, by which case they all advance with the third fastest and slower going there as reserves. Meanwhile, the two fastest winners proceed to a modified head-to-head course at the end of each night where they race for a Safety Pass, an option for a second attempt on Stage 1 of the finals.\n: Denotes losers also advancing to National Finals\n: Denotes Safety Pass winners runs\nSemifinal 1\nOn the first night of the semifinals, Taylor Greene became the first woman rookie to complete two straight obstacle courses and the only woman of the night to hit a buzzer. Two father-son duos, the Behrends and Beckstrands, attempted to advance to the National Finals together for the first time in the show's history. While Kai Beckstrand finished the course in under a minute, but his father, Brian Beckstrand, was eliminated by Max Feinberg, the Behrends: Scott and Ben Behrends both won their races to become the first father-son duo to advance together. Kai later lost to two-time reigning Last Ninja Standing Kaden Lebsack in the Safety Pass race at night's end. Notable veterans not advancing to the National Finals are Chris DiGangi and Roo Yori, who failed to make the finals for the third and sixth straight time. Professional wrestler Baron Corbin briefly joined Matt and Akbar in the broadcast booth as a guest analyst.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Race results\n!

Abby Clark and Rachel Degutz, two of the \"Jersey Girlz\", faced each other in one of the races; Degutz won and was the only woman to complete the course, in the process also hitting her first-ever buzzer. Veterans Joe Moravsky, Najee Richardson, and James McGrath won their races against teenagers (with McGrath making his first trip to the National Finals since season 10) while other veterans lost theirs and were eliminated. David Campbell, who has competed in every season of the show, took the course at his own pace instead of racing and managed to advance to the National Finals as the fastest race loser after he finished it a minute later than his idol, Evan Andrews. Though he qualified for Vegas by winning his race, veteran Sean Bryan chose to withdraw after completing Hopscotch due to feeling pain in his arm.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Race results\n!

In round 3, former American Ninja Warrior Junior competitors Vance Walker and Isaiah Thomas faced each other at the end of the night in a race for the Safety Pass, with Walker narrowly coming out on top. 15-year old Madelyn Madaras became the third woman this season to clear the semifinals course, as she won her race and advanced to the National Finals. Sandy Zimmerman won her race and earned her first trip to the National Finals after 8 years of competing after her opponent, Isabella Wakeham, shockingly fell on the second obstacle. Isabella's brother, Isaiah Wakeham, completed the course and advanced to the National Finals as the best non-race winner. Other notable veterans not advancing to the National Finals include Abel Gonzalez, Grant McCartney, Nick Hanson, and Ian Dory (who had made his first appearance since season 11).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Race results\n!

R.J. Roman took the fastest time and also won a Safety Pass after defeating Elijah Browning in the final race, finishing in under 40 seconds. Caleb Bergstrom and his wife, Ashley, made history as the first married couple to advance to the National Finals together; also advancing was Caleb's brother-in-law, David Bergstrom-Wright. David's wife (and Caleb's sister), Caitlyn Bergstrom-Wright, did not advance after being eliminated in her race by her sister-in-law, Ashley (had Caitlyn won the race, she and David would have been the first married couple to advance together instead of Caleb and Ashley). Veterans Brett Sims and Bob Reese advanced to the National Finals as the two top race losers after both of them completed the course. Two notable veterans who did not advance to the National Finals were Ryan Stratis (who appeared for the first time since season 11) and Jessie Graff.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Race results\n!

However, this season it was important for 24 contestants to advance due to changes applied to stage 2; this way, not only finishers but athletes who made it the furthest in the least amount of time would advance to the next stage. Two new obstacles were introduced in the stage this season: The Gambler and Thread the Needle. In the first night, Bob Reese successfully performed a front flip on the Jumping Spider after failing to do it in the previous season and veteran Flip Rodriguez timed out at the cargo net which does not officially count as an obstacle. During the second night, veteran Najee Richardson failed to advance in what could be his final run due to an asthma attack and R.J. Roman advanced only after using his Safety Pass when his first run saw him fall on Thread the Needle. No woman completed the stage or received a seed in Stage 2, with rookie Taylor Greene making it farther than any other, getting as far as Dipping Birds.\n: Denotes competitor who used the Safety Pass after failing on his first run.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Top 24 Competitors\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Kaden Lebsack\n|2:01.07\n|Completed\n|-\n|2\n|Evan Andrews\n|2:01.41\n|Completed\n|-\n|3\n|Caleb Bergstrom\n|2:02.32\n|Completed\n|-\n|4\n|style=\"background-color:#D4F0F0\"|R.J.

It also disallows competitors who fail to use their Safety Pass to retry the stage for the first time since its introduction. Instead, the top four losers compete with each other in two races, with the winner from each race advancing to Stage Three. One new obstacle debuted, Jawbreakers. During the races, veterans Joe Moravsky, Josiah Pippel, and Flip Rodriguez were eliminated, as well as reigning Last Ninja Standing Kaden Lebsack, who fell into the water for the first time in his three-year career.\n: Denotes the fastest non-winners who advanced to the runoffs.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Race results\n!
