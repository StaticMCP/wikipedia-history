He faced the first ball bowled in first-class cricket in Pakistan when he opened the batting for Sind against West Punjab in December 1947.\nHis best first-class performances came when he captained Sind against the touring West Indians in 1948–49; he scored 12 and 81 and took 4 for 66 and 1 for 19 in the drawn match. He was selected to play in Pakistan's first representative match a week later against the West Indians, but with little success. He was a member of Pakistan's first touring team later that season, playing in both matches against Ceylon in Colombo. He also played one of the representative matches when Ceylon toured Pakistan in 1949-50.\nWhen the England team toured in 1951–52, he made 48 in Pakistan's second innings, adding a valuable 83 for the sixth wicket with the captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, in Pakistan's four-wicket victory that secured the nation's Test status. He played in four of the five Test matches in Pakistan's inaugural series against India in 1952-53 when he was Kardar's vice-captain, but had little personal success. He announced his retirement from first-class cricket in November 1953 without citing a reason, although \"power politics... in the cricket affairs\" was speculated as the reason behind the decision.\nHussain died in Lahore on 9 October 2002 after suffering from liver cancer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
