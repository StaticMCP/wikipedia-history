Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Cabo Verde accepted the convention on April 29, 1988, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. , Cape Verde has only one World Heritage Site.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (municipality)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Cidade Velha, Historic Centre of Ribeira Grande\n|\n|Ribeira Grande\n|2009\n| 1310; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n|The town of Ribeira Grande, renamed Cidade Velha in the late 18th century, was the first European colonial outpost in the tropics.
