It appears on her debut album Stop!.\nCritical reception\nUpon its release, John Lee of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner picked \"Walking Back to Me\" as the \"single of the week\" and praised it as \"a fabulous number, borrowing the feel of early Seventies glam-rockers Sweet\". He added that it has \"got to be a big hit\". Jim Whiteford of the Dundee Evening Telegraph called it a \"strident rocker\" which shows Brown's \"certainly got power in her vocal cords and some writing talent\". He questioned its commercial potential, stating, \"Melody is not strong enough for radio use, I fear, but, if she gets a chance to perform on TV, she could well start this debut song selling.\" Marcus Hodge of the Cambridge Evening News commented, \"Blonde Sam tries too hard to give a sluggish song some lmife. Vaguely promising debut.\" Steven Wells of NME felt Brown would \"do well to rid herself of the leaden rockist backing band and get with a drum machine and a sampler\".\nTrack listings\n;CD single – DE\n#\"Walking Back to Me\"\n#\"Living In Your Own World\"\n#\"Tender Hearts\"\n#\"Leave It Be\"\n;7\" single – UK\n#\"Walking Back to Me\"\n#\"Tender Hearts\"\n;12\" single – UK\n*Side A\n#\"Walking Back to Me\"\n#\"Living In Your Own World\"\n*Side B\n#\"Tender Hearts\"\n#\"Leave It Be\"\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n*Sam Brown&nbsp;– lead vocals; piano\n*Pete Brown&nbsp;– lesley guitar; backing vocals\n*Paul Bangash&nbsp;– guitar\n*Richard Newman&nbsp;– drums\n*Jim Leverton&nbsp;– bass guitar\n*Danny Schogger&nbsp;– keyboards\n*Phil Saatchi&nbsp;– backing vocals\nCharts and sales\nPeak positions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1988)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|German Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|65\n|}\nReferences"
