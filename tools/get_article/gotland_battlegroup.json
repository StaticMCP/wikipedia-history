It has been active since 2016. The battlegroup is headquartered at Visby Garrison.\nHistory\nRemilitarisation\nIn 2004, the island of Gotland was demilitarised following reduced tensions in the Baltic Sea after the end of the Cold War, on the assumption that no immediate threat to Swedish sovereignty remained. The decision, however, left a gap in the island’s defence.\nAfter Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent deterioration of the security situation in the Baltic region, the Swedish government introduced the Defence Act of 2015, which mandated the remilitarisation of Gotland by 2018.\nEstablishment\nSwedish Chief of Defence General Micael Bydén decided to accelerate the process, bringing it forward to autumn 2016. A battlegroup, roughly equivalent to a reduced brigade, was established with the purpose of deterring small-scale attacks and delaying larger assaults until reinforcements and additional units could arrive.\nThe Skaraborg Regiment was tasked with raising the new unit and temporarily deployed elements to the island under its command, ensuring a limited defensive presence until permanent forces could be established.\nAs the Gotland Regiment was re-established and gradually regained capability, responsibility for the battlegroup was progressively transferred, and in 2020, once the battlegroup had reached full operational status, full command was formally handed over from the Skaraborg Regiment to the Gotland Regiment. of the 181st Mechanised Battalion.]]\nOrganisation\nIn peacetime, the battlegroup is cadre-organised as a subordinate unit of the Gotland Regiment, while in wartime it is placed directly under the Army Staff rather than the 1st Division, as is the case for other brigades.\nAs of 2022, the battlegroup's wartime organisation is planned to expand, with full implementation expected by 2028 at the latest:\n* 18th Battlegroup\n** 18th Battlegroup Staff\n*** 18th Headquarters Company\n*** 18th Air Defence Unit\n** 181st Mechanised Battalion\n** 18th Engineer Company\n** 18th Artillery Company\n** 18th Support Company\nGiven its specialised role, the battlegroup is not intended for deployment outside Gotland and maintains a permanent presence on the island.\nTraditions\nHarald VI, a Gute ram, is the mascot of the Gotland Regiment as well as the battlegroup.\nThe coat of arms of the battlegroup, which it shares with the Gotland Regiment, features a Gute ram symbolising strength and resilience.\nThe most common beret colour in the battlegroup is black, in accordance with the tradition of the Swedish Armoured Troops.\nThe battlegroup’s motto is , Latin for 'Always foremost'.\nCommanders\nThe commanders of the brigade throughout its history are as follows:\nAttributes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n!
