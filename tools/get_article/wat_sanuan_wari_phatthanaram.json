Constructed in the early 1920s, is known for its Isan hup taem (, 'mural painting' in Isan) depicting scenes from the Vessantara Jātaka and Sang Sinxay decorating the ordination hall (, sim). A more modern, Bangkok-style wat was constructed on the site in 1997, with the old sim remaining in place for tourists and private ceremonies. Despite its value as a work of local Isan culture, the old sim has received only minimal preservation and restoration work.\nHistory\nWat Sanuan Wari was established in 1922 and construction of its sim began after receiving a royal grant (, wisungkhamsima) on 13 April 1923. The structure was completed in 1926. To support its construction, the local people raised ฿200 (). Around 2007, the original roof was replaced with a corrugated metal roof in same style as the original wooden roof.\nThe sim, which is made of bricks and plaster, has three rooms and measures . The east-facing front wall has a Vietnamese-style arched doorway. The west wall is solid, while the north and south wall feature semicircular arched windows. It was mostly likely designed by an ethnically Vietnamese craftsman named Chang Kaew (), also known as ông Thông Pha, and it features a Vietnamese-style roof and arches. The stairs leading up about  into the sim feature stucco banisters shaped like nāga. In side the sim, against the west wall, is a Buddha statue the Māravijaya attitude produced by local craftsmen.\nHup taem murals\nThe interior and exterior of the sim contain painted murals created by local artisans with powder paints in indigo, green, yellow, black, and brown; the brightly colored murals are designed to stand out from their light, cream-colored background. The interior murals include thirteen chapters of the Vessantara Jātaka depicted in panels similar to the cloth scrolls used to tell the same stories of Buddha's life during local Bun Phawet festivals with captions naming each scene. The exterior murals are mostly scenes from the Sinsai epic, the Isan version of the Lao Sang Sinxay epic. The story of the rescue of a princess from a yaksha by her three nephews begins on the south wall of the sim and travel clockwise around the building. On the west wall, the Sinsai retelling is interrupted by a panel depicting scenes from hell (naraka).\nAlso on the west wall, in a false window, is a self-portrait purported to be of one of the hup taem artists, Mr. Yuak (). A second local artist, Mr. Daeng (), is also credited with working on the hup taem.\nGallery\nFile:Wat Sanuan Wari dragon mural.jpg\nFile:Sinxay fighting Nyak Koumphan on an Elephant.jpg\nFile:Sinxay forcing Soumountha to leave the Palace of her husband, Nyak Koumphan.jpg\nFile:The six devious brothers meet with Sinxay, Siho, Sangthong, Nang Loun and Nang Chanta.jpg\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKch8Sx9JPs Video tour of the wat and its hup taem] by สะเลเต Art Gallery\n* [https://www.orientalarchitecture.com/sid/967/thailand/khon-kaen/wat-sanuan-wari Wat Sanuan Wari] at Asian Historical Architecture\n* [https://cac.kku.ac.th/esanart/19%20Province/Khon%20Kaen/SanaunWaree/KK%20SanaunWaree.html Wat Sanuanwari Phatthanaram]  at Local Arts and Architecture of Esan Buddha Arts"
