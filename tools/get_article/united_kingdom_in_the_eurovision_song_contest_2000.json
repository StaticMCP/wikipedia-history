The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the contest, A Song for Europe 2000. Eight acts competed in the national final which consisted of a semi-final and a final, during which the winner was selected entirely through a public televote.\nAs a member of the \"Big Four\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 3, the United Kingdom placed sixteenth out of the 24 participating countries with 28 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2000 contest, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom forty-two times. Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in  with the song \"Puppet on a String\" performed by Sandie Shaw, in  with the song \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" performed by Lulu, in  with \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" performed by Brotherhood of Man, in  with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\" performed by Bucks Fizz and in  with the song \"Love Shine a Light\" performed by Katrina and the Waves. To this point, the nation is noted for having finished as the runner-up in a record fifteen contests. Up to and including , it had only twice finished outside the top 10,  and . For the 1999 contest, it finished in twelfth place out of twenty-three competing entries with the song \"Say It Again\" performed by Precious, which was its worst result since 1987.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster has traditionally organised a national final featuring a competition among several artists and songs to choose its entry for Eurovision. For its 2000 entry, the BBC announced that a national final involving a public vote would be held to select its entry, reverting to the historic A Song for Europe title but retaining the format from the previous selection show The Great British Song Contest (1996–99).\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 2000\nA Song for Europe 2000 was the national final developed by the BBC in order to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2000. Eight acts competed in the competition which consisted of a radio semi-final on 14 January 2000 and a televised final on 20 February 2000. The semi-final was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, while the final was broadcast on BBC One.\nCompeting entries\nOn 12 August 1999, BBC together with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) announced an open submission for interested songwriters to submit their songs until October 1999. The 1,000 received submissions were reviewed and a 25-song shortlist was compiled (the song \"Stand Up\" written by Richard Silver was automatically included in the shortlist after winning the London International Song Contest which was also ran by BASCA) and presented to a professional panel headed by music producer Jonathan King that ultimately selected eight semi-finalists to compete in the national final. The eight artists were announced on 15 December 1999, while the competing songs were premiered during The Ken Bruce Show and Wake Up to Wogan on BBC Radio 2 between 10 and 13 January 2000. Before the national final, the artist Pas De Deux was renamed as India.\nShows\nSemi-final\nEight acts competed in the radio semi-final which was hosted by Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce on 14 January 2000. A public televote, which registered 32,105 votes, selected the top four songs that proceeded to the final.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|+ Contestants and results of the semi-final – 14 January 2000\n|-\n!
