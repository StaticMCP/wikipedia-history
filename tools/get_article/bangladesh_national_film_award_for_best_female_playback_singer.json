This is the most prominent award of Bangladeshi playback singing. Since the first film Mukh O Mukhosh (1956), playback started. The ratio of releasing films was relatively very low till 1970. Upon its independence from Pakistan in 1971, the film industry witnessed a remarkable inflation of films and songs. Bangladedesh film industry saw the emergence of honouring the best artistes annually. So, National Award stated to be offered in several categories, including best female singer's category.\nThe first award was received by Sabina Yasmin, the reigning \"Melody Queen of Bangladesh\" for Sujan Sakhi. The next year, Runa Laila achieved this feat for The Rain, released in both Urdu and Bengali. It was an unusual exploitation by any singer to achieve a National Award within only two years of debut. However, Runa Laila made this possible, by earning this award in 1976 whereas she made her debut just in 1974. The next year also, Runa won this. Runa Laila made history as she was the first ever Bangladeshi female singer to defend this award successfully (earlier Lata Mangeshkar of India won National Award consecutively in 1973 and 1975, 1974 no award was given). Later on, Sabina Yasmin would make this feat a record four times.\nIn 1978, Sabina Yasmin again earned National Award for Alangkar, she repeated in 1979 for Sundori and 1980 for Kosai. Thus she became the first and only singer to win a hat trick of National Awards. In 1981, not only in music, but also in every category was refrained from awards. In 1982, Mitali Mukherjee won. She later migrated to India and took Indian citizenship. Thus, she is the only Indian singer to win National Award of Bangladesh. In 1983, award was surrendered for the first time. Sabina Yasmin won two times in a row: 1984 and 1985. Sabina's elder sister, Nilufar Yasmin won this award in 1986. Thus, they became only Bangladeshi siblings to win National award in the same category. Sabina won again consecutive awards in 1986 and 1987. Thus, award went to the same family consecutively five times in the same family, a record to admire. The next year Runa Laila won this award and became the only singer with multiple awards except Sabina. The next year, veteran singer Shahnaz Rahmatullah claimed this award. In 1991 and 1992, Sabina consecutively won National Awards for the last time.  The next two years saw Runa winning a fourth and Farida Parveen, a folk singer and non-playback singer to win award. Kanak Chapa won the awards in 1995, 2001 and 2008. She became one of the only three female singers to win multiple awards, the other two being giants as Sabina Yasmin and Runa Laila.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Winner(s)\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Song\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Ref\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1975 || Sabina Yasmin || Sujon Sokhi || Sob Sokhire Par Korite ||\n|-\n| 1976 || Runa Laila || The Rain ||  ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1977 || Runa Laila || Jadur Banshi || ||\n|-\n| 1978 || Sabina Yasmin || Golapi Ekhon Traine || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1979 || Sabina Yasmin || Sundori || ||\n|-\n| 1980 || Sabina Yasmin || Koshai || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1981 || No Awards || || ||\n|-\n| 1982 || Mitali Mukherjee || Dui Poisar Alta || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1983 || Not Given || || ||\n|-\n| 1984 || Sabina Yasmin || Chandranath || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1985 || Sabina Yasmin || Premik || ||\n|-\n| 1986 || Nilufar Yasmin || Shuvoda || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1987 || Sabina Yasmin || Rajlakshmi Srikanta || ||\n|-\n| 1988 || Sabina Yasmin || Dui Jibon || ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1989 || Runa Laila || Accident || ||\n|-\n| 1990 || Shahnaz Rahmatullah || Chhutir Phande || Sagorer Soikote Ke Jeno  ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1991 || Sabina Yasmin || Danga || ||\n|-\n| 1992 || Sabina Yasmin || Radha Krishna (film) || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1993 || Farida Parveen || Andho Prem || ||\n|-\n| 1994 || Runa Laila || Antore Antore || Kalto Chhilam Bhalo ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1995 || Kanak Chapa || Love Story || ||\n|-\n| 1996 || Not Given || || ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1997 || Not Given || ||  ||\n|-\n| 1998 || Not Given || || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 1999 || Not Given || || ||\n|-\n| 2000 || Sabina Yasmin || Dui Duari || ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 2001 || Kanak Chapa || Premer Taj Mahal || Amar Premer Taj Mahal ||\n|-\n| 2002 || Uma Khan || Hason Raja || ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 2003 || Baby Nazneen || Sahoshi Manush Chai || ||\n|-\n| 2004 || Not Given || ||  ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 2005 || Sabina Yasmin || Dui Noyoner Alo || ||\n|-\n| 2006 || Samina Chowdhury || Rani Kuthir Baki Itihash || Amar Majhe Nei ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 2007 || Fahmida Nabi || Aha! || Lukochuri Lukochuri Golpo ||\n|-\n| 2008 || Kanak Chapa || Ek Takar Bou || ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 2009 || Krishnokoli & Chandana Mazumdar || Monpura || Jao Pakhi Bolo Tare ||\n|-\n| 2010 || Shammi Akhtar || Bhalobaslei Ghor Bandha Jay Na || ||\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 2011 || Nazmun Munir Nancy || Projapoti || ||\n|-\n| 2012 || Runa Laila || Tumi Asbe Bole ||  ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n| 2013 || Runa Laila  Sabina Yasmin || Devdas ||  ||\n|-\n|2014|| Runa LailaMomtaz Begum ||  Priya Tumi Sukhi HouNekabborer Mohaproyan || ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n|2015 || Priyanka Gope || Anil Bagchir Ekdin || Amar Shukh Shey ||\n|-\n|2016 || Meher Afroz Shaon || Krishnopokkho || Jodi Mon Kade Chole Esho ||\n|-\n|2017 || Momtaz Begum ||  Swatta || ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2018 ||  Sabina Yasmin ||  Putro || ||\n|-\n| Akhi Alamgir || Ekti Cinemar Golpo || ||\n|-\n| 2019 ||   ||  Maya: The Lost Mother || ||\n|- bgcolor=#edf3fe\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2020 ||  Dilshad Nahar Kona ||  Bishwoshundori || Tui Ki Amar Hobi Re ||\n|-\n| Konal || Bir || Bhalobashar Manush Tumi ||\n|-\n| 2021 || Chandana Mazumdar || Padmapuran || Dekhle Chhobi Pagol Hobi ||\n|-\n| 2022 || Atiya Anisha || Payer Chhaap || Ei Shohorer Pothe Pothe ||\n|}\nRecords and statistics\nMultiple wins and nominations\nThe following individuals received two or more Best Female Playback Singer awards:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Wins\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Singer\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Film\n|-bgcolor=#edf3fe\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |14 || Sabina Yasmin ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |7 || Runa Laila ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |3 || Kanak Chapa ||\n|-\n|| Momtaz Begum  ||\n|}\nSee also\n* Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer\n* Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Music Director\n* Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Music Composer\n* Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Lyrics\nReferences"
