In 2005 Ray Mallon, the mayor and former senior police officer of Middlesbrough implemented \"Talking CCTV\" in his area.\nOther towns have had such cameras installed. In 2007 several of the devices were installed in Bridlington town centre, East Riding of Yorkshire.\nCriticism\nThe cameras were described by critics as \"Big Brother gone mad\".\nIn April 2007, Middlesbrough council apologised to a woman for mistakenly thinking she had dropped a wrapper and instructing her through a Talking CCTV camera to put it in the bin.\nIn popular culture\nThe Simpsons episode \"To Surveil with Love\" was based around the idea of communicative CCTV.\nSee also\n*Giant Voice System\nNotes\nReferences"
