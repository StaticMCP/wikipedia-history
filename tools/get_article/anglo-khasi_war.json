The war started with Tirot Sing's attack on a British garrison that disobeyed orders of this Khasi King to stop a road and sanatorium construction project through the Khasi Hills. The Khasis were defeated in this war and the British gained supremacy over these hills.\nSee also\n* Khasi\n* Tirot Sing\n* Meghalaya\n* North-East India\n* Indian History\n* British East India Company\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/51693/ North-East Notebook]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161418/http://megartsculture.gov.in/herit_volIII.htm Heritage of Meghalaya]"
