It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1978. It is significant for its role in the history of gold mining in Alaska, in particular the Nome Gold Rush that began in 1899.\nIt was the discovery of gold at several sites by the \"Three Swedes\" (Erik Lindblom, __, and ___) that set off the Nome Gold Rush.\nFour sites are included within the NHL District:\n*Anvil Creek Gold Discovery Site, which is separately listed on the National Register\n*Snow Creek Placer Claim No. 1, which is separately listed on the National Register\n*Erik Lindblom Placer Claim, which is separately listed on the National Register\n*Nome Beach, a  area\nThe three Swedes reported they discovered the Erik Lindblom Placer Claim on Mountain Creek on September 19, 1898, the Snow Creek Claim on September 20, and the Anvil Creek Discovery Claim on September 22.\nGold mining in the Nome mining district continues to this day.\nAnvil Creek Gold Discovery Site\nnorth of Nome\n| nearest_city         = Nome, Alaska\n| locmapin             =\n| coordinates          =\n| area                 =\n| built                = 1898\n| architect            =\n| architecture         =\n| added                = October 15, 1966\n| refnum               = 66000159\n| partof               = Cape Nome Mining District Discovery Sites\n| partof_refnum        = 78000535\n| designated_nrhp_type = June 2, 1978\n}}\nThe site by Anvil Creek about  north of what became the city of Nome, in a valley to the west of low, treeless Anvil Peak.  It was one of the richest placer claim sites ever found in Alaska and yielded more than $5 million during its first five years.  By 1965 the site was \"largely returned to nature\".\nErik Lindblom Placer Claim\nnorthwest of Nome\n| nearest_city         = Nome, Alaska\n| locmapin             =\n| coordinates          =\n| area                 =\n| built                = 1898\n| architect            =\n| architecture         =\n| added                = November 21, 1976\n| refnum               = 76000362\n| partof               = Cape Nome Mining District Discovery Sites\n| partof_refnum        = 78000535\n| designated_nrhp_type = June 2, 1978\n}}\nThe Erik Lindblom Placer Claim is on Mountain Creek, which is an often dry tributary that joins the Snake River about  inland from the Snake River's outlet, at Nome, into Norton Sound on the Bering Sea.  The claim is on the \"Third Beach\", about  above sea level, which is the furthest inland former seafront in the Nome area.  Geologically, a high concentration of gold was produced by ocean waves, similar to the later production of gold concentration on Nome's beach.  The site was the first of three gold discovery sites by the three miners.\nOddly, ownership of the claim site could not be determined at the time of its NRHP nomination in 1975;  the last known owner was \"Pioneer Mining Company\", more than 50 years before then.  In 1975, the area was back to a \"natural state\", although debris in the form of mining equipment and domestic implements remained.  Nothing on the land then distinguished the Erik Lindblom Placer Claim from the surrounding area.\nSnow Creek Placer Claim No. 1\nnorth of Nome\n| nearest_city         = Nome, Alaska\n| locmapin             =\n| coordinates          =\n| area                 =\n| built                = 1898\n| architect            =\n| architecture         =\n| added                = September 28, 1976\n| refnum               = 76000363\n| partof               = Cape Nome Mining District Discovery Sites\n| partof_refnum        = 78000535\n| designated_nrhp_type = June 2, 1978\n}}\nThe Snow Creek Placer Claim No. 1 is a -wide strip running  along Snow Creek, up from its confluence with Glacier Creek, which joins the Snake River about  further down.  Snow Creek is often dry.  Placer mining on Snow Creek was nearly exhausted by 1903.\nNome Beach\nIn 1899, about 1,000 miners in Nome were idle due to the fact that the entire Anvil Creek had been claimed, (and presumably so had all other known placer mining sites in the area).  It was fortuitously discovered that the beach at Nome was itself gold-laden, and rockers could garner $20 to $100 each day.\nLocations of all places having coordinates in this page can be seen together in an interactive map, by clicking on \"Map of all coordinates using Open Source Map\", on the right side of this page.\nReferences"
