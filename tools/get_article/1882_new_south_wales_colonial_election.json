This election was for all of the 113 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 40 single-member constituencies, 26 2-member constituencies, three 3-member constituencies and three 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult male British subjects, resident in New South Wales. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 23 November 1882 by the Governor, Lord Augustus Loftus, on the advice of the Premier, Sir Henry Parkes.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
