The rankings were prepared and published the United Press International (UPI). It was the first year that the UPI compiled small-college rankings. The Associated Press (AP) did not begin publishing small-college rankings until 1960.\nThe UPI's small-college rankings for 1957 were based on voting by the UPI's board of coaches. Mississippi Southern compiled a perfect 9–0 record and was ranked No. 1 in the final UPI small-college rankings. The Miami Redskins were ranked second.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n|
