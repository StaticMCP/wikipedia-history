He is known for his work, the Intikhab-I-Jahangir Shahi.\nWorks\nAbdul Wahab created the Intikhab-I-Jahangir Shahi, a work that covered information on the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir. The information on the reign of Jahangir is described as valuable by Gommens. However, the Intikhab-I-Jahangir Shahi is no longer available, but it has had some work extracted by Henry Miers Elliot in his The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians.\nThe work itself has been cited across numerous books, with Mehta describing it \"intelligent\", providing key insight into Jahangir's life. It details public charity acts, and punishments conducted on Khusrau Mirza. The work also provides key detail into the rebellion of Mahabat Khan.\nMany modern secondary sources cite it as a part of selected bibliography due to its reliable contemporary accounts.\nDeath\nAbdul Wahab died sometime in 1622 or 1623.\nReferences"
