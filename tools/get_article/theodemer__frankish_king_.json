His father is possibly to be identified with the Roman commander of that name, in which case Theodemer would have been a cousin of Arbogastes.\nNot much is known of Theodemer. According to Gregory of Tours a war broke out between the Franks and the Romans some unknown time after the fall of the usurping Emperor Jovinus (411–413) who had been supported by the Franks. King Theodemer and his mother Ascyla were executed by the sword during a Frankish uprising that saw the emergence of the \"long-haired kings\", maybe during the campagain of Castinus in 420. Theodemer's reign is supposed to be before that of king Chlodio, and the Chronicle of Fredegar makes Chlodio his son.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum, book II, chapter 9.\n*Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire (PLRE II), J.R.
