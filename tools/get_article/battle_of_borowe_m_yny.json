They were spotted by Russians, whose garrison was stationed in Tarnogród. The Russians immediately sent approximately 1,000 soldiers, who attacked the Poles. While some Polish insurgents decided to fight, others fled through nearby border to Austrian Galicia. Polish and Russian losses in the skirmish are unknown.\nReferences\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.
