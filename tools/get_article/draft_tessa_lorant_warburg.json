Winner of the 1986 Oddfellows Social Concern Award for Literature (now the Oddfellows “Making a Difference Award”), A Voice at Twilight details the final months of the life of her husband, author, lecturer and professor Jeremy Warburg. Written as a diary in which a dying man shares his uncensored thoughts on death, dying, and end of life care, it explores health issues under debate today and advocates for change in Western medicine's approach to the terminally ill. Warburg was invited to the House of Commons to receive the literary award for the book in 1987.\nAt the other end of the spectrum of Warburg’s writing, her speculative fiction / occult novel [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21176203-cloner Cloner], published in 1993, was optioned for movie rights in 2023. At the time of this article, the movie [https://tffilmproductions.com/features/cloner/ Cloner] is in post-production for planned release in late 2025.\nEarly life\nBorn in 1929 in East Berlin, Warburg was the first child of Hungarian father Ralph Renzo Lorant (then with IBM Europe) and American mother Gisella Gehben (daughter of Ernst Gehben of Altenbruch, Germany's famous Art Nouveau [https://www.cux-altenbruch.de/unser-ort/villa-gehben/ Villa Gehben], designed by Achmet Steinmetz and Louis Comfort Tiffany). Warburg’s father was prescient regarding Germany’s future and succeeded in registering her as Hungarian despite her birth in Germany, which, years later, would help her escape the Nazis.\nThough born in Germany, Warburg was raised in Vienna. Since her mother was an anti-Nazi activist and her father of Jewish descent, when Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, the family had to flee. During this period, her parents divorced, and Warburg and sister Dinny shuttled between Vienna and Geneva before managing to join her mother and stepfather, then refugees in England, where her sister Katharina was born. Warburg and her sister Dinny “paid rent” to house the whole family by playing chess with a local baronet, Sir John Hopkins, a former MP and the elderly owner of a large estate nearby. Warburg resumed her education at convent schools in the English country, where she won a scholarship to Oxted Grammar School in Surrey.\nThough her stepfather was interned on the Isle of Man, at age 19 Warburg was able to secure US citizenship through her father, whom IBM had transferred to the US. She escaped World War II’s aftermath in glamorous fashion, traveling from Southampton to New York on Cunard’s first Queen Elizabeth ocean liner. She returned to England as one of only two women accepted into the mathematics program at London University (now University of Southampton). Her maths tutor was also a geometer who, on learning Warburg was both a maths student and an inveterate knitter, introduced her to the mathematics of knitting – topology, a branch of mathematics on geometric configurations unaltered by elastic deformations (i.e., stretching and twisting).\nDuring a summer hitchhiking around Salzburg with her fellow female Maths student, Warburg met future husband Jeremy Warburg. They successfully made their way through much of Germany as well as Austria's French, English, US, and Russian-occupied reintegration zones to reunite in Vienna, after Americans at the border loaned the girls a GI driver to help get them there in time.\nThough Warburg soon returned to the US as a computer programmer in New York City, when she was accepted into the Master's program in Mathematics at University of Wisconsin with a Mathematics graduate assistant role, her future husband also secured a professorship there, and they married on Christmas Eve, 1953.\nThe couple returned to London, where Warburg obtained UK citizenship and taught Pure and Applied Mathematics at a London college and two schools on the London commuter belt, Northfield School (Watford), and Heronsfield (Chorleywood), while having three children: Madeleine, then identical twins Colin and Richard.\nCareer\nAfter Warburg faced down the many challenges of a female professor of mathematics at that time, the family left London for a dilapidated vicarage in Somerset, where Warburg eventually began designing and knitting patterns to defray clothing costs for her husband and three children. Her husband, a published author himself (nonfiction treatises on the English language), encouraged Warburg to start writing, and under the name Tessa Lorant Warburg, she wrote a series of unexpectedly trendy books about knitting.\nHer first book, the [https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?keywords=0713433167&currency=USD&destination=vi&mode=isbn&classic=off&lang=en&st=sh&ac=qr&submit= Batsford Book of Hand and Machine Knitting] (Batsford Books, 1980) was followed by the [https://isbnsearch.org/search?s=Batsford+Book+of+Hand+and+Machine+Knitted+Laces Batsford Book of Hand and Machine Knitted Laces] (Batsford Books, 1982) and Yarns for Textile Crafts (Van Nostrand Reinhold,1984).\nBatsford had eliminated a few chapters Warburg was keen on, and she secured permission to publish them as 'shorts' under her husband’s own imprint, The Thorn Press (early distribution featured Warburg and her children packing and mailing books from their kitchen). The first short book, [https://isbnsearch.org/search?s=Earning+and+Saving+with+a+Knitting+Machine Earning and Saving with a Knitting Machine], was picked up and reviewed by The Telegraph and became an overnight success, leading to multiple reprints.\nHer research unearthed lost Victorian knitting patterns that led to The Heritage of Knitting Series, six books that shocked England by their runaway success. While writing the first, Warburg discovered the manufacturer of the last remaining steel knitting needles in the UK, bought them out, and issued ''Tessa Lorant's Collection of Knitted Lace Edgings with a pair of fine steel needles attached. Knitters went wild and the book went into multiple reprints. For the second, Knitted Quilts and Flounces, Warburg leveraged her mathematics background to invent and patent the Lorant Locator, a device for tracking rows in complex patterns. Again, knitters flocked to buy by mail order and at trade shows, and the book also ran into reprints. For the third, [https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?isbn=ISBN+13%3A+978-0906374511&submitBtn=Search&mode=isbn&st=sr&ac=qr Knitted Lace Collars]'', Warburg developed a tensioning guide for the complex lace collars she was designing (in the style later made famous by Ruth Bader Ginsberg). Warburg's research into Victorian patterns combined with her maths background to reveal the patterns used 3D shaping (versus 2D as modern knitters had previously thought). Warburg’s unique 3D tensioning guide (though unpatented) increased her recognition in the knitting world.\nFor her next book Knitted Shawls & Wraps, Warburg invented another device, the Silver Gauge, patented by her son Richard Warburg, then an intellectual patent lawyer in Boston. Warburg was amused when Britain’s then top knitting yarn manufacturer (Patons & Baldwin) feared the gauge would enable customers to buy elsewhere and tried to ban women’s magazines from offering it. They were right – knitting shows were mobbed with fans pursuing the book and the gauge.\nOn learning that Irish Crochet had helped many poor Irish families during the potato famine, Warburg wrote The Secrets of Successful Irish Crochet Lace, which caught the attention of famed bookseller Christina Foyle, who asked Warburg to mount an exhibition at Foyles, the Guinness World Record-holding world’s largest bookshop.\nThis Heritage of Knitting Series brought Warburg to the public eye – reviewed by The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Mail, it expanded her books’ fame from knitting magazines to national press, and she was asked to write a monthly column for Worldwide Machine Knitting.\nAfter her husband died of cancer Tessa wrote, at his request, her first non-knitting book. A Voice at Twilight shares the inside story, not always solemn, of living and dying with cancer. The book won the Oddfellows Social Concern Award for Literature for its portrayal of the need for changes in the way physicians treat end-of-life care.\nThough nonfiction itself, the narrative format of A Voice at Twilight marks Warburg's shift toward novels. Her next several books, published by Headline Publishing, are a genre-busting trio at the intersection of mystery / science fiction / speculative fiction. Her daughter Madeleine Warburg, who went on to a career in television, aided with characters and storylines exploring advances in genetics in eerie, compelling tales. Her Dohlen Inheritance trilogy, based on her own family's saga spanning the 20th century, was taken up by highly regarded London literary agent Giles Gordon. He described it as an important work, but sagas were not ‘in’ at the time and the three books remained unpublished until taken up by PaperBooks and published in 2009, 2010, 2011, when Warburg was in her early 80s.\nThough Warburg wrote a number of fiction novels, today she is best known for her sold-out press runs of knitting textbooks and pamphlets, the invention of three mathematics-driven knitting devices, and her status as one of only a handful of individual knitters noted by name in Richard Rutt’s definitive work in the field, A History of Hand Knitting[8].\nAwards\no Oddfellows Social Concern Award for Literature (now the Oddfellows Making a Difference Award)\no 2 patents:\n·      US Patent 4,697,346 – The Silver Gauge: A yarn gauging device comprising a flat sheet with a plurality of elongated transparent regions corresponding in width and contour to identify specific categories of yarn.\n·      UK Patent – The Lorant Locator: A device for line isolation in intricate knitting patterns involving long pattern lines.\nPublications\nTrilogies\nThis series of semi-autobiographical novels – a multigenerational family saga – takes readers inside escapes from Nazi Germany and occupied Austria, world travels, and the complexities of sister and family relations\nThe Dohlen Inheritance, Tessa Lorant Warburg (The Thorn Press, 2009, 2009, 2010, Hardback ISBN 978 0 906374 03 0;
