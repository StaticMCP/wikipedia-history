It was to the south of Hanover Battery that had an entrance into the long tunnels of the Northern Defences. In 1859 Queen Charlotte's battery had two guns. This battery would have been called a \"retired\" battery as it was well away from Gibraltar Harbour. These batteries were harder for an enemy to target and their increased height on the slopes of Gibraltar gave the gunners increased visibility and range. The battery still has guns and is open to the public.\nReferences"
