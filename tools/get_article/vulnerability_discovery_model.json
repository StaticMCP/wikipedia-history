A thorough presentation of VDM techniques is available in.  Numerous model implementations are available in the MCMCBayes open source repository.  Several VDM examples include:\n*Alhazmi-Malaiya: Time based model (Alhazmi-Malaiya Logistic (AML) model)\n*Alhazmi-Malaiya: Effort based model\n*Rescorla: Quadratic Model and Exponential Model\n*Anderson: Thermodynamic Model\n*Kim: Weibull Model\n*Linear Model\n*Hump-Shaped Model\n*Independent and Dependent Model\n*Vulnerability Discovery Modeling using Bayesian model averaging\n*Multivariate Vulnerability Discovery Models\nSee also\n* Attack (computing)\n* Computer security\n* Information security\n* IT risk\n* Threat (computer)\n* Vulnerability (computing)\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability discovery model\n\n#REDIRECT Vulnerability Discovery Model"
