The ceremony was moved from the Shrine Auditorium to the Academy's own theater, primarily because the major Hollywood studios had withdrawn their financial support in order to address rumors that they had been trying to influence voters. This year marked the first time a non-Hollywood production (Laurence Olivier's Hamlet) won Best Picture, and the first time an individual (Olivier) directed himself in an Oscar-winning performance.\nThe Academy Award for Best Costume Design was introduced this year. Like Best Cinematography and Best Set Decoration, it was split into Color and Black & White categories.\nJohn Huston directed his father, Walter Huston, to the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Howard in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, a unique accomplishment. The Huston family won three Oscars that evening (John won for Best Director and Best Screenplay, both for the same film). Humphrey Bogart's lack of a nomination for Best Actor has been since considered one of the Academy's greatest slights.\nJoan of Arc set a record by receiving seven nominations without being nominated for Best Picture; this stood until ''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' (1969) received nine nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards without one for Best Picture. Walter Wanger, producer of the film, was not pleased to see the film avoid a Best Picture nomination, and turned down a special Oscar designed to make up for this slight.\nHamlet became the fifth film to win Best Picture without a screenwriting nomination; the next to do so would be The Sound of Music at the 38th Academy Awards. Jane Wyman became the first performer since the silent era to win an Oscar for a performance with no lines; Johnny Belinda was the fourth film to receive nominations in all four acting categories.\nIn addition, Johnny Belinda set the record for most Oscars lost with 11 (1 for 12). It has since been tied with Becket (1 for 12), The Turning Point (0 for 11), The Color Purple (0 for 11), The Power of the Dog (1 for 12), and Emilia Pérez (2 for 13).\nI Remember Mama received four acting nominations but not one for Best Picture, tying the record set by My Man Godfrey in 1936. Two more films to date have tied this record: Othello (1965) and Doubt (2008).\nWinners and nominees\nAwards\nNominees were announced on February 10, 1949. Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" |  Best Motion Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" |  Best Directing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Hamlet – Laurence Olivier for Universal Studios and General Film Distributors, Ltd.'\n** Johnny Belinda – Jerry Wald for Warner Bros.\n** The Red Shoes – Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger for Eagle-Lion Films and General Film Distributors, Ltd.\n** The Snake Pit – Anatole Litvak and Robert Bassler for 20th Century Fox\n** The Treasure of the Sierra Madre – Henry Blanke for Warner Bros.\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'John Huston – The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'\n** Laurence Olivier – Hamlet\n** Jean Negulesco – Johnny Belinda\n** Fred Zinnemann – The Search\n** Anatole Litvak – The Snake Pit\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Actor\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Laurence Olivier – Hamlet as Hamlet'\n** Lew Ayres – Johnny Belinda as Dr. Robert Richardson\n** Montgomery Clift – The Search as Ralph \"Steve\" Stevenson\n** Dan Dailey – When My Baby Smiles at Me as \"Skid\" Johnson\n** Clifton Webb – Sitting Pretty as Lynn Belvedere\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Jane Wyman – Johnny Belinda as Belinda MacDonald'\n** Ingrid Bergman – Joan of Arc as Jeanne d'Arc\n** Olivia de Havilland – The Snake Pit as Virginia Stuart Cunningham\n** Irene Dunne – I Remember Mama as Marta \"Mama\" Hanson\n** Barbara Stanwyck – Sorry, Wrong Number as Leona Stevenson\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Actress in a Supporting Role\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Walter Huston – The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as Howard'\n** Charles Bickford – Johnny Belinda as Black MacDonald\n** José Ferrer – Joan of Arc as The Dauphin, later Charles VII of France\n** Oscar Homolka – I Remember Mama as Uncle Chris Halvorsen\n** Cecil Kellaway – The Luck of the Irish as Horace\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Claire Trevor – Key Largo as Gaye Dawn'\n** Barbara Bel Geddes – I Remember Mama as Katrin Hanson\n** Ellen Corby – I Remember Mama as Aunt Trina\n** Agnes Moorehead – Johnny Belinda as Aggie MacDonald\n** Jean Simmons – Hamlet as Ophelia\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Writing (Motion Picture Story)\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Writing (Screenplay)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'The Search – Richard Schweizer and '\n** Louisiana Story – Robert Flaherty and Frances Flaherty\n** The Naked City – Malvin Wald\n** Red River – Borden Chase\n** The Red Shoes – Emeric Pressburger\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre – John Huston from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre by B.
