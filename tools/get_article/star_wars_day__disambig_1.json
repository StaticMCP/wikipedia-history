Observance of the day spread quickly through media and grassroots celebrations since the franchise began in 1977.\nThe date originated from the pun \"May the Fourth be with you\", from the Star Wars catchphrase \"May the Force be with you.\" Even though the holiday was not created or declared by Lucasfilm, many Star Wars fans have chosen to celebrate the holiday. It has since been embraced by Lucasfilm and the Walt Disney Company as an annual celebration of Star Wars.\nThe release date of the original Star Wars movie, May 25, 1977, is celebrated by some as Geek Pride Day.\nHistory\nThe first recorded reference of the phrase being used was on Thursday May 3, 1979, the day of the 1979 UK General Election in which Margaret Thatcher was elected as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. To express their support before the votes were counted, her political party, the Conservatives, purchased a half-page advertisement on page 13 of the London Evening News reading \"Dear Maggie, May the Fourth Be with You. Your Party Workers.\"\nIn the 1988 episode of Count Duckula, \"The Vampire Strikes Back\", a space-faring superhero, Tremendous Terrance, asks Duckula the date and is told, \"May the Fourth\". As Terrance departs, he tells all below, \"May the Fourth be with you.\"\nThe phrase was used in a UK Parliament defence debate on May 4, 1994.\nAstrophysicist and author Jeanne Cavelos used the saying on page 94 of her 1999 book The Science of Star Wars.\nIn 2008, the first Facebook groups appeared, celebrating Luke Skywalker Day, with the same catchphrase.\nIn 2011, the first organized celebration of Star Wars Day took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at the Toronto Underground Cinema. Produced by Sean Ward and Alice Quinn, festivities included an original trilogy trivia game show; a costume contest with celebrity judges; and the web's best tribute films, mash-ups, parodies, and remixes on the big screen. The second annual edition took place on Friday, May 4, 2012.\nFans (including government officials, such as Boris Johnson) have celebrated Star Wars in a variety of ways in social media and on television.\nMajor League Baseball, association football, and college sports teams have paid tribute to Star Wars in different ways. Minor League Baseball teams such as the Toledo Mud Hens and the Durham Bulls have worn special uniforms as part of Star Wars Day promotions.\nOn Star Wars Day 2015, astronauts in the International Space Station watched Star Wars. Also in 2015, the carillon bells inside the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada played \"The Imperial March\" theme from Star Wars, among other space-related tunes.\nIn June 2021, it was announced that Carrie Fisher would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2022. She received the star on Star Wars Day, May 4, 2023.\nDisney\nSince 2013, The Walt Disney Company has officially observed the holiday with several Star Wars events and festivities at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Disney had purchased Lucasfilm, including the rights to Star Wars, in late 2012.\nThe finale of The Clone Wars was made available on Disney+ on May 4, 2020. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, as well as the documentary series Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian, were also made available on Disney+ the same day. On Star Wars Day 2021, the animated series Star Wars: The Bad Batch also premiered on Disney+, along with the short film Maggie Simpson in \"The Force Awakens from Its Nap\". The second trailer for Obi-Wan Kenobi was released on May 4, 2022, as well as Disney Gallery: The Book of Boba Fett. The second volume of Star Wars: Visions, the short film Maggie Simpson in \"Rogue Not Quite One\" and Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures were all released May 4, 2023, on Disney+. The second installment of Star Wars: Tales, titled Tales of the Empire, premiered on May 4, 2024.  Its follow-up, Tales from the Underworld, aired exactly a year later.\nAdditional dates\nRevenge of the Fifth/Sixth\nSome recognize the day after, May 5, as \"Revenge of the Fifth\", a play on Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and celebrate the Sith Lords and other villainous characters from the Star Wars series rather than the Jedi. Others celebrate this one day later, on May 6, citing \"Revenge of the Sixth\" as a better pun on \"Sith\". The 6th of May is commonly known as \"Return of the 6th\" as a play on Return of the Jedi and the trilogy aspect of the Star Wars films.\nMay 25\nIn honor of the 30th anniversary release date of Star Wars on May 25, 1977, the Los Angeles City Council declared May 25, 2007, as Star Wars Day. A separate initiative for observing Geek Pride Day on May 25 is based on the Star Wars connection along with ties to ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Towel Day) and Discworld. Solo: A Star Wars Story was also released on May 25, 2018, 41 years after the original Star Wars.\nSee also\n* Cinco de Mayo, a celebration held on May 5\n* Star Trek Day, held on September 8, marking the premiere of the original Star Trek television series\n* Free Comic Book Day, which occasionally falls on May 4\n*Geek Pride Day, held on May 25, the release date of the first Star Wars'' movie\nReferences\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
