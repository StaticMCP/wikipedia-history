The tower stands on Kingsettle Hill and belongs to the National Trust. It is designated as a Grade I listed building.\nHenry Hoare II planned the tower in the 1760s to commemorate the end of the Seven Years' War against France and the accession of King George III, and it was erected near the site of Egbert's Stone, where it is believed that Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, rallied the Anglo-Saxons in 878 before the Battle of Edington. The tower was damaged by an aeroplane in 1944 and restored in the 1980s.\nThe  triangular tower has a hollow centre and is climbed by means of a spiral staircase in one of the corner projections. It has a statue of King Alfred and a dedication inscription.\nLocation\nThe tower stands near the site of 'Egbert's Stone', where it was said that Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, rallied the Saxons in May 878 before the important Battle of Edington (historically known as the battle of Ethandun), where the Danish army, led by Guthrum the Old, was defeated. It is the start of the Leland Trail, a  footpath which runs south-west to Ham Hill Country Park.\nHistory\nThe project to build the tower was conceived in 1762 by the banker Henry Hoare II (1705–1785). The tower was intended to commemorate the end of the Seven Years' War against France and the accession of King George III.\n}}\nIn 1765, Henry Flitcroft, a Palladian architect, designed the tower. Building began in 1769 or early 1770, and was completed in 1772 at a cost estimated to be between £5,000 and £6,000. There may have been some delay due to difficulty in obtaining the bricks. In addition to the commemorative function, the tower was also intended to serve as an eye-catcher for those touring the parkland of the Stourhead Estate. In April 1770, when the tower was just  high, Hoare is quoted as saying: \"I hope it will be finished in as happy Times to this Isle as Alfred finished his Life of Glory in then I shall depart in peace.\"\nThe tower was damaged in 1944 when a Noorduyn Norseman aeroplane crashed into it in fog, damaging the uppermost ; one source states that all five on board were killed. It was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1961. Restoration work in 1986 included the use of a Wessex helicopter to lower a  piece of masonry onto the top. The statue of King Alfred was also restored at this time, including the replacement of his missing right forearm.\nArchitecture\nThe triangular tower is over  high with a girth of . Each of the three corners of the triangular structure has a round projection. The centre of the tower is hollow, and to stop birds from entering the space a mesh has been added at roof level. The viewing platform, which has a crenellated parapet and offers a view over the surrounding countryside, is reached by a 205-step spiral staircase at the corner furthest from the entrance. The brick tower has Chilmark stone dressings and is surmounted by an embattled parapet.\nThe south-east face of the tower has a Gothic-arched entrance door, a statue of King Alfred, and a stone panel bearing an inscription (see below). This is the face that most visitors see first when walking from Stourhead garden or from the nearby car park.\nFile:The top of Alfred's Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1310883.jpg|The turret above the stair-tower at the top of the tower\nFile:Plaque carrying inscription on King Alfred's Tower.png|Plaque  above the entrance\nFile:KingAlfredsTowerStatue.png|Statue of King Alfred above the entrance\nInscription\nAround the Stourhead estate are several inscriptions. The plaque of the inscription is in poor condition and needs restoration. It was drafted in 1762 and installed in 1772. The stone tablet above the door on the east face of the tower reads:\nALFRED THE GREAT\nAD 879 on this Summit\nErected his Standard\nAgainst Danish Invaders\nTo him We owe The Origin of Juries\nThe Establishment of a Militia\nThe Creation of a Naval Force\nALFRED The Light of a Benighted Age\nWas a Philosopher and a Christian\nThe Father of his People\nThe Founder of the English\nMONARCHY and LIBERTY\nIn popular culture\nThe tower is mentioned in Thomas Hardy's poem \"Channel Firing\" (written in April 1914) as a place \"far inland\".\nSee also\n*Scrabo Tower, County Down\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20151125152952/http://alfredstower.info/ Unofficial website], last updated in 2015, via Internet Archive\nit:Stourhead#Alfred's Tower"
