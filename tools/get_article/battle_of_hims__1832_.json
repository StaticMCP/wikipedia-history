Ibrahim's Ottoman Egyptian troops routed the troops of Pasha of Aleppo, who lost all their artillery and transports.\nHaving triumphed in Homs, Ibrahim occupied Hama and Aleppo, heading for the Belen Pass, situated between Antakiyah and Scanderoon. This pass was the key to the heart of Ottoman Turkey, Asia Minor.\nSoran involvement\nDuring the early 1830s, Mir Muhammad Pasha of Soran actively aligned his emirate with anti-Ottoman forces. In 1830, he sent a large contingent of troops to support Muhammad Ali of Egypt's campaign against the Ottoman Empire in Syria. This force, commanded by Ibrahim Pasha, participated in the broader Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833) that culminated in the decisive advancement in Syria. Simultaneously, Mir Muhammad dispatched another force under one of his commander to Qajar Iran, targeting Kurdish regions under Iranian control.\n}}\nNotes and references\nCitations\n*\n*"
