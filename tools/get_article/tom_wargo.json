He attended Mayville High School. He did not play golf until he taught himself to play at age 25. Prior to his career as a professional golfer, he had worked as an iron worker, assembly-line autoworker, bartender and fisherman in Alaska.\nProfessional career\nWargo turned pro in 1976. He spent most of his regular PGA career years as the head club pro at the Greenview GC that he owned until 2009 in Centralia, Illinois. In 1992, he received the PGA Club Professional-of-the-Year award. Wargo played in only a handful of PGA Tour events. His best finish in a PGA Tour event, which was a major championship, was a T-28 at the 1992 PGA Championship.\nAfter reaching the age of 50, Wargo joined the Senior PGA Tour in 1993. He has four victories including two senior major championships and over 100 top-10 finishes in this venue. He lives in Centralia, Illinois.\nProfessional wins (10)\nOther wins (5)\n*1988 Illinois PGA Section Championship\n*1990 Gateway PGA Sectional Championship, Irvin Cobb Championship\n*1991 PGA Club Professional Winter Stroke Play Championship, Gateway PGA Sectional Championship\nSenior PGA Tour wins (5)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!
