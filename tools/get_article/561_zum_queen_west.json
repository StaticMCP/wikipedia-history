It runs from Mount Pleasant GO Station where it connects with 505 Züm Bovaird and continues west along Bovaird Drive, south along Mississauga Road, and east along Queen Street to Downtown Brampton Terminal. The route currently operates only on weekdays during rush hours.The 1 Queen shares the entire length with this route and operates 30 minutes or better all day, every day.\nThe 561 was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Regional Municipality of Peel. As of September 6, 2022, Route 561 has been restored to service.\nStops\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As a result, some of the Züm stations including Bovaird, Creditview, and James Potter were still unopened and was not expected to open until the widening project is complete because the road's width did not reach the Züm stations. Instead, temporary bus stops were placed nearby disabled Züm stations along the route. Also, heavy traffic and construction activities could result in bus delays along the route.\nReferences"
