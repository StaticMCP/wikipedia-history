The album features songs by both John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and John Mayall solo work. The album reached No. 79 on the Billboard 200. Confusingly, there are two different albums with the title \"Looking Back\": a Decca UK release as a single album (SKL 5010) and a Decca Germany (issued by TELDEC) release as a double album (DS 3104/1-2). Later issues on CD would use the Deram label.\nAlbum description\nThe German Decca release was a double album, whilst the UK Decca release only featured Eric Clapton on one track. However, the German release did not have the title track in its track listing, and the songs are not as rare, with several songs (\"Parchman Farm\", \"Double Crossing Time\", \"The Super-Natural\", \"Steppin' Out\", \"Ramblin' on my Mind\", \"The Death of J. B. Lenoir\", \"Checking Up on my Baby\", and \"I Can't Quit You Baby\") already released on The Bluesbreakers' studio albums (Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, A Hard Road, and Crusade).\nTrack listings\nDecca UK release\n| title1          = Mr. James\n| writer1         = John Mayall\n| extra1          = B-side of Decca F11900\n| length1         = 2:55\n| title2          = Blues City Shakedown (instr.)\n| writer2         = Mayall\n| extra2          = B-side of Decca F12120\n| length2         = 2:23\n| title3          = Stormy Monday (live)\n| writer3         = T-Bone Walker\n| extra3          = Previously unreleased\n| length3         = 4:36\n| title4          = So Many Roads\n| writer4         = Paul Marshall, P.
