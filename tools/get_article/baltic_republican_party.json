An appeal was lost in February 2005 before the Constitutional Court of Russia. The main political purpose of the party was the establishment of an autonomous Baltic Republic instead of the Kaliningrad region, possibly total independence. It also wanted the old name Königsberg restored. Its leaders are Sergei Pasko and Rustam Vasiliev, with Pasko being the former head of the secretariat of the Governor of the Kaliningrad region Yuri Matochkin. The success of the early party is largely attributed to its support from well-known economists, lawyers and businessmen. The party had hoped that gaining Republican status in Russia hoping for independent foreign trade and partial redistribution of tax deductions.\nKaliningrad Public Movement – Respublika (2003–2021)\nFollowing its outlawing the party transitioned into a social movement that supported parliamentarism, the independence of the branches of power, the decommunization of society, the renaming of Kaliningrad to Königsberg and the preservation of its cultural heritage.\nIn February 2005 the constituent congress of the Kaliningrad Public Movement – Respublika took place in Kaliningrad. It has the same objectives as the BRP, its co-chairmen are Sergei Pasko and Vitautas Lopata, an independent deputy of the regional Duma and local chairperson of the opposition Russian People's Democratic Union.\nIn 2010 the group demanded the simplification of the visa regime with European countries for residents of the Kaliningrad region. However, shortly after, the group's leadership had to flee Russia due to charges of violence against police officers at a rally.\nBaltic Republican Party resurgence (2022–present)\nThe party saw a resurgence due to the buildup for the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, frequently collaborating with other separatist groups. On February 21, 2022, the party's coordinator Vadim Petrov tore up a copy of the Russian Constitution during a separatist rally in front of the Russian embassy in Warsaw, saying that Vladimir Putin was an illegitimate president for amending the constitution to rule for life. During the rally Petrov also delivered an ultimatum on behalf of the Baltic Republican Party stating that supporting illegitimate president Lukashenko and the invasion of Ukraine risks full-fledged war between Russia and NATO, and that the people of Kaliningrad do not want to spoil good neighborly relations with Poland and Lithuania. The ultimatum stated that if Russian troops did not pull out of Ukraine, if Russia does not stop supporting Lukashenko, and if Russia does not demilitarize Kaliningrad, the Baltic Republican Party will organize a referendum on secession from the Russian Federation.\nIn 2023, party leader Rustam Vasiliev decried the increased isolation of the region following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In the same interview, he declared that an increasing number of the region's residents were supportive of the party, and that a break from Moscow was ultimately inevitable. The party claims that Moscow is a barrier to the region's economic development and that the region \"belongs to Europe\". Vasiliev has repeatedly called for the separation of Kaliningrad as a Europe-leaning republic with Königsberg, the city's former German name, as its capital.\nThe party, alongside other movements affiliated with the Free Nations of Russia forum, has been designated a terrorist organization by the Russian Supreme Court in November 2024.\nElection history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"4\" |Kaliningrad Oblast Duma\n|-\n|Election\n|Seats\n|+/-\n|Government\n|-\n|2000\n|\n|1\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Reference\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.enet.ru/~baltia/ Baltic Republican Party official website]\n*[http://koenigsberg-eu.blogspot.com/ Blog in English of the Baltic Republican Party]"
