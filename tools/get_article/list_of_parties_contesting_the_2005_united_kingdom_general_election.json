Due to the first past the post electoral system, national fourth parties are rarely successful in achieving representation in the House of Commons. A notable exception is the case of parties in Scotland and Wales, such as the Scottish National Party or Plaid Cymru, who have gained a number of seats.\nParties listed below are organised firstly by the nations and regions in which they are standing, then the number of MPs elected in the 2001 general election, then by number of candidates standing in the 2005 election, and finally alphabetically.  As a result, parties attracting more support will tend to appear higher in each list than fringe parties.\nParties standing in England and Wales\nThere are well over 500 seats in England and Wales, with the Labour Party and Conservative Party standing in every one, and the Liberal Democrats standing aside only against Health Concern.  UKIP also contested the majority of seats, while Plaid Cymru stood in every seat in Wales.  Thirty further parties stood in more than one seat, while others contested a single constituency.\nParties that won seats in 2001\n* Labour Party (569 candidates in 2005)\n* Conservative Party (569)\n* Liberal Democrats (568)\n* Plaid Cymru (40)\n* Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern (1) - Often abbreviated to Health Concern.\nOther parties\n* United Kingdom Independence Party (475 candidates in 2005)\n* Green Party of England and Wales (182)\n* British National Party (117)\n* Veritas (66)\n* Socialist Labour Party (SLP) (40)\n* RESPECT The Unity Coalition (26)\n* English Democrats Party (25)\n* Legalise Cannabis Alliance (20)\n* Official Monster Raving Loony Party (20)\n* Vote For Yourself Rainbow Dream Ticket (17)\n* Socialist Alternative (17)\n* Liberal Party (13)\n* National Front (13)\n* Workers' Revolutionary Party (10)\n* Christian Peoples Alliance (9)\n* Alliance for Green Socialism (5)\n* Communist Party of Britain (5)\n* Forward Wales (5)\n* Community Action Party (4)\n* Mebyon Kernow (4)\n* Alliance for Change (3)\n* Clause 28 Children's Protection Christian Democrats (3)\n* Peace and Progress (3)\n* People's Choice Making Politicians Work (3)\n* Progressive Democratic Party (3)\n* UK Community Issues Party (3)\n* Democratic Socialist Alliance (2)\n* Peace Party (2)\n* S-O-S!
