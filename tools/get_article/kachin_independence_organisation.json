Founded in 1961, KIO seeks autonomy for Kachin State and operates a de facto parallel government, including its own education and health systems. Its armed wing, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), is one of Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed groups, operating in Kachin and Shan States. The KIO funds its operations through local taxation, control of natural resource extraction—including jade, gold, timber, and rare earths—and cross-border trade with China. It has faced criticism for lack of financial transparency, environmental degradation linked to mining, and the coercive nature of its tax practices. The KIO plays a significant role in Myanmar's ongoing civil conflict. KIO is dominated by members of the Jinghpaw ethnic group, which is the largest subgroup within the broader multi-ethnic Kachin identity.\nHistory\nIn post-independence Burma, the Kachin people had been signatories to the Panglong Agreement and were generally loyal. However, by 1960 the dissent had grown, in part as new Kachin leaders born after World War II began to win the support of prominent community leaders, students and other youth. In 1960 two Kachin dissidents and ex-soldiers of the Burma Army, Lamung Tu Jai and Lama La Ring, contacted fellow dissident Zau Seng and founded the Kachin Independence Organisation. Zau Seng was a veteran of the two-month long Pawng Nawng rebellion and gathered other retired veterans from the 1948–50 era. Zau Seng became the first leader of the KIO, Zau Tu became the first deputy leader, and Lama La Ring became the first secretary. They provided the KIO with ammunition to form a 27-member private army.\nOn 5 February 1960, the KIO's private army raided a bank, among other activities. When Burmese authorities began responding to the KIO's actions, many young Kachin dissidents went underground to join the KIO. In 1961, the organisation was established as the Jinghpaw Independence Organisation (Jinghpaw Shang Lawt Hpung), as the Jinghpaw were the most numerous of the Kachin subgroups. A year later on 5 February 1961, the KIO's 100-strong private army was reorganised into the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and became the KIO's armed wing, with Zau Seng as commander in chief. Following the 1962 Burmese coup d'état, the KIO expanded its armed wing with new recruits, who dissented against the new military junta under General Ne Win.\nThe KIO was initially seen as a radical leftist movement. In 1964, the KIO banned the traditional Gumsa feudal village system, with many traditional headmen killed in the upheaval transitioning into a more \"democratic\" Gumlao system of local administration. However, it became clear that the KIO was a staunchly nationalist organization and that the Gumlao system served to cement intensely loyal clan systems across Myanmar and the world in the coming decades of war. The KIO also became a safe haven for smaller insurgent groups. Their training eventually formed major ethnic armed organizations, most notably the Arakan Army.\nIn 1969, the KIO changed its name to Wunpawng Mungdan Shang Lawt Hpung, omitting a controversial reference to Jinghpaw, to preserve unity among the different ethnic groups under the Kachin umbrella, especially the Rawang and Lacid. In 1989, the New Democratic Army – Kachin split from the KIO due to its political and ethnic differences - the KIO was dominated by members of the Jingpo subgroup, while the NDA-K is led by members of the Lacid subgroup.\nSoldiers from Myanmar's Tatmadaw (armed forces) fought KIA insurgents for over 33 years until a ceasefire was brokered between the two opposing sides in 1994. During the ceasefire, the KIO established intimate ties with the central military and appeared to lose its revolutionary fervor becoming more concerned with the spoils of its lucrative ceasefire economy. International observers thought they had been weakened by self-interest, opportunism and corruption. By working with the KIA, the Tatmadaw capitalized on the resource-rich lands under KIO control providing limited recognition in exchange for access to and security of resources like jade, teak and rubber. The ceasefire lasted for 17 years until June 2011, when the Tatmadaw resumed operations against the KIA. Despite appearances during the ceasefire, the KIO resurged after 2011 and has continued to make uncompromising political demands and to display more disciplined military and organizational strength. The KIO had spent the 17 years building up its legitimacy using grassroots methods, and used its newfound riches to build up its military from a guerilla force to a professionalized army.\nAside from its major towns and railway corridor, KIO/A-controlled areas in Kachin State remained virtually independent and isolated from the rest of Myanmar from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on cross-border jade trade with China and narcotics trafficking. In 2005, the KIO moved its headquarters from Pajau to Laiza, and established a military academy and training school.\nServices\nThe KIO operate an education system in areas under their control, running over 200 schools. Until 2010, KIO operated secondary schools remained in contact with the Ministry of Education. Students of KIO schools who passed the 9th Standard to take their final 10th Standard examination at a government school and attend university afterwards. In response to the central government cutting ties with KIO schools, the KIO opened Mai Ja Yang National College as its first tertiary education school in 2015.\nFunding\nThe KIO funds most of its armed wing's activities through the cross-border trade with China of jade, timber, gold and rare-earth elements. Money is also raised through KIA-imposed taxes on locals, schools, and commercial businesses.\nResource extraction\nThe KIO has been criticized for its opaque handling of revenues from resource extraction, particularly from jade mining in Hpakant. The KIO imposes taxes on the jade trade, but the organization has not provided clear information on how these funds are utilized. This lack of transparency has led to concerns about potential mismanagement and corruption within the KIO leadership. Profits from resource extraction are not equitably distributed among the local population. Instead, a significant portion of the revenues appears to benefit KIO leaders and affiliated elites. For instance, some KIO leaders have been reported to have personal associations with the jade business, raising questions about conflicts of interest and the fair distribution of resources. The revenues generated from jade mining have been used to fund military activities, which in turn have fueled ongoing violence and instability in Kachin State. This cycle of resource exploitation and conflict has been described as a \"vicious circle\" that hinders efforts toward peace and reconciliation.\nIn 2023, KIO halted rare earth mining operations in Bhamo District due to local opposition. In 2024, it took control of the towns of Panwa and Chipwe, which are rare earth mining hubs.\nTaxation\nThe KIO has implemented a tiered tax system for businesses, including private schools, and jade and gold mining companies, to fund armed operations. Similarly, in northern Shan State, the KIO/KIA has increased taxes from local businesses, including shops and vehicles passing through KIO/KIA checkpoints. In 2010, following the end of a ceasefire, the KIO resumed tax collection in Hpakant. Residents in contested areas receive frequent tax collection letters from various ethnic armed organizations, leading to a climate of fear and economic strain. Additionally, the use of armed KIA soldiers to enforce tax payments has raised concerns about coercion and the legitimacy of the taxation process.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\n*\n*  |title=Burma: Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity |date=1999-06-01 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-85649-660-5 }}"
