The college offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a variety of fields related to agriculture and environmental studies. Maryland's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources is often ranked among the better agricultural sciences schools in the United States.\nHistory\nThe history of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Maryland is simply the history of the university itself. The University of Maryland was chartered in 1856 as the Maryland Agricultural College. Charles Benedict Calvert spent $21,000 to purchase 420 acres in College Park, Maryland, and later that year founded the college. The school opened on October 5, 1859, with a total of 34 students.\nIn 1864, the state legislature designated it as a land grant college under the Morrill Act of 1862, which made federal funds available. By the end of the Civil War, the university, having been hit hard by financial problems and a decline in student enrollment, found itself bankrupt. The state legislature assumed half ownership of the school in 1866, which pulled the college out of bankruptcy, and made the college, in part, a state institution. Enrollment slowly increased at the university, and over the next 26 years, Maryland gained a reputation as a strong research institution.\nThe federally funded Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station was established under the Hatch Act of 1887, and was opened in 1888 at the college. Focused on helping farmers, the Ag Station worked with faculty, staff and students. New state laws granted the college regulatory control over several areas of agriculture and public safety.\nIn 1920, the Maryland General Assembly merged the Baltimore and College Park campuses, forming the University of Maryland, College Park. The College of Agriculture was one of its thirteen units. continued to be a main part of the curriculum. Its first dean was P. W. Zimmerman. The College of Agriculture included agronomy, animal, husbandry, dairy husbandry, forestry, horticulture, plant morphology and mycology, plant pathology, plant physiology and poultry husbandry. Harry J. Patterson replaced Zimmerman in 1925, while also serving as the director of the Agricultural Experiment Station. He was replaced by Thomas B. Symons in 1938.\nThe College of Agriculture became the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 1995. The college also administers the Agricultural Experiment Station. The college has expanded its academic programs. Wendy Powers became dean of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources in July 2025.\nCampus\nResearch and education centers\n* Central Maryland Research & Education Center\n* Lower Eastern Shore Research & Education Center\n* University of Maryland, Eastern Shore\n* Western Maryland Research & Education Center\n* Wye Research & Education Center\nAcademics\nDepartments and degree options\nAgricultural and Resource Economics\n* Business Management\n* Environmental and Resource Policy\n* Food Production\n* International Agriculture\n* Political Process\nAgricultural Science and Technology\n* Agricultural Science Education\nAnimal and Avian Sciences\n* Animal Care and Management\n* Animal Biotechnology\n* Equine Studies\n* Laboratory Animal Management\n* Pre-Veterinary medicine\n* Sciences/Pre-Professional\nEnvironmental Science and Policy\n* Environment and Agriculture\n* Environmental Economics\n* Environments Restoration and Management\n* Soil, Water, and Land Resources\n* Wildlife Ecology and Management\nEnvironmental Science and Technology\n* Ecology Technology and Design\n* Environmental Health\n* Natural Resource Management\n* Soil and Watershed Science\nInstitute of Applied Agriculture\n* 2-year certificate\n** Agribusiness, concentrations in Equine Management and Sustainable Agriculture\n** Golf Course Construction Management\n** Golf Course Management\n** Landscape Management\n** Ornamental Horticulture Management\n** Sports Turf Management\n** Turfgrass Management\nNutrition and Food Science\n* Dietetics\n* Food Science\n* Nutritional Science\nPlant Science and Landscape Architecture\n* Landscape Architecture\n* Plant Science\n** Horticulture and Crop Production\n** Landscape Management\n** Plant Science\n** Turf and Golf Course Management\n** Urban Forestry\nVirginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine\n*Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Blacksburg, Virginia\n*Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, College Park, Maryland\nPartnerships\nThe University of Maryland's partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture started in 1957, collaborating in such areas as dairy, agronomy, horticulture and agricultural biotechnology research. The USDA's Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland works with the University of Maryland on agriculture, environmental, and natural sciences.\nResearch\n* Center for Agriculture and Natural Resource Policy\n* Center for Food, Nutrition, and Agriculture Policy\n* Center for Food Safety and Security Systems\n* Hughes Center for Agro-ecology\n* Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n* Maryland Agriculture Experiment Station\n* Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center\n* Research Greenhouse Complex\nRankings\n* Among ‘top 15’ green colleges - Grist\n* Agriculture and Resource Economics is the #1 program in Resource and Environmental Economics and #3 in Agricultural Economics.\n* The Department of Agriculture and Resource Economics is ranked #3 worldwide among academic Agricultural Economics Departments by Research Papers in Economics (RePEc).\nScholarships\nThe University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources boasts a multitude of unique scholarship opportunities for students, often made possible due to the alumni, and donations. The college has 44 scholarships with 12 additional scholarships from the University of Maryland. It also offers four travel scholarships.\nStudy abroad\nStarted in 1998, the International Programs in Agriculture and Natural Resources (IPAN) was developed to encourage research, education, and outreach across the globe. The programs help other countries to improve their crop production, livestock management, and conservation practices. In return, the university and its students gain valuable knowledge and experience of other countries and cultures abroad. IPAN study abroad programs are based in numerous countries, included Azerbaijan, China, Costa Rica, France, Georgia, India, Italy, Kazakhstan, Peru, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.\nStudent life\nFraternities and sororities\n* Alpha Gamma Rho is a social and professional fraternity open to all men from the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the College of Chemical and Life Sciences, and men with agricultural backgrounds.\n* Alpha Zeta is a professional fraternity made up of both men and women pursuing educational and/or career fields in agriculture.
