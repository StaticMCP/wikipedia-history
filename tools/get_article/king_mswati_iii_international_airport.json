It replaced Matsapha Airport in 2014 as the only international airport in Eswatini that caters to commercial flights. It is designed to handle 360,000 passengers per year.\nEmbraer 135 on the tarmac]]\nConstruction\nConstruction began in 2003 on this  project. The Taiwanese government contributed  to the project.\nIt is part of King Mswati III's $1bn millennium project investment initiative to enhance Eswatini's position as a tourist destination, serving as a tourism gateway to Eswatini's game parks, either domestic or nearby located ones, such as Victoria Falls, Maputo, the Kruger National Park and  KwaZulu-Natal game reserves. However, the airport has been on the drawing board since 1980, and since then Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport has opened and Maputo and Durban airports have been upgraded. There are also environmental concerns since Sikhupe is near Hlane Royal National Park and may put rare species of eagles and vultures at risk.\nKing Mswati III International Airport was planned to replace Matsapha airport by 2010, with the latter being taken over by the army.\nKing Mswati III International Airport was inaugurated on 7 March 2014, despite not yet having an IATA license to operate. Service began on 30 September 2014.\nFacilities\nPlans include a 3,600m CAT 1 runway, and capacity for 300,000 passengers per year. It would be able to handle Boeing 747 aircraft, and service flights to any destination in the world.\nAirlines and destinations\n|Cape Town, Durban, Harare, Johannesburg–O. R.
