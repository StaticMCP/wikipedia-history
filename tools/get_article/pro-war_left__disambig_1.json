They were centered on the Euston manifesto, which in October 2007 had 2,929 signatories. The name is derived from the pro-war group the Undertakers.\nThey have some similarity with American liberal hawks and Anti-Germans.\nSupporters\nThe pro-war Left can be seen as mainly a phenomenon of the blogosphere. Most of its supporters contribute to or run blogs, ''Harry's Place'' being the most well known and influential of these.\nOn October 7, 2007, a counter-demonstration to the Al-Quds march was organised by Harry's Place to which all of the pro-war Left were invited. The organisers estimate that 100 people turned up over the course of the day.\nAs well as the Euston Manifesto there are other organisations that have been associated with the pro-war Left such as Labour Friends of Iraq, Unite Against Terror, Democratiya and Engage.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090928000111/http://www.neoconeurope.eu/Decent_Left Decent Left], Neocon Europe profile.\n* Norman Geras, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060414124611/http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/norman_geras/2006/04/introducing_the_euston_manifes.html Introducing the Euston Manifesto], The Guardian, 13 April 2006.\n* Norman Geras and Nick Cohen, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200604170006 The Euston Manifesto], New Statesman, 17 April 2006.\n* Geoffrey Wheatcroft, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1771475,00.html They should come out as imperialist and proud of it: There is a progressive tradition of support for colonialism, which the Euston manifesto group could champion], The Guardian, 10 May 2006.\n* Norman Geras, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1782407,00.html The path out of denial], The Guardian, 25 May 2006.\n* Mike Marqusee, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/14/moralquicksandofmoralhighg The moral quicksand of the moral high ground], Comment is Free, guardian.co.uk, 14 April 2006.\n* DD Guttenplan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213221337/http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/dd_guttenplan/2006/04/no_sects_pleaseyoure_british.html.printer.friendly No sects please, you're British], The Guardian, 17 April 2006.\n* Daniel Davies, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080419042133/http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/daniel_davies/2008/04/next_stop_is_euston_where_this.html Next stop Euston.
