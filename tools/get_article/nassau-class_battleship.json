The class comprised , the lead ship, , , and . All four ships were laid down in mid-1907, and completed by late 1910. They were Germany's first dreadnought class, and though commonly perceived as having been built in response to the British , their design traces its origin to 1903; they were in fact a response to Dreadnoughts predecessors of the . The s adopted a main battery of twelve  guns in six twin-gun turrets in an unusual hexagonal arrangement. Unlike many other dreadnoughts, the -class ships retained triple-expansion steam engines instead of more powerful steam turbines.\nAfter entering service, the -class ships served as II Division, I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the duration of their careers. From 1910 to 1914, the ships participated in the normal peacetime routine of the German fleet, including various squadron exercises, training cruises, and fleet maneuvers every August–September. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the ships took part in numerous fleet operations intended to isolate and destroy individual elements of the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. These frequently consisted of sailing as distant support to the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group as they raided British coastal towns. These operations culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where the ships helped to sink the armored cruiser .\nThe ships also saw service in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Empire during the war;  and  engaged the Russian pre-dreadnought  during the inconclusive Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915.  and  were sent to Finland to support White Finnish forces in the Finnish Civil War, though  ran aground and was badly damaged. Following Germany's defeat, all four ships were ceded as war prizes to the victorious Allied powers and broken up in the early 1920s.\nDesign\nInitial designs\nThough the  class is commonly cited as a response to the revolutionary , the decision to adopt an all-big-gun main battery predated the construction of the British vessel. Design work on what would eventually become the  class began in 1903, with work scheduled to begin in 1906. Kaiser Wilhelm II argued that the navy ought to build large armored cruisers as a single capital ship type. In December 1903, Wilhelm II suggested a new ship, of about  displacement, to be armed with four  guns and eight  guns. Speed was to be . He requested the Construction Office submit proposals based on his ideas; by January 1904, three such designs had been prepared: \"5A\", \"5B\", and \"6\". The first two mounted eight 21&nbsp;cm guns, in four single-gun turrets and four casemates for \"5A\" and in four twin-gun turrets in \"5B\". The \"6\" design carried ten of the guns in four casemates and the remaining six in a central battery. Though the naval command felt \"5B\" offered the best firing arcs, they forwarded the \"6\" design for further consideration. Evaluation of the design led to a conclusion that it offered no significant improvement over the preceding s.\nThe Kaiser intervened again in February with a request for a  ship with secondary batteries of ten 21&nbsp;cm or  guns; the Construction Department and the  (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel submitted proposals. The first, \"6B-D\", was a variant on the earlier \"6\" design, while two others, \"10A\" and \"10B\" featured the larger guns; the submissions from Kiel have not survived and their details are not known. Wilhelm interrupted this design work by suggesting that speed should be increased significantly at the price of reducing the main battery to 24&nbsp;cm guns, which resulted in further design studies that were completed by April. All of these were deemed unacceptable and further design work was carried out within the  (Imperial Naval Office). The officers there observed that the secondary battery should be limited to 21&nbsp;cm guns, since the increased weight of the 24&nbsp;cm weapons limited the number of guns. This resulted in \"Project I\", armed with twelve of the guns, \"Project II\", armed with sixteen of the guns, and \"Project III\", which carried eight 24&nbsp;cm guns. All three variants kept a 28&nbsp;cm main battery.\nDuring deliberations in late April, \"Project I\" emerged as the favored design since it would be cheaper than \"II\" (which would also require widening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal). The design was refined into two versions, \"IA\" and \"IB\", with the former using casemates and the latter using single turrets. Wilhelm approved \"IA\" in May, though the arrangement of the secondary guns proved to be contentious, and in December another variant, \"7D\", which moved eight of the guns to twin turrets and adopted an improved underwater protection system was submitted, which the Kaiser approved on 7 January 1904. These plans were disrupted immediately when the Germans learned of the characteristics of the British s, which carried a secondary battery of ten  guns, and estimates of the next class of battleships, which were to carry an even more powerful armament. This meant that \"7D\" would be insufficient to counter the next generation of British battleships, and the design staff would have to start over.\nAll-big-gun proposals\nVariants with six 21&nbsp;cm twin-turrets were submitted, along with the first German all-big-gun battleships; these featured a battery of eight 28&nbsp;cm guns, four in standard twin turrets and the rest in single-gun turrets. Wilhelm approved the all-big-gun version on 18 March 1905, after which further design refinement was carried out, which included increasing the beam, rearranging the secondary battery of eight  guns, and improved turrets for the main battery guns. The Kaiser again attempted to meddle in the design process after he learned of the Italian s, which were capable of ; he pressed the navy to build a similar vessel, along the same lines as the type he had suggested in 1903. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz pointed out that merging the battleship and armored cruiser categories would not be possible under the Naval Law of 1900, and that the Construction Office was too busy with other projects to take on another one.\nDuring this period, Tirpitz worked to secure the passage of the next Naval Law; he had originally requested six new battleships and six armored cruisers, along with a number of miscellaneous smaller craft. As capital ship designs continued to grow in size and power, their cost spiraled upward. Opposition to budget increases in the  (Imperial Diet) forced Tirpitz to reduce his request to six armored cruisers—one of which was to have been placed in reserve—and 48 torpedo boats, dropping his request for new battleships completely; the reduced proposal was voted through on 19 May 1906 as the First Amendment to the Naval Law. A week after the amendment was passed, funds for two 18,000-ton battleships and a 15,000-ton armored cruiser were allocated to the Navy. Funds were also provided to widen the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and enlarge dock facilities to accommodate the larger ships.\nThe design staff continued to refine the new ship, and by September 1905, several variants had been proposed, including \"F\", which replaced the four single-gun turrets with an equal number of twin-gun turrets. The 17&nbsp;cm guns were also replaced with twelve  guns on the basis that they offered a much higher rate of fire. An improved underwater protection system was adopted as well, resulting in the design finalized as \"G\", which was approved on 4 October. Internal rearrangements to the magazines and boiler rooms resulted in \"G2\", while an attempt to move all of the gun turrets to the broadside was presented as \"G3\", but this proved to be unworkable. \"G2\" was chosen for continued refinement, becoming \"G7\" and then \"G7b\", which the Kaiser approved on 3 March 1906. The initial arrangement with three funnels was altered to just two, and a new bow was incorporated, securing approval from the Kaiser on 14 April as \"G7d\". Construction of the first vessel was authorized on 31 May; another member was added shortly thereafter, with another two authorized for the 1907 construction program.\nSpecifications\nGeneral characteristics\nThe ships were  long,  wide, and had a draught of . The ships had a length to width ratio of 5.45, which was somewhat \"stubby\" compared to contemporary designs. To some extent, the greater than normal width was due to the four wing turrets, which necessitated a wider hull. They displaced  with a standard load, and  fully laden. The ships had nineteen watertight compartments, with the exception of , which only had sixteen. All four ships had a double bottom for  eighty-eight percent of the keel. Steering was controlled by a pair of rudders mounted side-by-side. The ships carried a number of boats, including a picket boat, three admiral's barges, two launches, two cutters, and two dinghies. The ships' standard crews numbered 40&nbsp;officers and 968&nbsp;enlisted men; while serving as squadron flagships, this was augmented by 13&nbsp;officers and 66&nbsp;enlisted men, and as divisional flagships, with 2&nbsp;officers and 23&nbsp;enlisted sailors.\nAs designed, the ships did not handle particularly well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling due to the weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to reduce the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the -class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70&nbsp;percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.\nPropulsion\nThe Imperial German Navy was slow to adopt the advanced Parsons turbine engines used in the British Dreadnought, primarily due to the resistance of both Tirpitz and the Navy's construction department. In 1905, the latter stated that the \"use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself.\" This decision was based solely on cost: at the time, Parsons held a monopoly on steam turbines and required a 1&nbsp;million mark royalty fee for every turbine engine made. German firms were not ready to begin production of turbines on a large scale until 1910.\nThe  class therefore retained three vertical, 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each in its own engine room, with each driving a 3-bladed screw propeller that was  in diameter. Steam for the engines was provided by twelve coal-fired, Schulz-Thornycroft water-tube boilers that were divided into three boiler rooms. The wing turrets and their magazines further divided the machinery into three separated groups, thereby increasing survivability. The boilers were ducted into a pair of funnels. The propulsion system was rated at  for a top speed of , though in service, all four ships exceeded these figures by a wide margin. Power output ranged from , with top speeds of . By comparison, Dreadnoughts steam turbines provided a rated speed of . Electrical power was provided by eight turbo-generators, producing  at 225&nbsp;V.\nThe ships had a normal capacity of  of coal, though at full load they could carry up to . At a cruising speed of , the ships could steam for ; increasing speed to  reduced their range to , and at  their radius of action fell significantly, to . While steaming at , the ships could steam for . In 1915, the boilers were fitted with supplementary oil firing, along with storage for  of fuel oil; this allowed oil to be sprayed on the coal to improve combustion rates.}}\nArmament\nThe vertical triple expansion engines consumed large amounts of internal space that could otherwise have been used for magazines. Without sufficient magazine capacity to support superfiring centerline turrets, designers were compelled to distribute six twin-gun turrets in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Two twin turrets were mounted fore and aft (one on each end), and two were mounted on each flank of the ship. Firing directly forward and aft, the ships could bring six guns to bear and eight on the broadside; this was the same theoretical capability as Dreadnought, but the -class ships required two additional guns to achieve it. The German designers considered that this arrangement provided a useful reserve of heavy guns that were shielded from enemy fire. While the arrangement was relatively common with semi-dreadnought battleships, the only other navy to adopt it for their dreadnoughts were the Japanese with their s.\nEach ship carried twelve  SK L/45 guns.}} The wing turrets were C/1906 mounts, as were the centerline turrets on the first two ships of the class,  and .  and  carried their centerline guns in C/1907 turrets, which had a longer trunk than the C/1906 design. The C/1906 turrets and 28&nbsp;cm SK/L45 guns were designed specifically for the new German dreadnoughts in 1907. Both mountings allowed for elevation up to 20&nbsp;degrees, but the C/1907 mounts could depress an additional two degrees, down to −8. The main battery propellant magazines were placed above shell rooms, with the exception of the centerline turrets of  and . These guns fired 666&nbsp;lb shells, with a  fore propellant charge in silk bags and a  main charge in a brass case. The guns fired the shells at a muzzle velocity of  and they had a maximum range of .\nThe ships' secondary armament consisted of twelve  SK L/45 guns, which were mounted individually in casemates. Six of these were placed on either side of the ship at main deck level on either broadside. These guns fired armor-piercing shells at a rate of 4&nbsp;to 5 per minute. The guns could depress to −7&nbsp;degrees and elevate to 20&nbsp;degrees, for a maximum range of . The shells weighed  and were fired at a muzzle velocity of . The guns were manually elevated and trained.\nFor close-range defense against torpedo boats, the ships also carried sixteen  SK L/45 guns, also in casemates. Four of these were in sponsons forward of the main battery, two on either side. Another four were in the forward superstructure, and the other four were in sponsons in the stern. These guns fired a 22-lb projectile at 2,133&nbsp;ft/s (650&nbsp;m/s), and could be trained up to 25&nbsp;degrees for a maximum range of 10,500&nbsp;yards (9,600&nbsp;m). After 1915, two 8.8&nbsp;cm guns were removed and replaced by two 8.8&nbsp;cm Flak guns, and between 1916 and 1917, the remaining twelve 8.8&nbsp;cm casemated guns were removed. These anti-aircraft guns fired a slightly lighter 21.2&nbsp;lb shell at 2,510&nbsp;ft/s (765&nbsp;m/s). They could be elevated to 45&nbsp;degrees and could hit targets 12,900&nbsp;yards (11,800&nbsp;m) away.\nThe -class ships were also armed with six  submerged torpedo tubes. One tube was mounted in the bow, another in the stern, and two on each broadside, on either ends of the torpedo bulkhead. These were supplied with C/06D torpedoes; they had a range of  with a speed of , and they carried a  warhead. The bow tube could be trained thirty degrees to either side and the broadside tubes could be aimed thirty degrees forward and sixty degrees aft.\nArmor\nshowing the armor layout]]\nThe -class ships were protected with Krupp cemented steel armor. The basic armor layout divided the ships into three sections: the bow, the stern, and the central citadel, the latter extending from the fore to the aft main battery barbette. The citadel consisted of the main section of belt armor, connected at either end by transverse armored bulkheads, and supported by a curved armor deck at mid-deck level. It protected the ships' vitals, including their propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazines. On either end of the citadel, the belt was considerably reduced in thickness and the deck was lowered to waterline level forward, though aft it remained at mid-deck level. The need for improved underwater protection had been demonstrated during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, during which several battleships of both sides had been badly damaged or sunk by naval mines and torpedoes; also of major importance was the severe damage to the battleship  in 1901 after having struck an uncharted rock.\nThe main section of belt armor was  for a height of , increased to  abreast the engine rooms, though it tapered to  on the bottom edge, which was  below the waterline. It also thinned at the top edge to  at upper deck level. Toward the bow, it was reduced to  and then to . Aft of the citadel, the belt reduced to  to  before terminating at another transverse bulkhead that was also 9&nbsp;cm thick. Behind the main belt was a torpedo bulkhead  thick; there was some difficulty mounting the torpedo bulkhead, due to the four wing turrets and their barbettes, which took up considerable space close to the edge of the hull. The casemate battery, located directly above the central portion of the belt, was protected by a strake of armor that was 16&nbsp;cm thick. This portion of the side armor was also capped on either end by a bulkhead that was  thick.\nThe ships' main armor deck was  thick in the central citadel, and the sides of the deck sloped downward to connect to the bottom edge of the belt. The sloped portion increased in thickness to , and the resulting compartment created was used as a coal bunker, which would provide additional protection for the ships' interiors when the bunkers were full. Compartments on either side of the torpedo bulkhead, which were set back about , were similarly used to store coal. In the bow and stern sections, the deck was thickened to ; it was increased further to  over the steering compartment. The forecastle deck was  over the secondary battery and 2 to 3&nbsp;cm above the torpedo bulkhead.\nThe forward conning tower had a roof that was  thick; the sides were 30&nbsp;cm thick. Atop the conning tower was the smaller gunnery control tower, which had a curved face that was  thick. The aft conning tower was less well protected, with a  thick roof and  sides. The main battery turrets had 28&nbsp;cm thick faces,  sides, and  rear plates to balance the turrets. Their roofs consisted of two parts: a sloped front section that was 9&nbsp;cm and a flat rear section that was  thick. The casemated secondary battery was protected by the upper belt and had 8&nbsp;cm thick gun shields; each gun was divided by a 2&nbsp;cm transverse screen to prevent shell fragments that might hit one gun from entering the adjacent casemate. The ships were also fitted with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed after 1916.\nConstruction\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Construction data\n! scope=\"col\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" | Contract name\n! scope=\"col\" | Builder\n! scope=\"col\" | laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Launched\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|, Wilhelmshaven\n|22 July 1907\n|7 March 1908\n|1 October 1909\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|AG Weser, Bremen\n|12 August 1907\n|1 July 1908\n|16 November 1909\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|AG Vulcan, Stettin\n|1 June 1907\n|26 September 1908\n|30 April 1910\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|\n|, Kiel\n|11 June 1907\n|12 December 1908\n|31 May 1910\n|}\nService history\nand II Battle Squadron before the outbreak of war]]\nPre-war service\nAfter entering service in early 1910,  and  joined I Battle Squadron, with the latter serving as the flagship. Later that year, they were joined by  and  as they were commissioned for service. Over the next four years, the ships took part in a routine of squadron and fleet maneuvers, gunnery practice, and training cruises. Each year typically culminated in a summer training cruise in July, frequently to Norwegian waters, followed by the annual fleet maneuvers held in late August and early September. The one exception to this was 1912, when the summer training cruise remained in the Baltic Sea owing to increased tensions with Britain and France as a result of the Agadir Crisis. The ships were in Norway during the July Crisis in 1914 and were hastily recalled to begin the mobilization for war when it became apparent that conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia would not be avoided.\nWorld War I\nAfter the start of the war, the German fleet embarked on a campaign of raids of the British coast intended to draw out portions of the British Grand Fleet or force the British to disperse their forces to stop the raids. The High Seas Fleet would then be able to concentrate its own ships to destroy isolated elements, thereby reducing the numerical superiority of the British fleet. The first of these was the raid on Yarmouth on 2–3 November 1914, which was conducted by the battlecruisers of  (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group while the battleships provided distant support. The operation failed to locate any significant British forces. It was followed by the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on 15–16 December. During the night, the fleet destroyer screen encountered British warships—a squadron of six battleships and their escorts—but the German commander,  (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Ingenohl believed he was confronting the entire Grand Fleet and disengaged. The s and the rest of the fleet got underway to relieve the battlecruisers after they were ambushed in the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915, but they arrived too late to intervene. The fleet conducted several sweeps in to the North Sea to try to locate British patrols in March, April, and May but did not encounter any.\nIn August, I Battle Squadron and three battlecruisers were detached from the fleet to temporarily reinforce the German fleet in the Baltic Sea. The Germans planned to clear the Gulf of Riga to facilitate the capture of the city by the Imperial German Army. The Russian Baltic Fleet had stationed the pre-dreadnought  and a number of gunboats and destroyers in the gulf, the entrances to which were protected by a series of minefields. The first attempt during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga to breach the minefields and enter the gulf on 8 August was as it had taken too long to clear the Russian minefields to allow the minelayer  to lay a minefield of her own. They made another attempt beginning on 16 August, led by  and , along with four light cruisers and thirty-one torpedo boats. A minesweeper and destroyer were sunk that day, and the next day  and  engaged in an artillery duel with , forcing her to withdraw after scoring three hits. The remaining minesweepers cleared a path into the gulf, but reports of Allied submarines prompted a German withdrawal. The ships then returned to the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea.\nAfter returning to the North Sea, the fleet conducted another sortie in the hope of catching a British squadron in October, with further operations beginning in March 1916, now under the direction of VAdm Reinhard Scheer. These operations included the attack on Yarmouth and Lowestoft in April. Unknown to the Germans, the British were aware of their intentions before embarking on these raids; the German light cruiser  had run aground in the Baltic in August 1914, and Russian forces had salvaged German code books from the wreck and passed a copy to their British allies. With the ability to decode German wireless signals, they could send forces to attack the High Seas Fleet under conditions favorable to themselves, as they had done at Dogger Bank. This led to the Battle of Jutland on 31 May, when the British sought to catch the German fleet far enough away from port that it could be cut off and destroyed.\nBattle of Jutland\nThe German fleet sortied in the early hours of 31 May, intending to make a demonstration with Hipper's battlecruisers to draw out his British counterparts of the Battle Cruiser Fleet. The British, aware of Scheer's plans, were already at sea, having left their base at Scapa Flow late on 30 May. The four s and the rest of I Battle Squadron formed the center of the German line of battle, astern of KAdm Paul Behncke's III Battle Squadron and ahead of the old pre-dreadnoughts of KAdm Franz Mauve's II Battle Squadron.  served as the flagship of II Division under KAdm Walter Engelhardt. The initial phase of the action, which began at 16:00 on 31 May, consisted of a running battle between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons as Hipper lured the British commander, Vice Admiral David Beatty, south toward Scheer's fleet. Upon spotting the German fleet, Beatty turned north, leading the Germans toward the approaching Grand Fleet under Admiral John Jellicoe.\nAs the fleets converged close to 18:00, the German battleships, including the s, engaged British light cruisers and destroyers, with  contributing to the destruction of the destroyer . By 18:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene, and was deployed into a position that would cross Scheer's \"T\" from the northeast. To extricate his fleet from this precarious position, Scheer ordered a 16-point turn to the south-west. At 18:55, Scheer decided to conduct another 16-point turn to launch an attack on the British fleet but was quickly forced to break off and withdraw. The Germans then maneuvered to disengage from the Grand Fleet and return to port; as darkness fell, the High Seas Fleet attempted to pass astern of the Grand Fleet as the latter steamed south, before turning south themselves to reach Wilhelmshaven. At around 21:20, lookouts aboard  spotted a group of British battlecruisers and she opened fire, scoring a hit on  and straddling , though her sisters could not make out targets and held their fire. Shortly thereafter,  and  engaged British light cruisers and forced them to withdraw.\nAt around midnight on 1 June,  came in contact with the British destroyer , and in the confusion, attempted to ram her. Spitfire tried to evade, but could not maneuver away fast enough, and the two ships collided.  fired her forward 11-inch guns at the destroyer, but they could not depress low enough for  to be able to score a hit. Nonetheless, the blast from the guns destroyed Spitfires bridge. At that point, Spitfire was able to disengage from , and took with her a 20-foot (6&nbsp;m) portion of s side plating. The collision disabled one of her 5.9-inch guns, and left an 11.5-foot (3.5&nbsp;m) gash above the waterline; this slowed the ship to 15&nbsp;knots until it could be repaired. At approximately the same time,  accidentally rammed the light cruiser  and holed her below the waterline.  was damaged so severely that her engine room was completely flooded and she was unable to move; the captain of the ship ordered  be scuttled to prevent her capture by the British.\nShortly after 01:00,  and  encountered the British armored cruiser .  opened fire first, and pummeled Black Prince with a total of 27 large-caliber shells and 24 shells from her secondary battery.  and  joined in, followed by ; the combined weight of fire destroyed Black Prince in a tremendous explosion. The wreck of the ship was directly in the path of ; to avoid it, the ship had to steer sharply towards III Battle Squadron. It was necessary for the ship to steam at full speed astern in order to avoid a collision with .  then fell back into a position between the pre-dreadnoughts  and . Following the return to German waters, , , and , along with the -class battleships  and , took up defensive positions in the Jade roadstead for the night, while  refueled and rearmed. The -class ships suffered only a handful of secondary battery hits from the opposing Grand Fleet;  was hit twice,  and  each once, and  escaped completely unscathed. Not a single ship of the four was struck by a heavy-caliber shell.\nLater operations\nLess than three months after Jutland, Scheer embarked on another operation in the North Sea; in the resulting action of 19 August 1916,  was torpedoed by the British submarine , but suffered minimal damage and was soon repaired. Further operations took place in September and October, though the fleet saw little activity in 1917. While the bulk of the fleet conducted Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga in October 1917, the four s patrolled the eastern Baltic to block a potential British incursion to support Russia. In February 1918,  and  were detached from the High Seas Fleet and ordered into the Baltic Sea. A civil war had broken out in the newly independent Finland between the German-aligned Whites and Russia-aligned Reds, and the two ships were to aid the Whites.  joined them there in early April. On 11 April,  ran aground off Åland. Approximately 6,000 tons of guns, belt armor, and coal were removed in order to lighten her enough to be refloated, which was not accomplished until 9 July.  was never repaired, and instead saw the remainder of her service as a barracks ship in Kiel.  and  participated in the Battle of Helsinki, transporting German troops and providing artillery support.\nIn late 1917, German light forces had begun raiding British convoys to Norway, prompting the British to send heavy escorts. This provided the German fleet with the opportunity for which it had been waiting the entire war: a chance to destroy an isolated portion of the Grand Fleet. The Germans had mistaken intelligence about the timing of the convoys, however, and failed to intercept one when they sortied in April 1918;  was the only member of the class to take part in the operation. While returning from Finland in August,  was removed from active service for use as a gunnery training ship. The fleet saw little activity in the final months of the war and morale plummeted, leading to the Wilhelmshaven mutiny when it became clear that Scheer and Hipper intended to mount a last-ditch attack on the Grand Fleet in the last days of the war.\nFollowing the end of the First World War in 1918, eleven battleships of the , , and es and all five battlecruisers, along with a number of light cruisers and destroyers, were interned in Scapa Flow, while their fate was determined in the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles. The  and -class battleships were left in Germany, though when the treaty was signed in 1919, they were listed as war prizes to be surrendered to the Allies. All of the ships save Rheinland, which was in too poor a condition, were transferred to Rosyth, Britain, to be divided between the Allies.  was ceded to Japan, Britain received  and , and  was sold directly to the breakers at Dordrecht. Between 1920 and 1924,  was scrapped at Birkenhead and the remaining ships were scrapped at Dordrecht.\nFootnotes\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n}}\n*\n| pages = 12–20\n}}\n*\n| url=https://archive.org/details/conwaysallworlds0000unse_z3o0\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n| title-link = Castles of Steel\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\n}}\n*\n}}"
