For information about the crimes committed, see Crime in the United Kingdom.\nCrime statistics in the United Kingdom refers to the data collected in the United Kingdom, and that collected by the individual areas, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which operate separate judicial systems. It covers data related to crime in the United Kingdom. As with crime statistics elsewhere, they are broadly divided into victim studies and police statistics. More recently, third-party reporting is  used to quantify specific under-reported issues, for example, hate crime.\nCrime surveys\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales is an attempt to measure both the amount of crime, and the impact of crime on England and Wales. The original survey (carried out in 1982, to cover the 1981 year) covered all three judicial areas of the UK, and was therefore referred to as the British Crime Survey, but now it only covers England and Wales. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, similar surveys, namely the Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey and Northern Ireland Crime Survey have similar purposes. These surveys collect information about the victims of crime, the circumstances surrounding the crime, and the behaviour of the perpetrators. They are used to plan, and measure the results of, crime reduction or perception measures. In addition, they collect data about the perception of issues such as antisocial behaviour and the criminal justice system.\nOther crime surveys include the Commercial Victimisation Survey, which covers small and medium-sized businesses, and the Offending, Crime and Justice Survey, with a particular focus on young people.\nBackground and counting rules\nUntil the late 1990s crime figures for varying crime types were not released to the general public at individual police force level. The annual publication 'Crime in England & Wales' produced by the Home Office began to break the figures down to a smaller area in 1996. Crime figures in England & Wales during the late 1990s and early 2000s were often misinterpreted in the media and scrutinised because of frequent changes in the way crimes were counted and recorded that lead to rises in the crime category Violence Against the Person.\nCommenting on figures from 1 April 1998 onwards, the then-Home Secretary Jack Straw said \"changes in the way crime statistics are compiled are in line with recommendations by senior police officers. They are intended to give a more accurate picture of the level of offences\". The largest increases were recorded in the \"Violence Against the Person\" category owing to the inclusion of common assault figures to accompany other offence types within this category that include assault occasioning actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm, harassment, murder, possession of offensive weapons and a selection of other low volume violent crimes grouped together by the Metropolitan Police as 'other violence'.\nThe change in counting rules, and the significant impact it had on violence against the person figures, was often misconstrued by the media as real increases. The rises in violence resulting from this were highly publicised on an annual basis.\nA detailed breakdown of the way crimes are counted are available from the Home Office website. Recorded crime increased in England and Wales during most of the 1980s, reaching a peak in 1992, and then fell each year until 1998/99 when the changes in the Counting Rules resulted in an increase in recorded offences. This was followed by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 which led to a rise in recording in 2002/03 and 2003/04, as the rules bedded-in within forces. Crime figures were originally collected to cover a calendar year, however this changed from 1998 when crime statistics began to be collated and grouped by financial year.\nPolice statistics\nThe Policing Services and Information website publishes national statistics on crime at a local level, as well as on the performance of each police force in the UK.\nHowever, the accuracy of police statistics is questionable. Crimes are sometimes under-reported, as victims may be reluctant to report them due to considering it too trivial, embarrassing, aversion to dealing with the police, or fear of repercussions by the perpetrators. The police also sometimes fail to record correctly all crimes reported to them. The police may not accept a person’s claim that they are a victim of crime, or sometimes deliberately do not record a crime to save time or manipulate performance figures.\nIn 2002,  the Home Office introduced a National Crime Recording Standard in England and Wales, due to a lack of uniformity in how police forces recorded notifiable offences. One issue identified was , the practice of writing off reported notifiable offences from police force statistics. The National Crime Recording Standard was applied inconsistently across crimes and regions, frequently incorrectly, for instance, it varied significantly by area: in the year to March 2011, 2% of reported rapes in Gloucestershire were recorded as \"no crime\", while 30% of reported rapes in Kent were so classified, making accurate comparison difficult. This was sometimes due to pressure from performance and other factors.\nDuring the period November 2012 – October 2013, an average of 19% of crimes reported to the police are not recorded, with one quarter of sexual crimes and one-third of violent crimes not being recorded, with rape being particularly bad at 37% 'no-criming'. Reporting is inconsistent across local forces: \"In a few forces, crime-recording is very good, and shows that it can be done well and the statistics can be trusted. In some other forces, it is unacceptably bad.\" The failure to properly record crime was called \"inexcusably poor\" and \"indefensible\" by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor. Twenty percent of reviewed decisions to cancel a report were found to be incorrect, and in about a quarter of cases there was no record of victims being informed that their report had been cancelled.\nSenior members of the policing establishment admit to long-term, widespread \"fiddling\" of figures, such as John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, former head of the Metropolitan Police Service:\nIn April 2013, the framework for reporting of official police statistics was amended to address these issues. The Home Office delegated the responsibility for auditing a police forces compliance with the National Crime Recording Standard to Her Majesty's Chief Inspectorate of Constabulary, later renamed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire Rescue Service (HMICFRS). The first statistics using  the new framework were published in July 2014.\nAfter the 2014 changes, five yearly rolling compliance audits by HMICFRS found that police force still do not uniformly comply with The National Crime Recording Standards. In 2014, the Office for National Statistics stated that the unreliability of notifiable offence statistics meant they did not meet the quality standards required of national statistics.\nEngland and Wales\nAccording to the Home Office, there were around \"1.3 million violent crimes in England and Wales in 2017, which can be misconstrued, because the United Kingdom uses a less lenient view of violent crime, which wouldn't be reported in North America. This makes England and Wales worse than Denmark, Australia, Japan, but much safer than France, United States, Canada, Belgium.\". This has not changed in 2018, with figures remaining close to 2017's according to the CSEW, however a 6% decrease in offences with a knife or sharp instrument was seen in 2018, with recorded figures at 40,829. Other areas of crime in 2018 included robbery (82,566), an 11% increase from 2017; burglary (424,846), a 3% decrease from 2017; and vehicle theft (463,497), a 2% increase from 2017.\nAs an example of a problem created by the above improvements in notifiable offence statistics, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) shows the rate of rape per 100,000 population in UK between 2012 and 2022 increasing from 28.95 to 117.30 (~305%), sexual assault from 39.54 to 125.88 (~218%), and sexual violence from 81.53 to 324.79 (~298%). This would indicate that England and Wales had almost double the crime rate of the next highest country in those categories among all UN member states in the European region. However, the trend from the CSEW (which methodology remained unchanged over that time) shows how these figures diverged due to the changes.\nScotland\nScots criminal law is separate to English criminal law, including the use of a not proven verdict at criminal trials in the Courts of Scotland. The list of offences is also different from England and Wales, and Northern Ireland.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/surveys/list-of-surveys/survey.html?survey=Crime+Survey+for+England+and+Wales Crime Survey for England and Wales]\n*[https://www.police.uk/ Policing services and information - police.uk]"
