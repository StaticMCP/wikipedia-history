However, it proved ineffective; the guarantees were abandoned in July 1921, with the relevant parts of the Act repealed, and the price of wheat crashed from 84s 7d a quarter to 44s 7d within one year – a drop of 48%.\nThe act had established wage committees to fix minimum agricultural pay; these, too, were soon abandoned. A replacement system of \"conciliation committees\" was set up to mediate between employers and labourers, but these had no legal powers, and the average weekly wage fell from 46s at the beginning of 1921 to 36s by the end of the year, and to 28s a week within eighteen months of the repeal.\nThe next attempt to fix agricultural wages would be Labour's Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act 1924.\nReferences\n*Facts and Figures for Socialists, 1951.
