Johnson commented that \"The Warp Factor is a challenging game. Our machine was kept pretty busy by staffers who wanted to know, for example, how Captain Kirk would do against a swarm of Tie-fighters. It is slow, but it can keep your attention. And it is a good buy for the Star Fleet Battles addict who can't find an opponent.\"\nThe game sold 8,000 units in 1981.\nSee also\n*Star Fleet Battles\n*List of Star Trek games\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
