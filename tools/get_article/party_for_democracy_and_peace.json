The name \"Democratic Peace Party\" is known to have been named by Lee Sang-don (), a conservative liberal in South Korea.\nHistory\nThe party was founded by People Party dissidents who were in a faction that was closely associated with late former President Kim Dae-jung.\nPlans for the new party came about following a decision by People Party leader Ahn Cheol-soo and Bareun Party leader Yoo Seong-min to merge their respective parties in January 2018 that would go onto form the Bareunmirae Party. The initial announcement was called \"hasty\" for being presented before votes were cast among each respective parties' members. This plan for merging the centrist People Party with the centre-right Bareun Party faced opposition within the People Party, especially with lawmakers from North and South Jeolla which noted to be liberal-leaning provinces.\nOn 28 January, sixteen lawmakers from the People Party, including former floor leader and party leader Park Jie-won as well as Chung Dong-young announced their plans to form what is now the Party for Democracy and Peace.\nThe party formerly formed a parliamentary group with the Justice Party called the Lawmakers for Peace and Justice. The parliamentary group was disbanded after the death of Roh Hoe-chan, an MP from Justice Party.\nOn 12 August 2019, two-thirds of the members of Parliament for the Party for Democracy and Peace stated that they will be leaving the Party and starting new. \"The Party for Democracy and Peace was launched to solidify the identity of the democracy group that succeeded the spirit of the Gwangju Uprising, and to restore the pride of the peace group to develop the Sunshine Policy. But for the past year and a half we have failed to meet the public's expectations and desire,\" said party Floor Leader You Sung-yop during a press conference at the National Assembly.\nPolitical position\nThe PDP is a party led by the \"pro-Kim Dae-jung\" forces (who led the Millennium Democratic Party, a conservative liberal party). During the administration of Roh Moo-hyun, the Party for Democracy and Peace and the Democratic Party used to be united as the Uri Party. During that time, both Lee Hae-chan (incumbent leader of DP) and Chung Dong-young (incumbent leader of PDP) were in the same party and cabinet.\nIn social policy, the party tends to be more conservative than Democratic Party. The party opposes same-sex marriages and abortion. Especially on the abortion issue, the party is more conservative than the Liberty Korea Party. Because of this socially conservative tendency, some media have classified Party for Democracy and Peace as conservative parties along with the Bareunmirae Party and Liberty Korea Party.\nElectoral results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
