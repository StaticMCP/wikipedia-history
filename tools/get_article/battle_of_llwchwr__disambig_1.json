The Normans sallied out expecting to meet a small collection of Welsh raiding bands, however the scale of the Welsh army took them by surprise. The two armies met on the common of Carn Coch. In a violent melee, the Welsh army emerged victorious, the Normans having lost around 500 men.\nAftermath\nThe victory of the Welsh army inspired more rebellions around Wales including a battle near Kidwelly Castle fought by an army led by Gwenllian, Princess of Deheubarth and the Battle of Crug Mawr.\nExternal References\n[https://brwydr.blogspot.com/2007/05/battle-of-llwchwr-1-ionawr-1136.html] – I'R GAD: Welsh Medieval Battlefields Campaign."
