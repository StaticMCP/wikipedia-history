Chief Vanhnuailiana went to Nisapui and arranged the wedding of his son Liankhama with the daughter of a Chenkual chief named Tuali. However, Suakpuilala managed to secure Tuali for his son Kalkhama instead and got them married in haste. Vanhnuailiana was outraged and, on his deathbed, informed his sons to never forget such a shameful incident.\nWar\nReferences\nSources"
