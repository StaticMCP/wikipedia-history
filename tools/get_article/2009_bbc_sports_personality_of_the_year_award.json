It was presented by Sue Barker, Jake Humphrey, and Gary Lineker on BBC One. Awarded annually by the BBC, the main titular award honours an individual's British sporting achievement over the past year. The winner is selected by public vote from a 10-person shortlist. Other awards presented include team, coach, and young personality of the year.\nFootballer Ryan Giggs took home the main award, with racing driver Jenson Button second and heptathlete Jessica Ennis third.\nWinner and nominees\nThe BBC Sports Personality of the Year is an annual sport award ceremony and the 2009 edition was its 56th staging. It occurred on the evening of 13 December, at the Sheffield Arena, Sheffield. For 2009, the BBC moved the awards from the Echo Arena, Liverpool to Sheffield to try to attract more spectators. It was the first time that the programme was held in Yorkshire, which was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on BBC One, the BBC Sport website and BBC Radio 5 Live. Sue Barker, Jake Humphrey and Gary Lineker presented the ceremony on the main stage, whilst Clare Balding, Matt Dawson, John Inverdale and Stephen Parry served as the backstage radio broadcasters.\nNominations for the award were conducted by a panel of 26 sport experts representing magazines and select national and regional newspapers. They were asked to choose ten nominees not in preference but in alphabetical order. Had there have been a tie after the nominating process, the production team would have asked six members of a panel of former winners for their first three preferences in order. There would be three points for first, two for second and one for third. The tied nominee with the highest number of points would subsequently advance to the final ten; had there been a second tie, another vote would be conducted to move the tied participant with the highest number of first places to the shortlist.\nThe ten nominees were announced on the BBC One programme The One Show on the evening of 30 November. The list was composed of two athletes from the sport of athletics, and one each from the sports of boxing, cricket, cycling, diving, football, Formula One, gymnastics and tennis. Jenson Button, the 2009 Formula One World Champion, was the bookmakers' initial favourite to win the accolade, followed heptathlete world champion Jessica Ennis and cricketer Andrew Strauss. In the week prior to the ceremony, the bookmakers moved footballer Ryan Giggs into contention and made him the more than likely winner during the programme.\nGiggs was announced as the winner with 29.40 per cent of the public vote. Button finished runner-up with 18.74 per cent of the public vote and Ennis was third with a 15.58 per cent vote share. Giggs was the first footballer to be voted the recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award since David Beckham in 2001 and the fourth in history following Michael Owen in 1998, Paul Gascoigne in 1990 and Bobby Moore in 1966. Giggs was also the third Welsh winner of the award, following 2007 winner Joe Calzaghe and David Broome who won in 1960. Chris Hoy and Andrew Flintoff presented Giggs with the silver television camera and tripod trophy.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Winner and nominees of the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"130\" |Nominee\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100\" |Sport\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |2009 achievement\n! scope=\"col\" |Votes\n! scope=\"col\" |%\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:gold;\"\n|  || Football || The 20-year veteran of Manchester United made his 800th appearance, scored his 150th goal and helped the club reach the Champions League final. ||\n|29.40\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n|  || Formula One || Won the World Drivers' Championship to become the tenth British Formula One World Champion. ||\n|18.74\n|- style=\"background:tan;\"\n|  || Athletics|| Won heptathlon gold at the IAAF World Championships in Berlin. ||\n|15.58\n|-\n|  || Cycling || Claimed 23 professional victories during the season, including 6 and 3 stages of the Tour de France / Giro d'Italia respectively. ||\n|10.84\n|-\n|  || Gymnastics || Won floor gold at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. ||\n|7.53\n|-\n|  || Diving || Became the first British world champion (at 15 years of age) upon winning 10 metre platform gold at the FINA World Championships. ||\n|7.13\n|-\n|  || Tennis ||Won six tennis tournaments in 2009, including the Miami Masters and the Montreal Masters to reach  2 in the world rankings.\n|\n|3.86\n|-\n|  || Cricket ||Captained the England cricket team to victory over Australia in the 2009 Ashes.\n|\n|3.34\n|-\n|  || Boxing ||Defeated Nikolai Valuev in a \"David vs. Goliath\" match in Nuremberg, Germany to become the sixth WBA Heavyweight Champion in history.\n|\n|2.69\n|-\n|  || Athletics ||Won Britain's second gold medal of the IAAF World Championships in Berlin in the triple jump.\n|\n|0.87\n|-\n|}\nOther awards\nHelen Rollason Award\nThe BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award was presented to an individual \"for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.\" The winner was chosen by BBC Sport with no public vote and the name of the recipient was revealed on the night of the ceremony.
