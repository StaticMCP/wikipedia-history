During World War II, it sank the German submarine U-176 on 15 May 1943.\nn° 390 in Havana (July 2011)]]\nDuring the Cold War, the Cuban Navy successfully captured the freighters Leyla Express and Johnny Express, both vessels blamed for CIA-related activities against Cuba.\nIn 1988, the Cuban Navy boasted 12,000 men, three submarines, two modern guided-missile frigates, one intelligence vessel, and a large number of patrol craft and minesweepers. However, most of the Soviet-made vessels have been decommissioned or sunk to make reefs. By 2007, the Cuban Navy was assessed as being 3,000 strong (including up to 550+ Navy Infantry) by the IISS with six Osa-II and one . The Cuban Navy also includes a small marine battalion called the Desembarco de Granma''. It once numbered 550 men though its present size is not known.\nCuban Navy today\nAfter the old Soviet submarines were put out of service, Cuba searched for help from North Korea's experience in midget submarines. North Korean defectors claimed to have seen Cubans in mid to late 1990s in a secret submarine base and appeared in public view years later a single picture of a small black native submarine in Havana harbour. It is rumored to be called 'Delfin' and is to be armed with two torpedoes. Only a single boat is in service and the design appears original, even if influenced both by North Korea and Soviet designs.\nThe Cuban Navy rebuilt one, large ex-Spanish Rio Damuji fishing boat. BP-390 is now armed with two C-201W missiles, one twin 57&nbsp;mm gun mount, two twin 25&nbsp;mm gun mounts and one 14.5&nbsp;mm machine gun. This vessel is larger than the , and it is used as a helicopter carrier patrol vessel. A second unit (BP-391) was converted and entered service in 2016.\nThe Cuban Navy today operates its own missile systems, the made-in-Cuba Bandera (a copy of the dated Styx Soviet missiles) and Remulgadas anti-ship missile systems, as well as the nationally produced Frontera self-propelled coastal defence multiple rocket launcher. The navy's principal threats are drug smuggling and illegal immigration. The country's geographical position and limited naval presence has enabled traffickers to utilise Cuban territorial waters and airspace.\nThe Cuban Navy's air wing is an ASW helicopter operator only and is equipped with 2 MI-14 Haze helicopters.\nFleet\nCurrent\nFleet equipment\n* 2 s, 1 × 57&nbsp;mm gun, 2 Styx surface-to-surface missiles, 1 × 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, 2 × 25&nbsp;mm autocannons.\n* 1 Delfin-class submarine, possibly 2 torpedo launchers.
