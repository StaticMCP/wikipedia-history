The event was created to promote community engagement, celebrate local food culture, and raise funds for city beautification projects.\nOverview\nHosted by Rory Rowland, the mayor of Independence, the contest is designed as a family-friendly event taking place each summer at the Independence Square. The inaugural competition is scheduled for July 4, 2024, as part of the city’s Independence Day festivities.\nThe contest invites participants aged 18 and older to compete in a timed hot dog eating challenge, with an entry fee of $10 per contestant. All proceeds are directed toward the city's Parks and Recreation Department.\nPrizes\nThe winner of the contest receives a cash prize of $500 and a custom-made Golden Hot Dog Trophy. The trophy, sculpted by a local artisan, is plated in metallic gold paint and features a hot dog mounted on a miniature pedestal modeled after the Harry S. Truman Courthouse.\nRules\nParticipants are given five minutes to eat as many standard-size hot dogs as possible. Contestants must fully swallow each hot dog and bun for it to count. Drinking water is allowed. A panel of three judges, including a representative from the mayor's office, oversees the competition.\nReception\nAlthough the event is in its first year, it has received media coverage from local radio and community bulletins. Organizers hope to establish it as an annual tradition, with plans for a youth edition and a vegetarian-friendly division in future years.\nSee also\n* Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest\n* List of competitive eating competitions\nExternal links\n* [https://www.ci.independence.mo.us Official City of Independence Website]\nReferences\nCity of Independence.
