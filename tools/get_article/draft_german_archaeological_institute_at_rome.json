Today, the institute is a department of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI), which developed out of the Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica in Rome. The DAI is a public-law institution of the Federal Level of Germany, headquartered in Berlin and operating under the jurisdiction of the Federal Foreign Office.\nThe Rome Department maintains a library of classical studies of global importance, one of the largest specialized photographic collections on Italian archaeology, and a wealth of resources for scholarly work, including extensive archives and a digital catalog for rapid access to publications.The DAI Rome focuses on the archaeology of Italy and North Africa, from prehistoric times to the early Middle Ages. The current director is Ortwin Dally, with Norbert Zimmermann serving as deputy director.\nHistory and Purpose\nThe Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica was founded on April 21, 1829, on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, in the Palazzo Caffarelli, as a private association of international scholars and artists of classical antiquity. Its initial purpose was to collect and publish the rapidly increasing archaeological discoveries in Italy.  In regular assemblies of members and interested guests, called Adunanze, new finds were presented and discussed, and the methods of the emerging disciplines of classical scholarship were refined. A collection of exemplary artifacts and drawings of antiquities was also created. Particularly important for scholarship was the establishment of a comprehensive library, which remains a core component of the institute today. Since 1835, the Casa Tarpea—designed by Johann Michael Knapp—served as the institute’s headquarters.\nStrongly supported by the Prussian kings, the institute was converted in 1871 into an institution of the German Empire. In 1877, the now Imperial German Archaeological Institute moved into a new building on the Capitoline Hill, designed by Paul Laspeyres in Neo-Pompeian style, providing ample space for the expanding library. From that time onward, the institute undertook fruitful excavations at major Italian sites, such as Pompeii, Rome, and southern Italy, many of which it continues to study today. Numerous individual investigations of major monuments in Rome and Latium, as well as cataloging work, characterize the institute’s scientific activity.\nAfter the confiscation of the Capitoline building following World War I, the institute resumed work in 1924 in the parish house of the Christuskirche, at Via Sardegna 79, where it remains located.  In 1944, it was closed due to World War II, and from 1946, it came under the administration of the Unione internazionale degli istituti di archeologia, storia e storia dell’arte in Roma. The DAI was reestablished as a German institution in the summer of 1953, and a new purpose-built facility was completed at Via Sardegna in 1964. In addition to its traditional art-archaeological studies—central to German classical archaeology—focusing on the major collections in Rome, the institute today emphasizes historical-topographical, urbanistic, and architectural research questions. These complex studies increasingly require interdisciplinary cooperation and are often carried out in close collaboration with Italian institutions, and sometimes internationally. German universities are also actively involved. Thus, the institute not only fulfills its own research mission but also serves as a bridge between German academic research and Italian institutions. Moreover, the DAI Rome is dedicated to preserving, restoring, and documenting archaeological sites and monuments, recognizing the shared cultural heritage of all nations. In recent decades, its projects have expanded to nearly all of Italy, as well as Tunisia, Algeria, and Albania.\nThe institute also promotes international scholarly exchange through numerous lectures and colloquia, often held jointly with Italian and other Roman institutions. As a foreign organization, it serves as an ideal forum for academic collaboration. Two major annual celebrations are the Palilia Day on April 21 and the Winckelmann Festival on December 9, the birthday of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. These events are open to the public, while more specialized gatherings are aimed at the international scholarly community. A traditional highlight of the institute’s outreach is the annual “Pompeii Course”, organized by its scholars for German high school teachers of classical languages and history, offering them an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of Roman antiquity through a particularly suitable example. The strong demand underscores its importance. Equally popular are the academic seminars and spring guided tours (January–May) conducted by institute members through Rome’s monuments and museums.\nAs an institution funded by the Federal Republic of Germany, the DAI Rome operates under the Federal Foreign Office. However, most research projects are made possible through external funding organizations, such as the German Research Foundation (DFG), the Gerda Henkel Foundation, or the Fritz Thyssen Foundation.The building on Via Sardegna—currently closed for extensive renovations—houses not only the institute’s core facilities but also a guest wing for visiting scholars. Equally important is the dependence “Villino Amelung” at Via Andrea Cesalpino 1b, a villa built in 1904 by Ernst Wille for the private scholar Walther Amelung (1865–1927). This villa provides temporary accommodation for research fellows and young scholars, including recipients of the DAI’s travel grant, allowing them to work flexibly on-site and participate in ongoing research projects.\nCurrent State\nDue to structural deficiencies affecting the building’s stability, the premises of the DAI Rome at Via Sardegna were closed to the public in 2006.  In autumn 2009, the institute moved into temporary quarters at Via Curtatone 4d, where the library and photographic archive were reopened to the public on January 26, 2010.In 2015, the institute relocated to another temporary building at Via Valadier 37. The original building at Via Sardegna 79 is currently under renovation and is expected to be returned to the DAI in a few years. In January 2019, the institute had to change locations once again; since June 2019, the Rome Department has been accessible at Via Sicilia 136.\nSecretaries and Directors of the Rome Department\nManaging (First) Secretaries (1887–1915) and First (Managing) Directors (since 1921)\n* 1829–1832: Eduard Gerhard\n* 1835–1856: Emil Braun\n* 1856–1887: Wilhelm Henzen\n* 1887–1905: Eugen Petersen\n* 1905–1907: Gustav Körte\n* 1908–1915: Richard Delbrueck\n* 1921–1927: Walter Amelung\n* 1928–1937: Ludwig Curtius\n* 1937–1944: Armin von Gerkan\n* 1952–1956: Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg\n* 1956–1961: Reinhard Herbig\n* 1961–1984: Theodor Kraus\n* 1984–1995: Bernard Andreae\n* 1995–2002: Paul Zanker\n* 2002–2006: Dieter Mertens\n* 2006–2014: Henner von Hesberg\n* since 2014: Ortwin Dally\nSecond Secretary (until 1909) and Second (Scientific) Director (since 1924)\n* 1845–1856: Wilhelm Henzen\n* 1857–1865: Heinrich Brunn\n* 1865–1887: Wolfgang Helbig\n* 1887–1909: Christian Hülsen\n* 1924–1936: Armin von Gerkan\n* 1938–1945: Siegfried Fuchs\n* 1954–1960: Rudolf Naumann\n* 1961–1962: Theodor Kraus\n* 1963–1969: Helmut Schläger\n* 1970–1990: Hans-Georg Kolbe\n* 1990–2002: Dieter Mertens\n* 2002–2013: Klaus S.
