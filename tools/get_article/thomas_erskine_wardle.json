He was the Rear-Admiral Commanding His Majesty's Australian Fleet from 30 April 1924 to 30 April 1926.\nEarly life\nWardle was born on 9 January 1877 in the village of Winshill near Burton-on-Trent. the son of Henry Wardle then a Member of Parliament for Burton on Trent.\nNaval career\nWardle joined the Royal Navy on 15 July 1890 when he entered the training ship HMS Britannia, and during his career served at every Royal Navy station. He was appointed midshipman on 15 July 1892 and sub-lieutenant on 15 January 1896 before being promoted to Lieutenant on 15 January 1897.

On 29 February 1916, Alcantara with HMS Andes, came upon the Greif, which appeared to be an unarmed merchant vessel flying a Norwegian flag. While a boarding party was leaving the Alcantara to board Greif the German vessel dropped her flag, opened her bulwarks and opened fire on the Alcantara. The Alcantara caused sufficient damage to the Greif that the vessel was clearly sinking. Firing had ceased and the Alcantara manoeuvred to rescue German sailors finally turning broadside on to the Greif which at this point reopened fire. Despite this the Alcantara saved around 120 German seamen while losing 68 of her own crew. Both Alcantara and Greif  were sunk. Captain Wardle spent 20 minutes in the water before being rescued. For his gallantry in this fight he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He later was in command of HMS Danae and after the end of the First World War he served as chief of the British mission in Greece and later as part of the Reserve Fleet at the Nore, in command of HMS Calliope.\nHe became Rear-Admiral Commanding His Majesty's Australian Fleet from 30 April 1924 until 30 April 1926.
