The entries listed here had de facto control over significant claimed territory and were self-governing with a desire for full independence or, if they lacked such control over their territory, they were recognized by at least one other recognized nation.\nCriteria for inclusion\nThe criteria for inclusion in this list are similar to those of the list of states with limited recognition. To be included here, a polity must have claimed sovereignty, have not been recognized by any widely accepted state for a significant portion of its de facto existence, and either:\n* had a population and an organized government with a capacity to enter into relations with other states; or\n* had de facto control over a territory or a significant portion of the territory of an otherwise-recognized sovereign state\nAfrica\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=190px|Name\n!

Guatemala’s ruling class was appalled by the thought of an illiterate and brutish peasant Governor Rafael Carrera, and led the six western provinces into secession. The new state of Los Altos, under Liberal leadership, appealed for recognition to the UPCA. In January 1840, Carrera reconquered Los Altos, and then defeated the UPCA's army in March, sounding the death knell for the United Provinces.

The local Mayan people revolted in 1847 following the Republic of Yucatán's second secession from Mexico, driving nearly all whites from the Yucatán peninsula in what became known as the Caste War. After being defeated, some rebel Maya established a stratified religious community in the jungle known as Chan Santa Cruz, which remained a base of operations for rebel Cruzobs for the next fifty years.

Immediately his spokesmen announced the integration of a revolutionary provisional government based in Santiago de los Caballeros. The Cibaenians launched a manifesto and expressed that they did it to \"shake off the yoke of Mr. Báez's government that they do not know from now and declare themselves governed (until a congress elected by direct vote, constitute new powers) by a provisional revolutionary government, with its seat in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.\"\nGeneral José Desiderio Valverde was chosen as president of the anti-Báez and Santana provisional government, and the lawyer Benigno Filomeno Rojas as vice president. Both counted on the support of the tobacco producers and the Cibaenian trade.\nAmong its first measures was the organization of an armed movement to march to the city of Santo Domingo, in order to overthrow President Buenaventura Báez, who was prepared to resist. The troops of the provisional revolutionary government of the Cibao were commanded by General Juan Luis Franco Bidó. In a few days they surrounded the city of Santo Domingo, thus initiating a civil war. The hostilities lasted almost a year. The groups in conflict fought with all the means at their disposal to emerge victorious, increasing violence and destruction in the country.\nThe triumph of the revolution was resounding, Báez renounced power and traveled to exile, but the project would be frustrated, since the liberal thinking of the Cibaenians would be overshadowed by the military figure of General Pedro Santana, who returned to the Presidency of the Republic in 1858 and ignored the liberal constitution of Moca.\nIn this way, the revolution of July 7, 1857, ended and the liberal constitution of Moca was annulled. Santana returned to govern with the Constitution of 1854 that guaranteed an authoritarian government.\nThe following day, July 8, 1857, the \"Dominican Republic\" awoke with two government administrations: the provisional revolutionary government of Cibao and the \"government\" of President Buenaventura Báez.\nOn September 25, the provisional revolutionary Government of the Cibao summoned the country to elect the deputies as of December 7, 1857. At that time the women and men of greater intellectual capacity in the Cibao wished to produce a constitution that would allow an authentically democratic and representative government by the people.\n\"The new constitution was drafted in Moca and proclaimed on February 19, 1858.\" That day, the Constituent Assembly meeting in Moca proclaimed the liberal constitution that repealed the conservative one of December 1854.\nEstablished public freedoms and abolished the death penalty for political reasons and enshrined as rights the freedom of expression, free transit and freedom of peaceful assembly.\nHe did not re-elect the president in succession and absolute respect for civil liberties without restrictions, including freedom of expression. established that the capital of the so-called republic, outside the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.\nThe constitution of Moca consecrated free transit and freedom of peaceful assembly.

It was conquered and partitioned by Chile and Argentina.\n|-\n|  Republic of Mississippi\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1861\n| rowspan=\"9\" | Now part of the United States\n| Secessionist state established January 9, 1861 when Mississippi seceded from the United States.

On the trip there, a storm forced his ship aground on the island of Trinidad (no relation to the Caribbean Trinidad) in the South Atlantic. Seeing that the island was uninhabited, Harden-Hickey declared himself Prince James I of Trinidad and advertised for settlers in the London Times. The following year, the United Kingdom annexed the island in order to anchor a transatlantic telegraph cable. Prince James was encouraged, hoping that the cable would bring the attention he needed to start his reign.

The uprising was supported by the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB), then called the Communist Party of Brazil, and the Communist International.\nDespite its failure, the communist revolt gave President Getúlio Vargas the pretext for acquiring more power. After November 1935, the National Congress of Brazil approved a series of laws that restricted its own power, while the executive gained almost unlimited powers of repression. This process culminated in the coup of 10 November 1937, which closed the National Congress of Brazil, canceled the upcoming 1938 presidential elections, and installed Getúlio Vargas as a dictator.

In 2003, the Aguascalientes were replaced by Centers of Autonomous Resistance and Zapatista Rebellion (CRAREZ), a term coined in 2019, which consisted of Caracoles as community centers, over local formations (until 2023) as the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ) governed by Councils of Good Government (Spanish: ).
