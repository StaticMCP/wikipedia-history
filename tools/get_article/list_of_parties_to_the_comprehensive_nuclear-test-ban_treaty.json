Technically they will not be \"parties\" until the treaty enters into force, at which point these states will also be Member States of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which comes into existence upon entry into force of the treaty. Non-contracting states are also listed, including those that are signatories and those are not. States Signatories are Members of the CTBTO Preparatory Commission.\nOn September 24, 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature. All five nuclear weapons states recognized under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) signed the treaty, with 66 other states following that day. Fiji became the first state to ratify the treaty on October 10, 1996. As of November 2024, 187 states have signed and 178 states have ratified the treaty. Most recently, Papua New Guinea ratified the treaty in March 2024.\nSignatures are received at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City by authorized representatives of the state. Ratification is achieved with the approval of either or both chamber of the legislature and executive of the state. The instrument of ratification serves as the document binding the state to the international treaty and can be accepted only with the validating signature of the head of state or other official with full powers to sign it. The instrument is deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nUnder the CTBT, there are 195 Annex 1 states which include a subset of 44 Annex 2 states.\n* Annex 1 states are agreed upon by conference and currently comprise all 193 United Nations member states, the Cook Islands, Holy See and Niue. All Annex 1 states may become members of the Executive Council, the principal decision-making body of the organization responsible for supervising its activities. These states are formally bound to the conditions of the treaty; however, their ratification is not necessary for the treaty to come into effect (unless they are also an Annex 2 state).\n* Annex 2 states are those that formally participated in the 1996 Conference on Disarmament and possessed nuclear power or research reactors at the time. Annex 2 lists the following 44 States: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Vietnam.\nNine Annex&nbsp;2 states have not ratified the treaty: China, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Russia and the United States have already signed the Treaty, whereas India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed it. The treaty will come into force only with the signature and ratification of the above Annex 2 states of the treaty, 180 days after they have all deposited their instruments of ratification.\nSummary\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

During his 2008 presidential election campaign Barack Obama said that \"As president, I will reach out to the Senate to secure the ratification of the CTBT at the earliest practical date.\" In his speech in Prague on April 5, 2009, he announced that \"[To] achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After more than five decades of talks, it is time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.\"\nAn article in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists describes how a North Korean underground nuclear test on May 25, 2009, was detected and the source located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, giving the United States more reason to ratify it.\nSee also\n* List of parties to the Biological Weapons Convention\n* List of parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention\n* List of parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons\n* List of parties to the Ottawa Treaty\n* List of parties to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\n* List of parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n* List of parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons\n*List of parties to weapons of mass destruction treaties\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=XXVI-4&chapter=26&clang=_en Depository website with info on signatures and ratifications]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120504185050/http://www.ctbto.org/member-states/country-profiles/ Country Profiles] on the CTBTO Preparatory Commission Website"
