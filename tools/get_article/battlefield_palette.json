Along with the others in this series of palettes, including the Narmer Palette, it includes some of the first representations of the figures, or glyphs, that became Egyptian hieroglyphs. Most notable on the Battlefield Palette is the standard (iat hieroglyph), and Man-prisoner hieroglyph, probably the forerunner that gave rise to the concept of the Nine bows (representation of foreign tribal enemies).\nThe palette probably dates mostly from the Naqada III (ca. 3300–3100 BC), i.e. late predynastic period, around 3100 BC. The two major pieces of the Battlefield Palette are held by the British and Ashmolean Museums. The palette was likely excavated in Abydos.\nThe Battlefield Palette, two fragments\nUpper fragment, obverse, in the Ashmolean Museum.\nLower fragment, obverse, (28 x 20 cm), in the British Museum.\nThe Battlefield Palette obverse contains the circular defined area for the mixing of a cosmetic substance. It contains the battlefield scene, and forerunners of hieroglyphs: prisoner, tribal-territory wooden standard, the horus-falcon and an ibis bird resting on standards. The fractured lower half of the prisoner on the obverse right may have a hieroglyph at his front (the rectangle, as rounded for land) with suspected papyrus plants attached on top.\nThe reverse of the palette has dramatically stylized versions of a bird, two antelope-like mammals, a vertical palm-tree trunk, a partial top with fruits, and short horizontal palm fronds.\nRobed individual and defeated enemies\nAn individual in robe appears fragmentarily behind naked prisoners. He may be wearing a full-length dress made of leopard skin, and is probably a representative of the victorious Pharaoh standing behind one of the naked prisoner (naked, but for a penile sheath), or a Libyan ally of the Pharaoh. The fragment in front of the prisoner may possibly be part of the ancient sign for \"Libya\", an early enemy of pre-Dynastic Egyptian kings. The character would consist in the throwing stick on top of an oval, meaning \"region\", \"place\", \"island\", a toponym of Libya or Western Delta pronounced THnw, Tjehenw, as seen on the Libyan Palette.\nFile:Man in patterned and fringed dress, behind naked prisoner, The Battlefield Palette 3100 BCE (reconstruction).jpg|Man in patterned and fringed dress (probably a Libyan), behind naked prisoner.\nFile:Prisoners on the Battlefield Palette.jpg|The prisoners on the Battlefield Palette may be people of the Buto-Maadi culture subjected by the Egyptian rulers of Naqada III.\nSee also\n*List of ancient Egyptian palettes\n*Cosmetic palette\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://xoomer.virgilio.it/francescoraf/hesyra/palettes/palettes-scale.htm 3rd fragment, and other Ancient Egypt palettes] and [http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/publications/eras/edition-8/pdf/suelzleimages.pdf Eras Edition 8, November 2006]\n*[https://archive.today/20121224155348/http://web.uct.ac.za/org/cama/CAMA/countries/southafr/projects/artafric/RA1_18.htm Front: the 2-joined pieces]\n*[http://www.ldi5.com/i/archeo/battlefield3.jpg Reverse]\n*[http://xoomer.virgilio.it/francescoraf/hesyra/palettes/Vulptures-Lucerna.htm Photo and graphic of 3rd piece (Lucerne fragment)]\n*[http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft7j49p1sp&doc.view=content&chunk.id=d0e1733&toc.depth=1&anchor.id=0&brand=eschol Article, front side graphic, and Synoptic analysis of Battlefield Palette]"
