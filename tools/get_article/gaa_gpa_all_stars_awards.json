Additionally, one person in each code is selected as Player of the Year.\nThe awards were instituted in 1971. Since 2011 they have been presented jointly by the Gaelic Athletic Association and the representative body for inter-county players, the Gaelic Players Association.\nEach player who receives a nomination is given a medallion marking the milestone.\nIt is considered \"the most coveted sporting award scheme in the country\". Equivalent awards exist for ladies' football, rounders and camogie.\nHistory and procedure\nSince the 1960s there had been a tradition of annually selecting the best player in each position, in football and hurling, to create a special team of the year. Between 1963 and 1967 these players received what was known as the Cú Chulainn award. In 1971 these awards were formalised into the annual GAA All Star Awards. In 2006 the Gaelic Players Association launched a parallel award scheme entitled the GPA Gaelic Team of the Year (often referred to as the GPA Awards). An annual award was also given by the GPA to the Footballer of the Year and the Hurler of the Year.\nIn 2011 it was announced that the GAA All Stars Awards, which had been sponsored in recent years by Vodafone, and the GPA Awards would merge under the sponsorship of car manufacturer Opel. The move announced by Christy Cooney saw the achievements of players recognised jointly for the first time in October 2011.\nThe All Stars team comprises the best player in each position, regardless of club or county affiliation. The composition of the All Star teams are decided on the basis of a shortlist compiled by a selection committee of sports journalists from the national media, while the overall winners are chosen by inter-county players themselves. The award is regarded by players as the highest accolade available to them, due to it being picked by their peers. The awards are presented at a gala banquet in November following the end of the Championship season. Both men's teams are honoured with a special holiday where they play an exhibition game. Since 1971 over 1,000 players have been honoured with All Stars Awards. Damien Martin of the Offaly hurling team was the first ever recipient of the award, while in 2004 Paul Galvin of the Kerry football team became the 1,000th winner of the award.\nCarlow and Longford are the only counties in Ireland not to receive an award in either sport.\nIn September 2017 PwC became the new sponsors of the All Star Awards on a four-year deal, with the awards being renamed The PwC All-Stars.\nWinners\nFor a complete listing of all winners see the following articles:\n* All Stars Footballer of the Year\n* All Stars Hurler of the Year\n* List of All Stars Awards winners (football)\n* List of All Stars Awards winners (hurling)\n* All-Time All Star Award (football)\n* All-Time All Star Award (hurling)\n* Ladies' Gaelic football All Stars Awards (Winners)\n* Camogie All Stars Awards (Winners)\n* Rounders All Stars Awards (Winners: Men / Women)\nRecords\nBrothers\nTwenty three sets of brothers have won All Star Awards in hurling.
