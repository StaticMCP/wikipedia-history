The nominations also makes her the first-ever multi-nominee across all categories, a record she shares with Mukhram Sharma nominated for Sadhna and Talaaq, winning for the former. The win also makes her the first performer in Filmfare history to win in both leading and supporting categories.\nMain Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Film\n!style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Madhumati – Bimal Roy Productions – Bimal Roy'\n**Sadhna – B.
