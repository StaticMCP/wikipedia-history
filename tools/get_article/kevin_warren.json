He is the team president and chief executive officer (CEO) for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). He was previously the commissioner of the Big Ten Conference from 2020 to 2023, overseeing negotiations for expansion of the conference.\nWarren played basketball in college, then attended graduate business school and law school, beginning his career in law, sports agency, and player career management.  He began his NFL front office career with the St. Louis Rams in 1997, and was an executive of the organization when it won Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. In 2015, Warren became the first African-American chief operating officer (COO) of an NFL team, during the time he worked for the Minnesota Vikings.\nEarly years\nWarren was born on November 17, 1963, in Phoenix, Arizona. He became interested in sports at an early age, which he attributes to members of his family. His father, Morrison Warren Sr., played football for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1948, and went on to be named president of the 1982 Fiesta Bowl Board of Directors, the first African-American to serve in this position for a major college bowl game. In 2013, Arizona State University (ASU) named Morrison Warren as one of the Top 50 ASU football players of all time. Kevin's eldest brother, Morrison Warren Jr., played football at Stanford in the early 1960s and was one of the first African-American scholarship student-athletes at Stanford.\nAs a young boy, Kevin was struck by a car and forced into traction and a body cast for many months. Doctors informed Warren that there was a chance he might not walk again, and therefore it was highly unlikely that he would ever fulfill any dreams he had of playing sports. A doctor told Kevin that aquatic rehabilitation exercises may be his only hope at recovery. Since there was not an easily accessible pool in Kevin's neighborhood, Kevin's family used the money from the insurance settlement received following the car accident to construct a pool in his backyard. Aided by his dedication to swimming, Warren recovered and went on to be recruited to play college basketball.\nEducation\nAfter graduating from Marcos De Niza High School, Warren entered the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The following year, he left Penn to attend Grand Canyon University, a Christian university in Arizona where he earned his undergraduate degree in Business Administration in 1986.\nFollowing his graduation from Grand Canyon University, Warren attended Arizona State University where he earned his Master of Business Administration in 1988. He subsequently attended the University of Notre Dame Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor in 1990. In November 2019, Warren was inducted into the 42nd annual W.P.

In Warren's senior season of 1985–86, he averaged 23.3 points per game, which also ranks as the fourth-best season average in GCU basketball history. On November 17, 1984, Warren posted a 42-point performance against Concordia College. That performance is the fourth-highest single game scoring total in school history.\nWarren earned GTE/CoSida Second Team Academic All-America honors as a senior, and added NAIA Academic All-America & NAIA District 7 Basketball Team honors as both a junior and senior.
