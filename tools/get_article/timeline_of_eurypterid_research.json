      "text": "# Timeline of eurypterid research\n\nby James E. De Kay (1825).]]\nThis timeline of eurypterid research is a chronologically ordered list of important fossil discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and taxonomic revisions of eurypterids, a group of extinct aquatic arthropods closely related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs that lived during the Paleozoic Era.\nThe scientific study of eurypterids began in the early 19th century when James E. DeKay recognized a fossil that had previously been described as that of a fish as arthropod in nature. Though DeKay erroneously believed the fossil to represent a crustacean and a missing link between trilobites and branchiopods, the fossil became the type species of first ever eurypterid to be scientifically described, Eurypterus remipes, in 1825.\nOver 250 species of eurypterids in 74 recognized valid genera have been described since the discovery of Eurypterus remipes. The most recent genus to be described is Terropterus (2021) and the most recent species is its type species Terropterus xiushanensis (2021).\n19th century\n. Eurypterus was the first eurypterid to be described.]]\n1810s\n1818\n* The first eurypterid fossil to be discovered is unearthed in rocks in New York of Silurian age. It is described by Dr. S. L. Mitchill as an example of the fish Silurus, possibly due to the catfish-like appearance of its carapace.\n1820s\n1825\n* James E. DeKay recognized the fossil described by Mitchill as an arthropod and named it Eurypterus remipes, the first eurypterid to be described scientifically. DeKay interpreted the animal as a crustacean and as the missing link between trilobites and branchiopods.\n1830s\n. Fossils of Hibbertopterus were first discovered in 1831.]]\n1831\n* John Scouler examines and figures fossil remains from Lower Carboniferous Scotland which will later be referred to Hibbertopterus scouleri.\n*Scouler described the genus Eidothea based on a single fossil without designating a species name.\n1836\n*Samuel Hibbert describes the species Eurypterus scouleri, later transferred to its own genus, Hibbertopterus''.\n*Scouler's Eidothea is discovered to be pre-occupied by a genus of plant, his fossil is found to be similar to Eurypterus scouleri.\n1838\n* Stepan S. Kutorga described the species Limulus oculatus as an extinct horseshoe crab.\n1839\n* Louis Agassiz described the new genus Pterygotus, believing the fossils to represent a large fish.\n1840s\n. Pterygotus was described in 1839 and its fossils were first thought to be fossils of fish.]]\n1843\n* Burmeister created the family Eurypteridae to contain Eurypterus.\n1844\n* Agassiz recognized Pterygotus as an arthropod after the discovery of more complete remains, he classified it as a crustacean of the Entomostraca subclass.\n1849\n* Agassiz described the species Pterygotus anglicus.\n1850s\n. Adelophthalmus was first described in 1854 and has had a complicated taxonomic history ever since.]]\n1851\n* Hermann Jordan excavates the first fossils of the genus Adelophthalmus.\n1852\n* John William Salter described the species Pterygotus problematicus.\n1854\n* Jordan and Hermann von Meyer describe the new species and genus Adelophthalmus granosus.\n1855\n* August Emanuel von Reuss described the new species and genus Lepidoderma imhofi.\n1856\n*Salter described the new genus Himantopterus (the genus name was replaced in 1859 by Erettopterus) and the new species H. acuminatus, H. banksii, H. bilobus, H. lanceolatus, H. maximus and H. perornatus.\n*Salter described the species Pterygotus acuminata.\n*Page transferred Pterygotus acuminata to its own genus, Slimonia.\n*Page named and figured, but did not thoroughly describe, the genus Stylonurus.\n1859\n* Hall describes the species Pterygotus marcophthalmus. It will later be considered part of the genus Acutiramus.\n* Hall describes the species Pterygotus osborni.\n*Hall describes the species Pterygotus cobbi.\n*Salter names a subgenus of Pterygotus, Erettopterus, for species with a bilobed telson.\n*Salter described the species Slimonia stylops.\n*Salter described the species Eurypterus abbreviatus.\n*Salter described the species Pterygotus ludensis.\n*Salter described the species Pterygotus punctatus.\n*Salter described the species Eurypterus pygmaeus, later recognized as representing fossils of Nanahughmilleria.\n*Salter and Thomas Henry Huxley describe the fossil specimens that will later be named Necrogammarus salweyi, believing them to represent some sort of crustacean.\n1860s\n. Though first named in 1856, Stylonurus'' was not thoroughly described until 1865.]]\n1860\n* Edouard D'Eichwald recognized Kutorga's Limulus oculatus to be highly distinct from Limulus and created the generic name Campylocephalus to contain the species.\n1861\n* John William Dawson named a new species of plant, Selaginites formosus.\n1865\n*Henry Woodward described the genus Stylonurus (named and figured, but not thoroughly described, by David Page in 1856) and raised the rank of the Eurypteridae to that of order, effectively creating the Eurypterida as the taxonomic unit it is seen as today.\n1866\n*Woodward created the subclass Merostomata to contain eurypterids and xiphosurans.\n*Ernst Haeckel classified the Merostomata (containing virtually only the Eurypterida) and Xiphosura within a group he named Gigantostraca within the crustaceans. \"Gigantostraca\" is later treated as a synonym of Mersostomata.\n1868\n* Salter described the species Pterygotus taurinus.\n*Woodward described the species Eurypterus obesus.\n*Woodward described the species Eurypterus scorpioides.\n*Fielding Bradford Meek and Amos Henry Worthen described the new species and genus Anthraconectes mazonensis. Anthraconectes was designated a subgenus of Eurypterus.\n1870s\n, first named in 1875 under the name Eusarcus.]]\n1870\n* Henry Woodward described the species Necrogammarus salweyi, believing it to represent an amphipod.\n1871\n* Dawson reclassified his plant Selaginites formosus as a eurypterid.\n1872\n* Barrande describes Pterygotus bohemicus, later considered part of the genus Acutiramus, P. kopaninensis and P. nobilis.\n*Walcott described the genus and species Echinognathus clevelandi.\n1873\n* Friedrich Goldenberg coined the name Polyzosternites to replace Adelophthalmus.\n1874\n* Samuel Almond Miller described the new genus and species Megalograptus welchi, mistakenly believing the fragmentary fossils to represent a graptolite.\n1875\n* Grote and Pitt describe Pterygotus cummingsi, later considered the type species of Acutiramus.\n*Grote and Pitt describe the species Eusarcus scorpionis.\n1877\n* Dionýs Štúr described the species Eurypterus salmi, later referred to Campylocephalus.\n*Meek and Worthen described the species Eurypterus pennsylvanicus, later referred to Adelophthalmus.\n*Hall described the species Eurypterus mansfieldi, later referred to Adelophthalmus.\n1879\n*John William Dawson described the species Erettopterus canadensis.\n1880s\n. T. boyleyi was first described in 1884 and was for many years considered to be a species of Eurypterus.]]\n1881\n* Pohlman described the species Pterygotus buffaloensis. It is later synonymized with P. cummingsi.\n*Pohlman described the species Erettopterus grandis.\n*The type and only known specimen of Tylopterella boylei (first named Eurypterus boylei) is discovered.\n1882\n* Ben Peach named the genus Glyptoscorpius to include some fossils from the Carboniferous of Scotland, including the species G. perornatus, G. caledonicus and G. kidstoni. He mistakenly believed the fossils to represent the remains of scorpions.\n1883\n*Carl Friedrich Schmidt described the species Erettopterus osiliensis.\n1884\n* The holotype and only known specimen of Vernonopterus minutisculptus is discovered.\n*Joseph Frederick Whiteaves described the species Eurypterus boylei.\n*Hall described the species Eurypterus prominens.\n1888\n* Hall and Clarke described the species Eurypterus approximatus, later referred to Adelophthalmus.\n* Woodward described the species Eurypterus wilsoni, later referred to Adelophthalmus.\n1889\n*Matthew described the new genus and species Bunodella horrida as a crustacean.\n*Dewalque described the species Eurypterus lohesti.\n1890s\n. Carcinosoma was coined as a replacement name for the preoccupied name Eurysoma in 1890, the same year its type species was described.]]\n1890\n* Edward Waller Claypole described the genus and species Eurysoma newlini. Later that same year he discovered Eurysoma to be pre-occupied, and coined the replacement name Carcinosoma.\n*Pereira de Lima described the species Eurypterus douvillei, later referred to Adelophthalmus.\n1893\n* In the work Anatomy and Relations of the Eurypterida (1893), Malcolm Laurie added considerably to the knowledge and discussion of eurypterid anatomy and relations. He focused on how the eurypterids related to each other and to trilobites, crustaceans, scorpions, other arachnids and horseshoe crabs.\n1896\n*Gerhard Holm described the species Eurypterus fischeri. His description was so elaborate that the species became one of the most completely known of all extinct animals, so much so that the knowledge of E. fischeri was comparable with the knowledge of its modern relatives (such as the Atlantic horseshoe crab). The description also helped solidify the close relationship between the eurypterids and other chelicerates by showcasing numerous homologies between the two groups.\n*Samuel Almond Miller and William Frank Eugene Gurley described the species Eurypterus kokomoensis, later considered the type species of the genus Onychopterella.\n1898\n* Semper described the species Pterygotus barrandei and Eurypterus acrocephalus.\n1899\n* Laurie described the species Slimonia dubia.\n*Laurie described the species Eurypterus scoticus.\n*McCoy described the species Pterygotus australis, the first eurypterid known from Australia.\n*Fraipont described the species Eurypterus dewalquei.\n20th century\n1900s\n, once thought to represent the oldest eurypterid but today recognized as a strabopid.]]\n1901\n*Charles Emerson Beecher described the new genus and species Strabops thacheri as the only Cambrian eurypterid.\n1902\n* Sarle described the species Pterygotus monroensis.\n1903\n*Clifton J.

They also name the genus Tylopterus (later Tylopterella) and the family Pterygotidae. There are also numerous taxonomic revisions. Eurypterus obesus and E. acrocephalus are referred to the genus Eusarcus. The genus Carcinosoma, to which the species Eurypterus scorpioides and Eurypterus scoticus are transferred, is designated as a junior synonym of Eusarcus. The species Eurypterus kokomoensis is raised to the subgeneric level under the subgenus name Onychopterus.\n1914\n* Otto Jaekel described the new species Pterygotus rhenaniae, later designated as the type species of Jaekelopterus.\n*Erwin H. Barbour described the new species Anthraconectes nebraskensis. The discovery helped reinforce the idea as Adelophthalmus (or Anthraconectes) as a freshwater animal.\n1915\n* Xavier Stainier described the species Eurypterus dumonti, later referred to Adelophthalmus.\n*Ellis W. Shuler described the species Stylonurus (Ctenopterus) alveolatus, later referred to Megalograptus.\n1916\n*Thomas Edmund Savage described the species Eurypterus pumilus.\n1920s\n(right) and paratype (left) of Pittsfordipterus phelpsae.
