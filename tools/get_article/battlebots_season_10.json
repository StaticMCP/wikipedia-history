This is the third season of Battlebots to premiere on Discovery Channel and the fifth season since the show was rebooted in 2015. The show introduced a new modified logo, with a pair of large red and blue \"B\"s, making a  \"BB\" logo atop the term \"BATTLEBOTS\".  The subtitle \"Fight Night\" was used for episodes featuring qualifying rounds.\nMLB/NFL Sportscaster Chris Rose and former UFC fighter Kenny Florian returned to host for this tenth season, (fifth season of the reboot) of the BattleBots competition on Discovery. Also, arena announcer Faruq Tauheed, and his unique introductions, returned, as well as pit reporter Jenny Taft.\nBrand new this season are the \"box-side suites\", where the builders/teams can get a \"bots-eye\" look at the action. They have a chance to \"scout or shout\" for the rest of the field.\nPete Abrahamson (a.k.a. \"Bot-Whisperer\") joins as a new team member who started competing in the first BattleBots Competition in 1994 with his famous robot, Ronin.\nJudges\nThis season, the judges score on an 11-point scale: 5 points for damage; 3 points for aggression; and 3 points for control.\nThe current judges are: former BattleBots contenders, Derek Young, Lisa Winter, and Jason Bardis.\nContestants\nThis season marked the 21st year of the BattleBots competition. The lineup features 62 of the best heavyweight robots to fight head-to-head in the Battle Arena. Their goal is to earn a top 32 ranking and qualify for the post-season where there will be knockout rounds until a winner-take-all fight to crown the 2020 BattleBots World Champion.\nIn previous seasons, an in-studio audience from the general population was present around the BattleBox to watch the event and add crowd reactions for the broadcast program. Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions during the recording of the episodes, the in-studio audience consisted only of the competing teams, with significant separation between the teams.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:1000px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#00AC6D\"|Contestants\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The 2020 regular season kicks off as 62 teams from all over the world converge for an all-out tournament. Tonight, Jack Barker with his beloved bot, End Game squares off with Ray Billings with his iconic robot, the fearsome Tombstone.\nFight Card: SawBlaze vs. Whiplash; Fusion vs. MadCatter; Malice vs. Axe Backwards; Skorpios vs. Bloodsport; Lock-Jaw vs. Captain Shrederator; Rusty vs. Sporkinok; SMEEEEEEEEEEE vs. Sharkoprion; Main Event: End Game vs. Tombstone.\n----\nThe winners were SawBlaze (KO), MadCatter (KO), Malice (KO), Bloodsport (KO), Lock-Jaw (KO), Rusty (KO), SMEEEEEEEEEEE (3-0 UD), and End Game (KO)\n|LineColor= 00AC6D\n}}\n|Viewers=0.906\n|ShortSummary= It's a clash of the titans as the big bots do battle in the box. Four brand new bots make their rookie debut, including an 11-year-old driver. Meanwhile, a \"ghostly\" legend returns from the past.

They only have one more chance in the battle box to assert their dominance over their opponents. If they don't, they could be pushed out of the Top 32. A giant bot makes its historic season debut after two years by getting a facelift as a 500-pound 'walker' bot. A frog-bot battles it out with a cat-bot. A fan-favorite takes on a 'bloody' bot in a messy main event.\n----\nFight Card: Tombstone vs. Slap Box; Pain Train vs. SlamMow!; Perfect Phoenix vs. Skorpios; Ribbot vs. MadCatter; Chomp vs. Gamma 9; Malice vs. Shatter!; Main Event: End Game vs. Bloodsport.\n----\nThe winners were Tombstone (KO), SlamMow!

Two legendary bots, Witch-Doctor and Kraken who lost their first matches go bot-to-bot in the Box. Vegas newcomer JackPot rolls the dice against comeback veteran bot Ghost Raptor. Also, flipper bot Hydra has an enormous surprise in store for HUGE in a controversial fight.\n----\nFight Card: Black Dragon vs. Claw Viper; Ghost Raptor vs. JackPot; GRABOT vs. SubZero; HUGE vs. Hydra; Aegis vs. Fusion; Big Dill vs. Lock-Jaw; Main Event: Kraken vs Witch Doctor.\n----\nThe winners were Black Dragon (KO), JackPot (KO), SubZero (KO), Hydra (3-0 UD),  Fusion (KO), Lock-Jaw (3-0 UD), and Kraken (3-0 UD)\n|LineColor= 00AC6D\n}}\n|Viewers=0.910\n|ShortSummary=It's the mid-point of the qualifying round and impressing the selection committee is what it's all about. Sparks fly around the BattleBox as several winless bots go head-to-head. Valkyrie and Rotator square off in a deadly battle of horizontal spinners. Also, surprise winning bots Malice and MadCatter duke it out while MIT grads Uppercut and SawBlaze meet each other in an explosive main event to see who will get their first loss.\n----\nFight Card: Rotator vs. Valkyrie; Extinguisher vs. Gigabyte; Slap Box vs. Sharkoprion; Malice vs MadCatter; Atom #94 vs. Tantrum; Pain Train vs. SMEEEEEEEEEEE; Main Event: Uppercut vs. SawBlaze\n----\nThe winners were Valkyrie (3-0 UD), Gigabyte (KO), Slap Box (KO), MadCatter (KO), Tantrum (KO), Pain Train (2-1 SD), and Uppercut (KO)\n|LineColor= 00AC6D\n}}\n|Viewers=0.763\n|ShortSummary=As BattleBots closes in on the end of the final qualifying rounds, the remaining bots need to impress the selection committee who will soon pick the 32 most-lethal bots to make it into the world championship tournament. A loss by any of these teams could cripple their season. With a few fights left, this is one of these teams' chances to prove they belong among the best bots.\n----\nFight Card: Axe Backwards vs. Captain Shrederator; Copperhead vs. P1; Rusty vs. Beta; Mammoth vs. HyperShock; SubZero vs. Sporkinok; Bale Spear vs. Tracer; Main Event; Gruff vs. Whiplash\n----\nThe winners were Captain Shrederator (KO), Copperhead (KO), Beta (KO), HyperShock (KO), SubZero (KO), Tracer (KO), and Whiplash (3-0 UD)\n----\nDigital-exclusive fights: (mentioned but unaired in this episode) (winners in bold): P1 vs. Chronos; Deadlift vs. Bale Spear; HiJinx vs. Tracer\n|LineColor= 00AC6D\n}}\n|Viewers=0.840\n|ShortSummary=Some of the most notorious bots that have either undefeated or balanced records prepare for their third and final chance to impress the selection committee and do some damage inside the BattleBox as they try to make it into the Top 32 of the world championship tournament.\n----\nFight Card: HUGE vs. Kraken; Ribbot vs. Axolotl; Big Dill vs. Rotator; Lock-Jaw vs. Jackpot; Chronos vs. Bloodsport; Fusion vs. War? EZ!; Main Event; Skorpios vs. Tombstone\n----\nThe winners were HUGE (3-0 UD), Ribbot (KO), Rotator (KO), Jackpot (KO), Bloodsport (3-0 UD), Fusion (KO), and Skorpios (KO)\n----\nDigital-exclusive fights: (mentioned but unaired in this episode) (winners in bold): War? EZ! vs. Axolotl; SlamMow! vs. War? EZ!\n|LineColor= 00AC6D\n}}\n|Viewers=0.849\n|ShortSummary=It's the final round of the qualifiers. Some bots are on the brink of making it to the Top 32 while others it's do or die time in the BattleBox. Will the top teams risk it in order to get a better seed in the tournament? One bad hit could wreak havoc on their season. For the rest, it's playing for pride and letting it all hang out to spoil the best bots' chances, making a statement to impress the selection committee.\n----\nFight Card: Captain Shrederator vs. Shatter!; Gigabyte vs. Claw Viper; Chomp vs. HiJinx; Witch Doctor vs. SlamMow!; Extinguisher vs. Gruff; Perfect Phoenix vs. Atom #94; Main Event; Copperhead vs. Black Dragon\n----\nThe winners were Shatter!

So it's the last chance for some of the bots to qualify and have an opportunity to influence the selection committee to make it into the Top 32. Plus, seeds will be determined for the BattleBots World Championship bracket.\n----\nFight Card: Hydra vs. Uppercut; Rusty vs. SawBlaze; Gamma 9 vs. Tantrum; End Game vs. HyperShock; SMEEEEEEEEEEE vs. P1; Beta vs. Grabot; Main Event; Whiplash vs. Valkyrie\n----\nThe winners were Hydra (3-0 UD), SawBlaze (3-0 UD), Tantrum (KO), End Game (KO), P1 (KO), Beta (KO), and Whiplash (3-0 UD)\n|LineColor= 00AC6D\n}}\n|Viewers=0.828\n|ShortSummary= It's time for the Round of 32 of the World Championship. Low-seeded bots try to punch their ticket into the next round by trying to defeat the top bots. So there's danger in every match as up-and-coming teams look to shake up the tournament bracket.\n----\nFight Card: #12 MadCatter vs. #21 Tombstone; #5 Black Dragon vs. #28 SlawMow!; #13 Beta vs. #20 Ribbot; #4 Uppercut vs. #29 HiJinx; #9 Valkyrie vs. #24 SubZero; #8 Whiplash vs. #25 HUGE; #16 Malice vs. #17 Gigabyte; #1 Hydra vs. #32 HyperShock\n----\nThe winners were Tombstone (KO, 128 seconds), Black Dragon (KO, 128 seconds), Ribbot (KO, 70 seconds), Uppercut (KO, 33 seconds), Valkyrie (KO, 99 seconds), Whiplash (3-0 UD), Gigabyte (KO, 162 seconds), and Hydra (KO, 178 seconds)\n|LineColor= 00AC6D\n}}\n|Viewers=0.910\n|ShortSummary=It's win-or-go-home time for the 16 remaining bots as the Round of 32 concludes. The winning teams move onto the Round of 16, and one step closer to the World Championship.\n----\nFight Card: #14 Lock-Jaw vs. #19 Shatter!; #11 JackPot vs. #22 Rotator; #6 End Game vs. #27 Perfect Phoenix; #3 Copperhead vs. #30 Mammoth;  #7 SawBlaze vs. #26 Kraken; #2 Bloodsport vs. #31 Gruff; #15 Fusion vs. #18 Tantrum; #10 Skorpios vs. #23 Witch Doctor\n----\nThe winners were Shatter!
