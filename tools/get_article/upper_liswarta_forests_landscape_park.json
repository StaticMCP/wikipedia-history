Peat bogs and spring areas are often found here. In addition to the landscape of fishponds, there are also landscapes: with the predominance of fresh mixed forest habitats; coniferous forests and mixed forests dominated by pine monocultures and the landscape of river valleys with fragments of willow and poplar riparian forests and peat bogs.\nHistory\nThe first working delineation of the park's boundaries in the area of the upper Liswarta River basin was made by Janusz Herezniak and Izabella Maszczynska in 1982-1983. However, due to the fact that the Law on Spatial Development came into force in 1994, it was not until 1996 that the design documentation for the \"Lasy nad Górną Liswartą\" Landscape Park was prepared.\nReferences"
