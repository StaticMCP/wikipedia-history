The stadium opened in 2002 as the Walkers Stadium and has a capacity of 32,259. The club attracted worldwide attention when they lifted the Premier League title on the site in 2016.\nHistory\nBackground and construction\nLeicester City's previous stadium was at nearby Filbert Street from 1891 to 2002, located less than 300 yards away from the current site.\nFilbert Street was gradually upgraded during the 20th century and with the advent of the Taylor Report in January 1990 requiring all clubs in the top two divisions to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Leicester's directors began to investigate building a new stadium soon after the Taylor Report recommendations were announced, but decided to take the redevelopment option by building a new stand on one side of Filbert Street and fitting seats into the remaining standing areas, giving the stadium a 21,500 all-seated capacity by the 1994–95 season.\nFilbert Street's conversion to an all-seater stadium coincided with their promotion to the Premier League after a seven-year exile from the top flight, and with their relegation after just one season it appeared the 21,500 capacity would be adequate. However, success in the late 1990s saw crowds rise, which meant virtually every game at Filbert Street was a sell-out by the end of the decade. Relocation was soon back on the cards; several clubs had relocated to new stadiums around this time, including fellow Midlands clubs Stoke City and Derby County.\nSome parts of the ground – the East and North Stands in particular – were also somewhat outdated, which led the manager, Martin O'Neill to joke that when he showed Filbert Street to new signings he led them backwards out of the players tunnel to prevent them from seeing the East Stand.\nIn early 1998, plans were announced for a 40,000 all-seater stadium to be built at Bede Island South in time for the 2000–01 season, but they were abandoned on 5 January 2000. Chairman John Elsom vowed other options, including relocation to another site or even further redevelopment of Filbert Street, would be considered, hoping either option would have materialised by August 2002.\nThe relocation option was soon settled upon, as plans were unveiled on 2 November 2000 for a 32,000-seat stadium in the Freeman's Wharf area, situated alongside the River Soar. The stadium was expected to be completed in time for the 2003–04 season, although it was suggested at the time relocation could happen at the start of the 2002–03 season. Work on the stadium began in the summer of 2001, and by 10 October that year it was confirmed the new stadium would be ready for the 2002–03 season. The stadium was completed on time in the summer of 2002, ready for Leicester to take up residence for the start of the 2002–03 season.\nThe stadium cost £35-37 million to build. Designed by architects The Miller Partnership, it was constructed by Birse Stadia (the specialist stadium division of Birse Construction). After becoming official contractors, Martin Peat, managing director of Birse Building said: \"We are delighted to have been selected by Leicester City Football Club as construction partners for their new stadium which, when completed, will be one of the finest in Europe.\" The club's chief executive Steve Kind described the stadium as a \"flagship development, not just for the club but for the community and city of Leicester as a whole.\"\nAs well as being a venue for football, the stadium was originally branded as The Midlands Conference Centre, offering a \"state of the art conference, banqueting and catering facility unparalleled in the East Midlands.\" At the time of building, two large dual-purpose concourses, which could be used as exhibition centres on non-matchdays, were a first in British stadium design.\nOpening\nThe stadium was officially opened by former Leicester striker Gary Lineker on 23 July 2002. He used a giant pair of scissors to cut a ribbon on the pitch after arriving at the stadium in a Walkers lorry. The first game at the new stadium was a friendly against Basque team Athletic Bilbao, on 4 August 2002. Manager Micky Adams described the stadium in the club's pre-match programme: “I am sure everyone will agree our new home is pretty special. Spectacular, I’d call it. Fantastic seems to be the word used by most people to describe the surroundings and the facilities. It’s certainly a stadium befitting the 21st century.\"\nThe game finished 1–1, with Tiko scoring the first goal at the stadium, and Jordan Stewart scoring Leicester's first goal. The attendance was approximately 24,000 (no official figure was recorded due to a computer problem). The first competitive match took place six days later and Leicester beat Watford 2–0 in front of a near-capacity crowd of 31,022. Brian Deane scored both goals, including the stadium's first in competitive games. Leicester ended the 2002–03 season promoted back to the Premier League, losing just two home games in the season, despite spending the early part of the season in receivership due to their huge debts, until a takeover deal was completed.\nOwnership\nThe cost of the new stadium, combined with relegation from the Premiership, the collapse of the English transfer market due to the introduction of the transfer window and the collapse of ITV Digital meant Leicester went into receivership shortly after moving to the new stadium. Birse Construction who had built the stadium therefore lost a large part of their fee, and they withdrew from football ground construction.\nAs part of the deal which brought the club out of receivership, the stadium's ownership reverted to American academic retirement fund TIAA–CREF, who had supplied £28&nbsp;million via a bond scheme towards the stadium's construction, with the club taking a long-term lease while the bond repayments were made.\nOn 1 March 2013, owners King Power purchased the stadium through their company K Power Holdings Co, Ltd.\nDevelopment\nSince 2014, the stadium has operated at full capacity for league games. In 2015, vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha stated plans were in place to increase the ground's capacity to around 42,000. In April 2018, it was announced that initial planning for the expansion and development of King Power Stadium was underway. On 28 July 2021, Leicester City confirmed that they would reveal plans to the public which included increasing the capacity to 40,000, as well as several development projects in the area surrounding the stadium. The club announced on 25 October 2021, that they had submitted a hybrid planning application to Leicester City Council for the redevelopment of King Power Stadium and the surrounding area. They had also applied for permits in September 2021 to begin early enabling works in preparation for the redevelopment. In August 2022, the stadium became the first in Europe to operate a frictionless kiosk for food and drink purchases. In September 2022, plans were provisionally approved for the expansion of King Power Stadium's capacity to 40,000. The other development projects were also given provisional approval. On 14 December 2023, the club announced that they had received formal approval from Leicester City Council to begin development works, following initial approval in September 2022.\nHelicopter crash\nOn 27 October 2018, a Leonardo AW169 helicopter carrying club chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others crashed in a car park outside the stadium. The crash happened shortly after the helicopter took off from the pitch, and there were no survivors on board. The Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Memorial Garden opened a year later on 27 October 2019, before The Khun Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Statue was unveiled on 4 April 2022.\nNaming\nThe stadium from the River Soar, looking towards the West Stand.\nIn 2002, former Leicester City shirt sponsors Walkers signed a ten-year deal for naming rights. The stadium was originally to have been called the \"Walkers Bowl\", but the name was dropped after fans objected on the grounds the name was too \"American\" (referring to the American college football bowl game concept). As a result of a fans' petition, the name was quickly changed to the \"Walkers Stadium\". However, some fans at the time were still unhappy that the name only referenced the sponsor, with no reference to Leicester City. The agreement for naming rights was superseded halfway through the ten-year period, in May 2007, when Walkers again paid a seven-figure sum to extend their sponsorship of the stadium until 2017. On 5 July 2011, naming rights were sold to King Power, who took ownership of the club in August 2010.\nSince opening in 2002, the stands inside the stadium have had various names but are currently titled the North, East, South (Spion Kop) and West respectively. The North Stand was originally called the Lineker Stand, after former player Gary Lineker, and the South Stand was originally named the Fosse Stand, after the club's founding name Leicester Fosse. The stadium is often referred to as Filbert Way after the site's address, which retains a link with the club's former home ground Filbert Street. It is also referred to as Freeman's Wharf, after the area in which the stadium is situated. During the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the stadium was known as the Leicester City Stadium and this is the same for UEFA competitions.\nNotable matches and events\nMen's football\nThe first game at the stadium was a friendly against Spanish team Athletic Bilbao, on 4 August 2002. The game finished 1–1, with Tiko scoring the first goal at the stadium, and Jordan Stewart scoring Leicester's first goal.\nDuring their absence from Wembley, the England national football team played a home friendly game against Serbia and Montenegro at the stadium on 3 June 2003. Goals from Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole gave England a 2–1 victory. On 12 October of the same year, the ground hosted an international friendly match between Brazil and Jamaica, with Roberto Carlos scoring the winner.\nOn 20 May 2006, the stadium hosted the Football Conference play-off final between Hereford United and Halifax Town. A goal in extra time gave Hereford a 3–2 win and promotion to the Football League. Nine days later, the ground was also the venue for another international friendly, with Ghana beating Jamaica 4–1.\nOn 12 October 2007, it hosted the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 3 match between England's under-21s and Montenegro's under-21s. The hosts edged out the visitors 1–0 with Matt Derbyshire's goal.\nOn 26 April 2008, Leicester City played Sheffield Wednesday in their last home game of the 2007–08 Championship season. The match was played in front of a crowd of 31,892 supporters, which was the largest home attendance in the league on the day, and Leicester's highest home attendance of the season. The match finished 1–3 to Sheffield Wednesday, and following a 0–0 draw away at Stoke City on 4 May 2008, the club were relegated to League One, the third tier of English football, for the first time in their history. Prior to this season, Leicester were one of nine clubs to have never competed outside of England's top two divisions.\nOn 30 July 2011, Leicester City played a strong Real Madrid side in the Npower Cup in front of 32,188 fans, with star players such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká playing for Madrid. After falling behind to a first-half goal from José Callejón, and a second on the hour from Karim Benzema, Sven-Göran Eriksson's men pulled a goal back a minute from the end through substitute Lloyd Dyer.\nOn 4 April 2014, Leicester won 2–1 against Sheffield Wednesday. The win put them on the brink of promotion back to the Premier League after 10 years, and on the following day, the club's Premier League status was confirmed as results went in their favour.\nOn 3 May 2014, Leicester lifted the 2013–14 Championship title at home to Doncaster Rovers. This was the club's 7th second tier title.\nOn 21 September 2014, Leicester went on to produce one of the greatest comebacks in Premier League history, as they won 5–3 against Manchester United at King Power Stadium. They came back from 3–1 down with 30 minutes left to score four goals.\nOn 8 August 2015, the stadium recorded its current highest ever league attendance of 32,242. Leicester won 4–2 against Sunderland in their first match of the 2015–16 Premier League season.\nOn 7 May 2016, Leicester City lifted the 2015–16 Premier League trophy following a 3–1 win over Everton, less than a week after officially becoming champions as Tottenham Hotspur failed to beat Chelsea. Andrea Bocelli performed live before the match.\nOn 27 September 2016, the stadium hosted its first ever competitive European football match since opening in 2002. Leicester won 1–0 against Porto in the UEFA Champions League.\nOn 14 March 2017, at the stadium the club played its UEFA Champions League last-16 second leg fixture against Sevilla. The match finished 2–0 on the night, and 3–2 on aggregate which resulted in Leicester reaching the quarter-finals of the competition.\nOn 11 September 2018, the stadium hosted a friendly between the England national team and Switzerland. England won 1–0 with a goal from Marcus Rashford. Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell made his England debut as a 79th-minute substitute at his home stadium.\nOn 30 July 2022, the stadium hosted the FA Community Shield due to Wembley hosting the final of UEFA Women's Euro 2022 on the following day. As the holders, Leicester City were invited to host. This made Leicester the only club to host this fixture at two different stadia, following Filbert Street in 1971.\nOn 25 March 2023, the stadium hosted its fourth England international match to date. England U21s played against France U21s in a friendly.\nOn 4 May 2024, the club lifted the 2023–24 Championship title at home to Blackburn Rovers. This was Leicester's 8th second tier title.\nInternational matches\n|score      = 2–1\n|report     =\n|team2      =\n|goals1     = Gerrard  J.

The plan would have seen the two clubs form a jointly owned company to buy the stadium from, then owners, Teachers. The deal was abandoned in 2005 as the clubs failed to fully agree terms.\nDue to the continued parlous state of the football club's finances, rumours that groundsharing was still being discussed continued to circulate, with some suggestions Tigers were considering buying the stadium outright from Teachers. In 2007, a permanent groundshare was ruled out as Leicester Tigers received planning consent for a major expansion of their own Welford Road venue, with a new 10,500-seat stand taking Welford Road to a capacity of 24,500.\nLeicester Tigers played six matches at the stadium in total. The first three were either to capitalise on the larger capacity with the greater interest in high-profile games, or when competition rules demanded the match be played away from their normal home ground. The other three matches were played due to the demolition of the old Caterpillar Stand at Welford Road.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n! Competition\n! Opponents\n!
