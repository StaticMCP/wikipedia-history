The majority of the Citizens' Party formed the Conservative Party the following year, but its left wing under former Prime Minister Sigurður Eggerz kept going under the Independence Party name until they formed the Liberal Party in 1927.\nThe Liberal Party contested the 1927 election, but only got Sigurður elected. In 1929 the party reunited with the Conservatives to establish the new Independence Party, which became the dominant political force in Iceland.\nReferences"
