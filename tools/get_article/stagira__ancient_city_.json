It is chiefly known for being the birthplace of Aristotle, the Greek philosopher and polymath, student of Plato, and teacher of Alexander the Great. The ruins of the city lie approximately  northeast of the present-day village of Stagira, and adjacent to the town of Olympiada.\nHistory\nStagira was founded in 655&nbsp;BC by Ionian settlers from Andros. Xerxes I of Persia occupied it in 480&nbsp;BC. The city later joined the Delian League, led by Athens, but left in 424&nbsp;BC: as a result, the Athenian demagogue Cleon laid siege to it in 422&nbsp;BC. However, Cleon was a poor strategist and his conduct of the siege was very inefficient: so much so that the ancient Greek comedy writer Aristophanes satirised him in the play The Knights.  Cleon died in the same year, in the battle of Amphipolis. Later, during the Peloponnesian War, Stagira sided with Sparta against the Athenians.\nIn 348&nbsp;BC, Philip II of Macedon occupied and destroyed the city. In return for Aristotle's tutoring of his son Alexander, Philip later rebuilt the city and resettled the old city's inhabitants. Many new structures were built at this time, including an aqueduct, two shrines to Demeter, and many houses.\nTradition has it that the natives of Stageira transferred Aristotle's relics to the city, buried it there, and founded a festival in his honour which was called \"Aristoteleia\".\nMuch later, the Danish archaeologist Karl Frederik Kinch made several explorations of Chalkidiki in 1886, and he identified the site of Stagira based on ancient descriptions of it.\nNotable people\n* Aristotle, philosopher also known as Stagirite\n* Hipparchus (Ἵππαρχος), philosopher, acquaintance and kin of Aristotle\n* Nicomachus, father of Aristotle and doctor\n* Arimneste, sister of Aristotle\n* Nicomachus, son of Aristotle and philosopher\n* Herpyllis, companion (and potentially second wife) of Aristotle and the mother of Nicomachus\n* Nicanor of Stageira\nSee also\n* List of ancient Greek cities\n* Aigai, Macedon\n* Pella\n*  Mieza\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Daniel Vainstub, \"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348351413_A_Phoenician_Votive_Inscription_on_a_Figurine_from_Stageira_and_the_Root_TN_in_A_Lemaire_ed_Pheniciens_d%27Orient_et_d%27Occident_Melanges_Josette_Elayi_Cahiers_de_l%27Institut_du_Proche-Orient_Ancien_du_Co A Phoenician Votive Inscription on a Figurine from Stageira and the Root ṬNʾ]\", in A.
