The book chronicles the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the Watergate break-in through the resignations of Nixon Administration officials H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman in April 1973, and the revelation of the Oval Office Watergate tapes by Alexander Butterfield three months later. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the Post, naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source Deep Throat, whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and former managing editor of The New York Times, has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein \"maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time.\"\nA film adaptation, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, was released in 1976. The same year, a sequel to the book, The Final Days'', was published, which chronicled the last months of Richard Nixon's presidency, starting around the time their previous book ended.\nBackground\nWoodward and Bernstein had considered the idea of writing a book about Watergate, but did not commit until actor Robert Redford expressed interest in purchasing the film rights. In ''Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of \"All the President's Men\"'', Woodward noted that Redford played an important role in changing the book's narrative from a story about the Watergate events to one about their investigations and reportage of the story and was thus successful in transferring the content from one medium and one genre to another (see: media adequacy).''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778867/ Telling the Truth about Lies: the Making of 'All the Presidents Men']''from Internet Movie Database\nThe name of the book alludes to the nursery rhyme about Humpty Dumpty (\"All the king's horses and all the king's men / Couldn't put Humpty together again\"). An allusion similar to that was made more explicitly a quarter-century earlier in Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel ''All the King's Men'', which describes the career of a fictional corrupt governor, loosely based on Huey Long.\nImportant individuals\nThe President\n* Richard Nixon\nThe President's men\nThey are listed with their 1972 positions in either the president's executive staff or in his re-election committee, where applicable.\nWhite House\n* Alexander Butterfield, Deputy Assistant to the President\n* Dwight Chapin, Deputy Assistant to the President\n* Ken W.
