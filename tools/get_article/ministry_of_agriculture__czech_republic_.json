Established under Act No. 2/1969 Coll., it oversees veterinary care, phytosanitary care, food safety, animal welfare, and the protection of plant varieties and animal breeds.\nKey Responsibilities\nThe ministry is responsible for defining legal regulations for agriculture, forestry, and food production, ensuring alignment with EU policies and the Common Agricultural Policy. It also manages EU market measures, direct payments, and rural development programs in collaboration with the State Agricultural Intervention Fund. Additionally, it oversees 43 subordinate organizations, including research institutes and non-governmental bodies, and organizes commodity exchanges for agricultural and forestry products.\nAgricultural Context\nAgriculture plays a significant role in the Czech Republic, covering approximately 54% of the country's land, with 0.42 hectares per capita. Over 90% of farmland is leased, and large-scale farms, exceeding 50 hectares, dominate the sector. Employment in agriculture has been steadily declining since the 1990s, with only about 2.9% of the workforce engaged in the industry. The ministry also prioritizes environmental sustainability, promoting multifunctional agriculture that integrates production with landscape maintenance, environmental services, and rural development.\nAddress and Structure\nThe ministry is headquartered at Tesnov 17, Prague, and employs between 11 and 50 staff members. As a government body, it focuses on harmonizing agricultural development with environmental and social goals, adhering to the principles of the \"European Agricultural Model.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
