It is the highest recognition given by the committee for pioneering and outstanding achievements in adaptive control and learning systems.\nThe award is presented to an individual once in their career, with no age restrictions, in recognition of significant contributions that may include theoretical concepts, methods and algorithms, technological innovations, or influential textbooks. Among nominees with comparable technical merit, priority is given to candidates who have served IFAC in some capacity.\nSelection criteria\nRecipients of the award are selected based on the following criteria:\n* Quality and impact of publications\n* Engineering and industrial leadership\n* Service to IFAC and international recognition\nRecipients\n* [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281177500 Han-Fu Chen] (2019) – Professor at the [University of New Brunswick]. Recognized for technical contributions to adaptive control, identification, and stochastic approximation, as well as for service to IFAC.\n* Miroslav Krstic (2023) – Distinguished Professor at [University of California, San Diego]. Recognized for contributions to adaptive control in nonlinear, PDE, and delay systems, and for the theory and application of extremum-seeking methods.\n* Petros Ioannou (2025) – Professor at [University of Southern California]. Recognized for pioneering developments of robust adaptive control and its applications.\nReferences\n* [IFAC TC 1.2 – Adaptive and Learning Systems](https://tc.ifac-control.org/1/2/awards/past-tc-award-winners)"
