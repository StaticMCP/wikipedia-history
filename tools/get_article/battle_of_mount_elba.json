Clayton's cavalry force crossed the Saline at Mount Elba, after sweeping aside a small guard force.\nClayton divided his forces and sent part to establish a blocking position to the west near Marks Mill. One hundred picked men under lieutenants Greathouse and Young were then dispatched to destroy the Confederate pontoon bridge at Longview, Arkansas. On March 29, the lieutenants surprised and captured approximately 250 soldiers belonging to Brigadier General Thomas P. Dockery's brigade at Longview.\nBattle\nConfederate forces in the area were now alerted to the presence of Clayton's raiders and attempted to cut off Clayton's command by attacking their bridgehead at Mount Elba on March 30, 1864. Clayton was successful in re-crossing the Saline, defeating Confederate forces at the Battle of Mount Elba and returned to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, with over 260 prisoners. The Union's casualties throughout the expeditions were only two dead and eight missing. The first Union action of the Union expedition was a complete success, but the rest of the expedition would not go as planned.\nReferences"
