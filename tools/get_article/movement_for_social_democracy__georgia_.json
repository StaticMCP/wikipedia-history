At the event, the movement’s leaders presented their manifesto, outlining their goals and calling for broader public participation.\nThe founding members included activists, legal experts, and professionals with experience in civic engagement. As part of its initial steps, the movement announced plans to develop a comprehensive program document in the coming months and actively recruit new members to support its initiatives.\nIdeology\nThe movement positions itself as a left-wing force dedicated to social justice, equality, and democracy, drawing inspiration from both European social democracy and Georgia’s historical socialist traditions. The movement frames Georgia’s post-independence era as one of systemic economic and social exploitation by political elites, leading to inequality, authoritarian tendencies, and stagnation. It seeks to challenge both the current and former ruling parties, accusing them of prioritizing either neoliberal economic policies that deepened inequality or nationalist rhetoric that fosters division.\nThe movement emphasizes the need for a robust welfare state, labor rights, accessible healthcare and education, and a fair judicial system. Viewing European integration as a key avenue for building a just and progressive society, movement advocates for grassroots mobilization and expanding the pro-European protest movement into a structured political force. Its leaders stress the importance of active civic participation, rejecting reliance on external powers to shape Georgia’s future, and instead calling for collective effort to build a democratic, socially equitable state.\nReferences"
