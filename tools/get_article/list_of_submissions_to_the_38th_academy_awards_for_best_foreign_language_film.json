The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 38th Academy Awards, fifteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Hungary submitted a film to the competition for the first time. The five nominated films came from Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Japan and Sweden.\nCzechoslovakia won for the first time with The Shop on Main Street by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos, which was also nominated for Best Actress (Ida Kamińska) in the subsequent ceremony (39th Academy Awards). With its win, Czechoslovakia became the first Eastern Bloc country to win an Academy Award, during the peak of the Cold War.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
