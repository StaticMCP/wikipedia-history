A possible direct detection was announced in 2025 using the Gemini Observatory instrument ‘Alopeke with high resolution imaging. Siwarha is estimated to have roughly 1.5 solar masses and orbit approximately 4 astronomical units from Betelgeuse.  Its presence, if confirmed, could explain Betelgeuse’s observed six-year periodic fluctuations in brightness, a phenomenon long suspected to be caused by an unseen stellar companion.\nNomenclature\nSteve Howell, credited for recognizing that the observatory's instruments were capable of such a task, proposed a name. The name \"Betelgeuse\" derives from Arabic, meaning “the hand of al-Jawza’,\" a figure of an old Arabian legend. Howell's team unofficially named the hypothetical companion, \"Siwarha,\" meaning \"her bracelet,\" symbolizing its close position to its companion. If confirmed, the star would be given the Bayer designation \"α Orionis B.\" The discoverers of the candidate companion star Betelgeuse B proposed the name Siwarha, which means her bracelet in Arabic and has been officially recognized by the\nIAU Working Group on Star Names since 22 September 2025.\nEvidence\nIn studies of Betelgeuse published in 1985 and 1986, a team led by Margarita Karovska analyzed polarization data from 1968 through 1983, which indicated the existence of two companion stars. The closer one was estimated to have an orbital period of about 2.1&nbsp;years. By using speckle interferometry, the team concluded that it was located at  () from the main star at a position angle of 273°, an orbit that would potentially place it within the star's chromosphere. The more distant companion was found at  () at a position angle of 278°.\nIn 2024, two studies found evidence for a companion star. One study found that a not yet directly observed, dust-modulating star or compact object of  at a distance of  would be the most likely solution for Betelgeuse's 2,170-day (5.94-year) secondary periodicity, fluctuating radial velocity, moderate radius and low variation in effective temperature. A second study produced by a different group of researchers examined observational data spanning a century, also suggesting a close-in stellar companion, possibly less massive and luminous than the Sun with an orbital period of 5.78&nbsp;years. It is expected to be engulfed by Betelgeuse within 10,000&nbsp;years. Jared Goldberg, an astrophysicist researching the phenomenon, nicknamed the companion star \"Betelbuddy\".\nIn May 2025, studies based on UV and X-ray observations excluded the possibility that the companion is a compact star, suggesting it is likely a low-mass young stellar object. Such objects have X-ray luminosities comparable with those observed in Betelgeuse. Based on those observations, the mass of the companion should be less than , and is more likely less than .\nA possible direct detection with the Gemini North Observatory (instrument ‘Alopeke) was announced in July&nbsp;2025, based on observations made in 2020 and 2024. The 2020 observations were taken during the Great Dimming event, and at a time when the stellar companion was predicted to be unobservable because it was directly in-line with Betelgeuse itself. The 2024 observations were taken three days after the predicted time of greatest elongation for the companion. A comparison of the 2020 and 2024 data revealed no companion in 2020 (as expected) and the probable detection of a companion in 2024. The presumed stellar companion has an angular separation of  and was then positioned east of north, which is in excellent agreement with predictions from dynamical considerations. The presumed companion is roughly 6&nbsp;magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466&nbsp;nm. The observations indicate the companion has 1.6&nbsp;times the mass of the Sun and is likely a young F-type pre-main-sequence star, which is about 6&nbsp;magnitudes fainter than its primary star at optical wavelengths. However, at only ]]}} significance, this is not a confirmed detection.\nReferences"
