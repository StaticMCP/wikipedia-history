The unusually complete specimen measured  in total length and had a mantle length of . Specimens such as this, if properly preserved, can provide important scientific data long after they are collected; the animal pictured had its beak morphometrics and tentacle morphology studied by Roeleveld (2000) and Roeleveld (2002), respectively.]]\nThis list of giant squid specimens and sightings from the 20th century is a comprehensive timeline of human encounters with members of the genus Architeuthis, popularly known as giant squid. It includes animals that were caught by fishermen, found washed ashore, recovered (in whole or in part) from sperm whales and other predatory species, as well as those reliably sighted at sea. The list also covers specimens incorrectly assigned to the genus Architeuthis in original descriptions or later publications.\nBackground\nThe frequency of documented giant squid encounters greatly increased throughout the 20th century, providing much insight into the species's biology and life history. It was found that giant squid are preyed upon not only by sperm whales but by a wide range of other animals, including albacore (#193), lancetfish (#149 and 164; see #48 for 19th century record), swordfish (#232), blue sharks (#215 and 375), Portuguese dogfish (#203), shortfin mako sharks (#205 and 431), sleeper sharks (#396, 405, 430, 432, and 433), and northern elephant seals (#279 and 332). One specimen taken alive by troll was reportedly attacked by a false killer whale during retrieval (#247).\nObservations of live and freshly dead animals also revealed new aspects of giant squid behaviour, including rapid colour change (#254 and 391) and high-speed swimming at the surface (#106), though the veracity of the latter observation has been questioned. Additionally, examinations of dead specimens and partial remains provided data on diet (#226 and 412), longevity and habitat (#369, 371, and 374), depth of occurrence and buoyancy (#246 and 266), metabolism and locomotory ability (#411), as well as tentacle regeneration and internal parasites (#169). New preservation methods, including plastination (#429), were also trialled.\nThe large-scale commercial exploitation of sperm whales, particularly from the end of World War II to the 1970s, provided a rich source of giant squid remains for scientific study. The vast majority of these consisted of disarticulated beaks (with up to 47 found in a single sperm whale stomach; #331), though more substantial remains were occasionally recovered, including even whole adult specimens (#84, 128, 137, 151, 209, 225, and 234),Bannister, 1972:6; [[#Anon1980|[Anon.], 1980:27]] with one reportedly showing signs of life after being vomited (#128). The most important figure in the study of ingested giant squid remains was marine biologist Malcolm Clarke, who authored around a dozen relevant papers.\nFollowing the flurry of new giant squid species descriptions that characterised the latter half of the 19th century, the 20th century saw only three newly erected species: Architeuthis japonica by Pfeffer (1912:27), based on a specimen caught in Tokyo Bay in 1895 (#67); Architeuthis clarkei by Robson (1933), based on a carcass that washed ashore in Scarborough, England, earlier that year (#107); and Architeuthis nawaji by Cadenat (1935), based on a specimen caught in the Bay of Biscay the same year (#110). The consensus today is that there exists only a single, globally distributed species of giant squid: Architeuthis dux.\nThe second half of the 20th century saw the first serious efforts to photograph or film a live giant squid. Beginning in the late 1980s, most of these early attempts were led by either Frederick Aldrich or Clyde Roper, the two foremost giant squid experts of their time. However, it would not be until the first years of the 21st century that this milestone was finally achieved.\nList of giant squid\n&nbsp;Misidentification (non-architeuthid) &nbsp;Record encompassing multiple specimens &nbsp;Photographed or filmed while alive\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; width: 100%; text-align: left;\" id=\"giantsquidlist\"\n|-\n! # !!

Collected by John McGrath; initially stored frozen at Conche Bait Department before being transferred by EPA plane to Frederick Aldrich at Memorial University of Newfoundland on 7 November (where temporarily held at animal house to allow viewing by students), following three weeks of bad weather that prevented plane from landing at Conche. Weighed on Air Canada baggage scales at Torbay Airport. Said to be most discussed biological specimen in university's history. Already partially dissected by morning of 9 November; Aldrich and undergraduate student Sylvia Ruby made comparative study of its nervous system and that of commercially important Illex illecebrosus. Illustrations taken of dissected parts, together with ~150 b&w photos and ~60–70 colour photos. Nancy Frances Button (née Frost) of New Melbourne, Trinity Bay, who was person \"most closely connected\" to last good specimen from Newfoundland in 1935 (#111), was brought in to examine remains and said to have been \"tremendous help\" to Aldrich and others, for whom this was their first giant squid specimen. Two classes (Biology 230 and Biology 591) and upper level students allowed to examine remains. Great effort made to use Newfoundland news media to spread information on find to general public and request information on future specimens. Stomach empty; cestode found in caecum by Pippy & Aldrich (1969). Tentacular regeneration documented by Aldrich & Aldrich (1968); one of two published records of limb regeneration in architeuthids (as identified by Imperadore & Fiorito, 2018), the other being a case of arm and sucker regeneration in #54 (see also #549). Postulated to have died of natural causes. Frederick Aldrich included a photo of this specimen in a 1965 letter to Paul Fye, director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, proposing to use DSV Alvin to study the giant squid in its natural habitat. Served as main basis for \"life-sized\" giant squid model at Peabody Museum of Natural History.\n|-\n| 170 || 5 December 1964 || Chapel Arm, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland{NWA} || Found dead on bottom || Architeuthis dux Steenstrup, 1857 || Entire || None; discarded || Female || ML: 126&nbsp;cm; additional measurements and description || None; Aldrich specimen No. 2 || Ferman (1965:6); Aldrich (1991:466, fig. 5) || Stoker (1965:8); Downer (1965:8); Aldrich (1968:395) || Possibly seen alive in September on several occasions.
