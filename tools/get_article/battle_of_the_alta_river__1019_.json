It was part of the Kievan succession crisis of 1015–1019.\nBackground\nAfter the death of prince Volodimer I Sviatoslavich \"the Great\" in 1015, a fierce struggle for the Kievan throne broke out between his sons. Initially, the eldest son Sviatopolk succeeded him as prince, and managed to eliminate several brothers who apparently competed for the succession, including Boris and Gleb. But he was opposed by Yaroslav, who reigned in Novgorod under Volodimer. In the battle of Liubech (Lyubeč) in 1016, Yaroslav's troops defeated the supporters of the Kievan prince, who then fled to the possessions of his father-in-law, the Polish king Bolesław the Brave. In 1018, Bolesław defeated Yaroslav at the Western Bug, and having reached Kiev, restored his son-in-law to the throne. Yaroslav fled to Novgorod and even tried to flee further to Sweden, but was detained by the Novgorodians, who helped him gather a new army, with which Prince Yaroslav again moved on Kiev after Bolesław had returned to Poland.\nCourse of the battle\nWritten about 100 years after the event, the Primary Chronicle (PVL) claims the combat happened at the Alta river, at the site where Boris was allegedly killed by Sviatopolk's assassins four years earlier. It provided the following account of the battle:\n}}\nAftermath\nThe Battle of Alta decided the outcome of the fierce and intense struggle for power between the brothers Yaroslav and Sviatopolk. After suffering a heavy defeat, Sviatopolk reportedly withdrew westward in fear, imagining being chased all the time, even when no one was following him anymore. Using religiously loaded Christian literary devices, the Primary Chronicle claims Sviatopolk was like Cain who killed Abel in Genesis 4 for his fratricide of Boris, Gleb and Sviatoslav the Derevlian, but now defeated and haunted by the devil, and ascribes to him a stressful and painful death somewhere between Czechia (Bohemia) and Lyakh (Poland).\nYaroslav the Wise finally became the uncontested supreme ruler of Kievan Rus'. However, it would be only five more years when another brother, Mstislav of Chernigov, challenged Yaroslav and fought him to a draw at the Battle of Listven (1024).\nReferences\nBibliography\nPrimary sources\n*  (First edition published in 1930.
