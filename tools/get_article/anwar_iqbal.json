He was credited with the production of the first Balochi feature film, Hammal o Mahganj, in Pakistan.\nEarly life\nBorn in Baghdadi, a residential town in Lyari, Karachi, Iqbal was the son of a well-known politician from Balochistan, Haji Muhammed Iqbal Baloch, who played prominent role in the independence of Pakistan as well as in highlighting the importance of Gwadar Port to the Pakistani government.

He then went on to produce the Sindhi drama \"Dosten jo Piar\" three years later. Despite working in plenty of series, his actual breakthrough was with the popular family drama series Shama, which became an immediate success and household name throughout the nation in the late 1970s and early 1980s and is still loved by many even now. He cited his initial success on the silver screen as a result of encouragement by the famous Pakistani writer Fatima Surayya Bajia and veteran director and producer Qasim Jalali. He rapidly emerged as a prominent actor with his memorable role in Shama as \"Nana ki Jan Qamru (The beloved grandson of Qamar)\". His debut as a director began with the Drama \"Ishq Pecha\" in 1984. Since then, he has acted in countless Urdu and Sindhi dramas and directed a few. He was also a popular teacher, teaching at a private school and working with a private TV channel.\nHe was particularly noted for his historical roles, by not only the public but also veteran PTV director Agha Nasir for his portrayal of Shiwani Khan (Muhammad Shaybani) in the PTV Series Babur, the life story of the first Mogul emperor Babur.\nDeath\nIqbal was diabetic and also battling with cancer. He died on 1 July 2021, and his funeral prayers were offered at Baitul Mukarram mosque in Gulshan-i-Iqbal after Isha prayers.
