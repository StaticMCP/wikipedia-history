In the 1980s and early 1990s, Shikha was considered one of the most desirable women in India. She appeared as a lead in 11 movies, some of which were multi-starrers: Anil Sharma's Tahalka, Policewala Gunda, Pranlal Mehta's Police Public, Gulshan Kumar's Naag Mani, Kayda Kanoon, Pyar Hua Chori Chori, Cheetah, Thanedarni, and Awaaz De Kahan Hai.\nHer other popular TV shows are Himesh Reshammiya's Andaaz, Amarprem, Anupama, Sunil Agnihotri's Yug, and Siddhant Vision's Kahan Se Kahan Tak.
