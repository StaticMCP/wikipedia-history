Snoopy is tasked by The Great Pumpkin to run for President of the United States, believing that \"love has left the people across our native land\". Snoopy proceeds to campaign for the presidency and comes up short of winning by a singular vote. Snoopy wins when a stranger raises their hand to cast one last vote for Snoopy, which puts him over the amount needed to clinch the electoral victory, making him President of the United States. The \"stranger\" turns out to be none other than Snoopy's longtime arch-nemesis the Red Baron, who again refers to Snoopy as his friend, referencing their encounter in the previous year's song which depicted their participation in the Christmas Truce of 1914.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
