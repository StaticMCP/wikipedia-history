It allows developers unfamiliar with programming languages such as Objective-C, or who don't want to build native applications using proprietary software development kits (SDKs), to use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build native-looking webapps.\nOriginally known as iphonenav, iUI was created by Joe Hewitt  specifically for iPhone developers with the goal to \"turn ordinary standards-based HTML into a polished, usable interface that meets the high standards set by Apple's own native iPhone apps.\" It gave web applications running on Safari the look of a native application built with the iOS SDK.\nCurrently, iUI supports most smartphones and tablets. Devices independently tested with the framework include: Palm Pre, HTC Dream/T-Mobile G1, HTC Magic/T-Mobile MyTouch 3G, HTC Hero/T-Mobile G2 Touch, Motorola CLIQ, Motorola Droid, Samsung Intercept, and all iOS devices.\niUI has been used to develop a variety of web-applications. Notable examples include Bank of America's Mobile Site and Adelphi University's Mobile Web Application Suite AU2Go.\nSee also\n* JQTouch\n* JQuery Mobile\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
