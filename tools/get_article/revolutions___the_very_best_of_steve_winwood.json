The album includes music from Winwood's solo career, as well as groups with which he has performed, including the Spencer Davis Group, Traffic, and Blind Faith. The CD was released as a box set and a single disc. As of October 2014, the box set is out of print (but can be purchased digitally), while the single disc is still available. The  songs \"The Finer Things\" and \"Roll With It\" are exclusive to the single disc version and cannot be found on the box set.\nIn addition the version of \"The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys\" on both versions of this compilation is a different mix where various solos not on the original album version are heard. There is no indication of this on the album, but like other songs on the compilation, it is clearly different.\nReception\n}}\nStevie Chick from BBC Music writes: \"the four-CD box-set version of Revolutions examines [Winwood's] back-catalogue in great depth, but a simultaneously released 16-track single-CD package is faultless.\"\nTrack listing\n4 CD Box Set\nDisc 1\n#\"Keep on Running\" (Jackie Edwards) 2:49\n#\"Somebody Help Me\" (Edwards) 2:04\n#\"Gimme Some Lovin'\" (Spencer Davis, Steve Winwood, Muff Winwood) 2:58\n#\"I'm a Man\" (Jimmy Miller, Winwood) 2:57\n#\"Paper Sun\" (Jim Capaldi, Winwood) 4:16\n#\"Coloured Rain\" (Capaldi, Winwood, Chris Wood) 2:43\n#\"No Face, No Name, No Number\" (Capaldi, Winwood) 3:33\n#\"Heaven Is in Your Mind\" (Capaldi, Winwood, Wood) 4:18\n#\"Smiling Phases\" (Capaldi, Winwood, Wood) 2:43\n#\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" (Capaldi, Winwood, Wood) 5:40\n#\"Pearly Queen\" (Capaldi, Winwood) 4:20\n#\"40,000 Headmen\" (Capaldi, Miller, Winwood) 3:16\n#\"No Time to Live\" (Capaldi, Winwood) 5:20\n#\"Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring\" (Capaldi, Winwood, Wood) 3:15\n#\"Shanghai Noodle Factory\" (Capaldi, Larry Fallon, Dave Mason, Miller, Winwood, Wood) 5:04\n#\"Medicated Goo\" (Miller, Winwood) 3:37\n#\"Withering Tree\" (Capaldi, Winwood) 3:12\n#\"Well All Right\" (Jerry Allison, Buddy Holly, Joe B.
