For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n9 Geo. 4\nThe second session of the 8th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 29 January 1828 until 28 July 1828.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 9 G. 4.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or '''Lord Tenterden's Act|public|14|09-05-1828|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act for rendering a written Memorandum necessary to the Validity of certain Promises and Engagements.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  or the Offices Pensions Act 1828or the Supply Act 1828|public|28|19-06-1828|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to enlarge the Powers granted to His Majesty under an Act passed in the Fifty-seventh Year of His late Majesty, to enable His Majesty to recompense the Service of Persons holding, or who have held, certain high and efficient Civil Offices.}|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or Lord Lansdowne's Act|public|31|27-06-1828|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for consolidating and amending the Statutes in England relative to Offences against the Person.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for preventing Depredations within the Jurisdiction of the Cinque Ports, and for the Adjustment of Salvage; and for giving further Powers to the Deputy Warden of the Cinque Ports and Lieutenant of Dovor Castle.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n| or the County Asylums Act 1828|public|40|15-07-1828|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Laws for the Erection and Regulation of County Lunatic Asylums.
