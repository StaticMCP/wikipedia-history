The $25,000 annual prize is administered by the Canada Council for the Arts as one of the Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts. Each year the Canadian Museum of History acquires a work from the winning artist for its collection. The award was created in 1977 to honour the 80th birthday of Saidye Bronfman by The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation through a $1.5 million endowment.\nSee also\nList of Laureates\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://saidyebronfmanaward.ca Saidye Bronfman Award]"
