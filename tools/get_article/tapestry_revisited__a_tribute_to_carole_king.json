It features a diverse lineup of artists including Richard Marx, Aretha Franklin, Rod Stewart, Celine Dion, The Bee Gees and Amy Grant. The idea of this release was to re-create King's 1971 album Tapestry track-for-track using other artists.\nThe album peaked at number 53 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold by the RIAA in the United States.\nTrack listing\n| extra3           = Amy Grant\n| length3          = 3:59\n| title4           = Home Again\n| extra4           = Curtis Stigers\n| length4          = 3:41\n| title5           = Beautiful\n| extra5           = Richard Marx\n| length5          = 3:46\n| title6           = Way Over Yonder\n| extra6           = Blessid Union of Souls\n| length6          = 3:54\n| title7           = You've Got a Friend\n| extra7           = BeBe & CeCe Winans featuring Aretha Franklin\n| length7          = 6:03\n| title8           = Where You Lead\n| writer8          =\n| extra8           = Faith Hill\n| length8          = 3:32\n| title9           = Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n| writer9          =\n| extra9           = Bee Gees\n| length9          = 5:02\n| title10          = Smackwater Jack\n| writer10         =\n| extra10          = The Manhattan Transfer\n| length10         = 4:37\n| title11          = Tapestry\n| extra11          = All-4-One\n| length11         = 3:12\n| title12          = (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\n| writer12         =\n| extra12          = Celine Dion\n| length12         = 3:43\n| total_length     = 50:53\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King\n!Chart (1995)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 89\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200\n| 53\n|}\nReferences"
