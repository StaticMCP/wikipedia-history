It contains their best-known singles, \"The Dream Team Is in the House\" and \"Nursery Rhymes\". Kings of the West Coast was their only album to chart on the Billboard 200.\nCritical reception\n}}\nRon Wynn of AllMusic said, \"Rudy Pardee and Chris Wilson didn't become kings or even princes of the West Coast. They came a lot closer to enjoying court jester status, as their 1986 debut contained only one mildly entertaining number, 'Dream Team Is in the House'.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Jeff Adamoff – Art Direction\n* The Real Richie Rich – Producer, Keyboards\n* Courtney Branch – Producer, Engineer, mixing\n* Tracy Kendrick – Producer, Engineer, mixing\n* Ron Larson – Design\n* Chris \"Snake Puppy\" Wilson – Lead Vocals, Drum Machine (Devastating High Velocity Beats)\n* Michael Perison – Keyboards\n* Rudy Pardee – Lead Vocals\n* Aaron Rappoport – Photography\n* L.A.
