He is best known for his biji-style work Qiaoxiang xiaoji (樵香小記 / 樵香小记).\nQiaoxiang xiaoji\nThe Qiaoxiang xiaoji (樵香小记) offers insights into He Xiu's experiences and reflections, characteristic of the biji genre, which blends personal memoir with literary commentary. While specific details about He Xiu's life and other works are scarce, the inclusion of the Qiaoxiang xiaoji in the collection Shoushange congshu 守山阁丛书 of Qian Xizuo 錢熙祚 (d. 1844) shows the appreciation of this book in the literary landscape of the Qing dynasty. This edition was used by the Hanyu da zidian (HYDZD). The work is also included in the Siku quanshu 四庫全書.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Li Xueqin 李學勤, and Lü Wenyu 呂文郁, eds.: Siku da cidian 四庫大辭典, Changchun: Jilin daxue chubanshe 1996 (2 vols.)\n* Hanyu da zidian. 1993 (one-volume ed.)\nExternal links\n* [http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Diverse/qiaoxiangxiaoji.html Qiaoxiang xiaoji 樵香小記] (Chinaknowledge)"
