It took place on Friday, December 13 and Sunday, December 15, 2019, at the UMBC Event Center in Baltimore, Maryland and the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, respectively. Friday's show was a pay-per-view broadcast, while Sunday's was a set of tapings for ROH's flagship program Ring of Honor Wrestling. It was the 18th event under the Final Battle chronology.\nStorylines\nThe event featured professional wrestling matches, which involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that play out on ROH's television programs. Wrestlers portray villains or heroes as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nPCO challenged Rush for the ROH World Championship by virtue of winning an eight-man single elimination tournament to determine the #1 contender for the title at this event. PCO defeated Kenny King in the first round, Dalton Castle in the semifinals and then his Villain Enterprises stablemate Marty Scurll in the final.\nResults\nNight 1 Final Battle (PPV)\n|times   =\n|note1   = pre\n|match1  = Silas Young and Josh Woods defeated Dalton Castle and Joe Hendry\n|stip1   = Tag team match\n|time1   = 09:14\n|note2   = pre\n|match2  = Kenny King (with Amy Rose) defeated Rhett Titus\n|stip2   = Singles match\n|time2   = 11:10\n|note3   = pre\n|match3  = Jeff Cobb defeated Dan Maff\n|stip3   = Singles match\n|time3   = 08:50\n|match4  = Bandido and Flamita defeated Villain Enterprises (Marty Scurll and Flip Gordon) (with Brody King)\n|stip4   = Tag team match\n|time4   = 13:51\n|match5  = Vincent defeated Matt Taven\n|stip5   = Singles match\n|time5   = 13:32\n|match6  = Mark Haskins (with Vicky Haskins) defeated Bully Ray\n|stip6   = Street Fight\n|time6   = 16:30\n|match7  = Alex Shelley defeated Colt Cabana\n|stip7   = Singles match\n|time7   = 06:31\n|match8  = Maria Manic defeated Angelina Love (with Mandy Leon)\n|stip8   = Singles match\n|time8   = 06:24\n|match9  = Dragon Lee defeated Shane Taylor (c) (with Bishop Khan, Malcolm Moses, and Ron Hunt)\n|stip9   = Singles match for the ROH World Television Championship\n|time9   = 14:34\n|match10 = Jay Lethal and Jonathan Gresham defeated The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) (c)\n|stip10  = Tag team match for the ROH World Tag Team Championship\n|time10  = 21:54\n|match11 = PCO (with Destro) defeated Rush (c)\n|stip11  = \"Friday the 13th Massacre\" No Disqualification match for the ROH World Championship\n|time11  = 22:23\n}}\nNight 2: Final Battle Fallout (TV tapings)\n|times   =\n|match1  = Mark Haskins defeated Hallowicked\n|stip1   = Singles match\n|time1   =\n|match2  = Nicole Savoy defeated Sumie Sakai\n|stip2   = Singles match\n|time2   =\n|match3  = Jonathan Gresham defeated Alex Shelley\n|stip3   = Singles match\n|time3   =\n|match4  = Bateman defeated Tracy Williams\n|stip4   = Singles match\n|time4   =\n|match5  = Silas Young and Josh Woods defeated The Briscoes\n|stip5   = #1 contender Tag Team match for the ROH World Tag Team Championship\n|time5   =\n|match6  = Flip Gordon defeated Rey Horus\n|stip6   = Singles match\n|time6   =\n|match7  = Villain Enterprises (PCO and Marty Scurll) defeated Jeff Cobb and Dan Maff\n|stip7   = Tag Team match\n|time7   =\n}}\nReception\nWhen the main event was announced, PCO's election as Rush's rival for the World Championship was questioned, due to his age (51 years old). Also, PCO's title win was criticized. On the December 23, Wrestling Observer Newsletter published a poll where the PCO vs Rush was voted as the worst match of the event. Dave Meltzer gave the match a one star, saying \"There were style issues between the two and the craziness just didn’t work in a world title situation\".\nReferences"
