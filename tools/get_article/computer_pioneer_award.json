      "text": "# Computer Pioneer Award\n\n}}\nThe Computer Pioneer Award was established in 1981 by the Board of Governors of the IEEE Computer Society to recognize and honor the vision of those people whose efforts resulted in the creation and continued vitality of the computer industry. The award is presented to outstanding individuals whose main contribution to the concepts and development of the computer field was made at least fifteen years earlier. The recognition is engraved on a silver medal specially struck for the Society.\nThis award has now been renamed to \"Women of the ENIAC Computer Pioneer Award\".\nAward types\nThe award has two types of recipients:\n* Computer Pioneer Charter Recipients - At the inauguration of this award, the individuals who already meet the Computer Pioneer Award criteria and also have received IEEE Computer Society awards prior to 1981.\n* Computer Pioneer Recipients - Awarded annually since 1981.\nComputer Pioneer Charter Recipients\n* Howard H.
