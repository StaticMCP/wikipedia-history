Awards in several categories are distributed annually  by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency  and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.\"\nThe award was first awarded to India.Arie at the 45th Grammy Awards (2003) for her song \"Little Things\". According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award was presented to artists that had made \"newly recorded urban/alternative performances with vocals\".  The award was intended to recognize artists \"who have been influenced by a cross-section of urban music\" and who create music that is out of the \"mainstream trends\".\nTwo-time recipients include India.Arie, Cee Lo Green (once as part of the duo Gnarls Barkley), and Jill Scott. Erykah Badu, Big Boi (a member of OutKast) and will.i.am (a member of The Black Eyed Peas) share the record for the most nominations, with three each. Sérgio Mendes is the only performer to be nominated twice in one year. The category was dominated by Americans, yet individuals from Jamaica and Côte d'Ivoire also won the award. The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of the Grammys where the category was shifted to the Best R&B Performance category.\nRecipients\nbecame the first recipient of the award in 2003.|alt=A woman wearing an orange dress while singing into a microphone.]]\nand 2008 award winner Jill Scott performing in 2007|alt=A woman wearing a brown dress while smiling and snapping her fingers.]]\naward recipient will.i.am|alt=A man wearing a hat and brown shirt while opening his mouth.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Performing artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Work\n! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2003\n| India.Arie\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2004\n| OutKast\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2005\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2006\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2007\n| Gnarls Barkley\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2008\n|  and Jill Scott\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2009\n|  and will.i.am\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2010\n| India.Arie and Dobet Gnahoré\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"|2011\n|\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nSee also\n* List of Grammy Award categories\n* List of Urban contemporary artists\nReferences\n;General\n*\n*\n;Specific\nExternal links\n*[http://www.grammy.com/ Official site of the Grammy Awards]"
