The trade war emerged alongside other ongoing trade wars both countries were involved with, including the China–United States trade war and the 2025 United States trade war with Canada and Mexico.\nBackground\nTrade relations between China and Canada deteriorated substantially beginning in August 2024, when Canada announced plans to implement substantial tariffs on various Chinese manufactured goods, following similar protectionist measures previously enacted by the United States and European Union. These Western nations collectively cited concerns regarding Chinese government subsidies providing unfair competitive advantages to Chinese industries.\nChronology\n2024\n* October 1 – Canada instituted a 100% tariff on electric vehicles manufactured in China, mirroring similar protectionist measures previously enacted by the United States and European Union.\n* October 15 – Canada implemented an additional 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products, citing concerns about market distortion and unfair competition.\n2025\n* March 8 – China's Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council announced retaliatory tariffs on several Canadian agricultural exports, following an \"anti-discrimination probe\". The products targeted represented significant export sectors for Canadian agricultural producers, particularly in western Canadian provinces where rapeseed production forms a substantial component of agricultural output.\n* March 20 – Implementation date for Chinese tariffs on Canadian goods, including a 100% tariff against Canadian rapeseed oil, peas, and oilcakes, in addition to a 25% tariff on Canadian \"aquatic products\" and pork.\n* July 16 – Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada would impose higher tariffs on steel from China.\n* October 31 – Carney meets with Xi at APEC South Korea 2025 to discuss trade-barriers related to agriculture, canola, electric vehicles, and seafood.\nReactions\nIn Canada\nThe Government of Canada justified its tariff implementation as necessary to protect domestic industries from what it considered to be anti-competitive practices and market distortion by China.\nIn China\nThe Government of China rejected Canada's justification for the tariffs, and instituted retaliatory tariffs following an \"anti-discrimination probe\" conducted by Chinese officials. The investigation reportedly concluded that Canada's earlier restrictive measures against Chinese products had been implemented without proper investigative procedures.\nOn March 8, 2025, China's customs authorities released a statement characterizing Canada's actions as having disregarded \"objective facts and World Trade Organization rules\". The statement specifically outlined what it referred to as discriminatory measures specifically targeting China that infringed on the nation's economic interests while undermining bilateral relations.\nSee also\n* 2025 United States trade war with Canada and Mexico\n*List of the largest trading partners of the United States\n*List of the largest trading partners of China\n*List of largest trading partners of India\n* China–United States trade war\nReferences"
