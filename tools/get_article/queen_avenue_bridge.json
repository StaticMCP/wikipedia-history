The bridge was built in 1905 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nMuch of the significance of the bridge is due to it being the third-oldest reinforced concrete arch bridge in Minnesota.  It also retains most of the integrity of the design from its original plans. It was evaluated in 1989 as part of the Reinforced-Concrete Highway Bridges in Minnesota MPS, and then listed on the National Register that year.\nThe bridge was constructed by the Twin City Rapid Transit Company to replace a wooden bridge spanning the company's private streetcar right-of-way. Stairs at either end of the bridge on the south side provided access to a streetcar stop. The line was abandoned in 1954. In 1971 the Minnesota Streetcar Museum opened the Como-Harriet Streetcar Line along the original right-of-way. The southern end of the line is at the car barn is located under the bridge, accessible from the original west stair.\nSee also\n*Interlachen Bridgesimilar nearby bridge over TCRT right-of-way\nReferences"
