For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n31 & 32 Vict.\nContinuing the third session of the 19th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 19 November 1867 until 31 July 1868.\nPublic general acts\n|note4= }}\n|\n|\n| or the Supply Act 1868|public|10|30-03-1868|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the Sum of Three hundred and sixty-two thousand three hundred und ninety-eight Pounds Nineteen Shillings and Ninepence out of the Consolidated Fund to the Service of the Years ending the Thirty-first Day of March One thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven and the Thirty-first Day of March One thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight.|note4= }}\n|  to make further Provision for the Despatch of Business in the Court of Appeal in Chancery.|note4= }}\n|\n| or the Supply (No. 2) Act 1868|public|13|03-04-1868|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of Six million Pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the Service of the Year ending on the Thirty-first Day of March One thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Supply (No. 3) Act 1868|public|16|29-05-1868|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the Sum of Seventeen million Pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the Service of the Year ending on the Thirty-first Day of March One thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Legitimacy Declaration (Ireland) Act 1868|public|20|29-05-1868|archived=n|An Act to enable Persons in Ireland to establish Legitimacy and the Validity of Marriages, and the Right to be deemed Natural-born Subjects.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Industrial Schools (Ireland) Act 1868|public|25|29-05-1868|archived=n|An Act to extend the Industrial Schools Act to Ireland.}}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Customs and Income Tax Act 1868|public|28|29-05-1868|archived=n|An Act to grant certain Duties of Customs and Income Tax.}}\n|\n|  relating to the Formation of quoad sacra Parishes in Scotland, and to repeal the Act of the Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth Years of the Reign of Victoria, Chapter Seventy-seven. }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to permanent Improvements.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  by abolishing the Rate imposed by the said Act on all Occupiers of Premises within the extended Municipal Boundaries of the City of Edinburgh.|note4= }}\n| or the Thames Embankment, etc. (Loans) Act 1868|public|43|13-07-1868|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for extending the Provisions of The Thames Embankment and Metropolis Improvement (Loans) Act, 1864, and for amending the Powers of the Metropolitan Board of Works in relation to Loans under that Act.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n| or the Prisons (Scotland) Administration Acts (Lanarkshire) Amendment Act 1868|public|50|13-07-1868|archived=n|An Act to amend the Acts for the Administration of Prisons in Scotland in so far as regards the County of Lanark;
