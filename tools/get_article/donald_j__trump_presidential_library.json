Trump Presidential Library is a website administered by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) was launched on January 20, 2021, when President Donald Trump left office as the 45th president after his first term.\nIt serves as a placeholder until a presidential library is built. It will be the 15th NARA-managed presidential library. Plans to build the library and museum remain on hold after Trump began his second, non-consecutive term as the 47th president on January 20, 2025. In September 2025, it was announced that the library would be built at Miami Dade College in Miami, Florida.\nOfficial records\nThe NARA library is established by the Presidential Records Act and is independent of possible plans for a physical building under the Presidential Libraries Act. All current content has been previously available to the public, including websites such as Melania Trump's Be Best, photographs, and social media accounts including @POTUS and @FLOTUS. Other private records from Trump's first term are subject to access requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) from January 2026.\nWhile most records will be open to FOIA requests by 2026, records could be withheld from public access on the basis of executive privilege for up to twelve years.\nOn January 19, 2021, President Trump designated Mark Meadows, Pat Cipollone, John Eisenberg, Patrick Philbin, Scott Gast, Michael Purpura, and Steven Engel as his presidential records representatives to potentially act on his behalf should he be incapacitated and unable to exercise executive privilege with respect to access to his administration's records.\nBuilding plans\nAs with other presidential libraries, a building for Trump would need to be privately financed and organized before the possible involvement of the NARA.\nIn December 2024, Trump won a settlement in an ongoing civil defamation case against ABC News, with the settlement granting Trump $15million to ultimately go to the presidential library.\nIn January 2025, Meta Platforms agreed to settle a lawsuit for $25million following the suspension of Trump's Facebook accounts following the January 6 United States Capitol attack. $22million will go toward the presidential library.\nLocation\nThe exact location of Trump's library has yet to be determined. During Trump's first presidency, it had been speculated that floors in Trump Tower may be dedicated for use as a future presidential library. The Washington Post reported in the final week of the first term of his presidency that two sources close to Trump said he plans to build a library and museum in Florida run by Dan Scavino.\nIn March 2025, it was reported that members of Trump's team were scouting universities in Florida, namely Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Florida International University (FIU), for a potential presidential library. Both locations have extant ties to Trump; FAU is located in Palm Beach County, the same county as his current residence, Mar-a-Lago, and FIU is located in University Park, near the Trump National Doral Miami.\nIn September 2025, President Trump announced plans for his library to be built on Biscayne Boulevard, adjacent to the Freedom Tower, on three acres valued at $67 million. The lot was owned by state-run Miami Dade College. The college's board of trustees met on September 23 and voted to gift the property to the state, and on September 30, the state of Florida approved its use for Trump's presidential library and center. However, on October 14, Florida circuit judge Mavel Ruiz temporarily blocked the land transfer. On November 13, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal rejected Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier's request to have the injunction overturned.\nIncorporation\nThe Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc. was incorporated in Florida on December 20, 2024. This incorporation occurred six days following the disclosure that ABC News had agreed to donate $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by Donald J. Trump against the network. The settlement was intended to support Trump's future presidential foundation and museum.\nOn July 2, 2025, Trump settled another case against Paramount for its work on a 60 Minutes interview that it was argued misled the American public during the 2024 presidential election. Trump was awarded $16 million which will go to the Trump Library.\nPer Florida state corporate records, the corporation was established by Jacob Roth, a Florida-based attorney known for his involvement in forming Trump-related entities, including the establishment of corporations: Trump Vance Inauguration Committee, Inc., and Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc. which along with the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund, Inc. have been involved in the settlement of lawsuits on behalf of Donald Trump and family.\nAccording to the articles of incorporation filed in Florida, the purpose of the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc. is \"to preserve and steward the legacy of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency.\"\nSee also\n* Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case)\n* FBI investigation into Donald Trump's handling of government documents\n* Political positions of Donald Trump\n* N7478D\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
