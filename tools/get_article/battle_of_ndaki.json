JNIM grew in power in late 2017, and soon intensified operations in southern Gao Region and Mopti Region.\nThe Ndaki region is considered a hotspot for Katibat Macina activity, in particular Katibat 3A, named for their leader Almansour Ag Alkassam.\nBattle\nA skirmish broke out between joint Franco-Malian forces in a forest near Ndaki on October 16. Around fifty jihadists attacked Malian forces in the forest from two sides. Malian forces alerted nearby French forces in Operation Barkhane, who sent air support. The French helicopters came under small arms fire from the militants, and the helicopter subsequently responded. Ground troops were soon deployed, and the clashes continued into October 17. Patrick Steiger, spokesman for the French Armed Forces, stated that \"tenacity of the terrorists...suggested that it was either a site important to them or someone important was present.\" That leader was likely Alkassam.\nJNIM abandoned their camp on October 17, after which Malian and French forces seized the site.\nAftermath\nTwo Malian soldiers were injured in the clashes, and one jihadist was killed. Steiger claimed that other wounded or killed jihadists were likely taken away by Katiba 3A overnight.\nReferences"
