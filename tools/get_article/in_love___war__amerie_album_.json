Music gave In Love & War a rating of eight out of ten and lauded Amerie for her \"old-skool virtues\" and sound, while calling the album \"an exemplary exercise in R&B songwriting and performance, brim-full of verve, spark and vigour\". Hot Press writer Patrick Freyne gave the album a rating of three and a half out of five, writing \"Amerie’s got the standard range and power of the production line diva but there’s also an appealingly raw, in need-of-some-Calpol-edge to her voice which gives everything that little bit more power\". The Irish Times gave it three out of four stars, writing that Amerie \"approaches In Love & War with much gusto\".\nIn contrast, Steve Jones of USA Today gave the album 2½ out of four stars and expressed a mixed response towards its ballads, stating \"The sassy funk numbers serve her best, while the mushy stuff only slows her down\".

Boston Herald writer Lauren Carter gave In Love & War a B− rating and commended its \"ambient, hip-hop-infused R&B\" tracks, but wrote that \"monotonous lyrics about rocky or recently ended relationships dominate the album\". However, AllMusic's Andy Kellman gave the album four out of five stars and wrote favorably of its ballads, calling them \"as well constructed as anything earlier in the set\". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave it a rating of honorable mention (), indicating \"an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure\".\nTrack listing\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| total_length    = 51:43\n| title1          = Tell Me You Love Me\n| note1           =\n| writer1         =\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 3:07\n| title2          = Heard 'Em All\n| note2           =\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 3:23\n| title3          = Dangerous\n| note3           =\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          =\n| length3         = 2:48\n| title4          = Higher\n| note4           =\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Campbell\n| length4         = 2:52\n| title5          = Why R U\n| note5           =\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 3:17\n| title6          = Pretty Brown\n| note6           = featuring Trey Songz\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          =\n| length6         = 4:02\n| title7          = More Than Love\n| note7           = featuring Fabolous\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          =\n| length7         = 4:14\n| title8          = Swag Back\n| note8           =\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          =\n| length8         = 4:29\n| title9          = You're a Star\n| note9           = Interlude\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          =\n| length9         = 1:52\n| title10         = Red Eye\n| note10          =\n| writer10        =\n| extra10         =\n| length10        = 4:11\n| title11         = The Flowers\n| note11          =\n| writer11        =\n| extra11         =\n| length11        = 5:16\n| title12         = Different People\n| note12          =\n| writer12        =\n| extra12         = M-Phazes\n| length12        = 3:55\n| title13         = Dear John\n| note13          =\n| writer13        =\n| extra13         =\n| length13        = 4:12\n| title14         = Heard 'Em All\n| note14          = Remix featuring Lil Wayne) (bonus track\n| writer14        =\n| extra14         =\n| length14        = 3:56\n}}\n| extra_column    = Director(s)\n| total_length    = 62:35\n| title15         = Heard 'Em All\n| note15          = Remix featuring 4Minute and Beast\n| writer15        =\n| extra15         =\n| length15        = 3:29\n}}\n| extra_column    = Director(s)\n| total_length    = 59:06\n| title15 = Why R U\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 = Ray Kay\n| length15 = 3:22\n| title16 = Heard 'Em All\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 = Anthony Mandler\n| length16 = 4:01\n}}\nSample credits\n*\"Why R U\" contains a sample of \"Ego Trippin'\" by Ultramagnetic MCs.\n*\"More Than Love\" contains a sample of \"Summer Madness (Live)\" by Kool & the Gang.\n*\"Pretty Brown\" contains a sample of \"Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)\" by Mint Condition.\nPersonnel\nCredits for In Love & War adapted from liner notes.\nMusicians\n* Amerie – Lead vocals, producer, co-writer\n* Trey Songz – featuring artist, co-writer\n* Fabolous – featuring artist, co-writer\n* Lil Wayne – featuring artist, co-writer\n* Francesco Romano – guitar\n* David Siegel – keyboards\n* Sean Windsor – guitar\n* Larry Sommerville – keyboards\n* She McElroy- background vocals,  co-writer\nProduction\n* Karma – producer\n* Eric Hudson – producer\n* L.A.
