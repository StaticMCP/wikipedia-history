The ceremony was hosted by Leonard Brockington, the founding Chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\nFor some time, members of the filmmaking community had been dissatisfied with the administration and structure of the awards. While its management had taken steps to resolve some of the issues, the poor technical quality of the ceremony itself led to media criticism which, many felt, was harming the industry. It was therefore decided that no awards would be presented in the traditional film categories; instead, two amateur awards were presented, and special awards were given to individuals and organizations who had been chosen through a nomination process.\nWinners\n*John Grierson — \"in recognition of his unique contribution to Canada's filmmaking art and industry\".\n*Yorkton Film Council — \"in recognition of its distinguished international film festival, which demonstrates the contribution of the film council movement in Canada\".\n*Associated Screen Studios — \"for its initiative in developing a program of training young personnel to meet the demands of Canada's growing film industry\".\n*Crawley Films — \"in recognition of the company's distinguished production program in the field of educational films\".\n*Reverend Anson C.
