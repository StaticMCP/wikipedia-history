His father, Harry Howard, was a lawyer who founded the London law firm Howard, Kennedy & Rossi. His mother, Betty, was a concert pianist. He was evacuated with his brother Alan to Cleveland, Ohio, during World War Two and returned to London after the war. From 1947 to 1956 he attended University College School (UCS) in London, where he became friends with Alan Blaikley, and from 1956 to 1957 he attended Aiglon College in Villars, Switzerland. After a year working with Granada Television in London, he went to Edinburgh University where he read Social Anthropology.\nHe was cast as a singer, together with fellow London student Eva Hermann, in Varsity Vanities of 1959 and they became known as a vocal duo called \"Eva and Ken\"  They won a weekly slot in Scottish Television's musical show Jigtime, singing songs from around the world, and recorded for Fontana Records. Howard graduated with an MA degree and began working with BBC Television's drama department in White City, London.\nHoward joined forces with two old UCS friends, Alan Blaikley and Paul Overy, and between 1962 and 1963 they ran and edited four issues of a magazine, Axle Quarterly, publishing early work by Melvyn Bragg, Ray Gosling, Alexis Lykiard, Gillian Freeman and Simon Raven amongst others. An offshoot of the Quarterly was a series of five booklets on controversial topics commissioned by Blaikley, Howard and Overy, named Axle Spokes (Axle Publications 1963). These included Peter Graham's The Abortive Renaissance, a critical examination of British New Wave cinema; John Gale's Sex – Is it Easy?, on the emergence of the permissive society; Gavin Millar's Pop! – Hit or Miss?, the British hit-parade in the early days of the Beatles; Anthony Rowley's Another Kind of Loving, homosexuality in the years when it was still a criminal offence in the UK; and Melville Hardiment's Hooked, an enquiry into the extent and nature of drug addiction in the early 1960s.\nSongwriting\nInternational hits in the 1960s and 1970s\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, in collaboration with Alan Blaikley, Ken Howard composed the music and words for many international top 10 hits, including two UK number ones, \"Have I the Right?\" (The Honeycombs) and \"The Legend of Xanadu\" (Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich).\nAmong other performers for whom they wrote were The Herd, Petula Clark, Phil Collins, Sacha Distel, Rolf Harris, Frankie Howerd (the theme song for his film Up Pompeii), Engelbert Humperdinck, Horst Jankowski, Eartha Kitt, Little Eva, Lulu and Matthews Southern Comfort.\nKen Howard and Alan Blaikley were the first British composers to write for Elvis Presley, including the hit \"I've Lost You\" (1970), which he later performed in the film ''That's The Way It Is. Their collaboration with the maverick psychiatrist R. D. Laing led to the release of the cult album Life Before Death.\nHoward and Blaikley's concept album, Ark 2 (1969), performed by Flaming Youth, drew the comment that Blaikley and Howard \"have a wit, gaiety, dignity and melodic flair reminiscent of Leonard Bernstein...which suggest that pop is becoming the serious music – in the proper sense – of the age\"\nTelevision themes\nHoward and Blaikley were responsible for theme and incidental music for several television drama series including The Flame Trees of Thika (1981) and By the Sword Divided (1983–1985), both subsequently aired in the US on Alistair Cooke’s Masterpiece Theatre, and the BBC's long-running series of Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple (1984–1992). Howard also scored BBC TV's BAFTA and Emmy Award-winning Shadowlands with Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland in 1985, Mervyn Peake's Mr Pye with Derek Jacobi and Judy Parfitt, and Ronald Neame's last film, Foreign Body in 1986, plus BBC TV's The Black and Blue Lamp (1988) and The Angry Earth in 1989.\nMusicals\nHoward and Blaikley wrote two West End musicals, Mardi Gras (Prince of Wales Theatre, 1976) and The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (Wyndham's Theatre, 1984–1986), and two BBC TV musicals Orion (1977) (based on the earlier work of Ark 2) and'' Ain't Many Angels'' (1978). They also wrote music and lyrics for the 1990 UK tour of Roald Dahl's Matilda.\nFilm career\nAs a British film maker Howard has worked extensively in drama, music and documentary films.
