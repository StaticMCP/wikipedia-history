It was published by Random House on October 4, 2011 in the United States and by Bodley Head in the United Kingdom on October 6 of the same year. In the book, Sachs criticizes excessive lobbying, as well as a poor response by American government to globalization, and describes American politics as a corporatocracy in which \"powerful corporate interest groups dominate the policy agenda.\" Sachs suggests that both political parties are right-of-center, and identifies four powerful lobbies: the military–industrial complex, the Wall Street–Washington complex, the Big Oil–transport–military complex and the health care industry.\nThe book is 336 pages long. As described by Random House: the book is an \"incisive diagnosis of our country’s economic ills but also an urgent call for Americans to restore the virtues of fairness, honesty, and foresight as the foundations of national prosperity.\"  The title comes from the quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr: \"Taxes are the price we pay for civilization.\"  In the review in The Wall Street Journal, American politician Paul Ryan states: \"Yet at its core The Price of Civilization is not about taxes or economics. It is about the 'pursuit of happiness' as one academic understands it.\"\nThe book focuses on the changes going on in the world, the effects of these changes on the economic conditions and the necessary actions that will be required to deal with these changes in this new world if America is going to succeed.\nSachs criticizes excessive lobbying for interfering with democracy, and sees America's two-party system as stifling lesser parties.}}\nA Chinese translation of the book was published in 2013.\nSee also\n* Corporatocracy\n* Lobbying in the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.sachs?sk=wall Facebook page for Jeffrey Sachs]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.sachs?sk=app_174147272663151 Facebook page for The Price of Civilization]\n*[http://www.randomhouse.com/book/159570/the-price-of-civilization-by-jeffrey-d-sachs Random House profile on book]\n*[http://www.bodleyhead.co.uk/book.asp?ean=9781847920928 Bodley Head UK page for The Price of Civilization]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6qQWBdv1e4 YouTube video on book]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS4yhgdSx1A Interview about the book on The Young Turks]\n*[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/jeffrey-d-sachs/price-civilization/#review Book Review] www.kirkusreviews.com\n*\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/06/price-civilization-jeffrey-sachs-review Review from the Guardian UK.]\n*[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-books-jeffreysachs-idUSTRE7964EK20111007 Reuters review.]\n*[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903703604576589090204327736 WSJ review]\n*[http://www.thetakeaway.org/2011/oct/07/jeffrey-sachs-moral-causes-americas-fiscal-problems/ Interview from WNYC.org The Take Away October 7, 2011]\n*[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/marketnews-19148628/columbia-s-sachs-says-u-s-needs-10-years-to-rebuild-26856319 Interview on  Bloomberg TV October 7, 2011 to discuss book.]\n*[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/morning-joe-uses-charts-to-explain-income-inequality-thats-fueling-occupy-wall-street/ Jeffrey Sachs on Morning Joe discussing The Price of Civilization October 2011]"
