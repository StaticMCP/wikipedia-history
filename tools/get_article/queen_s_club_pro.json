It went by the name of the Professional Championship of the World''' in 1927, gaining the tournament great notability. The tournament was held in October on clay courts, at the Queen's Club, with the hopes that it would become a permanent fixture like the amateur championships (Grand Slams), and be considered one of the major pro events like the US Pro and Bristol Cup. It was discontinued and wasn't held in 1929.\nPast finals\nSingles\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!width=\"150\"|Champion\n!width=\"150\"|Runner-up\n!Score\n|-\n| 1927 ||  Dan Maskell ||  Charles R Read || 6–3, 6–3, 6–4\n|-\n| 1928 ||  Robert Ramillon ||  Edmund Burke || 6–1, 6–3, 5–7, 6–4\n|}\nSee also\n*Major professional tennis tournaments before the Open Era\nReferences"
