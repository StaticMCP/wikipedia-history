It is best known for publishing the international academic journal Medium Ævum and a related monograph series.\nOverview\nThe society was founded at the Taylor Institution of the University of Oxford on 15 February 1932. It evolved from the Arthurian Society of Oxford, which initiated the journal Arthuriana.\nThe object of the society is to advance education by the encouragement of research in medieval languages and literature and the dissemination of that research to the scholarly community and the wider public. The primary focus of the society is on its journal, Medium Ævum, which has run continuously since 1932 alongside a series of monographs. Since its foundation, its membership has also sponsored research bursaries, conferences, and an annual Medium Ævum Essay Prize.\nThe society is a registered charity in the United Kingdom. HMRC recognizes it as an approved professional organization.\nPeople\nPresident: Alastair Minnis\nVice-Presidents: John Hines, Sethina Watson\nEditors of the Journal: Sylvia Huot, Stephen Mossman, David Rundle, Corinne J.
