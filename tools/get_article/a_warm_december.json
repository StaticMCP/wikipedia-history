It also stars Jamaican actress Esther Anderson as Catherine, Matt's love interest. Anderson's performance as an African princess won her an NAACP Image Award for Best Actress in 1973. The film is also notable for an appearance of Letta Mbulu singing, with an African choir,  \"Nonqonqo\" by Miriam Makeba. Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson wrote and conducted the score. The story was influenced by Roman Holiday and Love Story.A Warm December was shot at Pinewood Studios.\nPlot\nDr. Matt Younger is a recently widowed American who takes his daughter Stefanie on a month-long vacation in London. While there, he meets Catherine, the niece of African Ambassador George Oswandu. Catherine is involved in negotiations with the Soviet Union to build a vital hydroelectric project in her country. As the pair begin to develop feelings for one another, Dr. Younger learns that the two men following Catherine are not the sinister characters he suspected. One is a bodyguard sent by her uncle, the other is a doctor monitoring the sickle cell disease that will end her life all too soon. She herself says that she is in the December of her life. When Dr. Younger proposes, Catherine must decide between not only love and loyalty to her country, but also seizing the time that remains to her and saddling the man she loves with her inevitable death. In the end, she refuses, thanking him for a \"warm December.\"\nCast\n* Sidney Poitier as Dr. Matt Younger\n* Esther Anderson as Catherine Oswandu\n* Yvette Curtis as Stefanie Younger\n* George Baker as Dr. Henry Barlow\n* Johnny Sekka as Dr. Joseph Myomo\n* Earl Cameron as George Oswandu\n* Hilary Crane as Marsha Barlow\nReception\nMia Mask reviewed the film for the Jacob Burns Film Center, calling it a \"sensitive and thoughtful film about a dashingly handsome widower who finds true love again.\"\nIn Criterion Confessions, Jamie S. Rich disagreed, finding the film lacking in style and calling it a \"clunker\":Poitier's direction is completely lacking in style, and for an actor, it's surprising how little eye he seems to have for his cast's performances. Anderson is a nondescript love interest, almost completely lacking in the required mystery or charisma. This looks more like a TV movie than a big-screen effort.\nLeonard Maltin gave the film two stars out of four, finding it not excessively sappy, but mediocre.\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1973\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.allmovie.com/movie/a-warm-december-am25320 A Warm December at AllMovie]\n*\n*"
