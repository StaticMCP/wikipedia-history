Vishweshwara is referred to at least in 12 rock edicts and recorded by the Kaifiyaths.\nHistory\nThe temple that belongs to the Maagane that comprises Nandikooru (Adve, Ulluru, Kolachuru), Kalathuru, Kutyaru, Padooru, Belapu and Kunjoor, has a rich history of over 1,000 years. The temple has been renovated and inaugurated in grand functions lasting from 4 March 2009 to 12 March 2009.\nDevotees here pay their respect to Vishweshwara by offering tender coconut Abhishekham, lit oil lamps and gold coins (pawan). It is believed that the god will grant all their prayers. The story goes that Ullaya got pleased with the penance observed by a devotee who belonged to the Kunda Hegde family and as result he descended from Kashi to Yelluru. It is known as the divine place of Swayambhu Saannidhya.\nVadiraja Tirtha's mention of the temple in Tirtha Prabandha\nThe Temple was closed after the day's puja, when Vadiraja reached the temple. Vadiraja therefore stood outside the Temple and prayed to Shankara. Maheshwara, pleased by Vadiraja's prayer opened the door and appeared before Vadiraja, and Vadiraja continued his prayers. Suddenly Nandi appeared and obstructed the meeting. Now Vadiraja prayed to Nandi, who was pleased, sat down. Therefore one can see and worship Vishwanatha now standing anywhere in front of Maheshwara. Vadiraja extols Viswanatha in five slokas.\nOh Maheshwara, you hold a strong Trishula Which has slain, powerful demons like Andhakasura You are quite handsome and are three-eyed,\nAnd you possess a shining and powerful Japamala,\nWhich can wipe out the sins of the devotees.\nYou are destroyer of Daksadwara\nOh Sambho ! we pray to you. 21\nOh Nagabhushana Sambho!\nYou are decorated by serpents.\nWith Ganga on your head You are quite holy and sacred Even saints who are expert musicians Sing of your glory and Praise your valorous acts _\nSuch as Tripura Vijaya md other glories,\nParvati has set her lovely glance you Oh Viswanatha! we pray to you. 22\nAll celestials, including Indra Worship your Lotus feet.\nYou bear half-moon on your head You are Lotus eyed,\nManmatha the God of loye was\nReduced to ashes by your angry look\nYou are the treasure house of noble\nQualities and deep scholarship\nYou are far superior to Mahendra\nOh Shankara, we humbly worship you 23\nAll Yogis like Narada and Sanandana Do sing Md praise your glory,\nYou are blue-necked Oh mind, please do\nWorship the supremely handsome Shankara 24\nOh Tripurari Sambho! Rudrasukta And other Veda Mantras praise your glory.\nYou are always kind to devotees, who worship you with jasmine and bilva patra You always bless those who seek your help Your matted locks are radiant due to The presence of lustrous moon on your head,\nAnd you are a great benefactor of devotees.\nKindly eradicate our evil thoughts\nOh Shankara, we worship you. 25\nVadiraja now turns to the Bull -vehicle Nandi of Shankara and prays to him in one Sloka.\nOh fair coloured Mahanandi, you are Used as the main vehicle of Shankara And possesses beautiful ears, tall\nHoms, feet, stomach, eyes, &face And a majestic hump on your back,\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of the temple is unique and considered a classic one in the view of the Tantragama experts. The age-old temple has been considered as the perfect and unique model of the Devaayathana style of architecture.\nLegends\nVishveshwara is believed to have emerged from underground respecting the devotion of a Samanta Raja of Kuthyar Dynasty. The linga of Shiva thus emerged and was first understood to have been found by a Koraga mother while she was collecting firewood and leaves in the forest where her son \"Yellu\" was buried after his untimely death. While cutting the bush she hit the ground and the earth is said to have started bleeding. Scared by the flow of blood she screamed \"Oh, Maga Yellu, yei Moolu Ullana?\" (meaning 'Oh, my son Yellu, are you here?') in Tulu. In fact it was the \"Linga\" itself, and it is said that the mark of the wound is still on it. The village was thereafter known from Yelluna Ooru to gradually Yellur.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.yelluruvishweshwara.org Official Website]\n*[http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=13.181167&lon=74.797578&z=18&l=0&m=a&v=2 Wikimapia-Yelluru Shri Vishweshwara Temple]"
