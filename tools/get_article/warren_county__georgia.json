Even as the rest of Georgia's demographics have rapidly shifted, Warren County and its surrounding counties have provided a consistent source of support for Democrats for years and frequently are the deciding factors in close elections, as metro Atlanta is usually overwhelmed by Georgia's deeply conservative rural areas. Despite this, Warren County's margins have narrowed in recent years, with Republicans slowly making gains due to the economic challenges that rural Georgia faces. In 2024, Warren County gave Donald Trump the Republican Party's best margin since 1972 due to the Republican Party's active targeting of African-American men and rural voters. However, Warren County remained reliably Democratic.}}\nSee also\n* Central Savannah River Area\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Warren County, Georgia\n*List of counties in Georgia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.warrencountyga.com Warren County, Georgia, Chamber of Commerce]"
