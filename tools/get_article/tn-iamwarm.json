Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) concentrates on the upscaling of water saving technologies in rice and major garden land crops. The total out lay for TNAU is Rs.88.90 crores.\nOverview\nThe focal technologies are systems of rice intensification (Rajarajan 1000), improved production technologies (IPT) on garden pulses, cotton, maize, sunflower, groundnut and gingelly. Promotion of new crops such as thornless bamboo and cocoa intercropping in coconut is also programmed. Precision farming with drip fertigation is also demonstrated with sugarcane, banana, vegetables, tapioca, coconut and flowers. The concept of an organic farming seed village is promoted in the sub basins.\nE-velanmai technology will be tested on a pilot basis. Labour saving implements such as a tractor drawn seed drill, maize husker cum sheller and sunflower thresher will be introduced. A mini dhal mill is introduced. Implements such as a coconut shredder will be introduced under waste recycling. Vermi bag – a cost-effective portable unit will be demonstrated.\nStatistics\nThe project covers 6.17 Lakh Hectares of Ayacut areas in four phases. 55 sub basins were covered in year 2013 with an outlay of Rs.2547 crores.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
