The Vikings' 8–8 record under second-year head coach Brad Childress was an improvement on their 6–10 record in 2006; nonetheless, for the third straight year, the Vikings failed to make the playoffs.\nAlthough they had the worst pass defense in the NFL in 2007, surrendering 4,225 passing yards, the Vikings finished the season with the league's best defense against the run, allowing only 74.1 rushing yards per game, as well as the best rushing offense with running backs Adrian Peterson and Chester Taylor. Peterson was named the Offensive Rookie of the Year for 2007.\nOffseason\nThe Vikings began the 2007 offseason by losing their defensive coordinator, Mike Tomlin, who was hired to be the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 21, 2007. Coach Brad Childress waited until after the Super Bowl to hire Leslie Frazier, who served as special assistant to the head coach/defensive backs coach under Tony Dungy at the Indianapolis Colts. Frazier became the Vikings' new defensive coordinator on February 8. Frazier played cornerback for the 1985 Chicago Bears, and had just won Super Bowl XLI over his former Bears team when he was hired by the Vikings.\n2007 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:lightgreen;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|MVP\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" style=\"\"|2007 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"|Round\n!style=\"\"|Selection\n|-\n!1\n!7\n|bgcolor=lightgreen|Adrian Peterson\n|Running back\n|Oklahoma\n|5 years\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|2\n!41\n|colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Atlanta Falcons\n|\n|-\n!44\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue|Sidney Rice\n|Wide receiver\n|South Carolina\n|4 years\n|From Falcons\n|-\n!3\n!72\n|Marcus McCauley\n|Cornerback\n|Fresno State\n|4 years\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|4\n!102\n|Brian Robison\n|Defensive end\n|Texas\n|4 years\n|From Buccaneers\n|-\n!106\n|colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n|\n|-\n!121\n|colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Denver Broncos\n|From Falcons\n|-\n!5\n!146\n|Aundrae Allison\n|Wide receiver\n|East Carolina\n|4 years\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|6\n!176\n|Rufus Alexander\n|Linebacker\n|Oklahoma\n|4 years\n|From Lions, via Broncos\n|-\n!182\n|colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|7\n!217\n|Tyler Thigpen\n|Quarterback\n|Coastal Carolina\n|4 years\n|\n|-\n!233\n|Chandler Williams\n|Wide receiver\n|FIU\n|4 years\n|From Broncos\n|}\nNotes:\nTransactions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Re-signed\n|-\n!Player!!Position!!Status!!Contract\n|-\n|Chris Kluwe||P||Free agent||1 year ($435,000)\n|-\n|Heath Farwell||LB||Free agent||1 year ($435,000)\n|-\n|Anthony Herrera||G||Free agent||1 year ($850,000)\n|-\n|Spencer Johnson||DT||Free agent||1 year ($850,000)\n|-\n|Richard Owens||TE||Free agent||1 year ($850,000)\n|-\n|Artose Pinner||RB||Free agent||1 year ($850,000)\n|-\n|Darrion Scott||DE||Free agent||1 year ($850,000)\n|-\n|Tank Williams||SS||Free agent||1 year ($595,000)\n|-\n|Drew Henson||QB||Free agent||1 year ($765,000)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Additions\n|-\n!Player!!Position!!Status (previous team)!!Contract\n|-\n|Visanthe Shiancoe||TE||Free agent (NYG)||5 years ($18.2 million)\n|-\n|Vinny Ciurciu||LB||Free agent (CAR)||3 years ($3 million)\n|-\n|Bobby Wade||WR||Free agent (TEN)||5 years ($15 million)\n|-\n|Mike Doss||S||Free agent (IND)||1 year ($1 million)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Departures\n|-\n!Player!!Position!!Status (new team)!!Contract\n|-\n|Jason Whittle||G||Free agent (BUF)||1 year ($720,000)\n|-\n|Fred Smoot||CB||Free agent (WAS)||5 years ($25 million)\n|-\n|Brad Johnson||QB||Free agent (DAL)||3 years ($7.5 million)\n|-\n|Napoleon Harris||LB||Free agent (KC)||6 years ($24 million)\n|-\n|Bethel Johnson||WR||Free agent (PHI)||1 year\n|-\n|Jermaine Wiggins||TE||Free agent (JAC)||1 year ($1 million)\n|}\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\nInt'l\n}}\nPreseason\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"|Week\n!style=\"\"|Date\n!style=\"\"|Opponent\n!style=\"\"|Result\n!style=\"\"|Record\n!style=\"\"|Venue\n!style=\"\"|NFL.comrecap\n|- style=\"background:#fcc\"\n!1\n|August 10\n|St. Louis Rams\n|L 10–13\n|0–1\n|Hubert H.

With regular starting quarterback Tarvaris Jackson recovering from injuries, Kelly Holcomb started in his place. In the first quarter, the Vikings trailed early as Brett Favre threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, surpassing Dan Marino with the 421st touchdown pass of his career. After Favre was honored for his accomplishment, Minnesota narrowed the margin between the two teams to a single point with field goals of 44 and 35 yards from kicker Ryan Longwell, before Mason Crosby hit a 28-yard field goal to restore a four-point lead for the Packers going into halftime.\nIn the third quarter, Crosby and Longwell cancelled each other out with field goals from 44 yards and 48 yards, respectively. In the fourth quarter, Crosby made a 33-yard field goal, before Favre completed a 33-yard touchdown pass to James Jones. Minnesota tried to rebound with Holcomb completing a 15-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Sidney Rice. The Vikings failed with an attempted onside kick, but two plays later Chad Greenway recovered a fumble by Favre, giving the Vikings just under 2 minutes to go 54 yards for a game-tying touchdown. However, after moving into Green Bay territory, Holcomb was subsequently intercepted by Atari Bigby, allowing Favre to kneel out the game.\nAdrian Peterson ran 12 times for 112 yards, making him the first rookie running back since Chuck Foreman to rush for 100 yards in each of his first three games as a Vikings starter.\nWeek 6: at Chicago Bears\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 6: Minnesota Vikings at Chicago Bears&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=October 14\n|Road=Vikings\n|R1=7|R2=7|R3=7|R4=13\n|Home=Bears\n|H1=7|H2=7|H3=0|H4=17\n|stadium=Soldier Field, Chicago\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT/12:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT\n|weather=Sunny,\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Dick Stockton (play-by-play) and Brian Baldinger (color commentator)\n|attendance=62,174\n|referee=Gene Steratore\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-bears-2007-reg-6 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/29272/CHI_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*CHI – Devin Hester 89-yard punt return (Robbie Gould kick), 1:56.

But on the ensuing kickoff, Peterson sprinted all the way down to the Chicago 38-yard line, setting Longwell up for a 55-yard, game-winning field goal.\nWith the win, the Vikings improved to 2–3, largely in part to Peterson's 224 rushing yards, which put him fifth for the most rookie rushing yards in one game. Up to this point, he had a total of 607 rushing yards, which placed him second for the most rookie rushing yards through the first five games, only behind Eric Dickerson.

After a 79-yard pass from wide receiver Sidney Rice to Visanthe Shiancoe on the first play from scrimmage, the Vikings scored on the very next play on a 10-yard run from Chester Taylor. This was followed by a safety when Culpepper was penalized for intentional grounding in his own endzone. Two plays after the ensuing free kick, the Vikings fumbled the ball just inside Oakland territory, allowing the Raiders to set up a 42-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. On the next drive, the Vikings restored their nine-point lead as kicker Ryan Longwell hit a 30-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. A short Oakland drive culminating in 10-yard touchdown pass from Culpepper to tight end John Madsen, followed by another Janikowski field goal, saw the Raiders take the lead for the first time. Four plays later, Minnesota regained a six-point lead on a 38-yard touchdown run from Taylor, but field goals of 42 and 49 yards from Janikowski meant the first half ended with the scores level at 19–19.\nThe Vikings recorded the only score of the third quarter on a 38-yard field goal from Longwell, though they did finish the period on the Raiders' 6-yard line, allowing Taylor to run in his third touchdown on the opening play of the fourth quarter, the first time in his career that he scored three touchdowns in one game. A 52-yard field goal from Janikowski narrowed the margin to 7 points with less than three-and-a-half minutes to play, and after forcing the Vikings to punt just inside the two-minute warning, they had one last chance to level the scores. On the first play of the drive, Culpepper threw the ball in the direction of Justin Fargas, who tipped it up, allowing Chad Greenway to come up with an interception; he went to ground with the ball, but inexplicably got up and attempted to advance it, which allowed left tackle Barry Sims to force a fumble, recovered by right guard Paul McQuistan. That enabled the Raiders to extend their drive, but although they managed to get into Vikings territory, a false start penalty meant Culpepper had to attempt a Hail Mary pass on the final play, but it came up short, giving the Vikings a 29–22 win.\nWeek 12: at New York Giants\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 12: Minnesota Vikings at New York Giants&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=November 25\n|Road=Vikings\n|R1=14|R2=10|R3=3|R4=14\n|Home=Giants\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=3|H4=7\n|stadium=Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EST/12:00&nbsp;p.m. CST\n|weather=Sunny,\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Kenny Albert (play-by-play), Daryl Johnston (color commentator) and Tony Siragusa (sideline reporter)\n|attendance=78,591\n|referee=Walt Anderson\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-giants-2007-reg-12 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/29364/NYG_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*MIN – Sidney Rice 60-yard pass from Tarvaris Jackson (Ryan Longwell kick), 14:19.
