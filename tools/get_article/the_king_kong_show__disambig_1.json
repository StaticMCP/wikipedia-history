ABC ran the series in the United States on Saturday mornings between September 6, 1966, and March 4, 1967. It is the first animated series produced in Japan for an American company (not counting Rankin/Bass' previous Animagic stop motion productions, which were also animated in Japan).\nThis series is an animated adaptation of the famous film monster King Kong with character designs by Jack Davis and Rod Willis. It is also the first animated series in the King Kong franchise.\nPlot summary\nIn this series, the giant ape named Kong befriends the Bond family, with whom he goes on various adventures, fighting monsters, robots, aliens, mad scientists and other threats. Unlike his counterpart from original 1933 film, Kong is a protector of humanity.\nTom of T.H.U.M.B.\nIncluded with King Kong is Tom of T.H.U.M.B., a parody of spy films of the 1960s called Tom of T.H.U.M.B. (based on the character in English folklore 'Tom Thumb'), about a secret agent for T.H.U.M.B. (the Tiny Human Underground Military Bureau) named Tom and his Asian sidekick Swinging Jack, who are accidentally reduced by a shrinking laser ray gun to  tall. The pair are sent out in a variety of miniature vehicles by their bad-tempered boss Chief Homer J. Chief to foil the fiendish plots of M.A.D. (Maladjusted, Anti-social and Darn mean), an evil organization made up of black-hatted and black-cloaked scientists \"bent on destroying the world for their own gains\".\nCast and characters\n* King Kong is the titular giant ape. Kong was discovered on Mondo Island (sometimes known as Skull Island) by Bobby Bond, whom he saved from being eaten by a Tyrannosaurus rex. He saved Bond family from other disasters afterward. Since then, he has become the family's mascot and a hero.\n* Professor Carl Bond (voiced by Bernard Cowan) is the head and father of the Bond family. He is the basis for Rhodes Reason's character Commander Carl Nelson in King Kong Escapes.\n* Susan Bond (voiced by Susan Conway) is Carl's teenage daughter. She is somewhat perplexed by Bobby and Kong's friendship and always the one that knows what Who is up to, Her fear is dreaming about snakes. She is the basis for Linda Jo Miller's character Susan Watson in King Kong Escapes.\n* Bobby Bond (voiced by Billie Mae Richards) is Carl's young son and Kong's closest companion. Bobby is saved by Kong from being eaten by a Tyrannosaurus rex and they are friends since then.\n* Captain Englehorn (voiced by Carl Banas) is Carl's ship captain and a friend to the family. He is based on the character of the same name from the original 1933 King Kong film and its sequel.\n* Dr. Who (voiced by Paul Soles) is a bald, big-headed, and bespectacled mad scientist who wants to capture Kong and use him for his own evil schemes. Despite his name, he has no relation to Doctor Who. He is the basis for Hideyo Amamoto's character of the same name in King Kong Escapes.\n* Mechani-Kong is a mecha modeled after Kong, invented by Who, who operates it via a control room in the mecha's head. Neither the Bonds nor Englehorn ever knows (or even figure out) that Who invented it. It appears in two King Kong segments, \"MechaniKong\" (the second King Kong segment from episode 10) and \"Anchors Away\" (the second King Kong segment from episode 25). Each segment features a different version of Mechani-Kong. It is also Kong's archenemy in King Kong Escapes.\nCrew\n* Producer – William J.

The rest of the series, with the inclusion of Tom of T.H.U.M.B., was broadcast on NET as  Tom Thumb'|キングコング親指トム|Kingu Kongu  Oyayubi Tomu}}, and aired from April 5 to October 4, 1967, with a total of 25 episodes.\nOn November 15, 2005, Sony Wonder released the first eight episodes (two King Kong cartoons separated by a Tom of T.H.U.M.B. cartoon) on two DVD releases titled King Kong: The Animated Series Volume 1 and King Kong: The Animated Series Volume 2. The pilot episode was included, in its two parts for American syndication, between the two DVDs.\nReception\nIn the 2007 book Comics Gone Ape! The Missing Link to Primates in Comics, comics historian Michael Eury writes: \"The Rankin/Bass King Kong was an early case of identity theft, where the Kong name was appropriated (fully under license) to describe a new character that, at best, only remotely resembled his namesake. This was Kong done wrong\".\nLegacy\nThis series, in spite of the lukewarm reception, was successful enough for Rankin/Bass to extend the Kong franchise to another Japanese company, Toho (which had already produced the hit film King Kong vs. Godzilla in 1962). This resulted in two films: Ebirah, Horror of the Deep (originally intended to be a Kong film, with Godzilla exhibiting some of Kong's traits) and King Kong Escapes, which was based on The King Kong Show.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.geocities.jp/cyberkids1954/toeidoga_script.html The King Kong Show overview]—an in-depth Japanese website about the series\n* [http://www.animemorial.net/en/36-Sekai-no-%C3%94ja-King-Kong-Daikai Sekai no Ôja · King Kong Daikai] in Animemorial (the Japanese name of the pilot episode)\n* [http://www.animemorial.net/en/44-King-Kong-001-7-Oyayubi-Tom King Kong · 001 / 7 Oyayubi Tom] in Animemorial (contains Japanese episode list, cast and staff)\n* —an in-depth article about the series, featuring rare shots of various merchandise and tie-ins related to the series (French website)\n* —an in-depth article about the series\n*\n*\n* [http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=89639 allcinema キングコング]"
