According to the 2001 UK Census 87% were born in Wales. 35% of the population claimed to be able to speak Welsh.\nCurrent Representation\nDafan is a ward to Llanelli Rural Council, electing three community councillors.\nThe Bynea Ward is a single-member ward for the purposes of Carmarthenshire County Council elections. Since 2012 it has been represented by Labour Party councillor D.M. Cundy.\nElections\nThe first election to the new unitary Carmarthenshire County Council took place in 1995. Bynea was by the Labour Party defeating a Green Party candidate who was a sitting member of Llanelli Borough Council.\nAt the 1999, Labour held the seat unopposed.\nIn 2004 the sitting Labour member chose to contest the Llwynhendy ward and Bynea was won by an Independent.\nIn 2008, Labour fared badly in the Llanelli area as a whole and Woolridge comfortably held Bynea.\nIn 2012, on a very low turnout, Labour came from third place to take a seat held by the Independent candidate, a member of the cabinet, since 2004.\nEarlier History\nCounty Council Elections\nThe long-standing ward boundaries in the Llanelli Rural area were redrawn in the 1980s to create three new wards, namely  Felinfoel, Hengoed and Llwynhendy. Each of these wards returned a member to Dyfed County Council in 1989 and 1993. For county elections, Bynea was part of the Llwynhendy ward.\nWhen the current Carmarthenshire County Council was formed in 1995, the Bynea Wards elected one member to the new authority.\nDistrict Council Elections\nAt the same time as the boundary changes for county elections, noted above, six wards were created in the Llanelli Rural area for district and community elections. Therefore, from 1987, Bynea formed an electoral ward for the purposes of elections to Llanelli Borough Council. Bynea returned one member, for the Labour Party in 1987 and for the Green Party in 1991.\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
