The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Cinemateca Uruguaya has being submitting the country's films.\nAs of 2025, Uruguay submitted twenty-five films and was nominated once for A Place in the World (1992). But soon after a controversy quickly began when stories began circulating that the film had minimal Uruguayan artistic input, being actually shot by an Argentine filmmaker in Argentina, with the plot set in Argentina, and the cast and crew primarily from Argentina. The film was also in the running (and finished in second place) to represent Argentina in the Oscar race, it represented Argentina at the Golden Globe Awards and eventually went on to win Best Picture at the Argentinian National Film Awards (the Asociación de Críticos Cinematográficos de Argentina)  Ultimately, AMPAS disqualified the film and removed it from the Oscar final ballot. Uruguay took a hiatus of almost ten years and rejoined the submission process only in 2001.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nAll films were produced in Spanish.\nTheir 2005 submission was announced but was not on the official AMPAS list, and did not screen for the Academy. Although most Foreign Film submissions in this category have historically been dramas, Uruguay chose comedies four years in a row, from 2001–2004, and again in 2009-2010.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Uruguay for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
