He is best known as a writer of epic historical novels that span long periods of history but are set in particular places. His debut novel, Sarum, set the pattern for his work with a ten-thousand-year storyline.\nBiography\nRutherfurd attended the University of Cambridge and Stanford Business School, where he earned a Sloan fellowship. After graduating he worked in political research, bookselling and publishing. He abandoned his career in the book trade in 1983 and returned to his childhood home to write Sarum, a historical novel with a ten-thousand year story, set in the area around the ancient monument of Stonehenge and Salisbury.\nSarum was published in 1987 and became an instant international best-seller, remaining for 23 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List. Since then he produced seven more New York Times best-sellers: Russka, a novel of Russia; London; The Forest, set in England's New Forest which lies close by Sarum; two novels, Dublin: Foundation (The Princes of Ireland) and Ireland: Awakening (The Rebels of Ireland), which cover the story of Ireland from the time just before Saint Patrick to the twentieth century;  New York; Paris; and China.\nHis books have sold more than fifteen million copies and been translated into twenty languages. Rutherfurd settled near Dublin, Ireland, in the early 1990s, but currently divides his time between Europe and North America.\nNew York: The Novel, won the Langum Prize for American Historical Fiction in 2009 and was awarded the Washington Irving Medal for Literary Excellence, by the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, in 2011.\nIn 2015 Edward Rutherfurd was the recipient of the City of Zaragoza's International Historical Novel Honor Award \"for his body of work in the field of the historical novel.\"\nStyle\nRutherfurd invents four to six fictional families and tells the stories of their descendants. Using this framework, he chronicles the history of a place, often from the beginning of civilisation to modern times – a kind of historical fiction inspired by the work of James Michener.\nRutherfurd's novels are generally at least 500 pages in length and sometimes more than 1,000. Divided into a number of parts, each chapter represents a different era in the place where the novel is set. There is usually an extensive family tree in the introduction, with each generational line matching the corresponding chapters.\nWorks\n*Sarum (1987) latterly titled Sarum: the Novel of England\n*Russka (1991) sometimes titled Russka: the Novel of Russia\n*London (1997)\n*The Forest (2000)\n*Dublin: Foundation (2004) titled The Princes of Ireland: The Dublin Saga in North America\n*Ireland: Awakening (2006) titled The Rebels of Ireland: The Dublin Saga in North America\n*New York (September 2009)\n*Paris (April 2013) sometimes titled Paris: A Novel\n*China (May 2021)\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* , interview, ContraCostaTimes.com 9 May 2004\n* [http://www.edwardrutherfurd.com/ Edward Rutherfurd's Official site]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Official-Edward-Rutherfurd-Page/282042051882?ref=ts/ Edward Rutherfurd's Official Facebook Page]"
