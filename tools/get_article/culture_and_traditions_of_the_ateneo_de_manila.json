This article deals solely with the university’s culture and traditions.\nName\nThe Spanish term Ateneo is derived from the Latin word Athenæum, denoting a temple to Athena, goddess of wisdom, warfare, and the tutelary of the city of Athens in Greek mythology. The closest English gloss for this term is academy.\nThe Society of Jesus in the Philippines established several other schools beginning in 1856, with nine of these named “Ateneo”. Over the years, the name became recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning in the islands.\nMotto\nThe present motto of the university is \"Lux in Domino\" (\"Light in the Lord\"), taken from :\nMarian devotions\nAteneans value symbols of devotion to María la Purísima Concepción (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception). Her traditional blue and white robes are the origin of the School colors, as alluded to in the alma mater hymn, A Song for Mary.\nMascot\nIn the 1930s, Ateneo de Manila adopted the Blue Eagle as its symbol; the precise species varies from depiction to depiction. The Philippine Eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is also the national bird of the Philippines.\nReferences"
