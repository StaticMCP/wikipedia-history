      "text": "# Battle Spirits\n\nBattle Spirits is a two-player collectible card game (CCG) jointly developed by Bandai and Sunrise, Inc. and a franchise which also includes several anime series, manga serialisations, and other merchandise like toys and video games.\nThe game was released in Japan in September 2008 where it quickly became one of the top selling trading card games of the year. Due to this popularity, it was released in the United States by Bandai of America on August 14, 2009. However, due to a lack of publicity and inaccurate translation from Japanese to English, only five sets were released.\nThe game is now only available in Asia and only printed in Japanese.\nHow to Play\nThe game is set up by placing five core on each player's life and three on each player's reserve, plus 1 soul core. Each player draws four cards from their deck. The steps in a turn are as follows:\n*Start Step: Signals the start of the first player's turn.\n*Core Step: Take one core and add it to reserve. This step is skipped in the first turn.\n*Draw Step: Draw one card from the deck.\n*Refresh Step: Refresh all cards and take back cores from the trash (if any).\n*Main Step: Summoning and levelling up spirits/braves/ultimates, using magic, placing burst cards (only one), deploying nexuses, and braving takes place during this step. No summoning, braving or moving core is allowed in other steps (except when stated by effects).\n*Attack Step: This step is usually skipped in the first turn. Attacking takes place solely on this step. The steps are as follows:\n**Decide which spirit attacks. Only a card in refreshed position can attack or block, and is exhausted as soon as an attack or block is declared.\n**Flash timing: Magic or Swift Summon can be done at this time. The defender has the right to use magic first, but the (When Attacks) effects are first priority.\n**The opponent decides whether to block or take a life. If taking a life, the second Flash timing and the BP check are skipped.\n**Flash timing: Magic or Swift Summon can be done at this time. Again, the defender can use magic first.\n**Check BP. The card with higher BP wins, and the lower BP is destroyed. If the same amount, both are destroyed.\n*End Step: Signals end of turn.\nRepeat until game ends. The game is won by reducing either the opponent's life or deck to 0. The game is won immediately when the life is at 0, but a deck must have 0 cards during the Start Step for the game to end.\nCard Terminology\n*Core: Counters that are used to play cards and serve as life. When life is decreased, the core from the life goes to the reserve.\n*Type: The type of card, whether a spirit, magic, nexus, brave, or ultimate.\n*Color: The color of card, whether red, white, green, purple, yellow, or blue.\n*Core Cost: The number of core that must be sent to the trash to play a card. Located on the top-left corner of the card.\n*Core Reduction: For every card with a corresponding symbol on the field (up to a point), the core cost of playing a card is reduced by 1. Located directly to the right of the core cost.\n*Battle Points: Abbreviated as BP, the attack/block power of a spirit, brave, or ultimate.\n*Level Cost: The number of cores needed to raise a card to a certain level.\n*Family: The classification of spirit, brave, and ultimate cards. Sometimes called attribute or characteristic. Located to the right of the card's name.\n*Symbol: The gem at the bottom-right of the card. Used to determine card colour, core reduction, and damage the card can deal to the life. Most cards range from 0 to 2 symbols.\nCard Types\n*Spirit: Spirits are summoned mainly to attack the opponent and reduce their life but are also used to protect own life. They must have at least 1 core on them to stay on the field, and are levelled up by adding more core to them.\n*Magic: Players use Magic to change the game field environment by causing a variety of different effects from providing BP boosts to drawing more cards. They can drastically change the pace of the game. Called \"Spells\" in the English release.\n*Nexus: Nexuses are location cards that change the field. Their effects are similar to magic, but are continuous.\n*Brave: A fourth type of card introduced about two years into the Japanese game's life when Battle Spirits Brave started. They are treated as \"Spirit-Form\" on field, means any Spirit-targeting effects are vulnerable to it. It can be 'Braved' onto Spirits like equipment, combining effects, attributes, symbol(if got any), and Cost. And Spirits with Brave are called \"Braved Spirits\". and in this form, Brave is Brave.\n*Ultimate: A fifth type of card which was first introduced since Battle Spirits Ultimate (2013), whose level starts at 3 and can go up to 6. These cards have high BP for their cost. Ultimate s are unaffected by effects targeting spirits(it's different card Type), and usually have the summon condition fulfilled to summon them. Another specialty to Ultimate's are the effects called \"Ultimate Trigger\", \"Ultimate Hand:X\", and \"Soul Drive\" which are introduced in Card Mechanic section.\nCard Rarity\nThe card rarity in Battle Spirits is as follows:\n* Common: Cards are commonly obtainable with effects or no effect. But usually plays the role in supporting the deck structures.\n* Uncommon: Cards with better effect. and this rarity is no longer exist after Battle Spirits Rekkaden.\n* Rare: In the US version, they are all foiled cards except for starter rares.

They also have a high affinity with nexuses, which boost their effects or distract opponent's strategies.

Blue spirits are mostly based on the superhuman, Chimeras, Golems, and Myths.\n*Yellow: Yellow cards are weak compared to other colours when looking at cost and BP, but have amazing effects that gives the player a powerful advantage when it comes to magic. Yellow is great at working with other colours to boost the power of their magic. And they have a lot of funny Battle Rule changing cards.
