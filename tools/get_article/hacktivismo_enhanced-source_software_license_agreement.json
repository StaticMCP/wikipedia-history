It is intended to be a legally enforceable document. However, due to these restrictions, it is not technically a free software license or an open source license, though it was inspired by free software and open source licenses.\nCriticism\nHESSLA has been criticized by the Free Software Foundation for introducing restrictions that they claim are ineffective for preventing abuse, but introduce legal incompatibility with other licenses. It also is listed as a good example of a human rights license in the Creative Commons wiki.\nDerivatives\nThe web browser xB Browser was temporarily based on the Torrify Ethical Software License Agreement (TESLA) which was built upon HESSLA.\nSee also\n*996 working hour system § 996.ICU GitHub campaign\n*Douglas Crockford § \"Good, not Evil\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204033625/http://www.hacktivismo.com/about/hessla.php The HESSLA]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080202223002/http://xerobank.com/tesla.html The TESLA]\n*Human Rights License Entry on Creative Commons Wiki"
