He ordered the first five-hundred-year-old Triantafyllos Tsura to occupy the houses around the village, and the second Ioannis Klimakas the center, and he with 100 horsemen surveyed the fortifications. On the morning of January 29, 1829, Mahmut Pasha appeared leading his cavalry.\nThe infantry followed. When they reached the fortifications, they rushed and advanced to the middle houses of the village. A fierce battle ensued. The enemies fought bravely, and after about two hours they retreated due to the fire of the Greeks who were firing from their forts.\nThe Greeks, seeing the enemy shaken, rushed and put them to flight, killing about 250 and wounding more. However, they stopped the pursuit, because suddenly a storm broke out and an icy wind arose. Only three of the Greeks were wounded. They captured a lot of loot, pack animals, money, and three flags.\nAll the officers excelled in the battle, and Vassos, who was seen everywhere in the battle, inspiring the fighters and charging relentlessly against the enemies, was defeated and fled on February 10, 1829 to Lamia. Omer Pasha, upon learning of Mahmud's defeat, also fled, leaving a guard in Thebes.\nReferences"
