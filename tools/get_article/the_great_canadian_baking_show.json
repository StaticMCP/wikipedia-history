It is an adaptation of the UK series The Great British Bake Off, which is aired in Canada under the title The Great British Baking Show.\nFor its first two seasons, the show was hosted by Dan Levy and Julia Chan, with French-born Canadian chef Bruno Feldeisen and Canadian-Australian pastry chef Rochelle Adonis as judges. The third season was hosted by Aurora Browne and Carolyn Taylor, comedians and actors of Baroness von Sketch Show fame,  with Feldeisen returning as a judge joined by Canadian chef Kyla Kennaley. From the fourth season onwards, it was hosted by comedians and Second City alumni Ann Pornel and Alan Shane Lewis.\nPremise\nEach season of the show features 10 amateur baking contestants selected from across Canada to participate in a competition of themed baking challenges. Adapted from The Great British Bake Off, each episode features three rounds: the Signature Bake, the Technical Challenge, and the Showstopper. After the two judges taste and critique the entries, they determine which contestant is crowned each week's \"Star Baker\" and which contestant will be sent home.\nIn each season finale, the final three bakers compete to be named the winner of The Great Canadian Baking Show and take home the GCBS cake stand.\nProduction\nProduced by Proper Television in association with the CBC and Love Productions, the show is filmed on the grounds of the Canadian Film Centre in Toronto during mid-summer, then premiered in November for season 1, and September for seasons 2 and 3, on CBC. The executive producer is Cathie James, and the series producers are Marike Emery (seasons 1 through 4) and Mark Ven de Ven (season 5).\nLevy, a self-proclaimed \"huge fan\" of the British series upon which the show is based, stated that he \"actively pursued\" the hosting role for the premiere season.\nCBC Television announced on February 7, 2018 that the series was renewed for a second season, and all hosts and judges would be returning. The series was renewed for a third season in 2019 with judge Bruno Feldeisen being joined by new judge Kyla Kennaley and new hosts Aurora Browne and Carolyn Taylor. The series was renewed for a fourth season due to air in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production was delayed and the season aired in early 2021, with new hosts Alan Shane Lewis and Ann Pornel. The fifth season aired in 2021 with the same hosts and judges.\nHosts and judges\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=font-size:90%\n! scope=col style=width:8em rowspan=2| Hosts/Judges\n! scope=col colspan=13| Season\n|-\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 1\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 2\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 3\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| Holiday\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 4\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 5\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| Holiday\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 6\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| Holiday\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 7\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| Holiday\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 8\n! scope=col style=width:3.5em| 9\n|- style=\"border-top:3px solid #aaa\"\n! colspan=14| Current\n|-\n| scope=row | Bruno Feldeisen\n| colspan=13\n|-\n| scope=row | Kyla Kennaley\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=11\n|-\n| scope=row |\n| colspan=4\n| colspan=9\n|-\n| scope=row |\n| colspan=4\n| colspan=9\n|-\n! colspan=14| Former\n|-\n| scope=row | Dan Levy\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=11\n|-\n| scope=row | Julia Chan\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=11\n|-\n| scope=row | Rochelle Adonis\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=11\n|-\n| scope=row | Aurora Browne\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=9\n|-\n| scope=row | Carolyn Taylor\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=2\n| colspan=9\n|}\nReception\nJohn Doyle, reviewing the first episode for The Globe and Mail, called the show boring and said that it lacked \"the major ingredients of eccentric flair and idiosyncratic contestants [of the original].\" Doyle's criticism of host Dan Levy's \"feyness\" in the review was called homophobic by Levy and others. Eater Montreal writer Tim Forster said the show's first episode is \"like somebody left the sugar out of the recipe: it looks right, but the flavour is kind of bland\" due to a lack of focus on the contestants' stories, which he primarily attributed to poor editing and a rushed pace due to a shorter running time than the British series. Joanna Schneller called the judging by Bruno Feldeisen and Rochelle Adonis \"consistently dull\" in a review of the second episode for the Toronto Star. She suggested that, like the judges in the original series, they should be instructing on the significance of dishes as well as judging.\nGreg David of TV, eh? called the show \"unapologetically entertaining\" and \"a calming oasis amid the noisy negativity we're besieged with,\" specifically praising the chemistry of hosts Levy and Chan. Katherine DeClerq, reviewing the final episode in ''Women's Post, said she was \"pleasantly surprised\" by the series and \"while the dry humour could be a bit dryer and the puns slightly less cheesy, I have to say I am in love with The Great Canadian Baking Show.\"\nSeason overview\n{| class=wikitable  style=text-align:center;line-height:16px\n|-\n! scope=col | Season\n! scope=col | Episodes\n! scope=col | Premiere\n! scope=col | Finale\n! style=background:silver |Runners-up\n! style=background:gold |Winner\n! scope=col |Average viewers(millions)\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 1\n| rowspan=6 | 8\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=1 | Linda Longson\n| rowspan=2 | Sabrina Degni\n| rowspan=2 |1.4\n|-\n|Vandana Jain\n|-\n! rowspan=2 scope=row | 2\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=1 | Sachin Seth\n| rowspan=2 | Andrei Godoroja\n| rowspan=2 | 1.4\n|-\n| Megan Stasiewich\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 3\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=1 | Colin Asuncion\n| rowspan=2 | Nataliia Shevchenko\n| rowspan=2 | 1.2\n|-\n|Jodi Robson\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=3 | Holiday (2019)\n| rowspan=3 | 1\n| rowspan=3 colspan=2 |\n| James Hoyland\n| rowspan=3 | Timothy Fu\n| rowspan=3 |\n|-\n|Megan Stasiewich\n|-\n|Vandana Jain\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 4\n| rowspan=2 | 8\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=1 |Tanner Davies\n| rowspan=2 |Raufikat Oyawoye\n| rowspan=2 |\n|-\n|Mahathi Mundluru\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 5\n| rowspan=2 | 8\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| Aimee DeCruyenaere\n| rowspan=2 |Vincent Chan\n| rowspan=2 |\n|-\n|Steve Levitt\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=3 | Holiday (2021)\n| rowspan=3 | 1\n| rowspan=3 colspan=2 |\n| Jodi Robson\n| rowspan=3 | Sachin Seth\n| rowspan=3 |\n|-\n|Linda Longson\n|-\n|Colin Asuncion\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 6\n| rowspan=2 | 8\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| Chi Nguyễn\n| rowspan=2 | Lauren Tjoe\n| rowspan=2 |\n|-\n| Zoya Thawer\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=3 | Holiday (2022)\n| rowspan=3 | 1\n| rowspan=3 colspan=2 |\n| Mengling Chen\n| rowspan=3 | Mahathi Mundluru\n| rowspan=3 |\n|-\n| Stephen Nhan\n|-\n| Steve Levitt\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 7\n| rowspan=2 | 8\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| Camila García Hernández\n| rowspan=2 | Loïc Fauteux-Goulet\n| rowspan=2 |\n|-\n| Candice Riley\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=3 | Holiday (2023)\n| rowspan=3 | 1\n| rowspan=3 colspan=2 |\n| Nataliia Shevchenko\n| rowspan=3 | Andrei Godoroja\n| rowspan=3 |\n|-\n| Raufikat Oyawoye\n|-\n| Vincent Chan\n|-\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 8\n| rowspan=2 | 8\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 |\n| Jen Childs\n| rowspan=2 | Elora Khanom\n| rowspan=2 |\n|-\n| Pamela Kramer\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 | 9\n| rowspan=2 | 9\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 | TBA\n| TBA\n| rowspan=2 | TBA\n| rowspan=2 |\n|-\n| TBA\n|-\n|}\nSeason 1 (2017)\nThe inaugural season featured 10 bakers from across Canada competing over eight weeks.
