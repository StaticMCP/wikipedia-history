She was queen consort of Joseon from 1494 until her husband's deposition in 1506, after which she was known as Deposed Queen Shin (). She did not receive a further royal title posthumously.\nBiography\nEarly life\nLady Shin was born into the Geochang Shin clan on 15 December 1476 to Shin Seung-seon and Princess Jungmo. Her mother was the daughter of King Sejong's fourth son, Grand Prince Imyeong. The grand prince was the younger brother of Prince Gwangpyeong, who served as Yeonguijeong during the reign of King Sejo. These two are uncles of Lady Sin. Accordingly Lady Shin was 7th cousins (first cousin twice removed) to her future husband.\nAs Lady Shin and her siblings came from a prestigious family, they had overlapping lineages and marriages with the royal family. She was the aunt of Queen Dangyeong, the first wife of King Jungjong, and was also the aunt of Nam Chi-won, husband of Princess Gyeongsun, the 5th daughter of King Seongjong.\nHer older brother, Shin Su-geun, also married a first cousin of Queen Insu, as well as her third older brother, Shin Su-yeong, who married Queen Ansun's younger sister.\nMarriage\nIn March 1487 (18th year of King Seongjong) it was arranged that Lady Shin would marry the Crown Prince. On 26 January 1488 (19th year of King Seongjong) the marriage ceremony was held at Injeong Hall in the palace Changdeokgung. Lady Shin became the Crown Princess of Joseon.\nLady Shin was granted the titles of Princess Consort Yeonsan () and Princess Consort Geochang ().\nLife as princess consort\nAccording to the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, Shin was peaceful, respectful, gentle, virtuous and discreet.\nIn 1491 (22nd year of King Seongjong) Princess Hwisin was born. In 1493 (24th year of King Seongjong) the princess consort participated in Chinjamrye that was hosted by Queen Jeonghyeon.\nIn 1494 (25th year of King Seongjong) the princess consort gave birth to a son who died a month later. In December of the same year, King Seongjong passed away and Prince Yeonsangun took the throne. The princess consort became the queen consort.\nLife as queen consort\nIn 1497 (3rd year of Yeonsangun's reign) under the supervision of the queen consort, approximately 160 citizens were invited to perform at the Seonjeon Hall in Changdeok Palace. In December of the same year, the queen consort gave birth to Crown Prince Hwang. In 1498, 1500, and 1503, Queen Shin gave special care to the elderly by offering to pay for their funerals.\nIn 1499, the Queen's 13-year-old niece, Lady Shin, married Grand Prince Jinseong, who was the son of King Seongjong and Queen Jeonghyeon. This niece in time became princess consort (later Queen Dangyeong).\nIn 1502 (8th year of Yeonsangun's reign) the Queen's father, Shin Seung-seon, died and the queen consort was close giving birth. King Yeonsangun prevented his wife from attending her father's funeral as he wanted her birth to auspicious.\nIn 1504 (10th year of Yeonsangun's reign) King Yeonsangun ordered a purge following the death of his mother, Queen Jeheon. He executed the ministers and members of the royal family that were involved in her death. It was said that the King went to the quarters of his step-mother Queen Dowager Jasun and held her at sword point. He thereupon ordered the Queen Dowager to come out of her living quarters, but the queen consort intervened to protect her mother-in-law from her step-son.\nA few days after this, the king organized another Chinjamrye (친잠례), a ceremony where the Queen would show herself raising silk worms and collecting cocoons to promote sericulture. Geochang, the hometown of the queen, was promoted to a county during the reign of King Yeonsangun but was later relegated to Geochang-hyeon.\nIn 1505, Queen Shin was honoured with the title Queen Jeinwondeok.\nLater life\nWhen the Jungjong coup happened in 1506, King Yeonsan was demoted to a prince and sent into exile on Ganghwa Island. This led Queen Shin to lose her status as queen consort and she became known simply as a princess consort. Her sons were sentenced to death by poisoning immediately following the coup. The new king, Jungjong, was reluctant to enforce such punishment from court officials.\nAfter she was deposed, Jungjong treated Queen Shin generously. Her servants did not leave her because of her good character.\nBefore dying that same year, the former king stated \"I miss my wife, Lady Shin\" (아내 신씨가 보고 싶다) on his deathbed.\nIn the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, it is said that Yeonsan cared for Lady Shin, or that he took care of her and her relatives. There are records that there were many children of the two of them. On the day of his sudden death, Lady Shin was the only person who was able to stop Yeonsangun from running amok, and Yeonsangun turned around without harming her.\nIn 1512 (7th year of King Jungjong's reign) Queen Shin suggested that the tomb of her husband, Yeonsangun, be moved to Haechon, Yangju. This was permitted by King Jungjong.\nIn 1521, when the house of her family collapsed, due to heavy rain, King Jungjong gifted her the house of Ahn Cheo-gyeom ().\nThe deposed Queen Shin outlived her husband by 31 years and died at the age of 60 on 16 May 1537. She is interred beside Yeonsan's. Her tombstone states her name as Princess Consort Geochang of the Geochang Shin clan ().\nGu Eom (son of Queen Shin's only daughter Princess Hwisin) held the ancestral rites for Queen Shin and King Yeonsangun. After Gu died, his adoptive grandson, Yi Ahn-nul (), inherited the position.\nFamily\nParents\n* Father: Shin Seung-seon (; 1436 –1502)\n* Mother: Princess Jungmo, Internal Princess Consort Heungan of the Jeonju Yi clan (; 1435–?)\nSibling(s)\n* Older brother: Shin Su-geun (; 1450–1506)\n* Older brother: Shin Su-gyeom (; 1454–1503)\n* Older brother: Shin Su-yeong (; 1457 – 2 September 1506)\n* Older sister: Lady Shin of the Geochang Shin clan (; 1466–?)\n* Older sister: Lady Shin of the Geochang Shin clan (; 1467–?)\n* Older sister: Lady Shin of the Geochang Shin clan (; 1468–?)\nConsort\n* Yi Yung, King Yeonsan (; 23 November 1476 – 20 November 1506)\nIssue\n* Daughter: Yi Su-eok, Princess Hwisin (; 24 October 1491–?)\n* Unnamed daughter\n* Unnamed son (1494–1494)\n* Daughter: Princess Yi Bok-eok (; 1499–?)\n* Son: Deposed Crown Prince Yi Hwang (; 10 January 1498 – 24 September 1506)\n* Unnamed son (1500–?)\n* Son: Yi Seong, Grand Prince Changnyeong (; 18 June 1500 – 10 October 1506)\n* Son: Grand Prince Yi In-su (; 1501 – 12 September 1503)\n* Son: Grand Prince Yi Chong-su (; 1502–1503)\n* Son: Grand Prince Yi Yeong-su (; 1503–1503)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Gwon Jae-hee in the 1988 film Diary of King Yeonsan.\n* Portrayed by Park Ha-sun in the 2007–2008 SBS TV series The King and I.\n*Portrayed by Hong Soo-hee in the 2011–2012 JTBC TV series Insu, the Queen Mother.\n*Portrayed by Song Ji-in in the 2017 KBS2 TV series Queen for Seven Days.\nReferences\n}}\n}}"
