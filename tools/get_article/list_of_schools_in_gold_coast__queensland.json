Prior to the 1970s, most schools were founded by religious institutes, but with the decrease in membership of these institutes, together with major reforms inside the church, lay teachers and administrators began to take over the schools, a process which completed by approximately 1990. Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE), headquartered in Dutton Park, was established in 1993 and is responsible for coordinating administration, curriculum and policy across the Catholic school system. Preference for enrolment is given to Catholic students from the parish or local area, although non-Catholic students are admitted if room is available.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n!
