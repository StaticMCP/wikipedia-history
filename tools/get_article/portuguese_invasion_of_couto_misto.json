These houses were involved in numerous disputes between the inhabitants of Couto Misto, Portugal, and Galicia, especially around the year 1518, when tensions rose due to the belief that Couto Misto was a refuge for criminals and a hub for smuggling activities.\nInvasion and Burning of Pena\nIn 1517, a series of violent actions took place in the region, and the village of Pena, situated between Santiago de Rubiás and Vilar, was burned by a Portuguese raiding force. This group, led by commanders from nearby castles such as the Picoña Castle, attacked the village during the night, setting fire to homes and killing all the men. The women and children who survived fled to neighboring villages like Santiago and Rubiás.\nThe destruction of Pena was part of frequent border disputes between Portugal and Galicia. The Portuguese forces were led by Antonio de Araújo from Picoña Castle and Lançarote Gonçalves from Montalegre Castle. On the Galician side, Pedro Sival, a meiriño (local official) from the House of Monterrei.\nAftermath\nIn 1518, the inhabitants of Couto Misto sought support from the Count of Monterrei, hoping to resist Portuguese invasions. However, the dynamics of the region began to change, as negotiations slowly brought the Couto Misto's sovereignty into question. The final act of subjugation came in 1868, when the Treaty of Lisbon was signed, dividing the land between Portugal and Spain.\nReferences"
