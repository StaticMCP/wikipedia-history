The leader of the movement was Prince Kakutsa Cholokashvili, colonel of the Georgian army, formerly a Polkovnik in the Imperial Russian Army and hero of the Battle of Sarikamish during World War I. Since the spring of 1921 Cholokashvili organized strong militia in Kakheti and Khevsureti from experienced Georgian army personnel and noblemen including M. Lashkarashvili, Simon Bagration-Mukhraneli, L. Lekvinadze, S. Andronikashvili, A. Sumbatashvili, Sh. Vachnadze, P. Palavandishvili, Sh. Palavandishvili, etc.\nThe militia had a close contact to Catholicos-Patriarch Ambrose and enjoyed the support of the mountainous clans of eastern Georgia.\nFirst, the militiamen blocked all the roads to Tusheti, Pshavi, and Khevsureti and after winning the battle in Zhinvali, the army moved in Khevsureti. Notably, the Bolsheviks used vast inexperienced military resources, including combat aviation, against the militiamen and had heavy casualties whereas the casualties of Cholokashvili's force was zero in some cases\nThe rebellion was weakened from disagreement within different political parties of Georgia. For example, Social Democrats thought that Cholokashvili, a nobleman, should not be the leader of a Partisan army. On the other hand, the Bolsheviks arrested and executed supporters of militia in Kartli and Kakheti and moved more army divisions from Grozny.\nCombination of hostility of Cheka towards the population of Georgia and disagreement between different political parties forced Cholokashvili to escape to the neighboring Chechnya, whence he made several inroads into Georgia, preventing the Bolsheviks from gaining a foothold in the eastern Georgian mountains before joining the major revolt against the Soviets in August 1924.\nSee also\n*August Uprising\n*Svaneti uprising of 1921\nNotes\nReferences\n*Jones, Stephen F.
