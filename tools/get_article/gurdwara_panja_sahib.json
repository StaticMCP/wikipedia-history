The shrine is considered to be particularly important as the handprint of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, is believed to be imprinted on a boulder at the gurdwara.\nHistory\nHandprint on the boulder which is believed by Sikhs to be that of Guru Nanak.\nThe famous Chinese traveler Xuanzang who visited the place in the 7th century A.D. mentions the sacred spring of Elapatra about 70 li to the northwest of Taxila which has been identified as the spring at Gurdwara Panja Sahib. Guru Nanak along with Bhai Mardana reached Hasan Abdal in Baisakh Samwat 1578 B.K., corresponding to the summer of 1521 CE, when according to Sikh legend, Guru Nanak's handprint was imprinted onto a boulder. The Gurdwara was named Panja Sahib by Hari Singh Nalwa, the most famous general of the Sikh Empire. He is credited with having built the first gurdwara at the site.\nLegend\nUnder a shady cool tree, Guru Nanak and Bhai Mardana started reciting Kirtan and their devotees gathered around. This annoyed a local saint, Shah Wali Qandhari.\nAccording to Sikh legend, Bhai Mardana was sent three times to Shah Wali Qandhari by Guru Nanak so that he would provide him with some water to quench his thirst. Wali Qandhari refused his request and was rude to him. In spite of this, Mardana still very politely stuck to his demand. The Wali remarked : \"Why don't you ask your Master whom you serve?\"\nMardana went back to the Guru in a miserable state and said \"Oh lord! I prefer death to thirst but will not approach Wali the egoist.\"\nThe Guru replied \"Oh Bhai Mardana ji! Repeat the Name of God, the Almighty; and drink the water to your heart's content.\"\nThe Guru put aside a big rock lying nearby and a pure fountain of water sprang up and began to flow endlessly. Bhai Mardana quenched his thirst and felt grateful to the Guru.\nOn the other hand, the fountain of Shah Wali Qandhari dried up. On witnessing this, the Wali in his rage threw a part of a mountain towards the Guru from the top of the hill. The Guru stopped the hurled rock. Clear, fresh spring water gushes out from somewhere behind the rock and spills over into a very large pool. An imprint of a right hand was carved on the rock while it was built in the Mughal style by Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780-1839).\nGallery\nFile:Guru Nanak stops the boulder from falling with his hand.jpg|Guru Nanak stops the boulder from falling with his hand, 19th century artwork.\nFile:Photograph of ruins at Hasan Abdal, Punjab, ca.1880.jpg|Photograph of ruins at Hasan Abdal, Punjab, with Gurdwara Panja Sahib in background, ca.1880\nFile:Shrine of Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hasan Abdal, Attock, Punjab, constructed by Hari Singh Nalwa, photographed ca.1913.jpg|Shrine of Gurdwara Panja Sahib constructed by Hari Singh Nalwa, photographed ca.1913\nFile:Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Hasan Abdal in April 1932.webp|Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Hasan Abdal in April 1932.\nFile:Sarovar of Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Hasan Abdal in April 1932.jpg|Sarovar of Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Hasan Abdal in April 1932.\nFile:Gudwara Panja Sahib - Flickr - Al Jazeera English (1).jpg\nFile:PanjaSahibExterior1.JPG\nFile:PanjaSahib IMG 0150.JPG\nFile:Panja Sahib.jpg\nFile:Old Hindu temple on the rear side of Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Pakistan.jpg|The rear side of the gurdwara features an old Hindu temple.\nFile:PanjaSahibEntrance.JPG|Entrance to Panja Sahib Gurdwara in Hasan Abda\nFile:PanjaSahibFish.JPG|Fish in spring underneath hand print at Panja Sahib Gurdwara in Hasan Abdal\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.attockonians.com Hasan Abdal]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184228/http://sripanjasahib.ning.com/ Join Panja Sahib Network @ Ning]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060426190308/http://allaboutsikhs.com/gurudwaras/gop-012.htm Gurudwara Panja Sahib ]"
