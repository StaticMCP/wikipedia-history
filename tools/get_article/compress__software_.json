Its use has been replaced by commands such as gzip and bzip2 that use other algorithms and provide better data compression. Compared to gzip at its fastest setting,  is slightly slower at compression, slightly faster at decompression, and has a significantly lower compression ratio. 1.8 MiB of memory is used to compress the Hutter Prize data, slightly more than  at its slowest setting.\nand  have maintained a presence on Unix and BSD systems and have been ported to IBM i.\nwas standardized in X/Open CAE Specification in 1994, and further in The Open Group Base Specifications, Issue 6 and 7.

Terry Welch published an IEEE article on the algorithm in 1984, but failed to note that he had applied for a patent on the algorithm. Spencer Thomas of the University of Utah took this article and implemented  in 1984, without realizing that a patent was pending on the LZW algorithm. The GIF image format also incorporated LZW compression in this way, and Unisys later claimed royalties on implementations of GIF. Joseph M. Orost led the team and worked with Thomas et al. to create the final (4.0) version of  and published it as free software to the net.sources USENET group in 1985.  was granted in 1985  making  unusable without paying royalties to Sperry Research (which later merged into Unisys).\nThe US LZW patent expired in 2003, so it is now in the public domain in the United States. Today, all LZW patents worldwide are expired (see Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement).\nAs of POSIX.1-2024  supports the DEFLATE algorithm used in gzip.\nFile format\nThe compressed output consists of bit groups. Each bit group consists of codes with fixed amount of bits (9&ndash;16). Each group, except the last group, is aligned to the number of bits per code multiplied by 8 and right padded with zeroes. The last group is aligned to 8 bit octets and padded with zeroes. More information can be found at an issue on the ncompress GitHub repository.\nExample:\n: Suppose the output has ten 9-bit codes, five 10-bit codes, and thirteen 11-bit codes. There are three groups to output containing 90 bits, 50 bits, and 143 bits of data.\n:* First group will be 90 bits of data + 54 zero bits of padding in order to be aligned to 72 bits (9 bits × 8).\n:* Second group will be 50 bits of data + 30 zero bits of padding in order to be aligned to 80 bits (10 bits × 8).\n:* Third group will be 143 bits of data + 1 zero bit of padding in order to be aligned to 8 bits (since this is the last group in the output).\nThe existence of padding bits is actually a bug, as LZW does not require any alignment. This bug existed for more than 35 years and was in the original UNIX compress, ncompress, gzip and the Windows port. All application/x-compress files were created using this bug.\nSome  implementations write random bits from uninitialized buffer in paddings. There is no guarantee that the paddings will be zeroes. The decompressor must ignore the values in the paddings for compatibility.\nSee also\n* Image compression\n* List of POSIX commands\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://ncompress.sourceforge.net/ ncompress] - public domain compress/uncompress implementation for POSIX systems\n* [http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/utils/compress/compress.tar.Z compress] - original Unix compress (in a compress'd archive)\n* [http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/utils/compress/compress.z compress] - original Unix compress executable (gzip'd)\n* [http://ftp.sunet.se/mirror/archive/ftp.sunet.se/pub/usenet/ftp.uu.net/comp.sources.unix/volume2/compress4.0/ Source Code for compress v4.0] (gzip'd sharchives)\n* [http://www.willus.com/archive/unixcmds.zip ZIP File containing a Windows port of the compress utility]\n* [https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/usr.bin/compress/ source code to the current version of fcompress.c from compress]\n* [https://github.com/vapier/ncompress/issues/5 bit groups alignment] - Explanation of bit groups alignment.\n* [https://github.com/andrew-aladev/lzws lzws] - New library and CLI, implemented without legacy code.\n* [https://github.com/andrew-aladev/ruby-lzws ruby-lzws] - Ruby bindings with streaming support."
