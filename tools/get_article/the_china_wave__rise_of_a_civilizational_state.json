      "text": "# The China Wave: Rise of a Civilizational State\n\nThe China Wave: Rise of a Civilizational State is a 2011 book by Zhang Weiwei about China's economic and geopolitical rise to the status as an emerging global power. It was originally published in Chinese with the English language version being published in 2012. In the book Zhang argues that China's rapid economic development proves the success of China's model of governance and exceptionalism. Zhang argues that China is unique and exceptional because it is a civilization state. Zhang outlines the concept in the book and argues that it challenges Western assumptions about human rights, good governance, and democracy.\nSee also\n* China's peaceful rise\n* Chinese Century\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Coker, Christopher.
