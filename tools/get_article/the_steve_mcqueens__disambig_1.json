Marcus Szeto then joined playing the guitar and Bobby Singh as percussionist. They did their first gig on 23 April 2013 at the Sultan Jazz Club. Jase (bassist) replaced Ben and Aaron (drummer) replaced Bobby, while Fabian Lim (saxophonist) joined the group.\nThe group played regular gigs at the BluJaz Café, Marina Bay Sands, and other venues. They were featured on Late Night at Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay in January 2014 for their launch of Einstein Moments, their first album, and in March 2014 at The Singapore Jazz Festival. They were spotted there by veteran jazz funk producer, Jean-Paul 'Bluey' Maunick, founder and leader of the British acid jazz band Incognito.  Bluey invited them to his Livingston Studio to record their second album, Seamonster. This was the first release for Bluey's record label alongside David Ranalli, Julian Fontenell and Ravi Chidambaram, Splash Blue.\nThe album was released in Asia by the Singapore-based label Foundation Music.\nInternational performances\n;Jakarta\n*Java Jazz 2014\n*Java Jazz 2015\n*Java Jazz 2020\n;Japan\n*Tokyo SUMMERSONIC 2015\n*Tokyo Peter Barakan Live Magic!\n*Tokyo International Jazz Festival 2018\n;Singapore\n*Singapore International Jazz Festival 2014 and 2015\n;Korea\n*Jarasum International Jazz Festival and Zandari Festa 2016\n;Australia\n*Brisbane Arts Fest and Adelaide OzAsia Festival\n*Melbourne Jazz Festival\nOther performances\n*Opening for Incognito, O2 Indigo, London, 23 May 2015\n*2015 Southeast Asian Games closing ceremony, National Stadium, Singapore, 16 June 2015\nDiscography\n* Einstein Moments (2013)\n* Sea Monster (2015)\n* Terrarium (2017)\n* Tape Ends (2020)\n* The Observer (2022)\nReferences"
