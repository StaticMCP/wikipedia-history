It is  long and is formed by the confluence of the Große Bode and Kleine Bode rivers.\nName\nThe names of the Warme and Kalte Bode ('Warm' and 'Cold' Bode) come from their actual temperature difference of about 2&nbsp;°C.\nHeadstreams\nGroße Bode\nThe Große Bode ('Great Bode') is the left-hand headstream of the Warme Bode and is about  long. Its source is at the foot of the highest mountain in the Harz, the Brocken, in the southern part of the so-called Brockenfeld on the border of Saxony-Anhalt. Immediately nearby are the sources of the Kalte Bode, the Ecker and the Oder. The Große Bode flows mainly southwards, on the western slopes of the Wurmberg towards  Braunlage. Its course is characterised by little waterfalls and steps (Fallstufen) including the Oberer Bodefall. In front of Braunlage it joins the Kleine Bode ('Little Bode') to form the Warme Bode.\nKleine Bode\nThe Kleine Bode is the right-hand headstream of the Warme Bode and is about  long. It rises at the foot of the Achtermannshöhe.\nCourse\nAfter the confluence of its headstreams, the Warme Bode flows over the waterfall of the Unterer Bodefall towards Braunlage. There it is joined by the Ulrichswasser. It continues in the direction of Sorge. From the state border with Saxony-Anhalt it runs parallel to the B 242 federal road to Tanne.\nNext the Warme Bode runs through a delightful valley and is united with the Kalte Bode near Königshütte, below the ruins of Königsburg to form the Bode.\nTributaries\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| width = \"200\" |Left tributaries\n| width = \"200\" |Right tributaries\n|-\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n|-\n|\n* Große Bode (Braunlage)\n* Bremke\n* Amkenbach\n* Schieferbach\n* Spielbach\n|\n* Kleine Bode (Braunlage)\n* Ulrichswasser (Braunlage)\n* Großer Goldbach\n* Kleiner Goldbach\n* Brunnenbach\n* Ochsenbach (Sorge)\n* Großer Allerbach (Tanne)\n|-\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | In brackets the location where the tributary joins the Warme Bode.\n|}\nSee also\n* List of rivers of Lower Saxony\n* List of rivers of Saxony-Anhalt\nExternal links\n* [http://www.harzlife.de/info/warme-bode.html The Warme Bode in the Harz]\n* [http://www.izbuschka.de/harz/wandern/bodetal/main.shtml The Bode Gorge]"
