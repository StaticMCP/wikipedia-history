They included a mathematical system operated by Frank G. Dickinson.\nChampions (by ranking)\nAll major rankings (both contemporary and retroactive) have identified the University of Southern California as the season's champions, with exception of Parke H. Davis's retroactive ranking for ''Spalding's Official Foot Ball Guide, which identified Pittsburgh and Purdue as co-champions.\n*Berryman QPRS: University of Southern California\n*Billingsley Report: University of Southern California\n*Boand System: University of Southern California\n*College Football Researchers Association: University of Southern California\n*Parke H.

All other methods were given retroactively''\nDickinson System\nThe Dickinson System was a mathematical rating system devised by University of Illinois economics professor Frank G. Dickinson.  It ranked colleges based upon their records and the strength of their opposition. The system was originally designed to rank teams in the Big Nine (later the Big Ten) conference.  Chicago clothing manufacturer Jack Rissman then persuaded Dickinson to rank the nation's teams under the system, and awarded the Rissman Trophy to the winning university. It awarded 30 points for a win over a \"strong team\", and 20 for a win over a \"weak team\".  Losses were awarded points (15 for loss to a strong team, 10 for loss to a weak team).  Ties were treated as half a win and half a loss (22.5 for a tie with a strong team, 15 for a tie with a weak team).  An average was then derived by dividing the points by games played.\nIn 1931, although 11–0 Tulane was unbeaten and untied they were second to 9–1 USC in the final Dickinson System mathematical ratings.\nThe teams were set to face off in the 1932 Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. The Trojans requested that presentation of the Knute Rockne Memorial Trophy be delayed until after the game. During the delay, it was decided that the Dickinson System trophy would go to the winner of the Rose Bowl game. USC ultimately won the game.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Rank\n! Team\n! Record\n!
