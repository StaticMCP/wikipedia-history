Razzies co-founder John J. B. Wilson has stated that the intent of the awards is \"to be funny.\" Nominations were revealed on January 15, 2014, and the winners were announced on March 1, 2014. The pre-nomination ballot was revealed on December 26, 2013.\nThis marks the final time a minor has been awarded a Razzie before, in 2023, the Golden Raspberry Foundation immediately regretted the decision nominating Ryan Kiera Armstrong as Worst Actress, following backlash from voters, resulting in them winning their own award.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Director co-winner]]\n, Worst Director co-winner]]\n, Worst Director co-winner]]\n, Worst Director and Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Worst Director and Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Worst Director co-winner]]\n, Worst Actor winner and Worst Screen Combo co-winner]]\n, Worst Actress winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner and Worst Screen Combo co-winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n}}\n* 'Movie 43 (Relativity Media)'\n** After Earth (Columbia)\n** Grown Ups 2 (Columbia)\n** The Lone Ranger (Disney)\n** A Madea Christmas (Lionsgate)\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n}}\n* 'Elizabeth Banks, Steven Brill, Steve Carr, Rusty Cundieff, James Duffy, Griffin Dunne, Peter Farrelly, Patrik Forsberg, Will Graham, James Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Brett Ratner, & Jonathan van Tulleken for Movie 43'\n** Dennis Dugan for Grown Ups 2\n** Tyler Perry for A Madea Christmas and Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor\n** M.
