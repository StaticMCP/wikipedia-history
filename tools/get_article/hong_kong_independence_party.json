It was registered in the United Kingdom as a political party from 27 February 2015 to 11 February 2018, and is based in London. The party's slogan is \"Independence for Hong Kong, rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations\" ().\nIn April 2024, Joseph John, HKIP president and socia media accounts manager, was sentenced to five years in jail for conspiring to incite others to commit secession, a crime under the Hong Kong national security law. He had been arrested in November 2022 upon arriving in Hong Kong from the United Kingdom for a family visit. As a holder of a Portuguese passport and a Hong Kong identity card, he was the first dual national convicted and jailed under the security law.\nSee also\n* Hong Kong National Party\nNotes\nReferences"
