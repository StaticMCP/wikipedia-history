The sitting was done in Fenway Court, then the home of Boston philanthropist and American art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner, whose immense collection would become the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum that same year.\nDescription\nGretchen Warren is seen seated in an Italian early baroque style chair with her daughter Rachel Warren. Sargent attempted to emulate aristocratic poses while using a modern and confident approach to the brush strokes.\nSee also\n* List of works by John Singer Sargent\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n;Notes\n}}"
