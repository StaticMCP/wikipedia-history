Many Pintupi people still remember this experience. For many, Thomson was the first white man they had ever seen.\nIn this research he concentrated on Aboriginal hunting and gathering practices. He provided a collection of Pintupi material including photographs, notes and films, which now form part of invaluable museum collections.\nJust before he left the people, they gave him an invaluable lesson on desert water, including an important \"map\" to assist its location. White people had long been puzzled as to how Aboriginal people could possibly find water in this harsh environment. Many desert explorers had captured Aboriginal people and used force and brutality to gain this vital knowledge – see for example, the history of the Canning Stock Route. Thomson writes:\nAs well as writing in scholarly, anthropological journals, Thomson often filed articles back to many mainstream publications, such as ''The Australian Women's Weekly'', about his findings in the Outback with the world's oldest surviving culture. He was often criticised for this for being low-brow. However, he defended his actions, realising the appeal and fascination of the ordinary Australian with the first Australians and their apparently simple, yet necessarily sophisticated, survival skills.\nThomson said of the Bindibu:\np.&nbsp;4|author=Donald Thomson}}\nSee also\n* Pintupi\n* Pintupi language\n* Pintupi Nine\n* Donald Thomson\nReferences\n* Thomson, Donald F, \"The Bindibu Expedition: exploration among the desert Aborigines of Western Australia\", The Geographical Journal, vol. 128, part 1 (March 1962), pp.&nbsp;1–14, [143]–157, 262-278.
