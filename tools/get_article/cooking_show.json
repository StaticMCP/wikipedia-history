Typically the show's host, often a celebrity chef, prepares one or more dishes over the course of an episode, taking the viewing audience through the food's inspiration, preparation, and stages of cooking.\nCooking shows have been a popular staple of daytime TV programming since the earliest days of television. They are generally very inexpensive to produce, making them an economically easy way for a TV station to fill a half-hour (or sometimes 60-minute) time slot. A number of cooking shows have run for many seasons, especially when they are sponsored by local TV stations or by public broadcasting.  Many of the more popular cooking shows have had flamboyant hosts whose unique personalities have made them into celebrities.\nProduction\n(\"The Kitchen Battle\") in 2008]]\nDue to time and production constraints, most, if not all, cooking shows employ filming shortcuts such as video editing, food modeling and photography, and prepared ingredients to speed up the cooking process and ensure a smooth and seamless production.\nGenres\nSome cooking shows, such as Emeril Live, are oriented towards instructional material, and others, such as Trisha's Southern Kitchen, additionally focus on showcasing the personal lives of the hosts. Some, such as the Rachael Ray Show, blend the genre with a talk show format. There are also reality competitions within the genre such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and Top Chef, in which contestants are given specific requirements and a time limit to prepare meals, which are then evaluated by a panel of judges, which can include celebrity chefs and other notable personalities. Travel cooking shows such as Gordon Ramsay: Uncharted and Salt Fat Acid Heat explore the culinary experiences of host chefs in various destinations. Chopped and Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives are examples of reality cooking shows, and Chefs A' Field and Chef's Table represent some of the documentary cooking shows.\nHistory\nUntil the 1940s, most cooking shows were performed on the radio.
