E. H. Love, was a mathematician famous for his work on the mathematical theory of elasticity. He also worked on wave propagation and his work on the structure of the Earth in Some Problems of Geodynamics won for him the Adams prize in 1911 when he developed a mathematical model of surface waves known as Love waves.\nLove also contributed to the theory of tidal locking and introduced the parameters known as Love numbers, used in problems related to Earth tides, the tidal deformation of the solid Earth due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun.\nLife and career\nHe was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and in 1881 won a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was at first undecided whether to study classics or mathematics. In the Mathematical Tripos of 1885 he placed as Second Wrangler, vindicating his choice of mathematics. The next year he was elected Fellow of the college. In 1899 he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Oxford, a position which he retained until his death in 1940. He was also a Fellow of Queen's College.\nHe authored the two volume classic, A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity.\nHe was the author of several articles in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, including Elasticity and Infinitesimal Calculus.\nHis other awards include the Royal Society Royal Medal in 1909 and Sylvester Medal in 1937, and the De Morgan Medal of the London Mathematical Society in 1926. He was secretary to the London Mathematical Society between 1895 and 1910, and president for 1912–1913.\nWorks\n* 1897: [https://archive.org/details/theoreticalmecha0000aehl Theoretical Mechanics, an introductory treatise on the principles of theoretical dynamics], Cambridge University Press\n* 1906: [https://archive.org/details/treatiseonmathem0000aehl_b8w2/page/n7/mode/2up A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity, second edition]\n* 1911: [https://archive.org/details/someproblemsofge00love/page/n5/mode/2up Some Problems of Geodynamics] Cambridge University Press, 1967 republished by Dover Books\n* 1944: [https://archive.org/details/treatiseonmathem0000love/page/n5/mode/2up A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity, fourth edition]\nSee also\n*Twist (differential geometry)\nReferences"
