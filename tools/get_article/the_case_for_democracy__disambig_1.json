Sharansky's friend Ron Dermer is the book's co-author. The book achieved the bestsellers lists of the New York Times, Washington Post and Foreign Affairs.\nIn the book, Sharansky and Dermer argue that the primary goal of American foreign policy, as well as that of the free world, should be the expansion of democracy. The book advocates a moral foreign policy based on belief in the universality of freedom and human rights. Sharansky and Dermer argue that nations that respect their citizens will also respect their neighbors. The book is sub-titled, The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror. The authors express passionate and controversial arguments against any compromise on the road to freedom.\nIt has been read and famously endorsed  by former United States president George W. Bush. Other members of his administration, including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, have also read the book.\nSee also\n*Defending Identity\n*Town square test\nSources\n*Natan Sharansky, Ron Dermer, The Case for Democracy.
