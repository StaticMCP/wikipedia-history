      "text": "# Kingsbury Aviation\n\nKingsbury Aviation was an English aircraft manufacturer and engineering business based at Kingsbury Aerodrome, Kingsbury, London from 1916.\nFrom 1915 the engineering company Barningham Limited used a building near Kingsbury House to manufacture equipment in support of the war effort.  In 1916 it purchased the 109-acre Kingsury House estate and with planning permission for two hangars it created Kingsbury Aerodrome and formed a new company Kingsbury Aviation.\nKingsbury Aviation had a contract to build 150 Airco DH.6 training biplanes for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and by mid-1918 it employed 800 people on the site. The company had a contract to build 20 Vickers Vimy biplane bombers but with the end of the First World War the government contracts were cancelled. The company designed and built a motor scooter and a light car but they were not a success and they went into liquidation in 1921. After a few years of being empty the aerodrome and hangars were purchased by Vanden Plas to build motor car bodies.\nReferences\n*"
