Designs were humped bull facing left, wheel peacock, trident and various other designs. The Nagas of Narwar occupied the region of Padmavati, Kantipuri, Mathura and Vidisha around the period of 200-340 AD. In this period there was substantial trade between India and Rome in spices, fabric and gold. Text used was in the Brahmi script  of an early Prakrit language.\nReferences"
