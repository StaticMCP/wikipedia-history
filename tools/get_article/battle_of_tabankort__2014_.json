Clashes were paused after MINUSMA intervened.\nBackground\nOn May 21, 2014, rebels from the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, the High Council for the Unity of Azawad, and the dissident faction of the Arab Movement of Azawad defeated Malian and pro-Malian forces in Kidal, effectively capturing the city. The rebels also took control of Anefif, which was abandoned by Mali. On May 24, clashes broke out in the nearby town of Tabankort, killing at least seven people, but the circumstances surrounding the clashes are unknown. The MNLA accused MOJWA of ambushing MNLA fighters, although French media reported the clashes were between pro-government and pro-rebel factions of the MAA. A few days later, new clashes broke out in Tabankort between the MNLA and pro-government MAA.\nOn July 11, clashes broke out in Anefis, with the MNLA, HCUA, and dissident MAA fighting against the loyalist MAA, GATIA, and CM-FPR. The pro-government side was led by El Hadj Ag Gamou, an Imghad Tuareg, and Yoro Ould Daha, a Lemhar Arab. Gamou commanded around 200 troops. Rebel fighters were led by Hassan Ag Fagaga. Rebel forces remained in control of the town.\nBattle\nClashes broke out again in Tabankort, particularly near Anefis and Bourem on July 19. The three main towns seeing fighting were Tabankort, Akaskaza, and Tabrichat. On July 21, MNLA fighters shot at camp of nomadic Arabs near Tabankort, killing one women and injuring three others. The three injured were evacuated by MINUSMA. Both the rebels and pro-government militias claimed victory in the clashes near Tabankort on July 22, with the MNLA claiming that MINUSMA intervened just before the MNLA was planning to launch an offensive that would've pushed the loyalists out of their positions.\nAftermath\nThe MNLA claimed that several dozen loyalist fighters were killed and injured, but did not give any specifics. Malian media reported several dozen deaths across both sides. One report in particular stated ten rebel fighters were killed and thirty-five were injured. Of those injured, twenty-five were serious. Loyalist fighters saw six killed and fifteen injured.\nFighting broke out again in Ersane, near Tabankort, on July 31. Several loyalists were reportedly killed in the clashes.\nReferences"
