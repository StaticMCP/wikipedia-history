She was a concubine of the Chenghua Emperor and gave birth to his successor, the Hongzhi Emperor.\nBiography\nEmpress Xiaomu's personal name and birth year are unknown. She was a member of the Yao people and came from He County, Guangxi.\nIn 1467, the Ming army launched a punitive expedition against the rebellious Yao tribes in Guangxi, and some of the captives were taken as servants to the Forbidden City, including Lady Ji.\nIn 1469, Lady Ji met the Chenghua Emperor and became pregnant. Her pregnancy was discovered by Lady Wan, the Emperor's favorite concubine, who feared losing her position if another woman bore the Emperor a son. In order to prevent this, Lady Wan ordered the eunuchs to perform an abortion on Lady Ji, but the eunuchs did not comply and instead hid Lady Ji and her child in the chambers of the Chenghua Emperor's former Empress Wu. It was there that Lady Ji gave birth to a boy on 30 July 1470. The secret remained hidden until June 1475, when the Emperor, who was now twenty-eight years old and still without an heir, was informed by a knowledgeable eunuch about the existence of his five-year-old son. Excited by this news, the Emperor recognized his son and moved him to safety under the protection of his mother, Empress Dowager Zhou. The boy was given the name Zhu Youcheng.\nOne month later, Lady Ji died under suspicious circumstances. According to some historians, such as Frederick Mote, she was believed to have been poisoned by an agent of Lady Wan. As a result, the Emperor moved out of the palace occupied by Lady Wan and took measures to protect his heir from her influence. The Empress Dowager even warned Zhu Youcheng not to consume anything when visiting Lady Wan. Zhu Youcheng became the heir to the throne and, upon the Chenghua Emperor's death, ascended to the throne as the Hongzhi Emperor.\nLady Ji was posthumously granted the title of Consort Shu with the posthumous name Gongkezhuangxi (). After his accession, her son elevated her to empress by granting her the posthumous name \"Empress Xiaomu Cihui Gongke Zhuangxi Chongtian Chengsheng Chun\" (), commonly referred to as Empress Xiaomu (). In 1536, the Jiajing Emperor shortened her posthumous title to \"Empress Xiaomu Cihui Gongke Zhuangxi Chongtian Chengsheng\" (), removing the character \"Chun\", which was the posthumous title of the Chenghua Emperor.\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*  |orig-year=1739}}"
