The following is a list of mentions of him in popular culture.\nPopular fiction\n*In Youjo Senki, the protagonist Tanya von Degurechaff is based on the Red Baron.\n* In Dean McLaughlin's \"Hawk Among the Sparrows\", the protagonist, a pilot of a modern VTOL interceptor, accidentally appears in 1918, where he withstands a Red Baron analogue named Bruno Keyserling.\n*Corto Maltese, a character by Italian cartoonist Hugo Pratt, witnesses the defeat of the Red Baron.\n*Hans von Hammer, the troubled protagonist of DC Comics's Enemy Ace was inspired in part by Richthofen. Piloting a scarlet Fokker Dr. 1, von Hammer is a flying knight who fights according to the code of chivalry, despite being deeply disturbed by the slaughter around him. Unlike the Baron, however, Hans von Hammer was depicted as having survived to fight in World War II, in adventures inspired by those of Adolf Galland.\n*Manfred von Richthofen is one of the main characters of Jeffrey Shaara's book, To the Last Man.\n*The second volume in Kim Newman's Anno Dracula series, The Bloody Red Baron, features a vampire Richthofen who undergoes treatment in order to transform into a large bat-like creature and dispense with the need for an aeroplane.\n*Eugene Byrne & Kim Newman's novel Back in the USSA features the Red Baron assisting Mexican forces invading Texas, during a communist revolution in the United States led by Eugene Debs.\n*The last book in the Time Machine series, World War I Flying Ace, asks the reader to find out who shot down the Red Baron and take a photograph to prove the answer.\n*In the novel Burning Shore by Wilbur Smith, one of the main characters, Lord Andrew Killigan, is shot down by the Red Baron's Flying Circus.\n*Baron Soontir Fel, a character from the Star Wars expanded universe (now known as Star Wars Legends) was based on Richthofen, as was Baron Elrik Vonreg, a First Order pilot in the animated TV series Star Wars Resistance. Vonreg's TIE fighter is colored red, similar to Richthofen's aircraft.\n*Arrowdreams, a Prix Aurora Award-winning anthology of alternate history short stories, includes \"Misfire\", a story by Shane Simmons in which Richthofen survives World War I and eventually commands the Luftwaffe in World War II, displacing Hermann Göring, and leading them to an unqualified victory in the Battle of Britain.\n*In Fred Saberhagen's Berserker short story \"Wings out of Shadow\" (1974), a personality construct of Manfred von Richthofen, together with other World War I flying ace constructs, plays a pivotal role in a defensive withdrawal while pursued by a numerically superior force.\n*In Biggles Learns to Fly, the protagonist, James \"Biggles\" Bigglesworth, find himself confronting Richthofen's Flying Circus several times. He engages in direct combat with Richthofen during his first patrol with Royal Flying Corps Squadron 266, and later devises a plan for multiple squadrons to attack the Richthofen Circus stationed at Douai.\nComic strips (Peanuts)\n* After the first comic strip featuring Snoopy fighting the Red Baron appeared on Sunday October 10, 1965, Richthofen was mentioned regularly in the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles Schulz, and was included in subsequent television specials as a running gag. Charlie Brown's beagle Snoopy frequently fantasized about being a World War I flying ace.  In his daydreams, he imagined his dog house to be a Sopwith Camel and carried a personal grudge against the Red Baron, whom he imagined to be his arch enemy. In spite of Snoopy's best efforts, however, the \"Baron\" always shot him down with little difficulty, leading Snoopy to curse the Baron for his success and swear to one day shoot him down. This recurring story arc inspired songs by The Royal Guardsmen. The imaginary air battles between Snoopy and the Baron are referenced in The Bloody Red Baron, the second book in Kim Newman's Anno Dracula series, where a beagle resembling Snoopy is shot by the Baron, who feels a strange hatred towards the animal he cannot explain. Despite the antagonistic relationship the characters had in the comic strip, novels and video games, other media depicted them in less combative roles. In the Royal Guardsmen's song \"Snoopy's Christmas\", the Baron and Snoopy are depicted as participating in The Christmas Truce. A later song by the Guardsmen, \"Snoopy for President\", sees the Baron cast the ballot that allows Snoopy to become President of the United States, explicitly referring to Snoopy as his friend, as he also does in \"Snoopy's Christmas\".\nBoard game references\n* The Red Baron was the inspiration for Avalon Hill's 1970s board game ''Richthofen's War, one of the first World War I aerial combat board games.\n* The Red Baron was also prominently featured in Snoopy & The Red Baron, a Milton Bradley skill game released in 1970.\nMovies\nConcrete\n* 1927: Richthofen, a 1927 German silent war film, starring Carl Walther Meyer as Richthofen, was the first film to portray the life of the World War I fighter pilot.\n* 1971: The Roger Corman movie, Von Richthofen and Brown, alternatively titled The Red Baron, starred John Phillip Law as Richthofen.\n* 2008: The Red Baron, a romanticized biopic, starring Matthias Schweighöfer as Richthofen.\nIndirect\n., replica of the famous Manfred von Richthofen triplane at the ILA 2006]]\n* 1927: A Richthofen-based character appears briefly in the World War I-epic Wings, directed by air combat veteran William A.

He informs Blackadder and Baldrick, \"For us, a toilet is a mundane, functional item. For you it is the basis of an entire culture!\" Before retiring to his chateau, Richthofen comments that \"Gallant Lord Flashheart still eludes me.\" Soon after, Flashheart and Lieutenant George arrive to rescue their fellow flyers.
