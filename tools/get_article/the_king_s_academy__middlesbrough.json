Established in 2003, it is run by the Emmanuel Schools Foundation established by entrepreneur Sir Peter Vardy. It was officially opened by Prime Minister Tony Blair in March 2004.\nIt was built to replace the former Local Authority-run Brackenhoe and Coulby Newham secondary schools and Beverley School for the Deaf, accepting its first students from educational years 7 to 11 on 8 September 2003 and first opening its sixth form a year later. It has capacity for 1,250 students and promotes a specialism in Business and Enterprise. It is wholly funded by the Department for Education and operates the same intake policy as that in place across all other Local Authority-maintained schools in Middlesbrough. It reserves 10% of its intake for children with Statements of Special Educational Needs, specifically for those with hearing and visual impairment and those with moderate learning difficulties.\nAcademic achievement\nIn the academy's first Ofsted report in 2005 it was described as \"a good school with many strong features\". In its second Ofsted report in 2009 it was described as \"a good school with many outstanding features\". Ofsted report gradings in 2009 were \"Outstanding\" for Care, Guidance and Support and for Personal Development and Well-being and \"Good\" in all other areas.\nIn its first nine years of operation, the academy increased its GCSE pass rate (5 A&ndash;C) from 34% in 2004 to 89% in 2012 In 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011 it was given a Contextual Value Added (CVA) score that placed it in the top 10% of all schools nationally for the progress its students make between the start of Year 7 and the end of Year 11. In January 2009, The Guardian newspaper ranked The King's Academy amongst the top 50 most improved secondary schools in the country. The academy runs a sixth form, where examination results have improved consistently over the last four years.\nEven before it opened, opponents of City Academies and of the Emmanuel Schools Foundation, including the British scientist and atheist Richard Dawkins, claimed that the Academy would teach creationism in science lessons; this allegation was published in the national press and repeated for a few years.\nHowever, the school consistently denied teaching creationism. Finally, in 2006, The Guardian visited the school and published a strongly supportive article, emphasising that associating the school with creationism \"couldn't be more wrong.\"\nCurriculum\nAt Key Stage 3 students study English, mathematics, science, business studies, ICT and enterprise, French or German, history, geography, religious education, engineering or resistant materials, food technology, art & design, music, drama and physical education.\nAt Key Stage 4 all of the above subjects may be studied through an options system, plus English literature, double or triple science, economics, graphic products, textiles, electronics, business communications, health & social care and travel & tourism.\nAt Key Stage 5, Advanced Levels are offered in English language, English literature, mathematics & mechanics, mathematics & statistics, further mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, applied science, French, German, applied business, applied ICT, economics, history, geography, psychology, religious education, product design, food technology, art, textiles, theatre studies, music and physical education.
