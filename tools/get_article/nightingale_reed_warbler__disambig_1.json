They coined the binomial name, Thryothorus luscinius.}} Until 2011, the Pagan reed warbler, Aguiguan reed warbler, and Saipan reed warbler were considered as subspecies of the nightingale reed warbler until split by the IOC.\nExtinction\nThe nightingale reed warbler was driven to extinction by several introduced species. These included the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) which has also decimated the populations or even caused the extinctions of several other bird species on Guam. Other introduced predators included rats (Rattus sp.), cats (Felis catus) and feral ungulates such as goats (Capra hircus) or sheep (Ovis aries). An introduced plant, ivy gourd (Coccinia grandis), destroyed the canopy of the trees that nightingale reed warblers built their nests in. Wetland destruction, fires and pesticides, as well as intensive land use for agriculture or building further reduced the available habitat. It has not been seen since 1969.\nNesting\nThe nightingale reed warbler was nonmigratory and nested year round. The typical clutch had two eggs that were white with a green tint and were covered in lavender, chestnut, and black spots.\nSee also\n* List of birds of Guam\n* List of birds of the Northern Mariana Islands\nNotes\nReferences"
