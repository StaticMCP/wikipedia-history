However other USAAF commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) also had a significant number of airfields.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nArmy Air Force Training Command\n* Chester Army Airfield, Perryville\n: Contract flying training\n: Now: Perryville Municipal Airport\n* Harris Army Airfield, Cape Girardeau\n: Contract flying training\n: Now: Cape Girardeau Regional Airport\n* Harvey Parks Airport, Sikeston\n: Contract flying training\n: Now: Sikeston Memorial Municipal Airport\nTroop Carrier Command\n* Malden Army Airfield, Malden\n: 445th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Malden Air Base (1951–1960)\n: USAF Contract Flight Training\n: Now: Malden Regional Airport\n* Sedalia Army Airfield, Knob Noster\n: I Troop Carrier Command\n: 405th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Sedalia Air Force Auxiliary Field (1948–1951)\n: Was: Sedalia Air Force Base (1951–1955)\n: Now:  Whiteman Air Force Base (1955–Pres)\n* Vichy Army Airfield, Vichy\n: Sub-base of Sedalia AAF\n: Now: Rolla National Airport\n* Grandview Airport, Belton (1944–1945)\n: Was: Grandview Air Force Base (1952–1957)\n: Was: Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base {Active USAF control} (1957–1976)\n: Was: Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base then Richards-Gebaur Air Reserve Station {AFRES/AFRC control} and Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport (1976–1999)\n: Closed 1999.
