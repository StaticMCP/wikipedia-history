It was initially known as the Working Indonesia Coalition, founded in 2018. The coalition was later utilized as the government of President Joko Widodo from 2019 to 2024. It was dissolved on 20 October 2024.\nwith the leaders of the Coalition of Cooperation of Government Supporting Parties (KP3) having dinner, July 2018.

The formation of the coalition was carried out in the declaration at Plataran Restaurant, Menteng, Central Jakarta. This continued the previous coalition, the Great Indonesia Coalition by Megawati Sukarnoputri.\nJoko Widodo also formed his team to win himself as a presidential candidate named the National Campaign Team led by Erick Thohir. It was agreed that Ma'ruf Amin would be a candidate for vice president against Sandiaga Uno. Jokowi and Ma'ruf started registering their candidacy on 10 August 2018 together with the leaders of the coalition political parties. Jokowi wore a shirt that reads  (\"Clean, Popular, Real Works\") and departed from the Joang '45 Building to the General Elections Commission Building.\nOn 21 October 2019, Joko Widodo offered Gerindra to join his coalition. Then, he entered the names Prabowo Subianto and Edhy Prabowo as ministers in his cabinet. Gerindra Party officially joined the coalition on 23 October 2019. This was a disappointment for the people who had supported Prabowo as a presidential candidate. the National Mandate Party followed Gerindra to join the coalition on 25 August 2021.\nMember parties\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:73%;\"\n!colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\"|Name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ideology\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Position\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Leader(s)\n!colspan=\"2\"|2019 result\n|-\n!Votes (%)\n!Seats\n|-\n!colspan=\"8\"|National party / members of DPR\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|PDI-P\n|Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle\n|Marhaenism\n|Centre-left\n|Megawati Sukarnoputri\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|19.33%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gerindra\n|Great Indonesia Movement Party\n|National conservatism\n|Right-wing\n|Prabowo Subianto\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|12.57%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|Golkar\n|Party of the Functional Groups\n|Economic liberalism\n|Centre-right to right-wing\n|Bahlil Lahadalia\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|12.31%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|NasDem\n|National Democratic Party\n|Social liberalism\n|Centre to centre-left\n|Surya Paloh\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|9.05%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|PKB\n|National Awakening Party\n|Islamic democracy\n|Centre\n|Muhaimin Iskandar\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|9.69%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|Demokrat\n|Democratic Party\n|Constitutionalism\n|Centre to centre-right\n|Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.77%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|PAN\n|National Mandate Party\n|Religious nationalism\n|Centre to centre-right\n|Zulkifli Hasan\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.84%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|PPP\n|United Development Party\n|Pan-Islamism\n|Centre-right to right-wing\n|Muhammad Mardiono\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.52%\n|}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"8\"|National party / non-members of DPR\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|Perindo\n|Indonesian Unity Party\n|Conservatism\n|Centre-right\n|Hary Tanoesoedibjo\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.67%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|PSI\n|Indonesian Solidarity Party\n|Progressivism\n|Centre-left to left-wing\n|Kaesang Pangarep\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.89%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|Hanura\n|People's Conscience Party\n|Corporatism\n|Centre\n|Oesman Sapta Odang\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.54%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|PBB\n|Crescent Star Party\n|Islamic democracy\n|Right-wing\n|Yusril Ihza Mahendra\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.79%\n|}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|PKP\n|Justice and Unity Party\n|Secularism\n|Centre\n|Yussuf Solichien\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.22%\n|}}\n|}\nLeadership structure\n, the  Chairman of the Onward Indonesia Coalition.]]\n* Chairman:\n** Joko Widodo (PDI-P)\n* Leadership Council:\n** Megawati Sukarnoputri (PDI-P)\n** Airlangga Hartarto (Golkar)\n** Prabowo Subianto (Gerindra)\n** Surya Paloh (Nasdem)\n** Muhaimin Iskandar (PKB)\n** Zulkifli Hasan (PAN)\n** Suharso Monoarfa (PPP)\n** Hary Tanoesoedibjo (Perindo)\n** Giring Ganesha (PSI)\n** Oesman Sapta Odang (Hanura)\n** Yusril Ihza Mahendra (PBB)\n** Yussuf Solichien (PKP)\n* Secretariat Council:\n** Hasto Kristiyanto (PDI-P)\n** Lodewijk Freidrich Paulus (Golkar)\n** Ahmad Muzani (Gerindra)\n** Johnny Gerard Plate (Nasdem)\n** Hasanuddin Wahid (PKB)\n** Eddy Soeparno (PAN)\n** Arwani Thomafi (PPP)\n** Ahmad Rofiq (Perindo)\n** Dea Tunggaesti (PSI)\n** Kodrat Shah (Hanura)\n** Afriansyah Noor (PBB)\n** Syahrul Mamma (PKP)\nGeneral election results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Election\n!Total seats won\n!Share of seats\n!Total votes\n!Share of votes\n!Outcome of election\n|-\n!2019\n|}}\n|60.69%\n|86,801,597\n|62.01%\n|12 seats (2014 result); Governing coalition\n|}\nControversies\nPKB chairman Muhaimin Iskandar proposes postponing the 2024 general election and invites the leaders of coalition political parties with reasons for economic recovery. He said that the general election should be postponed a year or two after the presidential term ends in 2024. This statement was reinforced by the coordinating minister Luhut Binsar Panjaitan who claimed the existence of big data containing 110 million netizens who support the postponement of the election. PAN's Zulkifli Hasan and Golkar's Airlangga Hartarto said the same thing as Muhaimin said. They continued to urge all coalition party leaders to fulfill their wishes even though several political parties, such as PDIP, Gerindra, Nasdem and PPP, refused to postpone the election. Despite refusing to postpone the election, PSI is trying to push for an extension of the presidential term by supporting Jokowi's return as president.\nFacing increasingly heated issues, President Joko Widodo stressed to his ministers not to make controversial statements related to postponing elections and extending the presidential term. In the cabinet, the ministers who proposed this were Bahlil Lahadalia, Luhut Binsar Panjaitan and Airlangga Hartarto. The public responded to their statements by holding large-scale demonstrations.\nReferences"
