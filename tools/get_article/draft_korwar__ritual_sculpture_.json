These figures are so distinctive that they lend their name to the local artistic style: the Korwar style. It is believed that stylistic influences from Southeast Asia are evident here.\nDescription\nA Korwar is a figure with an oversized skull atop a seated human body, with bent knees and el-bows touching to form a “W” shape. Between its hands, the statue holds a perforated shield—believed to represent either a tree of life or the shedding of a snake’s skin, both symbols of rebirth. The arrow-shaped nose is typical of the Korwar style. Originally, the fleshless skull of a deceased ancestor was placed on the sculpture. How-ever, many Korwar figures are content with a carved representation of the skull. Some theorists suggest that Korwar figures with actual human skulls instead of carved heads represent a more original type. The skulls are mounted on a peg or a box-shaped attachment. In general, the skulls of prominent ancestors were venerated through such figures. Occasionally, smaller figures with children's skulls also appear.\nRitual Use\nThis statue serves as a vessel for the spirit of a deceased ancestor (Korwar in the local language), so that it does not wander—something considered unfavorable for the living and potentially damaging to the family's reputation and power. The deceased, honored through this statue, receives a sacred figure and thus serves as a spiritual guide for the living. He is consul-ted in important decisions, for example by sleeping on the skull or through a divination ritu-al. The use of human skulls for this purpose was banned in the early 20th century under pressure from the Dutch colonial govern-ment. Today, such objects are produced for the art market or as souvenirs."
