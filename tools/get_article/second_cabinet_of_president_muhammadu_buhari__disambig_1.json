Most ministers were sworn in on 21 August 2019 and the cabinet was dissolved on 29 May 2023, the day of Bola Tinubu's inauguration.\nFormation\nSimilarly to his first cabinet formation, Buhari delayed appointing a cabinet until later in the year, much to the chagrin of pundits and economists who said that the delay was hurting policy development and economic growth.\nOn 11 November, a cabinet of 43 ministers from each of the 36 states of Nigeria was sworn in.}} The list did not contain over a dozen ministers that were in Buhari's first cabinet while including numerous former governors. The new cabinet was criticized for its decline in gender diversity (with only seven women compared to fifteen at the start of the last cabinet) and preference for political allies over technocrats.\nCabinet of Nigeria\n| minister1_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister1_termstart   = 29 May 2019\n| minister1_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister1_termend     = 17 April 2020\n| minister2             = Ibrahim Gambari\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 13 May 2020\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister1_termend     = 1 September 2021\n| minister2             = Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 1 September 2021\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Goodluck Nanah Opiah\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Mohammed Hassan Abdullahi\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 April 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Odum Udi\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Ekumankama Joseph Nkama\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Festus Keyamo\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 24 September 2019\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Gbemisola Ruqayyah Saraki\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Umana Okon Umana\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Tayo Alasoadura\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 24 September 2019\n| minister2_termend     = May 2022\n| minister3             = Sharon Ikeazor\n| minister3_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister3_termstart   = 6 July 2022}}\n| minister1_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister1_termstart   = 21 August 2019\n| minister1_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Abubakar Aliyu\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 1 September 2021}}}}\n| minister2             = Adeleke Mamora\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Mu'azu Sambo\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Ademola Adewole Adegoroye\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister2_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n| minister2             = Mu'azu Sambo\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 24 December 2021\n| minister2_termend     = 6 July 2022\n| minister3             = Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub\n| minister3_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister3_termstart   = 6 July 2022\n| minister3_termend     = 29 May 2023\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n*Cabinet of Nigeria\n*Federal government of Nigeria\nNotes\nReferences"
