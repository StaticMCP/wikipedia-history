The album was edited, with notes, by Louis Untermeyer; original music and sound effects were composed by Victor Young and Lehman Engel with the Jean Neilson Verse Choir. Artists reading are Brian Donlevy, Agnes Moorehead, Fredric March, Walter Huston, Pat O'Brien, and Bing Crosby.\nReception\nHoward Taubman, writing in The New York Times heralded the release of the album. “With considerable beating of the drums, Decca has issued an album called “Our Common Heritage” (eight 10 inch records). It contains sixteen poems commemorating “milestones in the history of America.” Jack Kapp, president of Decca is keynoting the campaign for this album [and writes] “Who else but Bing Crosby, who symbolises America to the world, should read The Star-Spangled Banner? And who else should make it a living experience, read as we believe Francis Scott Key felt it?” Who else, indeed? Unless of course, it should occur to you that you could read it for yourself....If it makes American ideals shine more brightly for them to hear Bing Crosby, Pat O’Brien and the others dramatize them, only a bounder would disagree with Mr. Kapp.”\nTrack listing\nThese songs were featured on an 8-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. A-536.\nDisc 1: (40030)\n| “Columbus\", (Joaquin Miller), recorded December 17, 1945 by Brian Donlevy with Victor Young and His Orchestra.\n| \"Old Ironsides\" (Oliver Wendell Holmes), recorded August 15, 1946 by Bing Crosby with Victor Young and His Orchestra.\n}}\nDisc 7: (40036)\nDisc 8: (40037)\nLP release\nThe album was re-released as a 12” LP (DL 9072) in 1959.\nLP track listing\nSIDE ONE\n# “Columbus\"\n# \"The American Flag”\n# “Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers\"\n# \"Barbara Frietchie\"\n# \"Paul Revere’s Ride\"\n# \"Paul Revere’s Ride\"\n# “Warren’s Address to American Soldiers (June 17, 1775) / Concord Hymn\"\n# \"Hail Columbia\"\nSIDE TWO\n# “America”\n# “Sheridan’s Ride\"\n# \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"\n# “Old Ironsides\n# \"Nancy Hanks\"\n# “Lincoln, Man of the People\"\n# “O Captain!
