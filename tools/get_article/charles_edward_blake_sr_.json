He became a Christian and converted to Pentecostal Christianity as a young adolescent, under the ministry of his mother and father in Arkansas, and he and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was in his 20's when his father was asked to take over as a bishop of the First Jurisdiction of Southern California for the COGIC denomination.\nIn 1969, he was asked by his father and by Southern California COGIC bishop, Bishop Samuel M. Crouch, to take over as the pastor of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ. He was officially installed as the senior pastor of the church the following year in 1970. It was also around this time, that he married his wife, Mae Lawrence Blake, a native of Michigan and daughter of another COGIC bishop and pastor, and they had three children together, Charles Blake Jr., Lawrence \"Larry\" Blake, and Kimberly Blake.\nBishop Blake was the pastor of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ, one of the largest African-American churches in the Western United States, with a membership of over 24,000, from 1969 until his retirement in 2022. The church started with only 50 members in 1969 when he became pastor.\nIn 1982, he was selected by Ebony magazine as one of the 15 \"Greatest Preachers in America\". Since 2007, Ebony has recognized Bishop Blake annually, as one of its 100+ most influential African Americans. In the 1990's and early 2000's, Blake also penned articles for Ebony and Christianity Today noting the importance of the Black Church's influence on presidential elections and American politics and society in general.  In 1984, after the death of his father,  he was ordained and consecrated as a jurisdictional bishop of the First Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of Southern California for the COGIC denomination, and remained in that position until 2009 when he stepped down from the position to dedicate himself fully to the duties of the Office of  the Presiding Bishop.\nHe was also a member of the General Board, the twelve head religious and executive leaders and head bishops of the COGIC denomination from 1988 until 2021.\nBishop Blake is an ardent advocate of education and academic excellence, who holds multiple academic and honorary degrees, from various educational institutions.

On November 15, 2016, Bishop Blake was reelected as the Presiding Bishop of the Church of God in Christ during the 2016 COGIC Election held by the COGIC General Assembly to a third four-year term. On October 23, 2020, Bishop Blake announced that he will not seek re-election as Presiding Bishop nor as a member of the General Board. He officially retired on March 19, 2021, and was succeeded by Bishop J. Drew Sheard Sr. as Presiding Bishop on March 20, 2021.\nOn April 24, 2022, while addressing his local congregation at the West Angeles COGIC for their sunday morning service, he announced that he has been dealing with and coping with Parkinson's disease, \"for the past ten years\", and that as of April 2022, he was going to be retiring as the senior pastor of West Angeles COGIC, and that his two sons who are also COGIC elders and ministers, Reverends Charles Jr. and Lawrence Blake, would be taking over as the de facto pastor and assistant pastor of the West Angeles congregation, respectively.\nHe announced that he met with the ministry leaders and church council and trustee board members and consulted with them to approve of Charles Jr. and Lawrence Blake, taking over much of his duties as the de facto pastor and assistant pastor of the church. However, he said in his remarks that he did not want to use the word \"retirement\" as he said, \"he would still be worshiping and fellowshiping with the saints of God in worship services, and that he would still be around for anyone who needs pastoral and fatherly counseling, prayer, and mentorship.\" He added that he would no longer be carrying out his official duties as senior pastor of the church, and that he would \"continue to serve the Lord Jesus Christ and serve the ministries of West Angeles however the Lord leads me and however you all may need me as the Lord sees fit and allows me to live on, so consider myself as semi-retired.\"\nHis sons Charles Jr. and Lawrence Blake were officially appointed as the senior pastor and assistant pastor of the church in October 2022. In August of 2024, his younger son, Reverend Lawrence Blake, stepped down as assistant pastor of West Angeles, in order to become the senior pastor of the Palm Lane Church of God in Christ, where he was installed as the official senior pastor of the Palm Lane Church on September 1, 2024.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cogic.org/ Church of God in Christ]\n*[https://www.westa.org/ West Angeles Church of God in Christ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070604184548/http://www.bbless.org/cogic.leaders.htm Succession of Church of God in Christ Leaders]"
