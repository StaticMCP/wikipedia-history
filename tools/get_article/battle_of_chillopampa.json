In 1531, he sent his general Atoc to reclaim those areas viewed as rightfully belonging to him and to the line of the dynasty of Manco Cápac. The battle of Chillopampa Plains was the first major encounter, where the vast superiority and tactical experience of Atoc made the Huáscaran side emerge as victors. Atahualpa was captured in battle, but escaped to face the armies of his half-brother again in the battle of Chimborazo.\n}}\n\n---\n\n## Battle of chillopampa\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Chillopampa"
