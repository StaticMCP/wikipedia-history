Built during the mid-1920s following the establishment of the University College Colombo, it was meant to function as a theatre, lecture hall, and venue for many university functions, a purpose it serves to this day.\nReferences\n*[https://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2009/11/15/mon20.asp Itipahan (Burly Lamp) Chapter - 14 ]\n*[https://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2006/11/19/imp05.asp Maname: Continuation of the same production]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722145621/http://www.cmj.slma.lk/cmj4501/47.htm Earle de Fonseka (Professor T E G de Fonseka)]"
