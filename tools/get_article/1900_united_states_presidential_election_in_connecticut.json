Voters chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nConnecticut overwhelmingly voted for the Republican nominee, President William McKinley, over the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Representative and 1896 Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan. McKinley won Connecticut by a margin of 15.85% in this rematch of the 1896 presidential election. The return of economic prosperity and recent victory in the Spanish–American War helped McKinley to score a decisive victory.\nBryan had previous lost Connecticut to McKinley four years earlier and would later lose the state again in 1908 to William Howard Taft.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Connecticut\nReferences"
