This convinced Miranda that it would do more harm than good to continue the resistance.\nConsequences\nMiranda entered into negotiations with Monteverde and a ceasefire was signed on 25 July 1812. Monteverde did not honour the conditions of the ceasefire and several days later arrested many patriots who had been granted amnesty, including Francisco de Miranda, who would die in prison. The First Venezuelan Republic came to an end when Monteverde's forces entered Caracas on 1 August.\nReferences\n* [http://www.venezuelatuya.com/historia/independencia1.htm La Independencia (Parte I)], VenezuelaTuya —\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwcCAAAAYAAJ&q=La+Victoria Bosquejo de la historia militar de Venezuela en la guerra de su ..., Volume 1 by José de Austri p. 141-163]"
