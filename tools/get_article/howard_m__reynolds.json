He designed gracefully proportioned, notable public buildings in the prevailing fashionable styles of the 1920s, including Mediterranean Revival, Colonial Revival, Spanish Colonial, Egyptian Revival, Art Deco and Art Moderne.\nAmong Reynolds' best known works are a number of educational buildings still in use as schools or community centers in Central Florida.  Many of Reynolds' suave, stylish buildings have been designated as Orlando Historic Landmarks.\nReynolds' was among a small but active group of ten architectural firms listed in the Orlando phone directory in 1926, the others including: Frank L. Bodine, Fred E. Field, David Hyer, Murry S. King, George E. Krug, Ryan and Roberts (Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts) and Percy P. Turner.  This group of architects felt it important to create a distinctive regional architecture, an effort which they described in the Florida journal The Florida Circle in 1924 as follows:\n\"Just as architects of old created styles to harmonize with their environment, so have the architects of Florida been creating, from native motifs, a style that is carefully adapted to the climatic conditions and surroundings of the state. This style has an individuality all its own and should have a fitting name to express its origins . . . The Florida Association of Architects will give a prize of $25.00 for the name selected.\"\nOn February 21, 1916, Reynolds married Doris Crandall who was born on January 25, 1896 (died 1978).  They were the parents of three children: Marie (Mrs. Harry H. Fetters), Howard M. Jr. (1922-1990) (married Darlene Lentz) and Robert (married Mary Elizabeth Saine).\nArchitectural work – partial listing\n* Howard Middle School (former Orlando High School), 800 East Robinson St., Orlando, Florida - 1926\n* Howard M.
