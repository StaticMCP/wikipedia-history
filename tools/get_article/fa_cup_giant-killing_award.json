Radford scored from 30 yards to level the tie five minutes from time, and Hereford of the Southern League scored the winner in extra time through Ricky George, to advance at the expense of the First Division side.\nWhen the award was introduced in 2010–11, fans voted for what they consider the biggest giant-killing of the season, with the victorious club being presented with the award, originally by Radford, at the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. The award was discontinued after the 2018–19 season.\nWinners\n2010–11\nWinners: Crawley Town\n*Torres\n| goals2 =\n*Addison\n| stadium = Broadfield Stadium, Crawley\n| attendance = 4,145\n| referee = Mark Haywood\n}}\n2011–12\nWinners: Swindon Town\n*Benson\n| goals2 =\n*McManaman\n| stadium = County Ground, Swindon\n| attendance = 10,488\n| referee = Peter Walton\n}}\n2012–13\nWinners: Luton Town\n| stadium = Carrow Road, Norwich\n| attendance = 26,521\n| referee = Andre Marriner\n}}\n2013–14\nWinners: Sheffield United\n| goals2 =\n*Murphy\n*Flynn\n| stadium = Villa Park, Birmingham\n| attendance = 24,038\n| referee = David Coote\n}}\n2014–15\nWinners: Bradford City\n*Ramires\n| goals2 =\n*Stead\n*Morais\n*Halliday\n*Yeates\n| stadium = Stamford Bridge, London\n| attendance = 41,014\n| referee = Andre Marriner\n}}\n2015–16\nWinners: Chesham United\n| stadium = Memorial Ground, Bristol\n| attendance = 5,181\n| referee = Andy Davies\n}}\n2016–17\nWinners: Lincoln City\n| stadium = Turf Moor, Burnley\n| attendance = 19,185\n| referee = Graham Scott\n}}\n2017–18\nWinners: Wigan Athletic\n| goals2 =\n| stadium = DW Stadium, Wigan\n| attendance = 19,242\n| referee = Anthony Taylor\n}}\n2018–19\nWinners: Oldham Athletic\n| goals2 =\n*Surridge\n*Lang\n| stadium = Craven Cottage, Fulham\n| attendance = 16,134\n| referee = Anthony Taylor\n}}\nReferences"
