The product and company name have since been purchased by an Australian consulting firm, SMS Management & Technology.\nHotDog and the company became the 'dotcom darling' of the Australian media receiving a large amount of media exposure due to the young age of the company's founder and staff featuring pinball machines and a pool table in the company's reception area.\nSausage Software also invested in various other pioneering software strategies and products:\n* A range of small independent software products called \"snaglets\"\n* A unique freeware texture generator called Reptile\n* An early micro-payment system called the eVend Cashlet\n* A Java Electronic Commerce Server (JECS), a generalised middleware layer serving Java Applets with database data on request via an XML-like request/response protocol.\nTheir website was one of the most popular at the time, receiving 250,000 hits per day in 1996.\nProducts\n;Software\n;Snaglets\n;Other\n* Weenies\nSource:\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
