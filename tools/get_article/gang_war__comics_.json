It was created by Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr. The story involves Spider-Man and the local superheroes working to deal with a gang war between the different families after Tombstone was shot and the crime families plan to take over the criminal underworld.\nAmazing Spider-Man Vol. 6 #39, Deadly Hands of Kung Fu: Gang War #1, and Luke Cage: Gang War #2 were dedicated in memory of Keith Giffen who died from a stroke on October 9, 2023. Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 6 #40, Luke Cage: Gang War #3, Miles Morales: Spider-Man Vol. 2 #14, and Spider-Woman Vol. 8 #2 saluted the retirement of Alison Gill.\nThe event overall received mixed to negative reviews, with criticism directed towards Romita's artwork, the large number of tie-ins, pacing, inconsistent character arcs, and the lack of focus on Peter Parker's Spider-Man.  However, the ongoing titles for Miles Morales: Spider-Man and Spider-Woman in the event were positively received.\nPublication history\nGang War details the various crime families of New York City going to war after Tombstone is shot by Shotgun during the wedding of Janice Lincoln and Randy Robertson.

Tim Rooney from Comicsbeat wrote \"If this were Marvel Universe: Gang War, I could imagine giving this a recommendation. But for a story in Amazing Spider-Man, it is disappointing, and another example of how this title is held back by editorial and publishing demands to keep Peter Parker frozen in amber.\"\nNotes\nReferences"
