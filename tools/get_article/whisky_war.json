Between 1973 and 2022, the island was under dispute between the two nations, although never amounting to direct conflict or violence.\nBoth countries agreed on a process in 2005 to resolve the issue, which was finally settled in 2022, resulting in the creation of a land border on the island between the two states.\nBackground\nHans Island (known as Hans Ø in Danish and Tartupaluk in Greenlandic) is in the middle of the Kennedy Channel between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. Hans Island is approximately 1.3 km2 in size and is barren. Hans Island is not inhabited, though it was previously used by indigenous Inuit populations in the area during the 19th century. The Canadian claim to the island arose from the 1880 purchase of Hudson's Bay Company land to Canadian Government territory. The Danish argument was that Hans Island was vital to their indigenous populations for fishing, creating an integral part of the nearby Greenlandic area.\nLand dispute\nCanada and Denmark signed an agreement through the United Nations on 17 December 1973. The agreement set out to delimit the continental shelf between the two nations. This was influenced by the maritime boundary line, which fell almost directly down the middle of Hans Island. The agreement states:\nThe agreement was passed with both nations agreeing to settle the dispute over Hans island at a later date.\nThe dispute was seen as low-priority from the Canadian side. A Canadian Special Senate Committee on the Arctic meeting was held on March 18, 2019, where the conflict was deemed \"almost insignificant\" by Michael Byers, a Professor and Canada Research Chair at the University of British Columbia, consulting as a civilian on the matter.\nConflict\nand cans of pork and fruit left by Danish forces on Hans Island in 2003]]\nIn 1984, Canadian soldiers visited the island and planted a Canadian flag, also leaving a bottle of Canadian whisky. The Danish Minister of Greenland Affairs came to the island himself later the same year with the Danish flag, a bottle of snaps, and a letter stating \"Welcome to the Danish Island\" (). The two countries proceeded to take turns planting their flags on the island and exchanging alcoholic beverages. In 2005 a Canadian man and an unknown source on the Danish side also posted advertisements on Google to \"promote their claims\".\nThe minor border dispute was often considered humorous between the two nations, with diplomats displaying good humour. Despite the serious official nature of the matter, the manner in which the conflict was prosecuted was light-hearted, demonstrated by the length of time taken to settle the dispute, if nothing else. The two nations are on friendly terms, and are also founding members of NATO.\nPeaceful resolution\nCanadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported on June 10, 2022, that the Canadian and Danish governments had settled on a border across the island, dividing it between the Canadian territory of Nunavut and the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland. The resolution occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and was thus meant to create a symbolic example to other nations, implying to Russia that land disputes can be resolved peacefully.\nThe resolution had the side effect of giving Canada and Denmark a land border with each other, meaning that both countries no longer border only one other country (the United States and Germany, respectively).\nThe resolution was ratified by the Folketing on December 19, 2023, thereby ending the dispute from a Danish perspective.\nTimeline\n* 1980–1983 – Canadian firm Dome Petroleum did research on and around the island.\n*1984 – Canadian soldiers placed a bottle of Canadian whisky and their flag on the island.\n* 1984 – Tom Høyem, Danish Minister for Greenland, chartered a helicopter to the island, placing a flag and a bottle there.\n* 1988 – The Danish Arctic Ocean patrol cutter  arrived at the island, built a cairn and placed a flagpole and Danish flag on the island.\n* 1995 – The Danish liaison officer and geodesists flew in and placed another flagpole and flag.\n* Late August 1997 – The Danish Arctic/Ocean patrol cutter  tried to reach the island, but was forced to turn around  from the Island, owing to extreme ice.\n* 2001 – Keith Dewing and Chris Harrison, geologists with the Geological Survey of Canada who were mapping northern Ellesmere Island, flew by helicopter to the island.\n* August 13, 2002 – The Danish inspection ship  arrived and erected a new cairn, flagpole and flag, finding the 1988 flag missing and the 1995 flag in pieces.\n* August 1, 2003 – The crew of the Danish frigate  landed on the island and replaced the Danish flag again.\n* July 13, 2005 – Canadian soldiers landed on the Island, placing a traditional Inuit stone marker (Inukshuk) with a plaque and a Canadian flag.\n* July 20, 2005 – As a symbolic move, Canadian Defence Minister Bill Graham set foot on the island.\n* July 25, 2005 – A Danish government official announced Denmark would issue a letter of protest to Canada.\n* July 25, 2005 – Deputy premier of Greenland, Josef Motzfeldt, stated the island had been occupied by Canada, stating experts should determine which country the island belongs to.\n* July 28, 2005 – The Danish Ambassador to Canada published an article in the Ottawa Citizen newspaper regarding the Danish view on the Hans Island issue.\n* August 4, 2005 – The Danish Arctic/Ocean patrol cutter HDMS Tulugaq was sent from Naval Station Grønnedal to Hans Island to assert Danish sovereignty.

The news was welcomed by Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who stated \"It is time to stop the flag war. It has no place in a modern, international world. Countries like Denmark and Canada must be able to find a peaceful solution in a case such as this.\"\n* August 16, 2005 – According to Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Møller, Denmark and Canada agreed to reopen negotiations regarding the future of Hans Island. Denmark would immediately begin geological surveys in the area, and Per Stig Møller would meet his Canadian counterpart Pierre Pettigrew in New York City in the middle of September. Should they fail to reach an agreement, both governments have agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The government of Greenland agreed to this course of action. Regarding the Danish patrol cutter HDMS Tulugaq then en route to Hans Island, the minister stated \"I have instructed the ship to sail there, but they will not go ashore tearing down [the Canadian] flag and replacing it with a new one. It would be a somewhat childish [behaviour] between two NATO allies.\"\n* August 20, 2005 – Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Pierre Pettigrew, stated Canada's claim to the island had a firm basis in international law and would likely not end up before a world court. \"Our sovereignty over the island has a very strong foundation\", the minister said in a telephone interview with a Canadian Press journalist.\n* September 19, 2005 – According to Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Pierre Pettigrew, Canada and Denmark agreed on a process to resolve the dispute over the island.

This approval was based on an agreement between Canada and Denmark.
