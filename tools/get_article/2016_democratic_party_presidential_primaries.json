The elections took place within all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and Democrats Abroad and occurred between February 1 and June 14, 2016. This was the first time the Democratic primary had nominated a woman for president.\nSix major candidates entered the race starting April 12, 2015, when former Secretary of State and New York Senator Hillary Clinton formally announced her second bid for the presidency. She was followed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, former Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley, former Governor of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb and Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig. A draft movement was started to encourage Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren to seek the presidency. Warren declined to run, as did incumbent Vice President Joe Biden. Webb, Chafee, and Lessig withdrew prior to the February 1, 2016, Iowa caucuses.\nClinton won Iowa by the closest margin in the history of the state's Democratic caucus to date. O'Malley suspended}} his campaign after a distant third-place finish, leaving Clinton and Sanders as the only two candidates. The race turned out to be more competitive than expected, with Sanders decisively winning New Hampshire, while Clinton subsequently won Nevada and won a landslide victory in South Carolina. Clinton then secured numerous important wins in each of the nine most populous states including California, New York, Florida, and Texas, while Sanders scored various victories in between. He then laid off a majority of staff after the New York primary and Clinton's multi-state sweep on April 26. On June 6, the Associated Press and NBC News stated that Clinton had become the presumptive nominee after reaching the required number of delegates, including both pledged and unpledged delegates (superdelegates), to secure the nomination. In doing so, she became the first woman to ever be the presumptive nominee of any major political party in the United States. On June 7, Clinton secured a majority of pledged delegates after winning in the California and New Jersey primaries. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren endorsed Clinton on June 9. Sanders confirmed on June 24 that he would vote for Clinton over Donald Trump in the general election and endorsed Clinton on July 12 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\nOn July 22, WikiLeaks published the Democratic National Committee email leak, in which DNC operatives seemed to deride Bernie Sanders' campaign and discuss ways to advance Clinton's nomination, leading to the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other implicated officials. The leak was allegedly part of an operation by the Russian government to undermine Hillary Clinton. Although the ensuing controversy initially focused on emails that dated from relatively late in the primary, when Clinton was already close to securing the nomination, the emails cast doubt on the DNC's neutrality and, according to Sanders operatives and multiple media commentators, showed that the DNC had favored Clinton since early on. This was evidenced by alleged bias in the scheduling and conduct of the debates, The DNC denied bias, claiming to be cracking down on the non-sanctioned debates that proliferated in recent cycles, while leaving the number of officially sanctioned debates the same as in 2004 and 2008. Donna Brazile, who succeeded Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chair after the first batch of leaks, was shown in the emails leaking primary debate questions to the Clinton campaign before the debates were held, although a senior aide to Sanders came to Brazile's defense and tried to downplay the issue.}} as well as controversial DNC–Clinton agreements regarding financial arrangements and control over policy and hiring decisions. Several Democratic leaders responded that the joint-fundraising agreement was standard, was for the purpose of the general election, and was also offered to the Sanders campaign. However, another agreement that came to light gave the Clinton campaign powers over the DNC well before the primary was decided. Some media commentators noted that the Clinton campaign's level of influence on staffing decisions was indeed unusual and could have ultimately influenced factors such as the debate schedule.}} Other media commentators have disputed the significance of the emails, arguing that the DNC's internal preference for Clinton was not historically unusual and did not affect the primary enough to sway the outcome, as Clinton received over 3 million more popular votes and 359 more pledged delegates than Sanders. The controversies ultimately led to the formation of a DNC \"unity\" commission to recommend reforms in the party's primary process.\nOn July 26, 2016, the Democratic National Convention officially nominated Clinton for president and a day later, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine for vice president. Clinton and Kaine went on to lose to the Republican ticket of Donald Trump and Mike Pence in the general election.\nCandidates\nNominee\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Democratic nominee for the 2016 presidential election\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n!

The speculation centered on the prospects of Clinton, then-Secretary of State, making a second presidential bid in the 2016 election. Clinton had previously served as a U.S. Senator for New York (2001–09) and was the First Lady of the U.S. (1993–2001). A January 2013 Washington Post–ABC News poll indicated that she had high popularity among the American public.\nThis polling information prompted numerous political pundits and observers to anticipate that Clinton would mount a second presidential bid in 2016, entering the race as the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination. From the party's liberal left wing came calls for a more progressive candidate to challenge what was perceived by many within this segment as the party's establishment. Elizabeth Warren quickly became a highly touted figure within this movement as well as the object of a draft movement to run in the primaries, despite her repeated denials of interest in doing so.\nThe MoveOn.org campaign 'Run Warren Run' announced that it would disband on June 8, 2015, opting to focus its efforts toward progressive issues. The draft campaign's New Hampshire staffer, Kurt Ehrenberg, had joined Sanders' team and most of the remaining staffers were expected to follow suit. Given the historical tendency for sitting vice presidents to seek the presidency in election cycles in which the incumbent president is not a candidate, there was also considerable speculation regarding a potential presidential run by incumbent Vice President Joe Biden, who had previously campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination in the election cycles of 1988 and 2008.\nThis speculation was further fueled by Biden's own expressions of interest in a possible run in 2016. However, on October 21, 2015, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and President Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to enter the race, as he was still dealing with the loss of his son, Beau, who died months earlier at the age of 47. Biden became the nominee for the Democratic Party four years later in the 2020 presidential election where he became the 46th President of the United States after defeating incumbent president Donald Trump in the general election.\nduring a rally, July 2015]]\nOn May 26, 2015, Sanders officially announced his run as a presidential candidate for the Democratic nomination, after an informal announcement on April 30 and speculation since early 2014. Sanders had previously served as Mayor of Burlington, Vermont (1981–89), Vermont's sole U.S. Representative (1991–2007) and Vermont's junior Senator (2007–present). He emerged as the biggest rival to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries, backed by a strong grassroots campaign and a social media following.\nIn November 2014, Jim Webb, a former U.S. Senator who had once served as the U.S. Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration, announced the formation of an exploratory committee in preparation for a possible run for the Democratic presidential nomination. This made Webb the first major potential candidate to take a formal action toward seeking the party's 2016 nomination.\nIn June 2015, Lincoln Chafee, former Governor and Senator of Rhode Island, announced his campaign. Chafee had been a Republican while serving in the senate, and an Independent while serving as Governor. He formed an exploratory committee on April 3. Chafee endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and served as co-chair of his re-election campaign in 2012.\nMartin O'Malley, former Governor of Maryland as well as a former Mayor of Baltimore, made formal steps toward a campaign for the party's nomination in January 2015 with the hiring and retaining of personnel who had served the previous year as political operatives in Iowa&nbsp;– the first presidential nominating state in the primary elections cycle&nbsp;– as staff for his political action committee (PAC). O'Malley had started the \"O' Say Can You See\" PAC in 2012 which had, prior to 2015, functioned primarily as fundraising vehicles for various Democratic candidates, as well as for two 2014 ballot measures in Maryland. With the 2015 staffing moves, the PAC ostensibly became a vehicle for O'Malley&nbsp;– who had for several months openly contemplated a presidential bid&nbsp;– to lay the groundwork for a potential campaign for the party's presidential nomination.\nIn August 2015, Lawrence Lessig unexpectedly announced his intention to enter the race, promising to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by Labor Day. After accomplishing this, Lessig formally announced his campaign. He described his candidacy as a referendum on electoral reform legislation, prioritizing a single issue: the Citizen Equality Act of 2017, a proposal that couples campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing gerrymandering and ensuring voting access.\nOverview\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; margin:11px\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#0047ab;\"|\n| Nominee\n|-\n| style=\"background:#007fcc;\"|\n| Ended campaigns\n|-\n| style=\"background:#007f33;\"|\n| Iowa Caucuses\n|-\n| style=\"background:red\"|\n| Super Tuesday\n|-\n| style=\"background:orange\"|\n| D.C.

Clinton collected 700.47 state delegate equivalents to Sanders' 696.92, a difference of one-quarter of a percentage point. This led to speculation that she won due to six coin-toss tiebreakers all resulting in her favor. However, the only challenge to the caucus' results was in a single precinct, which gave Clinton a fifth delegate.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

Martin O'Malley suspended his campaign after a disappointing third-place finish with only 0.5% of the state delegate equivalents awarded, leaving Clinton and Sanders the only two major candidates in the race. A week later, Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, receiving 60.4% of the popular vote to Clinton's 38%, putting him ahead of Clinton in the overall pledged delegate count by four, and making him the first Jewish candidate of a major party to win a primary. Hillary Clinton's loss in New Hampshire was a regression from 2008, when she defeated Obama, Edwards, and a handful of other candidates including Joe Biden, with 39% of the popular vote.\n]]\nSanders' narrow loss in Iowa and victory in New Hampshire generated speculation about a possible loss for Clinton in Nevada, the next state to hold its caucuses on February 20. For her part, Clinton, who had won the state eight years prior in the 2008 Nevada Democratic caucuses, hoped that a victory would allay concerns about a possible repetition of 2008 when she ultimately lost to Obama despite entering the primary season as the favorite for the nomination. Ultimately, Clinton emerged victorious with 52.6% of the county delegates, a margin of victory similar to her performance in 2008. Sanders, who attained 47.3% of the vote, was projected to receive five fewer pledged delegates than Clinton. The result was not promising for the following weekend's primary in South Carolina, more demographically favorable to Clinton than the prior contests. On February 27, Clinton won the South Carolina primary with 73.5% of the vote, receiving a larger percentage of the African American vote than Barack Obama had eight years earlier – 90% to Obama's 80%.\nMarch 1, 2016: Super Tuesday\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|+Super Tuesday\n|-\n!

During that election cycle, many states moved their primaries or caucuses to earlier in the calendar to have greater influence over the race. In 2008, February 5 was the earliest date allowed by the Democratic National Committee, leading 23 states and territories to move their elections to that date, the biggest Super Tuesday to ever take place. For 2016, the calendar was more disparate than it was in 2008, with several groups of states voting on different dates, the most important being March 1, March 15, April 26 and June 7. The day with the most contests was March 1, 2016, in which primaries or caucuses were held in 11 states, including six in the American south, and American Samoa. A total of 865 pledged delegates were at stake.\nClinton secured victories in all of the southern contests except Oklahoma. Her biggest victory of the day came in Alabama, where she won 77.8% of the vote against Sanders' 19.2%. Her most significant delegate prize came from Texas, where she received 65.2% of the vote with strong support from non-white as well as white voters. Collectively, the southern states gave Clinton a net gain of 165 pledged delegates. Apart from the South, Clinton also narrowly defeated Sanders in Massachusetts, as well as winning in the territory of American Samoa.\nSanders scored comfortable wins in the Minnesota and Colorado caucuses and the Oklahoma primary. He won an 86.1%–13.6% landslide in his home state of Vermont – one of only two times either of the two main candidates missed the 15% threshold in a state or territory, with the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Clinton received over 87% of the vote, being the other one. Although the results overall were unfavorable for Sanders, his four wins and narrow loss allowed him to remain in the race in anticipation of more favorable territory in New England, the Great Plains, Mountain States and the Pacific Northwest. At the end of the day, Clinton collected 518 pledged delegates to Sanders' 347, taking her lead to 609–412, a difference of 197 pledged delegates.\nMid-March contests\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|+Mid-March contests\n|-\n!

Clinton answered with an even larger win in Louisiana's primary, limiting Sanders' net gain for the weekend to only four delegates. Clinton would also win the Northern Mariana Islands caucus, held the following weekend on March 12. Two states had held nominating contests on March 8 – Michigan and Mississippi – with Clinton heavily favored to win both.\nMississippi went for Clinton, as expected, by a landslide margin. The Mississippi primary was the highest vote share Clinton won in any state. However, Sanders stunned by scoring a narrow win in Michigan. Analysts floated a number of theories to explain the failure of the Michigan polling, with most centering on pollsters' erroneous assumptions about the composition of the electorate stemming from the 2008 primary in Michigan not having been contested due to an impasse between the state party and DNC.\nAlthough Clinton expanded her delegate lead, some journalists suggested Sanders' upset might presage her defeat in other delegate-rich Midwestern states, such as Missouri, Ohio and Illinois, who voted a week later on March 15, along with North Carolina and Florida, where Clinton was more clearly favored. Clinton was able to sweep all five primaries, extending her pledged delegate lead by around 100 delegates, although Sanders was able to hold Clinton to narrow margins in her birth-state of Illinois and especially Missouri, where Clinton won by a mere 0.2 points.\nMissouri state law allowed for a possible recount had any of the candidates requested it; however, Sanders forwent the opportunity on the basis that it would not significantly affect the delegate allocation. By the end of the evening, Clinton had expanded her pledged delegate lead to more than 320, several times larger than her greatest deficit in the 2008 primary.\nLate March and early April\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|+Late March / Early April contests\n|-\n!

On March 21, the results of the Democrats Abroad primary (held March 1–8) were announced. Sanders was victorious and picked up nine delegates to Clinton's four, closing his delegate deficit by five. Arizona, Idaho and Utah held primaries on March 22, dubbed \"Western Tuesday\" by media. Despite continued efforts by Sanders to close the gap in Arizona after his surprise win in Michigan, Clinton won the primary with 56.3% of the vote. However, Clinton lost both Idaho and Utah by roughly 60 points, allowing Sanders to close his delegate deficit by 25.\n, Washington, March 2016]]\nThe next states to vote were Alaska, Hawaii and Washington on March 26, 2016. All three states were considered as favorable for Sanders, and most political analysts expected him to win them all, given the demographics and Sanders' strong performance in previous caucuses. Sanders finished the day with a net gain of roughly 66 delegates over Clinton. His largest win was in Alaska, where he defeated Clinton with 82% of the vote, although the majority of his delegate gain came from the considerably more populous state of Washington, which he won by a 46% margin, outperforming then-Senator Obama's 2008 results, when he defeated Clinton 68%–31%.\nThe Clinton and Sanders campaigns reached an agreement on April 4 for a ninth debate to take place on April 14 (five days before the New York primary) in Brooklyn, New York, which would air on CNN and NY1. On April 5, Sanders won the Wisconsin primary by 13 and 1/2 percentage points, closing his delegate deficit by 10 more. The Wyoming caucuses were held on April 9, which Sanders won with 55.7% of the state convention delegates choosing him; however, Clinton had a stronger showing than expected, given her demographic disadvantage and that she did not campaign personally in the state. Each candidate was estimated to have earned 7 of Wyoming's 14 pledged delegates.\nLate April and May\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|+Late April and May\n|-\n!

While Sanders performed well in Upstate New York and with younger voters, Clinton performed well among all other age groups and non-whites, and she won a majority in all boroughs of New York City.\nFive Northeastern states held primaries a week later on April 26. The day was dubbed the \"Super Tuesday III\" or the \"Acela Primary\" after Amtrak's Acela Express train service that connects these states. Clinton won in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Sanders won the Rhode Island primary.\nOn May 3, Sanders pulled off a surprise victory in the Indiana primary, winning by a five-point margin despite trailing in all the state's polls. Clinton won the Guam caucus on May 7 and, on May 10, she won the non-binding Nebraska primary while Sanders won in West Virginia.\nClinton narrowly won Kentucky on May 17 by half a percentage point and gained one delegate, after heavily campaigning in the state. On the same day, Sanders won his second closed primary in Oregon, gaining nine delegates, a net gain of eight on the day. Clinton won the non-binding Washington primary on May 24.\nJune contests\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|+June contests\n|-\n!

Clinton led the polls in California but some predicted a narrow race. On June 4 and 5, Clinton won two decisive victories in the Virgin Islands caucus and Puerto Rico primary. On June 6, both the Associated Press and NBC News reported that Clinton had sufficient support from pledged and unpledged delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.\nClinton's campaign seemed reluctant to accept the mantle of \"presumptive nominee\" before all the voting was concluded, while Sanders' campaign stated it would continue to run and accused the media of a \"rush to judgement.\" Six states held their primaries on June 7. Clinton won in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. Sanders won Montana and North Dakota, the latter being the only caucus contest held on that day. Clinton finally declared victory on the evening of June 7, as the results ensured that she had won a majority of the pledged delegates and the popular vote.\nSanders stated he would continue to run for the Democratic Party's nomination in the final primary in the District of Columbia on June 14, which Clinton won. Both campaigns met at a downtown Washington D.C. hotel after the primary. The Sanders campaign said that they would release a video statement on June 16 to clarify the future of Sanders' campaign; the video announced that Sanders looked forward to help Clinton defeat Trump. On July 12, 2016, Sanders endorsed Clinton in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\nJuly 2016: National Convention and email leaks\nEmail leaks\nOn July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released online tens of thousands of messages leaked from the e-mail accounts of seven key DNC staff. Some e-mails showed two DNC staffers discussing the possibility that Sanders' possible atheism might harm him in a general election with religious voters. Others showed a few staffers had expressed personal preferences that Clinton should become the nominee, suggesting that the party's leadership had worked to undermine Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Then-DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the accusations lies.\nThe furor raised over this matter escalated to Wasserman Schultz's resignation ahead of the convention, and that of Marshals, Dacey, and Communications Director Luis Miranda afterwards. Following Wasserman Schultz's resignation, then-DNC Vice Chair Donna Brazile took over as interim DNC chairwoman for the convention and remained so until February 2017. In November 2017, Brazile said in her book and related interviews that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had colluded 'unethically' by giving the Clinton campaign control over the DNC's personnel and press releases before the primary in return for funding to eliminate the DNC's remaining debt from 2012 campaign, in addition to using the DNC and state committees to funnel campaign-limitation-exceeding donations to her campaign. Internal memos later surfaced, claiming that these measures were not meant to affect the nominating process despite their timing. At the end of June 2016, it was claimed that \"more money [from the Hillary Victory Fund] will be moved to the state parties in the coming months.\" Brazile later clarified that she claimed the process was 'unethical', but 'not a criminal act'.\nDNC officials including chairman Tom Perez pointed out that the same joint-fundraising agreement had been offered to Sanders and applied only to the general election; however, the Clinton campaign also had a second agreement that granted it additional, unusual oversight over hiring and policy, even though the text of the agreement insisted on the DNC's impartiality and focus on the general election. Brazile later denied that the primary was rigged, because \"no votes were overturned,\" but described herself as \"very upset\" about a DNC–Clinton fundraising agreement. The Washington Post characterized Brazile's eventual argument as: \"Clinton exerted too much power but did win the nomination fairly.\"\nRussian involvement\nAfter the general election, the U.S. intelligence community and the Special Counsel investigation assessed that the leaks were part of a larger interference campaign by the Russian government to cause political instability in the United States and to damage the Hillary Clinton campaign by bolstering the candidacies of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein. The Russian government is alleged to have promoted Sanders beginning in 2015 as a way to weaken or defeat Clinton, who Russian President Vladimir Putin opposed. The influence campaign by the Internet Research Agency targeted Sanders voters through social media and encouraged them to vote for a third-party candidate or abstain from voting. Sanders denounced these efforts and urged his supporters to support Clinton in the general election.\nWhen news of the DNC leak first surfaced in June 2016, the Russian government denied allegations of hacking. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange also stated that the Russian government was not source of the leak. In July 2018, the special counsel indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking and leaking the emails.\nNational Convention\nThe 2016 Democratic National Convention was held from July 25–28 at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, with some events at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The delegates selected the Democratic presidential and vice-presidential nominees and wrote the party platform. A simple majority of 2,383 delegates was needed to win the presidential nomination. While most of the delegates were bound on the first ballot according to the results of the primaries, a progressively larger number of pledged delegates would have become unbound if the nomination required more than one ballot.\nClinton was nominated on the first ballot by acclamation, although all states were allowed to announce how they would have voted under a typical roll call vote. On July 12, 2016, the Vermont delegates had supported Clinton in Sanders' request. Asking for party unity, he dropped out on July 26, 2016, and announced he would return to the Senate as an independent.\nGraphical summary of polling\nCampaign finance\nThis is an overview of the money used in the campaign as it is reported to Federal Election Commission (FEC) and released on April 27, 2016. Outside groups are independent expenditure only committees—also called PACs and SuperPACs. Several such groups normally support each candidate, but the numbers in the table are a total of all of them. This means that a group of committees can be shown as technically insolvent, shown in red, even though it is not the case of all of them. The Campaign Committee's debt is shown in red if the campaign is technically insolvent. The source of all the numbers is OpenSecrets. Some spending totals are not available, due to withdrawals before the FEC deadline.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:12px; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"4\" |Campaign committee (as of April 30)\n! colspan=\"3\" |Outside groups\t(as of May 16)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total spent\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Campaignsuspended\n|-\n!

These delegates directly elect the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. In some states, the party may disregard voters' selection of delegates, or selected delegates may vote for any candidate at the state or national convention (non-binding primary or caucus). In other states, state laws and party rules require the party to select delegates according to votes, and delegates must vote for a particular candidate (binding primary or caucus).\nThere were 4,051 pledged delegates and 714 superdelegates in the 2016 cycle. Under the party's delegate selection rules, the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. is determined using a formula based on three main factors:\n# The proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections (2004, 2008, and 2012)\n# The number of electoral votes each state has in the United States Electoral College.\n# The stage of the primary season when they held their contest. States and territories that held their contests later are given bonus seats.\nA candidate must win 2,383 delegates at the national convention, in order to win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. For the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and for Democrats Abroad, fixed numbers of pledged delegates are allocated. All states and territories then must have used a proportional representation system, where their pledged delegates were awarded proportionally to the election results.\nA candidate must receive at least 15% of the popular vote to win pledged delegates in a state. The current 714 unpledged superdelegates, or \"soft\" delegates, included members of the United States House of Representatives and Senate, state and territorial governors, members of the Democratic National Committee, and other party leaders. Because of possible deaths, resignations, or the results of intervening or special elections, the final number of these superdelegates may be reduced before the convention.\nThe Democratic National Committee imposed rules for states that wished to hold early contests in 2016. No state was permitted to hold a primary or caucus in January. Only Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada were entitled to February contests. Any state that violated these rules were penalized half its pledged delegates and all its superdelegates to the 2016 convention.\nSchedule and results\nThe following are the results of candidates who won at least one state. These candidates were on the ballots for every state, territory and federal district contest. The results of caucuses did not always have attached preference polls and attendance was extremely limited. The unpledged delegate count did not always reflect the latest declared preferences.\nSuperdelegate endorsements\nSuperdelegates are elected officials and members of the Democratic National Committee who vote at the Democratic National Convention for their preferred candidate. Also known as unpledged delegates, they comprise 15% of the convention (712 votes out of 4,763) and they may change their preference at any time. The table below reflects current public endorsements of candidates by superdelegates, as detailed and sourced in the full list above. Because commonly referenced estimates of superdelegate support, including those by CNN and the AP, do not identify individual delegates as supporting a given candidate, their published tallies may differ from the totals computed here.\nClose states\nSource:\nStates where the margin of victory was under 1%:\n#Missouri, 0.25%\n#Iowa, 0.25%\n#Kentucky, 0.42%\nStates where the margin of victory was under 5%:\n#Massachusetts, 1.40%\n#Michigan, 1.42%\n#Illinois, 1.95%\n#South Dakota, 2.06%\n#New Mexico, 3.06%\n#Indiana, 4.92%\nStates where the margin of victory was under 10%:\n#Nevada, 5.28%\n#Connecticut, 5.38%\n#California, 7.03%\n#Montana, 7.40%\nStates where the margin of victory was under 20%:\n#Oklahoma, 10.36%\n#Rhode Island, 11.63%\n#Pennsylvania, 12.08%\n#Ohio, 12.99%\n#Wisconsin, 13.54%\n#Wyoming, 13.64%\n#North Carolina, 13.64%\n#Oregon, 14.18%\n#Nebraska, 14.28%\n#Arizona, 14.90%\n#West Virginia, 15.57%\n#New York, 16.06%\n#Colorado, 18.68%\nMaps\nFile:U.S. States by Vote Distribution, 2016 (Democratic Party).svg|Breakdown of the results in vote distribution, by state\nFile:Democratic Party presidential primaries results by county, 2016.svg|Results of popular vote, by county\nFile:Democratic Party presidential primaries results, 2016 by margin of victory.svg|Results in popular vote margin, by state\nFile:Democratic Party presidential primary results by county by popular vote margin 2.svg|Results in popular vote margin, by county\nFile:Delegation Vote, 2016 (Democratic Party, only pledged delegates).svg|Breakdown of the results in pledged delegates, by state\nFile:Delegation Vote ,2016 (Democratic Party, total delegates).svg|Breakdown of the results in total delegate count, by state\nFile:Democratic Party presidential primaries pledged delegates results, 2016.svg|Results in pledged delegates, by state\nSee also\nRelated\nDemocratic Party articles\n* Results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* Nationwide opinion polling for the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* Statewide opinion polling for the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidates\n* 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates and forums\n* List of Democratic Party presidential primaries\nPresidential primaries\n* 2016 Constitution Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Green Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Libertarian Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries\nNational conventions\n* 2016 Constitution Party National Convention\n* 2016 Democratic National Convention\n* 2016 Green National Convention\n* 2016 Libertarian National Convention\n* 2016 Republican National Convention\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.democraticconventionwatch.com Democratic Convention Watch]\n* [http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/ Green papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html Full Transcript: Democratic Presidential Debate October 14, 2015]\n* [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/3/4/1496004/-Updated-Snapshot-Hillary-Bernie One-page summary on Daily Kos of candidate differences only (many links to sources)]"
