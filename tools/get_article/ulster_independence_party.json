      "text": "# Ulster Independence Party\n\nThe Ulster Independence Party was an Ulster nationalist political party.\nThe group was founded in October 1977 by the supporters of a document issued the previous year, Towards an Independent Ulster.  The group initially claimed the support of the paramilitary Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee, but soon faded from view.\nOne of the party's leading members was John McKeague, who in 1979 became a founder and deputy leader of the Ulster Independence Association.  McKeague was killed by the INLA in 1982, by which point the group appears to have been moribund.\nReferences\n*[http://www.philipjohnston.com/ni/parties.htm Northern Ireland - political parties]\n*[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/uorgan.htm CAIN: Abstracts of Organisations]"
