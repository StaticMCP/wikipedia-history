In July 2019, it peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart.\nBackground\nThe song was first released on February 26, 2019, a month before the release of its respective album, Trauma. It was released within twelve hours of the first single released from the album, \"Bow Down\". A music video accompanied the release, which contained lead singer Brian Burkheiser covered in a black sludge, said to be \"lyrical and visual representation of depression\". It was later debuted in a live setting on March 11, 2019, at the Download Festival.\nThemes and composition\nThematically, the song's lyrics are self-referential to the band's recent struggles with their rising fame, depression, and mental health. After working hard to establish themselves as a band, and succeeding in gaining popularity with their cover of Taylor Swift's \"Blank Space\" and their first album, Lifelines, a doctor diagnosed Burkheiser with polyp on his vocal cords that required surgery. The experience caused him to suffer from depression and almost give up on the band. }}\nBurkheiser states that writing the song was therapeutic, and that it \"given [him] a breath of life that [he] honestly never thought [he] would feel again.\"\nPersonnel\nBand\n* Brian Burkheiser – clean vocals\n* Eric Vanlerberghe – screamed vocals\n* Steve Menoian – lead guitar, bass\n* Dylan Bowman – rhythm guitar\n* Gabe Helguera – drums\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
