Bird\" in 2008, consisting of material recorded in 2000. It contained 4 songs and totaled about 9 minutes. \"Bat Vs. Bird,\" with its more prominent percussion (as opposed to the subdued backbeats of \"The Age of Backwards\") and overall \"full band\" sound, was more of a promise of what was to come from Wild Flag, which is composed of Mary Timony, Carrie Brownstein, Janet Weiss, and Rebecca Cole.\nTrack listing\n# \"The Age of Backwards\"\n# \"Octaves Apart\"\n# \"Number One Fan\"\n# \"Can't Explain\"\nReferences"
