He writes of the importance of wanting to make better decisions and learning how to do so.\nCritical reception\nChristine Sismondo, writing in The Toronto Star, describes the book as highly readable as well as noting the strength of the arguments contained.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://gooselane.com/products/too-dumb-for-democracy Official website]"
