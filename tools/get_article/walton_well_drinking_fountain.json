It is located at the junction of Walton Well Road, Longworth Road, and Southmoor Road, in Walton Manor, north of Jericho, an inner suburb of Oxford.\nThe fountain is on the site of a spring known as Walton Well (aka '''Bruman's or Brumman's Well''') Previously, a stone trough was available before the drinking fountain was erected in 1885 by an Oxford Alderman, William Ward.\nAt the location of the spring, there is now a drinking fountain in the road, with a plaque dated 1885. It was erected by William Ward, who was Mayor of Oxford in 1851 and 1861. The fountain was designed by the Oxford architect Harry Wilkinson Moore and carved in Portland stone using a Neo-Baroque style by McCulloch of London.\nThe fountain is inscribed on a metal commemorative plaque:\nThe fountain was Grade II listed in 1972. As of 2025, the Oxford Preservation Trust plans to restore the fountain, following a successful fundraiser.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
