Mr. Macalester became the trusted adviser of the eminent philanthropist George Peabody, and afterwards a trustee of his magnificent bequest to the cause of education in the Southern States. Mr. Macalester held close personal relations with U.S. Presidents Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, and Abraham Lincoln. From President Jackson, he received the appointment as one of the government directors of the Second Bank of the United States, and was serving in such capacity in 1836, when the charter of the bank expired (source needed).\nIn 1893, it was purchased by Robert H. Foerderer, a U.S. congressman and industrialist, who gave it its present name. He enlarged the house in 1903 in the Edwardian Classical Revival style.  In 1971, the estate was given to the Lutheran Church of America. In 1985, Glen Foerd Conservation Corporation and the Fairmount Park Commission assumed ownership of the property.\nToday, the estate is operated as a historic house museum, whose grounds are a public park.\nGlen Foerd was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nIn 2024, when Philadelphia was featured in the finale of Season 36 of The Amazing Race, Glen  Feord Estate was featured as the season’s finish line.\nSee also\n*List of parks in Philadelphia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
