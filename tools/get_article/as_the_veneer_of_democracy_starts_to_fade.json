Despite a steady beat provided by the Maffia, the album sounds less like dance music than the end of the world. Its a scary mess of random sounds, spoken words, and tiny snippets of music, processed and distorted to a grating, electric edge.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0em 1em 1em 0pt\"\n!Year\n!Publication\n!Country\n!Accolade\n!Rank\n!class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n|align=center|1985    ||Rockerilla    ||Italy\n| \"Albums of the Year\"    ||align=center|18    ||\n|}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Mark Stewart and the Maffia\n*Mark Stewart&nbsp;– vocals, production\n*Keith LeBlanc&nbsp;– drums\n*Skip McDonald&nbsp;– guitar\n*Adrian Sherwood&nbsp;– keyboards, production\n*Doug Wimbish&nbsp;– bass\n;Additional musicians and production\n*Jill Mumford&nbsp;– design\n*Tim Young&nbsp;– mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1985)\n! scope=\"col\" | Peakposition\n|-\n| UK Indie Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
