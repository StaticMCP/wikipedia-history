The division was formed in November 1914 as the Wernitz Division (Division Wernitz), named after its commander General Theodor von Wernitz, and became the 86th Infantry Division in August 1915.   The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nCombat chronicle\nThe 86th Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front.  It occupied the line by Mława from November 1914 to July 1915 and then participated in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive, breaking through at Przasnysz and fighting on the Narew, and then participating in follow-on fighting for the next several months until the line stabilized. In September 1915, under General Theodor von Wernitz (1848–1922), it was in the Lithuanian swamps.  It was engaged in positional warfare in the Vishnev sector on the Berezina, Olshanka and Krevljanka Rivers from September 1915 to March 1916.  It then fought at Lake Narač.
