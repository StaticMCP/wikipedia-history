A team of experts was appointed and a first volume of the MHSI was published in Madrid in 1894.  When the Jesuit Historical Institute was established in Rome (1930) the work was carried on from there.  It could be said that this was also stimulated by the renewal of historical research methods that characterised the end of the 19th century.\nShort survey of published volumes\nWritings of St Ignatius of Loyola\n#Epistolae et Instructiones (Letters and Instructions) : 12 volumes.\n#Exercitia spiritualia (Text of the Spiritual Exercises and its Directories): 2 volumes.\n#Constitutiones et Regulae Soc.
