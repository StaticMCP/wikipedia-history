In its first year, the award specified that a \"chorus\" contains seven or more artists.  This award was presented alongside the award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group.  Before 1961 these awards were combined into the Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group or Chorus.\nAlthough in the \"pop\" field the award did not specify pop music performances.  In 1969 and 1970 a pop-specific award was presented for Best Contemporary Performance by a Chorus.\nYears reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\" | Winner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Work\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nominees\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref.\n|-\n! scope=row|1961\n| (choir director)\n|Songs of the Cowboy\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=row|1962\n|\n|Great Band With Great Voices\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=row|1963\n|\n|Presenting The New Christy Minstrels\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=row|1964\n|\n|''Bach's Greatest Hits\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=row|1965\n|\n|The Swingle Singers Going Baroque\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=row|1966\n| (choir director)\n|Anyone for Mozart?\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=row''|1967\n| (choir director)\n|\"Somewhere My Love (Lara's Theme From Dr. Zhivago)\"\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=row|1968\n|\n|\"Up, Up and Away\"\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nReferences\n;General\n*  Note: User must select the \"Pop\" category as the genre under the search feature.\n;Specific\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grammy.com/ Official site]"
