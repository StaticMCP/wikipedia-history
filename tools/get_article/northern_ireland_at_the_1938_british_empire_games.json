Only four athletes were sent during a time of political change that saw the Irish Free State recently becoming Ireland.\nThe Games were held in Sydney, Australia from 5 to 12 February 1938 and Northern Ireland was unplaced in the medal table, being one of five nations (out of 15) that did not win a medal.\nTeam\nAthletics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=200|Athlete\n!width=300|Events\n!width=300|Club\n!width=300|Notes\n|-\n|Alexander Haire ||880 yards / 1 mile || R.U.C.||\n|-\n|Albert Shillington ||long jump/triple jump ||Willowfield Temperance Harriers, Belfast||\n|-\n|John Clarke ||Pole vault, javelin ||R.U.C. ||\n|}\nLawn Bowls\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=200|Athlete\n!width=300|Events\n!width=300|Club\n!width=300|Notes\n|-\n|W.
