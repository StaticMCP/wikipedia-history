It is a formalisation of Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis. Loosely, the theorem states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving a certain number n of physical variables, then the original equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of p&nbsp;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;k dimensionless parameters 1, 2, ..., p constructed from the original variables, where k is the number of physical dimensions involved; it is obtained as the rank of a particular matrix.\nThe theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from the given variables, or nondimensionalization, even if the form of the equation is still unknown.\nThe Buckingham  theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an identity involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (for example, pressure and volume are linked by Boyle's law – they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and the theorem would not hold.\nHistory\nAlthough named for Edgar Buckingham, the  theorem was first proved by the French mathematician Joseph Bertrand in 1878. Bertrand considered only special cases of problems from electrodynamics and heat conduction, but his article contains, in distinct terms, all the basic ideas of the modern proof of the theorem and clearly indicates the theorem's utility for modelling physical phenomena. The technique of using the theorem (\"the method of dimensions\") became widely known due to the works of Rayleigh. The first application of the  theorem in the general case to the dependence of pressure drop in a pipe upon governing parameters probably dates back to 1892, a heuristic proof with the use of series expansions, to 1894.\nFormal generalization of the  theorem for the case of arbitrarily many quantities was given first by  in 1892, then in 1911—apparently independently—by both A. Federman and D. Riabouchinsky, and again in 1914 by Buckingham. It was Buckingham's article that introduced the use of the symbol \"\\pi_i\" for the dimensionless variables (or parameters), and this is the source of the theorem's name.\nStatement\nMore formally, the number p of dimensionless terms that can be formed is equal to the nullity of the dimensional matrix, and k is the rank. For experimental purposes, different systems that share the same description in terms of these dimensionless numbers are equivalent.\nIn mathematical terms, if we have a physically meaningful equation such as\nf(q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n)=0,\nwhere q_1, \\ldots, q_n are any n physical variables, and there is a maximal dimensionally independent subset of size k,A dimensionally independent set of variables is one for which the only exponents q_1^{a_1} \\, q_2^{a_2} \\cdots q_k^{a_k} yielding a dimensionless quantity are a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = 0. This is precisely the notion of linear independence. then the above equation can be restated as\nF(\\pi_1,\\pi_2,\\ldots,\\pi_p)=0,\nwhere \\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_p are dimensionless parameters constructed from the q_i by p = n - k dimensionless equations — the so-called Pi groups — of the form\n\\pi_i=q_1^{a_1}\\,q_2^{a_2} \\cdots q_n^{a_n},\nwhere the exponents a_i are rational numbers. (They can always be taken to be integers by redefining \\pi_i as being raised to a power that clears all denominators.) If there are \\ell fundamental units in play, then p \\geq n - \\ell.\nSignificance\nThe Buckingham  theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from given variables, even if the form of the equation remains unknown. However, the choice of dimensionless parameters is not unique; Buckingham's theorem only provides a way of generating sets of dimensionless parameters and does not indicate the most \"physically meaningful\".\nTwo systems for which these parameters coincide are called similar (as with similar triangles, they differ only in scale); they are equivalent for the purposes of the equation, and the experimentalist who wants to determine the form of the equation can choose the most convenient one. Most importantly, Buckingham's theorem describes the relation between the number of variables and fundamental dimensions.\nProof\nFor simplicity, it will be assumed that the space of fundamental and derived physical units forms a vector space over the real numbers, with the fundamental units as basis vectors, and with multiplication of physical units as the \"vector addition\" operation, and raising to powers as the \"scalar multiplication\" operation:\nrepresent a dimensional variable as the set of exponents needed for the fundamental units (with a power of zero if the particular fundamental unit is not present). For instance, the standard gravity g has units of \\mathsf{L} / \\mathsf{T}^2 = \\mathsf{L}^1 \\mathsf{T}^{-2} (length over time squared), so it is represented as the vector (1, -2) with respect to the basis of fundamental units (length, time). We could also require that exponents of the fundamental units be rational numbers and modify the proof accordingly, in which case the exponents in the pi groups can always be taken as rational numbers or even integers.\nRescaling units\nSuppose we have quantities q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n, where the units of q_i contain length raised to the power c_i. If we originally measure length in meters but later switch to centimeters, then the numerical value of q_i would be rescaled by a factor of 100^{c_i}. Any physically meaningful law should be invariant under an arbitrary rescaling of every fundamental unit; this is the fact that the pi theorem hinges on.\nFormal proof\nGiven a system of n dimensional variables q_1, \\ldots, q_n in \\ell fundamental (basis) dimensions, the dimensional matrix is the \\ell \\times n matrix M whose \\ell rows correspond to the fundamental dimensions and whose n columns are the dimensions of the variables: the (i, j)th entry (where 1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell and 1 \\leq j \\leq n) is the power of the ith fundamental dimension in the jth variable.\nThe matrix can be interpreted as taking in a combination of the variable quantities and giving out the dimensions of the combination in terms of the fundamental dimensions. So the \\ell \\times 1 (column) vector that results from the multiplication\nM\\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n\\end{bmatrix}\nconsists of the units of\nq_1^{a_1}\\,q_2^{a_2}\\cdots q_n^{a_n}\nin terms of the \\ell fundamental independent (basis) units.\nIf we rescale the ith fundamental unit by a factor of \\alpha_i, then q_j gets rescaled by \\alpha_1^{-m_{1j}}\\, \\alpha_2^{-m_{2j}} \\cdots \\alpha_\\ell^{-m_{\\ell j}}, where m_{ij} is the (i, j)th entry of the dimensional matrix. In order to convert this into a linear algebra problem, we take logarithms (the base is irrelevant), yielding \\begin{bmatrix} \\log{q_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\log{q_n} \\end{bmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{bmatrix} \\log{q_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\log{q_n} \\end{bmatrix} - M^\\operatorname{T} \\begin{bmatrix} \\log{\\alpha_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\log{\\alpha_\\ell} \\end{bmatrix}, which is an action of \\mathbb{R}^\\ell on \\mathbb{R}^n. We define a physical law to be an arbitrary function f \\colon (\\mathbb{R}^+)^n \\to \\mathbb{R} such that (q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n) is a permissible set of values for the physical system when f(q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n) = 0. We further require f to be invariant under this action. Hence it descends to a function F \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n / \\operatorname{im}{M^\\operatorname{T}} \\to \\mathbb{R}. All that remains is to exhibit an isomorphism between \\mathbb{R}^n/\\operatorname{im}{M^\\operatorname{T}} and \\mathbb{R}^p, the (log) space of pi groups (\\log{\\pi_1}, \\log{\\pi_2}, \\dots, \\log{\\pi_p}).\nWe construct an n \\times p matrix K whose columns are a basis for \\ker{M}. It tells us how to embed \\mathbb{R}^p into \\mathbb{R}^n as the kernel of M. That is, we have an exact sequence\n: 0 \\to \\mathbb{R}^p \\xrightarrow{\\ K \\ } \\mathbb{R}^n \\xrightarrow{\\ M\\ } \\mathbb{R}^\\ell.\nTaking tranposes yields another exact sequence\n:\\mathbb{R}^\\ell \\xrightarrow{\\ M^\\operatorname{T}\\ } \\mathbb{R}^n \\xrightarrow{\\ K^\\operatorname{T}\\ } \\mathbb{R}^p \\to 0.\nThe first isomorphism theorem produces the desired isomorphism, which sends the coset v + M^\\operatorname{T} \\mathbb{R}^\\ell to K^\\operatorname{T} v. This corresponds to rewriting the tuple (\\log q_1, \\log q_2, \\dots, \\log q_n) into the pi groups (\\log\\pi_1, \\log\\pi_2, \\dots, \\log\\pi_p) coming from the columns of K.\nThe International System of Units defines seven base units, which are the ampere, kelvin, second, metre, kilogram, candela and mole. It is sometimes advantageous to introduce additional base units and techniques to refine the technique of dimensional analysis. (See orientational analysis and reference.)\nExamples\nSpeed\nThis example is elementary but serves to demonstrate the procedure.\nSuppose a car is driving at 100&nbsp;km/h; how long does it take to go 200&nbsp;km?\nThis question considers n = 3 dimensioned variables: distance d, time t, and speed v, and we are seeking some law of the form t = \\operatorname{Duration}(v, d). Any two of these variables are dimensionally independent, but the three taken together are not. Thus there is p = n - k = 3 - 2 = 1 dimensionless quantity.\nThe dimensional matrix is\nM = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & \\;\\;\\;1\\\\\n0 & 1 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\nin which the rows correspond to the basis dimensions L and T, and the columns to the considered dimensions L, T, \\text{ and } V, where the latter stands for the speed dimension. The elements of the matrix correspond to the powers to which the respective dimensions are to be raised. For instance, the third column (1, -1), states that V = L^0 T^0 V^1, represented by the column vector \\mathbf{v}=[0,0,1], is expressible in terms of the basis dimensions as V = L^1 T^{-1} = L/T, since M\\mathbf{v} = [1,-1].\nFor a dimensionless constant \\pi=L^{a_1}T^{a_2}V^{a_3}, we are looking for vectors \\mathbf{a}=[a_1,a_2,a_3] such that the matrix-vector product M \\mathbf{a} equals the zero vector [0, 0]. In linear algebra, the set of vectors with this property is known as the kernel (or nullspace) of the dimensional matrix. In this particular case its kernel is one-dimensional. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a non-zero kernel vector to within a multiplicative constant:\n\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1\\\\ \\;\\;\\;1\\\\ \\;\\;\\;1\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}.\nIf the dimensional matrix were not already reduced, one could perform Gauss–Jordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant, replacing the dimensions by the corresponding dimensioned variables, may be written:\n\\pi = d^{-1}t^1v^1 = tv/d.\nSince the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, the above dimensionless constant raised to any arbitrary power yields another (equivalent) dimensionless constant.\nDimensional analysis has thus provided a general equation relating the three physical variables:\nF(\\pi)=0,\nor, letting C denote a zero of function F,\n\\pi=C,\nwhich can be written in the desired form (which recall was t = \\operatorname{Duration}(v, d)) as\nt = C\\frac{d}{v}.\nThe actual relationship between the three variables is simply d = vt. In other words, in this case F has one physically relevant root, and it is unity. The fact that only a single value of C will do and that it is equal to 1 is not revealed by the technique of dimensional analysis.\nThe simple pendulum\nWe wish to determine the period T of small oscillations in a simple pendulum. It will be assumed that it is a function of the length L, the mass M, and the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth g, which has dimensions of length divided by time squared. The model is of the form\nf(T,M,L,g) = 0.\n(Note that it is written as a relation, not as a function: T is not written here as a function of M, L, \\text{ and } g.)\nPeriod, mass, and length are dimensionally independent, but acceleration can be expressed in terms of time and length, which means the four variables taken together are not dimensionally independent. Thus we need only p = n - k = 4 - 3 = 1 dimensionless parameter, denoted by \\pi, and the model can be re-expressed as\nF(\\pi) = 0,\nwhere \\pi is given by\n\\pi = T^{a_1}M^{a_2}L^{a_3}g^{a_4}\nfor some values of a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4.\nThe dimensions of the dimensional quantities are:\nT = t, M = m, L = \\ell, g = \\ell/t^2.\nThe dimensional matrix is:\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & -2\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 &  0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 &  1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n(The rows correspond to the dimensions t, m, and \\ell, and the columns to the dimensional variables T, M, L, \\text{ and } g. For instance, the 4th column, (-2, 0, 1), states that the g variable has dimensions of t^{-2}m^0 \\ell^1.)\nWe are looking for a kernel vector a = \\left[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\right] such that the matrix product of \\mathbf{M} on a yields the zero vector [0,0,0]. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a kernel vector within a multiplicative constant:\na = \\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}.\nWere it not already reduced, one could perform Gauss–Jordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant may be written:\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi &= T^2M^0L^{-1}g^1\\\\\n&= gT^2/L\n\\end{align}.\nIn fundamental terms:\n\\pi = (t)^2 (m)^0 (\\ell)^{-1} \\left(\\ell/t^2\\right)^1 = 1,\nwhich is dimensionless. Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, if the above dimensionless constant is raised to any arbitrary power, it will yield another equivalent dimensionless constant.\nIn this example, three of the four dimensional quantities are fundamental units, so the last (which is g) must be a combination of the previous.\nNote that if a_2 (the coefficient of M) had been non-zero then there would be no way to cancel the M value; therefore a_2  be zero. Dimensional analysis has allowed us to conclude that the period of the pendulum is not a function of its mass M. (In the 3D space of powers of mass, time, and distance, we can say that the vector for mass is linearly independent from the vectors for the three other variables. Up to a scaling factor, \\vec g + 2 \\vec T - \\vec L is the only nontrivial way to construct a vector of a dimensionless parameter.)\nThe model can now be expressed as:\nF\\left(gT^2/L\\right) = 0.\nThen this implies that gT^2/L = C_i for some zero C_i of the function F. If there is only one zero, call it C, then gT^2/L = C. It requires more physical insight or an experiment to show that there is indeed only one zero and that the constant is in fact given by C = 4\\pi^2.\nFor large oscillations of a pendulum, the analysis is complicated by an additional dimensionless parameter, the maximum swing angle. The above analysis is a good approximation as the angle approaches zero.\nElectric power\nTo demonstrate the application of the  theorem, consider the power consumption of a stirrer with a given shape.\nThe power, P, in dimensions [M · L2/T3], is a function of the density, ρ [M/L3], and the viscosity of the fluid to be stirred, μ [M/(L · T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its diameter, D [L], and the angular speed of the stirrer, n [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of n = 5 variables representing our example.  Those n = 5 variables are built up from k = 3 independent dimensions, e.g., length: L (SI units: m), time: T (s), and mass: M (kg).\nAccording to the -theorem, the n = 5 variables can be reduced by the k = 3 dimensions to form p = n − k = 5 − 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. Usually, these quantities are chosen as \\mathrm{Re} = {\\frac{\\rho n D^2}{\\mu}}, commonly named the Reynolds number which describes the fluid flow regime, and N_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{P}{\\rho n^3 D^5}, the power number, which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.\nNote that the two dimensionless quantities are not unique and depend on which of the n = 5 variables are chosen as the k = 3 dimensionally independent basis variables, which, in this example, appear in both dimensionless quantities. The Reynolds number and power number fall from the above analysis if \\rho, n, and D are chosen to be the basis variables. If, instead, \\mu, n, and D are selected, the Reynolds number is recovered while the second dimensionless quantity becomes N_\\mathrm{Rep} = \\frac{P}{\\mu D^3 n^2}. We note that N_\\mathrm{Rep} is the product of the Reynolds number and the power number.\nOther examples\nAn example of dimensional analysis can be found for the case of the mechanics of a thin, solid and parallel-sided rotating disc.  There are five variables involved which reduce to two non-dimensional groups. The relationship between these can be determined by numerical experiment using, for example, the finite element method.\nThe theorem has also been used in fields other than physics, for instance in sports science.\nSee also\n* Blast wave\n* Dimensionless quantity\n* Natural units\n* Similitude (model)\n* Reynolds number\nReferences\nNotes\n{{reflist|group=note|refs=\nIf these basis units are b_1, \\ldots, b_\\ell and if the units of q_j = m_{1j} b_1 + \\cdots + m_{\\ell j} b_\\ell for every 1 \\leq j \\leq n, then\nM = \\begin{bmatrix}\nm_{11} & \\cdots & m_{1j} & \\cdots & m_{1n} \\\\\n\\vdots &        & \\vdots &        & \\vdots \\\\\nm_{\\ell 1} & \\cdots & m_{\\ell j} & \\cdots & m_{\\ell n} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\nso that, for instance, the units of q_1 in terms of these basis units are\nM \\left(\\left[1 \\ 0 \\ \\cdots \\ 0\\right]^{\\operatorname{T}}\\right) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nm_{11} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nm_{\\ell 1} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\nFor a concrete example, suppose that the \\ell = 2 fundamental units are meters b_1 = m and seconds b_2 = s, and that there are n = 3 dimensional variables: q_1 = m/s^2, q_2 = 1/m, q_3 = s / m. By definition of vector addition and scalar multiplication of units,\nq_1 = ms^{-2} = 1 m + (-2) s,\\quad q_2 = m^{-1} = (-1) m + 0 s,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad q_3 = m^{-1} s = (-1) m + 1 s,\nso that\nM = \\begin{bmatrix}\nm_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} \\\\\nm_{21} & m_{22} & m_{23} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1  & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-2 & 0  & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\nBy definition, the dimensionless variables are those whose units are m^0 s^0, which are exactly the vectors in\n\\ker M = \\operatorname{span} \\left\\{ [1, -1, 2]^{\\operatorname{T}} \\right\\} = \\left\\{ \\left(q_1 - q_2 + 2 q_3\\right)^s : s \\in \\Q \\right\\}.\nThis can be verified by a direct computation:\nq_1 - q_2 + 2 q_3 = \\left(m s^{-2}\\right)^1 + \\left(m^{-1}\\right)^{-1} + \\left(s m^{-1}\\right)^2 = m^1 s^{-2} + m^1 + m^{-2} s^2 = m^{1+1+(-2)} s^{-2 + 0 + 2} = m^0 s^0,\nwhich is indeed dimensionless.\nConsequently, if some physical law states that q_1, q_2, q_3 are necessarily related by a (presumably unknown) equation of the form f\\left(q_1, q_2, q_3\\right) = 0 for some (unknown) function f with \\operatorname{domain}(f) \\subseteq \\R^3 (that is, the tuple \\left(q_1, q_2, q_3\\right) is necessarily a zero of f), then there exists some (also unknown) function F : \\R^1 \\to \\R that depends on only p = 3 - 2 = 1 variable, the dimensionless variable \\pi_1 := q_1 - q_2 + 2 q_3 = q_1 q_3^2 / q_2 (or any non-zero rational power \\hat{\\pi}_1 := \\pi_1^s of \\pi_1, where 0 \\neq s \\in \\Q), such that F\\left(\\pi_1\\right) = 0 holds (if \\hat{\\pi}_1 := \\pi_1^s is used instead of \\pi_1 then F can be replaced with \\hat{F}(x) := F\\left(x^{1/s}\\right) and once again \\hat{F}\\left(\\hat{\\pi}_1\\right) = 0 holds).\nThus in terms of the original variables, F\\left(q_1 q_3^2 / q_2\\right) = 0 must hold (alternatively, if using \\hat{\\pi}_1 := \\pi_1^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\pi_1} for instance, then \\hat{F}\\left(\\sqrt{q_1 q_3^2 / q_2}\\right) = 0 must hold).\nIn other words, the Buckingham  theorem implies that q_1 q_3^2 / q_2 \\in F^{-1}(0), so that if it happens to be the case that this F has exactly one zero, call it C, then the equation q_1 q_3^2 / q_2 = C will necessarily hold (the theorem does not give information about what the exact value of the constant C will be, nor does it guarantee that F has exactly one zero).\n}}\nCitations\nBibliography\n*  |title=Hydrodynamics |publisher=Princeton University Press |orig-year=1960 |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-4008-7777-5 |pages=93– |edition=2nd}}\n*\n*\n* |chapter=2.
