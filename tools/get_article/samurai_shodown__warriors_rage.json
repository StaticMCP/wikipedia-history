This generated considerable confusion, and led many to the assumption that it was a port of the second Hyper Neo Geo 64 game. It was also released in relatively limited numbers outside Japan, as the gaming market was gearing up for the release of the PlayStation 2. This meant that few people had actually seen either game, therefore the title was the factor they were aware of.  Even a cursory comparison between the two games reveals that they are two very different entities. To help eliminate confusion, Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage is now frequently referred to in English-speaking circles as Warriors Rage 2, or SSWR2 for short.\nReception\n| EGM = 2/10\n| GSpot = 3.7/10|\n| IGN = 6/10\n}}\nThe game received mixed to negative reception.\nExternal links\n*Official websites in [http://www.personal.triticom.com/~erm/www.neogeo.co.jp/samurai/english/e-top.html English]  and [http://www.personal.triticom.com/~erm/www.neogeo.co.jp/samurai/soukou/top.html Japanese]\nReferences"
