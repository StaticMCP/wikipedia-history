She explains that due to a power plant meltdown the year before, there are over sixty radioactive walkers in the area. Simply getting close to the walkers risks survivors becoming contaminated, causing Morgan to permanently lose his contaminated staff. As the former manager of the plant, Grace blames herself for the deaths of her friends and is on a mission to find and eliminate the radioactive walkers, herself terminally ill with radiation sickness. John and June locate the campground where the children possibly came from, only to discover that the residents succumbed to radiation sickness. Grace sets out on her own to hunt down the rest, promising to keep in touch. At the same time, Victor tracks down Daniel, who helps him make contact with Luciana. Though convinced of the problem, Daniel refuses to lend his plane to Victor who he feels will only make things worse based on past experiences. After passing out following a walker attack, Luciana wakes up to discover that someone has cut off walker heads and strung them from a billboard at the truck stop, causing the group to become convinced that they are getting close to something someone does not want them to see.\n| LineColor       = 19A7A9\n}}\n| Viewers         = 1.76\n| ShortSummary    = The group begins plotting out the locations of the walker roadblocks while Alicia begins searching for Max's family after hearing a message by them over the radio.

Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg have been the showrunners since the fourth season.\nCasting\nIn December 2018, it was reported that Rubén Blades would return in the fifth season as Daniel Salazar. It was also reported that Daniel Sharman would return as Troy Otto, however, in April 2019, showrunner Ian Goldberg confirmed he would not return, stating \"Yes, that's just a rumor. We thought he was awesome on the show, but he's not returning.\" In January 2019, it was reported that Austin Amelio would join the cast as Dwight, who last appeared in the eighth season of The Walking Dead. Alexa Nisenson was promoted to the main cast after recurring in the fourth season as Charlie. In March 2019, it was reported that Karen David had been added to the main cast as Grace.\nFilming\nFilming for the fifth season began in December 2018 in New Braunfels, Texas. It was reported that Sarah Wayne Callies, who played Lori Grimes on its companion series The Walking Dead, would direct an episode of the season, however, she was not able to due to scheduling conflicts.\nReception\nCritical response\nThe fifth season received mixed reviews from critics and generally negative reviews from audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a rating of 55% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Despite delivering some memorable and splatter-filled zombie set-pieces that fans crave, Fear the Walking Dead feels stiff with early-onset rigor mortis in a fifth season that emphasizes altruism over coherent characterization.\"\nFan response\nFollowing the airing of the season's penultimate episode, a Change.org petition had attracted media attention. Drawing comparisons to a petition to rewrite the last season of Game of Thrones a few months prior, the petition was to fire current showrunners Ian Goldberg and Andrew Chambliss. Chambliss responded to the negative fan reaction by saying, \"You know, we told the story that we believe in and we're proud of what we did and in terms of going forward, the show is changing and that's always been part of the plan. You know, it changes every season and every half season and we're very excited about the direction it's going and a lot of the tough challenges that our characters ahead are going to be facing.\"\nRatings\n| title2   = The Hurt That Will Happen\n| date2    = June 9, 2019\n| rs2      = 0.5\n| viewers2 = 1.69\n| dvr2     = 0.4\n| dvrv2    = 1.13\n| total2   = 0.9\n| totalv2  = 2.82\n| title3   = Humbug's Gulch\n| date3    = June 16, 2019\n| rs3      = 0.5\n| viewers3 = 1.76\n| dvr3     = 0.4\n| dvrv3    = 1.11\n| total3   = 0.9\n| totalv3  = 2.87\n| title4   = Skidmark\n| date4    = June 23, 2019\n| rs4      = 0.5\n| viewers4 = 1.66\n| dvr4     = 0.4\n| dvrv4    = 1.23\n| total4   = 0.9\n| totalv4  = 2.89\n| title5   = The End of Everything\n| date5    = June 30, 2019\n| rs5      = 0.5\n| viewers5 = 1.71\n| dvr5     = 0.3\n| dvrv5    = 1.07\n| total5   = 0.8\n| totalv5  = 2.78\n| title6   = The Little Prince\n| date6    = July 7, 2019\n| rs6      = 0.4\n| viewers6 = 1.49\n| dvr6     = 0.4\n| dvrv6    = 1.13\n| total6   = 0.8\n| totalv6  = 2.62\n| title7   = Still Standing\n| date7    = July 14, 2019\n| rs7      = 0.3\n| viewers7 = 1.39\n| dvr7     = 0.4\n| dvrv7    = 1.07\n| total7   = 0.7\n| totalv7  = 2.47\n| title8   = Is Anybody Out There?\n| date8    = July 21, 2019\n| rs8      = 0.5\n| viewers8 = 1.60\n| dvr8     = 0.3\n| dvrv8    = 1.04\n| total8   = 0.8\n| totalv8  = 2.64\n| title9   = Channel 4\n| date9    = August 11, 2019\n| rs9      = 0.4\n| viewers9 = 1.40\n| dvr9     = 0.3\n| dvrv9    = 1.06\n| total9   = 0.7\n| totalv9  = 2.46\n| title10   = 210 Words Per Minute\n| date10    = August 18, 2019\n| rs10      = 0.4\n| viewers10 = 1.37\n| dvr10     = 0.4\n| dvrv10    = 1.14\n| total10   = 0.8\n| totalv10  = 2.51\n| title11   = You're Still Here\n| date11    = August 25, 2019\n| rs11      = 0.4\n| viewers11 = 1.44\n| dvr11     = 0.2\n| dvrv11    = 0.74\n| total11   = 0.6\n| totalv11  = 2.17\n| title12   = Ner Tamid\n| date12    = September 1, 2019\n| rs12      = 0.3\n| viewers12 = 1.14\n| dvr12     = 0.3\n| dvrv12    = 0.96\n| total12   = 0.6\n| totalv12  = 2.10\n| title13   = Leave What You Don't\n| date13    = September 8, 2019\n| rs13      = 0.4\n| viewers13 = 1.45\n| dvr13     = 0.3\n| dvrv13    = 0.75\n| total13   = 0.7\n| totalv13  = 2.19\n| title14   = Today and Tomorrow\n| date14    = September 15, 2019\n| rs14      = 0.3\n| viewers14 = 1.31\n| dvr14     = 0.3\n| dvrv14    = 0.82\n| total14   = 0.6\n| totalv14  = 2.13\n| title15   = Channel 5\n| date15    = September 22, 2019\n| rs15      = 0.4\n| viewers15 = 1.34\n| dvr15     = 0.3\n| dvrv15    = 0.78\n| total15   = 0.6\n| totalv15  = 2.12\n| title16   = End of the Line\n| date16    = September 29, 2019\n| rs16      = 0.4\n| viewers16 = 1.51\n| dvr16     = 0.4\n| dvrv16    = 1.19\n| total16   = 0.8\n| totalv16  = 2.70\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
