It was founded in the early 1990s with a conservative ideology.\nHistory\nFounding and early history\nThe party was named the Mongolian Bourgeois Party (, Mongolyn Khurungutniy Nam МХН) until April 1997. It was also formerly known as the Mongolian Republican Party (, Mongolyn Bügd Nairamdakh Nam МБНН) for the 2000 parliamentary election.\nMerger\nIn February 2002, the Civil Will Party and the Republican Party merged together as the \"Civil Will–Republican Party\". This merge was short-lived and the two parties broke up before the 2004 election.\nRecent history\nThe Republican Party was re-registered as an official political party in April 2004 by the Supreme Court and the Civil Will Party changed back to its original name in January 2006. The party would win its first and only seat in the State Great Khural in the 2004 election.\nBecause the party had representation in the State Great Khural, it was eligible to nominate a candidate for the 2005 presidential election. Party chairman and member of parliament Bazarsadyn Jargalsaikhan was nominated in a four-way race and received 13.83% of the total vote. Since 2008, the party has remained a minor extra-parliamentary party, sometimes considered by the public as a \"one man party\".\nElectoral history\nPresidential election\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n|2005\n|Bazarsadyn Jargalsaikhan\n|128,784\n|13.83%\n|Lost\n|}\nState Great Khural elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Government\n|-\n|1996\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Bazarsadyn Jargalsaikhan\n|17,581\n|1.74%\n|}}\n|New\n|6th\n|\n|-\n|2000\n|41,991\n|4.19%\n|}}\n| 0\n| 5rd\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|14,367\n|1.39%\n|}}\n| 1\n| 3rd\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|24,806\n|1.43%\n|}}\n| 1\n| 4th\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|16,656\n|1.47%\n|}}\n| 0\n| 5th\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|23,118\n|1.64%\n|}}\n| 0\n| 5th\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|213,812\n|5.35%\n|}}\n| 0\n| 4th\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|19,635\n|1.35%\n|}}\n| 0\n| 9th\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080918231505/http://www.bnn.mn/ Official website] (in Mongolian)"
