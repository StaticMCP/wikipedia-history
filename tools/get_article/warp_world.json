      "text": "# Warp World\n\nWarp World is a 1991 role-playing game published by Blacksburg Tactical Research Center.\nSetting\nWarp World is set on Earth, 300 years after World War III, which allowed the old gods and creatures of myth to return.  The setting is a combination of post-apocalyptic science fiction and fantasy.\nHistory\nWarp World was designed by Greg Porter, and published by Blacksburg Tactical Research Center in 1991 as a 208-page softcover book.\nIn 2003, the game was redone as a setting under BTRC's EABA universal game system.\nReception\nJim Foster reviewed Warp World in White Wolf #29 (Oct./Nov., 1991), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that \"My overall impression of Warp World is that of a good framework of systems and general background material with which an enterprising GM could make an exciting campaign. It will require some work and a bit of experience, however; this game is not for beginners or anyone else expecting a sourcebook of prefab campaigns and ready-to-play adventures. What it does offer is a very playable and realistic set of systems that govern 'reality' and fantasy with equal ease.\"\nReviews\n*Voyages to the Worlds of SF Gaming (Issue 17 - Oct 1992)\n*The Last Province (Issue 1 - Oct 1992)\n*Magister (Issue 36 - Sep 1992)\nReferences"
