In the , Advancetown had a population of 528 people.\nGeography\nAdvancetown is situated in the Gold Coast hinterland. Its mountainous terrain facilitated the construction of the Hinze Dam () which impounds the Nerang River () and Little Nerang Creek () to create Advancetown Lake (). The lake is the dominant feature in the south of the locality; it supplies water for most of the Gold Coast.\nTwo named peaks within the locality are:\n* Mudgeeraba in the south-east of the locality () at  above sea level\n* Pages Pinnacle in the south () at  above\nThe northern part of the locality, downstream from the dam, is lower and flatter and has mixed use with rural residential areas and rural areas (mostly grazing on native vegetation). One landmark in this area is Latimers Crossing, a crossing point of the Nerang River between Advancetown and Gilston ().\nNerang–Murwillumbah Road (State Route 97) runs through from north to south.\nHistory\nThe mountain Mudgeeraba  takes its name from the Bundjalung language words mudherri meaning sticky and ba meaning place, that is, a muddy place.\nThe mountain Pages Pinnacle is named after local land owner Sir Earle Christmas Grafton Page.\nThe area first attracted timber-cutters in the 1870s because of the abundant supply of good quality timber. In 1881 David Yuan established at saw mill and European settlement began. A small settlement sprang up as a rest point for the bullock teams hauling timber to the railway at Nerang. As late as the 1930s, there were still up to 24 bullock teams operating in the area.\nIn 1884, the first hotel was built by W. H. Turner called the Beechmont Hotel. In 1905, Ernest Belliss opened a hotel on the corner of Numinbah Road and a bullock road from Beechmont known as the Black Shoot; he called it the Advancetown Hotel. Belliss also donated land for the Advancetown school, which made the name endure. Belliss sold the hotel in March 1924 and the timber building burned down in July 1933. A new Advancetown Hotel was built and opened in February 1934.\nAdvancetown State School opened in 1909, but then closed in 1913. It reopened in 1918 but had temporary closures in 1921 and 1952. It closed permanently in 1960.\nHinze Dam was first completed in 1976 (Stage 1), providing a storage of 42,400&nbsp;million litres of water to surrounding residents. The dam named after local pioneers Carl and Johanna Hinze (grandparents of Queensland politician Russ Hinze) who lived in the valley that was flooded by the dam. The settlement of Advancetown including the school (which was closed by then) was lost under the dam's waters. As the settlement of Advancetown was gone, on 31 March 1979 the name Advancetown was dropped in favour of Latimer, after nearby Latimer Creek,  but the name Advancetown was restored on 11 May 1985.\nIn 1989, Stage 2 of the dam was completed, increasing the storage to 161,070&nbsp;million litres of water.\nAdvancetown was part of the Shire of Albert until it was amalgamated into the City of Gold Coast in 1995.\nIn 2011, Stage 3 of the dam was completed, increasing the storage to 310,730&nbsp;million litres of water. It reportedly cost $395&nbsp;million dollars.\nDemographics\nIn the , Advancetown had a population of 352 people.\nIn the , Advancetown had a population of 482 people.\nIn the , Advancetown had a population of 528 people.\nHeritage listings\n|alt=]]\nThere are a number of heritage sites in Advancetown, including:\n* 163-179 Latimers Crossing Road: Avenue of Commemorative Trees\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Advancetown.

This private club has a 19-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman.\nAttractions\nThe Hinze Dam offers a number of visitor attractions. Accessed from Advancetown Road at the top of dam wall () is a visitor centre with education displays, a cafe and parkland with picnic facilities. Below the spillway are picnic areas with barbeques (). Across the spillway is a network of purpose-built mountain bike trails. In the two arms of the lake there are the eastern  and western  boat ramps for non-motorised boating and fishing (catch-and-release only due to mercury levels). The eastern boat ramp () is accessed from Range Road, while the western boat ramp () is accessed via Nerang Murwillumbah Road. There are also a number of walking trails.\nClimate\nAdvancetown has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa).
