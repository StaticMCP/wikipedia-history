      "text": "# Timeline of HIV/AIDS\n\nThis is a timeline of HIV/AIDS, including but not limited to cases before 1980.\nPre-1980s\nResearchers estimate that some time in the early 20th century, a form of Simian immunodeficiency virus found in chimpanzees (SIVcpz) first entered humans in Central Africa and began circulating in Léopoldville (modern-day Kinshasa) by the 1920s. This gave rise to the pandemic form of HIV (HIV-1 group M); other zoonotic transmissions led to the other, less prevalent, subtypes of HIV.\n; 1930s to 1950s\n: A range of small scale Pneumocystis pneumonia epidemics occurred in northern and central European countries between the 1930s and 1950s, affecting children who were prematurely born. The epidemics spread likely due to infected glass syringes and needles. Malnutrition was not considered a cause, as Europe largely had recovered from wartime food shortages. Researchers state that the most likely cause of the epidemic was a retrovirus closely related to HIV (or a mild version of HIV) brought to Europe and originating from Cameroon, a former German colony. The epidemic started in the Free City of Danzig in 1939 and then spread to nearby countries in the 1940s and 1950s, including Switzerland and The Netherlands.\n; 1952\n: American Richard Edwin Graves Jr., a 28-year-old World War II veteran who had been stationed in the Solomon Islands died on 26 July 1952 in Memphis, Tennessee with pneumocystis pneumonia and CMV, which some authors suggest constitutes a sufficient number of opportunistic infections that are suggestive of an AIDS diagnosis.\n; 1959\n: The first known case of :HIV in a human occurs in a Bantu man who died in the Congo. His blood sample, designated LEO70, which was taken for a study on Malaria and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency later tested positive for HIV using multiple testing modalities.\n: June 28, 1959: In New York City, Ardouin Antonio, a 49-year-old Haitian shipping clerk, dies of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a disease now closely associated with AIDS but then considered highly anomalous for an adult. Gordon Hennigar, who performed the postmortem examination of the man's body, found \"the first reported instance of unassociated Pneumocystis carinii disease in an adult\" to be so unusual that he preserved Ardouin's lungs for later study. The case was published in two medical journals at the time, and Hennigar has been quoted in numerous publications saying that he believes Ardouin probably had AIDS.\n: David Carr, a Manchester printer (sometimes mistakenly referred to as a sailor) who died on 31 August 1959 following the failure of his immune system; he succumbed to pneumonia. Baffled by what he had died from, doctors preserved 50 of his tissue samples for inspection. In 1990, the tissues were found to be HIV-positive. However, in 1992, a second test by AIDS researcher David Ho found that the strain of HIV which was present in the tissues was similar to the strain of HIV which was found in tissue samples which were collected and analyzed in the late 1980s rather than an earlier strain of HIV (which would have mutated considerably over the course of 30 years). Ho's discovery has cast doubt on the theory that David Carr's death was caused by AIDS.\n; 1960s\n: HIV-2, a viral variant found in West Africa, is thought to have transferred to people from sooty mangabey monkeys in Guinea-Bissau.\n: Genetic studies of the virus indicate that HIV-1 (M) first arrived in the Americas in the late 1960s likely in Haiti or another Caribbean island. At this time, many Haitians were working in the Congo, providing the opportunity for infection.\n; 1964\n: Jerome Horwitz of Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University School of Medicine synthesizes AZT under a grant from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). AZT was originally intended as an anticancer drug.\n; 1966\n: Williams and Williams note that an unusually high incidence of simultaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, river blindness, and femoral hernia in patients within the West Nile sub-region of Uganda. They went on to speculate that the black fly which transmits river blindness may also transmit the causative agent for Kaposi's sarcoma.\n: Slavin, Cameron, and Singh note first that research indicates that, quote \"Kaposi's sarcoma occurs with great frequency in indigenous African Negroes\", and then goes on to describe 117 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (including cases in children indicative of vertical transmission), typical of HIV/AIDS infection. Finally, they note that, at the time of publication, 4% of malignancies diagnosed in Tanzania by biopsy indicated Kaposi's sarcoma as the causative agent.\n; 1969\n: A St. Louis teenager, identified as Robert Rayford, dies of an illness that baffled his doctors since first exhibiting symptoms in 1966. Eighteen years later, molecular biologists at Tulane University in New Orleans test samples of his remains and find evidence of HIV, suggesting he may have been the first documented AIDS case in North America.\n; 1976\n: January: The 8-year-old daughter of Arvid Noe dies of what was later identified the first AIDS death in Europe.  Noe, a Norwegian sailor, dies in April; his wife dies in December. Later it is determined that Noe contracted HIV-1 type O, in Africa during the early 1960s.\n; 1977\n: Danish physician Grethe Rask dies of AIDS contracted in Africa.\n: A San Francisco woman, believed to be a sex-worker, gives birth to the first of three children who are later diagnosed with AIDS. The children's blood was tested after their deaths and revealed HIV infection. The mother died of AIDS in May 1987. Test results showed she was infected no later than 1977.\n: French-Canadian flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas, a relatively early HIV patient, gets legally married in Los Angeles to obtain U.S. citizenship. He stayed in Silver Lake whenever he was in town.\n: A Zairian woman in her 30s seeks treatment in Belgium for symptoms indicating a suppressed immune system and AIDS-like disease (rapid weight loss, swollen lymph nodes and severe CMV). She initially came to Belgium for care of the oral fungus infection of her baby daughter. Her two other children, who were recently born as well, had  died from respiratory infections; both also had an oral fungus infection since birth. The woman contracted even more opportunistic infections, dying in Kinshasa in early 1978. Tissue and blood samples were not preserved, but researchers state this might be an early AIDS case.\n; 1978\n: A Portuguese man known as Senhor José (English: Mr. Joseph) dies; he will later be confirmed as the first known infection of HIV-2. It is believed that he was exposed to the disease in Guinea-Bissau in 1966.\n; 1979\n: A thirty-year-old woman from the Dominican Republic dies at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City from CMV infection.\n: A Greek man who worked for years as a fisherman at Congo's Lake Tanganyika shows up in a Belgian hospital with a range of untreatable opportunistic infections, including a very rare fungal meningitis. After he dies, the hospital keeps his blood and tissue samples for future analysis. After HIV testing becomes available, his samples are tested for HIV and give a positive result.\n1980s\n; 1980\n: April 24 – San Francisco resident (and supposed gay sex worker) Ken Horne is reported to the Center for Disease Control with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Later, in 1981, the CDC would retroactively identify him as the first patient of the AIDS epidemic in the US. He also had Cryptococcus.\n: October 31 – Gaëtan Dugas pays his first known visit to New York City bathhouses. He would later be incorrectly deemed \"Patient Zero\" for his supposed connection to many early cases of AIDS in the United States.\n: December 23 – Rick Wellikoff, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, dies of AIDS in New York City. He is the fourth US citizen known to die from the illness.\n: A Zairian woman and a French woman die in late 1980 of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris.\n: A 36-year-old Danish homosexual male dies in the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen from Pneumocystis pneumonia.\n; 1981\n: April 28 – Sandy Ford, a drug technician at the Centers for Disease Control, writes her superiors a memo on an unusual cluster of pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma cases she has identified. Ford was in charge of CDC distribution of pentamidine, a medicine used to treat pneumocystis pneumonia, and she had noticed a surge in young homosexual men with the disease, which only appears in individuals with suppressed immune systems. Her memo begins the CDC's investigation into the disease.\n: May 18 – Lawrence Mass becomes the first journalist in the world to write about the epidemic, in the New York Native, a gay newspaper. A gay tipster overheard his physician mention that some gay men were being treated in intensive-care units in New York City for a strange pneumonia. \"Disease Rumors Largely Unfounded\" was the headline of Mass' article, which ran on page 7. Mass repeated a New York City public health official's claims that there was no wave of disease sweeping through the gay community. At this point, however, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had been investigating the outbreak that Mass' source dismissed for about a month.\n: June 4 – Brent Thomas, the Associate Editor of The Advocate magazine, dies from AIDS complications.\n: June 5 – In an issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the CDC reports a cluster of five Pneumocystis pneumonia cases in five \"young...practicing homosexuals\" in Los Angeles. Each of these cases included simultaneous Cytomegalovirus infection, and several included other AIDS-defining clinical conditions, including Candidiasis, Hodgkin lymphoma, and Cytomegalovirus retinitis. The CDC goes on to suggest that there is a possibility of a \"cellular-immune dysfunction related to common exposure that predisposes individuals to Opportunistic infections\"\n: July 3 – An article in The New York Times carries the headline: \"Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals\". The article describes cases of Kaposi's sarcoma found in forty-one gay men, mostly in New York City and San Francisco.\n: July 3 – A new article appears in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report headlined \"Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis Pneumonia Among Homosexual Men — New York City and California.\" One cluster in New York City included 20 patients, 7 of whom had died at the time of publication. The other cluster, in California, had just six with an additional death. Of the 26 cases reported, 12 had tests for Cytomegalovirus, all of which were positive. The report describes frequent hepatitis and amoebiasis infections among those described. It also details the apparent connection between Kaposi's sarcoma and immune suppression, noting the abnormality of the disease among young adults. The report notes that, aside from those receiving immunosuppressants, the only group previously known to be at elevated risk for Kaposi's sarcoma was children and young adults in Equatorial Africa — no doubt because of the already endemic HIV in the area.\n: August 28 – A third article in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report increases the number of known cases to 108. While the vast majority remain in New York and California, it reports new cases in Georgia, Florida, and Oklahoma.\n: October – Self-proclaimed \"AIDS poster boy\" Bobbi Campbell is diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma in San Francisco. That same month he creates and displays San Francisco's first AIDS poster.\n: October 29 – John Eaddie, 49, dies of pneumocystis pneumonia in London. He is later identified as HIV-positive.\n: October – The first reported case appears in Spain, in a 35-year-old gay man who died shortly after.\n: December 10 – Bobbi Campbell is the first to come out publicly as a person with what came to be known as AIDS.\n: December 12 – The first known case is reported in the United Kingdom.\n: One of the first reported patients to have died of AIDS (presumptive diagnosis) in the US is reported in the journal Gastroentereology. Louis Weinstein, the treating physician, wrote that \"Immunologic incompetence, related to either disease or therapy, or both ... although suspected, could not be proved...\"\n: HIV can be traced in Mexico to 1981.\n: By the end of the year on December 31, 337 people are known to have had the disease, 321 adults, and 16 children under the age of 13, and of those 130 had died from the disease.\n; 1982\n: January – The service organization Gay Men's Health Crisis is founded by Larry Kramer and others in New York City.\n: June 18 – \"Exposure to some substance (rather than an infectious agent) may eventually lead to immunodeficiency among a subset of the homosexual male population that shares a particular style of life.\" For example, Marmor et al. recently reported that exposure to amyl nitrite was associated with an increased risk of KS in New York City. Exposure to inhalant sexual stimulants, central-nervous-system stimulants, and a variety of other \"street\" drugs was common among males belonging to the cluster of cases of KS and PCP in Los Angeles and Orange counties.\"\n: July 4 – Terry Higgins becomes one of the first people to die of AIDS-related illnesses in the United Kingdom, prompting the foundation in November of what was to become the Terrence Higgins Trust.\n: July 9 – The CDC reports a cluster of opportunistic infections (OI) and Kaposi's sarcoma among Haitians recently entering the United States. Their risk factor for acquiring the syndrome was uncertain. Ten (29.4%) of these 34 patients with the syndrome of unexplained OI and Kaposi's Sarcoma (termed AIDS weeks later by CDC) also had disseminated tuberculosis. This was the first reported association of tuberculosis with AIDS in a cluster of patients. The uncertain risk factor for AIDS among Haitians was ultimately explained mostly by heterosexual transmission.\n: July 27 – The term AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is proposed at a meeting in Washington, D.C. of gay-community leaders, federal bureaucrats and the CDC to replace GRID (gay-related immune deficiency) as evidence showed it was not gay specific.\n: September 24 – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a case of AIDS as a disease, at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring in a person with no known cause for diminished resistance to that disease. Such diseases include KS, PCP, and serious OI. Diagnoses are considered to fit the case definition only if based on sufficiently reliable methods (generally histology or culture). Some patients who are considered AIDS cases on the basis of diseases only moderately predictive of cellular immunodeficiency may not actually be immunodeficient and may not be part of the current epidemic.\n: December 10 – A baby in California becomes ill in the first known case of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.\n: The first known case appears in Brazil.\n: The first known case appears in Canada.\n: The first known case appears in Italy.\n: The first known case appears in France.\n: The first known case appears in Australia, diagnosed at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney.\n; 1983\n: January – Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, isolates a retrovirus that kills T-cells from the lymph system of a gay AIDS patient.

White became infected with HIV from blood products that were administered to him on a regular basis as part of his treatment for hemophilia. When the public school that he attended, Western Middle School in Russiaville, Indiana, learned of his disease in 1985, there was enormous pressure from parents and faculty to bar him from school premises. Due to the widespread fear of AIDS and lack of medical knowledge, principal Ron Colby and the school board assented. His family filed a lawsuit, seeking to overturn the ban.\n: The first case of HIV infection in the Philippines is reported.\n: Gaëtan Dugas passes away due to AIDS-related illnesses.

Researchers at the University of Leuven in Belgium say the HIV strain CRF19 can progress to AIDS within two to three years of exposure to virus. Typically, HIV takes approximately 10 years to develop into AIDS. The researchers found that patients with the CRF19 variant had more virus in their blood than patients who had more common strains. Patients with CRF19 may start getting sick before they even know they have been infected, which ultimately means there is a significantly shorter time span to stop the disease's progression. The researchers suspect that fragments of other subsets of the virus fasten to each other through an enzyme which makes the virus more powerful and more easily replicated in the body, thus the faster progression.\n; 2016\n: The Prevention Access Campaign first promotes the health-education message Undetectable = Untransmittable which in the following years is endorsed by the World Health Organisation.\n: September 11 – Transgender actress, musician, and drag performer Alexis Arquette passes away at age 47 due to cardiac arrest caused by myocarditis stemming from HIV.\n: Researchers have found that an international study found that almost 2,000 patients with HIV failed to respond to the antiviral drug known as Tenofovir disoproxil. Tenofovir is the main HIV drug treatment. The failure to respond to treatment indicates that the virus' resistance to the medication is becoming increasingly common.\n: The United Nations holds its 2016 High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS. The countries involved, the member states of the United Nations, pledge to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. There was significant controversy surrounding the event as over 50 countries blocked the access of LGBTQ+ groups from participating in the meeting. At the conclusion of the meetings, which ran from June 8 to 10, 2016, the final resolution barely mentioned several groups that are most affected by HIV/AIDS: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, and sex workers.\n; 2019\n: A second patient is reported to be cured of HIV/AIDS using the same cell therapy approach that cured the first patient of HIV/AIDS, removing doubts that the first instance of the cure was a fluke and providing clinical proof that a cure for HIV/AIDS is both possible and repeatable.\n: Research Foundation to Cure AIDS (RFTCA) becomes the first 501(c)3 public charity in the United States with a grant to its own biotechnology to research, develop and commercialize a cure for HIV/AIDS on a pro bono basis.\n: National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, launches a $200&nbsp;million commitment to fund efforts focused on curing HIV infection and sickle cell disease.\n2020s\n; 2021\n: The United Nations holds the 2021 high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS.\n; 2022\n: City of Hope doctors announce that a fourth person in history has been cured of HIV through a stem cell transplant.

But the doctors warned the procedure cannot be made available on a large scale.\n; 2023\n: PrEP implants in Rhesus macaque monkeys are reported as an additional possible future treatment to prevent HIV in humans. The implant's goal is to make PrEP easier to use for patients who have trouble adhering to a pill or injection timetable, and further avoid adverse drug reactions (in injections). Animals research with positive results, however, does not always fit into human conditions.\n: Researchers confirm that a fifth person, called the Düsseldorf patient, is cured from HIV. The fact was first announced at a conference in 2019, from which it had since been pending verification.\n: A male HIV patient based in Geneva is reported as having entered the virus' remission for 20 months, without taking antiretrovirals since November 2021. French and Swiss researchers treating him, however, said the treatment did not include receiving stem cells from a donor with the CCR5 mutation, which helped cure all the five previous patients, but only a bone marrow transplant, citing that as the reason why they still cannot rule out a viral rebound on him.\n: A clinical trial for a preventive HIV vaccine called VIR-1388 begins in the United States and South Africa. The vaccine aims to instruct T cells to recognize the HIV in the human body and start a reaction to keep it from creating a chronic infection. Initial results are expected to come out in late 2024.\n; 2025\n: The second administration of President Donald Trump puts USAID on a 90-day freeze which involves putting PEPFAR on halt and taking its computer systems offline.\n: January 28 – the Trump administration grants a waiver for essential medicines and medical services which includes HIV medicines.

Braidwood Management, Inc. the plaintiffs, including Braidwood Management, argued that the Affordable Care Act mandate requiring health plans to cover preventive services without cost-sharing violates their constitutional and religious rights. The plaintiffs specifically objected to coverage of Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention (PrEP), an HIV prevention drug, citing religious objections to facilitating behavior they oppose, such as homosexual conduct and drug use. The plaintiffs made two major arguments. The first was that the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which recommends preventive services, was not properly appointed under the Appointments Clause, because this body makes binding recommendations without Senate-confirmed oversight. The second was that covering PrEP violates their religious beliefs in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as they object to subsidizing what they view as morally objectionable behaviors. The Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiffs and remanded for further proceedings.\n: June - The FDA approves the use of 6 monthly injections of Lenacapavir, a drug made by Gilead Sciences, that has shown greater than 96% reduction in HIV risk across the trialed population. Stakeholders begin the practical work to secure lenacapavir supplies for at risk populations globally while Bill Clinton noted that lenacapavir was “a genuine chance to end” the HIV epidemic.\nSee also\n* History of HIV/AIDS\n* Timeline of early HIV/AIDS cases\n* Women and HIV/AIDS\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://aidstimeline.org Interactive zoomable timeline focusing on the last 30 years and the AIDS Memorial Quilt]\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/other/PDF/TimeLine%202006.pdf Important milestones in the U.S. HIV/AIDS epidemic]\n* [http://www.kff.org/hivaids/timeline/hivtimeline.cfm Flash Global HIV/AIDS Timeline] from the Kaiser Family Foundation\nfr:Syndrome d'immunodéficience acquise#Histoire"
