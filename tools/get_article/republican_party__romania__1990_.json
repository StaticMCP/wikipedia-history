In 1993 it merged with two other parties to create the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PSDR), although some dissatisfied members created a party with the same name later the same year.\nHistory\nThe Republican Party contested the 1990 general elections as part of the Alliance for Romanian Unity (AUR), a nationalist political alliance formed with the Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR). The alliance received 2.1% of the Chamber of Deputies vote, winning nine seats. It also received 2.2% of the Senate vote, winning two seats. However, all of the seats were taken by the PUNR. The Republican Party contested the 1992 general elections alone, receiving 1.6% of the Chamber vote and failing to win a seat.\nElectoral history\nLegislative elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!rowspan=2|Election\n!colspan=3|Chamber\n!colspan=3|Senate\n!rowspan=2|Position\n!rowspan=2|Status\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n|1990\n|colspan=2|Part of the AUR\n|\n|300,473\n|2.15\n|\n|6th\n|\n|-\n|1992\n|177,056\n|1.63\n|\n|205,988\n|1.88\n|\n|11th\n|\n|}\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:centre\n!Election\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!Percentage\n!Position\n|-\n|1992|| || 362,485 ||3.0||6th\n|}\nReferences"
