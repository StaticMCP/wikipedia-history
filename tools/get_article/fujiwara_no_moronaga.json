He was also known as Myo-On-In Daishokoku (Grand chancellor of Myo-On-In).\nLife\nMoronaga was born into the northern branch of Fujiwara clan. He was the second son of Fujiwara no Yorinaga. He also retained a special relationship of \"Quasi-son\" with his grandfather Fujiwara no Tadajitsu. Thanks to this relationship with the ōdono Tadajistsu， Moronaga's political security was guaranteed and he was seen as one of the potential successor of the position of supreme chancellor Kanpaku.\nIn 1151, Moronaga was entered into the noble rank of Kugyo at the age of 14. In 1154, he was appointed the acting-middle counsellor. In 1156, Moronaga's father Yorinaga planned a rebellion against Emperor Go-Shirakawa and Fujiwara no Tadamichi. Historically, the rebellion was known as the Hōgen rebellion. The result of Yorinaga's rebellion was disastrous, he died during the rebellion while Moronaga was seen as a potential threat to the Japanese monarch. Consequently, Moronaga was exiled to Tosa province.\nIn 1164, Moronaga was allowed to return to Kyoto. Soon after his return, his noble rank was also restored. In 1177, Moronaga was promoted to the position of Daijō-daijin (chancellor). Quite unfortunately for Moronaga, he became a political enemy of the military strongman Taira no Kiyomori who initiated a ''coup d'etat in 1179 and took over the power in Japan. He was dismissed together with Kanpaku Matsudono Motofusa and once more exiled. Later, he forfeited all his titles and became a Buddhist monk in Owari province. He died in Kyoto in 1192 when he was 55 years old.\nMusic\nMoronaga was a prominent musician of the Heian era. He was especially skillful in playing Koto and Biwa. He wrote two books on Musicology: Jinchi Yoroku and Sango Yoroku. The two books contain numerous contemporary Chinese and Korean classical musical scores. In addition, he was a devoted worshiper of Benzaiten, the patron deity of Musicians in Japanese Buddhism.\nAccording to sinologist Rao Zongyi, Sango Yoroku'' contains some of the oldest surviving musical scores for the biwa.\nFamily\nMoronaga gave birth to three sons, one daughter and adopted one son from Fujiwara no Narichika.\n*Fujiwara no Morotae\n*Fujiwara no Moroyoshi\n*Fujiwara no Narimune\n*Chokaku\n*A daughter whose name is unknown.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPe-d7G37-k Takuboku], one of the Biwa score recorded by Moronaga.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewgvweIF8ZE Shishang Liuquan], one of the ancient Chinese musical score recorded by Moronaga."
