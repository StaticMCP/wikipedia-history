Hanley and lyricists Joe Goodwin and Murray Roth. The tune was originally written for the 1920 musical The Greenwich Village Follies.\nThe song was recorded in Camden, New Jersey, in November 1920, sung by vocalist Billy Jones (AKA \"Victor Roberts\"). It was later recorded by Tiny Tim and released on his 1969 children's album For All My Little Friends.\nLyrics\nI wonder why I'm always lonesome\nand what the trouble can be.\nSome fellows claim their mate\nbut it just seems like fate\nhas made a monkey out of me.\nI'm like a raindrop in a cloud,\nI find I'm lost whenever I am in a crowd, believe me,\nI'm a lonesome little raindrop\nlooking for a place to fall.\nThe clouds are dark but that don't matter,\n'cause into some fair garden,\nI'll go pitter, patter, pitter, patter.\nI hope goodness knows,\nthe friendly breeze that blows,\nwill let me tumble down into the heart of a rose.\nI'm a lonesome little raindrop\nlooking for a place to fall.\nYou've heard of Robinson Crusoe,\nwell he had nothing on me.\nI'm always all alone,\na sweetie of my own,\nwould make me happy as can be.\nI'm just as blue as skies above,\nI'd like to find someone\nto shower with my love, believe me.\nI'm a lonesome little raindrop\nlooking for a place to fall.\nThe girls say I'm a charming fella,\nbut when I come around each girl puts up her umbrella.\nGirls that are so fair,\nthey all give me the air\nI keep on falling, falling\nbut don't land anywhere, oh\nI'm a lonesome little raindrop\nlooking for a place to fall.\nReferences\n*[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/7727/ Library of Congress National Jukebox (1920 audio recording)]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2K5le1h16cC&dq=%22I%E2%80%99m+a+Lonesome+Little+Raindrop+%28Looking+for+a+Place+to+Fall%29%22&pg=PT25 Ode to Uke by Art Ravenscrag III]"
