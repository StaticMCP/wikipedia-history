However, after Vassos Lyssarides of the Movement for Social Democracy announced on 8 January that he would not stand as a candidate, incumbent president Spyros Kyprianou (who had held office since the death of Makarios III in August 1977, and was elected in a walkover in the election to fill the balance of Makarios' term in September 1977) was left as the only remaining candidate. Kyprianou officially became president on 26 January.\nReferences"
