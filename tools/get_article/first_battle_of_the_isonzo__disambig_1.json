The Austro-Hungarians had the advantage of fighting from uphill positions barricaded with barbed wire which were able to easily resist the Italian assault.\nThe Italians had some early successes. They partially took Krn (), took Kolovrat Plateau, and captured highlands around Bovec. However, they were unable to dislodge the Austro-Hungarian troops from the high ground between Tolmin and Soča River. The heaviest fighting occurred around Gorizia (). In addition to the natural defenses of the river and mountains, bastions were created at Oslavia () and Podgora. The fighting at Gorizia consisted of street-by-street urban combat interspersed with artillery fire. Italian troops, such as the Italian Re and Casale Brigades, were able to advance as far as the suburbs but could get no further and were driven back. They made small footholds at Sagrado and Redipuglia on the Karst Plateau southeast of Gorizia but were unable to do much else.\nOn the Austrian-Hungarian side two commanders distinguished themselves: Major General Géza Lukachich von Somorja, commander of the 5th Mountain Brigade, who retook Redipuglia, and Major General Novak von Arienti who retook Hill 383 (overlooking Plave) with his 1st Mountain Brigade.\nEarly in July the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Fifth Army, General Svetozar Boroević, received two reinforcement divisions, which put an end to the Italian efforts at breaking through the Austro-Hungarian lines.\nThe final Italian gains were minimal: in the northern sector, they conquered the heights over Bovec (Mount Kanin); in the southern sector, they conquered the westernmost ridges of the Karst Plateau near Fogliano Redipuglia and Monfalcone. The battle was soon followed by the Second Battle of the Isonzo.\nInvolved units\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|bgcolor=\"#FFA500\"|Austria-Hungary\n|-\n| 5th Army   ||||||            ||\n|-\n||VII Corps|| XVI Corps ||  XV Corps||||\n|-\n| 1st Infantry Division ||57th Infantry Division||61st Infantry Division||20th Infantry Division||58th Infantry Division\n|-\n|17th Infantry Division||18th Infantry Division||50th Infantry Division||\n|-\n|187th Infantry Brigade||6th Mountain Brigade||16th Mountain Brigade||14th Mountain Brigade||81st Honvéd Infantry Brigade\n|-\n|39th Honvéd Infantry Brigade||2nd Mountain Brigade||12th Mountain Brigade||5th Mountain Brigade||4th Mountain Brigade\n|-\n|10th Mountain Brigade||1st Mountain Brigade||13th Mountain Brigade||7th Mountain Brigade||15th Mountain Brigade\n|-\n|8th Mountain Brigade||3rd Mountain Brigade||||||\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFA500\"|Reserve||||||||\n|-\n|93rd Infantry Division||||||||\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFA500\"|Headquarters||||||||\n|-\n|VII Corps in Kostanjevica||XVI Corps in Dornberg||XV Corps in Kneža||||\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|bgcolor=\"#FF0000\"|Italy                ||\n|-\n|2nd Army||3rd Army||||||\n|-\n|VII Corps||X Corps||XI Corps||VI Corps||II Corps\n|-\n|IV Corps||||||\n|-\n|13th Infantry Division||14th Infantry Division||20th Infantry Division||19th Infantry Division||21st Infantry Division\n|-\n|12th Infantry Division||11th Infantry Division||4th Infantry Division||3rd Infantry Division||32nd Infantry Division\n|-\n|7th Infantry Division||8th Infantry Division||Bersaglieri Division||Alpini Group A and B||half 29th Infantry Division\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FF0000\"|Reserve||||||\n|-\n|XIV Corps||||||||\n|-\n|half 29th Infantry Division||22nd Infantry Division||28th Infantry Division||30th Infantry Division||23rd Infantry Division\n|-\n|27th Infantry Division||33rd Infantry Division||1st Cavalry Division||2nd Cavalry Division||3rd Cavalry Division\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FF0000\"|Commanders||||||||\n|-\n|Pietro Frugoni||Emanuele Filiberto||||\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FF0000\"|Headquarters||||||||\n|-\n|2nd Army in Udine||3rd Army in Cervignano||||\n|}\nSee also\nAustro-Hungarian trench at the Soča (Isonzo)\n* History of Austria\n* Italy in World War I\nReferences\n* Österreichisches Staatsarchiv/Kriegsarchiv Wien\n*L'esercito italiano nella grande guerra (1915–1918) Volume I–IV / Roma: Ministerio della Guerra – Ufficio Storico, 1929–1974\n*Ministero della Guerra Stato Maggiore centrale – Ufficio Storico.
