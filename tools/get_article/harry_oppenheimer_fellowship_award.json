It is considered the top award for research on the African continent.\nIn Memory of Harry Oppenheimer\nThe Award was created in 2001, in South Africa, by the Trustees of the Oppenheimer Memorial Trust, itself established in 1958 by Harry Oppenheimer in memory of his father, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer.\nThe philanthropic vision of the once-richest man in the world is embedded within three foundations:\n#The Brenthurst Foundation contributes energetically to developing economic empowerment in Africa.\n#The Oppenheimer Memorial Trust funds and encourages science, the arts and the search for knowledge, through various grants and initiatives, and awards Africa's premier research prize, the Harry Oppenheimer Fellowship Award.\n#The Brenthurst Library  which houses one of the largest collections of rare Africana in the world and the celebrated transcripts of Nelson Mandela's trials.\nHow the Fellowship Award is bestowed\nAwardees are leading scholars who have a sustained record of outstanding research and intellectual achievement at the highest level. They must have demonstrated a capacity for and a commitment to knowledge transfer to their fellow citizens. Up to now the Award has only been presented to South Africans or South Africa-based academics.\nThe Award is made by a select committee and approved by the Trustees in December of each year. The Secretary General of the Academy of Science of South Africa chairs the selection proceedings.\nThe remittance ceremony takes place in April following the year of the Award, at the Oppenheimers’ residence, Brenthurst, in Johannesburg. The Award (a gold medal and a monetary prize) is bestowed by Mrs. Harry (Bridget) Oppenheimer.\nList of Laureates\nSource: [https://www.omt.org.za/the-harry-oppenheimer-fellowship-award/past-fellows/ Oppenheimer Memorial Trust]\n* 2022: Michael Wingfield, University of Pretoria\n*2018: Valerie Mizrahi, University of Cape Town\n*2017: Mark Solms, University of Cape Town\n*2016: Jointly awarded to University of Pretoria and University of Cape Town faculty member Professor Robert (Bob) Millar for his work in neuroendocrinology and Professor Lynn Morris, Research Professor at Wits University and Research Associate at the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA)\n*2015: Jointly awarded to Brenda Wingfield, Professor of Genetics, University of Pretoria and Xolela Mangcu, professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Cape Town\n*2014: Helen Rees, Personal Professor in the Wits Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology\n*2013: Keertan Dheda, Professor of Respiratory Medicine and Head of UCT's Division of Pulmonology\n*2012: Awarded Robin Crewe, Zoology and Entomology, University of Pretoria for his work on bees\n*2011: Les Underhill, Director of the Animal Demography Unit at the University of Cape Town.
