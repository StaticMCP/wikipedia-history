The incumbent President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was ineligible to seek re-election as per the 1987 Constitution.\nIncumbent Vice-President Noli de Castro was allowed to seek re-election, though he could have possibly sought the presidency. As he didn't offer himself in any manner of candidacy at the election, his successor was determined as the 13th Vice President of the Philippines. Although most presidential candidates have running mates, the president and vice president are elected separately, and the winning candidates may be of different political parties.\nThis election was also the first time that the Commission of Elections (COMELEC) implemented full automation of elections, pursuant to Republic Act 9369, \"An Act Authorizing The Commission on Elections To Use An Automated Election System In The May 11, 1998 National or Local Elections and In Subsequent National And Local Electoral Exercises\".\nThe results of the congressional canvassing showed that Senator Benigno Aquino III of the Liberal Party won by a plurality, although he had won with the highest percentage of votes since 1986, but not enough to have the largest margin of victory, even in elections held after 1986.\nMeanwhile, in the election for the vice-presidency, Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) defeated Senator Mar Roxas of the Liberal Party in the third-narrowest margin in the history of vice presidential elections. Aquino and Binay were proclaimed in a joint session of Congress on June 9, and took their oaths on June 30, 2010. Roxas filed an electoral protest to the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET; the Supreme Court) on July 10, 2010.\n|position=bottom}}\n}}\n}}\nElectoral system\nThe election is held every six years after 1992, on the second Monday of May. The incumbent president is term limited. The incumbent vice president may run for two consecutive terms. As Joseph Estrada, who was elected in 1998, was able to run in 2010, it is undetermined if the term limit is for life, or is only limited to the incumbent.\nThe plurality voting system is used to determine the winner: the candidate with the highest number of votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the presidency. The vice presidential election is a separate election, is held on the same rules, and voters may split their ticket. Both winners will serve six-year terms commencing on the noon of June 30, 2010, and ending on the same day six years later.\nThe candidates are determined via political conventions of the different political parties. As most political parties in the Philippines are loosely structured, with most politicians switching parties from time to time, a person not nominated by a party may either run as an independent, get drafted by another party, or form their own party. The candidacy process is supervised by the Commission on Elections (usually referred by its abbreviation \"COMELEC\") which also regulates and holds the elections. It is not uncommon for the commission to disqualify certain candidates as \"nuisance candidates\" or those candidates who have no capacity to mount a nationwide campaign. This usually limits the candidates to a small number. The campaign will run for three months, beginning in early February 2010 and ending on the eve of the election.\nThe counting of votes is initially held in the individual voting precincts, which are all then tabulated for the different municipalities and cities, then to the provinces, and finally to Congress, which is the final canvasser of the votes. Election protests are handled by the Supreme Court, when it sits as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal.\nTimeline\n, the incumbent president, whose term expired at noon on June 30, 2010.]]The COMELEC-mandated election period for this election was from January 10 to June 9\n2008\n* August 26 - Then-Metro Manila Development Authority Chairman Bayani Fernando announces bid for presidency.\n* September 4 - Senator Manny Villar announces bid for presidency.\n* November 11 - Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay announces bid for presidency.\n* November 26 - Senator Mar Roxas is elected as party president of the Liberal Party and is nominated to be the standard-bearer.\n2009\n* March 12 - Former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. announces bid for presidency.\n* April 25 - Senator Richard Gordon announces bid for presidency.\n* May 12 - Senator Panfilo Lacson announces bid for presidency.\n* June 6 - Senator Lacson withdraws from presidential race.\n* June 17 - Environmentalist Nicanor Perlas announces bid for presidency.\n* July 14 - Senator Loren Legarda announces bid for presidency.\n* July 31 - Senator Jamby Madrigal announces bid for presidency.\n* August 1 - Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino dies from colorectal cancer.

If both positions have not yet been determined, the President of the Senate, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the former is unable to do so, shall act as president.
