It is mentioned in Numbers 21:13–14, which reads:\nsays: '... Waheb in Suphah and the ravines of Arnon, and at the stream of the ravines that lead to the dwelling of Ar, which lies along the border of Moab.'|Numbers 21:13–14}}\nDavid Rosenberg suggests in The Book of David that it was written circa 1100 BC. Theologian Joseph Barber Lightfoot suggested it was another title for the biblical Book of Jasher.\nThe medieval Book of Jasher calls The Book of the Wars of the Lord a collaborative record Moses, Joshua, and the children of Israel wrote.  It was likely a collection of victory songs about Israel's military conquest of Canaan.\nIn Exodus 17:14, God tells Moses to inscribe an Israelite military victory over the Amalekites in an unnamed book and recount it later before his successor Joshua. Some Torah scholars such as Moses ibn Ezra have suggested this book may refer to the Book of the Wars of the LORD.\nSee also\n* Bible\n* Lost work\n* Books of the Bible\n* Milhamoth ha-Shem (the title of several Hebrew polemical texts)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03320.html Encyclopedia Judaica: Book of the Wars of the Lord]\n* [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14782-wars-of-the-lord-book-of-the Jewish Encyclopedia: Book of the Wars of the Lord]"
