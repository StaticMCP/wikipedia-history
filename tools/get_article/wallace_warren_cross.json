He served six terms in office, retiring from provincial politics in 1959.\nCross became minister of health under Premier William Aberhart and strongly enhanced the powers of the Alberta Eugenics Board by removing the requirement to obtain consent from individuals to be sterilized.\nDuring his time as minister, Cross also opened a series of cancer clinics across Alberta, and  actively focused the Department of Health's resources on cancer treatment.
