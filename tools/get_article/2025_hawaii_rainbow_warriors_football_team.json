The Rainbow Warriors are led by Timmy Chang in his fourth year as the program's head coach. The Rainbow Warriors play home games at the Clarence T. C. Ching Athletics Complex, located in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nAfter a win over Colorado State on October 18, the Rainbow Warriors became bowl eligible for the first time since 2019. The team was bowl eligible in 2020 and 2021 only due to COVID-19-related eligibility reasons. After a win at home over San Diego State on November 8, the Rainbow Warriors secured their first winning season since 2020.\nOffseason\nTransfers\nOutgoing\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|-\n|Ka'ena DeCambra\n|OL\n|Arizona\n|-\n|Dion Washington\n|DL\n|Boise State\n|-\n|Derek Boyd\n|LB\n|Delaware State\n|-\n|Alex Perry\n|WR\n|FIU\n|-\n|Jake Farrell\n|QB\n|Missouri S&T\n|-\n|Patrick Hisatake\n|DL\n|Northeastern State\n|-\n|John-Keawe Sagapolutele\n|QB\n|Portland State\n|-\n|Maclane Watkins\n|WR\n|San Diego\n|-\n|Malachi Finau\n|DL\n|San Diego State\n|-\n|Tylan Hines\n|RB\n|Tarleton State\n|-\n|Jordon Crawford\n|DL\n|Maine\n|-\n|Koali Nishigaya\n|WR\n|Unknown\n|-\n|Ismail Ganley\n|OL\n|Unknown\n|-\n|Ezra Evaimalo\n|DE\n|Unknown\n|-\n|Hunter Higham\n|LS\n|Boise State\n|-\n|Armando Lewis\n|WR\n|Unknown\n|-\n|Brandon Shah\n|DB\n|Unknown\n|-\n|Dekel Crowdus\n|WR\n|Withdrawn; later re-entered, now at Wisconsin\n|-\n|Nick Cenacle\n|WR\n|Withdrawn\n|}\nIncoming\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|Max Ware\n|WR\n|Arizona State\n|-\n|Tim Malo\n|S\n|Brown\n|-\n|Brandon White\n|WR\n|Kentucky\n|-\n|Luther McCoy\n|DL\n|Minnesota\n|-\n|De'jon Benton\n|DL\n|New Mexico\n|-\n|Qwyn Williams\n|DL\n|Ohio Dominican\n|-\n|Jackson Harris\n|WR\n|Stanford\n|-\n|Caleb Sempebwa\n|PK\n|TCU; retired following spring practices\n|-\n|Jax Thompson\n|LS\n|TCU; retired following spring practices\n|-\n|Ka'eo Akana\n|EDGE\n|Utah\n|-\n|Kainoa Carvalho\n|WR\n|Utah (flipped commitment after returning from LDS mission)\n|-\n|Jack Mowrey\n|LS\n|James Madison\n|}\nPreseason\nMountain West media poll\nThe Mountain West's preseason prediction poll was released on July 16, 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display: inline-table;\"\n|align=\"center\" Colspan=\"3\" |Mountain West media poll\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || Boise State || 464 (35)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2 || UNLV || 415 (4)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || San Jose State || 359\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4 || Colorado State || 326\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5 || Fresno State || 301\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6 || Air Force || 280\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 7 || Hawaii || 213\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 8 || San Diego State || 202\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 9 || Utah State || 165\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 10 || Wyoming || 150\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 11 || New Mexico || 84\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 12 || Nevada || 83\n|}\nSchedule\nOn August 11, it was announced that for the first time ever, all home games not nationally televised would be aired live on  Spectrum Sports in the state of Hawaii.
