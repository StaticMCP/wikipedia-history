Onigawara were historically found on Buddhist temples, but are now used in many traditionally styled buildings. Some tiles may depict things besides oni, but are still called onigawara due to custom.\nHistory\nPrior to the Heian period, similar ornaments with floral and plant designs (hanagawara) preceded the onigawara. The present design is thought to have come from a previous architectural element, the oni-ita, which is a board painted with the face of an oni and was meant to stop roof leaks. During the Nara period the tile was decorated with other motifs, but later it acquired distinct ogre-like features and became strongly tridimensional.\nGallery\n;Oni depictions\nHoryu-ji onigawara.JPG|From the ruins of the old Horyu-ji Temple (8th century CE)\n平安宮豊楽殿出土 鬼瓦-2.JPG|From the ruins of Heian Palace (8th–13th century CE)\n下野国分寺跡出土 鬼面文鬼瓦 (J-35013).JPG|From the ruins of Shimotsuke Kokubun-ji Temple (8th–10th century CE)\nOnigawara of Yahashira Shrine (Toyohashi).jpg|From the ruins of Yahashira Shrine (1504 CE)\nKouken-ji Tachibana ac (2).jpg\nJotoku-ji roof ac (5).jpg\nNakayamadera hondo onigawara2048.jpg\nOno-jodoji onigawara P4268760.jpg|Jōdo-ji\nOTSU Toiture Gichu ji.jpg\n;Other depictions\nRyu-jinja Koori ac (2).jpg\nHioki-jinja Tachibana ac (7).jpg\n波に宝珠図.jpg|Cintamani\n巾着袋.jpg|Kinchaku\nSee also\n*Chimera (architecture)\n*Gargoyle\n*Imperial roof decoration\n*Japanese architecture\n*Jisaburō Ozawa, an admiral nicknamed \"Onigawara\" by his men\n*Shachihoko\n*Shibi (roof tile)\n*Shisa\n*List of Traditional Crafts of Japan\nNotes\nReferences\n*Parent, Mary Neighbour.
