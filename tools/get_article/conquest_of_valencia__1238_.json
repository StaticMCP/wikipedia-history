Three years after conquering Burriana and all the territories north of this city, El Puig was conquered in a battle led by Bernat Guillem de Montpeller, uncle of King James I, in the spring of 1236, and fortified.\nAs El Puig is the key position for the Horta of Valencia and the northern access to the city, Zayyan ibn Mardanish gathered a large army in order to reconquer it, but was defeated in the memorable Battle of El Puig on 20 August 1237, in which James I did not take part because he was in Lleida.\nThe Aragonese army could now advance towards the city of Valencia.\nThe Siege\nOn 22 April 1238, James I arrived at the village Grau de Valencia to start the siege of the city, and established his command post at Russafa. Numerous knights from Aragon, Catalonia, Provence, and also Germany, Hungary, Italy, England, etc. joined the siege, after calls by the King and the Crusade bull granted by Pope Gregory IX in February 1237. In the middle of 1238 the then Archbishop of Tarragona, Pere d'Albalat, assisted James I by offering his personal services in the crusade against the city of Balasinya, in addition to contributing 5,000 marks of silver to the cause, as well as a considerable contingent of knights. His brother Benet d'Albalat, noble and knight, was officially named the commander of the troops.\nZayyan ibn Mardanish, seeing himself surrounded by Christian troops, asked the other Muslim sovereigns for help, but only Abu Zakariya Yahya, King of Tunis, to whom Ibn al-Abbar had been sent, reacted and sent a fleet of twelve ships to Balânsia. On 17 August 1237, the fleet arrived in Balànsia, but they did dare to disembark, because the wall was already attacked and shelled by the Aragonese.\nSince food was scarce in the city, Zayyan, having lost all hope of relief, began negotiations for surrendering the city to James I. Balànsia, which had resisted the Cid for two years in 1092–1094, now only endured the attack by James I for five months, but he was provided with better siege weapons.\nOn 22 September, the capitulation was signed  with the decisive intervention of Violant of Hungary, wife of James I, in setting up the conditions for the surrender. Zayyan and the Muslims who wanted to leave could do so south of the Júcar river and the Moors who wanted to stay could do so safely, but under Christian rule. To make the capitulation public, on 28 September 1238, the Valencian Moors hoisted a Royal flag of Aragon and Catalonia, later called the Pennon of the Conquest, on the tower of Alí Bufat. On Saturday 9 October 1238, James I officially took possession and entered the city.\nToday, 9 October is still celebrated as the Dia de la Comunitat Valenciana, the official holiday of the Valencian Community.\nConsequences\nOnce the Islamic Balânsia was captured, Pere d'Albalat consecrated the mosque into a Christian church and helped Berenguer de Castellbisbal in the organization of the new Bishopric of Valencia. In this way, Pere d'Albalat managed to have the See of Valencia declared suffragan of that of Tarragona, in direct opposition to the pretensions of the Castilian Archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada.\nAfter the Christian victory, the city was divided among those who had participated in the conquest, which is evidenced in the Llibre del Repartiment (Book of Distribution). James I granted the city new laws, the Furs of Valencia, which years later extended to the entire Kingdom of Valencia. Thus began a new stage, at the hands of a new society and a new language, Catalan, which established the foundations of the Valencian people as we know them today. Although an estimated 50,000 Muslims left the city and were replaced by some 30,000 mostly Catalan settlers, the large majority of the population remained Muslim for a long period of time.\nFrom 1239 to 1245, James I of Aragon continued with the conquest of the southern part of the Kingdom. Cullera fell in 1240, Alzira in 1242, Xàtiva in 1244 and Biar in 1245. James I of Aragon could not advance further south, as the coastal Taifa of Murcia had already been taken by King Ferdinand III of Castile in 1243.\nIn 1266, he did reconquer Murcia on behalf of his ally Alfonso X of Castile, after the Mudéjar revolt of 1264–1266.\nReactions\nThe English chronicler Mathew Paris spoke admiringly of James, labelling him \"most Christian king magnificent and vigorous in arms\" who had conquered the great city of Valencia. Pope Gregory IX declared:\nOur most dear son in Christ ... with many Catholic men, stirred by zeal for faith and signed by the sign of the cross, has ripped the Kingdom of Valencia from the hands of the pagans\nEmphasizing the need to protect the new conquest, the Pope also offered crusader status to those who would defend it. French King Louis IX gifted King James with a thorn from the Crown of Thorns relic he had in Sainte Chapelle Church.\nOn the other side, the Moorish Poet Ibn Amira, a native of the city, lamented:\nLike a bird of pray, the enemy seized the city - elegant, beautiful, brilliant Valencia- by the throat... the infidel has destroyed the Muslim faith there and the bell has replaced the call of the Muezzin.\nReferences"
