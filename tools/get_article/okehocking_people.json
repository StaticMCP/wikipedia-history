First attested in 1700, the band's name may have derived from the bends in Crum and Ridley Creeks. The group likely numbered between 15 and 25 individuals, and was unusually small for a Lenape band of the time.\nColonial pressures forced the band to relocate its summer settlement, leading the band to settle on a vacant tract of land originally deeded to a Quaker settler around 1701. The Proprietary government of Pennsylvania directed surveyors to allot the band a tract along one of the creeks. After petition for land in 1702, they were granted , but were cut off from most of Ridley Creek and may have been granted mostly hilly, unfertile land by the colonists. In 1710, a colonial road was built through the Okehocking land.\nAlthough most regional Lenape had abandoned their lands after 1718, the Okehocking remained on the tract until the early 1730s. Afterwards, they resettled westwards, perhaps to the village of Quittaphilla, near present-day Lebanon. The last mention of the band is in 1737, although it has been suggested that a sub-clan of Lenape recorded in 1860 and 1913 are descendants of the Okehocking.\nDemographics\nEtymology\nAccording to Lenape speaker Nora Thompson Dean, the name \"Okehocking\" is a place name that may translate to 'the place surrounded', and is likely the band's endonym. The name may refer to land surrounded by a stream's bends. The name is consistent with the band's territory along Ridley Creek and Crum Creek in what is now Pennsylvania. The term \"Crum\" similarly derives from the Dutch word for 'bent', and may reflect Dutch traders either similarly describing the creek or translating from the Unami word for it. The band was also known as the Crum Creek Indians and initially had its name recorded as \"Ockanickon\". This may have resulted from the recorder mistaking the band's name for that of a prominent Lenape elder in present-day New Jersey named Ockanickon. The two names are likely unrelated.\nPopulation\nThe Okehocking were probably an unusually small band even by the standards of the foraging Lenape. Only 3 adult males, all of whom typically participated in Lenape band activities, are recorded in 1702. Since they are not referred to as \"chiefs\", they were likely respected elders. Although reference is made to \"others\" in a 1702 survey warrant, there were probably no more than 3 or 4 other heads of families in the band. Based on these numbers, the total population of the Okehocking in 1702 probably numbered between 15 and 25. At a time when families of 10 in colonial Pennsylvania were granted about , the estimate of 25 band members is consistent with the  grant given to the Okehocking. Pennsylvania's Proprietors would have regarded the grant as too small for any larger group.\nHistory\n(pictured) and Crum Creek.]]\nEarly accounts and settlement (c. 1680–1701)\nThe Okehocking are first historically attested in 1700, about 70 years after European trade began in the Lenape area. Prior to European encroachment, the band was initially known to inhabit throughout the area along and between the Crum and Ridley Creeks, and likely foraged inland beyond the creeks and along the Delaware River. The Okehocking probably had a summer settlement in the vicinity of the Delaware. None of the band's village names have been recorded. Rapid English settlement in the region after 1680 disturbed the local Lenape, including the Okehocking. Despite growing colonization in the surrounding territory, in what is now Edgmont Township, Pennsylvania Proprietor William Penn did not award land grants in the area inhabited by the band, in keeping with his policy of not settling areas occupied by natives. Probably to avoid the expanding colonial construction, population, and deforestation, the Okehocking were pressured to move their summer settlement further up the river to an area free of settlers.\nBy 1701, either on their own initiative or advice from the Proprietors, they had settled on a vacant  tract of land between the creeks originally deeded to a Quaker named Griffith Jones in 1686. Jones's plot was within a larger tract claimed by an association of Welsh speaking Quakers and had not been settled, reverting to William Penn under colonial law.  In 1701, Abraham Beaks petitioned for the vacant tract, prompting a survey to be ordered by the Proprietary on 11 December 1701. Although Beaks did not receive the land, the survey was granted. The warrant directed the surveyors, Caleb Pusey, Nicholas Pile, and Nathaniel Newland, to locate a creekside lot for the settlement of the Okehocking.\nThe manner of relocation has been a subject of debate.  Weslager claims that Penn \"arranged for the resettlement\" of the Okehocking. Marshall Becker, however, discounts Weslager's interpretation as based on a flawed post-1890 account, and suggests that the band may have requested a secure tract within their traditional territory and had been offered part of the vacant Jones tract, to be determined by the surveyors.  In either case, the band had settled on the tract by the winter of 1701.\nOwnership of land tract (1701–1730)\nPossibly waiting to be certain that native land claims had been settled, the Proprietors began selling land in the area after the survey was completed. In 1702, Jonathan Bowater was granted  on the far western end of the vacant tract. Even though Bowater likely selected his plot to avoid contact with the Lenape settlements, the sale of land around them still worried the Okehocking, who still had no official colonial land grant in writing and felt insecure in their settlements. In December 1702, two weeks after Bowater received his land grant, the band petitioned for an official land tract from colonial authorities. The band's decision to conform to the colonial land system ensured a mutual understanding footing for both the colonial and indigenous parties. The colony issued a warrant for another survey a week later, undertaken by Chester County surveyor Isaac Taylor. Three Okehocking leaders, named as Pokais, Sepopawny, and Muttagoopa, and \"others\" were to be granted a  tract under the condition that they never transfer, sell, or dispose of it. If the band vacated the land, it would revert to the Proprietors.\nThe actual survey was only completed ten months later, on October 10, 1703. Despite Abraham Beaks' request that the band be given land along the creeks, and the order for the surveyors to grant land according to the band's \"desire\", the land granted to the Okehocking was poor for agriculture and contained only small stretches of Ridley and Crum creeks. The band was cut off from much of Ridley Creek by the land belonging to Charles Whitacre. Whitacre may have conspired with the surveying team to grant primarily hilly land to the Okehocking and exclude them from the most fertile, creekside areas. The tract as measured came to , less than apportioned to the band but within the margin of error for the time.\nMuch of the land was left forested by the band, and was not used for agriculture. In 1710, the Okeohocking hosted a gathering of regional Lenape on their land. Later that year, local colonists chartered a road splitting the Lenape land. The road may have been viewed by colonists as providing the Okehocking with easier access to their winter hunting grounds further inland, which had been cut off by settler land. However, the road's unusual placement through the tract rather than along its edge, as was more common at the time, indicates that colonists felt free to disregard the band's property rights. The road probably also accelerated the commercial development and settlement of the area. Although the court ordered a delay, possibly due to worries from the band, the road was built and is today the Delchester Road. Most mentions of the Okehocking until 1737 are from surveys of surrounding land, which made reference to the band's tract to set boundaries. By 1726, the Okehocking continued to own the tract in its entirety.\nDeparture from homeland (1730–1737)\nAlthough local Lenape individuals had been resettling westward since at least 1690, and despite the cession of most indigenous lands to colonists, agreed to by Lenape leader Sassoonan in 1718, the Okehocking continued to live on their land until at least 1730. The difficulty of maintaining their traditional lifestyle due to the introduction of European goods prompted the band and the nearby Brandywine band to leave their traditional land sometime between 1730 and 1735.  Although it has been suggested that part of the band may have split off in 1718 and joined Sasoonan at the settlement of Tulpehocken, there is no evidence for this. It has also been suggested that the Okehocking joined the Schuylkill band in moving to the multiethnic settlement of Shamokin in 1732, which there is also no direct evidence for. The band spent a period of about 30 years on the tract, comparable to other Lenape horticultural villages.\nIn 1737, some Okehocking were living in a settlement on Swatara Creek, about  away from their former lands. Marshall Becker suggests that this site may have been the village of Quittaphilla, in present-day Lebanon, or one of its \"satellite locations\". Quittaphilla was probably abandoned in 1748. The Okehocking do not appear in historical accounts after 1737, and most likely joined other Lenape in continuing their migration westward.\nIn 1860, the name \"Okahocki\" was recorded by Henry Lewis Morgan as a sub-clan of the Turtle clan on the Lenape reservation in Kansas. In 1913,  Harrington noted that social groups called the \"Okehoki\" and \"Opinghoki\" still existed among the Kansas Lenape. Becker suggests that these may be the descendants of the Okehocking, and that the band continued to exist as a social unit until the 20th century.\nSee also\n*Okehocking Historic District, about  west of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n* Becker, Marshall J.
