The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The category was not formally created until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards were not competitive, as there were no nominees but simply a winner every year that was voted on by the Board of Governors of the Academy. Three Italian films received Honorary Awards during this period. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, thirty-three Italian films have been nominated, and eleven films have won the award. Among all countries that have submitted films for the award, Italy ranks first in terms of films that have won the award, followed by France (twelve awards) and Japan (five awards), and second in terms of nominees, behind France (forty-two nominations) and ahead of Spain (twenty-one nominations).Federico Fellini won four times, the most for any director in the history, and had three other films submitted to the category.\nThe only Italian directors to win multiple awards are Federico Fellini and Vittorio De Sica. Fellini received four awards for La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, 8½, and Amarcord, the most in the history of the Academy, and had other three other films submitted but not nominated. De Sica received two Honorary Awards for Shoeshine and The Bicycle Thief and two competitive wins for Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow and The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, alongside a nomination for Marriage Italian Style.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Before the award was created, the Board of Governors of the Academy voted on a film every year that was considered the best foreign language film released in the United States, and there were no submissions.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Italy for review by the Academy for the award since its conception.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
