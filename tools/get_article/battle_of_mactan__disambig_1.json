Magellan, a Portuguese-born commander serving the Spanish Empire who led an expedition that ultimately circumnavigated the world for the first time, commanded a small Spanish contingent in an effort to subdue Mactan under the Spanish crown. The sheer number of Lapulapu's forces, compounded with issues associated with the location and the armor, ultimately resulted in a disastrous defeat for the Europeans and the death of Magellan. Surviving members of Magellan's crew continued the expedition under the command of Juan Sebastian de Elcano, who completed the journey in September 1522.\nThe battle's exact details are lost to history, with Antonio Pigafetta's account being the only source for much of the known information today. It is remembered in the Philippines as the first battle won by a native Filipino against Spanish forces, with Lapulapu being hailed as the country's first national hero. The Spanish Empire would continue to send expeditions to the archipelago with little to no success until Miguel Lopez de Legazpi's expedition to Cebu and Manila in 1565, starting a 333-year Spanish rule on the archipelago.\nBackground\nMagellan's expedition had left Spain in August 1519 on a mission to find a westward route to the Moluccas or Spice Islands. On March 16, 1521 (Julian calendar), Magellan sighted the mountains of what is now Samar. This event marked the arrival of the first documented Europeans in the archipelago. The following day, Magellan ordered his men to anchor their ships on the shores of Homonhon Island.\nThere, Magellan befriended Rajah Kolambu and Rajah Siagu, king of Limasawa, who guided him to Cebu. There he met Rajah Humabon, the Rajah of Cebu. Then, Rajah Humabon and his queen were baptized into the Catholic faith, taking the Christian names Carlos, in honor of King Charles I of Spain, and Juana, in honor of King Charles' mother, Joanna the Mad. To commemorate this event, Magellan gave Juana the Santo Niño, an image of the infant Jesus, as a symbol of their new alliance and held their first Mass on the coast.\nAs a result of Magellan's influence with Rajah Humabon, an order was issued to each of the nearby chiefs, to provide food supplies for the ships, and to convert to Christianity.\nMost chiefs obeyed.  Datu Lapulapu, one of the two chiefs on the island of Mactan, was the only one to show opposition: he refused to accept the authority of Rajah Humabon in these matters. This opposition proved influential. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's voyage chronicler, wrote that Zula, the island's other chief, sent one of his sons to Magellan with gifts but Lapulapu prevented the journey and refused to swear fealty to Spain.\nRajah Humabon and Datu Zula suggested that Magellan go to Mactan to force the Datu's compliance. Magellan saw an opportunity to strengthen the existing friendship ties with the ruler of the Visayan region and agreed to help him subdue the resistant Lapulapu.\nBattle\nUpon landing, Magellan's small force was immediately attacked by the natives with a heavy barrage of ranged weapons, consisting of arrows, iron-tipped \"bamboo\" throwing spears (probably rattan bangkaw), fire-hardened sticks, and even stones. They surrounded Magellan's landing party, attacking from the front and both flanks. The heavy armor of the Spaniards largely protected them from this barrage, inflicting only a handful of fatalities on the Europeans, but it was heavily demoralizing on the troops.\nThe musketeers and crossbowmen on the boat tried to provide support by firing from the boats. Though the light armor and the shields of the natives were vulnerable to European projectile weapons, the barrage had little effect, as they were firing from an extreme distance and the natives easily avoided them. Due to the same distance, Magellan could not command them to stop and save their ammunition, and the musketeers and crossbowmen continued firing for half an hour until their ammunition was exhausted.\nMagellan, hoping to ease the attack, set fire to some of the houses, but this only enraged the natives. Magellan was finally hit with a poisoned arrow through his unarmored legs, at which time the natives charged the Europeans for close-quarters combat.\nMany of the warriors specifically attacked Magellan. In the struggle, he was wounded in the arm with a spear and in the leg by a large native sword (likely a kampilan). Those who stood beside him were easily overpowered and killed, while others who tried to help him were hacked with spears and swords. With this advantage, Lapulapu's troops finally overwhelmed and killed Magellan. Pigafetta and a few others managed to escape.\nAccording to Pigafetta, several of Magellan's men were killed in battle, and a number of native converts to Catholicism who had come to their aid were immediately killed by the warriors.\nMagellan's allies, Humabon and Zula, were said to not have participated in the battle, at Magellan's bidding. They watched from a distance.\nMagellan's Death: according to Antonio Pigafetta's Journal\nThe only known primary source of the Magellan expedition, titled the Primo viaggio intorno al mondo (English: First Voyage Around the World), contains Pigafetta's personal recount and vivid description of Ferdinand Magellan's death.\nAs said in EyeWitness to history, Pigafetta writes that Magellan, in an attempt to show off his power and scare the local Mactan tribes into obedience, took most of his men to storm the beach and attack the natives. He ordered the men on his ship to fire upon the natives with their muskets and cannons, however, Magellan made a strategic error, not taking into account the reef that stands between the beach and his ship. The distance to the ship was too great, so the cannons and muskets were not able to reach the natives.\nUpon seeing this, the furious Mactans fired arrows back at Magellan. His response was sending a couple men to burn down the natives' houses. This only further enraged the natives, causing them to rush Magellan's men and hurl spears and arrows at the Spaniards' vulnerable legs. Amidst the chaos, Magellan's right leg was wounded with a poisoned arrow. He then ordered his men to retreat, but they ignored him and continued to engage in the battle.\nWith both parties refusing to back down, the battle lasted for over an hour. After Magellan sustained a significant injury to his arm, the natives focused their attack on him. After being wounded in his left leg, Magellan collapsed. Multiple Mactan warriors then rushed him with their spears and killed the captain.\nAftermath\nDatu Lapulapu's warriors recovered the body of Magellan. Humabon demanded the bodies of Magellan and of some of Magellan's dead crew, in return for as much merchandise as the warriors wished, but they refused.\nSome of the soldiers who survived the battle and returned to Cebu were poisoned at a feast given by Humabon. Magellan was succeeded by Juan Sebastián Elcano as commander of the expedition. After Humabon's betrayal, he ordered an immediate departure. Elcano and his fleet sailed west. They reached Spain in 1522, completing the first circumnavigation of the world.\nIn Philippine culture\nbuilt by the Spanish.]]\nIn Philippine history, the \"victory of Mactan\" is considered to have delayed the Spanish colonization of the Philippines by 44&nbsp;years until the conquest by Miguel López de Legazpi in 1564–1565. Today, Lapulapu is retroactively honored as the first \"Philippine national hero\" to resist foreign rule.\nLapulapu is remembered by a number of commemorations: statues on the island of Mactan and at the Cebu Provincial Capitol, a city bearing his name, and a local variety of Red Grouper fish. Kapampangan actor-turned-politician Lito Lapid starred in a film called Lapu-Lapu, and novelty singer Yoyoy Villame wrote a folk song entitled \"Magellan\" that tells a humorously distorted story of the Battle of Mactan.\nThere is a spot in Mactan Island called the \"Mactan shrine\" where the historic battle is reenacted along the mangrove shorelines of the shrine during its anniversary and culminated with the Rampada Festival, a festival reenacting the victory celebration of Mactan after the battle. Appropriately called the \"Victory of Mactan\" (Cebuano: Kadaugan sa Mactan), the reenactment is considered as a grand celebration for Cebuanos and one of Cebu's prime festivals together with the Sinulog of Cebu. Usually, during the re-enactment, Filipino celebrities, especially of Cebuano origin, play Lapu-Lapu, his wife Reyna Bulakna, and Ferdinand Magellan.\nThe inhabitants of the Sulu archipelago believe that Lapulapu was a Muslim of the Sama-Bajau.\nOn April 27, 2017, in honoring Lapulapu as the first hero who resisted foreign rule in the country, the date April 27 when the battle happened was declared by President Rodrigo Duterte as Lapulapu Day.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/magellan.htm The Death of Magellan according to Pigafetta]\n*[http://www.bulatlat.com/news/2-14/2-14-magellan.html Reliving the Battle of Mactan]\n*[http://living.cebunetwork.com/battle-of-mactan-shrine/2006/05/08/ Battle of Mactan: History and Myth]"
