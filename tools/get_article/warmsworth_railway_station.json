It was built ready for the opening of the line on 1 May 1916 with flanking platforms and facilities. However, although the line opened to goods traffic on that date, along with the other stations on the line it never opened for passengers.\nThe only passenger trains to operate over the line were enthusiasts' specials, the last of these being the \"Doncaster Decoy\" on 5 October 1968.\n|next2=|route=Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway |col= |lightcol= }}\n|next2=|route=Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway|col= |lightcol= }}\nReferences\n*Great Central Vol.3 (Fay sets the pace 1900 - 1922) Ian Allan / Locomotive Pub.
