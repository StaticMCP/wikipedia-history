Several dozen elders speak the language, and younger people are learning and trying to sustain it.\nRestoration of tribal land\nIn October 2015, California landowners Bill Richardson, Anna Richardson Granneman and Mary Richardson Zern sold the  of land for several million dollars to The Trust for Public Land. The Trust for Public land established the Kashia coastal Reserve, which restored the Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria access to the Pacific coast after they were forced to an inland reservation approximately 150 years earlier. Archer H Richardson had purchased the property, for $10 in gold coin on October 20, 1925, which features dense redwood forest, towering coastal bluffs, and waterfalls along the Pacific Coast Highway. The Tribe will manage the land as protected open space, and a demonstration forest will be maintained in order to educate and engage the public about the history and practices of indigenous people in the area. Additionally, the Kashia will permit the extension of the California Coastal Trail allowing for public access to their land. Funding for Kashia Coastal Reserve being acquired after five years of fundraising by the Sonoma County government, The Trust for Public Land, private foundations and groups.\nEducation\nThe ranchería is served by the Kashia Elementary School District and Point Arena Joint Union High School District.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Pritzker, Barry M.
