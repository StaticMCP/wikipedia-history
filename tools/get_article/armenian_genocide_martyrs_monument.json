The monument, opened in April 1968, is a tower of eight arches supported on  white concrete columns.}}\nAs part of the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, thousands of Armenians from different parts of Greater Los Angeles area and American politicians gather in Montebello memorial every year on April 24 and lay flowers to the victims of the genocide.\nHistory\nAfter the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in 1965, the Armenian community of Los Angeles decided to build a memorial, which would serve as a permanent location for commemorating the Armenian Genocide victims. They spent months looking for a site in the city of Montebello and came across land that the Bicknell family had dedicated to the city for public use. A group of Armenians led by Michael Minasian who was the founder of the Armenian Monument council started the process of exploring different architectural drawings. On January 12, 1967, the city Approved by a vote of 4-1 the design to build the Armenian Genocide memorial, the headlines read \"CITY ACCEPTS PLANS OF ARMENIAN SHAFT\". Armenians from around the world participated in the fundraising, which gathered $125,000.\nAccording to journalist Garin Hovannisian, the building of the monument was a \"milestone for the Armenians of the United States\". Then he continues, \"it had taken almost three years of city hall meetings, town hall debates, and community fund-raising to consecrate, in public park, a monument\". He also notes that \"ARF, Ramgavar, Armenakan, Apostolic, Catholic, Protestant, and every other category of Armenian converged at Bicknell Park for the opening ceremony\". According to Hovannisian more than ten thousand Armenians attended the dedication ceremony. Then State Senator George Deukmejian, who would later become Governor of California, read Governor Ronald Reagan's proclamation.\nSigns showing the location of the Armenian Genocide Martyr's Monument were installed along California State Route 60 near the Garfield/Wilcox exits on March 22, 2011.\nIn 2025, members of the California State Legislature formally requested that the Memorial be designated a California Historical Landmark. In response, the State Historical Resources Commission unanimously voted to officially designate the monument.\nNotable visitors\n*Ronald Reagan, President of the United States\n*Serzh Sargsyan, President of Armenia\n*Bako Sahakyan, President of Nagorno Karabakh\n*Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor of California\n*Gray Davis, Lieutenant Governor of California\n*Barbara Boxer, US Senator from California\n*Adam Schiff, US Congressman\n*Jackie Speier, US Congresswoman\n*Grace Napolitano, US Congresswoman\n*Michael D.
