The rebels quickly took the towns of Grenville and Gouyave and captured 45/47 hostages including the governor of Grenada Ninian Home. The British who were stationed at Saint George’s carried out various attacks and tried to cut off the revolutionaries’ supply lines. The British decided to attack Fédon’s camp to free hostages and put an end to the revolt and so on the 8th of April 1795, Louis Cazot LaGrenade, officer of the Grenadian coloured militia went to Belvedere with 200 militia troops.\nThe Skirmish\nThe Militia attacked the camp in a charge led by Louis Cazot LaGrenade, however the battle was a failure and the militia were pushed back to St George’s. However Julien Fédon’s brother perished in the skirmish, which infuriated Fedon and incentivised him to carry out his threat of executing the captives.\nAftermath\nAfter the skirmish Julien Fédon carried out his threat and executed the hostages including governor Ninian Home, who were killed a few days afterward, the revolutionaries also decided to attack various plantations and freed slaves who joined the revolt (or were forced to join), they also took out various ports and cut the troops on the island off from their supply chain.\nReferences"
