Geologists consider her to be the \"first woman geologist in this country [America].\"\n* 1896: Florence Bascom became the first woman to work for the United States Geological Survey.\n20th Century\n* 1901: Florence Bascom became the first female geologist to present a paper before the Geological Survey of Washington.\n* 1903: Marie Curie became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, awarded in Physics, and went on to also win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. She performed pioneering research in radioactivity, and discovered two elements (polonium and radium).\n* 1912: Henrietta Swan Leavitt studied the bright-dim cycle periods of Cepheid stars, then found a way to calculate the distance from such stars to Earth.[http://web.mit.edu/~invent/iow/leavitt.html Lemelson-MIT Program]\n* 1924: Florence Bascom became the first woman elected to the Council of the Geological Society of America.\n* 1925: Florence Sabin became the first woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n* 1928: Alice Evans became the first woman elected president of the Society of American Bacteriologists.\n* 1936: Edith Patch became the first female president of the Entomological Society of America.\n1940s\n* 1942: American geologist Marguerite Williams became the first African-American woman to receive a PhD in geology in the United States.

It was known as the A-0 compiler.[http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/?year=1952 Computer History Museum | Timeline of Computer History : Year 1952 Entries]\n* 1956: The Wu experiment was a nuclear physics experiment conducted in 1956 by the physicist Chien-Shiung Wu, born in China but having become an American citizen in 1954, in collaboration with the Low Temperature Group of the US National Bureau of Standards. That experiment showed that parity could be violated in weak interaction.\n1960s\n* 1960: Rosalyn Yalow received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones\" along with Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally who received it \"for their discoveries concerning the peptide hormone production of the brain\".\n* 1962: Katherine Johnson performed the calculations for the NASA orbital mission, launching John Glenn as the first person into orbit and returning them safely.\n* 1963: Maria Goeppert Mayer became the first American woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics; she shared the prize with J. Hans D. Jensen \"for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure” and Eugene Paul Wigner \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\". She was born in Poland, but became a U.S. citizen in 1933.\n* 1965: Sister Mary Kenneth Keller became the first American woman to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science. Her thesis was titled \"Inductive Inference on Computer Generated Patterns.\"\n1970s\n* 1975: Chien-Shiung Wu, born in China but having become an American citizen in 1954, became the first female president of the American Physical Society.\n* 1976: Margaret Burbidge, born in England, was named as the first female president of the American Astronomical Society.[http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/brucemedalists/burbidgem/ The Bruce Medalists: Margaret Burbidge]\n*1977: Rosalyn Yalow received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones\"; she shared it with Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally \"for their discoveries concerning the peptide hormone production of the brain.\"\n* 1978: Anna Jane Harrison became the first female president of the American Chemical Society.\n* 1978: Mildred Cohn served as the first female president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, then called the American Society of Biological Chemists.\n1980s\n*1982: Nephrologist Leah Lowenstein became the first woman dean of a co-educational medical school in the United States.\n* 1983: Barbara McClintock received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery of genetic transposition; she was the first woman to receive that prize without sharing it, and the first American woman to receive any unshared Nobel Prize.[http://issuu.com/bibliotecabiologia/docs/bionoticias_27-02-2012/102 ISSUU - BioNoticias by Biblioteca Biología]\n*1984: Kathryn D.
