It is one of the three  municipalities in Kasaragod district; the others are Kasaragod and Kanhangad. Nileshwaram is located on the estuary of Kavvayi Backwaters and Neeleshwaram River (also known as Thejaswini River). Nileshwaram is referred to as the cultural capital of Kasaragod, the northernmost district of Kerala. \"The first Chief Minister of Kerala and communist leader E. M. S. Namboodiripad,Kamaran Nair had contested elections to the Assembly from the Neeleswaram segment.\"\nHistory\nNeeleswaram, or Nileswaram, is the abbreviated form of Neelakanteshweram. The  Kolathiri  Dominion  emerged  into  independent 10 principalities in the late medieval period, i.e., Kadathanadu (Vadakara), Randathara or Poyanad (Dharmadom), Kottayam (Thalassery), Nileshwaram, Iruvazhinadu (Panoor), Kurumbranad etc., under separate royal chieftains due to the outcome of internal dissensions. Many portions of the present-day Hosdurg taluk (Kanhangad) and Vellarikundu were parts of the Nileshwaram dynasty, who were relatives to both Kolathunadu as well as Zamorin of Calicut, in the early medieval period. Nileshwaram was historically the  seat of the Neeleswaram Rajahs, who belonged to the clans of the Kolathiri and Zamorins. The Nileshwar Rajahs and the Bednore Nayaks battled in this area.\nThe grand finale of the annual temple festival season takes place in this area, which is known for its \"kavus\", or sacred groves. The most famous of the sacred groves is the Mannampurathu Kavu. The town is also known for Theyyam, the ritualistic art forms. Also Nileshwar is the first town in Kerala famous for cultivating 'Chengthengu' (red dwarf coconut).\nIn 1918, the Rajah's High School was established, it was one of the first north Kerala schools of its kind. The school retains a letter written to the students by Mahatma Gandhi on his way in 1928 to Mangalore. It was part of a broad appeal for people to rally behind the national movement.\nin 2024, 150 people were injured by fireworks at Theru Anjootambalam Veererkavu temple.\nAdministration\nNileshwar Municipality and surrounding Panchayats are administered by Nileshwar Block Panchayat.
