Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season ended March 12, 2020. As a result, the NCAA did not bestow a national championship. Instead, that title was de facto bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.\nAs such, South Carolina finished the season first in both wire rankings, on December 31, 2020, raised a banner to make a claim to such a mythical national championship.  This banner is located between their 2017 and 2022 NCAA championship banners, and is of the same size as those, at their home venue, Colonial Life Arena.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid

It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\n|Week2Date = Nov 19\n|Week3Date = Nov 26\n|Week4Date = Dec 3\n|Week5Date = Dec 10\n|Week6Date = Dec 17\n|Week7Date = Dec 24\n|Week8Date = Dec
