This is for the 2001 season. Due to the events of September 11, 2001, all college football games were suspended during the following weekend. As a result, the poll released on September 18 was a repeat of the one released a week earlier.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px
