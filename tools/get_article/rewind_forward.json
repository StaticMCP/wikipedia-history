It includes the song \"Feeling the Sunlight\", written by Paul McCartney.\nComposition\nStarr wrote the EP's title track with engineer and frequent co-writer Bruce Sugar, and stated: \"We've been writing a song now for every EP.\" The opening track on the EP, \"Shadows on the Wall\", was written by Steve Lukather and Joseph Williams, members of Starr's All-Starr Band and members of the rock band Toto. Paul McCartney, formerly a member of the Beatles alongside Starr, wrote the track \"Feeling the Sunlight\". The final track on the EP, \"Miss Jean\", was written by former Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers members Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell, along with Ian Hunter.\nRegarding the EP's title, Starr stated:\n\"Rewind Forward was something I said out of the blue — it's just one of those lines like \"A Hard Day's Night\". It just came to me. But it doesn't really make sense. I was trying to explain it to myself and the best I can tell you about what it means is: Sometimes when you want to go forward you have to go back first.\nRecording\nRecording sessions mainly occurred in 2023. \"Shadows on the Wall\", \"Rewind Forward\" and \"Miss Jean\" were recorded at Starr's home studio in Los Angeles, California, while \"Feeling the Sunlight\" was primarily recorded in the UK.\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2          = Feeling the Sunlight\n| writer2         = Paul McCartney\n| length2         = 3:06\n| title3          = Rewind Forward\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 3:30\n| title4          = Miss Jean\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 4:44\n| total_length    = 14:50\n}}\nPersonnel\n*Ringo Starr – vocals, drums, percussion (all tracks)\n*Steve Lukather – guitar (1)\n*Joseph Williams – backing vocals (1)\n*Torrance Klein – bass guitar (1)\n*Paul McCartney – backing vocals, bass guitar, electric guitar, keyboards, zither (2)\n*Bruce Sugar – keyboards (3)\n*Joe Walsh, Steve Dudas – guitar (3)\n*Kipp Lennon, Marky Lennon – backing vocals (3)\n*Matt Bissonette – bass guitar (3)\n*Mike Campbell – backing vocals, guitar (both on 4)\n*Benmont Tench – piano (4)\n*Lance Morrison – bass guitar (4)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Rewind Forward\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Hot Albums (Billboard Japan)\n| 67\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
