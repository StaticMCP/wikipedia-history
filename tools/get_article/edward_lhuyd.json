He was the second Keeper of the University of Oxford's Ashmolean Museum, and published the first catalogue of fossils, the .\nName\nLhuyd is an archaic spelling of the same Welsh surname now usually rendered as Lloyd or Llwyd, from }} ('grey'). It also appears frequently as Lhwyd; less often as Lhwydd, Llhwyd, Llwid and Floyd; and latinized as ( or ) , frequently abbreviated , and as  and  in some scientific names. The English and Latin forms are also sometimes combined as Edward Luidius.\nLife\nLhuyd was born in 1660, in Loppington, Shropshire, England, the illegitimate son of Edward Llwyd or Lloyd of Llanforda, Oswestry, and Bridget Pryse of Llansantffraid, near Talybont, Cardiganshire, in 1660. His family belonged to the gentry of southwest Wales. Though well established, the family was not wealthy. His father experimented with agriculture and industry in a manner that impinged on the new science of the day. The son attended and later taught at Oswestry Grammar School, and in 1682 went up to Jesus College, Oxford, but dropped out before graduation. In 1684, he was appointed to assist Robert Plot, Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum (which at that time was in Broad Street), and became the second Keeper himself in 1690, holding the post until his death in 1709.\nWhile working at the Ashmolean Museum, Lhuyd travelled extensively. A visit to Snowdonia in 1688 allowed him to compile for John Ray's  a list of flora local to that region. After 1697, Lhuyd visited every county in Wales, then travelled to Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany and the Isle of Man. In 1699, it became possible through funding from his friend Isaac Newton for him to publish the first catalogue ever of fossils, his . These had been collected in England, mostly in Oxford, and are now held in the Ashmolean.\nLhuyd received a MA honoris causa from the University of Oxford in 1701 and a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1708.\nIn 1696, Lluyd transcribed much of the Latin inscription on the 9th-century Pillar of Eliseg near Valle Crucis Abbey, Denbighshire. The inscription subsequently became almost illegible due to weathering, but Lhuyd's transcript seems to have been remarkably accurate.\nLhuyd was also responsible for the first scientific description and naming of what we would now recognize as a dinosaur: the sauropod tooth Rutellum impicatum.\ntrilobite O. debuchii]]\nThe first written record of a trilobite was by Lhuyd in a letter to Martin Lister in 1688 and published (1689) in his Lithophylacii Britannici Ichnographia. It is a fleeting mention and he simply identifies his find as a \"skeleton of some flat fish\". The trilobite is nowadays identified as Ogygiocarella debuchii Brongniart, 1822.\nPioneering linguist\nIn the late 17th century, Lhuyd was contacted by a group of scholars led by John Keigwin of Mousehole, who sought to preserve and further the Cornish language. He accepted their invitation to travel there and study the language. Early Modern Cornish was the subject of a paper published by Lhuyd in 1702; it differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar.\nIn 1707, having been assisted in his research by a fellow scholar, Moses Williams, Lhuyd published the first volume of Archæologia Britannica. This has an important linguistic description of Cornish, which is noted all the more for the understanding of historical linguistics it shows. Some of the ideas commonly attributed to linguists of the 19th century have their roots in this work by Lhuyd, who was \"considerably more sophisticated in his methods and perceptions than [[William Jones (philologist)|[William] Jones]]\".\nLhuyd noted a similarity between two language families: Brythonic or P–Celtic (Breton, Cornish and Welsh) and Goidelic or Q–Celtic (Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic). He argued that both families were derived from the Continental Celtic languages; the Brythonic languages originated in the Gaulish language once spoken and written by the Gauls of Pre-Roman France and the Goidelic languages are derived from the Celtiberian language once spoken in the Pre-Roman Iberian Peninsula, which includes modern Spain and Portugal. He concluded that as these languages were of Celtic origin, those who spoke them were Celts. From the 18th century, peoples of Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales were known increasingly as Celts. They are seen to this day as modern Celtic nations.\nDeath and legacy\nOn his travels, Lhuyd developed asthma, which eventually led to his death from pleurisy in Oxford in 1709. He died in his room in the Ashmolean Museum, aged just 49, and was buried in the Welsh aisle of the church of St Michael at the Northgate.\nThe Cretaceous bryozoan species  (originally described as Membranipora lhuydi) is named in his honour. The Snowdon lily (Gagea serotina) was for a time called Lloydia serotina after Lhuyd.\nCymdeithas Edward Llwyd, the National Naturalists' Society of Wales, is named after him. On 9 June 2001 a bronze bust of him was unveiled by Dafydd Wigley, a former Plaid Cymru leader, outside the University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies in Aberystwyth, next to the National Library of Wales. The sculptor was John Meirion Morris; the inscription on the plinth, carved by Ieuan Rees, reads \"\" (\"linguist, antiquary, naturalist\").\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* .\n* .\n*  }}.\n* .\n* .\n* .\n*  |page=834}}.\n*  |url=https://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/learning/geology.htm }}.\n*  }}.\n*  |title=Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales, with an Introductory Compendium of the General Principles of That Science and Comparative Views of the Structure of Foreign Countries |location=London |publisher=William Phillips }}.\n*  |contribution=The Earliest Discoveries of Dinosaurs: The Records Re-examined |title=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association |volume=113 |year=2002 |issue=3 |pages=185–197 |doi=10.1016/S0016-7878(02)80022-0 |bibcode=2002PrGA..113..185D}}.\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n*  |date=2018 |title=Nuncius |volume=33 |pages=1–32 |contribution-url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/33873/3/NUN_033_03_005_s005_Roos-Rose_proof-01%20(1).pdf |contribution=Lives and Afterlives of the Lithophylacii Britannici Ichnographia (1699), the First Illustrated Field Guide to English Fossils |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |access-date=15 December 2023 |archive-date=15 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231115201950/http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/33873/3/NUN_033_03_005_s005_Roos-Rose_proof-01%20(1).pdf |url-status=dead }}.\nFurther reading\n* Brynley Roberts, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=9Z-TEAAAQBAJ Edward Lhwyd, c.1660-1709, Naturalist, Antiquary, Philologist], University of Wales Press, 2022 (Scientists of Wales)\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040515043221/http://www.aber.ac.uk/gwydd-cym/english/edwardllwyd-e.htm Biography of Edward Lhuyd] from the Canolfan Edward Llwyd, a centre for the study of science through Welsh"
