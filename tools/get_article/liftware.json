The company which designed the projects, Lift Labs, was founded by Anupam Pathak, a University of Michigan Ph.D. student.\nThe device works by detecting tremors with an accelerometer then responding to them with an actuator. The product first became available in December 2013.\nLift Labs (which made the Liftware spoon) was acquired by Google in September 2014 for integration into then life sciences division of Google X. Anupam Pathak became the technical lead for the division.\nGoogle launched its version of the spoon in November 2014, priced at $195.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://vimeo.com/user15993486 Videos demonstrating product]\n* [http://uofmhealthblogs.org/neurohealth/shaky-hand-stable-spoon-high-tech-help-essential-tremor/11679/ Shaky hand, stable spoon: High-tech help for essential tremor] - medical review"
