According to Woodward, it is not true that eleven critics of Escrivá's canonization were heard. He says there was only one. He says the \"consultors\" were mainly Italian and members of Opus Dei: this stopped Escrivá's many critical Spanish peers from upsetting the procedure, but it also broke the convention that \"consultors\" should be fellow countrymen of the proposed saint. He also said that Opus Dei's position was that Escrivá was too \"international\" to need this.\nBibliography\n* Grandparents/Grandchildren: The Vital Connection (with Arthur Kornhaber), Doubleday (New York, NY), 1981.\n* ''Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a Saint, Who Doesn't, and Why, Simon & Schuster (New York, NY), 1990.\n* The Book of Miracles: The Meaning of the Miracle Stories in Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam'', Simon & Schuster (New York, NY), 2000.\nWoodward has written over a hundred Newsweek cover stories.
