Based on the terms of the accord, the United Provinces could maintain sovereignty over the Scheldt Estuary but had to provide several concessions to the Habsburgs, including the payment of ten million Dutch florins and the dismemberment of certain military fortifications. Overall, the treaty confirmed and reinforced the tenets of the Treaty of Münster.\nThe treaty was signed after the Kettle War.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\n*Redemptiedorpen\nReferences"
