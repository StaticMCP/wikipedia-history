It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) at least once every five years by the first-past-the-post electoral system. The constituency has been represented by Karl Turner of the Labour Party since the 2010 general election.\nHistory\nIn the early years of the constituency, it continually changed hands between the Conservative Party and the then-Liberal Party. Kingston upon Hull East has returned Labour MPs since 1935, and from 1945 to 2010 was represented by only two members, former seamen, Harry Pursey and John Prescott (who became Deputy Prime Minister, at the time in charge of town and country planning policy).\nConstituency profile\nThe constituency covers most of the city of Kingston upon Hull east of the River Hull, excluding the Bransholme estate which lies in the Kingston upon Hull North and Cottingham constituency. It is a constituency of diversity; divided by Holderness Road, it can be split into two very separate areas. It includes the now-redeveloped residential Victoria Docks, which can be considered alongside Sutton Village, Garden Village and the private housing suburbs to the north of East Park. Away from the prestigious dockside developments and middle-class suburbs, the southern area of the constituency is largely social housing with a large amount of unemployment and underemployment alongside the vast docks and industrial estates.\nBoundaries\n|frame=yes|frame-width=260|text=Map of boundaries 2010–2024}}\n1885–1918: The Municipal Borough of Hull wards of Alexandra, Beverley, Drypool, Sutton, and part of Central.\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Hull wards of Alexandra, Drypool, and Southcoates.\n1950–1955: The County Borough of Hull wards of Alexandra, Drypool, Marfleet, Southcoates, Stoneferry, and Sutton.\n1955–1974: The County Borough of Hull wards of Alexandra, Drypool, East Central, Marfleet, Myton, Southcoates, Stoneferry, and Sutton.\n1974–1983: The County Borough of Hull wards of Bransholme, Drypool, Greatfield, Holderness, Longhill, Marfleet, Stoneferry, and Sutton.\n1983–2010: The City of Kingston upon Hull wards of Drypool, Holderness, Ings, Longhill, Marfleet, Southcoates, and Sutton.\n2010–2024: The City of Kingston upon Hull wards of Drypool, Holderness, Ings, Longhill, Marfleet, Southcoates East, Southcoates West, and Sutton.\n2024–present: The City of Kingston upon Hull wards of Drypool, Holderness, Ings, Longhill & Bilton Grange, Marfleet, North Carr, Southcoates, and Sutton.\n:Seat expanded to bring its electorate within the permitted range by adding the North Carr ward from Kingston upon Hull North.\nMembers of Parliament\nKingston upon Hull prior to 1885\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1885\n| William Saunders\n| Liberal\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1886\n| Frederick Brent Grotrian\n| Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1892\n| Clarence Smith\n| Liberal\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1895\n| Thomas Firbank\n| Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1906\n| Thomas Ferens\n| Liberal\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1918\n| Charles Murchison\n| Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1922\n| Roger Lumley\n| Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1929\n| George Muff\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1931\n| John Nation\n| Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1935\n| George Muff\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1945\n| Harry Pursey\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1970\n| John Prescott\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 2010\n| Karl Turner\n| Labour\n|}\nElections\nElections in the 2020s\n}}\nElections in the 2010s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2019 notional result\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|\n| Labour ||align=right| 14,134 ||align=right| 41.6\n|-\n|\n| Conservative ||align=right| 11,639 ||align=right| 34.3\n|-\n|\n| Brexit Party ||align=right| 5,710 ||align=right| 16.8\n|-\n|\n| Liberal Democrats ||align=right| 1,685 ||align=right| 5.0\n|-\n|\n| Green ||align=right| 785 ||align=right| 2.3\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"#EAECF0\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|Turnout\n|align=right|33,953\n|align=right|46.8\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|Electorate\n|align=right|72,622\n|}\n}}\nThe turnout of 49.3% in Kingston upon Hull East was the lowest in any constituency in the United Kingdom at the 2019 general election, and was the only example of a seat where fewer than half of the eligible electorate voted.
