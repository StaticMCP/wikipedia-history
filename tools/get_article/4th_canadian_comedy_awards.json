The ceremony was held in 2003 in London, Ontario, concluding the three-day Canadian Comedy Awards Festival.  The ceremony was hosted by the Royal Canadian Air Farce.\nCanadian Comedy Awards, also known as Beavers, were awarded in 19 categories. Winners were picked by members of ACTRA (Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists), the Canadian Actors' Equity Association, the Writers Guild of Canada, the Directors Guild of Canada, and the Comedy Association.\nFor the second consecutive year nominations were led by TV series Made in Canada with seven nominations, followed by the films Men with Brooms and Rub & Tug with six apiece.  Made in Canada and This Hour Has 22 Minutes each won two Beavers, as did Mike Myers for Goldmember.\nFestival and ceremony\nThe Canadian Comedy Awards had been televised in 2000 and 2001, but due to a lack of sponsorship the broadcasts stopped in 2002 and the awards ceremony was scaled-back. In 2003 the Canadian Comedy Foundation for Excellence (CCFE) was incorporated as a non-profit to organize the awards and the accompanying Canadian Comedy Awards Festival, a three-day comedy festival held in London, Ontario.  The festival took advantage of having the nominees in sketch, stand-up and improv comedy together in one place, and showcase performances led up to the awards ceremony.\nThe 4th awards ceremony was hosted by the Royal Canadian Air Farce, who had been inducted into the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame two years earlier.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface:\nLive\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
