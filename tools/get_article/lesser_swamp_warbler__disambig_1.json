It is a resident breeder in Africa from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Chad and Ethiopia south to South Africa. This is a common species of reedbeds in standing water.\nDescription\nThe lesser swamp warbler is a plain-coloured smallish bird 14–16&nbsp;cm long and weighing around 20 g. Its upperparts are rich brown, and it has a white supercilium. The underparts are white, with a rufous wash to the flanks. The long, strong bill has a slightly down-curved upper mandible; it is blackish-yellow with a yellower base. The legs are blue-grey and the eyes are brown. Adults of both sexes and juvenile birds are very similar in appearance.\nThe song is rich and melodious, a series of bubbly phrases that include trilling notes, cheerup chee trrreee and a large number of variations, with pauses between phrases.\nBehaviour\nThe lesser swamp warbler builds a deep, firm cup nest from strips of reed blades, grass and sedges, which is lined with finer grasses. It is always placed in reeds above water. It nests mainly from August to December, with the earliest nesters being those in the winter rainfall areas of the Western Cape Province. It lays two or three brown eggs.  This species is monogamous, pairing for life.\nThe lesser swamp warbler is usually seen alone or in pairs, moving through wetland reedbeds, and clambering up and down reed stems. It eats insects and other small invertebrates.\nConservation status\nThis common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 5,700,000&nbsp;km2. The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.\nSubspecies\nAcrocephalus gracilirostris includes the following subspecies:\n* A. g. neglectus - (Alexander, 1908)\n* A. g. tsanae - (Bannerman, 1937)\n* A. g. jacksoni - (Neumann, 1901)\n* A. g. parvus - (Fischer, GA & Reichenow, 1884)\n* A. g. leptorhynchus - (Reichenow, 1879)\n* A. g. winterbottomi - (White, CMN, 1947)\n* A. g. cunenensis - (Hartert, 1903)\n* A. g. gracilirostris - (Hartlaub, 1864)\nGallery\nImage: Acrocephalus gracillirostris Cape Reed Warbler Lesser Swamp Warbler 2012 05 08 6303.JPG|A. gracilirostris on perch in bulrush\nImage: Acrocephalus gracillirostris Cape Reed Warbler Lesser Swamp Warbler 2012 05 08 6315.JPG|A. gracilirostris scratching itself while preening\nReferences\n* Ian Sinclair, Phil Hockey and Warwick Tarboton, SASOL Birds of Southern Africa (Struik 2002)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182118/http://www.birdlife.org.za/fieldguide/book/species_info.php?id=80 SASOL e-guide]\n*[http://www.birdsinsa.com/birds/acrocephalusgracilirostris.htm Birds of Southern Africa]\nExternal links\n* Lesser swamp warbler - [http://sabap2.adu.org.za/docs/sabap1/635.pdf Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds]."
