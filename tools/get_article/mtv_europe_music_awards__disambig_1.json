It was originally conceived as an alternative to the MTV Video Music Awards, which are hosted annually in the United States. The Europe Music Awards are held every year in a different country; it has been hosted mostly in the United Kingdom and Germany. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest.\nThe awards are a reflection of the international and continental music scene. They are representative of geographical origin and of achievement in diverse musical genres and disciplines, indicative of the diversity and scope of the show.

During his acceptance speech after winning the award for Best Rock, Bon Jovi lead singer Jon Bon Jovi stated, \"The only enemy is ignorance. Peace, people. Let's get rid of all this nuclear testing\", while U2's Bono said, \"What a city, what a night, what a crowd, what a bomb, what a mistake, what a wanker you have for a President.\" referring to nuclear testing.

The MTV executives told the band that they weren't allowed to use any curse words during their time on live TV, and upset with the scripted, family-friendly MTV antics, Metallica simply played non-TV friendly songs. The song \"So What?\" is known for its amount of expletives and references to bestiality among many other controversial lyrics while \"Last Caress\" has lyrics pertaining to murder and rape. As a result of their performance Metallica's performance and references to Metallica have been removed from future broadcasts of the ceremony.\n1997: U2 opened the show performing \"Mofo\" dressed in boxing gowns.

The performance of the Spice Girls during the ceremony was the last before their breakup. The most elaborate appearance was probably by Jennifer Lopez, who literally landed on stage in an aeroplane. The performance was a world premiere of her new song, \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\", taken from her forthcoming album, J.Lo. Madonna paid tribute to fellow performer Kylie Minogue by appearing on stage in a T-shirt bearing the name \"Kylie\". Madonna performed Music (Madonna song), one month after giving birth to son, Rocco, with a screen background of clips reminiscent of her long career.

Robbie Williams won Best Song for \"Rock DJ\", but he told the audience: \"I am not going to say anything bad about people's choices on this one, but I think it's a terrible song and a silly song.\" He also referred to his roots in Stoke-on-Trent, saying: \"When I was growing up I dreamt of being a pop star and I would like to thank MTV for my three houses, my five cars and my supermodel girlfriend.\"\n, venue in 2001 and 2012.]]\n2001: The ceremony was the first entertainment broadcasts following the September 11th attacks in New York City.

Albarn, in a response to the recent invasion of Afghanistan said \"So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [pointing to the tee shirt] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing one of the poorest countries in the world is wrong.

Kelly responded by calling Aguilera's music \"crap\" and saying she was a \"cow.\" Later, a skit was aired of Christina Aguilera throwing darts at a board decorated with a picture of Kelly Osbourne. This irked the Ozzy offspring, who voiced her disapproval when she came onstage to present an award. Kelly stated, \"If Christina Aguilera has to resort to throwing darts at my head after everything she's achieved and everything she's done, then she's a really sad, sorry person\". Aguilera later retorted with a voice of mock sympathy, saying \"Honey, if you can dish it out, you've got to learn how to take it back\".\nDuring Travis' performance of \"The Beautiful Occupation\" an assembly of nude protesters marched onstage with signs that covered their private areas. At the end of the song, they lifted the signs. While near at the end of performing \"Baby Boy\", Beyoncé and Sean Paul both were up on stage when their backing track suffered a technical difficulty. This went on for a near minute in which both artist and dancers exited the stage while the error went on. This also left confusion among presenter Christina Aguilera, who walked on stage to continue hosting which ended the backing track error. Both artists later decided to retake the performance again. The retake would later replace re-airings of the show and would be the first show to extend time with this retake.\n2004: The show was held at Tor di Valle Racecourse in Rome. The outdoor stage was situated in front of the Colosseum, where artists such as Eminem, Franz Ferdinand, Beastie Boys, and Anastacia performed to an attendance of over 400,000 people.

Madonna returned to the stage to present the Free Your Mind Award to Bob Geldof. \"You drive me crazy, but tonight you are everyone's hero,\" she said.

Timberlake joked that he only won because he agreed to present the event in Copenhagen. Depeche Mode said, \"A big thank you to the fans and a big thank you to MTV for playing our videos for twenty-five years\", after winning the award for Best Group. British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen entertained the audience with his English-mangling character Borat and poked fun at Madonna who was at the time trying to adopt an African child adding: \"My only concern is that this singing transvestite will not be such a good father.\"\nDespite winning the award for Best Hip-Hop, Kanye West apparently was so disappointed at not winning for Best Video that he crashed the stage when the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for \"We Are Your Friends\". In a tirade riddled with expletives, Kanye West said he should have won the prize for his video \"Touch the Sky\", because it \"cost a million dollars, Pamela Anderson was in it. I was jumping across canyons.\" He further said, \"If I don't win, the awards show loses credibility\".\n2007: Foo Fighters opened the show and front man Dave Grohl hosted the backstage area, interviewing celebrities live on air.
