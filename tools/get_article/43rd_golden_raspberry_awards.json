The awards are based on votes from members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation. The nominations were announced on January 22, 2023. The biographical psychological drama Blonde received the most nominations with eight, including Worst Picture and Worst Director (Andrew Dominik), winning the former and Worst Screenplay (Dominik).\nThe Worst Actress nomination of then twelve-year-old Ryan Kiera Armstrong for her performance in the Firestarter remake was the subject of backlash, following which Razzies co-founder John J. B. Wilson issued a public apology and announced that the organization would no longer allow children to be nominated in any category, placing itself in Armstrong's place on the ballot.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Actor winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner and Worst Screen Combo co-winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Screenplay winner]]\n, Razzie Redeemer Award winner]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Blonde (Netflix) – Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Tracey Landon, Brad Pitt, and Scott Robertson'\n** ''Disney's Pinocchio (Disney+) – Derek Hogue, Andrew Milano, Chris Weitz, and Robert Zemeckis\n** Good Mourning (Open Road Films) – Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly), Chris Long, Jib Polhemus, and Mod Sun\n** The King's Daughter (Gravitas Ventures) – David Brookwell, Paul Currie, Wei Han, James Pang Hong, and Sean McNamara\n** Morbius (Columbia) – Avi Arad, Lucas Foster, and Matt Tolmach\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly) and Mod Sun – Good Mourning'\n** Judd Apatow – The Bubble\n** Andrew Dominik – Blonde\n** Daniel Espinosa – Morbius\n** Robert Zemeckis – Disney's Pinocchio\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Jared Leto – Morbius as Dr. Michael Morbius'\n** Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly) – Good Mourning as London Clash\n** Pete Davidson – Marmaduke as Marmaduke (voice only)\n** Tom Hanks – Disney's Pinocchio as Geppetto\n** Sylvester Stallone – Samaritan as Joe Smith / Samaritan / Nemesis\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* The Razzies (for \"Their 43rd Worst Actress Nominations Blunder\")\n** Ryan Kiera Armstrong – Firestarter as Charlene \"Charlie\" McGee}}\n** Bryce Dallas Howard – Jurassic World Dominion as Claire Dearing\n** Diane Keaton – Mack & Rita as Mackenzie \"Mack\" Martin / \"Rita\"\n** Kaya Scodelario – The King's Daughter as Marie-Josèphe\n** Alicia Silverstone – The Requin as Jaelyn\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Tom Hanks – Elvis as Colonel Tom Parker'\n** Pete Davidson – Good Mourning as Berry\n** Xavier Samuel – Blonde as Cass Chaplin\n** Mod Sun – Good Mourning as Dylan\n** Evan Williams – Blonde as Eddy Robinson Jr.\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Adria Arjona – Morbius as Martine Bancroft'\n** Fan Bingbing – The 355 and The King's Daughter as Lin Mi Sheng and The Mermaid\n** Lorraine Bracco – Disney's Pinocchio as Sofia (voice only)\n** Penélope Cruz – The 355 as Graciela Rivera\n** Mira Sorvino – Lamborghini: The Man Behind the Legend as Annita\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Tom Hanks and his latex-laden face (and that ludicrous accent) – Elvis'\n** Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly) and Mod Sun – Good Mourning\n** Both real life characters (Marilyn Monroe and John F.
