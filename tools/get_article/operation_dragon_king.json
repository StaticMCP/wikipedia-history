After General Ne Win and his Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) seized power in a coup in 1962, the government systematically dissolved Rohingya political and social organizations. The end of the liberation war in neighbouring Bangladesh strengthened the Burmese government's fears of \"foreign invaders\" infiltrating their country. Therefore in 1977, the government began its preparations for Operation Dragon King, which commenced early the following year.\nEvents\nThe official purpose of Operation Dragon King was to register citizens in northern Arakan and expel so-called \"foreigners\" from the area prior to a national census. Immigration officials and military personnel conducted the operation together, with the latter being accused by Rohingya refugees of forcibly evicting villagers through intimidation, rape and murder.\nThe operation began on 6 February 1978, beginning in the village of Sakkipara in the Sittwe District, where there were mass round ups of civilians. In the span of over three months, approximately 200,000 to 250,000 refugees, mostly Rohingya Muslims, fled to Bangladesh. The government of Burma estimated that 150,000 fled during the operation, and proclaimed that the mass exodus signified that Rohingyas were in-fact \"illegal immigrants\". The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the government of Bangladesh provided emergency relief to the refugees, but were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis. Bangladesh requested assistance from the United Nations, and a UNHCR relief mission was sent to the region.\nOn 31 July 1978, the governments of Burma and Bangladesh reached an agreement regarding the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, and 180,000 returned to Burma following the agreement.\nSee also\n* Operation Clean and Beautiful Nation\nReferences"
