He previously served as commander, United States Transportation Command from  September 2005 to August 2008. He is currently the president and CEO of the Institute for Defense Analyses, serving since 2 January 2020.\nBackground\nSchwartz grew up in Toms River, New Jersey, The first Jewish Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Schwartz was a member of the U.S. Air Force Academy Jewish choir before his 1973 graduation. In 2004, Schwartz was awarded the Jewish Community Center's Military Leadership Award. In accepting the award, Schwartz said he was \"proud to be identified as Jewish as well as an American military leader.\"\nMilitary career\nSchwartz graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1973. He is an alumnus of the National War College, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a 1994 Fellow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Seminar XXI. He has served as commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command Pacific, as well as Alaskan Command, Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region and the 11th Air Force.\nSchwartz is a USAF Command Pilot with more than 4,400 flying hours in a variety of aircraft. He has flown C-130 Hercules and MC-130 Combat Talon I and Combat Talon II aircraft and MH-53 Pave Low III and Pave Low IV, and MH-60 Black Hawk and Pave Hawk special ops helicopters.  His operational background goes back to the final days of the Vietnam War; at the time, he was a crew member taking part in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon. By 1991 he was chief of staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq during the first Gulf War. He participated as a crew member in the 1975 airlift evacuation of Saigon, and in 1991 served as chief of staff of the Joint Special Operations Task Force for Northern Iraq in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In 1997, he led the Joint Task Force that prepared for the noncombatant evacuation of U.S. citizens in Cambodia. On January 12, 2000, Schwartz was promoted to lieutenant general and received his third-star upon assuming the command of Alaskan Command and Eleventh Air Force.\n9/11 attacks\nDuring the attacks on 11 September 2001, General Schwartz at that time was the commander of Alaskan Command, a joint subordinate unified command of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) which oversees the state of Alaska. At the time of those attacks, all air traffic in United States airspace had been grounded, and most of the flights were being diverted to Canada as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon in response to the attacks. However one aircraft, a Korean Air Boeing 747-400 Flight 85 which was en route to Anchorage International Airport for a stopover with its final destination in New York, John F. Kennedy International Airport, suddenly reported being hijacked and began transmitting the international hijack transponder code. Lieutenant General Schwartz, who was in charge of the Alaskan Command at that time, ordered and scrambled two F-15 aircraft to intercept Flight 85 and ordered the F-15 pilots to establish direct radio contact with the Flight 85 pilot.\nLieutenant General Norton Schwartz with U.S. President George W. Bush and First-Lady Laura Bush  at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska on 16 February 2002]]\nSchwartz then contacted the commander in charge of the Canadian NORAD region, Lieutenant General Angus Watt and discussed the possibility of diverting the Korean Air 747 into Whitehorse, Canada since the 747 was running low on fuel and headed toward U.S. territory. Schwartz also guaranteed that the Korean Air 747 would be escorted by U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft all the way until the plane touched down. Upon receiving approval from the Canadian authority, Watt then allowed the Korean Air Boeing 747 to land at Whitehorse International Airport on the condition that the plane would have to be escorted by the United States Air Force until its landing at Whitehorse. Immediately after landing there, the Boeing 747 was surrounded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the crew was interrogated by the Canadian authority. It was later confirmed that, in fact, it was not a hijacking, but rather a mistaken signal which had been transmitted by the Flight 85 pilot. Many praise Schwartz's decisions and actions in coordinating with the Canadian Authority to divert Flight 85 into Whitehorse, which eventually resulted in saving the lives of 215 passengers on board Flight 85. At that time (during the 9/11 attacks), all US Air Force fighter aircraft which had been scrambled and were patrolling US airspace were given an order to shoot down any hijacked aircraft. Schwartz knew that a distress signal ('squawking' [a transponder code of] \"7500\", which is a code meaning \"hijacked\") had been sent by the Flight 85 pilot.\n, at a press briefing in The Pentagon|alt=|217x217px]]\nDirector of the Joint Staff\nIn October 2002 following the assignment within the Alaskan Command, Lieutenant General Schwartz was promoted into Joint Staff J-3 director for operations which assists the Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff about the current United States Armed Forces operations and plans. In this capacity Schwartz was the senior officer of the Operation Directorate and providing guidance for the Unified Combatant Commanders for every U.S. military operation around the world. In October 2004, following two years assignment as J-3 Operations Directorate, Schwartz was appointed by Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard B. Myers to be the Director of the Joint Staff (DJS). In this position Schwartz became the three-star officer which assists the Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff in managing the Joint Staff and headed all of the Joint Staff Directorate.\nCommander of the United States Transportation Command\nin September 2005]]\nSchwartz was appointed to be the commander of the United States Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) in 2005. Schwartz also received his fourth-star and was promoted into four-star General. As commander of The Transportation Command, General Schwartz oversees the mobilization of all of the service branches and defense agencies transportation and mobility support. General Schwartz also organized the entire Department of Defense transportation network. During his tenured as TRANSCOM Commander General Schwartz also coordinated with commercial airline in cooperation for providing military airlift. Schwartz also held a routine meetings with the Airline CEO in-order to discuss about the Airline company cooperation with the military and the Department of Defense. As a result, many cargo and chartered airline companies help provided so many airlift for military personnel and logistical supports during the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan.\nSchwartz also emphasize about the importance of the movement of injured warfighters from the battlefield to medical treatment facilities in-order for them to get immediate and quickly medical treatment. Especially knowing that this was a complex process in which it required close collaboration with doctors, hospitals and evacuation crews. One of General Schwartz's major accomplishment as commander of the Transportation Command was the successful transportation of over 9,900 patients from the United States Central Command area of responsibility which was the key-element area during the Iraq War, War in Afghanistan and War on Terrorism and over 16,000 patients globally to a medical treatment facilities. In 2008 following three years of his tenure as Commander of The United States Transportation Command, General Schwartz was actually set to retire from active-duty. However following the nuclear weapons incident in 2007 which resulted in the relieved of Air Force Chief of Staff General T. Michael Moseley, Schwartz was elevated into the position of the United States Air Force Chief of Staff and named his successor.\nAir Force Chief of Staff\n.|alt=]]\nMichael Donley at The Pentagon in 2012]]In June 2008, after General T. Michael Moseley was relieved from his position as Air Force Chief of Staff, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates nominated General Schwartz to be the next Air Force Chief of Staff. General Schwartz is the first Air Force Chief of Staff with a background as an airlift and special operations aircraft pilot. It is speculated that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates selected him because he did not have a background as a fighter or bomber pilot.\nAs chief of staff, General Schwartz served as the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the organization, training and equipping of nearly 700,000 active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard and civilian forces serving in the United States and overseas. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Schwartz functioned as a military adviser to the Secretary of Defense, National Security Council and the President.\nDuring his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff, General Schwartz reaffirmed the importance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which he believed could be the future of the Air Force. At that time dozens of UAVs were being used in the war on terror, especially in Afghanistan. General Schwartz also estimated that in the future, 85 percent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles would have a huge role within the Air Force and its operations. In 2011 almost 350 UAV pilots were trained and prepared by the Air Force.\nAir-Sea Battle Doctrine\nTogether with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, General Schwartz developed a new battle doctrine in 2010, The Air-Sea Battle Doctrine. The Air-Sea Battle Doctrine was an Air Force and Navy integrated battle doctrine which formed a key component military strategy. The Air-Sea Battle Doctrine was developed to deal with the unique challenges of the Western-Pacific arena. It created an institutional partnership and cooperation between the United States Air Force and the United States Navy. Both General Schwartz and Admiral Roughead saw the need and importance of joint Air Force and Navy cooperation within the Indo-Pacific region that ultimately lead to the initiation of Air-Sea Battle Doctrine, especially in wartime situations within the Indo-Pacific region., 25 March 2011|alt=|left|222x222px]]\nOne of the primary goals of Air-Sea Battle Doctrine was interoperability of air and naval forces that could execute networked and integrated in-depth attacks in order to disrupt, destroy and ultimately cripple or defeat the enemy's anti-access/area denial capabilities to sustain and protect the operations area within the Indo-Pacific Region. General Schwartz also emphasized the importance of the air-sea operating space for non-combat operations such as disaster relief. General Schwartz argued that to ensure the success of this doctrine, improved training, tactics and communications technologies between the Air Force, Navy and Marines, would be needed to allow them to work together better, during both wartime and non-combatant operations.\nThe concept to create a joint Air Force and Navy battle strategy began in the 1990s, when both the Air Force and Navy had institutionalized a joint air operations which eventually led the two services to began exchanging air crews, tacticians and intelligence officers in a joint service partnership following the Gulf War. It created a new cooperative environment that balanced the differences in naval (carrier-based) and Air Force (land-based) air operations, strengthened command and staff relationships, integrated air asset strike operations, and pooled common air resources. In February 2010 the Air-Sea Battle Doctrine became official and in 2015 The Air-Sea Battle doctrine was renamed to Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC).\nIn August 2012, General Schwartz retired after serving four years as Air Force Chief of Staff; he had served a total of 39 years with the Air Force. General Schwartz was succeeded by General Mark A. Welsh who previously served as commander of United States Air Forces in Europe and Africa.\nCivilian career\nAfter his retirement from the Air Force, he wrote a memoir entitled Journey: Memoirs of an Air Force Chief of Staff with Susie Schwartz and Ronald Levinson.\nIn 2013, Schwartz became a member of the board of trustees of the Institute for Defense Analyses.  In July 2019, Schwartz was selected to become IDA's president and CEO, effective 2 January 2020.\nEducation\n:1973 Bachelor of Science degree in political science and international affairs, United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado\n:1977 Squadron Officer School, Maxwell AFB, Alabama\n:1983 Master of Business Administration degree, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan\n:1984 Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Virginia\n:1989 National War College, Fort Lesley J.
