It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 26, 1990, for its significance in architecture, exploration/settlement, literature, military history, and politics/government.\nHistory and description\nIn 1711, Joseph Ware Jr. (1684–1754) inherited the land and property from his father. According to local historian Thomas Shourds (1805–1891), he built a house here . His second son, Solomon Ware, inherited the house in 1754 and built a one-story brick addition in 1758. His daughter Sarah Ware inherited it in 1765. She married Joshua Thompson in 1773. On March 21, 1778, Judge William Hancock Jr. was mortally wounded at nearby Hancock House and later died here.
