For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n11 & 12 Geo. 6\nContinuing the third session of the 38th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 21 October 1947 until 13 September 1948.\nNo acts were passed during the fourth session, which met from 14 September 1948 until 25 October 1948; it was a short session created to fulfil the requirement of the Parliament Act 1911 for a bill to be presented and rejected over at least three sessions and at least two years before the Commons could pass it into law without the agreement of the Lords. In this case, the bill in question became the Parliament Act 1949.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 11 & 12 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to make permanent
