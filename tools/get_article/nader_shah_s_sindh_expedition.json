After his victory over Muhammad Shah, the Mughal Emperor, Nader had compelled him to cede all the lands to the west of the Indus River. His return to this region from Delhi was honoured by all the governors of the newly annexed territories save for Khudayar Khan,  ruler of Sindh, who was conspicuously absent despite being given a summons like the rest of the governors.\nNader's descent onto Sindh\nNader set out across the Hindu Kush mountains on a 1,700 kilometre journey which came to a close within 2 months. The astonished Khodayar Khan was caught completely off balance and could not gather forces to resist, given the unexpected emergence of the Imperial army as well as the rapidity of its advance into his lands. Completely dismayed and demoralised he surrendered himself to Nader, whence he was chained and all his personal wealth including his treasury confiscated. After the intercedence of a sympathetic governor, Nader reinstated Khodayar Khan as the ruler of Sindh. He left a few Afsharid Qizilbash cavalrymen and trusted functionaries in different areas of the territory to maintain his rule and crush any further subversion. The descendants of these officials have fully assimilated into the Sindhi culture as of now and the ones that were particularly installed in Shikarpur assimilated into the surrounding majority resident Pashtun population.\nSee also\n* Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire\n* Battle of Khyber Pass\n* Battle of Karnal\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Axworthy, Michael, Nader Shah: The Sword of Persia, From Tribal Warrior to Conquering Tyrant, I.B.
