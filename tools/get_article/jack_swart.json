Swart and Blair Stockwell were the only two riders to win the \"Dulux North Island Tour\" three times.\nHe was born in Tuakau to a dairy farmer from the Netherlands; his younger brother Stephen Swart was also a champion road cyclist.\nHonorific eponym\nSwart Lane, in the Hamilton suburb of Chartwell, is named in Jack Swart's honour.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
