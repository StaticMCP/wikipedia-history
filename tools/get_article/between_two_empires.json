      "text": "# Between Two Empires\n\nBetween Two Empires: Ahmet Ağaoğlu and the New Turkey is a 2002 book about Ahmet Ağaoğlu by A. Holly Shissler, published by I.B. Tauris.\nSubject matter\nThe book is a case study of Ahmet Ağaoğlu, covering religion, society, nationality and their interactions. Sam Kaplan describes the book: \"Between Two Empires is the story of an intellectual's struggle to reorganize social relations in the Muslim and Turkic world, first into a morally homogenous community, and later following World War 1, into politically exclusive nations—all the while upholding a liberal individualistic rapport to society.\"\nReception\nKaplan praised the book as a case study but noted that as a republished dissertation, it would have benefited from further editing.\nKemal Karpat found some \"blemishes\" but praised the book's \"wide theoretical scope, penetrating comparative analyses, and multifaceted qualities.\"\nFeroz Ahmad wrote that Shissler accomplished her goal of providing an analysis of Ağaoğlu's intellectual development and called the book \"a compelling account of a life that had a dramatic impact on two empires and a nation-state.\"\nMichelangelo Guida noted minor errors in transcription of Turkish names, but ultimately suggested that the book was helpful in understanding Ağaoğlu as an important figure in the early years of the Republic of Turkey.\n}}"
