Originally, the election was scheduled to take place in November 1812 via a general ticket, a practice that had been in place since the 1804 election. However, after securing a narrow majority in the October state legislature elections, the Federalist, adopting a strategy used by the Democratic-Republicans, changed the voting method to a legislative vote and delayed the election to a later date. Additionally, the Federalists altered the congressional elections, shifting from an at-large system to district-based elections.\nIn the legislative election, the legislature voted 29 to 23 in favor of Independent Democratic Republican and Federalist supported candidate DeWitt Clinton, with one not voting. Some towns, either because word of these changes did not reach them in time, or most likely in defiance, according to Historian Phil Lampi, went ahead and held the popular elections, giving Madison 1,672 votes to Clinton's 1 in two towns.\nElector Jonas Wade did not cast a vote in the Electoral College and was replaced with William Griffeth.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1812 United States presidential election in New Jersey\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican/Federalist\n| DeWitt Clinton\n| align=\"right\" | 29\n| align=\"right\" | 55.77%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Madison\n| align=\"right\" | 23\n| align=\"right\" | 44.23%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 52\n| align=\"right\" | 100%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Jersey\nNotes\nReferences"
