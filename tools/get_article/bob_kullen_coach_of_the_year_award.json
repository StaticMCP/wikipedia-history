The award was renamed in honor of Bob Kullen who served as head coach of New Hampshire in the late-80's before heart disease forced him to receive a heart transplant and subsequently retire shortly before his death in 1990.\nThe Coach of the Year was first awarded in 1985 and every year thereafter. The award has been shared once, in 2009–10, between Merrimack's Mark Dennehy and New Hampshire's Dick Umile.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Ref\n|-\n| 1984–85 || Len Ceglarski || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 1985–86 || Jack Parker || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 1986–87 || Bill Riley Jr. || UMass Lowell ||\n|-\n| 1987–88 || Shawn Walsh || Maine ||\n|-\n| 1988–89 || Fern Flaman || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 1989–90 || Shawn Walsh || Maine ||\n|-\n| 1990–91 || Dick Umile || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 1991–92 || Jack Parker || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 1992–93 || Shawn Walsh || Maine ||\n|-\n| 1993–94 || Bruce Crowder || UMass Lowell ||\n|-\n| 1994–95 || Shawn Walsh || Maine ||\n|-\n| 1995–96 || Bruce Crowder || UMass Lowell ||\n|-\n| 1996–97 || Dick Umile || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 1997–98 || Bruce Crowder || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 1998–99 || Dick Umile || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 1999–00 || Jack Parker || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2000–01 || Paul Pooley || Providence ||\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Dick Umile || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 2002–03 || Don Cahoon || Massachusetts ||\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Jerry York || Boston College ||\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Ref\n|-\n| 2004–05 || Jack Parker || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2005–06 || Jack Parker || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2006–07 || Dick Umile || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Kevin Sneddon || Vermont ||\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Greg Cronin || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2| 2009–10 || Mark Dennehy || Merrimack ||rowspan=2|\n|-\n| Dick Umile || New Hampshire\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Jerry York || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Norm Bazin || UMass Lowell ||\n|-\n| 2012–13 || Norm Bazin || UMass Lowell ||\n|-\n| 2013–14 || Jerry York || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2014–15 || David Quinn || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2015–16 || Nate Leaman || Providence ||\n|-\n| 2016–17 || Norm Bazin || UMass Lowell ||\n|-\n| 2017–18 || Jerry York || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2018–19 || Greg Carvel || Massachusetts ||\n|-\n| 2019–20 || Red Gendron || Maine ||\n|-\n| 2020–21 || Jerry York || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2021–22 || Jerry Keefe || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2022–23 || Jay Pandolfo || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2023–24 || Greg Brown || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2024–25 || Mike Cavanaugh || UConn ||\n|}\nWinners by school\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n|Boston University || 7\n|-\n|Boston College || 7\n|-\n|New Hampshire || 6\n|-\n|UMass Lowell || 6\n|-\n|Maine || 5\n|-\n|Northeastern || 4\n|-\n|Massachusetts || 2\n|-\n|Providence || 2\n|-\n|Merrimack || 1\n|-\n|UConn || 1\n|-\n|Vermont || 1\n|}\nMultiple Winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n| Dick Umile || 6\n|-\n| Jerry York || 5\n|-\n| Jack Parker || 5\n|-\n| Shawn Walsh || 4\n|-\n| Norm Bazin || 3\n|-\n| Bruce Crowder || 3\n|}\nSee also\n*Hockey East Awards\nReferences\nGeneral\n*\n*\nSpecific\nExternal links\n*[http://www.collegehockeynews.com/reports/confinfo.php?c=5&d=history Hockey East Awards (Incomplete)]"
