Joseph Losey directed a sequel, Roads to the South (-1978). In July 2021, the film was shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.\nPlot\nIn the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, communist veteran Diego has dedicated his life to continuing the struggle against the Francoist State while he lives in exile in Paris. Lately, however, he has become war-weary and skeptical about the tactics of the extremist underground.\nAfter meeting Nadine by using her father's passport, Diego learns that she is involved with an alternative extremist group that is planning an armed attack in Spain. When he meets the young extremists who will execute the plan, he tries to persuade them to abandon the action as misconceived, but they ignore him. The leaders of the underground send Diego on a mission to Barcelona along with a new recruit, perhaps as a way of getting rid of him as the police have since discovered his identity. His lover Marianne, who has received a warning from Nadine, attempts to intercept him before he is arrested.\nCast\n* Yves Montand as Diego Mora\n* Ingrid Thulin as Marianne\n* Geneviève Bujold as Nadine Sallanches\n* Jean Dasté as Chief\n* Michel Piccoli as First Customs Inspector\n* Anouk Ferjac as Marie Jude\n* Paul Crauchet as Roberto\n* Laurence Badie as Bernadette Pluvier\n* Françoise Bertin as Carmen\n* Yvette Etiévant as Yvette\n* Jean Bouise as Ramon\n* Claire Duhamel as Traveller 1\n* Antoine Bourseiller as Traveller 2\nAccolades\nThe film was nominated for an Oscar for its script.
