At some point it was renamed to New Pencil Points and then in 1945, renamed to Progressive Architecture.  In 1996, the Progressive Architecture magazine name and subscriber list was sold to BPI Communications, by Penton Publishing.\nThe editors of Progressive Architecture magazine hosted the first Progressive Architecture Award jury in 1954, whose members were Victor Gruen, George Howe, Eero Saarinen, and Fred Severud.  Progressive Architecture magazine ended the awards in 1987.  In 1997, Hanley Wood, owner of Architecture magazine, restarted Progressive Architecture Awards.  In 2007, Architecture folded, and the awards were inherited by a new publication, titled ARCHITECT.\nPA Design Awards\nFirst place\n*1985  Wexner Center for the Arts (Columbus, OH) — Peter Eisenman\n*1983 Citation for NSF-funded Research on Lightweight Structures — Zann Gill\n*1980 Citation for Frehley House --George Ranalli\n*1973 Queens Village (Philadelphia) Louis Sauer\n*1969  Head House Square East (Society Hill, Philadelphia) — Louis Sauer\n*1966 Redevelopment of City Center Plan (Oakland, California) — William Liskamm and Rai Okamoto\n*1965  Pastorius Mews (Germantown, Philadelphia) — Louis Sauer\n*1964  James Hamilton House (New Hope, Pennsylvania) — Louis Sauer\n*1964  11th and Waverly Town Houses (Philadelphia) — Louis Sauer\n*1963  Richard Cripps House (Lambertville, New Jersey) — Louis Sauer\n*1954  Back Bay Center Development (Boston, Massachusetts) - Boston Center Architects\nSecond place\n* 2003  Dalki Theme Park and Shop (Dalki, South Korea) — Slade Architecture\n*1999  Von Erlach Residence (Shelter Island, New York) — Cho Slade Architecture\n*1999  Large piazza located on a landfill in the Adige River in Verona, Italy — Michael Gabellini\n*1991  Vermont & Santa Monica MTA Transit Station (Los Angeles, California) — Mehrdad Yasdani\nThird place\n* 2021 Teweles & Brandeis Granary — LA DALLMAN\n* 2020 Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation — Studio Gang\n* 2019 Ring of Hope — Paul Preissner Architects\n* 2013 Arctic Food Network — Lateral Office\n* 2013 Beukenhof Crematorium and Auditorium — Asymptote Architecture\n* 2013 Floatyard — Perkins+Will\n* 2013 Rock Chapel Marine — Landing Studio\n* 2013 The Farm: Gaming Strategies for Empowering Marginalized Youth — Steven Mankouche and Matthew Schulte\n* 2013 Calexico West Land Port of Entry — Perkins+Will\n* 2013 Dortoir Familial — NADAAA\n* 2013 Kimball Art Center — BIG\n* 2013 Modulo Prep Library — CRO\n* 2013 Studio Smart Material House — by Barkow Leibinger\n* 2007 Hybrid Urban Sutures — Aziza Chaouni\n* 2007 Calgary Centre for Global Community — Marc Boutin Architect\n* 2007 Pittman Dowell Residence — Michael Maltzen Architecture\n* 2007 Villa Moda, New Kuwait Sports Shooting Club — Office dA\n* 2007 Bahá'í Mother Temple for South America — Hariri Pontarini Architects\n* 2007 Bab Tebbaneh School for Working Children and for Women — Hashim Sarkis\n* 2007 Campus d'Espoir (campus of hope) — Studio Luz Architects\n* 2007 Good Shepherd Ecumenical Retirement Community — the University of Arkansas Community Design Center\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.architectmagazine.com/content.asp?articleID=418995&sectionID=1151 2008 Progressive Architecture Awards]\n*[http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/the-57th-annual-pa-awards.aspx 2010 Progressive Architecture Awards]"
