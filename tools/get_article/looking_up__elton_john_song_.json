I wanted to make a happy record. 'Joyous' was the word I chose. Not happy, joyous. I said I want it to feel joyous from beginning to end, and even the slow songs should be joyous.\"\nMusic\n\"Looking Up\" is written in A major and is an upbeat rock song with a positive vibe meant to bring light to balance out the darkness present in the world today.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015–2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)\n| 36\n|}\nReferences"
