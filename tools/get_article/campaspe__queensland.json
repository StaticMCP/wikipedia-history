In the , Campaspe had a population of 123 people.\nThere are two neighbourhoods in the north of the locality: Balfes Creek () and Powlathanga  ().\nGeography\nThe Cape River flows south-east through a portion of the west of the locality before exiting, then returning to form part of the southern boundary. The Campaspe River flows south-east through the locality before joining the Cape on the southern boundary.\nThe Flinders Highway runs through the north of the locality, entering from the north-east (Basalt / Black Jack) and exiting to the north-west (Homestead).\nThe Gregory Highway enters the locality from the north-east (Seventy Mile) and then heads south through the locality, briefly passing through Seventy Mile, and then exiting to south-east (Llanarth). The two highways do not have a junction within Campaspe.\nThe Great Northern railway line runs mostly immediately south of and parallel to the Flinders Highway, with the following stations within the locality (from west to east):\n* Thalanga railway station, now abandoned ()\n* Mungunburra railway station ()\n* Balfes Creek railway station ()\n* Powlathanga railway station, now abandoned  ()\nCampaspe has the following mountains (from north to south):\n* Mount Bohle ()\n* Mount Glengalder ()\n* Mount Windsor ()\n* Mount Trafalgar ()\n* Mount Redan ()\n* Three Sisters Hill ()\n* Mount Raglan ()\n* Mount Malakoff ()\n* Mount Bellevue ()\nHistory\nThe former railway station of Balfes Creek, on the Great Northern railway line, which was opened in 1884, was in the locality. A  crossing loop is located in the immediate vicinity.\nIn 1942 work started on the construction of an airfield at Balfes Creek for defence purposes. An earth strip running parallel to the road and railway was cleared and levelled, but defence priorities changed and it was never sealed.\nDemographics\nIn the , Campaspe had a population of 123 people.\nIn the , Campaspe had a population of 123 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Campaspe. The nearest government primary schools are Homestead State School in neighbouring Homestead to the north-west and Charters Towers Central State School in Charters Towers City to the north-west. The nearest government secondary school is Charters Towers State High School, also in Charters Towers City. However, due to the size of the locality of Campaspe, only those living in the northern part of the locality would be able to access these schools on a daily basis. The southern parts of the locality would be too distant and the alternatives would be distance education and boarding schools.\nReferences"
