The incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa of the African National Congress won a third term.\nFormer President Jacob Zuma has challenged the results of the general election in court, and declared his intention to boycott the vote on 14 June and the former president also declared that he will not be part of Government of National Unity (GNU). The day before the 2024 election, Parliament established an advisory body on electoral reform and proposals emerging from public consultations including directly electing the President.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
