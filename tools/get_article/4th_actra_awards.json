The ceremony was hosted by Pierre Berton.\nDue to the cancellation of the Canadian Film Awards in 1974, ACTRA opted to present selected film awards for the first time, with a dedicated award for best film actor and the awards for dramatic and documentary writing opened to both television and theatrical film productions; however, with the Canadian Film Awards returning in 1975, this was not maintained in future years.\nThe 1975 ceremony also marked the first time that ACTRA presented an award for Best Program rather than solely honouring individuals; a single award was presented inclusive of both television and radio programs this year, with separate categories for television and radio programming introduced at the 5th ACTRA Awards in 1976. Additionally, the 1975 awards marked the introduction of the Foster Hewitt Award for television sportscasting; this year it was presented as a lifetime achievement award, separately from the existing award for television sportscasting within the previous broadcast year, but they were merged into a single award in future years.\nIn 1978, The Globe and Mail revealed for the first time an unconfirmed but longstanding industry rumour that if Lloyd Robertson had won the award for Best News Broadcaster, elements in the audience were planning to pie him in the face just to see if they could cause the normally unflappable Robertson to lose his composure.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=wikitable width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Television or Radio Program\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Television Actor\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'Next Year in Jerusalem — Harry Rasky'\n* Back to Beulah\n* Jack\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'William Hutt, The National Dream'\n* Michael Kane, The Collaborators\n* Patrick Watson, Witness to Yesterday\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Film Actor\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Radio Actor\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'Stuart Gillard, Why Rock the Boat?'\n* Ken James, Why Rock the Boat?\n* Henry Ramer, The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'Ron Hartmann, Othello'\n* Colin Fox, Lingard\n* Sean Mulcahy, ''The Art of Liam O'Flaherty\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Television Public Affairs Broadcaster\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Radio Public Affairs Broadcaster\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'Helen Hutchinson, Canada AM'\n* Adrienne Clarkson, Adrienne at Large\n* Carole Taylor, W5\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'Barbara Frum, As It Happens'\n* Harry Brown, Metro Morning\n* Betty Kennedy, The Betty Kennedy Show\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best News Broadcaster\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Sportscaster\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Michael Maclear\n* Lloyd Robertson\n* Joe Schlesinger\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Don Chevrier\n* Pat Marsden\n* Fred Sgambati\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Writing, Television or Film Drama\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Writing, Radio Drama\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  'Mordecai Richler and Lionel Chetwynd, The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'\n* Len Peterson, The Executioners\n* W.
