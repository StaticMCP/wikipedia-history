After primary school is secondary school. Secondary school students are admitted into a 2 year orientation designed to deepen their understanding of what they learnt in primary school during their 7th and 8th year of school. This orientation period also allows students to choose more specific studies to focus their education. The school also offers a 4 year study period post-orientation before students go to university.\nSee also\n* Roman Catholic Diocese of Buta\nReferences\nSources\n*"
