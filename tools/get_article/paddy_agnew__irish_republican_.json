He was a  Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer who was elected to Dáil Éireann during the 1981 Irish hunger strike.\nAgnew was born in Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland in 1955. His grandfather was also an Irish republican and was an internee during the Irish War of Independence.\nWhile his grandfather's activism factored into his decision to join the Provisional IRA in 1972, Bloody Sunday was another influence. Catholics leaving or forced from their homes in Northern Ireland to stay in the local Clan na Gael Hall near his family home also made an impression on him. But, as he put it, “Republicanism was just in me.” He was imprisoned, for the illegal importation of arms on behalf of the Provisional IRA and membership of same, at Portlaoise, Mountjoy, Crumlin Road, and the H-Blocks of Long Kesh. He was involved in the blanket protest in the H-Blocks.\nAlthough not on participating in the 1981 hunger strike, he was elected as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Louth constituency at the 1981 general election, topping the poll. He did not take his seat, as he remained in prison. The other successful Anti H-Block candidate was Kieran Doherty, who was elected in Cavan–Monaghan and died on hunger strike.\nAgnew was released from prison in 1986 and joined the Sinn Féin cumann in Dundalk.\nSee also\n*List of members of the Oireachtas imprisoned since 1923\nReferences"
