Since the mid-90s, many productions supposedly set in the City by the Bay are actually filmed in Canada, most notably in Vancouver, a frequent double for the cities of San Francisco and Seattle on the small screen. Canadian provinces often offer attractive tax incentives and more flexible union regulations for production companies.\nMonk was shot in Vancouver before moving to Los Angeles, and only a few exterior shots involving San Francisco landmarks are actually filmed in the city. Similarly, recent short-lived series such as Presidio Med, The Evidence or Killer Instinct were actually shot in the Los Angeles or Vancouver areas. The city of San Francisco has tried to counter this trend over the past few years by reducing filming fees and streamlining the permit approval process.\nSan Francisco is also a vital part of the Star Trek'' science fiction media franchise. It hosts the headquarters and council chambers of the United Federation of Planets, as well as its military/exploration arm, Starfleet. In addition, the Presidio hosts Starfleet's primary service academy, Starfleet Academy. A major Federation shipyard named after the city, site of the construction and refit of several starships named Enterprise, resides in geosynchronous orbit of Earth.\nThe TV shows Trauma, Midnight Caller, The Streets of San Francisco and Nash Bridges were filmed entirely in the San Francisco Bay area. The Nash Bridges Reboot pilot started shooting in 2021, 20 years after the final episode of the original series aired.\nFiction\nTelevision programs that highlight the city and its people include:\n* Accidentally on Purpose\n* The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\n* Alcatraz\n* All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series\n* ANT Farm\n* Big Hero 6: The Series\n* The Californians\n* Charmed\n* Crazy Like a Fox\n* Dharma & Greg\n* The Division\n* The Doris Day Show\n* Eli Stone\n* The Evidence\n* Fairly Legal\n* Falcon Crest\n* First Years\n* Full House\n* Fuller House\n* Girlboss\n* Girls Club\n* Half & Half\n* Have Gun, Will Travel\n* Hell on Wheels\n* Hooperman\n* Hotel\n* Ironside\n* Jackie Chan Adventures\n* Journeyman\n* Khan!\n* Killer Instinct\n* Kindred: The Embraced\n* The Life and Times of Juniper Lee\n* The Lineup (also known as San Francisco Beat)\n* Looking\n* Love Is a Many Splendored Thing\n* Lucy, The Daughter of the Devil\n* Mama\n* The Man in the High Castle\n* McMillan & Wife\n* MDs\n* Midnight Caller\n* The Mighty B!\n* Monk\n* My Sister Sam\n* Nash Bridges\n* The Nine Lives of Chloe King\n* The OA (part 2)\n* Party of Five\n* Pelswick\n* Phyllis\n* Poltergeist: The Legacy\n* Presidio Med\n* Robotboy\n* San Francisco Beat\n* Sense8\n* Sledge Hammer!\n* Sliders\n* Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\n* Star Trek: Enterprise\n* Star Trek: The Next Generation\n* Star Trek: Voyager\n* The Streets of San Francisco\n* Suddenly Susan\n* ''That's So Raven\n* Too Close for Comfort\n* Touching Evil\n* Trapper John, M.D.\n* Trauma\n* Twins\n* We Bare Bears\n* Wolf\n* Women's Murder Club\n* Young & Hungry\n* Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist\nReality\n* 30 Days\n** \"Straight Man in a Gay World\"\n* Animal Cops: San Francisco\n* Bait Car\n* Color Splash\n* Dirty Jobs\n* The Hills\n* Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County\n* MythBusters\n* Oddities: San Francisco\n* Real World: Ex-Plosion\n* The Real World: San Francisco\n* Top Chef: San Francisco\n* What Makes it Tick on Fine Living\nMiniseries, specials or individual episodes\n* Angels in America\n* Doctor Who\n* Criminal Minds: \"The Fight\"\n* Family Guy: \"Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story\"\n* Psych: \"Who Ya Gonna Call?\"\n* The Simpsons'': \"Bart Mangled Banner\", \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\"\n* South Park: \"Smug Alert!\"\n* Tales of the City\n* Warehouse 13: \"Philosopher's Stone\"\n* Ben 10: \"Framed\"\n* ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?: \"The San Franpsycho\"\n* Xiaolin Showdown: \"The Journey of a Thousand Miles\"\n* Transformers: The Headmasters: \"Head On!!

Several other familiar landmarks have been recreated, from the Ferry Building and the Transamerica Pyramid (\"Big Pointy Building\") to Lombard Street (\"Windy Windy Windy Windy Windy Street\"), and Scottish landmarks such as the Forth Bridge and the Forth Road Bridge.
