It was designed to let web developers measure the performance of their code under stress, to see how it will stand up to load on the internet.\nIt is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) open-source software license, which means it is free to use, modify, and distribute.\nSiege can stress a single URL or it can read many URLs into memory and stress them simultaneously. It supports basic authentication, cookies, HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols.\nPerformance measures\nPerformance measures include elapsed time of the test, the amount of data transferred (including headers), the response time of the server, its transaction rate, its throughput, its concurrency and the number of times it returned OK. These measures are quantified and reported at the end of each run.\nThis is a sample of siege output:\nBen: $ siege -u shemp.whoohoo.com/Admin.jsp -d1 -r10 -c25\n..Siege 2.65 2006/05/11 23:42:16\n..Preparing 25 concurrent users for battle.\nThe server is now under siege...done\nTransactions: 250 hits\nElapsed time: 14.67 secs\nData transferred: 448,000 bytes\nResponse time: 0.43 secs\nTransaction rate: 17.04 trans/sec\nThroughput: 30538.51 bytes/sec\nConcurrency: 7.38\nStatus code 200: 250\nSuccessful transactions: 250\nFailed transactions: 0\nSiege has essentially three modes of operation: regression, internet simulation and brute force. It can read a large number of URLs from a configuration file and run through them incrementally (regression) or randomly (internet simulation). Or the user may simply pound a single URL with a runtime configuration at the command line (brute force).\nPlatform support\nSiege was written on Linux and has been successfully ported to AIX, BSD, HP-UX, and Solaris. It compiles on most UNIX System V variants and on most newer BSD systems.\nReferences"
