The Mewar forces were strained as they were engaged in conflicts with the Sultans of Malwa and Gujarat. The battle, near Dholpur, witnessed a successful charge by the Mewar army, resulting in the defeat of the opposing forces. Following this victory, Sanga extended his conquests to encompass much of present-day Rajasthan.\nAftermath\nAs a result of this victory, the territories of Malwa, previously seized by Muhammad Shah (Sahib Khan), the younger brother of Sultan Mahmud Khilji II of Mandu during his rebellion against his brother, and later annexed by Sultan Sikander Lodi, father of Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, came under the control of Rana Sanga, the Maharana of Mewar. Chanderi was among the territories captured by the Maharana, who subsequently bestowed it as a gift upon Medini Rai.The fortress of Gwalior was also captured. Ibrahim Lodi attempted to besiege the forts of Ranthambhore and Ajmer, which were under the control of Rana Sanga, but he faced defeat for the third time.\nReferences"
