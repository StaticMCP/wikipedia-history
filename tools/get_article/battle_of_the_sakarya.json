The battle line stretched over 62 miles (100&nbsp;km).\nIt is also known as the 'Officers' Battle' () in Turkey because of the unusually high casualty rate (70–80%) among the officers. Later, it was also called Melhâme-i Kübrâ (Islamic equivalent to Armageddon) by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\nThe Battle of the Sakarya is considered as the turning point of the Turkish War of Independence.[https://archive.org/details/youngturknovel00farh  Young Turk], Moris Farhi, Arcade Publishing, 2005, , page 153. The Turkish observer, writer, and literary critic İsmail Habip Sevük later described the importance of the battle with these words:\n, page 138.}}\nBackground\nThe Greek offensive, under King Constantine I as Supreme Commander of the Greek Forces in Asia, was committed on July 16, 1921, and skilfully executed. A feint towards the Turkish right flank at Eskişehir distracted Ismet Pasha just as the major assault fell on the left at Kara Hisar. The Greeks then wheeled their axis to the north, swept towards Eskişehir and rolled up the Turkish defence in a series of frontal assaults that was combined with flanking movements.\nEskişehir fell on July 17 despite a vigorous counterattack by Ismet Pasha, who was determined to fight to the finish. The saner counsels of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk prevailed, however, and Ismet Pasha disengaged with great losses to reach the comparative safety of the Sakarya River, some 30&nbsp;mi (48&nbsp;km) to the north and only 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) from Ankara.\n, around the vicinity of Polatlı, and had a battle line 100 km (62 mi) long.]]\nThe determining feature of the terrain was the river itself, which flows eastward across the plateau, suddenly curves north and then turns back westwards. The great loop described forms a natural barrier. The river banks are awkward and steep, and bridges were few with only two on the frontal section of the loop. East of the loop, the landscape rises before an invader in rocky, barren ridges and hills towards Ankara. It was in those hills, east of the river that the Turks dug in their defensive positions. The front followed the hills east of the Sakarya River from a point near Polatlı southwards to the place at which the Gök River joins the Sakarya, and then swung at right angles eastwards, following the line of the Gök River. The region was excellent defensive ground.\nFor the Greeks, the question was one of whether to dig in and rest on their previous gains, or to advance towards Ankara in great effort and destroy the Army of the Grand National Assembly. Either option was difficult to resolve and posed the eternal problems with which the Greek staff had to deal since the beginning of the war. The dangers of extending their lines of communications still further in an inhospitable terrain that killed horses, caused vehicles to break down and prevented the movement of heavy artillery, were obvious. The present front gave the Greeks control of the essential strategic railway and was tactically most favourable, but the Army of the Grand National Assembly had escaped encirclement at Kütahya, so nothing had been settled. For the Greeks, that made the temptation of achieving a knockout blow irresistible.\nBattle\nOn August 10, Greek King Constantine I finally committed his forces to an assault against the Sakarya Line. The Greeks marched hard for nine days before they made contact with the enemy. The march included an outflanking manoeuvre via the northern part of Anatolia through the Salt Desert, where food and water scarcely existed; and so the advancing Greek infantry attacked the poor Turkish villages for maize and water, or took meat from the flocks that were pastured on the fringe of the desert.\nOn August 23, battle was finally joined by the Greeks making contact with the advanced Turkish positions south of the Gök River. The Turkish General Staff had made its headquarters at Polatlı, on the railway a few miles east of the coast of the Sakarya River, and its troops were prepared to resist.\nOn August 26, the Greeks attacked all along the line. Crossing the shallow Gök, the infantry fought its way step up onto the heights, where every ridge and hill top had to be stormed against strong entrenchments and withering fire.\nBy September 2, the commanding heights of the key Mount Chal were in Greek hands, but once the enveloping movement against the Turkish left flank had failed, the battle descended to a typical head-on confrontation of infantry, machine guns and artillery. The Greeks launched their main effort in the centre and pushed forward some 10&nbsp;mi (16&nbsp;km) in 10 days through the Turks' second line of defence. Some Greek units came as close as 31&nbsp;mi (50&nbsp;km) to the city of Ankara. For the Greeks, this was the peak of their achievement in the Asia Minor Campaign.\nFor days during the battle, neither ammunition nor food had reached the front because  of successful harassment of the Greek lines of communications and raids behind the Greek lines by Turkish cavalry. All of the Greek troops were committed to the battle, but fresh Turkish draftees were still arriving throughout the campaign in response to the Turkish National Movement's mobilisation. All of those causes ended the impetus of the Greek attack. For a few days, there was a lull in the fighting during which neither of the exhausted armies could press an attack. Constantine, who commanded the battle personally, was almost taken prisoner by a Turkish patrol.\nAstute as ever at the decisive moment, Ataturk assumed personal command of the Turkish forces and led a small counterattack against the Greek left, around Mount Chal, on September 8. The Greek line held, and the attack itself achieved a limited military success, but the fear that presaged a major Turkish effort to outflank their forces, while the severity of the winter was approaching, made Constantine break off the Greek assault on September 14, 1921.\nThat made Anastasios Papoulas order a general retreat toward Eskişehir and Afyonkarahisar. The Greek troops evacuated Mount Chal, which had been taken at such a cost, and they retired unmolested across the Sakarya River to the positions that they had left a month earlier and took their guns and equipment with them. In the line of the retreating army, nothing was left that could benefit the Turks. Railways and bridges were blown up and villages were burnt in what developed into a scorched-earth policy.\nAfter the Greek retreat, the Turkish forces managed to retake Sivrihisar on September 20, Aziziye on September 22 and Bolvadin and Çay on September 24.\nAftermath\nThe retreat from Sakarya marked the end of the Greeks' hopes to impose a settlement on Turkey by the force of arms. In May 1922, Papoulas and his complete staff resigned and was replaced by General Georgios Hatzianestis, who proved much more inept than his predecessor.\nOn the other hand, Mustafa Kemal returned to Ankara, where the Grand National Assembly awarded him the rank of Field Marshal of the Army and the title of Gazi to render its honours as the saviour of the Turkish nation.\nAccording to the speech that was delivered years later before the same National Assembly at the Second General Conference of the Republican People's Party, which took part from October 15 to 20, 1927, Ataturk was said to have ordered that \"not an inch of the country should be abandoned until it was drenched with the blood of the citizens\" once he realised that the Turkish Army was losing ground rapidly and that virtually no natural defences were left between the battle line and Ankara.\nLord Curzon argued that the military situation became a stalemate with time tending favour the Turks. Their reputation by the British was improving. In his opinion, the Turkish nationalists were more than ready to negotiate.\nThe Ankara government then signed the Treaty of Kars with the Russians and the most important Treaty of Ankara with the French, which reduced the Turkish army's front notably in the Cilician theatre and allowed it to concentrate against the Greeks to the west.\nFor the Turkish troops, the battle was the turning point of the war, which would develop in a series of important military clashes against the Greeks and drive the invaders out of Asia Minor during the Turkish War of Independence. The Greeks could do nothing but fight to secure their retreat. Next year, on August 26, the Turkish offensive started with Battle of Dumlupınar. Ataturk dispatched his army on a drive to the coast of the Aegean Sea to pursue the  Greek Army. That would culminate in the direct assault of Smyrna from September 9 to 11, 1922.\nThe war ended by the withdrawal of the Greeks from Asia Minor, as would be formalised by the Treaty of Lausanne, on 24 July 1923.\nGallery\nFile:GreekWoundedRecovery.jpg|Evacuation of wounded Greek soldiers\nFile:TurkishPrisoners.jpg|Collection of Turkish prisoners\nFile:GreekInfantryWaitinginCover.jpg|Greek infantry awaits order to attack\nFile:GreekAdvancePolatli.jpg|Greek infantry approaches the heights of Polatlı\nFile:Greek Evzones of the 1-38 Evzones Regiment advance towards Turkish positions, 1921.jpg|Evzones attack\nFile:Dead of Greek soldiers after the battle of Sakarya.jpg|Bodies of Greek soldiers after the Battle of the Sakarya\nFile:Battle of Sangarios 1921.png|Greek lithograph of the era, depicting the battle as a Greek victory\nFile:Mustafa Kemal & Salih.jpg|Mustafa Kemal and Salih (Bozok) at Duatepe Hill, observing enemy positions\nFile:Millimucadelekarikaturleri-1.JPG|\"Anatolia's present to Greece on the occasion of the new year\".
