The two historically largest parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, arose from a split in the original Sinn Féin. Fine Gael is the successor of Cumann na nGaedheal, the faction that supported the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, while Fianna Fáil arose from members of the anti-Treaty faction who opposed Sinn Féin's abstensionism. The division on the Treaty had also caused the Irish Civil War (1922–1923), leading to the difference between the parties being described as \"Civil War politics\", to distinguish it from a more common left-right political divide. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together are sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"FFG\".\n, Fianna Fáil is the largest party in Dáil Éireann, followed by Sinn Féin in second, and closely by Fine Gael in third position. The Labour Party was formed in 1912, and it had usually been the third party in parliamentary strength, though it is currently the fourth largest party in the Dáil, followed closely by the Social Democrats in fifth.\nThe Electoral Commission maintains a Register of Political Parties under the Electoral Reform Act 2022. Before the establishment of the Commission 2023, the register was maintained by the Houses of the Oireachtas. To register to contest national elections a party must have either at least one member in Dáil Éireann or the European Parliament, or 300 recorded members aged 18 or over. Parties that register only to contest elections in part of the state or in local elections need only 100 recorded members aged 18 or over. In either case, at least half of the recorded members must be on the register of electors.\nPolitical parties with representation at a local, national or European level\nParty details\nParty representation\nParties and groupings represented in the Oireachtas\nFianna Fáil\nFianna Fáil is the largest party in the Dáil, has the joint largest delegation of MEPs from Ireland, and has the largest number of city and county council seats. It has been in government more than any other party: 1932–1948, 1951–1954, 1957–1973, 1977–1981, 1982, 1987–1994, and 1997–2011, and since 2020. On all occasions up to 1989, it was in a single-party government; on all occasions since then it was the leading party in a coalition government. It is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and is led by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.\nIt was founded in 1926 by Éamon de Valera in a split from Sinn Féin. When Sinn Féin refused to drop its abstentionist stand, de Valera led most of its TDs out of that party with a view toward republicanising the Free State from within. It was founded as a radical anti-Treaty party drawing support from small farmers and urban workers but has since become a party of the establishment. It was first elected to power in 1932 on a constitutional republican platform, promising to remove constitutional links with Britain and reduce poverty by creating employment. It oversaw much of the industrial development of the Republic and has consequently drawn support from all social classes, making it a classic populist party.\nFianna Fáil has 48 TDs, 19 senators, four MEPs and 246 councillors.\nSinn Féin\nSinn Féin is the second largest party in the Dáil and the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The name Sinn Féin, meaning \"ourselves\" or \"we ourselves\", has been used by a number of political organisations in Ireland since 1905, when first used by Arthur Griffith. Sinn Féin was the party of separatism before Irish independence, and broke through in the Westminster election of 1918, where it won 73 of the 105 Irish seats.\nThe modern-day Sinn Féin party emerged in 1970 after a split in the party, and was often distinguished as Provisional Sinn Féin. It was closely linked to the Provisional Irish Republican Army. It is led by Mary Lou McDonald.\nSinn Féin has 39 TDs, six senators, two MEPs and 99 councillors in the Republic of Ireland.\nFine Gael\nFine Gael is the third largest party in the Dáil, the second largest party in local government in Ireland and has joint largest delegation of MEPs from Ireland.

It is a member of the centre-right European People's Party and is led by Tánaiste Simon Harris. Counting the tenure of  predecessor Cumann na nGaedheal, Fine Gael has been in government in the periods 1922–1932, 1948–1951, 1954–1957, 1973–1977, 1981–1982, 1982–1987, 1994–1997, and 2011 to date.
