Candidate games must have been released in the United Kingdom between 26 October 2007 and 31 December 2008. The ceremony took place in the London Hilton on 10 March 2009. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare & Grand Theft Auto IV led with the most nominations with seven, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was the major winner, taking three of the seven awards available.\nTimeline\nAll entries (from either a game's publisher or developer) received before 5 November 2008, were voted on by a first stage panel after grouping into categories by BAFTA. The six games with the most votes in each category move on to a second stage where they are scrutinised by a jury of between seven and nine from December 2008 until January 2009, picked especially for each category. Once the jury has played all the games in a category, a vote by secret ballot decides the winners; the votes were counted by Deloitte LLP.\nNominations\nNominations were announced on 10 February 2009. Along with Call of Duty 4, leading the field on seven nominations was Grand Theft Auto IV, just behind with six nominations was LittleBigPlanet. Despite garnering the joint most nominations, Grand Theft Auto IV would fail to capture any of the awards. LittleBigPlanet similarly failed to live up to the number of nominations by scooping only one gong despite its six nominations.\nCategories\nBoth publishers and developers were eligible to enter their games in fifteen categories, fourteen of which were awarded by a panel of judges. The categories were: Gameplay, Casual, Sports, Story and Character, Strategy, Use of Audio, Multiplayer, Technical Achievement, Original Score, Handheld, People's Choice (the only award voted for by the public), Artistic Achievement, Best Action and Adventure and Best Game.\nThere was surprise in the announcement of Super Mario Galaxy as the winner of the main award of Game of the Year, as well as the fact that Grand Theft Auto IV did not receive any of the prizes, despite leading the nominations list. Grand Theft Auto IV failed to win an award after receiving six nominations, replicating the \"feat\" managed by Gears of War at the preceding ceremony.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are shown first in bold.\n{| class=wikitable\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Fable II – Lionhead Studios/Microsoft Game Studios'\n**Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare – Infinity Ward/Activision\n**Dead Space – Visceral Games/Electronic Arts\n**Grand Theft Auto IV – Rockstar North/Rockstar Games\n**Prince of Persia – Ubisoft Montreal/Ubisoft\n**Tomb Raider: Underworld – Crystal Dynamics/Eidos Interactive\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Race Driver: Grid – Codemasters/Codemasters'\n**FIFA 09 – EA Canada/EA Sports\n**Football Manager 2009 – Sports Interactive/Sega\n**MotorStorm: Pacific Rift – Evolution Studios/Sony Computer Entertainment\n**Pure – Black Rock Studio/Disney Interactive Studios\n**Wii Fit – Nintendo EAD Group No. 5/Nintendo\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'LittleBigPlanet – Media Molecule'\n**''Assassin's Creed – Ubisoft Montreal/Ubisoft\n**Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare – Infinity Ward/Activision\n**Dead Space – Visceral Games/Electronic Arts\n**Gears of War 2 – Epic Games/Microsoft Game Studios\n**Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots – Konami/Konami\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Civilization Revolution – Firaxis Games/2K Games'\n**Advance Wars: Dark Conflict – Intelligent Systems/Nintendo\n**Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 – EA Los Angeles/Electronic Arts\n**Ninjatown – Venan Entertainment/SouthPeak Games\n**SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Tactical Strike – Slant Six Games/Sony Computer Entertainment\n**Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise – Rare/THQ\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Super Mario Galaxy – Nintendo EAD Tokyo/Nintendo'\n**Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare – Infinity Ward/Activision\n**Fable II – Lionhead Studios/Microsoft Game Studios\n**Fallout 3 – Bethesda Game Studios/Bethesda Softworks\n**Grand Theft Auto IV – Rockstar North/Rockstar Games\n**Rock Band – Harmonix/MTV Games and Electronic Arts\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare – Jesse Stern, Infinity Ward/Activision'\n**Assassin's Creed – Corey May, Ubisoft Montreal/Ubisoft\n**Fable II – Peter Molyneux, Lionhead Studios/Microsoft Game Studios\n**Fallout 3 – Emil Pagliarulo, Bethesda Game Studios/Bethesda Softworks\n**Grand Theft Auto IV – Dan Houser, Rupert Humphries, Rockstar North/Rockstar Games\n**Mass Effect – Drew Karpyshyn, BioWare/Microsoft Game Studios\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Boom Blox – EA Los Angeles and Amblin Interactive/Electronic Arts'\n**Buzz!: Quiz TV – Relentless Software/Sony Computer Entertainment Europe\n**Guitar Hero World Tour – Neversoft/Activision\n**LittleBigPlanet – Media Molecule/Sony Computer Entertainment\n**SingStar Vol. 2 – London Studio/Sony Computer Entertainment\n**Wii Fit – Nintendo EAD Group No. 5/Nintendo\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Spore – Maxis/Electronic Arts'\n**Assassin's Creed – Ubisoft Montreal/Ubisoft\n**Fable II – Lionhead Studios/Microsoft Game Studios\n**Fallout 3 – Bethesda Game Studios/Bethesda Softworks\n**Grand Theft Auto IV – Rockstar North/Rockstar Games\n**LittleBigPlanet – Media Molecule/Sony Computer Entertainment\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare – Infinity Ward/Activision'\n**Grand Theft Auto IV – Rockstar North/Rockstar Games\n**Left 4 Dead – Valve/Valve\n**Mario Kart Wii – Nintendo EAD/Nintendo\n**Rock Band – Harmonix/MTV Games and Electronic Arts\n**Super Mario Galaxy – Nintendo EAD Tokyo/Nintendo\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Dead Space – Visceral Games/Electronic Arts'\n**Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare – Infinity Ward/Activision\n**Gears of War 2 – Epic Games/Microsoft Game Studios\n**Grand Theft Auto IV – Rockstar North/Rockstar Games\n**LittleBigPlanet – Media Molecule/Sony Computer Entertainment\n**Super Mario Galaxy – Nintendo EAD Tokyo/Nintendo\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Professor Layton and the Curious Village – Level-5/Nintendo'\n**Geometry Wars: Galaxies – Bizarre Creations and Kuju Entertainment/Sierra Entertainment\n**God of War: Chains of Olympus – Ready at Dawn and Santa Monica Studio/Sony Computer Entertainment\n**The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass – Nintendo EAD/Nintendo\n**Patapon – Pyramid and Japan Studio/Sony Computer Entertainment\n**Soul Bubbles – Mekensleep\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Boro Toro – DarkMatter Designs'\n**Origamee\n**Vegeme\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Left 4 Dead – Valve/Valve'\n**Buzz!
