      "text": "# Battle-Sphere\n\nBattle-Sphere is a 2-player science fiction combat board game that was published by Sten Productions in 1978.\nGameplay\nBattle-Sphere is a game which involves a group of rebel ships assaulting an imperial Battle-Sphere that is stranded and defenseless without a necessary component. The Imperial player tries to deliver the missing component; the rebel player tries to either destroy the Battle-Sphere before it is operational again, or destroy the ship that is delivering the component. If the Imperial player is able to repair the Battle-Sphere, its powerful armament will usually overwhelm the rebels.\nComponents\nThe game comes with the following components:\n* 18\" x 14\" map\n* game rules\n* fictional explanatory notes\n* cardboard counters for the rebel and Imperial ships\nVictory conditions\nThe player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner:\n* Imperial Battle-Sphere is worth 7 points (awarded to Imperial player if it survives, to the Rebel player if it is destroyed)\n* Rebel captain is worth 3 points (awarded to the Imperial player if the captain dies, to the Rebel player if the captain survives)\nReception\nIn the June 1979 edition of Dragon (Issue #26), Tony Watson called Battle-Sphere \"a fairly clever, if simple, game. It is ideal for an evening of easy gaming, but still requires enough thought to make it all interesting.\"\nReferences"
