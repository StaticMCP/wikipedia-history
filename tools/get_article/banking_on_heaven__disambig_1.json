Banking on Heaven was directed by Dot Reidelbach and written, produced, and narrated by Laurie Allen, who escaped a similar polygamous sect at age sixteen (her uncle was Ervil LeBaron).\nBanking on Heaven focuses on the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church), a schismatic  polygamous sect of the Latter Day Saint movement that (at the time of the creation of the film) existed in Colorado City, Arizona. The documentary holds interviews with many escapees as well as those that have been excommunicated from the church. The documentary also interviews law enforcement as well as Utah and Arizona State politicians and poses questions on what can be done to rescue or help the women of the FLDS.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bankingonheaven.com/ Official site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630031729/http://www.bankingonheaven.com/BYUArticle.pdf review from Brigham Young University]\n*"
