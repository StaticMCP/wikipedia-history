In November 2014, YouTube announced its intentions to reinvent the purpose of the award show. Additionally, the site announced there will be no live ceremony for the awards. YouTuber Tyler Oakley hosted the awards presentation.\nBackground and announcement\nIn 2013, the inaugural YTMAs experienced mixed to negative reception due to technical difficulties, as well as having most of its award winners originate from mainstream music, rather than YouTube itself. Additionally, the director and hosts of the award show, were not allowed to rehearse prior to the ceremony's filming in a New York City warehouse at Pier 36. In 2014, no award ceremony was held. Instead, toward the end of the year, YouTube announced there would be an award ceremony held in March 2015. On March 12, 2015, YouTube released an official video announcing that the show will be held on March 23.\nYouTube tweaked the purpose of the awards, however, as they shifted from honoring, \"artists and songs that YouTube fans have turned into global hits over the past year,\" to, \"recognize the biggest and emerging artists to watch on YouTube in 2015.\" Additionally, the setting of the ceremony was announced to no longer be presented in the form of a live show. Instead, for one day in March 2015, the website will spotlight music videos as, \"music will be the headline act on YouTube.\" Although differences in the presentation format and purpose of the awards were announced, Kia Motors and VICE Media maintained their status as sponsors of the YTMAs.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist\n!Song\n|-\n| Charli XCX\n| \"Famous\"\n|-\n|Action BronsonChance the Rapper\n| \"Baby Blue\"\n|-\n| CahootsRoomie\n| \"No Money\"\n|-\n| FKA twigs\n| \"Glass & Patron\"\n|-\n| KygoParson James\n| \"Stole the Show\"\n|-\n| Lindsey Stirling\n| \"Take Flight\"\n|-\n| Martin GarrixUsher\n| \"Don't Look Down\"\n|-\n| Max SchneiderHoodie Allen\n| \"Gibberish\"\n|-\n| Migos\n| \"One Time\"\n|-\n| Megan Nicole\n| \"Escape\"\n|-\n| Nicky JamEnrique Iglesias\n| \"El Perdon\"\n|-\n| Shamir\n| \"Call It Off\"\n|}\nWinners\nOn March 2, 2015, YouTube released an official video announcing the winners.\nReferences\nExternal links"
