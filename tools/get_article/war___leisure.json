The album was preceded by the release of the first single: \"Sky Walker\" featuring Travis Scott. The album features further guest appearances from Rick Ross, Quiñ, Kali Uchis, J. Cole and Salaam Remi, with production led by Miguel himself, alongside a variety of contributors including Happy Perez, Steve Mostyn, David Andrew Sitek, Detail, Raphael Saadiq, Jeff Bhasker, Jerry \"Wonda\" Duplessis and Salaam Remi, among others.\nBackground\nHe describes the album as having \"political undertones, because that’s what life feels like right now\". He also announced that a Spanish version of the album is in the works.\nRelease and promotion\nAn early version of the song \"Come Through and Chill\" was uploaded to Miguel's SoundCloud page on June 23, 2016. It did not feature vocals by J. Cole, but ended up on the final version.\nThe album's lead single, \"Sky Walker\", featuring American rapper Travis Scott was released on August 24, 2017. The song charted at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Miguel's second-highest-charting single as a lead artist since 2012's \"Adorn\". The song was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was also certified gold by Music Canada (MC), becoming Miguel's first certified single in that country.\n\"Told You So\", was released on November 3, 2017, as the second single from the album.\nMiguel partnered with Revolve Impact and headlined in Schools Not Prisons, along with other partners in late 2017 to spread awareness of the overuse of mass incarceration in California. Footage from his Adelanto stop was used in the music video for \"Now\". He premiered medleys of \"Criminal\", \"City of Angels\", and \"Now\" on the tour.\nPromotional singles\nThe track \"Pineapple Skies\" was released on November 17, 2017, as a promotional single from the album.\nCritical reception\n|MC = 81/100\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = The A.V.

Reviewing for The Observer, Kitty Empire noted the record's musical daring and scope, while writing that \"Miguel's versatility and sureness of touch recall that of [[Michael Jackson| Jackson]] in his pomp\". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his capsule-review column for Vice, citing \"City of Angels\" and \"Sky Walker\" as highlights while finding the album overall to be \"more leisurely than the title might make you hope, believe, or fear\".\nCommercial performance\nWar & Leisure debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 and topped the Billboard US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart with sales 40,000 album-equivalent units in its first week of release.
