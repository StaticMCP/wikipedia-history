The team initially played as an NAIA Independent program with a mixed schedule of NAIA, NCAA Division II and NCAA Division I FCS competition. The Royals left independent status after the inaugural season when The Sun Conference announced football as a conference sport starting in the 2014 season. After two seasons, the conference announced a football merger with the Mid-South Conference in 2016. Warner and the other conference rivals became affiliate members in the Mid-South, participating in the Sun Division for football.\nTheir football team gained national recognition after losing 98-0 to Stephen F. Austin on September 24, 2022.\nMen's volleyball\nWarner University was the first college/university to offer a varsity men's volleyball program in the state of Florida. The men's volleyball program participates in the Mid-South Conference. The program initially competed in the Mid-America Men's Volleyball Intercollegiate Conference (MAMVIC). The program made back-to-back appearances in the NAIA Men's Volleyball National Invitational Tournament in 2011 and 2012.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
