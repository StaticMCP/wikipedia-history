They were often intertwined with broader regional dynamics, including the movement of nomadic Kazakh tribes, Qing frontier garrisons, and the Qing efforts to secure trade routes and impose tribute from steppe polities. These engagements marked a turning point in Kazakh–Qing relations, shifting the balance of power in favor of the Qing and influencing Kazakh migration and political alignment in the eastern steppe.\nWhile the conflicts did not result in a permanent Qing annexation of Kazakh lands, they significantly affected the political and military strategies of both sides. For the Kazakh Khanate, the encounters demonstrated the growing influence of the Qing in Central Asia and reinforced the need for diplomacy and strategic accommodation. For the Qing Empire, these engagements were part of a broader effort to consolidate its western frontier following the conquest of the Dzungars and to stabilize trade and tribute relations across Central Asia.\nThe conflicts also had long-term implications for steppe geopolitics, contributing to eventual Russian involvement in the northern Kazakh territories and setting the stage for later Kazakh–Qing treaties and border arrangements in the 19th century.\nBackground\nAfter the Dzungar Khanate fell with the Final Conquest of Dzungars and Dzungar genocide, with the Dzungar population exterminated leading to a power vacuum in the eastern steppe which had previously served as a buffer between the Kazakh Khanate and Qing-controlled territories. Kazakh leaders in the Middle and Senior Jüz now faced increased pressure from Qing forces seeking to consolidate control over the region formerly dominated by the Dzungars.\nDisputes over pasturelands, caravan routes, and tribute obligations increasingly strained relations. Qing officials demanded submission and tribute from Kazakh leaders, while Kazakh tribes resisted encroachments on their traditional territories. Raiding—both defensive and retaliatory—further inflamed tensions. These escalating disputes ultimately set the stage for the outbreak of the First Kazakh–Qing Wars, as both sides sought to assert control over the steppe and its valuable resources.\nHistory\nCourse of the War / Campaigns\nThis brought Qing forces into direct contact with the Middle and Senior Jüz of the Kazakh Khanate. Initial conflicts arose from border disputes along the steppe, where Kazakh tribes resisted Qing garrisons and attempts to enforce tribute payments. Skirmishes often involved small raiding parties rather than large set-piece battles, reflecting the mobile, cavalry-based warfare typical of the steppe.\nThe Qing responded to Kazakh resistance with more organized campaigns. Troops stationed in former Dzungar lands were reinforced with artillery and infantry units capable of sieging fortified Kazakh settlements. The Qing implemented a strategy of targeted punitive expeditions: raiding tribes that refused tribute, destroying supplies, and capturing livestock to weaken Kazakh resistance. At the same time, the Kazakhs conducted counter-raids on Qing supply lines and outposts, attempting to disrupt the Qing advance without committing to open-field battles.\nMajor Engagement, Battle of Shiderty\nKazakh Khanate\n| combatant2        =  Kalmyk Khanate\n| commander1        = Qabanbai Batyr\n| commander2        = DardanKhadakh\n| strength1         = Unknown\n| strength2         = 20,000\n| casualties1       = Unknown\n| casualties2       = 17,000\n}}\nLater, Battle of Shiderty River took place in 1756 in the headwaters of the Shiderty River, near Bayan-аul. The Kazakhs, led by batyrs Kabanbay, Kozhabergen, and Bogenbay, defeated the forces led by Generals Dardan and Khadakh. The site of this battle has retained the name \"Shurshit kyrilghan\" (\"place of the defeat of pursuts, i.e., the Manchurian-Chinese\").\nThe decisive Kazakh-Chinese battle erupted in the headwaters of the Shiderty River to the west of Bayan-Aul. Only 3,000 out of 20,000 Chinese soldiers remained alive. Significant losses, food shortages, and the onset of harsh winter forced the Chinese authorities to recall the remnants of their troops. The victory of the Kazakhs was costly but nonetheless significant.\nSee also\n* Dzungar Genocide\n* Battle of Shiderty\n* Dzungar-Qing wars\nReferences"
