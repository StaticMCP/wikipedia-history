It entered into force on 16 March 2009, following the ratification or accession of ten countries, namely Singapore, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Romania, Denmark, Latvia, Kyrgyzstan, United States, Moldova, and Australia. The treaty establishes common standards for procedural aspects of trademark registration and licensing.\nThe treaty was built on the Trademark Law Treaty of 1994 (TLT), however the Singapore Treaty was meant to have a wider scope of application and addresses more recent developments in the field of communication technologies.\nAs of September 2025, there are 56 contracting parties to the treaty, which includes 54 states plus the African Intellectual Property Organization and the Benelux Organization for Intellectual Property.\nSee also\n* Patent Law Treaty\n* Design Law Treaty\n* Trademark Law Treaty (1994)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/singapore/ Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks] in the WIPO Lex database — official website of WIPO.\n** The full text of the [http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=290019 Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks]"
