In Particular, there are two sites (Monuments) approximately 200 meters from each other which show where the great Kings were individually captured (Kabalega on the right and Mwanga on the left of the current road going from Kaberamaido to kangai). According to site curator, David Oketcha, the Kings were flanked/ surrounded by the British forces who included Semei Kakungulu and trapped by the river to the south which they could not cross.\nLocation\nThe Kangai-Kabalega monument is located in Kangai subcounty in Dokolo district in Northern Uganda. The nearest major town to the monument is Kaberamaido town (8&nbsp;km away). There is ongoing work by the MINISTRY OF TOURISM, WILDLIFE & ANTIQUITIES to build a cultural Heritage Center to showcase this remarkable monument\nHistory\nDuring Kabalega's reign, the British made many attempts to capture him because of his resistance to colonial rules.\nIn 1872, Samuel Baker made Bunyoro an annex of the British protectorate which led to the fight between Kabalega and the whites.\nOn 9 April 1899, Kabalega was captured at Kangai in an ambush that was led by Semei Kakungulu. He was shot in the leg and arm. Kabalega was later exiled initially to Kenya, then to Kismayo in Somalia and lastly to Seychelles island where he died from in 1923.\nKabaka Mwanga was also captured on 9 April 1899 by Andereya Luwandaga in the same area with omukama Kabalega.\nAfter the capture of Mwanga and Kabalega, they were transferred to Kampala prior sending them to exiles.\nSee also\n* Omukama Kabalega\n* Kabaka Mwanga\nReferences"
