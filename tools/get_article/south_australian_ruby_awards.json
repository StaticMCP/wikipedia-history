They were named in honour of arts champion Dame Ruby Litchfield (1912–2001) .\nHistory and description\nThe Ruby Awards were introduced in 2006 by the Government of South Australia, named in honour of the late arts patron Dame Ruby Litchfield. She was the first woman appointed to the Board of the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, a founder member of Festival City Broadcasters, and a board member of numerous other organisations, including the Adelaide Festival of Arts, the South Australian Housing Trust and the Carclew Youth Performing Arts Centre.\nThe Awards were managed by Arts South Australia (formerly Arts SA) until 2018, when they were transferred to the Arts and Culture unit within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet.\nSince the year of inception, they have grown in number from eight to twelve.\nWinners\n2006–2009\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winners\n!\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n|-\n|Best Work or Event\n| Honk If You Are Jesus, State Theatre Company South Australia\n|Ikara – The Meeting Place, Tony Rosella, sculptor\n|When the Rain Stops Falling, Brink Productions\n|2008 OzAsia Festival\n|-\n|Community Impact (Under $100,000)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |SALA Festival\n(2006 Award program included one single award for Community Impact regardless of budget)\n|South Australian History Week\n|OzAsia Moon Lantern Festival\n|Seniors on Screen, Media Resource Centre\n|-\n|Community Impact (Over $100,000)\n|Bundaleer Forest Weekend\n|2007 Feast Festival\n|Port Augusta Re-Imagines\n|-\n|Innovation\n|Devolution, Australian Dance Theatre\n|Electro Acoustic Project, Zephyr Quartet\n|Trouble on Planet Earth, The Border Project\n|3xperimentia: Live Cut\n|-\n|Leadership in Arts Enterprise\n|Special projects under development, Craig Andrae\n|Fringe Benefits\n|Adelaide Festival Centre – Scenery and Engineering Workshops\n|The Tragical Life of Cheeseboy 2009 World Tour, Slingsby\n|-\n|Sustained Contribution by an Organisation\n|JamFactory Craft and Design\n|State Theatre Company South Australia\n|Adelaide Repertory Theatre\n|Patch Theatre Company\n|-\n|Sustained Contribution by an Individual\n|N/A\n|Leigh Warren\n|Timothy Sexton\n|Jane Hylton\n|-\n|'''Premier's Award for Lifetime Achievement\n|Frank Ford AM\n|Anthony Steel AM\n|Kym Bonython AO DFC AFC\n|Fiona Hall\n|}\n2010–2013\nThe Geoff Crowhurst Memorial Award was introduced in honour of actor and director Geoff Crowhurst (23 March 1951 – 4 July 2009).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
