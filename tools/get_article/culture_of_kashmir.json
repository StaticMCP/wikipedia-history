The culture of Kashmir was influenced by the Persian as well as Central Asian cultures after the Islamic rule of Kashmir. Kashmiri culture is influenced by Hinduism, Buddhism and later by Islam.\nEarly history\nVedic art and culture grew in Kashmir, and some early Vedic hymns were composed there.\nThe Bharata Natya Shastra, which is notable as an ancient encyclopedic treatise on the arts which has influenced dance, music and literary traditions in Indian culture, originated in Kashmir.\n2nd century BC writer Patanjali compiled his compendium on Yoga in Kashmir.\nThe Panchatantra is also said to have originated in this region.\nAt the time when Pali was the primary language for Buddhist literature in the rest of India, all the Buddhist literature produced in Kashmir was in Sanskrit.\nKashmiri women held high status in society, as Bilhana records that Kashmiri women were fluent both in Sanskrit and Pali.\nKosh Shastra, a work on the science of sex, second to the Kamasutra, was developed in Kashmir.\nSome more examples of the major texts that also originated in Kashmir are the  Vigyan Bharaiv Tantra, Yoga Sutras, Sapndi Karkika Tantra Loka and Para-Trisika-Vivarana.\nCuisine\nRice is the staple food of Kashmiris and has been so since ancient times. Meat, along with rice, is the most popular food item in Kashmir. Kashmiris consume meat voraciously. Despite being Brahmins, most Kashmiri Hindus are meat eaters. Kashmiri beverages include Noon Chai or Sheer Chai and Kahwah or Kehew.\nThe Kashmir Valley is noted  for its bakery tradition. Bakers sell various kinds of breads with golden brown crusts topped with sesame and poppy seeds. Tsot and tsochvor are small round breads topped with poppy and sesame seeds, which are crisp and flaky; sheermal, baqerkhayn (puff pastry), lavas (unleavened bread) and kulcha are also popular. Girdas and lavas are served with butter. Kashmiri Bakarkhani has a special place in Kashmiri cuisine. It is similar to a round naan in appearance, but crisp and layered, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It is typically consumed hot during breakfast.\nFile:The Great Kashmiri Salt tea.png|Kashmiri Samovar and Noon Chai\nFile:Rogan josh02.jpg|Rogan Josh\nFestivals\n}}\nKashmiri Hindus\nPrimary festivals of Kashmiri Hindus include:\n* Herath (Shivaratri)\n* Khetchmaavas\n* Zyeth Atham\n* Tiky Tsoram\n* Pann\n* Gaad Batt\nKashmiri Muslims\nPrimary festivals of Kashmiri Muslims include:\n*Eid al-Adha\n*Eid al-Fitr\n*Shab-e-barat\n*Shab-e-Mehraj\n*Eid-e-Meelad Un Nabi\n*Nowruz\nLanguage and literature\n}}\nKashmiri or Koshur (}}, , ) is a language from the Dardic subgroup of Indo-Aryan languages, spoken by around 7 million Kashmiris, primarily in the Indian administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
