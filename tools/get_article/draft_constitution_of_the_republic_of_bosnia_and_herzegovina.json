Wartime conditions (1992–1995) created a need to consolidate the legal framework of the internationally recognized state and ensure institutional continuity. The 1993 constitutional text provided the core organizing norms for the republican authorities under exceptional circumstances.\nDrafting and adoption (February–March 1993)\nOn 24 February 1993 the Presidency adopted a decision determining the consolidated text of the constitution; the text and the decision were published in the Official Gazette (Year II, No. 5) on 14 March 1993, at which point the constitution entered into legal force.\nStructure and content\nThe 1993 constitution was organized into five broad parts:\n* General provisions (sovereignty, citizenship, symbols, territorial integrity; language and script);\n* Social and socio-economic order (property, labour, association and related principles);\n* Organization of the Republic — including the Assembly, the collective Presidency, the Government/Republic Administration, and the independent Constitutional Court;\n* Amendments (procedure for constitutional change);\n* Transitional and final provisions.\nThese headings and the distribution of competences are set out in the published consolidated text.\nInstitutions and political order\nUnder the constitution, legislative authority was vested in the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; the collective Presidency served as head of state; and executive functions were exercised by the Government and the republic administration. The Constitutional Court was established as an autonomous body with competence for constitutional review. Contemporary political-science surveys describe the wartime political order as a combination of the formal constitutional framework and significant constraints on implementation due to the conflict environment.\nApplication during the war (1993–1995)\nIn practice the constitution operated primarily on the territory under the control of the lawful authorities of the Republic. Even with limited territorial reach, it provided the legal basis for state organs and for the international representation of Bosnia and Herzegovina until the post-war settlement.\nRelationship to the 1994 Washington Agreement\nThe Washington Agreement (March 1994) created the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an internal unit and appended a proposed and then adopted constitution for the Federation. This reconfigured the sub-state governance architecture on territories with a Bosniak–Croat majority and co-existed with the republican constitution until the adoption of the Dayton constitution in late 1995.\nSupersession by the 1995 Constitution\nArticle XII(1) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Annex IV, Dayton/Paris, 1995) provides that the new constitution enters into force as a constitutional act that amends and supersedes the 1993 republican constitution. Transitional provisions ensured continuity of existing laws and institutions pending harmonization with the new state framework.\nReception in scholarship\nLegal and comparative analyses describe the 1993 constitution as a crucial wartime foundation of state continuity and legitimacy, while emphasizing its transitional character given the rapid institutional changes brought by the Washington Agreement and the Dayton constitution.\nText and facsimiles\n* Službeni list RBiH, Year II, No. 5 (14 March 1993) — Presidency decision and full consolidated text (scan).\n* Wikisource transcription (Bosnian): .\n* Washington Agreement (Framework for the Federation, March 1994).\n* Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Annex IV, 1995).\nSee also\n* Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Washington Agreement\n* Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nReferences"
