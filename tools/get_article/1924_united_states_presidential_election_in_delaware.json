All contemporary 48 states were part of the 1924 United States presidential election. State voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nDelaware was won by the Republican nominee, incumbent President Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, over the Democratic nominee, Ambassador John W. Davis of West Virginia. Coolidge ran with former Budget Director Charles G. Dawes of Illinois, while Davis ran with Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska. Also in the running that year was the Progressive Party nominee, Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and his running mate Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana.\nThis was the last time a Republican won the presidency without carrying Kent County until 2024. This was also the last time until 2000 that an unsuccessful Democratic candidate was able to carry any of Delaware's counties.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Delaware\nNotes\nReferences"
