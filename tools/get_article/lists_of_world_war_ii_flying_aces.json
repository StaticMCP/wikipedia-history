Additionally, national policies differed; German, Italian, and Japanese pilots tended to return to the cockpit over and over again until they were killed.\nIt is not clear what impact each nation's rules for score crediting have on the counts listed below. Germans credited a shared victory to only one pilot, while the French credited full victory to all participants. British, Finnish and US air forces credited fractional shares of aerial victories, resulting in fractions, such as 11½, which might be for example 10 aircraft and three shares with the second pilot. Some U.S. commands also credited aircraft destroyed on the ground. The Soviets counted only solo kills, while group kills were counted separately, as did the Japanese. The Italian Air Force did not officially credit victories to individual pilots, but to their unit as a whole. Probable kills are usually left out of the list.\nIt is necessary to emphasize that the question of assessing and comparing the success rate of fighters by number of victories is one of the more problematic. There are disputes about what is \"shot down\" and what is \"air victory\", but the most problematic seems to be credibility of reports and reliability of its confirmation, which was substantially different in particular air forces. The most reliable is considered the confirmation of the victories in RAF, which based its counts on comparison of testimonials of participants andif possiblefilm material.\nAces\nGallery\nFile:Erich Hartmann voor zijn Bf 109 (G-6).jpg|Erich Hartmann, the highest scoring German and all time ace\nFile:Bazu0.jpg|Constantin Cantacuzino, the highest scoring Romanian ace and the 3rd highest scoring ace of the European Axis powers\nFile:Mato Dukovac.jpg|Mato Dukovac, the highest scoring Croatian ace\nFile:Eino Ilmari Juutilainen.jpg|Ilmari Juutilainen, the top flying ace of the Finnish Air Force and the highest scoring non-German fighter pilot\nFile:Squadron Leader Pattle of 33 Squadron RAF Greece IWM ME(RAF) 1260 (cropped).jpg|Marmaduke 'Pat' Pattle, the highest scoring British Commonwealth ace\nFile:Ivan Kozhedub 1.jpg|Ivan Kozhedub, the highest scoring Soviet and highest scoring Allied ace\nFile:George Beurling Vancouver 1943.jpg|George Beurling, the highest scoring Canadian ace\nFile:Richard Bong photo portrait head and shoulders.jpg|Richard Bong, the highest scoring US ace\nFile:Tetsuzo Iwamoto.jpg|Tetsuzō Iwamoto, Japanese Navy fighter ace, often credited with being the top scoring Japanese ace\nFile:Teresio Martinoli.jpg|Teresio Vittorio Martinoli, the highest scoring Regia Aeronautica ace\nAces\nAustralia\nThere were 103 air aces from Australia during the Second World War.
