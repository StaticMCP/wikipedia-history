It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\nSt. Helenaville was a small antebellum village and summer retreat located on the northeastern end of St. Helena Island. St. Helenaville was damaged by several major storms, which ultimately caused part of the village to fall into the sound. There is very little historical documentation of the village. Several remains of tabby and brick are evident.\nReferences"
