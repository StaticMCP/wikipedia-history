The nearest government secondary schools are Home Hill State High School in Home Hill to the east and Ayr State High School in Ayr to the north-east; however, these secondary schools may be too distant for a daily commute for students living in the south-west of Upper Haughton and so other options are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
