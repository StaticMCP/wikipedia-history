Its constitution was said to be a close copy of that of the Brotherhood.\nIn 2012, the  order had over 25,000 members from the Anglican, Episcopal, Lutheran (ELCA) and Roman Catholic churches.\nHistory\nThe order was founded in 1885 by Margaret J. Franklin and her Bible study class at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in New York. It is considered \"an order rather than an organization\" because its members commit to a Rule of Life, which includes a Rule of Prayer and a Rule of Service.\nThere were 5,000 members as of 1923 and its headquarters were at 84 Bible House, New York City.\nThe order marked its quasquicentennial or 125 years of existence in 2010.\nMembership and organization\nThe order was originally only open to female members of the Episcopal Church. That rule has since changed to also allow \"laywomen...of churches in communion with the Episcopal Church or of churches who are in the Historic Episcopate\".\nThe order has chapters both in the United States and in Augsburg, Germany, Rome, Italy, and Mostoles, Spain.\nMembers take lifelong vows to follow a \"Rule of Life\", including a \"Rule of Prayer\" and a \"Rule of Service\". Members also commit to praying daily for their clergy and offering assistance in building up the spiritual life of the parish.\nNotable members\n* Elizabeth Fry Page\n* Merry Ann Thompson Wright\nSymbols\nThe  order's emblem is a modified Greek cross inscribed with FHS, meaning “For His Sake”; the  order's watchword is Magnanimiter Crucem Sustine, meaning “With heart, mind and spirit uphold and bear the cross\".\nMotto\n\"For His Sake...\nI am but one, but I am one.\nI cannot do everything, but I can do something.\nWhat I can do, I ought to do.\nWhat I ought to do, by the grace of God I will do.\nLord, what will you have me do?\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.doknational.org Official Website]"
