Duke Charles agreed to name Emperor Charles as his successor.\nThe treaty was broken in 1534 when Duke Charles nominated King Francis I of France as his successor.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nExternal links\n*[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/16cen/gelre1543.html WHKMLA: Conquest of Gelre, 1543]"
