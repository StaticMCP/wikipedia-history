US President Calvin Coolidge is referred to, and the Wall Street crash of 1929 is ironically hinted at.\n*\"Three Mules\": tells of British Prime Ministers Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain who did little to prepare Britain for war and downplayed the threat Hitler posed to peace.\n*\"A League of Notions\": the title plays on and refers to the formation and earliest acts of the League of Nations at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference in Versailles. Several historical figures are mentioned, including US President Woodrow Wilson, British Prime Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and T. E.

The lyrics bemoan the difficulties of establishing new territorial boundaries for Russia, Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, Persia and Iraq.

It also refers to English writer Somerset Maugham and mentions French fashion designer Coco Chanel who returns to London from a holiday with a suntan. In the end the song alludes to King Edward VIII whose intention to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson led to his abdication (Abdication of Edward VIII) as King of The United Kingdom that's why he is leaving Buckingham Palace.
