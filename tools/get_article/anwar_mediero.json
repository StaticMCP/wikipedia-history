Belén Mediero travelled to Addis Ababa, where she met Ethiopian laboratory technician Alemaio Digate, who spoke Spanish. The pair married in Ethiopia, and after settling bureaucractic issues, Digate moved to Spain to join Belén and Anwar.\nCareer\nMediero started his career with local side Victoria at the age of seven, before joining Celta a year later. After five years with Celta, he was poached by Barcelona, a move which was investigated by FIFA, leading to Barcelona being sanctioned and Mediero being suspended for a year. Two serious injuries, one in 2017 and one in his final season with the club, hindered his game time at La Masia, and in 2020 he moved to Italy to sign for Atalanta. He won the Supercoppa Primavera in his first season with the club. In January 2022, he was loaned to Hellas Verona.\nIn December 2022, Mediero moved to the United Arab Emirates to sign for First Division League side Fursan Hispania, owned by former Celta player Míchel Salgado. After just a year in the United Arab Emirates, he returned to Spain, joining the reserve side of Lugo, Polvorín.\nDespite featuring regularly for Polvorín, Mediero joined fellow-Tercera Federación club Ourense in July 2024. However, he left the club in November of the same year, having made just four appearances. Just days after leaving Ourense, he signed for Santa Marta, but would only make two appearances before leaving the club at the end of 2024.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Club\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=3|League\n!colspan=2|Cup\n!colspan=2|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Fursan Hispania\n|2022–23\n|UAE Division 1\n|11||1||1||0||12||1\n|-\n|Polvorín\n|2023–24\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Tercera Federación\n|23||2||0||0||23||2\n|-\n|Ourense\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2024–25\n|4||0||0||0||4||0\n|-\n|Santa Marta\n|2||0||0||0||2||0\n|-\n!colspan=3|Career total\n!40||3||1||0||41||3\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
