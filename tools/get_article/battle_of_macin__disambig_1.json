The Russian army of 30,000 was commanded by Prince Nicholas Repnin, whereas the Turks, numbering about 80,000 men, were led by Koca Yusuf Pasha.\nBattle\nNikolai Repnin drew up a bold plan of attack, which implied that, in spite of any obstacles, they should attack the Ottomans earlier than they could calculate, and earlier than they would gather all the troops of the vizier's army. These troops approached in parts and, at the same time, with a lack of unity and firmness. At the same time, Turkish attacks were decisive and daring in their execution.\ncorps marched to the Maçin trenches – the left Ottoman flank – and seized them.\nmiddle corps entered the heights to the left and occupied the Turkish camp in the center.\nThen the Turkish right-flank army was vanquished by a charge of the Russian left, under Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov, and started retreating in disorder. Kutuzov's stroke was conclusive.\nThe Ottomans, at that time, also intended to attack Golitsyn's right flank and rear from Brailov with a landing force, which Repnin had predicted, but 2 artillery batteries of  detachment, left by Repnin for such an occasion, forced the Turkish vessels to withdraw, which lost 7 pieces with the help of Volkonsky and Golitsyn reinforcements.\nAftermath\nRepnin gave his troops 2 days rest, having served a thanksgiving.\nThis battle hastened the signing of the Peace of Jassy, as did Ushakov's success at Kaliakria and Suvorov's success at Izmail.\nNotes and references\nCitations\n*"
