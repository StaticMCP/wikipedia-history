It was released on July 5, 2019 as the band's first album on their new label, Century Media Records.\nRelease and promotion\nInitial work on the album began in early 2018 following extensive touring in support of . Sean Beavan returned to work with the band once again, taking on mixing and production duties for the new album. The band announced the completion of the album on December 22, 2018 via their official Instagram page and a tentative release window of Spring 2019 was set.\nThe first single, \"American Landfill\", was released worldwide on April 5, 2019, alongside the official announcement of the July 5 global release date. Alongside the new album announcement, the band also announced a summer tour in support of Ministry. Frontman Mincolla described the new album as focusing on the idea of world versus world. According to Mincolla, \"If our debut album was focused on man vs. the world, and our sophomore album was man vs. himself, then I really wanted to Metawar to focus on the idea of world vs world, and the notion that if man doesn’t create his own world then he’s often crushed by the world of another.\"\nThe music video for \"American Landfill\" debuted on April 15, 2019. The video was directed by Matthew Charles Santoro, longtime friend of Alexis Mincolla and Hollywood director and visual effects artist whose credits include X-Men Origins: Wolverine and 300. \"Exxxit\" was released as the second single with an accompanying music video on April 23. \"The song hinges on a conceptual ultimatum and the human urge towards self-destruction as a form of liberation,\" Mincolla said. The video, which features performance artist Jeanelle Mastema suspended from hooks, was described as \"gruesome\" and \"NSFW\" and was inspired by concepts featured in Albert O. Hirschman's 1970 treatise Exit, Voice, and Loyalty. \"Exxxit\" premiered alongside a North American tour announcement featuring Author & Punisher and GOST as support.\nThe third single supporting the album, Affluenza, was released on May 31, 2019. Mincolla describes Affluenza as being \"the all-consuming epidemic of our time. It's a socially transmitted disease that infects via the prosthetic digital nervous system when exposed to the conspicuous consumption based infotoxins emitted from Kim Kardashian's ass.\" An official lyric music video was released for the single as well. The fourth single promoting the album, President X, was released on June 14, 2019. The single was accompanied by a music video featuring Mincolla as a neo-fascist lizard-man president in \"band's most outwardly political song to date.\"\nThe fifth single released was the band's cover of \"Pumped Up Kicks\" by Foster the People which was released on June 28, 2019. A fifth music video was released alongside the single as well. On why the band decided to do a cover song, Mincolla said \"Industrial bands have a long history of subverting popular culture songs...We’ve just always been a fan of this sort of thing and felt it would be a good time to take an iconic song of the late 2000s and give it some unexpected 2019 industrial darkness.\" On January 17, 2020, Altær was released as the album's sixth single along with a music video.\nWhile touring in support of Metawar, the band recorded one original track and two cover songs for the film Guns Akimbo. Their cover of You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) by Dead or Alive was featured in the film's trailer, and it was later announced that the second cover song would be The Ballroom Blitz originally recorded by The Sweet.\nComposition\nMetawar has been described as industrial metal industrial rock, industrial, nu metal, alternative metal, and electronic rock.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = Bring the Noise\n| rev2Score = 8/10\n| rev3 = Exclaim!\n| rev3Score = 8/10\n| rev4 = Maximum Volume\n| rev4Score = 8/10\n| rev5 = Kerrang!\n| rev5Score = 1/5\n| rev6 = Noizze\n| rev6Score = 8.5/10\n| rev7 = Sputnikmusic\n| rev7Score =\n| rev8 = Shropshire Star\n| rev8Score = 9/10\n}}\nMetawar received generally positive reviews from critics.
