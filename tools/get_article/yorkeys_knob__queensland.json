In the , Yorkeys Knob had a population of 2,794 people.\nYorkeys Knob is frequently listed as an unusual or humorous place name due to it including the word \"knob\".\nGeography\nYorkeys Knob is a beachside suburb north of the Cairns CBD. It is bounded by the Coral Sea to the north, Thomatis Creek to the east, Captain Cook Highway to the south, and Half Moon Creek to the north-west.\nYorkeys Knob is predominantly low-lying (less than 10 metres above sea level), with the exception of the hill (known as Yorkeys Knob), which rises to 60 metres on the coast at Yorkeys Point. The northern part of the suburb, near the coast, is residential, but the majority of the land use is agricultural, mainly growing sugarcane. There is a long, sandy beach along the Coral Sea.\nThe Finfish Group operate a 17-hectare pond farm (called Ponderosa), which is capable of producing 350 tonnes of fish per annum. They principally raise giant grouper, because they are fast growing and have a high commercial value.\nHistory\nYorkeys Knob is situated in the traditional country of the indigenousl  Djabugay (Tjapukai) people.\nYorkeys Knob got its name from George Lawson, a Yorkshire-born, Cairns-based beche-de-mer fisherman, from his nickname Yorkey, and \"knob\" meaning a rounded hill.\nOn 10 June 1886, Yorkey Lawson reported the loss of a man and his wife from Green Island. They had left to visit the wreck of the Upolu, intending to return the same day. Lawson conduced a search, but was unable to find any trace of them, not even evidence of an accident. The pilot cutter was sent to search for the couple.\nLawson built a homestead adjoining the Mount Buchan estate, near what is now Yorkeys Knob. During the off-season for fishing, he and his sons grew pumpkins, sweet potatoes and paddy melons, but that venture was not successful. Whatever the bandicoots and pigs didn't eat, the crocodiles did. Lawson used the mangroves near his homestead for the firewood and water needed for his beche-de-mer smoking station on Green Island, about  from the coast.\nYorkey's Knob State School opened on 18 February 1957. It originally occupied a site on corner of Wattle Street and Cunningham Street (). The school relocated to its current site in 1980 and the former site was given to the Musgrave Shire Council (now Cairns Regional Council) to become a community centre (known officially since 1996 as Old School Park). The SES occupied the former schoolhouse while the former teacher's residence was used to house a caretaker. A new community centre was built on the site of the school's old tennis courts. The park and its facilities were managed the Yorkeys Knob Activities Group until August 2021, when the Cairns Regional Council took control.\nLocals are attached to the name, despite the reaction it sometimes gets, given that \"knob\" is a slang term for the glans penis. In 2007, residents successfully prevented a developer from advertising a development as being at \"Yorkeys Beach\".\nDemographics\nAt the , Yorkeys Knob had a population of 2,766 people. At the , Yorkeys Knob had a population of 2,759 people and, at the , the population numbered 2,794 people.\nHeritage listings\nYorkeys Knob has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Second Innisfail Court House, 40 Buckley Street (), relocated to Yorkeys Knob as a private residence\nEducation\nYorkeys Knob State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 26-38 Clinton Street (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 252 students with 19 teachers (16 full-time equivalent) and 13 non-teaching staff (8 full-time equivalent).\nThe nearest government secondary school is Smithfield State High School in neighbouring Smithfield, to the west.\nAmenities\nYorkeys Knob Community Hall is at 58 Wattle Street (). It seats up to 80 people and is operated by the Cairns Regional Council.\nYorkeys Knob SES Facility is in the former schoolhouse at Old School Park at 58-64 Wattle Street (), adjacent to the community hall.\nHalf Moon Bay Marina is a  marina (). At the marina are the Yorkeys Knob Boating Club (). There is a public boat ramp at the marina (); it is managed by the Cairns Regional Council.\nNinth hole, Half Moon Bay Golf Club, 2007\nHalf Moon Bay Golf Club is located at the western end of Wattle Street (), and is a short but challenging layout which features a number of water hazards. It is 5,129 metres long and par is 70.\nThe swimming area is at the northern end of Sims Esplanade. It is patrolled for six months of the year by Surf Lifesaving Queensland, and has a stinger net to protect swimmers from box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri). The safest swimming is between the flags placed by the lifesavers; there have been drownings around the rocks a short distance away. There are barbecue and picnic facilities, plus public toilets and showers.\nThere are a number of parks in the area:\n* Haling Park ()\n* Old School Park, corner of Wattle Street and Cunningham Street ()\n* Ray Howarth Park ()\nCairns Go Kart Track is on the corner of Walker Street and the Captain Cook Highway ().\nWildlife\nThe golf club is a very good bird-watching location, with masked lapwings, bush stone-curlews, a range of kingfishers, rainbow lorikeets and sea eagles fairly easy to find. Between the 12th and 13th holes lies Ray Howarth Park, which is home to a huge colony of flying foxes, which you can see heading out searching for food in the early evenings. During the day they hang upside down from the mangrove's trees, and make an almighty din. When the melaleucas are in flower you will find them gorging on nectar in the trees at the northern end of Sim's Esplanade.\nA small bush track near the State school offers a chance to see a variety of birdlife, monitor lizards, and many skinks. Along the beach you will find pied oyster catchers, bush stone-curlews, ghost fiddler crabs and sand-bubbler crabs. At the rocks at the end of the beach keep an eye out of the beach tree skink scampering around the rocks looking for lunch, while you also watching for a pod of bottlenose dolphins that sometimes visit the small bay on the northern side of the groyne.\nTransport\nYorkeys Knob is serviced by Sunbus seven days a week.
