In the first part of the novel, Robin rescues Alan's sweetheart from an unwanted marriage to an old knight. They stop the bishop from proceeding with the ceremony, and Robin Hood, dressed in the bishop's robes, marries Alan to his bride. This gives way to the novel's main concern: the capture and ransom of Richard the Lionheart; (loosely based on the actual events). During his captivity Richard is driven to compose the song \"Ja nus hons pris\" or \"Ja nuls om pres\" (\"No man who is imprisoned\"), which is addressed to his half-sister Marie de Champagne. The song expresses his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister. However, this sorrow is resolved when Alan Dale spearheads a valiant and effort to release the king.\nReception\nThe novel has received some praise.
