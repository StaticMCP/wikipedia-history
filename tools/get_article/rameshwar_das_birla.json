He was second son of Baldeo Das Birla and the father of Madhav Prasad Birla and Gajanan Birla. He is known for founding hospitals & educational institutions in Mumbai, Kolkata and Pilani.\nBirla's decision in 1922 to remarry following the death of his first wife caused a split in the Maheshwari caste of which his family were a member. They were outcast by the community, who doubted that his new wife was herself a Maheshwari and thus believed that Birla had broken the caste rules relating to marriage.\nSee also\n*Birla family\nSources\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090103151802/http://www.bombayhospital.com/founder.htm#rameshwardas Bio on the web] URL accessed on 1 April 2006"
