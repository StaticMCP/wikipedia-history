It also has instant messaging, file transfer, support for calls to landline and mobile telephones (over traditional telephone networks), and other features.\nJami is free and open-source software released under the GNU GPL-3.0-or-later. Jami is developed by Savoir-faire Linux (SFL) and community contributors.\nJami is available for most desktop and mobile platforms. Internal builds of Jami for web browsers are yet to be publicly released. Jami is installed by default in Trisquel.\nHistory\nIn December 2004, Savoir-faire Linux launched the SFLPhone project to develop a digital telephone for businesses, entirely designed using open-source technologies. SFLPhone was a professional softphone that could manage an unlimited number of lines and calls on a daily basis. Compliant with telecommunications standards (SIP and IAX), it interconnected with the Asterisk software, a private branch exchange distributed under the free GPLv2 license or under a commercial license for GNU/Linux systems.\nIn November 2009, CIO magazine listed SFLphone among the top five open-source VoIP softphones to watch.\nIn May 2015, SFLphone was renamed to Ring. Ring integrated distributed architecture, which does not require a centralized server to establish communication.\nIn November 2016, Ring was integrated into the GNU project. Ring is free and open-source software released under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.\nIn December 2018, Ring was renamed to Jami to avoid confusion with commercial products also using the English term Ring.\nUse and design\nJami is an open-source voice over IP, videotelephony, and instant messaging platform. In 2025, TechRadar listed it as one alternative to Skype following its discontinuation.\nBy default, Jami uses an OpenDHT node maintained by Savoir-faire Linux to join the network when the user connects for the first time. However, the application gives users the choice to run this through their own server. Jami software creates its own peer-to-peer network over which it can distribute data across all systems connected to it.\nJami is available on various desktop (GNU/Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows), mobile (Android and iOS), television (Android TV), and server platforms. Jami for Web, allowing access with a web browser, has not yet been released to the public.\nJami is based on an MVC model, with a daemon (the model) and client (the view) communicating. The daemon handles all the processing, including the communication layer (SIP and IAX), audio capture and playback, and so on. The client is a graphical user interface. D-Bus can act as the controller, enabling communication between the client and the daemon.\nFeatures\nAvailable features depend on both the Jami client and the platform used.\n* Operates on a peer-to-peer basis without a central server. Jami can be used on local networks without an Internet connection.\n* End-to-end encryption used for chat, video, and voice.\n* SIP-compatible with OpenDHT support.\n* Instant messaging.\n* Call recording.\n* Audio and video calls with multi-party audio and video conferencing.\n* Multiple audio codecs supported: G.711u, G.711a, GSM, Speex (8, 16, 32&nbsp;kHz), Opus, and G.722 (silence detection supported with Speex).\nRelease history\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+ Jami releases\n!Release name\n!Release date\n!Notes\n|-\n!SFLphone\n|December 23, 2004\n|Initial revision\n|-\n!Ring\n|May 5, 2015\n|SFLphone renamed to Ring\n|-\n!Samuel de Champlain\n|\n|\n|-\n!Louis-Joseph Papineau\n|March 16, 2016\n|\n|-\n!GNU Ring\n|November 3, 2016\n|Officially a GNU package, following its integration into the GNU project\n|-\n!Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité\n|July 21, 2017\n|\n|-\n!In varietate concordia\n|February 1, 2018\n|\n|-\n!Live free or die\n|July 17, 2018\n|\n|-\n!GNU Jami\n|December 18, 2018\n|Ring renamed to Jami\n|-\n!Free as in Freedom\n|November 15, 2019\n|\n|-\n!Together\n|October 16, 2020\n|Improvements to videoconferencing\n|-\n!Maloya\n|June 3, 2021\n|\n|-\n!Világfa\n|February 20, 2023\n|\n|-\n!Eleutheria\n|November 27, 2023\n|\n|-\n!Astarte\n|June 14, 2024\n|\n|-\n!Εἰρήνη\n|March 26, 2025\n|\n|-\n!Atlas\n|September 23, 2025\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of SIP software\n* List of free and open-source software packages\n* Comparison of instant messaging clients\n* Comparison of VoIP software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
