The main house was built about 1860, and is a two-story, five-bay, T-shaped frame dwelling in the Greek Revival style. It consists of a projecting three-bay, pedimented pavilion with flanking one-bay, hip-roofed wings.  It has a hipped roof and is sheathed in weatherboard siding. In 1937 a kitchen wing was added to the rear elevation of the dwelling.  Also on the property are a contributing smokehouse (c. 1860), a covered well and the sites of an icehouse, kitchen, dairy, and corncrib.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.\nReferences"
