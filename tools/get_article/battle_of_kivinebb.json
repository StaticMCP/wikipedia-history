Despite being severely outnumbered, Swedish forces won the battle due to superior knowledge of the region and using skis for mobility. The battle is briefly mentioned in the Lebedev Chronicle, which says that in 1555 Ivan Bibikov with a number of common men was sent to push Swedes to exchange some Russian citizens who were forcibly held in Sweden and to punish the Swedes for attacking the nearest Russian settlements, but was defeated.\nReferences"
