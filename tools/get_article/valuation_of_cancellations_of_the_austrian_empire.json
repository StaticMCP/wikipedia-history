It brings added value to the stamps by their historical significance. Other parameters are the rarity and the attractiveness. In particular, the stamps issued by the Habsburg monarchy during the 1850-1867 period (the 5 issues before the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867), are collected for their variety and beauty. A first publication on this topic was made by Hans Kropf in 1899. Edwin Mueller in his Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, published in 1961, described all postmarks used in the Austrian empire, Lombardy, Venetia and in the Austria post-offices in the Ottoman Empire. The relative valuation of those postmarks contains a popularity index, which is a multiplicative factor on top of the rarity.\nClosely related article is Postage stamps and postal history of Austria for a\nbetter understanding of the historical context.\nThe historical context\nThe Austrian Empire stamps were first issued on June 1, 1850: a coat of arms under the text KK Post-Stempel. The word Austria does not appear, which is logical, as the issue served in whole central Europe, more precisely in all or in part of the current following countries:\n* in the north the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland;\n* in the East Ukraine, Romania;\n* in the South Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Italy;\n* Austria and Hungary.\nThe languages used are German, Italian, Hungarian, Czech, Serbo-Croat, Polish and French Chargé.\nThis article is linked to the article Postage stamps and postal history of Austria. For a better understanding of the historical context, see the article Austria-Hungary.\nThe collection of cancellations of Austria\nCollecting of cancellations, in particular the 1850 issues of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia, has a long tradition. The first important collection of the kind was assembled by Hans Kropf. He published  The Cancellations of the stamps of Austria-Hungary and Lombardy-Venetia, a handbook with 959 different cancellation types, in 1899. His collection was purchased by King Fuad I of Egypt, and by Marc Fitch in 1954. The Jerger collection (see below) has made complements to this collection, with items from Baron Ferrari, Felix Brunner, Maurice Burrus, Arthur Caspary, Dale-Lichtenstein, the King Carol I of Romania, and others.\nThe system used by Edwin Mueller\nThe cancellations (or postmarks in more general terms) can be studied, classified and valuated based on the handbook, compiled by Edwin Mueller.\nEdwin Mueller describes each of the postmark type by a series of codes (13 basic forms, 5 types of lettering, with or without a year etc.), and idealized pictures.\nThe 505 types that have been used for each of the 3381 post-offices are documented from the first (I) to the fifth (V) issue, with their opening date: when relevant, the letter P means that the postmark was already in use in 1850 (precursor of the pre-stamp period).\nThe handbook relies on an original system of relative valuation. It is a valuation expressed in points, result of a double multiplicative content:\n* a point system which indicates the relative rarity, between 1 and 250\n* a popularity index, between 2 and 30.\nThe valuation points can thus vary (in principle) between 1 and 30 x 250 = 7500.\nThe market value of an ordinary type cancellation depends primarily only on its rarity index (1 by default), while if it displays attractive characters (color other than black, originality, beauty..), it is the multiplicative result of both indexes which determines the global Mueller valuation points.\nThe article further illustrates by a few examples this popularity index.\nThe popularity index\nIndex 1 : the basic types\nThe value of those cancellations depend only on their relative rarity (and on usual characteristics like their degree of completeness, cleanliness, centering (SON)...). This value is added to the stamp value, of course.\nSome examples :\nFile:6kreuzer sL-I S Pölten.jpg|Type sL-I of St. Pölten, 5p ('s' means cursive lettering, 'I' means Italic lettering)\nFile:5kr IssueII RDb-f Flitsch.jpg|Type RDb-f, of Flitsch, now Bovec, 12p ('Db' means double circle and usual ornament; 'f' means date without year)\nFile:RS-f Frankenmarkt.jpg|alt=Type RS-f (the most common - 2311 postoffices: S for simple circle, but rarity 35 for Frankenmarkt)|Type RS-f (the single circle is the most common postmark type, used by 2,311 post offices: 'S' for single circle.

Rapp, Zürich, 1977\n* Corinphila, Zürich, many.\nValuation of later postmarks\nAfter the death of Edwin Mueller in 1962, collectors felt the need to continue his work for later issues. Wilhelm Klein noticed a good continuity in many postmarks on the last issues in kreuzer. He thus decided to publish in 1967 a first part of the work, covering the issues 1867, 1883 and 1890. However, he dropped the Mueller system, presenting the rarity (Häufigkeit) and the popularity (Beliebtheit) in a single final point value. There are more than 700 images of postmarks, used by the 6186 fixed post offices (in the Austrian half of the monarchy) as of 30 September 1900.\nNotes and references"
