The street runs east–west through the town centre and is noted for its historic streetscape, heritage buildings, and views toward Mount Owen.\nHistory\nOrr Street was constructed and in use by 1901, when it already featured operating banks, hotels, and commercial offices. The street was named after William Orr (1843–1929), one of the early investors in the Mount Lyell mine. Among the most prominent buildings on the street is the Empire Hotel, completed in 1901 at the western end.\nThe street remained a commercial centre for much of the 20th century, though activity declined with the downturn of the Mount Lyell copper mine during the 1990s. Many original buildings remain, although most no longer serve their initial commercial or civic purposes.\nAt the western junction, Orr Street meets Driffield Street, which links to the Lyell Highway. The original Queenstown railway station, rail yards, and the line of the West Coast Wilderness Railway were located at the western end, providing the main connection with the outside world until the completion of road links such as the Lyell Highway and the Queenstown–Zeehan highway in the 1930s.\nOrr Street also contains significant civic buildings. The Queenstown Post Office, located on the street, was built in 1902, with its prominent tower added in 1909.\nOrr Street has been subject to periodic flooding. In April 1914, after a week of wet weather, heavy rain caused stormwater to overflow gutters and pour into shops on the southern side of the street, leaving floors covered with mud and silt. Further flooding was recorded in December 1938, when the street was again inundated.\nTo mitigate stormwater issues, the Queenstown Council undertook works in 1915 to renew kerbing between Sticht and McNamara streets, widening gutters to improve water runoff and reduce flooding of adjoining shops.\nIn the 1930s the street underwent resurfacing and improvements. In 1936 the Queenstown Municipal Council introduced bitumenising works and used a newly purchased diesel roller for reconstruction projects.\nThe street has also been a subject of cultural interest. In the 1930s the Queenstown Camera Club used Orr Street as a recurring subject for its photographic competitions.\nBefore bituminisation, the unsealed road surface required regular maintenance and resurfacing.\nGallery\nFile:Orr Street, Queenstown NS3245-1-251.jpg|Orr Street, 1896\nFile:Postcard - Snow in Orr Street, Queenstown, Western Tasmania LPIC147-5-354.jpg|Snow in Orr Street, date unknown\nFile:Orr_Street,_Queenstown,_Tasmania.jpg|Looking east up Orr Street, with the post office tower, 2010\nReferences\nExternal links"
