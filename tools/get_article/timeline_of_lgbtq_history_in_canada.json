For a broad overview of LGBT history in Canada see LGBT history in Canada.\n1600s\n* 1648: A gay military drummer stationed at the French garrison in Ville-Marie, New France is sentenced to death for sodomy by the local Sulpician priests. After an intervention by the Jesuits in Quebec City, the drummer's life is spared on the condition that he accept the position of New France's first permanent executioner. As only the drummer was placed on trial, the widespread consensus of many historians is that his sexual partner may have been a First Nations man who was not subject to French religious law. In his 2006 book Répression des homosexuels au Québec et en France, historian Patrice Corriveau identifies the drummer as \"René Huguet dit Tambour\", although other historians have challenged this identification as no known historical records place a person of that name in New France any earlier than 1680.\n*1691: Military officer Nicolas Daussy de Saint-Michel and two commoners, Jean Forgeron dit La Rose and Jean Filliau dit Dubois, are arrested on charges of sodomy. Saint-Michel, highly knowledgeable about the law, refuses to cooperate with the investigation, successfully arguing that under France's Grande ordonnance criminelle of 1670 a charge of sodomy could only be investigated by the Sovereign Council of New France rather than the local bailiwick; the case is transferred to Quebec City, where the council ultimately finds all three guilty. Dubois and La Rose are sentenced to additional time in the military, while Saint-Michel is fined 200 livres and exiled back to France.\n1800s\n* 1810: Alexander Wood, a merchant and magistrate in York (which will become Toronto in 1834), is embroiled in a sex scandal when he investigates a rape case by personally inspecting the penises of the suspected assailants for a scratch left by the woman who filed the rape charge.\n* 1832: Private Flowers, an infantryman, is sentenced to death for having sex with another man. His case remains virtually unknown until the premiere Private Flowers in 2023 created by mixed-media artist HAUI featuring Rodney Diverlus and Jera Wolfe.\n* 1838: George Herchmer Markland, a member of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, is forced to resign his seat after facing allegations of making sexual advances towards other men.\n* 1842: Patrick Kelly and Samuel Moore, the first two men in Canada historically recorded as having been criminally convicted of sodomy for what the court records clearly describe as consensual sexual activity, arrive at Kingston Penitentiary. Both men were sentenced to death, although their sentences are commuted on August 22; Moore is released from prison in 1849 and Kelly is released in 1853.\n* 1869: Buggery is no longer punishable by death in Canada, replaced instead by a maximum punishment of life in prison.\n1900–1950s\n1918\n* Montreal writers Elsa Gidlow and Roswell George Mills launch Les Mouches fantastiques, a mimeographed underground magazine which is the first known LGBT publication in Canadian and North American history. At least five issues are published before Mills and Gidlow move to New York City in the early 1920s.\n1943\n* In the Montreal literary magazine First Statement, John Sutherland publishes a review of the poetry of Patrick Anderson, intuiting homoerotic themes and accusing Anderson of \"some sexual experience of a kind not normal\". Although Anderson would in fact come out as gay later in life, he was married to a woman at the time; he threatened to sue, and First Statement printed a retraction in its following issue.\n1949\n* Jim Egan, a Toronto native who would later become a co-plaintiff in the landmark legal case Egan v. Canada, begins writing letters to newspapers and magazines protesting depictions of homosexuality and calling for reform of laws regarding homosexual Canadians. He writes his letters until 1964, when he and his partner move to British Columbia.\n1960s\nThe RCMP, throughout the late 1950s and the entirety of the 1960s, kept tabs on homosexuals and the patrons of gay bars in Ottawa and other cities. The force also worked with the FBI's own surveillance of homosexuals and alerted the FBI when a suspected homosexual had crossed the border to the United States.\n1962\n* Jackie Shane, a rhythm and blues singer from Toronto, has a chart hit with \"Any Other Way\". The song's lyrics include an explicit and deliberate play on the dual meaning of the word \"gay\". Shane, who performed in female clothing despite being male-identified at the time, would later come out as transgender, although this was not confirmed on the record by a media outlet until 2017.\n1963\n* The RCMP Directorate of Security and Intelligence's A-3 Unit (a unit dedicated to rooting out and removing all homosexuals from government and law enforcement, itself a subsection of the A Unit dedicated to finding out character flaws in government employees in the aftermath of the Second Red Scare) produced a map of Ottawa replete with red dots marking all alleged residences and frequent visitations of homosexuals. However, the map was soon filled with red ink and was disposed, and after two larger maps of the city being used to a similar purpose and outcome, the mapping soon ended.\n1964\n* Canada sees its first gay-positive organization, ASK, and first gay magazines: ASK Newsletter (in Vancouver), and Gay (by Gay Publishing Company of Toronto). Gay was the first periodical to use the term 'Gay' in the title and expanded quickly, including outstripping the distribution of American publications under the name Gay International.

Trudeau's characterization was captured in the statement that there was \"no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.\"\n1969\n* May 14: Canada decriminalizes homosexual acts between consenting adults with the passage of the Criminal Law Amendment Act first introduced in December 1968.

Neither man was out to the general public during his time in politics, although both were out among their caucus colleagues in the Parti Québécois. Both went on to serve as cabinet ministers when the Parti Quebecois formed government in 1976.\n*November 11: Richard Hatfield is sworn in as Premier of New Brunswick.

They will eventually become the lead plaintiffs in Vogel v. Canada, the case which leads to the legalization of Same-sex marriage in Manitoba in 2004 — however, as in 2021 Vogel and North lost their fight at the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench on June 1, 2021.
