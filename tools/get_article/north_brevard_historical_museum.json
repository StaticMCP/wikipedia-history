In December 1995, Patch then donated the museum building and the adjoining building to The Historical Society of North Brevard.  Patch recognized the \"value of an historical society to the community.\"\nThe museum houses historical artifacts, including historic postcards, photographs, clothing from as early as the 1870s, and a Seminole Indian display.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nbbd.com/godo/history/ North Brevard Historical Museum].
