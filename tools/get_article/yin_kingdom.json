It existed during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, but was not counted among the 15 regimes. Yin's only emperor was Wang Yanzheng, a member of the ruling clan of the Min state. After Wang Yanzheng took the Min throne in 945, Yin's territory was re-incorporated into Min, ending its existence as a separate polity. Soon after, the Min state was conquered by the Southern Tang dynasty.\nRebellion from Min\nThe Min Kingdom was founded in 909 after the Tang dynasty collapsed.  However, after the founder of the kingdom, Wang Shenzhi, died in 925, the sons squabbled with one another.  In 943, that led to an all out rebellion as one of Wang Shenzhi's sons, Wang Yanzheng, rebelled and carved out the Yin Kingdom out of the northwestern part of the Min Kingdom.\nTerritorial extent\nThe Yin Kingdom was rather small, occupying an area in present-day northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang.  It was bounded by Wuyue to the north, Min to the south and east, and the Southern Tang to the west.\nEnd of Yin as separate entity\nIn 944, Wang Yanzheng's brother and rival as the Emperor of Min, Wang Yanxi, was assassinated.  Wang Yanxi's general Zhu Wenjin claimed the Min throne.  In 945, Zhu was assassinated, and his army pledged allegiance to Wang Yanzheng as the Emperor of Min and asked him to return to the Min capital Changle.  Wang Yanzheng claimed the Min throne, ending Yin's existence as a separate state, but did not return to Changle; rather, he remained at his base of Jian Prefecture, which Southern Tang besieged later in the year, forcing his surrender.\nRuler\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Emperor of Yin\n|-\n!
