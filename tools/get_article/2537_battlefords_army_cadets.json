Although the RCAC and the other cadet programs are funded by the Canadian Forces and the civilian Leagues, cadets are not members of the Forces, and are not expected to join the Canadian Forces.  In keeping with Commonwealth custom, the Royal Canadian Army Cadets stand second in the order of precedence, after the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, and before the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.\nPeople aged 12 to 18 may join the RCAC, free of charge. Uniforms, training manuals, and instruction are provided. A cadet must leave the organization before their 19th birthday. Upon departing most items issued to them during their time in the program must be returned.\nThe organization and rank system of the Canadian Army is used, but cadets now use only Non-Commissioned Officer ranks, whereas at one time Commissioned Officer Cadet ranks (from Lieutenant up to and including Colonel) were used.  Army Cadet Corps are usually affiliated to a Reserve or Regular Force army regiment and wear the accoutrements of their affiliated unit. Adult leadership is provided by members of the Canadian Forces Reserve Subcomponent Cadet Organization Administration and Training Service composed mostly of officers of the Cadet Instructor Cadre (CIC) Branch, supplemented, if necessary, by contracted Civilian Instructors, authorized adult volunteers, and, on occasion, officers and non-commissioned members of other CF branches. The CIC Branch is specifically trained to deliver the Royal Canadian Sea, Army, and Air Cadet training program, and like all reservists come from all walks of life and all parts of the community. Some are former cadets, many have former regular or reserve force service.\nRCAC Badge\nThe Royal Canadian Army Cadet Badge is the official emblem of RCAC. It is worn on the upper sleeve of the cadet uniform and on the breast of the issue parkas. It is also worn as a brass cap badge in place of an affiliated unit badge or for non-affiliated corps.  The term Acer Acerpori is Latin for \"as the maple, so the sapling.\"\nAs a Cadet Corps affiliated with the North Saskatchewan Regiment, senior Cadets are authorized to wear the North Saskatchewan Regiment Cap Brass on their Beret.\nAim\nThe aim of Royal Canadian Army Cadets is to develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness; and stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land and air activities of the Canadian Forces. The RCAC shares this aim with the Sea and Air Cadets; however, each organization focuses on its own parent element.\nHistory\nCommanding Officers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Years\n!

From 1954 - 1963 the Corps paraded at facilities provided to them in the basement of the Battleford Central School.\n|-\n| 1963\n| In 1963 the Army cadets moved to the Armouries in North Battleford when the Militia (A Coy -  N Sask R) provided facilities and assistance with training.\n|-\n| 1970\n| Due to the closing of the Armouries the Corps moved back to Battleford where facilities were provided by the North Battleford School Unit #58, in what is now the Battleford Jr High School. Branch #9 Royal Canadian Legion took over sponsorship at that time.\n|-\n| 1991\n| The Army Cadet Corps paraded at the Air Cadet Hall, located at the North Battleford Airport, before moving to more spacious quarters.\n|-\n| 1993\n| The corps moved to the Battlefords Indian and Metis Friendship Centre in North Battleford, but due a change in ownership of the building the Corps had to move again.\n|-\n| 1994\n| Parade location was changed to the Convent of the Child Jesus building at 1201 - 104th Street until the Corps purchased its own location in 1997.\n|-\n| 1997\n| The Corps moved to 1761 - 99th Street, North Battleford which was purchased for the Cadets by the sponsoring committee.  This is the current Garrison and Local Headquarters for the Battlefords Army Cadets. With the new Headquarters, the Army Cadets sponsoring committee acquired the former \"Unity Youth Camp\", west of the Battlefords at Attons Lake to be used as a field training facility to achieve the objectives set out by the Army Cadet training program. The facility is available to the public and other groups when it is not in use by the Army Cadets.\n|-\n| 2013\n| The Corps stopped parading at 1761 - 99th Street, North Battleford and the building was put up for sale.  The Sponsoring Committee still maintains their training camp west of the Battlefords at Attons Lake.  The facility remains available to the public and other groups when it is not in use by the Army Cadets.\n|}\nCorps Parade History\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

The funding by the DND for Cadet activities extends to the issue of Uniforms and Equipment for authorized training.\nPublic support\nAs an Army Cadet corps the 2537 Battlefords Army Cadets are expected to participate in fundraising for activities for any additional requirements that are not provided by Program Funding.  Specifically the 2537 Battlefords Army Cadets maintain and pay for their training facilities through their fundraising efforts with the sponsoring committee for the corps.  The training facilities are not fully funded by the Program Funding and therefore fundraising is required to sustain operations for the Local Cadet Programme.\nSponsoring Committee\nThe sponsoring committee is responsible to the Commanding Officer to ensure that all fundraising needs are met for the year.  They form a committee of people that will manage the finances for the Battleford Army Cadets and are responsible to ensure that funding is secured for anything that would not be otherwise covered by Cadet Program funding.  The sponsoring committee is made up of volunteers that include parents, and people from the community.\nArmy Cadet Training\nStar Level Program\nThe Star Level Program is the main training program carried out by all Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps in Canada.  This program is mandated by the Department of National Defence, through the Directorate of Cadets & Junior Rangers.\nThe Star Level Program is composed of four levels:\n*Green Star (Level 1)\n*Red Star (Level 2)\n*Silver Star (Level 3)\n*Gold Star (Level 4)\n*Master Cadet (Level 5 and above)\nStarting in the 2012-13 training year, the National Star of Excellence or NSE replaced the National Star Certification Examination or NSCE as a ranking tool for Senior Cadets. Year 5 of LHQ training was also introduced as \"Master Cadet\" consisting of a great deal of On-the-job Training (OJT) and self-led professional development opportunities.\nCadets are taught a variety of subjects, known as Performance Objectives (PO) that include: citizenship, physical fitness, healthy living, drill, marksmanship, map and compass, outdoor survival, eco-friendly camping and military history and traditions.

The training supports and expands the Local Headquarters program. Courses last from two to six weeks, with most cadets attending the two-week \"General Training\" (Commonly referred to as \"GT\", as Basic is now a new section of three-week courses) Course in their first year. Experienced cadets may apply to be employed as staff cadets to assist the adult instructors.\nSummer Training Courses\nSummer Training Courses are as follows:\n*Cadet Activity Program 1 (CAP1) (1 Week)\n*Cadet Activity Program 2 (CAP2) (2 Weeks)\n*Expedition Instructor (EI) (4 Weeks)\n*Drill and Ceremonial Instructor (DCI) (4 Weeks)\n*Fitness and Sports Instructor (FSI) (4 Weeks)\n*Air Rifle Marksmanship Instructor (ARMI) (4 Weeks)\n*Military Band (4 Weeks)\n*Pipes and Drums (P&D) (4 Weeks)\n*Leadership & Challenge\n*Outward Bound: Wales/Scotland\n*Canadian Forces Basic Parachutist Course\n*Maple Leaf Exchange\n*National Rifle Team (Bisley)\n*Other various exchanges under the ACE (Army Cadet Exchange) Program\nSummer Training Centres\nThere are 8 Army Cadet Summer Training Centres across Canada and they are:\n*Blackdown Cadet Training Centre\n*ACSTC Argonaut|Argonaut Army Cadet Summer Training Centre\n*Connaught National Army Cadet Summer Training Centre (Connaught NACTSC)\n*Mont St-Sacrement Cadet Summer Training Centre\n*Rocky Mountain National Army Cadet Summer Training Centre (RMNACSTC)\n*Valcartier Army Cadet Summer Training Centre\n*Vernon Army Cadet Summer Training Centre (VACSTC)\n*Whitehorse Cadet Summer Training Centre (WCSTC)\nRank structure\nThere is a basic similarity between the Army Cadet ranks and the Canadian Forces Army ranks.\nCadet,\nLance Corporal,\nCorporal,\nMaster Corporal,\nSergeant,\nWarrant Officer,\nMaster Warrant Officer,\nChief Warrant Officer.\nNote: The second rank of Lance Corporal, formerly \"Private\", was changed in January 2010, due to the French translation \"Soldat\" being the word \"soldier\".\nIf a Cadets Corps has an affiliation with a Unit of the CF that traditionally has a different word for the Rank of \"Private\", they are then entitled to make use of that alternative title.\nThus, Corps affiliated with the Royal Canadian Artillery would use \"Gunner\" (Also the term Bombardier & Master Bombardier could substitute for Corporal & Master Corporal)\n- Rifle Regiments - Rifleman\n- Highland (Scottish) Regiments - Highlander\n- Combat Engineer Regiments - Sapper\n- Armoured (Cavalry) Regiments - Trooper\n- Signals (Communications)Regiments - Signalman\n- Artillery Regiments - Gunner\nN.B.:  The above list may not be comprehensive, nor does it address French nomenclatures.\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160120210852/http://www.battlefordcadets.com/ Official site]\n*[http://www.armycadetleague.ca/ Army Cadet League of Canada]\n* [http://www.armycadethistory.com Royal Canadian Army Cadets History – Army Cadet League of Canada]"
