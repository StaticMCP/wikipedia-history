This was followed by Shahu breaking off negotiations with the Nizam-ul-Mulk about the restoration of the Chauth.\nBattle\nBaji Rao and the Maratha armies were called back from the south, from the Karnataka campaign. In May 1727, Baji Rao then asked Shahu to break off negotiations with Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I (Nizam-ul-Mulk had called for arbitration over the payment of the Chauth and sardeshmukhi) and started mobilizing an army. With the monsoons over and the land ready for this campaign, Baji Rao moved towards Aurangabad.\nAfter defeating Iwaz Khan, the General of Nizam-ul-Mulk, and plundering Jalna and Sindkhed, Baji Rao moved towards Burhanpur.\nWhen Baji Rao left North Khandesh and headed west to Gujarat, Nizam-ul-Mulk's army pursued him. The Nizam-ul-Mulk, however, threw up the chase and headed south towards Pune. It is known that the Nizam brought massive army and enough supplies to last the entire campaign with him. However, the Maratha armies were quite small and obtained supplies by pillaging and raiding outposts while travelling.\nSambhaji II's withdrawal\nIn Baramati, Nizam-ul-Mulk got news of Baji Rao moving towards Aurangabad. Nizam-ul-Mulk began moving northwards to intercept the Maratha Army. By this time he was confident of crushing Baji Rao and his army. However, the Raja of Kolhapur, Sambhaji II refused to join him in this campaign. The Nizam was cornered in a waterless tract near Palkhed on 25 February 1728. Through Iwaz Khan, the Nizam-ul-Mulk sent out a word of his plight, and his army was allowed to move to the vicinity of the river. The Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Nizam-ul-Mulk as the Subedar of the Deccan.\nAftermath\nThe Nizam of Hyderabad was defeated by the Marathas, and Peshwa Baji Rao I made him sign a peace treaty on 6 March 1728 at the village of Mungi-Paithan.\nBy the treaty of Munji Shivagaon, the Nizam agreed to make certain concessions to the Peshwa.\n# Chhatrapati Shahu was recognised as the sole Maratha ruler.\n# Marathas were given the right to collect Chauth and Sardeshmukhi of Deccan.\n# Those revenue collectors driven out would be reappointed.\n# The balance revenue was to be paid to Chhatrapati Shahu.\nMontgomery's conclusion\nBritish field marshal Bernard Montgomery studied Baji Rao's tactics in the Palkhed campaign, particularly his rapid movements and his troops' ability to live off the land (with little concern about supply and communication lines) while conducting \"maneuver warfare\" against the enemy. In his book, A Concise History of Warfare, Montgomery wrote the following about Baji Rao's victory at Palkhed:\nMontgomery further wrote,\n}}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Palsolkar, Col. R.
