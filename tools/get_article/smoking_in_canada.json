As of 2010, legislation banning smoking within each of these jurisdictions is mostly consistent, despite the separate development of legislation by each jurisdiction. Notable variations between the jurisdictions include: whether, and in what circumstances ventilated smoking rooms are permitted; whether, and up to what distance away from a building is smoking banned outside of a building; and, whether smoking is banned in private vehicles occupied by children.\nSome municipalities have laws restricting smoking further than the applicable national/provincial/territorial legislation. There have also been significant changes to public smoking regulations across the country following the legalization of recreational cannabis on October 17, 2018. This has resulted in additional regulations pertaining to the public consumption of cannabis in each province, with varying similarity to regulations concerning tobacco consumption.\nThe federal government's smoking ban in workplaces and on common carriers applies only to the federal government and to federally regulated businesses, such as airports. Smoking rooms are not permitted.\nAs of 2020, 12.9% of Canadians aged 15 and older smoke.\nHistory\nThe use of tobacco by the First Nations in Canada dates back centuries as a sacred plant with immense healing and spiritual benefits. They primarily consumed tobacco through pipes.\nnear Quebec City, Canada]]\nThe consumption of cigarettes in Canada began to rise in the early 20th century. According to Sharon Cook:  The pathfinders who first articulated women’s right to smoke were members of the middle and upper classes who were “untrammelled by conventional notions of decorum” for women, such as actresses, intellectuals, and “new women.” After all, these were the leaders of the 19th- and early 20th-century enfrachisement campaigns and other public-sphere campaigns which demanded the right to enter the professions, hold membership in artistic associations, and much else. It is not surprising that early examples of women pushing the boundaries of acceptable behaviours like smoking were women of privilege—intellectuals, artists, society women, and the like. The same process was at work in the masculine world of smoking with elitist elements arguing first for snuff, then cigars, pipes, and finally cigarettes.\nCook argues that the tobacco companies were looking for large profits which depended on sales to a much larger base of working women. They pitched their advertising to them, not to the elite. Thus, \"The combination of cheap prices, reliable and theatrical possibilities as a wardrobe prop, [short] duration of the smoking experience and workplace norms of peer associations...explain cigarettes’ growing popularity over cigars and pipes for working women after World War I.\"\nBy the 1950s, smoking had become increasingly popular, and the Canadian tobacco industry was thriving. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the industry deliberately downplayed the health risks associated with smoking. They sought to stall the smoking and health issue, leading to a lack of awareness among the general public. Before 1960, there were only limited restrictions. Smoking was allowed in most public spaces, including airplanes, classrooms, offices, and even the House of Commons. Tobacco advertising was prevalent, and there were no restrictions on sales or packaging.\nPrevalence\nIn December 2002, Statistics Canada published a report on smoking prevalence from 1985 to 2001. In that report they found from 1985 to 1991, the prevalence of \"current smoking\" (which they defined as daily smokers and occasional smokers) declined overall, for both sexes and all age groups except for those aged 15 to 24. Even larger declines occurred from 1991 to 2001. While current smoking prevalence for youths did not significantly change from 1985 to 1994–1995, there was a significant decrease of 6 percentage points from 1994–1995 to 2001 (from 28.5% to 22.5%). All of the provinces experienced some level of decline over the entire 1985 to 2001 period. Declines in daily smoking prevalence occurred for both sexes and all age groups over the entire 17-year time span, although youth smoking did not start significantly declining until the mid-1990s. Overall, for daily cigarette consumption, smokers by 2001 had a significantly lower proportion of smoking 26 or more cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (14.0% to 5.8%). Most of the declines in the different sex or age groups occurred after 1991. At the same time, however, smokers in 2001 had a significantly higher proportion of smoking 1 to 10 cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (18.6% to 31.1%). Most of the decline occurred after 1991. As of 2008 the rate was estimated to be 18%, and declining. A 2011 survey estimates that 17% of Canadians smoke.\nOverview by jurisdiction\nAlberta\nAlberta banned smoking in public spaces and workplaces, including within  of doors, windows, and outdoor air intakes, on 1 January 2008.[http://www.smokefreealberta.com/news__information.html Smoke Free Alberta | News & Information]  A tobacco display ban (or \"powerwall\") law requiring shop-owners to keep tobacco sales out of sight was implemented 1 July 2008.

No one under the age of 18 is permitted to buy tobacco or vaping products.\nOn June 23, 2021, Alberta's cabinet amended the regulations enabled by the province's [https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-240-2007/latest/alta-reg-240-2007.html#sec10.11subsec1/ Tobacco, Smoking and Vaping Reduction Act, 2005] to allow for ventilated smoking rooms for the smoking of cigars. Such rooms are permitted so long as they meet the following conditions: (a) the cigar lounge is designated as a cigar lounge by the manager;\n(b) the cigar lounge has floor-to-ceiling walls, a ceiling and doors that separate the lounge visually and physically from any adjacent area in which smoking is prohibited under the Act;\n(c) the cigar lounge has doors equipped with a properly functioning self‑closing device;\n(d) the cigar lounge is equipped with a separate ventilation system that maintains negative air pressure at all times and exhausts smoke directly to the outside of the building in which the lounge is located;\n(e) minors have no access to the cigar lounge;\n(f) no service, including cleaning, is allowed in the cigar lounge during the hours of operation.As of 2021, Alberta and Quebec are the only two provinces or territories which permit cigar lounges or any ventilated smoking rooms outside of nursing homes and long-term care facilities.

In April 2019, a proposal brought forward by Councillor Ana Bailão and seconded by Councillor Mike Layton, called for a response to the issue of cigarette butt litter in front of businesses including bars, restaurants, and other establishments. The motion requests a review of the issue of cigarette butt litter, with consideration by the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 about introducing new regulations. Ones that would require business owners and operators to ensure that such litter is removed from in front of their premises as a condition of the issuance of a business licence.\nIn Ontario, where more than one regulation, act or bylaw exists, the one that is the most restrictive of smoking prevails.\nAs of 2015, 11.3% of Ontario residents smoke.\nPrince Edward Island\nPrince Edward Island banned smoking in public spaces and workplaces in 2003.

In Montreal, all cigar bars opened before May 10, 2005, were allowed to stay in operation, though future establishments were banned. There are also cigar lounges in Gatineau.\nContrary to stereotypes and popular portrayal, Quebec's smoking rate is around the Canadian average, and is lower than the smoking rate of the U.S. and far lower than that of France. As of 2015, 14.2% of Quebec residents smoke.\nSaskatchewan\nSaskatchewan banned smoking in public places on January 1, 2005, and banned smoking in workplaces on May 31, 2009.

The Government of Canada legislated the mandatory display of warning messages on all cigarette packaging, including images depicting the long-term consequences of smoking, and has also banned tobacco advertising. A loophole which allowed the display of a sponsor's logo at cultural events (for example, the Symphony of Fire fireworks display, once known as the Benson & Hedges Symphony of Fire) was closed in the late 1990s. The Government of Ontario sponsors a program named Stupid, with an accompanying website stupid.ca, that seeks to educate adolescents about the danger of smoking.  The blue ribbon campaign was started in 1999 by the students at Hugh Boyd Secondary School in British Columbia and has gone national now.\nSee also\n* Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, the largest tobacco company\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Asbridge, Mark. \"Public place restrictions on smoking in Canada: assessing the role of the state, media, science and public health advocacy.\" Social science & medicine 58.1 (2004): 13–24.
