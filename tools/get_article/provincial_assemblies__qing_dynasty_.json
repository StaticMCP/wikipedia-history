In total, there were 21 Consultative Bureaus throughout the Qing Dynasty.\nFrom March 1909, each province began to elect members of the Consultative Bureau one after another. On October 14, with the exception of Xinjiang, all 21 provincial Consultative Bureaus were established and opened as scheduled, with more than 1,670 members elected.\nThe election of members of the Consultative Bureau is the first election of public opinion representatives in the history of China.\nSee also\n*Advisory Council (Qing dynasty)\nReferences"
