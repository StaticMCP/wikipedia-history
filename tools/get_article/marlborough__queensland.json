In the , the locality of Marlborough had a population of 154 people.\nGeography\nThe town lies on the Bruce Highway,  north west of the city of Rockhampton. The town is a small service centre for the surrounding area, and one of a number of fuelling points on an otherwise isolated stretch of highway.\nTo the south lies the Kunwarara Magnesite mine, which works one of the world's largest supplies of the mineral.\nMarlborough is famous for producing the world's finest chrysoprase, a semi-precious gem once coveted by Alexander the Great and Cleopatra. The small but high-grade deposit is located about  south-south-west of the township and is universally regarded as the most valuable find in the world.\nThe Bruce Highway passes through the locality, entering from the east (Kunwarara) and exiting to the north-west (Ogmore), bypassing the town approx  to the west. The North Coast railway line also passes through the locality, running roughly parallel to the east of the highway, but does pass through the town, which is served by Marlborough railway station  ().\nThe Marlborough–Sarina Road exits to the west.\nHistory\nMarlborough was established as a squatting pastoral run in 1857 by Dan Connor. The name is probably connected with the First Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722), a British army commander.\nThe post office at Marlborough opened on 1 January 1861. The first town allotments were sold in 1862. Marlborough was the location of a Native Police barracks from 1865 to 1876. The barracks were located at Barrack Creek on the northwest outskirts of the town.\nMarlborough Railway Provisional School opened on 26 July 1917. On 26 April 1919 it was renamed Koonama Provisional School. On 18 October 1920 it became Koonama State School. On 11 September 1925 it was renamed Marlborough State School.\nOn 24 July 2000, five people were killed when the Rockhampton-based Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service helicopter crashed in a paddock at Marlborough while attempting to land in thick fog. Following the tragedy, the community of Marlborough raised enough money to establish a permanent helipad in the town in an attempt to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future.\nMarlborough is within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone, but, between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Marlborough had a population of 149 people.\nIn the , the locality of Marlborough had a population of 154 people.\nEducation\nMarlborough State School is a government primary (Early Childhood-6) school for boys and girls at 79 Magog Road ().

The school competes against other schools in the area such as Clarke Creek State School, Milman State School  and School of Distance Education. They compete in swimming and athletic carnivals which Marlborough normally hosts, having a 16-metre pool and a grassy oval.\nThere are no secondary schools in Marlborough. The nearest government secondary school is Glenmore State High School in Kawana, Rockhampton, over  away. Distance education and boarding schools would be the alternatives.\nAmenities\nLivingstone Shire Council operates a weekly library service at Marlborough.

It is part of the Parish of North Rockhampton (also known as the All Saints Anglican Community) within the Anglican Church of Central Queensland.\nAttractions\nMarlborough Historical Museum is at 15 Milman Street ().
