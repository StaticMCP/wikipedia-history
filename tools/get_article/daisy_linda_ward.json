Theodore Ward had a professional interest in painting as a director of his family firm, Holzapfel (subsequently known as International Paint), manufacturers of marine, domestic and industrial paints and coatings based in Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, and Felling.\nThe couple collected Dutch and Flemish 17th-century paintings. She became a still life painter and took her inspiration from works in her collection and elsewhere. She showed her work at the Royal Academy summer exhibition for the first time in 1925. Two of her paintings were included in the Ashmolean bequest that comprises 96 paintings.\nFile:Daisy Linda Ward - Still LIfe with a Lemon and a Porcelain Pitcher ASH ASHM WA1940 2 95.jpg|Partial copy by Daisy Linda Ward of a work by Willem Kalf\nFile:Willem-kalf-stilleben-mit-porzellankanne.jpg|Original work, formerly in the collection of Josef Block, looted in WWII and recently restituted to his heir\nReferences\n* The Collection of Dutch and Flemish Still-Life Paintings Bequeathed by Daisy Linda Ward ...
