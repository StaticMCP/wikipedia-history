The population was 556 at the 2020 census.\nHistory\nIn 1834, Sidney Smith hired R.M. Shoemaker of Cincinnati to survey a new town at the corners of sections 15, 16, 21, and 22 in Scipio Township.  He called it \"Republic,\" though it was known by many early settlers simply as \"Scipio Center.\"\nWith the arrival of a rail line from Sandusky in 1841, Republic became a popular trading center.  Stores, warehouses, shops, and factories sprang up almost overnight.  A second rail line was contemplated to run between Republic and Melmore in Eden Township.\nWhen the old Seneca County courthouse at Tiffin burned on May 21, 1841, efforts were made to designate Republic as the county seat, but these were unsuccessful. Republic's fortunes began to decline when the new Cincinnati, Sandusky & Cleveland Railroad bypassed it to make a straight run to Tiffin.\nThe town was stimulated by the construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The railroad passes via an arch bridge over what is now State Route 19.  On January 4, 1887, just west of town on the railroad was the site of an accident designated the \"Republic Horror\" when the westbound B & O Express No. 5 collided head on with a stalled eastbound freight train.\nRepublic's motto is \"Small in Size, Big in Heart.\" Written by Seneca East student Michelle Wheatley, it was selected in a contest of popular submissions.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 549 people, 220 households, and 151 families living in the village.
