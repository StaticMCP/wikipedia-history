He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford.\nPolitical career\nBrabourne was returned to Parliament for Rochester in at a by-election April 1889, having unsuccessfully contested the Isle of Thanet at a by-election in June 1888. The Rochester by-election was caused by the resignation of the Conservative Francis Hughes-Hallett after a scandal. He held the Rochester seat until he stood down at the 1892 general election. In 1893 he succeeded his father in the barony and entered the House of Lords. Brabourne was also a lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards and served as deputy lieutenant and justice of the peace for Kent.\nFamily\nLord Brabourne married Amy Virginia, daughter of Wentworth Beaumont, 1st Baron Allendale, in 1880. They had two sons (of whom the eldest died young) and two daughters. Brabourne died in London in December 1909, aged 52, and was succeeded in the barony by his only surviving son, Wyndham. Lady Brabourne remained a widow until her death in May 1949.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
