Its origins are not documented, but it is thought to derive from crossbreeding of Ayrshire, Devon, and Dairy Shorthorn. The name Illawarra was abbreviated from the earlier Australian Illawarra Shorthorn, and named after Illawarra, New South Wales.\nConformation\nIllawarras are horned, large-framed cattle of a predominantly red colour, with some whites or roans (mix of red and white) .\nProduction\nIllawarras produce large quantities of high butterfat and protein milk. In an official test in 1998, Illawarra cows averaged 4,829 litres of milk, with slightly over 4% butterfat and 3.4% protein, under Australia's pasture production system.\nAccording to the 2010 Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Report, the average production of an Illawarra cow is 6733 litres with a butterfat content of 3.95% and a protein level of 3.29%.\nTemperament\nIllawarras are very docile cows that are noted for their longevity. They make good handling cattle for shows and are easy to work with in the dairy.\nAdaptability\nIllawarras can stand weather exceeding 40°C and below freezing. They make the most out of feed and do not need much supplementary feeding. This adaptability under a variety conditions has contributed to the growth of the breed.\nExports\nIllawarra cattle, embryos, and semen have been exported to Central America, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Canada, the Middle East, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nSee also\n*Milking Shorthorn\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090404105539/http://www.lbcentre.com.au/Illawarra_Cattle_Society_Australia.php Illawarra Cattle Society Australia]\n* [http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/illawarra Illawarra]"
