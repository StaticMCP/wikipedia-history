General Rafael Urdaneta was appointed interim president the following day whilst a response from Bolívar on whether he would return to the Presidency was awaited. However, he refused to accept the post, and gave his support to Urdaneta. Bolívar died in December.\nFollowing a brief civil war in early 1831, Urdaneta left office and elections were held for a Constituent Assembly. Presidential elections were held the following year.\nReferences"
