It was later adopted by Jacobites. According to the historian Dr. Bernard Capp, this song was perhaps the most popular song in mid-seventeenth century England. The eighteenth century critic Joseph Ritson called it \"the most famous and popular air ever heard in this country\".\nJacobite usage\nOne of the Irish Jacobite regiments formed in the 1690s from veterans of James II of England's Irish campaign, the Régiment Rooth (nicknamed 'the Pretender's body-guard'), marched to ‘When the king enjoys his own again’. Upon Queen Mary II's death in 1694, Bristol Jacobites publicly rejoiced with bell-ringings and danced through the streets to the song. In September 1711 a commander of a company of London militia, Captain John Silk, had his trained bands march to the song through the City. In 1713 the Tory clergyman Henry Sacheverell preached to the Sons of the Clergy and afterwards attended a gathering with (amongst others) Dr. Bisse (the Bishop of Hereford) and Francis Atterbury (the Bishop of Rochester). The song was played by the musicians and met with such a favourable reception that it was repeated and when the musicians tried to play a different song they were met with great hissing.\nAfter the accession of the first Hanoverian king, George I, there was a resurgence of Jacobitism in the form of celebrating Charles II's Restoration Day (29 May). On that day in 1715 Bristol Jacobites were heard humming the tune. At Oxford on Restoration Day in 1716 local Jacobite gownsmen disrupted attempted Whig celebrations of it by playing the tune. According to the historian Daniel Szechi, this was the most popular Jacobite song of the period.\nIn February 1716 two Exeter College, Oxford undergraduates were beaten by officers for playing the song.\nIn 1722 in St Albans the future MP for the town, Thomas Gape, had musicians play the song during an election riot.\nIn December 1746 the Jacobite officer Thomas Chadwick played the tune on the church organs at Derby and Lancaster, to the entertainment of Jacobite officers.\nOn 23 February 1748, the birthday of the Pretender's youngest son, two Oxford University undergraduates (James Dawes of St Mary Hall and John Whitmore of Balliol College) openly declared for the Pretender, for which they were charged with uttering treason and given bail. However, in October the pair toured Oxford's colleges with two musicians who played ‘When the king enjoys his own again’ and they were subsequently expelled, fined and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.\nLyrics\n{|\n|-\n|\nLet rogues and cheats prognosticate\nConcerning king's or kingdom's fate\nI think myself to be as wise\nAs he that gazeth on the skies\n: My sight goes beyond\n: The depth of a pond\nOr rivers in the greatest rain\nWhereby I can tell\nThat all will be well\nWhen the King enjoys his own again\n: Yes, this I can tell\n: That all will be well\nWhen the King enjoys his own again\nThere's neither Swallow, Dove, or Dade\nCan soar more high or deeper wade\nNor show a reason from the stars\nWhat causeth peace or civil wars\n: The man in the moon\n: May wear out his shoon\nBy running after Charles his wain\nBut all's to no end,\nFor the times will not mend\nTill the King enjoys his own again\n: Yes, this I can tell\n: That all will be well\nWhen the King enjoys his own again\nFull forty years this royal crown\nHath been his father's and his own\nAnd is there anyone but he\nThat in the same should sharer be?\n: For who better may\n: The sceptre sway\nThan he that hath such right to reign?\nThen let's hope for a peace,\nFor the wars will not cease\nTill the king enjoys his own again\n: Yes, this I can tell\n: That all will be well\nWhen the King enjoys his own again\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n|\nThough for a time we see Whitehall\nWith cobwebs hanging on the wall\nInstead of gold and silver brave\nWhich formerly he was wont to have\n: With rich perfume\n: In every room,\nDelightful to that princely train\nYet the old again shall be\nWhen the time you see\nThat the King enjoys his own again\n: Yes, this I can tell\n: That all will be well\nWhen the King enjoys his own again\nThen fears avaunt, upon the hill\nMy hope shall cast her anchor still\nUntil I see some peaceful dove\nBring home the branch I dearly love\n: Then will I wait\n: Till the waters abate\nWhich now disturb my troubled brain\nThen for ever rejoice,\nWhen I've heard the voice\nThat the King enjoys his own again\n: Yes, this I can tell\n: That all will be well\nWhen the King enjoys his own again\n|}\nAlternative lyrics\nWhat Booker doth prognosticate\nConcerning kings' or kingdoms' fate?\nI think myself to be as wise\nAs he that gazeth on the skies;\nMy skill goes beyond the depth of a pond,\nOr rivers in the greatest rain,\nThereby I can tell all things will be well\nWhen the King enjoys his own again.\n2. There's neither swallow, dove, nor dade,\nCan soar more high, or deeper wade,\nNor show a reason from the stars\nWhat causeth peace or civil wars;\nThe Man in the Moon may wear out his shoon\nBy running after Charles his wain:\nBut all's to no end, for the times will not mend\nTill the King enjoys his own again.\n3. Though for a time we see Whitehall\nWith cobwebs hanging on the wall\nInstead of silk and silver brave,\nWhich formerly it used to have,\nWith rich perfume in every room,\nDelightful to that princely train,\nWhich again you shall see, when the time it shall be,\nThat the King enjoys his own again.\n4. Full forty years the royal crown\nHath been his father's and his own;\nAnd is there any one but he\nThat in the same should sharer be?\nFor who better may the sceptre sway\nThan he that hath such right to reign?\nThen let's hope for a peace, for the wars will not cease\nTill the King enjoys his own again.\n5. Did Walker no predictions lack\nIn Hammond's bloody almanack?\nForetelling things that would ensue,\nThat all proves right, if lies be true;\nBut why should not he the pillory foresee,\nWherein poor Toby once was ta'en?\nAnd also foreknow to the gallows he must go\nWhen the King enjoys his own again?\n6. Till then upon Ararat's hill\nMy hope shall cast her anchor still,\nUntil I see some peaceful dove\nBring home the branch I dearly love;\nThen will I wait till the waters abate\nWhich now disturb my troubled brain,\nElse never rejoice till I hear the voice\nThat the King enjoys his own again.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*William Wagstaffe, The Ballad of The king shall enjoy his own again: with a learned comment thereupon, at the request of Capt.
