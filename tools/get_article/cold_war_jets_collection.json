Demonstrations of fast taxi runs were carried out on the two open days held each year, usually May Bank Holiday Sunday and August Bank Holiday Sunday. Individual Groups also held events of their aircraft, these included fast taxi runs, static engine runs, photoshoots etc.\nIt was reported in June 2020 that the museum had closed.\nHowever the collection reopened at a new location on the edge of Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome during September 2023, based around the QRA hangars, on an invitation only basis.\nCollection\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
