King made his senior début for Norwich City on 23 September 2014 in the League Cup in a 1–0 away loss to Shrewsbury Town.\nIn 2016 King and Norwich mutually agreed to end his contract early, in order for him to receive medical care for persistent migraines.

King joined League of Ireland Premier Division side Shamrock Rovers on 14 August 2017.\nOn 24 August 2020, King re-signed for National League side Kings Lynn.
