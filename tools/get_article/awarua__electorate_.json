In the six years since, New Zealand's European population had increased by 65%. In the 1881 electoral redistribution, the House of Representatives increased the number of European representatives to 91 (up from 84 since the 1875–76 election). The number of Māori electorates was held at four. The House further decided that electorates should not have more than one representative, which led to 22 new electorates being formed, including Awarua, and two electorates that had previously been abolished to be recreated. This necessitated a major disruption to existing boundaries.\nThis electorate was in the rural part of Southland. In its original form, it covered the area around the town of Invercargill, which had its own electorate. Bluff fell into Awarua, and all of Stewart Island / Rakiura. On the mainland, Awarua had taken area from  (which was abolished) and from  (which moved to the east and north). Stewart Island had previously belonged to .\nHistory\nThe electorate was established in 1881. It was represented by the Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward from 1887 to 1919. Philip De La Perrelle announced his retirement due to ill health in August 1935. He died within days of the  and was succeeded by James Hargest.\nIn the 1996 election, the first MMP election, the electorate was absorbed into the adjacent Invercargill electorate.\nMembers of Parliament\nKey\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n!width=175 colspan=2| Winner\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2 width=5 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=2 |James Joyce\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=11 | Joseph Ward\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=10 bgcolor=|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|John Hamilton\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Philip De La Perrelle\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|John Hamilton\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=2|Philip De La Perrelle\n|-\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=2 |\n| height=8\n| rowspan=4 | James Hargest1\n|-\n| rowspan=3\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=5 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=5| George Herron\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=4 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=4 |Gordon Grieve\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Hugh Templeton\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Aubrey Begg\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=4 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=4 |Rex Austin\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=2 |Jeff Grant\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Eric Roy\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center|(Electorate abolished in 1996; see )\n|}\n1James Hargest was originally an Independent supporter of the Reform Party.
