It also has a grants scheme.\nInitiatives\nIrish Walled Towns Network\nIn 2005, the Heritage Council formed the Irish Walled Towns Network (IWTN). The role of the IWTN is to help the walled towns of Ireland become better places in which to live, work and visit. The network does this through providing grants for medieval town wall repairs, secondly, by providing grants for community festivals and heritage interpretation, thirdly, training community groups on how best to use their place's heritage and finally, by coordinating research and publishing advisory documents. In 2013, the IWTN's education programme won the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Award.\nMuseum Standards Programme for Ireland\nThe Heritage Council established the Museums Standards Programme for Ireland (MSPI) in 2007, to benchmark and promote professional standards in the care of collections and to recognise through accreditation the achievement of those standards within the Irish museum sector. As of 2020, 43 museums have been fully accredited through the MSPI programme.\nSee also\n* An Taisce\n* National Trust, in Northern Ireland\n* The Discovery Programme\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.heritagecouncil.ie/ The Heritage Council website]"
