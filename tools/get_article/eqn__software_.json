A similar program, neqn, accepted the same input as eqn, but produced output tuned to look better in nroff. The eqn program was created in 1974 by Brian Kernighan and Lorinda Cherry.\nIt was implemented using the yacc compiler-compiler.\nThe input language used by eqn allows the user to write mathematical expressions in much the same way as they would be spoken aloud.  The language is defined by a context-free grammar, together with operator precedence and operator associativity rules.  The eqn language is similar to the mathematical component of TeX, which appeared several years later, but is simpler and less complete.\nAn independent compatible implementation of the eqn preprocessor has been developed by GNU as part of groff, the GNU version of troff.  The GNU implementation extends the original language by adding a number of new keywords such as smallover and accent. mandoc, a specialised compiler for UNIX man pages, also contains a standalone eqn parser/formatter.\nHistory\nEqn was written using the yacc parser generator.\nSyntax examples\nHere is how some examples would be written in eqn (with equivalents in TeX for comparison):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!TeX\n!eqn\n!formula\n|-\n|\n|a sup 2\n|a^2\n|-\n|{{code|lang=latex|1=\\sum_{k = 1}^N k^2}}\n|sum from { k = 1 } to N { k sup 2 }\n|\\sum_{k=1}^N k^2\n|-\n|x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\over 2a}\n|x = {-b +- sqrt{b sup 2 - 4ac}} over 2a\n|x= {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\over 2a}\n|}\nSpaces are important in eqn; tokens are delimited only by whitespace characters, tildes ~, braces {} and double-quotes \"\". Thus f(pi&nbsp;r&nbsp;sup&nbsp;2) results in f(pi r^{2)}, whereas f(&nbsp;pi&nbsp;r&nbsp;sup&nbsp;2&nbsp;) is needed to give the intended f(\\pi r^2).\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kohala.com/start/troff/v7man/eqn/eqn2e.ps Typesetting Mathematics, User's Guide (Second Edition)]\n*\n*\n*"
