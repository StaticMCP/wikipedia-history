Volz\n\nEdward John Volz (August 22, 1879 &ndash; fl.1964) was an American labor union leader.\nBorn in Cincinnati, Volz joined the International Photo-Engravers Union of North America.  He moved to New York City, and in 1916 was elected as president of the New York Photo-Engravers Union, and also first vice-president of the international union.  In 1929, he won election as president of the union, serving until 1954.  As leader of the union, he backed the American Federation of Labor and strongly criticized the Congress of Industrial Organizations split.\nIn 1964, the Photo-Engravers merged into the new Lithographers and Photoengravers International Union.  At its founding conference, Volz gave a short speech in support of the merger, reviewing previous unsuccessful attempts to bring the unions together.\nReferences"
