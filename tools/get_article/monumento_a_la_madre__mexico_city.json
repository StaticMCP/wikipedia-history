In 1944, President Manuel Ávila Camacho laid the first stone of what would be the Monument to the Mother. The monument was inaugurated by President Miguel Alemán Valdés on May 10, 1949.\nThe architectural component was completed by José Villagrán García, while the sculptures were designed by Luis Ortiz Monasterio, who won a contest held by Excélsior'' in 1948. The monument is located in the Jardín del Arte Sullivan, between the streets of Sullivan, Villalongín, and Avenida de los Insurgentes, dividing the Cuauhtémoc and San Rafael colonias (in the Cuauhtémoc borough). It features three sculptures: an indigenous man seen writing, an indigenous woman with an ear of corn (a symbol of fertility), and a mother with a child in her arms.\nOn September 19, 2017, the monument's central sculpture collapsed due to a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that shook Mexico City. On November 21, 2018, the government of Mexico City reopened the monument. The project was carried out by the architect Gabriel Mérigo.\nSee also\n*Monumento a la Madre, Guadalajara\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
