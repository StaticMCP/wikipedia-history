It has two parts. One part is a bamboo pole attached to a coconut shell. The other part is the . It acts as a bow used to give friction on the string. A  sings songs while playing the musical instrument. Pena is an inseparable part of Meitei civilization. It is used in ritualistic functions like Lai Haraoba, Lai Ikouba, etc.\nApplique art\nIn Meitei culture, through the art of applique, decorative effects are achieved by superposing patches of coloured fabrics on a basic fabric, with the stitching of the edges of the patches. This unique art from is distinctively different from the modern day patchwork, in which small pieces of cut clothes are connected side by side, so as to make a bigger form of cloth, or for renovating a ragged cloth. In fact, it is the application of smaller ornaments or devices into bigger articles. It can be particularly seen in costumes of Meitei classical dance forms such as Khamba Thoibi classical dance, , etc.\nPerforming arts\nThok Leela\nThok Leela is a traditional Meitei satire, wit and comedy theatre of Manipur. It mocks the social conditions, the royal courtiers and the rulers. The talented actors with their repartee produce mocking, humorous, ironical, exaggerated, comic and rollicking effects. It has no written theatrical texts. It depends on the self generated exercise of the artist's skills, humour and intellect, focusing on the theme for the storyline. The Meitei language word \"thok\" means 'at random'. Thus, \"Thok Leela\" means a randomly performed satirical comedy play, with no written scripts and no directors. The only support of the actors is the advice of the elders and the teachers. It is a union of \"the critical and the humourist\". It produces a big humorous temperament. Its common character includes pastiche. It aims whatever is ridiculous or unseemly.\nSocial practices, rituals and festive events\nSankirtan\nMeitei Sankirtana (alias Manipuri Sankirtana) is the artistic manifestation of the worshipping culture of the Meitei people (Manipuri people). It is regarded as the visible form of God, in Meitei culture.\nRegarding the art form, the Ministry of Culture (India) states the following:\nMinistry of Culture, Government of India |url=https://indiaculture.gov.in/national-list-intangible-cultural-heritage-ich |access-date=2023-12-23 |website=indiaculture.gov.in |publisher=Ministry of Culture, Government of India}}}}\nDeath rites of Phayeng\nThe Chapka Phayeng people of Manipur are a part of the Meitei people itself. But they have a unique culture of burying the death. Shikaplon is a tradition of “requiem and a funeral march”, along with . According to their beliefs, in the afterlife, people go to the  to unite with their ancestors. Among the mourning people during the time of burial, one of them should sing the Shikaplon, which gives instructions to the journey of the dead person to the underworld. The pena (musical instrument) should be played by the singer while singing the Shikaplon.\nAnother funeral tradition is the accompanying of a very rare martial art form known as Yenpha Khousa. Yenpha Khousa is a form of Ta Khousaba. It is performed by young, close relative of the departed. It is performed with spear and shield.\nNational Inventory of ICH\nThe National Inventory of the intangible cultural heritage of India includes some Meitei intangible cultural heritage too, which are Lai Haraoba, folklore of Moirang, Meitei Sankirtana, Shikalpan and Khousaba (ritual ceremony of the dead people of Phayeng caste), and the making of Pena (musical instrument).\nSee also\n* Animals in Meitei civilization\n* Birds in Meitei civilization\n* Constitutionalism in Meitei civilization\n* Hills and mountains in Meitei civilization\n* Plants in Meitei civilization\n* Women in Meitei civilization\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links"
