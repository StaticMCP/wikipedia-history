Produced by co-songwriters Scott Storch and Avedon, it is Redd's second highest-charting song to date.\nBackground\nTrippie Redd first teased the song in December 2017, but the snippet was removed and re-uploaded in early March 2018. On April 4, 2018, he posted a second snippet on his Instagram story, which showed him in a studio with rapper Nebu Kiniza. Although this raised speculation of a guest appearance in the song, the collaboration did not happen.\nThe song was released on August 6, 2018. That same day, Redd also revealed the tracklist for his album ''Life's A Trip'', which was released four days later.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 4\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 3\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
