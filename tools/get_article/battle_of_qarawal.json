The battle resulted in a victory for the Afghan forces and forced the Sikhs to withdraw to Amritsar.\nBackground\nFollowing Ahmad Shah's sixth campaign and his withdrawal, the Sikhs took advantage of his absence by expanding Sikh influence over the Punjab. The Sikhs defeated the Afghans at Kasur and much of the Jalandhar Doaba was overrun by the Sikhs. And early in January 1764, Sirhind also fell to Sikh control.\nHearing news of this, Ahmad Shah was enraged and began mobilizing for another invasion of India. Ahmad Shah mobilized 18,000 men and also called upon Nasir Khan of Kalat. Ahmad Shah and Nasir Khan marched their forces across the Punjab, with Nasir Khan crossing the Ravi river. The two forces united at Eminabad. The following day, Ahmad Shah marched to the Ravi river again, before marching on Lahore. Ahmad Shah then held a Durbar in the fort of Lahore.\nThe next morning, news arrived that the Sikhs had attacked Qarawal, with two of the sardars there, Gahram Khan and Ahmad Khan requesting immediate support. Ahmad Khan and his son were killed in the battle.\nBattle\nFollowing this, Afghan reinforcements to the battle arrived under Nasir Khan, and fighting began. Nasir Khan himself came forward in the battle and begin skirmishing. Charat Singh then advanced to oppose him. However, Nasir Khan charged upon him, to which, Charat Singh fled to the safety of his troops. During this, a Sikh gunner shot Nasir Khan's horse, killing it. Despite this, Nasir Khan returned to his troops unharmed, and his men chanted \"Bismillah\" for his safe return. Two of Nasir's servants, Muhammad Husain and Mir Mangah killed the Sikh gunner.\nAs the rest of the Durrani reinforcements came into battle, the Sikhs were routed from the battlefield, and fled from the battle at night.\nAftermath\nFollowing this victory, Ahmad Shah advised Nasir Khan to not fight again in the front ranks of battle. After his battle with Charat Singh, Ahmad Shah received news that the Sikhs had retreated to the city of Amritsar. Ahmad Shah and the Afghan forces entered Amritsar on December 1, 1764. It was at Amritsar that he would get into a skirmish with Baba Gurbaksh Singh along with 29 other Sikh defenders at Shri Harmandir Sahib.It was in this skirmish that all 30 Sikh defenders were killed and the Shri Harmandir Sahib was destroyed under the orders of Ahmad Shah.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
