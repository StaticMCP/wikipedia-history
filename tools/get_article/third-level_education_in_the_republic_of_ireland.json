Quality and Qualifications Ireland, a State agency, can grant awards in other institutions directly, or delegate the authority to do so. The King's Inns of Dublin has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of barrister-at-law to practice as barristers. Medical schools in Ireland also have particular regulation. There were seven establishments of higher education within Ireland ranked among the top 500 universities worldwide by the Times Higher Education Supplement in 2023.\nFramework\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Some colleges are constituent colleges of universities, while others are designated institutions of the State agency Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), which succeeded the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. The latter include the remaining Institutes of technology in Ireland in Dundalk and Dún Laoghaire, Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have \"delegated authority\" from QQI, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.\nSome institutions such as the University of Limerick, Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin), and Dublin City University (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the ECTS. The Bologna process and applied research are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the National University of Ireland. In 2019 TU Dublin amalgamated three institutions in the Dublin region (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and Institute of Technology, Tallaght), and in 2021 Munster Technological University amalgamated two institutions in the Munster region (Cork Institute of Technology, and Institute of Technology, Tralee), while the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest was formed by the merger of Limerick Institute of Technology and Athlone Institute of Technology. The Atlantic Technological University, through the merger of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology and South East Technological University with the merger of Institute of Technology, Carlow and Waterford Institute of Technology in 2022.\nThe Marks & Standards document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for school leavers; the so-called \"Points Race\" administered by the Central Applications Office (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, while as of 2005 it was in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.\nThere are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge is the Irish language Department of the University of Galway and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. University College Dublin (UCD), TU Dublin, and Atlantic Technological University (ATU) also offer similar courses.\nAll but two of the eleven universities in Ireland offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) Bachelor of Arts degrees through the CAO where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer \"open\" (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as Drama Studies, Journalism, Latin, History, Japanese, and International Relations.\nIn one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy – which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by St. Patrick's College of Education (a college of DCU) and is titled \"BA in Humanities\". All Hallows College (a college of DCU) offer BA in humanities, theology pastoral care, and English.\nEntry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.\nEntry into third-level is generally very high in Ireland (as it also is in Northern Ireland), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees—the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%. Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education.\nIreland as a study abroad destination for international students\nIn recent years, Ireland has become a top study destination for higher education, attracting students not only from within the European Union, but from international destinations such as India, South East Asia and Africa.\nWith the outcome of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom in 2016, [https://www.educationtimes.com/article/study-abroad-europe/99733084/brexit-has-added-to-irelands-popularity-as-a-study-destination Ireland has grown substantially in popularity for international students] wanting to study higher education level degrees there. Mostly due to its high concentration of multinational companies and booming economy.\nUndergraduate fees\nUnder the \"Free Fees Initiative\" the Government pays the tuition fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative. These requirements include:\n* Holding EU nationality, or are a national of member country of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, or those who have been granted official refugee status.\n* Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course.\n* Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course.\nStudents are required to pay a \"registration fee\" on entry to their courses. These charges cover costs such as equipment usage, administration fees and exam fees. Charges were €1,500 per student for the 2009/10 school year. These charges have been labelled as \"unofficial fees\", and some university heads admitted that \"student registration charges are fees by any other name\".\nIn 2011, after large annual increases, the registration fee was abolished and replaced with a \"student contribution\" that stood at €3,000. For the school year 2023/2024 students had to pay that amount plus the \"student levy\" of €150.\nPostgraduate fees\nThe \"Free Fees Initiative\" only covers Bachelor's degrees, so postgraduate students pay fees regardless of their nationality. However, the amount does change depending on the country of origin, with EU fees being typically lower than those for non-EU.\nFurther education\nFurther education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education. Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included are craft and trade apprenticeships, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism. These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition. There are many different types of further education awards, known as Post Leaving Certificates.\nThe Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) conferred awards in the extra-university system. Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions, and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalised to restore confidence. There are a number of schemes enabling progression for holders of QQI awards to universities and institutes of technology. QQI awards carry points that can be used to access higher education.\nGrade inflation\nIreland has a higher proportion of third-level graduates than any other EU country. At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels. There is disagreement about whether this increase is due to improved methods of instructing increasingly motivated students, or simple grade inflation. President Michael D. Higgins believes that it is due to grade inflation, and has expressed concern about the continued quality and value of university degrees. Whatever the reason might be, employers increasingly examine graduates' extracurricular activities, work experiences, and soft skills as they search for the most able applicants.\nList of higher education establishments\nThese are lists of colleges and universities within Ireland; some colleges are constituent colleges of universities.\nUniversities\nRecognised as Universities under the Universities Act, 1997 as amended:\n*Dublin City University\n*National University of Ireland\n**Maynooth University\n**University of Galway\n**University College Cork\n**University College Dublin\n*Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\n*University of Limerick\n*University of Dublin\n**Trinity College\nTechnological Universities\nTechnological Universities have been formed by the merger of former Institutes of Technology.\n*Atlantic Technological University\n*Munster Technological University\n*South East Technological University\n*Technological University Dublin\n*Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest\nInstitutes of technology\n*Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology\n*Dundalk Institute of Technology\nPontifical University\n*St Patrick's College, Maynooth (also known as Maynooth College or the Pontifical University at Maynooth)\nColleges of education\n*St Angela's College of Education, Sligo\n*Marino Institute of Education\n*Mary Immaculate College, Limerick\n*St. Patrick's College, Thurles\nRecognised, associated or constituent colleges of Irish universities\n*Institute of Public Administration\n*Irish School of Ecumenics\n*National College of Art and Design\n*National Maritime College of Ireland\n*Shannon College of Hotel Management\nNational institutions\n*Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies\n*Garda Síochána College\n*Military College, Curragh Camp\n*National Ambulance Service College\nState-aided and chartered institutions\n*Honorable Society of King's Inns\n*National College of Ireland (formerly National College of Industrial Relations)\n*Royal Irish Academy of Music\n*Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (postgraduate medical qualifications)\nOther institutions\n*American College Dublin\n*Burren College of Art\n*Carmelite Institute of Britain and Ireland, theology programmes validated by St Patrick's College, Maynooth\n*Cavan Institute\n*Christian Leadership in Education Office (CLEO), postgraduate education programmes validated by the University of Hull\n*Church of Ireland Theological Institute (partly in cooperation with Trinity College Dublin)\n*City Colleges\n*Coláiste na hÉireann\n*Coláiste Stiofáin Naofa\n*College of Progressive Education\n*Cork College of Commerce\n*Digital Skills Academy (historically validated by Dublin Institute of Technology and Boston College)\n*Dorset College\n*Dublin Business School\n*Dublin Institute of Design (Closed 2023)\n*Gaiety School of Acting\n*Galway Business School\n*Global Center for Advanced Studies (GCAS College Dublin)\n*The Grafton Academy of Fashion Design\n*Griffith College Cork\n*Griffith College Dublin\n*Griffith College Limerick\n*Hibernia College\n*IBAT College Dublin\n*ICD Business School\n*Independent College Dublin\n*Irish Bible Institute (a component of the University of Wales (2005–2013), York St John University since 2014.)\n*Irish Management Institute\n*Kimmage Development Studies Centre (merged into Maynooth University)\n*Mallow College of Further Education\n*Newman College Ireland\n*Pitman Training Ireland\n*Portobello Institute\n*The Priory Institute (validated by Institute of Technology, Tallaght)\n*Spirituality Institute for Research and Education (Masters validated by Waterford Institute of Technology)\n*St. John's Central College, Cork\n*St. Nicholas Montessori College\n*St. Patrick's, Carlow College\n*Setanta College\nForeign institutions with a presence in Ireland\nAs well as \"Study Abroad\" programmes from US universities, a UK institution, a French business school and a number of US universities have presences in Ireland:\n*Boston College Ireland – delivers \"Study Abroad\" and summer programmes on St. Stephens Green, central Dublin\n*Champlain College Ireland – delivers \"Study Abroad\" programmes to US students at a campus on Leeson Street, central Dublin\n*Duquesne University – students study in UCD and stay at Duquesne University's St. Michael's House facility\n*École de management de Normandie – A Dublin campus opened in 2017\n*Georgia Southern University – Opened in 2019, Georgia Southern University has a campus in Wexford Town\n*University of Notre Dame – have two centres in Ireland, the new Notre Dame Center at Kylemore Abbey in Connemara and O'Connell House in Dublin from which students study at Trinity or UCD\n*Open University – the UK based Open University has an Irish office in Dublin\n*Sacred Heart University – has an Irish studies base in Dingle, County Kerry\nForeign institutions who validate programmes in Ireland\nHistorically a number of institutions, including seminaries such as St. Patrick's, Carlow College, St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny, St. Patrick's College, Thurles, and Tullabeg College, would have prepared students for examinations with the University of London.
