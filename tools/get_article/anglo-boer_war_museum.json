The museum has a unique art collection, dioramas and exhibits but also brings the visitor closer to understanding the background against which the war took place. The National Women's Monument dedicated to all women and children is situated at the same location and was unveiled in 1913.\nHistory of the museum\nIt was the National Women’s Memorial Committee which came up with the idea that a museum, solely dedicated to the preservation of the Anglo-Boer War history and objects be established. Frans Soff was the architect commissioned to design the building and on 26 April 1930 the cornerstone of the War Museum was laid by Senator W.J.C. Brebner with Reverend Professor Dr. J.D Kestell, a Boer chaplain during the Boer War and the person whom the town of Kestell is named after, opened the ceremony with a prayer.\nOn 30 September 1931 the museum was opened by the first  prime minister of the Union of South Africa, General J. B. M. Hertzog.\nSee also\n*National Women's Monument\n*Anglo-Boer War Memorial\nReferences"
