Former member Camila Cabello was part of the group until December 2016.\nThe group signed a joint recording contract with Simon Cowell's label Syco Records and Epic Records after finishing third in the second season of the American televised singing competition, The X Factor in 2012. After recording a series of covers posted on the video sharing platform, YouTube, the group announced their first extended play, Better Together, spawning the MTV Video Music Award for Artist to Watch winning song, \"Miss Movin' On\", becoming the first all-female group to win an award in this network since The Pussycat Dolls in 2008.\nReflection, the group's debut studio album, was released in 2015. It spawned three singles—\"Boss\", \"Sledgehammer\" and \"Worth It\", all of which were successful. The third single \"Worth It\" won their nomination for Song of Summer at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. The group's second studio album, 7/27 was released in 2016. The lead single, \"Work from Home\" became the group's first top 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. The song helped Fifth Harmony earn many awards, among them the collaboration category for the American Music Awards. Two of the album's singles, the lead and \"All in My Head (Flex)\" received an MTV Video Music Award in separate categories.\nThe group has been included on Billboards annual \"21 under 21 list\" since 2013, climbing gradually and eventually topping it in 2016. Fifth Harmony also had three Guinness World Records; two in 2017 and one in 2018.\nAmerican Music Awards\nThe American Music Awards (AMAs) is an annual music awards show created by Dick Clark in 1973.\n!\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2016\n| \"Work from Home\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign)\n| Collaboration of the Year\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nBillboard Women in Music\nEstablished in 2007, Billboard Woman of the Year is presented annually at Billboard Women in Music, and honors female contributions to the business, and leadership in embracing the changing music.
