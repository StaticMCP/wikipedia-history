Collectively these elements provide fresh water, land regeneration, the sequestering of carbon in soils, the closing the nutrient cycle and provides employment in deprived areas.\nThe Biomimetic Office: A sustainable office building designed with Yaniv Peer of Exploration, Arup Research & Development, Atelier Ten, Expedition Engineering, Mace Cost Consultants and Julian Vincent\nThe Mountain Data Centre: A concept for ultra-low energy data centre based on principles of efficient branching systems in biology referred to as Murray’s Law\nExternal links\n* [http://www.exploration-architecture.com/ Exploration Architecture]\n* [http://saharaforestproject.com/ Sahara Forest Project]\n* [https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-pawlyn-8066269 Michael Pawlyn LinkedIn]\n* [https://vimeo.com/111462063 Biomimetic Office Building]\n*[https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_pawlyn_using_nature_s_genius_in_architecture?language=en \"Using nature's genius in architecture\" TED talk]\nReferences"
