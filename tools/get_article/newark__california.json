In 1953, residents in the towns surrounding Newark were concerned about being annexed into the nearby city of Hayward, and began plans to incorporate as a single city, eventually becoming Fremont. Driven by their own concerns of being forced to amalgamate into this new city and the resulting changes in zoning, Newark was incorporated in September 1955, before the incorporation of Fremont was completed.\nDemographics\n1850–1870 1880-1890 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990\n2000 2010\n}}\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Newark had a population of 47,529.
