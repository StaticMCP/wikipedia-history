It was first issued by RCA Victor in conjunction with the film's release consisted over fourteen tracks. An expanded score was released by La-La Land Records and Fox Music in April 2010, in a limited edition two-disc set that contains the film's score in its entirety in addition to 12 alternate cues. The score was acclaimed by critics and won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for Motion Picture or Television.\nBackground\nThe film marked Arnold's second collaboration with Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin after working on the duo with Stargate (1994). He received the script for Independence Day and started sent to Emmerich and Devlin, before the film's shooting began. He also visited the film's set and wrote some music there and simultaneously wrote music at an hotel in Los Angeles, where Devlin would come there and listen to few key scenes, though neither Devlin and Emmerich listened the whole score (or nearly 70 percent of it) until the scoring sessions. He spent nearly four to five months writing the film's score.\nAt that point, he used several synthesizers: Atari video game console with Pro 24 audio, 16 MIDI channels, Korg M1, and samplers from Akai and Proteus Design Suite to record the score, although he might use real instruments to do the same. He did not mockup the score apart from key sequences, especially the president's speech and aliens' visit to United States. The former was considered as an important part of the film, and Arnold being keen on completing the score before recording. He wrote the basic sketches and sent the sketches to Nicholas Dodd, who orchestrated the score from the initial sketches derived.\nReception\nFilmtracks.com said \"Independence Day is a highlight of film music in the 1990's, a carefree expression of popcorn-ready bombast not equaled in its ferocity during the early years of CGI-dominated pictures. At a time when blockbuster scores were headed in the direction of Hans Zimmer's synthetic and simplistic constructs, Arnold's score was a blazing continuation of a previous generation of orchestral force.\" Zanobard Reviews rated the score 9 out of 10 and wrote \"David Arnold created a masterpiece with Independence Day, and it was a shame that he did not return for the sequel. Nevertheless, what we have here for the first film is a score for the ages, and one that definitely will not go quietly into the night.\"\nJames Southall of Movie Wave wrote \"It's blissfully unsubtle, breathlessly exciting from start to end, and the orchestration is bright enough that it avoids the headache-inducing stupour that can be caused by scores like this. Fifty minutes is the perfect length – any more, and it would surely outstay its welcome – and Arnold is unlikely to ever top this one.\" Calling it \"nothing short of brilliance\", Andrew Overfield, writing for The Sound Architect, wrote: \"The music brings to the ears a blend of chaos, frenzy and patriotism without relying heavily on digital elements and hits to emphasise the power and beast that encompasses this critically acclaimed disaster movie.\"\nTrack listing\nOriginal release\nLa-La Land Records re-issue\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from CD liner notes.\n; Production\n* Music composed and produced by – David Arnold\n* Orchestrated and conducted by – Nicholas Dodd\n* Recorded and mixed by– Dennis Sands\n* Mastered by – Joe Gastwirt\n* Supervising music editor – Laurie Higgins Tobias\n* Additional music editor – Daniel Gaber, Doug Lackey\n* Assistant music editor – Neil S.
