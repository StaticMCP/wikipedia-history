It has been represented by Democrat W. Charles Paradee since 2018, succeeding fellow Democrat Brian Bushweller.\nGeography\nDistrict 17 is based in Dover, covering most of the city proper as well as the nearby Kent County communities of Camden, Wyoming, and Rodney Village.\nLike all districts in the state, the 17th Senate district is located entirely within Delaware's at-large congressional district. It overlaps with the 28th, 29th, 31st, 32nd, and 34th districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 17th district holds elections in midterm years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of usual cycle.\n2024\n2018\n}}\n2014\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Biden 65.2 – 32.9%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Clinton 58.1 – 36.2%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Coons 57.4 – 41.1%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Obama 61.9 – 36.7%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 68.8 – 27.1%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 68.4 – 29.1%\n|}\nReferences"
