It is a part of the Network Rail Strategic Route 5, SRS 05.07 and is classified as a secondary line. It is used by a variety of inter-regional and local passenger services from East Anglia to the West Midlands and North West, as well as freight and infrastructure traffic; it also links with the busy East Coast Main Line at its western end. Fenland District Council (the area's primary local authority) put forward their Rail Development Strategy for the route in 2012, which included infrastructure upgrades for the intermediate stations, improved frequencies for the services using it (e.g. doubling the Birmingham New Street to Stansted Airport service to half-hourly and the Ipswich to Peterborough service to hourly) and establishing a Community Rail Partnership for the line in 2013–14.\nHistory\nThe line was originally opened by the Eastern Counties Railway company in 1847, linking the ECR mainline from London via  and Ely to  and  with Peterborough.  Trains initially terminated and started from , though a link to the Great Northern Railway's station was subsequently built to allow through running to the Midland Railway line to  and the GNR main line to the north.  Onward travel was also possible over two London and North Western Railway lines from Peterborough, to  and  whilst March would soon become a very busy junction with the opening of branches to  via Wisbech and Cambridge via St Ives (both by the ECR) in 1847–48 and the GNR route to  in 1867. The latter two were subsequently jointly vested in the GER and GNR in 1879.\nMany of the branches fell victim to the Beeching Axe in the early to mid 1960s, as did Peterborough East and several of the intermediate stations. The March–Spalding line also closed in 1982 with the rundown of the marshalling yard at Whitemoor, leaving only the original main line in operation.\nService\nA freight train at March\nPassenger services are provided by CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway and Greater Anglia. To the west most trains continue beyond Peterborough to either Leicester and  (via the Birmingham–Peterborough line), or to , ,  and . To the east most trains continue beyond Ely to  (via the Breckland Line),  (via the Ipswich–Ely line), or to  or  (via the Fen line). Connections are available for stations to  at Ely. Services used to run between London and Peterborough until 2010.\nThe line is used extensively by freight trains from the Port of Felixstowe to the West Midlands, North West and Scotland, as it forms part of the Felixstowe to  rail freight corridor that is being upgraded by Network Rail to allow more railborne freight from the port to be diverted away from London.\nInfrastructure\nThe line is double track throughout, has a loading gauge of W10 and a line speed of . Apart from short stretches at each end, the line is not electrified.\nSee also\n* Railways in Ely\nReferences"
