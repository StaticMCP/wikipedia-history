The title referred to the person entrusted with overall strategic control of the army, issuing orders to all military units and leading major operations, while still being subject to the political authority of the Hungarian war cabinet or Lajos Kossuth, Governor of Hungary.\nHistory\nDuring the Hungarian War of Independence, the title fővezér referred to the supreme military commander of the Hungarian Honvéd Army. This was the highest military authority, responsible for directing major strategic operations, issuing orders to all corps and generals, and overseeing the overall conduct of the war. Unlike hereditary or permanently institutionalized military ranks in other European armies, the role of fővezér was created out of political and military necessity and depended on the confidence of the Hungarian government and, later, Governor-President Lajos Kossuth. The supreme commander’s authority included command over troop movements, operational planning, and war councils, while remaining subject to civilian political leadership.\nThe appointment of the supreme commander typically occurred through a government decree or by order of the Minister of War. However, because of the shifting political and military situation, the position was not stable or permanently assigned: commanders could be appointed or removed depending on battles won or lost, and on political alliances or conflicts within the revolutionary leadership. The office was first held in practice by Lázár Mészáros, who served both as Minister of War and commander of the Honvéd Army in the autumn of 1848, however, the de jure supreme commander was Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary. From 1 November 1848, command of the main army was entrusted to Artúr Görgei, who became the next commander of the army. In early February 1849, Kossuth replaced him with the Polish general Henryk Dembiński, hoping for greater political loyalty. After Dembiński’s defeat at the Battle of Kápolna, Görgei was reinstated as supreme commander by the end of March 1849 and directed the army through the successful Spring Campaign.\nIt is important to distinguish the role of the supreme commander from that of Lajos Kossuth. While the fővezér exercised direct military command on the battlefield, Kossuth, as head of state and political leader, appointed or dismissed commanders, controlled the government, and represented the nation in domestic and diplomatic matters. Thus, the fővezér held the highest military position within a system that remained under civilian authority. The office was therefore both a military office and a reflection of how the Hungarian revolutionary state attempted to balance military necessity with political oversight.\nList of officeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100%\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style\"width:5px\" |\n! rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" class=unsortable width=120px| Portrait\n! rowspan=2 width=230px |Name\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Reports to\n|-\n!
