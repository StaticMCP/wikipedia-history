The 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate has twice been made into films. The 1982 film Inchon about the historic battle that occurred there in September 1950 was a financial and critical failure. By 2000 Hollywood alone had produced 91 feature films on the Korean War. Many films have also been produced in South Korea and other countries as well.\nFilm\nCompared to World War II, there are relatively few Western feature films depicting the Korean War.\nAmerican films\n*The Steel Helmet (1951) is a war film directed by Samuel Fuller and produced by Lippert Studios during the Korean War.
