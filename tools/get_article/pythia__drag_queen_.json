As a child, she hid her feminine traits in order to fit in with other children but found solace in comics and characters such as Cruella de Vil and Maleficent. Darlasis joined her school's gay–straight alliance in high school. She earned a certificate in set and costume design from the Regina School of Theatre in Regina, Saskatchewan. She first appeared in drag as Barbie for a costume party, although she had cosplayed as female characters such as Ariel from The Little Mermaid and celebrities such as Lady Gaga beforehand.\nShe is a Greek national and applied for Canadian citizenship in August 2020, and she obtained it in May 2022.\nCareer\nPythia is a Montreal-based drag performer who also works as a costume designer and makeup artist for film and theatre. She initially began performing in drag under the name Crystal Nebula, before renaming herself Pythia, for the mythological Oracle of Delphi, as a reference to her Greek heritage. Her drag family includes Fawn Darling and Denim, who appeared on the fourth season of ''Canada's Drag Race, as well as HercuSleaze, who appeared on the first season of Call Me Mother.\nShe was a finalist on the second season of Canada's Drag Race'', reaching the Top 3 but ultimately losing the crown to Icesis Couture. She portrayed Grimes during the Snatch Game episode, and won the \"Under the Big Top\" Rusical and the makeover challenge. According to Anna Wichmann of the Greek Reporter, Pythia is \"the first performer of Greek heritage to be featured on any of the show's multinational franchises\".\nShe has indicated that her goals in drag revolve around visual and theatrical storytelling. During the season, she received praise for several runway looks, including a two-headed fortune-teller in the \"Circus Berzerkus\" runway, a centaur in the Dungeons and Drag Queens runway and a Greek goddess statue in the finale, which were hailed as some of the most striking and original drag looks ever seen across the entire franchise.\nPythia competed on the 2024 spin-off series ''RuPaul's Drag Race Global All Stars.\nIn December 2024, Pythia and Denim premiered Oraculum, a theatre show blending drag, puppetry and projection work, at Buddies in Bad Times in Toronto. In 2025, Pythia won the Toronto Theatre Critics Award for Best Costume Design for the production.\nFilmography\n* Canada's Drag Race (season 2, 2021) - Runner-up\n* RuPaul's Drag Race Global All Stars (2024) - 7th place\n* Touch-Ups with Raven'' (2025)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
