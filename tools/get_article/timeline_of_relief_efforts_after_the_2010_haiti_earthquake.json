      "text": "# Timeline of relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake\n\nThe timeline of rescue efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake of 12 January 2010 involves the sequence of events in the days following a highly destructive 7.0 Mw earthquake with an epicenter  west of the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince. With at least 70% of the city's buildings destroyed, the earthquake also caused damage and loss of life in other parts of the country. The Haitian government experienced a near-collapse and affected people were left mostly to their own resources until foreign aid arrived in the following days.\nInitial death toll estimates ranged between 50,000 and 200,000.\nTuesday 12 January 2010\n16:53 local time (21:53 UTC): the earthquake happened.\nPeople dug through rubble, rescuing survivors and recovering bodies. The bodies were laid out in the streets, some in piles. During the night, many people digging through the rubble used flashlights or torches.\nThe Argentine Air Force Mobile Field Hospital, already deployed at Port-au-Prince, was the only medical facility still open. Argentine helicopters from the United Nations force were helping evacuate the gravely injured people to Santo Domingo.\n13 January 2010\nHaitian Rescuers searched collapsed buildings for victims. The wounded were taken to hospital in ambulances, police pickup trucks, wheelbarrows, and improvised stretchers. Many hospitals collapsed: on 13 January 2010, the Argentine military field hospital remained open in Port-au-Prince, and it was struggling to attend to the huge numbers of injured. Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) reported that at least two hospitals were still in good shape, and their doctors would begin treating about 500 people who needed emergency surgery. Bodies of the victims were piled on the streets. Heavy equipment was needed to dig through the ruins; many people were still trapped in collapsed buildings. A triage center was set up in a parking lot, but the wounded were forced to lie in medical tents to await treatment, due to the many patients, and water was scarce. In Pétion-Ville, people used sledgehammers and their hands to dig through a collapsed commercial center.\nThe first international team to arrive in Port-au-Prince was ICE-SAR from Iceland, landing within 24&nbsp;hours of the earthquake. Some rescue teams, such as the ones from Cuba, arrived in Haiti and started their mission. The Peruvian government sent rescue teams, dogs and 50&nbsp;tons of food transported by two Peruvian Air Force airplanes. Peruvian companies were providing food donations and other basic aid. However, the scale of rescue and relief efforts was yet to meet the need. Because of difficulties reaching some affected areas, some rescue teams tried to enter Haiti through the Dominican Republic. The United States Coast Guard deployed helicopters and several aircraft and cutters to the region to aid in relief work and perform reconnaissance flights over Haiti, which aided in assessing the worst damaged areas. The Coast Guard Cutter Forward arrived in the waters off Port-au-Prince at about 8&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, and together with a Maritime Intelligence Support Team was able to assess some of the damage caused to the port. The Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk also arrived in the coastal waters of Haiti on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross set up a special website to facilitate family contacts, which allowed people in Haiti and abroad to register the names of relatives whom they wanted to contact. It incorporated responses to those queries as they became available. Catholic Relief Services, which has worked in Haiti for 50&nbsp;years, prepared food and other aid to help those affected, committing US $5&nbsp;million to help survivors.\nAt 7pm EST a team of United States Air Force Combat Controllers landed at Toussaint Louverture International Airport and established control of Air Traffic Control duties within 28 minutes to assist in humanitarian aid efforts.  The Combat Controllers directed over 2,500 flights without incident from a card table using only hand radios. Under their direction planes were able to take off and land every five minutes, bringing in over 4 million lb. of supplies. The team leader of the Combat Controllers, Chief Master Sergeant Tony Travis, was later recognized as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2010 because of their efforts.\n14 January 2010\nMedical aid for the Haiti earthquake became a military-style operation. At least 20 countries provided manpower, supplies or financial aid to Haiti, while the most immediate foreign assistance was being provided by military and humanitarian contingents from neighboring Dominican Republic. Dominican president Leonel Fernández visited Haiti to set up an emergency plan for assistance with president René Préval, to include reestablishing communications, rescuing the victims, burying the dead, clearing the rubble, reestablishing the supplies for electricity and water and coordinating the Dominican army with the United Nations Stabilization Mission for the relief operations. Colombia's military also contributed to the relief effort by sending relief flights. Jamaica sent a team of 168 military and medical personnel to Port-au-Prince.\nStaff of the International Committee of the Red Cross already in the country distributed medical items to hospitals and two ICRC-chartered aircraft carrying specialized staff and 40&nbsp;tonnes of relief supplies – mainly medical items – left Geneva for the island. At the same time, the organization made its forensic expertise available to organizations attempting to recover and identify the dead.\nCommunication and infrastructure problems were worsened by the destruction. Streets were clogged with debris and rubble, making it nearly impossible to distribute food, water, temporary shelter, and medical supplies that had been delivered throughout the day by international charities and governments to the airport. Ships were also unable to render aid because the port facilities had been too damaged. The Port-au-Prince morgue became overwhelmed with thousands of dead bodies that were laid outside on the streets and sidewalks. Aid workers began to concentrate on identification and disposal of corpses. Concerns were also raised by a representative from Oxfam that aid workers may be overwhelmed with rampant crime from gangs who had taken over the country, which prompted the UN to intervene to restore some order.\nmap of Port-au-Prince and Carrefour made almost entirely by volunteers after the earthquake. ([http://osm.org/go/YeSUiJG-- link to larger version])]]\nSocial networking became a significant response to the earthquake as Twitter and Facebook spread messages and pleas to assist; \"Haiti\", \"Help Haiti\", and \"Red Cross\" were among the most popular topics on Twitter. However, Haitians updating their Facebook statuses were blocked for repeatedly sending messages to tell people that they and their friends or family members were alive, which triggered spam guards on the website. The American Red Cross generated $7&nbsp;million within 24&nbsp;hours by offering an option to text message $10 donations by cell phone, setting a record for mobile donating. The OpenStreetMap community responded by greatly improving the level of mapping available for the area using post-earthquake satellite photography provided by GeoEye.\n15 January 2010\nA reported 9,000 corpses were cleared off the street by Haitian government crews, and buried in mass graves, with thousands more awaiting burial in the streets and outside the morgue. Search and rescue teams from eight nations were employed to attempt to find survivors still trapped in buildings. Transportation into the affected areas remained problematic, as a bottleneck blocked aid arriving from the Port-au-Prince airport. Some organizations landed in Santo Domingo and drove into Haiti on rugged dirt roads. Pilots were told that any flights coming into Port-au-Prince should expect to circle the airport for at least an hour, and that no jet fuel was available.\nCuba lifted airspace restrictions to allow US airplanes to save time transporting critically wounded Haitians to the US.\nMédecins Sans Frontières reported that the need for medical services at their two hospitals was \"overwhelming\". Although it had been badly damaged, the Hotel Villa Creole in Port-au-Prince was transformed into a hospital and media center; journalists used the drained swimming pool as an operating base, and Hope for Haiti and the International Medical Corps started a makeshift clinic for the wounded. The Dominican Institute of Communications set up a cell tower using a satellite link, to replace towers damaged by the quake.\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada will consider fast-tracking immigration to help Haitian refugees. In the US, Haitians were granted Temporary Protected Status after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called the earthquake \"a disaster of historic proportions\". Temporary protected status will allow about 100,000 Haitians in the United States illegally to stay for 18&nbsp;months, will stop the current deportations of 30,000 more, but will not apply to Haitians outside the US.\nThe U.N. World Food Programme denied that its warehouses in the Haitian capital had been looted, contrary to earlier erroneous reports. A Russian search-and-rescue team said the looting and general insecurity were forcing them to suspend their efforts after nightfall. Aid organizations were urged by the Brazilian military to add security details. The destruction of the U.N. base by the earthquake added to problems keeping order; the U.N. Stabilization Force was in Haiti before the earthquake to assist with emergency relief efforts, necessary because the country has a significant gang presence.\nThe staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Haiti distributed medical aid, assessing water needs and prepared for the arrival of several Emergency Response Units sent by Red Cross societies from across the world. These include a field hospital, mobile health units and water and sanitation units. The ICRC began working with the Federation and the Haitian Red Cross to enable these arriving specialists to be operational.\nThe tracking website Ushahidi joined social networking efforts, as messages from multiple sites were collected to assist Haitians still trapped or to get word to family members of survivors.\nOn the dawn of 15 January 2010,  and her escort group began deploying their helicopters, after sailing from the US at full speed. During her first day on-scene, she transferred about 35,000&nbsp;gallons of fresh water to shore; she has the overall capability to distill 400,000&nbsp;gallons daily. Carl Vinson will also provide medical, air transport, and food preparation facilities; she offloaded combat aircraft in order to provide more space for relief supplies and an increased complement of 19 helicopters. The carrier is transporting 600,000 emergency food rations and 100,000 ten-liter water containers; 20,000 containers of water were distributed on 15 January 2010. The amphibious helicopter carrier  has also been deployed to Haiti, along with three large dock landing ships and two survey and salvage vessels, intending to create a \"sea base\" for the rescue effort.\nOn 15 January 2010, an Australian news crew assisted in the rescue of an 18-month-old baby girl from the rubble of her home. While the majority of the crew assisted from on top of the rubble, a man from the Dominican Republic working with the crew became frustrated with the pace and climbed into the rubble himself. He pulled the baby out. Her uncle was one of the people trying to rescue her. He said her mother was dead. Baby Winnie was seemingly unhurt from her ordeal of 68&nbsp;hours in the rubble. A Spanish firefighting team, part of the Grupo de Especialistas Bomberos de Castilla y Leon, rescued a toddler from building rubble, and reunited him with his family. It was the first foreign mission of the team.\n16 January 2010\nA rescue team sent by the Israel Defense Forces' Home Front Command established a field hospital which included specialised facilities to perform surgery, treat children, the elderly, and women in labour near the United Nations building in Port-au-Prince. It was set up in eight hours and began operations on the evening of 16 January.\nFrench Navy vessel  left Martinique on 15 January 2010 carrying 60 Army personnel, land vehicles, and excavators.

By 16 January 2010, US military helicopters were airdropping food and supplies to the survivors.\nBy 18 January 2010, approximately 10,000 US troops are expected to be off the shores of Haiti, while MINUSTAH retains primary responsibility for security in Port-au-Prince, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The US Dept. of Defense has created Joint Task Force Haiti to coordinate the Pentagon's relief efforts. Port-au-Prince's airport, now operated by the US military, can currently handle 90 flights a day, far short of what is needed; other distribution problems have become apparent, but despite the tension there are signs that aid is reaching those in need. Paratroopers from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division set up a base for distributing water and food as the number of dead remains unknown.\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross emergency experts assessed the capacity of the city's main medical facilities, the water and sanitation infrastructure of Port-au-Prince's Cité Soleil neighbourhood, and the assistance needs of those living in makeshift camps. ICRC teams also provided more non-food assistance to several local hospitals and places of detention.\nThe first Red Cross basic health care emergency response unit (ERUs, designed to provide basic and immediate health care to 30,000 people) arrived on 16 January.
