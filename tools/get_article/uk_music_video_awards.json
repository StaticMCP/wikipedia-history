      "text": "# UK Music Video Awards\n\nThe UK Music Video Awards is an annual celebration of creativity, technical excellence and innovation in music video and moving image for music. The awards began in 2008. There is a wide range of opportunities for UK individuals and companies to enter their work: from genre-led video categories, to prizes for individuals in the technical and craft areas of the business, to recognition for innovative approaches to music videos, ads and other visuals. There are also awards for international videos and outstanding individuals, voted for by the MVA jury members. The Awards take place in the autumn, with the entry process opening in early August. The UK MVA’s are originally the key members of the team behind BUG, the BFI Southbank’s music video strand, and have 20 years’ experience running events in the UK music video business.\nCeremonies\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Edition\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Venue\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Host\n!colspan=\"3\"|Video of the Year\n|-\n!Video\n!Musician\n!Director\n|-\n!1st\n| 14 October 2008\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Leicester Square\n|rowspan=\"12\"|Adam Buxton\n|\"Wanderlust\"\n|Björk\n|Encyclopedia Pictura\n|-\n!2nd\n|13 October 2009\n|\"Strawberry Swing\"\n|Coldplay\n|Shynola\n|-\n!3rd\n|12 October 2010\n|\"This Too Shall Pass\"\n|OK Go\n|James Frost, Synn Labs and OK Go\n|-\n!4th\n|8 November 2011\n|\"Simple Math\"\n|Manchester Orchestra\n|Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\n|-\n!5th\n|8 November 2012\n|\"Bad Girls\"\n|M.I.A.\n|Romain Gavras\n|-\n!6th\n|28 October 2013\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Queen Elizabeth Hall\n|\"Until the Quiet Comes\"\n|Flying Lotus\n|Kahlil Joseph\n|-\n!7th\n| 10 November 2014\n|\"Turn Down for What\"\n|DJ Snake and Lil Jon\n|Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\n|-\n!8th\n|5 November 2015\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Roundhouse\n|\"Alright\"\n|Kendrick Lamar\n|Colin Tilley and The Little Homies\n|-\n!9th\n|20 October 2016\n|\"Gosh\"\n|Jamie xx\n|Romain Gavras\n|-\n!10th\n|26 October 2017\n|\"Wyclef Jean\"\n|Young Thug\n|Ryan Staake\n|-\n!11th\n|25 October 2018\n|\"This Is America\"\n|Childish Gambino\n|Hiro Murai\n|-\n!12th\n|23 October 2019\n|\"Vossi Bop\"\n|Stormzy\n|Henry Scholfield\n|-\n!13th\n|5 November 2020\n|Virtual\n|Becca Dudley\n|\"Rocket Fuel\"\n|DJ Shadow featuring De La Soul\n|Sam Pilling\n|-\n!14th\n|4 November 2021\n|Roundhouse\n|Maisie Adam\n|\"Mesmerize\"\n|Duck Sauce\n|Keith Schofield\n|-\n!15th\n|27 October 2022\n| rowspan=\"4\"| Magazine London\n| Spencer Jones\n|  \"Cash In Cash Out\"\n| Pharrell Williams, 21 Savage and Tyler, the Creator\n| François Rousselet\n|-\n!16th\n|26 October 2023\n|rowspan=3|Ana Matronic\n|\"Mama's Eyes\"\n|METTE\n|Camille Summers-Valli\n|-\n!17th\n|24 October 2024\n|\"360\"\n|Charli XCX\n|Aidan Zamiri\n|-\n!18th\n|30 October 2025\n| \"Tailor Swif\"\n| A$AP Rocky\n| Vania Heymann & Gal Muggia\n|-\n|}\nCategories\nAs of 2025, 38 competitive categories are awarded split in video genre (which are divided in British, international and newcomer), special video, craft and technical and individual and company categories plus the Video of the Year and special categories like the Icon Award.\nCurrent categories\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
