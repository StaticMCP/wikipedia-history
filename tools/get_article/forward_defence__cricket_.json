But there can be opportunities to score from this shot, if the shot is particularly well timed, or if the batsmen run a quick single.\nPlayed to a good length ball, the batsman attempts to defend his wicket by smothering the ball before it has an opportunity to spin or move off the seam. With a well-bent front knee, the shot can also help combat variable bounce.\nExternal links\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/skills/4173826.stm The Forward Defensive Shot - BBC]\n* [https://www.sportplan.net/drills/Cricket/Front-foot-batting/Front-foot-defence-frontdef.jsp How to Play the forward defence]"
