The election was the first one in which women had a right to vote.\nThe election was the first held since Premier William Kidston, formerly of the Labour Party, had founded a new movement with his own supporters as well as the Parliamentary Conservatives. The end result of the election was an improvement in Kidston's position, although he was still in minority government with Labour support. The main opposition group was Robert Philp's Conservatives.\nThis election used contingent voting, at least in the single-member districts.\nFive districts were two-seat districts - Mackay, Marlborough, North Brisbane, Rockhampton and South Brisbane. In the two-member constituencies, plurality block voting was used -- electors could cast two valid votes but were allowed to \"plump\".\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!

The Legislative Council was a fully nominated body.\nElectoral system changes\nThis election was the first held since women in Queensland gained the right to vote, although indigenous women did not gain the right until 1962.\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1904–1907\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1907–1908\n* First Kidston Ministry\nReferences\nExternal links"
