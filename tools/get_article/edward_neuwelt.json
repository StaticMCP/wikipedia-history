He is known for his research on the blood-brain barrier and the development of new treatments for brain tumors.\nEducation and career\nNeuwelt received his medical degree from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and completed his residency in neurosurgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, Texas. He then completed research fellowships in neuro-oncology and neurosurgery at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and then another at Queen Square Hospital in London, England.\nNeuwelt joined OHSU in 1981 as an assistant professor of neurology and neurosurgery. He became a full professor in 1990. He also holds a joint appointment at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where he directs the Blood-Brain Barrier Program.\nResearch\nNeuwelt's research has focused on developing new treatments for brain tumors, including the use of chemotherapy. He has also studied the blood-brain barrier, a protective barrier that prevents many drugs from reaching the brain. Neuwelt has developed techniques for temporarily opening the blood-brain barrier to allow drugs to reach brain tumors more effectively.\nLater research\nIn the later years of his research career, Neuwelt focused on the use of iron oxide nanoparticles to diagnose central nervous system inflammatory diseases and primary central nervous system lymphoma. He also led the development and clinical trials of a new method to protect children from high-frequency hearing loss caused by chemotherapy treatment of pediatric tumors, using sodium thiosulfate.\nHis research resulted in the successful licensure of sodium thiosulfate by the Food and Drug Administration in 2023, making it the first drug approved to prevent hearing loss in children receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.\nPublications\nNeuwelt has published over 400 peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and reviews on his research topics. He has also edited several books on the blood-brain barrier and its manipulation.\nSome of his most cited publications include:\n* Neuwelt, E. A., Lewy, A. J. (1983). Disappearance of plasma melatonin after removal of a neoplastic pineal gland. New England Journal of Medicine, 308(19), 1132–1135.\n* Neuwelt, E. A., Barnett, P. A., Bigner, D. D., Frenkel, E. P.
