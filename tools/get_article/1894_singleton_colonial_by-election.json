Such ministerial by-elections were usually uncontested and four ministers were re-elected unopposed, James Brunker (East Maitland), Joseph Carruthers (St George), Jacob Garrard (Sherbrooke) and James Young (The Manning). A poll was required in Bathurst (Sydney Smith), Hartley (Joseph Cook), Singleton and Sydney-King (George Reid) however all were comfortably re-elected.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date !!
