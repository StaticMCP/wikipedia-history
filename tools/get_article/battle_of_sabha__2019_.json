On 18 January, the LNA raided AQIM and ISIS militants northwest of Sabha, claiming to have killed three of their notable members. Clashes continued between the LNA and the militias within the city of Sabha, although the airport stayed under the control of the GNA. On 1 February, Toubou tribesmen ambushed and killed four members of the 128th brigade of the LNA. A day after the LNA announced control of the town, heavy fighting broke out between Toubou fighters and the LNA in the town of Ghadduwah, south of Sabha. LNA forces secured Sabha airport and other strategic sites after local groups agreed to hand them over. The commander of the sixth infantry unit of the GNA, Hamid al-Atabi, accused Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj of not providing adequate support to his forces, which resulted in the GNA retreat from Sabha on 4 February. Control of Sabha is seen as vital for controlling southern Libya's oilfields, allowing the LNA to secure oil facilities including El Sharara oil field, the biggest in Libya.\nReferences"
