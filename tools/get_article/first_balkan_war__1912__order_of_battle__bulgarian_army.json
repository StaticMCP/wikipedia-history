After its mobilization the field army counted for 366,209 men and represented half the field forces of the Balkan League. Its greater part was deployed in the main theater of the war in Thrace  but the army also contributed to the allied war effort in Macedonia. This order of battle includes all combat units, including engineer and artillery units, but not medical, supply, signal and border guard units.\nGHQ\nThe nominal commander in chief of the Bulgarian Army was Tsar Ferdinand I but de facto its control and leadership were in the hands of his deputy Lieutenant-General Mihail Savov.

containing four infantry battalions. Additionally these divisions contained two artillery regiments, a cavalry regiment and an engineer battalion.  Their full battle strength consisted of 24 infantry battalions while their total strength made them the equivalent of an army corps. Due to tactical necessities the 1st and 6th divisions each gave one brigade for the formation of a new 10th division and fought during the war with a battle strength of 16 battalions.\nNotes\n;Footnotes\n;Citations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bulgarianartillery.it/ Orders of Battle]"
