Two years later, a similar object was unsuccessfully chased by a military aircraft from Žatec above Western Bohemia. In 1992, similar object was observed in Cheb, near Prague and near Dvůr Králové.\n1987, Vranov\nVranov UFO incident is considered the most famous and arguably the most serious incident of sighting of an unidentified flying object over Czech territory. This incident took place on 12 July 1987 in Vranov nad Dyjí above the Vranov Reservoir, which was full of visitors. The observation began at 12 noon local time. The crew of the helicopter regiment was ordered to pursue an unknown object. The weather on the day of the event was typical for the season and climate, with cumulus clouds above 1.5&nbsp;km. The object, i.e. the target of the helicopter regiment, was first located in Austria, close to the state border. At first the pilots thought the guidance station was vectoring them onto the cloud. After a while, a black object in the shape of a cigar flew over them. They received an instruction from the ground to shoot down the object, but according to the pilots' description, the machine behaved very strangely. Whenever the machine was aimed in the crosshairs, it immediately changed direction. Moreover, shooting was also not possible due to the fact that they were located above the Vranovská dam, which was full of people, i.e. vacationers. After two minutes of visual contact, the object disappeared behind the cloud. The pilots flew on. First Lieutenant Jaroslav Špaček claims: Then probably the worst situation occurred during the entire flight. The object was flying directly towards their helicopter and they had to dodge it with great difficulty. At great, allegedly supersonic speed, the object, the target of the helicopter regiment, then moved over Brno, Jaslovské Bohunice and towards Bratislava, where after a while it was no longer visible on the radar.\n1991, Miličín\nOn 12 July 1991 a glowing round object was seen near Miličín causing panic among local population. Sphere appeared randomly, silently followed people, scaring them to death. It was allegedly seen by hundreds of witnesses and only a few people spoke. Local pastor reportedly told people that this was a divine miracle and they should keep quiet about it. Several people testified that they saw the outlines of figures in the sphere. In some cases the figures even left the sphere and were walking on a roof of an empty cottage and were \"repairing\" something leaving behind large and four-fingered footprints in the mud. One man was so bewitched by the sphere that he set off after it into the darkness, despite the neighbors calling him back, only to return later and confused. Another person reports a waste of time. And one lady said that figures came to her house and left only after she screamed, cried and prayed loudly.\n1992, Tři Sekery\nOn 5 May 1992 military radars showed an object approaching the Czechoslovak border from Germany. It crossed border near Tři Sekery. it was heading to the village of Hvozd. Several fighter jets and helicopters were sent after the object. Although the object was visible on the radar and was also seen by a number of observers from the ground, pilots did not find it despite the good weather. According to the radar, the unknown object headed towards Chomutov and suddenly disappeared near Jirkov.\n1993, Borová\nOn 21 August 1993 Mr. Š took his dog for a walk and came across an object similar to a flatfish without a tail and about 70&nbsp;cm in length and 40–50&nbsp;cm in height. The strange object was standing or hanging about 30 or 40&nbsp;cm above the road and was not moving. Then he started to move and began to float noiselessly. The day after, sightings of UFOs of various shapes and sizes sprang up in a number of places in the Czech Republic. Shapes varied from cigar-shaped planes to glowing triangles.\n2009\nDuring late May 2009 there were various reports of people seeing flying objects on various places in the Czech Republic.\n*On 23 May 2009 at 21:00 a group of 4 people saw four orange lights flying at roughly equal intervals near Klínovec. One of these people tried to take photo of these objects until they disappeared. Similar objects were seen at 22:00 above Chrást near Plzeň.\n*On 24 May 2009 at 22:30 people in Říčany saw three glowing spheres flying in the sky.\n*On 31 May 2009 Deník.cz published article according to which a university professor who wanted to remain anonymous saw on 25 May 2009 flying objects above Brno highway.
