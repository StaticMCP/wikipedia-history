It was released in 1972 and was his only release for United Artists Records.\nBackground\nIn 1971, Ware collaborated with Ike & Tina Turner, co-writing several songs on their album, 'Nuff Said. The moderate success of '''Nuff Said'' led the Turners' record label at the time, United Artists, to hand Ware a recording contract as a solo artist.\nReception\n}}\nAlthough the album failed to chart, the album did receive positive reviews from critics. Bob Talbert of the Detroit Free Press wrote, \"Detroiter Leon Ware is a marvelous songwriter\". He continued, \"Ware is also a superb singer...\" Omaha World-Herald commended the album, citing that the album was \"the strong, individualistic vocal and piano work of Leon Ware\". Moreover, they predicted that \"[Ware] should be headed for considerable popularity\". In 1972, Ware appeared in an advertisement on Billboard to promote the album.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n| title2 = Able, Qualified and Ready\n| length2 = 3:15\n| writer2 =\n| title3 = Why Be Alone\n| length3 = 3:31\n| writer3 =\n| title4 = Mr. Evolution\n| length4 = 2:57\n| writer4 =\n| title5 = Nothing's Sweeter Than My Baby's Love\n| length5 = 2:43\n}}\nSide two\n| title3 = It's Just a Natural Thing\n| length3 = 3:26\n| title4 = Tamed to be Wild\n| length4 = 4:01\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Leon Ware – vocals, piano, arrangement, producer\n* Doug Gilmore – producer\n* Gorden De Witty – piano, organ\n* Jeff Brown – organ\n* Jackie Clark – guitar, bass\n* Ernie McDaniel – bass\n* Terry Furlong – guitar\n* Jimmy Brown, Stu Perry – drums\n* Clydie King, Jesse Smith, Julia Tillman, Maxine Willard, Patrice Holloway – backing vocals\n* Christina Hersch, Jerry Burns – recording engineer\n* Norman Seeff – art direction, photography\n* Dave Bhang – design\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.discogs.com/master/336771-Leon-Ware-Leon-Ware Leon Ware] at Discogs (list of releases)"
