The Ottomans advised the Sultan of al-Shihr, Badr, to not submit to the Portuguese and left cannons and 100 levends with the Sultan of al-Shihr. Mustafa Bey left al-Shihr in December 1530 while Khoja Zufar remained with Badr. A Portuguese force of 9 sails led by Manoel de Vasconcellos immediately arrived at the port of al-Shihr, however, Khoja Zufar prevented the Portuguese from entering al-Shihr, and he defeated and drove out the Portuguese forces.\nSee also\n* Battle of Ash-Shihr (1523)\n* Battle of al-Shihr (1548)\nReferences"
