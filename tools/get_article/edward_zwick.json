Zwick (born October 8, 1952) is an American filmmaker. He has worked primarily in the comedy drama and epic historical film genres and received an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for his work producing Shakespeare in Love (1998).\nHe made his film debut with the comedy About Last Night (1986), followed by Glory (1989), Legends of the Fall (1994), Courage Under Fire (1996), The Siege (1998), The Last Samurai (2003), Blood Diamond (2006), and Defiance (2008). His later films include Love & Other Drugs (2010), Pawn Sacrifice (2014), and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016).\nHe is also the co-creator of the ABC family drama series thirtysomething and Once and Again.\nEarly life and education\nZwick was born on October 8, 1952, into a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Ruth Ellen (née Reich) and Allen Zwick. He attended New Trier High School, received a B.A. at Harvard in 1974, and graduated from the AFI Conservatory with a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1975.\nDespite sharing a surname and profession, Edward is unrelated to fellow director Joel Zwick. He has been married to actress Liberty Godshall since 1982, and they have two grown children.\nCareer\nHis films include Glory (1989), Legends of the Fall (1994), The Siege (1998), The Last Samurai (2003), Blood Diamond (2006), and Defiance (2008). Along with Marshall Herskovitz, Zwick runs The Bedford Falls Company (named after the town in Frank Capra's ''It's a Wonderful Life). The film production company has produced such films as Traffic and Shakespeare in Love and the TV shows thirtysomething, Relativity, Once and Again, and My So-Called Life''.\nZwick's body of work has earned numerous accolades, including an Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Picture as a producer, and Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Writing in a Limited Series, and Outstanding Dramatic Special. He was one of the recipients of the Academy Award for Best Picture for Shakespeare in Love; he was also nominated in the same category for Traffic. He has also been nominated for multiple Golden Globe Awards.\nIn 2024, Zwick released his memoir, Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions: My Fortysomething Years in Hollywood.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n! width=\"65\" |Director\n! width=\"65\" |Producer\n! width=\"65\" |Writer\n|-\n| 1986\n| About Last Night...\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1989\n| Glory\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1992\n| Leaving Normal\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1994\n| Legends of the Fall\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1996\n| Courage Under Fire\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1998\n| The Siege\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2003\n| The Last Samurai\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Blood Diamond\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| Defiance\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n| Love & Other Drugs\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| Pawn Sacrifice\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2016\n| Jack Reacher: Never Go Back\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| The Great Wall\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n| American Assassin\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n| Trial by Fire\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\nProducer only\n* Dangerous Beauty (1998)\n* Shakespeare in Love (1998)\n* Traffic (2000)\n* I Am Sam (2001)\n* Abandon (2002)\n* Cut Bank (2014)\n* Woman Walks Ahead (2017)\n| style=\"width:70%;\"|\nExecutive producer\n* Lone Star State of Mind (2002)\n* Boys of Abu Ghraib (2014)\n* About Alex (2014)\n* The Birth of a Nation (2016)\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
