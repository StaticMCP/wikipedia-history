In 2019, he rose to fame as a finalist on the MTV India reality show MTV Hustle. He is best known for his singles \"Ghumshudaa\" (2019), \"Tu Aake Dekhle\" (2020), \"Oops\" (2022), \"Pablo\" (2022) and \"Maan Meri Jaan\" (2022). \"Maan Meri Jaan\" achieved commercial success, becoming the most streamed song of 2023 on Spotify India, and other music streaming platforms.\nEarly life\nArpan was born on 10 October 1995 in Uttar Pradesh, India. He attended a government school for his early education before enrolling in Vinay Marg Navyug Secondary School in New Delhi. He later gained admission to Dyal Singh College through the sport quota to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree.\nArpan played for the national under -20 team for four years during his time in college. Despite his athletic achievements, he eventually dropped out to focus on his passion for rapping.\nKing began sharing his music online through his YouTube channel, \"King Rocco,\" which he launched in 2012. He continued to upload his music to various social media platforms while in school. In an interview with NME, he cited early musical influences including pop groups like the Backstreet Boys and Vengaboys.\nCareer\n2018-2020:Career beginnings, MTV Hustle and debut album\nKing began his professional career in early 2018, dropping his first EP Talismann, which included 7 tracks (as per his ReverbNation release, the EP originally included 6 songs). He released the Mashhoor Chp 1 in 2019, which included 10 tracks and subsequently, participated in the inaugural season of the rap reality show MTV Hustle, where he was judged by Raftaar, Raja Kumari, and Nucleya. He rose to fame as a finalist on the show in 2019.\nFollowing MTV Hustle, King released 2 of the lead singles from his subsequent fourth studio album New Life, namely, \"Tum Saath Rehnaa\" and \"No Loss\", but due to the COVID-19 outbreak, he couldn't proceed with the album rollout and instead, announced a limited edition mixtape Heartbreak Made Me Do It. It released in April 2020 comprising eight tracks. Over 500 digital copies were sold, and a half of the funds raised by the album sales were donated to the PMCARES fund.\nKing finally released his debut album, The Carnival, on September 21, 2020. The album featured the sleeper hit \"Tu Aake Dekhle,\" which became his first breakthrough and garnered significant attention, becoming one of his signature tracks and a chart-topping hit.\n2021-2023: Maan Meri Jaan, and subsequent projects\nHe followed this with his second album, The Gorilla Bounce, in 2021.\nIn 2022, King made his major-label debut with his Khwabeeda EP, which featured tracks like “Baazi”, “Ektarfa”, and “Sinner” and was his first release with Warner Music India. Later that year, he released his album, \"Champagne Talk\" which consisted of singles like “Pablo”, \"Oops\" and \"Maan Meri Jaan,\" which went on to become the most streamed song on Spotify, Apple Music, and Shazam in India in 2023. He subsequently released multiple versions of \"Maan Meri Jaan\" featuring artists from different language backgrounds, including a Hindi-English version titled \"Maan Meri Jaan (Afterlife)\" with Nick Jonas. “Maan Meri Jaan” was also featured in Spotify’s Top 50 Viral Charts in 2023. He debuted in Bollywood with the song \"Sahi Galat\" from the film Drishyam 2 in 2022.\nIn April 2023, King partnered with Indian entrepreneur Raj Shamani and his company, House of X, to launch his debut perfume brand, Blanko.\nIn 2023, King released a three-track EP titled Shayad Woh Sune, which included songs such as \"Laapata\" and \"Teri Ho Na Saki\".\n2024-present: New Life, collaborations and Cannes debut\nFollowing the EP's release, he launched his long-awaited fourth studio album, New Life, featuring collaborations with international artists, such as Gucci Mane and Julia Michaels. Tracks such as \"Crown\", \"Good Trip\", and \"Sarkaare\" from the album garnered critical acclaim, with \"Good Trip\" being featured in the Grammy Recording Academy’s Global Spin series. Additionally, his song \"We Are The Ones\" was included in the official soundtrack for the video game EA SPORTS FC 24. He performed a 9-city tour across India in support of his album New Life. The tour included performances in Bengaluru, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Goa, among other cities.\nIn the same year, Sony India appointed King as the brand ambassador for its audio product category. He was also shortlisted as one of GQ India’s 35 Most Influential Young Indians and performed at the closing ceremony of the Indian Premier League Final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.\nIn 2024, King released his fifth studio album, Monopoly Moves, featuring collaborations with Indian rappers like MC STΔN, Ikka, Seedhe Maut and Raftaar. The songs \"GOAT SHIT\", \"F*CK WHAT THEY SAY\" and \"KODAK\" garnered significant attention, particularly due to the performance of the featuring artists on the tracks. He also released the single \"Bumpa\" with Jason Derulo in the same year, as well as his long-awaited collaboration “Aawara” with American producer KSHMR and Indian singer Zaeden. King partnered with Red Bull to release “Shining Star,” which served as the official anthem for the Red Bull Dance Your Style World Final 2024.\nIn the same year, King attended the 77th Cannes Film Festival as part of the Brut India delegation, becoming the first Indian pop artist to walk the red carpet at the event. He was later featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list in the Entertainment & Sports category. In April 2024, he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone India as part of their Future of Music ‘24 list.\nDiscography\nAlbums (LPs)\n{| class=\"wikitable
