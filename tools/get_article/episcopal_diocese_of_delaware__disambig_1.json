It consists of 33 congregations or parishes in an area the same as the State of Delaware. The diocese is led by a bishop and staff and provides episcopal supervision and some administrative assistance for its parishes.\nThe current bishop, the eleventh Bishop of Delaware, is Kevin Scott Brown, who was consecrated bishop December 9, 2017, and succeeded Wayne P. Wright upon the latter's retirement. The diocesan offices were located for many years at the campus of the Cathedral Church of Saint John, in Wilmington, Delaware. When the cathedral closed in 2012, the offices moved, in 2014, to 913 Wilson Road, Wilmington, DE the site of the former Saint Alban's Church.\nHistory\nThe Episcopal Church in Delaware, formerly known as the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware, dates its foundation to 1785, the first time a delegation was sent representing the diocese to the General Convention. Charles Wharton presided over the first state convention on September 26, 1786, at which it was decided to form a wholly separate diocese from that of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania or the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland, but under the episcopal supervision of the Bishop of Pennsylvania. It is one of the nine original Dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.\nList of bishops\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops over Delaware\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 8%;\" | From\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 8%;\" | Until\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 28%;\" | Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 51%;\" | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1787\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1828\n| William White, Bishop of Pennsylvania\n| Resigned Delaware only, retaining Pennsylvania; also Presiding Bishop, 1789 and from 1795.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1828\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1841\n| Henry U.
