It began in 1987 as the official magazine of The Lucasfilm Fan Club, and was renamed in 1994 to coincide with the release of Star Wars: TIE Fighter.\nIts contents include stories, articles relating to the Star Wars universe, letters, and the fan newsletter \"Bantha Tracks\". In February 2021, Star Wars Insider reached two hundred issues.\nOn November 10, 2025, it was announced publication of the Magazine would wrap up with Issue #237, scheduled to be released in early 2026.\nContent\nStar Wars Insider has sections that detail updates in the Star Wars universe, news about events, fan fiction, exclusive previews, short stories, articles that explore the Star Wars universe, questions and answers, excerpts from comics and books, and interviews. Often it has many humorous comics and stories. Recently, it has retained a humorous air, especially with their now-defunct \"Dear 2-1B\" column. The magazine also features advertising for many things, (Star Wars-related and non-Star Wars), and a catalog of Star Wars merchandise. One of the sections is called \"Bantha Tracks\", which is created entirely by the fans.\nPublishers\nThe magazine is currently edited by Jonathan Wilkins. It has been published by many different companies. But at Star Wars Celebration IV, Star Wars Insider relaunched under the new publisher: Titan Magazines.\n{|\n| Issues 1-22\n| The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine\n| Lucasfilm\n|-\n| Issues 23-50\n| Star Wars Insider\n| Fantastic Media\n|-\n| Issues 51-61\n| Star Wars Insider\n| Wizards of the Coast\n|-\n| Issues 62-76\n| Star Wars Insider\n| Paizo Publishing\n|-\n| Issues 77-92\n| Star Wars Insider\n| IDG Entertainment\n|-\n| Issues 93-onwards\n| Star Wars Insider\n| Titan Magazines\n|}\nStar Wars Insider is not delivered to Germany as this country has its own licensed publication, Star Wars -- Das offizielle Magazin (\"Star Wars -- The Official Magazine\"), which is published quarterly instead of bi-monthly, and features many articles and short stories taken from Star Wars Insider. The same was true of the UK until Titan Magazines took over Star Wars Insider in 2007 and merged it with the UK Star Wars Magazine.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://www.jeditemplearchives.com/specialreports/banthatracks/ Bantha Tracks]"
