Games between the two teams, even those that are only friendly matches, are often marked by notable and sometimes controversial incidents; though the rivalry is mostly described as friendly and closeness because of historical tie. These matches are also called \"Federal derby\" or lesser extent, \"Brother derby\", due to cultural common between both countries.\nCzechoslovakia national football team\nThe Czechoslovakia national football team was the national association football team of Czechoslovakia from 1922 to 1993. At the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the team was participating in UEFA qualifying Group 4 for the 1994 World Cup; it completed this campaign under the name Representation of Czechs and Slovaks (RCS). Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia are recognized by FIFA and UEFA as the successors of the Czechoslovakia team.\nThe Czechoslovakia team was controlled by the Czechoslovak Football Association. The team had two runner-up finishes in World Cups (1934, 1962) and a European Championship win in 1976. Czechoslovakia qualified for the final stages of the 1990 World Cup and shortly afterwards their national coach Jozef Vengloš moved to England to become Aston Villa manager.\nList of matches\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:95%\"\n! width=\"100\" | Matches\n! width=\"100\" | Total\n! width=\"100\" | Czech Republicwins\n! width=\"100\" | Draws\n! width=\"100\" | Slovakiawins\n! width=\"100\" | Goaldifference\n|-\n| All\n| 14\n| 9\n| 2\n| 3\n| 29:12\n|-\n| Competitive\n| 10\n| 7\n| 1\n| 2\n| 21:9\n|-\n| Friendly\n| 4\n| 2\n| 1\n| 1\n| 8:3\n|}\nGames\n|goals1 = Timko\n|team2 =\n|goals2 = Šmejkal\n|stadium = Tehelne pole\n|location = Bratislava\n|attendance = 10,000\n|referee = Leif Sundell (Sweden)\n|format = 1\n}}\n|goals1 = Jančula Majoroš\n|team2 =\n|goals2 = Šmicer\n|stadium = Tehelne pole\n|location = Bratislava\n|attendance = 22,500\n|referee = Piero Ceccarini (Italy)\n|format = 1\n}}\n|goals1 = Šmicer Siegl Novotný\n|team2 =\n|goals2 =\n|stadium = Sparta\n|location = Prague\n|attendance = 5,428\n|referee = Urs Meier (Switzerland)\n|format = 1\n}}\n|goals1 = Koller Rosický\n|team2 =\n|goals2 = Sz.
