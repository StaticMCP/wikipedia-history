It occupies two campuses: The Melbourne Park campus on Upper Elletson Road and the larger North Street (Clovelly Park) campus. Some 1900 students are enrolled. The school is noted for its strong academic and sports tradition. It also boasts a world class boys’ choir, the Kingston College Chapel Choir, that has given concerts across the island and around the world.\nHistory\nKingston College was founded in 1925 by Bishop of Jamaica, Dr. G.F.C. DeCarteret with Bishop Percival Gibson as the first headmaster. The school was envisioned as a remedy for the social deformity in which poor black boys were allowed primary education only. The school, Kingston College, was created primarily to provide poor black boys, who otherwise would not have the opportunity, with a secondary education. The founder was convinced that there was a treasury of untapped talent among the black working and lower middle classes. Kingston College would nurture that talent and so take to another level the uncompleted process of full emancipation that began in 1838. K.C., as the school became known, admitted any boy, black or not, born in wedlock or not, who could satisfy the entrance requirements and pay the affordable fees.\nKingston College began at 114 ¾ East (corner of East St. and North St.). The school was declared open on April 16, 1925, with forty-nine students. Today the school is located at 2A North Street, Kingston. In 1963 the Melbourne Campus (13 Upper Elleston Road, Kingston C.S.O.) was purchased from the Melbourne Cricket Club. The Melbourne Campus is now home to 7th, 8th, 9th Grade (1st, 2nd and 3rd Form).\nThe school's color, purple, was chosen because it is the color worn by Christian Bishops, the color used by the Greeks to honor their Olympic champions and the color of the leading empire in history – Rome. The color purple ties to kings and queens dating back to ancient world, where it was prized for its bold hues and often reserved for the upper crust.\nMotto\nThe school's motto is in Latin: Fortis Cadere Cedere Non Potest, which translates to The Brave May Fall But Never Yield.\nCrest\nThe crest, which bears the colors purple and white, represents the Episcopal colours. Purple was the colour of the Roman Empire and was used by the Greeks to honour their Olympic heroes. The pineapple symbolizes the field of labor and fruitfulness, The dog, the animal of loyalty, fidelity and watchfulness. The book represents the Bible and academics.\nRhodes Scholars\nRhodes Scholars from the college include:\n* John Luce Ramson, 1934\n* L. L.
