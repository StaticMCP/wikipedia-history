The company was mustered into federal service on July 4, 1861, and assigned to 1st Indiana Cavalry Regiment as Company I, but served detached from the Regiment for the entirety of the war in the Eastern theater of the American Civil War. The unit's namesake was for its Captain, Robert R. Stewart of Terre Haute who would later command both the 2nd Indiana Cavalry Regiment and the 11th Indiana Cavalry Regiment.\nThe company served in the Department of West Virginia as an armed escort for Union General William Rosecrans from July to November 1861. The company served at the Headquarters of the Department of Western Virginia in March, 1862; and the Department of the Mountains until June, 1862. The company was attached to the Headquarters of the I Corps of the Army of Virginia in September, 1862. The company was later attached to the Headquarters of the XI Corps of the Army of the Potomac, to September, 1863, and at Headquarters Army of the Potomac to May, 1865. The company participated in all the services of these headquarters. Old members of the company mustered out on July 3, 1864.
