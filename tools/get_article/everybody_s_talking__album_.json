      "text": "# Everybody's Talking (album)\n\n'Everybody's Talking: The Houston Tapes, Volume 1' is a live album by the American folk music group the Kingston Trio, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). The group consisted of Bob Shane, George Grove and Nick Reynolds. Reynolds had left the group in 1967 and returned in 1988.\nReception\n}}\nThe Allmusic critic Zac Johnson was critical of the album, writing that the live performance \"seems clumsy and a little disturbing... and the various jokes about gays and masturbation seem awfully creepy from these guys... and while their humor on their original LPs seems bright and original, in 1989 their onstage banter seems forced, a little mean-spirited, and rarely funny. Unlike seasoned artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, whose journeys through life and show business have added some wisdom and depth to their performances, the Kingston Trio's travels seem to have made them seem more like Vegas comedians performing way off the strip.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Hard Ain't it Hard'\" (Woody Guthrie) – 3:51\n# \"Talk\" – 1:29\n# \"Three Jolly Coachmen\" (Traditional) – 2:18\n# \"Early Morning Rain\" (Gordon Lightfoot) – 3:30\n# \"Talk\" – 1:43\n# \"Greenback Dollar\" (Hoyt Axton, Kennard Ramsey) – 3:01\n# \"Talk\" – 1:50\n# \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (Fred Neil) – 3:06\n# \"Talk\" – :35\n# \"Ah Woe, Ah Me\" (Reynolds, Shane, Stewart) – 2:50\n# \"Talk\" – :30\n#\"M.T.A.\" (Bess Lomax Hawes, Jacqueline Steiner) - 3:16\n# \"Band Introductions\" – 5:15\n# \"Everything\" (A.
