Established in 1998, the awards are funded and regulated by the British Government through the Learning and Skills Council and are awarded to selected students at 21 specialist performing arts institutions.\nOverview\nDance and Drama Awards are offered to selected students, who are commencing training at the 21 specialist vocational schools chosen for the scheme.  Through a process of auditions, the awarding school will identify the most talented students and allocate awards appropriately. The award pays a substantial contribution towards the cost of attending the relevant course and in many cases, also includes a means tested maintenance grant.\nCourses\nThe vocational courses for which the awards are given are specially devised by Trinity College, London and, upon completion, provide a professional level qualification at either Level 5 or Level 6 on the National Qualifications Framework.  Completion of one of these courses gives formal accreditation of the skills, knowledge and understanding that are acquired in training for employment as a professional actor, dancer, performing artist or in production roles supporting performance. Despite the fact that despite the courses being offered as post-16 further education, the qualifications are actually rated at graduate level.\nCourses which are eligible for funding:\nNational Qualifications Framework – Level 5\n*National Certificate in Professional Acting\n*National Certificate in Professional Classical Ballet\nNational Qualifications Framework – Level 6\n*National Diploma in Professional Acting\n*National Diploma in Professional Musical Theatre\n*National Diploma in Professional Dance\n*National Diploma in Professional Production Skills\nSchools\nAll the schools which participate in the Dance & Drama Awards scheme are validated by Trinity College and are inspected for educational standards by OFSTED.
