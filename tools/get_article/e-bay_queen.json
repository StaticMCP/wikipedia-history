It was released in Greece on 30 June 2004 by Undo Records.\nE-Bay Queen is an Electronica album and is comparable in style to The Human League album Dare as it combines contrasting female vocals with early 1980s style analogue synthesizer tracks, and is also heavily influenced by the early works of Depeche Mode. It sold principally in Marsheaux's native Greece when first released but has since been revived by the international interest in Peekaboo and Undo Records are now marketing it towards an international audience.\nThe album contains two full cover versions, an Electronica version of The Lightning Seeds track \"Pure\" which is sung by Marianthi; and Marsheaux's dark version of  Gershon Kingsley's instrumental track Popcorn which received considerable radio play on mainland Europe in 2003 when it was released as a single in advance of the album. In addition, the track \"Όλα Γυρίζουν\" (phonetic translation: \"Ola Gyrizoun\") is a partial cover of \"October Love Song\" by Chris & Cosey - it retains the music, but has new Greek lyrics written by Marsheaux.\nTrack listing\nReferences\n*\n* |title=E-Bay Queen – Marsheaux |work=Allmusic |accessdate=22 June 2011}}\nExternal links\n* http://undorecords.com/"
