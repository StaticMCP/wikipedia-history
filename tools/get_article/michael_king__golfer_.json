As an amateur, he won the Lytham Trophy in 1973, and played in the Walker Cup in 1969 and 1973.\nProfessional career\nKing began a career as a stockbroker, but following the stock market crash of 1974 he became a professional golfer. He spent many years on the European Tour. 1979 was his best season by far: he won his sole European Tour title at the SOS Talisman TPC; was joint runner-up in the Belgian Open; made only appearances in the Ryder Cup and the World Cup; and finished the year in fifth place on the European Tour's Order of Merit. His career was curtailed by ankylosing spondylitis.\nAmateur wins\n*1973 Lytham Trophy\nProfessional wins (1)\nEuropean Tour wins (1)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!Margin ofvictory\n!Runner-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|23 Sep 1979\n|SOS Talisman TPC\n|−7 (71-67-72-71=281)\n|1 stroke\n| Brian Waites\n|}\nResults in major championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1969\n!1970\n!1971\n!1972\n!1973\n!1974\n!1975\n!1976\n!1977\n!1978\n!1979\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|T48\n|CUT\n|T36\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1980\n!1981\n!1982\n!1983\n!1984\n!1985\n!1986\n!1987\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|59\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|}\nNote: King only played in The Open Championship.\nCUT = missed the half-way cut (3rd round cut in 1976, 1984 and 1985 Open Championships)\n\"T\" = tied\nTeam appearances\nAmateur\n*Walker Cup (representing Great Britain & Ireland): 1969, 1973\n*St Andrews Trophy (representing Great Britain & Ireland): 1970 (winners), 1972 (winners)\n*Commonwealth Tournament (representing Great Britain): 1971\n*European Amateur Team Championship (representing England): 1971 (winners), 1973 (winners)\nProfessional\n*Ryder Cup (representing Europe): 1979\n*World Cup (representing England): 1979\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
