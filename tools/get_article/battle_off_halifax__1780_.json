The British privateer Resolution fought the American privateer Viper and heavy casualties were suffered by both sides. The battle was \"one of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering.... a loss of 51 lives in a single battle was virtually unheard of.\"\nBackground\nDuring the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal. A few months before the Battle of Halifax, in December 1779 the schooner Hope wrecked near the Sambro Island Light on the Three Sisters Rocks. Captain Henry Baldwin and six other crew were killed.  Weeks later, 170 British sailors were lost when two vessels - North and St Helena - were wrecked in a storm when entering Halifax harbour.\nBattle\nJust off Sambro Island Light, the American privateer Viper (22 guns, 130 men), under the command of William Williams took the British brig Resolution'' (16 guns) under the command of Captain Thomas Ross of Halifax. In the \"hot engagement\" for 90 minutes, the British had killed 8 and 10 wounded, while the American killed and wounded totalled 33 men. Both vessels were much disabled and the British surrendered.\nAftermath\nAmerican privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war. For example, after a failed attempt to raid Chester, Nova Scotia, American privateers struck again in the Raid on Lunenburg in 1782.\nSee also\n*\n* Military history of Nova Scotia\nReferences"
