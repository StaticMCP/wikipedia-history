They are on the River Great Ouse which provides access to the North Sea via the Lynn Channel and The Wash. They are located  north of Cambridge,  west of Norwich and  north of London on the A1078 Edward Benefer Way.\nThe docks are operated as the '''Port of King's Lynn''' by Associated British Ports.

This built the Alexandra Dock which was completed in 1869 and linked by rail in 1870. By 1876 over 500 ships were using the new dock each year. The larger Bentinck Dock with a length of  was opened in 1883. The port has traditionally relied on exporting agricultural produce for the bulk of its traffic.\nTransport links\nThe docks are on the A1078 road and linked via this and the A148 road through King's Lynn to the main A47 trunk road to the south of the town. This provides links to the A17 and A1 roads to the west. Other main roads connect the port to the M11 motorway and A14 trunk road at Cambridge, providing links to the UK motorway network.\nThe nearest railway station is King's Lynn railway station on the Fen Line which runs between King's Lynn, Ely and Cambridge and provides links to London King's Cross and London Liverpool Street stations. The port had a railway link to this line in the 19th century, the last elements of which were closed in the 1990s.\nSeafarers' welfare\nThe port now has a dedicated centre, set up by the [http://www.apostleshipofthesea.org.uk/ Apostleship of the Sea], for visiting seafarers. The facility offers them a place to relax, and spend some quiet time, with free internet connection for them to use. It was opened on 17 November 2014 by Bishop Alan Hopes, Bishop of East Anglia. The centre is largely-funded by the Merchant Navy Welfare Board and the site on which it was built was provided by Associated British Ports.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.abports.co.uk/Our_Locations/Short_Sea_Ports/Kings_Lynn/ Port of King's Lynn] official website"
