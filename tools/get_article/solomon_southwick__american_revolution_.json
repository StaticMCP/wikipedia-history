He was a prominent Patriot during the American Revolution, and printed some of the first copies of the Declaration of Independence after its adoption in 1776.\nEarly life\nSolomon Southwick was born in Newport in 1731.  At an early age he attracted the attention of Henry Collins, a wealthy merchant and philanthropist, who decided to fund Southwick's college education.  Southwick entered the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1754, as a member of its first graduating class, the Class of 1757.\nHe left the college before its first commencement, but received an honorary Bachelor of Arts degree based on his accomplishments in Mathematics and other technical subjects.\nSouthwick returned to Rhode Island and taught school for several years before beginning a career as a merchant.\nCareer\nIn 1764 Southwick purchased the Newport Mercury from Samuel Hall, the heirs of James Franklin and Ann Smith Franklin, and became the paper's editor and publisher.  He also operated the ''Mercury's'' associated printing business, and was one of the first book publishers in the North American colonies.  He served as a member of the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1776.\nSouthwick became involved with the independence movement in the 1770s and was the official printer of the Rhode Island General Assembly.  Providing an early and well known rallying cry for the movement, Southwick used the Mercury to announce \"Undaunted by tyrants, we'll die or be free!\"\nWhen the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776 Southwick produced printed copies for the Governor of Rhode Island, as well as copies for sale to the public.  His first edition was supposed to be dated July 13, 1776, but was mistakenly dated June 13, which was corrected in subsequent versions.\nWhen the British occupied Newport in 1776, Southwick was a prime target for capture, owing to his high profile activism against the British government.  He quickly suspended publication of the Mercury and fled with his family, remaining in Providence, Rhode Island and Rehoboth, Massachusetts until it was safe to return home.  In 1778 he was appointed Deputy Commissary General, responsible for obtaining and distributing food, clothing and other supplies to Continental Army soldiers in Rhode Island.\nIn 1780 Southwick received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.\nSouthwick later returned to Newport, where he resumed publishing the Mercury and served as Postmaster. In addition to publishing the Mercury, Southwick's printing business included the production of notes that were used as currency by America's fledgling banking industry.\nDeath and burial\nSolomon Southwick died in Newport on December 23, 1797.  He was buried in Newport's Common Burying Ground. His gravestone is inscribed:\nFamily\nSouthwick was married to Ann Gardner Carpenter (1748-1783), the widow of Willett Carpenter and daughter of Lieutenant Governor John Gardner.  They had four sons and a daughter, and their children included Solomon Southwick (1773-1839), a prominent newspaper publisher in Albany, New York and founder of the Anti-Masonic Party.\nLegacy\nSouthwick was the subject of a biography, 2001's Solomon Southwick, 1731-1797: Patriotic Printer of Rhode Island by C. Deirdre Phelps.\nThe press used by Solomon Southwick to print copies of the Declaration of Independence can be seen in the Museum of Newport History.\nThe home Southwick built in 1760, a 13-room colonial, still stands in Newport.  It is a privately owned residence, and its address today is 77 Third Street.\nReferences"
