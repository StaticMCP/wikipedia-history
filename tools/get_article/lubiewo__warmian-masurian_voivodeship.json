It lies approximately  north-west of Mikołajki,  east of Mrągowo, and  east of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nUnlike the neighboring Warmia region, which historically remained largely Catholic, Masuria was primarily Lutheran Protestant after the secularization of the Teutonic Order in 1525, which formed the Duchy of Prussia\nReferences"
