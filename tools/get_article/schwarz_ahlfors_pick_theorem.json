The unit disk U with the Poincaré metric has negative Gaussian curvature −1. In 1938, Lars Ahlfors generalised the lemma to maps from the unit disk to other negatively curved surfaces:\nTheorem (Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick). Let U be the unit disk with Poincaré metric \\rho; let S be a Riemann surface endowed with a Hermitian metric \\sigma whose Gaussian curvature is&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&minus;1; let f:U\\rightarrow S be a holomorphic function. Then\n:\\sigma(f(z_1),f(z_2)) \\leq \\rho(z_1,z_2)\nfor all z_1,z_2 \\in U.\nA generalization of this theorem was proved by Shing-Tung Yau in 1973.\nReferences"
