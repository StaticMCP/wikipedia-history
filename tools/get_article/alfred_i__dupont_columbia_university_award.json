The awards were established in 1942 and administered until 1967 by Washington and Lee University's O. W. Riegel, Curator and Head of the Department of Journalism and Communications.  Since 1968 they have been administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, and are considered by some to be the broadcast equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, another program administered by Columbia University.\nDedicated to upholding the highest journalism standards, the duPont awards inform the public about the contributions news organizations and journalists make to their communities, support journalism education and innovation, and cultivate a collective spirit for the profession.\nThe duPont-Columbia Awards were established by Jessie Ball duPont in memory of her husband Alfred I. du Pont. It is the most well-respected journalism-only award for broadcast journalism; starting in 2009, it began accepting digital submissions. The duPont, along with the George Foster Peabody Awards, rank among the most prestigious awards programs in all electronic media.\nThe duPont-Columbia jury selects the winners from programs that air in the United States between July 1 and June 30 of each year. Award winners receive batons in gold and silver designed by the American architect Louis I. Kahn.  The gold baton, when awarded, is given exclusively in honor of truly outstanding broadcast journalism.\nNotable winners\nIn 2003, the first-ever foreign-language program was awarded a duPont-Columbia Award: CNN en Español and reporter Jorge Gestoso won a Silver Baton for investigative reporting on Argentina's desaparecidos.\nIn 2010, the first award for digital reporting was given to MediaStorm and photographer Jonathan Torgovnik for \"Intended Consequences\" about children born of rape in Rwanda.\nIn 2012, the first-ever theatrically released documentary film was honored by the duPont jury: the Oscar-nominated Hell and Back Again, about the war in Afghanistan and the struggles facing veterans when they return home.\nNote\nAll winners are listed on the website of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\nduPont Award\n1942\n* Fulton Lewis Jr.\n* KGEI Radio, San Francisco\n1943\n* Raymond Gram Swing\n* WLW Radio, Cincinnati\n* WMAZ Radio, Macon, Georgia\n1944\n* H.
