It is managed by the East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust.\nHistory\nThe laying of the foundation stone for the hospital was commemorated when Kenneth Clarke, Minister of Health unveiled a plaque on the site in 1988. The new facility, which was built by Cementation, was intended to consolidate services previously provided by the Eversfield Hospital in St Leonards, and three hospitals in Hastings, the Buchanan Hospital, St Helens Hospital and the Royal East Sussex Hospital. The new hospital was fully available to patients by 1992 and was officially opened by the Princess Royal in February 1993. The Princess Royal also opened the second phase of the hospital in July 1997.\nThe radiology facilities were comprehensively upgraded in 2015.\nSee also\n* Healthcare in Sussex\n* List of hospitals in England\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
