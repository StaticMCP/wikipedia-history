The ceremony was held on 16 May 2015 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, and was later broadcast on ITV1 and STV. The publicly voted categories were announced on 30 March 2015, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Actress and Actor awards. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 27 April 2015. The accolades for Sexiest Female and Male, which were formerly voted for by the public, were axed for this ceremony. This was due to reports of cast members being embarrassed by the accolade.\nBBC soap EastEnders won all three of the viewer-voted categories, including Best British Soap, as well as taking home the most awards of the night, with eight wins. ITV soap Coronation Street won two awards, including the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement, with Anne Kirkbride posthumously winning for her role as Deirdre Barlow. Fellow ITV soap Emmerdale also won two awards, while BBC soap Doctors picked up one award; the Best Newcomer accolade for Jessica Regan's portrayal of Niamh Donoghue. Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks also got one award.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Award\n! Winner\n! Shortlisted\n!
