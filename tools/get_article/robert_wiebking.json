In  1884, Wiebking began working for C. H. Hanson, an engraving company. By 1893 he was in business for himself, cutting type matrices for both the Crescent and Independent Type Foundries. In 1900, with H. H. Hardinge, he formed ‘‘Wiebking, Hardinge & Company’’ which ran the Advance Type Foundry. In 1914 the partnership was dissolved and Advance merged with the Western Type Foundry. After Western Foundry merged into Barnhart Brothers & Spindler, Wiebking  began working once again for himself.  He then designed type and cut matrices for many foundries and, from 1911 to 1926 (with a few exceptions) he cut all of the matrices for Frederic Goudy's designs were cut by Wiebking.  He taught both Goudy and R. Hunter Middleton how to cut matrices.\nTypefaces\nTypefaces designed by Wiebking\n* World Gothic series, a series in name only, as three only marginally similar faces were brought together under one heading as a marketing ploy to compete with  ATF's Globe Gothic.\n** World Gothic (BB&S),  originally Wesel.\n** 'World Gothic Condensed (1897 BB&S), originally Tropic [No. 5].\n** World Gothic Italic (1897 BB&S), originally named  Dewey [No. 5] in honor of Admiral Dewey.\n* Engravers Roman + Bold (1899, BB&S, later ATF.\n* Typo Script (1902, ATF), later known as Tiffany Script.

Hunter Middleton.\n* Steelplate Gothic series a knock-off of Goudy's Copperplate Gothic, they were originally cut for Western Type Foundry under various names, and then renamed when that foundry was bought out by Barnhart Brothers & Spindler.
