In 2006, Edwards made a voice appearance in the Doctor Who episode \"Fear Her\".\nIn September 2008, the BBC Trust ruled that a documentary on Welsh politics presented by Edwards, Wales: Power and the People – Back to the Future, had broken the BBC's editorial guidelines. The documentary covered the Welsh Assembly, with Edwards stating: \"To achieve its full potential it needs even greater support for the people of Wales than it's received so far ... The more people that take part, the stronger and healthier our democracy in Wales will be.\" Following a complaint, the governing body concluded that Edwards' words were not objective and even-handed, saying: \"It is not the role of BBC presenters to encourage audiences to exercise their right to vote on particular occasions.\" It was also found that the documentary as a whole was biased against the Conservative Party.\nIn 2010, Edwards presented The Prince and the Plotter about the investiture of the Prince of Wales and the part played by Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (\"Defence of Wales Movement\"). He received the Best On-Screen Presenter award at the BAFTA Cymru Awards. In February 2012, Edwards launched a historical documentary series made by BBC Wales, The Story of Wales.

He gave a speech in Welsh as he unveiled a mural of a poem by Tudur Hallam, Professor of Welsh at the university and winner of the Chair in the previous year's National Eisteddfod; Edwards called it a moving tribute to his father, who had died in January 2010.\nIn 2003, Edwards was made a Fellow of the University of Wales and in 2007 he became Honorary Professor of Journalism at Cardiff University.

Edwards is also an amateur organist, taught to play at a chapel in Llanelli, and occasionally played at the Jewin Welsh Presbyterian Chapel in Clerkenwell, north London.\nIn 2020, Edwards criticised The Times for printing a story dismissive of the use of the Welsh language. He responded to comments in The Times written by the scientist Michael Pepper in which it was suggested that his late colleague John Meurig Thomas wrote notes in Welsh purely to stop others from reading them; Edwards said that Welsh speakers do not \"use our native language in our daily lives simply to thwart others\". In 2021, he criticised the former journalist Max Hastings for saying that Welsh was of \"marginal value\" and that Wales could not succeed as an independent country because it was \"dependent on English largesse\".\nPersonal life\nIn 1993, Edwards married Vicky Flind, a television producer, whose credits include editing This Week and Peston. They lived in Dulwich, London, and have five children. In July 2024 it was reported that Edwards and Flind had separated some time ago and that Edwards had been living elsewhere.

He led a campaign to save the historic Jewin Presbyterian Church, London's oldest Welsh chapel.\nHe said he has had bouts of clinical depression since 2002.\nSexual misconduct allegations and conviction\nAllegations in The Sun\nOn 7 July 2023, The Sun reported that a well-known BBC presenter had paid a teenager more than £35,000 from when the teenager was 17 years old in return for \"sordid images\". The story was based on allegations by the mother and stepfather of the teenager. A lawyer representing the young person said nothing inappropriate or illegal had taken place, and that the teenager and mother were estranged. On 12 July, Edwards' wife named him as the subject and said that he was receiving hospital treatment for depression.\nShortly before Edwards was named, the Metropolitan Police reported that it had found no evidence of crime and would not investigate further. The Sun stated that it had never alleged criminality on the part of Edwards, which The Guardian described as backtracking. The Sun also said it would cooperate with the BBC's internal investigation and would not publish further allegations. Edwards was provided the results of the BBC's inquiry on or before November 2023 and was not reinstated. In January 2024, he was reported as too unwell to discuss his employment with the BBC. In April, he resigned from the BBC on \"medical advice\". After Edwards' criminal conviction in July 2024, the young person said he believed Edwards had groomed him.\nCriminal conviction\nOn 29 July 2024, the Metropolitan Police stated that Edwards had been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children (i.e. receiving digital copies), the legal definition of which includes actions such as downloading images or receiving them through email or social media, even when unsolicited. The charges involved images allegedly shared in a WhatsApp chat between December 2020 and April 2022, comprising six category A images, 12 category B images and 19 category C images. Two of the category A images \"showed a child aged between about seven and nine\".\nEdwards was sent 377 sexual images, of which 41 were indecent images of children, by Alex Williams, a man from Merthyr Tydfil. On 15 March 2024, Williams received a 12-month suspended sentence after pleading guilty to possessing and distributing category A, B and C images. Edwards was arrested on 8 November 2023, and charged on 26 June 2024 following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service. He pleaded guilty to all of the charges at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 31 July.\nFollowing Edwards' conviction, the BBC began removing his appearances from some of its archive footage. The Doctor Who episode \"Fear Her\", featuring his voice, was removed from BBC iPlayer. The episode was reinstated months later with a replaced voice performance. His voice may be removed from the BBC's coverage of Elizabeth II's funeral and Charles III's coronation. A mural of Edwards in his hometown of Llangennech was painted over, and a plaque honouring him at Cardiff Castle was taken down. Mark Lawson wrote in The Guardian that Edwards' conviction would \"rank as one of the greatest British public plunges from success and celebrity\".\nIn August 2024, the BBC announced that it had asked Edwards to return more than £200,000 of the salary paid after his arrest in November 2023. The Chair of the BBC, Samir Shah, said Edwards had acted in bad faith by continuing to draw his salary. On 16 September 2024, Edwards was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for two years, and placed on the sex offenders' register. He was also ordered to attend a sex offender treatment programme and pay £3,128 in costs and victim surcharge. Edwards' sentence was calculated by Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring based on an initial one year imprisonment. Three months were deducted for mental health reasons and due to Edwards having no previous convictions. A third of the sentence was also deducted due to Edwards' early guilty plea, bringing the sentence down to six months.\nEdwards' defence barrister, Philip Evans, said that his client wished \"to apologise to the court\" and those he had hurt.\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |2003–2023\n|BBC News at Ten\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Presenter\n|-\n|BBC News at Six\n|-\n|BBC News at One\n|-\n|BBC Weekend News\n|-\n|BBC News channel\n|-\n|2006\n|Doctor Who\n|Commentator; Episode: \"Fear Her\"\n|-\n|2011\n|Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|2015 United Kingdom general election coverage\n|Co-presenter and later lead presenter\n|-\n|2016\n|2016 European Union membership referendum coverage\n|Co-presenter of BBC coverage\n|-\n|2018\n|Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|2019 United Kingdom general election coverage\n|Co-presenter and later lead presenter\n|-\n|2021\n|Funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\n|Presenter of BBC coverage\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2022\n|Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II\n|\n|-\n|Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II\n|Presenter of BBC coverage\n|-\n|Wales: Who Do We Think We Are? with Huw Edwards\n|Presenter\n|-\n|2023\n|Coronation of Charles III and Camilla\n|Presenter of BBC coverage\n|}\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|2012\n|Skyfall\n|Himself\n|Cameo\n|}\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
