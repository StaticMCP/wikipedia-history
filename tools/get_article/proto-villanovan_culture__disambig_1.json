The similarity, in particular, has been noted with the regional groups of Bavaria-Upper Austria and of the middle-Danube. Furthermore, the Proto-Villanovan culture shows affinities with both the Lusatian and Canegrate cultures. Another hypothesis, however, is that it was a derivation from the previous Terramare culture of the Po Valley. The burial characteristics relate the Proto-Villanovan culture to the Central European Urnfield culture and Celtic Hallstatt culture that succeeded it. It is not possible to tell these apart in their earlier stages. Various authors, such as Marija Gimbutas, associated this culture with the arrival, or the spread, of the proto-Italics into the Italian peninsula.\nProto-Villanovan sites are present all over the Italian peninsula, mostly in the northern-central part but also, to a lesser degree, in Southern Italy and eastern Sicily. Among the most important of these sites are: Frattesina (Veneto), Bismantova and Ripa Calbana (Emilia-Romagna), Cetona and Saturnia (Tuscany), Monti della Tolfa (Lazio), Pianello di Genga and Ancona (Marche), Ortucchio (Abruzzo), Timmari (Basilicata), Canosa (Apulia), Tropea (Calabria), and Milazzo (Sicily).\nSettlements, usually of small dimensions, were generally built on hills and circumscribed with fortifications. The economy was mostly based on agro-pastoral activities, metallurgy, and trades.\nSociety\nBurial rites\nThe proto-Villanovans practiced cremation. The ashes were placed in Urnfield-style double-cone shaped funerary urns, often decorated with geometric designs, and then buried in the ground. Elite graves containing jewelry, bronze armor, and horse harness fittings were separated from ordinary graves, showing for the first time the development of a highly hierarchical society, so characteristic of Indo-European cultures.\nRegionalization\nAfter a period of considerable uniformity from north to south, the Proto-Villanovan culture shows a process of regionalization. Starting from , new regional cultures such as the Villanovan culture, Este culture, and Latial culture appeared. Although these new cultures shared many similarities with the preceding Proto-Villanovan culture, especially funerary customs, they also exhibited their own innovations.\nGenetics\nA genetic study published in Science in November 2019 examined the remains of a female from the Proto-Villanovan culture buried in Martinsicuro, Italy, between ca. 930 BC and 839 BC, in the territory of the Picentes. She carried the maternal haplogroup U5a2b.\nSee also\n* Villanovan culture\n* Latial culture\n* Este culture\nReferences\nSources\n* }}"
