In existence from 1980 until 1994 the award was presented to a former player who, more than likely, would have received an All Star had the awards scheme been in existence during their playing days.\nList of winners\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Year\n!County\n!Winner\n!Era\n!width=50%|Rationale\n|-\n|align=center|1980\n|border Limerick\n|\n|1930–1947\n|A two-time All-Ireland-winning captain, his honours include three All-Ireland medals, five consecutive National Hurling League medals and five Munster medals.\n|-\n|align=center|1981\n|border Cork\n|\n|1936–1950\n|Regarded as the greatest midfielder of his time, he won a record five All-Ireland medals, six Munster medals and three National League medals.\n|-\n|align=center|1982\n|border Limerickborder Dublin\n|\n|1921–1936\n|One of the brilliant hurlers of his era, he had the distinction of winning All-Ireland and National League medals with two counties and Railway Cup medals with two provinces.\n|-\n|align=center|1983\n|border Clareborder Dublin\n|Pa 'Fowler' McInerney\n|1913–1933\n|In a twenty-year inter-county career that spanned three decades, he won All-Ireland medals with Clare and Dublin.\n|-\n|align=center|1984\n|border Kilkenny\n|\n|1938–1954\n|One of the great Kilkenny players of his era, he won two All-Ireland medals and seven Leinster medals.\n|-\n|align=center|1985\n|border Cork\n|\n|1919–1931\n|\n|-\n|align=center|1986\n|border Tipperary\n|Tommy Doyle\n|1937–1953\n|\n|-\n|align=center|1987\n|border Waterford\n|\n|1935–1949\n|\n|-\n|align=center|1988\n|border Cork\n|Paddy 'Fox' Collins\n|1929–1938\n|\n|-\n|align=center|1989\n|border Galway\n|M.
