It flows thorough many temporary and permanent waterholes through the journey including Rope Hole.\nThe Carron has five tributaries including Rocky Creek, Foote Creek, Tabletop Creek, Ten Mile Creek and Telephone Creek.\nThe traditional owners of the area to the north of the Carron are the Walangama people and to the south are the Kurtjar people. The river is named after William Carron, second in command of the Edmund Kennedy expedition in 1848. Carron was the expedition botanist and one of the three survivors of the venture.\nIn 1872 the Carron and Norman Rivers were all in full flood with  of rain falling over the course of two days. Severe flooding was also experienced in 2011.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences"
