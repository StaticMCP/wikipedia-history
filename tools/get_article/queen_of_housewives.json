It depicts the life of \"naejo,\" housewives who devote their entire lives to their husbands' success, but with a more comedic and aggressive twist. It aired on MBC from March 16 to May 19, 2009 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes.\nThe hit drama topped the ratings chart during its run, and created new trends among married women in terms of fashion and makeup. Actress Kim Nam-joo received numerous accolades for her acting comeback after an 8-year hiatus, and the series also served as the breakout vehicle of actor Yoon Sang-hyun.\nPlot\nChun Ji-ae (Kim Nam-joo) had it all... in high school. Pretty and popular, she was the school's queen bee, while awkward Yang Bong-soon (Lee Hye-young) was the exact opposite. The two were initially friends, until Ji-ae stole Bong-soon's crush, Han Joon-hyuk (Choi Cheol-ho). Fast-forward to middle-aged married life, and their roles have become reversed. Ji-ae struggles with household finances because she married Ohn Dal-soo (Oh Ji-ho), a once-promising university graduate turned unemployed pushover, while Joon-hyuk, whom Bong-soon married after Ji-ae dumped him, is now a successful executive.\nDal-soo finally gets a shot at a decent job at top company Queen's Food, where Joon-hyuk happens to be his new boss. Joon-hyuk still carries a torch for Ji-ae, and he makes it a point to make Dal-soo's internship as difficult and demeaning as possible. Meanwhile, determined to help her smart but clueless husband climb the corporate ladder, Ji-ae joins a social wives club to support him. The wives' power plays are directly correlative to their husbands' positions in the company (meaning, the higher-ranking the husband, the higher-ranking the wife), and Ji-ae sets aside her pride to curry favor and jockey for position. She immediately thrives within the wives' inner circle, but she's constantly thwarted by her ex-best friend, Bong-soon.\nThen Dal-soo runs into his college friend Eun So-hyun (Sunwoo Sun), wife of Heo Tae-joon (Yoon Sang-hyun), the current president of Queen's Food. Stuck in a loveless marriage, So-hyun wants to have an affair with Dal-soo, while indolent chaebol Tae-joon gradually finds himself attracted to Ji-ae. The three couples interact in a confusing mix of romance, friendship, and workplace politics.\nCast\nMain characters\n* Kim Nam-joo as Chun Ji-ae\n* Oh Ji-ho as Oh Dal-soo\n* Lee Hye-young as Yang Bong-soon\n* Yoon Sang-hyun as Heo Tae-joon\n* Choi Cheol-ho as Han Joon-hyuk\n* Sunwoo Sun as Eun So-hyun\n* Kim Chang-wan as Kim Hong-shik\n* Na Young-hee as Jang Young-sook\nSupporting characters\n;Ji-ae and Bong-soon's high school classmates\n* Park Joo-hee as Go Mi-young\n* Lee Seung-ah as Kim Young-sun\n* Jung Soo-young as Ji Hwa-ja\n* Kim Do-yeon as Ahn Jung-sook\n;Queen's Food husbands and wives\n* Kim Yong-hee as Ha-chang\n* Choi Ye-jin as Hwang-sook (Ha-chang's wife)\n* Kim Jung-hak as Department chief Yang\n* Hwang Hyo-eun as Lee Seul (chief Yang's wife)\n* Hwang Jae-hee as Gong Young-min (HR manager's nephew)\n* Joo Min-ha as Jung Go-woon (Young-min's wife, art gallery assistant)\n* Lee Mae-ri as Jung-ran\n;Extended cast\n* Kang Soo-han as Han Hyuk-chan (Bong-soon and Joon-hyuk's son)\n* Kim Sung-kyum as President Heo (Tae-joon's father)\n* Yu Ji-in as Tae-joon's mother\n* Kim Young-ran as Ji-ae's mother\n* Baek Seung-hee as Hyang-suk\n* Kim Ik-tae as jeweller\n* Min Joon-hyun as Ohn Dal-soo's co-worker\n* Lee Seung-ho\n* Kim Seung-woo as police officer (cameo, ep 3)\n* Shindong as couple in sauna (cameo, ep 11)\n* Kim Shin-young as couple in sauna (cameo, ep 11)\n* Kim Sung-min as Tae-joon's friend (cameo, ep 16)\n* Jun Jin as job applicant (cameo, ep 20)\n* Yoo Jae-suk as job applicant (cameo, ep 20)\n* Park Myung-soo as job applicant (cameo, ep 20)\n* Jung Hyung-don as job applicant (cameo, ep 20)\nRatings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=100 | Date\n! width=100 | Episode\n! width=100 | Nationwide\n! width=100 | Seoul\n|- align=center\n| 2009-03-16 || 1 || 8.0% || 8.7%\n|- align=center\n| 2009-03-17 || 2 || 10.3%  (13th) || 10.7% (13th)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-03-23 || 3 || 9.6% (15th) || 10.1% (15th)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-03-24 || 4 || 11.2% (12th) || 11.8% (12th)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-03-30 || 5 || 11.5% (11th) || 11.8% (12th)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-03-31 || 6 || 12.0% (10th) || 11.6% (10th)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-04-06 || 7 || 20.0% (2nd) || 20.7% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2008-04-07 || 8 || 21.3% (2nd) || 22.0% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-04-13 || 9 || 21.6% (2nd) || 22.2% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-04-14 || 10 || 24.1% (2nd) || 25.6% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-04-20 || 11 || 24.2% (2nd) || 24.9% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-04-21 || 12 || 24.4% (2nd) || 25.6% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-04-27 || 13 || 25.2% (2nd) || 26.5% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-04-28 || 14 || 27.4% (2nd) || 29.3% (2nd)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-05-04 || 15 || 26.6% (1st) || 28.4% (1st)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-05-05 || 16 || 29.2% (1st) || 31.1% (1st)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-05-11 || 17 || 30.4% (1st) || 32.2% (1st)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-05-12 || 18 || 30.0% (1st) || 31.8% (1st)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-05-18 || 19 || 29.9% (1st) || 31.7% (1st)\n|- align=center\n| 2009-05-19 || 20 || 31.7% (1st) || 33.7% (1st)\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=2 | Average || 21.4% || 22.5%\n|}\nSource: [https://web.archive.org/web/20100125065320/http://www.tnsmk.co.kr/ TNS Media Korea]\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
