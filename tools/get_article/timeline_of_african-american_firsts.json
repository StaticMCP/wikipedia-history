The first achievements by African Americans in diverse fields have historically marked footholds, often leading to more widespread cultural change. The shorthand phrase for this is \"breaking the color barrier\".\nOne prominent example is Jackie Robinson, who became  the first African American of the modern era to become a Major League Baseball player in 1947, ending 60 years of racial segregation within the Negro leagues.\n{|id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\" summary=\"Contents\"\n!\n|-\n| |\n17th century: 1670s\n18th century: 1730s–1770s • 1780s–1790s\n19th century: 1800s • 1810s • 1820s • 1830s • 1840s • 1850s • 1860s • 1870s • 1880s • 1890s\n20th century: 1900s • 1910s • 1920s • 1930s • 1940s • 1950s • 1960s • 1970s • 1980s • 1990s\n21st century: 2000s • 2010s • 2020s\nSee also • Notes • References • External links\n__NOTOC__\n|}\n16th century\n1500s\n1528\n* Estevanico becomes the first black person to explore what would become the continental United States in the Narváez expedition.\n1539\n* Estevanico becomes the first black person and first non-Native American person to explore New Mexico.\n17th century\n1600s\n1604\n* First black person to arrive in what is now Maine: explorer and interpreter Mathieu Da Costa\n1624\n* First African American who was born in the British colonies that later became the United States: William Tucker (Virginia colony)\n1650\n* First African American to own land in the United States July 24, 1651: Anthony Johnson (colonist)\n1670s\n1670\n* First African American to own land in Boston: Zipporah Potter Atkins\n18th century\n1730s–1770s\n1738\n* First free African-American community: Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose (later named Fort Mose) in Spanish Florida\n1746\n* First known African American (and slave) to compose a work of literature: Lucy Terry with her poem \"Bars Fight\", composed in 1746 and first published in 1855 in Josiah Holland's History of Western Massachusetts.\n1760\n* First known African-American published author: Jupiter Hammon (poem \"An Evening Thought: Salvation by Christ with Penitential Cries\", published as a broadside)\n1767\n* First African-American clockmaker, Peter Hill, was born.\n1768\n* First known African American to be elected to public office: Wentworth Cheswill, town constable and justice of the peace in Newmarket, New Hampshire.\n1773\n* First known African-American woman to publish a book: Phillis Wheatley (Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral)\n* First separate African-American church: Silver Bluff Baptist Church, Aiken County, South Carolina\n1775\n* First African American to join the Freemasons: Prince Hall\n1778\n* First African-American U.S. military regiment: the 1st Rhode Island Regiment\n1780s–1790s\n]]\n]]\n1783\n* First African American to formally practice medicine: James Derham, who did not hold an M.D. degree.
