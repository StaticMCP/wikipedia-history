After taking the chapel of San Alonso, Chagas headed for the Mission of San Carlos, where the independentist forces led by Andresito and Serapio Rodriguez awaited the invading forces.\nAfter days of very intense fighting, the Luso-Brazilians managed to control most of the town and push Andresito's men to San Carlos' church and college, in which heavy fighting continued to occur, while they expected for reinforcements to come. However, the column of Captain Arand that had the objective of helping the rebels was attacked by the invading army and crushed, having its commander been killed. On the third day of battle, the buildings in which the rebels were caught fire, making their situation even more desperate and forcing them into submission, even though some men, including Andresito himself, managed to escape.\nThe battle resulted not only in a major victory for the Luso-Brazilians, but also to the de facto elimination of Andresito's threat to them.\nReferences"
