The Filipinos were under the command of General Nicolas Capistrano.\nThe surprise dawn attack was foiled when one of the lumad (ethnic minority) warriors shouted a battle cry as he killed an American sentry that aroused the American soldiers. The fighting was centered on the town plaza (now Gaston Park) where the American barracks were located.\nGeneral Capistrano, foreseeing imminent defeat, ordered the retreat of his men. The Americans pursued General Capistrano and his men to the edge of the town.\nSee also\n* Battle of Makahambus Hill\n* Cagayan de Oro\nReferences"
