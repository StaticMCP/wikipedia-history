She was built to the draught of  designed by Sir Edward Hunt, though with a modified armament.\nHistory\nIn 1794 Queen Charlotte was the flagship of Admiral Lord Howe at the Battle of the Glorious First of June, and in 1795 under Captain Andrew Snape Douglas she took part in the Battle of Groix.\nQueen Charlotte was used as the 'Parliament Ship' (mutineer flagship) during the 1797 Spithead Mutiny. Valentine Joyce, an experienced sailor of the Queen Charlotte's crew, was the most prominent leader of the mutiny. In 1798, some of the Queen Charlotte's crew were court-martialed for involvement in a separate, much smaller mutiny.\nFate\nAt about 6&nbsp;am on 17 March 1800, whilst operating as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, Queen Charlotte was reconnoitring the island of Capraia, in the Tuscan Archipelago, when she caught fire. Keith was not aboard at the time and observed the disaster from the shore.\nThe fire was believed to have resulted from someone having accidentally thrown loose hay on a match tub. Two or three American vessels lying at anchor off Leghorn were able to render assistance, losing several men in the effort as the vessel's guns, which were loaded, cooked off in the heat. Captain A. Tod wrote several accounts of the disaster that he gave to sailors to give to the Admiralty should they survive. He himself perished with his ship. The crew was unable to extinguish the flames and at about 11&nbsp;am the ship blew up with the loss of 673 officers and men.\nSee also\n* Lord Howe on the Deck of the Queen Charlotte, 1794 painting by Mather Brown\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090923202900/http://www.memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk/others/excellent/charlotte.htm Memorials and Monuments in Portsmouth] (retrieved 27 September 2007)."
