At the eastern end of the interchange, I-78 enters toll barriers, crosses Interstate 95 and becomes the Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike. The eastern terminus of U.S. Route 22 and the southern terminus of Route 21 are both at the interchange. U.S. Route 1-9 passes through the interchange as well. The interchange provides access to Newark Liberty International Airport.\nHistory\nThe Newark Interchange is a complex interchange in northeastern New Jersey that opened to the public on January 15, 1952. At the opening of the turnpike, the interchange provided access to the airport via U.S. Route 1-9. In 1956, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (operator of Newark Airport) and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority announced a $9 million improvement project to construct graded interchanges that would offer direct access to the airport. After the completion of Interstate 78 through the Newark area in the 1970s, it became part of the interchange complex.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://njfreeways.com/NJI-78NewarkBayExtentionPictures.html/ NJ Freeways.com]\n*[http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000001__-.pdf U.S. Route 1] Straight Line Diagram from the New Jersey Department of Transportation\n*[http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000021__-.pdf New Jersey Route 21] Straight Line Diagram from the New Jersey Department of Transportation\n*[http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000022__-.pdf U.S. Route 22] Straight Line Diagram from the New Jersey Department of Transportation\n*[http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000078__-.pdf Interstate 78 in New Jersey] Straight Line Diagram from the New Jersey Department of Transportation"
