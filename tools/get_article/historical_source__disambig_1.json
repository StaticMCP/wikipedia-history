In a secondary source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information.\nTertiary source\nA tertiary source is an index or textual consolidation of already published primary and secondary sources that does not provide additional interpretations or analysis of the sources.  Some tertiary sources can be used as an aid to find key (seminal) sources, key terms, general common knowledge and established mainstream science on a topic. The exact definition of tertiary varies by academic field.\nSee also\n* Historical document\n* Archive\nExternal links\n* [https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/prospective-undergrads/virtual-classroom/historical-sources-what What are Historical Sources? - University of Cambridge Faculty of History]\nReferences\n__NOTOC__"
