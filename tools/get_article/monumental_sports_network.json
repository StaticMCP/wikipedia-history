Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the channel broadcasts regional coverage of sports events throughout the Mid-Atlantic, with a focus on professional sports teams based in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., as well as sports news and entertainment programming.\nMonumental Sports Network is available on approximately 25 cable television providers throughout Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, as well as parts of Delaware, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and West Virginia; it is also available nationwide on satellite television via DirecTV. The channel reaches more than 4.7 million households in the Mid-Atlantic region.\nHistory\nJohn Kerry being interviewed by the network before a Capitals game at the Verizon Center February 6, 2014.]]\nbeing interviewed during a Capitals game April 15, 2010]]\nThe network was launched as Home Team Sports (HTS) on April 4, 1984. Originally owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, it was one of the first regional sports networks in the United States with rights to the Washington Bullets, Washington Capitals, and Baltimore Orioles. (each teams' road games were shown over the air on independent station WDCA-TV (channel 20, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate). In 1988, the network affiliated with SportsChannel, picking up their NHL package. In 1989, HTS additionally became an affiliate of the Prime Sports Network.\nIn 1996, the network was folded into CBS Cable, a cable television division formed through Westinghouse Electric Corporation's merger with CBS. In February 1997, Home Team Sports became an affiliate of Fox Sports Networks, a group of regional sports networks formed the previous year through News Corporation's partial acquisition of Prime through a joint venture with that network's parent Liberty Media. In 1996, Fox/Liberty had tried to secure rights to the Bullets, Capitals, and Orioles, which would have led to the launch of a new RSN. Fox/Liberty originally outbid HTS but previous contracts gave HTS the right of first refusal. Fox/Liberty filed a lawsuit against HTS which ultimately was settled. News Corporation subsequently purchased a 34% ownership interest in HTS. CBS Corporation, which remained majority owner, eventually merged into Viacom in 1999, in a deal worth $91 billion.\nShortly after Viacom completed its merger with CBS, on June 10, 2000, Viacom announced that it would sell Home Team Sports and Minneapolis-based regional sports network Midwest Sports Channel. One month later, on July 11, Comcast agreed to acquire a 75% ownership stake in HTS and the Midwest Sports Channel from CBS, in a deal worth approximately $150 million. News Corporation, which wanted to acquire full ownership of both networks, filed a lawsuit ten days later on July 21 in an attempt to block the sale of MSC and Home Team Sports.\nOn September 7, 2000, as part of a settlement between the two companies, Comcast traded its equity interest in Midwest Sports Channel to News Corporation in exchange for sole ownership of Home Team Sports. The transaction was completed seven months later in mid-February 2001. The channel was relaunched as Comcast SportsNet (CSN) Mid-Atlantic on April 4, 2001, exactly seventeen years after the network's original launch. The channel continued to carry national programming supplied by Fox Sports Net after the sale.\nIn 2010, Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic split its website into two regional websites, and rebranded them as \"Comcast SportsNet Baltimore\" and \"Comcast SportsNet Washington\". While the websites were rebranded, the network continued to maintain a singular feed that was transmitted throughout its entire coverage area. Five years later, CSN Mid-Atlantic consolidated the two regional websites back together again as CSNMidAtlantic.com.\nIn September 2012, Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic and its sister Comcast SportsNet outlets ceased carrying Fox Sports Networks–supplied programming, after failing to reach an agreement to continue carrying FSN's nationally distributed programs.\nIn October 2016, CSN Mid-Atlantic announced that it would extend its broadcast rights to the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards through a long-term deal with the teams' owner, Ted Leonsis. As a result, Monumental Sports & Entertainment took an equity stake in the network, while NBCUniversal took an equity stake in the Monumental Sports Network—an over-the-top subscription service focusing on other teams owned by the company.\nComcast rebranded the network as NBC Sports Washington on October 2, 2017, as part of a larger rebranding of the Comcast SportsNet networks under the NBC Sports brand.\nOn August 23, 2022, Monumental announced it would acquire full control of the network from Comcast for an undisclosed price. The sale was completed on September 20, 2022. On June 21, 2023, it was announced that NBC Sports Washington would rebrand as Monumental Sports Network. The name change took effect on September 12, and formally launched on September 20, 2023. The network also moved its headquarters from Bethesda, Maryland to Washington, D.C.\nProgramming\nLive game coverage\nMonumental Sports Network televises more than 500 live professional and collegiate sporting events per year. The network holds the exclusive regional cable television rights to the NHL's Washington Capitals and the NBA's Washington Wizards—airing all games that are not nationally exclusive—as well as the Washington Mystics of the WNBA. The network formerly held the television rights to the Virginia Destroyers of the United Football League, broadcasting the team's games from 2011 until the UFL folded in 2012. D.C. United previously had its games televised by CSN Mid-Atlantic from the team's first season in 1996 until 2015. after which the team signed a multi-year deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group–owned WJLA-TV and WJLA 24/7 News. The network then aired games again from 2020 until 2022 after which those games moved to Apple TV+.\nThe network also serves as the official cable partner of the NFL's Washington Commanders, holding the rights to televise the team's preseason games; until the consummation of the 2012 merger between NBC and Comcast, which placed Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic and NBC owned-and-operated station WRC-TV (channel 4) under common ownership, games broadcast on WRC-TV were transmitted in 480i standard-definition television to provide high-definition television exclusivity for the regional network. After the merger, both WRC and CSN Mid-Atlantic carry Commanders games in HD.\nThe network also airs a variety of collegiate events from George Washington University and the University of Richmond. The network is also the television home of Towson University football, volleyball, and basketball games. Prior to joining the Sun Belt Conference, which does not allow member schools to have local third tier rights for most sports, James Madison University football and basketball aired on the network.\nNews and entertainment programming\nMonumental Sports Network produces news, analysis, opinion, and entertainment programs focusing the region's sports landscape.
