Bates later said: \"When Manson and I began to speak again about making a new album, I told him 'If we're doing this again, we're gonna make a completely different record [from The Pale Emperor]. You gotta bring the fire! We gotta fuck some shit up!'. He was, of course, all in for it.\" The song was composed by Bates just several hours before the pair's first recording session, with Bates calling it a \"a great starter for the album. I knew that track was the initial seed that I wanted to plant for him to work from.\"\nIt is reminiscent of material released by the band in the late '90s, and features subdued, predominantly electronic verses coupled with a chorus consisting of loud, aggressive guitar riffs and the eponymous vocalists' screamed vocals. Nerdist Industries called the song \"fiercely rocking and in-your-face\". Manson said that he was \"astonished that a record label put [the song] out as the first single\", due to its lyrical content, which reference political corruption, drone warfare and global surveillance. The track was debuted live during the first date of the Heaven Upside Down Tour, which occurred on July 20 in Budapest.\nRelease and promotion\nPrior to its release, the song was advertised with a series of fly poster campaigns at various music festivals throughout Europe, including the Reading and Leeds Festivals. These campaigns were financed by Loma Vista Recordings. The song premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show on September 11, immediately after which it was made available via streaming platforms.\nMusic video\nThe music video for the song was directed by Bill Yukich and Perou, and was posted onto YouTube on September 15. The clip opens with a parental advisory warning for graphic violence and sexual content, and begins with a quintet of nuns walking down a suburban street during a solar eclipse. The nuns tear off their habits, revealing them to be wearing latex undergarments and leather dominatrix gear, and carrying various handguns, assault rifles and rocket launchers. The group then encounters Manson and, after an initial standoff, proceed to blow up a van. The group then invades the home of a family, and subjects the husband and wife to a violent sexual assault. Sydney Gore of The Fader has hypothesized that the video is a metaphor for religious extremism.\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Heaven Upside Down.\nCredits\n* Recorded at Abattoir Studios, Studio City, California\n* Songs of Golgotha (BMI)/Box Cutter Music.
