The Toad toolset runs against Oracle, SQL Server, IBM DB2 (LUW & z/OS), SAP and MySQL. A Toad product for data preparation supports many data platforms.\nHistory\nA practicing Oracle DBA, Jim McDaniel, designed Toad for his own use in the mid-1990s. He called it Tool for Oracle Application Developers, shortened to \"TOAD\". McDaniel initially distributed the tool as shareware and later online as freeware.\nQuest Software acquired TOAD in October 1998.

In June 2016, Dell announced the sale of their software division, including the Quest business, to Francisco Partners and Elliott Management Corporation. On October 31, 2016, the sale was finalized. On November 1, 2016, the sale of Dell Software to Francisco Partners and Elliott Management was completed, and the company re-launched as Quest Software.\nFeatures\n* Connection Manager - Allow users to connect natively to the vendor’s database whether on-premise or DBaaS.\n* Browser - Allow users to browse all the different database/schema objects and their properties effective management.\n* Editor - A way to create and maintain scripts and database code with debugging and integration with source control.\n* Unit Testing (Oracle) - Ensures code is functionally tested before it is released into production.\n* Static code review (Oracle) - Ensures code meets required quality level using a rules-based system.\n* SQL Optimization - Provides developers with a way to tune and optimize SQL statements and database code without relying on a DBA.
