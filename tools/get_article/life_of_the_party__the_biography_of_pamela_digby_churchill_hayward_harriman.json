Kirkus Reviews stated \"That may or may not have influenced his perspective when he decided to write the story anyway\".\nOgden had, over a period of several months, collected about forty hours of interview footage.\nOgden was a correspondent for Time.\nContent\nThere are nineteen chapters, with most of them each being named after a male figure with significance in the biography.\nKirkus stated that the author had a negative view of her romantic ties, and according to Kirkus this was not primarily about any promiscuity but instead about allowing her partners to give her support.\nReception\nKirkus Reviews stated that \" This is fun to read as the names drop, but it offers more titillation than insight into\" the subject.\nPublishers Weekly stated that the book is \"captivating, gossipy, withering\".\nReferences"
