This war was a continuation and escalation of the civil war in Palestine, the wider conflict being known as the 1948 Palestine War. The decision of the Arab League to invade was not taken lightly, as Arab leaders had previously rejected several invasion plans. In public Arab leaders stated that a unitary state would be the only solution and that their army would destroy Israel. Behind closed doors however, many Arab leaders understood that partition would be the most likely solution to the conflict and that their armies were not strong enough to destroy Israel by force. The decision to intervene was made despite the fact that many of the Arab leaders, including the prime ministers, foreign ministers and senior military commanders of Egypt, Iraq and Syria, as well as King Abdallah and King Ibn Saud, did not want war. However, factors including the deteriorating situation in Palestine and public opinion at home ultimately drove the Arabs to war. The final decision was made on April 30th 1948, after the Jewish Agency launched Plan Dalet, an offensive into Palestine which saw the destruction of many Palestinian villages and massacres of Palestinian civilians. Even then, Azzam Pasha, the secretary general of the Arab league, was still engaged in truce talks, with the hope that an invasion could be deterred.\nThe Arab countries could be divided into two factions: the countries lead by the Hashemite royal family, Iraq and Jordan, and an anti-Hashemite faction consisting of Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia. For the Hashemite faction, intervention in Palestine would mean restoring the Greater Syria project, even if the troops only conquered the West Bank. The King of Jordan, King Abdallah, was in secret contact with the Jewish Agency before the war, though the extent to whether or not there existed a secret pact between Tel Aviv and Amman is contested by historians. In any case, the anti-Hashemite faction feared a Tel-Aviv-Amman axis, and believed that a Palestinian state in between those two powers would check the power of both sides, even if that meant allowing a Jewish state in Palestine. While Egypt and Saudi Arabia were against intervention, they ultimately agreed to intervene to prevent a partition of Palestine by the Zionists and Jordan.\nOverview Individuals Involved\n* David Ben Gurion : First Prime Minister of Israel and president of the Jewish Agency Executive\n* Chaim Weizmann : First President of Israel and president of the World Zionist Organization\n* Eliyahu Sasson : Head of the Arab Department of the Jewish Agency, member of the Transfer Committee\n* Ezra Danin : Head of the Arab section of the Shai, the intelligence of the Haganah, another member of the Transfer Committee\n* King Farouk : King of Egypt\n* Ali Maher : Prime Minister of Egypt (1936, 1939-1940)\n* Ibrahim Abdel Hady Pasha : Prime Minister of Egypt (1948-1949) and chief of the Royal cabinet in 1948\n* Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha : Prime Minister of Egypt (1946 - 1948)\nTimeline\nin 1919]]\nCompeting Ambitions for Palestine\nIn 1917, the British government publicly supported a 'national home for the Jewish people\" \"in Palestine\" in what is now known as the Balfour Declaration, in what was seen as a victory for Zionists. Crucially, the terms \"national home\" and \"in Palestine\" were vague, as they did not necessarily imply a Jewish state in all of Palestine. At maximum, it could refer to a Jewish state in all of Palestine; at minimum, it could refer to a Jewish autonomous zone within Palestine. The dispute over the wording of Balfour plagued negotiations over how any solution could implement Balfour.\nIn 1919, the Zionist Organization submitted a memorandum where they defined their territorial goals as all of Palestine, around 18,000 square km east of the Jordan River, and 45,000 square km including 'northern Galilee', referring the land including the Golan Heights, and what is now Lebanese territory south of the Litani River up to Sidon. They also proposed taking Egyptian territory up to El-Arish, as Herzl had previously wished, but left it up for further talks. The British could not offer Lebanese or Syrian territory, as this violated the Sykos-Picot agreement with France. Furthermore, Britain had rejected a Zionist state on Egyptian land previously in the late 1800s. When the League of Nations approved the creation of Trans-Jordan as separate from the Mandate of Palestine, Zionists were opposed to what they viewed as 'partition', viewing Palestine only as \"western Eretz-Israel\".\nAnother major player was the Hashemite dynasty. The Hashemites envisioned a greater Arab kingdom under their domain, including the Levant (meaning Syria and Palestine) as well as Iraq and Jordan. What exactly was promised and agreed upon to King Faisal is a matter of debate, specifically whether the McMahon–Hussein correspondence included Palestine. Faisal and Weizmann had a brief agreement in 1919 for the conditional implementation of Balfour, but Faisal did not agree to an independent Jewish state in Palestine, but a Palestine within his Greater Syria. Faisal would later be kicked out of Syria by the French and become the king of Iraq, while his brother Abdullah I became the emir of Jordan. The Hashemites would continue to fight for greater control over Palestine and Syria throughout this period.\nFor the locals in Palestine, the situation was quite different. Palestine was 90% non-Jewish; its inhabitants identified as Palestinians and had resisted Zionism since the late Ottoman period. After World War I, the King Crane commission found that an independent Greater Syria was the most popular opinion by Palestinians. Palestinians had not identified as 'south Syrians' before World War I, instead identifying Palestine and Syria as separate nations; it was only concern for Palestine that led many Palestinian leaders to support a Greater Syria to resist foreign powers. The Greater Syria program was endorsed by the first Arab Palestine Congress; the second congress envisioned an independent Palestinian state within a Greater Syria, the third dropped calls for unification with Syria but later unification was not ruled out. By the fourth congress in 1921, the Syria plan was dropped entirely, from here on out the goal of Palestinian nationalists was an independent Palestine with no Jewish national home.\n1936-1938 Revolt\nBy 1936, the Jewish population was 400,000 - around half of the Arab population. In the middle of the 1930's, a massive rebellion and strike in Palestine shook the Arab world. This was the first large scale rebellion by local Arabs in a decade since the post-war revolts of the 1920's. Their demands were for a total end of Jewish immigration into Palestine, a ban of all sales of Arab land to Jews, an independent Palestine and the end of the Mandate. The reason the Palestinian nationalists opposed Jewish immigration was to prevent a demographic change that would in effect hand Palestine over to the Zionsits. In a speech to the Jewish Agency, David Ben-Gurion announced that:Peace for us is a means and not an end. The goal is realisation of Zionism, full and complete . . .only after complete disillusion on the part of the Arabs, despair will come not only from failure of the riots and the attempted rebellion, but despair which will follow our growth in the country, will it be possible for the Arabs to accept a Hebrew Palestine.In a conversation between Ben Gurion and George Antonius, Antonius suggested a plan: a united Greater Syria with a Jewish home in Palestine. Ben Gurion agreed to a limitation on territory but not immigration. He then laid out his borders for a Jewish national home which included Jordan; in his view: \"Is the Jordan the border of Palestine? It is the river of Palestine.\"\nOne major contention was putting limits on Jewish immigration, which Ben-Gurion found unacceptable. In 1936, Musa Alami met with Jewish leaders to negotiate terms, planning for Jewish immigration at 30 thousand a year for ten years, a limit on Jewish land purchases and a Legislative Council. In London, Ben-Gurion rejected this deal, arguing that any immigration limit below the 1935 level was unacceptable. These talks fell through; the Zionists sabotaged negotiations by leaking them to the public. Ben Gurion took one step further by rejecting any immigration plan that prevented an eventual Jewish majority.\nThe rebellion, which quickly spread all throughout Palestine despite brutal British reprisals, forcing the British to publish the Peel Commission, for the first time admitting that the Mandate was unworkable. The report proposed a division the territory as:\n# A Jewish state along the coast, the northern valleys, and the Galilee of around 5,000 square km.\n# The rest of Palestine to be annexed by Trans-Jordan, with no plans for an independent Palestinian state\n# A British mandate of a number of cities from Jaffa to Jerusalem\n# Transfer of land and population between the two states.\nDespite being their first offer for a explicit Jewish state, the Jewish Agency was divided on whether or not to accept the report, since it only included 10% of their 1919 demands. Ben Gurion lead the wing in favor of the plan, not as a permanent solution, but as a stepping stone for their fulfillment of their total aspirations. In his view, the plan was “not the lesser of evils but a political conquest and historical opportunity, unprecedented since the destruction of the Temple. I see in the realization of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most powerful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”  Instead of partition as a permanent compromise, Ben-Gurion believed that “after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine\". At the meeting of the Zionist Congress in the August of 1937, everyone in the Zionist movement accepted that they had a right to settle on both sides of the Jordan river, while a majority allowed for further negotiations of partition as a stepping stone to their goal.\nPalestine and the Arab World (1936-1944)\nThe 1936-1939 rebellion in Palestine forced the nearby Arab states to adopt a foreign policy for Palestine. Palestine's largest neighbor, Egypt, had previously fought Herzl to prevent a Jewish state in Sinai. While the Muslim Brotherhood, a conservative Sunni Muslim organization founded in 1928, organized funds and men for the rebellion, governments in Cairo tended to be non-involved. Instead, the government tried to moderate public sentiment at home, while raising the issue of Palestine to the UK. In fact, one of the first examples of a collective Arab policy on Palestine was their attempt to stop the Arab general strike.\nIn 1938, two individuals entered negotiations, Nuri Said from Iraq and Abdul Shahbandar from Syria. Their plans were for an Arab confederation, with an Arab government in all of Palestine with equal rights for a Jewish minority, and opening all neighboring countries for Jewish immigration. However, Shahbandar wanted a Greater Syria - Syria plus Palestine and Jordan - while Said wanted a Greater Iraq. Nuri met with four leaders in the Arab Higher Committee, including Jamal Husseini and Amin al Husseini, imploring them to step the rebellion and allow himself and Shahbandar to negotiate in London before the Woodhead Commission, with hope that British support for partition was wavering. The Mufti refused to the end the rebellion, and later refused to accept the 1939 White Paper and \"would not agree to one more Jew entering Palestine.\"\nEgypt, under the premiership of Mohammed Mahmoud, played a large role in organizing the Arab side at the St James Conference. Ali Maher, representing Egypt, gave a speech where he said that he \"appreciated and respected the Zionist ideal\" but that they should \"recognize realities, and particularly the fact of the existing inhabitants of Palestine\", imploring them to accept either an end or limit for Jewish immigration to Palestine. During the Conference, the Arabs rejected British offers due to their demands for a federal, rather than united, Palestine, as well as the fact that Britain refused to guarantee an independent Palestine within ten years. Egypt lead a moderating role, supporting a Palestinian state with Jewish autonomy. Despite being disappointed in the 1939 White Paper, Egypt and Iraq pressured Palestinian officials against rejecting it. The White Paper called for:\n# A Jewish national home within an independent Palestinian state within ten years, rejecting turning Palestine into a Jewish state\n# Limiting Jewish immigration at 75,000 for five years with any further immigration being determined by the Arabs\n# Jewish restriction on buying land\nOf all the delegates at the meetings, it was the Arab states that were most influential; the serious negotiations were carried out between Britain and the Arab state after Britain was assured that the Zionists and Palestinians would not rebel. While the Mufti rejected the plan, Musa Alami and Jamal Husseini accepted its terms and signed a copy in the presence of Nuri Said.\nFormation of the Arab League (1944-1946)\nAfter World War Two, the British Empire was left in a dire state. The British had spent vast amount of resources fighting the Axis and was left with an economy in recession by 1945. During the war, Britain signed secret agreements with Egyptian and Syrian leaders to support the British war effort. In 1944, Irgun - a revisionist Zionist paramilitary , ignited a rebellion against British forces in Palestine. Joined with Lehi, these groups believed in the immediate removal of British control, in order to oversee unrestricted Jewish immigration to Palestine, as well as a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan river. By 1946, Britain was looking to settle the Palestine question.\nIn the British perspective, their main enemy in the region was the Soviet Union. They had previously invaded Iran together in 1942, yet the USSR refused to withdraw in 1946, leading to an international crisis. The USSR also rejected the Montreux Convention, arguing for a Soviet base on the Istanbul straits.\nThe UK submits Palestine to the UN (goes over the events in UN until September 1947 and the situation in Egypt and Syria)\nArab reaction to Partition\nReferences\nSources\nPrimary Sources:\nhttps://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1948v05p2/d210\nJournal Articles\nBooks"
