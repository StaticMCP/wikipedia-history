Lord Iveagh is a member of the Guinness family.\nBiography\nAn Anglo-Irish aristocrat, Iveagh is the son of Benjamin Guinness, 3rd Earl of Iveagh and his wife, Miranda Smiley, and is known to his family and friends as Edward, or Ned, Iveagh.\nBecoming Earl of Iveagh on his father's death on 18 June 1992, when he was aged 23, he was then one of the youngest hereditary peers entitled to sit in the House of Lords, which he regularly attended. He did not join a political party but sat as a crossbencher. On 11 November 1999, he was among the majority of the hereditary members who were removed from the Lords by the House of Lords Act 1999.\nOn 27 October 2001, Lord Iveagh married the interior designer Clare Hazell at St Andrew's and St Patrick's Church, Elveden, Suffolk. The couple have two sons, including Arthur, Viscount Elveden (born 2002). They subsequently divorced.\nIveagh lives on the  Elveden Estate in Suffolk, England, which comprises some 2.6% of the county. The land is occupied as a single arable farm for growing root vegetables, with cereals as a break crop. Approximately  is woodland.\nIn 1999, Iveagh sold his family's Irish home, Farmleigh and its park, adjacent to the Phoenix Park in Dublin, to the Irish Government for the market price of €29.2m (£18.9m).\nArms\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/nature/elveden_estate/index.shtml A Year in the Life of a Country Estate] &ndash; A series of 12 articles about Elveden from the BBC, dating from 2003."
