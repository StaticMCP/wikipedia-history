The military unit specializes in creating mobile and web-based software solutions. BESPIN is associated with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. The organization operates out of Maxwell Air Force Base’s Gunter Annex, providing software solutions to support Air Force operations.  They have worked with the city of Montgomery, Alabama, maintaining a downtown office contracted with the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce.\nHistory\nBESPIN was established in late 2019 as the third software factory within the United States Air Force. It was created following the establishment of other software factories, including Kessel Run. In 2020, Dr. William Roper, the Secretary of the Air Force at that time, allocated $21 million in initial funding to support the factory.\nPartnerships\nAs part of Air Force Material Command, BESPIN engages in collaborations with various government agencies to advance software development and address shared technical challenges. This includes working Air Education and Training Command with applications such as Digital University.\nReferences\n:Category:Articles under construction"
