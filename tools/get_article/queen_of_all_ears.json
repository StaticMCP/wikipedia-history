The band supported the album with an international tour.\nProduction\nThe album was produced by John Lurie and Pat Dillett. The tracks were written by Lurie, with bass player Erik Sanko cowriting two. Jane Scarpantoni played cello on Queen of All Ears; in total, nine musicians played on the album.\nReleased on Lurie's own label, it was originally intended for Luaka Bop; legal issues delayed the release for two years. Lurie considered writing a book about the ordeal, to be titled ''What Do You Know About Music? You're Not a Lawyer''. The account was told in Lurie's memoir The History of Bones (2021), in which he also apologized to David Tronzo, because a song intended as a showcase for Tronzo was cut from the album and thus the guitarist did not perform a solo on the recording.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = Robert Christgau\n|rev2score =\n|rev4 = MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide\n|rev4score =\n}}\nJazzTimes wrote that \"the music relies heavily on group improvisation in the highly colored riffs and patterns that form the basis of most of the proceedings.\" Esquire determined that Lurie's \"alto and soprano saxophoning has become something rather nice: plaintive, searching, Colemanesque, quite at home (soaring) in the upper registers.\" The Boston Globe opined that \"New York's fringe-crawlers mature with impressionistic etchings of chamber jazz and world music.\"\nThe Guardian stated that \"the Lounge Lizards roll from moments of prayer-like intensity—Coltranesque flourishes over African pulsing—to Charles Mingus doing the music for scary Czech cartoons, to blasting Dragnet rumbles.\" The Chicago Tribune opined that the album \"embarks on an Amer-Euro-Afro fake jazz cruise brimming with trans-global eclecticism, defanged Mingus/Monk moves and sometimes striking instrumental explosions.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"John Lurie's so-called 'non-jazz' approach is in full flower on this fascinating record.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed by John Lurie; except where noted.\nPersonnel\n;Lounge Lizards\n*John Lurie – tenor and alto saxophone\n*Michael Blake – tenor saxophone, bass clarinet\n*Steven Bernstein – trumpet\n*David Tronzo – slide guitar\n*Erik Sanko – bass\n*Evan Lurie – piano, organ\n*Calvin Weston – drums\n*Ben Perowsky – percussion\n*Jane Scarpantoni – cello\nReferences"
