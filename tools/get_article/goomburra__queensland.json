It is the valley of Dalrymple Creek which flows from east to west away from the Great Dividing Range towards Allora. The creek eventually becomes a tributary of the Condamine River, part of the Murray-Darling river system. Although there is mountainous terrain within the locality with elevations ranging from  above sea level, there is only one named peak, Masters Knob () which rises to  above sea level.\nThe town is located in the south-west of the locality, while Inverramsay is a neighbourhood near the south-eastern boundary of the locality around the Inverramsay Homestead.\nThe main route through the locality from south-west (Berat) to north-east (East Haldon) is Goomburra Road, becoming Inverramsay Road, Forestry Reserve Road, and Lookout Road.\nGoomburra railway station is an abandoned railway station just west of the town.

Apart from the protected area, the land use is a mix of crop growing (mostly on the lower elevations near Dalrymple Creek), grazing on native vegetation (mostly on the higher elevations), and some rural residential housing.\nHistory\nThe town's name came from the name of a pastoral run operated by pastoralist Patrick Leslie from 1840 to 1841. It is an Aboriginal word which is either a corruption of gooneburra meaning fire black tribe, or which means a shield derived from the kurrajong tree.\nGoomburra State School opened on 25 April 1881.

The relocation of the church required two traction engines and took ten days to negotiate difficult terrain and other problems.\nInverramsay State School opened on 2 February 1914 and closed on 22 August 1965. It was at 1194 Inverramsay Road ().\nOn 31 December 1919 in the public hall, Littleton Groom (the member for Darling Downs) unveiled the town's honour board, listing the 32 names of those who had performed military service in World War I including 10 who died in the war.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Goomburra had a population of 259 people.\nIn the , the locality of Goomburra had a population of 256 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Goomburra.
