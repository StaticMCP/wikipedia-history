In March 1742, he succeeded his uncle Richard Freeman in the Batsford estates and assumed the additional name of Freeman. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 3 February 1744, aged 17. He married Elizabeth Reveley, daughter of Henry Reveley of Newby Wisk, Yorkshire on 23 July 1753.\nPolitical career\nAt the  1768 general election, Edwards Freeman was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Steyning on the interest of Sir John Honywood, 3rd Baronet to whom he was distantly related.
