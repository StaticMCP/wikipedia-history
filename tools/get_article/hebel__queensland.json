It is the eastern corner of the locality.\nThe Bokhara River (a non-perennial river) enters the locality from the east (Dirranbandi) and flows past the immediate north of the town and exits the locality to the south (Goodooga in New South Wales). It is part of the Murray-Darling River system.\nIn the west of the locality is the Culgoa River and the Culgoa Floodplain National Park (), which extends into neighbouring Jobs Gate.\nThere are a number of homesteads in the locality:\n* Balgi ()\n* Ballandool ()\n* Byra ()\n* Currawillinghi ()\n* Davirton ()\n* Goonaroo ()\n* Kinglebilla ()\n* Koala ()\n* Morley ()\n* Tara ()\n* Yattenbury ()\nHistory\nYuwaalaraay (also known as Yuwalyai, Euahlayi, Yuwaaliyaay, Gamilaraay, Kamilaroi, Yuwaaliyaayi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuwaalaraay country.

It is closely related to the Gamilaraay and Yuwaalaraay languages. The Yuwaalayaay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Balonne, including the town of Dirranbandi as well as the border town of Goodooga extending to Walgett and the Narran Lakes in New South Wales.\nThe town was reputedly named after a German immigrant Noble Van Hebel. Hebel helped stage the coaches for Cobb and Co.\nCurriwillinghi Post Office opened on 1 January 1864 (named after the Curriwillinghi pastoral station, which still exists as at 2020 at ).\nCirca 1886, Hebel was established as a border township with a border customs post,   east of Curriwillinghi pastoral station. In 1889, the Curriwillinghi Post Office was replaced by the Hebel Post Office.\nIn 1897 a dance hall was built. It is now the general store.\nHebel Provisional School opened on 11 April 1901. On 1 January 1909, it became Hebel State School.\nThe Hebel Post office closed in 1989.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the Queensland border was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some border crossing points had Queensland Police checkpoints to confirm eligibility to enter Queensland, while other border crossing points were closed. At Hebel, there was a police border checkpoint on the Castlereagh Highway. The border crossing on the Hebel Goodooga Road was closed by the Balonne Shire Council building an earth wall across the road, although many local people doubted its effectiveness as a barrier to entry.\nHebel was the feature of ABC Back Roads Series 8, Episode 11; it was aired on 25 July 2022.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Hebel and the surrounding area had a population of 149 people.\nIn the , the locality of Hebel had a population of 67 people.\nIn the , the locality of Hebel had a population of 62 people.\nEducation\nHebel State School is a government primary (Preparatory to Year 6) school for boys and girls in Maud Street ().
