The ground's first Test saw South Africa played the touring England cricket team. It hosted its first One Day International (ODI) in 1992 following the readmission of South Africa to international cricket after the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era, and its first Twenty20 International (T20I) in 2007. Two women's Test matches have been played on the ground, the first in 1960, and a single women's T20I was played in 2016.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\nThe first international five-wicket hauls taken on the ground was by Englishman Alec Kennedy who took five wickets for the cost of 88 runs (5/88) in the ground's first Test match in 1923. The 8/69 taken by South African Hugh Tayfield against England in 1957 set a new best bowling analysis by a South African in Test matches and remain the best innings bowling figures in Test matches on the ground. The first five-wicket haul in women's Tests on the ground was taken by South Africa's Jean McNaughton in the first women's Test played on the ground in 1960.\nThe first five-wicket haul in an ODI on the ground was taken by Pakistan's Waqar Younis in 1993, whilst India's Ashish Nehra recorded the best bowling ODI figures of 6/23 during a 2003 Cricket World Cup match against England. Only one five-wicket haul has been taken in a T20I on the ground, David Wiese of South Africa taking 5/23 in 2015.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Symbol\n!
