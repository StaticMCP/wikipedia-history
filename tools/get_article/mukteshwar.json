It sits high in the Kumaon Hills at an altitude of 2171 meters (7500&nbsp;feet), 51&nbsp;km from Nainital, 72&nbsp;km from Haldwani, and 343&nbsp;km from Delhi.\nPlaces of interest\nMukteshwar Shiva temple\nMukteshwar gets its name from a 350-year-old temple of Shiva, known as Mukteshwar Dham, situated atop the highest point in the town, on the veterinary institute's campus. Close to it lie the overhanging cliffs, locally known as Chauli-ki-Jali, used for rock climbing and rappelling, with an excellent view of the valleys below. Mukteshwar is famous for its breezy waterfalls such as The Bhalu Ghaad, Tarikhet waterfalls, Rudradhari waterfall and Dhokaney waterfall.  The sunrise point is at the government-run PWD guest house. Another tourist attraction is the small Satoli Village, situated just 21&nbsp;km from Mukteshwar. One can also visit the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI).\nOther\nSome of the edifices of this town are the IVRI laboratories (experiments on tiny rats, gold-plated books, cattle-sheds), orchards of the Central Institutes of Temperate Horticulture-Regional Station, an expansive deodar forest (Himalayan cedar) measuring 15 square miles, 22 pristine snow-peak views, and the adventure of living among wildlife such as tigers and bears are. The charm of visiting Mukteshwar lies in enjoying nature, listening to air gushing through deodar forests, bird watching, meditation, and seeking peace. The cleanliness, solitude, and nature attract people escaping urban life.\nMukteshwar is also home to a post office founded in 1905 which finds mention in Jim Corbett's writing.\nHistory\nMukteshwar was previously known as Muktesar (as mentioned in Jim Corbett's book \"The Temple Tiger\"); the name changed after 1947. Many locals still call it Muktesar in their native language. Until 1893 the place was known for its shrines and temple before it was selected for serum production to protect animals from cattle plague. On the recommendation of the Cattle Plague Commission, the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory had its genesis on 9 December 1889 at Pune and relocated to Mukteshwar in 1893 to facilitate segregation and quarantine of highly contagious organisms. Initially the laboratory at Mukteshwar was completed in 1898 but destroyed by fire in 1899. It was resurrected in 1901. Then annual expenditure on research was Rs. 50,000. Later it was developed into the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), which later moved its headquarters to Izatnagar. Still Mukteshwar serves as the hill campus of IVRI, including facilities such as an experimental goat farm.\nThe Nobel winner scientist Robert Koch visited this place on the request of the government of India. The microscope used by him and other historical articles are kept in the museum maintained by IVRI. A hill carved cold room dating back to 1900 once used to store biological materials is now a tourist attraction.\nJim Corbett, author and hunter of man-eating tigers and leopards visited Mukteshwar. He wrote about Mukteshwar in his book The Temple Tiger and More Man-Eaters of Kumaon. He wrote about the various adversities faced by the people inhabiting the villages in remote areas of the Northern hills.\nRock climbing & rappelling\nFruit orchards, coniferous forests, lush green trails and narrow lanes make Mukteshwar a special destination for trekking. Apart from trekking, camping, paragliding; Mukteshwar is also known for rock climbing and rappelling. The region is full of hard rocky hills, which are suitable for rock climbing. Exotic travelers visit here to experience these activities. Rocky hills of Mukteshwar are quite strong. However, this adventure sport may be a little risky in the rainy days. Popular trails in Mukteshwar include:\n* Peora to Almora\n* Peora to Mukteshwar,\n* Arta Trek from Binsar\nGeography\n}}\nMukteshwar is located at . It has an average elevation of 2,171&nbsp;metres (7,500&nbsp;feet). Mukteshwar is situated in Nainital district at a distance of 51&nbsp;km from Nainital, the district's administrative headquarter and 72&nbsp;km from Haldwani, the largest city in Nainital.\nMukteshwar's scenery includes views of the Indian Himalayas and India's second-highest peak, Nanda Devi. Because of the hilly topography, agriculture in the area consists chiefly of potato fields and fruit orchards on terraces cut into the hillsides.\nClimate\nMukteshwar has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification Cwb). The pattern of seasons is similar to that in other parts of northern India, with distinct summer, monsoon and winter seasons. However, due to its high elevation, Mukteshwar is spared the intense heat of lower-lying towns and cities. Mukteshwar has cold winters and relatively cool summer with drastically escalated rain, in relation with lower altitudes, and frequent fog. Summers are warm with moderate rainfall, while the monsoon season is slightly cooler and features much heavier rain. Winters can be quite cool, and temperatures below freezing are not unusual. Snowfall occurs occasionally in December and January, though it is sparse, while the heavy rainfall events occurs during the monsoon season stretching from July to September.\n}}\nKumaon Vani radio service\nWith the aim to create a common platform for local communities of Supi in Uttarakhand, TERI launched 'Kumaon Vani', a community radio service on 11 March 2010. Uttarakhand governor Margaret Alva inaugurated the radio station, the first in the state. The 'Kumaon Vani' aims to air programmes on environment, agriculture, culture, weather and education in the local language and with the active participation of the communities. The station covers a radius of 10&nbsp;km reaching out to almost 2000 locals around Mukteshwar.\nNew development\nThere is a 'Renewable Park' developed by TERI.  The renewable park uses solar electricity for most of its electricity needs. Recently, the town has experienced some construction activity and townships have begun to mushroom in and around Mukteshwar. Many people are buying holiday homes here to escape larger cities.\nTransport\nThe nearest airport is at Pantnagar and the nearest railway head is at Kathgodam, 65&nbsp;km from the town, from where vehicular transport is easily available for neighbouring towns of Bhimtal, Bhowali, Haldwani and Nainital.\nThe other means of road transport in the city include Share taxis, regionally known as Jeeps, on-call metered taxis and tourist taxis. The state transportation bus service is available from Nainital.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://traveltear.com/magical-mukteshwar-breathing-the-mountain-goodness/1255/ Magical Mukteshwar – Breathing The Mountain Goodness]"
