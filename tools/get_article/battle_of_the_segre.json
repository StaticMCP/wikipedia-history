During most of 1938 there would be numerous attacks, counterattacks and skirmishes from both sides along the Segre River. A great number of manpower and material was sent to the Eastern Army of the newly created Eastern Region Army Group in that front. The Spanish republic was able to hold unto that line until the beginning of January 1939 when it became impossible to keep holding the resistance in the Segre against the overwhelming pressure of the rebels.\nPhotographer Robert Capa took pictures of the Spanish Republican Navy Marines of the 151 Brigada Mixta who fought in this battle.\nSee also\n*Balaguer Offensive\n*List of Spanish Nationalist military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\n*List of Spanish Republican military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\nReferences"
