The Virginia Democratic primary was an open primary, and was competitive for the first time since 1988.  Barack Obama won the primary, as he did the other Potomac contests that day.\nCandidates\nSix national candidates appeared on the ballot in the Virginia primary. However, all but Obama and Hillary Clinton had withdrawn prior to the primary on February 12.\nRemaining\n*New York Senator Hillary Clinton\n*Illinois Senator Barack Obama\nEliminated\n*Former North Carolina Senator John Edwards Dropped out on January 30, 2008\n*Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich Dropped out on January 25, 2008\n*New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson Dropped out on January 10, 2008\n*Delaware Senator Joe Biden Dropped out on January 3, 2008\nBackground\nThe prior week, Barack Obama had beaten Hillary Clinton in Nebraska (68%-32%), in Washington (68%-31%)  and in Louisiana (57%-36%)  by large margins.\nThe Clinton Campaign looked towards the primary in Virginia as well as those in Maryland and Washington, D.C. which were held on the same day. Though Hillary Clinton spent more resources in the Maryland Primary, she also campaigned in Virginia, particularly in Northern Virginia.\nStrategy\nThe Barack Obama campaign divided Virginia into 4 regions in which to campaign: Northern Virginia, Richmond, Charlottesville, and the Tidewater region in the southeast.  He was expected to do well with affluent and independent voters, as well as with African-American voters, who could total 25% of the vote on primary day.\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign said it would focus its efforts on Prince William and Loudoun counties, especially older white professional women, and also in the unemployment plagued Southwest Virginia.\nPolling\nBarack Obama had a significant lead over Hillary Clinton in final polling throughout the state.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Final Polling\n|-\n!
