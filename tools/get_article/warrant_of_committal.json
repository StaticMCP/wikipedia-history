If the person served with the order fails to obey  it, the judgment creditor may issue either a claim form or application notice seeking committal (for contempt of court) for the offender.\nThe claim form or application notice must identify the breach of injunction which has taken place, and be supported by an affidavit (served with it) stating the grounds for the committal application.\nA warrant of committal may not be enforced more than two years after the date it was issued, without further order from the court. The court may dispense with service of the judgment, order, claim form or application notice if it deems it fair to do so. If the committal order has been made in the absence of the respondent, without being served on him, the judge may fix a date and time when the person to be committed is to be brought before him or the court.\nProcedure\n# Clerk prepares the document (Warrant of Committal)\n# Clerk separates and distributes document\nTrend in Canada\nFederal Warrant of Committal admissions in Canada have increased about 25% between 1989/90 and 1993/94, with approximately 1,000 offenders per year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.ag.gov.bc.ca/courts/manuals/fcm/3chapter/warrant_witness.htm"
