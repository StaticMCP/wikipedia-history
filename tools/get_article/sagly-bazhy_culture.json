It is the last stage of the Uyuk culture.\nThis period of Scythian culture covers a period from the 5th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE, and follows the Arzhan culture (8th century BCE), and the Aldy-Bel culture (7th-6th century BCE) in the same location. These Scythian cultures would ultimately be replaced by the Xiongnu Empire and the Kokel Culture.\nNearby Saka cultures were the Tagar Culture of the Minusinsk Basin, as well as the Pazyryk Culture (ca. 500–200 BCE) in the Altai Mountains and the Saka culture (ca. 900–200 BCE), to which the Sagly-Bazy culture was strongly related. To the east was the Slab-grave culture.\nThe Sagly-Bazhy culture stopped to exist in the 2nd century BCE as a result of Xiongnu invasions.\nGenetics\nIn 2019, a genetic study of remains from the Sagly-Bazhy culture was published in Human Genetics. The 5 male samples were found to be carriers of the East Eurasian haplogroups Q-L54.\nSignificant genetic differences were found between the Eastern Scythians and the Western Scythians of the Pontic steppe. The two groups appear to have been of completely different paternal origins, with almost no paternal gene flow between them. On the other hand, there is strong evidence of shared maternal DNA between Scythian cultures, indicating maternal geneflow from East Eurasia to West Eurasia.\nFile:Animal style artifact Sagly-Bazhi II (Tuva).jpg|Animal style artifact Sagly-Bazhi II (Tuva).\nFile:Bone arrowheads of Chandmani-Sagil culture, Western Mongolia.jpg|Bone arrowheads of the Chandmani culture, Western Mongolia\nFile:Bronze daggers of Chandmani-Sagil.jpg|Bronze daggers of the Chandmani culture, Western Mongolia.\nFile:Bronze mirrors Chandmani-Sagil culture, Western Mongolia.jpg|Bronze mirrors, Chandmani culture, Western Mongolia\nReferences\nSources\n*"
