He worked as a midwife and later offered courses at his home in Aldemanbury Postern, charging 3 guineas a student. Still later moved to Finsbury Square and worked for a while as a midwifery lecturer at St. Bartholomew's Hospital but a conversion to homeopathy in 1834 led to his being asked to leave work. He also worked as physician at the City Lying-in hospital, London Female Penitentiary, the London Orphan Asylum, the Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill Dispensary.\nMany physicians considered him indecent and his style of writing sickly and he did not become a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. After retirement, he died senile at his home on Shooter's Hill. Translations of his book were made into several languages including German, Urdu, Telugu, Tamil, and Kannada through Surgeon Edward Green Balfour in 1874.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://history.rcplondon.ac.uk/inspiring-physicians/john-tricker-conquest Royal College of Physicians]\n* [https://archive.org/details/b30796118 Outlines of Midwifery] (1820) [https://archive.org/details/outlinesofmidwif00conq (1831, 5th edition)] [https://archive.org/details/outlinwif00conq (Urdu translation, 1852)] [https://archive.org/details/grundrissdergebu00conq (German translation, 1834)]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/b24748754 Letters to a Mother on the Management of Herself and her Children in Health and Disease] (1850, 3rd edition)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ChEDAAAAQAAJ What is Homoeopathy?: And is There Any, and what Amount Of, Truth in It?] (1859)\n* [https://archive.org/details/b22282981 Tricker's talk at the Hunterian Society, February 11, 1830 on Puerperal Infection]"
