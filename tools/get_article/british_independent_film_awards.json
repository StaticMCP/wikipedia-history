Nominations for the annual awards ceremony are announced in early November, with the ceremony itself taking place in early December.\nSince 2015, BIFA has also hosted UK-wide talent development and film screening programmes, with the support of Creative Skillset and the  British Film Institute.\nHistory\nThe British Independent Film Awards (BIFA) were created in 1998 by Elliot Grove and Suzanne Ballantyne of the Raindance Film Festival, with the aim of celebrating merit and achievement in independently funded British filmmaking, honouring new talent and promoting British films and filmmaking to a wider public audience. BIFA founding members include Phillip Alberstat, Chris Auty, André Burgess, Sally Caplan, Pippa Cross, Christopher Fowler, Lora Fox Gamble, Steven Gaydos, Norma Heyman, Emma E. Hickox, Fred Hogge, Robert Jones, Steve Kenis, Alberto Lopez, Ollie Madden, Hamish McAlpine, Neil McCartney, Saul Metzstein, Martin Myers, Sarah Radclyffe, Tracey Scoffield, Mark Shivas, Jim Wilson, and Michiyo Yoshizaki.\nThe first BIFA ceremony took place on 29 October 1998. Winners included Ken Loach (for My Name is Joe), Shane Meadows (for Twentyfour Seven) and Ray Winstone (for Nil by Mouth). The Special Jury Prize was awarded to Nik Powell, and the Best British Independent Film award went to My Name is Joe.\nCeremony\nThe BIFA ceremony takes place in early December every year and is one of the first dates in the annual awards season. Most of the awards categories are for British independent feature films only, though there are awards for Best International Independent Film and Best British Short Film. There are also several honorary awards, such as the Special Jury Prize, the Richard Harris Award and the Variety Award. Awarded since 2013, the trophy has been a sculpture by Fredrikson Stallard for Swarovski.\nAward categories\nCurrent categories\n* Best British Independent Film\n* Best Director\n* Best Screenplay\n* Best Lead Performance\n* Best Supporting Performance\n* Best Joint Lead Performance\n* Best Ensemble Performance\n* Breakthrough Performance\n* Best Documentary\n* Best British Short Film\n* Best International Independent Film\n* Best Casting\n* Best Cinematography\n* Best Costume Design\n* Best Editing\n* Best Effects\n* Best Make-Up & Hair Design\n* Best Original Music\n* Best Music Supervision\n* Best Production Design\n* Best Sound\n* The Douglas Hickox Award (Best Debut Director)\n* Best Debut Director – Feature Documentary\n* Best Debut Screenwriter\n* Breakthrough Producer\n* The Raindance Maverick Award\n* The Richard Harris Award (hon)\n* The Variety Award (hon)\n* The Special Jury Prize (hon)\nDiscontinued categories\n* Achievement in Production (1998–2014)\n* Producer of the Year (1999–2002, 2015)\n* Best Technical Achievement (2001–2016)\n* Best Actor (1998–2021)\n* Best Actress (1998–2021)\n* Best Supporting Actor (2008–2021)\n* Best Supporting Actress (2008–2021)\nEntry criteria\nBIFA entries close in late August / early September.\nMain categories (British feature films):\n* Films must be over 70 minutes in length.\n* Films must have had a public screening to a paying audience, either on general release in the UK or at a British film festival or at one of BIFA's recognised international festivals.\n* Must be produced or majority co-produced by a British production company, or be in receipt of at least 51% of its budget from British source(s) and have sufficient British creative elements (e.g. Director, Writer, Producer, other cast & crew).\n* Where there is a major studio substantially funding a film, the total budget must not exceed $20 million.\nBest International Independent Film:\n* Films must have had a theatrical release in the UK within BIFA's eligibility dates for the given year, or have won an award at one of BIFA's recognised international film festivals.\nVoting process\nBIFA has a large pool of voters that consists of past BIFA winners and nominees, top British film industry professionals and experienced filmmakers from all areas of production. Although the pool is continually growing, fewer than 200 voters vote for the nominations in any one year.\nAll entered films must be seen by a minimum number of voters and discussed at a voter meeting before being marked as having been given fair consideration. Once all entered films have been given fair consideration, votes are cast privately in two rounds: once to reduce all entries to long lists of around 15 films in each category, and again to reduce the long lists to the 5 final nominees. In calculating the results, BIFA takes into account the number of voters who have seen each film as well as how many voted for it.\nThe winners in most categories are decided by independent juries, newly–appointed each year. Juries meet to discuss all nominations before voting confidentially for the winner. Exceptions include the honorary awards and the award for Best British Independent Film, the winner of which is decided by a confidential vote amongst all BIFA voters.\nYear-round activity\nSince 2015, BIFA has also hosted UK–wide talent development and film screening programmes with the support of Creative Skillset and the BFI.\nBIFA Insider\nRunning from September 2015 to June 2016, BIFA Insider gave UK–based university and film school students the chance to watch award-winning British films for free online and participate in live-streamed Q&As with top craftspeople who worked on those films.\nSessions included The Lobster with production designer Jaqueline Abrahams, The Selfish Giant with casting director Amy Hubbard and Frank with composer Stephen Rennicks.\nBIFA Presents\nBIFA Presents is an ongoing project wherein BIFA supports the theatrical distribution of award-nominated and -winning films with special preview and event screenings.
