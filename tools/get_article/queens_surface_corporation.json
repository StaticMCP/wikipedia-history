      "text": "# Queens Surface Corporation\n\nQueens Surface Corporation was a bus company in New York City, United States, operating local service in Queens and the Bronx and express service between Queens and Manhattan until February 27, 2005, when the MTA Bus Company took over the operations and renamed its facility to the College Point Depot. The company was known for its orange paint scheme, used since the company's inception in the late 1930s.\nQueens Surface Corporation was privately held by the Gordon and Burke families. The Queens Surface Corporation facility was located at 128-15 28th Avenue in the College Point neighborhood of Queens.\nHistory\n. Now a Pizza Hut franchise.]]\nNew York and Queens County Railway\nThe New York and Queens County Railway (NY&QC) became the largest trolley line in Queens in 1896, through the consolidation of four previous streetcar operators: Flushing and College Point Electric Railway, Long Island City and Newtown Railway, Newtown Railway, and the original Steinway Railway Company. It served Long Island City, Woodside, Astoria, North Beach, College Point, Jamaica, and even the Queensboro Bridge. Between 1903 and 1922, the NY&QC became an affiliate of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. On June 24, 1930, the Woodside Car barn was hit with a massive fire that destroyed much of their fleet, along with the fleet of their competitors, the Steinway Railway (see below).\nSteinway Railway\nThe Steinway Railway operated in northwestern Queens in 1892, through the merger of the Rikers Avenue and Sanford Point Railroad and Steinway and Hunters Point Railroad, only to be acquired by NY&QC in 1896. As NY&QC faced bankruptcy in 1922, it began to sell off Steinway as a somewhat independent company. It was bought by the Third Avenue Railway System but was allowed to operate under its own name.\nBustitution and re-merging\nOn February 19, 1926, NY&QC established a bus division called the Queens-Nassau Transit Lines. Queens-Nassau buses replaced all NY&QC trolleys by 1937, with the last being motorized on October 30 of that year. In the fall of 1938, the Steinway Railway was bought by Queensboro Bridge Railway Company and renamed as Steinway Omnibus. Steinway began operating buses over former Steinway Railway lines on September 29, 1939. Both companies were operated by the same management, and casually referred to as the \"orange buses\". Queens-Nassau was renamed Queens Transit Corporation in 1957, and Steinway Omnibus became Steinway Transit in 1959. The two companies merged again in 1986 to form the Queens/Steinway Transit Corporation. The joint company was owned by the H.E. Salzberg Company (scrap metal and short-haul railways) with father Harold Salzberg, son Murray M. Salzberg (1915-1984, aged 69) and grandson Harry Salzberg, which had ripped up the rails, running these two companies until 1988, when the Linden Bus Company acquired the routes from the aging grandson Harry Salzberg. Shortly thereafter and before operations commenced, Linden Bus Company changed its name to Queens Surface Corporation.\nOn February 27, 2005, the MTA Bus Company took over the operations of the Queens Surface routes, part of the city's takeover of all the remaining privately operated bus routes.\nBus routes\nPrior to MTA Bus takeover, Queens Surface operated the following routes that are now based in College Point Bus Depot, the LaGuardia Depot (the former Triboro Coach depot), and the Eastchester Depot (the former New York Bus Service depot in the Bronx).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |\n|-\n!Route\n!Terminal A\n!Major streets of travel\n!Terminal B\n!Notes/History\n|-\n!colspan=5|FORMER QUEENS SURFACE CORPORATION BUS ROUTES\n|-\n!colspan=5|Bronx and Queens Local\n|-\n|QBx1\n|FlushingMain Street and 39th Avenuenear Flushing – Main Street ()\n|Whitestone&nbsp;Expressway, Hutchinson River Parkway,Bruckner Boulevard, Co-op City Boulevard\n|Co-op City, BronxEarhart Lane and Erskine Place\n|* Limited Stop Service; most service ran exclusively between Pelham Bay Park and Co-op City.\n* Moved to Eastchester Depot in 2009.\n* Interborough service relabeled to the  and Co-op City shuttle service relabeled to the  in 2010.\n* Off-peak Q50 service to Co-Op City discontinued in 2022.\n* Overnight Q50 service implemented in 2025.\n|-\n!colspan=5|Queens Local\n|-\n|Q25\n|rowspan=\"3\"|JamaicaSutphin Boulevard and 94th Avenueat Sutphin Boulevard – Archer Avenue – JFK Airport () and Jamaica LIRR / AirTrain Station\n|Parsons Boulevard, Kissena Boulevard, 127th Street\n|College PointPoppenhusen Avenue and 119th Street\n|\n*Originally owned by Flushing Heights Bus Company, service began in 1928.\n*Acquired by Queens–Nassau Transit, Inc. on May 25, 1933.\n*Weekdays, Q34 also provided service between Flushing and Jamaica.\n* The original Q25 terminus was in Flushing; it was combined with the then-Q34 route into College Point.\n* Southern terminus moved from 160th Street and Jamaica Avenue to Parsons Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in 2005; extended to Jamaica LIRR station on Sutphin Boulevard in 2006.\n*Limited-stop service implemented in 2007; discontinued in 2025.\n|-\n|Q34\n|Parsons Boulevard, Kissena Boulevard, Union Street\n|WhitestoneWillets Point Boulevard and 149th Street\n|\n*Service began in April 1933.\n*Weekday service only.\n*The original Q34 route was the College Point segment of the Q25; it was later rerouted to Whitestone and Linden Hill and then extended along the Q25 route.\n*Southern terminus moved from 160th Street and Jamaica Avenue to Parsons Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in 2004; extended to Jamaica LIRR station on Sutphin Boulevard in 2006.\n*Discontinued in 2025; Whitestone and Linden Hill service replaced by the .\n|-\n|Q65\n|164th Street, 45th Avenue,College Point Boulevard\n|College Point14th Avenue and 110th Street\n|\n*Service started on August 10, 1937, to replace Flushing–Jamaica Line and College Point Line streetcar service.\n*Southern terminus moved from 160th Street and Jamaica Avenue to Parsons Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in 2004; extended to Jamaica LIRR station on Sutphin Boulevard in 2006.\n* Limited-stop service implemented in 2007; discontinued in 2025\n* Northern terminus truncated to Flushing-Main Street in 2025.\n|-\n|Q65A\n|Forest HillsQueens Boulevard and 71st Avenueat Forest Hills – 71st Avenue ()\n|Jewel Avenue\n|Electchester164th Street and Jewel Avenue\n|\n*Service started in 1951.\n*Renumbered as Q64 in 2007.\n*Was at Baisley Park Depot from 2014 to 2025.\n|-\n|Q66\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Long Island City28th Street and Queens Plaza Southat Queensboro Plaza ()and Queens Plaza ()\n|21st Street, 35th Avenue,Northern Boulevard\n|FlushingMain Street and 39th Avenuenear Flushing – Main Street ()\n|\n*Service started on September 5, 1937, to replace streetcar service.\n*Original terminus was at 51st Street in Woodside; extended to Queens Plaza in 1989.\n|-\n|Q67\n|21st Street, Borden Avenue,55th Avenue, 69th Street\n|Middle VillageMetropolitan Avenue and Fresh Pond Road\n|\n*Service started on October 30, 1937, to replace streetcar service.\n*Original Middle Village terminal replaced by Fresh Pond Road terminal after the Metro Mall in Middle Village was built and opened in 1974.

It was built in 1997 by the NYCDOT, and leased to Queens Surface. Many buses under Queens Surface used compressed natural gas (CNG). It is now the College Point Depot of the MTA Bus Company.\nSteinway Transit depot\nThe Steinway Transit depot, built in 1939, was located at the northwest corner of Steinway Street and 20th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, near the northern terminus of the company's  route. It was the successor to the Steinway Railway depot. The trolley depot sat across from the Daimler Manufacturing Company automobile factory, opened in 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and local businessman William Steinway. The bus depot was closed prior to the company's takeover by the city, and has long been demolished, and replaced by new apartment buildings, similar to what was done at the old West Farms Depot site.\nWoodside Garage\nThe Woodside Garage was located at 51-00 Northern Boulevard, at the southeast corner 51st Street and Northern Boulevard in Woodside, Queens, adjacent to the Winfield Junction of the Long Island Rail Road. It was the original headquarters of Queens-Nassau Transit. It was also the successor to the NY&QC Woodside Trolley Barn, which opened in 1896 and burned down on June 24, 1930. The front facade of the trolley barn survives as a Verizon store in the Tower Square Shopping Center.\nReferences\n*Lost Trolleys of Queens and Long Island by Stephen L.
