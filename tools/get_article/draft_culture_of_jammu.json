This includes language, literature, music, dance, cuisine, festivals, and religious rituals. Influenced by Hinduism, Sikhism, and Tibetan traditions, Jammu's culture has evolved through its history and geographical context. The interplay of different communities and external influences has shaped this culture over time, resulting in different traditional and contemporary practices. As a result, Jammu's cultural identity reflects both its historical roots and the dynamic changes brought about by social and economic developments.\nHistorically, the area was home to the Dogras and later became part of different empires, including Maurya, Kushan, Gupta, and later Mughal and Sikh rule. These successive political transitions introduced different religious and cultural practices, which gradually merged with local traditions. The Jummu division is a winter capital of the Jammu and Kashmir, however it shares different cultural and geographical characteristics.\nThe Dogra dynasty (1846–1947) played a central role in promoting certain cultural elements, including Dogri language and arts, while also developed religious pluralism. During this period, traditional crafts such as Basohli painting flourished, and regional festivals like Lohri and Baisakhi gained prominence. The influence of Sikh and Muslim traditions also grew during periods of migration and interaction, contributing to religious transitions of Jammu.\nOver time, the cultural practices evolved to reflect both agrarian lifestyles and spiritual traditions. Seasonal festivals, music, dance, and crafts became integral to the daily lives of different communities. With the arrival of modernity in the 20th century, elements of culture began adapting to new economic and social realities, while some traditional practices remain unchanged in everyday life.\nLanguage and literature\nJammu is linguistically developed, with Dogri being the primary language spoken by a majority of people. Dogri belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family and has a long oral tradition characterized by folklore, songs, and poetic expression. Dogri literature flourished with both traditional and modern works, contributing significantly to the preservation of the language. With its inclusion as an official language of India in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution in 2003, Dogri has gained renewed prominence.\nOther languages such as Hindi, and Punjabi are also spoken by people while Kashmiri and Urdu are merely spoken due to Dogri roots in Jammu. Hindi and Urdu are often used in administrative contexts, while Punjabi is spoken among the Sikh community. English is also commonly used, particularly in education and official communication.\nFestivals\nJammu hosts several festivals, celebrated across religious and cultural communities. These festivals suggest the region's religious interactions and agricultural activities, celebrating occasions of spiritual devotion, harvests, and local legends.\n#Navratri is one of the most prominent festivals, observed with prayers and pilgrimages to the Vaishno Devi shrine. The entire region participate with devotional music, dance, and religious observances.\n#Lohri and Baisakhi are celebrated to mark the end of winter and the beginning of the harvest season. Baisakhi, which is also significant for Sikhs, commemorates the formation of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh.\n#Jhiri mela is an annual fair held to honor the legend of a local farmer, Baba Jitto, symbolizing sacrifice and justice.\n#Maha Shivratri draws large gatherings at temples dedicated to Shiva across the region.\n#The Muslim community observes Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha with prayers, community gatherings, and charitable activities.\nCuisine\nThe cuisine of Jammu is usually flavorful, with a focus on locally available ingredients and traditional preparations. rajma-chawal (red kidney beans with rice) is one of the signature dishes of the region, especially popular in rural households. Dairy products such as ghee, yogurt, and buttermilk are staples in everyday meals.\nAnother cuisine is kalari, a traditional cheese popular in the region, often served fried and eaten with bread or rice. The Dogra community follows a predominantly vegetarian diet, with dishes like madra (curried chickpeas) and khatta meat (sour lamb curry) being delicacies served on special occasions. Non-vegetarian cuisine, especially mutton and chicken dishes, is also served, suggesting the culinary influences of neighboring regions.\nSweets like patisa (a flaky dessert) and ghewar (a honeycomb-shaped dessert) are prepared during festivals and weddings.\nArt and craft\nJammu has a rich artistic tradition, particularly in Basohli painting, an indigenous art style known for its use of bold colors and intricate designs. Basohli paintings often depict scenes from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata and are highly valued for their aesthetic and historical significance.\nThe region is also known for pashmina shawls and woolen blankets (lois), suggesting the prominence of wool-based crafts due to the cold climate. Hand-woven carpets and intricate wood carvings are other notable crafts. Pottery, metalwork, and basket weaving are practiced in rural areas, contributing to the local economy and preserving traditional skills.\nMusic\nFolk music and dance are central parts of the cultural activities of Jammu, with performances often linked to   festivals, weddings, and seasonal celebrations. Dogri folk songs usually with themes of love, nature, and heroism, performed with traditional instruments like the sarangi, dhol, and nagara.\nKud dance is a popular folk dance performed in rural areas, typically as a form of thanksgiving to local deities. It involves men and women dancing in circles to the rhythm of drums and other instruments.\nChajja dance is performed during Lohri celebrations, particularly by young individuals, who carry decorated bamboo frames and dance energetically.\nHaran dance, a folk tradition performed during the winter season, depicts scenes of rural life and agricultural practices.\nThese dances are focused on entertainment and the preservation of cultural traditions.\nReligion\nThe cultural identity of Jammu is closely tied to its religious heritage. It is often referred to as the \"City of Temples\" due to the large number of Hindu temples located in and around the city. Some of the most prominent temples include the Raghunath Temple, dedicated to Lord Rama, and the Ranbireshwar Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva.\nThe Vaishno Devi shrine, located in the Trikuta Hills, is one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in India. Devotees undertake a strenuous trek to reach the cave shrine.\nSikhism also holds a significant place in Jammu's religious practices, with many Gurdwaras such as Gurdwara Chatti Patshahi, which commemorate visits by Sikh gurus. Islam is practiced by a considerable section of the population, with mosques and shrines contributing to the region's spiritual identity.\nClothing\nTraditional clothing in Jammu plays a prominent role in both local customs and the climate. Men often wear kurta-pajamas, dhotis, or trousers, with turbans being a common accessory among Sikhs and Dogra men. Women wear suits, saris, or ghagras, depending on the occasion and personal preference. The pheran, a long woolen robe, is worn during winter, suggesting the influence of neighboring clothing style of Kashmir.\nWoolen shawls, particularly pashmina are an essential part of winter attire. Handwoven blankets and mufflers are commonly used to cope with the cold. On festive occasions, traditional jewelry, such as nose rings, anklets, and bangles, is worn by women to enhance their appearance.\nSocial structure\nJammu's society is structured around a mix of traditional and modern values. Joint families remain common in rural areas, with elders playing a significant role in family decisions. Marriage rituals vary between communities but are often elaborate, involving ceremonies that span several days. The practice of dowry, though declining, still persists in some communities, with social initiatives promoting awareness to discourage it.\nCommunities in Jammu often come together during festivals and social events. Despite occasional political tensions, Jammu has historically been a place of different religious backgrounds.\nReferences"
