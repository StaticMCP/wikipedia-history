It was the first election to be held after the abolition of plural voting and university constituencies in addition to a reorganization of constituencies by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. It was also the first election to be held after a full 5-year term of a Labour government in office.\n| leader1 = Clement Attlee\n| leader_since1 = 25 October 1935\n| party1 = Labour Party (UK)\n| leaders_seat1 = Walthamstow West\n| last_election1 = 331 seats, 48.6%\n| seats1 = 251\n| seat_change1 = 80\n| popular_vote1 = 11,050,966\n| percentage1 = 46.1%\n| swing1 = 2.5 pp\n| image2 =\n| leader2 = Winston Churchill\n| leader_since2 = 9 October 1940\n| party2 = Conservative Party (UK)\n| leaders_seat2 = Woodford\n| last_election2 = 167 seats, 40.3%\n| seats2 = 253\n| seat_change2 = 68\n| popular_vote2 = 10,499,392\n| percentage2 = 43.8%\n| swing2 = 3.5 pp\n| image3 =\n| leader3 = Clement Davies\n| leader_since3 = 2 August 1945\n| party3 = Liberal Party (UK)\n| leaders_seat3 = Montgomeryshire\n| last_election3 = 5 seats, 9.3%\n| seats3 = 2\n| seat_change3 = 3\n| popular_vote3 = 2,248,127\n| percentage3 = 9.4%\n| swing3 = 0.1 pp\n}}\nWhile the Labour Party registered a narrow majority of 5 seats in the House of Commons, the Conservative Party won 2 seats more than Labour in England (a phenomenon which has since occurred only in 1964). However, in terms of the voteshare, Labour led by nearly 2.5% in England. The wafer-thin majority of the Labour government meant that another election had to be called in October 1951 in which the Conservatives won a narrow majority in the Commons as well as in England, despite Labour winning its highest ever share of the vote (and total raw votes).\nThe turnout registered in this election remains the highest for any election in the post-war era.\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total votes (in millions)\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Conservative\n|253\n|68\n|10,499,392\n|43.8%\n| 3.5 pp\n|-\n|Labour\n|251\n|80\n|11,050,966\n|46.1%\n| 2.5 pp\n|-\n|Liberal\n|2\n|3\n|2,248,127\n|9.4%\n| 0.1 pp\n|-\n|Other\n|0\n|7\n|155,963\n|0.7%\n| 1.2 pp\n|-\n|Total\n|506\n|\n|23,954,448\n|100%\n|\n|}\n|43.84}}\n|46.13}}\n|9.39}}\n|0.7}}}}\n|50.00}}\n|49.60}}\n|0.40}}}}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n# Nicholas, H.
