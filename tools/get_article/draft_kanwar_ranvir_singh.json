He has applied constructivism to academic enquiry, educational policy and pedagogy, and international law.\nHe was educated at Latymer Upper School and completed his university education at Warwick. His PhD was awarded for his dissertation titled States, Firms, and Oil: British Policy, 1939-54 (completed in 2000). .\nCareer\nSingh played a role in shaping paragraph 67 of the United Nations Declaration Against Racism, formally known as the Durban Declaration, adopted at the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 2001. Paragraph 67 of the Durban Declaration states: \"We recognize that members of certain groups with a distinct cultural identity face barriers arising from a complex interplay of discrimination based on race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, belief or culture, and that this may result in greater discrimination against women.\"\nSangat Singh notes that, “It may be mentioned here that the wording of para 67 was the brain child of Dr Ranvir Singh Kanwar…Sikh sustenance derives itself from being a qaum – e.g. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia being acclaimed Sultan-ul-Qoam in 18th century, and Sikhism not simply being a distinct religion but a Qaum – a nation or a nationality.”\nSingh later influenced UK educational policy as a member of the RE Review Steering Group and a member of the Board of the Religious Education Council of England and Wales. He introduced the concept of \"worldviews\" into Religious Education. This promoted the equality of theistic and non-theistic perspectives and, pedagogically, to promote teaching that emphasizes the importance of understanding the motivations and beliefs of actors within a tradition thereby building the capacity for understanding the ‘other’ on its own terms without seeking to reduce it to one’s own framework. .\nReferences"
