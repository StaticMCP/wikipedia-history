It was formed in October 2006 under the leadership of Mahamat Nouri.\nThe group consists of:\n* United Front for Democratic Change\n* Democratic Revolutionary Council\n* Union of Forces for Progress and Democracy\nHistory\nOn 22 October 2006, the newly formed Union attacked the eastern Chad town of Goz Beida. Although it was initially unclear if they succeeded or if the government was able to defend the city, it later became clear that the Union had captured the city, along with several other cities like Am Timan.\nIn 2016, the Front for Change and Concord in Chad was born as it split from the UFDD. This group is led by  Mahamat Mahdi Ali, who studied in France where he was a Socialist Party member. The group is considered by the authorities \"the most well-supplied with fighters and weapons\". The FACT led the latest major offensive from rear bases in Libya, which left the death of the President Déby on 19 April 2021, and weeks later the military junta that took power, led by his son the General Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno, claimed to have killed several hundred FACT fighters, who retreated into southern Libya.\nFACT refused to sign the agreement with the government, saying in a statement that this \"rejection is concomitant with the failure to take into account our demands\", such as the release of prisoners. The rebel group also stated that it \"remains available for dialogue everywhere and always\".\nSee also\n*War in Chad (2005–2010)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6075824.stm \"Rebels attack eastern Chad town\"\" 22 October 2006]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312040954/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20628450-1702,00.html \"Rebels take control of Chad town\" 23 October 2006]"
