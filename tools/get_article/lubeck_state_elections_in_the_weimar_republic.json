These democratic elections were conducted under a system of proportional representation and universal suffrage.\nResults with regard to the total vote, the percentage of the vote won and the number of seats allocated to each party are presented in the tables below.\nOn 31 March 1933, the Nazi-controlled central government forcibly dissolved the sitting Bürgerschaft of Lübeck. The parliament was then reconstituted to reflect the seat distribution of the national Reichstag, dominated by the Nazis. The subversion of democratic institutions was followed by the formal abolition of the Bürgerschaft under the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" of 30 January 1934, which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state.\n1919\nThe 1919 Lübeck state election was held on 9 February 1919 to elect the 80 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1921\nThe 1921 Lübeck state election was held on 13 November 1921 to elect the 80 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1924\nThe 1924 Lübeck state election was held on 10 February 1924 to elect the 80 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1926\nThe 1926 Lübeck state election was held on 14 November 1926 to elect the 80 members of the Bürgerschaft.\nElections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany}}\nReferences"
