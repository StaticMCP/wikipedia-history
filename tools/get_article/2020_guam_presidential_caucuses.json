Former vice president Joe Biden won the Democratic caucus, held on June 6. The Republican caucus, held on March 14 in the form of a \"state convention\", endorsed incumbent President Donald Trump.\nDemocratic caucus\nThe 2020 Guam Democratic presidential caucus was held on June 6, 2020, a Saturday, in the Democratic Party primaries and caucuses for the 2020 presidential election alongside the U.S. Virgin Islands caucuses on the same day. The Guam caucus was a closed caucus, with the territory awarding 13 delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of which 7 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the caucus. Former vice president Joe Biden decisively won the caucus with almost 70% over senator Bernie Sanders, who had suspended his campaign, giving 5 delegates to Biden and 2 to Sanders.\nProcedure\nWhen the Guam Democratic Party published its draft delegate selection plan on July 7, 2019, it had originally specified a May 2 date for the 2020 caucus, but in May it was postponed to June 6 and following the final decision on June 4 it was completely held as a drive-through \"Special Election and Caucus\" at Adelup Breezeway in the capital Hagåtña, using unusual paper ballots for the presidential preference, due to concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The caucus thereby took place on the same day as the caucus on the Virgin Islands, which had regularly been planned for the date.\nIn the closed caucus, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent across the territory to be considered viable. The 7 pledged delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the caucus. Of these, all 7 were at-large pledged delegates. Originally planned with 6 delegates, the final number included a 20% bonus of 1 additional delegate by the Democratic National Committee due to the original May date, which belonged to Stage III on the primary timetable.\nThe delegation also included 6 unpledged PLEO delegates: 4 members of the Democratic National Committee, one member of Congress (House of Representatives nonvoting delegate Michael San Nicolas), and the governor Lou Leon Guerrero.\nResults\nAs participants would originally have advocated their support for a candidate during the caucus without any secret ballot, candidates did not need to qualify for ballot access (making it the only other contest beside Iowa to do so). The so-called \"special election\" finally held because of the pandemic used paper ballots and included on them the two remaining national candidates that were still seeking delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |2020 Guam Democratic caucuses\n!

The 6 at-large delegates to be elected for the 2020 Republican National Convention at the state convention were originally unbound according to local party rules, without any formal process (except their own decision) existing to bind them to a candidate. The state convention officially endorsed incumbent President Donald Trump and bound all 9 delegates from Guam to him, even though the 3 party leader delegates were automatic delegates and would regularly stay unbound before the national convention.\nSee also\n* 2020 United States presidential straw poll in Guam\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/GU-D The Green Papers Democratic Party delegate allocation summary]\n*[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/GU-R The Green Papers Republican Party delegate allocation summary]"
