Gödöllő Palace and the surrounding park and landscape was her favourite summer palace, where she came with the king and the children. Elisabeth was known to speak fluently Hungarian and always had great love for the Hungarian people. In 1901 the Hungarian sculptor József Róna created the bronze monument of the empress-queen at the end of an avenue of trees. The park was inaugurated by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, her widower.\nBehind the monument, there is another monument to the crown on a man-made stone hill. The park is a favourite place for visitors in spring and fall.\nSee also\n*Queen Elisabeth Park, Esztergom\n*Empress Elisabeth Park\nExternal links\n*[http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Hungary/Pest_Megye/Godollo-434776/Things_To_Do-Godollo-TG-C-1.html Virtual Tourist | Godollo Things to Do]"
