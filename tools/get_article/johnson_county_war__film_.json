The script was written by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and was about two fictitious families at the time of the Johnson County War (which had formed the backdrop to the film ''Heaven's Gate'').\nFilming started in Calgary, Canada, on 12 March 2001 and went until May. Filming took place in Kananasikis Country. The budget was estimated between $10–20 million Canadian.\nMcMurtry later wrote, \"the film had its moments but very few of the actors had theirs — mainly the star, Tom Berenger, who insisted on singing as he was being murdered. We tried to discourage him but he persuaded us and I suspect now that he was right: absurdity is better than nothing, in the movies.\"\nCast\n* Tom Berenger as Cain Hammett\n* Luke Perry as Harry Hammett\n* Burt Reynolds as Hunt Lawton\n* Michelle Forbes as Rory Hammett\n* Rachel Ward as \"Queenie\"\n* Adam Storke as Dale Hammett\n* Christopher Cazenove as Lord Peter\n* Jack Conley as Jesse Jacklin\n* Silas Weir Mitchell as Mitch Slaughter\n* Fay Masterson as Clara Jager\n* Ken Pogue as Wally Tascot\n* Blu Mankuma as Hambone\n* William Samples as Arthur\n* Stephen Bridgewater as Dencil Jager\n* Adrien Dorval as Timberline\n* Stevie Mitchell as Joey\n* Jimmy Herman as Sam-The-Wolfer\n* Henry Beckman as Governor Barb\n* Ron Hartmann as Senator Thorpe\n* Tim Koetting as \"Bat\" Waldy\n* Hal Kerbes as Irv Hornsby\n* Paul Coeur as Claybourne Rodney\n* Tom Heaton as Sheriff Sine\n* Lyle St. Goddard as Avery\n* John F.

Clocking in at four hours, the miniseries-that-isn’t — it’s airing on one night — does its best to revive the small-screen Western, a genre that hasn’t seen a classic in some time... pic has enough machismo sunsets and gunplay to keep viewers hooked despite its extended running time. The problem, however, is that Hallmark just doesn’t draw ’em in.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://letterboxd.com/film/johnson-county-war/ Johnson County War] at Letterbox DVD"
