This museum had the most comprehensive collection of wildfowl carvings in the world, ranging from art sculptures to working decoys used by hunters.  The museum was named after Lem and Steve Ward from Crisfield, Maryland, two pioneers who moved decoy carvings into the realm of fine art. A design competition was conducted by the Ward Foundation, Inc., in 1990 to select the architect for the 32,000 SF facility to be located on Schumaker Pond in Salisbury, Maryland. Working with noted exhibits' consultant Ben Kozak, the Salisbury firm of Davis, Bowen & Friedel, Inc., and lead design architect Michael Wigley, AIA, were selected for the commission. In 1992, Brohawn Construction of Cambridge, Maryland, completed the project. After thirty years, however, the museum closed its doors in 2022 at the Schumaker Pond location. The Ward Foundation, Inc. still continues to operate the Ward World Championship.
