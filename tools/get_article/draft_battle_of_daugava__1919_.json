The battle took place along the western bank of the Daugava River near the Latvian capital, Riga, and was a significant part of the broader struggle for control over Latvia in the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution.\nBackground\nFollowing the collapse of the Russian Empire and the end of World War I, the newly declared Republic of Latvia faced multiple threats from the Bolsheviks in the east and pro-German and White Russian forces in the west. The West Russian Volunteer Army, led by Pavel Bermondt-Avalov and composed largely of German Freikorps and monarchist Russian troops, sought to occupy Latvia under the guise of fighting Bolshevism.\nIn October 1919, Bermontian forces launched a large-scale offensive from western Latvia, crossing the Daugava River and threatening Riga. The Latvian government requested military assistance from its allies, particularly Estonia, which had forces stationed in northern Latvia following its own independence war.\nBattle\nBetween mid-October and early November 1919, Estonian units, including armored trains and artillery batteries, arrived near Riga to support Latvian defensive efforts. Estonian forces launched attacks on Bermontian positions on the left bank of the Daugava River, aiming to dislodge the West Russian Volunteer Army from its strongholds in Pārdaugava and surrounding areas.\nDespite intense fighting and artillery bombardment, the Bermontian forces mounted a determined resistance. Well-fortified positions and effective use of counter-artillery allowed them to repel several Estonian-led assaults. The Bermontians successfully held key districts west of the river, including strategic rail junctions and urban areas.\nThe Estonian attacks ultimately failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the Bermontians maintained control over parts of the Riga outskirts for several more weeks.\nAftermath\nAlthough the Bermontians would later retreat under combined Latvian and Allied pressure in late November 1919, the Battle of Daugava marked a temporary success for their forces. Their ability to resist the Estonian intervention delayed the Latvian counteroffensive and prolonged the conflict in western Latvia.\nThe battle is sometimes noted for the coordination difficulties among anti-Bolshevik and nationalist factions, as well as for the effectiveness of Freikorps-style warfare in urban and riverine environments.\nPavel Bermontd about the Battle of Daugava of 1919\nOctober 24, 1919\nNo. 56\nMitau\nSoldiers of the German Legion! In heavy fighting, you threw the enemy back behind the Daugava and repulsed all his attempts to force the river. In tiring marches, you then moved out to Friedrichstadt to halt the advance of the Estonians. You have suffered much in these days, and many of you have sealed the German-Russian brotherhood in arms with your blood. Difficult battles still lie ahead of you. But I am convinced that in the future, too, I will only hear praise about the soldiers of the German Legion\nThe responsible leader of the German Legion, Captain z. S. Sievert, is nominated for the Order of St. Vladimir with Swords and Ribbon, 4th Class. Captain Krause-Davi, as commander of the detachments that stormed the bridges over the Daugava, is nominated for the Order of St. Anne, 4th Class, \"For Bravery.\"\nTwo soldiers from each company should be nominated for the St. George's Cross.\nIn the name of my homeland, I express my gratitude to all heroes.\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army, Colonel Prince [https://vtoraya-literatura.com/pdf/awaloff_im_kampf_gegen_bolschewismus_1925__ocr.pdf Avaloff],The last page of the book\nLegacy\nWhile overshadowed by subsequent events, the Battle of Daugava remains a significant episode in the Latvian War of Independence. It is remembered for the intensity of fighting along the river and the temporary defensive success of the West Russian Volunteer Army against one of the most organized national armies in the region.\nSee also\n* Latvian War of Independence\n* Estonian War of Independence\n* West Russian Volunteer Army\n* Bermont–Avalov offensive\n* History of Latvia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.historia.lv Latvian Institute of History]\n* [https://www.vm.ee Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\nReferences"
