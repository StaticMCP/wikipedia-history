Themed learning areas include a kitchen and farmer's market, construction zone, medical center, television studio, science lab, theater, farm, garage and art center.\nHistory\nIn 2002, it was a mobile museum without permanent display space.  In 2003, it moved into 30 N. Main Street and acquired a full-time executive director with additional part-time staff.\nOn September 4, 2010, the old museum closed in order to relocate to a new facility in the renovated A&N Department Store building at 150 S. Main St. which had been vacant. Construction for renovation of the first two floor (exclusive of exhibits) cost $415,464.\nThe new museum was opened in November 2010.\nReferences"
