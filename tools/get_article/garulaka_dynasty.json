Five rulers of the dynasty are known from two donation charters dated to 6th century CE.\nHistory\nTheir capital was probably at Phamka-prasravana (possibly Jhunjharijhar near Dhank if read as Dhanka-prasravana). It could be at Gop as well. It was in western Saurashtra.\nThere are two donation charters discovered of the dynasty; of Varahdasa II's from 549 CE and of Simhaditya's from 574 CE. The first known ruler was Shura I, who was a rajasthaniya of Maitraka ruler Bhatarka. He held Bhatarka-vihara at Valabhi. His son was Senapati Varahadasa I who was succeeded by his son Shura II. Shura II's brother Varahadsa II had granted a land to Buddhist vihara in 549 CE. The land it was originally granted to Garulakas by Maitrakas. Varahadasa captured Dwarka, built many temples and held title Dwarkadhipati. His successor Simhaditya granted a land to Brahmin in 574 CE. There is no more information about the dynasty and it is assumed that their rule may have extended till the end of 7th century CE.\nThe ruler were told parama-bhagavata and Garulaka may be derived from Garudaka, a term based on Garuda.\nIn the mid-8th century, the same region was ruled by Saindhava dynasty.\nArchitecture\nThe temples constructed in this period follows the contemporary and earlier traditions of Maitrakas. The most temples of the period falls under the region ruled by Garulakas, except at Kalsar and Prabhas.\nList of rulers\n* Rajasthaniya Shura I\n* Senapati Varahadasa I\n* Maharaja Shura II\n* Varahadasa II (c. 549 CE)\n* Simhaditya (c. 574 CE)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
