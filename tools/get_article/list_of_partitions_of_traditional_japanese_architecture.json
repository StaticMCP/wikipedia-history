Rafters are traditionally the only structural member used in Japanese timber framing that are neither horizontal nor vertical. The rest of the structure is non-load-bearing.\nWhile fixed walls are used, a variety of movable partitions are also used to fill the spaces between the pillars. They may be free-standing, hung from lintels, or, especially in later buildings, sliding panels which can readily be removed from their grooves. Their type, number, and position are adjusted according to the weather without and the activities within. They are used to modify the view, light, temperature, humidity, and ventilation, and to divide the interior space.\nThe timbers are called , the space between them is called ; thus, the items filling the  are termed  equipment.\nPictorial overview\nFile:Saikū Historical Museum - Display item04 - The palace of Saiô - Miniature model.jpg|Museum model of the Saikū, the Saiō's palace.
