The alphanumeric marks (or \"registration numbers\", officially termed \"identification marks\") themselves are issued by the local authority in which a vehicle is first registered. A vehicle's number plate is determined when it is first registered, the county/city code is taken from the first owner's postal address. Registration remains fixed on one vehicle until it is de-registered (exported, destroyed, etc.), and cannot be transferred to other vehicles.\nFormat\nThe current specification for number plates is the format YYH–CC–SSSSSS. Those issued from 1987 to 2012 had the format YY–CC–SSSSSS.\nThe components are:\n* YY or YYH – a numeric year or half-year identifier based on date of the vehicle's first registration.\n** The former YY format used the last two digits of the year the car was registered.\n** The YYH format used since 2013 appends a 1 or 2 as a third digit depending on which half of the year the car was registered: 1 for January–June and 2 for July–December.\n* CC – a one- or two-letter identifier of the area of the licensing authority, which registers vehicles on behalf of one or more local authorities. For example:\n** D is the identifier for County Dublin (four local authorities: Dublin City Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council)\n** SO is the identifier for County Sligo (one local authority: Sligo County Council)\n* SSSSSS – a one- to six-digit sequence number, starting with the first vehicle registered in the licensing authority area that year or half-year. For example, the 12,345th vehicle registered in Dublin in 1989 would display 89-D-12345; the 56,789th  registered in Dublin in the first half of 2023 would display 231-D-56789.\nSpecifications\nSince 1991, the design of the standard Irish number plate has been based on European standard guidelines, with a blue vertical band to the left of the plate containing the twelve stars of the Flag of Europe, below which is the country identifier for Ireland: IRL. The rest of the plate has a white background with black characters. There are usually two hyphens; between the year and county code, and between the county code and sequence number. Also required is the full Irish language name of the county/city which must be positioned above the identifier. From July 2025, new and existing vehicles emitting zero emissions at the tailpipe can optionally be registered with a green vertical band; rectangular plates have the green band printed to the right of the plate, while square plates feature the green band below the blue country identifier band.\nThe current regulations are set out in the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations, 1999, as amended by the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 2012 and Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 2025. These prescribe the format, dimensions and technical specifications of registration plates to be displayed on vehicles. They substitute the First Schedule of the Vehicle Registration and Taxation Regulations, 1992 to allow additional characters to be displayed on the registration plate and to ensure that these are displayed in the correct position and proportion. The changes were necessary to cater for increases in the number of car registrations.\nA standard uniform character font is not required. The rules simply require legible black sans serif characters, no more than 70mm high and 36mm wide with a stroke width of 10mm, on a white reflective background. The result is that a large variety of perfectly legal font styles may be seen, on either pressed aluminium or acrylic plates, both of which are allowed. Commonly used fonts include a condensed version of Mandatory, Arial and FE-Schrift. Despite the rather relaxed lack of a specified font, the hyphen between the lettering must lie between the minimum dimensions of 13mm x 10mm or the maximum dimension of 22mm x 10mm.\nIf the plate's format does not meet the requirements, the vehicle will fail the mandatory periodic National Car Test (NCT), although some owners of custom plates evade this by switching to conformant plates temporarily for the NCT. As automatic number-plate recognition has become prevalent on toll roads and for traffic enforcement cameras, the use of hard-to-read nonstandard plates has become a concern. It is a criminal offence not to display plates in the specified format, liable to a fine after summary conviction of up to €5,000. In 2008, the Revenue Commissioners issued 69 formal warnings and launched no criminal prosecutions. The Road Traffic Act 2016 authorised the Garda Síochána (police) to issue a fixed-charge penalty instead of prosecution. The power was extended to the Revenue Commissioners in 2023. However, the statutory instrument setting the applicable penalty (of €60) was not made until 2024, and the Garda mobile app connecting to its PULSE IT system was not updated until October 2025.\nCurrent implementation\n's official car, with 191-D-1 plate, outside the Mansion House in 2019]]\nSequence numbers may be reserved for new vehicle registrations only on completion of form VRT15A and payment of €1,000.  This reservation was withdrawn from used imported vehicles on first Irish registration in 2015.\n* Most registration numbers can be reserved, with the exception of the first number of each year issued in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford as these are reserved for the respective mayor/lord mayor of these cities.\nThus, for example, in 2019, Lord Mayor Paul McAuliffe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, was entitled to receive the registration plate 191-D-1 on his official vehicle.\n* Luxury cars with numeric names are often registered with a matching, usually pre-reserved sequence number: for example 06-D-911 on a Porsche 911 or 06-D-750 BMW 750 or 03-C-5 for a 2003 Citroen C5 and 08-D-89 for an Aston Martin DB9.\n* Dublin radio station FM104 tend to register their vehicles with reserved number sequences ending with \"104\", e.g. 05-D-38104.\nThere are only two pre-1987 codes still issued in Ireland.\n* \"ZZ\", administered by the AA Ireland as agents for the Revenue Commissioners, is given to registrants who are based outside the state and who only intend keeping the vehicle within Ireland for a period not exceeding one month. This form of temporary registration is usually used for vehicles that are purchased within Ireland but exported by its new owner to another sovereign state directly after purchase. The format of the code is ZZ followed by a five digit number.\n* \"ZV\", which can be selected as an alternative to the current scheme when registering a vehicle older than 30 years for the first time in Ireland.\nSpecial formats\nImported used cars are registered based on the year of first registration in their country of original registration rather than the year of import.  Early in this system, each county used to have a continuous sequence of numbers for vehicles so if a new car registered on 31 December 2010 was 10 D 37456, then the next registered car from 2010 registered in 2011 would be 10 D 37457.  This changed in late 2011 when each county (prior to 2010) had their next available sequence number increased.  For example, 10-D-120006 would be the 6th import in Dublin of a car from 2010, as Dublin's re-registration band starts at 120000.  Meath's starts at 15000.\nVehicles registered to the Irish Defence Forces have plates with silver letters on black background.  These do not feature the Irish-language county name.\nTrade plates have plates with white letters on a dark green background, but with the reverse style of the normal plates: the trader's number for that year is displayed first, the county second, and the applicable year last.\nDiplomatic plates are very similar to civilian format, except for the small \"CD\" between the index mark code and serial number. Code CD is not always shown in Diplomatic plates.\nIndex mark codes\nThe city codes are a single letter, the initial letter of its English-language name. Most county codes use the first and last letters of the county's name. For example, Sligo is SO. The exceptions to this are:\n* Where the county shares its registration function with the city of the same name, in which case both use the single-letter code. An example of this is County Cork, which shares the same name with Cork City, and takes the code \"C\".\n* Where a conflict exists, i.e. Kerry is KY, so Kilkenny is KK; and County Waterford was (until 2014) WD, (subsequently changed to \"W\"), so Wexford is WX.\n*The \"T\" code which is used in County Tipperary. This is because the county was, until 2014, divided into Tipperary North Riding (TN) and Tipperary South Riding (TS).\nThe codes are similar to the ISO 3166-2 codes for Irish counties. An exception is that the ISO code for Cork is IE-CO, since IE-C is used for the province of , and the ISO code for Tipperary is IE-TA (from the Irish name Tiobraid Árann).\nCurrent index mark codes\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

No. 287/1990). A similar band was adopted by Portugal in 1992 and by Germany in 1994 and was standardised across the EU on 11 November 1998 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98.\nHistory\nregistration plate \"IF 644\"]]\nwith County Kildare registration plate ZW 2202 – contemporary photograph]]\nFrom 1903, the system used in Ireland was part of the original British system of identifiers. This was superseded in Ireland on 1 January 1987.\nA two-letter code containing the letter I was allocated to each administrative county in alphabetical order (the full list appears below), with the initial registration format being the code followed by a sequence number from 1 to 9999, as in Great Britain. The codes allocated ran from IA to IZ, then from AI to WI, with the letters G, S, and V skipped as these were intended for Scotland. The full list was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Code\n!County\n|-\n|IA\n|Antrim\n|-\n|IB\n|Armagh\n|-\n|IC\n|Carlow\n|-\n|ID\n|Cavan\n|-\n|IE\n|Clare\n|-\n|IF\n|Cork\n|-\n|IH\n|Donegal\n|-\n|IJ\n|Down\n|-\n|IK\n|Dublin\n|-\n|IL\n|Fermanagh\n|-\n|IM\n|Galway\n|-\n|IN\n|Kerry\n|-\n|IO\n|Kildare\n|-\n|IP\n|Kilkenny\n|-\n|IR\n|Offaly (King's County)\n|-\n|IT\n|Leitrim\n|-\n|IU\n|Limerick\n|-\n|IW\n|Londonderry\n|-\n|IX\n|Longford\n|-\n|IY\n|Louth\n|-\n|IZ\n|Mayo\n|-\n|AI\n|Meath\n|-\n|BI\n|Monaghan\n|-\n|CI\n|Laois (Queen's County)\n|-\n|DI\n|Roscommon\n|-\n|EI\n|Sligo\n|-\n|FI\n|Tipperary North Riding\n|-\n|HI\n|Tipperary South Riding\n|-\n|JI\n|Tyrone\n|-\n|KI\n|Waterford\n|-\n|LI\n|Westmeath\n|-\n|MI\n|Wexford\n|-\n|NI\n|Wicklow\n|}\nIn 1921, shortly before the creation of the Irish Free State, Belfast and Dublin City completed their original marks and thus took the next available codes, XI and YI respectively, with Dublin City then taking ZI in 1927. After this, most other codes with Z as the first letter (again skipping those containing G, S and V) were allocated in alphabetical order, starting with single-letter Z – the only one-letter code used in Ireland – for County Dublin. (This does not include the ZZ code for temporary imports, introduced in 1925.)\nIn February 1952, a joint motor taxation authority was set up for Dublin City and county, and their codes were merged. Two years later, with all possible codes (at the time) allocated, a new format was introduced with a serial letter added before the code, and the sequence number running only to 999 (thus limiting the number of characters on a number plate to six). The Dublin joint authority was the first to adopt this format when it issued ARI&nbsp;1 in May 1954, and each county followed suit once all its two-letter combinations had been issued. In the case of counties with more than one code, all the three-letter marks for the first allocated code would be issued, then all such marks for the second code, and so on (see the lists of series per county below).\nG, S and V were not used as serial letters at first, while Z was not used before a code starting with that letter, so as to prevent any clashing with ZZ temporary registrations. Several other three-letter marks were not issued either through oversight or because they were deemed offensive, and the single-letter Z code was left out of this format as a serial letter would have created a duplicate of an existing two-letter code, particularly one used in Northern Ireland.\nInitially, all number plates had been black with white or silver characters, but in 1969 the option of black-on-white at the front and black-on-red at the rear was introduced.\nIn February 1970, the Dublin joint authority exhausted all its three-letter combinations and thus began issuing \"reversed\" registrations, starting with the original two-letter codes (plus single-letter Z) in order of allocation. These were followed from July 1974 onwards by the three-letter marks (1&nbsp;ARI etc.), issued in the same manner as for the forward versions. Again, other counties followed this example over time. Also in 1974, Cork followed Dublin's example of setting up a joint motor taxation authority for city and county, though their codes were not merged until August 1985.\nIn 1982, with Dublin and several other counties having exhausted all possible combinations of their original codes, it was decided to allocate the skipped codes containing G, S and V to these counties. In the cases of these codes, the forward three-letter combinations were issued first in the same manner as before, followed by the forward two-letter combinations.\nUnder this system, Irish vehicle registration marks could be transferred to Britain for re-registration on other vehicles, even after Irish independence, and even though they could not be re-used within Ireland.  The letter I in many combinations made these attractive for collectors, and indeed the Kilkenny issue VIP&nbsp;1 fetched a record price at auction. Since the introduction of the current system in 1987, such exports have been impossible, even for old-format registrations, although those already exported may still be re-transferred.\nIn the 1980s, it became apparent that all possible combinations under the numbering system then in force would soon become exhausted. In Northern Ireland, this problem was rectified by the addition of additional digits. In the Republic of Ireland, it was decided to introduce an entirely new system with the format of double digits indicating the year of first registration, followed by one or two letters indicating the county of first registration, followed by a number, assigned to vehicles registered in a particular county in order (for example, 87-RN-9999 indicates that the vehicle was the 9999th to be registered in Roscommon in 1987). The new system was introduced on 1 January 1987.\nThe 1987 system allocated single-letter codes to the county boroughs (including those shared with counties) and two-letter codes to the other counties.  Normally these are the initial and final letter of the English-language name of the county (except where duplicates would result). The full list was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Code\n!Local Authority\n|-\n|CW\n|Carlow\n|-\n|CN\n|Cavan\n|-\n|CE\n|Clare\n|-\n|C\n|Cork\n|-\n|DL\n|Donegal\n|-\n|D\n|Dublin\n|-\n|G\n|Galway\n|-\n|KY\n|Kerry\n|-\n|KD\n|Kildare\n|-\n|KK\n|Kilkenny\n|-\n|LS\n|Laois\n|-\n|LM\n|Leitrim\n|-\n|L\n|Limerick (City)\n|-\n|LK\n|Limerick (County)\n|-\n|LH\n|Louth\n|-\n|MO\n|Mayo\n|-\n|MH\n|Meath\n|-\n|MN\n|Monaghan\n|-\n|OY\n|Offaly\n|-\n|RN\n|Roscommon\n|-\n|SO\n|Sligo\n|-\n|TN\n|Tipperary North Riding\n|-\n|TS\n|Tipperary South Riding\n|-\n|W\n|Waterford (City)\n|-\n|WD\n|Waterford (County)\n|-\n|WH\n|Westmeath\n|-\n|WX\n|Wexford\n|-\n|WW\n|Wicklow\n|}\nUntil 1991, all plates under this system consisted solely of black characters on white, on both front and rear. However, in that year, the blue EU identifier and the official Irish language name of the county were added, the latter as a result of the controversy arising from using English as the basis, described by Conradh na Gaeilge, an organisation which promotes the Irish language in Ireland and worldwide, as \"a fiasco\".\nVehicles first registered outside the state before 1987 are allowed to be re-registered using only the current system, with a year number preceding 87 – for instance, a vehicle from 1964 re-registered in Meath would have 64-MH at the start of its registration.\nIn 2013, the year was changed to a 3-digit year with the third digit being 1 for January to June and 2 for July to December, for example, 131 for January–June 2013 and 132 for July–December 2013. The decision to change the year was based partly on superstition about an unlucky '13' registration, but also to boost sales in the second half of the year.\nPre-1987 mark codes\nThe first codes were allocated in 1903, when all of Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom. The codes were based on the alphabetical order of counties and county boroughs (cities) as they were named at the time. King's County and Queen's County were renamed Offaly and Laois respectively following the independence of most of Ireland as the Irish Free State. Counties and county boroughs in italics are in Northern Ireland and still use the 1903 system.\nCodes with the letters G, S and V were reserved until the 1980s when they were taken by counties that had exhausted all the combinations for their original codes.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!letter!!code (Ix)!!County or city!!code(xI)!!County or city!!code (Zx)!!County or city\n|-\n||A||IA || Antrim ||AI || Meath||ZA || Dublin City\n|-\n||B||IB || Armagh ||BI || Monaghan||ZB || Cork County\n|-\n||C||IC || Carlow ||CI || Queen's County (later Laoighis, Leix, Laois) ||ZC || Dublin City\n|-\n||D||ID || Cavan ||DI || Roscommon ||ZD || Dublin City\n|-\n||E||IE || Clare ||EI || Sligo ||ZE || Dublin County\n|-\n||F||IF || Cork County||FI || Tipperary North Riding ||ZF || Cork City\n|-\n||H||IH|| Donegal ||HI || Tipperary South Riding ||ZH || Dublin City\n|-\n||J||IJ || Down || JI || Tyrone ||ZJ || Dublin City\n|-\n||K||IK|| Dublin County||KI || Waterford County||ZK || Cork County\n|-\n||L||IL || Fermanagh ||LI || Westmeath ||ZL || Dublin City\n|-\n||M||IM || Galway ||MI || Wexford ||ZM || Galway County\n|-\n||N||IN || Kerry ||NI || Wicklow ||ZN || Meath\n|-\n||O||IO || Kildare ||OI || Belfast City ||ZO || Dublin City and County\n|-\n||P||IP || Kilkenny ||PI || Cork City ||ZP || Donegal\n|-\n||R||IR ||King's County (later Offaly) ||RI || Dublin City ||ZR || Wexford\n|-\n||T||IT || Leitrim ||TI || Limerick City ||ZT || Cork County\n|-\n||U||IU || Limerick County||UI || Derry City ||ZU || Dublin City and County\n|-\n||W||IW || County Londonderry ||WI || Waterford City ||ZW || Kildare\n|-\n||X||IX || Longford ||XI || Belfast City ||ZX || Kerry\n|-\n||Y||IY || Louth ||YI || Dublin City ||ZY || Louth\n|-\n||Z||IZ || Mayo ||ZI || Dublin City ||ZZ || Temporary registrations\n|-\n|| || || || || ||Z || Dublin County\n|-\n||G||IG || Fermanagh (from 2004) ||GI || Tipperary South Riding (from 1985) ||ZG || Dublin City and County (from 1983)\n|-\n||S||IS || Mayo (from 1983) ||SI || Dublin City and County (from 1982) ||ZS || Dublin City and County (from 1984)\n|-\n||V||IV || Limerick (from 1982) || VI || British Virgin Islands (1995–1996) Derry City (2023 onwards) ||ZV || Dublin City and County (from 1985) / vehicles >30 years old\n|}\nSeries per county 1903–1986\nCarlow CC: IC\n:IC&nbsp;1 to IC&nbsp;9999 (Dec 1903 – Apr 1964).\n:AIC&nbsp;1 to YIC&nbsp;994 (Apr 1964 – Dec 1986).\nCavan CC: ID\n:ID&nbsp;1 to ID&nbsp;9999 (Jan 1904 – Jul 1958).\n:AID&nbsp;1 to ZID&nbsp;999 (Jul 1958 – Dec 1976).\n:1&nbsp;ID to 9999&nbsp;ID (Dec 1976 – Feb 1981).\n:1&nbsp;AID to 906&nbsp;IID (Feb 1981 – Dec 1986).\nClare CC IE\n:IE&nbsp;1 to IE&nbsp;9999 (Jan 1904 – Mar 1959).\n:AIE&nbsp;1 to ZIE&nbsp;999 (Mar 1959 – Nov 1974).\n:1&nbsp;IE to 9999&nbsp;IE (Nov 1974 – Sep 1978).\n:1&nbsp;AIE to 107&nbsp;XIE (Sep 1978 – Dec 1986).\nCork CC: (in original issuing sequence) IF ZB ZK ZT\n:IF&nbsp;1 to IF&nbsp;9999 (Dec 1903 – Apr 1935);\n:ZB&nbsp;1 to ZB&nbsp;9999 (Apr 1935 – Apr 1949);\n:ZK&nbsp;1 to ZK&nbsp;9999 (Apr 1949 – May 1953);\n:ZT&nbsp;1 to ZT&nbsp;9999 (May 1953 – Dec 1955).\n:AIF&nbsp;1 to ZIF&nbsp;999 (Dec 1955 – Apr 1962);\n:AZB&nbsp;1 to YZB&nbsp;999 (Apr 1962 – Aug 1966);\n:AZK&nbsp;1 to YZK&nbsp;999 (Aug 1966 – Aug 1970);\n:AZT&nbsp;1 to YZT&nbsp;999 (Aug 1970 – Nov 1973).\n:1&nbsp;IF to 9999&nbsp;IF (Nov 1973 – May 1975);\n:1&nbsp;ZB to 9999&nbsp;ZB (May 1975 – Jul 1976);\n:1&nbsp;ZK to 9999&nbsp;ZK (Jul 1976 – Aug 1977);\n:1&nbsp;ZT to 9999&nbsp;ZT (Aug 1977 – Jun 1978).\n:1&nbsp;AIF to 999&nbsp;ZIF (Jun 1978 – Sep 1980);\n:1&nbsp;AZB to 999&nbsp;YZB (Sep 1980 – Jun 1983);\n:1&nbsp;AZK to 999&nbsp;PZK (Jun 1983 – Aug 1985);\n:1&nbsp;RZK to 999&nbsp;YZK (Aug 1985 – May 1986).\n:In June 1974 Cork County Council and Cork County Borough Council set up a joint motor taxation authority, administered by the County Council.

Their initial year number and county (i.e. A UK reg 1967 Ford Cortina (MHW 7E) would be registered as 67-D-1 (e.g. 67-D (or any county initial) 1) This would state the year of its first registration or manufacture outside the state but since 2011 these numbers have begun at 120000 which is not historical or authentic (e.g. 67-D-120001). A 1986 Opel with right-hand-drive registered in Ireland would have a pre-1987 style registration plate, the same model car with left-hand-drive imported from the rest of Europe or a Vauxhall from England, Scotland or Wales would have new 86 registration plate. Volkswagen Beetle cars that were imported as knock-down kits from Mexico and assembled up to the mid-2000s were registered in Ireland on original Irish reg chassis having pre-1987 number plates. Pre-1987 registration plates are few and far between nowadays and are mostly found at vintage car shows.\nSee also\n*Motor Tax in the Republic of Ireland\n*Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom\n*Vehicle registration plate\n*List of international license plate codes\n*Vienna Convention on Road Traffic\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wolfbane.com/vreg.htm U.K. and R.O.I.
