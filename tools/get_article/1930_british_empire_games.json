After campaigning for the idea among contacts he met at the Olympics, he was asked to organise the first British Empire Games in Hamilton. Fellow Hamilton journalist Ivan Miller helped with the organizing committee.\nThe sports included athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming, and wrestling. Women competed only in aquatic events. The opening ceremony and athletics events were held at Civic Stadium (later renamed Ivor Wynne Stadium) in east Hamilton.\nThe event was opened by the Governor General of Canada, Lord Willingdon, on 16 August. Canadian triple jumper Gordon Smallacombe claimed the debut gold medal a few hours later.\nThe 1930 British Empire Games made use of pedestals for dignitaries to present medals to winning athletes, as proposed by Bobby Robinson. This inspired the Olympic medal podium ceremonies which began at the 1932 Winter Olympics.\nSports\n*\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nParticipating teams\nParticipating countries\nThere were 11 teams participating in these inaugural British Empire Games:\n*\n*\n*\n*  (host)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nMedal table\nVenues\nNotable venues include:\n* Prince of Wales Elementary School, (77 Melrose Ave N) – Male Accommodation\n* Royal Connaught Hotel – Female Accommodation\n* Civic Stadium – Athletics, Opening and Closing ceremonies\n* Hamilton Municipal Pool – Aquatics (swimming and diving)\n* Barton Street Arena - Boxing and wrestling\n* Burlington Bay - Rowing\n* Roselawn Bowling Club, Gage Park - Lawn bowls\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.commonwealthsport.com/commonwealth-games/hamilton-1930 \"Hamilton 1930\"].
