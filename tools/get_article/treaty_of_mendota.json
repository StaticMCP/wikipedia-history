The treaty stipulated that the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute bands were to receive US$1,410,000 in return for relocating to the Lower Sioux Agency on the Minnesota River near present-day Morton, Minnesota along with giving up their rights to a significant portion of southern Minnesota.\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Mendota along with the earlier Treaty of Traverse des Sioux (), most of southern Minnesota became open to white settlement.\nBackground\nThe first treaty with the Dakota was the Treaty with the Sioux, signed in 1805 at Pike Island, which ceded 100,000 acres at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers so that the U.S. government could build Fort Snelling. U.S. Army Lt. Zebulon Pike, the negotiator for the U.S., valued the land at $200,000. The U.S. Senate approved the treaty, which had no specific dollar amount written, and paid $2,000 for the land.\nIn 1837, following the collapse of the fur trade, the U.S. government negotiated new treaties with the Dakota and the Ojibwe. The Dakota received $16,000 in cash and goods up front, and promises of up to $40,000 per year in upcoming years. Fur traders received $90,000 in debt payments, and \"relatives and friends\" of the Dakota received $110,000.\nIn 1851, two further treaties were negotiated with the Dakota. The first was the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, which was between the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands (or upper bands) of Dakota and the U.S. government. Commissioners Alexander Ramsey and Luke Lea justified the need for the two 1851 Treaties with the Dakota as necessary for \"the overwhelming tide of migration\", although newcomers' numbers on Dakota and Ojibwe land were still relatively small. Because of the desire to open the land to white settlement, and because, as former fur traders, they hoped to use the treaties to recoup debts that they claimed various bands owed to them, Ramsey and other white leaders like Henry Sibley convinced the U.S. government to negotiate the purchase of more Dakota and Ojibwe land.\nAfter the treaty with the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands, the treaty delegation traveled to Mendota to meet with the two lower bands of the Dakota, the Mdewakaton and the Wahpekute. The Mdewakaton and Wahpekute were not as desperate as the upper bands for food and goods, but faced the threat of their lands being surrounded by white colonists. The negotiations referred back to the 1837 treaty, with Ta Oyate Duta and Wabasha III asking for the annuities from the 1837 be paid out before negotiations continued. The bands also wished for a different boundary on the proposed reservation. Negotiations stalled until it was agreed that $30,000 would be paid to the Dakota immediately in place of the 1837 annuity. Eventually, sixty five Dakota leaders signed the treaty. However, many leaders refused to sign traders' papers, which directed the government to first pay debts claimed by the traders using the money promised to the Dakota. Eventually, some Wahpekute leaders agreed to pay traders $90,000 and the Mdewakaton agreed to pay $70,000, with $20,000 to be shared among the seven chiefs. The Dakota were to receive $1,410,000 for their land, most of which would be held in trust.\nThe treaties with the Dakota, with a few changes, were approved by Congress on June 23, 1852. Forty-five leaders of the Wahpekute and Dakota signed the treaty on September 4, 1852.\nThe Dakota ceded much of their land and moved to reservations in western Minnesota. In total between both treaties, the Dakota received $3,750,000 for their land, estimated at about 12 center per acre, to be paid over several decades.\nTreaty\nThe text of the treaty is as follows:\nARTICLE 1.\nThe peace and friendship existing between the United States and the Med-ay-wa-kan-toan and Wah-pay-koo-tay bands of Dakota or Sioux Indians shall be perpetual.\nARTICLE 2.\nThe said Med-ay-wa-kan-toan and Wah-pay-koo-tay bands of Indians do hereby cede and relinquish all their lands and all their right, title and claim to any lands whatever, in the Territory of Minnesota, or in the State of Iowa.\nARTICLE 3.\n[Stricken out.] (see end of section and note contribution to the Dakota War of 1862)\nARTICLE 4.\nIn further and full consideration of said cession and relinquishment, the United States agree to pay to said Indians the sum of one million four hundred and ten thousand dollars, ($1,410,000) at the several times, in the manner and for the purposes following, to wit:\n* 1st.

Randall, Sr.; A. S. H. White; H. L. Dousman; Frederic B. Sibley; Marten McLeod; Geo. H. Faribault.\nTo the Indian names are subjoined marks.\nSUPPLEMENTAL ARTICLE.\n1st. The United States do hereby stipulate to pay the Sioux bands of Indians, parties to this treaty, at the rate of ten cents per acre, for the lands included in the reservation provided for in the third article of the treaty as originally agreed upon in the following words:\nARTICLE 3.\n\"In part consideration of the foregoing cession and relinquishment, the United States do hereby set apart for the future occupancy and home of the Dakota Indians, parties to this treaty, to be held by them as Indian lands are held, a tract of country of the average width of ten miles on either side of the Minnesota River, and bounded on the west by the Tchaytam-bay and Yellow Medicine Rivers, and on the east by the Little Rock River and a line running due south from its mouth to the Waraju River; the boundaries of said tract to be marked out by as straight lines as practicable, whenever and in such manner as the President of the United States shall direct: Provided, That said tract shall be held and occupied by said bands in common, and that they shall hereafter participate equally and alike, in all the benefits derived from any former treaty between said bands, or either of them, and the United States,\" which article has been stricken out of the treaty by the Senate. The said payment to be in lieu of said reservation; the amount, when ascertained under instructions from the Department of the Interior, to be added to the trust fund provided for in the fourth article.\n2d. It is further stipulated that the President be authorized, with the assent of the said bands of Indians, parties to this treaty, and as soon after they shall have given their assent to the foregoing article, as may be convenient, to cause to be set apart by appropriate landmarks and boundaries, such tracts of country without the limits of the cession made by the first article of the treaty as may be satisfactory for their future occupancy and home: Provided, That the President may, by the consent of these Indians, vary the conditions aforesaid if deemed expedient.\nContribution to the Dakota War of 1862\nThe treaty, and disputes over its implementation, was a major contributor the Dakota War of 1862 between the U.S. and the Sioux. Following the stricken article 3 in both this treaty and Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, along with late payments the Dakota in due reasons ranging from corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and costs of the U.S. Civil War, the Dakota felt cheated in their dealings with U.S. In 1862, annuities were delayed due to tardy Congressional appropriation, and due to a treasury debate over whether to pay the Dakota in paper currency or gold. The money usually arrived in late June, and did not arrive in St. Paul until August 16, 1862. Corruption also played a role. Bishop Whipple wrote to Washington D.C several times, and President Lincoln dispatched John Hay to investigate, concluding that agents working for Superintendent Major Cullen in particular, \"have become rich\".\nMany Dakota were forced to shift from a nomadic culture into a fixed one, with Minnesota leaders advocating for the adoption of farming, especially due to the decline of the fur trade. Additionally, the reservation land that was seemingly guaranteed to be their own was further diminished by half in the 1858 Dakota Treaty. Many Dakota felt like their land was increasingly encroached upon by the American government and businesses, notably after Minnesota was admitted as a state of the Union in 1858.\nThe widespread sense that the Dakota has been cheated fueled anger and discontent and eventually helped trigger the Dakota War of 1862.\nSee also\n*Treaty of St. Peters\n*Treaty of Traverse des Sioux\nGeneral references\n*Meyer, Roy Willard.
