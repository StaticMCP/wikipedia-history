Most of the tropical cyclones formed between May and November. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator between 100°E and the International Date Line. This area, called the Western Pacific basin, is the responsibility of the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA). They host and operate the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC), located in Tokyo. The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) is also responsible for assigning names to all tropical storms that are formed within the basin. However, any storm that enters or forms in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) will be named (or renamed) by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) using a local name. Also of note -  the Western Pacific basin is monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which gives all Tropical depressions a number with a \"W\" suffix.\nDuring the season, a total of 36 systems were designated as Tropical Depressions, as determined by the following Meteorological organizations: the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA); the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC); or one of various other reporting agencies, such as the China Meteorological Administration, or the Hong Kong Observatory. Throughout the 2015 season, 13 systems entered or formed in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), with six of them making landfall directly over the Philippines.\nThe first five months of the season were unusually active and intense due to a developing El Niño. Mekkhala became an early-forming storm of the season and affected the Philippines. Typhoon Higos formed a month after Mekkhala, reaching its peak intensity as a Category 4 typhoon. Higos broke the record as the most intense storm and the easternmost forming storm within the basin during the month of February until Typhoon Wutip in 2019. During the end of next month, Typhoon Maysak reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 super typhoon with a minimum pressure of 910 millibars, which became the strongest typhoon before the month of April, however Noul became the strongest in terms of windspeeds two months after. In additional, when Dolphin was named on May 9, it became the earliest seventh named storm to form within the basin since 1971. So far this year, ten typhoons underwent rapid deepening.\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:1020 height:290\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:2 left:30 top:58
