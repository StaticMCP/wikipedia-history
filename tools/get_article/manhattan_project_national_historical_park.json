The park consists of three units: one in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, one in Los Alamos, New Mexico and one in Hanford, Washington. It was established on November 10, 2015 when Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz signed the memorandum of agreement that defined the roles that the two agencies had when managing the park.\nThe Department of Energy had owned and managed most of the properties located within the three different sites. For over ten years, the DoE worked with the National Park Service and federal, state and local governments and agencies with the intention of turning places of importance into a National Historical Park. After several years of surveying the three sites and five other possible alternatives, the two agencies officially recommended a historical park be established in Hanford, Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.\nThe Department of Energy would continue to manage and own the sites while the National Park Service would provide interpretive services, visitor centers and park rangers. After two unsuccessful attempts at passing a bill in Congress authorizing the park in 2012 and 2013, the House and Senate ultimately passed the bill in December 2014, with President Obama signing the National Defense Authorization Act shortly thereafter which authorized the Manhattan Project National Historical Park.\nSites\nThe Manhattan Project National Historical Park protects many structures associated with the Manhattan Project, but only some are open for touring.\nHanford, Washington\n* B Reactor National Historic Landmark – bus tours are available by advance reservation\n* the previous Hanford High School in the former Town of Hanford and Hanford Construction Camp Historic District\n*  Bruggemann's Agricultural Warehouse Complex\n*  White Bluffs Bank and Hanford Irrigation District Pump House\nLos Alamos, New Mexico\nThe Los Alamos Visitor Center for the Manhattan Project NHP is located at 475 20th Street in downtown Los Alamos.
