In its sixth season under head coach Lisle Blackbourn, the team compiled a 3–6 record and was outscored by a total of 202 to 101. The team played its home games at Marquette Stadium in Milwaukee.\nOn December 9, 1960, Marquette announced that, after 78 years of intercollegiate football at Marquette, the sport was being dropped. The university's president, Very Rev. Edward J. O'Donnell noted that the football program had lost $50,000 in the past year and that there was a \"reasonable unwillingness to accept the financial hardships imposed by these two sports [football and track] in the light of the other needs of the university.\" The decision led to a protest by 3,000 students. Coach Lisle called the decision a \"terrible mistake\" and stated that he was not asked to sit in on any of the meetings and was surprised by the decision.\n|October 29|at|Holy Cross|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|L 0-20|8,000|\n||at|Detroit|University of Detroit Stadium|Detroit, MI|L 12-32|12,256|\n|November 12||Cincinnati|Marquette Stadium|Milwaukee, WI|L 13-33|11,200|\n}}\nNotable players\n*George Andrie, junior\nReferences"
