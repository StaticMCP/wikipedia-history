The kingdom was centered on modern-day Pakistan and India, and the family held jurisdiction over the Indian Ocean in the east, the Himalayas in the north, the Hindu Kush in the northwest, and multiple city-states beyond.\nFounded in 1526 by Babur, the first Mughal Emperor, the House of Babur ruled over much of South Asia and parts of the Middle East until the early 18th century, thereafter continuing their roles as imperial suzerains until 1857. At the dynasty’s height under Akbar the Great in the 16th and early 17th centuries, the Mughal Empire was one of the largest empires in history, with the family itself being the richest in the world. Later commanding the world’s largest military under Emperor Aurangzeb, the Mughal Dynasty was the foremost global power in the region.\nThe Dynasty traces its origins from the imperial clans of the Barlas and Borjigin, which ruled the Mongol Empire and its successor states. Emperor Babur himself (b. 1483) was a direct descendant of the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (1336–1405) on his father's side, and of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan on his mother's side. Later descendants genealogically held Persian and Indian heritage as well, since Mughal Royals often pursued marriage alliances with noble houses throughout Persia and India.\nFor most of the Mughal dynasty's history, the throne of the Mughal Empire was continuously occupied by a singular Emperor who functioned as the absolute head of state, government, and military. Largely secular, Mughal Court ceremonies saw not just Muslim elites but also prominent Maratha, Rajput, and Sikh leaders acknowledging the Emperor as the region's sole ruler. Later in the dynasty’s history, much of the power shifted to the office of the Grand Vizier as the empire became divided into many regional kingdoms and princely states. As a consequence, the dynasty also produced the Nawabs (nobles) of Hyderabad, Delhi, Kashmir, Lahore, Lucknow, Aligarh, Dhaka, and Bengal. During this time, the family fragmented into several branches, most consequentially in the mid-18th century between its Indian and Persian-Pakistani branches following the exile of the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah II.\nName\nHistory\nThe Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur, a Timurid Prince, from Andijan, which is in Uzbekistan today. First establishing himself in Kabul, Afghanistan, and declaring kingship, Babur later marched towards the Indian subcontinent, ultimately taking control over a greater portion of Asia and crowning himself Emperor. The Mughal imperial structure was founded by Akbar the Great, grandson of Babur, around the 1580s which lasted until the 1740s, until shortly after the Battle of Karnal. Many of the Mughals had significant Indian and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances as they often married and were born to Persian princesses.\nMughal rule was interrupted for about 16 years by the Sur Emperors during Emperor Humayun's reign, however, he resumed control of the region again in 1555. During the reigns of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, the dynasty reached its zenith in terms of geographical extent, economical prosperity, military might, and cultural influence. At that time, the Mughal Empire was the wealthiest empire in the world with the largest military on earth,  and the Mughal Family controlled approximately 24% of the world's economy, an army of over a million soldiers, and over 160 million subjects; approximately 23% percent of the world's population.\nMughals played a great role in the flourishing of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb (Indo-Islamic Civilization). As patrons of art, culture, literature and architecture, the Dynasty oversaw the evolution of ancient Indian paintings, architecture, culture, clothing, cuisine and the Urdu language. Mughal Emperors themselves were incredibly passionate about the arts. Emperor Babur, Aurangzeb and Shah Alam II were great calligraphers, Jahangir was a great painter, Shah Jahan was a great architect while Bahadur Shah II was a great poet of Urdu. Famed Russian linguist and physicist, Vladimir Braginskiĭ, also believed that the Hikayat Aceh literature from Aceh Sultanate were influenced by Mughal dynasty historiography, as he found out the literal structure similarities of Hikayat Aceh with Mahfuzat-i-Timuri, as the former has shared the similar theme with the latter about the lifetime and exploits of the protagonist of Mahfuzat-i-Timuri, Timur. Braginskiĭ also found the similarities in structure of both Hikayat Aceh and Mahfuzat-i-Timuri with Akbarnama manuscript.\nWith the arrival of the British East India Company, the Dynasty's power rapidly dwindled during the 18th century, exacerbated by internal dynastic conflicts, incompatible monarchs, foreign invasions from the Persians and Afghans, as well as revolts from the Marathas, Sikh, Rajputs, and other regional nobilities. Eventually, the power of the last Mughal Emperor was reduced only to the Walled city of Delhi.\n; represents all the descendants mentioned in written sources and verbal sources found and researched in the New Era. Contains male issues only.]]As the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah II () was tried and convicted by the British East India Company before sentenced to exile in Rangoon, situated in British-controlled Burma (present-day Myanmar). The imperial family was hence abolished, and the empire was dissolved on 21 September 1857 after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The UK declared the establishment of the British Colonial rule the following year.\nSuccession to the throne\nto Aurangzeb, with the Mughal ancestor Timur seated in the middle.

Created ]]\nEvery male member of the dynasty was hypothetically eligible to become Emperor. Even though an heir-apparent was appointed several times in the dynasty's history, the certain processes through which imperial princes rose to the Peacock Throne, however, were very specific to each Emperor. For greater detail about these processes, the history of succession between Emperors can be divided into two eras: Era of Imperial successions (1526–1713) and Era of Regent successions (1713–1857).\nDisputed headship of dynasty\nThe Mughal Emperors practiced polygamy. Besides their many wives, they also had several concubines in their harem, who produced many children that would grow to inherit incredibly diverse titles, many different surnames (as royal names were often chosen personally with reference to meaning, not parental identity) and enjoyed many different noble statuses. Tracing the lineages of all offsprings of each Emperor with certainty is hence incredibly difficult. However, many have claimed to be descendants of the last Mughal Emperor:\n* A man in India named Habeebuddin Tucy claims to be a descendant of Bahadur Shah II. His claim is not universally believed.\n* Another Indian woman named Sultana Begum, who lives in the slums of Kolkata, has claimed that her late husband, Mirza Mohammad Bedar Bakht was the great-grandson of Bahadur Shah II.\n* Yaqoob Ziauddin Tucy also claims to be a sixth generation descendant of Bahadur Shah II. Currently living in Hyderabad, he has been involved in numerous disputes with the Indian Government to have the properties of the erstwhile Mughals released to their legal heirs. Tucy also demands the restoration of the scholarships that supported Mughal descendants after 15 August, 1947, and were discontinued by the government in May of 2004. Additionally, Tucy demands that amount be raised to , and that the government provides economically distressed Indian Mughal descendants grants to elevate the damage done to the family after their wealth was confiscated by the Indian Government. Tucy has two sons and a younger brother, Shajeeuddin Tucy.\n* Shajeeuddin Tucy was a member of the Indian Air Force. Even though his family is not recognised by the government as being of Mughal descent, he had been a state guest to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, along with his two elder brothers on one occasion. He also frequently travels to the Middle East and central Asia as part of a self-funded campaign that is not affiliated with, upon the invitation of, or supported by the governments of India, Pakistan, or any other country of the Middle East. He lives in Hyderabad along with his two sons Yaqoob Muzammiluddin Tucy and Yaqoob Mudassiruddin Tucy.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
