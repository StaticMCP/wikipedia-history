He was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL draft. He played college football for the Utah Utes.\nWarren was also a member of the Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints, and Florida Tuskers.\nCollege career\nOregon\nWarren played his freshman season at the University of Oregon in 2001, catching no passes but recording six special teams tackles. After his redshirt freshman year he transferred to the University of Utah.\nUtah\nWarren attended the University of Utah and was a two-year starter under head coach Urban Meyer after playing at Grant Union High School. In his senior year, Warren played a key part in the Utah Utes offense, as they went 12–0 and became the first BCS non-AQ conference team to play in a Bowl Championship Series bowl game. Utah defeated the Big East Conference champion Pittsburgh Panthers 35–7 to become the 2005 Fiesta Bowl champions. Against Pittsburgh, Warren was part of a rare trick play called the hook-and-ladder, or hook and lateral, in which quarterback Alex Smith threw a short pass to wide out Steve Savoy who then lateraled the ball to Warren. Warren proceeded to carry the ball into the endzone from just inside the Panthers 20-yard line. Warren finished the game with a Fiesta Bowl-record 15 receptions and 198 yards. Warren's 80 catches in a season in 2004–05 remains the Utah single season record.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! YEAR\n! REC\n! YDS\n! AVG\n! LNG\n! TD\n! ATT\n! YDS\n! AVG\n! LNG\n!
