The league was formed in 1976 by a handful of vocational schools in central Massachusetts, and grew to nine vocational and charter schools across the Worcester and Middlesex Counties.\nThe league would fold in 2025 after merging with the Central Massachusetts Conference, Dual Valley Conference, Inter-High League, and the Southern Worcester County League to form the Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference.\nHistory\n|zoom=9               |nolabels=1|mark-coord=|mark-coord1=|mark=blue pog.svg|label=Abby Kelley Foster|label-color=black|label-pos=top|mark1=blue pog.svg|label1=AMSA|label-color1=black|label-pos1=bottom|mark-coord2=|mark2=blue pog.svg|label2=Assabet|label-color2=black|label-pos2=top|mark-coord3=|mark3=blue pog.svg|label3=Bay Path|label-color3=black|label-pos3=bottom|mark-coord4=|label4=Blackstone Valley|label-color4=black|label-pos4=BOTTOM|mark-coord5=|mark5=blue pog.svg|label5=Keefe|mark4=blue pog.svg|label-color5=black|label-pos5=bottom|mark-coord6=|mark6=blue pog.svg|label6=Montachusett|label-color6=black|label-pos6=bottom|mark-coord7=|mark7=blue pog.svg|label7=Francis W.

The creation of the conference was a way for Vocational Schools in Central Massachusetts to play each other in their own league.\nIn 1977, the league accepted their first new member in Worcester Tech (then Worcester Voke) who was already member of the Inter-High League. They stayed a part of the Inter-High while in the Colonial therefore allowing them to compete for two league titles. They did this up until at least 2011, where they became full members of the Colonial.  In 1979, Tri-County RVT joined having been founded only two years prior.{{Cite news |date=October 2, 1979 |title=Football Standings, this week's schedule |work=Minuteman (who would straddle both the Colonial and Commonwealth leagues for around a decade, before becoming a full time Commonwealth member), and the first non-vocational school, Murdock. Murdock would end up leaving for the more prestigious Mid-Wach around 1995 to join other public schools. During the same time, Nashoba Valley Tech also left, heading to the Commonwealth Conference. Replacing them was Blackstone Valley Tech, who had been a part of the Dual Valley Conference since its inception.\nDuring the 2000-01 school year, Hudson Catholic left the Catholic Suburban League for the Colonial; this was due to certain schools dominating the league and travel time between schools being too great. They would stay a part of the conference until they closed in 2009.\nAs the 2010s rolled around, Charter Schools began joining the league. Parker Charter was the first, around 2010, and Abby Kelley Foster and AMSA would jump from the Worcester County Athletic Conference in 2015. The league did not have any further changes until its ending in 2025.\nFormer Members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!School\n!Location\n!Mascot\n!Colors\n!Year Founded\n!Year Left\n!Current Conference\n|-\n!Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School\n|Worcester, Massachusetts\n|Bears\n|Maroon & Gold\n|1998\n|2025\n|Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference\n|-\n!Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School\n|Marlborough, Massachusetts\n|Eagles\n|Navy Blue, Orange, & White\n|2005\n|2025\n|Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference\n|-\n!Assabet Valley Regional Technical High School\n|Marlborough, Massachusetts\n|Aztecs\n|Blue & Gold\n|1973\n|2025\n|Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference\n|-\n!Bay Path Regional Vocational Technical High School\n|Charlton, Massachusetts\n|Minutemen\n|Purple & Gold\n|1972\n|2025\n|Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference\n|-\n!Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School\n|Upton, Massachusetts\n|Beavers\n|Purple, Black, & White\n|1964\n|2025\n|Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference\n|-\n!Keefe Technical High School\n|Framingham, Massachusetts\n|Broncos\n|Blue & Orange\n|1967\n|2025\n|Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference\n|-\n!Montachusett Regional Vocational Technical School\n|Fitchburg, Massachusetts\n|Bulldogs\n|Purple & Gold\n|1965\n|2025\n|Central Massachusetts Athletic Conference\n|-\n!Francis W.

From 1972 to 1977 and from 1997 to 2008, it was split between Eastern Mass and Central/Western Mass and there would be two champions in each division. From 1978 to 1996 and from 2009 to 2012 Central and Western Mass split so there would be three champions in each division. In 2013 everything was combined and therefore only allowed one state champion per division.\n* Assabet - 1983 D3 Central; 2008 D3A Central/Western\n* Bay Path - 2000, 2001 D3A Central/Western; 2011 D6 Central\n* Blackstone Valley - 2007 D3A Central/Western; 2012 D6 Central; 2018 D7\nCross country\nSource:\nBoys\n* Parker Charter - 2017 D2; 2021, 2023 D3\nFall swimming\nSource:\nBoys\n* Advanced Math and Science - 2017 D2\nBasketball\nSource:\nBoys\n* Worcester Tech - 2019 D4\nSoftball\nSource:\n* Assabet - 2013 D3\nTennis\nSource:\nGirls\n* Advanced Math and Science - 2021 D3\nExternal links\nSchool websites\n* [https://www.akfcs.org/ Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School]\n* [https://www.amsacs.org/ Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School]\n* [https://www.assabet.org/ Assabet Valley Regional Technical High School]\n* [http://www.baypath.net/ Bay Path Regional Vocational Technical High School]\n* [https://www.valleytech.k12.ma.us/ Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School]\n* [https://www.keefetech.org/ Keefe Technical High School]\n* [https://www.montytech.net/ Montachusett Regional Vocational Technical High School]\n* [https://www.theparkerschool.org/ Francis W.
