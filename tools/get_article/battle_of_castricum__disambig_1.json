The battle was fought during the War of the Second Coalition against Revolutionary France between FrenchBatavian forces under the command of General Guillaume Brune (commander-in-chief) and Herman Willem Daendels, Jean Boudet and General Bonnom.}} and BritishRussian forces under the command of the Duke of York (commander-in-chief) and Ivan Essen..}} The Castricum battle and its strategic outcome put an end to any hopes for the invasion's success.\nAt the Battle of Bergen on 19 September 1799, Brune defeated the Anglo-Russian forces piecemeal. At the battle of Castricum, in accordance with York's dispositions, the Russians launched an offensive in the center and pushed back the numerically inferior French advance units, dislodging them from their strong position around the village of Bakkum. However, they were soon counterattacked by Brune, who quickly concentrated far superior forces and recaptured the position, inflicting heavy losses. The Russians barely held out, but the arrival of British reinforcements halted the advance of the exhausted French and Batavians, and the inspired Russians pushed them back behind that position. Brune failed to defeat the Russians and the British alternately.\nDespite this, the joint final offensive by York's British and Russians stalled on the heights where Brune had managed to organize his troops. Ralph Abercromby's British arrived late on the coastal flank, for which Abercromby was criticized; they were driven back twice by the French units and suffered heavy losses. On Brune's right flank, the Batavians were attacked by British forces and were pushed back from their advanced positions in the villages of Limmen and Akersloot, but the outcome of this clash remained indecisive. Brune's behavior showed him to be a capable military commander.\nBackground\nAn Anglo-Russian force of 32,000 men landed in North Holland on August 27, 1799, captured a Batavian Navy fleet at Den Helder on August 30 and the city of Alkmaar on October 3. Following a series of battles at Bergen on September 19 and Alkmaar on October 2 (also known as 2nd Bergen), they faced the French and Batavian armies at Castricum on October 6.\nActions\nInitial action\nYork decided to advance his troops. The Coalition command began to act according to the disposition. The battle began at 8 AM. The Russian vanguard, commanded by Major General Alexander Sedmoratsky, consisting of 6 battalions and 7 guns, drove some of the French troops out of the fortifications of Bakkum, which were armed with artillery. As a result, the Russians captured the village. French Brigadier General Michel Pacthod, retreating to the village of Castricum, assembled the 43rd demi-brigade consisting of 3 battalions. Russian battalions attacked from the front under the cover of artillery, while grenadiers and part of the jaegers occupied sandy heights on the right to fire upon the village. Threatened by encirclement, the French retreated behind Castricum into gardens and onto sandy hillocks.\nOn the opposite wing, Lieutenant General Dundas' 2 British brigades under the command of Maj. Gen. Harry Burrard and Maj. Gen. Eyre Coote moved from Alkmaar to Akersloot, driving out 2 Batavian battalions and taking about 100 prisoners of war. They occupied Akerlsloot and Limmen, receiving orders to stop and defend.\nSecond phase\nBrune, upon learning of the encounter, initially intended to defend his positions and gave corresponding orders. However, noticing Sedmoratsky's isolation, he decided to go on the offensive. As at Bergen, the British did not hurry to assist; on the French left flank, where Lt. Gen. Abercromby's units were supposed to strike, everything was calm at this time. The French division under Divisional general Jean Boudet advanced, connected with Pacthod, and attacked the Russian vanguard. Sedmoratsky had 2 battalions in Castricum, the artillery in front of Castricum and 3 other battalions on the heights, firstly from Benkendorff regiment, secondly of combined grenadiers of Ericson regt.\nMajor General Essen was in Egmond-Binnen, awaiting news from Sedmoratsky, which took a long time to arrive—the sounds of gunfire were inaudible due to a strong northern wind, blowing in the opposite direction. Sedmoratsky had no aides-de-camp on horseback and was on foot himself. Finally, upon learning about the situation, Essen sent Colonel Alexander Dubiansky with 3 combined grenadier battalions and 6 guns. However, this reinforcement was insignificant compared to Brune's forces—he had 11 battalions with artillery and cavalry support. The Russians fought stubbornly, holding out for 3 hours while being pressed from two flanks. Castricum changed hands repeatedly multiple times. Essen arrived on the battlefield and ordered Emme and Zherebtsov regiments to hurry (the commander of the Zherebtsov regiment himself had already died in the Battle of Bergen). The British's cautiousness on the flanks (or the Russians' intensity in the central position; or both; one way or another, the Russians acted according to York's disposition) allowed Brune to add reinforcements in the form of several battalions from Bonnom's Batavian division and reserves in Beverwijk; these troops were formed into a tight column and attacked with bayonets. The Russians suffered significant losses and were driven from their heights. A powder storm fell upon Castricum; Russian guns fell silent, their crews were killed, and cavalry also suffered losses. The French broke into the village from several sides, annihilating Russians and capturing their guns.\nExhausted and disordered, the French pursued only weakly as the Russians retreated in a single column through a narrow pass. Dubiansky, standing in the Russian rear guard with 3 battalions of grenadiers, temporarily halted the French pursuit and even counterattacked. But the grenadiers went too far. Dubiansky said about this, namely, \"anyone who knows a Russian soldier understands that after his first success he cannot stand still.\" Captain Loven with 2 battalions of grenadiers briefly broke into Castricum but suffered heavy losses and soon found himself surrounded by the French on both sides; he and Dubiansky were both captured, as well as Lieutenant of the Artillery Riabikov and some other officers. Essen sent one aide-de-camp after another to Abercromby, but he acted at his own pace. The Duke of York gave the order for a general attack; had Abercromby acted more quickly, he could have better balanced the manpower in time by drawing some French units towards him. Although he was eventually able to do so, by that point the Russians had already suffered significant casualties; fortunately for the allies, the Russians remained intact, which allowed the allies not to be defeated in detail as at Bergen, while the French became exhausted by attacking strong Russian foothold. Brune was strengthening his positions, so delaying was a flaw.\nBritish aid to Russians\nFinally, the British vanguard approached the battlefield around 3 PM. But the British were late. French Divisional general Louis Gouvion was already prepared to meet them: Aubrée's brigade was positioned at the seaside heights of Bakkum, Simon's brigade was in the middle of the dune, while Gouvion himself remained behind the first brigade with a reserve of 3 battalions. The British vanguard encountered a concealed artillery battery, suffered heavy losses, and retreated as far as Egmond aan Zee. Then Abercromby deployed his main forces and pushed the pressing French back again to the heights of Bakkum. He himself moved with 1 brigade from the seaside through the dunes to Bakkum, while the other 2 brigades with the vanguard were deployed against Gouvion. With Abercromby's helpful actions, Essen managed to deploy his troops behind Bakkum across the road. A fierce battle once again ensued between the Russians and the French on the sandy hills. Exhausted and almost out of ammunition, the Russians barely held their ground when the British column finally arrived at 5 PM. The French, as is known, were also exhausted. Supported and encouraged by a parallel British offensive of Lt. Gen. Abercromby, the Russians charged with bayonets and pushed the French back beyond Bakkum, continuing to pressure them.\nHowever, Brune managed to position his troops on the heights of Castricum. French Divisional general Dominique Vandamme stood at the head of all the French divisions, as well as the reserve; he deployed some of his infantry to meet the Anglo-Russian forces, while Brune led the Batavian hussars in an attack against the British dragoon regiment flanking from the dunes; thus the allies' advance was halted. The Russians had a foothold at Bakkum, and the French had at Castricum. Only the marshy Schilpwater River separated the opponents. The fighting was fierce on both flanks, but not as intense as in the center. In the dunes, Gouvion's French forces gained the upper hand over the British, but Abercromby's personal arrival halted their advance. After that, there was only sporadic gunfire. On the opposite wing, the British fought with varying success—victory shifted back and forth.82}}\nDarkness fell, bringing an end to the bloodshed on all fronts. Ultimately, the French were forced back to Castricum by the Russians, while the Batavians retreated to their previous position. The allies gained only villages of Bakkum, Limmen, and Akerlsloot by the end of the day, at a high cost. According to D. Milyutin's claim, about 2,500 men were casualties on the British and Russian side, while the Republicans suffered \"no less damage\" in his view. Milyutin also cites the French estimate of casualties at 1,384 men and A.-H. Jomini's statement, who \"believes\" that the French lost up to 2,000. The Duke reported to Paul I that the Russians were overly \"impetuous,\" without admitting guilt on the part of the British command. Less than half of the Anglo-Russian forces that landed in Holland remained in their field army. There were issues with Anglo-Russian supplies. In the autumn's inclement weather, the number of sick increased. Generals Abercromby, Pulteney and Dundas suggested retreating to Zijpe to await reinforcements from London. Before the battle, the Duke hoped that the anticipated success at Castricum would change the situation, but subsequent events proved otherwise, resulting in the flight of both the British and Russians from the battlefield of Castricum.82, 8286}}\nDepictions of distinguished commanders\nFile:Portret van Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune, RP-P-1906-3374.jpg|Guillaume Brune\nFile:Louis Jean Baptiste Gouvion (1752-1823).jpg|Louis Gouvion\nFile:Dubyansky Alexander Yakovlevich (1771-1851).jpg|Alexander Dubiansky (Dubyansky)\nAftermath\nAt Castricum, the Russo-British allies lost 2,536 men, or up to 2,557, including 1,400+ British and 1,100+ Russians, and 11 guns (out of the 21,100 engaged), while the Batavian-French losses stood at 1,382 or 1,384 (out of the 19,000 engaged). The defeat persuaded the Duke that his position was untenable. After a chaotic retreat, the parties signed the Convention of Alkmaar on October 10.\nThe British and Russians were allowed to withdraw from Holland, without paying reparations, and retaining captured bounty. As a sign of gratitude for enabling him honourably to emerge from the inglorious Dutch imbroglio, Brune received a number of horses from the Duke. By 19 November all the British and Russian troops had been embarked and the expedition was over. In the years following the 1799 invasion, defensive lines were constructed in Holland to protect Amsterdam from future invasions from the north.\nCommemoration\nIn the Huis met de Kogel (House with the Cannonball) in Alkmaar, a cannonball that got stuck in the wall during the battle can still be seen. A plaque beneath the cannonball commemorates the battle. Various locality names in Castricum also provide a reminder of the battle, like the Russenbergen dunes and the Doodelaan street. The Russisch Monument in Bergen marks the fighting there. The French victory was also commemorated on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris as \"Alkmaer\".\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://home.planet.nl/~pdavis/Denhelder.htm Anglo-Russian invasion of North Holland (1799)]\n* [http://home.planet.nl/~awaan/Noord_Holland_1799/noord_holland_1799.html Noord-Holland 1799] (in Dutch)\n* [http://members.chello.nl/krom1/10__de_engels-russische_inval.htm De Engels-Russische inval]  (in Dutch)"
