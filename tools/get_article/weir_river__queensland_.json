The river continues through the Booroondoo State Forest then crosses the Leichhardt Highway, flows past Currajong and Goodar and then veers west. It continues running almost parallel with the Barwon Highway near Bungunya then later veers south west, again crossing the highway just east of Talwood. It flows through the Wanda Wanda Waterhole then continues south west until discharging into the Barwon River northeast of Mungindi on the border between Queensland and New South Wales. The river descends  over its  course.\nThe Weir, Macintyre, Dumaresq and the Queensland branch of the Severn and the New South Wales branch of the Severn rivers are known as the Border Rivers that straddle the Queensland and New South Wales border and feed into the Murray-Darling Basin.
