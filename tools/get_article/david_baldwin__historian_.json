Before retiring from teaching, Baldwin had previously worked as a lecturer at both the University of Leicester and the University of Nottingham. In 1986, over 25 years before the 2012 excavation and the discovery of the king's body, he predicted that Richard III's remains would be found at Greyfriars, Leicester.\nIn his 2010 book, Robin Hood: The English Outlaw Unmasked, Baldwin argued  that the 'real' Robin Hood was Roger Godberd, a disinherited supporter of Simon de Montfort. He drew attention to the many similarities between Godberd's career and the stories told of Robin in the earliest ballads, and to a grave slab in Loxley churchyard in Warwickshire which appeared to be identical to one associated with Robin in earlier centuries.\nIn his 2007 book, The Lost Prince: The Survival of Richard of York, Baldwin discussed the possibility that the younger of the Princes in the Tower, Prince Richard, survived, and was the \"Richard Plantagenet\" who died in December 1550 at Eastwell in Kent. Richard had worked as a bricklayer at St. John's Abbey, Colchester, until 1539, but, unusually for someone of his class, could read Latin. He is sometimes said to have been an illegitimate son of King Richard III.\nBaldwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2012.\nA religious man, Baldwin was a member of a Christadelphian congregation in Leicester.\nWorks\nBaldwin was the author of several books and contributed to a number of historical journals. In addition to teaching at Leicester and Nottingham Universities, he professionally lectured for societies and conferences.\n*[http://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/BaldwinSmPagesfromvolumeLX-5.pdf \"King Richard's Grave in Leicester\"], Transactions of the Leicester Archaeological and Historical Society; Volume 60, (1986)\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elizabeth-Woodville-David-Baldwin/dp/0750938862/ref=la_B001HCUQOA_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1376864834&sr=1-2 Elizabeth Woodville], The History Press: 2004 –\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kingmakers-Sisters-Powerful-Women-Roses/dp/0750950765/ref=la_B001HCUQOA_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1376864834&sr=1-4 ''The Kingmaker's Sisters: Six Powerful Women in the Wars of the Roses], The History Press: 2006 –\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stoke-Field-Last-Battle-Roses/dp/1844151662/ref=la_B001HCUQOA_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1376864834&sr=1-3 Stoke Field: The Last Battle of the Wars of the Roses], Pen and Sword Books: 2006 –\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Prince-Survival-Richard-York/dp/0750943351/ref=la_B001HCUQOA_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1376864834&sr=1-5 The Lost Prince: The Survival of Richard of York], The History Press: 2007 –\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Robin-Hood-English-Outlaw-Unmasked/dp/1848683782/ref=la_B001HCUQOA_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1376864834&sr=1-6 Robin Hood: The English Outlaw Unmasked], Amberley Publishing: 2010 –\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Richard-III-David-Baldwin/dp/1445601826 Richard III], Amberley Publishing: 2012 –\n*The Women of the Cousins' War: The Duchess, the Queen and the King's Mother, with Philippa Gregory and Michael Jones, Simon & Schuster:2012 –\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130810083447/https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/23574430 The White Queen – What happened to the Princes in the Tower?], BBC History, 9 August 2013.\n* Richard III.
