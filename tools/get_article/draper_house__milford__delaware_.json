It was built in 1870, and is a two-story, five-bay, center hall, frame dwelling originally built in the Victorian Gothic style.  It was remodeled in the early-20th century with elements of Queen Anne and Classical Revival building traditions.  It has a hipped roof with dormers, a telescoping turret, a truncated tower, a second floor projecting bay with a Palladian window, and a full three-sided porch with a shadow curve supported by Ionic order columns. From 1948 to 1953, it was owned by the Milford Hospital and used by them as housing for nurses.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences"
