Both invasions were repelled by Malacca.\nPrelude\nThe Malacca Sultanate established a relationship with the Ming dynasty around the 15th century. The Chinese explorer, admiral and diplomat Zheng He, who came to support Malacca and make them a tributary of China. He visited Malacca six times during his voyages and was eventually sent to Malacca under the service of the Yongle Emperor. When Siam's growing power began to threaten Malacca Ming envoys were sent to Siam to tell them that Malacca was a Ming vassal and thus, there should be not to be to interfered with.\nThe Ming dynasty became isolationist in the mid-15th century, but by this point Malacca was strong enough to protect itself from Siamese attacks. They held off two Siamese attacks, one in 1446 and one in 1456.\nTributaries\n.]]\nBefore the relationship between the Ming dynasty and Malacca, Malacca acknowledged Siam as an overlord and paid tributes to Siam, even before China made allegiances to Malacca. It was observed that after the foundation of Malacca whenever they paid tributes to Siam, Siamese determination led to a clear agreement of allegiance to Malacca, following the previous terms in which the Kingdom of Malacca had paid tribute to Siam during the 15th century. As time went by, tributaries of Ming dynasty came, and the relationship may have been seen as a threat to Siam. The decisions were later regretted following the particular events that happened earlier, and it led to the conclusion of the conflict between Siam and Malacca.\nGoals for Malacca Sultanate\nMalacca organize the objectives and were to reach of its limits throughout the rest of Malay Peninsula. The objectives that were organized aimlessly was about of:\n*Strategic Location\n**The Strait of Malacca were a crucial part where the trading routes connecting to Indian Ocean and South China Sea, attracting other merchants to various of other regions (Middle East, India, China etc.)\n*Adoption of Islam\n**By the ruling elite, Parameswara after the evacuation from Singapore converted to Islam, and eventually taking the name \"Sultan\" forward, providing a unifying force and facilitated trade to other Muslim merchants.\n***Implementation of the Islamic laws in governance and judicial matters.\n*Effective Governance and Islamic Leadership\n**With strong leadership and effective of the governance by the sultans who implemented the policies promoting trade, which attracts to foreign merchants, and establishing a well-organized port administration and the legal system.\nInvasions\nSiamese first attempt of attack\nFrom around 1447, the Siamese had begun and prepared the attacks on Malacca, which were later got thwarted by the Malaccan defensive forces led by Tun Perak.\nBattle of Batu Pahat\nThe  occurred in 1456 after the first failed attempt led by Siam against Malacca. Following their defeat, some commanders of Siam that were involved in the battle surrendered in Batu Pahat and were later sent to Singapore after being repelled by Malaccan resistance forces led by Tun Perak.\nAftermath\nThey successfully drove the enemies away towards to Malacca and thwarted the attack. Subsequently, Malacca seized power in almost the entire Malay Peninsula.\nMuzaffar Shah sincerely ruled Malacca Sultanate during the period, but until his death, his son, Raja Abdullah, at the age of 27, became the Sultan of Malacca. Following Muzaffar Shah's death, Raja Abdullah attacks Pura (Pahang), which was rule by the Maharaja Dewa Sura, a relative and a subject of a king of Siam, but then he was eventually taken as the prisoner of war, and Mansur Shah subsequently ensued to married his daughter, Wanang Sri. Whenever, the commander, Sri Bija Diraja, has been given to rule Pahang. By which, there are follow intimates of the tales regardless to the king of Pahang and were later expertise to mahout.\nTun Perak, who's a treasurer and his military tactics against the foes that he had prevail to dissolve those Siamese troops, about like 2 times from each year, and it is likely under his service of the sultan of Malacca, Muzaffar Shah—he had likely secured about 3 successors of the sultan, which were eventually occupied during the conflict—Sultan Mansur Shah,-1477.}} Ala'ud din-1488.}} and lastly Sultan Mahmud Shah.-1511, and again as a pretender in 1513 until his death at 1528.}} With such an attack that were being repelled led by the siamese which is the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, the same kingdom who causes the conflict and furthermore started the attacks against to Malacca due to multiple factors which the circumstances happened back then when at that time during prelude.\nConclusion\nMalacca Sultanate maintain a strong as the most successful dominant state as a trading center in Southeast Asia because of its strategic location somehow lately, and then the merchants would come to the Malacca as a meeting point, furthermore the following of the Malacca city has connected to the other or the rest of the regions (including the Middle East, China, India and more). Malacca emerged as one of the most influential and prosperous governments of its time, when something clearly happens when all the regions are connected to Malacca and Malacca emerged as one of the most majority for spice trade as a trading center, especially it includes Southeast Asia.\nTributary\nAccording to the History of Ming from the book that it states in 1456, sultan of Malacca Sultanate Muzaffar Shah had sent a tribute to the Ming to be invested as a king, but then again it was later asked if the synchronism between the China and the Siamese chronicles were correct or not, the inferences of Muzaffar Shah, the actions of refrained to even sought recognition to China during the previous decades on the account of which the embroilment with Siamese previously, or lately perhaps of the guilt conscience following of his brother death by murder. He had finally sought Chinese for the recognition to only strengthen his position.\nTriumph\nAccordingly,  from the Malay Annals that every encounter had struck between Siam and Malay is a triumph for the quick wits of the Malays. The administrative position under the command of Paduka Raja Tun Perak ruse and scares the Siamese invaders and the invasion into Siamese retreat, and when later, Malays sent envoys to Siam to propose a truce which are roped by the Siamese attack on a neighboring state and are inhospitably trough in the toughest sector, and Tun Telani invents an excellent reason for their transfer another part of the line.\nReferences\nFootnotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
