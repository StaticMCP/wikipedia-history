Some concerns were noted that San Diego might lack the necessary hotel capacity to host the convention. Nixon preferred San Diego as a host city due to its location 75 miles from his \"Western White House\" in San Clemente, California.\nOther cities bidding had included Miami Beach.\nSan Diego City Council pledged to utilize $600,000 of revenue from the city's motel-hotel tax to help stage the convention.\nFlorida's RNC committee member L. E. Thomas (a supporter of Miami Beach's efforts) lambasted the lack of hotel rooms in San Diego. He forced a roll call vote to be taken on the site selection, which the choice of San Diego won 119–12.\nFearing that the city lacked the hotel rooms, San Diego County Republican committeewoman threatened to seek an injunction to prevent Republicans from holding their convention based upon issues with the use of city motel-hotel tax revenue being utilized to assist the staging of the convention.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/95203012\nNixon gave no official statement of preference in the convention site. But it was widely believed among those voting that Nixon preferred San Diego. https://www.newspapers.com/image/787393511\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/108027222\nBob Dole, RNC chairman, said that the site selection committee recommendation was unanimous. Others alleged there had been a close vote.\nMiami Beach had hosted the 1968 RNC. Louisville had bid for both parties conventions, and both parties sent their site selection committees to visit the city. Both parties regarded Louisville as a strong prospect. However, the Republican Party ultimately narrowed its choices down to San Diego and Miami Beach.\nMiami Beach bid proponents touted its greater supply of first-class hotel accommodations and better geography for blockading the convention site from demonstrators.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/110023817/ and https://www.newspapers.com/image/110023951\nReasons speculated for city selection https://www.newspapers.com/image/787561249\nSelected dates were August 21–24. https://www.newspapers.com/image/787393511\nAfter its selection, initial preparations for a San Diego convention were overseen on President Nixon's behalf by ____ https://www.newspapers.com/image/377246130\nIn San Diego, the convention was to take place at the San Diego Sports Arena.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bids for Republican convention\n|-\n!

Fearing scandal, and citing labor and cost concerns, the GOP transferred the event—scarcely three months before it was to begin—to Miami Beach, also the host city of the Democratic National Convention. This marked the sixth and last time that both national party conventions were held in the same city; Chicago had hosted double conventions in 1884, 1932, 1944 and 1952, and Philadelphia in 1948.\nSan Diego would later go on to host the 1996 Republican National Convention.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/759279293\nSecurity and handling of protests\nduring the Republican convention]]\nin a street during the Republican convention]]\n1968 background, etc. https://www.newspapers.com/image/3005048\nMiami Beach's geographic advantage at controlling demonstrators https://www.newspapers.com/image/3005048\nLaw Enforcement Assistance Administration grant to fund security https://www.newspapers.com/image/3005048\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/625353702\nhttps://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/make-world-safe-picnics-1972-political-conventions-miami-beach\nDemocratic Convention\nhttp://www.floridahistorynetwork.com/july-10-1972---first-of-two-major-party-conventions-opens-in-miami-beach.html\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/327272092\nRiflemen patrolled a secret facility near the convention hall where the convention's credentials materials were stored.\nRepublican Convention\nSan Diego's original planned restrictions on demonstrations. Local attitude supporting these restrictions and disliking protesters. https://www.newspapers.com/image/3005048\nProtest plans state before conventions\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/973151916\nThe Republican convention was targeted for widespread protests, particularly against the Vietnam War, and the Nixon administration made efforts to suppress it. This tension was captured by Top Value Television in the independent documentary Four More Years, which juxtaposes shots of the protests outside the convention with the internal politics of the convention. A day after the convention, The New York Times reported that 900 demonstrators had been arrested, and the police reported that 52 people, including 12 policemen, had been injured.\nThe Republican convention saw roughly twice as many protesters. Additionally, protests were more https://flashbackmiami.com/2016/06/14/republican-national-convention-in-miami-beach-1972/\nIn 2005, files released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation monitored former Beatle John Lennon after he was invited to play for Yippie protests. The surveillance of Lennon later concluded that he was not a dangerous revolutionary, as he was \"constantly under the influence of narcotics.\" The Justice Department indicted Scott Camil, John Kniffen, Alton Foss, Donald Perdue, William Patterson, Stan Michelsen, Peter Mahoney and John Briggs—collectively known as the Gainesville Eight—on charges of conspiracy to disrupt the convention, but all were exonerated.\nOliver Stone's film Born on the Fourth of July, based on Ron Kovic's autobiography of the same name, depicts Kovic and fellow Vietnam Veterans Against the War activists Bobby Muller, Bill Wieman and Mark Clevinger being spat upon at the convention.\nOn the opening night of the Republican convention, hundreds of protesters blocked traffic outside a $500 per-person fancy dress ball held at the Fontainebleau Hotel. Several protesters pelted eventgoers with eggs. Per The Associated Press, large group of nightstick-equipped police officers dispersed this crowd without incident. https://www.newspapers.com/image/865689676\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/816596123 https://www.newspapers.com/image/1095127542\nwww.newspapers.com/image/1135549480\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/demonstrators-disrupt-republican-national-convention-aug-22-1972-227162\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/outside-the-convention-cops-and-confusion-118200/\nhttps://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/05/03/protest-reporting-1972-miami-nixon-republican-convention-pepper-spray\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/886696283/?match=1&terms=hotel%20dnc%20Miami%20\nPreparations of Miami Beach Convention Center\nThe Miami Beach Convention Center had been constructed in 1957, and had been the venue of the 1968 Democratic convention as well as the 1964 Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston boxing match. In 1972, the facility's food concession contract was held by Kentucky Fried Chicken.\nAhead of the conventions,\nThere was some concern that the venue might lose electricity during the Democratic Convention, as the Florida Power & Light was experiencing near-capacity consumption due to demands by air conditioning units in the region. However, the venue had an emergency power supply that retain some lighting in such an event, and the power company claimed that such an outage would would be unlikely.\nIn order to avoid the podium looking identical during the Republican convention as it had during the preceding Democratic convention, organizers reconfigured it. The new configuration protruded further towards the floor seating.\nHotels\nHeadquarters hotels\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/1054144000/?match=1&terms=hotel%20dnc%20Miami%20\nDelegate accommodations\nCandidate hotels\nDemocratic candidate hotels\nCampaigns were able to reserve rooms in advance of the convention. The national committee required campaigns to place a $50 deposit on every room reserved by May 1, otherwise campaigns would relinquish their reservations.\nGeorge McGovern's campaign headquarters were located at the Doral Beach Hotel and the Doral Country Club. Both of these were considered to be luxury resorts. McGovern stayed in a penthouse suite. https://www.newspapers.com/image/87869332 Originally, John Lidnsay had reserved 100 rooms at the hotel. However, after his poor performance in the 1972 Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary, Lindsay cancelled his reserved rooms and McGovern thereafter 75 of those rooms.\nGeorge Wallace (who in the Democratic primaries had placed a distant-second in delegates and third in overall popular vote) received 90 rooms at the Four Ambassadors. This included rooms for the 51 secret service agents assigned to Wallace, who had survived an assassination attempt during his campaign. Wallace stayed in the hotel's \"presidential suite\", for which he was charged a discounted $150 per day. This was half the normal price for the room.\nEdmund Muskie who had placed fourth in the primaries) had his convention headquarters located at the Americana hotel in Bal Harbour, relatively removed from much of the convention activity. Of all the candidates, Shirley Chisholm had the smallest convention headquarters. She was given two small rooms at the Hotel Deauville.\nVance Hartke originally had had space reserved for a campaign headquarters before withdrawing his candidacy. The reservation on this space was then transferred to Terry Sanford who was planning to have his name entered for the convention roll call (which required him to received secure 50 delegate votes from a minimum of three different states).\nRepublican candidate hotels\nOther hotel matters\nMedia\nSouthern Bell Telephone installed 7,000 telephones, 335 typewriters, 40 special switchboard for use by the press. The company used  of wires to install these.\nExperiencing an evident budget crunch, the Democratic National Convention declined to rent typewriters for use by smaller newspapers that didn't rent work space within the convention hall itself.\nThe Republican convention helped set a new template for presidential conventions that would follow. More so than any preceding convention, it was a tightly-scheduled event tailored for television audiences. https://www.life.com/history/a-colorful-historical-look-at-the-republican-national-convention/\nCredentials and tickets\nThe credentials office for the Democratic convention was officially located at the Fontainebleau Hotel. However, as a precaution most credentials work was actually done at a guarded and secret location near the convention hall. Democrats sought to combat counterfeiting of credentials and entry passes by utilizing special paper for daily floor passes.\nTransportation\nDuring the Democratic convention, traffic congestion was an issue along Collins Avenue (Miami Beach's main roadway thoroughfare). To avoid this traffic, during the Democratic Convention the Miami Daily News resorted to chartering a motorboat on the parallel canal to ferry its reporters between hotels and the convention hall.\nRelated events\nReceptions and banquets were held at various locations around Miami Beach during the conventions.\nReferences"
