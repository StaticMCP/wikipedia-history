In March 1794, the Army of the North counted 194,930 soldiers, of which 126,035 men were available for the field. In addition, Pichegru had authority over the subordinate Army of the Ardennes which numbered 32,773 men. The combined total of both armies was 227,703 troops. However, Pichegru was absent during the Battle of Tourcoing, visiting the Army of the North's right wing. Therefore, General of Division Joseph Souham temporarily assumed command and exercised it capably during the battle.\nIn the French order of battle, numbered demi-brigades consisted of 1 regular and 2 volunteer battalions. Non-numbered demi-brigades had 3 to 6 battalions. The French army at Tourcoing numbered roughly 78,000 infantry, 5,300 cavalry, and 28 large-caliber guns. Battalion guns and their crews are not counted. Historian John Fortescue credited Souham's division with 28,000 men, Jean Moreau's division with 22,000 troops, Jacques Bonnaud's division with 20,000 soldiers, and Pierre-Jacques Osten's division with 10,000 men.\nCoalition Army\nFrancis II, Holy Roman Emperor arrived at Imperial headquarters on 14 April 1794 and was the supreme commander of the Coalition forces. Prince Josias of Coburg carried out the function of army commander and Karl Mack von Leiberich acted as chief of staff to the emperor. The Coalition army at Tourcoing numbered about 62,100 infantry, 11,700 cavalry, and 28 large-caliber guns. An unknown number of battalion guns were attached to the units.\nAbbreviations\nRanks\n*FZM = Feldzeugmeister (Gen)\n*FML = Feldmarschall-Leutnant (LG)\n*GM = General Major\n*Gen = Full General\n*LG = Lieutenant General\n*MG = Major General\n*GD = General of Division\n*GB = General of Brigade\n*CdB = Chef de brigade (Colonel)\nOther\n*Nr. = Regiment number for Austrian, Dutch, Hanoverian, and Hessian regiments\n*4pdr = 4-pounder gun\n*6pdr = 6-pounder gun\n*8pdr = 8-pounder gun\n*12pdr = 12-pounder gun\nFrench order of battle\nArmy of the North: GD Jean-Charles Pichegru (absent) vice GD Joseph Souham\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+French Army of the North\n!
