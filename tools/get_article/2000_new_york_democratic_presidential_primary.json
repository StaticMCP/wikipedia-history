The New York primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 294 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 243 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president and presumptive nominee Al Gore decided the primary with almost 66% of the vote, winning 158 delegates, while senator Bill Bradley caught a relevant amount of delegates one of the last times in the primary cycle, receiving 33% and 85 delegates, and one other candidate, Lyndon LaRouche Jr. earned less than 1%.\nProcedure\nNew York was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on Super Tuesday.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 9:00&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 243 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 4 and 6 were allocated to each of the state's 31 congressional districts and another 32 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 53 at-large delegates.\nThe state Democratic committee met on May 31, 2000, to vote on the 53 at-large and 32 pledged PLEO delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 47 unpledged PLEO delegates: 26 members of the Democratic National Committee, 21 members of Congress (Both senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Chuck Schumer, and 19 representatives, Carolyn McCarthy, Gary Ackerman, Gregory Meeks, Joseph Crowley, Jerrold Nadler, Anthony Weiner, Edolphus Towns, Major Owens, Nydia Velázquez, Carolyn Maloney, Charles Rangel, José Serrano, Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, Michael McNulty, Maurice Hinchey, Louise Slaughter, and John LaFalce), and 4 add-ons.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"8\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
