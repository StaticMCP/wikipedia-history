Since 2023, it has continued as a government in exile based in Yerevan, Armenia.\nHistory\nThe predominantly Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh was claimed by both the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and the First Republic of Armenia when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the Russian Empire.  The Soviet Union established control over the area and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR in 1923. The First Nagorno-Karabakh War broke out in 1991 and ended with a ceasefire agreement in 1994 resulting in the Republic of Artsakh retaining control over the former NKAO and surrounding districts of Azerbaijan. In 2020, a new war was fought in the region, with Azerbaijan achieving victory and regaining all the surrounding occupied districts and a significant portion of Artsakh's claimed territory.\nGovernment in exile\nFollowing an Azerbaijani assault on 19 September 2023, Artsakh president Samvel Shahramanyan signed a decree on 28 September that year, stating that by 1 January 2024 all of its state institutions would be dissolved. However, on 22 December 2023, Shahramanyan said that there was no official document stipulating the dissolution of republic, and his office stated that it was \"empty paper\". The Republic of Artsakh continued as a government-in-exile based in Yerevan, Armenia.\nThe Armenian Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan, opposed the said government-in-exile, calling it a \"security threat\". On 28 March 2024, Pashinyan stated, \"In Armenia, apart from the Government of the Republic of Armenia, no other government can exist.\" Some of Artsakh's leadership met with Bagrat Galstanyan, leader of the anti-government protests on 21 May 2024 in Yerevan. On 14 June 2024, Pashinyan threatened to crack down on Artsakh's leadership, saying they were encouraging anti-government protests in Yerevan.\nOn 21 May 2025, Samvel Shahramanyan's presidential term expired. As a result, , who was also elected President of the National Assembly in exile, assumed presidential powers.\nOffice holders\nPresidents of the Republic of Artsakh in exile\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!President\n!Years in office\n!Party membership\n|-\n|Ashot Danielyan (acting)\n|2025–present\n|Independent\n|-\n|Samvel Shahramanyan\n|2023–2025\n|Independent\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
