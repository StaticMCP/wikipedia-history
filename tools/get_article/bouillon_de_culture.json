The show ran from January 12, 1991 to June 29, 2001 (407 episodes); it was broadcast on the channel France 2 (which was called \"Antenne 2\" until 1992). The show originally aired on Sunday evenings, but it was quickly moved to Friday nights, taking the same time-slot as Pivot's previous literary talk show Apostrophes (1975–1990) which it had replaced. The show covered a wide range of cultural topics, especially literature.\nThe show had an average of 850,000 weekly viewers (about 11.6% of total viewers). The series finale had 1,163,000 viewers (19.3%).\nThe name of the show comes from the French expression meaning \"nutrient broth\", \"fertile ground\", \"breeding ground\", or \"culture/growth medium\", but playing on the word \"culture\".\nAmong the guests invited for the series finale, Pivot invited James Lipton, the host of the U.S. TV program Inside the Actors Studio, to participate with him in answering the Proust Questionnaire that Pivot had made famous.\nAwards\nThe show won a \"7 d'Or\" for Best Cultural or Artistic show (Meilleure émission culturelle ou artistique) in 1995 and 2001.\nReferences\n*Portions of this article are based on the equivalent article from the French Wikipedia, retrieved on April 28, 2012.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195447/ Bouillon de culture] on IMDb"
