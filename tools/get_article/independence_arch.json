It forms part of a complex of monuments commemorating the country's independence from British colonial rule in 1957. The Arch, alongside the Black Star Gate and the Liberation Day Monument forms part of the greater independence square.\nHistory\nConstruction of the Independence Arch was commissioned by Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first Prime Minister and President, as part of a broader effort to establish national symbols following the country’s independence on 6 March 1957.\nThe Arch and its surrounding structures were completed in 1961 in time for the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ghana by Ghanaian contractors and G.N.C.C which formed part of Solel Boneh International Ltd. The square was designed to host national parades, independence anniversaries, and other state ceremonies.[http://ispada-archive.com/page.php?id=137]\nDesign and symbolism\nThe Independence Arch is a triumphal arch constructed primarily from concrete and stone. It stands on a raised platform with stairways on either side, symbolizing ascension and progress. It encapsulates a modern Eastern European Architecture spacious enough to seat about 3000 people. The structure is marked by Ghana’s national emblem, the Black Star of Africa.\nAccess and photography\nThe arch holds two separate structures with the lower chamber mostly reserved for dignitaries and head of states who grace occasions at the square. The upper tier however includes office spaces.\nAs of 2011, visitors to the Independence Arch may not approach the monument closely without authorization, due to an active military presence in the area. Photography of the Arch itself is often restricted, although tourists are free to take pictures of the surrounding Independence Square and the Black Star Gate.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ghana-net.com/accra-independence-square-and-black-star-gate See pictures of the \"Independence Arch\" - photograph from the top of the \"Black Star Gate\"]\n* A video of the Arch and Square can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aK88IccFJA here]."
