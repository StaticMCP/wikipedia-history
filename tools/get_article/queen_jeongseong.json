She was the second daughter and fourth child of Seo Jong-jae and Lady Yi of the Ubong Yi clan.\nIn November 1703, at the age of ten, she married the eight-year-old Prince Yeoning. As the wife of a prince, she was given the title of Princess Consort Dalseong ().\nIn 1720, her husband was appointed as Crown Prince (). As his wife, she was given the title Crown Princess Consort (). On their first night of marriage, it was said that Prince Yeoning had asked how were the hands of the princess so pretty. The princess responded by saying that she never did any labor to get them dirty. This comment had unsettled the Prince because it reminded him of his mother, Royal Noble Consort Suk.\nIt was said that from then on to her death as Queen, the Princess was not visited much from the Prince.\nIn 1724, Prince Yeoning's older brother, King Gyeongjong died. Prince Yeoning ascended the throne on 30 August of that year as King Yeongjo and she became his queen consort.\nAs queen, it was said that she held a generous character to her. The Queen had also cherished and treated Crown Prince Hyojang, Yi Jeong-bin's son, and Crown Prince Sado, Yi Yeong-bin’s son, as if they were her own sons.\nThe Queen died at Changdeok Palace on 3 April 1757, and is buried in Seoreung within Hongreung in Yongdu-gong, Deokyang ward, Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. King Yeongjo had her buried near his father, Sukjong of Joseon, in Myeongreung. But because her tomb was built before her husband died, King Yeongjo reserved a spot next her mound intending to be buried with her.\nHowever, when King Yeongjo died in 1776, King Jeongjo was conscious of the Queen Dowager, and built Wonreung to bury the former King and later, the late Queen Dowager. As a result, Queen Jeongseong is buried there alone.\nQueen Jeongseong had no biological children. But her death distressed her adoptive son, Crown Prince Sado. As well as the death of her legal mother-in-law, Queen Dowager Hyesun, who died one month later on 2 May 1757 which contributed to the Crown Prince’s declining mental condition.\nFamily\nParent\n* Father − Seo Jong-jae (; 1656–1719)\n* Mother − Internal Princess Consort Jamseong of the Ubong Yi clan (; 1660–1738)\nSibling(s)\n* Older brother − Seo Myeong-baek (; 1678–1738)\n* Older sister − Lady Seo of the Daegu Seo clan\n* Older brother − Seo Myeong-hyu (; 1686–?)\n* Younger sister − Lady Seo of the Daegu Seo clan (1696–?)\n* Younger sister − Lady Seo of the Daegu Seo clan (1698–?)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Kim Ae-kyung in the 1988 MBC TV series 500 Years of Joseon: Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong\n*Portrayed by Moon Ye-ji in the 1998 MBC TV series ''The King's Road\n*Portrayed by Jung Mo-rye and Shin Gyu-ri in the 2010 MBC TV series Dong Yi\n*Portrayed by Park Shin-hye in the 2014 film The Royal Tailor\n*Portrayed by  in the 2015 film The Throne\n*Portrayed by Kim Sun-kyung in the 2017 MBC TV series The Emperor: Owner of the Mask\n*Portrayed by  in the 2019 SBS TV series Haechi''\nReferences\n}}\n}}"
