After receiving donations from several sources, spearheaded by T. Denny Sanford, the school was able to move forward with plans for the hockey program, despite the elevation of its other programs to Division I being abandoned. On October 5, 2021, the school broke ground on the Midco Arena, a $40 million, 3,000-seat venue to be used as the team's home rink. On April 18, 2022, the program announced the hiring of Minnesota Golden Gophers' assistant coach Garrett Raboin as the team's inaugural head coach.\nThe program is the first varsity ice hockey team at any level to call South Dakota home. The Vikings played the first hockey game in team history on October 7, 2023, a 0–4 loss at Wisconsin. A week later, the team played their first home games at the Denny Sanford Premier Center, their home for five games while Midco Arena finished its construction. The team would earn their first wins in this series with a sweep of Bowling Green. On January 26, 2024, Midco Arena opened, and the Vikings have played there ever since. Augie finished its first season as an Independent at a 12–18–4 record.\nIn mid-2022, the CCHA announced they would be granting the Vikings membership starting in the 2025–26 season with a transitional schedule for their first two seasons, however, in July 2024, the CCHA granted the Vikings full membership for the 2024–25 season, a year ahead of schedule. This allowed the Vikings to compete for a conference championship while playing their abbreviated transitional schedule, leading the CCHA to adopt a points-percentage ranking for determining conference standings due to Augie playing fewer games than the rest of the conference. Augie saw a huge increase in quality of play in their second season, finishing with a 18–13–4 record. The Vikings held first place in the CCHA at various points late in the season, eventually finishing at second place. They played their first conference tournament games in program history against Bemidji State, where they were upset by the seventh-seeded Beavers at home in three games.\nThe 2025–26 season will mark the completion of Augie's transition into the CCHA, as they will play their first full conference schedule.\nSeason-by-season results\nAll-time coaching records\nAs of the completion of 2024–25 season\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"60%\"\n! style=\";\" | Tenure\n! style=\";\" | Coach\n! style=\";\" | Years\n! style=\";\" | Record\n! style=\";\" | Pct.\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2023–Present || Garrett Raboin || 2 || 30–31–8 ||\n|- align=center\n! style=\";\" | Totals\n! style=\";\" | 1 coach\n! style=\";\" | 2 season\n! style=\";\" | 30–31–8\n! style=\";\" |\n|}\nCurrent roster\nAs of August 29, 2025.\nAwards and honors\nCCHA\nAll-conference teams\nSecond Team All-CCHA\n*2024–25: Josh Kotai, G; Luke Mobley, F\nStatistical leaders\nCareer points leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width =\"700\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! style=\";\" | Player\n! style=\";\" | Years\n! style=\";\" | GP\n! style=\";\" | G\n! style=\";\" | A\n! style=\";\" | Pts\n! style=\";\" | PIM\n|-align=center\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 68\n| 25\n| 14\n| 39\n| 37\n|-align=center bgcolor=f0f0f0\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 64\n| 10\n| 26\n| 36\n| 4\n|-align=center\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 61\n| 14\n| 17\n| 31\n| 16\n|-align=center bgcolor=f0f0f0\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 66\n| 7\n| 22\n| 29\n| 39\n|-align=center\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 56\n| 10\n| 18\n| 28\n| 12\n|-align=center bgcolor=f0f0f0\n|\n| 2023–2024\n| 34\n| 8\n| 17\n| 25\n| 0\n|-align=center\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 54\n| 12\n| 12\n| 24\n| 26\n|-align=center bgcolor=f0f0f0\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 58\n| 5\n| 18\n| 23\n| 6\n|-align=center\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 53\n| 7\n| 15\n| 22\n| 42\n|-align=center bgcolor=f0f0f0\n|\n| 2023–present\n| 69\n| 4\n| 18\n| 22\n| 40\n|}\nCareer goaltending leaders\nGP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\nminimum 30 games played\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width = 1000\n|-\n! style=\";\" |  Player\n! style=\";\" |  Years\n! style=\";\" |  GP\n! style=\";\" |  Min\n! style=\";\" |  W\n! style=\";\" |  L\n! style=\";\" |  T\n! style=\";\" |  GA\n! style=\";\" |  SO\n! style=\";\" |  SV%\n! style=\";\" |  GAA\n|-align=center\n| || 2023–present || 44 || 2532 || 19 || 19 || 5 || 98 || 3 || .926 || 2.32\n|-\n|}\nStatistics current through the end of the 2024–25 season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
