The historic settlement is in the Raritan Valley region, located along the course of the Millstone River. As of the 2020 census, the CDP's population was 1,581, of which 1,272 were in South Brunswick Township and 309 in Franklin Township.\nThe New Jersey State Planning Commission created the Kingston Village Advisory Committee in 2001 to address issues related to this distinct area. Both South Brunswick and Franklin appoint members to the committee, which holds an annual meeting to discuss issues pertinent to the Kingston area. Kingston is (so far) unique as the only village center that has been officially designated by the New Jersey State Planning Commission.\nKingston is located in five historic districts and is part of the Millstone River Valley Scenic Byway. The Delaware and Raritan Canal and Rockingham State Historic Site are a short distance away.\nHistory\nJediah Higgins purchased  from the Native Americans in the early 18th century and the town of Kingston was established. Kingston's location on the Lenape Assunpink Trail where it crossed the Millstone River and later becoming part of the King's Highway was the prime factor in its early prominence. Kingston was by far the most active and important village, being situated on both the heavily traveled King's Road and Millstone River, combining commercial activities of both mills and taverns.\nGeography\nKingston is in southwestern Middlesex County, in the western end of South Brunswick Township, and in southern Somerset County, occupying the southern tip of Franklin Township. It is bordered to the east by Heathcote in Middlesex County and to the north by East Rocky Hill in Somerset County. It is bordered to the west by the Millstone River, which forms the Mercer County line. The borough of Princeton borders Kingston across the Millstone River.\nNew Jersey Route 27 is Kingston's Main Street; Route 27 leads southwest  to its terminus in the center of Princeton, and northeast  to New Brunswick, the Middlesex county seat.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Kingston CDP has an area of , of which  are land and , or 3.55%, are water. The Millstone River, which runs along the western edge of Kingston, is a north-flowing tributary of the Raritan River and thus part of the watershed of Lower New York Bay.\nDemographics\n2010 census\n]]\nMiddlesex County portion\nThe 2010 United States census counted 1,222 people, 533 households, and 303 families in the CDP.

The old tombstones surround the site where the church once stood in the Kingston Cemetery. The Reverend Eleazer Wales was the first recorded minister of the church. The original church building in the cemetery burned down in 1791, and new building was erected in 1792 on the original foundation. The congregation used this building until 1852, when the larger building on Main Street in Kingston was constructed on land purchased from Elijah Stout. In 1853, the church building in the cemetery was sold and was later dismantled.  Two additions were constructed on the 1852 site. Sunday school rooms were added to the back of the structure in the late 1940s. In the late 1980s another addition was added which added a new kitchen facility, additional space in the assembly room, pastors study and office.\nThe church suffered through some difficult times during the remainder of the 1700s. During this period, Princeton University was built and the village of Princeton expanded, while the population of Kingston declined. (At that time, Kingston extended as far as Snowden Lane.) Consequently, the church lost many members to the \"new\" Presbyterian Church down the road in Princeton.\nIt was also during this time that the Revolutionary War was fought in the area, and British officers were quartered in local homes. Gen. Washington became a recognizable figure in the Kingston area at the time. Not only did he lead his troops past the church to escape Cornwallis, but he also had his headquarters hardly a mile from the church while the Continental Congress sat in Nassau Hall.\nIn 1800, the Kingston Presbyterian Church began a period of prosperity and growth, which continues to this day. The church sent its first foreign missionaries to China in the early 1800s.\nKingston United Methodist Church\nDuring the month of February 1878, the people of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Rocky Hill brought an evangelist, Miss Lizzie Sharp, to conduct revival meetings in their church. There were some twenty or more of Kingston people who attended these meetings, and who decided to form a Methodist church in Kingston. A site was purchased for $250 on what is now Church Street, across from the Kingston Cemetery. Building began September 20, 1878, and was completed and dedicated on January 30, 1879. A nursery was later added.\nNational Register of Historic Places\nThe following sites and districts in Kingston are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\n* Rockingham Historic Site, George Washington's last war-time headquarters in 1783, added in 1970 it is #70000394.\n* Delaware and Raritan Canal Historic District was added in 1973, it is district #73001105.\n* Kingston Mill Historic District was added in 1986, it is district #86000707.\n* Kingston Village Historic District was added in 1990, it is district #89002163.\n* King's Highway Historic District was added in 2000, it is district #00001493.\n* Princeton Nurseries Historic District, was added in August 2018, it is district #08000899.\nNotable people\nPeople who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Kingston include:\n* Cynthia Gooding (1924–1988), folk singer\n* Andrew Zwicker (born 1964), physicist and member of the New Jersey General Assembly\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614124647/http://rockingham.net/index.htm Rockingham State Historic Site]\n* Kingston Greenways Association: http://kingstongreenways.org/\n* Friends of Princeton Nursery Lands: http://fpnl.org/\n* Kingston Historical Society: http://www.khsnj.org/\n* [http://www.no92.com No 92]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061004161635/http://www.preservationnj.org/ten_most/ten_most_property_detail.asp?COUNTY=Statewide&PropID=72 Preservation New Jersey: Vanishing Villages]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/kingstonwomenschorus/home Kingston Women's Chorus]\n*\n*"
