Ltd.) is a film and television production company based in Melbourne, Australia. It was formed in 1993 by actors Santo Cilauro, Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Tom Gleisner, and producer Michael Hirsh.\nHistory\nWorking Dog was formed in 1993 by five collaborators who had worked together on earlier comedy projects; the company initially traded as Frontline Television Productions before adopting the name Working Dog Productions in the mid-1990s. The founders have described the company origin as “five friends formed a production company with a dodgy camcorder and a dream.”\nThe company name and mascot (an Australian Cattle Dog) reflect the founders’ affection for dogs, and the company has retained the original creative core across decades while expanding into multi-platform production and a small executive/staff structure.
