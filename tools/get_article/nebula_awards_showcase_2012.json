Swirsky's contribution is panned for \"its staccato pacing and unfinished air.\" Overall the pieces are found \"too often pallid, especially—perhaps unfairly—contrasted with a true heavyweight champion like Tiptree.\" The reviewer feels the book's \"greatest likely appeal\" would be \"to the younger section of the audience.\"\nRyder Miller in the Portland Book Review thinks \"[r]eaders may find the showcase varied or uneven,\" but \"[d]espite the strange, challenging, experimental story or something else that one may not appreciate, upon finishing the collection, one is likely to experience a profound longing for more.\" While noting the presence of pieces \"by some of the field's top luminaries [and] also many newer writers,\" he laments \"the passing on of the old guard\" and the lack of \"articles and non-fiction commentary\" featured \"in years past.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Jim Davis in SFRA Review no. 301, Summer 2012.\nNotes"
