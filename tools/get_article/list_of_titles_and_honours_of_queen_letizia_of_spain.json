She has received numerous titles, decorations, and honorary appointments as Princess of Asturias and as Queen of Spain.\nStyles and titles\nUpon marrying Felipe, Letizia was styled \"Her Royal Highness The Princess of Asturias\", as consort of the Prince of Asturias, heir to the Spanish Crown. Likewise, Letizia had the right to use the other titles that belonged to Felipe as heir (these were those of Princess of Girona, Princess of Viana, Duchess of Montblanc, Countess of Cervera, and Lady of Balaguer).\nAfter the accession of Felipe to the Spanish throne, Letizia became queen consort and was styled as \"Her Majesty The Queen\". In private conversations, the most correct thing is to address her initially as \"Your Majesty\" (Majestad) and, later, as \"Madam\" (Señora), but never as \"You\" (Tú or Usted).\nHonours\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Country\n!Date\n!Appointment\n!Ribbon\n!Other\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|22 May 2004\n|Dame Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Charles III\n|\n|\n|-\n|19 June 2014\n|De facto Grand Mistress of the Royal Order of Noble Ladies of Queen Maria Luisa\n|\n|\n|-\n|21 November 2008\n|Dame of the Royal Cavalry Armory of Seville\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2009\n|Grand Cross of the Order of the Liberator General San Martin\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2004\n|Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Stars\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2005\n|Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2006\n|Member 1st Class of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana\n|\n|\n|-\n||\n|25 September 2006\n|Grand Cross of the Military Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2007\n|Grand Cross of the National Order of Faithful Service\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2011\n|Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|30 April 2013\n|Recipient of the King Willem-Alexander Inauguration Medal\n|\n|\n|-\n|15 October 2014\n|Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2014\n|Member Special Class of the Order of Muhammad\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2015\n|Grand Cross Extraordinary of the Order of Boyaca\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|2017\n|Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|18 April 2018\n|Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2021\n|Grand Gwanghwa Medal of the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Member of the Royal Order of the Seraphim\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|17 October 2022\n|Grand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n|\n|-\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2023\n|Recipient of the Order of Agostinho Neto\n|\n|-\n|\n|Knight of the Order of the Elephant\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|17 April 2024\n|Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|17 September 2025\n|Member Supreme Class of the Order of the Virtues\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Grand Cross of the Order of National Merit\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Grand Cordon of the Order of Merit\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Sash of Special Category of the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|4 November 2025\n|First Class of the Civil Order of Oman\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Grand Cross of the Order of Vasco Núñez de Balboa\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun of Peru\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Grand Cross of the Order of Merit for Distinguished Service\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Grand Cross of the Order of the Golden Heart\n|\n|\n|}\nHonorific eponyms\n*\n**Elche, Alicante: Colegio de Educación Infantil y Primaria Princesa de Asturias (Infantile and Primary Education Public School Princess of Asturias)\n**Santander: Centro de Acogida Princesa Letizia (Reception Center Princess Letizia)\nOther honours\n*\n** Asociación Española contra el Cáncer y de su Fundación Científica (Spanish Association Against Cancer and of its Scientific Foundation):  Honorary President\n** \"Larra\" Award for the most distinguished young journalist of the year, Madrid Press Association (2000)\n** Hija Adoptiva de Ribadesella (Adoptive Daughter of Ribadesella), Asturias (2004)\n** Hija Predilecta de Oviedo (Favourite Daughter of Oviedo), Asturias (2007)\nSee also\n* List of titles and honours of Felipe VI of Spain\n* List of titles and honours of Juan Carlos I of Spain\n* List of titles and honours of Queen Sofía of Spain\n* List of titles and honours of Leonor, Princess of Asturias\n* List of honours of the Spanish Royal Family by country\n* List of titles and honours of the Spanish Crown\nNotes and references\n*   [http://www.casareal.es/EN/FamiliaReal/Princesa/Paginas/princesa_biografia.aspx H.R.H. the Princess of Asturias, Official site of the Royal Household of Spain]."
