Seollal is New Year’s Day on the Korean lunar calendar. The name originates from the word , which means unfamiliar, implying newness of a new coming year. It is unknown when Koreans began celebrating Seollal, but rituals of the festival are estimated to go back to the 6th century. On Seollal, Koreans demonstrate their respect to parents and elders in the family, as well as deceased ancestors through Sebae and Charye. Also, elders give money or present to a person who did Sebae in return of showing their respect. Koreans almost always wear hanbok on this day and eat Tteokguk and Yakwa in addition to playing a traditional game like. With passing of Seollal, all Koreans age one year under the East Asian age reckoning.\n*Daeboreum (15th day)\n:Daeboreum celebrates the first full moon of the new year. Traditionally, group of people play a traditional game called Geuybulnori (Hangul: 쥐불놀이) a night before or on the day of Daeboreum. Farmers burn hays of dry grass on ridges between the rice fields while other people whirl around few cans with a lot of holes which allowed charcoals to fire inside the cans. Practically, people believed the fire could help kill harmful insects near the rice fields, and ashes of the fire could fertilize the ground to help the year's farming. Also, charcoals were used to blaze a fire. In addition, people eat ogokbap (Hangul: 오곡밥, Hanja: 五穀밥), or ‘five-grain rice,’ and seasoned greens. People drink ear-quickening wine (Hangul: 귀밝이술), go up to the mountain in the night (Hangul: 달맞이) and pray for his or her wishes to the moon. People also do Bureom (Hangul: 부럼깨기) on Daeboreum. People crack nuts with one's teeth, believing this will not make one's face come out in spots for the rest of the year.\nSecond\n* (2nd month)\n:Meoseumnal is a traditional festival for servants.  () refers to servants and slaves. This was a day that masters allowed their servants and slaves to celebrate a day with extra food, singing, and dancing before farming started in February, back in the day when slaves existed in Korea. The masters also provided enough money for the servants so that the servants would have not needed to spend their money in the day. This festival was designed by masters to encourage their servants and slaves to work better on the year's farming. The servants usually made traditional snack called songpyeon with the grains used during Daeboreum and ate them according to their age, because they believed this could bring them good luck. For instance, a 10-year-old servant would eat ten Songpyeon. In Euiryong-gun, Yangsan-gun, or Gyungsangnam-do, the day was regarded as a coming-of-age day. The festival is no longer celebrated after the abolition of the Meoseum system in Korea, and it is even rare to see a person remembering the festival.\n*Yongdeungje\n:Yongdeungje (Hangul: 영등제, Hanja: 靈登祭) is a day to celebrate Yongdeung (Hangul: 영등, Hanja: 靈登, the god of wind), believed to have descended to Earth on the first day of February and ascended on the 20th. The festival is mostly celebrated in Jeju Island and Youngnam district. While Yongdeung is on Earth, it is believed to bring strong winds. Thus, people in the sectors strongly affected by wind such as fisheries and farms perform an ancestral ritual Jesa (Hangul: 제사, Hanja: 祭祀) in order to appease the wind god. If it rains or is cloudy the day Yongdeung ascended, people think the year will be a fruitful one.\nThird\n*Samjinnal (3rd day)\n:Samjinnal (Hangul: 삼짇날, Hanja: 三짇날)’s origin is unknown but is noted as a day of celebrating the coming of spring. Thus Samjinnal, the date with two 3s, is considered a lucky day with good and evil spirits. This is the day when barn swallows return, snakes wake from their sleep, and butterflies begin to fly. It is thought as good luck if one sees a snake on this day. Archery, cockfighting, flower viewing, and fortune telling are also enjoyed by the people celebrating this day. People would eat rice pancakes with flower toppings known as Hwajeon (Hangul: 화전, Hanja: 花煎) and noodles, and drink Dugyeonju (Hangul: 두견주, Hanja: 杜鵑酒, Azalea wine).\nFourth\n*Hansik (105 days after winter solstice)\n:One of the biggest four traditional festivals along with Seollal, Dano, and Chuseok, Hansik marks the start of the farming season. During the festival, Koreans visit their ancestral graves for offering rite and cleaning and maintenance. Jesa (Hangul: 제사, Hanja: 祭祀), a traditional ritual is performed with the expectation of a fruitful year at the grave. Traditional food is prepared for the Jesa and shared with families and neighbors after the ritual has been performed. It is known that on Hansik, people should eat only cold food, but the ideal is generally ignored. Ssuktteok (Hangul: 쑥떡, a variation of Tteok, mugwort cake), Ssukdanja (Hangul: 쑥단자, Hanja: 쑥團餈, mugwort dumplings), and Ssuktang (Hangul: 쑥탕, Hanja: 쑥湯, mugwort soup) are the representative food for Hansik.\n*Chopail (8th day)\n:\n:Also known as Buddha’s Birthday, people celebrate the founder of Buddhism.

On Yudu, people would go to creeks that run to the East and bathe and wash their hair in the past. It is considered a performance and ritual of washing away bad spirits. Then people would perform rituals to the farming god with newly harvested fruits hoping for a fruitful harvest. People also eat noodles as it is believed that by eating noodles, people will live a prosperous and long life.\n* (between 6th and 7th month)\n, Chicken soup on Sambok]]\n:Sambok is thought to be the hottest day of the summer. Bok in Sambok means that a person is lying down like a dog, and the hot energy of summer is strong, so the energy of autumn cannot stand up and obey.

Before harvest, farmers take this day to rest and perform rituals to farming gods hoping for a fruitful harvest season. In the past, servants and workers were granted with a day off and received allowance money to buy goods and food and some servants were also married on this day. On Baekjung, people eat food made with potatoes, flour, and wheat, along with a variety of wild vegetables.\nEighth\n*Chuseok\n:Also known as Hangawi (Hangul: 한가위), the Korean thanksgiving Chuseok (Hangul: 추석, Hanja: 秋夕) is one of the greatest traditional festivals.

Regular ritual food is prepared on this day.\nEleventh\n*Dongzhi Festival\n]]\n:Dongji (Hangul: 동지, Hanja: 冬至) is the day with the longest night and the shortest day.

Patjuk is believed to ward off evil spirits.\nTwelfth\n*Seotdal Geumeum (Last day of the year)\n:Seotdal Geumeum (Hangul: 섣달그믐) was established to celebrate the last day of the year by driving evil spirits away and welcoming a new and prosperous year.
