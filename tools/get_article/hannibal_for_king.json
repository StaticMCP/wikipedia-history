He is an African American. Lanham went through a difficult childhood; as his father was incarcerated, he was raised by his grandmother. By 2008, he was living in a homeless shelter, although his fortunes would turn when a video of him performing extraordinary feats of calisthenics in a park, titled \"Hannibal For King,\" became viral. By 2014, the video had accumulated a total of 9,502,956 views; it was an emblematic moment of the history of street workout, and fueled the popularity of the activity. Following its publication, Lanham would make a \"modest\" income as a personal trainer, through DVD sales, and endorsement deals.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
