      "text": "# The Rime of King William\n\nin the New Forest, which was established by King William. (He sætte mycel deorfrið […] He forbead þa heortas)]]\n\"The Rime of King William\" is an Old English poem that tells the death of William the Conqueror. The Rime was a part of the only entry for the year of 1087 (though improperly dated 1086) in the \"Peterborough Chronicle/Laud Manuscript.\" In this entry there is a thorough history and account of the life of King William. The entry in its entirety is regarded \"as containing the best contemporary estimate of William's achievements and character as seen by a reasonably objective Englishman\" (Bartlett, 89). As a resource, earlier writers drew from this in a more literal sense, while later historians referred to it more liberally. The text in its original language can be found in The Peterborough Chronicle 1070–1154, edited by Cecily Clark. A modern translation can be found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles translated by G.N. Garmonsway. Seth Lerer has published a more recent modern translation of \"The Rime of King William\" in his article, \"Old English and Its Afterlife,\" in The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature.\nText and translation\n|\nHe had castles built\nand poor men terribly oppressed.\nThe king was severe\nand he took many marks of gold and\nhundreds of pounds of silver from his underlings.\nAll this he took from the people,\nand with great injustice\nfrom his subjects,\nout of trivial desire.\nHe had fallen into avarice\nand he loved greediness above  everything else\nHe established many deer preserves\nand he set up many laws concerning them\nsuch that whoever killed a hart or a hind\nshould be blinded.\nHe forbade (hunting of) harts\nand also of boars.\nHe loved the wild deer\nas if he were their father.\nAnd he also decreed that the hares\nshould be allowed to run free.\nHis great men complained of it,\nand his poor men lamented it;\nbut he was so severe\nthat he ignored all their needs.\nBut they had to follow above all else\nthe king’s will,\nif they wanted to live\nor hold on to land,\nland or property (or esteem)\nor have his good favour.\nWoe, that any man\nshould be so proud\nas to raise himself up\nand reckon himself above all men.\nMay almighty God show mercy on his soul\nand forgive him his sins.}}\nSummary\nThe Rime itself is short, and is more of a criticism of King William rather than praise of his reign. It also acts as a summation of that year's entry. The author appears to have chosen a few points that he may have found particularly interesting and turned them into a poem within the entry for the year. The poem is somewhere between 17 and 32 lines long, depending on whether an editor arranges it according to Old English alliterative meter or as rhyming couplets.\nAuthorship\nThe author of this Rime, as with many Old English texts, is unknown, but the author does offer an important detail earlier in his entry.\n\"The one definite piece of information which he gives is that he was a member of William's household\" (Whiting, 91–92).\n:Þonne wille we be him awritan swa swa we hine ageaton, Þe him on locodon an ore on his hirede weredon.\n:[Then shall he write of him, as we have known him, who have ourselves seen him and at time dwelt in his court.] (Garmonsway, 219)\nSo, at one point the author was a member of the royal household. When and for how long is not sure. Beyond this, there are no other facts offered but it is safe to assume that the author was a monk or a member of a religious house.\nArtistic criticism\nThis poem has been criticized for being immature and \"a garbled attempt at rhyming poetry: a poem without regular metre, formalized lineation or coherent imagery\" (Lerer, 7). Many other scholars support this criticism. Professors George Philip Krapp and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie did not include the Rime in their six-volume Anglo Saxon Poetic Records. Its value as a representation of Old English literature as well as the quality of the poem, simply as a poem, is called into question. The end rhyming is unlike the alliterative Old English poetry, which is the basis for most scholarly criticism. Bartlett Whiting refers to the Rime as having \"a lack of technical merit,\" referring to the sudden jump from prose of the formal entry, to that of the \"rough and ready verse\" (89). With its end-rhymes it is often taken as an example of the transition to Middle English.\nSignificance\nNo matter the quality of the Rime's rhymes, the spelling of this Rime was used to age both the text itself as well as chart morphology in Old English texts. Whiting refers to the specific dropping of the final n, indicative of the loss of inflectional endings from Old to Middle English (Whiting, 89).\nThe poem serves as \"an elegy for an age as much as for a king, this entry as a whole constitutes a powerfully literary, and literate, response to the legacies of pre-Conquest English writing\" (Lerer, 12). The text offers both the political time line (the twenty first year that William I ruled) and a religious timeline (one thousand eighty-seven years after the birth of Jesus Christ).\nWithin the form of the lament for King William it expresses the indignation of the English at the introduction of the Norman forest law. Stefan Jurasinski has shown that it is most likely by the compiler of the Peterborough Chronicle himself and that it stands at the head of a developing tradition of literary polemics against the injustice of the forest laws (\"The Rime of King William and its Analogues\").\nDigital Facsimile Edition and Modern Translation\n* Foys, Martin et al.
