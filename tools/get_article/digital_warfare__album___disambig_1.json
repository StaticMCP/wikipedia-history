It was the bands first full length release in over seven years. It was their first album in over a decade to not feature longtime guitarist Mike Bowser, who had been with the band since 1994 and the last album to feature founding drummer Mark McKay.\nIn 2018 a limited edition reissue was released in both the U.S. and Belgium.\nBackground\nFollowing the band's crossover tour in 1996 lead singer Jack \"Choke\" Kelly really didn't feel like continuing the band and no new album was expected; however, following a few tours between 2001 and 2003 bassist bass player Chris Laurie called Kelly. \"Chris called me one day and suggested that we record something new again. And that sounded damn good, so I got to work and wrote new songs. Then we recorded and mixed the album over a few weekends – and it was fun to be back in the studio. That's how the new album was created.\" Following the departure of long time guitarist Mike Bowser, Ed Lalli took over and the album was recorded in Baked Bean Studios in Harrison, Maine.\nThe album title was picked in criticism towards the Iraqi war/modern warefare and how sterile today's wars have become. Kelly stated “Someone sits in a command center and presses a few buttons, and a few hundred people die. But the perpetrators don't see anything of it, it's all become a crazy video game. Just think of CNN and the way war is presented there: 'Dear ladies and gentlemen, here you can see how a cruise missile is shot down. We are now switching live to the onboard camera to better track the flight.'. That's so sick, especially when it comes to this talk about clean warfare. There is no such thing, we are just less aware of what war actually is, and let the whole thing be presented as entertainment. Only when you see all the blood again will some people understand what war is all about. He added “Every war is wrong, no reasonable person can seriously justify a war. And in the matter with Iraq, it is so that everyone has been lied to with the fairy tale of the Iraqi threat.\"\nThe album also featured some less serious/comedic lyrics including a cover of \"C Is for Cookie\" from Sesame Street.\nReception\n| rev2 = Punk News\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = Rough Edge\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Read Junk\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Visions.de\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = Ox-Fanzine\n| rev6score = Favorable\n}}With this album Slapshot went back to their roots with a more aggressive sound. With Punknews stating \"The thing that really strikes me about this release is how revitalized this band sounds. Their past few releases weren't really as aggressive as their earlier material, but they sound like a new band on here. Not that they've changed their sound, or that they don't sound seasoned, but they just come out of the gate with the intensity of some kids who are recording their first album.\" Scott Bolton writing for Rough Edge gave the album a positive review stating “Amazingly, this is the band's first studio album in seven years. You'd never know it. \"Digital Warfare\" is a furious, raging ass-kicking disc with nary a low point. Any fan of hardcore or heavy punk will find something to like here.\nTrack listing\n| length6       = 1:24\n| title7        = Had It with Unity\n| writer7       = Kelly\n| length7       = 3:17\n| title8        = Tear Down the Walls\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 2:24\n| title9        = Stupid Fucking Kids\n| writer9       = Kelly\n| length9       = 1:45\n| title10       = Focus\n| writer10      =\n| length10      = 2:03\n| title11       = Wasted Time\n| writer11      = Kelly\n| length11      = 3:30\n| title12       = Witch Hunt\n| writer12      = Kelly\n| length12      = 1:59\n| title13       = C Is for Cookie\n| writer13      =\n| length13      = 1:59\n}}\nPersonnel\nSlapshot\n* Jack \"Choke\" Kelly – lead vocals\n* Ed Lalli – guitar\n* Chris Lauria – bass\n* Mark Mckay – drums\nTechnical personnel\n* Alan Ward – mastering\n* John Bean – engineer\n* Grail Mortillaro – photography\n* Matt Pike – concept\nReferences"
