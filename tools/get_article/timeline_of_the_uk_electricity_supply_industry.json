The Electric Lighting Acts 1882 to 1909 permitted local authorities and companies to apply to the Board of Trade for provisional orders and licences to supply electricity. The orders were confirmed by local Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation Acts. Local authorities and companies could also obtain local acts for electricity supply. A sample of local acts is given in the table below.
