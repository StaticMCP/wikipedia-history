Edwards Barker. The future Edward VIII, then Prince of Wales, appeared in the film. During the First World War, a group of British cadets thwart the plans of a German agent. It bears strong similarities to The Power of Right also directed by Thornton and featuring the Prince of Wales, which was released the same year.\nCast\n* Sydney Wood as Lord Billy\n* Harry Agar Lyons as Sir William Halsford\n* J.
