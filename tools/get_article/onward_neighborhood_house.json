Originally founded as a settlement house in Chicago's West Town neighborhood during the 1890s, Onward House now provides direct services to working class and immigrant families on Chicago's Northwest side. Onward's mission is to open doors, improve lives, and uplift communities through educational, economic, and support services. The organization offers a variety of programs and services, serving both children and adults.\nHistory\n1868–1990\nOnward Neighborhood House was founded in 1868 as Mission Sunday School, a small religious organization run out of a storefront located at Hoyne and Grand Avenue. Following the example of Jane Addams' Hull House, Mission Sunday School formed Onward Presbyterian Church in 1893, on the corner of Ohio and Leavitt St in West Town, serving the community as a settlement house. Following the settlement movement tradition, Onward served as a church, school, refuge and community center for the large immigrant population and provided vital social services to alleviate poverty and squalid conditions.\nIn 1926, members of the Glencoe Union Church and Winnetka Congregational Church formed a board of directors and took over the administration of Onward House. In 1928, a new building was constructed at 600 N. Leavitt, which would serve as the primary location for the next 86 years. During the Great Depression, like many community organizations, Onward provided vital aid to struggling families. As one volunteer wrote, \"During these days of depression much of the time of the full-time workers is spent acting as middle-men between the relief station and the unemployed person, helping speed up delayed groceries, back rents, clothing and coal.\" Following the Great Depression, Onward House would continue to provide social services.\nOnward House incorporated as a non-profit organization in December 1943, its mission was to \"maintain and conduct an organization to minister to the spiritual, moral, mental and physical needs of the community in which it is now or shall hereafter be located.\" Onward continued to be an active part of the West Town community during this time period, expanding their campus with the purchase of an annex building in 1967.\n1990–present\nIn response to demographic change during the 1990s and early 2000s, Onward began to expand its services to the nearby Belmont Cragin neighborhood. In 2008, Onward House opened an expanded center for their childcare programs on 5423 W. Diversey Ave. In 2014, Onward House completely moved to Belmont Cragin, purchasing a secondary building at 5413 W. Diversey. This building was remodeled and opened as the Hank and Kim Marshall Community Resource and Education Center 2016. The original West Town building was demolished in 2014.\nCurrent Programs\nFood pantry\nIn association with the Greater Chicago Food Depository, Onward Neighborhood House operates a food bank at St. Peter's United Church of Christ.\nChildhood Education\nEarly Childhood Education\nOnward Neighborhood House provides daycare for children ages 2 to 5.

Students also attend field trips planned on days in which children are off from school during the school year and up to three times per month in the summer.
