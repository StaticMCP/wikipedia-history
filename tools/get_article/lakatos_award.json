The contribution must be in the form of a monograph, co-authored or single-authored, and published in English during the previous six years. The award is in memory of the influential Hungarian philosopher of science and mathematics Imre Lakatos, whose tenure as Professor of Logic at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) was cut short by his early and unexpected death. While administered by an international management committee organised from the LSE, it is independent of the LSE Department of Philosophy, Logic, and Scientific Method, with many of the committee's members being academics from other institutions. The value of the award, which has been endowed by the Latsis Foundation, is £10,000, and to take it up a successful candidate must visit the LSE and deliver a public lecture.\nSelection\nThe award is administered by the following committee:\n*Professor Roman Frigg (Convenor, LSE)\n*Professor Richard Bradley (LSE)\n*Professor Hasok Chang (University of Cambridge)\n*Professor Nancy Cartwright (University of Durham)\n*Professor Kostas Gavroglu (University of Athens)\n*Professor Helen Longino (Stanford University)\n*Professor Samir Okasha (University of Bristol)\n*Professor Sabina Leonelli (University of Exeter)\nThe Committee makes the Award on the advice of an independent and anonymous panel of selectors.\nWinners\nThe Award has so far been won by:\n:1986 – Bas Van Fraassen  for The Scientific Image (1980) and Hartry Field for Science Without Numbers (1980)\n:1987 – Michael Friedman for Foundations of Space-Time Theories and Philip Kitcher for Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature\n:1988 – Michael Redhead for Incompleteness, Nonlocality and Realism\n:1989 – John Earman for A Primer on Determinism\n:1991 – Elliott Sober for Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Interference (1988)\n:1993 – Peter Achinstein  for Particles and Waves: Historical Essays in the Philosophy of Science (1991) and Alexander Rosenberg  for Economics—Mathematical Politics or Science of Diminishing Returns?
