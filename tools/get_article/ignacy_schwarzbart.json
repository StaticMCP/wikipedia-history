      "text": "# Ignacy Schwarzbart\n\nIgnacy Izaak Schwarzbart (13 November 1888 in Chrzanów – 26 April 1961 in New York City) was a prominent Polish Zionist, and one of Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish Government-in-Exile during the Second World War, along with Szmul Zygielbojm.\nSchwarzbart and Zygielbojm played key roles in highlighting reports of Nazi atrocities against Jews in occupied Poland. In 1942 Schwarzbart held a press conference in London alleging that 1 million Jewish people had already been killed. The figures were reported in the media but were treated sceptically by both the British and by some other Polish politicians.\nReferences\nBooks\n*Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski, Nie ostatnie słowo oskarżonego, Warszawa 2003,\n* Dariusz Stola, Nadzieja i Zagłada.
