Fine was a specialist in modern American history, with interest in the history of the labor movement, the New Deal, and the history of Michigan and its political environment. He wrote and edited over fifteen books and many articles.\nFine's first appointment at the University of Michigan was as a teaching assistant in 1946.

He was named the Richard Hudson Research Professor of History, the Andrew Dickson White Distinguished Professor of History, the Henry Russel Lecturer, and was named the \"Professor of the Year\" for the state of Michigan in 1986.
