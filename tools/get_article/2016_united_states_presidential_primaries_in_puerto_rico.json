Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote. There were 60 Democratic delegates and 23 Republican delegates to be allocated.\nPrimary elections\nRepublican primary\nThe Republican primary took place on March 6, 2016:\nTwelve candidates appeared on the Republican presidential primary ballot, with only four still possessing active campaigns:\nMarco Rubio, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich\nSen. Marco Rubio carried the primary with 73.8% of the vote and was awarded all 23 delegates due to the territory's 50% winner-take-all threshold.\nDemocratic caucus\nThe Democratic caucus took place on June 5, 2016.\nSee also\n* Democratic Party presidential debates, 2016\n* Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n* Republican Party presidential debates, 2016\n* Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gop.com/the-official-guide-to-the-2016-republican-nominating-process/ RNC 2016 Republican Nominating Process]\n* [http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/ Green papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions]"
