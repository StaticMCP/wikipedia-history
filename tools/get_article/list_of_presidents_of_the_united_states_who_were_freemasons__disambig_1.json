The Pillar, however, have noted that \"Biden would have to himself accept, even passively by not rejecting the designation, the conferred membership, the masons don’t have the power to make someone a member without consent, anymore than one person can marry another without their consent.\" They further question if this actually occurred, casting doubt on his Masonic membership.
