A battalion led by Abd al-Aziz departed from Rabat and was ambushed and defeated on its approach to Marrakesh by forces loyal to Abd al-Hafid.\nBackground\nIn May 1907 the southern aristocrats, led by the head of the Glaoua tribe Si Elmadani El Glaoui, invited Abd al-Hafid, an elder brother of Abd al-Aziz, and viceroy at Marrakesh, to become sultan, and the following August, Abd al-Hafid was proclaimed sultan there with all the usual formalities.\nOn 5 August 1907, France bombarded and occupied Casablanca after the death of Europeans in a riot incited by the implementation of measures of the Treaty of Algeciras. In September, Abd al-Aziz arrived at Rabat from the capital, Fes, and endeavored to secure the support of the European powers against his brother. From France he accepted the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour, and was later enabled to negotiate a loan. This was seen as leaning to Christian support and aroused further opposition to his rule, and in January 1908 he was declared deposed by the ulama of Fes, who offered the throne to Abd al-Hafid.\nBattle\nAfter months of inactivity Abd al-Aziz made an effort to restore his authority, and quitting Rabat in July he marched on Marrakesh. His force, largely owing to treachery, was completely overthrown on 19 August when nearing that city,\nReferences"
