Between 1976 and 1984, commercial ships crossing the Pacific Ocean recorded expendable bathythermograph (XBT) data. This data became instrumental in a number of studies, particularly around the Kuroshio Current. As well as its direct oceanographic value, this data was also important for determining the scale of features of interest, thus influencing the design of later observational networks.\nHis research interests included:\n* Planetary wave dynamics\n* Interdecadal oscillations and their relation to El Niño and La Niña\n* Global climate change\n* Coupled ocean-atmosphere interaction\nHe is known for his work on the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave.\nPublications\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
