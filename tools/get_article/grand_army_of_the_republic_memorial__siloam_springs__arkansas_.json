Located in the southern part of the park, it consists of a concrete foundation, on which rest two tiers of granite slabs, laid horizontally.  These are topped by a vertical granite column that has an onion form at the top.  The sides of the horizontal slabs are rusticated, as are three sides of the column.  The fourth side is engraved, from the top down, with an inverted five-point star labelled \"GAR\", then the words \"IN GOD WE TRUST\", then a Maltese cross engraved \"WOMEN'S RELIEF CORPS 1833\", then \"ERECTED BY/CURTIS POST/1928\", and finally a wreath topped by an eagle and crossed cannons, with \"US\" in the center surrounded by \"PRESERVED BY THE GRACE OF GOD\".  The memorial was placed in 1928, and is the only known memorial statewide to mention the  Grand Army's Women's Relief Corps.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Arkansas\nReferences"
