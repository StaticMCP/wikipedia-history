On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment. On Codewars the community and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and quality solutions.\nThe platform is owned and operated by Qualified, a technology company that provides a platform for assessing and training software engineering skills.\nHistory\nFounded by Nathan Doctor and Jake Hoffner in November 2012, the project initially began at a Startup Weekend competition that year, where it was prototyped. It was awarded first place in that competition, drawing the attention of engineers, and funding interest from two of the judges Paige Craig (angel investor) and Brian Lee (entrepreneur).\nAfter building the first production iteration of the platform, it was launched to the Hacker News community, receiving significant attention for its challenge format and signing up approximately 10,000 users within that weekend.\nSee also\n* CodeFights\n* CodinGame\n* Competitive programming\n* HackerRank\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20201028203134/angel.co/company/codewars AngelList profile] (archived on 28 October 2020)\nReferences"
