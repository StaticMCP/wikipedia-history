It is part of the saat bas bhaichara grouping of 7 villages. The village has 4 panna/patti (subdivisions), named as Nangalia Panna (dominated by Garhwal gotra ), upparla Panna (dominated by Duhan gotra), parla Panna (dominated by Sheoran gotra), etc. with a total revenue land area of 43903 kanal or 5487 acre as per HALRIS records.\nIt is situated   from the state capital Chandigarh,  from the national capital Delhi,  from the district headquarter Hisar,  from Bhiwani and  from the Tosham Hill range beginning at Khanak.\nHistory\nIn the Kanwari archaeological mound, Painted Gray Ware (PGW) and later historic artifacts were found. The PGW Culture corresponds to the middle and late Vedic period, i.e., the Kuru-Panchala kingdom, the first large state in the Indian subcontinent after the decline of the Indus-Saraswati Valley civilisation.\nArchaeological Survey of India's explorations, as reported in the \"Indian Archaeological Review 1978-79\" (page 8), found early historical and late medieval artifacts at Kanwari. Late medieval artifacts included 9th and 10th century temple [of Kaumari in Nagara architecture from the times of Tomara dynasty rule who were vassals of Pratiharas until 10th century]. The earliest extant historical reference to the Tomaras rule in Haryana occurs in the Pehowa inscription issued during the reign of the Pratihara king Mahendrapala I (r. c. 885-910 CE). Inscription states that Jaula of the Tomara family became prosperous by serving an unnamed king; and his descendants were Vajrata, Jajjuka and Gogga; Gogga was a vassal of Mahendrapala I; Gogga and his step-brothers Purna-raja and Deva-raja constructed three Vishnu temples at Prithudaka (Pehowa) on the banks of the Sarasvati River (Ghaggar River). F. Kielhorn suggested that this Tomara family actually resided in Delhi: they may have visited Pehowa on pilgrimage, and built a temple there.\nIn 2022, while ploughing his sandy field with the tractor, on Kanwari-Badya Jattan Road on the western side of Kanwari, a farmer found a 70-80 kg heavy 2ft x 2 ft buff sandstone ancient statue of Vishnu accompanied by depiction of 14 other Hindu deities around it, including  Shiva and Ganesha, in the same style as 9th-13th century Khajuraho Group of Monuments. Slim and small ancient bricks were also found. An in-situ temple has been built. In 1986 also a buried ancient statue was accidentally discovered in the village and in-situ Chuganwali Mata temple was built for it too on the west of village. A well preserved ancient buff sandstone panel showing Revanta, youngest son of the sun-god Surya and his wife Saranyu, is now fixed in the wall of the Brāhmaņa dharmaśālā in the middle of the village of Kanwari.\nThe medieval temple of dhok of village ancestor deity at Kanwari explored by ASI in 1978-79 is called the Bua Kanwari Dham , where newlyweds go for blessings before entering the village. Dhok is also called Bhaiyan and Jathera. Dhok (Haryanvi: धोक worship) comes from the word दहक, which means the sacred fire. Bhaiyan (Haryanvi: भईयाँ) from भूमिया means from the earth. Jathera (Punjabi: जठेरा from जेष्ठ) means the elder or ancestor. A modern temple has been built on top of the earlier temple and medieval sculptures have been preserved in the temple complex. People of several nearby village, including Kanwari, Sultanpur, Muzadpur, Nalwa, Umra, Ratera, and few other villages also consider Bua Kanwari as their kuldevi, ie. ancestral tutelary deity.\nThe village was established by the Garhwal Kingdom (गढ़वाल गोत्र) ancestors with likely connections with tomar kingdom of Garhwal Kingdom. The foundation temple put by Garhwal kingdom was name  Dada kheda  is of Garhwal Gotra.\nKanwari also has an old Baba Shri Giri Shiva temple with a monastic akhara for the sadhus (Hindu mystics).\nA Gurjara‐Pratihara period 13x10x8.5 cm buff-colored statute of standing Jina in kayotsarga yoga pose in a pillared niche, with makaramukha on its right side, was found. This is a fragment of a big sculpture, which was likely destroyed by islamic invaders.\nAfter Independence of India in 1947, Kanwari became part of Punjab.
