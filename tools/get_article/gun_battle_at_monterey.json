Hittleman and Sidney Franklin and starring Sterling Hayden.\nPlot\nAfter he and his partner, Reno (Ted de Corsia), hold up a bank, Turner (Sterling Hayden) decides he wants to branch out on his own. When he tells Reno, Reno shoots him and makes off with the money. But Turner doesn't die — rather, he is discovered and mended by a beautiful Mexican woman named Maria (Pamela Duncan).
