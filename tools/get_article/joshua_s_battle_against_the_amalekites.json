      "text": "# Joshua's Battle against the Amalekites\n\n'Joshua's Battle Against the Amalekites or Joshua's Victory over the Amalekites' is a  oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Nicolas Poussin, now in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\nIt was produced as a pendant to The Battle between the Israelites and the Amorites by the same artist during his time in Rome. He fell into dire financial straits after the 1625 death of his patron, the poet Giovan Battista Marino and cardinal Francesco Barberini (1597–1679)'s departure from the city - this forced him to sell both works. They were both acquired by Catherine II of Russia to be kept in Poussin's cousin Gaspar Dughet's home on via Paolina in Rome. . The pair was split up in 1927.\nSee also\n* List of paintings by Nicolas Poussin\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*"
