Opened in May 1988 by Queen Elizabeth II, it was completed as a Bicentennial project.  The Queens Wharf project was the vision of Joy Cummings, who became Lord Mayor of Newcastle in 1974, the first woman ever to hold such a position in Australia.\nThe Queens Wharf Tower was demolished in September 2018. The decision to  keep the observation tower would cost ratepayers $1.6 million in the next four years in maintenance costs. The total cost of demolition  was estimated to cost $30,000.\nThe ferry wharf is served by Newcastle Transport's Stockton ferry service.\nThe wharf also has a stop on the Newcastle Light Rail.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=2300146#/ Queens Wharf details] Transport for NSW"
