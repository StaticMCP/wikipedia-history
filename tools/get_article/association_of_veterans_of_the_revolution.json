The association secured pensions for its members and made arrangements for them to buy land in installments from the government. Baldomero Aguinaldo was named president of the organization during its inception, and served in this capacity until his death on February 4, 1915. Among those who received land from the government were Manuel Tinio, Pio Valenzuela, and Mariano Trias. Another project was the Mausoleum of the Veterans of the Revolution, a mausoleum constructed in Manila North Cemetery, designed by an architect Arcadio de Guzmán Arellano, inaugurated on May 30, 1920. General Mariano Noriel, Tomas Arguelles, and Pio del Pilar are some of the few who were interred inside the structure.\nReferences"
