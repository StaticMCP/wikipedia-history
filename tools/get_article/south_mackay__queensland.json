In the , South Mackay had a population of 6,918 people.\nGeography\nAs its name suggests, the suburb of South Mackay is immediately to the south of the central suburb of Mackay. Adjoining the Coral Sea, South Mackay has flat land just above sea level apart from a small hill (approx 10 metres above sea level) in the south-east of the locality.\nThe flat nature of the land made it suitable for use as an airport. The Mackay Airport occupies the south-eastern half of the suburb with suburban development in the north and west of the suburb. There are a number of sports fields between the airport and the residential areas, including the Souths Rugby League Club, the Souths Hockey Club, the City Brothers Football Club and Harrup Park Country Club (hosting a number of sports include the Mackay Cricket Association and AFL Mackay).\nHistory\nMackay State High School opened on 5 February 1912 as part of the Mackay Technical College in Alfred Street, Mackay. 76 students presented for entry examinations on the first day. Between 1959 and 1962, the high school was relocated to its current campus in Milton Street, South Mackay.\nOur Lady of Mt Carmel School was opened on 23 November 1923 by the Sisters of Mercy under the leadership of Sister M Dympna O'Reilly. It was officially opened by Joseph Shiel, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rockhampton. The Bishop's decision to establish the school in South Mackay was questioned at the time as the school was so distant () from the Mackay township. It is unclear when the school adopted the name St Mary's Catholic School but it was in use by 1936. From 1981, the school has been operating under lay leadership.\nIn July 1927, the Mackay Chamber of Commerce became aware that the Australian Government was thinking of establishing airmail services within Australia \"wherever they could be justified\". In January 1928, the Mackay Chamber of Commerce first considered creating an aerodrome to prepare for the growth in air traffic, suggesting in March 1928 that  the Town Common might be a suitable location. In April 1928 the Mackay City Council voted to provide the land if an aerodrome was required. In September 1928, Captain John Henry Arthur Treacy, chief pilot of the Queensland Air Navigation Co. Ltd., flew over Mackay looking for suitable locations and confirmed that the Town Common appeared very suitable and could be converted to an aerodrome at very little cost. In July 1929, Captain Treacy tells Mackay to create an aerodrome as the coastal air service will soon commence at other towns' aerodromes while Mackay will miss out; he again confirmed the suitability of the town commons as a site.  In October 1929, the Chamber of Commerce was advised that, if Mackay had an aerodrome, it would be included in the plans for an airmail service to be commenced by the Australian Postmaster General's department that would visit Mackay three or four times a week. In February 1930, the Mackay City Council was advised by the Controller of Civil Aviation that the town commons site would be suitable after the trees and shrubs removed and the surface made firm and even. Based on an estimated cost of these works to be £250, the council voted to proceed with setting aside the land on the town commons for an aerodrome. On Monday 21 April 1930, approximately 2,000 people cheered as the monoplane Star of Townsville under the command of Captain Treacy landed on the new Mackay Aerodrome (the former Town Common). The mayor of Mackay, Alderman Wood, then officially opened the aerodrome. In January 1931, the aerodrome was approved and licensed by the Civil Aviation branch of the Defence Department as being suitable for all types of land aeroplanes, enabling the council to begin charging landing fees.\nOn 18 August 1935, the foundation stone was laid for St Mary's Catholic Church. On Sunday 7 June 1936, the church in Juliet street was officially opened by Bishop Romuald Hayes.\nIn 1968, Our Lady of Mercy Convent High School was opened in Penn Street as a Catholic secondary school for girls in Penn Street. It was renamed Our Lady of Mercy College. In 1987, it amalgamated with St Patrick's College, a Catholic secondary school for boys established by the Christian Brothers in 1929, to create the co-educational Mercy College.\nDemographics\nIn the , South Mackay had a population of 6,706 people.\nIn the , South Mackay had a population of 6,918 people.\nEducation\nSt Mary's Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at 42 Juliet Street ().
