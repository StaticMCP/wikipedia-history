From 1832 to 1983 it returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nHistory\nThe Warrington constituency covered the central part of the town of Warrington in Lancashire and surrounding area.\nIn 1983 it was abolished and replaced by Warrington North and Warrington South constituencies.\nBoundaries\nThe Parliamentary Borough of Warrington was defined by the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 as comprising:\nThe respective Townships of Warrington and Latchford; and also those two detached portions of the township of Thelwall which lie between the boundary of the township of Latchford and the River Mersey  It was this area that was incorporated as a Municipal Borough in 1847. The boundaries were unchanged until 1918 when the constituency was redefined as being identical with the area of the County Borough of Warrington. The constituency boundaries were widened to reflect those of the County Borough in 1950, at the same time it was renamed as Warrington Borough Constituency.\nMembers of Parliament\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Year!!Member!!Party\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" | || 1832 || Edmund George Hornby || Whig\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" | || 1835|| John Ireland Blackburne || Conservative|votes=130|percentage=46.8|change=6.8}}\n33.2}}\n3.0\n}}\n0.9\n}}\n0.9}}\n1.8}}\n33.9}}\n0.9\n}}\nElections in the 1840s\n|votes = 298\n|percentage = 47.7\n|change = New\n}}\nElections in the 1850s\nElections in the 1860s\nElections in the 1870s\n2.3\n}}\n2.3}}\n3.0}}\nElections in the 1880s\n}}\n6.8\n}}\n6.8}}\n1.3}}\n4.6\n}}\n10.2\n}}\n10.2}}\n1.2}}\n8.5\n}}\n1.8\n}}\n1.8}}\n3.6}}\n4.0}}\n6.0\n}}\nElections in the 1890s\n}}\n0.5\n}}\n0.5}}\n1.0}}\n0.1}}\n1.2\n}}\n0.5\n}}\n0.5\n}}\n1.0\n}}\n3.1\n}}\n0.5\n}}\nElections in the 1900s\n}}\n2.9\n}}\n2.9}}\n5.8}}\n3.7}}\n1.7\n}}\n15.2\n}}\n15.2}}\n10.6}}\n9.1\n}}\nElections in the 1910s\n}}\n7.0\n}}\n7.0}}\n14.0}}\n2.2}}\n11.1\n}}\n1.9\n}}\n1.9}}\n2.6}}\n4.5\n}}\nGeneral Election 1914–15:\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.
