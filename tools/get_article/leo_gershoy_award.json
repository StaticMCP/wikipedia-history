Endowed in 1975 by the Gershoy family and first awarded two years later, the prize commemorates Leo Gershoy, professor of French history at New York University. It was awarded biennially until 1985, and annually thereafter.\nThe first recipient of the award was Simon Schama; other distinguished honorees include Robert Darnton, John H. Elliott and Roy Porter. Carla Rahn Phillips of the University of Minnesota has uniquely won the prize on two occasions.\nList of prizewinners\nSourced from AHA\n*2025 — Amanda Wunder, Spanish Fashion in the Age of Velázquez: A Tailor at the Court of Philip IV (Yale University Press)\n*2024 — Vera Keller, The Interlopers: Early Stuart Projects and the Undisciplining of Knowledge (Johns Hopkins University Press)\n*2023 — Meredith Martin and Gillian Weiss, The Sun King at Sea: Maritime Art and Galley Slavery in Louis XIV’s France (Getty Research Institute)\n*2022 — Emma Rothschild, An Infinite History: The Story of a Family in France over Three Centuries (Princeton Univ.
