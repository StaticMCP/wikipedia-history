The Grio is a division of the MSNBC cable channel. Begun in 2010, the Grio's list of 100 \"History Makers in the Making\" honors those who are shaping American's future today; its award winners are selected not only from the African American community, but from all sections of America.\nThe ten award categories are Business, Health, Education, Science & the Environment, Media, Pop Culture, Arts & Culture, Service & Activism, Politics and Sports, and ten people are selected from each category. To make the Grio 100 list, winners must display a large-scale impact on all of America, and their work must be ongoing. The editorial team at theGrio.com, after consulting contributors and experts, decides the outcome of the awards. The top 100 change every year.\nGrio Awards 2023\nGrio Awards 2022\nGotdon Keith, Humanitarian, Muser and local treasure\nDave Chapelle, comedian, Cultural Icon Award\nGrio Awards 2021\nGrio Awards 2020\nGrio Awards 2019\nGrio Awards 2018\nGrio Awards 2017\nGrio Awards 2016\nGrio Awards 2015\nGrio Awards 2014\nGrio Awards 2013\n* Charles E.
