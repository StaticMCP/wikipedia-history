Shirley Booth, appearing in a play in Philadelphia, presented the Academy Award for Best Actor through a live broadcast cut-in, having privately received the winner's name over the telephone from O'Connor. Gary Cooper pre-recorded his presentation of the Academy Award for Best Actress while on location in Mexico shooting Garden of Evil, with O'Connor then announcing the winner's name live.\nAll the major winners in this year were black-and-white films. Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity won eight awards from its thirteen nominations: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Academy Award for Best Director, Best Screenplay (Daniel Taradash), Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (Burnett Guffey), Best Sound Recording, and Best Film Editing. It was the third film to receive five acting nominations. Its eight awards matched the record set by Gone with the Wind in 1939. Walt Disney won four awards, a record shared by him and Sean Baker for most Oscars won by a single person in the same year (Bong Joon Ho won three at the 92nd Academy Awards However, the award is accepted by the director on behalf of the country, and since 2014, the director's name is engraved on the statuette.}} and accepted a fourth for Best International Feature on behalf of South Korea.)\nWilliam Holden's acceptance speech for Best Actor for Stalag 17 was simply \"Thank You\", making it one of the shortest speeches on record, as it was cut short by the broadcast cut to a commercial. Holden, frustrated, later personally paid for advertisements in the Hollywood trade publications to thank everyone he had wanted to in his speech, remarked that he felt that either Burt Lancaster or Montgomery Clift should have won the Oscar for From Here to Eternity instead of him, and expounded backstage on a system he felt valued commercials over program content; NBC had cut to commercials during the middle of other acceptance speeches as well that evening.\nWinners and nominees\nAwards\nNominees were announced on February 15, 1954. Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Motion Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Directing\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n*'From Here to Eternity – Buddy Adler for Columbia Pictures&nbsp;'\n**Julius Caesar – John Houseman for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&nbsp;\n**The Robe – Frank Ross for 20th Century Fox&nbsp;\n**Roman Holiday – William Wyler for Paramount Pictures&nbsp;\n**Shane – George Stevens for Paramount Pictures&nbsp;\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n*'Fred Zinnemann&nbsp;– From Here to Eternity'\n**Charles Walters&nbsp;– Lili\n**William Wyler&nbsp;– Roman Holiday\n**George Stevens&nbsp;– Shane\n**Billy Wilder&nbsp;– Stalag 17\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Actor\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" |  Best Actress\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n*'William Holden&nbsp;– Stalag 17 as J.
