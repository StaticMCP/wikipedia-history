It was soon approached by a united Swedish–Lübeckian fleet under the commands of Erik Fleming, Staffan Sasse, and Friedrich Bruun. After a bloody battle, Norby withdrew, leaving behind 30 transport ships.\nBackground\nIn July of 1522, Danish admiral Søren Norby attempted to send supplies into the garrison in Stockholm, which was being besieged by Swedish troops. To do this, he dispatched Junker Thomas with some ships towards Stockholm. However, these were intercepted by the Swedes and neither Thomas or the ships came back to Norby.\nBattle\nIn November, Norby made another attempt to send supplies into Stockholm. Using 9 archipelago ships and 30 transport vessels with provisions and other necessities, he sailed into Stockholm's Archipelago. He was soon met by a fleet of 18 ships, 10 Swedish and 8 Lübeckian, the Swedish ships under the command of Erik Fleming and Staffan Sasse, while the Lübeckian ones were under the command of Friedrich Bruun. After a bloody fight, he was eventually forced to withdraw from the archipelago, abandoning the 30 transport ships to the Swedish–Lübeckian fleet. It is likely that he would have suffered an even worse defeat had the Lübeckian ships not been passive. Instead of attacking him with the Swedes, they dropped their anchors and allowed him to retreat.\nAftermath\nAfter the failed relief expedition, Stockholm's days were numbered, and its fall was inevitable. Despite not receiving new supplies and suffering from disease and hunger, the city held out for over half a year until finally capitulating.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*"
