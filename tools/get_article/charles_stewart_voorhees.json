He attended Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and in 1873 he graduated from Georgetown College in Washington, D.C., June 26, 1873.\nAfter graduating from college, Voorhees studied law. He attained admission to the bar in 1875 and commenced practice in Terre Haute, Indiana. In 1882, Voorhees moved to Washington Territory with his friend John L. Wilson, and settled in Colfax to establish a law practice. From 1882 to 1886 he served as prosecuting attorney of Whitman County.\nA Democrat, in 1884 Voorhees was elected as Washington's territorial delegate. He was reelected in 1886 and served in the 49th and 50th Congresses (March 4, 1885 – March 3, 1889). During the 50th Congress, the U.S. House and Senate passed the Enabling Act of 1889, which provided the process for Washington Territory to achieve statehood.\nIn 1888, Voorhees lost reelection to Republican John B. Allen, who served as delegate until Washington joined the Union as a state in November 1889. After leaving Congress, Voorhees resumed the practice of law in Colfax. He later moved to Spokane, where he continued the practice law. He died in Spokane on December 26, 1909.
