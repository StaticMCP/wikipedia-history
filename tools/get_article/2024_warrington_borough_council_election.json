The Liberal Democrats became the official opposition by increasing their seats from 8 to 12. Their group leader prior to the election, Bob Barr, did not stand for re-election; after the election they chose Mark Browne to be their new group leader and therefore the leader of the opposition on the council. The Conservatives, who had been the official opposition prior to the election, lost 9 seats, including their group leader Nigel Balding, leaving only one Conservative on the council.\nAfter the election, Labour had 42 seats and the opposition had 16 seats.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Post-Election Council Composition\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Labour Party\n|42\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Liberal Democrats\n|12\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Independents\n|3\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Conservative Party\n|1\n|}\nSummary\nElection result\n6\n|votes %       =47.2\n|seats %       =72.4\n|votes         =54,064\n|plus/minus    =+8.3\n}}\n4\n|votes %       =17.2\n|seats %       =20.7\n|votes         =19,705\n|plus/minus    =+1.2\n}}\n1\n|votes %       =6.6\n|seats %       =5.2\n|votes         =7,598\n|plus/minus    =+0.5\n}}\n9\n|votes %       =25.6\n|seats %       =1.7\n|votes         =29,261\n|plus/minus    =–11.0\n}}\n|votes %       =1.8\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =2,045\n|plus/minus    =N/A\n}}\n|votes %       =1.6\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =1,822\n|plus/minus    =–0.7\n}}\n|-\nWard results\nIncumbent councillors in the Ward are denoted by an asterisk (*).\nAppleton\nBewsey & Whitecross\nNote: In June 2025, Cllr Shireen Mohammed announced she would be stepping down, triggering a by-election\nBirchwood\nBurtonwood & Winwick\nNote: One of the Independent candidates, Theresa-Jane Murray, stood in the 2021 election as a Conservative candidate.\nChapelford & Old Hall\nCulcheth, Glazebury & Croft\nNote: in October 2024, Cllr Neil Johnson resigned from Labour over a proposed transit site.
