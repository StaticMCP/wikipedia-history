The album is the first to be produced by Rusby herself, following her split with husband and producer John McCusker.\nRegarding her role as producer Rusby states that:\nSong information\nRusby states that the track \"Bitter Boy\" is her favourite composition that she herself has written.\n\"John Barbury\" is set to a traditional melody, Child Ballad 89 (\"Fause Foodrage\"), while its lyrics originate from Child Ballad 100 (\"Willie O Winsbury\"). This tune became well known in the late 1960s after Richard Thompson used it as the basis for the Fairport Convention song \"Farewell, Farewell\".\nThe bonus track, a cover of The Kinks' song \"The Village Green Preservation Society\", was recorded as the theme for BBC TV sitcom Jam and Jerusalem.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Rusby, except where noted.\n#\"Awkward Annie\" - 3:14\n#\"Bitter Boy\" - 4:54\n#\"John Barbury\" (Traditional) - 5:42\n#\"High On a Hill\" - 4:30\n#\"Farewell\" (Traditional) - 5:30\n#\"Planets\" - 4:10\n#\"The Old Man\" (Traditional) - 3:49\n#\"Andrew Lammie\" (Traditional) - 3:54\n#\"Streams of Nancy\" (Traditional) - 3:57\n#\"Daughter of Heaven\" - 3:56\n#\"Blooming Heather\" (Traditional) - 4:44\n#\"The Village Green Preservation Society\" (Ray Davies) (bonus track) - 3:17\nReferences"
