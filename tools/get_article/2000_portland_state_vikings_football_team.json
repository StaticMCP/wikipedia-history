In their eighth year under head coach Tim Walsh, the team compiled an 8–4 record, with a mark of 5–3 in conference play, and finished tied for second in the Big Sky. The Vikings advanced to the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs and were defeated at Delaware in the first round.\nFor the 2000 season, Portland State played all of their home games at Hillsboro Stadium in neighboring Hillsboro, Oregon. The games were played there instead of Civic Stadium as their Portland home was undergoing major renovations to accommodate the Triple-A Portland Beavers baseball team for their 2001 season.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium = Hillsboro Stadium\n| site_cityst = Hillsboro, OR\n| score = 37–20\n| attend = 5,703\n| source =\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n}}\nReferences"
