The production of the series involved NAS, TV Tokyo, and Ashi Productions. Hozumi Gōda reprised his role as Lio Convoy from Beast Wars II in this series. Each episode has a runtime of approximately 30 minutes and was broadcast in the standard 4:3 aspect ratio.\nPlot\nThe series centers on the conflict between the Maximal and Predacon factions over the control of mysterious Angolmois Capsules. Big Convoy, a \"one-man army,\" is tasked with teaching a group of young recruits to confront Magmatron's group. As the series progresses, both factions ultimately unite to combat the dark god Unicron and his sub-group, the Blentrons.\nCharacters\nThis is a list of characters from the 1999 anime series Super Life-Form Transformers: Beast Wars Neo. As a direct sequel to Beast Wars II, Beast Wars Neo follows a group of young Maximals, led by Big Convoy, as they traverse the galaxy to prevent Magmatron's Predacons and Unicron's Blentrons from collecting capsules containing Angolmois Energy.\nMain\n* Maximals - Descendants of the Autobots.\n** Big Convoy - A warrior known for his immense power and tendency to engage in battles alone, earning him the reputation of a \"one-man-army\".

Despite nearing success, Unicron is thwarted by Big Convoy and Lio Convoy.\n* Blentrons - Transformers created by Unicron, each with a chimeric beast mode, to serve his purposes.\n** Drancron - A Blentron who can transform into an iguana/dragonfly chimera and wields the Drancutter, Clap Missiles, and Lizard Claws.\n** Elphorpha - A brutal Blentron who can transform into a killer whale/elephant chimera; possesses enhanced strength, acid production, and ceiling adhesion; and wields the Killer Tusks and Killer Shooter.\n** Ratorarta - A vicious Blentron who can transform into a lionfish/hornet chimera and wields the Poison Arrow, Dust Hornet, and Lato Thrasher.\nGuest\n* Rockbuster - An efficient and pragmatic Maximal vigilante who can transform into a crab.
