The score was published by Novello in 1982, and lasts under ten minutes, making it one of the shortest operas, and is possibly unique in having no instrumental accompaniment.\nSynopsis\n]]\nAct 1\nKing Harald of Norway sings of his exploits: \"Whereas my brother the blessed and holy man Olaf said: Love thine enemies, I say: sever their limbs until they cause no trouble.\" A distant fanfare announces the arrival of Earl Tostig, an English traitor who urges Harald to invade his homeland.\nAct 2\nHarald's dead brother Saint Olaf appears in a dream to warn him the expedition is ill-fated, but Harald gives the order to depart.  His two wives sing a duet of farewell.\nAct 3\nThe Norwegian Army lands at Scarborough, singing a chorus of praise for their leader which is interrupted by a messenger warning of the approaching army of Harold II of England. A surviving soldier narrates Harald's death in the battle of Stamford Bridge.\nEpilogue\nAn Icelandic sage watches the corpses being brought back to Oslo: \"I could have told him it would end like this.\"\nReferences"
