Asking the artists point-blank, director Darren Hoffman explores the potential \"death\" of traditional jazz through modernization and marginalization, and its preservation through mentorship and the continuation of traditions that intrigue and inspire young people to play the music of previous generations.\nPerformances and production\nIn addition to in depth personal interviews, Tradition is a Temple is composed of various multi-camera professional studio recordings. The performances were recorded by steve Reynolds at the University of New Orleans School of Music. The production took place completely post-Hurricane Katrina, beginning in August 2006.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
