Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nAP Poll\nThe final AP Poll was released in early December, at the end of the 1966 regular season. In the previous season, the final poll was released in January for the first time, after the bowl games, but not in 1966 or 1967.\nThe AP Poll ranked only the top ten teams from 1962 through 1967.\n|Week2Date = Sep 19\n|Week3Date = Sep 26\n|Week4Date = Oct 3\n|Week5Date = Oct 10\n|Week6Date = Oct 17\n|Week7Date = Oct 24\n|Week8Date = Oct 31\n|Week9Date = Nov 7\n|Week10Date = Nov
