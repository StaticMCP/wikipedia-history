She then worked for the Falkland Islands Development Corporation and Cable & Wireless before returning to the UK in 2004 where she went to the University of Exeter to retrain as a school teacher.\nIn November 2009 she was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Stanley, and in June 2010 she represented the Falklands at the annual meeting of the UN Special Committee on Decolonisation in New York City.\nEdwards is a reserve Police Constable in the Royal Falkland Islands Police and her portfolios as an MLA included Tourism, Minerals, Housing and Environment and Heritage. She announced her resignation from the Legislative Assembly in 2011, following her decision to marry Mark Brook.
