      "text": "# Game Over: Jerry Sandusky, Penn State, and the Culture of Silence\n\nGame Over: Jerry Sandusky, Penn State, and the Culture of Silence is a 2012 book written by Bill Moushey and\nBob Dvorchak about Jerry Sandusky and the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.  Moushey in an investigative journalist, formerly with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and a professor at the school of Communications at Point Park University.  He won National Press Club's Freedom of Information Award in 1997.  Dvorchak is a 40-year veteran journalist.\nIn the book, the authors reviewed the grand jury findings, focusing on the alleged sexual assaults, and investigated claims of a coverup by Penn State University officials in order to protect the reputation of the football program.  The book was written over the course of 10 weeks.\nThe book alleged that Joe Paterno \"had to know\" of the sexual abuse allegations happening under his watch.  The isolated nature of State College, Pennsylvania is used as a metaphor for the isolated nature of the football program.\nDuring the publicity phase, an excerpt was published on the sports gossip website Deadspin.\nThe Paterno family immediately denounced the book.  The family's lawyers called the book an \"unprofessional and irresponsible rehash from clip files and anonymous interviews,\" specifically disputing the authors' claims that Paterno forced Sandusky's 1999 retirement to coverup abuse claims.  In regard to the quick publication of the book, the Paterno family said that \"The price of their obsession with speed over accuracy is a book that distorts the truth and offers conclusions and theories for which the authors have no evidence,\" he said.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780062201140 Game Over: Jerry Sandusky, Penn State, and the Culture of Silence] at HarperCollins"
