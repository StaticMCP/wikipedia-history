Delaware's principal wind potential is from offshore wind. A 2012 assessment estimates that 15,038 MW of offshore wind turbines could generate 60,654 GWh/year. Delaware generated 11,522 GWh from all generating sources in 2011.\n2 MW of large scale wind capacity has been constructed in Delaware. A single 256-foot tall, 210-ton turbine at the University of Delaware in Lewes was built in 2010 for generating and educational purposes. It produced 5 GWh of electricity in 2015. There are no projects under construction, but there is a planned offshore wind power project that would produce 120 MW\nThe state of Delaware ran a request for proposals (RFP) during 2006-2007 that is notable as the first known RFP, world-wide, in which offshore wind power competed equally against coal and natural gas power alternatives.\nProposed projects\nThe Delaware Offshore Wind Farm was a proposed project which did not advance. Two other off shore wind farms are proposed for offshore Delaware, one supplying energy to Maryland and the other to New Jersey.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
