The plan, sponsored by the Japanese American Citizens League with Bill Naito encouraging its proposal, was accepted in 1988.\nDesigned by landscape architect Robert Murase, the plaza tells the important history of the Japanese in Oregon. It illuminates the challenges faced by Japanese immigrant and the incarnations of people with Japanese ancestors. The plaza represents the poems of the experience of the Japanese immigrants and an important reminder of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.\nThe Oregon Nikkei Endowment administers the plaza, which features Songs of Innocence, Songs of Experience (1990), a bronze-and-stone sculpture by Jim Gion.\nSee also\n* Cherry blossoms in Portland, Oregon\n* History of Japanese Americans in Portland, Oregon\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
