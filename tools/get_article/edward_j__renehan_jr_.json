He studied blues guitar with the Reverend Gary Davis in New York as a teenager. By 20, he was playing and recording with folksingers Pete Seeger and Don McLean, among others. In 1976, he and Seeger recorded \"Fifty Sail on Newburgh Bay: Hudson Valley Songs Old & New Sung by Pete Seeger and Ed Renehan.\" Several of the tracks Renehan recorded with Seeger reappeared in 2019 as part of the six-CD, table-top book retrospective \"Pete Seeger: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection\"  which won the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.\nIn his early twenties he performed with Happy Traum, Artie Traum and others at various venues and folk festivals in the North East. Renehan stopped playing professionally in 1980, and only rarely ventured onto stages thereafter.\nPublishing and consulting\nRenehan graduated from State University of New York at New Paltz.\nHe thereafter worked for several New York publishing companies, focusing on the developing domain of digital publishing, including e-publishing and print-on-demand (POD) technologies.

During this period he wrote books published by Doubleday, Crown, Oxford University Press, Basic Books, McGraw Hill, Simon & Schuster, Chelsea House, and other firms.\nIn 2010, Renehan founded New Street Communications, an enterprise focused on audio, digital, and POD editions of books in a range of fields.  According to a July 2013 report in the Providence Business News, the combined New Street firms had revenues of more than $200,000 in the 2012 fiscal year, which was the enterprise's second full year of operation. As of June 2015, the firm had 85 titles in print.\nIn 2022, he founded the New Street division illume Media, a boutique a la cart publishing agency offering ghostwriting, writing, editing, book-doctoring, design, audiobook creation, eBook creation, and hybrid- and self-publishing guidance to clients interested in any or all of these services.
