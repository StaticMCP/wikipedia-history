It was originally broadcast in the United States on ABC on April 19, 2011. The episode was directed by Matthew Gross and written by series creator Christopher Murphey.\nIn the episode, Megan (Dana Delany) investigates the murder of Ted Harbison (Kevin Kaine), who dies shortly after surgery and has to face up to her past, by going back to her former hospital; and Ethan (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis (Windell Middlebrooks) autopsy Jessica Archer (Christina Hendricks), a woman who died from a blood clot, and meet her twin sister Karen (Hendricks), for whom Ethan begins to develop feelings.\nThe episode received positive reviews, and was watched by 11.30 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, on the Tuesday night it aired in the United States. Critics praised Hendricks, with one stating that \"guest stars like this should help keep up the quality\", saying her role was \"lovely\". Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic called it \"one of its most entertaining episode's yet\" due to the partnership between Ethan and Curtis.\nPlot\nTed Harbison (Kevin Kaine) is found dead in a park. Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) investigates into his death and during the investigation, it is revealed Ted had surgery just before he died, and Megan finds three surgical staples that weren't closed fully, causing him to bleed out internally, causing Megan to think that Ted was murdered. Megan visits her old hospital, where she was once a neurosurgeon. Ted's surgeon, Doctor Chandler (Marc Blucas) has a reputation for recklessness while performing surgeries and Megan finds out that the video was never turned on, meaning the surgery was never recorded. While at the hospital, Megan meets her old friend and the hospital administrator Gwen Baldwin (Carolyn McCormick) and while there Gwen reveals her son died of an overdose. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, Ethan (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis (Windell Middlebrooks) autopsy Jessica Archer (Christina Hendricks), with both Ethan and Curtis unsure how she died. Jessica's twin sister arrives, Karen (Hendricks), and she and Ethan are attracted to each other.\nMeanwhile, Megan discovers that the surgical staple gun was tampered with. The guns come in packs of three but the pack was broken up between three surgeries, one was given to Ted, another to George White (Dan Amboyer) who Megan has to perform emergency surgery on after finding him near-dead, and the third staple gun was not used. Megan finds traces of fungus found on bonsai trees on the staple guns and Megan realizes that Gwen has bonsai trees. When her son died, he was pledging for the fraternity where George is president. Gwen tampered with the staple guns to kill George, not realizing that the pack would be broken up. Ethan and Curtis find out that Jessica had a genetic mutation that caused a blood clot, so Ethan warns Karen that she might also have one. Megan confronts Gwen, who confesses to Megan. Gwen is eventually taken away by the police, after admitting to George's attempted, and Ted's accidental murder.\nProduction\n\"Dead Man Walking\" was written by series creator Christopher Murphey and directed by Matthew Gross, best known for directing Dirty Sexy Money and Day Break, and films such as Fired Up! and Joe Somebody.
