Launched in 2003.\nHP RGS enables remote access to workstations (or virtual workstations\n)\nfrom many different devices, including other workstations and thin-clients.\nScreen sharing between multiple users, remote USB, as well as Windows and Linux are supported. HP markets RGS for \"Real-Time Collaboration,\" \"Workstation-Class Mobility,\" and \"Remote Workers\"\nThe remote desktop tool is optimized to provide low latency interactions, even with poor network conditions such as packet loss.\nIn 2020, HP updated and rebranded RGS as part of the HP ZCentral Solution. ZCentral Remote Boost was awarded an Engineering Emmy Award in 2020.\nHP RGS processing and hardware-accelerated graphics are done on the workstation and only compressed bitmap images (the screen) are sent to the client device.\nThere are two components to the software, the sender (for the workstation or server) and the receiver (for the client device). The software supports OpenGL and Microsoft DirectX. The software is sold stand alone for servers, virtual machines and non-HP Workstations. HP started including RGS with all of its desktop Z brand workstations starting with version 5.4.7 in 2011. RGS can be downloaded from HP and run on HP Z Workstations and ZBook mobile workstations for free.\nAn early version of the HP RGS video compression codec, is derived from a patented system developed by HP Labs and used in the NASA Mars rover program.\nVersions\n''From HP RGS' release notes website.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
