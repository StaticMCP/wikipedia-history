Sampling Luther Vandross's \"Never Too Much\", the song was written by Queen Pen, Jay-Z, and Teddy Riley, who also produced the track, and was included on Queen Pen's debut studio album, My Melody, in 1997. The following year, on January 20, \"All My Love\" was issued as the album's second single. Upon its release, the song reached number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. In New Zealand, the single peaked at number one for four weeks and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).\nRelease and reception\n\"All My Love\" was commercially released in the United States on January 20, 1998, and in the United Kingdom on April 27, 1998. British columnist James Masterton called the track a \"brilliant\" song and noted that it was a much better effort than Queen Pen's debut, \"Man Behind the Music\", while Music & Media magazine referred to the song as \"catchy beyond belief\".\nIn the US, \"All My Love\" peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 17 on the Hot R&B Singles chart, number 14 on the Rhythmic Top 40, and number 11 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. In Canada, the track rose to number 21 on the RPM Dance ranking. On May 3, 1998, \"All My Love\" debuted at its peak of number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, staying in the top 100 for five weeks. Across the rest of Europe, the single entered the top 50 in France and Germany. The record was a number-one hit in New Zealand, where it stayed atop the RIANZ Singles Chart for four weeks, earned a gold certification for selling over 5,000 copies, and ended 1998 as the country's 13th-most-successful song.\nTrack listings\nUS CD and cassette single\n# \"All My Love\" (LP version) – 3:25\n# \"No Diggity\" (Das Diggity radio) – 4:25\nUK CD single\n# \"All My Love\" (radio edit) – 3:50\n# \"All My Love\" (album version) – 3:25\n# \"Party Ain't a Party\" (remix) – 4:36\n# \"Party Ain't a Party\" (album version) – 4:09\nUK 12-inch single\n:A1. \"All My Love\" (album version) – 3:25\n:A2. \"All My Love\" (radio edit) – 3:50\n:B1. \"Party Ain't a Party\" (remix) – 4:36\n:B2. \"Party Ain't a Party\" (album version) – 4:09\nUK cassette single\n# \"All My Love\" (radio edit) – 3:50\n# \"All My Love\" (album version) – 3:25\nEuropean CD single\n# \"All My Love\" (radio mix) – 3:26\n# \"All My Love\" (hook first) – 3:51\nEuropean maxi-CD single\n# \"All My Love\" (radio mix) – 3:26\n# \"All My Love\" (hook first) – 3:51\n# Excerpts from My Melody (\"It's True\"/\"Get Away\"/\"Girlfriend\")\nPersonnel\nPersonnel are lifted from the US CD single liner notes.\n* Jay-Z – writing (as Shawn Carter)\n* Teddy Riley – writing, all instruments, production, programming, arrangement\n* Queen Pen – writing (as Lynise Walters), vocals\n* Luther Vandross – writing (\"Never Too Much\")\n* Eric Williams – featured vocals\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1998)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|53\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)\n|7\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|28\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot R&B Singles (Billboard)\n|17\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot Rap Singles (Billboard)\n|11\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Rhythmic Top 40 (Billboard)\n|14\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1998)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (RIANZ)\n|13\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US R&B Singles (Billboard)\n|85\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Rhythmic Top 40 (Billboard)\n|64\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|United States\n|November 24, 1997\n|Urban radio\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|\n|-\n|January 20, 1998\n|CD\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|April 27, 1998\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
