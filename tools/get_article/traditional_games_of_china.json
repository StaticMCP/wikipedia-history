The game is explained in the Book of Rites, one of the Five Confucian Classics. Pitch-pot traditionally was governed by many rules of etiquette, as explained in the Book of Rites, though nowadays the game has more informal versions.\nFlower Stick\nIn flower stick, players perform various tricks using a flower stick, which is a unique Chinese cultural activity.\nVariations of tag\nChicken vs eagle\nIn this game, one player is the eagle, another player is the chicken, and the remaining players are chicks. The chicks form a line behind the chicken by holding each other's waists, and the goal of the eagle is to tag the chicks, while the chicken tries to prevent this by holding their arms out and moving around. Throughout the game, the chicks must stay in the line formation, and if one of them is tagged, then they become the eagle.\nCatch the dragon's tail\nAll the players line up by holding each other's waists, with the player in the front known as the \"dragon\", and the player in the back known as the \"tail\". The goal of the dragon is to tag the tail, while all other players aim to prevent this by moving around. The players must stay in the line formation throughout the game, and once the dragon tags the tail, the players all move up one spot, with the former dragon now at the back of the line.\nCat and mouse\nAll but two of the players form a circle around a player called the \"mouse\", with one player known as the \"cat\" staying outside of the circle. The encircling players rotate around the mouse for a certain amount of time, and once they stop, the cat tries to tag the mouse while both players run in and out of the circle, though the cat has to follow the exact path taken by the mouse.\nMartial arts\nBoard games\nGo\nGo is a board game in which players attempt to surround their opponents' pieces on the board with their own pieces in order to \"capture\" the opponents' pieces. The player that captures the most overall territory on the board wins the game.\nXiangqi\nXiangqi is a board game with similarities to chess.\nGambling games\nPai gow\nPai gow is a gambling game played with dominoes, in which the goal is to get four tiles with numbers that add up to nine or more.\nBoat racing\nDragon boat\nDragon boat racing is over 2,000 years old, with either 10 or 20 participants trying to row the dragon boat as fast as possible.\nMinority games\nThese games are played only by certain minority groups (ethnic or regional) in China.\nPearl ball\nPearl ball is a Manchu game which is similar to basketball. Six players from each team compete on a 28x15m court, with the goal of the offense being to shoot the ball into a small net held by one of their teammates, while some of the defenders have paddles they can use to deflect the ball away from the net.\nSee also\n* Traditional games of South Asia\nReferences"
