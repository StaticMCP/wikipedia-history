Although released in 2003, coinciding with the reimagined miniseries, the game itself is based on the original show from 1978.\nGameplay\nDuring the combat, the performance of all missiles can be adjusted at any time, where the players can balance between speed and power, or blast radius and turning radius. The game judges the player's performance through categories at the end of each mission, and accordingly gives medals for that. Every mission can be replayed for more gold and extras, ranging from various art to certain codes that change the game.\nPlot\nThe game follows the younger Adama's career during the First Cylon War, as he battles against the Cylon ships.\nReception\n| MC_XBOX= 63/100\n| GamePro_PS2 =\n| GamePro_XBOX =\n| GameRev_PS2 = C\n| GameRev_XBOX = C\n| GameZone_PS2= 8/10\n| GameZone_XBOX= 7/10\n| GSpot_PS2 = 7.1/10\n| GSpot_XBOX = 7.1/10\n| IGN_PS2 = 7.4/10\n| IGN_XBOX = 7.4/10\n| JXV_PS2 = 10/20\n| JXV_XBOX = 10/20\n| OPM_PS2= 5/10\n| OXM_XBOX = 7/10\n| TX_XBOX = 6.7/10\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* 2003 Battlestar Galactica video game at Battlestar Wiki"
