It contains 1,400 vegetarian recipes from soups to desserts.\nReception\nIn 2017 Washington Post Food Editor Joe Yonan listed it as one of three must-have classic vegetarian cookbooks.\nIn a review of Vegetarian Cooking For Everyone, Gourmet magazine wrote \"Before you even read a word, the clean type, elegant, well-organized layout, and helpful illustrations reassure you that you won't be pulling your hair out trying to follow a recipe. And then Madison's warm, knowledgeable prose pulls you in.\"\nMichael Ruhlman noted \"For all these reasons, in the 17 years I've been writing about cooks and cooking, I have purchased a single cookbook, several years ago, for myself, a single book to inspire me and broaden my culinary imagination: \"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,\" by Deborah Madison, ..\" and The New Yorker \"found Madison to be a charming and non-threatening psychopomp into the realm of what I imagined to be the half-dead, the eaters of what she frequently calls “plant food,” which, to me, sounded like “fish food.”\"\nPublishers Weekly gave a starred review writing \"Many have tried to create a reliable, encyclopedic vegetarian cookbook, but few have succeeded. Madison (The Greens Cookbook; The Savory Way) comes through with a weighty volume..\" and called it an \"incredibly complete and triumphant effort.\"\nAwards\n*1998 IACP Cookbook of the Year - winner\n*1998 James Beard Vegetarian Book Award - winner\n*2008 Gourmet August Cookbook Club Pick\n*2016 James Beard Cookbook Hall of Fame\nThe New Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone\nIn 2014 Madison published a revised version about which The Wall Street Journal wrote \"Ms. Madison shows herself to be a formidable teacher not just of vegetarian cooking but of imaginative cooking generally.\"\nSee also\n* Vegetarian cuisine\nReferences"
