Name !! License !! Platform !! class=\"unsortable\" | Details\n|-\n| Audacity|| GPL v2 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || General purpose audio editing tool.\n|-\n|Anabat Insight\n|Proprietary\n|Windows, Macintosh\n|Designed for bat call analysis; allows users to view, listen to, manage, search, analyse, and report on recordings in full spectrum or zero crossing. Includes a plugin to Bat Classify.\n|-\n| Avisoft SASLab Pro|| Proprietary || Windows || Contains tools for automatically measuring parameters such as duration and frequency.\n|-\n| BCID|| Proprietary || Windows || Identification software for zero-crossing and full-spectrum bat calls.\n|-\n| Luscinia|| GPL v2 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || File recorder, editor, and manager. Displays spectrograms of sound; allows database archiving of wildlife sound recordings; computational comparison of sound using dynamic time warping; clustering analysis; syntactical analysis of animal vocal signals; visual comparison of spectrograms.\n|-\n| Praat|| GPL v2 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || Functions:  Speech analysis (spectrograms, pitch, formant, and intensity analysis, and other metrics), labelling and segmentation of signal (ex. using the phonetic alphabet), learning algorithms (feedforward neural networks and discrete and stochastic Optimality Theory), graphics (produce PNG, PDF, and EPS files), speech synthesis, listening experiments, speech manipulation (change pitch and duration contours and filtering), statistics (multidimensional scaling, principle components analysis, discriminant analysis), and programmability (uses an \"easy programmable scripting language\")\n|-\n| Raven|| Proprietary || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || Program for the acquisition, visualization, measurement, and analysis of sounds.\n|-\n| SeaWave & SeaPro || Proprietary || Windows || Software for sound recording with real-time high resolution spectrographic display - File Analysis and replay at different speed - up to 192&nbsp;kHz with standard audio boards - time aligned file splitting to record continuously for days and weeks. The research version supports up to 16 channels. Compatible with Dodotronic UltraMic 200k and 250k ultrasonic USB microphones.\n|-\n| Sonobat|| Proprietary || Macintosh, Windows || Provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing and comparing high-resolution full-spectrum sonogram of bat echolocation calls recorded from time-expansion bat detectors.\n|-\n| Sound Analysis Pro 2011|| GPL v2 || Windows || Performs automated recording and analysis of animal vocalization. It can record, analyze and manage sound data over prolonged periods.\n|-\n| SoundRuler||GPL v2 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || Focused on teaching acoustics. Can record and edit.\n|-\n| Syrinx-PC|| Freeware || Windows || Program is specifically designed for field use for recording bioacoustics. Has basic analysis capabilities. Can be used to record/edit/analyze/manage.\n|-\n| Song Scope|| Proprietary || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || An easy to use spectrogram viewer. Also allows the building of \"recognizers\" to automatically search field recordings for specific animal vocalizations.\n|-\n| Kaleidoscope|| Proprietary || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || Kaleidoscope is an integrated suite of bioacoustics tools which allows converting file formats, viewing spectrograms, creating classifiers for birds, bats, frogs, and other species, sorting and categorizing bat data by species in North America, Europe, South Africa and the Neotropics, and generating reports.\n|-\n| Bioacoustics|| GPL v3 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || Bioacoustics is a free R package available in [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bioacoustics/index.html CRAN] to analyze audio recordings and automatically extract animal vocalizations. ItcContains all the necessary tools to process audio recordings of various formats (e.g., WAV, WAC, MP3, ZC), filter noisy files, display audio signals, detect and extract automatically acoustic features for further analysis such as classification.\"\n|-\n| monitoR || GPL v2 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || monitoR is a package for use in R, and is available for free from [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/monitoR/index.html CRAN]. From its description: \"Acoustic template detection and monitoring database interface. Create, modify, save, and use templates for detection of animal vocalizations. View, verify, and extract results. Upload a MySQL schema to a existing instance, manage survey metadata, write and read templates and detections locally or to the database.\"\n|-\n| seewave|| GPL v2 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || seewave is a package for use in R, and is available from [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seewave/index.html CRAN]. From its description: \"seewave provides functions for analysing, manipulating, displaying, editing and synthesizing time waves (particularly sound). This package processes time analysis (oscillograms and envelopes), spectral content, resonance quality factor, entropy, cross correlation and autocorrelation, zero-crossing, dominant frequency, analytic signal, frequency coherence, 2D and 3D spectrograms and many other analyses.\"\n|-\n| BatScope 4|| Freeware || Macintosh & Windows || Archiving, data management, analysis of sound recordings for bat surveys. Supports files primarily from BatLogger, but also BatCorder and standard .wav files.\n|-\n| BatExplorer|| Proprietary, Freeware || Windows || Archiving, data management, analysis of sound recordings for bat surveys. Supports only files from BatLogger.\n|-\n| bcAdmin-bcAnalyze-batident|| Proprietary || Macintosh || Archiving, data management, analysis of sound recordings for bat surveys. Supports bat corder raw and wave files.\n|-\n|PAMGuard\n|GPL v3\n|Windows (parts will run under Linux)\n|Open Source software for the Detection Classification and Localisation (DCL) of marine mammal sounds. Can process hydrophone data in real time or can process files offline. Interactive displays allow the user to annotate data and link sounds for tracking using target motion analysis.\n|-\n| AviaNZ|| GPL v3 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || Open source software for bioacoustic analysis, focusing on automatic processing of long-term recordings. Includes pre-built detectors for several species of New Zealand bats and birds, and allows creating detectors for any other sounds.\n|-\n| OpenEcho|| GPL v3 || Linux, Macintosh, Windows || First open source tool for AI-assisted bioacoustic analysis of long-term bat recordings.\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nSee also\n* Free software\n* Open-Source Software\n* General Public License (GPL)"
