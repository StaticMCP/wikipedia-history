The monument was  established on April 18, 1924, to protect its extensive hoodoos and balancing rocks. The Faraway Ranch, which was owned at one time by Swedish immigrants Neil and Emma Erickson, is also preserved within the monument.\nJust over 85% of the monument is protected as the Chiricahua National Monument Wilderness.\nGeology\nLocated approximately  southeast of Willcox, Arizona, the monument preserves the remains of an immense volcanic eruption that shook the region about 27 million years ago. The thick, white-hot ash spewed forth from the nearby Turkey Creek Caldera, cooled and hardened into rhyolitic tuff, laying down almost  of highly siliceous, dark volcanic ash and pumice. The volcanic material eventually eroded into the natural rock formations of the present monument.\nHistory\nPresident Calvin Coolidge established the national monument with the Antiquities Act on April 18, 1924. It was expanded by President Franklin Roosevelt on June 10, 1938.\nMissing naturalist\nOn January 13, 1980, Paul Fugate, a National Park Service naturalist and law enforcement ranger, disappeared after leaving the monument headquarters while in uniform, to check trails leading to the recently acquired Faraway Ranch. An acquaintance claimed to have seen him later that afternoon, slumped between two men in a pickup truck. Despite an extensive search of the rugged  monument area by authorities and search and rescue teams, no trace of him has been found.\nHistoric Designed Landscape\n| governing_body =\n| mpsub=Historic Park Landscapes in National and State Parks MPS\n| refnum=08001020\n| nocat = yes\n}}\nChiricahua National Monument Historic Designed Landscape is a historic district that covers roughly 80% of the national monument. The district  was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 31, 2008.\nIt was the 18th property listed as a featured property of the week in a program of the National Park Service that began in July 2008.\nProposed redesignation\nIn 2022, the US Senate passed S. 1320 to redesignate the monument as a national park. The bill did not make it out of committee in the House and died with the conclusion of the 117th Congress.  In early 2023, Senator Mark Kelly introduced S. 736 in the Senate, while Representative Juan Ciscomani introduced HR 1479 in the House to redesignate the Monument as a Park. The 2023 bills passed out of committee in the Senate but have not passed out of committee in the House.\nVisitor center\nA visitor center is located  from the entrance to Chiricahua National Monument.
