Carried out through a system of electors, they resulted in the election of General Joaquín Prieto as president.\nBackground\nFollowing the victory by the conservatives at the Battle of Lircay, which put an end to the Chilean Civil War of 1829–30, order was restored. A new Congress was elected, and a call for presidential elections was made. A restricted number of citizens voted for electors, who in turn voted to elect a new president.\nOn June 2, the day following the first session of the new Congress, the vote recount took place. Joaquín Prieto was elected president, and Diego Portales vice president. The position of Vice President was later abolished with the Constitution of 1833.\nResults\n|votes4=2\n|cand5=Fernando Errázuriz Aldunate|votes5=1\n|source=Chilean Elections Database}}\nReferences"
