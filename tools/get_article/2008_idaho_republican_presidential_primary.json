John McCain won the primary, although before the election he had already won enough pledged delegates in earlier primaries to secure his nomination at the 2008 Republican National Convention.\nTexas Congressman Ron Paul finished second with 24 percent of the vote, which was his best showing in a primary state even though McCain had been declared the presumptive Republican nominee several weeks before the Idaho primary.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+100% of precincts reporting\n|-\n!
