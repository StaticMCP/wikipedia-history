The 30-hectare site is located near the top of Mount Taesong (Taesongsan) in the Taesong-guyŏk, just outside Pyongyang, capital of North Korea.\nThe cemetery with hundreds of tombs was completed in 1975 and in October 1985 was renovated and expanded. Its design inspired the design of two African cemeteries, National Heroes' Acre in Zimbabwe and Heroes' Acre in Namibia.\nDescription\nThe entrance to the cemetery is marked by a monumental gate in Korean style. Each of the graves is provided with a bronze bust. At the far end of the memorial there is a conspicuous red flag made of granite. Heo-nik Kwon and Byung-Ho Chung (2012) covered the cemetery in their publication North Korea: Beyond Charismatic Politics, noting the cemetery's significance in politics, where it can not only satisfy the North Korean need for revolutionary narratives, but also compensate for its large-scale absence of ordinary military cemeteries.\nNotable people buried\n* Kim Pohyŏn, father of Kim Hyong-jik, grandfather of Kim Il Sung\n* Kim Jong-suk, first wife of Kim Il Sung.\n* Kang Pan-sok, mother of Kim Il Sung.\n* Kim Ch'aek, general and politician.\n* Nam Il, general and politician.\n* Ri Yong-suk, politician.\n* Hyŏn Chun-hyŏk, politician.\nSee also\n* Kumsusan Palace of the Sun\n* Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery\n* Daejeon National Cemetery\n* Seoul National Cemetery\n* National Heroes' Acre (Zimbabwe)\n* Heroes' Acre (Namibia)\n* Feldherrnhalle\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/video/?patriot+680+420 Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery on Mt.
