Max discovers stone slabs and finds dinosaurs are calling them for help. An evil organization called the \"Alpha Gang\", led by the nefarious Dr. Z, traveled back in time to hunt down the dinosaurs and use them to take over the world. It is up to Max and Rex to travel around the world, defeating Dr. Z and the Alpha Gang while hunting down the dinosaurs (later, the story varies as the arcade game machine keeps on upgrading).\nAnime\nIn the first season, Max Taylor and his friends Rex Owen and Zoe Drake form the D-team in an effort to control the dinosaur cards. Max Taylor controls a Triceratops named Chomp, Zoe has a Parasaurolophus named Paris, and Rex Owen controls a Carnotaurus named Ace.\nThe three are opposed by the Alpha Gang, a group from 2126 AD who desire to control the dinosaur cards and the six tablets in order to control the world. Ursula is the boss of the group; her running gag is the ability to hear the phrase \"old lady\" from anywhere in the world. Ursula controls a T-Rex named Terry.\nZander pays for the equipment, and is in love with Zoe Drake's older sister, Reese. He controls a Spinosaurus named Spiny. Ed is slow to understand things, is shorter and often jinxes the team by predicting good fortunes or likely bad outcomes. He controls Tank, a Saichania.\nMedia\nAnime\nList of Dinosaur King episodes}}\nThe series was adapted into an anime television series, , which is made by Sunrise and premiered on TV Asahi on February 4, 2007.

After its airing, the anime received a range of mixed to positive reviews from critics.\nFirst season\nMax Taylor is the son of paleontologist Dr. Spike Taylor. After falling out of bed early one morning and witnessing a meteor fall from the sky, Max sets out with his friends Rex Owen and Zoe Drake into a forest where the meteor had crashed. They find stones with the symbols for lightning, wind, and grass on them and a card with a picture of a Triceratops on it. The Triceratops that is later named Chomp is accidentally activated when Max rubs the card on the stone. The D-Team meet their new enemies in the Alpha Gang consisting of Dr. Z, Ursula, Zander, Ed, Seth, Laura, Rod, Helga, and the Alpha Droids. The Alpha Gang plans to obtain the Dinosaur Cards that were lost when their time machine exploded and stranded them in the present. Rex activated a Carnotaurus card which was named Ace and Zoe activated a Parasaurolophus which was named Paris. The D-Team and Alpha Gang often clash for possession of dinosaurs that are activated when their cards are activated. In the finale, Seth turns on his comrades with his Black Tyrannosaurus which is ultimately defeated. Seth attempts to bring Chomp back to the past which fails and Seth is sent into the past alone. The D-Team surrender their dinosaurs to Rex's original parents, with many tears.\nSecond season\nIn the second series, the Alpha Gang and the Ancients return. While the parents are talking, they are kidnapped by Gavro, a member of the Spectral Space Pirates.

Seth later returns as an ally to the Spectral Space Pirates after they saved him from the time portal. Spectre, the leader of the Space Pirates, provides the dinosaur cards. In episode 75, Seth seems to become a traitor as he appeals to the D-Team for help saying that they forced him to help them, but it was really a trick to get the two Cosmos Stones in D-Team's control, despite the fact that he attacks and defeats his comrades two episodes later. In the end although the Spectral Space Pirates manage to catch all seven Cosmos Stones, Seth and the Pterosaur defeat the Black Pterosaur. Rex, his parents, and the Alpha Gang leave to their own time as the Spectral Space Pirates are floating around in a pod.\nVideo game\nA video game based on the series was released by Sega for the Nintendo DS on September 23, 2008.\nOther media\nThe Dinosaur King Trading Card game was released in the fall of 2008 by the Upper Deck Company.
