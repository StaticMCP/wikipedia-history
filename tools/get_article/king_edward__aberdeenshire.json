The last service in the old church was on 25 June 1848, after which services moved to new building alongside the main road.\nThe Castle of King Edward is a 13th-century ruined castle located approximately one mile south of the village where the A947 crosses the King Edward Burn.\nKing Edward station stood on the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway part of the Great North of Scotland Railway system.\nFamous inhabitants\nProbably the best known inhabitant was William Guild who was minister at the church from 1608 to 1631. Dr Guild went on to become principal at King's College, Aberdeen. Guild Street in Aberdeen is named after him.\nEtymology\nThe name itself has nothing to do with any \"King Edward\", but is a corruption of an earlier Scottish Gaelic name. The first element \"King\", usually appears as \"kin\" in Scottish placenames, and derives from \"Ceann\" meaning a headland. The second element is less certain but may derive from \"Eadar\" (between) or \"cathair-thalmhainn\" (yarrow).\nThe parish of King Edward has had approx 24 variations of the name: Kynedor (12th Century), Kynedward and Kinedart to name a few.\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060520025256/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/SESLL/STELLA/STARN/lang/GAELIC/evident.htm Origins of King Edward]\n*The Church of King Edward, Aberdeenshire, James Godsman"
