It was introduced as a result of the discontinuation of the Best News/Current Affairs Presenter award to create distinctions news and current affairs presenters.\nThe award was given in honour of a Mediacorp presenter who has delivered an outstanding performance in a current affairs programme. The nominees were determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp; winners were selected by a majority vote from the entire judging panel. Chun Guek Lay is the inaugural winner in this category for her performance in Focus.\nThe award was given to three presenters in the 4 years that the award was presented before its final appearance as an awar in 2013. Chun and Tung Soo Hua were the final winners for their performances in Focus and Money Week respectively. Since the ceremony held in 2013, Chun is also the only presenter to win in this category three times, surpassing Tung who has two wins. Desmond Lim and Qi Qi hold the record for the most nominations without a win.\nThe award was discontinued since 2014.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Presenter\n! Title\n!
