      "text": "# Dream Chemistry Award\n\nThe Dream Chemistry Award is an international competition for young scientists organized by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences (IOCB Prague) and the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\nThe competition was established in 2013 by Robert Hołyst and the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the PAS in Warsaw, with the next competition taking place in 2015. In 2017, IOCB Prague started co-sponsoring the event, and since then the competition has been held every year alternately in Prague and Warsaw.\nThe competition awards visionary projects from the field of chemistry or chemistry-related disciplines that have the ambition and potential to change the world for the better. The contest is for scientists who are younger than 38 years of age who have been nominated by respected experts. The winner of the contest receives a financial reward of €10,000. In addition, starting in 2019, the finalists receive a reward of €1,000.\nThe coordinators of the competition are Pavel Jungwirth from IOCB Prague and Robert Hołyst from the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the PAS. The members of the Honorary Committee include Josef Michl and Richard R. Schrock, the laureate of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nRecipients\n2024\nWinner:\n* Richard Liu (Harvard University, USA), Project: Organic Molecules That Mimic Transition Metals for Sustainable Chemical Synthesis\nFinalists:\n* Maxx Arguilla (University of California Irvine, USA), Project: Bioinspired Design of Atomically Precise All-Inorganic Chains for Atomic Scale Integrated Circuitry\n* Mathijs Mabesoone (Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands), Project: Data-Driven Evolution of Sustainable Peptide Materials\n* Raya Sorkin (Tel Aviv University, Israel), Project: Novel Non Hormonal Contraceptives\n* Zhiling Zheng (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA), Project: Programmable and Tunable Chemical Structures from Molecular Building Units\n2023\nWinner:\n* Mark Levin (University of Chicago, USA), Project: Skeletal Editing: Enabling Synthesis that Matches Design\nFinalists:\n* Aisha Bismillah (University of York, UK), Project: Noncovalent Control of ‘Shapeshifting’ Molecules\n* Moran Frenkel-Pinter (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel), Project: Emergence of Primordial Peptide Replicators\n* Francesca Grisoni (Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands), Project: Revolutionizing AI for Molecule Discovery with Artificial Chemical Intuition\n* Barak Hirshberg (Tel Aviv University, Israel), Project: A Computational Molecular Sculptor\n2022\nWinner:\n* Carl Brozek (University of Oregon, USA), Project: Capturing Energy with Controllable Chaos\nFinalists:\n* Ahmed Badran (The Scripps Research Institute, USA), Project: Chemical Reprogramming of Biological CO2 Capture to Reverse Climate Change\n* Claudia Contini (Imperial College London, UK), Project: Biohybrid Robotics: The Potential of Artificial Cells\n* Liang Feng (Northwestern University, USA), Project: Active Artificial Molecular Factories\n* Ghislaine Vantomme (Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands), Project: Supramolecular Materials for the Next Computing Paradigm\n2021\nWinner:\n* Jarad Mason (Harvard University, USA), Project: Treating Hypoxia with Microporous Water\nFinalists:\n* Ahmed Badran (The Scripps Research Institute, USA), Project: Universal Codon Reassignment Using a de novo Orthogonal Genetic Code\n* Johannes Bintinger (Linköping University, Sweden), Project: Star Trek SWITCH\n* Luka Đorđević (University of Oregon, USA), Project: The Dark Side of Photocatalysis\n* Giulio Ragazzon (Universite de Strasbourg, ISIS, France), Project: Endergonic Reactions Enabled by Catalytic Processes\n* Ghislaine Vantomme (Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands), Project: Supramolecular Wires for Brain-Inspired Computing\n2020\nWinner:\n* Claudia Bonfio (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and University of Cambridge, UK), Project: Unlocking Primitive Chemical Messages\nFinalists:\n* Ivana Drienovska (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Project: New-to-Nature Reactivities in Biocatalysis: A Closer Look at Enzymatic Fluorination\n* Pawel Dydio (Universite de Strasbourg, ISIS, France), Project: Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Chemistry of the Future\n* Christopher Hendon (University of Oregon, USA), Project: A Chemical Fix for Bad Beverages\n* Yunyan Qiu (Northwestern University, USA), Project: Achieving the Holy Grail of Polymer Synthesis Using Catalytic Artificial Molecular Machines\n2019\nWinner:\n* Yujia Qing (University of Oxford, United Kingdom), Project: Sequencing life\nFinalists:\n* Emiliano Cortés (Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany)\n* Jeffrey D.
