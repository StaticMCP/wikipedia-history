They were described as \"combining elements of prog, alt, hard, and classic rock into a loud, but accessible mix,\" and list the Smashing Pumpkins, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin as musical inspirations. Those Mockingbirds began by playing shows across the Northeast of the United States, and promoting the band at places like shopping malls and parking lots.\nIn April 2010, they released their first studio recording No Symmetry, which features heavy keyboard effects and \"sugary vocals,\" on their own label, L.E. Records, with distribution from SideCho Records. It was produced by Those Mockingbirds and former editor-in-chief of Revolver Magazine Tom Beaujour, and recorded at Nuthouse Studio & White Heat Studio. No Symmetry debuted at No. 1 on Amazon's Movers & Shakers chart. A video was released that indicated Those Mockingbirds kidnapped Gary Brolsma, known from the Numa Numa internet meme video, for a ransom of 50,000 downloads of their single \"Honest? Honest.\" The music video for the song was released later that year, after it achieved 50,000 downloads. Those Mockingbirds were part of the New Brunswick-based artist collective Tiny Giant. The next single Those Mockingbirds released was a studio cover of \"The Chain\" by Fleetwood Mac in January 2011, which was recorded by Shawn Kimon, and produced by Those Mockingbirds at The Wild Arctic in Queens, New York. In February 2011, Those Mockingbirds filmed a Fearless Music session for the Fox television network WNYW. They released a limited edition compact disc of BETA: alpha during a show with Smoking Popes and Girl in a Coma, at Mexicali Live in Teaneck, New Jersey on May 6, 2011.

On January 31, 2012, Starbeat Music released Fa Sol La on 12\"-vinyl, which featured an alternate version of track of \"Coast to Coast.\" The commercial FM radio station WRAT ran a week-long promotional campaign that culminated in the debut of the song \"The Difference Between Love and Addiction\" a few days before it was made available online. It is described by Speak Into My Good Eye as \"a spiraling composition with jagged, flame-licked peaks, charred to the core by the fierce fret-work.\" It was produced by Those Mockingbirds, and recorded by Pat Noon at Eight 16 Studios. Those Mockingbirds performed at the Northside Festival on June 14, 2012, and in July they opened for Armor for Sleep's New York City reunion show at Irving Plaza.
