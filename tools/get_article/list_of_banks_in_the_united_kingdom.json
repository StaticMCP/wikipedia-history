Its primary objective is to promote the safety and soundness of these institutions, thereby contributing to the financial stability of the UK.\nThe banks on this list include both UK-incorporated banks (often referred to as 'local' banks) and non-UK banks that have established a presence in the UK.\nBanks\nUK banks\nAccording to data from the UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), as of July 2025, there are 150 locally incorporated banks in the UK, with several banking groups holding multiple banking licences.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #012169; color:white; text-align: center;\" | Banks incorporated in United Kingdom\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Notes:RFB: Ring-fenced bodies.
