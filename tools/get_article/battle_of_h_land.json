The Norwegian troops were taken completely off guard and forced to surrender, resulting in 75 men being captured, while only a few managed to escape. After receiving news of the garrison's defeat, Norwegian general  decided to send a force of his own consisting of 216 troops in order to aid the ones captured at Høland.\nAfter arriving at Høland, Kruse launched an attack that managed to surprise the Swedish troops. However, after overcoming the initial shock of the attack, the Swedes managed to regroup and launch a successful counterattack against the Norwegians. By the end of the engagement, the Swedes had suffered at least 28 killed and wounded. On the Norwegian side, Kruse was captured along with 10 of his men, 31 Norwegian soldiers were killed and 47 more wounded.\nAftermath\nFollowing the victory, a good opportunity presented itself for Charles and his men to quickly march further into Norwegian territory and end the campaign in a victory for Sweden. However, a snow blizzard would end this opportunity and they would instead be stuck in Høland for some days.\nReferences"
