For the first time in the Logie Awards 50-year history, there was no host for the ceremony, but only a series of presenters. Also for the first time, the public were able to vote online for the \"Most Popular\" categories without needing to buy a copy of TV Week. The nominations were announced on 7 April 2008. Hamish Blake and Andy Lee were the backstage hosts, while Jules Lund, Livinia Nixon and Shelley Craft were the red carpet arrivals hosts.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the tables below, winners are listed first and highlighted in bold.\nGold Logie\n{| class=wikitable width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\"| Most Popular Personality on Australian Television\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Kate Ritchie in Home and Away (Seven Network)'\n**Natalie Blair in Neighbours (Network Ten)\n**Andrew Denton in Enough Rope (ABC1)\n**Adam Hills in Spicks and Specks (ABC1)\n**John Howard in All Saints (Seven Network)\n**Chris Lilley in Summer Heights High (ABC1)\n**Lisa McCune in Sea Patrol (Nine Network)\n**Rove McManus in Rove and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?
