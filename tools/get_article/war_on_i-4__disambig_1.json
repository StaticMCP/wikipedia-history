The rivalry is best known for its college football matchup which originated in a series of football games played from 2005 to 2008 and now takes place on Thanksgiving weekend, the de facto \"rivalry weekend\" for FBS football. From 2013 to 2023, when both schools were part of the American Athletic Conference, the schools began competing annually in all sports both schools sponsored (with the 1993–94 season being the only other season the schools competed in every sport both schools sponsored). In 2016, the schools officially adopted the \"War on I-4\" as an official competition series. Each year, the team with the most wins across all sports receives a gold trophy styled after an Interstate 4 (I-4) road sign with the logos of each school. The winner of the annual football game also receives a similar trophy.\n| zoom=6\n| width= 250\n| height= 200\n| caption=Locations of South Florida and UCF\n| mark1=Green pog.svg\n| label1=South Florida\n| mark-coord1=\n| label-pos1=top\n| label-color1=#006747\n| mark2=Gold pog.svg\n| label2=UCF\n| mark-coord2=\n| label-pos2=top\n| label-color2=#BA9B37\n}}\nAs of September 4, 2025, South Florida holds the all-time series lead for seven of the ten sports in which the schools meet head-to-head: baseball (86–85), men's basketball (28–19), women's basketball (32–17), men's soccer (), men's tennis (37–15), women's tennis (20–12) and volleyball (50–45); but UCF disputes the all time records in baseball, women's basketball, men's soccer, and volleyball, claiming the Bulls' records in these sports are 83–84, 29–14, , and 48–44, respectively. The only sports where UCF leads the all time head-to-head series are women's soccer (), softball (23–19), football (8–6), and conference championship meets (37–9, though South Florida leads 6–3 in Men's Golf). UCF leads the all time trophy series 7–0 (potentially 9–0 if the trophy continued to be awarded after they left the AAC for the Big 12).\nThe Knights also led overall while both schools were in the American Athletic Conference with a  record in conference games against the Bulls across all sports, whereas the all-time total across all sports is  in favor of the Bulls. The Knights lead  all time in conference tournament matches and the teams are tied  in conference championship games (though South Florida has actually won five conference championships head-to-head against the Knights; the tie denotes that their 2017 women's soccer title was won on penalty kicks). The Bulls are 6–4 against UCF in NCAA tournament games and 1–0 in other postseason meetings, making the overall postseason total  in favor of the Bulls.\nAs the schools are now in separate conferences, they meet less often in sporting events than they did from 2013 to 2023.\nThe most recent meeting was on September 4, 2025, in Men's Soccer, a game that both schools tied 1–1 in Tampa.\nThere are currently no future games currently scheduled between the two schools in any NCAA-sanctioned sport.\nNames\nStarting when the schools first met on the gridiron in 2005, some writers dubbed the rivalry the \"War on I-4\". When the series resumed in 2013, administrators from both schools named it the \"I-4 Corridor Clash\". Both names refer to Interstate 4, an interstate highway that runs through both Orlando and Tampa. In 2016, when the schools announced the official competition, they formally adopted the \"War on I-4\" name.\nThe name \"War on I-4\" had previously been used for an arena football rivalry between the Tampa Bay Storm and Orlando Predators from 1992 to 2016. The Storm and Predators were located in the same metropolitan areas as South Florida and UCF respectively and were two of the most successful franchises in the league, with the Storm winning five Arena Bowls and the Predators winning two. The name became available when the Predators folded following the 2016 season.\nSeries history\nBeginning\nFounded in 1956 and 1963, respectively, the University of South Florida and the University of Central Florida are located  away from each other in Tampa and Orlando, which combined make up the fourth-largest media market in the United States. The short distance between the schools, combined with their athletic programs concurrent establishment and rise to NCAA Division I helped create a natural rivalry between the two, which only became stronger when both became members of the American Athletic Conference in 2013. The first meeting between the  then-Florida Technological University Knights of the Pegasus (UCF) and the University of South Florida Golden Brahmans that both schools agree happened (South Florida claims the schools played two baseball games in 1971 that UCF does not recognize) was a 1972 men's basketball game in Tampa. The Golden Brahmans won this game, 115–96. Since that game, South Florida and UCF have begun series against each other in eight or nine other sports, depending on which schools' records are used.\nOfficial War on I-4 rivalry\nOn September 21, 2016, the morning of the first meeting of the season between the Bulls and Knights with a volleyball game set to take place in Orlando that evening, both athletic departments announced the official recognition of the “War on I-4” rivalry series. The schools compete each school year in 14 sports for bragging rights, with each sports team's record counting equally toward a final tally for each program.\nTrophy\nThe winner of each the football competition and the overall competition each year takes possession of a large trophy shaped like the iconic I-4 road sign, which will be displayed on their campus for the following year. Each trophy is similar but has a few key differences. The all-sports trophy has the War on I-4 logo on it and features the score of each season's overall competition. It is also significantly larger than the football trophy. The football trophy is dual-sided, with one side of the trophy reading \"Tampa\" and featuring South Florida's logo while the other reads \"Orlando\" and features UCF's logo. The football trophy also has a large base, which is detachable. Including the base, the football trophy measures  tall and weighs . The score of each game is featured on the base.\nUnlike the Vince Lombardi Trophy or Larry O'Brien Trophy, which are permanently awarded to the victor every year, both the football and overall War on I-4 trophies are traveling trophies which are kept by the winner until the other team wins it, similar to the Stanley Cup.\nFuture\nWith UCF leaving the American Athletic Conference for the Big 12 Conference at the start of the 2023–24 school year, it is unclear whether the rivalry series will continue in the current format, especially considering the schools are guaranteed to no longer meet in golf, cross country, or track and field. It is likely that football in particular will be on hiatus until at least 2031, because that is the next year when both teams have multiple openings in their non-conference schedules.\nIt is unknown if the trophy is still being awarded, albeit with fewer sports than before, with the winner being based on those meetings, or if the trophy series is put on hold, as South Florida has yet to win the point series since the trophy was introduced, hence no changing of hands has been required with the trophy. Neither school has acknowledged the trophy since 2023.\nFrom 2023 to 2024, South Florida and UCF only met in a 3-game series in baseball, and a single Men's Tennis and Women's Soccer game, plus a postseason meeting in men's basketball via the 2024 National Invitation Tournament.\nFor 2024–25, South Florida and UCF only played single games of Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer, and Women's Tennis, along with two games for Men's Tennis, and a 3-game series in baseball.\nPoint system\nSince September 21, 2016, when the rivalry series was officially established, South Florida and UCF have scored their competitions in the 14 sports represented at both universities (South Florida is the only one of the two schools to sponsor men's cross country, women's sailing, and men's track & field while UCF is the only one of the two schools to sponsor women's rowing). Each sport is worth 6 total points, meaning the point system typically grants:\n* 1 point to the winner of each regular season baseball game (6 games per year)\n* 3 points to the winner of each regular season men's basketball game (2 games per year)\n* 3 points to the winner of each regular season women's basketball game (2 games per year)\n* 6 points to the higher finisher at the American Athletic Conference Women's Cross Country Championship\n* 6 points to the winner of the annual football game\n* 6 points to the higher finisher at the American Athletic Conference Men's Golf Championship\n* 6 points to the higher finisher at the American Athletic Conference Women's Golf Championship\n* 6 points to the winner the each regular season men's soccer match (3 points awarded to each side in the event of a draw)\n* 6 points to the winner of the annual regular season women's soccer match (3 points awarded to each side in the event of a draw)\n* 2 points to the winner of each regular season softball game (3 games per year)\n* 6 points to the winner of the annual regular season men's tennis match.\n* 6 points to the winner of the annual regular season women's tennis match.\n* 3 points to the higher finisher at the American Athletic Conference Women's Indoor Track & Field Championship\n* 3 points to the higher finisher at the American Athletic Conference Women's Outdoor Track & Field Championship\n* 3 points to the winner of each regular season volleyball match (2 matches per year)\n* In the event of a tie in the overall competition, the athletic program that scores higher in the annual NCAA Graduation Success Rate will be awarded 1 extra point and crowned as the champion for that season. In the unlikely event that this is also tied, the series ends as a tie for that season and the previous winner retains the trophy.\nIn some years the scoring is slightly different. For example, South Florida and UCF only met once in women's basketball for the 2016–2017 season, so that game was worth all 6 points. Likewise, in 2020 and 2021 the sides played two men's soccer matches instead of one, which were worth 3 points each and awarded 1.5 points to each in the event of a draw. In all, there are 84 available points with 43 points required to clinch the title. As mentioned above, only regular season matches are counted toward War on I-4 point totals for the 10 sports in which the teams compete head-to-head, meaning if the Bulls and Knights meet in an exhibition game, conference championship, NCAA tournament, or a football bowl game, that game would not count for War on I-4 competition purposes.\nTrophy series results\nUCF clinched the first academic year's overall title with an AAC women's golf championship on April 18, 2017. The 2016–17 competition ended on May 20 with a 3–2 Knights victory in a baseball game, making the final point total 51 points to 33 points for UCF.\nOn April 17, 2018, the Knights clinched the overall title for the second consecutive year, again in the AAC women's golf championship. UCF finished second in the event, while South Florida finished ninth. The series concluded on May 13 with UCF placing higher than South Florida in the 2018 American Athletic Conference outdoor track and field competition and led to a final series score of 49–35 for UCF.\nUCF clinched the overall title for the third straight year on April 7, 2019, with a 5–0 victory in baseball, the earliest clinch in the competition's history. The series concluded on May 12 with UCF placing higher than South Florida in the American Athletic Conference women's outdoor track and field competition, making the final score 70–14 in favor of the Knights, the largest margin of victory in the competition's history.\nThe 2019–20 edition ended in March due to spring sports being canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. UCF led the series 36–9 at the time of the cancellation and was awarded the victory for the season, even though the schedule was not complete and UCF did not meet the point thresholds for winning in a normal season. This marked UCF's fourth-consecutive win in the War on I-4.\nThe pandemic also caused the point system to slightly change for the 2020–21 edition of the rivalry. The AAC Women's Indoor Track & Field Championship was canceled, so the higher finisher at the AAC Women's Outdoor Track & Field Championship received 6 points instead of 3. Men's tennis and men's soccer both met twice in the regular season instead of once, so each of these matches counted for 3 points toward the victor's total rather than the usual 6. In addition there were four softball games and eight baseball games instead of the usual three of each, so each game was worth 1.5 and 0.75 points respectively rather than 2. UCF clinched the overall competition for the fourth time on April 17, 2021, with a 5–4 baseball win in Orlando. The point series ended on May 16 when UCF finished one place above South Florida in the women's outdoor track and field championship, making the total score 59.25–24.75, but the last meeting of the season between the two schools took place on May 30 when South Florida beat UCF in the 2021 American Athletic Conference baseball tournament championship game, though this did not add to South Florida's point total as it was a postseason meeting.\nFor the 2021–22 season, most of the sports reverted to their usual schedules, with the exception of men's soccer staying at two games per year and baseball changing to six games per year. On April 16, 2022, UCF officially clinched the series for the 2021–22 season, securing the 43 points needed after defeating South Florida 4–0 in women's tennis. The final score for the season was 58–26.\nDuring 2022–23, the final season with both teams in the American Athletic Conference, UCF started out with scoring 24 of the first 30 points (only losing the Men's Soccer game) to take an early commanding 24–6 lead, but South Florida would rally to score 14 of the next 17 points (only being outranked in the Women's AAC Indoor Track & Field Championship) to cut the UCF lead to a closer 27–20 before UCF scored 36 of the last 37 points (losing only one Men's Baseball game) to win in a 63–21 blowout, officially clinching after finishing higher than South Florida in the AAC women's golf championship on April 19, 2023.\nDuring 2023–24, the first non-conference season since 2012–13 and the continued awarding of the trophy being uncertain, the two schools only played regular season games in Women's Soccer, Men's Tennis, and Baseball, resulting in 18 points up for grabs, with 10 needed to win. UCF won the Women's Soccer game to take a 6–0 lead on September 10, which would be the last meeting between the two schools for almost six months before the two schools met again on March 1 in both Men's Tennis and game one of the 3-game baseball series. UCF won both games that day, clinching the point series. South Florida would win one of the two remaining baseball games for a 16–2 UCF win. It is unknown if UCF officially won the trophy this season or not, as they have not officially been announced to have won the trophy, and would retain possession of the trophy regardless of if it was officially awarded this season or not. The two schools would also meet in round one of the 2024 National Invitation Tournament in men's basketball, a meeting which South Florida beat UCF 83–77.\nDuring 2024–25, the two schools only scheduled regular season games in five sports, resulting in 30 points up for grabs, with 16 needed to win. The fall slate included a Women's Soccer game on September 5 and a Men's Soccer game on September 15. South Florida won the Women's Soccer game and tied the Men's Soccer game, giving them a 9–3 lead. The spring slate included Men's Tennis games on February 3 and March 9, a Women's Tennis game on February 9, and a 3-game series in Baseball from February 28 to March 2. UCF won the first Men's Tennis game to cut the South Florida lead to 9–6 before winning the Women's Tennis game to take a 12–9 lead. In Baseball, South Florida won the first game via mercy rule to narrow the UCF lead to 12–11 before UCF returned the favor with two mercy rule wins of their own to clinch the point series. South Florida then won the Men's Tennis game to narrow their loss to 16–14.\nOverall results table\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center font-size; font-size: 85%\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Season\n!Baseball\n!Men's Basketball\n!Women's Basketball\n!Women's Cross Country\n!Football\n!Men's Golf\n!Women's Golf\n!Men's Soccer\n!Women's Soccer\n!Softball\n!Men's Tennis\n!Women's Tennis\n!Women's Track & Field\n!Volleyball\n!

Supporters suggested such a rivalry could help generate interest and revenue for both burgeoning teams. The prospect became more serious when the Bulls entered Division I-A in 2001 and was very popular among fans, but as it would be a non-conference series, difficulties arose. UCF had overbooked its future schedules and would have to break commitments. Meanwhile, South Florida officials worried that their young program stood to take in less revenue from a home-and-away series against UCF than it would with an additional home game on the schedule. Serious planning for a series did not commence until 2003.\nFirst games (2005–2008)\nBy 2003, serious discussions resumed as both schools had joined conferences – South Florida joined Conference USA (C-USA) in 2001, while UCF joined the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in 2002. That year, the schools' athletics directors met and agreed to schedule games for the 2005 and 2006 seasons. Subsequently, South Florida joined the Big East, an Automatic Qualifying conference, in 2005, while UCF joined C-USA the same year. The Bulls won both games, which both drew crowds over 45,000. The series was extended for 2007 and 2008 as part of an agreement with C-USA that the Bulls play a member of the conference annually for five years. South Florida won these games as well, with a 64–12 blowout in 2007 and 31–24 overtime thriller in 2008. South Florida declined to schedule further games in the series, indicating it wished to pursue more competitive and high-profile opponents. During the series hiatus South Florida would go on to play opponents such as Florida, Florida State, Miami, Clemson, and Notre Dame; beating all except for Florida at least once.\nThe two schools discussed scheduling more games over the next several years, including a failed proposal by South Florida to play at the Citrus Bowl in 2011. In addition, a possible head-to-head matchup at the 2009 St. Petersburg Bowl failed to materialize. Bowl and city officials decided against pitting the two nearby schools, as they preferred at least one distant team so that more  out of town fans would book hotel rooms in the area. UCF instead faced Rutgers in the game.\nRenewed series (2013–present)\nUCF was admitted to join South Florida in the Big East Conference in 2011 and was set to begin playing there in the 2013–2014 school year. Conference realignment turned the Big East into the American Athletic Conference prior to the fall 2013 season. For the first time, both schools were part of the same conference, and the rivalry resumed as a regular conference match beginning with the 2013 season.\nSince 2013, the games have been scheduled for Thanksgiving weekend. In 2015, the game was played on Thanksgiving night, and in 2016, the game was played on the Saturday of that week, which happened again for the 2022 meeting. However, in most years it has been scheduled for Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.\nThe 2022 football game was the last game scheduled between the teams because UCF left the American for the Big 12 Conference starting in 2023. As of now, no future games have been scheduled.\nGame results\nSince 2005, the Bulls and Knights have played fourteen times. The Knights lead the series, 8–6. The game has been played in two cities and three stadiums: Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, and Camping World Stadium and FBC Mortgage Stadium in Orlando, Florida. UCF holds an 8–2 series lead in conference games against South Florida.\n| team2=UCF / FTU\n| team2style=\n| series_summary=yes\n| September 17, 2005 | Tampa, FL | South Florida | 31 | UCF | 14\n| September 16, 2006 | Orlando, FL | South Florida | 24 | UCF | 17\n| October 6, 2007 | Tampa, FL | #5 South Florida | 64 | UCF | 12\n| September 6, 2008 | Orlando, FL | #17 South Florida | 31 | UCF | 24OT\n| November 29, 2013 | Orlando, FL | South Florida | 20 | #19 UCF | 23\n| November 28, 2014 | Tampa, FL | South Florida | 0 | UCF | 16\n| November 26, 2015 | Orlando, FL | South Florida | 44 | UCF | 3\n| November 26, 2016 | Tampa, FL | South Florida | 48 | UCF |31\n| November 24, 2017 | Orlando, FL | #22 South Florida | 42 | #15 UCF | 49\n| November 23, 2018 | Tampa, FL  | South Florida |10 | #9 UCF | 38\n| November 29, 2019 | Orlando, FL | South Florida | 7 | UCF |34\n| November 27, 2020 | Tampa, FL | South Florida | 46 | UCF | 58\n| November 26, 2021 | Orlando, FL| South Florida | 13 | UCF |17\n| November 26, 2022 | Tampa, FL | South Florida | 39 | #22 UCF |46\n}}Bold dates indicate conference gamesItalic dates indicate games that count toward the trophy series\nMen's Basketball\n| largestvictory=South Florida, 120–87 (1975)\n| longeststreak=South Florida, 9 (1994–2007)UCF, 9 (2016–2020)\n| currentstreak=South Florida, 3\n| stadiums=South Florida: Yuengling CenterUCF: Addition Financial Arena\n}}\nThe two schools began competing against one another in men's basketball during the 1971–72 season and have met 48 times to date.

The Bulls hold a 12–8 lead in conference play. In 2021, the Bulls and Knights were in first and second place in the conference respectively going into the final two games of the regular season, both of which were War on I-4 matchups. UCF needed to win both games to clinch the title, while South Florida only needed to win one. The Bulls beat the Knights in Tampa in the first game to win the conference championship. The Bulls beat the Knights again nine days later in the AAC Tournament championship game. They met again in the championship game the following season, where the Knights came away victorious.
