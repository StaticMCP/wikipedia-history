For example, some window managers such as afterstep, awesome, and wmii automatically position the pointer to the centre of the current application window when that application is made current.\nWarping can also refer to shifting the mouse between monitors.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Mouse Warping\n\n#REDIRECT Mouse warping"
