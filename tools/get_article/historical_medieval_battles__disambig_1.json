Rules on armour and weapons for historical authenticity and safety are published on Battle of the Nations website.\nFighters are covered in full modern produced protective armour, made from steel (or other metal alloy if permitted) made to aesthetically be close to their historical counterparts. This in contrast to Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) that uses modern protective equipment such as a modern fencing helmet, padded fencing jacket, modern padded/heavy duty fencing gloves, forearm and leg protection.\nHits and blows may be aimed at any parts of the body (with the limitations set in the regulations); both wrestling and percussive techniques are permitted, thrusts are forbidden.\nUnlike staged battles, that can be seen at festivals of historical reenactment of the Middle Ages the competitions in buhurt are the full contact sporting events that are refereed by the referees called knight marshals who have special training and combat experience.\nHistory\nHistorical medieval battles date back to the first large-scale battles with the use of steel arms, which were held in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, at times when in the rest of the Eastern European countries reenactors used wooden or textolite weapons. An example is the festival \"Zhelezny Grad\" (Iron Town) held in Izborsk, where buhurts involving hundreds of fighters took place or Sword of Russia tournament from 1996.\nThe first European Championship took place in Ukraine in 2005, with nominations \"Sword and Shield\", and \"Sword vs Sword\".\nThe expansion of buhurt as a sport truly began after the first held Battle of the Nations in Khotyn Fortress in Ukraine where participants from Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and Russia competed under unified rules and regulations. This event attracted participants from the rest of Europe and outside of it and buhurt gained worldwide attention from reenactment community. There is a growing interest in buhurt in the United States. One such organization, Armored Combat League (which split in 2019, creating Armored Combat Worldwide and Armored Combat Sports) was featured in a series called Knight Fight on History Channel.\nBattle of the Nations is held every other year at a new fortress or castle.\nCompetitive categories\nHistorical medieval battle, like any other sport, has several categories. All its categories can be divided into mass and singles.\nSingle categories\nSingle categories, namely \"one vs one\" are divided into tournaments and professional fights.\nDuels\nPoints / hits are counted in one on one tournaments known as duels. A fighter must score the most amount of points to win, this is usually done in rounds of one minute with points scored based on striking. The duels categories are divided into:\n* \"Sword and shield\" fighters use a sword and shield in two rounds of one minute, with an extra round of thirty seconds if the result of the first two rounds is a draw. A strike to the head or torso is worth two points with the rest of the body worth one point. At the end of the rounds the fighter with the most points is declared the winner.\n* \"Sword and buckler\" fighters use a sword and buckler, in three rounds of no longer than one minute, each round is continued until a fighter reaches five points or the time runs out. All strikes are counted as one point. The fighter who wins two rounds first is declared the winner.\n* \"Longsword\" fighters use longswords in two rounds of one minute, with an extra round of thirty seconds if the result of the first two rounds is a draw. Strikes to the head and torso are worth two points with the rest is the body worth one point, strikes to the head and torso are worth one point if only one hand is used for the strike. At the end of the rounds the fighter with the most points is declared the winner.\n* \"Polearm\" fighters use polearms in two rounds of one minute, with an extra thirty seconds if the result of the first two rounds is a draw. A strike to the head and torso are worth two points with the rest of the body worth one point, strikes to the head and torso are worth one point if only one hand is used for the strike. At the end of the rounds the fighter with the most points is declared the winner.\nThere is also a category called \"Triathlon\": three rounds with different weapons, the first one – \"longsword\", the second one – \"sword and buckler\", the third one – \"sword and shield.\"\nOutrance\nThe second \"single\" HMB category is outrance. A fight is held in the format of \"two rounds of two minutes\" with a third round if the fights end in a tie. According to the rules, any techniques aimed at delivering blows to any part of the body are allowed, with the exceptions of: blows aimed at the neck, back of the knee, groin, eyes, feet, back of the head, and thrusts, which are prohibited in all HMB categories. All other things, including 10-second ground fighting with no active movements of the opponents are allowed.\nMass categories\n* \"5 vs 5\"\n* \"10 vs 10\"\n* \"12 vs 12\"\n* \"16 vs 16\"\n* \"30 vs 30\"\n* Buhurts\nThe rules of mass battles are slightly different. The “kill zones” are the same, but the winner is the one who remains standing on their feet, hits are not counted.\nIn addition to these categories, there are some others, such as the \"2 vs 2\" which are held in the “deathmatch” mode: several two-member units meet on the lists, the battle is \"all against all\" and the winner is the two-member unit, of which at least one fighter is on his feet; \"10 vs 10\" and others. HMB categories often can be created for a specific festival, depending on its objectives and specific requirements of historicity.\nTraining and preparation of fighters\nWorkouts are held in accordance with the most effective modern methods of training available in the martial arts. HMB fighters practice weight lifting, related martial arts, and cardiovascular workouts. Fighters often use groundwork of other contact martial arts in their training practices.\nRegulations\nThere are unified international rules for the battles. They prohibit a number of very traumatic techniques, as well as regulate the admission of fighters and their weapons in order to observe the historical reliability of equipment, and also to eliminate serious injuries. Due to the fact that different countries used to have different fighting rules, the first unified rules were developed specifically for the world championship on historical medieval battle, \"Battle of the Nations.\" However, the rules used at a local tournament may still differ, for example it may be prohibited to deliver blows to certain areas such as below the knee, or elbow, but the international rating events are conducted in accordance with the accepted international rules for historical medieval battles. Weapons are checked for correct measurements and safety before fighters enter the list.\nSee also\n* Historical European martial arts\nReferences"
