The aircraft in question was a Boeing 727-200 passenger plane flying from Monterrey (Nuevo Leon, Mexico) to then Federal District (now Mexico City). This act was carried out by members of the League of Armed Communists, led by Germán Segovia. The crew of flight MX705 consisted of pilot Abel Quintana Rodríguez as commander, former Mexican Air Force pilot Sergio Román Téllez y Fuentes as first officer and pilot Carlos Pérez Rivera.\nThe events\nOn November 8, 1972, flight 705 of Compañía Mexicana de Aviación was leaving Monterrey International Airport at 9:22 a.m. bound for Mexico City. The Boeing 727 was carrying 110 passengers when at 9:35 a.m. the captain of the aircraft, Abel Quintana Rodriguez, reported to the air traffic control tower that four armed individuals had taken command of the aircraft. The hijackers, conformed by Germán Segovia Escobedo, Armando González, José Luis Martínez and Alberto Sánchez H., were members of an urban guerrilla organization called the League of Armed Communists.\nThe reason for the hijacking was to demand the release of five detained members of the League of Armed Communists - Angel Mejia Nuñez, Francisca de Lourdes Saucedo Gomez, Reynaldo Sanchez Rodriguez, Edna Ovalle Rodriguez and Tomas Okusono Martinez - in exchange for the passengers and crew of the aircraft. The League of Armed Communists command claimed to have explosives capable of splitting the plane in half. Authorities consented to the release of the members and once they were all in the plane, at 12:55 p.m. they asked the air traffic control tower for a flight plan to Cuba. The aircraft took off for the island at 3:40 p.m. and landed at José Martí International Airport in Havana at 7:20 p.m. local time. The crew had arrived safely in the Cuban capital. They returned to Mexico on the same plane the following day, on November 9, the request for asylum in Cuba by the members of the League of Armed Communists was granted by the Cuban government.\nReferences\n* Reyes Peláez, Juan Fernando,\"Introducción a la historia de la guerrilla en México.1943-1983\", México, D.F, Editorial Lulu, 2005.\n* Gobierno de México.
