The party announced its intention to participate in a broad left-wing coalition during the upcoming parliamentary elections.\nOn the 23d of May, Videnov presented the alliance, composed of the following parties: Bulgarian Progressive Line, the Left Alternative, the Party of the Bulgarian Communists, the Socialist Party \"Bulgarian Way\", and the more conservative Revival of the Fatherland. Former BSP MP and Videnov ally, Ivan Atanasov, was selected as the alliance's leader, while Videnov assumed the role of organisational secretary.\nElection results\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ National Assembly of Bulgaria\n!Election\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Government\n|-\n!2021(July)\n|10,309\n|0.37\n|}}\n|New\n|\n|}\nReferences"
