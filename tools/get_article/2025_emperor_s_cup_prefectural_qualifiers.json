It is the 29th time that lower ranking teams qualify for the Emperor's Cup via prefectural tournaments, as before the 1996 Emperor's Cup, the lower ranked teams in the competition qualified via regional qualification.\nJ1 League and J2 League clubs did not participate in the prefectural tournaments, as those clubs are automatically qualified for the Cup.\nUsually, the format of the Emperor's Cup opens 48 berths for amateur clubs, with all of them being assigned into the first round of the competition. Alongside the 47 prefectural champions, the JFA annually assigns a specially designated club to complete the roster of 48 amateur teams into the round. The specially designated clubs automatically skip the qualification stage and then, does not participate in their respective prefectural tournaments. On 2025, Toyo University was benefited from it and skipped the Tokyo Metropolitan Qualifying Tournament.\nCustomarily, university teams are allowed to participate in each tournament. Some university clubs have two or more affiliated teams participating, with its second-and-beyond teams composed of present and past students in that university. The first-team of each universities uses its formal and original name to distinguish themselves from its affiliated teams, which is most of the time done by attaching abbreviations (such as \"FC\", \"AFC\" or \"SC\") to the names of their respective universities.\nPrefectural tournaments\nTeams playing in higher tiers usually receive a bye from the early stages of each tournament, with some automatically seeded to the prefectural final. This is the case with many J3 League teams, as the only professional clubs eligible to participate. Some prefectures holds qualification to their prefectural tournaments, splitting \"social representatives\" and \"university representatives\" into the qualifiers. This is more prone to occur when two or more clubs from the same prefecture are members of the J3 League and/or Japan Football League, as both leagues' clubs are exempt from being treated as a \"social representative\", a term which describes amateur clubs whose players are, or were affiliated unanimously, with the same university.\nThe boxes for each prefectural tournament below only shows matches of each prefecture's final tournament, omitting the preliminary rounds.\nHokkaido\n-------------\n*Source:\nAomori\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nIwate\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nAkita\n----\n----\n*Source:\nMiyagi\n-----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nYamagata\n-----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nFukushima\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nIbaraki\n----\n----\n*Source:\nTochigi\n--------\n----\n*Source:\nGunma\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nSaitama\n*Source:\nChiba\n*Source:\nTokyo\n----\n*Source:\nKanagawa\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nYamanashi\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nNiigata\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nNagano\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nToyama\n-----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nIshikawa\n----\n----\n*Source:\nFukui\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nShizuoka\n----\n*Source:\nAichi\n----\n*Source:\nGifu\n----\n*Source:\nMie\n----\n*Source:\nShiga\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKyoto\n----\n*Source:\nOsaka\n----\n----\n*Source:\nHyogo\n----\n----\n*Source:\nNara\n----\n----\n*Source:\nWakayama\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nTottori\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nShimane\n----\n----\n*Source:\nOkayama\n----\n*Source:\nHiroshima\n----\n----\n*Source:\nYamaguchi\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKagawa\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nTokushima\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nEhime\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKochi\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nFukuoka\n----\n----\n*Source:\nSaga\n----\n*Source:\nNagasaki\n----\n*Source:\nKumamoto\n----\n*Source:\nOita\n----\n----\n*Source:\nMiyazaki\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKagoshima\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nOkinawa\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nSee also\n*2025 Emperor's Cup\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.jfa.jp/eng/match/emperorscup_2025/ Emperor's Cup 2025], JFA.jp"
