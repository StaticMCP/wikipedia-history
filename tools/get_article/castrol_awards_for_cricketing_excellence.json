Thus, the highest scorer in tests gets 10 points, the second-highest gets 9 points, the third-highest gets 8 and so on. Similarly, the highest scorer in one-day internationals gets 10 points, the second highest gets 9 and so on. The same holds for the other categories.\nAt the end of the Castrol Year, the aggregate of the points gained by every player in all ten categories is computed and the players with the top five aggregates are declared the nominees for the Castrol Indian Cricketer of the Year Award.\nIn the second stage, a 'ballot form' comprising the names of the five nominees and a summary of their performances in tests and one-day internationals (with stats) is sent to all the living cricketers who have represented India in at least one test or five one-day internationals. They are asked to 'vote' for one of the five nominees and the player who receives the highest number of votes is declared the winner. The voting is by secret ballot and is monitored by Professional Management Group.\nThis award is not at all related to any kind of monitory gain for cricketers. But it confirms the brand value of them, just like any other prestigious awards. In 2010 and 2011, Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni received the Castrol Indian cricketer of the year awards. These reputation and great performance increased their earnings. Still both of them are listed as the top 10 richest cricketers in the world.\nCastrol Junior Cricketer of the Year\nPerformances of under-19 cricketers in under-19 / under-17 / under-15 level tournaments in the CASTROL Year are taken into account, as also performances in the Ranji Trophy by cricketers from this age-group. Maximum weightage is given to cricketers who have represented India in international junior-level tournaments like the Under-19 World Cup / Asia Cup or have been part of the India 'A' team on overseas tours.\nPerformances are scrutinized and a list of 15 players is sent to a panel of judges who have been associated with junior cricket. They are asked to recommend five nominees for the award and then pick one from among the five whom they feel deserves the award the most.\nLifetime achievement award\nThis award is presented to a personality who has brought laurels to Indian cricket with consistent and outstanding performances that earned him the adulation of the countrymen and respect of his opponents.\nReferences"
