Amongst them was Sossianus Hierocles, who was a praeses at some time between 293 and 303. The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire (PLRE) states that, as praeses, he governed Phoenice Libanensis, the province on the eastern side of Mount Lebanon. The district included Palmyra, where the inscription attesting to Hierocles' career is located.\nConsularis Governors of Phoenicia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"45%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFDEAD\"\n! width=\"20%\" | Consularis Governor\n! width=\"9%\" | Date\n|-\n| Aelius Statuus\n|Between 293 and 305\n|-\n| Sossianus Hierocles\n|Between 293 and 303\n|-\n| Julius Julianus\n|Before 305\n|-\n| Maximus\n|?

Frumentius and Edesius, who were both christian, gained favor with the king and his family, signaling the birth of Christianity in Ethiopia.\n320s\n*During the reign of Emperor Constantine, his mother, Helena of Constantinople, requests in 324  the destruction of all pagan temples and idols dedicated to Astarte.  The Astarte shrine in Maghdouché was probably destroyed at that time and converted to a place of devotion to Mary.\n*Paulinus of Tyre is the Patriarch of Antioch and all the East for about six months in 324 and 325.\n*The First Council of Nicaea – in which ten bishops from Phoenicia attended (one of them being Zeno I, bishop of Tyre) – is convened in 325 AD.\n330s\n(who died in 331 AD) in the museum of the Holy See of Cilicia at Antelias, Lebanon|278x278px|left]]\n*The First Synod of Tyre or the Council of Tyre (335 AD), a gathering of bishops, in which the first historically documented bishop of Tripoli, Hellanicus, took part, for the primary purpose of evaluating charges brought against Athanasius, the Patriarch of Alexandria, is called together by Emperor Constantine, with the former governor of Phoenice, Flavius Dionysius, taking charge of the council.\n*Emperor Constantine is baptized by the once-bishop of Beirut, Eusebius of Nicomedia, right before his death on 22 May 337.\n340s\n*Marcellinus, is attested as praeses of Phoenice in 342 AD.\n350s\n*The Letter 492 of Rhetorician Libanius to Vindonius Anatolius of Beirut is written in 356, in the letter, Libanius writes that Anatolius, a native of Phoenicia, had spent some time “among us”, (i.e. in Antioch).\n360s\n*In 360, Dominus the Elder, a law school professor, declines the invitation of Libanius to leave the Law School at Beirut and to teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch.\nof the martyrdom of Dorotheus|220x220px]]\n*Around 362 AD, Julian the Apostate burns a basilica that existed in Beirut.\n*The 107-year-old Dorotheus of Tyre, bishop of Tyre, is martyred in 362 AD.\n*In 365 AD, Tyre and Sidon alongside several other coastal cities are damaged by a tsunami caused by the Crete earthquake.\n370s\n*The Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek, already greatly damaged by earthquakes, is demolished under Theodosius in 379 and replaced by another basilica (now lost), using stones scavenged from the pagan complex.\n380s\n* The Edict of Thessalonica is issued on 27 February AD 380, making Christianity the sole official religion of the Roman empire.\n* Diodorus is bishop of Tyre, 381 AD.\n* Proculus, governor of Phoenicia, is Comes Orientis between 383 and 384.

This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350.\nChariot racing\nA lead tablet, cursing the blue faction, was found in Beirut\nin 1929 and has now been dated to the fourth century CE.\nReligion\nThe Life of Constantine mentions a temple at Aphaca in Phoenicia, on a remote summit of Mount Libanus, being used by effeminate homosexual pagan priests, and says that this temple was destroyed by the command of Roman emperor Constantine I.\nEconomy\nDuring the fourth-century abundant crops of grain, wine, oil, and other products were attributed to the cities of Berytus, Byblos, Tyre, and Sarepta. Further evidence of agricultural production near Berytus is found in the fourth-century journal of the bureaucrat Theophanes, who traveled between Antioch and Egypt from 317 to 324 AD. In Berytus, Theophanes noted buying two types of bread (\"pure white\" for officials amongst his party and \"coarse\" for the servants), as well as grapes, figs, pumpkins or squashes, peaches, apricots, and cleaning supplies such as natron, bath oil, and soap. Similar purchases of bread, fresh produce, wine, and even snow to cool the wine (in Byblos) were made during each stop along the journey. They also came to Sidon on the following day and bought eggs.\nArchitecture\n*Shrine of Our Lady of Nourieh.\n*Our Lady of Awaiting, Maghdouché.\n*A basilica in Tyre built upon the ruins of a church by the city's bishop, Paulinus.\nPeople\nProfessors at the Berytus Law School\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
