It is the largest inland oil storage depot in the United Kingdom.\nThe main operators at the site are Essar, Warwickshire Oil Storage Limited and Valero Energy Corporation. The site also has facilities from Shell and pipeline operations from the British Pipeline Agency.\nHistory\nIt opened on 19 March 1969, and officially opened on 24 March 1969 by Roy Mason, the Minister of Power, and also the Thames-Mersey oil pipeline, which cost £8.5m, being 245 miles. This pipeline would carry 4m tonnes of oil per year, at first, leading to 8m tonnes. There was an official luncheon at The Belfry in Wishaw, Warwickshire.\nIt cost £3.5m, with 36 tanks, holding 200,000 tons. 200 road tankers would operate, with a 50 mile radius from the site. It was built for Regent Oil, Mobil, Shell-Mex and BP, and Petrofina.\nIn August 2006 the terminal was targeted by terrorists as part of a terror plot involving several sites across the country.\nProtests\nDuring protests by Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion in April 2022, more than 100 climate activists, ages ranging between 25 and 71, were arrested.\nOn 14 September 2022, 51 Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested for breach of court order after blocking the entrance to the Kingsbury Oil Terminal.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.macearchive.org/films/midlands-news-24031969-opening-oil-supply-pipeline-kingsbury-warwickshire Opens in March 1969]\n*[http://www.zettai.net/find/warwickshire/oil-fuel-distributors/ Oil fuel distributors in Warwickshire]"
