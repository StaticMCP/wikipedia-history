Formed as a way to rally the Atlanta sports community and recognize athletic excellence on an annual basis, the awards aim to honor those individuals who distinguish themselves from the five-plus million people who live in the Atlanta area.\nThe Atlanta Sports Council, a division of the Metro Atlanta Chamber, facilitates the growth and development of sports in metro Atlanta by serving as an event recruiter. The organization plays an important role in improving the quality of life for residents in the region, works to drive economic growth and visibility, and acts as an advocate for the area teams and annual sporting events.\nAwards\nCategories\nThe \"A\" awards are given on behalf of the Atlanta sports community to individuals and teams who have achieved athletic excellence during the calendar year.
