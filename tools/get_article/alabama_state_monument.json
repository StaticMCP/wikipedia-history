It memorializes the Confederate units from Alabama that took part in the Battle of Gettysburg.\nHistory and descriptive details\nThis monument is located in an area of the national park that was occupied by Evander M. Law's Alabama Brigade prior to their attack on the Round Tops on July 2, 1863. It was dedicated by the Alabama Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy on November 12, 1933.\nThe memorial was created by Joseph Urner. It features a large granite base topped by a granite monolith, fronted by a bronze figure group. The granite was quarried from Gettysburg and Vermont, with the bronze cast at the Hammaker Brothers Foundry. The bronze group composition features a female figure representing the Spirit of the Confederacy, flanked by a wounded soldier on her right and an armed soldier on her left. Her left arm gestures the armed soldier to continue fighting and her right lightly restrains the wounded figure from further combat.  The top of the granite monolith is inscribed with the word \"Alabamians!\" and the base with \"Your Names Are Inscribed On Fames Immortal Scroll.\"\nSee also\n*List of monuments of the Gettysburg Battlefield\nReferences"
