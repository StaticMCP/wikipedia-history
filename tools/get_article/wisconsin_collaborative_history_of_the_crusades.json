The work was a major collaborative effort under the general editorship of American medieval historian Kenneth M. Setton. Begun at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950, the work was finished at the University of Wisconsin, and is generally known as the Wisconsin History. Setton oversaw the work of over sixty specialists, covering 98 topics on the full gamut of Crusader studies, reflecting of the concurrent state of the knowledge, with timelines, gazetteers and indexes. The work may be today regarded as uneven in parts and at times dated, but remains as an important resource in the study of the various aspects of crusading history, with fine maps, bibliographies and toponymic details.\nThe contents of the Wisconsin Collaborative History are as follows.\n* Volume I.

Hazard.\n* Timeline of the Crusades, 1049–1571.\nWriting in the foreword, Setton described the work as being originally devised by Dana C. Munro whose ambition was to write a comprehensive history of the Crusades. The inception was realized by students of Munro's, including Frederic Duncalf, together with John L. LaMonte and German historian August C. Krey. Duncalf and Steven Runciman would later write the key chapters on the First Crusade. They were joined by such historians as Aziz S. Atiya, Marshall W. Baldwin, T. S. R. Boase, Claude Cahen, H. A. R. Gibb, Philip K. Hitti, Urban T. Holmes, Jr., Joan Mervyn Hussey, Bernard Lewis, Sidney Painter, Joshua Prawer, Jean Richard, Denis Sinor, Joseph Reese Strayer, Robert L. Wolff and Norman P. Zacour in writing the comprehensive history.\nThe origins of the need for such a history is discussed by LaMonte in his Some Problems in Crusading Historiography. LaMonte's leadership on the project ended with his death in 1949, and the lead was assumed by Setton at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950. The Wisconsin History, Runciman's A History of the Crusades, and René Grousset's Histoire des croisades are the three works that rank as being monumental by 20th century standards, according to The Routledge Companion to the Crusades.\nReferences"
