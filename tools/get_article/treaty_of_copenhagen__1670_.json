It was written in Latin. It was expanded the next day, 12 July 1670, with the Third Article concerning contraband amended and clarified by a declaration in French signed at Copenhagen on 4 July 1780. The terms of the treaty were later reaffirmed by the Treaty of Kiel, following the defeat of Denmark-Norway during the Napoleonic Wars.\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3kDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186 Treaty between Great Britain  and Denmark.]\" Extracted and translated from the Latin in Hertslet, Lewis.
